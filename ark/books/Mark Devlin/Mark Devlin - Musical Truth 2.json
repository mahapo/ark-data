My gaining some advancedunderstanding of the massive degree to which these elements are present in oureveryday lives has been the inspiration behind this book being put into theworld. Truth wages war against deception wherever it finds it.Although the information in this book can be meaningfully absorbed in isolationand on its own merits, I highly recommend that it be digested only after readingeverything I had to say in the first volume of ‘Musical Truth.’ This will givean appreciation of the bigger picture, and render everything presented here inits true context. This also saves me having to recap too much on subjectscovered in that first book, instead using this one to present new pieces of thepuzzle.The researching and writing of these two books has been as much a learningexperience for me as it will be for the readers. On the day you read thesewords, I (and everyone else) will know so much more than I did on the day Iwrote them. But I’ll know so much more tomorrow. I learned long ago that it’s aserious mistake to assume you know everything there is to know about a subject,and I’m suspicious of anyone who ever makes so bold a claim. The same limitedconsciousness also leads an individual to the notion that they’re too smart tobe fooled, and can’t possibly have been duped and misled about a certain subjectin a way that somebody else might be suggesting they have. I’m sure we’re allfamiliar with this aspect of the human condition through the back-and-forth,concrete-minded arguments that occur every single day on the average Facebookthread or Youtube comments section, reinforcing the old truism that opinions arelike assholes – everybody’s got one.This is not to say that the ego is not important; a well-balanced,consciously-evolved individual understands that the key to navigating thischallenging reality we refer to as ‘life,’ involves striking a balance betweenthe informed consciousness that comes from a connection to our higher selves,and keeping one foot firmly planted in the ‘real’ world, where we have ourphysical experiences that are unique to the human condition, and through whichour souls undergo so much of their essential growth.It is this process of continual evolution that has brought the necessity forthis second volume. In so many ways, the first only just scratched the surface.As I have delved ever further into the complex, often dark, but continuallyfascinating question of who really controls the world of ‘entertainment,’ andthe agendas for which it’s really being used, I’ve come to realise that it goesso deep, that even an entire human lifetime dedicated exclusively to full-timeresearch still wouldn’t provide all of the answers! All that any of us can do,therefore, is take on as much understanding and knowledge of these subjects asour time here allows.As well as the new subjects detailed on the Contents page, this book brieflyrevisits a handful of the topics covered in Volume 1, adding new informationwhere it has come to light, as well as some more informed perspectives that onlycome with the passage of time. As before, I absolutely encourage all readers tonot just take my word for anything, but to do their own further research, (withthe obvious proviso of avoiding state-controlled and corporate-owned entitiesand sticking with independent outlets.) As before, a comprehensive list ofresources for further study is included at the end of each chapter. (Just typingthe subject line of each into an on-line search may be less clunky than manuallyinputting each of the URLs. Or see the offer of having a list of the webaddresses e-mailed for convenience at the end.)As I’ve pointed out many times, the manipulations of the music industry – ascolossally far-reaching as they are – are still only one small part of theoverall scenario of human slavery; of the few manipulating the thoughts,emotions and actions of the many; of the battle between good and evil which,ultimately, provides the reason why any of us chose – in higherconsciousness – to incarnate here in human form. I realise that the reason Imyself took on a fascination with pop music from the age of five, and why Ipursued a career as a music man, is because it was always my job to expose thisone small fragment of the story. I therefore leave insights into other aspectsof conspiracy – whether it’s banking scams, the birth certificate fraud,geo-engineering, false-flag terror hoaxes, cancer, or whatever else – to skilfuland talented researchers who can do a much better job in those areas than I can.The subject matter contained in these two books is where I’ve needed to focus myown individual contributions. And each and every one of us has a part to play inthis overall process – more of that in the final chapter.So, here’s where the story continues.

And down. And down. Everyone looks ill atthe end of the night. All lost the power of speech, desperately avoiding eyecontact. Your new soulmate that you’ve been talking codshit to for the past fivehours about the story of Creation or the fourth ‘Star Wars’ film, is now acomplete stranger. You can’t even look him in the eye. The only thing you’ve gotin common now is your paranoia. It’s coming through the walls, man. The childrenof ecstasy aren’t safe any more. They’re no longer ‘all together as one,’ butseparate mental patients that yearn to be ejected out of this poisonedatmosphere to a warm bed and a friendly therapist. Reality’s on her way. Wheream I? What have I done? Was it worth it?”Dialogue from the movie ‘Human Traffic’ (1999)Through the research I’ve thrown myself into since the publication of ‘MusicalTruth 1,’ it has become clear that anyone in the public eye who has gained anydegree of familiarity, to the point that the average member of the public hasheard of them, has had their career facilitated for them. This goes for allmanner of celebrities in just the same way it does for world leaders andpoliticians, regardless of the type of celebrity role. Sports stars,supermodels, television presenters, actors or musicians – it’s all the same. Thecontrol system that currently presides over this world would not leave to chancewhich individuals would rise to prominence under their own steam. They don’t do‘random.’ The network of dark occultists who run every institution in humansociety have long had the entertainment industry in their grasp. In fact, manywould maintain that the very reason for the film and popular music industriesbeing established in the first place, was down to the tremendous opportunitiesto mind-control massive amounts of people that they present, and to subliminallyimplant certain thoughts, emotional responses and value systems into theconsciousness of the masses.The ingenious thing about achieving this through entertainment is that anindividual’s guard is completely down. No-one is expecting to be brainwashedwhen they simply want some light relief from the drudgery of their everydaylife, through listening to a favourite pop artist or engaging in some mindlessescapism at the cinema, or through their TV. Suggest to the average person thatthis is exactly what’s going on, and they’ll likely dismiss the notion with aderisive scoff, and write off anyone making the claim as ‘crazy,’ (all the whiledoing precisely zero research of their own to verify whether there’s anyfoundation to these claims, naturally!) Not only does the entertainment industryprovide a unique way to reach the mentality of entire societies, but the cherryon the cake for those doing the manipulating, is that the subjects pay quitewillingly for their own mind-control!In the same way that anyone you’ve heard of will have been shuffled into theirposition of prominence as a Chosen One – over and above any candidate who mighthave got there through their own efforts if things had been left to evolve inthat way – so it is with any fad, movement or trend. Anything with an ‘ism’ atthe end, from fascism to feminism to Buddhism to veganism, (something Irecognise despite choosing to be a vegan myself,) displays the hallmarks ofhaving been manufactured. Any social movement which dictates or coerces thevalue systems or behaviours of entire groups of people, will have beenengineered into place by an organisation such as The Tavistock Institute ofHuman Relations, The Frankfurt School, The Fabian Society, The RockefellerFoundation, Stanford Research Institute, The Esalen Institute, Cambridge,Oxford, Yale, Harvard, Berkeley or Princeton Universities, or some other‘think-tank’ organisation which specialises in shaping and moulding culture. Itis through systematic social engineering that terms like ‘homophobe,’‘conspiracy theorist,’ ‘metrosexual’ and ‘LGBT’ come into play.Occasionally, these organisations test the water with experiments to see how farthey still have culture under their psychological grip. This is when we get‘trends’ such as the Kony 2012 ‘viral’ video, the placing of a French flag overa Facebook profile picture to ‘show solidarity’ following the Paris ‘terrorattacks,’ or the Ice Bucket Challenge, No Make-up Selfie, or Wear Pink forBreast Cancer ‘fads.’ The satisfaction that the controllers must experience inseeing people in their millions responding to these manufactured trends inexactly the way they had predicted, must be a source of great satisfaction.If this is the case with all celebrities, all social and political movements,and any kind of fad, trend or ‘scene,’ therefore . . . why would anyone expectthings to be different with any kind of musical movement which emerges veryrapidly to unite and give a cultural identity to massive amounts ofpeople – particularly if it ends up having marketable appeal in pretty muchevery country in the world?CULTURE BEATSAs a 2014 article on the Thump website put it:“Acid House was Britain’s biggest youth revolution since the 60s, and its legacyhas changed the country’s cultural landscape forever. A quarter of a century on,its impact can be felt in everything from fashion to film, to interior design.It redefined our notion of a night out. It even changed the law of the land.”And from Matthew Collin’s book ‘Altered State’:“Ecstasy culture had become the primary leisure activity for British youth,seamlessly integrated into the fabric of the weekend ritual. From 1990 onwards,as the fall-out from Acid House germinated across the country, its sounds,signs, symbols and slang had become all-pervasive, part of the everydaylandscape.”That, presumably, would have been the plan. And the article’s later observationthat “every generation is desperate for something to call their own – somethingtheir parents don’t understand” comes straight out of the social-conditioning101 textbook. Fomenting discord between the generations is a tactic that’s beenemployed by manipulators of culture for centuries.This overview of Acid House culture, and how it paved the way for the massiveworldwide dance music scene, makes no claims to be an all-embracing account ofthe story. To do that would require an entire book in itself, and there havealready been plenty, (the best of which remains Matthew Collin’s aforementioned‘Altered State.’) This book’s revisiting of the scene takes an approach whichhas never been employed before, however – to assemble key pieces of information,and to ask whether these provide evidence of a Hidden Hand’s intervention inensuring the movement went off in a pre-planned direction, rather than randomlyevolving on its own.It’s very difficult to obtain direct proof that this was the case – as any otherresearcher setting off on such a mission will surely find – sincewhistle-blowers and insiders admitting they were employed by some aspect of theintelligence services are in short supply. And to my knowledge, no declassifieddocuments have so far emerged revealing such an agenda. It took the best part of50 years for the full story of the 60s counter-culture and its co-opting by theCIA to be adequately told. It’s my hope that whatever truth remains to berevealed about the scene that came along two decades later on the other side ofthe Atlantic, however, won’t take quite as long. It often takes the nextgeneration to figure out what really happened with a social movement from beforeits time, since those that lived it have too much personal attachment andnostalgic investment to be able to view things objectively. And such uncoveringscan only occur with the availability of new proofs and evidence – a processwhich was almost impossible before the advent of the internet.Whereas the 60s hippie scene espoused the overthrowing of the social systems ofthe day and their replacing with new peace-and-love ideals, (at least on thesurface,) its 80s British equivalent lacked any political aspect. Rather thanseeking to change the status-quo of the time, the Acid House spirit was simplyabout escaping from it by way of one long party. Whether he realised it or not,Matthew Collin himself dropped a hint as to a potential connection between thetwo ‘Summers of Love’ when he wrote in ‘Altered State’:“There were so few people involved that friendships became all-consuming.Suddenly, all they could talk about was love, togetherness, sharing, the sheerjoy of life. In Ibiza they had discovered something they hardly knew how tocomprehend, and so they looked for the nearest comparison they could find – themythology of the hippie era – adopting a simulacrum of what they believed thesixties were like, a hand-me-down, pick-and-mix bag of fashions andslogans – minus the radical politics of the era – all viewed through a prism ofsuburban working-class aspirations.“Yet they sincerely believed that the fabric of their minds was changing. Werethey turning into hippies, they asked themselves, was this the beginning of aNew Age?”Further possible clues came from the ethno-botanist-turned counter-culture iconTerence McKenna in comments following his ‘Evolution’ lecture in London in 1992:“With electronic culture you can create shamans for the global planetaryvillage. And this, to my mind, is the function that Rock ’n’ Roll played in the60s, and House music should play in the 90s.”And later:“Through emphasis in House music and Rave culture on physiologically compatiblerhythms, that sound, properly understood, can actually change neurologicalstates in large groups of people getting together, creating a telepathiccommunity of bonding that hopefully would be strong enough that it would carrythe vision out into the mainstream of society.”Unfortunately, however, it would appear that McKenna’s status as a consciousnessguru – like that of his contemporary Timothy Leary – may have been sponsored bya familiar type of agency, according to comments he himself made while lecturingat California’s Esalen Institute, (itself heavily connected to mind-controlresearch,) in 1994:“Certainly, when I reached La Chorrera in 1971 I had a price on my head by theFBI. I was running out of money, I was at the end of my rope and they recruitedme and said, you know, with a mouth like yours there’s a place for you in ourorganisation and, you know, I’ve worked in deep background positions, aboutwhich the less said the better, and then about 15 years ago they shifted me intopublic relations, and I’ve been there to the present.”The author Graham Hancock, on whom McKenna has been a major influence, has triedto argue that by ‘they,’ McKenna was actually referring to ‘alien intelligences’to which he was able to connect when altering his consciousness withpsychedelics. It seems pretty clear to me what was implied by the abovestatement, however, with ‘they’ directly following his reference to the FBI. Yetanother counter-culture ‘hero’ would appear to have been on the payroll of oneof the alphabet agencies, at least for a time.THE TRIPBy 1988, House music records from Chicago, New York and New Jersey had come tobe a staple part of black music DJs sets in the UK, played alongside more souland funk-based tunes, and New York Hip-Hop output. The change in attitudetowards a more all-embracing approach to music was kick-started by the briefflourish of a scene that came to be known as ‘Balearic Beat.’ The story behindits inception has long since passed into legend.Four young London DJs – Paul Oakenfold, Danny Rampling, Nicky Holloway andJohnny Walker, (not to be confused with veteran Radio 1 DJ Johnnie Walker) – hadgone on holiday to Ibiza in late August 1987 for Oakenfold’s birthday, and werecaptivated by the eclectic sets being played at Amnesia nightclub by veteranArgentinian DJ Alfredo Fiorito. Alongside the latest US House tunes sat obscureEuropean dance records, Indie Rock, Ambient, Electronica and World Music.Wikipedia’s account of the story adds that: “The friends also discovered themusic’s powerful synergy with the drug MDMA that reduced inhibitions and createda sense of one-ness on the dancefloor.” In a nostalgic interview with the UK’s‘Guardian’ newspaper in 2007, meanwhile, Nicky Holloway recalled:“We all tried ecstasy for the first time together, and then the whole thing madesense. Alfredo was playing (Chicago house label imprints) Trax and DJInternational next to Kate Bush and Queen – all the white English acts we’d turnour noses up at. But on E, it all made sense. Half an hour or so after younecked a pill ,you would suddenly feel this euphoric wave go through you, likeshooom! – hence the name of Danny’s club – and you suddenly felt that everythingin the world was alright.”As the London boys returned to their respective gigs back home, they feltinspired to introduce this more open-minded approach to their sets, and begandropping a variety of different styles on their crowds as they had seen Alfredodoing. The timing was fortuitous, as this period coincided with the increasingavailability of US House, prompting British producers to create their ownproductions, and the Balearic converts to launch new club nights to embracethese styles. In Rampling’s case, this led to the inception of his legendaryShoom nights, originally staged at a gym known as The Fitness Centre inSouthwark before going on to other homes around London. The name is said to havebeen inspired by the euphoric rush a raver feels when3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or ecstasy,) first starts to kick inand stimulate chemicals in the brain. Richard West, better known as Mr. C of therave act The Shamen, alluded to the sensation from necking his first pill in a2014 interview with the Thump/ Vice website:“At first I felt nothing. Then my hands started to become sweaty and my mouthkind of dry. All of a sudden, I felt these tingles down my spine and the hair onthe back of my neck stood on end. Before I knew it I had these big overwhelmingrushes passing though my body. The bass in the music felt like it was inside meand all of a sudden, everything made sense, like I knew why I was there.Something cleared deep in my subconscious and I was filled with empathy. I lovedeveryone, wanted to hug everyone, and not just for the sake of it, but because Ireally did love them.”Oakenfold, meanwhile, established the Spectrum event at Heaven nightclub inLondon’s Charing Cross, owned by Establishment asset ‘Sir’ Richard Branson. Thisinitially ran on Monday nights in late 1987, where the party was dubbed ‘TheTheatre Of Madness.’ You can get a feel for the Balearic vibe of 1988 bylistening to one of Oakenfold’s live Spectrum sets here –https://soundcloud.com/rave_on/paul-oakenfold-live-spectrum-london-uk-061988[https://soundcloud.com/rave_on/paul-oakenfold-live-spectrum-london-uk-061988]His Friday night promotion, Future, fused House sounds with Indie Rock, andpaved the way for him to later remix the likes of the Happy Mondays, The Cureand the Stone Roses, and to become the tour DJ for U2. There’s an originalrecording from a Future session, with DJ Nancy Noise guesting alongsideOakenfold in June ’88, here – * https://www.mixcloud.com/martyn-booers-bower/paul-oakenfold-nancy-noise-livethe-future-london-june-88/ [https://www.mixcloud.com/martyn-booers-bower/paul-oakenfold-nancy-noise-livethe-future-london-june-88/]Nicky Holloway’s project was the revealingly-titled The Trip, (later re-namedSin,) at the nearby Astoria Theatre. Among other London DJs to embrace the newspirit of House music were Colin Faver, (who died of multiple organ failure inSeptember 2015) and ‘Evil’ Eddie Richards at Camden Palace, Maurice and NoelWatson at Delirium, Jay Strongman and Mark Moore, (of the act S-Express) atHeaven, and Dave Dorrell at RAW. There was also Judge Jules, (a London School ofEconomics graduate whose uncle, as a matter of curiosity, is the celebrity chefRick Stein OBE, and whose dad was an TV producer who worked on the ITV sci-fiseries ‘Sapphire And Steel,’) and Carl Cox, who had installed the sound systemat Rampling’s very first Shoom party. A great many of this scene’s tastemakershad previously been active on the soul, funk and disco scenes. Acid’s very looseanchoring in ‘black dance music’ justified its appeal. As its fashionabilitybecame apparent, most of the new converts allowed themselves to be swept alongby the electronic wave, rather than returning to their more soulful roots.Many of the key DJs made use of the new phenomenon of sampling snippets of olderrecords, over newly-created, dancefloor-friendly beats. Several of the resultingcut-and-paste-style records became crossover hits, among them Bomb The Bass’s‘Beat Dis,’ Coldcut’s ‘Doctorin’ The House,’ S-Express’s ‘Theme From S-Express,’and the earlier ‘Pump Up The Volume’ by M.A.R.R.S. Jeff Young, a DJ who had comeout of the soul scene, (and not to be confused with the former Megadethguitarist of the same name!) began his ’Big Beat’ show on Radio 1 in October1987, which was ideal timing to harness the new-found spirit of the times andexpose the emerging dance scene to listeners across the UK.The spirit of these clubs, and the convenient convergence with an influx ofecstasy pills on the scene, led to it quickly picking up the moniker of ‘AcidHouse.’ This was the catalyst for a new type of electronic dance record to becreated. London’s ‘Acid’ sound saw a rush of instrumental tracks produced onsynthesisers and drum machines, the trademark sound being bubbling, undulatingbasslines, heavy on effects such as Flange and Auto Pan, and manipulated to givea ‘squelching’ sound. Many contained short stabs of vocal samples, oftenfeaturing orgasmic moans or wails. The inspiration for so many of thesecreations had come out of Chicago in 1987 in the form of the epic ‘Acid Tracks’by Phuture, often credited as ‘the first Acid House record’. Former Phuturemember DJ Pierre went on to curate many more of the defining sounds of thissub-genre. The term ‘Acid House’ is said to have been first coined by Chicagoproducers in direct reference to the distinctive sounds of the Roland TB-303electronic synthesiser-sequencer.[../images/00002.jpeg]The smiley yellow face; icon of the UK Acid House scene, but with some moresinister overtones over the decades.Credit: The AuthorEarly Acid House records are very dated by today’s standards. But 30 years ofhindsight can also remind us of how menacing and unsettling they now sound. Acidtunes weren’t happy records; the hands-in-the air euphoric rave anthems withtheir blissful breakdowns came slightly later as the 90s dawned. Factoring inthe drug of choice which permeated the scene, the burbling synth arrangementscould be considered an audio mimicking of the chemicals sweeping through thebrains of the listeners.The chosen act name of Phuture certainly turned out to be prophetic given that,knowingly or otherwise, this group was laying the foundations in the 1980s for astyle of music that would come to transform societies all over the world in thecoming decades.THE SECOND SUMMER OF LOVEIt was the middle months of 1988 that came to be conveniently dubbed ‘The SecondSummer of Love’ by the media of the time. It’s also of great interest that theterm ‘Acid House’ came to be coined as a moniker for the whole movement inquestion, as it provides one of many direct throwbacks to the earlier,manipulated social movement of the 60s when ‘Acid’ meant LSD. (Tragically, theUK’s ‘Sun’ “newspaper” in its naivety, took the term literally when it starteddocumenting the ‘evils’ of Acid House in Summer 1988, assuming the ‘Acid’ partto mean this scene was fuelled by LSD!) The Scottish group Danny Wilson paidtribute to this scenario in their 1989 song of that name, whose lyrics include:“Ah, the second Summer of Love is here, so tell your angry friends, to throwaway their Gaultier and grow their hair again.” And later: “Acid on the radio,Acid on the brain, Acid everywhere you go, Acid in the rain.”This moniker alone may raise the curiosity of anyone who has researched how theoriginal Summer of Love in 1967 was very much the result of culture-creation atthe hands of agencies like the CIA. Many books, articles and videos are nowavailable to show how this was done – particularly the work of Jan Irvin atGnostic Media, his interviews with musicologist Dr. Hans Utter and ‘Unspun’podcasts with Joseph Atwill, and the book ‘Weird Scenes Inside The Canyon’ bythe late Dave McGowan. Was this naming of the newly-emerged UK scene a sly andsubtle clue towards it also being the product of behind-the-scenesmanipulations?Considering the notion that the truth of a matter is always placed in plainsight, there is certainly no shortage of indicators that this ‘new’ UK scene wasin fact a cynical upgrading of a well-worn blueprint, merely rebooted andtweaked for a new generation on a different continent. So many of these cluescan be found in British Acid House records themselves. Arguably the best knownof all is the crossover hit ‘We Call It Acieed’ by D-Mob, an act fronted by‘Dancin’ Danny Poku, who had previously been a soul and funk DJ and producer.The song, which reached No. 3 in the UK singles chart, includes the lyric “youturn on, you tune in, you drop out. Acid has that effect” in homage to thepopular phrase of the 60s scene. The song’s video features dancers sporting asingle eye in place of their heads. The track also states that Acid “puts you ina trance.”The main intention of it all, perhaps? The 60s LSD apologist TimothyLeary, meanwhile, (who just happened to have been a self-admitted asset of theCIA, and had the “turn on, tune in, drop out” phrase gifted to him by thephilosopher and intellectual Marshall McLuhan,) is sampled on many a late-80souting, including Psychic TV’s ‎’Tune In (Turn On The Acid House,’) and thephrase is uttered by a Prince Charles impersonator on the same year’s ‘Don’tBelieve The Hype’ credited to the none-too-subtly-named Mista E.A further track, simply titled ‘E’ by an ’artist’ of the same name, containsvocal samples of the phrase ‘LSD,’ along with dialogue lifted from the cult TVshow ‘The Prisoner’ in another 1960s throwback. ‘Acid Man’ by Jolly Roger, apseudonym of the producer ‘Evil’ Eddie Richards, contains the hippie-era phrase‘far out, man!’ Coming slightly later, Primal Scream’s ‘Loaded’ contains asample of Peter Fonda from the 60s biker movie ‘The Wild Angels.’ E-Zee Posse,meanwhile, were about as subtle as a flying mallet in the titling of their‘Everything Starts With an E.’ Vocalist MC Kinky draws frequent parallelsbetween the new drug scene and its earlier American cousin with lines like: “Land an S and a D coming in like love sex and danger. Drop a tab of E and make werub with a stranger.” And: “ETC and Acid is a stoned unwind, trip out to Hendrixsolos, ‘Scuse me while I kiss the sky.”Visual nods can also be found in some of the accompanying artwork, meanwhile.The flyer for a night called Listen See Destroy (LSD) advertises a session withDivine Styler, ‘the Timothy Leary of Hip-Hop’. And promotion for Spectrum’sfirst all-day event in London included the question ‘can you pass the Acidtest?’ in a throwback to CIA asset Ken Kesey and his Merry Pranksters, whodistributed free LSD to the attendees of hippie communes and psychedelicfestivals back in the California heyday. Paul Oakenfold selected a singlebloodshot eye as the promotional motif for his ‘Theatre of Madness’ nights atSpectrum. The eye had originally appeared on a poster for the Grateful Dead, agroup which is known to have been a direct creation of the CIA, with two of itsnumber having also been members of the Bohemian Club secret-society. It got afurther airing on the sleeve design to ‘Jibaro,’ the ‘Balearic Beat’ single thatOakenfold put out with fellow producer Steve Osborne in the wake of that fatefultrip – no pun intended – to Ibiza.Intriguingly, a 2017 article in the UK’s ‘Guardian’ suggested that things werestarting to go full-circle in Ibiza, with a return to the 1960s hippie idealsthat once characterised the island – the ‘Boho’ scene – becoming fashionable toa new generation overfed on electronic dance beats and debaucherous lifestyles.Referencing the newly-established Aniwa Gathering, it stated:“While the Tech House superclubs prepare for another night of narcotics andvest-clad fist pumping, this is an event singing to a different tune. If you’veever wondered what happens when a former Brazilian model and an ex-director of atech startup discover Ayahuasca, then you’ve found your answer: they launch afoundation dedicated to the promotion of indigenous culture, start a festivaland fly in 40 spiritual leaders from around the world to lead a series of talks,performances and ceremonies, including the ritualistic sharing of cacao, theconsumption of “plant medicine” and sweat lodges.”Where have I come across a scenario like that before?HARMONIC SONICSThe timing of the ‘Second Summer of Love,’ coming as it did when the 1980s gaveway to the 90s, is of great personal interest to me. The elite controllers areimpeccable planners who play the long game and plot their moves decades inadvance. They also time these in line with numerology, astrology, and otheresoteric factors. The manipulations of the counter-culture scene of two decadesprevious seemed, in part, to be all about experimentation on the generationknown as the ‘baby boomers’ – those born immediately post World War 2, and whowere coming of age in the mid to late-1960s. There was also much talk, among theoccult groups of those times, of tapping into the spirit of the astrological Ageof Aquarius, and a shifting away from the previous epoch of Pisces, (even thoughno scholars or researchers seem able to pinpoint with any accuracy when this Agewill actually be upon us, with estimates ranging from 1447 to 3597 AD!)Could this paradigm shift have been echoed at the time of the British dancemusic revolution? Or did these events signify some other highly meaningfulevents occurring? Acid pioneer Danny Rampling has always been one of dancemusic’s more interesting DJs to listen to in interviews. While others arelimited in conversation matter to ‘the scene’ or to their latest career move, Irecall Rampling being asked in a video interview with ‘DMC’ magazine in 2014where he came from, and replying, ‘London . . . and somewhere out in the starsoriginally.’ I also recall him speaking on the radio of driving back from hisgigs in 1997 to the sight of the Hale-Bopp comet burning brightly in the nightskies, something which no other DJs felt significant enough to reference. Hispropensity towards cosmic phenomena led to a revealing comment in an interviewwith the UK’s ‘Guardian’ in 2007. Reflecting on what led he and his mates toembrace the spirit of the dance scene twenty years earlier, Rampling commented:“I’ll bring something different to the table here. I felt there was somethingdeeper, spiritually, running through the whole experience. I discoveredsomething recently, through my own research. In August 1987, there was an eventcalled the Harmonic Convergence, a global shift in unity consciousness throughdance rituals, which is part of the Maya calendar teachings.”Wikipedia’s account of this event is as follows:“The timing of the Harmonic Convergence was allegedly significant in the Mayacalendar, with some consideration also given to European and Asian astrologicaltraditions. The chosen dates have the distinction of allegedly marking aplanetary alignment with the Sun, Moon and six out of eight planets being “partof the grand trine.”Though questions remain among genuine seekers about the true cosmology of theplace in which we live, the grand trine is said to reflect a rare alignment ofeight planets which, according to astrologer Neil Michelsen’s ‘The AmericanEphemeris,’ occurred on 24th August 1987, placing it even closer to the fourLondon DJs’ fabled visit to Ibiza. Was this all purely coincidental, andultimately meaningless? Or were Rampling and his friends unwittingly tappinginto a consciousness shift that was occurring at the time? According toresearchers, ’87’s Harmonic Convergence marked a 25-year lead-in to December2012 and the end of the yuga cycle measured by the famous Mayan calendar system.1990 TO INFINITYI might be inclined to opt for the less exciting explanation were it not forother factors which seem to hint at something spiritual happening at the turn ofthe decade. A number of prominent speakers have pinpointed the years 1989 and’90 as the time when they ’woke up’ to great truths. Certainly, manyworld-changing events were occurring at this time, including the break-up of theSoviet Union and its stronghold over many Communist states symbolised by the endof the Berlin Wall, plus the public revolutions in Communist China, all hintingat changing times, or even ‘a New Age.’ Most famously, David Icke has claimed tohave sensed a presence communicating with him in empty rooms in 1989, leading tohis March 1990 encounter with a psychic. Author Andy Thomas, who wrote ‘TheTruth Agenda’ and ‘Conspiracies,’ also pinpoints 1990 as a time of greatrevealing. Andy became an organiser and co-host of the Glastonbury Symposium,the UK’s leading metaphysical and consciousness conference, which itself heldits first event in 1990. There was much talk of environmental and ecologicalissues in these times, too, even in the mainstream.I seem to have had some personal experience of this shift myself, too. As 1989turned into ’90, my perceptions of life started to feel different in a waythat’s still very difficult to pinpoint. It felt as if I was tapping intosomething. In my youthful naivety, I had no idea what was happening, I just knewthat I felt ‘different.’ Had I had access to the internet at this time, and theability to connect with like-minded individuals, it might have changed theoutcome radically. At the time, the only thing I could think of in trying to getsome answers was to consult an aunt who was a devout Christian, and who seemedto have a set of answers to life’s Big Questions that others didn’t. Inevitably,she interpreted this as a calling from ‘the Lord’ and zealously inducted me intoher Evangelical church.I ended up attending for the next four years, believing I had become ‘bornagain.’ But things didn’t feel quite right throughout. The church seemed to belike a branch of Freemasonry, with different generations of the same familiesushered into positions of authority. I also saw hypocrisy in what certainmembers preached, versus how they seemed to be living their own lives, and foundit difficult to reconcile these factors with people who were supposed to be‘better’ and more moral than everyone else. By the time I left, disillusioned,I’d become a bitter atheist, lapping up the work of Richard Dawkins and thelike. It wasn’t until many years later, around 2008, that I’d started tounderstand that there was, after all, a divine creative power, and that each ofus is an individuated expression of it. This was when I came to a humbleacknowledgement of how misguided I’d been for so many years. It’s been said thatthe phrase “I was wrong – this changes everything” is one of the most empoweringof all, as it represents a letting-go of ego consciousness. It’s one which, itseems, many in this life remain highly reluctant to embrace.Many times as I’ve reflected on those years of spiritual wilderness, it’s feltto me like wasted time. But I always come back to the knowledge that everythingwe undergo happens for a reason, and our experiences here give our souls theopportunity for growth and to learn certain lessons. (See this book’s finalchapter for more on this theme.) Free Will is always present – it’s always up tous whether we choose a certain path that’s made available to us or not. (Andmany spiritual scholars will state that Free Will was even present before ourhigher selves consented to incarnate into our bodies and undergo our lifeexperiences.) Nothing is forced. Everything is consensual. So ultimately,apparent ‘mistakes’ needn’t be viewed as that. Things happen when their time hascome, and not a moment before. It seems I wasn’t ready to walk the path I’m nowon all those years ago. If I had ‘woken up’ back then, it seems unlikely that Iwould have pursued the journey as a travelling DJ, radio host and writer that Idid for the next 20 years, and that would very likely mean that these bookswouldn’t have come to be written, since I would have lacked the experiences andthe insight that has gone into them. Either way, it remains greatly intriguingfor me to now realise that I seemed to be picking up on what others were alsoexperiencing at the dawn of the 1990s.By this point, the British scene was on the cusp of fully embracing the Housemusic trends that were coming over from the US. From ’91 onwards, most musicheard in dance clubs was relatively energetic tracks of 120beats-per-minute-plus, getting more uptempo as the decade progressed. But 1990itself saw a plethora of tunes still steeped in lower tempos, many inspired bythe chugging rhythms of Soul II Soul’s output of the previous year.Additionally, some dealt lyrically – and in their overall mood and feel – withspiritual, ecological and nature-related messages, creating a fascinatingmelting pot of sounds. Were these producers also tapping into the consciousnesschanges of the time? Did these phenomena play a part in how dance and club musicevolved at that point in the timeline? British-made tracks which spring to mindin this regard include 808 State’s ‘Pacific State,’ Q-Tee’s ‘History,’ Voices OfAfrica’s ‘Hoomba Hoomba,’ Tribal House’s ‘Motherland,’ The Grid’s ‘Floatation,’Frazier Chorus’ ‘Cloud Nine,’ Plus One’s ‘It’s Happenin,’ Innocence’s ‘NaturalThing,’ MC Wildski’s ‘Wonderful World,’ Bocca Juniors’ ‘Raise,’ (featuringlyrics inspired by Aleister Crowley, reportedly,) and Nomad’s ‘Devotion.’ Thiswas also the time of Guru Josh’s ‘Infinity,’ with the tagline ‘1990’s Time forthe Guru.’ (Josh was Jersey-born musician Paul Walden who sadly died aged 51 on28th December 2015, the same day as Motorhead’s Lemmy, in what is said to havebeen a suicide.) Bassomatic’s ‘Fascinating Rhythm’ talked of the hypnotic powerof the groove and was the public’s introduction to the interestingly-namedproducer William Orbit who went on to work with Madonna.Let’s go back at this point to Wikipedia’s account of the Harmonic Convergence:“The convergence is purported to have corresponded with a great shift in theearth’s energy from warlike to peaceful. Believers of this esoteric prophecymaintain that the Harmonic Convergence ushered in a five-year period of Earth’s“cleansing,” where many of the planet’s “false structures of separation” wouldcollapse.“According to (author and artist) Jose Argüelles, the event came at the end ofthese “hell” cycles and the beginning of a new age of universal peace. Adherentsbelieved that signs indicated a “major energy shift” was about to occur, aturning point in Earth’s collective karma and dharma, and that this energy waspowerful enough to change the global perspective of man from one of conflict toone of co-operation. Actress and author Shirley MacLaine called it a “window oflight,” allowing access to higher realms of awareness.”Is it plausible that the elite controllers – obsessed as they are withmetaphysical phenomena – were aware in advance of this incoming energetic shiftand, rather than taking the chance of allowing humanity to respond in its ownnatural way, saw an opportunity to steer the change off into their owndirection, where it could be monitored, surveilled, and ultimately controlled?Given that it’s so often young people that the social engineers have in theircrosshairs, on the grounds that they’re far easier to mind-control than theirmore experienced and cynical elders, could they have moulded the worldwidephenomenon that the party scene became in their own desired fashion, introducingtheir symbolism, themes, and sound frequencies at every turn, giving theimpression that – like so many scenes before it – it had evolved organically,but with the truth of the matter telling a different story?Interestingly, the generation that was key to getting this movement established,has been directly referred to in three ways by some of dance music’s keyplayers. The Prodigy titled their second studio album ‘Music for the JiltedGeneration,’ Judge Jules for many years described his Saturday evening Radio 1show as “the noticeboard for the deranged generation,” while more recently, PaulVan Dyk’s VONYC Sessions podcast announces itself as being for “the electrifiedgeneration.” Was this also, unwittingly, a generation of lab-rats under thewatchful eye of the omniscient cultural manipulators?HAVE A NICE TRIPIn an interview on the ‘Lift The Veil’ podcast, IT specialist-turned-researcherSteve Outtrim pinpointed 1986 – the year prior to the Acid House scene’sacknowledged beginnings – as having some potentially connected significance:“One thing I’ve found very useful in my research is when you look at a timelinefor these events, and you see that Burning Man was launched in 1986, theWorldwide Web, the internet, was launched in 1986, MAPS, the association forpsychedelic studies, was launched in 1986. The Cacophony Society, which isclosely linked to both Burning Man and Project Mayhem, that was launched in1986. So you have all these cult-like groups and the internet coming out, andthen you have some of the military guys behind the internet saying, what we needis to draw people together in communities electronically.”Many will put the timing down to serendipity, or random chance. But there arefactors which suggest behind-the-scenes collusion. These include the fact thatAcid records were starting to appear out of the US at exactly the same time asthe British scene is said to have evolved by pure chance out of the legendaryLondon DJs’ jaunt in Ibiza. This observation was in fact addressed by PaulOakenfold and Pete Tong in an article titled ‘The Balearic Beat Story’ that theywrote together for ‘Mixmag’ in 1988:“The emergence of this ‘movement’ in London has coincided, quite conveniently,with the ever-increasing popularity of Acid House. Indeed, House music doesprovide a large proportion of the soundtrack at new London clubs considered tobe the pioneers of the new ‘scene.’ It was something that a year later would bemassive, thanks to what’s been called The Second Summer of Love.”Taken in isolation, many of the Acid scene’s motifs could be considered random,innocent, and devoid of any deeper meaning. Viewed in tandem with other episodesin popular culture, however, several take on added meaning. UK club flyers fromthe late 80s and early 90s have become collectors’ items, providing a snapshotof a seminal, but long-gone era in British nightlife.Among these are frequent showings of the three-pronged ‘peace’ sign oftenfavoured by anarchists, (when inverted from its original design,) and derivedfrom the sigil for the Tree Of Life. Besides the ever-present smiley yellowface, (of which, more shortly,) and a smattering of pyramids, there are severalrenderings of a single eye. Some are altogether more disturbing. A ‘Rage’ eventfrom Heaven in February 1989, presented by Fabio and Grooverider, features whatappears to be a demonic entity presiding over a planetary conjunction, aDecember 1988 event titled ‘Apocalyse Now’ shows a figure, looking like a crossbetween an evil clown and Tom Baker’s ‘Doctor Who,’ grinning maniacally whilesporting a smiley face badge. ‘Holocaust ’89’ leaves little to the imagination,showing the world going up in a mushroom cloud. Rush (gettit?) Productions’‘Satisfaction’ from November 1989 depicts the kind of hedonistic debauchery thatwould have been at home in one of Aleister Crowley’s sex magick parties. One, atleast 20 years ahead of its time, simply shows the Freemasonic all-seeing-eyeinside the capstone which appears on the back of the US dollar bill, withilluminated rays all around. A rave entitled ‘Vertigo’ shows black-and-whitechequerboard duality of the type found on the floors of Masonic temples, (alsoused as an MK-Ultra mind-control trigger design.) Some leave nothing to theimagination in showing actual demonic entities with event names like Omen. (Anda pertinent question, I feel, would be why New Atlantic chose to name the B-sideto their ‘I Know’ rave anthem, ‘Yes to Satan’ (?!) There was clearly a dark sideto the scene in contrast to the free-spirited fun which it originally espoused.Was this reflecting some of the bad MDMA trips that some were experiencing?As the 1990s dawned, however, flyers started to take on far more spiritualthemes, also reflected in the naming of this second breed of events, such asTribal Gathering, Raindance, Biology, Peacefest, Sunrise, Perception andUniverse. Themes of UFOs, aliens, ancient gods, cosmology, astrology, celestialalignments and Transhumanist future landscapes were frequently represented. Anevent called ‘Genesis’ had a depiction of the pagan god Pan as its main logo.Promoter of the Dreamscape events, the late Murray Beetson, admitted: “On themain stage, we’ve gone for a pyramid theme with a flashing eye that keepsblinking, just like on the American dollar,” when revealing the decor for his‘Dreamscape 20’ gathering.By 1989, the focus had shifted from nightclub and warehouse parties, tolarge-scale open-air gatherings known as ‘raves,’ with many of the DJs whoplayed at them, such as Judge Jules and Carl Cox, going on to enjoyinternational careers that have lasted to this day. (These two have hadlong-running syndicated radio shows entitled ‘The Global Warm-Up’ and ‘Global’respectively.) Many took place on land around the M25, the orbital motorway thatsurrounds London, (and the inspiration for the naming of brothers Phil and PaulHartnoll’s act Orbital.) In order to throw the authorities off the track, raveswould be advertised on flyers which neglected to reveal the location, butfeatured a phone number to be called on the day itself, when directions to thesite would be revealed at the last minute. These parties occurred in the veryearly days of mobile phones when handsets were still the size of bricks, andlong before the advent of sat-nav. Small cars crammed with clubbers meeting atmotorway services to compare directions and travel together in convoys, was afrequent nocturnal sight. A pirate radio ad of the time for the popular Biologybrand of raves went:“This is a Party Political Dance Broadcast on behalf of the Biology Party. Hereare the following requirements for this Saturday’s DJ Convention and gatheringof young minds. Firstly, you must have a Great Britain road atlas. Yes, that’s aGreat Britain road atlas. Secondly, a reliable motor with a full tank of gas.Lastly, you must have a ticket and you must be a member.”It would become clear when they had arrived at the location – often a farmer’sfield equipped with ranks of strobe lights, bowel-shaking speaker systems, andcircus-style attractions such as fire-eaters, stilt walkers, and exotic dancersperforming on illuminated podiums. By this stage many events had becomecorporatised, profit-hungry promoters seduced by the new financial potential,presenting ever more elaborate productions at ever-soaring ticket prices. Thedrugs remained in generous supply. Ravers from the original days began tocomplain about how the scene was already starting to lose its original,grass-roots vibe as everything became mass-market-orientated. It was far fromthe first time an exciting new culture had gone that way, and it certainlywasn’t to be the last.ENTER THE TOFFSOn the surface of it, a subversive, dynamic party scene ought to have noconnections whatsoever with the Establishment old-guard, and should stand as thevery antithesis of a Conservative government. Curiosity, therefore, comes fromthe fact that Acid House’s move out of the clubs and warehouses to large-scaleraves, was spearheaded by a small group of public schoolboys who would havelooked more at home on the floors of London’s Stock Exchange, than flittingbetween a sea of strobe lights in a field at four in the morning, mobile phonesclutched to ears.Tony Colston-Hayter, born in 1965, was the son of a university lecturer andsolicitor, and a gambling addict. He used much of the fortune he had accruedfrom casino wins to finance his moves into the party scene. His first eventsappeared at Wembley Studios in August 1988 under the brand of ‘Apocalypse Now.’Colston-Hayter invited reporters from ITV’s ‘News At Ten’ along to film theaction. This sparked a series of ‘exposés’ into Acid culture from a mainstreammedia who had previously ignored the movement altogether. The ‘Sun’ “newspaper”at first appeared to be down with the kids, its Bizarre page in October offeringa ‘groovy and cool’ Acid House T-shirt, and a fun guide to Acid House lingo tohelp readers “raise your street cred.”Within a few weeks, however, the headlines were grabbing attention for differentreasons. Exactly 100 years after tabloids were writing shock stories about themurders of Jack The Ripper, ‘The Sun’ was now running articles titled ’ShootThese Evil Acid Barons,’ ‘Ban This Killer Music,’ ‘Acid House Horror,’ and ‘DrugCrazed Acid House Fans.’ It was a modern rendering of the 1930s Americanpropaganda movie ‘Reefer Madness,’ which sought to demonise cannabis byerroneously linking it with hallucinations, violent behaviour and death. In anincident reminiscent of Radio 1 breakfast show DJ Mike Read banning Frankie GoesTo Hollywood’s ‘Relax,’ I can recall DJ Jeff Young playing D-Mob’s ‘We Call ItAcieed’ on his ‘Big Beat’ show on the same station, but prefacing it with thedisclaimer that “the BBC does not endorse drug-taking of any kind.” (Despitethis feigned moral stance, the same station had no problem with veteran DJ AnnieNightingale using the none-too-subtle slogan ‘Annie on one’ for herelectronically-fuelled dance show for some years.)Colston-Hayter was now being singled out as the Mr. Big of this scene, and wasthe latest to suffer a seemingly orchestrated smear campaign. By 1989 he hadrenamed his company Sunrise, and was staging ever-more elaborate and large-scaleevents. He hired a publicist by the name of Paul Staines, who he had met at avideo games tournament, and who described himself as ‘an anarcho-capitalist,’ tobe his right-hand man. (Staines went on to reinvent himself as the well-knownpolitical blogger Guido Fawkes.)In response to the scene’s rapid evolution, the police formed a new group whoseremit it was to clamp down on illegal organised parties, referred to as The PayParty Unit. As a UK ‘Guardian’ article on Colston-Hayter put it:“Some members of the government were dismayed that their opponents weren’tpierced-and-dreadlocked outsiders, but well-spoken right-wing entrepreneurs whostashed their profits in an offshore tax haven. A baffled Home Office officialonce screamed at Staines: “You’re a right-wing Tory, why are you doing this?”From the point of view of this book and its themes, it’s a good question!In response to police obstacles, Colston-Hayter and Staines were seen to launchtheir Freedom To Party campaign at the Conservative government’s 1989 conferencein Blackpool. In the spirit of entrepreneurialism, they presented themselves asoffering innovative solutions to public demand, implying that events such astheirs were better kept under well-organised and surveilled conditions, thanallowing them to go off haphazardly and unchecked. Eventually, the authoritieswere forced to react. Licenced clubs were granted later closing times, whilepolice continued to crack down on illegally-organised gatherings.This herding of clubbers into designated indoor spaces, where everything couldbe more closely monitored, led to the birth of what were known as the UK‘superclubs’ of the early 1990s – venues which catered specifically for thisscene. One of the first was London’s Ministry Of Sound, (of which, moreshortly.) Already of iconic status by then was Manchester’s Hacienda, operatedby the Factory Records empire under its charismatic frontman, the latejournalist-turned party maverick Tony Wilson. The Hacienda was a rare venueoutside London to have embraced the culture early on, and Factory spawned itsown Northern twist on the scene by fusing the indie-rock styles of bands such asthe Happy Mondays and Stone Roses with Acid themes, resulting in somedistinctive sounds and fashions absolutely representative of that point in time.Not far behind Ministry, meanwhile, were brands such as Liverpool’s ‘Cream,’Sheffield’s ‘Gatecrasher,’ ‘Renaissance,’ ‘Golden,’ ‘Progress,’ ‘God’s Kitchen,’‘Miss Moneypenny’s,’ ‘Karanga,’ ‘Shindig,’ ‘Fandango,’ ‘Inside Out,’ ‘TimeFlies’ and so many others. Gatecrasher marketed its prolific New Year’s Eve 1999event at Sheffield’s Don Valley Stadium with the tagline “It will always be withyou.” Maybe there was more truth to this than the ‘Crasher Kids (as the brand’sravers were known) could have realised?The prospects of promoters still seeking to organise large-scale open-air raveswere no longer so good. In 1994, the Conservative government, now under theleadership of the completely forgettable John Major, introduced its draconianCriminal Justice and Public Order Act, known more regularly as The CriminalJustice Bill. Its Section 5 included measures that appeared to take actionagainst squatters, gypsies, travellers and trespassers, (also criminalising actssuch as the disruption of fox hunts in a move that would have been ratherconvenient for the Bill’s creators,) but also encompassed noise-nuisance, in adirect targeting of the free-party/ rave scene.Demonstrating how out-of-touch the Bill’s dusty old architects were with youthculture, the wording of the section aimed at shutting down raves was much mockedby the dance music press of the time, and has now passed into legend: “Musicincludes sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of asuccession of repetitive beats.” An event which had assisted in the Bill’sacceptance was a free rave known as the Castlemorton Common Festival in May1992. The thousands of ravers and New Age travellers descending on the tranquilWorcestershire village, spurred calls for the authorities to take action againstsuch unwanted incursions. Castlemorton and similar gatherings were acontemporary reboot of the first wave of free festivals in the UK, spearheadedby the Isle of Wight Festival beginning in 1968, the Glastonbury Festival twoyears later, and the Windsor and Stonehenge festivals that followed. Theseevents were based on the counter-culture ethos of togetherness and freeexpression, and drew hippies, squatters, travellers and anarchists . . . thoughhow long they remained genuinely benevolent in their aims can be questioned,when infiltration by provocateurs inevitably occurs at such large gatherings.A user known as ‘Separ,’ who posted on a forum on these subjects on the DavidIcke website back in 2009, astutely observed:“The way I see it, it had to come across as a genuine grass-roots youth movementfor the trick to work. The police and local authorities and the populist partypolitics talk at the time, were instrumental in creating this illusion of atotally fake ‘rebellion’ movement that was out of their hands. The incrementalsteps to implementation of the New World Order agenda, is executed by people whodon’t have complete knowledge of the bigger picture, so the backlash againstraves was a quite genuine thing among the ordinary people, (including those likethe police who think they’re in control, but they’re not.) By being very publicin cracking down on raves, they gave the impression a mini-Woodstock washappening at night all over the country.“The sum effect of all this was that electronic beat-based music became widelyperceived as the new youth music, (it wasn’t so mainstream before,) and the faceof pop music was changed so that we have the situation we have today. The PowersThat Be succeeded 100%. They achieved the creation of a completely corporation-and Illuminati-controlled type of sound that the masses can vomit their lagerout to on weekends, and the youth become totally conditioned/ brainwashed thanksto amphetamine-like drugs. It’s a fake pressure-valve release that’s beenengineered to diminish the human experience and destroy the spark of divinity/spirituality in Man. It’s a Saturday happy hour to keep people’s minds off theserious business, (globalisation and the NWO), that The Powers That Be think weshouldn’t think about. It’s like a Che Guevara or Haile Selassie T-shirt:de-fanged rebellion.”[../images/00003.jpeg]James Palumbo, now the Baron of Southwark, a most unlikely candidate for boss ofthe Ministry of Sound nightclub empire.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jamespalumbocropped.jpg[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jamespalumbocropped.jpg]Credit: Maxitech03Colston-Hayter wasn’t the only public schoolboy to muscle in on the party scene.Another was Jeremy Taylor, who staged the Gatecrasher Balls, known informally as‘the teenage toff’s balls.’ Several of these were put on in the late 1980s, someat country estates like Longleat and Weston Park, and others in Central London,with the express intention of allowing public school boarders to party alongsidemembers of the opposite sex. Taylor’s co-organiser was ‘Fast’ Eddie Davenport,better known within aristocratic realms as ‘Lord’ Edward Davenport, a socialiteand property developer. He was also a convicted fraudster, receiving aseven-year jail sentence in 2011 for his part in a series of schemes that hadconned millions of pounds out of his victims.This wasn’t the last that the newspaper-reading general public heard ofColston-Hayter, either. In 2014, he pleaded guilty to being the leader of agroup which had hacked into the main computer system of Barclays Bank andembezzled £1.3 million from its funds. Still with a taste for high living, he isalso reported to have stolen the bank cards of 24,000 customers, which he usedto purchase luxury goods at Harrods and Selfridges.THE MAN FROM THE MINISTRYThe public schoolboy network cropped up to play another highly prominent part inUK clubland when the era of the UK superclubs dawned. Ministry Of Sound openedin September 1991 in a former warehouse complex in a grim corner of SouthLondon, modelling itself on New York City’s legendary Paradise Garage, whereresident DJ Larry Levan had transformed that city’s nightlife scene in the 1970sand 80s. The individual behind MoS came from an unlikely background for aclubland boss. This was James Palumbo, the grandson of an Italian immigrant whohad made his fortune in property development, and the eldest son of Baron PeterPalumbo. James himself has since taken the title of Baron Palumbo of Southwark,and is reckoned to be among the 400 richest people in Britain with an estimated£130 million fortune. (I find it bleakly amusing that narcotics kingpins whooperate in clubland are referred to as ‘drug barons,’ given Palumbo’s foraysinto the world of nightlife!) After an education at Eton and Oxford, he became aCity of London merchant banker. Palumbo Senior and Junior fell out over thealleged withholding of a trust fund, which saw the two communicate only throughlawyers for many years.Palumbo co-founded Ministry with Justin Berkmann, the son of wine aficionadoJoseph Berkmann, who acted as its artistic director and resident DJ, and wasapparently the influence behind Ministry’s modelling itself on the ParadiseGarage. Also involved was a fellow Etonian, Humphrey Waterhouse. In a newspaperinterview, Palumbo stated: “I wasn’t so interested in the dance music scene, butit was beginning to take off in Britain and the project seemed a soundcommercial proposition.”Ministry was an instant hit with clubbers, to the point that soon after opening,reports emerged of how its door staff had been infiltrated by gangland drugdealers. In a 2009 interview with the ‘Daily Mail,’ Palumbo told how he hadtaken to wearing a bulletproof jacket to work and carrying a stun gun forprotection. On the club’s early reputation as a drug den, he stated:“At the height of its popularity, ecstasy sold for £15 a pop and some clubberstook two, three or even four pills in one session. With more than 2,000 peoplein the club on a Saturday night, the drug profits were astronomical – Iestimated they totalled about £50,000 a weekend. And there wasn’t anything clubowners could do about it. Why? Because security would kill you.”Palumbo eventually fired the door staff involved and says he lived in fear ofretaliatory drive-by shootings. The club took to bussing in door staff fromBirmingham each weekend, because no crews from London would take the job.Working with police, Palumbo claimed to have eventually driven the dealers out,and boasted that Ministry was the only drug-free club in Britain. In keepingwith its cleaned-up image, he struck up an alliance with Tom Sackville, the HomeOffice minister responsible for club licensing. Palumbo recalls that: “Theresulting legislation gave the police summary powers to close drug-infestedvenues. Ministry of Sound was cited in the parliamentary debate as the exampleof best practice.”From the start, the brand’s logo was a distinctive coat-of-arms featuring whatappears to be a disco ball fashioned from a portcullis, and topped by a crown.From a standalone nightclub venue, the brand expanded to encompass record and CDcompilations, a long-running magazine, and merchandise such as bomber jackets,hats, T-shirts and record bags. The Ministry of Sound Recordings spin-off issaid to be the largest independent music company in the world, and was sold in2016 to the Sony Music Group for $104 million. Clubs have also been opened underthe Ministry franchise worldwide. The London spot itself has survived a handfulof attempts to have it either closed down in the wake of violent events, or tobe demolished to make way for urban development.Palumbo was a close associate of Tony Blair’s Labour Party kingpin ‘Lord’ PeterMandelson, (known to holiday at the Corfu home of banking tycoon Baron JacobRothschild,) and is reported to have given Mandelson the use of achauffeur-driven car for the 1997 General Election campaign. (Incidentally,Labour’s official theme for this was itself a clubbing anthem in the form of‘Things Can Only Get Better’ by the group D:Ream, the early keyboardist forwhich was one Brian Cox, who went on to become the BBC’s go-to man for allmatters connected with Astrophysics – even though most of what he spouts on suchmatters are provable lies. He’s a professor, you know. I’ll leave readers tolook up the meaning of ‘ream’ in urban slang for themselves, meanwhile.)Palumbo earned himself the nickname ‘Prince of Darkness’ in his university days,a title he shares with Mandelson. A 1997 profile in ‘The Independent’ newspaperreferred to him as “a man who is reported to have the ear of the Blairadministration on matters concerning young people.” Palumbo’s political leaningsseem complicated; having also fraternised with various Tory MPs, he is now aLiberal Democrat life peer. He ceased running Ministry several years ago, butretained a majority stake in the business.Given Palumbo’s unconventional nightlife credentials, his background, and someof the individuals with whom he is known to fraternise, a suspicious onlookermight conclude that there’s more to his establishment of London’s most prolificclub than meets the eye. Could the naming of the Ministry brand, with itsconnotations of government, have been a clue as to what it was really all about?EVERYTHING STARTS WITH AN EMy first book, 2007’s ‘Tales From The Flipside,’ is not what could be called aconscious read, written as it was when I was still in the fog of amind-controlled trance. It did, however, include some observations which remainrelevant to this day – and particularly to this story:“A big clue as to how far drug and dance culture had merged, could be seen innothing more complex than the opening times of the big dance superclubs. Asearly as 1990, like the Northern soul clubs before them, most were staying openuntil 6 or 7 in the morning where licences allowed, and were still rammed atclosing time. That much stamina from natural energy and dance-inducedadrenaline? (The same suspicions may well arise from ‘marathon’ DJ sets that arefrequently advertised. Junior Vasquez began one at New York’s Tunnel club in1995, for example, where he played non-stop from 11pm Saturday night to 2pmSunday afternoon every week!)“E-culture became an accepted part of clubbing through the 90s, and nowhere wasthis more apparent than in the pages of the UK’s most consistently popular dancemusic publication, ‘Mixmag,’ which aims at an average readership age of 18.Regular cover features with titles like . . . ’Are Drugs Driving You Mad?,’‘Jellies: The Mong-out Menace,’ ‘Ecstasy: Scared?,’ ‘Paranoid? You Should Be,’‘1993: Year Of The Trip,’ ‘The Good Comedown Guide,’ and ‘Taking The Piss: DrugTesting At Work,’ summed up the kind of lifestyle the magazine knew its readerswere into, and through which it was able to connect meaningfully with them.”And later . . . “In November 1995 the party came to an abrupt stop. Teenager Leah Betts fromEssex collapsed and died after necking a single ecstasy tablet at her 18thbirthday party . . . The DJ world has had its occasional victim, too.Liverpool’s Mark Johnson collapsed in January 1995, for instance, following agig at the city’s Voodoo club, and died shortly afterwards in hospital aged just22. He had apparently taken an E. Incredibly, in 1996 came the news thatclubbers could now take out £100,000 worth of insurance against the risk ofdying or being permanently disabled from taking ecstasy and other drugs,courtesy of a London firm, offering the deal for £15 a year – the price of anE!”[../images/00004.jpeg]One of many renderings of the pre-Acid House Smiley; as an emblem of theWatchmen graphic comic series.https://www.flickr.com/photos/dannybirchall/6391786127[https://www.flickr.com/photos/dannybirchall/6391786127]Credit: Danny BirchallTHE DARK SIDE OF THE SMILEYSA smiley yellow face has come to be regarded as the iconic emblem of the late80s scene, and synonymous with the widespread necking of ecstasy pills thataccompanied it. The face was etched into certain batches of the actual pillsthemselves, and it adorned countless flyers from that period. It was weaved intothe second ‘o’ of Danny Rampling’s Shoom night on its flyers and membershipcards, being made to look like an ecstasy pill with the slogan ‘Happy, happy,happy ... ’ Commenting on his use of the emblem, Rampling explained:“I picked up on the smiley face logo from a fashion designer called Barnsley. Iran into him one night when he was covered in these smiley face badges and Ithought, ‘Wow! That’s it!’ The smiley face completely signifies what thismovement is all about – big smiles and positivity.”An entire fashion industry grew up out of the scene, with T-shirts and hoodiesall sporting the same motif. Its history and continued usage, however, casts avery dark and unsettling shadow on the story.The symbol gained widespread usage in the American advertising industry in theearly 1970s, as society attempted to shake off the doom and depression of theongoing Vietnam War with more optimistic outlooks on life. By the mid-80s,however, some more sinister overtones were present, as it had become a centralmotif in the ‘Watchmen’ graphic novel series created by British animator AlanMoore. The stories feature a psychopathic killer known as The Comedian, alongthe lines of The Joker of the Batman stories. In the 2009 Hollywood filmversion, The Comedian sports the smiley yellow face on a badge. Just as he’sabout to get murdered he exclaims that life is just a big sadistic joke thatonly he understands. It’s a satanic and nihilistic mindset – the idea that inthe cosmic scheme of things, human life is ultimately pointless – and it’s onethat appears to lie within the doctrines of Chaos Magick. Indeed, in the openinglines of ’Onion Peelings’ from Aleister Crowley’s ‘Book of Lies,’ we find: “TheUniverse is the practical joke of the general at the expense of the particular,quoth Frater Perdurabo, and laughed.” Moore himself has admitted to being anoccultist with a fascination for the works of both Crowley and Dennis Wheatley.He has stated that he incorporated references to Crowley’s teachings in his ‘Vfor Vendetta’ story, and the first date given in ‘The Watchmen,’ 12th October,is Crowley’s birthdate.Here, we get some links back into the music industry as the spin-offs andconnections start to get out of hand, so bear with me as I dart around fromplace to place, as is necessary sometimes. Alongside the likes of WilliamBurroughs, Timothy Leary and Kenneth Grant, another artistic type who openlyespoused Chaos Magick teachings, (which involves the use of occult sigils,) wasthe musician, artist and video director Peter Christopherson, known by thenickname ‘Sleazy.’ Christopherson directed videos for artists ranging from RageAgainst The Machine to Soft Cell, (whose frontman Marc Almond was a member ofAnton La Vey’s Church Of Satan.) He was also a part of the experimental/avant-garde groups Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV alongside Genesis P-Orridge,(real name Neil Andrew Megson) and Geoff Rushton, known as John Balance.Psychic TV became active on the Acid House scene in its formative years. A sideproject was Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (sic) (known as. T.O.P.Y.,) intendedto be a magic(k)al order and a vehicle for the members’ occult ideas, and withsmiley face emblems never far from the surface. Megson was accused of sexuallyabusing children in a 1992 British TV documentary, but cleared by the subsequentpolice investigation, at which point he relocated to New York and beganespousing transgender teachings. Christopherson was also part of a design agencycalled Hipgnosis, which worked on cover art for acts such as Pink Floyd and LedZeppelin, and formed the band Coil, heavily influenced by the teachings ofCrowley. Christopherson is reported to have died in his sleep in Thailand at theage of 55 in 2010. Six years earlier, his partner Balance, (ironically,considering his name,) is said to have accidentally fallen to his death from thebalcony of the home he shared with Christopherson.Anyway, back to the smiley. A couple of years after the first ‘Watchmen’ comics,the emblem – complete with the trademark bloodstain from the series – appearedon the sleeve design to Bomb The Bass’s cut-and-paste track ‘Beat Dis.’ Bomb TheBass was the alias of DJ/ producer Tim Simenon who was born in South London onthe Summer Solstice of 1967. A more relevant date for the original ‘Summer ofLove’ would be difficult to find. A few years later, the smiley had becomeheavily associated with the DJ/ producer Norman Cook, aka Fatboy Slim. Many ofhis promotional photos show him interacting with the image in some way; in onehe has a yellow smiley bingo ball in his mouth. Cook was married for many yearsto BBC Radio 1 presenter Zoe Ball, the daughter of BBC TV children’s entertainerJohnny Ball. In more recent times, celebrities such as Miley Cyrus and SelenaGomez have been pictured sporting the smiley on their clothing. The emblem alsomakes a cameo at the very start of the video to David Bowie’s swansong ‘BlackStar,’ appearing on the spacesuit of the dead astronaut assumed to be Major Tom.‘The Watchmen’ was not the only fictional rendering of the smiley in disturbingcircumstances, meanwhile. The US police drama ‘The Mentalist,’ which ran from2008 to 2015, had a plotline involving a serial killer named Red John, whosecalling card was to leave a smiley face design at the scene of each of hismurders. It also gets a rendering in the British TV series ‘Sherlock’ starringBenedict Cumberbatch. In the first episode, Holmes gets a can of yellow paintfound at a crime scene, and uses it to spray a smiley face on his living-roomwall. It appears in every subsequent episode.The smiley face’s association with violent death in fiction, seemed toforeshadow and mimic reality in even more unsettling circumstances, meanwhile.Over the past twenty years, more than 50 young men have been abducted andmurdered in more than 25 of the US states. The crimes have come to be labelledas the Smiley Face Killings. Their geographical spread suggests they are thework of a co-ordinated group, rather than one crazed individual. The victimshave all been adult males of college age, usually athletic and high academicachievers. They are usually last seen on their way home from drinking at bars orparties. Their bodies turn up, sometimes weeks or months after they disappear,immersed in water – primarily rivers, creeks or lakes. Smiley face emblemsappear in the vicinity of the bodies, usually daubed on to trees or walls inpaint. In the case of one victim, a smiley face appeared out of nowhere on histombstone.There are signs that the co-ordination of these killings could extend beyond theUS, meanwhile. Throughout 2016 and 2017, a series of disappearances of young menoccurred across Britain in very similar circumstances, the bodies always turningup in water. The murders have attained very little by way of mainstream mediacoverage, and seem to have been treated by police as a series of random crimes,rather than a connected series. The American author and investigator WilliamRamsey has done much research into the strange aspects of these murders. Afull-length documentary is forthcoming at the time of writing; in the meantime,short videos examining the cases can be viewed on his William RamseyInvestigates YouTube channel at:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbi5KDNq7OMaptZ_JnQmlw[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbi5KDNq7OMaptZ_JnQmlw]Is there far more to the smiley face than an apparent symbol of ‘happiness?’While it may have been adopted naively at certain points along the way, is italso a deep-rooted expression of dark sigil magick at the hands of a network ofoccultists, who take regular opportunities to place it in the public eye, oftenin morbid, mocking fashion? And could its adoption by Acid House be just one ofmany such outings?OUR MAN AT THE BBCOf all the DJs who were present in the British dance music breakthrough, nonehas experienced such phenomenal levels of success as Pete Tong. From humblebeginnings as a mobile DJ, cutting his teeth on the soul and funk scene of theSouth East, Tong advanced his broadcasting career through Kent’s Invicta Radio,through three years at Capital FM, to become a favourite of the BBC. Hisearliest appearances on Radio 1 involved delivering a dance music report onPeter Powell’s daytime show from 1981, followed by some occasional shows on BBCRadio London. In January 1991, Tong was hired as the host of Radio 1’s Fridaynight ‘Essential Selection,’ and he has remained at the station ever since, nowits longest-serving presenter after Annie Nightingale. Tong was never a keyinstigator of the Acid House sound, and was absent from the big transformativeraves. But he was in the right place at the right time to become the mostrecognisable figurehead for the emerging dance music culture generally.In tandem with his DJing career, Tong has also worked as an industry executive,running the FFRR imprint of London Records, and with many other interests,investments and consultancies. As far back as the late 90s he was reported to bea millionaire. A leading dance magazine in 1999 proclaimed: “Dance music isbigger than ever, Pete Tong is bigger than God.” These days, he’s frequentlyreferred to as a ‘gatekeeper’ for the dance music scene, the status of‘Essential New Tune’ on his Radio 1 show having the power to shape an artist’sentire career, and with the word ‘legendary’ rarely being absent from hisbiographies. As a long-running radio jingle voiced by the rappers Salt ’N’ Pepaalways proclaimed: “Pete Tong got power.” But just how did he come to get somuch of it? The writer of this blog has some ideas of his own:http://anonymous-ibiza.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/pete-tong-illuminati.html[http://anonymous-ibiza.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/pete-tong-illuminati.html]Tong has stood alone in surviving every single cull of specialist DJs at Radio1; as the likes of Danny Rampling, Judge Jules, Dave Pearce, Fabio &Grooverider, Seb Fontaine, Fergie, Lottie, Tim Westwood, Gilles Peterson andTrevor Nelson have come and gone, Tong has remained immovable. He has spoken ofhow he was commissioned as a consultant by panicking Radio 1 bosses when thestation was losing street-cred in the 1990s, and it was his advice that causedthe aforementioned names to be brought on board. But Eddie Gordon, a DJ, clubmanager and music journalist from Tong’s old stomping ground of Kent, who wenton to become his manager and agent, speaks in his on-line biography of how Tonghas claimed credit for many of the achievements for which he, Gordon, was infact responsible. As he states:“On Wikipedia, though, he keeps deleting ‘his’ history, embellishing it withlies. For example, Steve Wolfe came up with the now infamous phrase “It’s allgone Pete Tong” one Sunday night at Invicta Radio during Tong’s weekly soul showwhen the studio phones all rang at the same time for tickets to a weekendercompetition. But on Tong’s history, it was Mark & Lard on Radio 1. Totalrubbish!“ ... My very important chat with my main client Jeff Young, the departing BBCRadio 1 DJ, about passing the baton on to Pete to protect the ground-breakingwork he had established on the national radio station, was indeed an essentialbit of work for Mr. Tong’s career!”In 2014, Tong attended a ceremony at Buckingham Palace to receive an MBE fromPrince William. These ‘accolades’ are given to recognise contributions toBritish culture and ways of life. Curious then, that it was given at a time whenTong had departed Britain to base himself in Los Angeles, (more on this in thefollowing chapter.)By the time of Tong’s MBE, the extent to which the dance scene that hadapparently evolved out of that small Acid House community in 1987 had changedBritish youth culture, had been reflected in the opening ceremony of the London2012 Olympics, where ravers brandishing glowsticks and adorned with luminoussmiley faces had been beamed into living rooms throughout the land.SUPERSTAR DJSAs the early scene gave way to the open-air festivals – then to the massive,purpose-built club nights – the role of the DJ morphed from that of a straightrecord-spinner and tastemaker, to an evangelist for a new movement that was asmuch a ritual for Saturday night clubbers as church the following morning wouldbe for their parents’ generation. Prior to 1987, scraping together enough of aliving to pay the rent was challenge enough for the majority of DJs. Those whospecialised in a genre, such as Soul, Hip-Hop or Reggae, were restricted toplaying small clubs, pubs or community centres for pocket money. By a decadelater, many had become millionaires, living a jet-set lifestyle previously onlyreserved for rock stars, supermodels or socialites. Although a few seem to havegot lucky by jumping on the gravy train, the majority were key players who hadbeen active during the scene’s breakthrough years and had ridden the crest ofdance music’s wave. Judge Jules joined Radio 1 from Kiss FM bringing a rapidlyascending career trajectory. Norman Cook, formerly a member of the student indieband The Housemartins, re-invented himself as a dance music producer under manydifferent aliases including Pizzaman, Beats International, Freak Power and TheMighty Dub Cats. By far the best known, however, was the Fatboy Slim personamentioned earlier, a guise under which he released a handful of successful charthits, and is now considered by many as the ultimate British superstar DJ.Of the four young Ibiza adventurers, meanwhile, Danny Rampling’s heroicreputation off the back of Shoom saw him much in demand as a DJ and beatmaker,and after some years at Kiss FM, he moved over to Radio 1 in 1994 to begin hiscelebrated ‘Love Groove Dance Party’ show. Apparently burned out, he announcedhis retirement from DJing in 2005, but a couple of years later seemed to haveregretted his hasty decision, and was right back on the circuit again.Paul Oakenfold enjoyed a secondary career as an in-demand remixer and producer,establishing his own Perfecto Records label, (whose early motif was,interestingly, a hand displaying the ‘OK’ sign, which, as discussed in Volume 1,has a secondary meaning as a rendering of the number ‘666.’) Following a periodas a much-hyped resident at Liverpool superclub Cream, and having played a DJgig on the Great Wall Of China, he relocated to the US, where he began workingon Hollywood film scores and took a residency in Las Vegas, paving the way forthat city to become a new epicentre for electronic dance music. Where Siegfried& Roy and Elvis Presley had drawn crowds before, now dance music’s titans weredoing the same. Another feather in Oakenfold’s cap was producing the theme musicfor the surveillance-normalising ‘Big Brother’ TV show back in Britain.Nicky Holloway followed The Trip with a new club venture, The Milk Bar inLondon’s Soho. He later went bankrupt and battled with alcoholism to the pointthat he was forced to attend rehab clinics. Of the four, Johnny Walker’ssubsequent career is the most subdued. He opted to leave the fast life of the DJgame to set up his own garden design business in Spain.Besides DJs and producers, the dance music explosion saw the formation of groupscapable of playing live shows and festivals – previously the domain only offully-fledged bands with instruments. In place of guitars, the new wave of actshad keyboards, synths and samplers. Names like The Prodigy, Orbital, TheChemical Brothers, Underworld, Left Field, KLF and Faithless went on to fillstadiums and sell out tours, and countries throughout Europe – then the rest ofthe world – followed the UK’s example, spawning their own electroniccommunities. The sonic landscape for the youthful generation had been changedforever.And that, presumably, was the plan."},{"pageContent":"Resources:Thump article: What Really Happened To Acid House?: * https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/luke-bainsbridge-Acid-house [https://thump.vice.com/en_us/article/luke-bainsbridge-Acid-house]The Guardian: The Birth Of Rave: An Interview with the founders of British AcidHouse culture * https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/12/electronicmusic [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/aug/12/electronicmusic]The Guardian 2008: A Second Summer of Love: * https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/electronicmusic.culture [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/electronicmusic.culture]Wikipedia: The Harmonic Convergence: * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_Convergence [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_Convergence]Danny Rampling DMC Magazine interview 2014 * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzTnrfv9nRs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzTnrfv9nRs]The Independent: Passed/Failed: An education in the life of Paul Oakenfold, DJand producer: * http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-paul-oakenfold-dj-and-producer-319036.html [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/passedfailed-an-education-in-the-life-of-paul-oakenfold-dj-and-producer-319036.html]Some classic Acid House flyers: * https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/112590059411334107/ [https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/112590059411334107/] * https://uk.pinterest.com/Rduzzi/classic-rave-flyers-and-parties-Acid-house-to-ware/ [https://uk.pinterest.com/Rduzzi/classic-rave-flyers-and-parties-Acid-house-to-ware/] * Vice.com: [http://Vice.com:] Thatcher’s War on Acid House: * https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/8gvp5x/margaret-thatcher-war-on-rave-acid-house-boys-own [https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/8gvp5x/margaret-thatcher-war-on-rave-acid-house-boys-own]The Guardian: ‘The hippie dream is still alive’: how Ibiza went from techno toboho: * https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/08/how-ibiza-went-from-techno-to-boho-aniwa-gathering [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/08/how-ibiza-went-from-techno-to-boho-aniwa-gathering]Sunrise/ Back to the Future on Wikipedia: * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise/Back_to_the_Future [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise/Back_to_the_Future]Tony Colston-Hayter: the Acid House fraudster : * https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/15/tony-colston-hayter-Acid-house-fraud-barclays [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/15/tony-colston-hayter-Acid-house-fraud-barclays]Daily Mail: How I risked my life kicking the drug gangs out of my club, byMinistry of Sound boss James Palumbo: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1195900/Bouncers-turned-club-Ministry-DRUGS--I-risked-life-drive-out.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1195900/Bouncers-turned-club-Ministry-DRUGS--I-risked-life-drive-out.html]The Independent: James Palumbo/ The Man From The Ministry: * http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-man-from-the-ministry-1291579.html [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-man-from-the-ministry-1291579.html]Thump: The Shamen’s Mr C Talks Disco Biscuits With His Old Mate Ebeneezer Goode: * https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/4xmxz3/mr-c-interviews-alter-ego-ebeneezer-goode [https://thump.vice.com/en_uk/article/4xmxz3/mr-c-interviews-alter-ego-ebeneezer-goode]Alan Moore, Freemasonry, and Aleister Crowley on Pop Culture: * https://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/06/21/alan-moore-freemasonry-and-aleister-crowley-on-pop-culture/ [https://www.veteranstoday.com/2013/06/21/alan-moore-freemasonry-and-aleister-crowley-on-pop-culture/]A Design For Life: The History of The Smiley Yellow Face: * https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2009/feb/21/smiley-face-design-history]William Ramsey Investigates: Smiley Face Symbolism in Film and Culture: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHPcCwTIt9Y [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHPcCwTIt9Y]New Dawn Films: The Smiley Face Killers – The Award Winning & HorrifyingDocumentary Feature Film: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD3c1RSLeFo [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD3c1RSLeFo]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2ELECTRONIC EVANGELISMMind control and social engineering through Electronic Dance Music.“This is where I heal my hurt, for tonight, God is a DJ . . . This is my church.”Faithless: ‘God Is A DJ’ (1998)“Take me into insanity,Yeah, dream tripping, yeah,That’s where I wanna be,That’s where I wanna be.”Oceanic: ‘Insanity’ (1991)“There’s a rainbow inside my mind,There’s a rainbow inside my mind. . . . Injected with a poison,Are you listening to me?”Praga Khan: ‘Injected With A Poison’ (1991)TRIED AND TESTEDSince the massive explosion of electronic dance music in the US – which I wouldpinpoint as happening around 2007/ 08 – all the same signs and symbols that hadpreviously cropped up in the videos, promotional pictures and stage shows of poppuppets such as Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Ke$ha, Rihanna and Beyonce – andso-called “Hip-Hop” stooges like Kanye West, Lil’ Wayne, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj,Drake and the like – were getting seen in the output of the prominent dance DJsand producers. They were all there – pyramids, all-seeing-eyes, the covering ofone eye on the face, the ‘666’ sign, the ‘Baphomet’ horned hand, black-and-whiteFreemasonic duality, dolls, teddy bears and broken mirrors, (all covered atlength in ‘Musical Truth 1’.) All are indicators as to which names are now partof the club. And it’s a safe bet that, in the majority of cases, the artistshave been instructed to flash up the signs by the director of the video or theirrecord company handler, rather than doing so through personal choice. In thecase of graphics inserted into videos, the artists would most likely beoblivious to their presence until they get to see the final cut along with therest of the public.Just as with acts such as the aforementioned – and more recently, the likes ofRobin Thicke, Bruno Mars and Justin Bieber – there are clues as to the point inthe careers of many successful dance music names where they were given a helpinghand up the ladder of success by those that can make these things happen. Fromthat point on, their careers went stratospheric.Many commentators have found it intriguing how French DJ-turned-producer DavidGuetta grafted away on the Paris club scene for many, many years, until – veryquickly – he started working with artists such as Akon, Kelly Rowland, Rihanna,Chris Brown, Lil’ Wayne, Snoop Dogg, Nicki Minaj and Usher, scoringinternational smash hits with every one. Guetta became arguably the mostprominent DJ/ producer in the EDM field at the time the corporations werebeginning to combine House music productions with vocalists from the R&B/Hip-Hop scene, creating a homogenised sound for the commercial market as aresult. (‘EDM’ is recognised as a genre in its own right, its boombastic, ‘bigroom’ sound characterised by the likes of Guetta, Calvin Harris, Swedish HouseMafia, Steve Aoki and Afrojack, and is distinct from ’electronic dancemusic’ – an umbrella term that encompasses everything from Hard House andTechno, through Trance, Drum & Bass, Dubstep and Garage. In short, any musicmade with a club dancefloor in mind. Other key players in the EDM transitionhave included Avicii, Tiesto, Armin Van Buuren, Chucky and Will.i.am.)The video for Guetta’s ‘Who’s That Chick,’ featuring Rihanna, is an A-to-Z ofIlluminati symbolism, featuring everything from Monarch butterflies topentagrams to Transhumanist overtones, (with the vocals all drenched in theabominable Auto-Tune to complete the effect.) Few videos manage to cram as muchoccult imagery into four minutes. Guetta took to pushing a highly Messianicimage at the time of his career blast-off. Sporting long hair and a beard, hewould frequently appear on stage illuminated, and holding out his hands in aChrist-like pose. DJs had gone from straight record-spinners to quasi-religiousleaders, controlling the spiritual and conscious state of the assembled throngfrom their vantage point of DJ booth-turned altar. The group Faithless seemed tohave pre-ordained this phenomenon back in 1998 with their track ‘God Is a DJ.’Talking when he guested on my ‘Good Vibrations’ podcast in 2015, Irish DJ/producer and host of Alchemy Radio, John Gibbons, observed:“It is a form of control in a sense, in that you are – through your actions orthrough the music that you play or make – able to manipulate a crowd or a massbody of people, according to what you want them to do or how you want them tofeel. So if you have nefarious aims – or if you have good aims – you cantransfer that to a large, large body of people.”And on the sudden success of certain key players:“Now, the big stars are starting to appear overnight in dance music, which neverhappened. You could always chart a DJ’s or a producer’s career, and they startedoff at a smaller level, and they’d work their way up the ladder. And it wasalmost like the last bastion in popular music that had remained organic. You’reseeing huge numbers of really, really young DJs and producers just appearingovernight.”Dutch producer / DJ Martin Garrix, (real name Martijn Gerard Garritsen,) is agreat example of this process. Apparently mentored by Dutch EDM titan Tiesto,Garrix’s single ‘Animals’ appeared in 2013, immediately shooting to the top ofthe charts in several countries, becoming a worldwide dancefloor smash, andmaking him the youngest person to ever reach the number one spot onBeatport . . . all at the tender age of 17. In 2016, Garrix topped the ‘DJMagazine’ Top 100 DJs poll, (widely considered the ultimate arbiter of a DJ’ssuccess,) beating many long-established veterans old enough to be hisgrandfather. The same year, he changed his logo from one simply rendering hisname in a scrawl, to one featuring a Greek cross and a saltire.Honestly . . . how many teenagers make it that big that quickly just throughworking really hard and keeping their fingers crossed for good luck?It was a similar scenario with another Martin. As his accompanying promotionalblurb admitted:“Martin Jensen has become one of Danish music’s greatest viral success stories,with more than 3 million likes on his Facebook page, and a staggering 600million views on his videos so far! He appeared out of nowhere in the beginningof 2015 ... His next massive single, ‘Solo Dance,’ has already entered UKShazam’s Top 200 within minutes!”As John Gibbons adds:“ ... It comes down to contacts in a lot of cases, and if you can be introducedto the right person at an early age, well then, you’re far more likely tosucceed. And within music, that’s much, much easier, because there’s no rawtalent needed within the music industry any more. Absolutely none! It doesn’tmatter if you don’t have a singing voice, if you can’t produce a track, if youdon’t know how to DJ. All of that can be done for you. You can be put on stageand you can “rock that crowd,” no problem. Paris Hilton is a DJ! And that sayseverything you need to know about how easy it is to become a DJ now in thetechnological age. There are hugely talented and skilful DJs out there – loadsand loads of them. However, for the guys who are in that final one per-cent,whether they have talent or not is actually irrelevant.“Why are we seeing so many Swedes and so many Dutch emerging in dance music?Yes, there’s a work ethic that doesn’t exist elsewhere in the world, and we seethat throughout business with regard to the Swedes and the Dutch. However, thereare also well-connected schools of people ... I mean, everybody at the higherlevel of dance music from Holland seems to now be based in LA ... Everyone isstarting to reside over there, and it’s not just because it’s a good base forgigs or whatever, it’s because that’s where the strings are being pulled from.And of course, it’s beneficial to have your artists close at hand – much easierto control.”(Paris Hilton, incidentally, fits the model of Monarch Programming mind-controlsubject down to a tee. See Vigilant Citizen’s many articles on this sub-divisionof MK-Ultra and its connections to the world of celebrity athttp://www.vigilantcitizen.com [http://www.vigilantcitizen.com])SIGNS OF THE TIMESBesides the videos, with some dance music producer and DJ icons, clues as to theset they may now belong to can be found in the vector logos which they use topromote themselves; whenever they appear on an event poster or festival line-up,their name is rendered in this way. Carl Cox, for example, now employs a logowhich looks similar to two winged sun disks of Egyptian mythology, usually inblack and white with red edges. (From his beginnings in Soul and Funk, movingthrough the Rave scene, it was through his embracing of Techno that Cox made aninternational name for himself. This is a genre which has contained more than afew subliminal hints at Transhumanism. Cox’s landmark album, ‘F.A.C.T,’ standsfor Future Alliance of Communication and Technology.) The capital ‘A’ ofAfrojack’s logo appears very similar to a pyramid, as do the two capital ‘A’s inboth Paul Oakenfold and Calvin Harris’ official branding. (A separate frequentrendering of Harris sees him wearing mirrored sunglasses – another motifassociated with mind-control programming.) The three blobs of Swedish HouseMafia’s motif look like a combination of fingerprints and bullet holes.Armin Van Buuren’s personal logo seems straightforward enough. But the twoversions used for his A State of Trance brand have strong Saturn overtones. (‘AState Of Trance’ has two meanings, of course – as well as implying a trance-likecondition, it can also be taken to mean a nation state placed under theinfluence of a trance. Is this a subtle clue as to the music’s true purpose? Andwasn’t ‘Trance’ an interesting name to be adopted for that genre in the firstplace, given its power to affect the consciousness of large numbers of people?)Armin’s artist pseudonym, under which he has released tracks with collaboratorBenno De Goeij, is Gaia, the name of the Mother Goddess of Greek mythology.Swedish producer Axwell’s image bears more than a passing resemblance to aninversion of the United Nations logo, featuring a capital A (pyramid?) inside anupside-down heart surrounded by two olive branches, while Tiesto’s is aphoenix-like bird rising in flight, with three notches carved into the top partof the ‘e’.One of the graphics used by French duo Daft Punk, shows two cyborg headsconnected by a chaotic tangle of wires. Transhumanism 101. From the start,Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter have dressed in robotic garbwith inhuman-sounding vocals to match, (very much in the style of German synthpioneers Kraftwerk before them,) and frequently perform inside a giant pyramid.More of the same now occurs with dance music’s big brands in the events field.Few can top the designs for Electric Daisy Carnival which now runs severalevents around the world, including a UK one in MK, (Milton Keynes, not Ultra.)This has an owl as its central motif – a bird that has many associations withthe occult, mysticism, the underworld and the keeping of secrets, and onepopular among musicians. Drake, Justin Bieber and Skylar Grey all sport owltattoos. The logo for Mexico City’s Orus Fest shows a giant pyramid hoveringlike a UFO over the Bermuda Triangle, complete with engraved sigils and aMasonic all-seeing eye, (nothing to see here, please move along.) Other eventswith artwork which raises more questions than answers include the AustralianBabylon, with its dystopian future designs and ‘A New World Is Coming’subheading, Alfa Future People, merging mysticism with Transhumanism and acouple of globes, and Denver’s annual Brainwash With Beats event, which prettymuch speaks for itself. (Denver Airport, incidentally, is an interesting placeto research in itself while we’re talking about Illuminati and New World Ordersymbolism, as this Vigilant Citizen articlereveals – http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-the-denver-international-airport[http://vigilantcitizen.com/sinistersites/sinister-sites-the-denver-international-airport].FINGERPRINTS OF THE SPOOKSLike Guetta, Paul Van Dyk is another interesting DJ/ producer to examine. Fromhis early years carving out a name for himself in his home city of Berlin, VanDyk, (real name Matthias Paul,) gained international prominence off the back ofhis track ‘For An Angel,’ which remains a staple club classic to this day. Hehas always been notable for his apparent abstention from the drug-taking habitsof many of his DJ peers, quipping once when asked about the spelling of his namethat “there’s no E in Paul Van Dyk.” Although international gigs and regularalbum releases followed, towards the end of the 2000s, his career seemed to takeanother jump of several notches up the ladder of success. He topped the ‘DJMagazine’ Top 100 DJs poll for two years running, and his solo shows – where he‘creates’ tracks live besides playing recordings – now take place in massivearenas, sports halls and live music venues with tens of thousands in attendance.He was absent from the scene for over three months in early 2016, afterapparently falling from rigging at an A State Of Trance gig in the Netherlands,and suffering concussion and broken ribs. After a long period ofhospitalisation, Van Dyk returned to touring in June of that year. A few monthslater, he wed his Colombian girlfriend in what was his second marriage. He iswell-known for his apparent interest in political issues, having named one ofhis albums ‘The Politics Of Dancing.’Van Dyk has been pictured throwing up the ‘horned hand’ sign at many gigs – agesture which is innocently written off as meaning ‘I love you,’ but which holdsa different meaning among dark occultists, where it represents the entity knownas Baphomet, (see ‘Musical Truth 1’ and many of the articles athttp://www.vigilantcitizen.com [http://www.vigilantcitizen.com].) For severalyears, Van Dyk has employed a very striking sigil in his promotional artwork,and colossally-sized projections of it are shown above him at events. Thisappears as an inverted triangle, apex pointing downwards, with two smallertriangles – or pyramids – fashioned into the upper corners. To promote his‘Evolution’ album, the sigil appeared as a crop circle design in a large field.I puzzled for months over the meaning of this emblem, always drawing a blank. Ithen stumbled across the official logo which the British Military Intelligenceorganisation MI5 used from the 1950s to the 1970s. When Van Dyk’s triangle isturned upwards so the apex is pointing to the sky, it takes on a strikingsimilarity to the MI5 sigil, complete with the cut-out corners. (The MI5 logoadds a capstone with an all-seeing eye inside for good measure.)[../images/00005.jpeg]From humble beginnings in warehouses and fields, to a colossal worldwidephenomenon in youth culture. Can such a movement really happen organically andunder its own steam?https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Colombian_Party_Cartel._Photo_by_Ellen_Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez_for_Colombian_Party_Cartel.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c7/Colombian_Party_Cartel._Photo_by_Ellen_Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez_for_Colombian_Party_Cartel.jpg]Credit: Ellen OrdonezBut it doesn’t end there! The artwork advertising Japanese DJ/ producer SteveAoki’s ‘3oki’ project in 2014 – which saw him releasing three recordings overthree weeks, (a Masonic 33?) – featured his profile inside the exact samepyramid employed by MI5 decades earlier, complete with the capstone and eye, andgiving off rays of illumination. What possible connection should there bebetween an antiquated emblem for British Intelligence, and those used to promotea German and a Japanese dance music producer, unless all three components aresomehow tied to the same agenda, and we profane ones are being given subtleclues so it’s not as if we weren’t, in some way, told?Although they at first appear to be widely unrelated, the worlds ofmilitary-intelligence and the rituals of the dark occult are often interlinked,and where you find one you find the other. Intel agencies are not just aboutkeeping secrets on matters of spying and surveillance, but also sequesteringinformation on an occult basis, which those controlling things wish to keepaccessible to only a chosen few. Ceremonial magic(k)ian Aleister Crowley workedfor British intelligence services during both world wars, and many researchersclaim his main contact for a period was James Bond author Ian Fleming, who was anaval commander. Lt. Colonel Michael Aquino, meanwhile, held key positions inthe US military at the same time as establishing his own Church of Satanspin-off, the Temple of Set. And a common factor binding these two worlds ismind-altering drugs. These have been used by the intel community for socialexperimentation on countless occasions, and are a staple part of many occultrituals, bringing about desired energetic shifts through having the participantsreach chemically-fuelled altered states of consciousness.Reflecting on the weaponisation of compounds that could be used for spiritualupliftment if taken in the right circumstances – but which bring more nefariousresults when their consumption is on the terms of malevolentexperimenters – author and researcher John Vibes commented:“Psychedelics are tools that can be used for good or bad, depending on thedirection and intent. The negative aspects of psychedelic use and psychedelicculture come from a lack of education. And I think people who do get positiveexperiences from these substances have somewhat of a responsibility to educatenewcomers. That definitely didn’t happen in the 60s, and it’s sadly nothappening in rave culture today.”The titles of the dance events and festivals at which Van Dyk has been aheadliner in recent years are interesting in themselves. The likes of Dreamstatein California, Trance Nation and Luminosity in the Netherlands, VelvetHypnotized in Bali, Atlantis in Australia, Spring Awakening in Chicago, Awake inDresden, Awakening Fridays in LA, Dream Beach in Spain and Delirium Eternity inArgentina, all have spiritual and esoteric overtones. Electronic Family, DigitalSociety and Toronto’s Digital Dreams all hint at electronic ways of doing thingsbeing the new norm for humanity, while Tomorrow World in Atlanta, Tomorrowlandin Belgium, Future Music Festival in Australia and New Horizons in Jakarta allevoke the Futurist society which is known to be in the plans of the UnitedNations Agenda 2030 architects. The wording of the events Global Dance andGlobal Clubbing Nation speak for themselves.Let’s not forget Miami’s Ultra Festival (as in MK?) And could Van Dyk’s ownevent brand, We Are One, be taken as a subliminal reference to a one-worldgovernment? In 2017, Van Dyk began dropping references to ETs and aliens intohis Tweets, a picture from one of his events featuring an inflatableRoswell-style ‘grey’ among the gathered throng. Additionally, phrases such as“welcome to the future” and “this is the future” began appearing in thepromotional blurb for his upcoming gigs. Why has the song lyric “and I see yourtrue colours shining through” just popped into my head?THE STRANGE APPEAL OF LA LA LANDThe Disco music which gave birth to Soulful House emerged largely out of NewYork and San Francisco. Much credit for the ushering-in of the former’s scenehas been given to the invitation-only parties hosted by David Mancuso in hisBroadway apartment, known as the Loft. The first of these was on Valentine’s Day1970, and was titled Love Saves the Day, (where have I come across thoseinitials before??) Mancuso’s Loft sessions also seem to have operated as somekind of communal living experiment, and he turns out to have had an associationwith the omnipresent Dr. Timothy Leary. As Tim Lawrence, author of the book‘Love Saves the Day: A History of American Dance Music Culture, 1970–1979’writes:“The psychedelic guru Timothy Leary, who invited David to his house parties andpopularised a philosophy around the psychedelic experience that would inform theway records were selected at the Loft, was another echo that resonated at theBroadway Loft. Co-existing with Leary, the civil rights, the gay liberation,feminist and the anti-war movements of the 1960s were manifest in theegalitarian, rainbow coalition, come-as-you-are ethos of the Loft.”As the years progressed, House music styles began emerging from Chicago, withTechno from Detroit, and Go-Go Funk from Washington DC. The genre which has cometo be known as EDM, meanwhile, migrated from Europe directly to Los Angeles. AsJohn Gibbons pointed out, many dance music artists, producers and DJs have movedthere to be at the heart of the action. We’re back to veteran BBC asset PeteTong, who now pre-records his weekly show for Radio 1 remotely. As notedpreviously, Tong’s career as a radio and club DJ went stratospheric followinghis LA relocation, well into his fifties. He scored a new show on the iHeartRadio network syndicated all over the US, along with headline slots at theworld’s major dance music festivals. As the biography on his official websiteputs it:“Having spent the majority of his life in England, Pete has recently resettledin Los Angeles to begin a new chapter in his life: ‘The electronic dance musicscene in the USA has reached a critical mass, and the opportunities for ourworld are taking us into uncharted territory. I feel now it’s essential to be inthe middle of all that.’ Tong has wasted little time in establishing himself inthe US, having helped inaugurate Clear Channel Entertainment’s Evolution dancebrand in 2013, and recently expanding the programming to the extended two-hoursegment, ‘The Evolution Beatport Show with Pete Tong,’ broadcasting on 90different Top 40 stations in the US.”Tong is frequently cited as an “ambassador” to dance music, and few individualshave wielded such influence and corporate control over the genre. Hisco-founding of the William Morris Electronic booking agency sees him presidingover, in his biography’s words, “one of the most powerful booking agencies inthe world.”(In a bizarre, but probably entirely unrelated story, meanwhile, in 2011 Tonghad to take out a restraining order against Shara Nelson, the vocalist onMassive Attack’s evergreen ‘Unfinished Sympathy,’ after he demonstrated to acourt that she had been systematically stalking him, telling his colleagues thatshe was his wife, his manager and the mother of his child!)For a time in the late 2000s, Tong staged a number of events under the brandWonderland, (Wonderland Avenue is one of the key routes through LA’s fabledLaurel Canyon district.) A handful of recent gig photos show him sporting aMickey Mouse T-shirt. As detailed in the previous book, the Mickey Mouse emblemis used as a symbol for the presence of mind-control. Pictures also exist of himwearing shirts in the black-and-white checker designs detailed elsewhere. Tong’sTwitter page describes him as ‘the Pied Piper of Dance,’ which is an interestingchoice of phrase given that the Pied Piper of the famous folk tale led acommunity’s children away from their parents by placing them in a trance throughmusic. As the late author Dave McGowan pointed out, Laurel Canyon had been a keylocation for the characters who shaped the music and mindsets of thecounter-culture in the late 1960s. A couple of generations on, the same city’sdistricts have become the setting for another big social shift.Emily Moyer is a researcher, and co-host of the ‘Off Planet’ TV and radio showsin California, as well as a veteran raver and club dancer. The Pied Piper-likelure of her hometown, she says, comes as no great surprise. There are aspects tothe city which get missed in the dazzle of its glossy sheen and perfecttoothpaste smiles.“There is something very different about Los Angeles ... It became clear thatwhat had been going on in Laurel Canyon specifically, was being mirrored inthese underground dance parties that I would go to in Downtown Los Angeles, andthen being amplified at these larger clubs and festivals, in the same way theywere being amplified at Woodstock and the festivals they were having in the 70s.“One of the things about Los Angeles is there’s a massive, massive undergroundstructure complex. I personally think there is a complete other world underneathLos Angeles county. There are lots of canyons in LA that all have very strangesub-cultures – not bad necessarily, but their own unique sub-cultures living inthem. There’s Laurel Canyon, there’s Topanga Canyon, there’s Coldwater Canyon,several of them. I think these provide particularly unique opportunities toexperiment within an enclosed location, a little private community.“But also, I think there’s something going on with frequencies in these places,because when you’re in any of them, there’s no cell phone reception. And whenyou think, Los Angeles is a huge city with lots of people living there, theywould have figured something out about that by now. But they’re trying to useother kinds of frequencies to affect people’s minds, and they wouldn’t want themto be interfered with by anything.“And then theres what’s going on with some of these warehouse parties. I go tothese, and some of them are very high-quality events. And I’ve noticed over theyears that we’re being observed. These are smaller events with everyone in oneroom. It’s the perfect environment to go and see how people respond to certainfrequencies, to experiment with the use of psychotronic weaponry. Some of theseevents are geared around having really amazing sound systems and really amazingvisual shows. These affect people in a particular way. And if people areinterested in how to use these to accomplish a goal, they can just go andobserve these events and watch how people behave when certain stimulants areintroduced.“So you have 100 people in a room all being pounded by a bath of sound andlight. Which can be pleasurable, but it can also be dangerous. The differencebetween dance music and all other forms, is that it is completely based indifferent layers of frequency.“There’s a reason why they’re so interested in this music. We know that soundand light can be used for healing, but it can also be used for control ... Youcan have a transformative experience from this sort of music and scene, but ifwe don’t take ownership of this, then you’re going to have the kind oftransformative experience that they want you to have. That delivers you into aNew World Order of sorts.“Or are we going to take control of this and become completely aware of what’sgoing on in our scene and in the world, and use our transformative experience tohelp change the world? Which one is it going to be? It’s time to decide.”BURNS NIGHTAn event with possibly more occult overtones and a more unusual air than any ofthe others, is the annual Burning Man Festival. This occurs each Labor Dayweekend at the specially-constructed Black Rock City in the Nevada desert. Thisis former, (or is that “former”?) military-owned land with restricted airspace,four hours’ drive from the next town. (A number of early British raves also tookplace on government or military-owned land – you know, because the Establishmentcare about us and just want us all to have fun.)Although it’s primarily billed as an ‘arts’ festival, music acts do perform atBurning Man, and names from the dance world in recent years have included CarlCox, Skrillex, Tiesto and Diplo. Its climax sees the giant effigy of a human seton fire, in a scene which puts me in mind of both 1973’s unsettling Britishhorror movie ‘The Wicker Man,’ and the Cremation of Care ceremony conducted atthe annual ‘elite’ meeting at California’s Bohemian Grove.Steve Outtrim is a New Zealand IT professional who spent some time working inCalifornia’s Silicon Valley. He is the proprietor of http://www.burners.me[http://www.burners.me], the largest independent website discussing Burning Manand the shenanigans surrounding it. Steve states that, within the computer andtech industry, it is almost an expectation that its key players will attend.“The first I heard of it was from the ‘Hot Wired’ mailing list, and then ‘Wired’magazine put it on the cover. I was in a meeting in Sydney in about 1997, withquite a high-level executive from SUN Micro Systems, a big computer company spunout of the Stanford University Network, just like Google. And back in the daythey were a major military and defence contractor, and this guy, the chiefscience officer, said, hey, do you go to Burning Man? He was a guy in his 60s,highly respected, a guy that’s met presidents and prime ministers all over theworld, and I’m like, wow, he knows about Burning Man? What’s going on with thisthing? I have to go!“I first went in 1998. Once you’ve been there more than ten times, you start tolook at things a little differently as the initial novelty starts to wear off. Istarted my blog as a huge Burning Man enthusiast, but as I did more and moreresearch about what’s really going on there – the organisation behind it, theoccult elements, the military/ government elements – I became a little bit morecynical.”California’s IT industry, in fact, has many throwbacks to the counter-culturescene of the 1960s. Many of that era’s hippies went on to found or join techcompanies, the idea being that they took some of the maverick free spirit ethosthat earlier scene had spawned with them. As ever, there seems to be rather moreto the story. ‘Cybernetics,’ a name for the early computer industry, was a majorcomponent in the series of Macy Conferences which took place at variouslocations in New York from the 1940s, where ‘elite’ social scientists,psychologists, anthropologists and propagandists gathered to plan the futureshaping of culture. The Cybernetics concept was an early forerunner of today’sTranshumanist movement, being planned decades in advance.Steve has guested a handful of times on the Gnostic Media podcasts to give histake on the mind-control significance of Burning Man.

Pete Tong followed inthe wake of fellow Radio 1 broadcaster Annie Nightingale, who had picked up hersback in 2002. Old-guard reggae legend David Rodigan became ‘Sir David’ two yearsbefore. (Rodigan is the son of an Army sergeant-major, in yet another militaryfamily connection to the world of music, and was a stage actor before his DJingactivities took off.) Tong and Rodigan have both inducted their offspring intothe DJ game. Becky Tong is now a spinner and record promoter, while Jamie andOliver Rodigan now perform as beat-makers, the latter under the name Cadenza.Notting Hill Carnival mainstay Norman Jay got his MBE in 2002, as did BBC Radio2 and 1Xtra veteran Trevor Nelson. Soul II Soul pioneer Jazzie B picked up hisOBE in 2008. Graffiti artist-turned Drum & Bass hero Goldie accepted an MBE inthe 2016 New Year’s Honours, in an act that appears to fly in the face of therebellious, edgy image he had always projected, (although he later threatened tomelt it down in protest at Islington Council’s decision to shut down seminalLondon nightclub Fabric. But didn’t.)This process is not exclusive to the UK, either; Dutch Trance DJ-turned-producerTiesto was appointed Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau, (the formal name forthe Netherland’s order of chivalry,) by Queen Beatrix of Holland in 2004. FellowDutch DJ Chuckie, who originally hails from Suriname, was made a Commander inthe Order of the Yellow Star by that nation’s president. Another Dutchman, ArminVan Buuren, was hired to perform at the 2013 coronation of Willem-Alexander, theking of the Netherlands, with the royal family appearing on stage to shake handswith him.Commenting on this phenomenon on ‘Good Vibrations,’ John Gibbons observed:“There was nobody being handed MBEs and OBEs and honours and Sirs andknighthoods, and this, that and the other back in the early days. Why? Well,because I think these honours are handed out in recognition of a job that hasbeen well done for the control system. I don’t think that those who receive thehonours – in the vast majority of cases – are in any way cognisant of that beingthe case. And if you look at the symbolism behind some of these honours ... Agood example are US military honours, the Medal of Valor. The symbolism, ifanyone cares to delve into that – basically, it is the control system occultistsmocking those that they are supposedly honouring, and it’s their way of saying,‘well, we own you, we control you, you’re our dogs in the street and you havedone our bidding.’ And the people accepting these honours don’t know that that’swhat’s going on.“Look at the police. It’s the most in-your-face one. Look at what they’rewearing. Why do police forces all over the world use the same symbolism? Why dowe see the chequerboard floor, which represents base consciousness, if anyonecares to delve into the mystery schools – Freemasonry, Rosicrucianism? The hatwhich is covering up the crown chakra, or the ‘third eye,’ that symbol ofconsciousness – that’s a form of occult mockery! It’s saying, ‘we have you shutdown to the base level whereby you do our bidding.’ And then look at what it isthe police are asked to do on a daily basis. Well, it all suddenly makes sensewhen you look at that with any kind of rational mindset. It’s not because thesepatterns look pretty. They’re there for a reason.”For an advanced study on the occult mockery of the police, military and othergovernment-employed personnel, a thorough absorbing of Mark Passio’scomprehensive video presentation comes highly recommended.

Whereas those early days spawned cottageindustries – with mavericks expressing themselves in activities from flyerdesigns to T-shirt fashions – the current situation echoes the consolidation nowpresent in all areas of business. A great British example comes from the radiostation Kiss FM. Originally appearing as an ‘illegal’ pirate in South London in1985, under the helm of its visionary head Gordon MacNamee, the operationassembled a team of DJs passionate about communicating their love of Soul,Reggae and Hip-Hop, and frustrated at the lack of legal opportunities to do so.Voluntarily coming off air on New Year’s Eve 1988, the station beat severalothers in its bid to obtain a legal licence from the British government’s RadioAuthority, and began broadcasting as Kiss 100FM on 1st September 1990. For itsfirst few years, Kiss retained its original ethos and generated a largelistening base. Inevitably, this attracted the attention of the corporate world,which wants to steer and control anything which achieves success under its ownsteam.The publishing conglomerate EMAP took control of Kiss, resulting in itsrebranding in 1998, and the departure of MacNamee as its managing director. Theoutput had moved away from authentic black music to more commercially-viabledance styles. Kiss operations were relocated from its Holloway Road home toEMAP’s corporate HQ in Central London. Radio stations in other UK regions weresubsequently branded with the Kiss name and shared syndicated programming.Kiss’s listening app is referred to as the Kiss Kube, which becomes interestingwhen you factor in that Saturn – a favourite emblem of the satanic controlsystem – is frequently symbolised by a cube.Further consolidation followed, to the point that the various facets of the Kissoperation are now owned by the collossally-sized Hamburg-based Bauer MediaGroup. (Bauer was the original name of the Rothschild banking dynasty back inGermany, as a matter of interest, before Mayer Amschel Bauer created the newfamily name.)From a free-spirited local labour of love, to an asset on a German corporatebalance sheet. Just another day at the office.ABSOLUTE POWERAs explored in my ‘Good Vibrations’ episode on the subject, there are parallelsbetween comments made by John Todd in the 1970s, and the contemporary status ofelectronic dance music. Todd, (also known as John Todd Collins and as Lance,)hailed from a long-running family of witches, and was ushered into prominentpositions in the US music industry. Famously – and at great risk to himself – hebroke ranks, became a born-again Christian, and recorded a now-legendarymonologue in which he detailed some of the dark occult practices routinelyemployed by the corporations, (covered in Chapter 17 of ‘Musical Truth 1.’) Hestated that Zodiac Productions, of which he was general manager, was then thelargest music conglomerate in the world, owning RCA, Columbia, Motown, andalmost all the concert-booking agencies in the United States. In turn, Zodiac issaid to have had ties to Chase Manhattan, Standard Oil and Lloyds of London.[../images/00006.jpeg]Canada’s Joel Zimmerman, performing as the EDM titan Deadmau5.

This operation emerged out of bankruptcy at the endof 2016 to become Lifestyle Inc., under the leadership of former AEG Live chiefexecutive Randy Phillips. Prior to this, however, SFX described itself on itswebsite as follows:“SFX Entertainment Inc. is the largest global producer of live events anddigital entertainment content focused exclusively on electronic music culture(EMC) and other world-class festivals. SFX’s mission is to provide electronicmusic fans with the best possible live experiences, music discovery, media anddigital connectivity. SFX was borne out of the technology revolution, andproduces and promotes a growing portfolio of live events that includes leadingbrands such as Tomorrowland, TomorrowWorld, Mysteryland, Sensation, Stereosonic,Electric Zoo, Disco Donnie Presents, Life in Color, Rock in Rio, Nature One,Mayday, Decibel, Q-Dance and React Presents, as well as the innovative ticketingservice Flavorus. SFX also operates Beatport, the principal online resource forEMC DJs, and a trusted destination for the growing EMC community to discover andstream music, follow DJs and keep abreast of news, information and events, inaddition to offering year-round entertainment to EMC fans around the globethrough other digital assets.”As Emily Moyer observed during SFX’s final weeks:“So, here you have control of everything. And the guy who owns SFX Entertainmentis Robert Sillerman. And this is what he does. Earlier in the 2000s he went andbought up a load of different concert companies, sold them to Clear Channel, anddid the same kind of consolidation. But this is what he had to say about hiscompany – ‘I know nothing about EDM,’ Sillerman told Billboard in September2012. ‘I really don’t. Of course, I listen to it and I understand its appeal.It’s borderless, it’s free, it’s energetic, it’s a party in your mind, and Iunderstand that. But I sit in the meetings and I meet the people whose placeswe’re buying. And I haven’t a fucking clue what they do or what they’re talkingabout. Not a clue. And I love it. I just love it.’“And to me, that is just disgusting. And while he may not be the kind of evilhand we’re talking about, he’s the kind of tool that the controllers need to gethold of this whole situation.“So they own all of these festivals which used to be owned by individualpromoters, who ostensibly at one point, had control over their events. Sillermannow owns all of that. He owns the ticketing service that you buy all the ticketsto the events from. So they’re able to monitor and surveil you from the time youstart looking into buying the tickets, to the time you go to the festivals.“This article that I was quoting from was also talking about how they hadacquired something called Periscope, which provides merchandise for these kindsof events, and sells at any place that those people who like electronic musicculture would buy merchandise. So you have the front end and the back end.“And the most disturbing thing, I would say, is you have the ownership ofBeatport, which is an on-line mp3 record store which almost all DJs buy the bulkof their music from because it has the largest catalogue, it’s centralised, andyou can store the stuff there. They often have Beatport stages at these eventsusing their own technologies. So you have the centralisation of the music. Andthis happened when DJs went from playing vinyl records to playing mp3s off theircomputers.”(The irony of a periscope being a device for covert below-the-radar spying isnot lost on me, incidentally!)“I would suggest that ... not only is there something happening with thefrequencies being changed, but that this provides the perfect avenue to put a‘spell,’ or a charge on every single piece of music that comes through there. Itwould not surprise me if tracks – when they’re taken from independent labels tobe sold through Beatport – are being run through some kind of technology,similar to what John Todd was taking about regarding putting a hex on the mastertapes of recordings. I would suggest that there’s technology now where they cando the same thing. I think it’s entirely possible that information is beingembedded in these frequencies, and maybe even visual images being piggy-backedon the sound frequencies.”This reverts back to the other part of what Todd talked about regarding his timein the music industry. It was standard practice, he said, for the master tapesof a new recording to be brought to the ‘temple room’ which each of the majorcorporations had within their headquarters. A coven of witches would be broughtin to place a spell on it, the idea being that each copy then taken from themaster and sent out into the general public, would be imbued with the signaturedark energy of the original, because everything happens on an unseen, frequencylevel.It seems the practice may not have died out with that decade, either. In a 2014interview with host Popeye on his ‘Down The Rabbit Hole’ radio show, FrankCastle of the Hip-Hop/ Rock fusion act HeistClick, revealed that he had seen asimilar room in a modern corporate HQ. (Incidentally, at her presentation at the2016 Free Your Mind Conference, author and researcher Jeanice Barcelo claimedthe California porn industry has a similar practice of placing hexes on themasters of the movies it creates. You can watch that talkhere – https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kt1-GBPcpU[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kt1-GBPcpU]. And, along still similar lines,in 2012, the UK’s ‘Daily Mail’ reported that John McAfee, founder of the McAfeeanti-virus computer software, had taken to having Wiccan witches performdrumming rituals at his company HQ, as a way of infusing his product with someof the resulting energy.)If hexes cast on to recording tape is what was happening decades ago – and thesame forces are still controlling corporate music output – how much moresophisticated might practices have now become with the advent of digitaltechnology?RAVERS REFLECTThere were some very incisive comments from those posting to a thread on theDavid Icke on-line Forum a few years ago. Whatever anyone may or may not thinkabout Icke himself is irrelevant here, as the detached, everyday perspectivesthat regular punters have are often far more profound than the views of seasonedprofessionals. With that in mind, a handful of former ravers contributed thefollowing array of comments, and many of them touched on the idea thatelectronic music – at a frequency level – may have been having an undetectedeffect on the crowds who were absorbing it – often in a chemically-alteredmind-state:“When the music got more and more hardcore, some of it used to make me feel likeit was trying to take over my mind. Not sure how to explain the feeling, but Iremember being at a rave and not liking what the beat was doing. The whole scenegradually got more and more aggressive.”“Do you think you started feeling ‘creeped out’ when the beats mapped themselvesin your brain for a reason? I do. I think music can be used to amplify thedimensions from which it is created. If you make music with evil thoughts, giveit evil rhythms, it will produce evil vibrations. In the case of rave music,there are so many different varieties of ambient, house, and other genres in theelectronic scene. It is very hard to put a label on the types of music which maybe seeking to crawl inside the listener’s brain and give them a hardwire intosome alien type of consciousness, but it says a lot that some people canactually feel the music doing this.“Knowing what I know now, I think that it might have been part of some massiveenergy extraction, as the love and belonging and the feeling of being somethingspecial was almost spiritual.”“In New York when I used to go in the early to mid-90s, there were a lot of UFOand space-themed parties. One famous weekly party was called NASA (NocturnalAudio-Sensory Awakening) at Shelter. After reading the Laurel Canyon articles, Ireally wonder who was behind some of these parties.”“Very interesting. I noticed an agenda in Australia in the 90s to get peeps offthe streets and other activities, and into clubs and raves, with no shortage insupply of pills. Since I was under-age and not inside on E, that’s why I beganto notice it. Those outside would get hassled by The Man until they went home,or into a club. It got me thinking.”The following comment seems to be key in assessing how the experiences of raversseemed to differ; while some claimed the sound frequencies in conjunction withthe drugs caused them to expand their consciousness in ways which improved theirlife no end, others seem to have had an altogether darker and more destructiveexperience. There continue to be frequent accounts of paranoid psychosis andschizophrenia being attributed to the regular ingesting of E, like LSD beforeit.“I think with your first point you’re right, and some will have started with therave scene to open more doors in the mind and grow, without even knowing it atthe time. And while that was happening, they just had fun with it.“There’s also a lot of people not in that place. I knew a few people who wentrapidly downhill and ended up quite poorly in all ways due to raving. I’ve alsoknown people who have been in the scene, walked away OK, and are so far awayfrom questioning anything around them it’s scary. It’s all about perception andwhere people are at on their journey, I guess.? ... I wonder if, for everyperson who has walked away from the scene with positive memories, there isanother who has really suffered because of it. But hey, the Powers That Bearen’t going to be worried about the ‘fallout’ of a small percentage of peoplewho start to question. Not when they have their ‘suffering’ or ‘distractionlovers’ to balance the mix. They have met their overall objective, whatever itmay be.“The raves going legal and organised brought a different vibe, and thingschanged. The organised gangs are the street soldiers for the Masons, if you askme, and the classic trick with the government is to take out the competition andget their own versions of the drugs in, which is exactly what seemed to be goingon here. Regards the overall agenda – yes, ecstasy can you make you feel good.But what goes up must come down. What was it doing to our serotonin and pinealgland long-term? And perhaps some of this music was specifically designed tofuck with our brainwaves and subvert consciousness, as discussed with rockmusic, for example.”There were some particularly deep considerations from the poster known as‘Separ.’ (The 303 he refers to is the Roland TB-303 synthesizer, the staplecomponent of early Acid House productions, and there’s more on many of thepoints he raises in Chapter 6.)“There is always something or someone leeching energy at these events. However,regarding demonic influence, this is something that can also be present. It’snot in the beats but in the tonal qualities of the music. If you have the wrongtype of distortion, you can have odd-order harmonics entering into a sound youlike and are tuned into, and this can be the diabolical tritone. Whenever youhave this, or a discordant rhythmic layer in the sound, it messes up the body’sbio-electrical networks. This overloads the sensorium and destroys neurons,hence causing the feeling of a loss of control (‘music taking over.’)“When it comes to these discordant overtones, Rave music is more guilty thanother genres. The 303, for example, is a transistor-based saw-and-squaregenerator, and the filters on that thing generate mostly odd-order harmonics.You can listen to it for only a short time before it becomes painful, (unlessyour pain receptors are numbed by drugs).“Those people who went to raves in the 90s were undergoing a kind of‘formatting’ to transform them into a different form of life: outwardly, thesame as everyone else, but inwardly, their synaptic pathways were changedpermanently. The reason why they went voluntarily to these raves was because ofa combination of future-shock syndrome, and because their vibration level hadbecome fixated at a certain point and they could not move beyond it easily.”A poster by the name of ‘Iztac,’ suggested that modern-day raves could becoercing clubbers to tap into primal states that lie at the very heart of thehuman experience:“In every ancient culture, song, (mostly drums,) and especially dance, werepresent at every ceremony. Music and dance, (and sometimes certain sacredplants,) would take people into a receptive state of mind where they couldcommune deeply with nature’s consciousness and with their people. Aztecs, forexample, called that state of being ‘centiliztli’ – ‘becoming one’ as anapproximate meaning. Ancient religions everywhere in the five continents sharestrikingly similar common traits, and one of them was their encouragement ofcollective trance states.“ ... What if raves are a way to prevent many potentially highly energy-aware,spiritually-oriented individuals, from getting in touch with actualspirituality? ‘They’ appeal to our genetic memory and collective subconscious,and provide an analogue experience to those our ancestors had with drums anddance. The difference is that we are given synthetic drugs, (put in the marketby intelligence agencies,) and are exposed to (Tavistock?) engineered hypnoticmusic, with the purpose of locking many of us into addictive trance states thatwould divert our energy away from rebellion, creativity, reflection and truespirituality, (not New Age crap or ‘religion marketing.’) And why not offer theenergy we produce to a given spiritual entity?”In the same way that different human bodies seem to have wildly disparatereactions to certain diets – meat is deadly to some, while a vegan diet seems tobe devastating to others – it seems biological reactions to chemicals areequally diverse. If the tidal wave of pills were largely launched at the handsof the social engineers, were the positive experiences merely considered to becollateral damage in an agenda devised with nefarious aims? Or did thecontrollers really have no idea how the big picture would play out, and the ravegeneration was being used as a community of lab rats in another giant socialexperiment?As Matthew Collin writes on page 294 of ‘Altered State:’“But if no-one really knew what ecstasy did to the body, how could they quantifyits effects on the mind? This was, after all, a chemical which had been popularamong therapists for its ability to break down psychological barriers. Whatwould happen when huge numbers of people took huge amounts of it for years onend? Would those defences crumble for ever? Each successive generation ofinitiates developed its own oral history of mental deterioration, of ecstasycasualties ‘losing it,’ having nervous breakdowns, being institutionalised, evencommitting suicide. Were these just people who were halfway to insanity already,and the long, sleepless weekends had simply pushed them over the line? Was thedrug itself to blame? Or was it just a way to explain away the inexplicable?”The following thread from Reddit comes recommended for further, similarinsights, meanwhile. (Googling ‘Reddit strange happenings EDM festivals’ savesinputting the whole clunky URL:) * https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/36xkrd/strange_happenings_regarding_edm_festivals_raves/ [https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/36xkrd/strange_happenings_regarding_edm_festivals_raves/]THE BIRTH OF MOLLYWikipedia describes MDMA as follows:“3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA,) commonly known as ecstasy (E,) is apsychoactive drug used primarily as a recreational drug. Desired effects includeincreased empathy, euphoria, and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth,effects begin after 30-45 minutes and last 3-6 hours. It is also sometimessnorted or smoked.”The US got its influx of ecstasy late compared to the UK, and it seems to havebeen the Hip-Hop world which first embraced it. This was at odds with thatgenre’s traditional association with cannabis. Key corporate asset Dr. Drepopularised weed with his ground-breaking album ‘The Chronic’ in 1992, and therewere many more odes to the green stuff with Snoop Doggy Dogg’s Dre-produced‘Doggy Style’ album the following year. By the end of that decade, however, Dreand the artists he directed had started dropping namechecks for MDMA into theirrecordings. Its title leaving nothing to the imagination, ‘Let’s Get High,’ fromDre’s own 1999 album ’The Chronic 2001,’ included the line: “Yeah, I just tooksome ecstasy. Ain’t no telling what the side-effects could be.” In an interviewfrom earlier the same year with ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine, Eminem described theprocess of assembling his debut album, ‘The Slim Shady LP,’ with Dr. Dre as:“I wrote two songs for the next album on ecstasy. Shit about bouncing off walls,going straight through ‘em, falling down twenty storeys. Crazy. That’s what wedo when I’m in the studio with Dre. Dr. Dre on E? Ha ha!”Commercial Hip-Hop’s first reference to ecstasy, however, seems to have come twoyears earlier when Notorious B.I.G. rapped: “Some say the X makes the sexspec-tacular” on the track ‘Fucking You Tonight’ with R Kelly from his ‘LifeAfter Death’ album. (‘X’ is American slang for ecstasy.)[../images/00007.jpeg]A Playboy Bunny, one of many themed batches of Ecstasy pills. Where did they allcome from?https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Playboy_Bunny.jpg/765px-Playboy_Bunny.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f9/Playboy_Bunny.jpg/765px-Playboy_Bunny.jpg]Credit: PsychonaughtIn 2001, Missy Elliot put out another provocatively-titled album called ‘Miss E:So Addictive,’ which included a track called ‘X-Stasy.’ As the 2000s progressed,MDMA namechecks became as much a staple of Hip-Hop lyricism as bling, booty andbitches. At some point, the pure form of MDMA used to make ecstasy, picked upthe nickname of ‘Molly’, referring to the drug in its powdered or capsule form.Rick Ross boasted of putting Molly in a girl’s champagne glass so she would passout allowing him to rape her, on the Rocko track ‘U.O.E.N.O.’ Classy.Where did all this E/ MDMA suddenly come from? How can it just appear sowidespread on a scene overnight – and with every major rapper signed to acorporate label namechecking and endorsing it – if not part of a co-ordinatedplan, with the full complicity of record labels, the police and the intelligenceservices? If law enforcement were really interested in stamping out these‘illicit’ substances, (the ‘War on Drugs,’) why would they not introducelegislation to prevent the record companies from including lyrics promoting thatlifestyle to kids?It appears that Hip-Hop’s corporate puppets were being used to popularise MDMAunder its new ‘Molly’ guise, ready for it to be moved across to electronic dancemusic at the point that it exploded in the 2010s. French-born producer CedricGervais took things to the next level with his 2012 track ‘Molly,’ with itsrepeated refrain: “And I can’t seem to find Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly,Molly, Molly, Molly, (fucked around and fell in love with her.)” Aspects ofGervais’ biography become interesting at this point, in terms of how he came tobe in such an influential position to release the track. His father owned anightclub in the South of France. As his entry on the Resident Advisor websitestates:“Cedric Gervais has had an extraordinary life. As a young teenager, Cedric, whois originally from Marseilles, headed to St Tropez. There he got a summerresidency at the famed Papa Gaio club. He was only 14 years old, not evenlegally old enough to party with the people he played for ... Cedric pleadedwith his father to take him out of school so he could concentrate on DJing. Hisfather agreed, and, as is customary in France, went to the local courts to putCedric’s case forward. Then at just 15 years old, and not speaking any English,he decided Paris wasn’t challenging him enough musically, so he packed up andmoved to Miami. This was at a time when an exciting movement within the clubscene was happening ... Cedric saw this opportunity and jumped in.”Gervais, (real name Cedric DePasquale,) is also an actor, having featured inHollywood productions such as ‘Patriot’s Day’ and ‘Deepwater Horizon,’ whichreinforced the official narratives of the Boston Marathon bombing and the Gulfof Mexico oil spill respectively.Never missing an opportunity to court controversy and further the programmes ofthose who tell her what to do, meanwhile, Madonna – by this point well over 50years of age – used her appearance at 2012’s Ultra Music Festival in Miami toask “how many people in this crowd have seen Molly?” as she introduced theartist Avicii. Although the crowd cheered in knowing unison, her commentsbrought the apparent scorn of the Canadian EDM artist Deadmau5, (real name JoelZimmerman,) who feigned disgust by Tweeting: “Very classy there,Madonna ... such a great message for the young music lovers at Ultra.” Giventhat Zimmerman’s gimmick at his performances is DJing with a massive MickeyMouse-style head fixture, however – as blatant an indication ofcorporate-sponsored mind-control as you can get – one could be forgiven forconcluding that his move was just as contrived and manufactured as Madonna’s.Madonna herself was not finished, however. Around the same time, she announcedthat she was dropping the vowels from her name, temporarily becoming MDNA in anobvious further reference to the drug she had been commissioned to promote.WHO LET THE PILLS OUT?Clubbers and social commentators all have their views on who, ultimately, wasbehind the influx of ecstasy into both the British and American dance scenes.Although the foot soldiers are easy to identify, pinpointing those who may beemploying them becomes a much harder task. It’s difficult to prove thatpersonnel from military intelligence and social engineering think tanks wereflooding the market – it wouldn’t be a terribly successful programme on theirpart if they could be rooted out so easily – but it can certainly be seen thatthe results emanating from its widespread use are any social experimenter’sdream.One intriguing aspect of E is that pills appeared in branded batches, with theirown logos inscribed. An extremely high-profile one in the British clubs of the1990s was known as the Mitsubishi, adorned as it was with the motif of the carmanufacturing giant. ‘Doves’ were also extremely popular in the early days, (a1995 ‘Independent’ article claimed that manufacturers were spiking them witheverything from LSD, to fish tank cleaning powder, to dog-worming pills.)These engravings may have been a way for the suppliers to track where pills fromspecific batches ended up in the market, and of gauging which ones – perhapseach with slightly different chemical constituents – became the most popular.Among other well-received variations were Nokias, Clovers, Red Triangles, GreenTriangles and Heaven’s Gates. Former pill-poppers differ in their recollectionsof their chemically-induced experiences. For every raver full of misty-eyednostalgia for wonderful days, proclaiming the spiritual enlightenment and senseof freedom their drug-taking brought them, it seems there’ll be another whoseexperiences were far less fun. Might the reasons for these differences go beyondsimply the different personalities of the individuals involved? Could thequality of a ‘trip’ be affected not just by the components of the pill, but bythe sigil engraved on it? As discussed in the last book, symbols carry energeticsignatures and can be charged with the will of those creating them – allhappening on an unseen level, but very real nevertheless. Factor in certainparties who may not necessarily have the personal welfare of those necking thepills as their top priority, and suddenly the story takes on new possibilities.As John Gibbons considers:“This is mass-produced stuff. People can say, well, it was all covert, and theyall just got away with it. Who just got away with it? Because I would argue thatthe government just got away with it, and people who we perceive to be incontrol ... they know what’s going on, and they allow things to go on based onwhat serves their agenda. I don’t think there’s any doubt that there was – atthe very least – some form of experimentation at play, and it has led to what wesee now with EDM, and with another strand being pulled into the bigger pictureof entertainment and mass mind-control.“That really does go in parallel with that first Summer of Love when people weretaking LSD and it was all about freedom and love ... I think it was almost likea testbed, or laying the foundations or the bedrock for the new form ofmind-control as that evolved.“These drugs, when they become so freely available, when they aremass-marketed – albeit through the underground – that has to be ‘allowed’ tohappen. Because the authorities who have all this control, all of a sudden don’tlose control of things when it comes to drugs. And particularly, when they wantto carry out some kind of mass experiment ... And there is a tendency for peopleto think that, because something happened 50 years ago, it wouldn’t happen now.Well, of course it would happen now. So, if governments were capable 50 yearsago of flooding the market with drugs in order to test how a population wouldreact ... well, of course they’re willing to do it in the 1980s again, andthey’re willing to do it now.”The importance of ecstasy to the trajectory of the nascent dance scene in the UKwas openly flaunted in its early days with no observable objections from theauthorities. Flyers and ads for club nights were flagrant in their knowing useof narcotic lingo, and the naming of acts such as The Chemical Brothers,(earlier known as The Dust Brothers,) Luv Dup, Toxic Two, Smart Es, E-Zee Posse,Ellis Dee, Skin Up and Kicks Like A Mule left little room for ambiguity. Neitherdid certain song titles. Rozalla’s ‘Are You Ready To Fly?,’ Bump’s ‘I’mRushing,’ Audio Adrenaline’s ‘Your Love Has Lifted Me Higher and Higher,’ andHyper Go Go’s ‘High’ with its talk of ‘touching the sky,’ all came with aknowing wink. Praga Khan’s ‘Injected With A Poison’ and Oceanic’s ‘Insanity’ mayhave been more veiled portents. The Shamen’s calculated inclusion of the line‘Es are good’ into their number one hit single ‘Ebeneezer Goode’ has become afavourite clubber’s fable.For a short phase in 1991-92, UK productions sampled fondly-rememberedchildren’s TV programmes. The hook in The Prodigy’s frantically-flying ‘Charly,’was lifted from a 1970s public service TV ad about child safety, while UrbanHype’s ‘Trip To Trumpton,’ (see what they did there?) and Smart Es’ ‘Sesame’sTreet,’ brought similar nostalgic flashbacks for the first generation of ravers.Was it just a novelty marketing gimmick? Or were these produced with the knowingintention of chemically regressing E-heads back to infantile states of mind? Wasit a darkly mocking commentary on the loss of childhood innocence brought on bya new world of sin?As many a raver will testify, the music made little sense to anyone who was notin a chemically-altered mindstate to synch their perceptions with the beats,samples and frequencies they were experiencing. The trump card trick of theTrance genre, which had emerged as the de facto ‘big room’ club sound of themid-90s, was a strategically-timed breakdown, where the energy of the trackfaded away, only to build again gradually, eventually crashing into a glorious,intoxicating crescendo, mimicking the euphoria experienced in the brain as thepills do their thing and stimulate the serotonin and endorphins.In 2016, meanwhile, came the story that an artist by the name of ChemicalX – who was reported to have designed the Ministry of Sound’s famous portcullislogo, and is said to have worked with Paul Oakenfold and Snoop Dogg – hadcreated a range of artwork made of real ecstasy pills which he himself hadcooked up in his laboratory. His website sells prints of each piece. One was amural said to consist of 10,000 real pills. Although he reportedly moves hismobile lab around to avoid detection, the idea that he would be able to get awaywith in-your-face displays, if government authorities were really as interestedin ‘stamping out drugs’ as they claim to be, is laughable – particularly asimages of the works were publicly displayed at an Art Republic exhibition inLondon in 2013, before the curators axed it citing ‘legal implications.’ Thereis also the news that a graffiti artist named Dean Zeus Colman, who attended theChelsea College of Arts, made a line of plaster sculptures of actual ecstasypills.Certainly, the US government seems to have fewer hang-ups about ecstasy than itsBritish counterparts – at least officially – given that the Food & DrinkAdministration, after years of lobbying from the Multidisciplinary Associationfor Psychedelic Studies, decided in 2017 to begin using MDMA in the treatment ofmedical conditions such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. A study published inthe ‘Canadian Medical Association Journal,’ went further by adding psilocybinmushroom and LSD to the mix, suggesting them as useful in treating addictions,anxiety associated with terminal illness, and depression.Critics of the chemically-infused dance scene – most of them former ravers anddrug-takers themselves – now talk of the false ‘one-ness’ that Es created. Itwas false, they say, because many pillheads are all ‘loved up’ when they’reunder the influence, but act like complete assholes the rest of the time. It’swell-documented that the arrival of E in the late 80s, saw many British clubsfull of thugs who would otherwise have been engaged in organised violence atfootball matches, instead hugging each other in their artificially-alteredstates. Many clubbers became addicted to the pills and to the scene, andcouldn’t enjoy themselves properly without them.There may have been another element at play, too, considers Emily Moyer. Does Eemasculate males and blur the lines between gender identification? Could that bepart of the controllers’ enthusiasm to have it everywhere at dance parties?“One of the things I noticed about ecstasy early on, is that it feminised men.There’s definitely been this push. I have no problem with anyone being gay,straight, transgender, whatever ... if that’s what they really are. But if we’rebeing pushed towards something by the media, by the culture ... I know guys whowere always totally straight who, after years of doing ecstasy, were girlierthan I am! I’ve seen people kiss people of the same sex at parties who wouldnever normally do that if they weren’t on drugs. I wonder if this is part of thesoftening-up of society – to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity?I call it the Chaos Confusion Agenda.”WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDEA correspondent who e-mailed me in response to some of my public talks,identified herself as being of the generation that was in the sights of theculture-creators behind the 1960s ‘hippie’ scene. She grudgingly accepted thatshe and her peers had been used as unwitting guinea-pigs in a massive socialexperiment when – at the time – they all thought they were so free. As shecommented:“I believe that this dark agenda revolved around not only getting the ‘best andthe brightest’ addicted to drugs and drink, loveless sex and of course Rock ’n’Roll, but that it was a carefully-crafted campaign to undermine us at thedeepest level of our spiritual core. Complete disempowerment from which many ofus are still reeling and – thankfully – bouncing back.”In my last book’s analysis of the 60s scene, I quoted a respondent to one of myYouTube videos as follows:“What the ‘hippie’ movement, did was discredit the voice of the youth by theEstablishment that was sending them to die in Vietnam. All their parents saw wasa bunch of dropout stoners that didn’t ‘love’ their parents, country or God.They were at worst demonic, at best, freeloading sex-addicted bums. And all thewhile, their children thought they were ‘expanding’ their minds, loving theirfellow human beings and doing what’s right.“They were tricked, lied to and manipulated by a power greater than they wereable to understand.”The above comment bears repeating here, because it’s so similar in sentiment toa comment left on a forum recently by a raver from the Acid House scene:“I remember as a young raver thinking I had found total freedom, love andacceptance, while I was hindering my chances of achieving any of those thingslong-term.

Social engineering, culture creation, and Lifetime Actors.“We are governed, our minds are moulded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested,largely by men we have never heard of ... Our invisible governors are, in manycases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the innercabinet ... Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this condition, itremains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives – whether in thesphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking –we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons ... who understandthe mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull thewires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrivenew ways to bind and guide the world.”Opening page of ‘Propaganda’ by Edward Bernays (1891-1995,) published in 1928“There’s nothing in the streets, looks any different to me,And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye.And the parting on the left, is now the parting on the right,And the beards have all grown longer overnight.I’ll tip my hat to the new constitution, take a bow for the new revolution.Smile and grin at the change all around,Pick up my guitar and play, just like yesterday.Then I’ll get on my knees and pray,We don’t get fooled again.”The Who: ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again’ (1971)“Fool me once, shame on you.Fool me twice, shame on me.”Old English ProverbIn 2017, BBC4 presenter Suzy Klein began her ‘Tunes for Tyrants’ TV series withthe observation:“Many of the political issues of our own day – things like political extremism,social inclusion, identity politics – were all being tested out in thelaboratory that was Berlin’s cabaret scene.”The comment speaks to the power that entertainment can have in shaping entirecultural movements ... though the BBC seems to have forgotten to mention thatthis dynamic goes a hell of a lot further than just Berlin’s cabaret scene ofthe 1920s!It was realised some decades ago, that a far more effective method ofcontrolling the behaviours of societies lies not in the type of open, bold-facedtyranny that can be seen, understood, feared and resisted, (think GeorgeOrwell’s ‘1984,’) but through subtle, hidden means. A key aspect to thecontrollers’ agenda for human domination, therefore, lies in the gradual andsystematic changing of culture and human behaviour. If large numbers of peoplewere to realise what’s going on, it would be hugely detrimental to the plans.The only way to steer societies in a desired direction is to be in control ofevery step of the process, with nothing left to random chance or naturalprogression. Ensured success in these endeavours, therefore, relies on tried andtrusted groups and individuals being commissioned to instigate the changes,masquerading all the time under benign, good-natured public images thatcompletely mask their true intentions.This dynamic was articulately addressed in a 2017 article on the Mind Unleashedwebsite:“When we look around at people, and they don’t resemble unique individuals, butmanifestations of cultural templates, we must wonder who is setting the socialtrends in motion.“Who pays celebrities and musicians to influence the people around us to act andfeel the way they do? We live in a society drowning in social engineering:drowning in behaviours and beliefs that did not rise organically from thepeople, but from a wealthier class of people who propagate ideas through music,television, and other forms of media.“ ... It should be deeply fulfilling to recognise exactly who is trying toprogramme us. What could matter more than identifying exactly who is creatingour culture, how, and why? These people are affecting the lives of us andeveryone around us.”Documentation has shown that a tenet of the subversion ideology espoused by theSoviet Union during the Cold War years, involved the creation of what it called‘False Heroes and Role Models.’Welcome to the realm of Lifetime Actors, culture creation and FacilitatedCareers.GETTING THE JOB DONEThe over-riding aim of all modern social engineering agendas, has been to employculture towards the debasement of morals, and the break-up of the traditionalfamily unit. Societies split by discord between the generations – and betweensocial groupings with perceived differences – are much easier to manipulate bymalevolent controllers than a population united in solidarity. The lack of unityis exploited to play different groups off against each other. This processbecomes yet more effective when society has become so fractured and divided,that most of its members are too distracted to even realise that all, in fact,share the same common enemy.There are few better ways of understanding these principles, than by studyingthe minutiae of the LSD and ‘free love’-laden counter-culture scene of the 1960s– a movement which so many researchers have now shown to have occurred under thedirection of the CIA and its associates, that there can no longer be anylegitimate claim that it was in any way ‘grass-roots’ or organic. A comment inEddi Fiegel’s biography of ‘Mama’ Cass Elliot, attributed to Cass’s songwritingassociate John Bettis, speaks to the net effect of that whole engineeredmovement:“People forget now how dark it was from ’69 to ’76. America was not a happyplace. Far from it. No matter where you turned, whether it was the gas crisis,whether it was the rampant drug problems everybody had, whether it was the factthat we had opened up a Pandora’s Box with free love and relationships ... Bythe time we got to 1969, everybody between the ages of twenty and twenty-eightwas a drug addict. Everybody had been through two or three failed relationshipsof living with somebody, because we were all kids who didn’t know what the fuckwe were doing. And by the time you got to 1970, you were exhausted and you weresure that if you could just find another drug you’d be OK!”Right on script.And the YouTube user known as Dayz of Noah, whose work comes highly recommended,summed it all up in the opening lines of his video ‘How Media Shaped TheGenerations: The Chaos Era’:“By 1966, a strong black and white trauma bonding psychological operation was atwork, and losing one’s mind to make sense of it all, presented itself as theonly option for a great majority ... pushing the popular worldview further intosatanic perspectives, undergoing spiritual possession and mind-control onencompassing scales.”The mass mind-control agendas invariably serve to keep people away fromunderstanding the dynamics of Natural Law, also; of appreciating the spiritualaspect of our existence here, and the fact that the actions we choose to takehave repercussions throughout Creation that extend way beyond this physicalrealm. We’re conditioned to think otherwise – that life is only about temporaryphysical fulfilment and personal material gain. But more of that in this book’sfinal chapter.The entertainment industries play ingeniously into this dynamic. Most peopleconsider music, movies and television as merely fun, light relief from thedrudgery of everyday life, and it would never occur to them – until it’s pointedout – that these could be used for the shaping of values and perceptions. Peopleare most off their guard against mind-control after a hard day at the slave job,when all they want to do to is unwind from the stress before it begins all overagain. The ‘think-tank’ institutions referred to in the previous chapterspecialise in these types of culture creation. Beneath the benign-soundingrhetoric, lies the truth of what certain sectors of these organisations werereally set up to do.[../images/00008.jpeg]The 1960s counter-culture, sponsored by those nice folks at Langley.https://pixabay.com/en/psychedelic-peace-tie-die-hippie-1503541[https://pixabay.com/en/psychedelic-peace-tie-die-hippie-1503541/]Credit: No attribution required‘Philanthropy,’ hiding behind ‘foundations’ and ‘institutes,’ has long been usedas a smokescreen for societal control, and even eugenics. David Rockefeller, whowas reported to have finally died in March 2017 at the age of 101, was describedofficially as a ‘philanthropist,’ when he was almost certainly one of thearchitects of the deadly events of 9/11, and has been responsible for the death,suffering and ignorance of untold millions through the pharmaceutical,vaccination and dumbed-down ‘education’ systems that have been installed by theRockefeller Foundation. ‘Philanthropy’; it’s the new Genocide.Similarly, a visit to the Rothschilds’ country pile of Waddesdon Manor inBuckinghamshire, will proudly display the family’s collection of art, withplaques declaring them to be collectors and ‘philanthropists’ ... but willforget to mention their role in the human slavery brought about by that family’scomplete domination of the worldwide financial system. As with ‘philanthropy,’so many actors hide behind a veil of ‘doing good work for charity.’ ‘Sir’ JimmySavile earned his status as a ‘national treasure’ through years of what seemedto be selfless deeds for assorted charities. In truth, these were simply tosecure his image as an all-round great guy to divert attention from his realnature, and in part to gain him access to many of the children that he wouldsexually abuse – including those paralysed in the spinal injuries unit at StokeMandeville Hospital at which he was a ‘patron’ with his own living quarters.‘Jim’ll Fix It’ indeed.Another ‘national treasure’ was Rolf Harris, who hid behind the image of alovely man, good with children and caring about small, fluffy animals. When he,too, was unmasked as a paedophile, the British public could scarcely believe it,so convincing had his cover story been. These people are capable of duplicityand deception at levels that most cannot comprehend, and the fact that so manydon’t – even when the obvious is pointed out to them – is what allows the evilin which we live to continue unabated.IT’S ALL AN ACTIn one of his final interviews in 2015, for the freemantv.com podcast, authorand researcher Dave McGowan commented:“I guess if there’s one thing I would say to people, it would be to just be verycareful about who you choose as your icons and leaders, because these people maynot be who you think they are. Be very sceptical of anyone in Hollywood who hasa political agenda.”Different generations of the same Establishment-serving families are put to usein designated roles. Some go into the world of politics, some into big business,some into science or the military, some into films, some into television, someinto music – all to play their influential roles in these different fields.There will even be bloodline descendants who pose as ‘truth’ researchers andpublic speakers, but who mislead while pretending to inform.This is the realm of the Lifetime Actor. It’s a term coined by author,researcher and scholar Joe Atwill to address individuals who have becomehousehold names through their public personas; Bill Gates as the founder ofMicrosoft, for example. Their backgrounds tell a different story, however,usually revealing family links to military-intelligence or other aspects ofsocial control. In Gates’ case, his father, William H. Gates Sr., had been headof the Planned Parenthood organisation which had evolved out of the AmericanEugenics Society. An insight into the mindset of these people comes fromcomments made by Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood’s founder; “the mostmerciful thing that a large family does to one of its infant members is to killit,” and “ ... human weeds, reckless breeders, spawning ... human beings whonever should have been born,” in describing immigrants and the working class.Now, it becomes far more likely that Gates Jr’s real role in society is tocovertly push eugenics and population-control, something borne out by his closeassociation with the United Nations and its mass-vaccination programmes inAfrica, and his ties to genetically modified food monolith Monsanto.Readers wanting to delve fully into the world of Lifetime Actors and culturecreation, are encouraged to absorb the ‘Unspun’ series of podcasts hosted by JoeAtwill and Jan Irvin which all reside at http://www.gnosticmedia.com[http://www.gnosticmedia.com]. Episode 8 gives a useful overview of the wholeconcept. On it, Atwill states:“What a Lifetime Actor is, is simply a personality that is in the media that iscompletely fake, and the representation that the individual makes aboutthemselves as a person, is false. The term has really developed to try and helppeople understand individuals historically that have lived a lie. Their life hasbeen something that was given to the public, basically, to fool them. So wecould mention Terence McKenna, Gordon Wasson, Timothy Leary, Gregory Bateson,Ken Kesey.“So you have these images of these individuals. Whatever the media has given youabout them, that’s what’s in your head ... And then they influence culture, andthe next thing you know, you’ve got a degenerated population. The Lifetime Actoris the correct way to identify these individuals. They were trained to createtheir persona. And the persona is really necessary in order for their propagandato be effective.“So you might think of Leary at a Be-In where he’s in his Indian garb and he’skind of acting all spaced-out. This seems like it’s the sincere behaviour of astrange individual, but actually, it’s a weapon. What he’s doing, is he’s tryingto make this kind of behaviour seem hip, to have people who are influenced byhim, adopt these attributes.”Timothy Leary has been shown by documentary evidence to have been a long-termasset of the CIA. The question then becomes; why would the CIA have had anyinterest in LSD, psychedelics and ’free love’ being enthusiastically adoptedinto the lifestyles of an entire generation? Jan Irvin refers to the CIA moreaccurately as the Central Entertainment Agency, and it’s also been described asthe Cultural Infiltration Agency. Either way, it’s in direct violation of itscharter to only operate outside of the United States. Leary himself admitted tothe agency’s extensive homegrown activity in an interview:“I give the CIA total credit for sponsoring and initiating the entireconsciousness movement and counter-culture events of the 1960s. The CIA funded,supported and encouraged hundreds of young psychiatrists to experiment with thisdrug.”The evidence now available certainly suggests that the Agency expends more timeand energy on societal shaping and moulding, than it does on matters of spying,surveillance and ‘national security.’ Britain’s intel organisations have had asimilar hand in the manipulation of the entertainment industry too – some wouldargue even more so.The same dynamic is at play with any kind of social movement which influenceslarge numbers of people and changes societal behaviour. The feminist movementwhich came out of the 1960s, contemporaneous to LSD and the ‘counter-culture,’is no exception, as Atwill continues:“The women who were reading ‘Ms.’ magazine trusted Gloria Steinem. They trusted‘Ms.’ because they thought these magazines were really out to protect them. Butthen, it turned out that ... wait a second. Gloria Steinem is a Lifetime Actor!She’s a CIA agent! She’s a CIA agent from the time she’s at High School! Andnow, when you look at her that way, then you can see, wait a second ... Thisisn’t necessarily being given to us as a way to protect women. This could be atool to destroy the family.”As previously noted, the music industry has long had its own Lifetime Actors toensure this particular mode of entertainment is steered down certain desiredpaths, usually in synchronised tandem with other changes. A new way ofscrutinising ‘cultural icons’ that are served up to us by the media is requiredif we are to take back our power in shaping our own societal culture, ratherthan having it crafted for us.As Joe Atwill adds:“The media’s been weaponised. So when you get someone who is a star in themedia, they’re not there accidentally ... When you see these elements fittinginto the process of the weaponisation – like the Beatles leading to the Stones,leading to the sex, drugs and Rock ’n’ Roll culture – you know they’re somehowdirty, they’re somehow in on the operation.“Jim Morrison and The Doors. Now you’ve got the son of the Admiral who led thefalse-flag fake attack in the Gulf of Tonkin that starts the Vietnam War. Who isthis guy? He comes out of nowhere, he’s very attractive, and he has thisappetite for LSD. And because he’s a music idol, he influences people. Butimagine if he’d come out and said, ‘you know, I’m just a son of militaryintelligence, and they’ve told me that they want to have people takedrugs ... so please take drugs.’“I mean, if he came out that way, the culture wouldn’t move very far. Hispersona was developed, all the attributes of his character in the media weredeveloped, so that he would have the most power in terms of influencing people.“So, if these Lifetime Actors are considered by people as possibly fake,possibly anthropologic weapons, if they’re scrutinised and serious questions areasked about them ... then the damage that they will do is going to be almostnothing.”Though celebrities and public figures are often presented as being ‘just likeus,’ and can seem to be ‘really nice,’ it’s worth remembering that millions getspent on public relations spin, and that none of us really knows the truecharacter and background of the individual behind the surface gloss. The safestway to avoid being duped, therefore, is to consider nobody worth your trustunless you know them personally, and have had direct interactions with them.BLAME IT ON THE BLOODLINESFamily backgrounds, and the long-running generational bloodlines from whichcertain household names emanate, are key to understanding their given roles insociety. Prince Charles, with some apparent pride, revealed that the maternalside of his family is descended from Vlad Dracul, the vicious Transylvaniannobleman and warrior who earned the nickname Vlad The Impaler through hispreferred method of mass-execution. With similar open-ness, former British PrimeMinister David Cameron made the apparent throwaway comment to the UK’s ‘DailyMail’ that he just happened to be a distant cousin of Kim Kardashian.The dysfunctional Kardashian family have been used to debase morality anddeplete intelligence through their ‘reality’ TV show, with Kim’sstep-father/mother Bruce/ Caityln Jenner utilised as a tool in the Transgenderagenda. And Kim herself is rarely out of the gossip columns and celebritymagazines – not least as the wife of Kanye West. This in spite of her displayinglittle personal talent in any field, but still influencing the lives of millionsof impressionable people who have fallen for the hype that she’s some kind of‘role model.’ Could an ordinary family from regular walks of life achieve thislevel of prominence on such little talent? Absolutely not. But that’s becausethey’re not Lifetime Actors. So, one spawn of this bloodline, Cameron, wasushered into the world of politics, while the other was given the role of beinga pointless, vacuous celebrity-for-celebrity’s-sake.Different generations are given designated roles in this way through thecenturies. In all cases, the intention is to have a desired influence and effecton human culture. This is why so many crop up, generation after generation, asHollywood actors, TV personalities, or musicians and singers. They become themost prominent names in their respective fields. In most cases, (the Kardashiansbeing an exception,) these positions appear to be wholly deserved, as they’reclearly very, very good at their given crafts. Logic suggests, therefore, thatacademies or training schools must exist where these individuals hone theirskills under the best tutelage, and with money no object. Lifetime Actors getthe best training.Mainstream newspapers have also reported that Cherie Booth, the wife of anotherformer British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, is related to John Wilkes Booth, thetheatrical actor said to have been the assassin of 19th-century US presidentAbraham Lincoln. Booth’s uncle, Algernon Sydney Booth, was Cherie’sgreat-great-great-grandfather. Cherie’s father, Anthony Booth, was himself anactor, best known for his role in the TV sitcom ’Til Death Do Us Part.’ Themainstream media reports such connections as if they’re simply amazingcoincidences, without asking what the odds really are of public figures fromdifferent eras being genetically linked in this way by random chance.It’s now well-known that all US presidents to date have been genetic descendantsof European nobility through just one character, the emperor Charlemagne,8th-century King of the Franks, and it’s been said that the candidate with themost European genes is the one that ends up winning each election. In many,Americans are given the ‘choice’ of two candidates who are in fact distantcousins, as was the case in the 2016 ‘race’ between Hillary Clinton and DonaldTrump. Although presented as zealous rivals, they have been pictured socialisingtogether at many events, and in fact share 18th great-grandparents.Similarly, George W. Bush and Barack Obama are related. On the surface, itappears as if you couldn’t find two more diametrically-opposed individuals, butthe extended family trees tell a different story. The rest of Bush’s familytree, as revealed in an article by CBS News, and based on research byhttp://www.ancestry.com [http://www.ancestry.com], similarly boggles the mind.It shows him to be related by blood, one way or another, to his ‘opponent’ JohnKerry, his vice-president Dick Cheney, former president Abraham Lincoln,Princess Diana, ‘Playboy’ founder Hugh Hefner, the aforementioned Vlad TheImpaler, and celebrities Marilyn Monroe, (also a US intelligence asset andprobable mind-control subject,) Madonna, Celine Dion and Tom Cruise! Wikipediaadditionally reports that Pocahontas is an ancestor of two presidential FirstLadies, the wives of Ronald Reagan and Woodrow Wilson!And http://www.time.com [http://www.time.com] reported the ‘surprise,’ (it’sonly a surprise if you’re not paying attention,) that – though we still know solittle about him, and the ‘birth certificate’ he has presented is a provenphotoshopped forgery – Barack Obama is a tenth cousin of both his political‘opponent’ Sarah Palin, and the broadcaster Rush Limbaugh. Obama, Palin andGeorge W. Bush are said to be related through common ancestor Samuel Hinckley.An article by Von A. Weist on the www.rense.com website, asserts that SamuelHinckley was also an ancestor of John Hinckley Jr., the man accused of theassassination attempt on Ronald Reagan while George Bush Senior was in office asVice-President. (The Bush and Hinckley families had close social and businessties prior to the 1981 event, just as the Bush and Bin Laden families had priorto the events of 9/11, for which Osama Bin Laden was blamed.)Given these revelations, readers shouldn’t be too surprised if those rumoursabout George Bush Sr.’s wife Barbara, (nee Pierce,) being the illegitimatedaughter of Aleister Crowley turn out to be true. There’s certainly a familyresemblance.Anyone still believe that you can rise to high positions in politics,entertainment or big business purely through hard work and a stroke of goodluck? When Obama was manipulated into office in early 2009, black people inAmerica made remarks like: “At last! Now anyone can be president!” Similarly,schoolkids are often given apparent inspiring advice like: “Work really hard andyou could be the next Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg.”You couldn’t.The UK’s BBC1 TV channel launched its ‘Who Do You Think You Are’ show a fewyears ago, which was all about tracing the ancestry of various household names.It constantly throws up the ‘amazing’ revelation that a public figure justhappens to be descended from royalty or aristocracy, but it’s only ‘amazing’ ifyou don’t know how the game of culture-creation is played. ‘Eastenders’ actorand ‘Cockney diamond geezer’ Danny Dyer, for instance, expressed apparentsurprise at his blood link to the lawyer and statesman Thomas Cromwell, andfurther connections to kings William the Conqueror and Edward III. British actorBenedict Cumberbatch, who portrayed the Enigma code-breaking mathematician AlanTuring in the movie ‘The Imitation Game,’ turns out to be a relative of Turinghimself, both of them sharing ancestry from the 14th century Earl of Somerset.According to researcher and claimant to the British throne Greg Hallett,meanwhile, actor and comedian Peter Sellers was an illegitimate son of the royalLord Louis Mountbatten.The electronic dance music producer Moby, (born Richard Melville Hall on 11thSeptember 1965,) turns out to be a descendant of Herman Melville, the writer ofthe ‘Moby Dick’ novel who hailed from a Freemasonic family.THE CHOSEN ONESThis is not to say that every single household name has got there through theirgenetics, however. The ranks of what I call the Chosen Ones are reserved forthose who may not come from an all-important bloodline, but who have shownsufficient natural skill to have attracted the attention of the talent spotters.An instinctive tendency towards narcissism – or better yet, psychopathy – issomething that will stand an individual in great stead in this regard. It’s herethat mythical glittering contracts that appear too good to be true get offered,and the success and riches that the industry reps offer, appeal directly to thefame-hungry ego of the individual concerned, ensuring that offers are veryrarely refused. This is also the realm, according to insiders, of the ‘elite’sex parties of the type knowingly depicted in the Stanley Kubrick film ‘EyesWide Shut,’ which new recruits are required to attend. The prevailing antics –probably best erased from the imagination – are invariably filmed and therecordings carefully stored, should the threat of their ‘exposure’ ever berequired to bring a would-be un-co-operative participant back into line.Should the rare occasion arise where the conscience of a Chosen One starts tobleed through once they realise the terrible, corrupt nature of what it is theyare now a part of, and they start to look for an exit route, at this point therealisation occurs that they are now an owned commodity, and their only twochoices consist of continuing to do as they’re directed for the rest of theirdays, or exiting the industry the Prince, Michael Jackson or Whitney Houstonway.The Chosen Ones are beneficiaries of what I call Facilitated Careers. Regularmembers of the public can struggle and strive for decades to reach the loftyheights at which their idols reside, not realising that these positions, in mostcases, have been gifted to these individuals by those organisations who can makecareers happen, (because ultimately all facets of society are connected throughsecret-society networks and fraternities.)The way this dynamic works was summed up succinctly by the 1970 made-for-TVmovie ‘The Brotherhood of the Bell’ starring Glenn Ford. This film is nowextremely difficult to track down, but can be viewed in two parts via the DailyMotion links detailed at the end of this chapter.Ford plays a businessman and former attendee of a prestigious college, where hehad been inducted into a secret society, entirely steeped in oaths of secrecyand obedience, (and obviously a thinly-veiled reference to Harvard’s Skull &Bones.) Following the induction of a new member, and after years of inactivity,he is called upon by the Brotherhood to ensure that an old friend of hisdeclines a prominent academic position, so that another member of theBrotherhood can take the role. When his friend commits suicide after discoveringthe truth, Ford’s character is devastated, and vows to expose and bring down thenetwork. The Brotherhood, in turn, make the level of their influence known, asthey are able to infiltrate every area of society through the contacts they haveplaced in key shot-calling positions.In this insane, satanically-inverted reality in which we find ourselves, ourconscious minds are lied to daily by sources that we’re conditioned to think ofas telling us the truth – such as mainstream news outlets and governmentministers. Conversely, it’s so often in works of apparent ‘fiction,’‘imagination’ and ‘fantasy’ – such as TV shows and movies – where the truth of amatter is communicated to our subconscious minds. Isn’t it testament to howgreat a job has been done on this front when you consider the reaction of theaverage mind-controlled member of the public, should you suggest that theplotline of a Hollywood movie is actually a depiction of cold, harsh truths?You’ll very likely be met with a phrase like, “you’ve been watching too manyfilms, mate. You need to get with reality!”DISARMAMENT: A MILITARY-GRADE TACTICThe mermaids of legend seduced ships to their doom with the sweetest-soundingsongs.The reason many have such a hard time believing that a famous celebrity theyadmire may in fact be operating to an agenda, is because, on the surface, theyappear to be well-meaning and sincere in intent. This is where a military-styletactic comes into play. It’s an essential tenet of the weaponisation of culture.A disarmed target who would never imagine that any danger is posed by anapparent friend and ally, is far easier to manipulate and conquer than one fullyon their guard, and anticipating conflict.Most people would never imagine that such levels of deception could be sunkento, because they would not be capable of it themselves. This attitude is whatrenders so many incapable of accepting the replacement of Paul McCartney, forexample, when all the evidence suggests otherwise. Incredulity is a tacticaladvantage on the part of the controllers. Their all-pervading psychopathicmindset is different to ours. When you have no conscience, no empathy, no moralqualms, any tactic becomes fair game. This dynamic was alluded to in RomanPolanski’s ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ movie, where everyone around Mia Farrow’s centralcharacter turned out to be members of a satanic cult, yet no-one would ever haveimagined this to be the case from their genial public personas – friendlyneighbours, doting husband, caring doctor.Famous figures are deliberately given images that make them appear to be ‘on theside’ of those they are affecting, and they’re seen to say and do all the rightthings. This is why so many are seen to undertake ‘humanitarian’ work. (To beclear, I’m not suggesting that in every single case that a celebrity is seenengaging in good works, that it’s cynically contrived – just that in many casesit is, and it’s part of a well-worn tactic.) A comment that was heard sofrequently when Russell Brand emerged with his ‘man of the people’ act was: “Butso much of what he says makes sense!” The truth of the matter is that RussellBrand is an actor, and a big part of an actor’s role involves memorising scriptsand reciting them on cue. In 2017, Jim Carrey was packaging the same ‘celebrityawakened to truth’ act to the American public, reciting all the same sentimentsthat his fellow actor across the pond had a short while earlier, and far toomany were falling for it in exactly the same way.A variation on this strategy is often used when launching the career of a newmusician. An example I’ve often cited is that of Kanye West. He now stands asone of the key assets in the moral degradation of culture, and has been neuteredinto obedient subservience. He underwent what appeared to be a total breakdownof his mind-control programming at his concert in Sacramento in late 2016, wherehe ranted incoherently for around 15 minutes, appearing to call out his ‘mentor’Jay-Z as some kind of handler, with phrases like “don’t send killers at my head,bro.” Kanye ended up being forcibly handcuffed to a gurney and led away for‘psychiatric evaluation.’But when he first emerged with his debut album, ‘The College Dropout,’ he showedall the signs of being a conscious and visionary rapper, with some empoweringmessages to impart. The same was true of Lupe Fiasco who, after a few goodmessages, has sadly fallen into the same corporate mind-control agendas as hispeers.Robin Thicke, (whose recently-deceased father Alan was a prominent televisionpresenter,) was launched as a credible soul artist ... before his debauchedon-stage pimp act with Miley Cyrus at the 2013 MTV Awards confirmed him to bejust another pawn in the hands of his controllers. Miley Cyrus herself waslaunched out of her Disney corporation grooming as good old family-friendlyHannah Montana ... before being transformed into her hedonistic satanic slutpersona. Rihanna and Beyonce, before their videos became laden with dark occultimagery, first appeared to be pleasant, wholesome pop acts that no parent couldhe opposed to ... before they switched and the true purpose for which they werebeing used became clear. By this point in the tried-and-tested process, afanbase is already intact, and is likely to be led down whatever path theiridols dictate. This would be far more difficult to achieve if these acts were tomake their true nature so blatantly known at the outset.It’s for the same reasons that acts who are clearly playing key roles insteering culture in a desired direction, offer up the odd song here and there toimply that they’re among the good guys and just ‘one of us.’ Somewhere in thecanon of most major musicians’ work, the odd socially-conscious or apparently‘anti-establishment’ song can be found. Bono is now understood to be one of themain celebrity stooges in the United Nations’ New World Order plans, and you’dhave to be as short-sighted as he is when he places one hand over his eye not tobe able to see it. But back in U2’s early career, he appeared to be making allthe right statements on songs like ‘Sunday Bloody Sunday,’ ‘Pride (In The NameOf Love’) and ‘Seconds.’As British researcher Carl James outlined in a video linked to at the end,imagery now employed by the group Arcade Fire, hints at them being yet anotherco-opted Establishment asset. Yet it was a different story with their earlymusic, which drew Carl in and seemed to convey inspiring messages. The groupKilling Joke have put out many songs that appear to be anti-establishment andconsciousness-enhancing. But you somehow have to reconcile that with frontmanJaz Coleman’s admitted obsession with – wait for it – the occult teachings ofAleister Crowley, and the band’s name evidently being inspired by the passagefrom Crowley’s ‘Book of Lies’ detailed in the earlier Acid House chapter.Those who reject the suggestions of Dave McGowan, that the pioneering musiciansof the 60s counter-culture were operating to a military-intelligence agenda,will point to the many anti-establishment statements that the likes of JimMorrison and Frank Zappa made in interviews and in their music. But if thesecharacters really were actors playing a role, it wouldn’t be too difficult forpart of their convincing cover to involve them appearing to say all the thingsthat their fans wanted to hear, would it?We see another variation on the Disarmament Tactic, when certain artists who arequite obviously controlled assets, make comments or visual statements thatappear to suggest they have woken up to the true nature of the corporate beast,and are now breaking free and regaining their personal sovereignty. As anexample, Lady Gaga – an artist whose complicity in dark occult andmind-controlling ritual has done potential damage to the minds and souls ofmillions of young people – spoke at a conference in late 2015. Among herproclamations were: ‘I feel sad when I’m overworked, and that I just become amoney making machine ... ’ and: “That makes me unhappy. It feels shallow. I havea lot more to offer than my image.” She even seemed to hint at her ownmind-controlled status when she addressed herself by saying: “Okay, Stefani,Gaga, hybrid-person. Why are you unhappy?” And: “Slowly but surely, I rememberedwho I am.”To an observer with no background knowledge, this appears to represent Gagaasserting her independence and making her own decisions. These are options notopen to such industry tools, however. A clue was given from the location atwhich she made these statements ... Yale University in Connecticut, one of theprinciple ‘elite’ breeding grounds steeped in secret-society activity! Andhowever much it may have appeared that she was turning a new corner, any doubtwas dissipated when she appeared at the 2017 Super Bowl Half Time show adornedin the usual Masonic/ occult regalia in yet another mass-scale ritual, whicheven some elements of the mainstream media described as ‘satanic.’ I guess the‘breakaway’ didn’t go too well then.A similar scenario ensued when Katy Perry released her song and video ‘ChainedTo The Rhythm’ in early 2017. Again, to an untrained observer, this appeared torepresent her making a statement about the mind-controlling nature of modernsociety and the vacuous output of the industry, with lyrics like:“Are we crazy? Living our lives through a lens ... So comfortable, we live in abubble, a bubble ... So comfortable, we cannot see the trouble, thetrouble ... Happily numb ... Turn it up, it’s your favourite song, Dance, dance,dance to the distortion ... Stumbling around like a wasted zombie ... Yeah, wethink we’re free ... We’re all chained to the rhythm.”Naive comments from some quarters like ‘she’s waking up!’ were reminiscent ofwhen British artist Jessie J released her ‘Price Tag’ song a few years before.On the surface, the song appeared to be a scathing critique of modernmaterialism. But the video imagery and the rest of Jessie’s output confirmedthat she was anything but a maverick free spirit boldly speaking truth. As forWhat Katy Did Next, just keep reading.A far more likely scenario than these artists ‘waking up’ and showing they’re‘on our side,’ is that such songs and comments are yet more cynically-concoctedtactics from the toolbox of the engineers, intended as mockery of the profaneand gullible nature of the public, (as they see it,) just as much as of thehelpless situations of the artists themselves. As many have discovered to theirperil, their contracts are binding for life.It is possible, of course, that in certain cases, acts did start out withgenuinely good intentions, and that somewhere along the way – having shown greattalent and a propensity for influencing the public – they were co-opted intosocial engineering agendas and remunerated into conformity. This remains acredible alternative to the assertion that bands were formed with suchintentions right from the start, as this remains difficult, if not impossible,to prove. But regardless of which scenario is at play, the cultural landscapinggets achieved either wayAnd so, (best sung to the tune of The Jam’s ’That’s Entertainment,’) ... that’sEngineering.EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIESAlthough Lifetime Actors and new recruits are thought of as having a principalpublic role – a politician, a film actor, a singer – it appears that,occasionally, a temporary stepping-aside into some other useful role is requiredof them. Being owned commodities who, either through blood or ego are beholdento their controllers, these people have little choice but to fulfil theirinstructions. This is why we see projects such as the Toilet Strike initiative,helmed by Matt Damon, assembling a ragtag bunch of Lifetime Actors in the formof Sir Richard Branson, Bono and Olivia Wilde, to produce the ad. that you canview here, with all its oh-so-hilarious references to ‘the Illuminati,’ andtaking the piss out of genuine conspiracy researchers:https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=56PpsudMnC8[https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=56PpsudMnC8]This is why Bono, whose public role as a rock singer you might expect to consistof, well, singing, in recent years seems to have spent more time in the closepersonal company of the likes of Bill Clinton, George W Bush, Dick Cheney,Barack Obama, Tony Blair and the Pope than of other musicians.This is why one minute, Russell Brand is the world’s unfunniest ‘comedian,’ andthe next, is calling for a ‘revolution of consciousness’ and a more ‘egalitariansociety,’ with primetime slots on BBC programmes like ‘Newsnight’ and ‘QuestionTime.’ Nobody would be allowed on such prominent shows if the message they wereputting forward were not, in some way, part of some larger culture-affectingagenda. (Russell’s next mission, after a few years of popularising the ‘hipster’look of men’s skintight jeans, was to help push the Transgenderism agendaforward a few steps by announcing, in late 2016, that he intended to raise hisimminent new child as ‘gender-neutral.’ It was the same year that Bono was namedby ‘Glamour’ magazine as its ‘Woman of the Year.’)This is why one minute, Bob Geldof is a scruffy, out-of-tune singer for an IrishNew Wave band, and the next is helming the Band Aid and Live Aid projects linkedto United Nations agendas in Africa ... then crops up as the public face ofSmart meters, professing how great it would be for everyone to have one in theirhome. This is why one minute, Jamie Oliver is a celebrity chef who’s never offthe telly, and appears to be an all-round great ‘geezer’ with his campaigns toget more healthy food into kids’ school dinners ... but the next is makingstatements about how he’s “super-excited” to be working with the Bill & MelindaGates Foundation on a “better food system” – almost certainly a reference tohuman health-damaging genetically modified organisms, if Gates’ links with theGMO monolith Monsanto is anything to go by.This is why actors like Ewan McGregor and Keeley Hawes are wheeled out as thepublic face of TV charity ads, imploring the general public to part with theircash to find solutions to problems that have been created by governments, all ofwhich could be eradicated overnight if the international banking cartels behindthem wished them to be. It’s why Lenny Henry has been the face of the BBC’sComic Relief project for years, (earning himself an OBE in the process,) whenthis charity has been investigated for its investments into tobacco and armscompanies. It’s why ‘Austin Powers’ actor Mike Myers was teamed up with KanyeWest to plead for public money on a telethon in the wake of the HurricaneKatrina disaster in New Orleans, (before everything went horribly wrong withKanye going off-script and declaring ‘George Bush doesn’t care about blackpeople.’ But that’s a whole different story as covered elsewhere!)These extra-curricular activities dovetail into another aspect of socialengineering too, which is the creation of fads and trends. Any time one of thesecomes along – involving the coerced participation of the public upon the say-soof some public figure – you can be sure it’s the creation of one of theculture-changing think-tanks. Few had heard of ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease,before it became the focal point of the Ice Bucket Challenge in the summer of2014. Upon the example of assorted celebrities, who had filmed themselvesdumping a bucket of ice-cold water over their heads, then challenging namedassociates to do the same, the trend went viral, with millions emulating theiridols. I don’t profess to know what the attraction was to the social engineersof having large numbers of people dousing themselves in this way, but therewould have been one. Quite simply, this fad would not have been so widespread ifthere weren’t.It was the same scenario when millions of women posed for a ‘self’ with a bottleof Coke between their breasts in 2015 to apparently “raise awareness of breastcancer,” when the faked ‘Kony 2012’ video went viral in that year, and when theNo Make-Up Selfie trend raised millions upon millions for Cancer Research UK,(which, like other cancer charities, purports to be ‘researching a cure’ in anindustry which relies on the constant flow of sufferers to maintain the billionsit generates every year, but which never goes anywhere near the many natural andherbal remedies which have been proven to be effective.) Then there was thePokemon Go ‘game’ fad of 2016, the main point of which was to further normaliseGPS surveillance, virtual reality and the Smart Grid, and which actually sawpeople walking off cliffs through their total engrossment in their phones anddetachment from their physical surroundings.A job well done all round.ANYONE FOR PIZZA?The extent to which so many celebrities are merely the stooges of those who tellthem what to do, appeared to be borne out in the wake of the ‘Pizzagate’ scandalwhich emerged in late 2016. This alluded to a child sex-trafficking ring centredaround Washington DC, involving some high-ranking names in politics. The scandalgave an insight into the dark underbelly of ‘elite’ society, and got its namefrom the food-related phrases apparently used by the pederasts to communicatewith each other, ‘pizza’ being code for a young girl. (Other phrases include‘hot dog’ to denote a young boy, and ‘chicken’ for a young child of either sex.How low can humanity go?) Citizen researchers began to pore over the evidencefor such paedophile networks, including many suspect works of ‘art’ involvingimages of pizza. A glance back at the output of a handful of corporate musicA-listers also threw up some unsettling results.In 2011, Lady Gaga had released a song titled ‘Pizza,’ whose toxic cesspit oflyrics included such lines as: “All we want is hot, hot, pizza, pizza, pizza,pizza. Pizza in my fucking shit.” A couple of years later, Katy Perry put outthe song ‘This Is How We Do.’ Its accompanying video, directed by New Zealandfilm-maker Joel Kefali, included items of food dancing around in animatedscenes, including slices of pizza. It may or may not be significant that one ofthe video’s brief settings is a ping-pong table, ‘ping-pong’ having beenidentified by the FBI as a code-phrase used by paedophiles to denote the passingaround of a child for sexual abuse. The name of the restaurant in DC aroundwhich the ‘Pizzagate’ allegations were centred, was Comet Ping-Pong Pizza.To promote these songs, both singers appeared in multiple publicity shotsshowing them indulging in the eating of pizza, and wearing dresses fashioned inthe form of the food. Gaga’s campaign included her declaring a ‘pizza partylive,’ while Perry compered a live event in which she invited children up onstage and spoke for several minutes about how much she loved pizza. Later, MileyCyrus and Justin Bieber were pictured together biting into slices of pizza. (Ifnothing else, this at least put paid to the persistent rumours that they are infact the same person!)[../images/00009.jpeg]The Ice Bucket Challenge: A masterclass in how to get large numbers of people toadopt a behaviour based on celebrity say-so.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiFile:Doing_the_ALS_Ice_Bucket_Challenge_(14927191426).jpg[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiFile:Doing_the_ALS_Ice_Bucket_Challenge_]Credit: slgckgcPerry was back for more with the video to her song ‘Bon Appetit’ in Spring 2017.By this point, she had adopted a new look consisting of closely-cropped blondehair. In the article titled ‘What Is Happening To Katy Perry?,’ the link towhich is in the Resources section at the end, researcher Vigilant Citizendiscussed how this look is used to denote newly-programmed mind-controlledslaves.Right at the same time, Justin Bieber appeared in the DJ Khaled video ‘I’m TheOne’ rocking the shaved blonde look, (made famous by Eminem from his initialbreakthrough, and interestingly, rocked by Mia Farrow’s character in the movie‘Rosemary’s Baby’ soon after she is ritually abused.) Kanye West had appearedwith his hair dyed peroxide-blonde shortly after his infamous ‘truth rant’ athis show in Sacramento of November 2016.The ‘Bon Appetit’ video, directed by the Paris/ Montreal-based film-makingcollective Dent De Cuir, sank to the very depths of sickness and depravity, asit portrayed Perry assuming the position of the female ‘cake’ which featured inthe ‘spirit cooking’ dinners hosted by witch Marina Abramović, details of whichwere closely linked to the ‘Pizzagate’ allegations. This video stands as ablatant mockery of these events, rubbing the noses of those who have done theresearch right in it, while going completely over the heads of everybody else.This was evidenced by the hundreds of thousands of ‘likes’ the video received onYouTube™, along with braindead comments along the lines of: “It’s really cool,lol!” The video also hints at cannibalism, as a group of chefs roll Perry inflour, then plunge her into a pot of boiling water along with variousvegetables.Was it pure coincidence – against all the odds – that these artists justhappened to employ pizza and ‘spirit cooking’ imagery in their songs and photos?Were they just making independent fashion statements? Or were these appearancesall co-ordinated, and intended as a sick mockery of institutionalisedpaedophilia – in some way foreshadowing the breaking of the ‘Pizzagate’ scandalin Predictive Programming fashion?THE MANUFACTURING OF ‘COOL’A textbook example of culture creation came from the movement dubbed ‘CoolBritannia’ in the mid-1990s, closely tied to the music genre that the mainstreammedia had dubbed ‘Britpop.’ The idea was that after years of stagnation, theBritish music industry was undergoing a creative resurgence led by the twodynamic bands of the time, Blur, (from the South, London) and Oasis, (from theNorth, Manchester.) The bands were pitted as rivals in much the same way thatthe Rolling Stones, (from the South, London,) and the Beatles, (from the North,Liverpool) had been in the 1960s. Given the evidence to show that all four bandswere highly cherished assets with ties to the Establishment and the world of theoccult, it becomes easy to see why they were chosen to herald in the respectivesocietal changes they helped foment.The campaign that led to Tony Blair’s election victory for his New Labour partyin May 1997, had much invested in the ‘Cool Britannia’ concept that Blur andOasis symbolised. Blair’s spin doctors had cultivated an image of him as adynamic, visionary leader very much in touch with the youth culture of his land.He took care to be seen playing guitar in TV appearances and talked of havingbeen in bands himself – a far cry from the grey, austere image of his opponent,John Major. There were even reports of Blair having smoked cannabis in hisyounger years. Right on, dude!Blair threw a reception party at 10 Downing Street in July of 1997, to which anumber of ‘cool’ cultural icons were invited. The most famous image from thisevent is of Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher sipping champagne and chattinggood-naturedly with Blair – a far cry from his own ‘rebellious’ Rock ’n’ Rollimage. By 2003, when Blair had co-launched the post-9/11 military incursionsinto Iraq and Afghanistan, the British public’s opinion of him had switcheddramatically, the tag of ‘war criminal’ being frequently applied. In 2011, theKuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission in Malaysia found Blair and George W. Bushguilty of crimes against humanity. Despite this, in 2013, Noel Gallagher wasstill voicing his admiration for Blair in an interview for ‘The New Statesman,’(which was being edited at the time by his friend Russell Brand,) and in a 2016‘Daily Mail’ interview, recalled Blair’s years in office as “amazing.”(By way of some brief background, Blair took leadership of the Labour party in1994 following the very sudden and unexpected death of its previous leader, JohnSmith, of reported heart failure. In each of the years he was elected orre-elected, Blair presided over a major public event; in 1997, it was the suddenand unexpected death of Princess Diana; in 2001, it was the events and aftermathof 9/11; in 2005, it was the events and aftermath of the 7/7 attacks in London.When Labour minister and leader of the House of Commons, Robin Cook, resigned inprotest at the Blair government’s launching of the Iraq War ... he died suddenlyand unexpectedly of reported heart failure while on a walking holiday in aremote part of Scotland. When Dr. David Kelly, the weapons inspector who hadbeen cited as a source for Blair’s claim that Saddam Hussein was in possessionof ‘Weapons of Mass Destruction,’ revealed that this information was in factfalse ... he died suddenly and unexpectedly while out walking in Oxfordshirewoodland, with the official verdict of ‘suicide.’)It becomes interesting at this juncture to study some aspects of both Blur andOasis. Some examination of the imagery on Oasis’s key album sleeves yields somecuriosities. 1994’s ‘Definitely Maybe’ sports a massive globe floating ominouslyin a living room. On 1997’s ‘Be Here Now’ a toy globe makes a re-appearance,this time being viewed by a band member through a telescope. Another album showsa landscape encased within a dome, meanwhile. How interesting that it’s titled‘Don’t Believe The Truth.’ ‘Standing On The Shoulder Of Giants’ shows a New YorkCity skyline obliterated by chemtrails.Oasis first signed to the Creation Records label in 1993. Creation was foundedby Alan McGee, an occultist, and yet another industry figure to have expressed areverence for the Thelema teachings of Aleister Crowley, (falls back inamazement.) In an interview with the ‘Dangerous Minds’ website, he stated: “Forthe last five years, I have been studying Crowley, Osman Spare and the chaosmagickians. I got into Crowley because everybody told me not to go there. So ofcourse, I did, and ended up at chaos magick. I 100% love Aleister Crowley. ‘TheBook of the Law’ is my Bible. I love him.” McGee produced the movie ‘Kubricks,’said to be a tribute to the satanic film-maker and fellow Crowleyite KennethAnger. The film’s tagline was “Everything Is Synchronicity ... Even Chaos!”Noel’s brother, Liam Gallagher, appears in a photograph available on-line whichhe possibly now regrets. He is sat with Jimmy Savile and is flashing the ‘devilhorns,’ which are discussed at length in Chapter 5.Blur co-founder Damon Albarn subsequently formed the ‘virtual’ alternative groupGorillaz, (whose titles have included ‘Demon Days’ and ‘Sex Murder Party,’)their gimmick being that they appear only as animated avatars living in a‘fictional universe,’ and have performed concerts in the form ofdigitally-generated holograms. The Gorillaz imagery is tied to the slow-drip ofArtificial Intelligence into the public consciousness, with things really comingto a head on their 2017 album titled – perhaps ironically – ‘Human.’ In aninterview with the ‘NME’ at the time of its release, the band spoke of theirenthusiasm for virtual characters being able to tour and make music for themwith no need for any human input. Albarn stated: “If it works well, then in 20years’ time, there might be a completely holographic Glastonbury.”Despite apparently being an outspoken anti-war activist, Damon Albarn acceptedan Order of the British Empire in the Queen’s 2016 Honours ... which could beviewed as a slightly out-of-character thing to do given that the Queen is thefigurehead for one of the most murderous colonial empires in human history,responsible for the subjugation by military force of countless foreign lands.DYSTOPIA AWAITSAs aspect of the gradual changing of attitudes straight out of the socialengineering textbooks, is one that is very often missed. This is the rapidadvancement that human society has taken towards the Transhumanist future thathas been in the sights of the manipulators for so long. When it comes to thetype of society that we’re now all able to recognise, it’s shocking to reflectthat it was depicted as long ago as 1927 in German film-maker Fritz Lang’siconic ‘Metropolis.’ Equally shocking is that this ‘futuristic’ storyline wasset 100 years into the future, so is now only a few years away. The plot depictsa cityscape greatly reliant on technology, in which the elite class reside inskyscrapers, while the working-class keep the city functioning by toiling inharsh underground facilities. As the workers show signs of being close torevolt, the elites elect to send a robot modelled on Maria, the workers’ defacto leader, into their ranks to mediate. Societal chaos ensues.The imagery of ‘Metropolis’ has been evoked through the decades by artists suchas Madonna, Lady Gaga and Beyonce, and notably by Queen in the video to their‘Radio Gaga.’ A retouched version of the originally silent film was released in1984 (of all years,) with a soundtrack by Italian producer Giorgio Moroder.Images of this same ‘dystopian’ society have been subliminally fed into thepublic mindset through countless movies in the interim, from ‘The Terminator’ to‘Robocop’ to ’TXH 1138’ to ‘The Hunger Games’ to ‘Logan’s Run.’ There’s a goodreason why the phone-type is called ‘Android’.It becomes clear – particularly when you factor in the concept of PredictiveProgramming discussed at length in the last book – that the technologicalsociety we now have has been in the plans of the culture creators for a verylong time. It was addressed strikingly by rapper Nas, (frequently rumoured to bea Freemason,) on the track ‘New World’ from his ‘Nastradamus’ album, releasedjust prior to the new millennium. Among the song’s references are:“solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive,” “while thepoor people starve, computers taking over they jobs,” “new cameras in policecars taking pictures,” “covertly starting wars, CIA, Navy Seals,” and “yourgenes and DNA is used to make clones.” In some parts of the track, Nas appearsto be suspicious of new technology, but elsewhere appears to be embracing it,with lines like: “Say hello to the one world,” and “I might be old fashioned,stuck in my ways, but nothing makes me more happier than seeing today.”It’s equally clear that the Futurists are far from finished, as every passingweek sees new pieces of the picture towards a fusion between humanity andtechnology, and a complete shift away from natural, organic ways of life.Because these steps are presented to the public as something which is “great,”“cool,” or which can really benefit their lives, (“who wants the hassle ofremembering your wallet when you could just pay for everything with a microchipunder your skin?”; “why bother reading old-fashioned paper maps when you canjust have your car tell you where to go?”,) so much of what’s been achieved hasbeen done with little-to-no resistance from the public.[../images/00010.jpeg]A poster for Fritz Lang’s Metropolis from 1927, an alarmingly accurate‘prediction’ of the futurist society which is becoming more recognisable withevery passing day.https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7462/15513625249_0df14c8c6b_b.jpg[https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7462/15513625249_0df14c8c6b_b.jpg]Credit: Breve Storia del CinemaYet, while we were asleep at the wheel, in the course of no more than twodecades, our daily existence is now engulfed in a quagmire of wi-fi and cellphone signals, and micro and radio-waves, all emitting electro-magneticfrequencies that penetrate our brains and bodies 24/7, and whose long-termhealth implications cannot yet be understood. And the rapid onset of the SmartGrid, through ‘smart’ meters, TVs, phones, cars, motorways and cities, is onlygoing to take this further. Reliance on technology has been so firmly ingrainedinto our daily lives that many young people – always the prime targets of suchchanges – are unable to get from one hour to the next without handling everyaspect of their lives on their mobile phones or tablets.An aspect of how this move in particular has been achieved, involves anotherfactor that is so rarely considered or discussed. This is the dwindlingattention-spans – particularly in the under-30s – that has been cultivated inthe past few years. Someone unable to hold and develop a thought for more than afew seconds – and who is swamped with things to do and think about at everystage of their day – is someone unlikely to apply critical thought to importantlife issues, such as scrutinising what the mainstream media tells us about aparticular news story, questioning the illusory nature of ‘money,’ or the verynature of this existence and our place in it. It is into this scenario that theadvent of concentration-distracting on-line sites and applications such asInstagram, Snapchat and Twitter play their part.Instagram’s aim is in its name; users are pressurised into documenting everyinstant of their day, and the minute they post a picture – or record a fewseconds of footage – the pressure is there to do it again, as the last one isnow old-hat. Then, Twitter’s 140-character limit has had its role, since nomeaningful message that says anything worthwhile can really be communicated withsuch restrictions, (though the limit has recently been doubled to 280characters.)So users are stifled in their capacity for expression, but still feel compelledto be constantly posting stuff because everybody else is. And all the time thenotion that “technology is so cool” is being instilled into the impressionableminds of the young to the point that any other way of getting through the day,like their parents’ generation did, is unthinkable without such accessories. Ageneration groomed in this kind of mindset is going to be a far easier one tosell ideas like brain implants, microchips, Smart Grids and a cashless societyto, than one which can remember different ways of doing things. When majorsocietal changes are introduced in increments, a population entrained inshortened attention spans, is unlikely to recall more than two or threeincrements into the past with any great clarity. And people who can’t hold athought for more than a few seconds are so much easier to control.That’s engineering.THE ASSAULT ON ATTENTIONAn alternative aspect of the above harks back to my previous existence as a clubDJ, playing gigs every weekend for over 20 years. I highlighted aspects of thisrather glibly in my book ‘Tales From The Flipside.’ But there’s a seriouselement to some of the amusing anecdotes conveyed. A few years in, I’d alreadystarted to notice the changing attitudes of clubbers towards what was beingplayed by the DJ. When I started out, it was fairly easy to take a crowd on amusical ‘journey,’ (to re-use that old chestnut,) and in most cases, peoplewould allow themselves to be led wherever you chose to take them, on the basisthat this is your specialist area and you know what you’re doing.As the years went by and the proliferation of mobile phones in clubs increased,however, I noticed a marked difference in how punters were responding to tunesthat were played. The initial whoops and cheers that would accompany a track thesecond its opening bars were recognised were still there. But whereas previouslya crowd would have danced enthusiastically to such a song for a good three tofour minutes, now it was becoming clear that people would lose interest after 30seconds to a minute. The energetic dance moves would become more lacklustre, andfaces would disappear into phones. DJs use their well-honed instinct to assess acrowd’s mood. The only way to re-generate the vibe would be to quickly bring inthe next song. Again, whoops and cheers, then the loss of interest within half aminute. (Readers may be familiar with the internet meme that shows a group ofyoung people sat on the sidelines in a club, staring individually at their phonescreens with the accompanying caption: “Great party!’)Here, we have a symptom of the instant gratification that the youthfulgeneration has been conditioned to expect. Because everything is now soinstantly available at all times and in all places – and because there’s such aplethora of options vying for the attention at any given time – attention spanshave been reduced to farcical levels. And in the DJ world, this dynamic has notbeen helped by another expression of the electronic society ... the almost totalmove towards DJ sets now being delivered off laptops, through programmes such asSerato and Traktor. Whereas DJs in the vinyl era would exhibit some skill inorganising their records and knowing where to find a particular tune, becausethe next song is now no more than a couple of mouse-clicks away, the temptationto throw on one tune after another in rapid succession, with minimal effort, isgenerally indulged. And the talent that vinyl DJs used to need to perform asmooth mix by matching the beats of two records by ear, has also been usurped bylaptop culture, with many DJs now setting their programmes to beat-match andsequence tracks for them.Previously, a good DJ would spend much of their free time hunting for elusivetunes – often on overseas imports in record shops – and would impress clubgoersby their knack of playing tracks that other DJs had not been able to acquire.Reputations were built upon it. Now, because anyone can get access to anything,it’s rendered the identity of DJs completely irrelevant in the minds of thefickle, socially-engineered youth. Now, a DJ is just some random cunt with alaptop, and I can tell you from experience that anyone not of god-like A-liststatus like David Guetta or Paul Van Dyk, gets treated with the low level ofrespect and politeness that such perceptions bring.This is all part of the long-planned, slow-drip effect of homogenisingeverything in culture – making everything generic, bland and commodified; ofstamping out individual identity and character. Put into its wider context, it’san expression of the cultural-Marxist society and hive mentality the controllersare rapidly working towards, where the populace are instructed in how to thinkand behave and what to like, and individual expression is made a social crime. Irealise I’m going on a rant here, and if I bemoan the state of ‘kids today’ muchmore I’ll run the risk of sounding like my Dad 30 years ago. But I hope readerswill permit this brief blowing-off of steam, and also recognise the relevance ofthese observations.That’s engineering.NORMALISING NARCISSISMUnsurprisingly, television has played its own vital role in subliminally shapingpublic attitudes – particularly in the years since the millennium. It was in2000 that the advent of ‘reality TV’ hit Britain in the form of ‘Big Brother.’(Its name being lifted straight from the pages of Orwell’s dystopian ‘1984’ wasno accident.) Because it was launched in a fanfare of hype as “the next bigthing,” it became just that as the public reacted – utterly predictably –exactly as the creators knew they would. This show, and others that followed inthe same genre, normalised the idea of being constantly surveilled, making it‘cool.’ It also played on the contestants’ narcissistic tendencies, the one whomost pandered to the public and garnered their approval being the winner whowalked away with the cash prize. Just the fact that this format has now beenrolled out in many other territories outside Britain, is enough to show it’sfulfilling a culture-shaping agenda, rather than being simple fodder to fill TVtimeslots.British TV in the new millennium also popularised ruthlessness through the ‘TheWeakest Link’ quiz show, where contestants’ psychopathic qualities would berewarded as they were goaded into doing each other down in order to become thewinner. Everyone else was dismissed heartlessly by host Anne Robinson with thephrase “you leave with nothing. Goodbye!”, all reinforcing the message thatlife’s winners are the ones who look out for number one, and tread all overeverybody else to get to the top. Ideological Satanism by any other name. Thesame harsh competitiveness – though masquerading as a more friendly type ofcompetition – is now pushed through contests like ‘Masterchef’ and ‘The GreatBritish Bake-Off.’That’s engineering.HEROES AND VILLAINSThe public is entrained to think of its military intelligence agencies asbenevolent organisations that are out to keep us all safe, when – a recurringfactor in this satanically-inverted world – the opposite is actually the case.It has been proven beyond any reasonable doubt, that it is the intel operationsof mainly Britain, the US and Israel, who have been behind so many of theattacks on their own citizens blamed on “terrorist” organisations such as ISIS.If this revelation is news to anyone reading this, they are strongly advised tolook at the work of Ole Dammegard at http://www.lightonconspiracies.com[http://www.lightonconspiracies.com], who demonstrates with great flair howthese events are carried off.The apparent benign nature of operations such as the CIA, MI6 and Mossad, isreinforced in the public mindset through popular culture, and much of theseorganisations’ real activity involves cultivating these very perceptions aboutthemselves! Ian Fleming’s James Bond stories have played a huge role in thisprocess. The subject of bloodlines and heraldry is addressed in both the bookand film version of the Bond story ‘On Her Majesty’s Secret Service,’ in whicharch-villain Blofeld hires a genealogist to authenticate his claim to being adescendant of the aristocratic Bleauchamp dynasty. (Fleming himself wasdescended from an aristocratic bloodline.)For his part, Bond is portrayed as a noble and patriotic hero, on ‘our’ side,and always out to protect us from harm at the hands of dastardly villains. Butif we’re really honest with ourselves, James Bond is anything but a hero and isactually a deeply immoral person. He works for an organisation which, inreality, is involved in covering up institutionalised paedophilia, he is anorder-follower – killing others on the say-so of somebody deemed to be moreimportant than him by virtue of their job title – and he carries out suchexecutions without ever stopping to question the morality of the situation, orif one human being ever has the inherent right to kill another outside ofself-defence. This is one of the worst places spiritually that an individual canbe – in total denial of how Natural Law works, and creating chaos and violencein the world, as a result of failing to take personal responsibility for one’sactions and moral behaviour. Accepting the true nature of Bond has been anotherextremely bitter pill for me to swallow personally, as I loved the books andfilms as a kid. But letting go of one’s heroes is par for the course in theprocess of genuine acceptance of truth.NO MORE HEROESMy job – and that of the other researchers in this field who try to communicatethe truth about manufactured public ‘heroes’ – is an unpopular one. It’s no funto hear that someone you’ve looked up to and admired for many years – and whomay have inspired you greatly – is not who you thought they were, and probablydidn’t get to the top the way you’ve always thought. Often, the individualcommunicating these uncomfortable truths will get viciously attacked by thosetheir words offend. I speak from experience. I get the objection, because I’vebeen through the process myself of having to re-assess many of the individualswho had previously been role models to me. Besides other DJs and musicians,there have even been a few speakers in the ‘truth’ arena whose motives and truenature I’ve had to reconsider upon the emergence of new information.What becomes clear – having gone through a few such devastating realisations –is that it’s a mistake to actually have any heroes at all. None of us reallyknow the popular figures we look up to, and because we don’t, therein lies theconstant possibility that they may at some point disappoint us. Instead, weshould be our own heroes in recognition of our own unlimited potential to changethings around us by way of our will, intent and chosen behaviours. We mightdoubt the motives of others, but we never have to doubt our own.As Jan Irvin, who has put more work than most into uncovering the truebackgrounds of many cultural icons observes, everyone has someone about whomthey just don’t want to hear it. They may accept that every other name is dirtyin some way – but not their personal holy cow. Surely not them? Myself and theothers doing this work aren’t out to try and piss on peoples’ parades andtarnish their perceptions of their personal heroes for shits and giggles. We’resimply interested in uncovering, and then communicating the truth wherever wefind it. A general rule of thumb with which you’ll never go far wrong, is thatcelebrities are not your friends. They’re not there to enrich or better yourlife in any way, but rather to influence it in line with covert agendas createdby somebody else. People can either accept this, or reject it out of hand, butit continues to be the truth of the matter either way.On that note, by the way, I certainly don’t advocate throwing out all your oldalbums and never listening to certain artists again. Music can still be enjoyedat face value, once an understanding of how artists are used for certain agendasis understood. When that stuff is all out of the subconscious mind and into theconscious, where it can be properly processed and critically analysed, it losesits controlling power. A great tune is still a great tune, regardless of thecircumstances in which it was created, and Beatles, Doors and Rolling Stonesalbums will always remain classics, in spite of what we now know about how thesegroups came into their influential positions. One reason why people still hankernostalgically towards the music of previous decades, is that contemporary outputis just so fucking dire – straight satanic at best, and stupefyingly bland andunmemorable at worst. Today’s A-list acts will have done well to still be talkedabout with fondness in five years, let alone 50.For those actively seeking meaningful message music, however, from artists freeof any such corporate shackles, I recommend seeking out some of the upliftingindependent material that’s still, thankfully, being made by artists with mindsto call their own, and the freedom to express it openly. You can always tellthese musicians – they’re the ones who have a burning spirit of conviction aboutthem and make little to no money as a result! It’s my pleasure to put togetherregular showcases of such artists – both old and new – in my ongoing ‘The SoundOf Freedom’ conscious music podcasts. See the Resources section at the end forthe link to these.Even those who are thought of first and foremost as activists andfreedom-fighters – rather than as any other kind of celebrity – can turn out tobe tainted by dubious connections, so far do the tentacles of deception reach.As radio host and independent researcher Randy Maugans commented in discussionof these subjects:“Even the ‘anti-war movement’ was an invention of intelligence operations. Themajor groups, like SDS, the Weather Underground, Black Panthers, and later,Symbionese Liberation Front, were funded by the Establishment. The purposes arefound in the Communist Manifesto and documents released by government agencies,as well as some former activists like Mark Rudd, Jerry Rubin, and the book ‘TheStrawberry Statement.’ John Lennon and Yoko Ono also played key roles asintelligence operatives in creating the movements. Lennon befriended and fundedradical activist Jerry Rubin.”(On the subject of Yoko Ono, incidentally, isn’t it interesting that both sheand Linda McCartney, (nee Eastman,) happened to live for a time in the town ofScarsdale in Westchester County, New York? Linda attended Scarsdale High School,while Yoko’s family moved over from Japan in the early 1950s, and she laterjoined them there. What are the odds of two future Beatles wives – of all theplaces they could have been in the world – both setting up home in the samesmall town? This raises some interesting questions about what’s so special aboutScarsdale, of course, which has also been home to a number of other musicians,actors, writers and directors.)*When you learn about how Lifetime Actors and culture creation work, the questionbecomes – are you happy you were duped and taken into confidence by thesepeople, and would you like more of it? Or are you rather hacked off that youwere treated as such easy fodder, rife for manipulation, and now that youunderstand how the game is played, do you resolve to never be fooled in the sameway again? There’s no shame in admitting that you were bamboozled. All of us arefrom the earliest age. The dignity comes from acknowledging that it happened andknowing better for next time.As Jan Irvin observed when guesting on episode 672 of James Corbett’s ‘TheCorbett Report’ podcast:“Ten years ago, I released 70 hours of Terence McKenna audio to the internet.And now, in hindsight, I’m looking at all of his research and everything, going‘my god, look what he was into!’“So it’s my duty – having discovered that I was mind-controlled myself – to putthis information out there to help others. And they may hate me for it in theinterim. But I think that the people who take the time to actually read theinformation and look at it closely will find it very liberating, because it’smuch easier to spend a few hours or days or weeks researching facts, than it isto spend a lifetime believing lies.”"},{"pageContent":"Resources:’65 to ’69: The Soundtrack to a Masterclass in Culture-Creation’:On the basis that music speaks louder than words, a while ago I put together thefollowing story of five era-defining years as told by the music, with a fewaudio snippets from some key events along the way.

GOODNIGHTHow Punk and New Wave kept the counter-culture control grid moving on.“Come, mothers and fathers across the land,Well, don’t criticise what you can’t understand,Your sons and your daughters are beyond your command,Your old road is rapidly ageing,Please stay off of the new one if you can’t lend a hand,‘Cause the times they are a-changin’.”Bob Dylan: ‘Times They are A-Changin’ (1965)“New York to East California,There’s a New Wave coming, I warn ya.”Kim Wilde: ‘Kids In America’ (1981)“No more heroes any more,No more heroes any more.”The Stranglers: ‘No More Heroes’ (1977)The degree to which the counter-culture of the ‘60s was steered by the militaryintelligence and social engineering communities is now well-documented. The workof the late author and researcher Dave McGowan, and more recently, that of JanIrvin on the Gnostic Media broadcasts, has shown how, time and time again, keyplayers turn out to have family links back into these worlds, usually throughtheir fathers.With regard to the findings of McGowan in his ‘Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon’book, if it had just been a handful of musicians’ fathers who had high-rankingmilitary connections, it could be reasonably written-off as ‘coincidence,’‘synchronicity,’ or its more fortuitous cousin, ‘serendipity.’ It’s the samewith the migration of artists to the restricted Laurel Canyon neighbourhood. Aragtag bunch of them from here and there could be explained away innocentlyenough. But the mass influx from all over the US, Canada and beyond – asdetailed in McGowan’s work – goes way beyond the realms of pure chance. Then,when you factor in the ominous presence of the Lookout Mountain Laboratorypresiding over the whole community, and couple that with the military familybackgrounds of almost all the players on the scene, it would take a very heavystate of denial not to recognise, in the words of Buffalo Springfield, that“there’s something happening here, what it is ain’t exactly clear.”And even if the endless examples of Establishment meddling in this particularera could be written off as a series of ‘coincidences,’ when the very sameclues, fingerprints and calling-cards then crop up in the scene which prettymuch replaces it a decade or so later, the claim that it’s mere happenstancereally does start to crumble under the spotlight of scrutiny. The same scenespawning its own Theosophical movement, and having links to occult secretsocieties, Ivy League academia, former US presidents and even serial killers,only serves to make it yet more intriguing.Could a reader of my last book have been on the right track when he got in touchto comment?:“My ideas are that they have musical styles and associated cultures ready toreel out at different periods to fit in with the technology, drugs, and socialattitudes of the time; psychedelic music for the 60s, Rock and Punk for the 70s,House music for the 80s, Drum & Bass for the 90s, etc, etc.”PUNKS JUMP UP TO GET BEAT DOWNEarly Punk Rock came largely out of New York City, and specifically, theGreenwich Village area of Manhattan, and was influenced by the Beat poet scenewhich had flourished there from the 1940s onward, populated by the likes ofAllen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Lucien Carr and William Burroughs. Research hasshown how these characters were connected back into such dubious walks of lifeas military intelligence, social engineering think-tanks, dark occult mysteryschools, secret society fraternities, MK-Ultra mind control andinstitutionalised paedophilia in a vast interconnected web, (is there any otherkind?) Punk, in turn, birthed the scene known as New Wave which followed.Over in the UK, meanwhile, the British take on Punk is acknowledged to havemorphed out of the pub-rock scene in and around London. A youthful generationalienated both by harsh social conditions, and the pretentious andself-satisfied ’prog-rock’ scene of the mid-70s, channelled their angst intoangry, energy-charged music with a DIY ethos that eschewed the industry rulebook. The scene was spearheaded by the Sex Pistols under the calculated controlof their dominant manager Malcolm McLaren, of whom, more later. And, as somedelving into the finer detail shows, there seems to be more than just luckytiming at play here.WHAT’S IN A NAME?On the grounds that etymology can be so revealing, and observing that the truthof a matter is often placed in plain sight, Jan Irvin and Joe Atwill beganEpisode 54 of their ‘Unspun’ radio show by defining the word ‘punk.’ It’sreasonable to assume, after all, that any clues as to a genre’s true nature maybe found in its very name. Various official definitions include: “A young manused as a homosexual partner, especially in prison;” “an aggressive and violentyoung man;” “an inexperienced young person;” “a cowardly or weak young man;” “aninferior, rotten, worthless person or thing;” “a petty criminal or hoodlum.”Hardly flattering terms for a tribe of music fans to identity themselves with.And the serial killer in the ‘Dirty Harry’ movie, sneeringly derided by ClintEastwood as a ‘punk’ in 1971, makes for a similarly dubious role model.To ‘punk’ someone, meanwhile, is defined as: “To humiliate, to dupe or deceive,to play a practical joke on.” Does this reveal the way the manipulators of thisscene really felt, in their mocking arrogance, towards those they had in theirsights? The same principle is at play with the words ‘hippie’ and ‘hipster,’incidentally, both of which derive from the days of opium dens when addictswould lie on their hips smoking on a pipe, and with obsessives of the(CIA-created) Grateful Dead being referred to, none-too-flatteringly, as‘deadheads’ – a giveaway as to the value their controllers really placed onthem.[../images/00011.jpeg]The front facade of the infamous CBGB punk nightspot in New York City’s Bowerydistrict.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBGB#/media/File:CBGB_club_facade.jpg[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBGB#/media/File:CBGB_club_facade.jpg]Credit: Adam Di Carlo at English WikipediaThe kingpins of the Beat movement, who had such an influence on both thecounter-culture hippies and the first Punks, have some red flag-raisingbackgrounds in themselves. Arguably the best-known was Allen Ginsberg, ahomosexual, suspected CIA agent, alleged paedophile, and a proud member ofNAMBLA, (the North American Man/Boy Love Association,) which advocates for thedecriminalisation of male adults having sex with male children, and campaignsfor the release of imprisoned paedophiles. Equally influential on the Beat scenewas William S Burroughs, whose legend earned him a place as one of the ‘heroes’of the Beatles on their ‘Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band’ album sleeve.Burroughs was a heroin and morphine addict who shot dead his second wife JoanVollmer Adams in a stunt gone wrong, but avoided any long-term jail time. Quitethe hero.The way the word came to be associated with the music is considered to involve ajournalist by the name of Roderick McNeil, nicknamed ‘Legs,’ who was one of thefounders of the ‘Punk’ fanzine, first published in New York in 1975. The term‘Punk Rock’ had been coined by writers on ‘Creem’ magazine before, but McNeiland his colleagues, John Holmstrom and Ged Dunn, further popularised its usage.They were influenced by the music of Iggy Pop & The Stooges, The Ramones and TheDictators, and the term became associated with these acts. McNeil commented thatthe name was chosen because it “seemed to sum up ... everything ... obnoxious,smart but not pretentious, absurd, ironic, and things that appealed to thedarker side.” He claimed to have lifted the word from an episode of the TVdetective show ‘Kojak,’ in which Telly Savalas’ character utters the phrase ‘youlousy punk!’In its nascent years, the New York scene was very much centred around a livemusic venue in Manhattan’s East Village known as CBGB, (standing for Country,Blue Grass & Blues.) The club had morphed from a run-down Hell’s Angels biker’sbar at its 1973 outset, into a hotbed for the movers and shakers of Punk and NewWave, the likes of The Ramones, Television, the Patti Smith Group, Blondie, andTalking Heads regularly playing there. Although the venue closed its doors in2006, its legacy lived on through a CBGB radio show launched on the iheartradioplatform in 2010, with music festivals under the CBGB banner beginning in 2012.CONNECTIONS FOR DAYSNino Teuoneaux, (pronounced two-one-oh,) is one of a number of citizenresearchers who started out as music fans or musicians, but have more recentlybecome independent investigators into the genres they have always loved. In themajority of cases, everything they pull together has long been in the publicdomain. It’s not until this information is collated and cross-referenced, thatclues and patterns start to form. Nino has presented much of his data on the‘Hoax Busters Call’ radio show, whose host John Adams has also got into thisarea of research. Nino guested on my ‘Good Vibrations’ podcast in 2016 to sharehis extensive findings into Punk and New Wave’s unexpected connections. As hecommented:“It’s an intertwining network ... It’s a network of a lot of people coming outof a bloodline distinction, or wealth, and they just keep the ball amongstthemselves and don’t really share it too often unless there’s an extraordinaryartist, it seems.“Another pattern I’m recognising in aggregating this information, is theunbalanced proportion of people that went to Harvard – in bands, controllingbands, around bands. There’s definitely a Harvard music language as a Liberallink.”The findings of Nino and fellow researcher Masonic Youth, bring a plethora ofdubious links and unsettling alliances. Hold tight as we embark on a dizzyingrollercoaster ride of fascinating information.The deep background of New Wavers Talking Heads stands as a great startingpoint. Alongside singer David Byrne, (himself an adherent of both the Church ofSubgenius and Santeria religions,) and guitarist Jerry Harrison, the Headsconsisted of husband-and-wife couple Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth, (who alsofronted the Talking Heads spin-off group Tom Tom Club.)Tina Weymouth’s brother, Yann, (a Harvard graduate, naturally,) turns out tohave been Chief of Design for the Chinese-American architect I.M Pei on theGrand Louvre Project in Paris, involving the placement of the iconic glasspyramid. The family’s Masonic links seem to be represented here, given thesymbolism incorporated into the Louvre and into one of the most Masonic citieson Earth. Yann also designed the Salvador Dali Museum and the National Galleryof Art in Washington DC, and was awarded The National Order of Merit fromFrance.Yann and Tina’s father, Ralph Weymouth, was a Vice Admiral of the US Navy and aMaster of the Freemason Grand Lodge of Maine. Their great-grandfather,meanwhile, was Anatole Le Braz, known as the Bard of Brittany, a highly-regardedfolklore poet and a lecturer at Harvard and Yale Universities. Anatole marriedMabel Davidson, the sister to Henry Pomeroy Davison, which brings a link to theYale secret society Skull & Bones. Henry was a senior partner of the bankingmonolith JP Morgan, worked with the Astor Place Bank, and was instrumental inthe creation of the Federal Reserve System, attending the notorious 1910 meetingat Jekyll Island, (though Wikipedia describes him as a ‘philanthropist!’)Chris’ brother Roddy Frantz was also in a band, known as The Urban Verbs. Theirfather was a teacher at The Judges Advocate General’s Legal Centre & School – amilitary academy. Chris was born at Fort Campbell military base in Kentucky,becoming a Harvard alumni with his tuition paid for by the army. He was alsostationed at The Pentagon.Like Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz, the two principal members ofBlondie – Debbie Harry and Chris Stein- were also a couple, (though they didn’tmarry.) Prior to her days with the group, Harry worked as a waitress in one ofthe original Playboy nightclubs. Gloria Steinem, touted as the mother of thefeminist movement, went undercover as a Playboy Bunny during her days as ajournalist, resulting in her celebrated ’exposé’ article of 1963. It hasrecently emerged that Steinem was an asset of the CIA, (the feminist movementhaving been manipulated at the hands of Abby Rockefeller,) calling into questionthe authenticity of the socially-changing movement that she spawned. The rabbitears worn by the Playboy bunnies are said to indicate the presence ofmind-control programming, in much the same way as the wearing of Mickey Mouseears by many Disney-groomed pop stars does.Debbie Harry, meanwhile, cropped up as a guest at the ‘spirit cooking’ dinnersof the witch/ ‘performance artist’ Marina Abramović in late 2016. Harry waspictured plunging a knife into the breast area of a cake that has been fashionedin the shape of a woman’s body, in a ritual derived from the sex magickpractices of Aleister Crowley. Gwen Stefani and Lady Gaga are among other starsknown to associate with Abramović and to attend her ‘dinners.’ Abramović hasalso been named as a ‘spiritual advisor’ to Jay-Z, (who donated money to her‘art institute,’) as well as to Usher and Kim Kardashian, among others.In a loose link between Punk and serial killers, meanwhile, Debbie Harry claimedthat she almost became a murder victim of Ted Bundy, having accepted a lift fromhim in New York in the 1970s and narrowly escaping from his car when he startedacting strangely.In 2017, Harry revealed that she had discovered Scottish ancestry on the part ofher birth mother. She was adopted and raised by Richard and Catherine Harry whenshe was three months old, but had been born Angela Trimble. Her mother’s maidenname, she told the ‘Scottish Sun’ newspaper, was Mackenzie. The Mackenzies areone of the principal clans (bloodlines) of Scotland.The Punk/ serial killer connections aren’t quite over yet. One further one isrevealed in Maury Terry’s book ‘Ultimate Evil,’ and involves the murder of NewYork photographer/ pornographer Ron Sisman and his partner Elizabeth Platzman intheir Manhattan apartment on Halloween 1981. The two hitmen involved were foundto have been hired by a felon named Jesse Turner, all over a snuff movie whichSisman had allegedly filmed, and Turner had been ordered to retrieve. The snufffilm is said to have shown the final murder committed by David Berkowitz, betterknown as the serial killer Son Of Sam. Terry’s book quotes Berkowitz as sayingthat three people were in a van across the street when he committed his lastshooting in Brooklyn, (one was Sisman,) and had captured it on tape. He added:“some famous artist wanted that to sell to a collector for about $50,000.”And the Punk connection comes from the artist in question being named as RobertMapplethorpe, a homo-erotic photographer and sculptor ... who was the one-timepartner of influential New York punker Patti Smith! Jesse Turner and DavidBerkowitz have both been connected to the Process Church of the Final Judgement,a spin-off cult of Scientology, with further links to the music industry asdetailed in the last book. The Son of Sam murders are claimed to have beendirectly commissioned by the Process Church, and carried out by others besidesBerkowitz. Robert Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in 1989.The third serial killer link identified by Nino comes from the hardcore Punkoutfit The Cro Mags. Group singer John Joseph, who has spoken of being sexuallymolested while in foster ‘care,’ – a shockingly common claim amongmusicians – noted in an interview that he had known the notorious murderer JoelRifkin, currently serving a 203-year sentence for the killings of nine women.One of Rifkin’s victims was a prostitute named Tiffany Bresciani, who was datingDave Rubinstein, the singer from another hardcore band called Reagan Youth.Following the murder of Tiffany and the death of his mother in a car accident,Rubinstein overdosed on heroin and died aged 28.Joseph stated:“As a matter of fact, I knew the whole Reagan Youth crew and that fucking guy,Joel Rifkin. I remember when Dave’s girlfriend got murdered. That was the bodywrapped up in a tarp that they found when they busted him. He was going to dumpit in Long Island. But I know Dave. Me, Dave, and HR from Bad Brains in ‘81 hadan organization called the UFF – United Freedom Fighters. I knew Dave before hestarted getting high. Great, great guy, but shit happens. God rest his soul.”Joel Rifkin, when not raping and murdering, just happened to become a landscapegardener to Sophia Casey, the widow of the former CIA director William Casey.John Joseph himself went on to embrace the Krishna movement, a look andphilosophy which strongly influenced the future direction of the Cro Mags,spawning a Punk spin-off genre known as Krishnacore.On to Cro Mags bassist Harley Flanagan, then. His mother, Rose Feliu Pettet,seems to have been something of a rock groupie with the likes of the New YorkDolls and Velvet Underground, and hung out at Andy Warhol’s Factory studiobefore becoming the ‘spiritual wife’ to the occultist Harry Everett Smith.Smith was a member of the Ordo Templi Orientis, which itself seems to have astrange, magnetic-like lure for music-makers and celebrities. Everett Smith wasone of the original beatniks, put together a folk music collection for theSmithsonian Institute, and was involved in the Theosophy and Dadaism ‘art’movements. New York Dolls member David Johansen, (known by the pseudonym ofBuster Poindexter as part of the house band on TV’s ‘Saturday Night Live,’) puttogether a band called David Johansen and the Harry Smiths in tribute.It was Harley’s aunt, Denise Mercedes, meanwhile, who recruited him to playdrums in her band, the Stimulators, when he was just 11 (!) When not doingmusic, Denise turns out to have been a lover to both Allen Ginsberg, andGinsberg’s homosexual partner Peter Orlovosky! Ginsberg had known Harley sincehe was one year old and they reportedly lived on a farm together. Ginsberg wenton to publish the poetry book ’Stories & Illustrations by Harley.’ Harleyappears on the cover, aged nine, dressed in a leather robe and sporting a hornedhelmet. Harley’s mother turns out to have been present at Ginsberg’s bedsidewhen he died in 1997. Harley became widely acknowledged as the first Americanskinhead when he imported the look from the UK, very much blending into the CroMags’ Krishnacore image.Just before we leave Ginsberg, another relationship outside of his long-term onewith Peter Orlovsky, was with visual artist and Andy Warhol associate BibbeHansen. She went on to become the mother of the musician known as Beck. All aresaid to be generational Scientologists.Nothing to see here. Please move along.STRAIGHT OUTTA DCTwo of the members of the Detroit 1960s proto-punk group MC5, (Motor City 5,)Wayne Kramer and Michael Davis, were inmates at The Federal Medicine Centre inLexington, Kentucky, known initially as the United States Narcotic Farm.Although it is described as “a federal prison for inmates requiring medical ormental health care,” it is also one of the key hospitals involved in the CIA’sMK-Ultra drug experimentation programme. William Burroughs attended the sameinstitution. MC5 were managed for a time by fellow poet and political activistJohn Sinclair, who served two years of a ten-year prison sentence for marijuanapossession. MC5 embraced Sinclair’s White Panther Party political leanings andwere considered a ‘Yippie’ band, with the word invented by counter-cultureactivists Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin, and defined as “a radicallyyouth-oriented and counter-cultural revolutionary offshoot of the free speechand anti-war movements of the 1960s.”[../images/00012.jpeg]Beat poet and cultural ‘hero’ Allen Ginsberg. He was also a member of NAMBLA, anorganisation that campaigns for men to be able to legally have sex with underageboys.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Allen_Ginsberg_1979_-_cropped.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Allen_Ginsberg_1979_-_cropped.jpg]Credit: Dijk, Hans van / Anefo - [1] Dutch National Archives, The Hague,Fotocollectie Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau (ANEFO), 1945-1989 bekijk toegang2.24.01.05 Bestanddeelnummer 930-5558Nino also reminds us that Washington DC has long been a hotbed of Punk music,with its own distinctive sound and style. It becomes an interesting location forsuch a scene given the many links back to the government and intelligenceworlds.Dave Grohl of Foo Fighters, by way of a great example, was earlier in a hardcorePunk band out of DC named Scream. His father, James Harper Grohl, worked inpolitics as an assistant to Robert A. Taft Jr. Robert’s father was WilliamHoward Taft, the 27th president of the United States, and his father wasAlphonso Taft, a founder of Skull & Bones. During John Kerry’s presidentialcampaign in 2004, Dave Grohl joined the trail and dedicated the album ‘In YourHonor’ to the former Skull & Bonesman. Yeah, rock ’n’ roll!For a time, Grohl dated Kathleen Hanna, now married to Adam Horovitz of TheBeastie Boys. Kathleen Hanna was in the bands Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, part ofthe underground feminist punk movement known as Riot Grrrl, and has stated thatshe was greatly influenced by the aforementioned Gloria Steinem. Nino reportsthat at many of the gigs played by feminist punk bands such as Hanna’s, theeugenics organisation Planned Parenthood, (of which Bill Gates’ dad was afounder,) are to be seen operating a promotional booth. But I’m sure it’s alljust a coincidence. Apparently they happen all the time.Grohl was back in the news in 2017, and reminding us of how well-connected heis, after he broke his leg falling off a stage in Switzerland, and “PaulMcCartney” (it says here) organised his resulting surgery. “He knows some goodfucking doctors,” Grohl remarked. Oh, I’ll bet he fucking does. Grohl sportsthree tattoos which he says were inspired by his musical heroes, theoccult-obsessed Led Zeppelin, and he has described the group’s John Bonham – whodied of apparent alcohol poisoning at the age of 32 – as “the greatest drummerof all time.”And, what do you know, we’re straight back round to Ginsberg again through astory told by James Harper Grohl, where he claims the Beat poet once tried toseduce him back in his more Bohemian, pre-politics days.Prior to Foo Fighters, Dave Grohl was the drummer for Seattle Grunge pioneersNirvana, whose singer Kurt Cobain became a member of the fabled 27 Club when hewas found shot dead in 1994. Many researchers doubt the official and convenientverdict of ‘suicide.’ Cobain’s wife, Courtney Love, has since been blamed asbeing complicit in his death by none other than her own father, Hank Harrison.He has also claimed that she was sexually abused from the age of three in herchildcare facility. In a dark twist of irony, Courtney’s mother is LindaCarroll, a therapist and counsellor for victims of abuse. She’s also rumoured tobe the illegitimate daughter of Marlon Brando.Harrison himself was an early road manager for the Warlocks, who morphed intoThe Grateful Dead. This group’s members have been shown to have been CIA agentsfrom Masonic families, with further links to Bohemian Grove and MK-Ultra. (Thereare those who additionally claim that Grohl’s success with Foo Fighters was insome way facilitated by Cobain’s untimely death, as some kind of ritualsacrifice.) The father of the Grateful Dead’s music publisher, Alan Trist, justhappens to have been Eric Trist, one of the founders of the Tavistock Instituteof Human Relations in London. But I’m sure it’s all just another coincidence.Would any reader by this point be surprised to learn that Courtney Love is alsoa distant cousin of Douglas Fairbanks Jr., the actor and decorated navalofficer? Also of interest is the fact that her manager for a brief time was SamLutfi, who readers might recall was a one-time manager (handler?) of BritneySpears, and became embroiled in a legal case with her family over her‘conservatorship.’ In his book ‘Drugs As Weapons Against Us,’ investigativejournalist John Potash writes of how Courtney Love brought large quantities ofheroin and other narcotics over to Ireland and England, distributing them amongvarious music scenes there in the 1990s with apparent impunity from any lawenforcement. I wonder if I or the average reader of this book did the same,whether we’d be free of any knocks on the door? She’s also rumoured to havegiven heroin to Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne’s daughter Kelly, getting her hooked,although Courtney in turn claims to have ‘saved Kelly’s life’ from heraddictions twice.STRANGE BEDFELLOWSThe links between Punk and the development of social movements go on, as Ninohighlights:“We have a ton of vanguards coming out of Punk Rock. So for (rock musician)Jobriath, he was basically the first openly gay rock star. Openly gay is thekey. So there were gay ones doing gay things, but he was open about it. Anotherdigression; we have the first openly gay guy on a reality TV show – or ontelevision – and that was Lance Loud from the punk band The Mumps. So the veryfirst reality TV show came from Punk Rock. It was called ‘An American Family,’done on PBS. All from Punk Rock. So this is a vanguard movement of socialjustice! This whole thing is unbelievable.”A link from the Punk scene back to its earlier counter-culture cousin comes viaDr. Timothy Leary, who interviewed British Punker and former Generation Xfrontman Billy Idol, (a member of the so-called ‘Bromley contingent,) for a 1993ABC show called ‘In Concert.’ In a conversation which laps at the fringes ofTranshumanism, the pair discuss Idol’s ‘Cyberpunk’ album. According to thepromotional blurb:“Billy Idol discusses a small amount of the technology behind the ‘Cyberpunk’album. He notes how it was completely produced on a computer. Timothy Leary seesBilly as ‘creating his own reality’.”An earlier Punk link with Leary had come in 1987, when Dead Kennedyssinger-turned spoken word artist and political activist, Jello Biafra, hadshared a bill with him reading poetry at the River City Reunion event in Kansas.William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, (who photographed him,) were also present.Nino finishes with a couple of intriguing links to the JFK assassination of1963. Yale attendee Jerry Haynes – once a Japanese language specialist in the USAir Force, and the father of Butthole Surfers (classy name) frontman GibbyHaynes – was better known as the children’s entertainer Mr. Peppermint. Hebecame one of the first on American TV to report the killing as he was in thevicinity of the TV station WFAA when the story broke. The father of Ian MacKaye,meanwhile, of the DC Punk bands Fugazi and Minor Threat, was in the press bus aspart of the JFK motorcade on the fateful day. Also present in Dallas – and inserendipitous attendance at the press conference where police displayed LeeHarvey Oswald – was future BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel, who at the time was workingas a radio DJ in Texas.And just before we leave Ian MacKaye, it’s worth noting that his grandmother,Dorothy, worked with eugenics kingpin and Planned Parenthood member Paul Popenoeon marriage advice columns, and fraternised with fellow eugenicists like AbbyRockefeller and Margaret Mead. His grandfather, meanwhile, worked for the UnitedStates Office of War Information. You couldn’t make it up and you don’t need to.Talking of which – a link between child-star actress Shirley Temple and Punkrock, anyone? The grown-up Temple married Charles Alden Black, who was anexecutive at the Stanford Research Institute, one of the principal socialengineering organisations in the US, from 1952 to 1957, as well as serving as anintelligence officer in the Korean War. The pair’s daughter, Laurie Black, wenton to join a North-Western Punk band called The Melvins. You know, like you do.And in a nugget uncovered by Masonic Youth linking a present-day rocker with aprominent politician, Pete Wentz of the group Fall Out Boy, turns out to have amaternal grandfather who served as the US ambassador to Sierra Leone, and wasalso a cousin of former US Secretary of State Colin Powell!Nino Teuoneaux and Masonic Youth’s blog site, documenting much of the above andmany other dubious links, can be found at: http://fourhorsesasses.blogspot.co.ukThe natural assumption when it comes to the Punk genre, would be that itscommunity of musicians was made up of disaffected kids – primarily ofworking-class backgrounds – playing grimy underground clubs, and channellingtheir angst and contempt for a system which had left them out to dry into theirangry, rebellious music. It might reasonably be assumed that the dads of suchmusicians – if they weren’t on the dole – would have occupied professions suchas miners, dockers, factory workers, lorry drivers or labourers. Very few ofthese are to be found.As Joe Atwill observed on one of his ‘Unspun’ podcasts on culture creation:“When you look at the backgrounds, and when you see things like Skull & Bonesand all these connections into the halls of power and wealth, then the idea thatthere would suddenly be a generation that would decide to produce Punk ... Imean, that’s just so non sequitur! This wouldn’t be what these people with theirbackgrounds would be doing, unless it was something that was organised.”And reflections on what the over-riding motive may have always been came fromJan Irvin on the same show. Drugs, homosexuality, Transgenderism, feminism,nihilism and discord between the generations and social classes, are all in thetoolkits of the social engineers:“The leader of these movements is the Lifetime Actor. It’s the Pied Piper,literally. They’re the generals, then they get all the plebs to put on theuniform and follow them along. And they destroy our children and our families inthe process because – clearly – they are afraid of any family challenging theirpower. So if they can destroy the family, the backbone of society, and if theycan institute this socialist, mom-on-welfare feminist society, then they havetotal control and they win (‘Brave New World’ author Aldous) Huxley’s finalrevolution.”TAKE THAT SITUATIONAnother link an observer wouldn’t necessarily expect to see, is the British Punkand New Wave scene’s connection to an intellectual socialist movement known asSituationist International – particularly through the managers of some of themost pivotal acts. SI is described as “an international organisation of socialrevolutionaries made up of avant-garde artists, intellectuals, and politicaltheorists ... The intellectual foundations ... were derived primarily fromanti-authoritarian Marxism and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20thcentury, particularly Dada and Surrealism.” It also has ties to The FrankfurtSchool.In an article on the ‘Louder Than War’ website, writer Amy Britton detailedspecific links to this movement from some of Punk’s key players:“The influence of Situationism on popular culture, particularly on the Punkmusic of the mid to late 1970s, is undeniable. Managers such as Bernie Rhodesand Malcolm McLaren were committed, consummate Situationists, (the latter’sbands, the Sex Pistols and Bow Wow Wow, were initially based around itsprinciples.)”And later ... “The scene that gathered around (Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood’s Chelseafashion shop) Sex, was somewhat self-lionizing anyway; with members of whatwould become known as the ‘Bromley Contingent’ gathering there. Bromley is avery-middle class, suburban area, but the group could be almost feral in theirbehaviour. (One particularly notable member, Siouxsie Sioux, put her friend on alead and would walk into pubs ordering a “bowl of water for her dog’.”)Siouxsie Sioux, real name Susan Ballion, posed for pictures in swastika-ladenNazi/ SS regalia from the Sex store. Other attention-grabbing promotional photoshave her sporting a large Star of David/ Seal of Solomon design on her T-shirt,and with one eye painted in the fashion of the Alex character from StanleyKubrick’s dystopian nightmare movie ‘A Clockwork Orange.’Back to Amy Britton’s article:“ ... As a believer and supporter of Situationism, McLaren would want to fightagainst what appalled (key Situationist figure) Guy Debord so much, not go alongwith it. So the ‘star’ he found could not possibly ‘embody banalism’ or a‘possible role.’ He had to be exciting, with a real role.“Once he had found him in the form of John Lydon, his concept becameunstoppable. Lydon was renamed Johnny Rotten ... His stage name carried with ita whole persona; the barriers of the real and perceived breakingdown ... Pseudonyms appeared everywhere on outlandish characters such asSiouxsie Sioux and the Damned’s Captain Sensible. But not everybody felt thatthis was necessary ... and with McLaren not the only Situationist manager on thescene, ideas about what reflected the construction of a situation varied fromperson to person.”McLaren had formed the King Mob with fellow art student Jamie Reid as anexpression of Situationism. He had set up solidarity demonstrations in London atthe time of the infamous May 1968 student riots in Paris, then spent time in NewYork briefly managing the New York Dolls, before returning to London with theintention of bringing the Punk aesthetic of nihilism back to Britain. The SexPistols morphed from a pub-rock band to the ambassadors of the Punk sceneshortly after. Perhaps his vision for the band all along was encapsulated in the‘cash for chaos’ statement he makes as ‘The Embezzler’ in the movie ‘The GreatRock N Roll Swindle,’ (another clue in the title?)which parodied the Sex Pistolsstory.[../images/00013.jpeg]Stewart Copeland, one of CIA overlord Miles Copeland’s three sons who went towork in the music business. The Police ... gettit?https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Stewart_Copeland_Marseille_2008.png[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Stewart_Copeland_Marseille_2008.png]Credit: JosuéJacobIt was Bernard Rhodes who introduced John Lydon to the Pistols, beforeintroducing Mick Jones and Paul Simonon to Joe Strummer to form the nucleus ofThe Clash. Rhodes, like McLaren, has said he was vastly influenced bySituationism, and he was a designer of T-shirts for Sex. Other Situationists inthe music game have included the former TV journalist Tony Wilson, who went onto spearhead Factory Records/ Joy Division/ New Order and Manchester’sinfluential Hacienda club, and the group KLF, led by the deeply eccentric BillDrummond. The latter’s anarchic Situationist ‘art statements’ have includedsetting fire to a million pounds in cash, and dumping a dead sheep on stage at aBRIT Awards ceremony.It’s difficult to establish exactly what Situationism was trying to espouse, asall its writings are cloaked in pretentious intellectual jargon. What is clearis that it concerned itself with changing human society, and it’s not the firsttime we’ve encountered this dynamic at play in the music industry.Ever feel you’ve been misled?RUNNING IN THE FAMILYOne family in particular yielded such influence over the development of the NewWave scene on both sides of the Atlantic, that virtually all of the acts thatshaped that scene had some kind of working connection back to them. In manyways, that entire musical community was the fiefdom of the Copeland family. Andits patriarch, Miles Axe Copeland Jr., was a career CIA man and something of alegend within intelligence circles. I don’t know if readers have noticed, butit’s never too long before those nice folk at Langley pop back up in thesestories. Why should this be if this is an honourable agency concerned only withkeeping Americans safe and secure? According to former CIA asset John R.Stockwell, who has admitted to personally flying heroin out of Vietnam into theUS on behalf of the agency, it’s anything but. In his book ‘The PraetorianGuard’ he states:“Now, more clearly than ever, the CIA, with its related institutions, is exposedas an agency of destabilisation and repression.”And also ... “The CIA and the big corporations were, in my experience, in step with eachother. Later, I realised that they may argue about details of strategy – a smallwar here or there. However, both are vigorously committed to supporting thesystem.”And Stockwell is one of only a multitude of whistle-blowers who have lifted thelid on the real role of the CIA, which – in classic satanic-inversion fashion-is the very opposite of what it’s publicly proclaimed to be. Jan Irvin has wrylyremarked that it should be renamed the Central Entertainment Agency, since moreof its resources seem to have been deployed in weaponising popular culture, thanin the spying, surveillance and counter-intelligence work it’s supposed to beengaged in. The Copeland family story certainly bears this viewpoint out.Born in Alabama in 1916 as the son of a doctor, Copeland joined the NationalGuard as a young man, and became one of the founder members of the Office ofStrategic Service in the 1940s, which morphed into the Central IntelligenceAgency after World War 2. His CIA career involved overseas postings, and he wason the scene at many political coups and regime changes. These included a rolein the 1949 Syrian coup d’etat, and the 1953 overthrow of the Prime Minister ofIran. From 1957 to ’68, Copeland was based in Beirut, during which time heworked closely with the Dulles brothers of CIA repute.Outside of his CIA activities, he also became a consultant to General AbdelNasser of Egypt, who had overthrown that country’s king. Copeland was involvedin the setting-up of the Mukhabarat, that country’s version of the CIA. In hisbook ‘The Game Player,’ Copeland admitted that he had been sent to Egypt toassess the feasibility of assassinating Nasser. Copeland reportedly retired fromthe CIA in 1957, but continued to carry out missions for the agency uponrequest. He relocated to London in 1970, where he became a frequent televisionguest defending the virtues of the intelligence community. He also helped devisea board game for the manufacturer Waddingtons entitled ‘The Game Of Nations,’and wrote an article titled ‘Spooks For Bush.’ He had earlier named George HWBush, (who trauma-based mind-control survivor Cathy O’Brien has named as arapist, paedophile and satanist,) as his favourite of all CIA directors.Biographies of Copeland often list him as an accomplished musician outside ofhis spying activities. Although this aspect may explain why his sons wereencouraged to go to work within the music field, there seems to be some doubt asto whether this was actually the case, or whether this was embellishment addedto Copeland’s CV at a later stage. According to Wikipedia: “There is nothing inCopeland’s CIA files to suggest he was ever a “professional musician,” but“several relatives and friends have testified to his musical ability.”Copeland’s books contain “several impressive statements about his days as a jazzmusician,” including that “he spent a week playing fourth trumpet in the GlennMiller orchestra,” although this claim has been discredited.Miles went on to marry Elizabeth Lorraine Adie, the Scottish daughter of aprominent neurosurgeon, and herself an asset of British Intelligence. Themarriage spawned three sons, who would each become prominent figures within the1970s New Wave scene.Displaying an apparent lack of imagination, Copeland’s firstborn was named MilesCopeland III, birthed in London in 1944. From 1966, he studied at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut, an institution which not only groomed many future worldleaders, but also 19 of the delegates who signed the United Nations charter in1945, and future Apple founder Steve Jobs. Prior to this, Miles III and brotherStewart had attended Beirut’s American Community School, a location which laterturned out actors Keanu Reeves and Greg Kinnear, as well as Bran Ferren, whodeveloped the patents for Apple’s pinch-to-zoom technology, and who latercollaborated with Miles III on visual effects for many of his acts’ concerts.Miles III’s first accomplishment in music is said to have been his formation ofthe group Wishbone Ash. He went on to found the agency and record label BritishTalent Management, focusing on Prog Rock bands.By 1977, he was poised to fully exploit (or direct?) the emerging Punk and NewWave scene through his new Illegal Records operation. Later, he establishedInternational Records Syndicate, (IRS for short,) which put out releases by manyof the key names in the New Wave market. Part of Miles III’s extremely efficientbusiness model saw him scoring a music video show with the then fledgling MTV,on which he only promoted his own artists. He now owns and operates CopelandInternational Artists (CIA – gettit?!) In interviews, Miles III stated that hecame to a point where he had to decide whether his career was going to bespycraft or the music industry. Maybe he chose both?The second Copeland son, Ian, was born in 1949. After military service – whichincluded a tour of duty in Vietnam – he first joined his brother Miles in hismusic industry activities. By 1979, Ian had founded his own operation, FrontierBooking International, (FBI!), a talent agency to represent emerging acts,ranging from The B52s to The Cure. For a while, Ian was romantically linked toRolling Stones associate, (and daughter of a British army officer!) MarianneFaithfull, and to Courtney Cox, (who also happened to be his step-sister.) Hepenned his memoirs in a book, ‘Wild Thing,’ published in 1995.The youngest Copeland brother was Stewart, born in 1952, and best known as thedrummer for the most prolific of all the New Wave bands, The Police. That’s ThePolice. With lead singer Sting, as in ‘sting operation’. Ever feel like you’rebeing given a clue?! (Though rock lore has it that he got his name because heoften wore a yellow and black striped jersey making him look like a bee!)As Dave McGowan recounts at the end of his book ‘Weird Scenes Inside TheCanyon:’“Before actually recruiting any musicians, (Stewart) quickly came up with a bandname, and designed the band’s logo and album cover. The band that he would thenassemble ... would soon become arguably the most critically-acclaimed andcommercially successful of the new bands. The initial success of The Police inthe US is what largely opened the floodgates for a new British invasion of Punkand New Wave bands. And that was in spite of the fact that the band was in noway a Punk band, and didn’t really even qualify as a New Wave band. As theBritish press pointed out, band members were much too professional, and a bittoo old, to really fit into the new scene.”The Copelands had connections in Beirut to the British spy Kim Philby, one ofthe so-called ‘Cambridge five.’ In a 2013 interview with the UK’s ‘Telegraph,’Stewart stated:“As it happened, we were friendly out there with Kim Philby and his family. Infact, my dad was just about to expose him when his own cover got busted. I knewKim’s son Harry, and they kind of moved in with us when their dad disappeared.”Sting picked up a CBE. In a link back to Copeland’s espionage world, he is saidto have written ‘Every Breath You Take,’ The Police’s biggest hit, at the deskof James Bond author Ian Fleming. The meaning of ’Every Breath You Take’ isoften misconstrued. Far from a love song, it is the dark taunting of a stalkertowards his prey ... or could equally be applied to a mind-control handleraddressing his subject. The single’s B-side is just as much an eyebrow-raiser.‘Murder By Numbers’ is an ode to killing covertly and getting away withit – security services-style – with lyrics such as:“Now you can join the ranks of the illustrious, in history’s great dark hall offame,All our greatest killers were industrious. At least the ones that we all know byname.But you can reach the top of your profession, if you become the leader of theland.For murder is the sport of the elected, and you don’t need to lift a finger ofyour hand.”Sorry, did I mention that a hugely unlikely number of musicians have expressedfascination with the teachings of Aleister Crowley? Well, Sting is among them.At the end of the Police song ‘Synchronicity II,’ he sings: “Many miles awaythere’s a shadow on the door, of a cottage on the shore, of a dark Scottishlake.” This is a direct reference to Crowley’s infamous Boleskine House on theshores of Loch Ness, (owned by Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page from 1971 to ’91,)where Crowley is said to have performed many dark rituals and seances and tohave summoned up entities. Boleskine House burned to the ground in suspiciouscircumstances just prior to Christmas 2015.The third Police member was British-born Andy Summers, who was brought in toreplace original guitarist Henri Padovani. Summers had been present on theLaurel Canyon scene in LA during its counter-culture heyday, was one of theregulars at the Log Cabin, the one-time home of Frank Zappa, and was a regularattendee of gigs on the Sunset Strip.Back at the CIA, Miles Copeland Senior had worked with Sumner Redstone, who wenton to become a media baron, controlling many of the largest mainstream outletsincluding CBS Corporation, Viacom, Paramount Pictures and BET Networks. SumnerRedstone’s original name was Murray Sumner Rothstein, before he anglicised it to‘Redstone’ to sound less German-Jewish and more American. In a neat turn ofsynchronicity, Sting’s real name is Gordon Sumner.The Copeland brothers split their time between living in the US and the UK, andare said to have become fluent in Arabic through their time in Lebanon. In 1985,they were issued with a ‘Humanitarian Award’ by the Cancer industry. (Perhapsrather ironically, Ian died in 2006 aged 57 of melanoma.) The wording of theirbiography in the accompanying programme, may reveal more as to what their realwork had been throughout their music industry years:“Early in each of their individual careers, the Copeland brothers wereconsidered mavericks – the new frontiersmen ... While they were bucking theestablished institution, practices and attitudes of the music industry, theywere on the cutting-edge of pioneering ‘new music’ into the United States. Theirmethods, once scorned, are now imitated.”Miles Copeland Senior died in 1991. In 2017, Stewart Copeland announced theformation of a new ‘supergroup,’ Gizmodrome, consisting of himself, former Zappaand Bowie collaborator Adrian Belew, and former Level 42 frontman Mark King.MORE ON MCLARENMalcolm McLaren was raised in North London by his maternal grandmother, RoseCorre Isaacs, the formerly wealthy daughter of Portuguese Sephardic Jewishdiamond dealers. Ian MacLeay’s book ‘Malcolm McLaren – The Biography: The SexPistols, the Anarchy, the Art ... ’ notes that Rose frequently filled the housewith “luvvies, Bohemians and homosexuals,” that she shared her bed with theteenage Malcolm, and that among the various values she instilled in him was that“to be bad is good, to be good is simply boring.” As Nino Teuoneaux observed: “Ireally don’t know what that kind of upbringing would do to a child.”McLaren’s experimental forays into other genres included his 1983 album ‘DuckRock,’ which fused world music from Africa, South America and the Caribbean,with the electro hip-hop sound coming out of New York. During this time, hestruck up a friendship with Hip-Hop culture icon and Universal Zulu Nationfounder Afrika Bambaataa, (later accused of being a predatory rapist, and ofwhom, much more in a later chapter.) McLaren also took Opera into the pop chartswith his 1984 interpretation of Puccini’s ’Madam Butterfly,’ and sought topopularise the art of ‘vogueing’ prior to Madonna.Besides the calculated controversy he stirred up through the Sex Pistols,McLaren courted further attention with one of his post-Pistols acts, Bow WowWow, when he had the singer Annabella Lwin pose nude for an album cover when shewas just 14 years old. A photographer has also spoken of a separate occasionwhere Malcolm coerced a 12-year-old girl intro stripping naked for a photoshoot.McLaren, drawing on his Situationist ideals, appears to have revelled inmanipulating others’ paedophilic tendencies for the sake of controversy, or tomake some kind of artistic statement that made sense to very few other thanhimself. As detailed in this extract from the book ‘The Sex Pistols: InsideStory’ by Fred Vermorel:“He would illustrate his point with a lurid anecdote of how, one evening, he anda companion visited the legendary CBS executive Maurice Oberstein at home. Here,they found a young boy naked under a blanket on the sofa. Oberstein boasted hehad picked the boy up at a railway station. For Malcolm, that symbolised thecorruption and hypocrisy that underlay ‘Top Of The Pops’ and all the other musicbiz rigmarole.“But rather than denounce Oberstein, he sought to expose his latent industrypaedophilia by exacerbating it – a Situationist tactic that could also have beentaken from the French philosopher who commented, ‘the ecstasy of making thingsworse.’ Malcolm just loved making things worse at the expense of anyone who gotin the way ... ”In an article for the ‘Cageside Seats’ website, writer David Bixenspan, adds:“It was clear to Fred Vermorel that the situation was massively screwed up. Histheory – seemingly proven true to him in a conversation with McLaren, (where thelatter expressed his intentions to flee to South America before ‘the shit hitsthe fan’) – was that his old friend wanted to engineer a wide-ranging childpornography scandal that would take down EMI, the BBC, and everyone elseinvolved, including Vermorel. McLaren wanted to prove that pop music waspornography for, and using children, and this was his opportunity.”By this time, McLaren had launched a pop/ fashion magazine with EMI’s backing,initially entitled ‘Playkids,’ but changed soon afterwards to ‘Chicken.’ Heclaimed that the new periodical would be about “pleasure technology for theprimitive boy and girl.” This chapter in McLaren’s history becomes concerning inlight of the ‘Pizzagate’ pedophile scandal referenced earlier. Those involvedwere said to have used food-related codewords in their correspondence, with‘chicken’ referring to underage boys.One of the popular T-shirt designs to have come out of McLaren and VivienneWestwood’s Sex store, (Westwood has since been knighted as a ‘Dame,’) shows anunderage naked boy holding a cigarette. McLaren himself has been picturedproudly sporting one with the words ‘Cambridge rapist’ across it.As Nino Teuoneaux observes:“The Sex Pistols were a manufactured Situationist outcry against modern,manufactured music. One of the over-arching principles of SituationistInternational is the destruction of art, of music. Abstract art is good, andrealism and the classics are bad. These are for the elites. Situationists areexacerbating the divisions in art. So Malcolm is using his knowledge of thatphilosophy to create a band that fits a desire.So it seems like both his bands were manufactured vanguards of anti-music forthe Situationist philosophy.”It’s worth remembering that Johnny Rotten ended the Sex Pistols’ final concertin San Francisco in 1978 with the phrase: “ever get the feeling you’ve beencheated? Goodnight.” Had Rotten just figured out the true nature of McLaren’sexploitation? Or had he been a knowing participant in the process all along?Malcolm died in April 2010 aged 64, very quickly after contracting the diseaseperitoneal mesothelioma. His last words were reportedly “free Leonard Peltier”in reference to the jailed Native American political activist.THE ‘J’ WORDSomething which I personally find to be of great interest, is the massive numberof Jewish family links to Punk and New Wave, and I feel the question as to whythis should be is one worth asking. Inevitably, a small minority will instantly,by default, be triggered to brand me ‘anti-Semitic’ for even raising the issue.Society has been so systematically programmed by the likes of theRothschild-controlled Anti Defamation League, that ‘the J-word’ always has thateffect among a few. If these music scenes were as widely populated by, let’ssay, Swedish, Korean or Brazilian people, as they are by people of Jewishorigin, I would be asking exactly the same question. Would I then be demonisedas an ‘Anti-Swede!,’ an ‘Anti-Korean!’ or an ‘Anti-Brazilian!’ and shunned byall of polite society as a result?No. Because Jews, (or at least those that describe themselves as ‘Jewish,’ sincethe majority of such people in the world today are actually descended from theAshkenazi Khazars of the Caucasus mountain region, and have no genetic links tothe Middle East at all,) are the only group about whom such politically-correctparanoia exists. The phrase ‘Anti-Semite!’ is levelled before what is even beingsaid is examined to see whether it might, in fact, have validity, and thediscussion is shut down there and then. In reference to this instant response,former Israeli minister Shulamit Aloni admitted in a 2002 interview: “It’s atrick. We always use it.”This, then, becomes a question in itself. Why are these measures in place forthis one group above all others?The other big question is: What is it about the music and entertainmentindustries that attracts such a large number of individuals of Jewish descent,way out of all proportion to their numbers in society generally? I don’t claimto have the answer. I just think the question is worth being considered.As Nino Teuoneaux states:“The whole scene is overwhelmingly weighted towards Jewish influence on everysingle level. In the original bands coming out of New York in the 70s, there wasan inside joke that CBGBs was called ‘The Synagogue.’ Every band that came outof there had a more than 50 per cent Jewish contingent during that time.“So we’re talking Ramones, Blondie, New York Dolls, all the connections goingback to Ginsberg. And every single Situationist source I have is Jewish-linked.Every single one. Almost every music producer was of Jewish race or religion, orit went through a Jewish distributor. Nine out of ten club owners in New York,LA, were Jewish. Everything top to bottom.“The thing is, I’m not looking for that. I’m not trying to figure out who’sJewish and who’s not. It’s just part of the data that’s available on-line.”A handful of the key players on the British scene have Jewish family links, too,(and the information is offered without insinuation, purely for the reader’sinterest.) Clash manager Bernard Rhodes’ mother was a Russian-Jewish evacuee. Heclaims to have never known his father. Bob Geldof, frontman of Irish New-WaversThe Boomtown Rats, had a Jewish paternal grandmother. Mick Jones of The Clashwas born in London, to a Welsh father, Tommy Jones, and a Russian-Jewish mother,Renee Zegansky. (His cousin is Grant Shapps, the Tory MP for Welwyn Hatfield.)Jones’ Clash bandmate Joe Strummer, born John Graham Mellor, was the son of aBritish foreign service diplomat, who had a German-Jewish paternal grandmother.Strummer died suddenly of a reported congenital heart defect on 22nd December2002, aged 50.I DON’T WANT TO GO TO CHELSEAJust as with the previously-documented Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LosAngeles, the Punk scene has its own sinister location littered with tales thatmakes it the last place I’d ever choose to spend a night. This is the HotelChelsea in midtown Manhattan.Originally a residential apartment block built in the 1880s, (at the same timeas the Dakota Building outside which John Lennon was murdered, and in which themovie ‘Rosemary’s Baby’ was set,) this establishment has held a magneticattraction for writers, poets, musicians, actors and counter-culture iconsthrough the decades, many of whom used it as their home for long periods. ArthurC. Clarke wrote ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’ there, Beat poets Allen Ginsberg andGregory Corso were residents, Jack Kerouac wrote his novel ‘On The Road’ in itsrooms, and playwright Arthur Miller wrote ‘The Chelsea Effect’ to document histime there in the early 1960s. The writer Dylan Thomas was staying there when heis said to have died of pneumonia on 9th November (9/11) 1953. Charles R.Jackson, author of ‘The Lost Weekend,’ committed suicide in his room on 21stSeptember, (the Autumn Equinox,) 1968.Others to have called the Chelsea home at some point or other, include theaforementioned occultist Harry Everett Smith, (who died in its room 328 in1991,) Stanley Kubrick, Ethan Hawke, Dennis Hopper, Eddie Izzard, Uma Thurman,Elliott Gould, Jane Fonda and Russell Brand, among many others. Punk’s Dee DeeRamone wrote a book, apparently “fictionalised,” where he talks of groups inrobes holding occult rituals in the hotel’s basement.The Chelsea entered into music lore long ago by way of other disturbing stories.Dave McGowan documented one of these in his ‘Weird Scenes’ book concerning theonce-socially-conscious folk-singer Phil Ochs:“In the Summer of 1975, Phil Ochs’ public persona abruptly changed. Adopting thename John Butler Train, Ochs proclaimed himself a CIA operative and presentedhimself as a belligerent, right-wing thug. He told an interviewer that ‘on thefirst day of Summer 1975, Phil Ochs was murdered in the Chelsea Hotel by JohnTrain ... For the good of society, public and secret, he needed to be gotten ridof.’ That symbolic assassination, on the Summer solstice, took place at the samehotel that Devon Wilson had flown out of a few years earlier. One of Ochs’biographers would later write that Phil/ John ‘actually believed he was a memberof the CIA’.”Could the Chelsea have housed some kind of covert mind-control facilityconnected to the military, and in turn, the entertainment sectors? Could thisexplain its strange draw and dubious history? In his 1978 song ‘(I Don’t Want ToGo To) Chelsea,’ British-Irish New Waver Elvis Costello sang: “Men comescreaming, dressed in white coats, shake you very gently by the throat.” Couldhe have been displaying knowledge of what goes on at the infamous New Yorkhotel, rather than protesting against visiting the part of South West Londonwhich, synchronistically (?) spawned the UK’s own Punk movement?McGowan also reports that, in 1971, a prostitute-turned rock groupie named DevonWilson – who had reportedly been with Jimi Hendrix the day before his death, andhad been romantically linked to Arthur Lee of the Laurel Canyon bandLove – plunged to her death from an eighth-floor window of the Chelsea.[../images/00014.jpeg]New York’s Chelsea Hotel. I’ll take the Travelodge down the road, thankshttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NY_chelsea_hotel.jpg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NY_chelsea_hotel.jpg]Credit: VelvetAn ode to the hotel, meanwhile, was composed by singer/ songwriter ChristaPaffgen, known by the artist name Nico, on her 1967 debut album ‘Chelsea Girl.’This followed her role in the similarly-titled Andy Warhol avant-garde/experimental film ‘Chelsea Girls’ the year before. The movie was shot, in part,at the hotel, and profiled the lifestyles of many of the young women who wereknown as ‘Warhol’s Superstars’ at the time. Nico had been a vocalist with VelvetUnderground before collaborating with Jackson Browne. She died of a reportedcerebral haemorrhage in Ibiza aged 49.Other musical links include Madonna’s residency at the Chelsea in the early1980s, and her return in 1992 to shoot photographs for her book ‘Sex’ in Room822. The same room attracted Taylor Momsen’s band The Pretty Reckless for a morerecent photoshoot. British dance artist La Roux shot one of their music videosat the hotel, as did Depeche Mode’s Dave Gahan for his song ‘Saw Something.’ TheGrateful Dead, Tom Waits, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Jeff Beck, Dee Dee Ramone, PhilLynott, Cher, Joni Mitchell, Bob Dylan, Alice Cooper, Janis Joplin, BetteMidler, Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Canned Heat and Leonard Cohen all spent timethere. Why?The Chelsea itself has been the subject of many movies, including the sexthriller ‘9½ Weeks,’ the Japanese horror ‘Hotel Chelsea,’ 2001’s ‘ChelseaWalls,’ and the 2008 documentary ‘Chelsea On The Rocks.’In an even more intriguing link, meanwhile, several survivors of the Titanic aresaid to have stayed for some time after the 1912 disaster, as the hotel is closeto the Pier 54 dock where the liner was supposed to have arrived.Perhaps the very darkest blot on the Chelsea’s history connects right back intothe Punk scene, however.SID & NANCYSid Vicious achieved iconic ‘live fast die young’ status in a remarkably shortspace of time, and at a very young age. At the time of his death he’d been inthe public eye for no more than two years, and was still only 21. His famousmoniker is said to have been inspired by a pet hamster of Johnny Rotten’s, namedSid. When it once bit him, he remarked, “Sid’s really vicious” and the namestuck. Vicious’ real name was John Simon Ritchie, known later as John Beverleywhen his mother re-married. For a period, he shared a squat with three other‘faces’ on the London punk scene, and the group became known as ‘the fourJohns.’ One was John Lydon, who became Johnny Rotten, one was John Wardle,better known by the stage name Jah Wobble, the other was John Grey.Vicious’ parents are said to have met in the Royal Air Force in yet anothermilitary link. His absent father worked as a guardsman at Buckingham Palace, andwas a semi-professional trombone player on the London Jazz scene. Anne marriedSid’s step-father, Christopher Beverley, in 1965. Sid, who had been a regularface at the Sex boutique in Chelsea, was recruited to join the Sex Pistols uponthe departure of original bassist Glen Matlock in early 1977. Vicious quicklygarnered attention as a nihilistically flamboyant icon of the Punk scene, goingon to provide vocals for three cover tracks on the soundtrack of the Pistolsmovie ‘The Great Rock N Roll Swindle.’By late 1978, with the Sex Pistols over, Sid was living in New York with hisgirlfriend, a Jewish rock groupie/ prostitute/ heroin addict/ dealer named NancySpungen. Both had been on a path to self-destruction through all of their younglives, and were hopelessly addicted to heroin and other drugs as they holedthemselves up in Room 100 of the Chelsea. On 12th October, Nancy’s lifeless bodywas discovered in the bathroom of their apartment, aged only 20. She had beenstabbed in the abdomen. The official story that quickly emerged, (andimmortalised in Alex Cox’s 1986 movie ‘Sid & Nancy, which contained Courtneylove in an early bit-part, incidentally,) was that a deranged Sid, in adrug-induced haze, had stabbed her, and she had stumbled off to the bathroom tobleed to death. Sid was charged with her murder but was out on bail soonafterwards, the money, according to later comments by Johnny Rotten, having beenput up by a benevolent Mick Jagger. Within weeks, however, he had been chargedwith assault after an altercation in a club with the brother of singer PattiSmith, and was forcibly placed on a harsh detox programme at Riker’s Islandprison.Sid’s own life came to an end on 2nd February 1979, from a heroin overdose at aparty held at a friend’s Manhattan apartment to celebrate him having made bailagain the day before. The official explanation is that he voluntarily ODed,apparently keeping up his end of a suicide pact that he and Nancy had made.Vicious had already attempted suicide on a couple of occasions since beingreleased. Some tellings of the story have it that Sid’s unconventional motherAnne – who had been already been feeding his heroin habit formonths – administered the fatal dose, either with or without Sid’s consent,depending on who’s telling the story. Sid’s voluntary suicide conflicts with thetestimony of friends, however, who stated that he had become optimistic aboutthe future with plans for a career resurgence.It’s here that – as in all such cases – the waters get muddied as to what reallyhappened to Nancy. As many close to the Pistols have opined over the decades,the lazy and disinterested police found it convenient to wrap up the case withthe notion that an out-of-his mind Sid had simply stabbed her, and later OD’dhimself. Two more pointless junkies off the street. A neat result, and fareasier than doing any real police work.Anomalies emerge from differing accounts of the knife said to have been used inthe killing, however, as evidenced in the 2010 documentary ‘Who Killed Nancy’ byjournalist Alan G. Parker, a link to which is at the end.According to the official story, a 007 flip-knife was given to the Dead Boysbassist Stiv Bators by Dee Dee Ramone, and Vicious, impressed by it, went outand bought an identical one. But other accounts claim the knife used was acompletely different model. The police report stated that, when the murderweapon was found, it had been wiped clean. Witnesses who saw the drug-inducedstupor that Vicious was under all night, insist he wouldn’t have had theforesight to have done this.In an interview with the ‘Daily Record,’ John Lydon appeared to be of the viewthat Nancy had stabbed herself, stating:“Nancy Spungen was a hideous, awful person who killed herself because of thelifestyle, and led to the destruction and subsequent death of Sid and the wholefiasco.”Lydon elaborated in his book ‘Anger Is an Energy: My Life Uncensored,’ releasedin 2015, suggesting Nancy was a handler for drug gangs, and her death was theresult of debts owed.“Nancy was killed, and that poor foolish boy was left holding the knife ... Tome, there’s no mystery in it at all. You owe money, that’s what you’re gonnaget.”British writer and researcher Neil Sanders got into this when he guested onepisode 92 of my ‘Good Vibrations’:“I don’t think Sid did it. I think basically he was asleep. The rumour that’sput about – and I asked Glen Matlock about this when I met him the otherweek – he was told by someone that knew, that it was from the bass player fromthe Dead Boys, (Stiv Bators,) who had been around at the time, bought a load ofsmack off this guy, and bought a load of hunting knives as well because theyliked that sort of stuff. This guy went away, Sid got completely comatose, hecame back and said, ‘Nancy, I want some of my drugs back.’ She said no, they gotinto an argument, he stabbed her. Sid was just basically none the wiser.“The same way the claim is made that Courtney Love brought all the heroin in tothe Grunge scene, which destroyed it, ultimately, Nancy – along with JohnnyThunders of the Heartbreakers – certainly brought in heroin. She was the onethat got Sid on it. No-one was doing heroin until Nancy and Johnny Thunders camein.”The ‘Who Killed Nancy’ documentary, meanwhile, suggests that Sid – who wascarrying large amounts of cash – may have been the target of a robbery at theChelsea, and that Nancy had been stabbed trying to stop it. Interviewees in thefilm make repeated references to a character known only as ‘Michael’ who livedon the sixth floor of the hotel at the time. Some think this could have been areference to Michael Morra, better known by the name Rockets Redglare, underwhich he performed as a comedian. Morra was himself a drug dealer and addict whowas known to have been around the Chelsea on the night in question.Sid’s mother, herself an addict, was discovered dead of a suspected heroinoverdose in September 1996. She had apparently been left dejected at the lack ofsuccess of the Sex Pistols’ ‘Filthy Lucre’ reunion tour, which she called “sadand pathetic.”The Chelsea has reportedly been closed to guests and undergoing renovation since2011."},{"pageContent":"Resources:’65 to ’69: The Soundtrack to a Masterclass in Culture-Creation’:On the basis that music speaks louder than words, a while ago I put together thefollowing story of five era-defining years as told by the music, with a fewaudio snippets from some key events along the way.

And why should there be any connection between these elements and themusic scene in the first place?!?“I’ve never met anyone who has been like, man, I love that they’re playing EddieMoney’s ‘Two Tickets To Paradise’ on the radio again! Nobody says that!”Chris Drapeau on ‘Good Vibrations’ podcast, 2017“It’s showmanship. Same as Cannibal Corpse singing gore lyrics. People wouldn’tbuy it if they sang about puppies and rainbows and put My Little Pony on theiralbum covers.”’Dogsmilk’, commenter on 2012 David Icke on-line forum thread on Heavy Metal“I don’t know if I’m a medium for some outside source. Whatever it is, frankly,I hope it’s not what I think it is ... ”Ozzy OsbourneMention ‘satanism’ in music to the average member of the public, and their mindwill probably go to the genres of Heavy Rock and Heavy Metal, such have beenthese scenes’ mythical connections to the world of the dark occult. Many willdoubtless recall images of rockers flashing the ‘devil horns.’ Antics such asOzzy Osbourne biting off the heads of a bat and two white doves may spring tomind, (he’d been well-groomed for bloodshed having spent time working in anabattoir,) as will none-too-subtle group names like Black Sabbath, Judas Priestand the ‘Big Four’ stadium Metal bands – Slayer, Megadeth, Anthrax andMetallica.These associations were exacerbated among the American public by the so-called‘satanic panic’ of the 1980s, the largely Christian-driven moral revolt againstthe music, and were fuelled by bands’ blatant wallowing in evil themes as a wayof shifting records. Metal’s reputation was strengthened further by claims thatthe music of Metallica was used for sleep deprivation and the psychologicaltorture of Iraqi prisoners of war at the hands of the US military, and thatcontinued exposure to Hard Rock – particularly the Van Halen song ‘Panama’ – ledto the eventual surrender of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega to US troops in1990.But, such obvious examples aside, is this association wholly fair? Are thesegenres more ‘satanic’ than any other, given that artists ranging from CliffRichard to Justin Bieber have been pictured putting up the ‘666’ sign, andsubliminal images of demonic entities have been hidden in Robin Thicke andBeyonce videos? Has Metal’s reputation for profanity been carefully cultivatedby the leading names of the scene to generate profitable shock and controversy?Or have its pioneers been genuine practitioners of occult rituals, and is theresomething about the vibratory signatures of these sounds, that allows for a veryreal connection to dark and disturbing energy realms? Could many musicians begenuinely possessed by entities that are conjured during performances?THE SATANIC SCAPEGOAT?Heavy Metal musician-turned independent researcher Chris Drapeau, who has playedwith groups including Metallica, Megadeth and Devildriver, guested on ‘GoodVibrations’ in 2017 to give his perspectives on these matters. As he reflected:“My biggest underlying question here is: has Heavy Metal always been the‘satanic scapegoat,’ so to speak? Was that stigma created to take the focus offof the real harmful aspects of real satanism displayed in popular music and popculture? As if to say, ‘Heavy Metal is the devil’s music, but please, by allmeans listen to this song by Rihanna. It’s completely clear of any satanism andis totally acceptable for your child to listen to!”Given the overblown aggression of Metal and its associated genres, he adds –loud volume, confrontational themes and garish images – it becomes the perfectvehicle for having accusations of dark occult aspects levelled at it.“I feel like Metal has become the satanic scapegoat, where it does divert a lotof the focus away from the real, true satanism that we’re seeing in pop culture,and a lot of the satanism that a lot of people are unknowingly living!”Some agreement came from musician Jeff Young, who was the guitarist for Megadethon their first album. Jeff now hosts his ‘Music Without Boundaries’ showon-line, showcasing inspiring sounds that never ordinarily get radio play, andalso guested on ‘Good Vibrations’ in 2017:“In my research, I discovered that Metal’s got nothing on Country music, becausefrom hee-haw and back-in-the-day, all the way up to our modern-day artists –Keith Urban, Blake Sheldon – you can’t make it in Country music if you’re not aFreemason! I’ve done a whole lot on this on my show, and there’s a whole photoalbum on my ‘Music Without Boundaries’ Facebook. I got sick of posting albumcovers and stage sets and programmes, and Dolly Parton and Garth Brooks and allthese people Freemason hand-signing, and standing in a pyramid form and all thisstuff. And then you look at a Ke$ha video, with the pentagrams and some of thisstuff, and it’s darker than Slayer and any of the Metal stuff that we did!”Dutch musician Quinz Oldenhof, who played bass in the thrash metal bandChainsaw, and has written extensively for the Metal music press, concurs:“Someone should actually start a research/ investigation in the US, asking allthe murderers, serial killers and rapists who are locked up what kind of musicthey listen to. I would really like to see the end results. Maybe it’ll turn outto be Rihanna who has the worst influence on people!”ALL A BIG JOKE?Lifelong adherents to Metal and its many spin-offs – including Extreme, Speed,Power, Metalcore, Grindcore, Gore, Slam, Doom, Death and Black Metal – insistthat the bands’ apparent obsession with death, torture, rape, mutilation andwitchcraft is entirely tongue-in-cheek; simply gallows-humour delivered with anod and a wink to those who can spot the joke. These enthusiasts zealouslyevangelise for their chosen forms of music, and many consider their associationwith it to define their entire identities, going so far as to have tattoos,piercings and body imprints deifying their Metal heroes. They point to theoverblown satanic pomp of groups such as AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Anthrax andMegadeth as obvious examples of Metal’s extreme-seeming, but ultimately harmlessnature. As Quinz Oldenhof has observed:“ ... For the vast majority of the bands it’s all about acting evil – not beingevil, or trying to make others become evil. It’s been a rat race of who can bethe ‘evilest’ for decades. You simply can’t put daisies on your album cover whenyou sing about guts and corpses. Once again, I think that no band has thatintent to promote an evil/ satanic cabal, or force a satanic message on to theiraudience – neither in your face nor subliminal.“ ... All in all, I think the bands that operate under the level of themainstream are just looking for good fun and to try to make it. If it takesacting evil, (instead of being evil,) for shock value and record sales, why not?Bands like Baphomet’s Blood, (total Motorhead/ Lemmy worship,) Inferno, Chapeland Gehennah, to name but a few – they`re all about tongue-in-cheek, shits andgiggles. Good clean fun and rock ’n’ roll.“Come to think of it, Metal fans are probably the nicest crowd to control forfestival security people. There’s never any violence, no weapons, no drugs. Ofcourse, there’s a few that smoke pot, but overall it’s just a bunch of beerdrinking-sweethearts that want to have a good time.”Glen Benton of Florida Death Metal pioneers Deicide, has commented:“I say, don’t blame people like me, and (Marilyn) Manson, because we never said,‘hey, we’re going to be role models for all your kids.’ That ain’t what this isabout. It’s about entertainment.”Even the heartwarmingly-named Necrobutcher of the Norwegian Black Metal bandMayhem, (of whom, more later,) observes:“The people we scared are scared, and the people who understood the joke arestill there, and just smiling about the whole thing.”Before adding:“It’s not totally a joke, of course. It’s something that the government couldn’tcontrol, you know? They tried to keep us down, and by doing that, what happened?Cult legends.”Slayer lead singer/ bassist Tom Araya is cited as a good example of one ofMetal’s many actors. Despite screaming about death, destruction and nihilism, healleges to be a devout Catholic who makes a cross when he leaves the stage afterevery gig. It’s hard to know how to reconcile his nice-guy off-stage image withhis band’s recital of early lyrics such as: “Bleeding on your knees, mysatisfaction is what I need. The urge to take my fist and violate every orifice.You’re nothing, beaten into submission, raping again and again.” Even if, inmore recent times, Slayer’s lyrical themes have shifted towards ‘exposing’ theagendas of the New World Order and the Illuminati. Go figure.WHAT’S THE INTENTION?In this regard, Metal’s apologists often cite the concept of Intent as being keyto whatever effect listening to their music may have. Just as with predictiveprogramming, advertising subliminals and covert symbolism, the net effect on theobserver depends on what the Will of the creator of the artform was at itssource. This is carried forward in the form of an energetic signature, andreceivers of the art make a connection with it on an unseen level. It happenswhether or not the receiver recognises it, and whether or not their investmentin ego prompts them to call it out as ‘bullshit.’ It doesn’t make a difference.It’s how the dynamics of this reality work.If Metal’s death-obsessed imagery really is all about shits and giggles,therefore, no harmful effects are likely to be experienced by the listener inthis regard. It may well be that many of the prominent musicians in these genrescome with no negative intent towards their listeners, and really do believe inthe ‘fun’ aspect of what they peddle.This benign scenario only takes place, however, if all acts within these genresreally are out for a bit of good-natured fun. Unfortunately – as we’ve seen inso many other parts of this story – mega-successful music acts of any genre onlyget there through compliance with the corporate, and so often, socialengineering agendas of their record company overlords. And major record labels –again, borne out by so much evidence presented elsewhere in this book – are sooften in bed with the military intelligence community who, despite theirwell-meaning public images, aren’t generally known for their goal of unifyingand inspiring humanity for the greater good of all.We’ll continue to decipher this conundrum throughout this chapter. But let’s, atthis point, look at the most enduring visual calling-card associated for decadeswith all expressions of the harder side of Rock.THE HORN SECTIONThe ‘devil horns’ is a concept that goes all the way back to Ancient India, andhad a far more positive and empowering meaning than its use in modern timesconveys. The hand sign was intended to ward off evil spirits and remove sicknessor negative thoughts. Other cultures adopted it as a motif to dissipate thepower of ‘the evil eye,’ a curse believed to be cast by way of a malevolentstare. It became a part of the Apotropaic magic system practiced in parts ofSouthern Europe.The sign is considered to take on an offensive meaning, however, when directedtowards someone and swivelled back and forth, and was subsequently used as amethod of identification and communication by dark occult groups. It remainsvery similar to the hand gesture which has come to mean ‘I love you’ as part ofthe deaf sign language system introduced by Helen Keller, with much confusionarising between the two. Generally, Keller’s version involves the thumb beingextended outwards, with the ‘magick’ variation seeing the thumb tucked aroundthe two lower fingers. (Keller is said to have herself been an occultist whoespoused the teachings of Theosophy, so maybe there’s more to know about herapparently innocent and well-meaning system?)The thin line between the two has allowed the horns’ malevolent appearances tobe written off as the user simply stating ‘I love you’ to disguise what may havea far more negative connotation – particularly when used by a politician,oligarch or some other expression of the New World Order establishment, who arenot generally known for their big-hearted love of all.A further use of the sign is found in American sports. In its guise as the ‘Hook‘Em Horns,’ it is the slogan and greeting signal of the University of Texas atAustin, where it is said to symbolise the head and horns of the UT mascot, theTexas Longhorn Bevo. Among occultists, the sign is considered an evocation ofthe Pagan god Pan in Wiccan culture, and of the androgynous ‘sabbatic goat’entity of Baphomet, as depicted by the artist Eliphas Levi – both revered withincertain secret societies.Common use of the ‘horns’ within Rock, meanwhile, can be traced back to thepsychedelic band Coven. From 1968, frontwoman Esther ‘Jinx’ Dawson would startand finish each of the group’s gigs by flashing the sign. The back cover oftheir 1969 debut album showed band members giving it the horns. Whatever themotives of those later acts influenced by their example, Coven’s intentionswould appear to be less rooted in sales-generating controversy, than in agenuine adeptness at occult ritual. More of that shortly.The sign was more widely associated with Ronnie James Dio, who became the leadsinger of Black Sabbath in 1979. Dio stated that his Italian grandmother hadused it to ward off the ‘evil eye.’ It became something of a personal trademarkfor him at Sabbath concerts, replacing Ozzy Osbourne’s penchant for flashing upthe ‘peace’ sign. In a 2001 interview for the Metal-Rules.com website, heexplained:“ ... I think you’d have to say that I made it fashionable ... It was a symbolthat I thought was reflective of what that band was supposed to be all about.It’s not the devil’s sign, like we’re here with the devil ... It’s just asymbol, but it had magical incantations and attitudes to it, and I felt itworked very well with Sabbath.”(As an interesting aside, Black Sabbath came to be associated with theCIA-linked Copeland family profiled in the previous chapter, when five of thegroup’s albums from 1989 to ’95 were released on Miles Copeland Jr.’s IRSRecords label.)Earlier that decade, the sign had been enthusiastically adopted as part ofGeorge Clinton and Bootsy Collins’ Parliament and Funkadelic acts, being used asthe ‘password’ to the groups’ fabled ‘Mothership’ motif, and being flashed bymembers of the audience at their live shows as a token of appreciation. Thevideo to Afrika Bambaataa and the Soul Sonic Force’s ‘Planet Rock’ opens withcrowd members flashing up the horn sign at a concert. A painting of Gene Simmonsof the group Kiss used the horns on the cover of 1977’s ‘Love Gun’ album, andSimmons went on to use the sign frequently, both on and off stage.Quinz Oldenhof has commented, somewhat wryly, that Anthrax guitarist Scott Ianseems to have a severe case of arthritis that causes his hand to be twisted intoa constant horn sign posture. Poor chap. The gesture is also similar to the oneadopted by the Los Angeles street gang known as The Bloods to identify itsmembers, and even to one employed by Paul Hogan in the first ‘Crocodile Dundee’movie to tame a wild animal.WHERE ‘ART’ AND RITUAL MEETContemporaneous with both Coven and Black Sabbath were the British group BlackWidow, whose song and album titles have included ‘Attack of the Demon,’ ‘Come tothe Sabbat,’ ‘Sacrifice,’ ’In Ancient Days’ and ’Sleeping With Demons.’ Foundingmember Clive Jones certainly didn’t sound as if he was being tongue-in-cheek orironic when asked if he was still interested in satanism in an interview withthe Mourning the Ancient website:“Yes, I am still interested, and I have met the devil twice. Once on my own inthe daylight, and once at night with some other band members, from another band.So for certain, I am a believer. We learned a lot about black magic for thefirst album, ‘Sacrifice’.”One of Black Widow’s most talked-about promotional pictures, shows vocalist KipTrevor about to plunge a sword into the naked body of a woman. The band wasreportedly contacted by a male witch named Alex Sanders, who warned them thattheir ‘art’ was too close to genuine satanic rituals for comfort. As Clive Jonesrecounts:“Well, there were many moments in the stage rituals that were correct. AlexSanders always said that we could make something appear on the stage, even if wecould not see it at the time. I think when we first started doing the act live,we played at a club in Derbyshire, and priests turned up to try and stop theshow, holding crosses up in front of the stage.”And so, back to the aforementioned Chicago-based Coven, (its name meaning acollective of witches.) This band remains particularly notable within the whole‘satanism in Rock’ debate through – seemingly – committing the recording of anactual black mass to vinyl in the form of their debut album, thecharmingly-titled ’Witchcraft Destroys Minds and Reaps Souls.’ Although thegroup’s sound was more entrenched in the late 60s psychedelic style, they areconsidered to have been forerunners to the Heavy Rock scene, particularlythrough their confrontational style and shocking imagery – both standardhallmarks of what would come later.The band was discovered by a producer named Bill Traut, who was a student of thehorror author and occultist HP Lovecraft, and a fan of the British occult writerDennis Wheatley. Along with a company called Open Door Management, Traut had arecord label named Dunwich Records, named after the fictional town whichappeared in one of Lovecraft’s celebrated horror novels. Chris Drapeau explains:“At the time, the band were already doing a lot of satanic ideas in their liveshow. They were doing a very watered-down, shorter black mass. They would bebrought out in coffins. This was in the late 60s, around the same time as theadvent of Anton La Vey’s Church of Satan. This Bill Traut guy wanted to record ablack mass. That was his main focus for this project. So the cover has the threemain members of the band with a skull, and they’re all wearing rosaries withinverted crosses.“And when you open up the album ... the lead singer, Jinx Dawson, is completelynude, laid out on an altar with a chalice on her chest and a skull over hergenitals. The rest of the band and a bunch of other people are around herthrowing the horns in the air, and they’re having a satanic mass.”The album might be one to leave off the playlist for the next children’sbirthday party then. Song titles include ‘White Witch of Rose Hall,’ ‘ForUnlawful Carnal Knowledge,’ (which later became the title of an album by VanHalen,) ‘Pact with Lucifer,’ ‘Choke, Thirst, Die,’ ‘Dignitaries of Hell,’ and‘Satanic Mass’ – the latter purporting to be just what it says in its title.Hearing this may conjure up recollections of what John Todd had to say about histime working in the US music industry, as referenced in a previous chapter. Whatmay be an intriguing variation on it, came from a far more recent album by theFoo Fighters, fronted by Dave Grohl, (whose family links and backgroundconnections were also discussed in the previous chapter.) Shunning computermethods for a back-to-the-old-school approach, the group’s 2011 album ‘WastingLight,’ was mastered on analogue reel-to-reel tape, reportedly in Grohl’sgarage. A far less conventional gimmick, however, involved small shreds of theoriginal master tape being placed inside the first CD copies of the album. Grohldecided it would be “an extraordinary move to destroy all the masters and givethe pieces of the tapes to the fans.” A live feed of the tape machine inoperation was streamed on the band’s website during the record’s production.Reflections inspired by Todd’s accounts on what could – conceivably – be gettingput into music on an unseen level, leads to some other possibilities. ChrisDrapeau has considered some potential implications of home recording methods asyet another by-product of the digital/ technological age into which we’ve beenflung at an alarming rate over the past two decades.“Now that everything’s digital you can have the most minuscule set-up, and youhave the wherewithal to create really great, high-quality music right in yourhouse. And there’s countless different programmes – what they call Digital AudioWorkstation programmes. I have one that I use to record all my music with, and Istarted thinking while I was listening to the John Todd lecture ... what kind ofspells could even have been cast on some of these programmes, or what could bebaked into them?“Because now, you’ve got independent musicians and hobbyists that are recordingwith all these different programmes and platforms, and could be releasing musicwhere these kinds of ideas – these dark hexes and stuff – could have been placedon these programmes. And a lot of these programmes upload a track directly toSoundcloud as soon as you’ve mixed and mastered it. And then it’s out there inthe internet domain for people to check out.“If that’s the case, then they’ve got millions of people in their homes doingthe work for them!”Still along similar lines, a question which has been raised by a number ofresearchers – particularly by Jan Irvin and Hans Utter on their excellent ‘TheSecret History of FM Radio’ podcasts – is why certain tracks have always beenfavoured for airplay over and above all others. Most of us will be familiar withthe scenario. It seems as if every time you turn on a certain station, or aparticular video TV channel, the same handful of songs are on constant rotation,preventing other music from less-familiar artists from getting valuableexposure. (The Eagles’ ‘Hotel California’ or Toto’s ‘Africa’, anyone?)The cynical view, is that there are backhanders taking place between the recordlabels and the broadcasters. Certainly, Payola is as old as the industry itself.But what if there are other motivations behind getting certain songs embeddedinto the public consciousness? This could be for social engineering in terms ofnormalising certain lyrical themes, but there could also be manipulation at asonic level with the frequencies involved in the recordings.Much consolidation has taken place in the US corporate radio industry – just asin mainstream news outlets – with large numbers of music stations beingcontrolled by ever fewer points of decision-making power. The iHeartMedia empirestands as a great example, at last check owning 47 Rock stations amidst itscolossal portfolio. iHeartMedia evolved out of the Clear Channel network in2014, proudly announcing its “success in becoming a one-of-a-kind multi-platformmedia company, with unparalleled reach and impact.” It’s not as if we’re nottold what’s happening every step of the way.MEET THE FAMILYBack to Coven’s album anyway, (as digression seems to be an inevitableconsequence of trying to piece these vast swathes of connected informationtogether!) ‘Witchcraft Destroys Minds ... ’ was pulled by its label, MercuryRecords, in the wake of the public outcry it unsurprisingly generated. Bandmember James Vincent, who wrote many of the songs at Bill Traut’s request, wenton to become a musician in the Christian Rock genre. I guess he wasn’t built foran entire satanic career. Jinx Dawson, meanwhile, who rocked a look reminiscentof that of Debbie Harry, has continued to tour under the name of Coven, andappears to have none of the qualms that Vincent did. Her background certainlymakes for some interesting studying. In an interview with the ‘Confessions of aPop Culture Addict’ website, she revealed:“I was born into the occult. I came from a background as a child where mygreat-grandfather and great aunts were part of the Post-Victorian Spiritual Age,where popular interests were anything from Houdini, to ghosts, to seances, tomesmerism, to pendulums and fortune-telling, to Hoodoo and castingspells ... and powerful secret-societies were very much in effect, of which theywere head members. They had an extensive library of occult books in their largeItalianate mansion, which I eagerly read. They held many rituals in thathouse ... “I am from a very long lineage of occult adepts and practitioners of the ancientarts. Some of them were members of the U.A.O.D., (United Ancient Order ofDruids.) Others were members of the Rosicrucian group Ordo Aureæ et Rosæ Crucis,(Order of the Golden and Rosy Cross.)“I am of the Mayflower Society, a direct descendant of John Howland, 13thsignatory to the Mayflower Compact. Members of my family were also active inFreemasonry. My father was a 33rd-degree Scottish Rite Mason, and mygrandfather, a former Lt. Governor of Indiana, was High Priest of the Royal ArchMasons. My great-grandfather was in the private circle of US president TeddyRoosevelt. And we are listed in the book ‘The First Families of America.’ So Iam steeped in American Illuminati.”No need for baseless speculation or implied guilt-by-association there, then.Yet more examples of popular music’s links with all aspects of theEstablishment, and straight from the horse’s mouth. And anyone still thinkFreemasons are all about doing good for the local community and helping eachother out in business deals?A valid question might well be: with a background in occult secret-societies andmystery school teachings such as Dawson’s ... why would she feel compelled topursue a career in the popular music industry if not to knowingly implant theteachings of these institutions into the unwitting public’s consciousness? It’sthe same principle as current-day stage shows such as the US Super Bowl and theGrammys, with the likes of Katy Perry, Madonna and Nicki Minaj, flauntingritualistic symbology right in front of a largely clueless audience.And finally, in a bizarre twist relating back to the pioneering group whichCoven is said to have greatly inspired, its bass guitarist Greg Osborne wasknown colloquially as ‘Oz Osborne,’ while ‘Black Sabbath’ is the title of one ofthe songs on their debut album. Ring any bells? (The English group has alwaysclaimed its naming was inspired by the 1963 Boris Karloff movie ‘BlackSabbath.’)A more contemporary band who seem to have continued Heavy Rock’s obsession withthe occult into the current age, meanwhile, is Tool. And the family links ofmember Danny Carey – like Dawson’s – do not disappoint. As the band’s officialwebsite openly proclaims:“Relatively normal, an element of mystery was added to Danny’s childhood, whenone day he spied his father with a large sword conducting a Masonic ritual.Danny would later notice himself performing similar movements when he beganplaying drums at the age of thirteen ... “Despite not becoming a Mason or aligning himself with any other school ofreligion, Danny has maintained his heritage’s interest in occult studies.Endeavours into this realm have manifested periodically, such as the time heachieved insight into a hidden aspect of the unicursal hexagram, utilising anastral journey initiated through meditation and DMT.“ ... He then performed a ritual utilising his new-found knowledge of theunicursal hexagram, to generate a pattern of movement in space ... The resultingrhythm and gateway summoned a daemon he has contained within ‘the Lodge’, thathas been delivering short parables similar to passages within the ‘Book ofLies.’ Danny recommends as a device of protection and containment, a thoroughstudy and utilisation of the underlying geometry of the Temple of Solomon foranyone purchasing their next record.”Wait ... was that just a brazen admission that a form of spellcasting takesplace with records put out by the industry?(Incidentally, a hero of the more underground side of electronic dance musicthrough the 1990s, was Richard D. James, who released records under the name ofAphex Twin. He seemed to enjoy toying with his audience by use of mind games,and in interview, admitted to being a spellcaster, stating that the Aphex Twinlogo is what is known in magick as a sigil.)Tool’s other band members also talk of achieving altered states ofconsciousness, and channeling this through their music.WHAT ON EARTH POSSESSED YOU?The notion of genuine demonic possession and its connection to Rock, entered thepublic consciousness in an alarming manner in late 2015, when a serial rapistand father-of-two named Donnie Renfrew was sentenced to ten years in prison.Renfrew was convicted of sexually and physically abusing and mentally torturingfive women over a 26-year-period. He was in relationships with each of the womenat the time, and each stated that his behaviour was triggered by his listeningto Heavy Metal music. One, giving evidence, told the court:“He would stick his tongue out, his eyes were bulging and he would jump aboutand dance to the music. It was heavy, heavy Metal he listened to.”In response, Renfrew told the prosecutor: “I used to open my eyes like OzzyOsbourne and stick my tongue out,” before demonstrating the facial expression.Another of his victims stated that the walls in his flat were all painted red,(one of the principal colours associated with Saturn, from which the word‘satanism’ is derived,) with upside-down crosses hung on them.The shock generated by this case had similarly been evoked in the US over 30years previous, in the story of a 17-year-old drug dealer and self-professedSatanist named Ricky Kasso. He was also an enthusiastic fan of Heavy Metal,citing Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest as his inspirations. In the Summer of1984, Kasso murdered his friend Gary Lauwers in the woods of Newport, New York,while high on mescaline. As an article on the ‘Heavy Blog Is Heavy’ sitedetails:“According to the coroner’s report, Kasso allegedly stabbed his friend 36 timesand sliced out his eyes, which led to media propagation that the murder wasritualistic in nature ... For months afterwards, the media presented Kasso as asatanist who was part of a cult, further fuelling the hysteria that wasengulfing America ... A press-release following the incident was released bySuffolk County Police, and claimed that Kasso regularly partook in ritualshonouring the devil.“The notion that Kasso was a devil worshipper was further backed up by his ownfather, who claimed his son was obsessed with reading about witchcraft andwearing apparel featuring satanic symbols. On the day Kasso was arrested, he waswearing an AC/DC shirt, for instance, and this led to the inevitable associationbetween Heavy Metal and his atrocities by the media vultures, religious figuresand concerned parents looking for a scapegoat.“He would kill himself in prison under 48 hours later.”In 2005, the UK’s BBC2 TV channel aired a documentary under its ‘This World’banner, titled ‘The Death Metal Murders.’ It included a section examining anItalian Metal group known as The Beasts of Satan. Between 1998 and 2004, theyembarked on a series of tortures, sacrifices and murders – including withintheir own group – and cited their obsession with the dark themes espoused intheir music as their inspiration. Michele Tollis, the father of one of theirmurder victims, attended more than 80 Metal concerts during a six-year searchfor his son, culminating in the discovery of his body. He commented:“No-one can contradict me when I say that Heavy Metal and satanism are closelylinked. They go hand-in-hand, they’re inseparable. I say this without the shadowof a doubt.”Priest Don Aldo Buonaito, called for Death Metal to be banned in light of theBeasts of Satan case, commenting: “If music makes itself an instrument ofnefarious deeds and death, it should be stopped.”The ‘This World’ documentary went on to observe, that the average, well-adjustedyouth could not reasonably be expected to respond in such extreme ways to theirchosen genre of music. Beasts of Satan murderer Mario Maccione commented:“You can count on the fingers of one hand the number of people who have donewhat we have done. Of the millions of people who listen to Metal music, no-one –I repeat, no-one – has ever been involved in anything like this. In fact, manymore people have done things like this who do not listen to Metal at all.”And as Quinz Oldenhof adds:“Thousands of people commit suicide every year, and thousands do stupid stuff,often ending with an occasional death. They all listen to music, but no one evermakes a court case out of a Chopin or Ace of Base fan incident.”The problems we do get, it seems, begin with fans who are already blighted bysome form of depression, mental issues or angst. It is in these circumstances,according to interviewee Don Roberts of Stanford University, that issues ofconcern arise:“What the music may well be doing, is simply reinforcing beliefs that they mighthave started with in the first place, and building on them and justifying theirworldview, legitimising the way they feel. The lyrics are violent, the lyricsare misogynist, the lyrics are depressed and depressing, the lyrics are satanic.They talk about suicide, they talk about self-mutilation. The very kinds ofthings we’re worried that these problem kids will get engaged in.”This ultra-violent playout of events, raises the question of whether suchscenarios are made to manifest through the participants revelling in dark,negative energy through their lifestyles. There are stories of woeful misfortunebefalling the film crews who made ‘The Exorcist’ and ‘The Omen,’ the idea beingthat a full-time immersion in themes of death and destruction – albeit ‘art’ –bring a synchronistic connection with expressions of these dense energies.Were these horrific events an inevitable result of this dynamic? And could moreuntimely deaths of key players within Rock music be attributed to these samefactors, if occult ritual is far more a regular part of music industry practicethan most of us would ever consider?The notion of possession got a topical rendering in the 2009 movie ‘Crowley,’meanwhile, which was co-written by Iron Maiden frontman Bruce Dickinson, joiningthat long line of rockers infatuated by the infamous occultist. (Another wasOzzy Osbourne, who created the song ‘Mr. Crowley.’) In the narrative, Dickinsonand director Julian Doyle imagine “the Great Beast’s spirit being reborn intothe body of a mild-mannered professor, resulting in all manner of horror andchaos.”WHAT LIES BENEATHAlthough there were attempts by moral campaigners to associate other violentacts involving young people with Metal, it was a 1990 case based around themusic of the British group Judas Priest which really penetrated the Americanpublic mindset.The court heard how two youths, 18-year-old Raymond Bellknap and 20-year-oldJames Vance, had spent the night of 23rd December 1985 drinking, smoking weed,and allegedly listening to Heavy Metal music. They then headed to a playgroundat a church in Sparks, Nevada, with the intention of killing themselves with a12-gauge shotgun in a pact. Bellknap died instantly. Vance shot himself butsurvived, succumbing to his injuries three years later.The prosecution, commissioned by the youths’ parents, alleged that the pair hadbeen subliminally influenced by an audio message placed backwards into the song’Better By You, Better By Me’ from Judas Priest’s 1978 album ‘Stained Class.’The message is said to come out as “do it, do it” when played backwards, andthis is alleged to have triggered the pair’s suicide attempt against their will.It became the most famous case in the subject known as ‘backmasking,’ (coveredin-depth in this book’s first volume.) The lawsuit was dismissed on 24th August1990, when the judge ruled that the alleged message was a result of anaccidental mix-up of background lyrics. There are far clearer examples ofpurported backmasked messages than ‘do it, do it’ – Slayer’s ‘Hell Awaits,’(another one to leave off the playlist for the next family barbecue, I wouldsuggest,) is said to render the message “join us” when played backwards.Although on face value this seems like a quite ambiguous message, in 1996, theparents of 15-year-old Elyse Marie Pahler took Slayer to a California court in afailed attempt to ban the sale of their brand of music. Elyse had been raped andmurdered by three youths. Although they stated they needed to make a ‘sacrificeto the devil’ in honour of their favoured band Hatred, it was two songs by thegroup Slayer – ‘Postmortem’ and ‘Dead Skin Mask’ – which Elyse’s parents claimedhad given detailed instructions to “stalk, rape, torture, murder and commit actsof necrophilia” on their daughter. Thy Infernal have a track titled ‘Armageddon’which is said to include the instruction “kill for Satan,” and many messageswere backmasked deliberately – by their own admission – into the music of theBeatles. Either way, the Judas Priest case only served to further cement theidea of dark and sinister elements to these musical styles.This case also seems to have acted as a precursor to one the following yearinvolving Ozzy Osbourne, and centred around the track ‘Suicide Solution’ fromhis 1980 album ‘Blizzard Of Oz.’ The parents of John McCollum pressed chargesagainst Osbourne when their depressed son committed suicide after allegedlylistening to the song, citing a lyric which was claimed to have said “Why try?Get the gun and shoot!” (forward this time, rather than backwards.) This casewas also thrown out.(Another aside ... At the time, the manager of Black Sabbath was Don Arden, borninto a Jewish family as Harry Levy, the father of Sharon, who would go on tobecome Ozzy’s wife. Arden said of the case: “To be perfectly honest, I would bedoubtful as to whether Mr. Osbourne knew the meaning of the lyrics, if there wasany meaning, because his command of the English language is minimal.” Arden wasa notorious figure in the London criminal underworld with later Mafia links, andwas widely feared within the music business. He was the manager of the SmallFaces for a time. A pair of legendary anecdotes have him dangling recordproducer Robert Stigwood upside-down from a first-floor window, and grinding alit cigar into the face of Fleetwood Mac manager Clifford Davis for apparentlytrying to cross him. Ozzy was fired by Black Sabbath in 1979, and became signedby Arden to his Jet record label. Ozzy’s marriage to Sharon in 1982 caused abitter 20-year estrangement between Arden and his daughter. Sharon once toldjournalist Mick Wall: “He’s an evil old bastard and I can’t wait for him todie.” He eventually did, in 2007, after a long battle with Alzheimer’s.)The legacy of the Judas Priest affair was far-reaching, as reported by the‘Heavy Blog Is Heavy’ website:“In 1985, a committee known as the Parents Music Resource Center, spearheaded byTipper Gore, made up a playlist of songs they deemed inappropriate. The list,dubbed ‘The Filthy 15,’ was used to serve as a template for proposed legislationregarding how albums should be rated, suggesting that they should come withextra warnings if the content pertained to sex, violence, drugs/ alcohol or theoccult.“Of the fifteen songs, nine were Metal, including: Judas Priest’s ‘Eat MeAlive,’ Motley Crue’s ‘Bastard,’ AC/DC’s ‘Let Me Put My Love Into You,’ TwistedSister’s ‘We’re Not Gonna Take It, ‘W.A.S.P’s ‘Animal (Fuck Like a Beast),’ DefLeppard’s ‘High ‘n Dry, ‘Mercyful Fate’s ‘Into the Coven,’ Black Sabbath’s‘Thrashed,’ and Venom’s ‘Possessed.’ However, what’s interesting, is how muchthey failed to capitalise on the mass satanic hysteria as much as they couldhave. For example, they chose an AC/DC song with sexual lyrics, as opposed tosay, ‘Highway to Hell’ or ‘Hell’s Bells,’ which were two of the band’s biggesthits, and could be interpreted as occult-themed and connected to Richard‘Nightstalker’ Ramirez, the satanic serial killer whose murder spree terrorisedGreater Los Angeles until the Summer of the year this hearing was held. The factRamirez also showed up to court with a pentagram carved into his own flesh,should have been enough to associate the band with satanism.”It was this process which led to the iconic Parental Advisory Label being placedon records, tapes and CDs by the American Recording Industry Association from1985 onwards, denoting explicit lyrical content ranging from overtly sexual, tographically violent, (and later to become as much a staple part of the ‘gangstarap’ genre as of the Metal scene.)(As another curious aside, many of the prominent British groups, such as BlackSabbath, Judas Priest, Napalm Death and Wolfsbane, originated from Birmingham orthe Black Country region of England. Black Widow were from the other side of theMidlands in Leicester.)IT’S GRIM UP NORTHHowever shocking the prominent acts within Heavy Rock were – and whether thiswas by calculated design or a reflection of the musicians’ true natures – theirantics pale compared to one niche expression of the genre. The Black Metal scenecoming out of Norway leaves little room for ambiguity, representing an outletfor genuine dark occult activity. Wikipedia describes the scene as follows:“ ... An extreme sub-genre and sub-culture of Heavy Metal music. Artists oftenappear in corpse paint and adopt pseudonyms ... Initially a synonym for ‘SatanicMetal’, Black Metal is often met with hostility from mainstream culture, due tothe actions and ideologies associated with it. Many artists express extremeanti-Christian and misanthropic views, advocating various forms of satanism orethnic paganism.”During the 1990s, affiliates of the scene were found to be responsible for aseries of church burnings across Norway. The proposed justification, was thatmany of Europe’s Christian churches were built on the sites of former Paganmonuments. The scene’s adherents were seeking to re-awaken the spirits of theirViking ancestors and revive their long-lost culture. According to stateprosecutor Bjorn Soknes, who interviewed many of the arsonists:“They were young, 16 to 22. They were lonely people. Many of them told us theywere listening over hours to Black Metal music before they burned churches.”The death-obsessed nature of the genre was expressed shockingly through membersof the founding group Mayhem, which contains the member Necrobutcher, and whoseimage fully embodied its ideologies. In April 1991, the group’s vocalist PerYngve Ohlin, who called himself ‘Dead,’ committed suicide while alone in a houseshared by the band. Fellow musicians had described him as being odd, introvertedand depressed, to the point of genuinely believing he was a walking corpse.‘Dead’ was found with his wrists slit and a shotgun wound to the head by Mayhemmember Øystein ‘Euronymous’ Aarseth.[../images/00015.jpeg]Nag of Tsjuder, an act on the Norwegian Black Metal scene; can ‘music’ get anydarker?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsjuder#/media/File:Tsjuder,_Jan-Erik_%E2%80%9ENag%E2%80%9C_Rom%C3%B8ren_at_Party.San_Metal_Open_Air_2013.jpg[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsjuder#/media/File:Tsjuder,_Jan-Erik_%E2%80%9ENag%E2%80%9C_Rom%C3%B8ren_at_Party.San_Metal_Open_Air_2013.jpg]Credit: Jonas RogowskiGetting his personal priorities straight, prior to calling the police,Euronymous grabbed a disposable camera and photographed the body. You know, likeyou do. One of his photographs was later used as the cover of an album, ‘Dawn ofthe Black Hearts,’ which showed a knife that he had carefully positioned to makefor a better picture before the police arrived. Euronymous is also said to havemade necklaces from parts of Dead’s skull, which he had removed from the crimescene, and to have given some pieces to Marduk and other bands.Euronymous didn’t last much longer himself. On the night of 10th August 1993,Varg Vikernes of the group Burzum got into an argument with Euronymous at hisapartment, resulting in Vikernes stabbing him to death. Varg had travelled therewith Snorre ‘Blackthorn’ Ruch of Thorns, who had just become Mayhem’s secondguitarist, and had intended to show Euronymous some new riffs. Snorre reportedlysaw the two fighting at the top of the stairs and ran off in terror. Vikernesclaimed the killing was in self-defence as Euronymous had plotted to stun himwith an electroshock weapon, tie him up and torture him to death whilevideotaping the event.Wham! with big hair, toothpaste smiles and ‘Choose Life’ T-shirts it is not.Shall we move on to something slightly, (only slightly, mind), happier ... ?"},{"pageContent":"Resources:Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 104 – Jeff Young – Music’s Dark Side: * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-104-jeff-youngGood Vibrations Podcast Episode 103 – Chris Drapeau – Satanism and Heavy Rock: * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-103-chris-drapeau [https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-103-chris-drapeau]The Overwhelming (and Overlooked) Darkness of Jinx Dawson and Coven: * http://people.com/music/jinx-dawson-coven-overlooked-Heavy-Metal-influencers/ [http://people.com/music/jinx-dawson-coven-overlooked-Heavy-Metal-influencers/]Wicked Woman: A Conversation with Jinx Dawson: * http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/ [http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/jinxdawson/]Satanic Panic: America’s War On Heavy Metal in the 1980s: * http://www.HeavyblogisHeavy.com/2016/11/30/Satanic-panic-americas-war-on-Heavy-Metal-in-the-1980s/ [http://www.HeavyblogisHeavy.com/2016/11/30/Satanic-panic-americas-war-on-Heavy-Metal-in-the-1980s/]Kids Interview Bands – Tom Araya of Slayer: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjdaW5ufzbg&t=227s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjdaW5ufzbg&t=227s]Scottish Daily Record: Tattooed serial rapist who turned into sex monster whenhe listened to Heavy Metal music is jailed for 10 years: * http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/tattooed-serial-rapist-who-turned-7015992 [http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/crime/tattooed-serial-rapist-who-turned-7015992]Revealed: The dark secrets of Sharon Osbourne’s dad, the Al Capone of pop: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-471446/Revealed-dark-secrets-Sharon-Osbournes-dad-Al-Capone-pop.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-471446/Revealed-dark-secrets-Sharon-Osbournes-dad-Al-Capone-pop.html]BBC2’s ‘This World’ documentary on Death Metal murders: * http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2005/11/23/cradle_of_filth_this_world_feature.shtml [http://www.bbc.co.uk/suffolk/content/articles/2005/11/23/cradle_of_filth_this_world_feature.shtml]Evidence of Conspiracy: Marranos masquerading as Christians: * https://web.archive.org/web/20140419215337/http [https://web.archive.org/web/20140419215337/http]://www.pseudoreality.org/westside.html [http://www.pseudoreality.org/westside.html]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6THE SCIENCE OF SOUNDHow frequencies – the building blocks of this ‘physical’ reality – lie at theroot of music and mind-control.“If one should desire to know whether a kingdom is well governed, if its moralsare good or bad, the quality of its music will furnish the answer.”Confucius, 551 BC-479 BC“Atmospheres are going to come through music, because music is in a spiritualthing of its own. It’s like the waves of the ocean. You can’t just cut out theperfect wave and take it home with you. It’s constantly moving all the time. Itis the biggest thing electrifying the earth. Music and motion are all part ofthe race of man.”Jimi Hendrix, ‘Life’ Magazine interview, July 1969“We were working secretly for the military,Our experiment in sound was nearly ready to begin,We only know in theory what we are doing,Music made for pleasure, music made to thrill.”Kate Bush: ‘Experiment IV’ (1986)Though I place little credibility on anything put out by the BBC, presenter SuzyKlein was on-point when she began her BBC4 TV series ’Tunes for Tyrants,’analysing how world leaders of the 20th century had harnessed music forpolitical means, with the observation:“What fascinates me is music’s uncanny ability to stir us up, to calm us down,to express every possible human emotion. It bypasses language and reason, andaims instead directly for our souls. And that’s what makes music so incrediblypowerful, and also potentially, incredibly dangerous ... Music can console usand it can corrupt us; inspire resistance, or collusion.”According to alternative and mainstream sources alike, the very reality in whichwe find ourselves having our human experience, is founded on sound frequencies.This apparent ‘physical’ existence only appears that way because of the way weperceive it into ‘solidity’ through our applied and shared consciousness. Thisis the origin of the often-quoted phrase “if a tree falls in the woods andthere’s no-one there to hear it, does it make a sound?,” implying that soundonly exists audibly when it’s decoded into that form. Otherwise, it exists aswaveform frequency only.With sound literally lying at the very core of everything we perceive,therefore, it becomes rife for manipulation by would-be controllers ofmalevolent intent.432 VS. 440Since I started speaking publicly about music conspiracy issues, the questionI’ve had more than any other doesn’t concern the untimely death of a belovedrock idol, or which celebrities have sold their souls for fame and fortune. Theone that has grabbed people’s attention more than any other, concerns the truthabout 440 vs. 432 hertz, (hz meaning in this case, ‘vibrational cycles persecond.’) It’s a reference to the standard pitch which has been used for thetuning of musical instruments in the Western world – plus the frequency at whichrecorded music has been mastered – for the past several decades.For many years, the standard tuning pitch was set at A=432hz, where the musicalnote A vibrates at that frequency, and all subsequent notes come in proportionalaccordance. Musicians and audiophiles alike agreed that this was a natural,harmonic frequency, and an obvious choice.In 1917, however, attempts were made by America’s Rockefeller Foundation tochange the pitch to A=440hz. This failed to gain any ground at the time, so asecond attempt was made towards its instigation at the start of World War II. Aninternational conference held in London in 1939 recommended that A=440 beadopted. This suggestion was apparently supported by the BBC’s orchestra of thetime, who preferred 440 to the previous 439, as that corresponding frequency washard to generate using standard electronic clocks.In 1955, A=440hz was adopted by the International Organization forStandardization (ISO,) under the name ISO16. Wikipedia reports that the US timeand frequency station WWV, broadcasts a 440hz signal at two minutes past everyhour, with WWVH broadcasting the same tone at the first minute past every hour,and that this was added in 1936 to aid orchestras in tuning their instruments.(The Hebrew letter of ‘vav,’ incidentally, is interchangeable between V and W inthe English alphabet, and carries a numerical value of 6, so WWV in this regard,equates to the number 666. Is it just me, or have we come across that one beforesomewhere?)This decision perplexed musicologists, who maintained that 440, (described as‘equal temperament’ or ‘concert tuning,’) was anything but the sensible choicethat 432, (known as ‘just intonation,’) was. 432 is said to synchronise with therhythms of human brainwaves, the rest of nature and with the frequency of theearth itself, and music performed to that pitch is thought to therefore havehealing, or at the very least, soothing and calming properties.440, in contrast, was thought disturbing and dissonant on an unseen level, withmusic performed at that pitch having unsettling effects on those exposed to it.It’s frequently claimed, (though difficult to prove,) that the Nazisexperimented by performing military music pitched at 440, and observed theanxious and stressful states that it would bring about in the soldiers marchingto it. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, so the story goes, added his voiceto those campaigning for this to become the standard.Applications now exist on-line where users can convert recordings made at 440into a 432 version. It’s interesting that a Google search of “432 vs 440hz”mainly throws up results denouncing the idea that the change could have been anykind of malevolent move as “claptrap” or “a ridiculous conspiracy theory,” whenthere are thousands of articles and videos giving the other side of the argumentwhose results do not get shown, as any intrepid researcher will find.According to an article on the ‘Why Don’t You Try This?’ website, titled ‘440hzMusic – Conspiracy to Detune us From Natural 432hz Harmonics?:’“Music has a hidden power to affect our minds, our bodies, our thoughts, and oursociety. When that music is based upon a tuning standard purposely removed fromthe natural harmonics found in nature, the end result may be the psychicpoisoning of the mass mind of humanity.”Audio producer Long Lastin’ expanded upon this idea when guesting on episode 99of ‘Good Vibrations’:“432 is about mathematics and sacred geometry, and 432 sits within the harmoniesof music. It’s the absolutely perfect pitch, and it’s a healing pitch. When youcome out of 432 and 528 and go to normal tuning like 440, it doesn’t sit nicelywithin the mathematics of the geometry, because sound is actually a shape.“There are certain notes on a keyboard that represent a circle, a triangle, asquare, a hexagon. And within those shapes is hidden the degrees – like a circlehas 360, a triangle is 180 ... When it’s in 432, it stretches right across thekeyboard in perfect harmony. But when it’s in 440, certain notes are just out infrequency and don’t vibrate well.”ALL IN THE NUMBERSIt seems there’s far more to 432 than just some randomly-allotted figure when itgets factored into a particular cosmic sequence. This plays itself out in anumber of prominent ways, providing confirmation that numbers are inherentlywoven into the fabric of creation. All components in the sequence are multiplesof 9, and in every case, reducing the figures back down to a single number willalways bring you back to 9. It’s the only sequence in existence that will bringyou back to the same single number in this way.The sequence starts with 27, a number which has earned its place in music lorethrough the fabled 27 Club, referring to the large number of musicians who justhappen to have died at the age of 27 in some suspicious circumstance or other.The number then gets doubled each time, so we get 54, 108, 216, 432, 864, etc.Allotting neutral zeros to these key numbers, we see them cropping up in allkinds of places. Yogic schools apparently teach that all living beings exhaleand inhale 21,600 times a day. The Kali Yuga is said to last 432,000 years,being part of the Great Cycle which itself lasts 4,320,000 years. There are864,000 seconds in a day – 432,000 for day, and 432,000 for night.[../images/00016.jpeg]The geometric Flower of Life, associated with harmony of sound.https://pixabay.com/en/flower-of-life-sacred-geometry-1601163[https://pixabay.com/en/flower-of-life-sacred-geometry-1601163]Credit: No attribution requiredThe Pyramid of the Sun monument at Mexico’s Teotihuacan has an overall base of864STU (Standard Teotihuacan Units.) An equilateral triangle whose area andperimeter are equal, gives the square root of 432. The number of times that ahealthy human male’s heart beats in 12 hours is stated to be 432,000. InBabylonian/ Sumerian folklore, there were ten kings who lived from creation tothe time of the Great Flood, a period given as 432,000 years.Another dizzying array of 432 expressions comes from the article by Joseph E.Mason (of all names,) which resides here: http://www.greatdreams.com/432.htm[http://www.greatdreams.com/432.htm]The number and its derivatives crop up many times in the traditionalheliocentric model of the Earth, Sun and Moon. 864,000 miles is said to be thediameter of the sun. The moon is claimed to have a diameter of 2,160 miles. OneAstrological age in a Precessional cycle is said to be 2,160 years. According toGraham Hancock’s book ‘Fingerprints Of The Gods,’ the Great Pyramid of Giza is arepresentation of the northern hemisphere of the Earth on a scale of 43,200. Thepolar diameter of Saturn is given as 108,000km, and its orbital period is saidto be 10,800 days. I no longer accept this notional model of our Earth and itsluminaries, which means these statistics are rendered invalid to me personally.But that’s a story for a whole different kind of book! It remains interesting,however, to reflect on just how and why these figures in particular wereascribed to these models, being expressions of the same cosmic sequence as theyare.A real mindblower comes from applying the Jewish Gematria method to the word‘Jesus.’ Doing this gives it a numerical rendering of 45666, (interesting lastthree figures,) and if you multiply all these together you end upwith ... 43,200.THE LOVE FREQUENCYThere is another vibration which is cited as being beautiful and harmonic, andit’s related to 432. This is what is known as ‘the Love Frequency’ of 528hz,connected to the original Solfeggio musical scale. As Long Lastin’ observes:“You’ve also got 528hz, which is the heart frequency, which is the frequency oflove ... You can also tune your music up to 528. You can find that it actuallyheals people. There’s talk of tuning and frequencies being used in the pyramidsof Egypt for healing. Also, back in the days when churches used to have choirs,they had Gregorian music and chants, which went on to be banned by the CatholicChurch ... one of the main reasons is because these chants and these singerswere found to be causing spontaneous healing, and they couldn’t have thatbecause the Church wanted to be the only healers.”One of the most high-profile advocates of 528hz, has been the American naturalhealth activist and musicologist Dr. Len Horowitz. Explaining in a 2013interview on American ‘Coast to Coast’ radio just why 528 has such a vitalconnection to the human condition, Horowitz stated:“There are actually nine core creative frequencies to the universe. We now knowthat there’s a perfect circle of sound. We now know that the sun is beaming528hz as part of a central frequency within it, and that among those nine corecreative frequencies, we find the original musical scale.“The way the entire universe is constructed – including we the people – isthrough a musical, mathematical matrix composed of nine simple core creativefrequencies ... The original musical scale was six notes. And the thirdnote – the miracle note of the original scale, as well as the entireuniverse – is 528.“There’s good and evil in the universe ... evil is part of nature. It’s part ofwhat God created, and it’s actually the frequency 741, which in fact isresonating in the A=440hz standard tuning of the Western world’s music. So we’reactually listening to a frequency in all of the Western world’s music today,that vibrates to the tone that vibrates in dissonance to 528 – love, miracles.“If you study the A=440hz standard tuning in music that we’re all listeningto ... then what we realise is that it’s suppressing the 528, it’s suppressingthe heart chakra. Everything from the throat chakra down is suppressed, andeverything from the throat chakra up is stimulated, including the left-brainegoic mind – the reasonable, rational mind that science plays on ... “This is at least a major factor in science becoming like the new God.”As with 432, derivatives of 528 also crop up in other walks of life; there are5,280 feet in a mile, for instance.GOOSEBUMPS ABOUNDMusicologist Dr. Hans Utter guested on my podcast series in 2017. On the subjectof how sound affects mood, he observed:“Auditory frequencies are affecting your body. So, even though you’re hearingthem through your ears, they’re also resonating with different portions of yourbody. Our sense of hearing is mediated. We’re constructing the sound that weexperience in our own minds. That’s why when you hear a song and you getgoosebumps, it’s connecting with your emotional centres. It may also beconnecting with your past. There is an effect that can happen from thefrequencies themselves.“Music mirrors the way that we see the world, and the way that we can constructthe past. So when you get chills from hearing something, that means the sounditself, and whatever it’s evoking, is travelling through your whole nervoussystem, through your whole being.”This goes some way to explaining why music – more than any other medium – is sopowerful in evoking memories and nostalgia, and hearing a pop song from decadesprevious can make us feel like we’re right back in the times and circumstancesthat we were when we first heard it. As my friend RW Sanders once remarked:“I can remember all the lyrics to lots of songs from fifty years ago, but Icannot remember why I came into the kitchen. It is true that music touches us inways nothing else can. Considering all the music ever written uses the sametwelve notes, that is amazing.”Everyone loves some kind of music, whether it’s military brass bands, hardcoreDrum & Bass, or anything in between. Can the same be said for any other aspectof human culture? A medium that can have this much power over the emotionalstates of billions of people, is a gift to a malevolent manipulator. Kate Bush’ssong ‘Experiment IV’ talked of a secret military plan to create a sound that washorrific enough to kill people. Even Hergé’s Tintin comic book stories addressedthe concept; 1956’s ‘The Calculus Affair’ is about the military of two nationsgrappling over a device that can destroy entire cities through the use ofsonics. In many ways – psychological and spiritual, as well asmilitarily – sound could be considered the greatest potential weapon of all.WEAPONISED MUSICOLOGYMusic puts people into a heightened state of suggestibility, and when thisfactor is coupled with the influence of mind-altering drugs, it leavesparticipants at music events wide open to neurological moulding. With this inmind, it’s interesting to note that every popular music genre from the 1950sonwards has come with its own narcotic of choice, from the cannabis of reggae,to the heroin of punk, to the LSD of psychedelia, to the ecstasy of dancemusic ... Daniel Estulin, who has written books on the Bilderberg Group and the TavistockInstitute, had much to say on these matters in a 2016 radio interview:“So what happens with the hallucinogenic drugs ... they mimic certain aspects ofour psychosis ... one can literally induce temporary symptoms of psychosis andschizophrenia.“The Tavistock Institute had extensively studied the relationship between thebrain and behaviour caused by these drugs, and later on, the knowledge gleanedfrom the research was channelled into marketing and TV and radio stationsthrough classic oldies – songs from 15 to 25 years ago – which are targeted atthe adult population.“And so, what several Tavistock studies showed, was that a song or a piece ofmusic associated with one’s childhood, when heard later in life, would callforth memories and associations with that earlier period. And so you had,literally, these encoded memories of popular music in the listener, recalledwhen he or she heard the same piece of music, from 25 years ago.“So imagine if you were on drugs. That whole experience would be reproducedagain and again. These memories trigger an emotional drug flashback that setsoff an infantile emotional state, bringing the listener back to that time inwhich he or she literally experienced either an identity crisis, or some kind ofsituation where it was mirroring the drug reaction itself.”This is a process of behavioural entrainment through music. As Hans Uttercommented on the subject:“When you’re listening to a type of music, maybe an extremely dark type ofmusic – some type of industrial or death metal or something like that – it’skind of like the first time you ever had a drink of alcohol, the first time youever tasted coffee, you had a cigarette, it made you feel sick. And you’re like,‘man, this is horrible, how can anyone do this?’ The next thing you know you’readdicted, right?“So, that’s how these negative frequencies, if you keep getting exposed to them,it will start to become part of your environment.”TALKING SHOPAn institution which specialised in experimenting with the science of sound fromits inception in 1958 to its reported closure 40 years later, was the BBC’sRadiophonic Workshop, located within its Maida Vale studios in London. It wasreportedly set up to create unusual sound effects for radio programmes whichcouldn’t be attained through traditional instruments.Given that the BBC is a propaganda arm of the British Establishment – andfactoring in many elements of its true nature as highlighted in the previousbook – perhaps we shouldn’t be too surprised to find it has an entire departmentsteeped in this type of activity. Arguably, the Workshop’s most notable outputwas the theme tune to ‘Dr. Who,’ with its eerie use of test-tone oscillatornotes.Its first commercially-released record, meanwhile, was a 1962 reworking of atime signal created by Italian scientist Maddalena Fagandini, credited to anartist by the name of Ray Cathode. This was a pseudonym of George Martin, whotrained in methods of sound manipulation before going on to become the prominentproducer for the Beatles. (He was also taught music by the mother of Jane Asher,the 1960s girlfriend of “Paul McCartney.”) One of the Beatles’ earlyexperimental records as they began their transition from boy-band love songs topsychedelia, was ’Tomorrow Never Knows’ from the ‘Revolver’ album. ItsLennon-composed lyrics, based around ‘The Tibetan Book of the Dead,’ werecoupled with Martin’s use of the Leslie speaker cabinet, giving the filteredvocals their other-worldly feel.BENEATH THE WAVESThere are various different types of soundwaves which are measured by aninstrument known as an oscilloscope. This renders the sound in the form of wavepatterns on a screen. Besides sine and square waves, there is also what is knownas a sawtooth wave, so named because its form appears similar to the jaggedteeth of a saw. In a fascinating interview entitled ‘Ex Illuminati Druid on theOccult Power Of Music,’ (available on YouTube,) a former practicing witch by thename of William Schnoebelen addressed the application of the sawtooth wave inpopular music settings:“It’s a very disagreeable sound. It’s almost like the sound of fingernails on achalkboard. And what I find extremely interesting is that, with the advent ofthe electric guitar – some of the fuzz effect and all these weird sounds thatpeople like The Who and Hendrix and all these early pioneers of rock music woulddo – a lot of that involves sawtooth waves. And I think that’s why so manypeople would go to these concerts – not that the drugs didn’t help alongtoo – but their souls were being destroyed by the workings of these kinds ofsounds, especially at these high levels of amplitude and volume.”On the subject of Hendrix, the very intro to his ‘Purple Haze’ is cited as usingwhat has become known as ‘the Tritone,’ or ‘the devil’s interval.’ It’s aninterval between notes that is three whole tones apart. The result is thought tosound dissonant, as it is out of synch with the human mind’s natural rhythmpatterns.The Tritone is reputed to have been banned by the Catholic church, when its usein the classical music of the 18th century was deemed to be disharmonious, andhas been generally frowned upon by scholars and musicologists since. It speaksvolumes, (excuse the pun,) that it has been greatly favoured by some of Rock’smore raucous performers from the 1960s onwards, therefore. Black Sabbath’seponymous song is said to offer another prominent showcase of the Tritone, alongwith much of the output of Slayer. The theme tune to ‘The Simpsons’ has beencited as an unlikely example, too.Len Horowitz reflected further on ‘the devil’s interval’ in his 2013 ‘Coast toCoast’ radio interview:“It causes, if you play those two notes together, such tremendous stress, thatyou don’t want to listen to it. It’s really dissonant. And it’s strange, because528 Love harmonises with virtually everything except that.“So what you’re left with realising, is that 741 is part of nature and part ofthe original musical scale, but it’s in dissonance to Love. Which leaves us, asreaders of the book of 528, realising that evil is part of the matrix ofuniversal design, and we the people have to choose. It’s our choice. And ofcourse, freedom of Will and free choice is one of the greatest blessings thatthe Creator has given us, and that’s why we’re in this mess right now in theworld today.”SLAVE TO THE ALGORITHMAnother symptom of this technological age sits alongside sound frequencies inthe manipulators’ toolkit. This is the use of mathematical algorithms todetermine what will – or will not – make a music recording popular with themasses. Record companies have been employing scientists in this area fordecades, working in conjunction with teams of song-writers, and this factor hasbeen increasingly prevalent in recent years, as pop music has become more andmore homogenised, and ‘artists’ have become little more than cloned automatons,performing whatever material is given to them by their corporate paymasters.Technology has been over-riding human input for some time, and the incomingTranshumanist society is only going to see this dynamic increase unless it’sstopped in its tracks. A passionate music-head can immediately tell thedifference between a song that was composed because its creator had somethinggenuinely heartfelt to impart, versus one cynically concocted by a computerprogramme and churned out on a factory conveyor-belt. Unfortunately, the ratioof passionate music-heads, to those for whom music is just generic backgroundnoise to their busy lives, is woefully small, which is how the increaseddumbing-down of pop music has been able to fly under the radar unchallenged.Discernment has become a lost art.Though I certainly don’t agree with everything he has to say, UK broadcasterPaul Joseph Watson nailed it in his short YouTube video titled ‘The Truth AboutPopular Music’ when he opined:“Researchers in Spain using a huge archive known as the Million Song Dataset,found that pop music has become blander. Based on studies of pop songs from 1955to 2010, the team found that the diversity of transitions between notes, chords,melodies and other sounds, has diminished over the last 50 years. The Spanishstudy also found that producers are baking volume into songs at the productionstage, making them artificially louder. This over-compression has the effect ofsucking all the dynamics out of a song.“ ... Of course, artists used to have to be talented to get a recording deal inthe first place. Now, any stupid fucking bimbo or braindead twat can be draggedoff a reality show, chucked into a recording studio, and have their shrill,warbling auto-tuned for mass consumption. But when it comes to recording live,there’s no Auto-Tune to hide the fact that you have zero talent.“Songs are also sounding dumber and more repetitive, because the dwindlingattention span of the listener demands more hooks. So, whereas decades ago, youonly had to write in one hook to get a hit, now there has to be a hook in theintro, the verse, the bridge and the chorus, because a radio listener willchange the station on average every seven seconds, unless they get thiscontinual brain stimulation from a recurring hook.“ ... The music industry is now largely controlled by a handful of mercenarieswho have strangled originality and replaced it with predictive algorithms.Virtually everyone you see is little more than a programmed robot, spewing outnoises that a computer has decided upon beforehand. That’s why everything is sofucking sterile. That’s why there’s nothing subversive about music any more.Because whereas musicians used to be interesting people and have actualpersonalities – and that’s where the authenticity of the music came from – now,they’re more akin to handpicked Stepford Wives.”LOST IN TRANSLATIONA variation on predictive algorithms comes from the way so many of us nowreceive our music. There exists a generation of young fans who have only everknown downloadable mp3s appearing as icons on their laptop or iPhone screen, andto whom even a CD is an alien concept, let alone vinyl.Audiophiles were critical of digital formats when they first emerged, and manypour scorn on the idea of mp3s. The objection is to the way computers decide forthemselves, in compressing a much larger audio file into one of more manageablesize, which parts of the original recording to leave out. It will strip awaycertain frequencies and background detail deemed indiscernible to the human ear,with the brain relied upon to fill in the blanks. What remains is are-synthesised and distorted version of what was there before.The problem, for those who take the science of audio seriously, is that today’syoung generation have got used to listening to mp3s of very low bit-rates, (128or 192kbps,) compressed for space-saving convenience, and because, as one of myaudiophile friends put it, “we can’t be bothered to wait four times as long forthe file to download, because we’re lazy humans.” The re-encoding process“removes bits that we would be able to hear simply in order to get the file sizelow enough.”How much of the spirit and energy of a musician’s original creation gets lostthrough contemporary listening methods, therefore, is anybody’s guess.CYMATICSThe effect that sound frequencies have on physical objects, (or apparentlyphysical,) is measured through the science of cymatics. It’s frequentlydemonstrated by spreading sand across a drum, then applying sound. The sandarranges itself into patterns which vary from harmonious to dissonant accordingto the frequencies involved. As Long Lastin’ illustrates, it serves as areminder that certain notes and tones are in synch with the beauty of nature,whereas others are clearly not.“You look at the good frequencies, and they actually produce sacred geometrypatterns that have been used since the beginning of time, since Man’s beendrawing on caves and various ancient architecture. There are the images of theFlower of Life, for instance, which come up. And when you watch the pattern, youcan actually see when a bad note hits because the shape is all distorted, andwhen a good note hits you get these beautiful sacred patterns. Especially if youlook at the Seed of Life, which is the five circles that fit together to producethe flower. Well, each circle represents a note. And when you put those notestogether you get a perfect harmony of F sharp major.”Another medium through which cymatics can be measured is water. Many researchershave posited that water has its own consciousness and memory. Either way, itmakes up the vast majority of both the earth’s surface and the human body, so ifthere are effects to be experienced according to what frequencies it’s exposedto, it really ought to be of concern to all.This area of research was the specialisation of a Japanese scientist namedMasuro Emoto. His work involved him exposing water crystals to certain words andphrases, then freezing them very quickly and analysing the results. Whilecrystals exposed to phrases such as “I love you,” “wisdom” and “compassion”arranged themselves into geometric patterns, those exposed to phrases such as “Ihate you” and “I will kill you,” appeared ugly and chaotic. Interestingly, thisoccurred when the words were both spoken and presented in written form,suggesting that the same signature energy is always there. Amusingly, thediscordant results are also said to have been experienced when water was exposedto a Heavy Metal song, though frustratingly, Emoto’s notes don’t identify whichone.Hans Utter expanded on the concept in his ‘Good Vibrations’ chat:“It makes sense if we look at the fact that our bodies are 90 per cent water.Our bodies are vibrational mediums ... the audio frequency is transformed into atype of electricity, an electrical signal which is going to your brain. Ourbrains themselves are floating in fluid. So in a sense, internally, we arefloating in this fluid and this is a medium that will vibrate. And that’s alsohow sound can not only affect our mind, but it can literally resonate with ourentire beings.“So, if we see ourselves as fishes floating around in water, well, in a sense,the atmosphere around us is like a medium for the transmission of all differentranges of frequencies – everything from cell phones – and that’s another wholerange of frequency which is similar to sound, but it’s inaudible and it’s quiteharmful. Like the 4G. You wonder why they chose to use these frequencies forcell phones!”SOUND, THE GREAT HEALERJust as sound can be weaponised, the reverse is a possibility, and here’s whereso much hope lies. Frequencies and vibrations applied with positive intent – andin the hands of an experienced practitioner – can be used for healing andspiritual upliftment. It’s said that with memory loss brought on by dementia,the melodies and lyrics of favourite songs are the last to go, and indeed,exposure to fondly-remembered music has been known to bring people out ofdeeply-entrenched comas when all else has failed. An institution whoseactivities lie in this field is the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Centre inLondon. Their application of music – as well as the human voice – has beenclaimed to get autistic children to communicate for the first time.As Jayadev Richardson, a session drummer interviewed as part of BBC Radio 2’s‘Faith in the World’ week in October 2014 noted:“Sound vibration is everything, because the whole universe – according to Vedicliterature – was created by sound. Sound is the first thing that we experiencein the mother’s womb, and it’s the last thing that shuts down when we die. So tohear the right kind of sounds is vital. And I discovered later on as Iprogressed in my spiritual life, that the sounds of the divine, of ‘God’, have apotency of their own which are separate from whatever else is out there.”Paul Robertson, a violinist and sound scholar, added:“When you’re listening to music, we as human mammals, we intrinsically entrain.That means our own innate body rhythms and responses will tend to coincide withthe rhythms and stimuli of the music itself. Even within coma, it’s beenregularly observed that if you play someone music, they will respond.”Another sound technique used for healing – and with connections right back tothe core of the human experience – is the phenomenon of binaural beats. Thesecome from the realisation that the human brain can be entrained through soundrepetition, and that consistent rhythms can have extremely powerful healing andspiritual benefits. The modern usage of the science in meditation techniques, isbased upon ritualistic drumming going back to ancient cultures. The spiritualteachers within these groups are said to have been able to induce specificbrainwave states for transcending consciousness, healing, concentration andspiritual growth.Free will choice is always present in our existence. Just as sound can be usedto control and enslave us, so it could provide a gateway to the type of positiveand uplifting experience we would all prefer to be having."},{"pageContent":"Resources:Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 107 – Hans Utter – The Science & Weaponisationof Sound: * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-107-hans-utter [https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-107-hans-utter]Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 099 – Long Lastin’ – Demonic Sonics in Hip-Hop: * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-099-long-lastin-demonic-sonics-in-hi432 Hz vs 440 Hz/ Frequencies: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5ILuyaZIO4 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5ILuyaZIO4]The importance of 432 music: * http://omega432.com/ [http://omega432.com/]Converting music to 432hz: * http://truthconduit.weebly.com/convert-music-to-432-hz.html [http://truthconduit.weebly.com/convert-music-to-432-hz.html] * https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/432-player/id633600716?mt=8 [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/432-player/id633600716?mt=8] * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO1jSeP-e-o [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KO1jSeP-e-o]Musical Cult Control: The Rockefeller Foundation’s War on Consciousness with theImposition of A=440Hz Standard Tuning: * http://noliesradio.org/archives/64255 [http://noliesradio.org/archives/64255]Why Are There 5,280 Feet in a Mile? * http://mentalfloss.com/article/25108/why-are-there-5280-feet-mile-making-sense-measurements [http://mentalfloss.com/article/25108/why-are-there-5280-feet-mile-making-sense-measurements]Ex-Illuminati druid on the occult power of music with William Schnoebelen andDavid Carrico: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0FUaHDEXhY [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0FUaHDEXhY]BBC Hi Magazine: The Devil’s music: * http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4952646.stm [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4952646.stm]Wikipedia: Music in psychological operations: * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_psychological_operations]Does pop sound louder, dumber, and more and more the same?

God damn.”Ice Cube: ‘Record Company Pimpin’ (2000)“Made in his image, are we worshipping a man or not?Uncomfortable feeling every time I hear ‘Planet Rock’, (damn,)Disappointed in the leadership and the god,Evidence is more than the images the camera shot.”Talib Kweli & Styles P Feat. Sheek Louch, Jadakiss & NIKO IS: Nine Point (2017)It will be clear to anyone who has come this far, that nefarious shenanigans canbe found behind any genre which has representation within the corporate musicindustry. My research hasn’t yet led me to the Opera scene, but it wouldn’tsurprise me that, if it had, the same symbolism and ulterior motives as in otherstyles would be waiting to be found. Each genre seems to have played its ownpart in the agenda of moral and spiritual debasement. And of all that has comeacross my radar, it is the part played by rap music, and its wider Hip-Hopculture, which has bothered me the most.I was first drawn to these scenes in my formative years, the appeal coming fromthe rebellious, (apparently) anti-establishment nature of many of the artists,and the fascination that came from the music having its own language, dress codeand ways of behaviour. This made it a culture in its own right, rather than justanother music type.Tragically, I noticed Hip-Hop – at least at the mainstream level – straying inthe wrong direction many years ago now, and it has been a painful process formany a rap fan such as myself to have witnessed its increasing descent intomoral degeneration. A once-meaningful art form which gave a creative outlet toso many, has been debased into a cultural weapon against the very groups thatelevated it in the first place.Although real-deal Hip-Hop of the type that stays worthy of the label is stillbeing made – albeit largely by original-generation producers, DJs and rappers intheir 50s or above – this is not material that stands any chance of achievingmainstream radio or TV airplay, and is rarely heard out in bars, shops or clubs.The only stuff that makes that grade is output from the hand-picked stooges ofthe corporate labels, which serves one of their culture-shaping agendas in someway or other, and slavishly peddled by the likes of veteran British DJ TimWestwood and others. If it didn’t, it wouldn’t be heard.‘Urban’ music’s role has been to push self-serving, vacuous, materialisticlifestyles, revelling in vanity and over-consumption, and reinforcing the viewthat life is short and ultimately pointless, so we may as well just party hardand buy loads of shit that will make us look good to others for the few gloryyears that we’re around. What else could matter in life, right?It seems the true story of this entire genre, lifestyle and culture may go evendeeper, however.BASE: HOW LOW CAN YOU GO?Audio producer Long Lastin’ guested on episode 99 of Good Vibrations, to discussthe systematic degradation of what is now laughingly referred to as ‘Hip-Hop,’but in reality bears no resemblance to what went before. The toxification isobvious from the lyrics, but the aspect that will interest other audiophiles isthe production methods and sonic soundscapes that are getting baked into therecordings. This is what I refer to as ‘demonic sonics.’ As Long Lastin’reflected:“From what I can hear, they’ve stripped out certain frequencies, and they’veleft you with bass and treble. They’re taking the mid out of the music ... Andit leaves you feeling quite uncomfortable ... I’ve noticed that the latest‘Hip-Hop’ that’s coming out is really, really sub-based ... It definitelyunsettles the soul, without a doubt. And the high-pitch frequency, becausethere’s no mid – it batters your ears.”During our chat, we discussed how, being of the same generation, and with thesame nostalgic memories of better days, neither of us can stand to listen tomainstream output of the type that’s now peddled by radio and TV networks, andheard in clubs throughout the land. And it goes beyond a couple of grizzled oldbastards having a moan about ‘kids today.’ Because individuals of our age have areference point for how things used to be, we can chart the degradation in a waythat a teenager, who has only ever known the type of output that’s around today,cannot. It speaks volumes, (forgive the pun,) that a generation raised on thesesonics finds them perfectly acceptable and ‘normal,’ whereas many of theirelders actually have a bad physical reaction. As Long Lastin’ recounts:“I can’t even think straight. It’s like, my brain goes into panic mode. It’slike I’m having a panic attack and I just have to, literally leave the area! Ifyou’re not awake and aware, then you’re not aware of what you’re picking up, andcertain things are switched off within yourself. So you’re not particularlynoticing these things. I can’t put my finger on it, but it’s all to do with thefeeling.“The new ‘Hip-Hop’ is synth-based, where the producers have more control of thefrequencies. And let’s face it, these people know about sonicfrequencies ... And a lot of these producers now ... they’re kind of likewitches or wizards. They work for the industry, and they’re told what sonics toput in.“And not only that, I think they’re hiding other frequencies that aren’t pickedup by the human ear so much, but may be picked up by the body ... It is kind ofre-programming the insides of us ... And all this music is on constant repeat onthe radio stations ... when you first hear it you think, ‘oh god, this isrubbish.’ And then three months later you’ve heard it on repeat twenty times aday and you start liking it.”The production styles that have been going into ‘Hip-Hop’ since around 2008, areelectronic in nature. Gone are the days of producers sampling old soul and funkrecords, and in their place is the proliferation of the dehumanising Auto-Tune,a vocal effect which makes artists sound like gibbering robots.The new breed of tuneage is aimed at a generation raised in a technological era,where digital ways of doing everything is the norm. Having their music deliveredin the form of electronic computer files full of manipulated sonics, is one moreaspect of an overall lifestyle just a few short steps away from the full SmartGrid society that the architects of the Internet of Things have been working sothoroughly towards.Any readers unfamiliar with the type of output discussed here, might like to goto YouTube and search for the following four tracks, which Long Lastin’ and Iused as examples in our chat. These will give a familiarity with what I refer toas ‘demonic sonics.’ Just thirty seconds or so will be enough; listening for anylonger becomes truly painful. And make sure the kids aren’t in earshot.Future Featuring Lil’ Wayne: ‘Karate Chop’ (Remix)DJ Khaled Featuring Jay-Z & Future: ‘I Got The Keys’Migos: ‘Versace’Kanye West Featuring Big Sean & Jay-Z: ‘Clique’ (Remix)The sound production, coupled with the nihilistic, satanic, materialistic andvacuous nature of ‘lyrics’ in the above songs – and so many more – makes for adeadly assault on the spirituality of the listener. How strange that people willactually pay to be debased in this way!The current-day degeneration of Hip-Hop is easy enough to recognise once theblinkers are off. But what if the story goes much, much deeper than just thesecontemporary tactics, and there has been far more of concern lurking beneath thesurface of this artform right from the start?THE FALL FROM GRACE OF AFRIKA BAMBAATAAIt was almost symbolic of the toxified state to which Hip-Hop had regressed,when one of the most respected figures from its inception became embroiled inmultiple allegations of sexual impropriety in early 2016. Any group, movement,religion or philosophy has its own inspirational leader, and in Hip-Hop culture,Afrika Bambaataa’s is the name that has been spoken of with great reverence forthe past four decades or more. In fact, although Keith ‘Cowboy’ Wiggins of theFurious Five is recognised as having first coined the term ‘Hip-Hop,’ it isBambaataa who claims credit for popularising the term “Hip-Hop culture,”representing the wider lifestyle that goes hand-in-hand with rap music.Certainly, I was naively chuffed to have DJed on the same bill as Bambaataa andhis cohort Jazzy Jay when they guested at The Forum in Cardiff in 1998.According to on-line profiles, Bambaataa was born Kevin Donovan in the Bronx inApril 1957, though there are claims his real name is actually Lance Taylor. Hismother and uncle are said to have been political activists. Evidently, he wasvery much in the midst of the newly-emerging Hip-Hop scene as early as 1973 – atthe age of 16 – when the genre’s originator, Kool Herc, (real name CliveCampbell,) is acknowledged as having thrown the first nascent block parties.The Bronx of the 1970s was a hotbed of criminal activity, (as portrayed in the1980 Paul Newman movie ‘Fort Apache: the Bronx,) and the young Taylor/ Donovanbecame a member of the gang known as the Black Spades. Street lore has it that,rather than engaging in criminal lifestyles themselves, the Spades were allabout recruiting young male members of the community into their ranks, to keepthem from falling in with more malevolent gangs. The Spades claim to have beenall about the self-improvement of their members, with a strong spiritual ethosrooted in the teachings of Islam, and they weren’t beyond taking forceful actionagainst members of other gangs encroaching on their territory when the situationcalled for it.According to Wikipedia’s account of Taylor/ Donovan’s time with the Spades:“He quickly rose to the position of Warlord of one of the divisions. As Warlord,it was his job to build ranks and expand the turf of the young Spades. He wasnot afraid to cross turfs to forge relationships with other gang members, andwith other gangs. As a result, the Spades became the biggest gang in the city interms of both membership and turf.”Their philosophy appears to have been one of many offshoots of the Islamic faithspecifically packaged for African-Americans. (Many researchers accuse the Nationof Islam of being an offshoot of Freemasonry for black people, in the same waythat the Boule secret society – thought to be run along similar lines to YaleUniversity’s Skull & Bones – reserves its ranks for ‘elite’ black members.) TheSpades’ ideologies, symbolism, art and garb was also rooted in Afrocentrism,encouraging adherents to study their African cultural roots.Taylor/ Donovan is said to have adopted the Bambaataa persona after winning atrip to Africa in an essay-writing contest in 1975. Here, he became inspired bya Zulu chief named Bhambatha. Also impressed by the tribal warriors portrayed inthe 1964 movie ‘Zulu,’ returning to the Bronx, he sought to incorporate elementsof these inspirations into the new gang that he had formed as an offshoot of theBlack Spades. This was known as the Bronx River Organization, later shortened tojust ‘The Organization.’ It was from this group that the Universal Zulu Nationevolved.(A question occurs to me at this juncture: how did Taylor/ Donovan, coming froman impoverished background, come to wield so much sway as to be able toestablish such a far-reaching group – which went on to influence the lives ofmany thousands of young men – when he himself was still in his teens ... if notwith some kind of assistance from outside forces?)[../images/00017.jpeg]Afrika Bambaataa (left) performs at The Forum nightclub in Cardiff, 1998.Credit: The AuthorAn essential component of gang life in the Bronx of the 1970s, seemed to haveinvolved partying as a tactic to bring community cohesion, and it was throughthis ethos that the early Hip-Hop block parties began to flourish. Here, thefour central tenets of the culture got finely honed – turntablism, B-boying (orbreakdancing,) graffiti art and MC-ing, (rapping.) The fifth element was alwaysconsidered to be Knowledge of Self, and in many ways, these components mirrorthe four classical elements of Earth, Air, Fire and Water, with the fifth beingEther, or Spirit. The key mission statement of the Zulu Nation was “peace, love,unity and having fun.”As the years progressed, Bambaataa came to be acknowledged as one of thefounding fathers of the artform, alongside Herc, Grandmaster Flash, GrandmixerDXT and Fab Five Freddy – although how much of this mythical status was createdby his own instigated hype, and some jumping on the bandwagon of a culture thathad already been created, has come into question in recent years.Among Bambaataa’s reverential nicknames have been ‘The Godfather’ and ‘The AmenRa of Hip-Hop Kulture.’ His status was cemented considerably by the release ofthe Arthur Baker-produced ‘Planet Rock’ in 1982, which – although acknowledgeduniversally as a ‘Hip-Hop classic’ – in reality isn’t in the Hip-Hop style atall, being more akin to electro-disco-funk, and heavily influenced by the musicof German synth pioneers Kraftwerk.In the video to the song, Bambaataa and his associates display the kind ofAfrocentric ceremonial garb which characterised the group’s persona. Much of thesymbolism is similar to that rocked by George Clinton in his Parliament andFunkadelic acts. (Incidentally, Clinton himself has ties to a mind-control cultin the form of the Process Church of The Final Judgement, which has countedCharles Manson, ‘Son of Sam’ killer David Berkowitz, and alleged assassin ofRobert Kennedy, Sirhan Sirhan, among its associates. In his 2014 auto-biography,Clinton wrote:“There was a group called the Process Church that had been founded by a Britishcouple as an offshoot of Scientology, and in the late sixties, they startedhanging out with the band, mainly in Boston ... We ended up excerpting some oftheir thinking in the ‘Maggot Brain’ liner notes, which seemed fine at the time– it was a form of self-actualization, not an uncommon or unpopular philosophyat the time. We did the same thing for ‘America Eats Its Young,’ but with fardifferent results.”As the years progressed, UFO and extra-terrestrial imagery crept in alongsidethe Zulu Nation’s cultural stuff – just as it had with Clinton’s imagery. TheZulu Nation organised itself as a hierarchy, rather like a religiousorganisation, its senior members describing themselves as ‘Moors’ as well asMuslims, and espousing many of the teachings of the Moorish Orthodox Church ofAmerica.The Zulu Nation grew its membership to many thousands, establishing operationsall across the US and in many other countries, all espousing the same principlesand doctrines.From an outsider’s perspective, everything about Bambaataa’s world and that ofthe Universal Zulu Nation appeared to be positive and inspiring.SECRETS AND LIESThis benevolent worldview was suddenly shattered in the Spring of 2016, when twoformer Zulu Nation members came forward with allegations that, over a prolongedperiod dating back decades, Bambaataa had sexually molested them on severaloccasions while they were still minors.The most prominent accuser was Ronald Savage, who had been known during hisNation days by the street name Bee Stinger, and had since become a musicindustry executive, author and politician. Savage claimed that his abuse datedback to 1980 when he was 15 years old, and he broke his story with aself-published memoir titled ‘Impulse Urges and Fantasies.’ In a subsequentinterview with the ‘New York Daily News,’ he said:“I want him to know how much he damaged me growing up. I was just a child. Whydid he take my innocence away? Why did he do this to me?”Immediately in the wake of Savage’s allegations, another former Nation membernamed Hassan Campbell – known by the nickname Poppy – emerged with an almostidentical story. Campbell claimed he too was sexually molested by Bambaataa fora prolonged period, and that he had come forward before Savage in the form of avideo exposé, but that Savage’s story had gained prominence over his.Campbell has since made multiple videos building on his story, and has beeninterviewed several times by radio host Troi ‘Star’ Torain on his YouTube-basedShot 97 channel. Campbell states that Bambaataa’s penchant for underage boys waswell-known within the Zulu Nation hierarchy, but that it was quietly toleratedand no action ever taken.(Hearing this put me in mind of Jimmy Savile’s historic predatory paedophiliawhen the story broke in late 2012, a year after his death. Many employees of theBBC, including household-name presenters, then commented that Savile’s habitswere an ‘open secret’ within the corporation, but employees just learned to keeptheir mouths shut for fear of losing their careers if they spoke out. Savile wasclearly protected through his connections into British military intelligence,and even the Royal Family. Does Bambaataa’s getting-away-with-it for so manyyears also hint at some kind of protection from higher up?)In an interview with the Doggie Diamonds on-line TV channel, Campbell commented:“You have to keep in mind, with Bambaataa, he comes along, a Hip-Hop pioneer inBronx River, legendary status. And he’s coming along at a time when the blackcommunity was plagued with dope and crack. That was a heavy time and a heavyera, so most of the people in the projects was strung out ... So it made it easyfor Bam to prey over the youth in the projects.”(Here’s another question: who actually decides when someone gets labelled‘legendary’ or ‘iconic’? We’re back to Edward Bernays’ ‘men we’ve never heardof’ manipulating public perceptions. We might similarly ask: who decides whogets considered a ‘genius,’ like Stephen Hawking or Albert Einstein? And whoexactly decided that Jimmy Savile and Rolf Harris were British ‘nationaltreasures?’ These are all questions we would do well to ask, I feel, whenfigures in the public eye come with these ready-made labels attached.)(And purely by matter of a curious aside, it was Donald Trump’s father, Fred,who headed up the building of many of the iconic housing projects in Brooklynand other parts of New York City, (“the projects”,) that have since becomeimmortalised in Hip-Hop legend.)Campbell continued:“See, what people don’t understand, the majority of times when a young boy getsmolested, he never comes to the forefront and tells. That is the hardest thing,to actually tell ... People sit up there and they say, ‘yo, what took you solong to come forward? ... Name one dude that ever got raped in jail that camehome and told somebody he got raped?”Campbell has spoken of how, although the sexual abuse sickened him, Bambaataawas like a father figure in the absence of his own, and a single-parentupbringing seems to have been a common factor among the young alleged victims.In the wake of Savage’s initial comments, Bambaataa issued a denial of theclaims through his lawyer, Vivian Kimi Tozaki. At the same time, Zulu Nation‘Minister of Information’ Quadeer Shakur, threatened to file a defamationlawsuit against Savage through a cease-and-desist letter.In a radio interview with Ed Lover and Monie Love, Bambaataa claimed there wasan orchestrated conspiracy against him, and denied having ever known RonaldSavage, but was called out as a liar by – among others – Lord Jamar of the groupBrand Nubian, who confirmed that Savage had been Bambaataa’s sidekick for manyyears, albeit under the name ‘Bee Stinger,’ and that this was well-known withinNew York’s Hip-Hop community.Not too much peace, love, unity and having fun any more, it would seem.THE BLASTMASTER SPEAKSA figure who has attained almost the same level of mythical status as Bambaataa,is the rapper ‘Blastmaster’ KRS One, real name Lawrence ‘Kris’ Parker. Born in1965, KRS – like Bambaataa – grew up in the Bronx, and has attained a similarreputation as a spiritual teacher, preaching Hip-Hop as something of a religion.He was a key figure in the Stop The Violence and HEAL (Human Education AgainstLies) activist movements, and established May of each year as Hip-HopAppreciation Month, (with Bambaataa and the Nation marking each November asHip-Hop History Month.) Appearing on N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN’s ‘Drink Champs’podcast, KRS was asked to comment on the Bambaataa situation. He stated:“For me, if you keep it Hip-Hop, nothing can be taken away from AfrikaBambaataa. Nothing. Just keep it Hip-Hop. But if you want to dig into dude’spersonal life and accusations that’s being made and so on ... personally – mepersonally – I don’t give a fuck. Personally.“Look, if somebody was harmed or whatever, y’all gotta deal with that shit. Dealwith it. That don’t stop Hip-Hop. That don’t stop what you did for Hip-Hop. Itdon’t take away none of it. History is history. But deal with that. That’spersonal.”He also stated that: “anyone who has a problem with Afrika Bambaataa should quitHip-Hop,” and insisted that any leadership within Hip-Hop culture has to be“untouchable.”KRS’s comments were interpreted by many as him turning a blind eye to themolestation claims. In the wake of the ensuing controversy, he issued astatement on his website, in which he claimed his words had been taken out ofcontext:“I am indeed concerned about the accusations made against Afrika Bambaataa, butI will not become entangled in a controversy that seems to be less aboutjustice, and more about self-promotion and revenge ... I said then as I amsaying right now, it is not that I don’t care at all about the accusations madeagainst Afrika Bambaataa. I am saddened at the whole controversy and how it isbeing handled. It is not that I don’t care, it is more the fact that I don’tgossip. I don’t take sides in real disputes that don’t concern me.”Some months later, KRS raised much interest in the video to a Q&A session, wherehe was asked if he was a Freemason. He replied by saying he wasn’t, but that hehad studied the teachings of Freemasonry for almost 20 years, had knownFreemasons all his life, and that he was considered to be a 33rd Degree MasterMason by those within the ranks, who trusted him with “their secrets, symbolsand knowledge.” He added that you might consider him “an honorary member,because I understand the truth.”I found this confusing as, from my understanding of how Freemasonry works,(admittedly limited as I’ve never been a Mason myself,) it relies upon oaths ofsecrecy undertaken by members – particularly those in the upper ranks – whichare not to be shared with anyone outside of the fraternity. This is the wholepoint of all ‘secret’ societies.KRS established the Temple of Hip-Hop as a conceptual theme, and has beentrading as a ‘teacher’ of its wisdoms and doctrines for many years. Theseinclude ‘The Gospel of Hip-Hop,’ a book he says he pretty much “channelled” from1994 to its publication in 2009.Placed within the framework of the cult-like Zulu Nation, KRS’s ‘Temple’certainly bears all the hallmarks of a secret-society fraternity ... or a cult?Bambaataa and KRS have both made anti-Illuminati/ New World Order statementsover the years, in interviews and on track; KRS’s ‘It’s All Insane To Me,’ andBambaataa’s ‘Warlocks and Witches, Computer Chips, Microchips and You,’ stand asgood examples of these. On the surface, then, the pair appear to be indicatingtheir disapproval for elite secret societies and their stranglehold on humanity.There is, however, what I call the duplicitous Disarmament Tactic at play in somany situations, and readers who may have missed what this is all about areencouraged to read the section on it back in Chapter 3.KRS’s apparent defence of Bambaataa, seemed to re-ignite the decades-oldanimosity between him and veteran rapper MC Shan, as portrayed on the classic1980s ‘beef’ tracks ‘South Bronx, ‘The Bridge’ and ‘The Bridge Is Over.’Commenting in a 2016 interview, Shan suggested KRS’s comments indicated that hehad secrets of his own to hide when he said:“ ... When I used to see Bam, he used to embrace me like, ‘Shan, Shan Shan.’ Butyou can’t even talk to me right now. You can’t say nothing to me. I don’t carewhat you did for Hip-Hop. None of that. And I keep saying, KRS One, you gotsomething to hide, my nigga! Because for you to keep standing up for somebodythat did what they did, and you still standing up for this man ... you gotsomething to hide and you don’t want it to come out!”A vexed Hassan Campbell/ Poppy said in one of his subsequent interviews, thatthe only reasonable action for KRS One to take following his apparent defence ofBambaataa, would be to kill himself, as he questioned what kind of father wouldstand as an apologist for paedophilic behaviour against young boys:“What I have to say to KRS One is like this: everything I thought he was as aperson, he’s the total opposite. But I’m realising it’s about the musicindustry, period, it’s not just him. The fact that everybody in the musicindustry is so quiet about this topic is crazy to me.“Here it is – you’ve got the Hip-Hop pioneer, and everybody’s so quiet ... Forme to go through all the pain I’ve been through, and then for KRS One to be soinconsiderate. Do you know what it’s like being molested? ... I’ve never seen afather be so insensitive towards someone that had been molested.”KRS’s lyrics on the Boogie Down Productions track ’13 N Good’ certainly don’tpaint him in a very favourable light in this regard. In it, he conveysunwittingly having sex with a 13-year-old girl, but enjoying the experiencenevertheless:“We jumped in the ride, rushed to the crib,I ain’t gotta explain what we did.Built to last, I simply waxed that.Asked the question, no need for guessin,’Hey baby, how old are you?Twenty-six, twenty-one, maybe twenty-two?I’m twenty five, she shucked and kinda neighed,And said, “hee, hee, hee, I’m only thirteen.”Thirteen!? I need a quick escape.That’s statutory rape! ... But she was good!”THE PLOT THICKENSBy the end of 2016, Ronald Savage had posted the recording of a phone call toYouTube, in which he says two senior members of the Universal Zulu Nationoffered him money to retract his statements about Bambaataa. A voice is heard atthe start of the conversation asking him to “name your price,” and latersuggesting a sum of $50,000. Savage repeatedly insisted that he was notinterested in money, and that he had only come forward with his allegations inorder for the truth to be known, and to provide support for other victims ofsexual molestation.Savage has said he wants to change a bizarre piece of legislation in New York’sstatute of limitations, which bars child sex abuse victims from pursuingcriminal charges or civil penalties after their 23rd birthday. Both he andCampbell have stated that they felt too afraid and intimidated by the ZuluNation – of which they remained members for many years – to speak out earlier.By the time they had each decided to seek some recourse, their 23rd birthdayshad long since passed. Both Savage and Campbell spoke of how their abusiveexperiences have affected their sex lives with their female partners. Savage hasspoken of how he has contemplated and attempted suicide.The Universal Zulu Nation has since publicly apologised to Savage and others.The group’s statement included the line:“To the survivors of apparent sexual molestation by Bambaataa, both those whohave come forward and others who may have not, we are sorry for what youendured, and extend our thanks to those who have spoken out for your bravery.”Shortly afterwards, Bambaataa seemed to have gone on the run, his exactwhereabouts unknown. No official police action had been taken against him by thetime of this book’s completion, despite the highly public nature of the claimsmade against him.By May 2016, another voice had been added to the accusations in the form of anex-Black Spade, Shamsideen Shariyf Ali Bey, known as ‘Lord Shariyf.’ He appearedon Star’s radio show to back up Savage’s and Campbell’s accusations, anddescribed himself as having been Bambaataa’s bodyguard.Shariyf confirmed that Bambaataa’s alleged sexual encounters with underage boyswere a “well-known fact in the Zulu Nation,” adding that he had interacted insome way with hundreds of boys since the 1970s. Shariyf stated that visitors toBambaataa’s apartment would often find him in compromising positions with youngboys, and he would be accompanied by pre-teen males in his hotel room when awayon tour. He seemed to make few attempts to hide his behaviour. On one occasion,he is said to have been stabbed by one of his potential victims in self-defence,causing him to seek emergency hospital treatment.In his Star interview, Shariyf stated:“I can say I’ve walked in on stuff where I say, ‘what the fuck is goingon?’ ... There’s always a boy in his house. When he leaves and gets home,there’s always a boy there. I’ve seen them camped, asking him for money. Hetravels with late-teens. Those are the ones he takes overseas with him. When Iwent with him on tour in the States, I would stay in one room and he would haveboys in the room with him.”While relating the story of his seeking to convene a council of Zulu Nationelders, Shariyf stated that he first consulted “my Moorish brother Hakim Bey.”Some confusion arises here, as Hakim Bey is the pseudonym of an individual namedPeter Lamborn Wilson, described as an anarchist author and spiritual leader, butwho also has some disturbing links to paedophilia. Before going any further, itbears clarifying that Shariyf appears to have been referencing a differentindividual who goes by the name of Hakim Bey, and who can be seen in this video– https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=yWHoutJs5Qc[https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=yWHoutJs5Qc]Hakim Bey seems to be an unfortunate moniker for this younger individual giventhat he shares it with Wilson, and it’s puzzling as to why he would have chosenit, given that Wilson’s links to paedophilia have been known about for manyyears. Wilson also has connections with Moorish/ Islamic teachings, and it’sworth looking a little further into his background at this point.Coming out of Columbia University, Wilson was a founder member of the MoorishOrthodox Church. Early on, this organisation forged a link with the League forSpiritual Discovery, (LSD – nice touch,) the group established by Dr. TimothyLeary, which Wilson is said to have visited for supplies of psychedelic drugs.Wilson is also credited with having invented Temporary Autonomous Zones, a formof cult-like communal living spaces. In an interview on TAZs, he stated:“The real genesis was my connection to the communal movement in America, myexperiences in the 1960s in places like Timothy Leary’s commune in Millbrook.”(Millbrook Mansion was a house in New York State gifted to Leary by the wealthyHitchcock-Mellon banking family, from which he conducted many of his experimentsinto the effects of LSD, dosing the guests who would come and stay at the house.Many were prominent figures from academia and entertainment. Beat poet AllenGinsberg was one such guest.)Wilson’s Moorish Orthodox Church subscribes to various doctrines from the Sufitradition of Islam, one of which is the advocacy of pederasty. According to thetradition’s writings, this concerns itself with men gazing lovingly upon thebeauty of young boys, rather than any sexual activity taking place. Wilson,however, also turns out to have been a writer and something of a spokespersonfor NAMBLA, the North American Man-Boy Love Association that we encountered inan earlier chapter, by way of fellow member Allen Ginsberg. NAMBLA advocates forgrown men to be able to have sexual relations with pre-teen boys withoutpenalty, and campaigns for the release of men who have been jailed for sexualoffences against male minors.Wilson/ Hakim Bey’s’ Wikipedia entry notes that:“Some writers have been troubled by Bey’s endorsement of children’s sexuality,and its ability to be expressed without the restriction of age.“In his book ‘William S. Burroughs vs. The Qur’an,’ Michael Muhammad Knightdescribes his experiences with Peter Lamborn Wilson. Knight befriends Wilson,and is invited to stay at his house; he begins writing a biography of Wilson, onwhich he hopes Wilson might bestow the label “official.”“However, as he learns more about Wilson/ Bey’s writings on pederasty, his viewof Wilson sours, and with that their friendship. Knight says: “Writing forNAMBLA amounts to activism in real life. As Hakim Bey, Peter creates a childmolester’s liberation theology, and then publishes it for an audience ofpotential offenders.”If Lord Shariyf really had gone to this particular Hakim Bey for guidance on howto deal with Bambaataa’s alleged pederasty, it would be a bit like wanting tobecome a vegan and going to a butcher for advice.BODY COUNTA further voice to have weighed in with yet more accusations against Bambaataa,was the Universal Zulu Nation’s former Minister of Information known asGrandmaster TC Izlam. Shortly after making his comments in an interview his bodywas discovered on a sidewalk in Atlanta, Georgia, on 8th June 2017. He had beenshot, with almost no coverage of the incident given in the media.In fact, the entire Bambaataa episode has been noticeably lacking frommainstream media coverage. If it were, let’s say, Rod Stewart or Mick Jagger whowas embroiled in such accusations, does anyone think we’d be hearing as littleabout it? You might think that radio/ TV stations and magazines that pridethemselves on supposedly being at the forefront of Hip-Hop and urban culture,would find a story about one of the pioneering historical figures beingembroiled in a sordid sex scandal to be worthy of coverage and investigation.But there has been a blanket veil of silence over the whole affair both in theUS and the UK. It seems as if the Bambaataa accusations have, in some way,struck at the very core of Hip-Hop culture’s supposed spirituality –particularly among participants of a certain age – and to engage in meaningfulconversation about it is considered too painful a prospect. Denial and avoidancehave taken over as the default responses.TC Izlam had given interviews to Chicago journalist Leila Wills, as part of herupcoming documentary into the hidden secrets of Bambaataa and the Zulu Nation,titled ‘TRAPped in a CULTure.’ In one, he recounts his first discoveringBambaataa’s paedophilia, and the difficulty that would have been involved in histrying to raise further awareness of the problem, given the closed ranks of theZulu Nation leadership:“ ... We started internal-affairing the Zulu Nation 15 years ago, and the firstone we internal-affaired was Afrika Bambaataa. ‘Cause, see, If I would have cameout in the 90s saying I had suspicions that Bambaataa is fucking with littleboys over the Nation, I would have been dead!”As Leila Wills recounted in an on-line article for the ‘Metropolis’ newspaper:“During our interview, TC stated to me that he was in Atlanta because he hadbeen in hiding and on the run for the past year, after resigning asInternational Spokesman for the Universal Zulu Nation. TC said he had receivednumerous death threats via phone calls from what he described as ‘Bambaataa’sfan club.’ He said the threats accused him of disloyalty to ‘the Father,’ andthat he would ‘end up in a box.”On 12th June 2017, Atlanta police announced that they had taken into custody asuspect in TC Izlam’s murder, a Trelle Deshawn Hough. The murder charge againstHough was later dropped, though he was kept in custody. A second suspect, TaleebPaige, was arrested on 30th June, and charged with murder and other offences.Updates on Leila Wills’ ‘TRAPped in a CULTure’ documentary, scheduled forrelease in 2018, can be obtained from the film’s Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/tRAPped.in.a.CULTure/[https://www.facebook.com/tRAPped.in.a.CULTure/]DOWN WITH THE CLIQUE?The above revelations about goings-on within the Zulu Nation, have to beg thequestion of any truly open-minded researcher, as to whether the organisation wasin fact run as some kind of mind-control cult. The question was raised in anexcellent article entitled ‘Afrika Bambaataa: Inside the Mind of a Cult Leader’by Leila Wills, which is linked to at the end of the chapter. All the warningsigns seem to have been present; cult members are kept largely shut-off from thehappenings of the outside world; they are encouraged only to fraternise withintheir own circle; different members of the same family are brought into thegroup, as was the case with the Nation, (Hassan Campbell has accused Bambaataaof having sex with his own male cousin); there is an organisational hierarchywith appointed leaders who operate without scrutiny, and according to oaths ofsecrecy. The other element so often present within cult organisations isinstitutionalised sexual abuse.By October 2017, Star expressed the view that the Zulu Nation was effectivelyfinished.There’s been division within the ranks of the other pioneers, too; in 2015, theFurious Five’s Scorpio denounced Grandmaster Flash, (real name Joseph Sadler,)as “Hip-Hop’s Milli Vanilli,” complaining of how he took credit for theirgroundbreaking single ‘The Message’ and scored an international career off it,despite not actually appearing on the recording. By 2016, Kool Herc had joinedin by accusing Flash of altering history, and describing ‘The Get Down’, theNetflix series on which Flash had collaborated with director Baz Luhrmann, as“the let down,”) and Flash had responded in an open letter, maintaining that hewas the originator of several Hip-Hop DJing techniques, rather than Herc.In September 2017, Flash recorded an interview with AllHipHop TV, (link at theend,) in which he lamented all the fall-outs and addressed his earlier commentto Kool Herc of “there’s only two of us left,” where he had spoken as ifBambaataa were dead. Interestingly, Flash states in the interview that he neverreally did know Bambaataa’s real name.HOW DEEP IS DEEP?We can now see that what at first appeared to be a personal dispute betweenthree individuals, goes far, far deeper than this type of simplistic affair. The(third?) eye-opening accusations against Bambaataa – and the implications forthe Zulu Nation – have caused some researchers to delve deeper into how farthese cult/ secret-society-type arrangements may go within the genre. If RonaldSavage and Hassan Campbell had never blown the whistle, these connections mayhave gone undiscovered for who knows how much longer?The adopted monikers of pioneers such as Grandmaster Flash, Grand WizardTheodore and ‘the Grand Wizard’ Slick Rick, (who frequently wore a patchcovering one of his eyes,) have Masonic/ secret-society overtones. Even theindividual perennially cited as being Hip-Hop’s founder, DJ Kool Herc, was anearly adoptee of the teachings of the Nation of Islam/ Gods and Earths. Was thismerely artists being creative with their adopted personas ... or were we beinggiven subtle hints as to the fraternal nature of this artform all along?WILD PRODIGYIn the midst of the Bambaataa scandal, Hip-Hop fans were saddened to hear of thedeath of one of the most respected rappers on the underground scene. AlbertJohnson – better known as Prodigy, one half of the crew Mobb Deep – passed away12 days after TC Izlam.Prodigy, (not to be confused with the British rave group of the same name,) camefrom a musical family; his grandfather and grand-uncle had been jazz musicians,his father was a member of a doo-wop group, and his mother had been a member of60s band The Cristals.Prodigy formed Mobb Deep alongside Havoc, who he had met while attendingManhattan’s High School of Art & Design. They achieved breakthrough success withtheir track ‘The Shook Ones’ in 1994, which has since become a staple classic ofthe genre. Still a teenager at the time of its recording, Prodigy states on thetrack: ‘I’m only 19 but my mind is older.’ The group’s trademark was always itsgritty, graphic and unrepentant tales of street life, crime and violence.As early as 1995, however, Prodigy had entered music lore by becoming the firstrapper known to have namechecked ‘the Illuminati’ on record, uttering the line,“Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body. Secret society trying to keep theireye on me” in his guest verse on the remix of LL Cool J’s ‘I Shot Ya.’Further comments indicated that Prodigy had discovered how the corporate Hip-Hopgame is ultimately controlled by secret-society groups steeped in symbolism andritual activity, and that he was expressing his disapproval of the situation. Hecommented that he had read the book ‘Leviathan 666: The Beast as the Antichrist’by Dr. Malachi Z. York, which had moved him to tears and gave him his “moment ofclarity.”Dr. York, (whose real name is Dwight York, and who goes by a number of otheraliases,) would appear to have had inside working knowledge of how powerful,controlling groups operate. Besides being a writer, he was the founder of anumber of religious/ political sects, the best known of which is his NuwaubianNation. This group appears to have been run along mind-control cult lines, withritual sex practices commonplace, and with York granting himself sexual rightsto most of the women in the movement – including the wives and daughters of malemembers. York is currently serving a 135-year jail sentence. He was charged in2002 with more than 100 counts of sexually molesting dozens of children, some asyoung as four years old.Like the Zulu Nation, the Nuwaubian Nation’s early spiritual doctrines had theirbasis in Islamic/ Moorish teachings, and were geared towards black membership.Later, York incorporated aspects of Judaism, Christianity, Kemetism and UFOreligion, and changed the group’s name to the United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors.Further reading occurred during Prodigy’s three-year period of incarceration ongun charges, and further lyrical hints at his new-found knowledge crept into hislyrics. He was outspoken in his accusations towards other prominent rappers forhaving sold their souls for fame and fortune, with Jay-Z as his most prominenttarget. In 2008, Prodigy penned a five-page open letter from jail, in which heaccused Jay-Z of being a Freemason, of being a traitor to his fellow blackbrothers and sisters, and of promoting “the lifestyle of The Beast.” Prodigystated:“I have so much fire in my heart, that I will relentlessly attack Jay-Z, theIlluminati and any and every other evil that exists until my lights are putout.”Prodigy died on 20th June 2017 in a Las Vegas hospital, aged 42. He had beentaken there a few days previous after falling ill while performing on the Art ofRap Tour. A bizarre story began circulating, (which, in retrospect, sounds morelike a form of morbid mockery,) that Prodigy had choked to death while eating anegg in his hospital bed. The real cause of death was cited as complicationsarising from the sickle cell anaemia which Prodigy had battled all his life.Certainly, his condition was a well-known fact within the Hip-Hop world; Tupachad famously taunted Prodigy about it on his vicious diss track ‘Hit ‘Em Up,’and Prodigy himself had attributed the nihilistic nature of his lyrics to thepermanent physical suffering associated with the condition.While most seemed content to accept Prodigy’s passing as an inevitableconsequence of his poor health, more suspicious observers found it relevant thathe had been so outspoken about the nature of who really controls the industry,as it certainly wasn’t the first time that such a straight-talking individualhad met their demise at a relatively young age. There’s also the curiosity thatProdigy’s death just happened to occur the day after 2017’s World Sickle CellAwareness Day, and one day before the Summer Solstice.Comments that Prodigy made in one of his final interviews sound like asumming-up of the themes in this book, and clearly, these are not the types ofviews that the entertainment industry takes kindly to its assets openlyexpressing:“You got this power that people call God. There’s many names for it – Allah,God, the Creator, the Most High. But the power exists. Some people don’t like toadmit that power exists, or they just don’t believe it – they’re atheists. Butme personally, I know there’s a higher power and that power is real. That poweris one force ... And we are given free will to do what we want with that power.You can use that power for good, but then, you can use that power for eviltoo ... “That’s what these people are playing with. They’re playing with that energythat exists out here that we all have access to. Those people in those positionsof power, control and manipulate situations to their favour for their ownagenda ... Mostly their agenda is population control, mind control. You’re beingmanipulated ... “You learn that they infiltrate groups, and keep positions within those groups,so they can control the decision-making to move things towards their agenda, tocontrol the mass population opinion, and to control the world.”Shortly after the announcement of his death, came the news that Prodigy wasplanning his next project to be a musical about the Illuminati.ENTER THE CLANWhere the fingerprints of banksters, secret societies, religious doctrines andcults have already presented themselves, it’s never too much of a surprise tofind traces of mind-control and organised crime lurking in the same vicinity.Disturbingly, these elements crop up in the back story of one of the mostinfluential and iconic rap collectives of the 1990s onwards.The Wu Tang Clan was a collective of rappers that emerged out of the StatenIsland borough of New York City under the mentorship of Robert Diggs, known asthe RZA, (standing for ‘Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah.’) Diggs acted as the crew’s defacto leader. Its members were known for the metaphysical nature of theircomplex lyricism, coupled with RZA’s distinctive production style.The Clan came with their own logo, a large ‘W’ usually rendered inblack-and-white, and their imagery was heavily associated with martial arts, ofwhich RZA was an obsessive fan; in 2004, he produced the musical score forQuentin Tarantino’s ‘Kill Bill’ movies. The violence and organised crimedepicted in many of the Wu Tang’s stark lyrics, it turns out, may have more of abasis in reality than many fans realise.Documentation from the FBI relating to Wu Tang Clan extra-curricular activity,was obtained under a Freedom of Information Request in 2011, and has been madepublic on the internet. One paper, dated 08/04/99, with certain sectionsredacted, states:“Information was received from the New York Police Department ... about criminalactivity being conducted by members of the Wu Tang Clan organization on StatenIsland, NY. The detectives have documented that the WTC is heavily involved inthe sale of drugs, illegal guns, weapons possession, murder, car-jackings andother types of violent crime.”It goes on to address the murder of Robert Johnson, aka Pooh, on Staten Islandin December 1997, claiming that this was ordered by somebody within the Wu TangClan. It further states:“Once individuals have proved themselves to be loyal members or associates ofthe WTC ... they are offered record contracts to record rap-type music.”Infuriatingly, the section of the document which details where the Clan’sfunding came from, has been obscured.The police and the FBI reportedly suspected that the murder of two drug dealerswas ordered by RZA, with the complicity of WTC rapper Corey Woods, known asRaekwon. RZA had been acquitted of an attempted murder charge in Ohio some yearsbefore. A further Staten Island drug lord was later convicted of the New Yorkmurders.Despite these serious accusations and investigations, law enforcement wasevidently unable (or unwilling) to make anything stick with Wu Tang, and so thegroup was able to continue operating in the entertainment and merchandisingindustries, and does so to this day.MEET THE FAMILYOne of the most prominent rappers in the Clan is Clifford Smith, better known asMethod Man. His name cropped up in a radio interview I did with privateinvestigator and broadcaster Ed Opperman, when Ed revealed that Meth once cameto his telecoms stall in a Staten Island mall early in his career, and that theonly ID he could produce was an identification card from having been a patientat South Beach Psychiatric Center. It puts a different twist on the term ‘cell’phone.[../images/00018.jpeg]RZA, frontman of the enigmatic Wu Tang Clan collectiveCredit: The AuthorThis is an interesting revelation when Method Man is considered alongside fellowClan member Russell Jones, better known by his artist name of Ol’ Dirty Bastard,and a cousin of RZA. Jones’ trademark was always his erratic, haphazard vocalstyle – traits associated with mental instability – and indeed, he spent time ina mental institution, prison and ‘rehab’ facilities, following a 1999 arrest fordrug possession. Dirty spoke in interviews and on record of how he believedhimself to be under surveillance from government agencies, with the line, “FBI,don’t you be watching me” appearing in his track ‘Got Your Money.’ Following ahistory of arrests and brushes with law enforcement – and having been shot androbbed twice – Jones was discovered dead in a New York recording studio two daysbefore his 36th birthday, of what is said to have been an “accidental drugsoverdose.” He had been complaining of chest pains earlier in the day.RZA himself is said to be a member of the Almighty Vice Lord Nation organisedcrime gang, and rumoured to be a 33rd-degree Freemason. In 1970, two of the AVLNleaders achieved a grant from those nice people at the Rockefeller Foundation.The group’s activities have included murder, robbery, theft, assaults,intimidation, extortion and fraud. It later incorporated Islamic teachings intoits doctrines, (haven’t we come across that one somewhere before?) Among thesigns and emblems said to be adopted by members to indicate their ties to thegroup, are a hat cocked to the left side, a glove, a top hat, a cane and aMartini glass. Many of these appear in the promotional photos of prominent rapartists.RZA is also a stated Five Per Center, a faction alternatively known as theNations of Gods and Earth, and a spin-off of the Nation of Islam. He is far fromalone, as a dizzying amount of other prominent rappers are – or have been – FivePer Centers, including Jay-Z, Nas, Busta Rhymes, Erykah Badu, LL Cool J, BigDaddy Kane, Brand Nubian, Planet Asia, A Tribe Called Quest, X Clan, PoorRighteous Teachers, the now-deceased Guru and Big Pun, and Jay Electronica. (Thelatter’s unlikely relationship with heiress Kate Rothschild was detailed in thelast book. After the pair split, Kate went on to date another rapper, London’sStephen Manderson, known as Professor Green. The shared experience of theirfathers having reportedly committed suicide, is said to have provided a bond.Kate’s father, Amschel Rothschild, was discovered hanged at a Paris hotel in1996.)An entire book has been written on the faction’s massive influence on theHip-Hop movement in the form of ‘Five Percenter Rap: God Hop’s Music, Messageand Black Muslim Mission,’ by Professor Felicia M. Miyakawa.In the late 1980s, the Hip-Hop scene spawned a movement known as the NativeTongues, an affiliation of many of the prominent acts of the time, whose outputwas considered to be thought-provoking and meaningful. Among these were De LaSoul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers, Black Sheep, Queen Latifah andMonie Love. The Native Tongues movement was also heavy on Nation of Islamideology, as well as embracing Afrocentrism, as George Clinton’s Parliament/Funkadelic and Bambaataa’s Zulu Nation had before them. The Zulu Nation receivedrespectful shout-outs on many a Native Tongues track, and Londoner Monie Love –who relocated to New York early in her career to become a radio host – recordedher 1989 track ‘Grandpa’s Party’ in homage to Bambaataa and the Nation.(On the subject of De La Soul – and just as another of our curious asides – thethree members all adopted bizarre pseudonyms. Alongside Vincent Lamont Mason Jr.becoming P.A. Pasemaster Mase, and Kelvin Mercer becoming Posdnous, (‘soundsop’backwards,) we had David Jude Jolicouer becoming Trugoy the Dove. His story wasthat the name was simply ‘yogurt’ spelled backwards as he just happened to likeyogurt. But broken down, his name becomes ‘true goy.’ “Goy” is a derogatory termused by Talmudic Jews to disparage those outside of their group. Does this namerepresent a form of cynical mockery? Or am I really just reaching a little bittoo far with this one? I’ll leave readers to decide.)A TALL ISRAELI ENTERSAs previously noted, the number of executives in the entertainment industry whoidentify themselves as ‘Jewish,’ is out of all proportion to their number in thegeneral population. When it comes to top-level control of the US Hip-Hopindustry, there have been few individuals to have exerted as much control overthe direction the genre has taken as Lyor Cohen.Born in 1959 to Israeli immigrants in New York, Cohen’s career began in LosAngeles in 1984. After promoting live shows, he collaborated with RussellSimmons on the creation of their Rush Productions outfit, (later Rush AssociatedLabels,) and as a road manager for Run-DMC. Cohen’s artist roster includedKurtis Blow, Whodini, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys, and hesigned the likes of Slick Rick, EPMD, Eric B & Rakim, De La Soul and A TribeCalled Quest to Rush – all major heavyweights. Cohen went on to work as anexecutive at Def Jam, the outfit reportedly founded by Rick Rubin in his NewYork college dormitory, and arguably the most profitable and high-profile raprecord label of them all.Cohen became president of Def Jam/ RAL in 1988, at which point Rubin quit thecompany. His many years at the helm saw him oversee Def Jam’s departure from itsparent company Sony, and its merger with fellow corporate giants PolyGram,Universal and Island, before moving across to the Warner group. More recently,he founded his own independent label, 300, bringing through present-day namessuch as Young Thug, Fetty Wap and Migos in the process.The list of artists over whom Cohen has had corporate control – includingnegotiating endorsement deals outside of their music output – reads like awho’s-who of A-listers, spanning the likes of Jay-Z, Kanye West, Method Man,Redman, Ja Rule, Ludacris, Foxy Brown and so many others. By late 2016, Cohenhad taken up a position with Google’s YouTube brand as Global (their wording)Head of Music.Cohen has been the target of harsh words from Damon Dash, who was Jay-Z’soriginal business partner in Roc-A-Fella (nice name) Records, and himself ahigh-flying executive until his label was acquired by Def Jam in 2004, which sawJay-Z being appointed as its president, and Dash being effectively ousted. In a2014 video interview, Dash criticised “the puppet master” for his financialexploitation of black culture:“My beef was with Lyor because I think he’s a fake CEO, and I think he’sfrontin’ on my culture ... I’m calling him out publicly, and I want him to stoptrying to rape my culture. Go make some money with some other people ... “ ... It’s the perfect example of what they always do to us. They try to offersome paper bag of money, or whatever it is, whatever selfish agenda which is thetest, and then have us divide, so they can benefit and take the fight off ofthem.”(Dash was dating the singer Aaliyah at the time she died in a plane crash in2001 at the age of 22, and had stated that they had planned to marry. Morerecently, he has linked with entrepreneur Dez White, with whom he is said tohave been developing a new fingerprint payment technology – part of the incomingcashless Transhumanist society.)For his part, in an interview on Hanukkah Radio, in which the host speaks of “acelebration of Judaism in Hip-Hop,” Cohen admitted that Jewish executives havealways controlled black entertainment:“Jewish people have always been involved in urban cultural arts, all the wayback to the early beginnings of Jazz music. It’s just something that’s alwayshappened.”Cohen was the subject of a video from the Vigilant Citizen site entitled, ‘TheTall Israeli That Runs the Rap Industry.’ It included two Twitter posts fromPublic Enemy frontman Chuck D, which stated:“The music industry is NOT a game, it’s a business enveloping a craft ... ”And, in obvious reference to record executives Clive Davis, Jimmy Iovine, LyorCohen and LA Reid:“These Clives, Jimmys, Lyors, LAs, etc, look at black people as less than, anddon’t consider themselves family ... ”VC ends the video with a clip from Ice Cube’s song ‘Record Company Pimpin,’ inwhich Cube delivers a scathing commentary on the corporate exploitation ofartists. VC observes, however, that the cover for the album on which the trackis included, somewhat ironically features Ice Cube rendering the tired oldone-eye pose. It’s not the first, nor the last time that an artist has appearedto be making an incisive, independent statement, but where other aspects oftheir persona appear to be puzzlingly at odds with such a stance.Interestingly, when rapper N.O.R.E. once described Cohen as “the most importantman in the whole music game,” and “a mogul,” he responded by stating he’s notcomfortable with the term and prefers to think of himself as “a humble servant.”Cohen has been pictured flashing up the ‘666’ and ‘Baphomet’ hand signs, whichcasts interesting light on his ‘servant’ credentials.Tellingly, the first sentence of a mainstream article on complex.com aboutCohen, states:“If there were a shadowy Illuminati controlling the world of rap, Lyor Cohenwould be its all-seeing eye, the man behind the scenes, pulling the strings ofthe most powerful players and reaping the benefits.”In his formative years, Cohen worked at the Beverly Hills office of Bank Leumi.This turns out to be an influential Zionist institution that was trying toestablish a Jewish state in Palestine decades before World War 2.In its incisive article titled ‘The Tall Israeli Who Runs Hip Hop: AnInvestigation into Engineered Culture and Bankers,’ the mindunleashed.comwebsite observes:“When investigating the money trail of social engineers – people who influencesocial trends, often to the detriment of society and toward the empowerment ofthe powers-that-be – the road always seems to lead back to bankers. In fact,bankers are often some of the highest-level power players, higher thangovernment and corporate power.“It is inherently in the interest of power to engineer society, and to steerpeople’s culture in a direction that benefits their system. The financial systemis obviously propped up by instilling a culture in people that worships money.”PREACHThe corruption of the rap industry at the hands of outside influences, wasaddressed on a radio interview with DJ Sway on Shade 45 Radio in October 2015,by Louis Farrakhan, long-standing minister of the Nation of Islam. (It’s onlyright to mention that Farrakhan’s own reputation is blighted by constant claimsthat he was instrumental in the murder of Malcolm X in 1965. Indeed, Farrakhanhimself has all but admitted to his involvement. But if I’d stuck strictly toindividuals whose good names are blemish-free and absent of any nefariousconnections, this would be a very short book!)Farrakhan told Shade 45:“Our rap artists are more powerful than any preacher. One rap song can turn morepeople’s minds than 100 sermons of some of the great, great preachers. That’sthe influence that our young people have, and it’s not limited to America, it’sall over the world.“So here’s what we have to decide. Do I want to be an agent of the wicked plansof the enemy to be a destructive force against my own people? Do I want to bethe producer of raps that only engage in the most filthy and wicked display ofvulgarity to our people? Do I want to do that? Do I want to promote on my radioshow the most vile songs that pit one brother against another? Do I want to bean agent of that just because there’s a few dollars?“I think we need to unite, and we ought to go to the record producers and arguefor the sanity of our people, and make them responsible for the deaths that comeas a result of what they cause us to do ... See, once you become an agent of ourdestruction, then if we’re united, let’s put pressure on our record labels,because our people have more talent than they’re showing.“Let them rise to the heights that they wish to rise to, and we should be thevanguard to that kind of approach to all record executives, and charge them withthe death of our people that they are promoting. Let’s see how they respond tothat ... When people know that their lives are in the balance by destroying ourlives, then maybe we’ll see some change.”THE HOMOSEXUALISATION OF HIP-HOPA final, more recent agenda that has been systematically unfolded withinHip-Hop, warrants some exposure. It’s another elephant in the room – a factorthat few seem comfortable talking about due to the politically-correct mindsetthat has been fomented by the social engineers, and it involves another groupwho have been rendered beyond scrutiny in society.By way of another caveat – just to be clear – this is not any kind ofjudgemental attack on people who happen to be gay. A person’s sexual orientationand lifestyle choices are their own business, and so long as it doesn’t causeharm to others or take away anyone’s rights, there’s no problem. This shouldn’teven need pointing out taken within the overall theme of this book, but there itis for the record.We’re not talking about individual, personal cases here, though, but about atrend that can be seen to have been calculated by how quickly it has taken root,how all-pervasive it has become, and by how many boxes it ticks in the long-termplans of agencies such as Tavistock, the Frankfurt School and SRI.The glorification of homosexual and LGBT lifestyles, is a tactic in the eugenicsand population-reduction plans of these groups. It serves to further break upthe traditional family unit, by destroying the stability that dynamic has, andto stir up discord between different groups within society. And a societyfractured by perceived differences is far easier to covertly manipulate, thanone in which people stand together against any form of invasive tyranny.Additionally, the frequent flaunting of Transgenderism in the media, tiesdirectly into the satanic mindset of society’s occult controllers, which is allabout taking what’s natural in Creation, (discernible male and femaleprinciples,) and inverting and merging them into something completely different.Rapper Wacka Flocka Flame indicated that he had caught on to the agenda, when hecommented in a 2017 interview:“They don’t market families and husbands and wives no more. They’re marketingyoung girls, transgenders ... they’re marketing evil, man ... I ain’t gotnothing against nobody’s preferences, man, but, putting it on TV, that’s crazy,man. You know, kids is the only people watching TV.”Historically, Hip-Hop as a genre and as a culture, has been fiercelyheterosexual – or at least on the surface. Stories of ritual orgies that artistsand executives must undergo to become successful are manifold, of course, andthis was addressed in Volume 1. Many public heroes who appear to be straight,will have partaken in gay sex acts in exchange for their success.But for the purpose of this chapter, we’re talking about the way artists havealways been presented to the public. Prior to the 2010s, few rappers had evercome out of the closet. When a rumour emerged that there was a prominent ‘GayRapper’ in the industry in the late 1990s, and everyone speculated on who itcould be, it was big news, because it went so against the grain of what thatgenre had always been about. If, during those years, any A-list artist hadappeared in public wearing women’s clothing, it would have been headline news inthe Hip-Hop press.How things have changed.Where the dress-style of choice for rappers used to be loose-fitting jeans,T-shirts and hoodies – and the baggier the better – by the early 2000s, artistssuch as Drake, Kanye West, Andre 3000 and Pharrell Williams had made it theirtrademark to rock the ‘metrosexual’ look, consisting of tight-fitting clothing,heavy on the pink. Not long afterwards came the trendy talk of artists being“gender-fluid,” “gender-neutral,” or “non-binary.”The London grime artist Skepta indicated the international nature of the agendawhen he appeared at an awards event sporting women’s knitwear, proudlyproclaiming that he was now “gender fluid.” The fact that this has been achievedwith very little backlash – and with those voicing any kind of objection quicklydenounced as ‘bigoted’ or ‘intolerant’ – in a genre previously so full ofalpha-male machismo, is testament to how successful the manipulators have becomeat their game, and how socially-intimidated people seem to speak out.Male artists wearing women’s clothing has become more blatant as the years haveprogressed. Gnarls Barkley star Cee-Lo Green appeared in a photoshoot wearing awedding dress; A$AP Rocky donned a dress during an episode of BET’s ’106 &Park;’ Lil’ B wore women’s earrings in the video to his ‘Got the Mack Loaded;’Lil’ Wayne performed at the 2011 VMA Awards topless, and wearing women’sleopard-print leggings, (see the last book’s section on the true meaning of thismotif.)Will Smith’s son Jaden has worn similar leggings; Yung Joc turned up to anindustry event wearing a dress; Young Thug appeared in a photoshoot dressed asLittle Bo Beep and had previously worn a leopard-print dress; Lil’ Uzi Vert,(say the name quickly a couple of times and see what it sounds like,) is keen onrocking the womens’ wear too; Lil Yachty, (what is it with all the Lil’s andYung’s??!) had a cover design for one of his releases featuring a gay couplekissing. Nothing wrong with it per se, but timing and context are the importantfactors in establishing whether something is part of a far-reaching agenda. Whydid the release come at that specific time, and what else was going on in thescene at large? One thing was a number of artists, such as iLoveMakonnen, BigFreedia and Frank Ocean ‘coming out’ as gay.The comments of comedian Dave Chappelle regarding the ritualistic requirementfor virtually all black males in Hollywood to wear a dress in one of theirfilms, are worth considering in this context, too. You can hear them in thisvideo – https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=7lbFRYF-bbM[https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=7lbFRYF-bbM]By the time ‘up and coming’ Florida ‘rapper’ (it says here) NewAge Jerkboy(!?!!) had emerged with his video ‘Married to the Game,’ in which he talks of“your bitch giving me neck” ... while fellating machine guns in a wedding dresswith colourful bows in his dyed-blond hair ... all hope for the future ofhumanity had been lost.A blurring of the genders is taking place, straight out of the Tavistockinstruction manual. And working in tandem with the feminisation of male artists,there is a trend towards females becoming more masculine, (see Angel Haze,Azealia Banks, Melange Lavonne, Temper, Dai Burger, God-Des & She, RoxXxan,Kin4Life.)(While I think of it, here’s another slow-drip change that’s been creeping upwith stealth, and about which nobody else seems to be talking. The ridiculous,retarded and impossible-to-remember spelling of artist names, The likes ofWill.i.am, Yxng Bane, A$AP Ferg, A$AP Rocky, Cashh, Ty Dolla $ign, The Weeknd,Lotto Boyzz, Desiigner, MadeinTYO, Mnek, iLoveMakonnen, look like someone fellasleep over a computer keyboard, and resemble expressions of the ‘Newspeak’concept out of Orwell’s ’1984,’ where citizens are made impotent by a new,meaningless language.Why is the Hip-Hop scene so unrecognisable from what it was twenty, or even tenyears ago? And why has this genre in particular been selected for so muchcultural manipulation? These are the questions that anyone who doesn’tappreciate having their thoughts and values moulded for them by other peoplewould do well to consider."},{"pageContent":"Resources:Good Vibrations

Otherwise known as‘The McCartney Mindfuck.’“Them freaks was right when they said you was dead.”John Lennon: ‘How Do You Sleep?’ (1971)“Living is easy with eyes closed, misunderstanding all you see.”The Beatles: ‘Strawberry Fields’ (1966)“The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideasin one’s mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function”F. Scott Fitzgerald, 1896-1940A conclusion I reached a while back when trying to navigate the whole arena oftruth and conspiracy – and with the many cul-de-sacs that any well-meaningresearcher can be led down – is that it’s often easier to describe a situationby stating what it isn’t, rather than trying to quantify what it is. This isstating things in the apophatic, and it comes as great advice when addressingthe possible death (but certain replacement) of Paul McCartney.As many have discovered to their peril, entering the realm of what’s known inconspiracy circles as PID, or ‘Paul Is Dead,’ can easily dominate anunsuspecting researcher’s curiosity to the point of obsession, or potentialinsanity, (trust me, I know,) and the more you delve into the subject, the moreyou realise just how deep this one really goes. (If the whole discussion of PaulMcCartney having been replaced in 1966 is making any readers go,‘wait ... what??!,’ by the way, they’re advised to read the 15,000-word chapteron the subject in ‘Musical Truth 1’!)You might think that researching the McCartney puzzle in-depth for many hundredsof hours would bring some incisive clarity on the subject, as the pieces get puttogether, and the contradictions get gradually ironed out. Personally, I’vefound the opposite to be the case, and I’m just being honest when I say that, atthe tail end of such a process, I’m now more confused than I ever was. A shortwhile ago, I’d have maintained that the only thing, that anyone can say with anydegree of certainty, is that the individual claiming today to be ‘PaulMcCartney’ is not the biological James Paul McCartney born on 18th June 1942. Asfar as I was concerned, you started from there with a blank sheet of paper.I’m no longer sure of even that, however, my stance having now changed to: theonly thing anyone can say with any certainty, is that there have been at leasttwo ‘Paul McCartneys,’ and almost certainly more than two. This much, at least,can be gleaned by considering photographs and film footage from over the yearswith a keen eye and an open mind.I was encouraged to see this healthy dynamic of changing one’s position upon theemergence of new information summed up wonderfully by the researcher Marty Leedson one of his Youtube videos:“We are all in the process of learning. We are all in the process ofself-discovery. We are all researching and questioning the world around us. Noone has all the answers, and I certainly do not claim to. In the course of mylife, I have changed my opinion and position countless times on things I wasonce very passionate about. This is growth. This is the evolution of the self. Imay say something I may later regret, disagree with, have to clarify in greaterdetail, or have changed my position on. I am human.”I used to consider it a given that the real Paul McCartney was the shorter guywith the rounder, chubby face, and that the full-time impostor referred to as‘Faul’ was taller and slimmer with a more elongated face and darker eyes.However, the very process of comparing photographs leaves you with several earlypictures of a young “Paul’ – many from before his Beatles days – who resemblesfar more the character known as Faul than he does the chubbier-faced Paul![../images/00019.jpeg]Paul McCartney ... or is it?, (wink, wink.)https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_McCartney_black_and_white_2010.jpg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paul_McCartney_black_and_white_2010.jpg]Credit: Oli GillOf course, in this age of Photoshop, any image on the internet could have beensubject to tinkering at the hands of pranksters or those with more sinistermotives. But either way, I have to ask myself whether the individual todayposing as ‘Paul’ may actually be the real Paul, and the chubby-faced characterwas the impostor?! Have we in fact been witnessing two individuals, whoever theymay be, (or more than two,) stepping in and out of the ‘Paul’ role right fromthe start, and long before the supposed 1966 switch of PID myth? This ideacertainly ties into the first of the alternative theories that I will detail indue course. It also turns your brain to scrambled eggs.There is a common denominator at play whichever of these theories may be thecase, though – if either of them are – and that is the element of deception.Once again, the general public has been duped and played for fools. Deception isthe enemy of Truth and all that is pure in Creation. When someone sets out todeceive us, they take away our inherent, sovereign right to Truth. That makesany knowing deceiver an enemy.Whatever the reason for the switch or the interchanging of two or more ‘Pauls,’the parties concerned are deliberately deceiving millions. Whoever else may beOK with that, and who may attempt all manner of justifications as to why it hadto be done, I’m not. That’s why the McCartney deception has swallowed up so manyhours of my time, and will doubtless lay claim to many, many more.CONFESSIONS OF A CHARLATAN?At the time of writing the last book’s McCartney chapter, I was fairly sold onthe narrative that biological Paul had indeed died in 1966, and had beenreplaced by an impostor who has been taking his place to this day. It was thehuge array of symbolic clues that had me convinced, understanding as I did thefavoured tenet of placing the truth in plain sight – or Revelation of theMethod – that the elite occultists seem to feel duty-bound to observe. Arguablythe most comprehensive overview of the clues comes from the thorough ‘The WalrusWas Paul’ book by R. Gary Patterson, who sadly passed away in 2017 during thewriting of this volume.I didn’t, however, buy into the conventional theory that McCartney had died asthe result of a freak accident that nobody could have foreseen, and that BrianEpstein and the other Beatles had worked quickly to find a replacement, so thatfans could have been spared the trauma of discovering that their beloved Paulwas no longer with them. Many PID researchers seem content to accept that it wasa genuine tragic event, that the forces that controlled the Beatles were caringlike that, and that the individual stepping into the ‘Paul’ role did soselflessly and with noble intent. Call me suspicious, (I’m called worse,) but Ialways considered the circumstances to be far more nefarious.The waters get muddied in this regard, rather than made any clearer, by the book‘The Memoirs of Billy Shears.’ Credited to an author/ encoder named Thomas E.Uharriet, this tome is written in the first-person, and purports to be theauto-biographical confession of one William Wallace Shepherd. This individual issaid to be the full-time replacement for Paul McCartney since 11th September1966, (9/11 in the US date format) when, the book claims, Paul died in theaforementioned tragic car accident. (Other tellings of the fable put the date at9th November of ’66 – an alternative rendering of the date 9/11 in the Europeanformat.) The whole story is bound together by Masonic fraternal links and oathsof secrecy.’Memoirs’ comes with all kinds of creative touches, such as its 66 chaptersrunning to 666 pages, (a number which continually pops up within the occultaspects of the entertainment industry,) and its paragraphs carrying varioushidden codes. I’d not read ‘Memoirs’ at the time of writing ‘Musical Truth 1,’but I now have, and I had an incisive two-hour chat about it with Mike Williams,aka Sage of Quay, the YouTube link to which you can find in the Resourcessection at the end.The sheer amount of detail put forward regarding the Beatles, their closecircle, and their songs, certainly suggests the book was written by someone withintimate working experience of the group. ‘Memoirs’ claims, for example, thatthe lyrics to ‘Lady Madonna’ partly chronicle the week of Paul’s replacementprocess stage-by-stage, (“Tuesday afternoon is never ending” referring to JohnLennon’s unbearable anguish at being told Paul had been killed, “Wednesdaymorning papers didn’t come” referring to a journalist by the name of Sam beingpaid off to not publish his planned exposé, and later cropping up in the “SailorSam” reference in the Wings song ’Band On the Run,’) and that (real) Paul’s song‘Michelle’ is not in fact an ode to a lover, but refers to a secret daughter hehad with a French woman.There’s either deep inside knowledge here, or the writer has a highly vividimagination and has dedicated years of painstakingly thorough research to gethis facts straight.The book also makes it clear, however, that it is a work of “historicalfiction,” its author claiming that, though mostly based in fact, due to thesensitive nature of the subject matter, certain parts of the story have beenfictionalised. The reader is therefore left to discern which parts can beconsidered ‘fact’ – and therefore the true confession of the McCartneyreplacement – and which parts are indeed fictional embellishments. No easy task.But then nothing in this realm of research is.Incidentally, the William Wallace Shepherd of the book, (known by the nickname‘Billy Shears’, hence the “so may I introduce to you the one and only BillyShears” line at the start of the ‘Sgt. Pepper’ album,) claims to be a descendentof the Scottish nobleman-turned-freedom fighter William Wallace, who wasportrayed by Mel Gibson in the movie ‘Braveheart,’ as well as hailing from along-running line of high-ranking freemasons. Given the earlier chapter’saccounts of how different generations of the same bloodline keep popping up inpublic roles through the centuries – from politicians to assassins toaristocrats to rock stars – this claim is perhaps not as outrageous as it mightat first seem.‘Memoirs’ never comes right out and states that Paul’s supposed death was aplanned-for event, but claims that he had been haunted by fateful premonitionsthat he was to die young, and that another would take his place. His apparentdemise was hinted at through the hundreds of symbolic clues and backmaskedmessages placed into the Beatles’ subsequent album sleeves and recordings, andthese have strong occult and mystical overtones.Given what we’re now able to understand about the true nature of those whoreally control the entertainment industries, it always struck me as feasiblethat Paul could have been taken out in some kind of occult ritual, for who knowswhat ultimate purpose? This pre-knowledge on the part of the instigators wouldvalidate the long period that Faul (‘fake’ or ‘faux Paul,’ as the replacementhas come to be known,) would have had to prepare for the role that he would playfor the rest of his days, and get the act down to a fine art.On the matter of the naming of William Shepherd, meanwhile, it’s intriguing tofactor in a book, published in 1964, titled ‘The True Story of the Beatles,’ thewriting of which just happened to be credited to one Billy Shepherd, about whomvery little else seems to be known. In Amazon’s on-line reviews of the book, onecontributor has observed:“Bill Shepherd was obviously a competent professional writer ... He would havehad very limited time in which to research and write this book ... Clearly, hisjob was to write a positive book, but also clearly, he became personallyinterested and liked the lads. I’m not so sure he really liked their music.”(A ‘Billy Shepherd’ also crops up on Amazon, meanwhile, as the author of a booktitled ‘Strange Death in Venice.’ This was published in 2017, however, so itseems unlikely that it’s the same individual, given that the two books are 53years apart.)For a while, this struck me as a fairly clear-cut scenario, and factoring in allthe symbolic hints and the forensic evidence available to us – in spite of therestill being no mainstream acceptance that a McCartney replacement had takenplace – we could consider ourselves close to being able to tie this one up witha neat little bow on it ... right?Oh, how naive I was. Unfortunately, the world of conspiracy research rarelyoffers such decisive outcomes. And so it has been with this one as, through themonths during which this book was being written, a number of alternativescenarios emerged regarding the possible truth of the McCartney conundrum. Ifyou believed everything you read on the internet, you’d have to conclude thatPaul never really died and is now posing as John Halliday, the caretaker of hisold childhood home; that he died in a car accident; that he was rituallysacrificed; that he just got bored and disappeared from public view; that he wasreplaced by a single impostor; that he was replaced by several impostors,including many that were around even before 1966; and that the replacement wasalso Keith Allison of Paul Revere & The Raiders, Vivian Stanshall of the BonzoDog Doo-Dah Band, Phil Ackrill of the Diplomats, Spencer Davis of the SpencerDavis Group, and Denny Laine of the Moody Blues. (Insert Facepalm meme here.)Of the stupefying array of pet theories out there, however, there are two which,in my view, are worth examining in full. Both – at least in part – seem to carrya degree of credibility. Any genuine truthseeker is therefore invited tocontemplate each of them with an open mind.TWIN PEAKSA writer whose challenging theories on key world events have caused muchdivisive debate in recent years, (I know the feeling,) is Miles Mathis, apainter and poet who turned to conspiracy research as a sideline through hissite http://www.mileswmathis.com [http://www.mileswmathis.com], (from which PDFsof all his articles can be downloaded.) Among Mathis’ various contentions – alllaid out in comprehensive articles often with photographic back-up – are thatthe Kennedy and Lincoln assassinations were faked with both presidents complicitin the hoaxes, and that the Tate/ LaBianca ‘Manson murders’ of 1969 neveractually happened.Similarly, Mathis maintains that virtually every celebrity who is said to havedied at an untimely age, was in fact retired out of the public spotlight, havingbeen assets of the intelligence services. Among their number, he says, areMarilyn Monroe, Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, River Phoenix, TupacShakur, Notorious BIG, Kurt Cobain, James Dean, Paul Walker, Robin Williams,John Belushi, Natalie Wood, William Holden, Chris Kyle, Brittany Murphy, BruceLee, Grace Kelly, Princess Diana, Michael Jackson and Heath Ledger. I certainlydon’t go along with everything that Mathis claims, but by the same token, Idon’t discard it all out of hand, either. Each case deserves some examination onits own merits.Mathis’ claim, is that his keen artist’s eye allows him to spot subtleinconsistencies in pictures from these events that get missed by most others,which is where the giveaways so often lie. He got in on Beatles territory withhis much-discussed article alleging that John Lennon’s assassination in 1980 wasfaked and that, in fact, Lennon continues to perform as a musician under theassumed name of Mark Staycer, the subject of a 2009 independent Canadian moviecalled ‘Let Him Be.’ Although the film presents itself as a fictional tale ofStaycer being suspected of being Lennon, Mathis suggested that its narrativegives the opportunity to understand what has really taken place.Mathis then went further by publishing a detailed paper concerning the allegeddeath and replacement of Paul McCartney. Solving this apparent mystery wasactually a very simple matter, he proclaimed. He didn’t even want to go to theeffort of compiling the article, but did so somewhat reluctantly in response torequests from his readers.The Paul/ Faul enigma can be explained away easily, Mathis stated, by the factthat Paul was one of two fraternal, (non-identical) twins, born together in1942. The pair have been stepping in and out of the ‘Paul’ role from the startof the Beatles’ career, hence the slight discrepancies and inconsistencies rightfrom the early days. (This would certainly explain both the obvious differencesbetween the many pictures of ‘Paul’ in existence, and the early pictures of ayoung, pre-Beatles ‘Paul’ looking more like the latter-day ‘Faul,’ who is onlysupposed to have come on the scene as late as 1966 according to the conventionalconspiracy theory.)‘Mike McCartney,’ meanwhile, who goes by the stage name of Mike McGear, is anoutside actor who was brought in to play the role of Paul’s sibling. Whateveranyone’s stance on the theory, it’s certainly the case that Mike looks nothinglike Paul.So, according to this theory, the one everyone calls ‘Faul’ is in fact the realMike McCartney. And neither Faul/ Mike nor Paul died – at least not back in1966. Both may still be around today. It was Mike, (the one known as Faul,) whomarried Linda and was in Wings and has done everything since, as Paul retiredfrom public view early on. Mike, Mathis surmises, enjoyed the limelight, andchose to continue basking in it. To enable this, Mike/ Faul underwent somesurgery to the eye area of his face, to give his eyes a similar droopyappearance to those of his sibling. As Mathis comments in his article:“You see, the problem for them after about 1990 was that no matter what theydid, they couldn’t match all the wrinkles. Faces are going to age in differentways, and need touch-ups in different places. It is doubtful they could makethem interchangeable into their 70s. Since Mike did most of the publicappearances in the 80s, they had to go with him after that.”And a further musing:“Or ... maybe we just have the names reversed. We called the early one Paul justto suit ourselves, and to match the Paul/ Faul split on other websites. But wecan just as easily flip that, because we don’t really know who was Paul and whowas Mike. You will say the early prominent performer was Paul, and he got to usehis name on the records. But that is just an assumption. As we have seen, bothwere involved from the beginning, and maybe they flipped a coin for which nameto use. Which means the early one was Mike and the later one was Paul.“That solves all the problems, because that means the guy now appearing as Paulreally is Paul. He doesn’t have to lie about that. He just has to continue tohide he is a twin. For those of you still connected to the Faul theory, thatmeans Faul really is Paul, and the early guy you love more is Mike. Mike wrote‘Yesterday,’ could hit the high notes, and was left-handed.”Mathis also contends, however, that there was a third ‘McCartney’ who hasappeared in pictures over the years, who is neither Mike/ Faul nor Paul! This isconsistent with other researchers who have concluded that there was more thanone ‘Paul’ seen in public even before 1966. Many of those who veer towards thedeath-and-replacement theory, meanwhile, also maintain that it wasn’t justfull-time Faul who played the ‘Paul’ role, but that there were other stand-inswho occasionally appeared in cameos or photo-shoots, as evidenced by the arrayof inconsistencies in facial features of the various ‘McCartneys.’ This notionis backed-up by Uharriet in ‘Memoirs’ and is a viewpoint shared by Tina Foster,proprietor of the highly popular Plastic Macca blog site.One of Mathis’ earlier papers had alleged that Elvis Presley was also one oftwins, (Elvis and Aron Presley,) and that the reported death of ‘Elvis’ inAugust 1977 was another hoaxed event. The official record states that Elvis hada twin brother named Jesse Garon, who arrived stillborn, but Mathis questionswhether this was a cover story, and whether both twins in fact survived and wereplaced into the public eye as ‘Elvis.’ Twins are greatly favoured within themilitary-intelligence communities, where both are often put to work on covertmissions to confound and confuse. (Orphans are similarly favoured – a factmentioned in the narrative of a recent James Bond movie.)Mathis’ assertion that the Beatles, like many other popular music acts, were aproduct of military-intelligence, is consistent with the viewpoint of severalother researchers in this field. The group were an asset of these agencies rightfrom the start, and the role they played in popularising the LSD-ladencounter-culture in the second half of the ‘60s – after first building a massivefanbase through their simplistic love songs – was always on the agenda. If oneaccepts this, it seems highly feasible that Paul being interchangeable twins,who could be shuffled in and out of that role at will, could also have been partof the long-term plan.As Mathis further comments in his article:“Why do you think they were both in the Beatles from the beginning? Well, forone thing, I have shown you early pics of both brothers being passed off asPaul. Then we have voice analysis, indicating multiple Pauls. See the Italianforensic work, ‘Wired’ magazine, 2009. Plus, we now know they had twinsavailable, so why not use them?“I suggest that is the main reason Paul and Mike were chosen: intelligence lovestwins. It is the same reason they hire twins in Hollywood, as with Ashley andMary Kate Olson. You always have a back-up if someone gets sick, gets cranky,breaks an arm, etc. And you can get twice as much PR done with twins. We knowthey didn’t hire the boys because they were great musicians. The early historiesadmit that. Maybe they became great songwriters later, maybe they didn’t, butearly on none of them were great on their instruments, or as vocalists. So theremust be another reason they hired them.”The twins theory also helps explain the discrepancies in height between Paul andFaul, as commented on by so many over the years.“ ... Notice how tall he is in all the early public appearances, just as hewould be on the cover of ‘Sgt. Pepper’s.’ This is how they created confusionfrom the very beginning. They got you used to accepting both brothers as Paul.”Furthermore, Mathis has an intriguing take on why the whole ‘Paul Is Dead’conspiracy is said to have begun back in 1966, with the following year’s ’Sgt.Pepper’ offering some of the best clues. It all stems from Paul’s reported mopedaccident of Christmas ’65, in which he is said to have cut his lip and chippedhis tooth. This became a problem for the twins’ handlers, he asserts, since itwould now be necessary for the other brother’s tooth to appear chipped in thesame way, such was the close scrutiny that fans applied to pictures of theiridol.As this realisation dawned in the early part of 1966, it was decided that it wasbecoming too much hassle to continue using both brothers. One of them would haveto be ‘retired’ out of the spotlight, enabling the other to continue solo.Although Paul might have been considered to have had a better singing voice, itwas decided to go with Mike/ Faul, since he was more personable and chatty ininterviews. And so from that point, he stepped into the role full-time.This timeframe would also explain why the Beatles quit touring after theirAugust ’66 gig at San Francisco’s Candlestick Park; as Mike/ Faul was tallerthan Paul, the height differential between him and Lennon would now be tooobvious with the two of them sharing a mic front-stage.Mathis’ essay contains a highly intriguing photograph which has been the subjectof much internet debate. It shows a group of people on a river boat, and wasreportedly first published in issue 61 of ‘The Beatles Book’ fanzine in August1968. It appears to show two ‘Pauls’ in the same picture – one, looking morelike early-1960s McCartney standing at the side, with the character known as‘Faul’ seated in the centre. Some even maintain that the individual on the otherside of the boat looks like a third Paul! Naturally, for every on-line commenterwho cites the picture as evidence that Paul was still on the scene in 1968,there is one who will claim the picture is a photoshopped fake.Mathis maintains that many on-line photos of Paul – as was the case withElvis – have now been digitally retouched to obfuscate some of the more obviousgiveaways that we are looking at twins. While the internet has been aninvaluable tool for independent research, its digital nature unfortunatelyrenders it susceptible to such technological hoaxes. Many have also complainedthat certain early film footage of the Beatles has been digitally tampered within order to make ‘Paul’ and ‘Faul’ look more alike – most notably in facialstructure.There also exists in internet circulation, a picture taken during the filming ofthe ‘Magical Mystery Tour’ movie in 1967. The one known as ‘Faul’ appears frontcentre, but in the background is a character who looks distinctly like ‘real’Paul sporting a goatee beard.It may well be nothing, but it would be remiss of me in the context of thischapter not to mention that ‘Paul McCartney’ released a collaborative album in2005 with DJ/ producer Freelance Hellraiser, aka Roy Kerr, titled ‘Twin Freaks.’In direct correspondence with Thomas Uharriet, author/ encoder of ‘The MemoirsOf Billy Shears,’ I asked him what his reaction was to Mathis’ twins theory,given that this contradicts what he had written in his book. Uharriett replied:“ ... even if Paul did have an identical twin, which would have been a strangething to keep secret his entire life, it could not be William. William, as the‘Memoirs’ points out, has significantly different DNA than Paul’s daughter. Anidentical twin would have lost that paternity suit.“Past the initial honeymoon phase, William’s interaction with the McCartneyfamily was not consistent with being one of them. For example, if William reallyhad been Paul’s twin, Jim would have attended William’s wedding, and Williamwould have attended Jim’s funeral.“Some people can’t believe that Paul and William can even be separate people,because they are so much alike. However, that is just the mind playing tricks onus. In many ways, (in musical ability, personality, and in physicality,) theyare about as different as two men can be. Most people just refuse to see itbecause it does not match their beliefs. The twin idea might just be someone’sway to explain how they can be so much alike – even though they aren’t.”A VOICE FROM THE ROOFTOPA lone voice with a tantalisingly alternative theory in the whole McCartneymess, has been American citizen researcher Ellen Raine. Like many, she startedout accepting the idea that Paul – whatever the circumstances – had died back in’66, and that Faul had been playing the full-time role ever since.However, some close scrutiny of the bearded ‘Paul’ who played the famous rooftopgig above London’s EMI Studios in 1969 – as documented in the movie ‘Let ItBe’ – led her to deduce that this individual was different to the moustached‘Faul’ who had first appeared on a video reel filmed by Beatles roadie Mal Evanson the trip that ‘Paul’ took to Kenya in November ’66, and the one who appearedin interviews throughout ’67.The new theory, therefore, was that ‘Rooftop’ Paul may have been the realWilliam Shepherd spoken of in the ‘Memoirs’ book, and that he appeared just forthis temporary period before himself being replaced by Faul 2:0. (I do hopeyou’re following ... there’ll be questions later.) Always observing thatclosely-held theories should be open to revision upon the emergence of newevidence, however, upon noting the talent and skill, (left-handed, no less,) andstudying the mannerisms and facial features of ‘Rooftop’ further, Ellen noticedhow closely these matched those of true, biological Paul. She takes care topoint out that these references to a bearded ‘Paul,’ are strictly to the one whoappeared in the ‘Let It Be’ footage itself; this individual is markedlydifferent from other bearded renderings of ‘Paul’ from around the same time,including – confusingly – the very publicity stills promoting the movie, as wellas the one appearing on the cover of 1970s solo ‘McCartney’ album.As she stated to me in private discussion on the subject:“Rooftop has haunted me from the day I first watched ‘Let It Be’ recently; whenhe looked up from the piano in the opening scene, I felt sure it was Paul. Ikept pinching myself all through the movie. It couldn’t be him ... Too tall,too heavy, too much forehead, different hair part, acting crazy and/ or‘unPaul-like’ at times, (dressing slovenly, picking his nose, doing that stupid“wooo” thing.) Besides which, he was supposed to be dead! All reasons I’d beenled to believe by PID that it couldn’t be Paul.“But as I found those ‘facts’ to be false one by one, I realised – it could behim.“The hair he was constantly pushing back – which I thought was just a nervoushabit – could be trying to fall forward, as Paul’s did. He could’ve gainedweight in three years, as he was prone to that from an early age. A recedinghairline, which he was rumoured to have, could explain the ‘larger’ exposedforehead and temple area.“As for his being dead ... what proof was there, really, other than clues thathad simply been repeated so often that they came to be accepted as fact?”In one out-take from ‘Let It Be,’ Paul is describing in great detail a longcamera shot which will close in on Ringo’s face. His voice, Ellen suggests, isidentical to that of real Paul from early interviews, and scousers haveconfirmed that it sounds like a genuine Liverpool accent, rather than the,at-times questionable one affected by the older Faul.Ellen also contends it’s a myth that Paul was shorter than the other Beatles ataround 5’8”, and that his actual height was around 5’11”, according to printedpre-1966 biographies, which is consistent with the height of the bearded Rooftopperformer.“Look at any photo of the four of them performing on stage together or sharing amic; Paul, John and George are equal heights, (presumably around 5’11”.) All thefan magazines peg him at 5’11”. I’ve heard everything from elevator shoes tofalsification of his height. Why? They didn’t ‘elongate’ Ringo, so why wouldthey Paul? The bronze statue in Liverpool has the three being equal height, withRingo much shorter. Did they get it wrong?”Finally, Ellen spied a capped tooth on the ‘Let It Be’ Paul – the exact toothPaul chipped in that moped accident in 1965.And so, a new possibility was born. Paul didn’t die in 1966. He was merelyreplaced, and we can only speculate as to the reason. Biological Paul may wellbe dead now, having passed in the intervening years ... but equally, he maystill be alive, living his life outside of the spotlight. His 75th birthdaywould have been on 18th June 2017.Paul’s BBC interview with David Frost in April 1964 deserves a mention here, asFrost asks him about his future ambitions. Paul replies: “I’d like to retire.”When Frost asks him when, Paul replies: “The way things are going, about acouple of years or so!”We might also factor in comments made by George Harrison in an interview for theBeatles 1964 Christmas show with DJ Chris Denning, (later disgraced during hisBBC years when he was revealed to have been a serial child sex offender.) Georgesays:“I’d like to send a request to somebody I used to go to school with, and he usedto play bass in the group – Paul McCartney. And if you’re listening, Paul atwork, it was great going to school with you and we had a nice time, and I’d liketo play a nice one called ‘Love Me Do’.”The head-scratcher here is that all three of his bandmates were present as hemade his comments. George dropped many an apparent ‘clue’ pertaining to thereplacement of Paul in interviews over the years.TAKING A BACK SEAT?If Paul was away from the scene from 1966 to this suggested re-appearance threeyears later, Ellen wonders if he may well have been involved in the fabled caraccident, but that he was temporarily incapacitated – possibly even left withresidual brain damage from a head injury – rather than killed. Full-time ‘Faul,’(or some combination of Fauls,) would have played the ‘Paul’ role during thisperiod, before real Paul was brought back for ‘Let It Be.’ And there could be avery straightforward reason as to why this was done.“The Beatles – that is, John, George, Ringo and Paul – were contractuallyobligated to make three, (count them, three) movies ... ‘A Hard Day’s Night,’‘Help!’ and, you guessed it. And I remain 99 per cent sure they did just that.‘Yellow Submarine’ wouldn’t have counted as it was a cartoon. And it certainlywasn’t Paul in ‘Magical Mystery Tour.’ Besides which, they discussed, (either inclips or an interview,) what the ‘plot’ of their third and final movie would be:a surprise live performance.”The following citation comes from:http://www.metafilter.com/99796/The-Beatles-in-film-the-movies-they-never-made-and-then-some[http://www.metafilter.com/99796/The-Beatles-in-film-the-movies-they-never-made-and-then-some]”Very early in their career, the group signed a three-movie deal with UnitedArtists as a way to get increased publicity, with A Hard Day’s Night (1964) andHelp! (1965) being completed in short time. An early contender for their thirdfilm was a western comedy.”Back to the story, and with ‘Let It Be’ in the bag – which was filmed in theearly weeks of 1969 but not released until the group’s break-up a yearlater – Paul was switched again with Faul for an unknown reason. (I do hopeyou’re still following. I find a cup of tea and a brisk walk often helps.)An observation of my own, which – as far as I’m concerned – proves the use of atleast one ‘Faul,’ is the fact that in the video to ‘Hey Jude,’ which is onrecord as having been filmed in September 1968, ‘Paul,’ (who is seen to havegreen eyes in contrast to biological Paul’s documented brown ones,) isclean-shaven. By 2nd January 1969 when the ‘Let It Be’ sessions began, ‘Paul’ issporting a long and bushy beard. He is supposed to have grown this in less thanfour months, which seems unlikely for a beard in such advanced stages. There’salso the fact that his hair colour is much darker than in ‘Hey Jude.’ A stick-onbeard and hair dye are possibilities, I guess, but they don’t seem very likely.It’s fairly clear that the individual in ‘Let It Be’ is a different person tothe one in ‘Hey Jude.’It was only after hatching her theory independently, that Ellen discovered thevery same idea had earlier been suggested by the blogger and on-line forumposter known as Apollo C. Vermouth. This was a pseudonym officially credited to‘Paul McCartney,’ under which he produced the song ‘I’m The Urban Spaceman’ forthe Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band in 1968. (The notion that a heavily-disguised Faul,aka William Shepherd, also played the role of Bonzos frontman Vivian Stanshall,is a major part of the narrative of Uharriet’s ‘Memoirs’ book.)By the time the Vermouth blog had sprung up in the early 2000s, the populartheory was that this was a pseudonym adopted by close Beatles associate NeilAspinall, who went on to die in 2008. In various posts, ‘Vermouth’ alleged thatPaul had left the Beatles in 1965 or ’66, but came back for a later, temporaryperiod, by which point the others had grown accustomed to his absence.So, was the fabled car accident just a diversion tactic, and all the symbolicclues pertaining to it deliberately planted as red herrings? Did real Paul justwant out of the group by 1966, and so the replacement underwent surgery andtraining ready to provide a seamless transition? As Ellen reflects:“I believe it’s possible there was a car accident, (it was initially reported,then silenced, after all,) he did suffer a head injury, (closed-head and likelyfronto-temporal, which affects behaviour, since he acts a little loopy at timesin ‘Let It Be,’) and that he was metaphorically ‘dead’ as far as the band wasconcerned. This would explain all the clues, lyrics, and legends which speak toa car accident and head injury, as well as what many see as a personalityaltered. And not for the better; brain injuries are notorious for this. Hencethe end of touring and sightings and the replacement(s.)“My working theory is that someone else penned the music in the studio, someoneelse portrayed him – usually badly – in public and, once he was sufficientlyrecovered, he attempted a comeback in ‘Let It Be,’ but both George and John wereover it and were ready to move on at that point. What became of him after that,I have no idea.“Nothing else explains – well, his being so Paul-like in ‘Let It Be’ – as wellas his mates’ genuine grief at the time, (the band as they knew it was ‘dead,’)in contrast to the relative calm and acceptance of this ruse by Paul’s lovedones, (he was injured, but not lost to them forever.) Who else would, or couldcreate Beatles music before our very eyes as he does in that film, exhibit suchtalent and skill, (left-handed, no less,) irreverently reprise their pastobscure hit ‘Basame Mucho,’ impersonate Elvis as Paul did in the early days, anddesperately try to revive the old magic?“The film has, to me, the air of a bitter-sweet, ill-fated schoolboy reunion.”Ellen recounts that, when she suggested to Thomas Uharriett that what we may bedealing here is a symbolic or metaphorical death, rather than a physical one, hedidn’t dispute or contradict it, merely remarking that he “likes how her brainworks.” Adding that she was an English major, and thus both recognised andappreciated literary licence and allegory, Uharriet responded that he, too, wasan English major. However, being pressed on the point, he predictably insistedthat his narrative was “mostly” true and that William is real.CALAMITY JANELeaving no stone unturned, Ellen suggests it might also be worth factoring inPaul’s old flame, the actress Jane Asher. Jane’s father was Dr. Richard Asher,who reportedly worked on psychological research on behalf of British militaryintelligence, and who turned up dead in his London home in extremely suspiciouscircumstances in 1969. He is said to have “committed suicide.” His WimpoleStreet medical practice was only a few yards from that of Dr. Stephen Ward,(portrayed by John Hurt in the movie ‘Scandal,’) who was implicated in theProfumo political affair of 1963, and who is also said to have “committedsuicide.”Dr. Asher was a pioneer in hypnotic techniques, and had written several articleson the subject for the ‘Lancet’ medical journal. Jane’s mother, meanwhile, was aprofessor of music, and is credited with having taught piano to George Martin,often known as ‘the fifth Beatle.’ Jane herself, though best known for her rolein the Michael Caine film ‘Alfie,’ had also portrayed Alice in a 1959 albumversion of ‘Alice Through the Looking Glass.’ Lewis Carroll’s ‘Alice’ storiesare known triggers in mind-control programming techniques.According to the pictorial evidence available, Jane appears to have dated bothbiological Paul, (as we think of him,) and his post-1966 replacement. It was inthe very house where her father’s corpse was discovered, that Paul hadreportedly lived on-and-off for two years, and where he is said to have writtenmany of his most famous songs. These include ‘Yesterday,’ which Paul onceclaimed was in his head one morning when he woke and he was worried he may haveplagiarised it, and ‘Eleanor Rigby.’Given the nature of Dr. Asher’s work, a suspicious researcher, (me,) mightspeculate as to whether Paul could have been some kind of in-house test subjectfor his mind-control experiments, and whether the whole scenario didn’t endhappily. Could this be the real reason for Paul’s ‘loopiness’ as observed byEllen, with the car crash myth invented as diversion?Jane has remained closed-lipped about the entire PID conspiracy, and indeed, hervery relationship with Paul all these decades. She did, however, publish a bookin 1998, a novel entitled ‘The Question,’ which Ellen later discovered, andwhich seems to lend credence to her theory. In the acknowledgements, Jane thanksthe Royal Hospital of Neurodisability for its help. And according to thepromotional blurb:“It all starts with a chance remark on the telephone, just a casualconversation, but it leads Eleanor Hamilton to an appalling and deeplydisturbing discovery. John, her husband of twenty years, has been leading adouble life – a life of unbelievable duplicity. Feelings of jealousy, anger andconfusion follow, driving Eleanor to extraordinary limits. Only one thing isclear: she wants revenge for the mockery John has made of her existence, and forthe happiness that she has missed.“Then fate intervenes in the shape of a terrible accident ... ”The references to “unbelievable duplicity,” (anyone getting echoes of HeatherMills’ 2007 TV interviews?) and a “terrible accident,” certainly seemsconsistent with aspects of the PID narrative. The book contains lines such as“is my father a twin?” and “were there two John Hamiltons?”, (remember Faul’sinterview comment of a few years ago that “there are two Paul McCartneys”?,) inaddition to references to a car wreck resulting from a disregarded street lightafter which – according to his daughter – “his mind was sucked out of his head,”(“he blew his mind out in a car”?)Then there’s the sub-plot involving an attempt on the part of the scorned wife,to change the illegitimate daughter’s identity and “reprogramme” herpersonality. Could the book have been a form of catharsis for Jane? The fate ofthis philandering lover who fathered an illegitimate girl child – as Paul waspurported to have done – while denying his wife children of her own, is to entera persistent vegetative state, a kind of ‘nowhere land’ from which he emergesonly slowly over time. He has suffered a small skull fracture, (his looks leftintact,) but extensive damage to the white matter of the brain.As if there weren’t enough confounding discrepancies already, Ellen alsohighlights a particular pair of very distinctive shoes which ‘Paul’ can be seenwearing in ‘Let It Be.’ These same shoes can be seen worn by ‘Paul’ in acollection of intimate, private photographs taken by Linda Eastman (McCartney)the previous year, suggesting that biological Paul – presumably in addition tohis replacement – was around in public in 1968.BILL AND ED’S BOGUS JOURNEYAs for who might have been creating the music in the studio during the threemissing years, and appearing in public as ‘Paul,’ Ellen points to ‘Beatle Bill’and ‘Beatle Ed’ as possibles – both of whom are slyly referenced in a key scenefrom John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’ film from 1971.In it, Lennon and George Harrison are sitting in John’s home kitchen as Yoko Onoprepares tea. In a clip which has been all over YouTube and widely studied foryears, the pair make a reference to “the fab three,” before Lennon winks to thecamera. They are heard talking about “Beatle Bill.” Lennon says: “I hear he’snot doing too well these days,” to which Harrison replies: “He’s number five inSweden.”I always assumed this to be an accurate rendering of the conversation, and that“Beatle Bill” referred to the aforementioned William Shepherd. In 2016, however,a longer, unedited version of that scene came across my radar, in which the pairreference a “Beatle Ed” in the “number five in Sweden” comment. It would appearthat two separate men, Bill and Ed – both alluded to as auxiliary Beatles – arebeing discussed here.So it turns out that the widely-distributed clip has been edited, the “BeatleBill” comment spliced out and re-inserted earlier, replacing the reference to“Beatle Ed” so that listeners assume the whole conversation is referring to“Beatle Bill.”The two questions which emerge, therefore, are: Why would someone go to theeffort of distorting this narrative, and ... who the hell is “Beatle Ed?!”For some, this adds weight to the notion that full-time Faul may in fact be anillegitimate son of Aleister Crowley. Uharriet’s ‘Memoirs’ asserts that Faul wasborn in 1937, whereas Crowley died ten years later. This intimation comes fromthe clues available on the ’Sgt. Pepper’ album sleeve, but also from the factthat ‘Aleister’ was an assumed name, and that Crowley was actually born anEdward, as was his father. Could Faul, (who has been known to project a giantimage of Crowley behind him on stage during performances,) actually be an Edwardtoo – or, rather, Edward III? Could ‘Ed’ have been one of the ‘Paul’ touring orstudio stand-ins? Could Ed, indeed, be today’s touring Sir Paul?Ellen’s take on this:“There were doubles posing for pics and making public appearances in Paul’splace, and who performed in the studio is anybody’s guess! But they needn’t havebeen the same people; Billy Shears may look nothing like Paul. After all, he wasmaking ‘Sgt. Pepper’ behind the scenes. And these doubles and stand-ins had tobe named something! Why not William? Why not Ed?”Which is all inclined to leave one wondering ... what if ‘Paul Is Dead’ is thereal psy-op, and has come to obfuscate the truth that Paul didn’t die in 1966,but was merely replaced for reasons unknown? Suddenly, these possibilities andmore become fair game when the traditional PID myth is subjected to the sameclose scrutiny as Wikipedia-style ’official versions’ of everything else.In 2017, a YouTube poster by the name of Jairo Parra laid claim to the sametheory as Ellen’s, claiming he had “solved the mystery.” The same year,broadcaster Josh Reeves announced he would shortly be presenting “a big reveal”on the subject of McCartney. In preparation for his promised ‘The SpellcastersVolume Two’ documentary, Reeves posted a couple of intriguing video snippets. Inone, a latter-day Faul states: “I joined the Beatles as an already set-upaffair,” (whereas the real Paul was a founder member of the group.) In thesecond, George Harrison appears to be referring to Faul as “the new fella” inthe band, when history has it that George joined after Paul. The links to thesevideos are in the Resources section at the end.TALES OF THE SYNCHRONISTICThere was one particular evening during the writing of this chapter whichinvolved some extensive research, including watching the whole of the ‘Let ItBe’ movie, and obsessing over the whole McCartney conundrum. Finally deciding tocall it a night on the grounds that any more pondering really wouldn’t behealthy, I slinked off to bed. Just as I was about to settle down, I heard mywife scream from outside the bedroom. I asked what was up. She replied: “There’sa giant beetle on the landing.” I almost asked: “Is it Ringo?”I was instantly reminded of this story from Carl Jung in his book‘Synchronicity,’ where he recounts a counselling session he once had with awoman patient. He writes:“She had an impressive dream the night before, in which someone had given her agolden scarab – a costly piece of jewellery. While she was still telling me thisdream, I heard something behind me gently tapping on the window. I turned roundand saw that it was a fairly large flying insect that was knocking against thewindow pane from outside in the obvious effort to get into the dark room.“This seemed to me very strange. I opened the window immediately and caught theinsect in the air as it flew in. It was a scarabaeid beetle.”And not forgetting this section from my last book on the naming of the Beatles:“The alternative consensus, however, appears to be that the group’s name isderived from the horned scarab beetle, a religious symbol of Ancient Egyptianculture. These insects were revered as symbols of regeneration and creation,conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, andresurrection ... Synchronistically, these particular beetles have wings, withPaul McCartney choosing ‘Wings’ as the name of his later group. Intriguingly,‘The Winged Beetle’ was the title of a collection of poems by Aleister Crowley.Heard of him anywhere?”And:“This ties in with many other suggested clues pertaining to three Beatles,rather than four. Among those unearthed have been the family coat-of-arms of keyBeatles producer George Martin. This features three beetle insects in the crest.It has been noted that, with six legs each, the three could be taken as adepiction of 6/6/6. The scarab to the left of the crest appears to have aKabbalah ‘Tree of Life’ pattern ... ”I recounted this tale to Ellen, at which point she told me that she hadn’tplanned to say anything, but that she too had had an unusual beetle appear inher room, on the other side of Atlantic, shortly after our last on-lineconversation. A few days later, she came across the imprint of a scarab beetlepainted on the ground on one of her regular walks to work.I took it as a sign from the universe. Though of what, I’m not entirely sure.IN THE SHADOW OF THE SPOOKSIt seems to me that there is a lot of compatibility between the two theoriesdetailed above, and embracing one does not necessarily negate the other. Paulreturning from obscurity for ‘Let It Be,’ then disappearing again, is consistentwith the notion of twins. Another thing both theories have in common is that, iftrue, it means the colossal array of ‘Paul Is Dead’ clues placed into theBeatles’ recordings, album sleeves, videos and photos over the years, (plus theentire narrative of the ‘Memoirs’ book,) were nothing more than cunning andcalculated misdirection, creating the myth of the 1966 car crash to sendresearchers off down the garden path, and down endless rabbit holes too deep tobe climbed out of again.This would have been a high-level project way beyond the capabilities of fouryoung musicians and their immediate management.Whichever of these theories – if either – is true, it still stacks up to thesame thing. The general public has been monumentally hoaxed for the past fivedecades-plus. And who has the resources and the clout to be able to pull thisoff and keep it under wraps for all this time, if not military intelligence?Mere record labels could not implement a stunt like this without major backingfrom agencies much higher up the Establishment pecking order. Remember that‘Paul McCartney’ was knighted by the Queen, and one of the key reasons for theexistence of MI5 is supposed to be the close vetting of anyone the British RoyalFamily comes into contact with.Even if the Beatles had been able to pull off this stunt themselves, it wouldhave been rumbled at the point where military intelligence officials startedsome in-depth digging. Consider also the incident in January 1980, when‘McCartney’ was detained in Japan after arriving for a tour and being found tohave marijuana in his luggage. There are claims that McCartney’s fingerprintswere taken, but did not match those already held on record, which led to someproblems. He was jailed for three days before some intervention from higher-upsecured his release, and nothing further was heard about it.The only rational conclusion is that the intel agencies knew about the wholeMcCartney deception because they were intimately involved in creating it. Andwhere the fingerprints of military intelligence are found, occult ritualisticelements are rarely far from the surface.As a friend commented to me in private correspondence on the matter:“It’s always good to bring things back to the big picture, because there is ahuge meaning for the replacement in occult circles. The impostor, the fake. Thegrand deception. Laughing at the public as they go crazy and hand over theirmoney. While signing on to a culture that a lot of them will defend with energyand emotional outbursts. And yet, that culture was actually designed by men theyhave never heard of, and who do not have their best interests at heart.“Music and film are designed to affect people’s minds, and they are the productof occult ritual, channelled information, and years of gruesome experiment toreduce these dark arts to scientific principles that can be written in manuals,and handed around to elite circles who hire performers, and learn over decadeshow to place into music (and film), rhythms and tones and sequences of notesthat can programme the human consciousness to think in certain ways, and slowlyself-destruct.”THE PATH TO TRUTHI fully understand how baffling all of the above information will be to readers,because I went through these confounding processes myself. I realise also thatthis book’s title, ‘Musical Truth,’ may suggest that it is offering theindisputable truth behind all matters it discusses. The fact is, no book couldever make so bold a claim. Without being a personal part of the various eventsunder discussion, none of us can say for sure what is the truth in any of thesematters.This is not to say that we shouldn’t at least seek the truth and get as faralong the path to discovering it as we’re able, of course, which is why I feelthe possibilities chronicled above at least deserve being thrown into the mentalblender of any committed truthseeker. Naturally, many theories will come to berejected when subjected to the spotlight of discernment. Each reader formingtheir own conclusions based on what resonates with them personally, is a processwhich needs to happen.The ‘Truth’ part of this book’s title, therefore, can be applied to the factthat no aspect of the corporate music industry is really the way it’s presentedto us with all its glossy packaging, and that there’s always truth waiting to bediscovered by those who dare to embark upon the mission towards finding it.Will we ever get to know the real truth about the McCartney switch, and will thesubject ever get addressed in mainstream society after Faul (and/ or Paul) haspassed, in rather the same way that the full revelations about Jimmy Savile’strue nature only emerged after his death? I wonder if the powers-that-be whoinstigated this whole mess still have a handle on what’s what and who’s who, orif even they have lost track of it all?I know I won’t be alone in wishing I could get my hands on Heather Mills’ “boxof evidence” that she claimed to have stashed away safely somewhere. That surelywould be the Holy Grail of ‘PID’ research."},{"pageContent":"Resources:Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 109 – Ellen Raine – Did Paul Really Die?: * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-109-ellen-raine-did-paul-really-dieGood Vibrations Podcast Episode 096 – Mike Williams – William Shepherd is PaulMcCartney (Part 1): * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-096-mike-williams-pid-p1Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 096 – Mike Williams – William Shepherd is PaulMcCartney (Part 2) * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-096-mike-williams-pid-part-2 [https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-096-mike-williams-pid-part-2]Miles Mathis’ website, from which PDFs of all his articles on McCartney, Lennonand many other subjects can be downloaded: * http://mileswmathis.com/writings.html [http://mileswmathis.com/writings.html]Beatles Rabbit Hole blog – a source of endless fascinating musings on assortedBeatles mysteries: * http://beatlesrabbithole.blogspot.co.uk/ [http://beatlesrabbithole.blogspot.co.uk/]Billyshears.com [http://Billyshears.com], portal for the book ‘The Memoirs ofBilly Shears’ and its derivatives: * http://billyshears.com/ [http://billyshears.com/]Tina Foster’s Plastic Macca blog site:www.plasticmacca.blogspot.com [http://www.plasticmacca.blogspot.com]Watch ‘Let It Be’ film on-line: * https://archive.org/details/LetItBe_724 [https://archive.org/details/LetItBe_724]John Lennon’s ‘Imagine’ movie: John Lennon and George Harrison refer to ‘BeatleEd’ and ‘Beatle Bill’: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS_Ytpn27XQ [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QS_Ytpn27XQ]George Harrison accidentally exposes fake Paul – Josh Reeves: The Spellcastersvolume two teaser * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW28mGCWlNw [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kW28mGCWlNw]FauI McCartney – “I joined The Beatles as an already set-up affair.” * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_YlhJMNAN8 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_YlhJMNAN8]Transcript of Paul McCartney interview with David Frost, April 1964: * http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1964.0415.beatles.html [http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1964.0415.beatles.html]Paul McCartney live Q&A session, April 2017: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBdYplVbDMs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBdYplVbDMs]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9SO IT’S GOODNIGHT FROM ME, AND IT’S GOODNIGHT FROM HIMNavigating the labyrinth of Prince and George Michael death clues.“Some say a man ain’t happy truly until a man truly dies”Prince & The Revolution: ‘Sign O’ The Times’ (1987)“And the wounded skies above say it’s much, much too late,Well, maybe we should all be praying for time.”George Michael: ‘Praying For Time’ (1990)2016 came to be known colloquially as the year of the Celebrity Death Cull.Book-ended by the reported passings of David Bowie in January and George Michaelin December, the year saw the exit of a vast number of celebrities, many of themfrom the music world. There are too many to list in full, but just a few musicaldepartees included Robert Stigwood, Glen Frey, Maurice White, Vanity, PhifeDawg, Billy Paul, Leon Russell, Holly Dunn, Pete Burns, Leonard Cohen and RickParfitt, while Carl Palmer remained the only living member of Emerson, Lake andPalmer when Greg Lake and Keith Emerson both checked out.Inevitably, this led to speculation that some were being deliberately taken outin a series of ritual sacrifices, (numerologists have noted that 216 – 2016minus the redundant zero – equals 6 times 6 times 6,) but equally, that it wasall down to random chance and bad luck. Experience has taught me that it’sunwise to make a blanket statement about all music industry deaths – no matterhow suspicious the circumstances might at first appear – but to examine them ona case-by-case basis ... though there’s no guarantee of coming to a definitiveanswer even after applying the probing spotlight of scrutiny!To dissect each of 2016’s reported celebrity deaths in detail would take anentire book in itself, probably involving several years of thorough research.David Bowie got covered in ‘Musical Truth 1.’ For the purposes of this one,therefore, we’ll look at some of the anomalies and oddities, (for there’s neverany shortage,) of the other two most prominent names.DEATH OF A PRINCESo often it’s not in life, but only after their reported death that a fullappreciation of the complexities of an artist’s character becomes apparent. Thisis especially true in these times of citizen researchers being able to conducttheir own investigations through the opportunities afforded by the internet,rather than having to rely on establishment sources to tell them what happened.The litany of quirks, idiosynchrasies, and character traits associated withPrince which emerged following his reported death on 21st April 2016, wasmatched only by the wealth of discrepancies and contradictions surrounding thenature of the event itself.The first official reports of Prince’s passing, included the detail that he haddied alone in an elevator on his sprawling Paisley Park estate in Chanhassen,just outside his home city of Minneapolis. Paisley Park housed living quartersand studio facilities, as well as acting as the main HQ for Prince’s businessempire. The many symbolic features of its architecture included a rooftoppyramid which would reportedly glow purple to indicate that Prince was present.The elevator detail caused many to recall the lyrics to his 1984 song ‘Let’s GoCrazy,’ where he asks: “are we gonna let the elevator bring us down? Oh, nolet’s go ... ”Dissecting the word etymologically, gives us the prefix ‘el,’ which means ‘God’in Hebrew. To rehash a comment from the occult researcher Jordan Maxwellincluded in the last book: “The god Saturn was referred to as El. If youcontinue today to worship the planet Saturn, you become known as an elder, yougot elected, with elections. Now you’re one of the elites, now you’ve gotelevated.” A short while after the death announcement, the record producer andindustry mogul L.A. Reid, related in an interview how Prince had once asked him,“do you know what the elevator represents?” When Reid said he didn’t, Princereplied, “the devil.”As with the demise of so many celebrities, the ‘official’ cause of Prince’sdeath changed somewhat in the first few days. Some accounts claimed it had beena heart attack, others that he had overdosed on pharmaceutical medication,others that it was heroin. A claim even emerged in the mainstream press that hemay have secretly been battling AIDS and that it finally got the better of him,and another that he succumbed to the Zika virus. Eventually, the cause of deathwas given as an overdose of the painkiller Fentanyl, with the medical examiner’sstatement insisting there were no indications of foul play or suicide.Prince had allegedly been discovered dead in the elevator by the son of Dr.Howard Kornfeld, a physician who had been called by the musician’s concernedstaff requesting medical advice. Prince was 57 years old, a vegan and aJehovah’s Witness, and had apparently been in good physical shape. Attendees ofhis Piano & A Microphone solo concerts in Australia just a few weeks earlier,had spoken of how fit, healthy and of positive spirit he had seemed.The waters get somewhat muddied, however, by reports that Prince’s private jet,returning him home from a rescheduled show in Atlanta on 15th April, was forcedto make an emergency landing, at massive financial cost, at an airport inIllinois when he was suddenly taken ill. It was during his brief hospitalisationbefore his return to Minneapolis, that reports of influenza and dehydrationfirst emerged.Despite the incident, Prince went ahead with a small-scale performance atPaisley Park on Saturday 16th, telling the audience at one point to “wait a fewdays before you waste any prayers.” In the days prior to his death, Prince wasseen shopping at a record store, riding his bicycle around Paisley Park, and, onthe 19th, attended a performance by singer Lizz Wright.A short while before the announcement, the image on Prince’s Twitter page waschanged to an animated picture of him with a third eye in the middle of hisforehead, symbolising his pineal gland having been opened, providing a portal tohigher consciousness. During the same period a message had been posted, (thenquickly deleted,) to Prince’s Instagram page, which stated: “just when U thoughtU were safe.” It turned out to be his last. The accompanying image had Prince’sright eye obscured by darkness.The concept of predictive programming wasn’t far from the surface throughout thedeath narrative, meanwhile. Among the examples identified by vigilantresearchers are the following:An episode of the US TV show ‘Scandal,’ titled ’Til Death Do Us Part,’ shows aposter of Prince on a wall, right next to another promoting ‘Dead Poet’sSociety.’ This particular episode was scheduled for release on 21st April 2016,the very date of Prince’s reported death.An episode of ‘Celebrity Death Match’ from 1998, shows Prince Charles in aboxing ring competing with Prince, on this occasion represented as a lifesizeversion of his obscure symbol. This scene ends with Charles defeating andkilling Prince with a little assistance from his mother, The Queen, (more on hersoon!) who jumps in the ring to help him.This, in turn, brings to mind the 2008 episode of ‘The Simpsons,’ (a show whichhas previous when it comes to foreshadowing,) in which Homer is instructed bymusic industry executives to kill Prince because he wasn’t following orders, andends up strangling the musician with his own guitar.THE MORE YOU KNOW, THE MORE YOU KNOW YOU DON’T KNOWThere are many parallels between Prince’s life and career, and that of MichaelJackson. Both were born in 1958, were child stars, and went on to become thebiggest black music crossover artists of the 1980s, their respective albums‘Purple Rain’ and ‘Thriller’ now consistently cited as the most iconic of thedecade. Both came from poor backgrounds and grew up in homes with abusive anddominant fathers; Prince’s story is documented in the semi-autobiographical‘Purple Rain’ movie. Both complained towards their latter years, of how worldhistory had been re-written by the manipulative powers-that-be.A more sinister element linking the two, meanwhile, is the apparent presence ofdissociative multiple personalities, hinting at trauma-based mind control.Prince has been equally noted for his eccentric behaviours as Michael was,appearing to take on an entirely different identity when performing, as to whenencountered in private. Prince was a master of pseudonyms, recording orsongwriting under alter-egos that included Jamie Starr, Alexander Nevermind,Christopher Tracy, Joey Coco, Spooky Electric, Kat and Camille. It’s been widelyassumed that these are the colourful creations of a wildly creativeimagination ... but have we in fact been witnessing something far moredisturbing the whole while?[../images/00020.jpeg]Prince performs at California’s Coachella festival.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Prince_at_Coachella.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Prince_at_Coachella.jpg]Credit: PennerAnother factor shared with Michael Jackson, (besides an untimely death seeminglyinvolving pharmaceutical meds, that is,) involves Prince’s high-profile legalbattles with the Warner Brothers corporation in the 1990s, over publishing andintellectual rights issues, heavily mirroring Jackson’s ongoing spat with Sony.Prince had battled Warner through lawyers to obtain the ownership of his ownmaster tapes, and after much wrangling, had reportedly achieved a victoryshortly prior to his demise. His fall-out with the label that had put him on themap was what had led to him wearing the word ’slave’ written on his face, inprotest at how the industry treats its artists, and his wish to be known as TheArtist Formerly Known As Prince.’ Commenting at the time, he said:“Prince is the name that my mother gave me at birth. Warner Brothers took thename, trademarked it, and used it as the main marketing tool to promote all ofthe music that I wrote. The company owns the name Prince and all related musicmarketed under Prince. I became merely a pawn used to produce more money forWarner Brothers ... ”Taking things further, Prince then opted to change his artist name to anunpronounceable symbol, its components representing a union of the sacred maleand female principles inherent in nature. Interestingly, the concept of dualitywas represented through his star sign of Gemini, representing twins, and he wasborn in one of the twin cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis. All along, Princehad emphasised both the masculine and feminine elements of his character atdifferent points, swinging from bass-laden deep vocals, to his famous squeakyfalsetto – an androgynous blurring of the genders that pre-dated the systematicTransgender Agenda of the 2010s by decades. As writer Isaac Weishaupt observedin an article on his Illuminati Watcher website:“There could be more behind the LGBT movement than just equal rights if youconsider the beliefs of the secret history of the occult. They believe thathumans were originally androgynous beings, and someday will return to this‘perfected’ state.“ ... We know that there is an attempt at destroying the male-female paradigm inorder to usher in the digital matrix hell through Transhumanism. So maybe thiswas one form of early predictive programming sent to us from Warner Brothers,under the guise of a staged rebellion from this famous musician.”The concept of androgyny is embedded in the figure of Baphomet/ the Goat ofMendes, a favoured motif of satanists and black magick practitioners, as we sawlast time around.MOTIVE FOR A MURDER?The inconsistencies in the mainstream’s reporting, led to the usual suggestionsthat Prince had become the subject of another ritual sacrifice at the hands ofthe music industry’s occult priest class. Considering this notion, there is noshortage of possible motives.In his latter years, Prince appeared to have undergone something of a consciousawakening, (or a breaking-free of his mind-control programming?) He had begunabsorbing the outspoken comments of veteran black comedian-turned-activist DickGregory. (Gregory, as a matter of interest, is credited with having firstpresented the famous ‘Zapruder film’ of the JFK assassination to the Americanpublic, when he and Robert Groden arranged its airing on the ABC TV network inMarch 1975. This prompted Congress to re-open the investigation into thekilling.)In his now-famous interview on Tavis Smiley’s ‘Late Night Show’ in July 2009,Prince spontaneously recalled some of Gregory’s comments regarding thephenomenon of Chemtrails. He also referenced the New World Order plans of theUnited Nations, remarked that humans are all indentured servants and slaves on aplantation, and that the US had eight presidents before George Washington tookoffice in 1789, a fact kept out of the official history books. Discussions ofthis nature by celebrities are few and far between on mainstream TV. Itcertainly seemed as if Prince was going ‘off-script.’ Gregory was subsequentlyasked about his relationship with Prince, whereupon he snapped defensively thathe had never met him, and that he didn’t care to be in the company ofcelebrities.As a clued-up friend of mine commented to me by private e-mail at the time:“Every now and again, a true, creative, visionary maverick comes along, likePrince or David Bowie. The industry will tolerate them as long as they feelthey’re keeping them in line and making billions off them, but when it seemslike they’re going off-script or are no longer of use in that way ... we knowthe rest.”And, as Dick Gregory himself hinted in an interview with the Reel Black YouTubechannel in 2016, the forces that control the industry are the type that willpatiently sit on a grudge for many years before finally acting on it. By thetime they do, any earlier motive will have long faded from the public’s mindset:“Why did they want him dead now? Because the white folks that killed him,they’re not like niggers and ignorant white folk – ‘I’ll kill you,motherfucker!’ They do it ten years later!”Dick Gregory died on 19th August 2017, after being admitted to a Washington DChospital a week earlier with a urinary tract infection. Although he was 84 yearsof age, he had been a natural health food advocate for many decades, and threedays before his death, both Gregory and his son had commented that he was inexcellent shape and was looking forward to coming home.He is said to have died of heart failure. In a dark twist of irony given hislife’s work, his death occurred on World Humanitarian Day. It was also two daysbefore the total solar eclipse that swept across the United States. Theresearcher known as Conspiracy Dude, or CDFury, commented in his video ‘Why TheyKilled Dick Gregory’ that a hospital or a prison are the worst places for agenuine political activist to find themselves in. Links to CDFury’s video, andthe e-book on the death of Dick Gregory which he is making available to hisPatreon subscribers, are in the Resources section at the end of the chapter.Hints that Prince may have had access to inside-knowledge of ‘elite’ plans,meanwhile, had already come in December 1998, when at a concert in Utrecht inthe Netherlands, he had ended the show by saying:“We got one more, then we gotta get out. I gotta go home, y’all. I gotta go hometo America. I gotta go get ready for the bombs. Osama Bin Laden gettin’ ready tobomb, yeah.”Before adding:’’2001 – hit me!”Less than three years later, in September 2001, the events of 9/11 were pinnedby the Bush Administration on (former CIA undercover operative) Osama Bin Laden.A RITUAL TAKE-OUT ... ?Having established many potential motives for a ceremonial slaying, furthersupport for this idea came from the strange circumstances surrounding Prince’spassing.The date given for his death, 21st April, just happened to coincide with the90th birthday of the Queen of England, (Germany really, but you know what Imean.) As the Commonwealth ‘celebrated’ the birthdate of a Monarch, (insertfacepalm meme here,) a Prince died. Poetic symbology. Not only that though, theperiod around 20th April has spawned many death-laden events over the years,including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Waco Texas Massacre, the Columbineschool shooting and the Virginia Tech Massacre, all of which contained hints ofhaving been ritualistic killings.This period turns out to be of great importance in occult tradition. Thethirteen days leading up to 1st May, ‘Walpurgisnacht,’ were marked in theancient world by human sacrifice, often involving fire, to the god known asBa’al. 1st May itself was also known as the festival of Beltane in the PaganGaelic tradition, marking the mid-point between the Spring Equinox and SummerSolstice.21st April saw a number of monuments illuminated in purple, reportedly to‘celebrate’ the Queen’s birthday. The story here, was that that purple had longbeen a colour associated with royalty. Isn’t it interesting that it’s also longheld a connection in the minds of the public to Prince, not least through hissong, album and movie ‘Purple Rain,’ and his nickname of ‘the purple one?’The question has to be considered – as well as referencing the Queen’s birthday,could this purple-fest have also been pre-announcing the imminent death ofPrince which was known to be coming – possibly as a symbolic sacrifice to theQueen? During this period, Greene King, the UK’s largest pub chain, launched apromotional beer brand, ostensibly to mark the royal ‘celebrations’, which itrolled out to all its venues. By way of some inventive wordplay, it was known as‘Purple Reign.’One of the key monuments to have received a purple drenching was Niagara Fallson the US/ Canada border. By way of coincidence (?), it was here that the singerDenise Matthews, better known by her stage name of Vanity, was born in 1959.Vanity went on to become a protégée, and reportedly a love interest of Prince,and her public image was closely associated with him.Vanity died two months before Prince at the age of 57, reportedly of a liverfailure resulting from years of drug abuse. The plot thickens when you learnthat Vanity’s date of death was exactly the same as that of Prince’s mother 14years earlier, 15th February, and that Prince’s father died on the exact sameday as Aaliyah, on 25th August 2001. This was 17 days before the events of 9/11.’17 Days’ was the title of the song which appeared as the B-side to Prince’s‘When Doves Cry.’ ... OR CUNNING HOAX?Every time the suggestion that an artist may have been ritually sacrificedemerges, the counter-claim that their death was in some way a hoax is never farbehind.One clue in particular has been cited for a pre-planned death hoax involvingPrince’s complicity, (perhaps similar to the apparent 9/11 foreshadowing at theUtrecht concert in 1998.) He had long favoured the use of numbers in place ofwords in his song titles, (‘When 2 R In Love,’ ‘Nothing Compares 2 U,’ etc.) Thetrack of interest here is ‘I Would Die 4 U,’ one of the singles from the ‘PurpleRain’ album. Ascribing the numerical value of 21 to the letter U, marking itspoint in the alphabet, the title becomes ‘I Would Die 4 21,’ 4/21 being theUS-format rendering of the date on which he would apparently die, 32 years intothe future, (though it would certainly have been more convincing had the songbeen titled ‘I Will Die 4 U,’ and if it had been Masonic 33 years into thefuture, rather than 32!)Additionally, a YouTube researcher known as MrE, (among others,) claimed thatPrince had ‘returned’ in the form of his sister, Tyka Nelson, who appeared ininterviews and at a Prince memorial event. It was claimed that no publicphotographs exist of the pair together, and that very little can be found by wayof Tyka’s background history.For so much more on Prince’s personas, alter-egos and recurring lyrical themes,do not miss Dan Monroe’s highly comprehensive essay ‘Lovesexy to SpookyElectric,’ situated at the back end of this book.GEORGE MICHAEL: STRANGENESS ABOUNDSUK news bulletins on Christmas Day usually consist of regurgitated parts of theQueen’s Christmas speech, and not a whole lot else. So it was a jarring shock tothe nation when the sudden death of the former Wham! singer-turned successfulsolo artist, aged 53, was announced on the evening of 25th December 2016.(In some interesting links to two other deceased artists, this was ten years tothe day after the death of the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, on Christmas Day2006, amid theories that he was another industry sacrifice who had made a‘crossroads’ type ‘deal with the devil’ in exchange for his long and successfulcareer, and ended up being poisoned in hospital. See the video links in theResources section at the end for some other researchers’ theories on this, plusthe related untimely deaths of soul singers Otis Redding and Sam Cooke.(Additionally, George Michael’s birthday was 25th June, the date in 2009 onwhich Michael Jackson was reported to have died. James Brown, Michael Jacksonand George Michael, now join the ranks of a large number of musicians who havemet sudden deaths on the 25th of the month, others including Aaliyah and Lisa‘Left Eye’ Lopes.)Just as with Jackson himself – and with Prince – there were immediatediscrepancies regarding the cause of George Michael’s death, accounts rangingfrom an overdose of heroin, to complications from pharmaceutical meds, to acardiac arrest. The straightforward account of ‘heart failure’ was the one firstoffered by the mainstream media. This seemed to be a dark twist ofsynchronicity, given that the song with which George was arguably mostassociated was Wham!’s ‘Last Christmas’. What are the chances of a singer bestknown for the line “last Christmas I gave you my heart” dying of heart failureon Christmas Day, suspicious researchers asked?As it is every year, the song had been on constant rotation on radio stationsthroughout December. But on this occasion, it had also featured prominently inthe two most popular British TV soap operas, watched by tens of millions, in thehours leading up to the death announcement.The BBC’s Christmas Eve edition of ‘Eastenders’ featured the return of acharacter who had been killed off years previously. Heather Trott had alwaysbeen an obsessive George Michael fan. Her voice was heard on an old taperecording, on which she states, “we can’t have Christmas without a bit ofGeorge, can we?,” as she proceeds to play ‘Last Christmas.’ As she’s heardasking character Shirley Carter to press play on the tape, Shirley replies,“what did your last slave die of?” Then, on the Christmas Day episode of‘Eastenders,’ Wham!’s ‘Last Christmas’ crops up as the answer to a questioncontained within a Christmas cracker ... before the other characters around thetable learn that every one of their crackers contains the same question. Publandlord Mick Carter then raises a glass “to absent friends.” Quite the‘coincidence.’Over on ITV, meanwhile, ‘Eastenders’ main competitor, ‘Coronation Street,’“unknowingly” (according to the mainstream media accounts,) paid tribute toGeorge, as a choir was heard singing ‘Last Christmas’ accapella-style, in theepisode screened at 8pm on Christmas Day. News bulletins would announce hisdeath very soon afterwards.‘Eastenders’ was still pushing the George references long after his reporteddemise. In May 2017, character Kim Fox is heard singing Wham!’s ‘ClubTropicana,’ and says, ‘love George!’, (as opposed to loved?) Years before,meanwhile, the final episode of BBC1’s fascinating ‘Ashes To Ashes’ drama hadDaniel Mays’ character, (who is implied to be the devil,) listening to ‘ClubTropicana’ in a car and declaring, “I think we should listen to this all the wayback home!’ Of all the pop stars who could have been referenced by these shows,why was it always George Michael?The movie world is laden with George Michael death references, meanwhile,particularly by way of three films released during the year of the CelebrityDeath Cull. ‘Deadpool’ has a storyline involving bets as to which famous peoplewill be the next to die. The film’s main character, Wade ‘Deadpool’ Wilson, isportrayed as a superfan of Wham! Later, George Michael’s ‘Careless Whisper’plays over the closing credits.The musical ‘La La Land,’ which received its theatrical release over theChristmas 2016 period, has a scene where the female lead character yells outGeorge Michael’s name for no apparent reason.The US comedy movie ‘Keanu,’ co-written by one of its actors, Jordan Peele, is areal puzzler. Its central character, Keegan, is portrayed as another obsessiveGeorge Michael fan – a factor at odds with his cool, streetwise persona. Keegansports a George tattoo, complete with a cross on his arm. At one point, Keegantakes a hit from a crack pipe in a club and enters an altered state, the filmimplying he has gone to Heaven. There, he encounters a ghostly apparition ofGeorge Michael as seen in his ‘Faith’ video. The character expresses his thrill,declaring “that’s my favourite fucking song!”George’s manager, Michael Lippman, had struck a deal with the movie makers forfour of George’s songs to be featured in ‘Keanu’s soundtrack. Lippman commentedin an interview: “The way it was described to me was that (George Michael) wasso cool that even drug lords have got a tattoo of him ... they turned Georgeinto a cool badass!” He added later: “It’s great for George and his songs, aspeople become more curious about his music.”Indeed.A short while earlier in 2013, meanwhile, the British drama ‘Having You,’included a scene in a public toilet, (perhaps in a sly throwback to George’sindecency charge of several years earlier,) when a character makes a remarkabout ‘the ghost of George Michael.’ The protagonist remarks, “George Michaelisn’t dead!” To which his friend replies, “really? Are you sure?”The recent exposure of George’s music through film doesn’t even end there. Healso had placements in ‘Zoolander,’ and the Martin Scorsese movie ‘Bleed ForThis.’ A world-weary cynic could be forgiven for thinking massive interest inhis back catalogue was being systematically built up, in the years and monthsleading to his sudden (announced) death.[../images/00021.jpeg]George Michael: An exhaustive influx of references to him and his music appearedin popular culture in the months leading up to his death.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Michael_at_Antwerp_(BRAVO).jpg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Michael_at_Antwerp_]Credit: Yves LorsonWham!’s ‘Choose Life’ slogan of their 1980s heyday, formed the basis of EwanMcGregor’s cutting monologue in the original ‘Trainspotting’ movie. And therewas more of the same with its ’T2’ sequel, yet another film to be released in2016.And just when you think you’ve completed the list, another one always comesalong. 2017’s ‘Atomic Blonde’ has Charlize Theron’s central character preparefor a fight with assailants in her apartment, by playing George Michael’s‘Father Figure’ on her hi-fi. (Note to movie producers; othersinger-songwriters’ music is available.)Something which observers have also found rather strange, was the tribute at theFebruary 2017 Brit Awards (sigilfest) event, which saw George’s former partnerin Wham!, Andrew Ridgeley, make his first public appearance since the 1980s todeliver a reading. A further part of the tribute involved Chris Martin ofColdplay in live performance, while footage of George played on a large screenin the background. At one point in the recital of the song ‘A Different Corner,’a piece of footage of Prince rapidly appears, in which he utters the words‘peace to George Michael.’The film was clearly taken from the period in which Prince had jettisoned hisartist name and had taken to sporting the word ‘slave’ written on his face,(remember the comment “what did your last slave die of?” in the Eastendersepisode?) Some have asked whether this could have been included as a veiledthreat to musicians who speak out about the corrupt nature of the recordcorporations, given that Prince, George Michael and Michael Jackson all fell outvery publicly with their labels, the latter two having both been signed to theSony corporation. It didn’t (seemingly) end pretty for any of them.Alongside his asserting his artistic rights with his record label, GeorgeMichael – like Prince before him – also showed signs of having woken up touncomfortable truths about the world, and took opportunities in interviews toair his views. Most notable was a February 2003 sequence with the BBC’s‘Hardtalk,’ in which he was highly critical of Tony Blair and the engineeredsecond Iraq “War” which was about to be launched. In the same interview, hedescribed the Britpop movement which helped formulate a favourable publicopinion of Blair, as “a load of bollocks to me.”The previous year, George had released the song ‘Shoot The Dog,’ with itsanimated video, as a satirical commentary on George W Bush’s foreign warpolicies, (or, more likely, of those that told him what to do.) Blair isdepicted as Bush’s obedient lapdog, while George’s cartoon self is seen seducingBlair’s wife Cherie. These moves add fuel to both the hoax and the taking-outideas; either fake motives were being set up to give his reported death somecredibility, or he was genuinely becoming a loose cannon who needed to bestopped.FOR F’S SAKEOn to some of the bizarre aspects of George’s death as reported by mainstreammedia, then. His body is said to have been found on Christmas morning by hisboyfriend, Fadi Fawaz, in bed at his home in Goring on Thames, Oxfordshire. Hewas said to have “passed away peacefully,” although, if no-one else was presentat the time, as per the official story, how could this have been known?Fawaz’s account to the police of the circumstances in which he found the bodychanged, according to mainstream reports. He first stated that he had spent theentire Christmas weekend with George at his home, but then changed his story tohaving slept in his car outside the house, and only waking at 11.30am. Whoreally sleeps in their car outside their lover’s house on Christmas Eve, onlywaking halfway through the next day, sceptics asked?Fawaz’s call to emergency services was made around 2pm, despite him claiming tohave found the body over two hours earlier. It remains unclear why he has neverbeen treated as a suspect in the death, therefore, since the police are notknown for their tolerance of being lied to under official questioning. If I, orthe average person reading this book had done the same as Fawaz, it’s a fairlysafe bet we’d have spent the same night in a police cell at the very minimum. Inwhat seems like a rendering of the ‘doublespeak’ straight out of Orwell’s‘1984,’ Thames Valley Police announced they were treating the death as“unexplained, but not suspicious.”Fawaz is a celebrity hairdresser and photographer from Australia, and GeorgeMichael is not the first of his music industry friendships that has ended intragic death. Fawaz is described as having been ‘good friends’ with Boyzonemember Stephen Gately who died in October 2009 when his heart stopped beating,said to be a result of ‘sudden adult death syndrome.’ In 2014, Gately’s familyannounced that they were hiring a private investigator to look afresh into hisdeath, as they still had unanswered questions arising from the official account.(I know how they feel.)George Michael’s cousin Andros Georgiou, told the press that Fawaz was “notreally George’s boyfriend,” that he was not welcome at the funeral, and that thefamily “hate him.” Georgiou expressed further suspicions at the nature ofFawaz’s phone call to the emergency services, saying:“It didn’t make sense when I read the transcript, and I have listened to thecall over and over. Fadi sounded way too calm, when really you’d be hystericaland crying. Also, he said he waited for hours for George to wake up. Really? OnChristmas Day you wait for hours?”Fawaz is said to have entered into a relationship with George shortly after thesinger’s break-up with his previous partner of 13 years, Kenny Goss. Theambiguous nature of Fawaz’s true relationship to George has inevitably led toclaims that he was acting as his mind-control handler, and these suggestionshave been fuelled by a disturbing 2012 picture of the pair together, which waspublished by the ‘Daily Mail’ on-line. In it, George appears to be in a trance,and is being led by the arm by Fawaz. George’s neck appears to show signs of himhaving been garrotted. There’s a link to the picture in the Resources section atthe end.Fawaz told the police his Twitter account had been hacked into, and thatmessages claiming that George had wanted to kill himself, and had finallysucceeded, were not written by him. Fawaz subsequently took up residence inGeorge’s £5 million mansion near London’s Regent’s Park, amid reports of thefamily looking into legal action to get him removed.In July 2017, Fawaz posted a series of Tweets beginning with the crypticmessage: “The truth is yet to be told ... not long now,” and going on to hintthat he was so broke he couldn’t afford water, milk, or to put petrol in hiscar.A coroner’s cause of death was given on 7th March 2017 as, “natural causes asthe result of a dilated cardiomyopathy with a myocarditis and a fatty liver.”NOSTALGICIDEIt could be argued that four of the five very biggest and most successful solopop stars of the 1980s, were Michael Jackson, Prince, George Michael and WhitneyHouston, and that anyone of a certain age who grew up on their sounds, wouldcarry some kind of attachment to their output. All of them exited between theages of 48 and 57. It dealt a devastating blow to the nostalgic musical memoriesof a generation, as the reported deaths of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix, JanisJoplin, Brian Jones and others had done a generation earlier.The fifth and final superstar of the 1980s would be Madonna, (like Prince andMichael Jackson, also born in the midwest region in the Summer of 1958,) wholives on with the nickname ‘the Grand Priestess of the Industry.’POST SCRIPT 1:Chris CornellIt seems a music conspiracy researcher’s job is never done. And so it was that,on the completion of this chapter, news came in of another untimely rock stardeath, replete with the usual elements to suggest that there may be more to knowthan was communicated through the official account. This was the reportedsuicide of former Audioslave and Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell in the earlyhours of 18th May 2017.Cornell was born Christopher Boyle to an Irish father and a Jewish mother, andwas acclaimed as one of the forerunners of the Seattle Grunge scene, alongsideNirvana’s Kurt Cobain. He was found dead in room 1136 of the MGM Grand Hotel inDetroit, shortly after finishing his gig with Soundgarden at the Fox Theatre.(Researchers have noted that 1136 encodes 9/11 when the 3 and 6 are addedtogether, and that ‘Fox” equates to 666 in Gematria.) The coroner’s verdict wasthat he had committed suicide by hanging himself with an exercise belt. Avariety of prescription medications were found in his system.Cornell’s death shares many parallels with that of INXS frontman MichaelHutchence, who is said to have hung himself in a Sydney hotel room almost 20years earlier. There are also similarities to the death of Kurt Cobain, who issaid to have shot himself at his Seattle home in 1994.It’s certainly the case that Cornell had a history of heavy drug and alcoholabuse, and of battling depression, But according to the entertainment portalTMZ, his widow Vicky had spoken of how he had been in a positive frame of mindin the period leading up to his death. An article on TMZ’s website states:“Sources who spoke with Chris’ wife Thursday morning tell TMZ, Vicky Cornellspoke with her husband during soundcheck before he took the stage in Detroit,and after Wednesday night’s show. According to our sources, Vicky says Chris wasnot in any way, shape or form in a suicidal state. She doubled down and saidthere were no signs he was at all depressed.”Vicky seemed to change tack slightly in a subsequent press statement, however:“Many of us who know Chris well noticed that he wasn’t himself during his finalhours, and that something was very off. We have learned from this report thatseveral substances were found in his system. After so many years of sobriety,this moment of terrible judgement seems to have completely impaired and alteredhis state of mind.”(Hutchence, too, is said to have been in good spirits and planning for thefuture the day before he supposedly took his own life, incidentally.)Researchers have pointed to the possible relevance of the video for Cornell’s2015 single ‘Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart,’ as it depicts him with a noosearound his neck about to be hanged. He does, however, survive this scenario inthe video’s narrative. Inevitably, some of the occult symbolism employed bySoundgarden over the years has also come in for scrutiny – not least in thesongs ‘Jesus Christ Pose’ and ‘Black Hole Sun.’POST SCRIPT 2:Chester BenningtonJust over two months after Cornell’s demise, the music world was rocked byanother tragedy involving similar circumstances. Linkin Park lead singer ChesterBennington, was also reported to have committed suicide by hanging, aged 41.This is said to have occurred at his home in Palos Verdes Estates in California,on 20th July 2017. The date just happened to be Chris Cornell’s birthday.Bennington and Cornell were close friends, and had collaborated at gigstogether. Like his friend, Bennington had also struggled with drink and drugproblems, as well as depression. Bennington was named as the godfather toCornell’s son Christopher. Bennington had commented on Cornell’s death onInstagram by stating: “I can’t imagine a world without you in it.”Internet rumours began circulating that both musicians had been looking into‘elite’ pedophile rings connected to the music industry, with the implicationthat this had led to their deaths. This theory has not been substantiated by anyverifiable evidence, however.In Bennington’s case, claims emerged following his death, that he was in factthe illegitimate son of John Podesta, political aide to both Bill and HillaryClinton, and the central figure in the ‘Pizzagate’ allegations of a child sextrafficking network operating out of Washington DC. Certainly, there is morethan a passing resemblance between the two, but no validation of the claims hasemerged. Bennington had revealed that he himself was sexually abused over asix-year period as a child at the hands of an older ‘friend.’"},{"pageContent":"Resources:Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 080 – Esoteric & Occult Aspects of Prince (Part1): * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-080-esoteric-occult-aspects-of-princ [https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-080-esoteric-occult-aspects-of-princ]Good Vibrations Podcast Episode 081 – Esoteric & Occult Aspects of Prince (Part2): * https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-081-esoteric-occult-aspects-of-princ [https://www.spreaker.com/user/markdevlin/gvp-081-esoteric-occult-aspects-of-princ]Celebrity deaths in 2016: * http://fiftiesweb.com/dead/dead-people-2016/ [http://fiftiesweb.com/dead/dead-people-2016/]LA Reid says Prince thought elevators “were the devil,” finds friend’s death‘haunting’: * http://www.etonline.com/news/187280_prince_thought_elevators_were_the_devil_la_reid_says/ [http://www.etonline.com/news/187280_prince_thought_elevators_were_the_devil_la_reid_says/]Illuminati Watcher: Prince and the Illuminati blood sacrifice conspiracy: * http://illuminatiwatcher.com/prince-and-the-illuminati-blood-sacrifice-conspiracy/ [http://illuminatiwatcher.com/prince-and-the-illuminati-blood-sacrifice-conspiracy/]Vigilant Citizen: The end of April: a time of human sacrifice: * https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/the-end-of-april-the-most-magickal-time-of-the-year/ [https://vigilantcitizen.com/latestnews/the-end-of-april-the-most-magickal-time-of-the-year/]BBC: Prince death: Five strange stories about mysterious US musician: * http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36059247 [http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-36059247]MrE’s Youtube videos alleging Prince ‘became’ his sister, Tyka Nelson: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtr1gP1_-n4 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtr1gP1_-n4] * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTptzKMujkU&t=88s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTptzKMujkU&t=88s] * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEP2Qn_53_8&t=320s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEP2Qn_53_8&t=320s] * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWWLTuCXo-k [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWWLTuCXo-k]Prince’s July 2009 interview on The Tavis Smiley Show, Part 1: * http://www.pbs.org/video/1189739252/ [http://www.pbs.org/video/1189739252/]Prince’s baby son reportedly died of natural causes: * http://www.eonline.com/news/34703/prince-s-son-died-of-natural-causes [http://www.eonline.com/news/34703/prince-s-son-died-of-natural-causes]Dick Gregory – “They Killed Prince” (RBTV Exclusive): * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItJO7VOXe8w [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItJO7VOXe8w]CDFury Youtube video: ‘Why They Killed Dick Gregory:’ * http://www.beatsloop.com/video/ZewJrAF6xFc [http://www.beatsloop.com/video/ZewJrAF6xFc]CDFury e-book on the death of Dick Gregory, available to his Patreonsubscribers: * https://www.patreon.com/conspiracydude [https://www.patreon.com/conspiracydude]George Michael hoax – British TV show EastEnders ‘Last Christmas’ predictiveprogramming: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYAARDjBEGc [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYAARDjBEGc]Keanu movie (2016) ‘predicts’ George Michael’s death: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTj4MGNb6U [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3iTj4MGNb6U]Picture of George Michael and Fadi Fawaz – mind control-handler? * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4079644/The-thing-George-Michael-wanted-DIE-Lover-Fadi-Fawaz-says-singer-tried-kill-times-insists-24-7-end.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4079644/The-thing-George-Michael-wanted-DIE-Lover-Fadi-Fawaz-says-singer-tried-kill-times-insists-24-7-end.html]George Michael’s lover Fadi Fawaz reveals the singer died alone after he sleptin his car and denies posting tweets saying the star had tried to kill himselfmany times: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4079644/The-thing-George-Michael-wanted-DIE-Lover-Fadi-Fawaz-says-singer-tried-kill-times-insists-24-7-end.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4079644/The-thing-George-Michael-wanted-DIE-Lover-Fadi-Fawaz-says-singer-tried-kill-times-insists-24-7-end.html]Who is Fadi Fawaz?

The meaning of thevisual motifs contained has been thoroughly documented in the ongoing articleson the Vigilant Citizen website, and any reader as yet unfamiliar with what isbeing conveyed through visuals such as broken mirrors, mutilated dolls, teddybears, Mickey Mouse ears, black and white checkerboard floors, animal skinprint, single eyes and pyramids, is highly encouraged to head on over tohttp://www.vigilantcitizen.com [http://www.vigilantcitizen.com] and take a look,or to absorb some appropriate videos on YouTube before proceeding to thefollowing examples.You can also find a good, concise summary of the main elements contained invideos of this nature on the following link, (or just type ’10 secret mindcontrol symbols in music videos and movies’ into a search engine for short):https://indianinthemachine.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/10-secret-mind-control-symbols-in-music-videos-and-movies/[https://indianinthemachine.wordpress.com/2010/04/05/10-secret-mind-control-symbols-in-music-videos-and-movies/]As I delved further into my own research, I came to realise that this type ofimagery is far from limited to pop promos of the 2000s, but actually goes backmany decades further. For the purpose of this section, I’ve decided to focus ona handful of pop videos from the 1980s to make the point. I’d always consideredthe song lyrics and video imagery of the first half of this decade to be highlyambiguous, and had put it down simply to artistic pretensions. With the researchopportunities now afforded to us by the internet, however – and with newunderstandings of both symbology and the telling backgrounds of many A-listartists – I started looking at the output of those years with fresh eyes,wondering what I could have missed in my naivety.Most of the acts involved are British, (but with a couple of Americans thrown infor good measure,) to further indicate how this agenda of subliminal mindcontrol is truly an international one, with the complicity of a great manyrecord labels and video production companies, and with the same motifs rolledout decade after decade. This will be far from a comprehensive list from the1980s, and I welcome any further suggestions that readers may themselvesidentify, by e-mail to the address at the back of the book.All of the following can be viewed on YouTube. If readers type in the artistname and track title followed by “official video,” these should all be easyenough to find.The name of each video’s director, where it is known, is detailed in each case.A few names take on ‘usual suspect’ status in this regard.ADAM ANTThe videos of Adam Ant, born Stewart Goddard, are a great place at which tostart. Could the lyric “a new Royal Family, a wild nobility, we are the family”in the group’s ‘Kings Of The Wild Frontier,’ have been more of a clue as totheir status as industry ’chosen ones’ than a simple throwaway line? It’scommonly acknowledged that Stewart is a sufferer of bi-polar disorder and othermental health issues, which has been used to explain his sometimes erraticbehaviour and long absences from the public eye. He’s also reported to havesuffered anorexia, and to have attempted suicide.[../images/00022.jpeg]Adam Ant: So much to see, so much to know.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Adam_Ant_at_100_Club.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8b/Adam_Ant_at_100_Club.jpg]Credit: Steve SpeightHe incurred mockery and derision through the mainstream headlines which followedthe January 2002 incident, in which he is said to have pulled out a gun and‘gone beserk’ at the Prince of Wales pub in London’s Kentish Town. He wasforcibly detained at the Royal Free Hospital at this point. Some years before,during his period of living in LA, he was forcibly committed to that city’sunsettling Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, an institution long suspected of being afront for the state-sponsored mind-control programming of celebrities. Duringthis period, he was romantically linked to American actress Heather Graham,whose roles included that of Rollergirl in ‘Boogie Nights.’Adam’s situation is reminiscent of that of Syd Barrett, the original frontman ofPink Floyd, who was axed from the group after only a couple of years due to hismental state. This has always been put down to his heavy use of LSD and otherhallucinogens, with the idea that it destroyed his sanity. Given the widespreadprevalence of programming known to be endemic throughout the entertainmentindustry, however, is it possible that these official accounts are convenientfronts to cover up what happens when mind-control goes wrong? (It’s interestingthat there are more military/ establishment family links with both singers –Adam’s father was in the Royal Air Force, while Syd’s worked as a pathologistinvolved in disease cell research for the University of Cambridge, aninstitution closely linked to the government, and a breeding ground for militaryintelligence operatives.)Syd is said to have become schizophrenic, depressed and socially withdrawn fromlate 1967, at one point going missing for a long weekend and, according tofriends, returning “a completely different person,” with a blank, dead stare andunable to recognise old friends. Syd’s father died at the early age of 52 ofcancer. Syd himself followed suit, aged 60. Was there a hint at what reallyhappened to him from the ‘best of’ album ‘An Introduction To Syd Barrett?’ Thesleeve features Syd in an Eyes Wide Shut-style face mask looking into a mirrorframe with teddy bears scattered around.In a 2010 interview for The Sun, Adam Ant spoke of his mental condition in termswhich could easily be those of a trauma-based mind-control subject:“In the past I’ve been a robot. It’s been an out-of-body experience. Bipolarmeans up and down, and that’s me ... Music has always been the best medication.I was on sodium valproate for seven years ... . I might as well have been dead.”Those who knew him in his younger years, have spoken of how Stewart transformedvery quickly from a quiet, shy boy, to a shock-generating punk. At one point, hehad the word ‘fuck’ carved into his back with a razor blade.The historical record leaves Adam’s father, Alfred Leslie Goddard, with a lessthan noble past. He was jailed for two years in 1987 for sexually preying onyoung runaway boys, and his name cropped up during investigations into analleged Westminster paedophile/ child murder ring in the wake of the JimmySavile scandal, with suggestions that he had been a procurer of child victims.The ‘Daily Mail’ reported in 2015 that Goddard Sr. had been a member of anetwork which included Sidney Cooke, who was later convicted of the sadisticgang rape and killing of a teenage boy. Cooke was also an associate of Savile.At the time, Goddard lived in Pimlico, close to the Dolphin Square apartmentswhere the VIP child abuse ring is said to have been based. Alfred Leslie Goddarddied in 1997 shortly after release from prison, with Adam later claiming ininterview that his father’s jail stint was what shortened his life.Not to leave Adam’s mum out of the picture, meanwhile. She was a seamstress, andonce worked as a domestic cleaner for Norman Hartnell, (who was a Royal dressdesigner to the Queen, the Queen Mother and Wallis Simpson,) and to a Wings-era“Paul McCartney.”The manager of the earliest incarnation of Adam & The Ants was thepreviously-discussed Malcolm McLaren. A key part of Adam’s distinctive image washis wearing of a patch covering one eye, while he would appear infrequently-changing personas in his early heyday – a dandy highwayman, a pirate,a King of the Wild Frontier, etc, all hinting at multiple personalities. Theunsettling video to his solo hit ‘Puss N Boots,’ features depictions ofdissociative mindstates and alternative realities, human/ animal hybrids, andthe wearing of Mickey Mouse ears.Puss In Boots was directed by Mike Mansfield/ Adam Ant.ADAM & THE ANTS: ‘PRINCE CHARMING’Where to start? It’s all there. Mind-control/ duality and Masonic symbolism; ablack and white checkerboard floor; androgyny; multiple personalities as Adammorphs into four famous celebrities in succession at the end; a shatteredmirror; face masks. The video also features British actress Diana Dors who was asex symbol in the 50s and 60s in the same ‘blonde bombshell’ vein as MarilynMonroe. This very distinctive look ties into Beta sex slave programming, anotherfacet of MK-Ultra-style mind control.Directed by Mike Mansfield and Adam Ant.KIM WILDEA consistent face on the 1980s pop scene, and the most successful British femaleartist of that decade, was Kim Wilde. Hers is an interesting background tostudy. Her image has always been fashioned in the same ‘blonde bombshell’iconography, and the title of one her 1980s hit singles was ‘Love Blonde’.Born Kim Smith, she hails from a deep music industry family. Her mother, Joyce,was a performer with the Vernons Girls musical ensemble. Her father, Reg Smith,changed his name to Marty Wilde under the mentorship of producer Larry Parnes inthe late 1950s, when he was marketed for a stint as something of a BritishElvis. Later, Marty inducted Kim into the industry as a singer, along with hisson Ricky, who co-wrote many of her hits. Later, Kim’s younger sister Roxanne,19 years her junior, became a backing singer for Kylie Minogue.Marty is now an MBE. His own father had been a British army officer. Kimsuffered a nervous breakdown shortly after her 30th birthday. After a longperiod out of the public spotlight, she re-appeared as an asset of the BBC,fronting a television gardening show. She co-designed a feature for the RoyalHorticultural Society’s Tatton Flower Show entitled All About Alice, based onLewis Carroll’s Alice stories, (which are known to be mind-control programmingtriggers.) She has also been a public supporter of the LGBT agenda, and of gayrights.There’s lots of interest hidden, (and sometimes not-so-hidden,) in many of Kim’svideos. ‘Chequered Love,’ for instance – with a hint in the title – makesprominent use of black and white duality in the form of a checkerboard design.There’s more of the same on the wall, for some strange reason, during this 1986TV interview with Kim:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuvwYP8BXZw[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuvwYP8BXZw]‘Chequered Love’ was directed by Brian Grant.KIM WILDE: ‘VIEW FROM A BRIDGE’The gems in this one are not contained in the official music video, but inanother promo sequence that was shot specifically for a German TV show called‘Bananas,’ which ran from 1981 to ’84.

In 2017, performingat the age of 56, she released this (poor) re-interpretation of the Steppenwolfclassic, whose video features Masonic black and white checkerboard flooring, (isthere any other kind?) and a leopard, (see Beta sex-slave programming.)Directed by Phil Griffin.TOYAH WILLCOX: ‘I WANT TO BE FREE’Is there a clue in the song title here? Because the video drops more than a fewsubtle hints about trauma-based mind-control experimentation – a dissociativedreamstate reality; erratic behaviour; screaming inside what appears to be amonitored cell, and desperate attempts to escape. The cell appears to be watchedover by a couple of ‘elite’ aristocrat types.TOYAH WILLCOX: ‘BRAVE NEW WORLD’Its title being taken from MK-Ultra architect Aldous Huxley’s portentous 1932‘novel,’ (and guidebook for the incoming New World Order society,) raisesinterest in itself. The video gives us a birthing from primordial waters;multiple personalities; Transhumanism; a dystopian future.[../images/00023.jpeg]Toyah Willcox: Plenty to see here, don’t yet move along.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Toyah.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/Toyah.jpg]Credit: Eddie MallinAnother of Toyah’s popular songs was the deeply bizarre ’Ieya,’ whose lyricsasked the question, “are lasers interfering?” and referenced “Zion” and “theNecronomicon.” The latter is a reference to a compendium of macabre images bythe Swiss artist H.R. Giger, which is said to have influenced the visual tone ofdirector Ridley Scott’s ’Alien.’ Toyah detailed some strange occurrences in thestudio at the time of recording the song, writing in her auto-biography:“The atmosphere in the studio became terrifying. Just like when ‘The Exorcist’was made, things started going wrong. Technical equipment wouldn’t work,arguments would start out of nowhere.”Toyah’s first appearance in the public eye was when she appeared in the BBCSecond City Firsts TV production ‘Glitter’ in 1975, having won the role of Suein an audition contest in her hometown of Birmingham. In the play, herappearance is very ordinary, and a far cry from the punchy ‘Toyah’ persona underwhich she burst forth as a fully-formed pop star a short while later.Wikipedia reports that she was born “with a twisted spine, clawed feet, aclubbed right foot, one leg two inches shorter than the other, and no hipsockets. Because of this she endured years of painful operations andphysiotherapy.” (Otherwise known as trauma?)Toyah has been pictured sporting monster fangs and a Masonic one-eye ring, inanimal print, (see section on Kylie Minogue later in this chapter,) as a demonicalien, wearing pseudo-Egyptian goddess Isis-style garb, flashing the ‘devilhorns’ and Masonic triangle hand signs, making a Masonic ‘hush’ gesture, andwith a Monarch butterfly tattooed over her eyes. She was drawn with wings andholding a severed head on her album ‘Anthem,’ and wearing horns on the cover ofthe follow-up album, ‘Changeling.’ Did I miss anything out? Oh yeah, a favouredearly look involved her wearing black contact lenses to give her eyes a ‘dead,’inhuman look. She went on to marry Robert Fripp of the group King Crimson.The ‘Brave New World’ video was directed by David Mallet.TOYAH WILLCOX: ‘IT’S A MYSTERY’Dystopian future landscapes; hints at psychic powers.VISAGE: ‘MIND OF A TOY’Ever feel like the truth is getting placed in plain sight? As per the songtitle, this one is replete with mind-control programming symbolism, with dollsand toys representing a victim’s lost innocence. Visage frontman Steve Strange,who was a one-time heroin addict and suffered a nervous breakdown, was the sonof a British army paratrooper. He became a prominent promoter in Londonclubland, and died very suddenly in 2015, aged 55, of a heart attack inSharm-El-Sheikh, Egypt.Directed by Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, (formerly of the group 10cc.)DURAN DURAN: ‘UNION OF THE SNAKE’In retrospect, Duran would appear to have been major assets of the Britishindustry machine in the early 1980s, and it remains open to conjecture howcomplicit the members may have personally been in the symbolism that oftensurrounded them. The group named itself after a rogue scientist from the 1968movie ‘Barbarella,’ yet another depiction of a dystopian/ Orwellian futuristsociety.The video to ‘Union Of The Snake’ got a thorough analysis in ‘Musical Truth 1,’containing as it does a secret underground desert base in the style of Nevada’sArea 51, children and human-animal hybrids kept in cages underground, reptilianbeings, and mind-control visual triggers. They sure weren’t backwards in comingforwards on this one. As a nice added touch, the vinyl record sleeve features anominous all-seeing eye.Directed by Simon Milne. Conceived by Russell Mulcahy.DURAN DURAN: ‘IS THERE SOMETHING I SHOULD KNOW?’It’s a good question. A recurring pyramid throughout; sigils; a naked toddler; afractured screen representing a splintered mind-state.Directed by Russell Mulcahy.DURAN DURAN: ‘WILD BOYS’Where to begin? A dystopian future landscape, (because there’s no future otherthan a dystopian one, right?); Transhumanism; mutant cross-breeds. It’s allthere. As Wikipedia’s account of the video’s filming puts it: “John Taylor wasstrapped to the roof of a car suffering a psycho-torture with pictures of hischildhood and early past.”‘The Wild Boys: A Book Of The Dead,’ was the title of a 1971 novel by Beat poetand Punk Rock influencer William Burroughs, and director Russell Mulcahy usedthe overblown Duran video as a teaser and a practice run for a full-lengthfeature film he had hoped to make, but which never came to fruition.Directed by Russell Mulcahy.DAVID BOWIE: ‘ASHES TO ASHES’This will be far from the only Bowie video to justify close analysis, but itserves as a good example of this section’s points. Dreamstates; fractureddissociative realities; clowns; a mental institution; androgyny.Directed by David Bowie and David Mallet.BUCKS FIZZ: ‘THE LAND OF MAKE BELIEVE’Illusory reality; dreamstates, and nods to ‘The Wizard Of Oz,’ (often used as amind-control trigger,) ’Cinderella’ and ‘The Lion, The Witch And The Wardrobe.’BUCKS FIZZ: ‘MY CAMERA NEVER LIES’An all-pervading all-seeing eye right from the start; surveillance; black andwhite duality.ULTRAVOX: ‘VIENNA’Dreamstates and altered realities; an ‘Eyes Wide Shut’-style ‘elite’ party.Directed by Russell Mulcahy.BONNIE TYLER: ‘TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE HEART’Set in an ‘Eyes Wide Shut’-style ‘elite’ mansion, (and filmed at the HollowaySanitorium Victorian Gothic hospital in Surrey); hints at possession; a fullmoon; a child with wings and people flying, representing dissociation; aplethora of doves, (the Babylonian goddess Semiramis, an aspect of the sacredfeminine figure also symbolised by Mary/ Diana/ Britannia/ Isis, etc, isrepresented as a dove,) and a nice Masonic handshake to finish things off.Directed by Russell Mulcahy.QUEEN: ‘RADIO GAGA’Replicating scenes from Fritz Lang’s 1927 ‘Metropolis’ movie, depicting afuturistic city where slaves serve the elite class, (rather like a letter from‘the elites’ to Santa Claus at Christmas.)Directed by David Mallet.RAH BAND: ‘CLOUDS ACROSS THE MOON’It’s more the sleeve to this whimsical futuristic tale created by producerRichard Anthony Hewson, (aka RAH,) which draws the scrutiny here. Certainly, thevideo ties into the technological space-age theme of the song, with talk ofcolonies on the moon, (epic fail!) But this 1985 single’s cover leaves littledoubt as to the credentials of those behind it, showing the moon encased withina pyramid, with a blood-red Saturn hovering ominously overhead.THE SYSTEM: ‘YOU ARE IN MY SYSTEM’This 1982 promo shows that all these interesting signs and symbols are notlimited to any one genre, here making an appearance in the black music/ soul/funk scene. Alongside the band performing against a futurist landscape backdrop,complete with a massive half-globe, and with hints at Transhumanism and splitpersonalities, singer Mic Murphy flashes the industry favourite ‘666’ hand signat the camera three times, (though sceptics would doubtless say that this issimply to emphasise the word ‘oh’, which he is singing each time he makes thesign.) The concept of something being “in my system,” is generally taken torefer to the singer’s love interest ... but could equally be interpreted asdrugs, or some kind of possessive entity.‘You Are In My System’ was later covered by Robert Palmer. On which note ... ROBERT PALMER: ‘ADDICTED TO LOVE’One of the most famous videos of the 80s, with Palmer surrounded by a group ofidentically-dressed, hot-looking girls. Except that their robotic movements andblank stares suggest them be Stepford Wives-style mind-control clones. One ofthe girls, Mak Gilchrist, revealed in an interview with ‘Q’ magazine that sheand her colleagues were instructed to behave “like showroom mannequins.” Lookinginto Palmer’s family background, we find yet another interesting link tomilitary intelligence, his father having been a British naval officer. Palmerhimself joined the dubious ranks of rock stars to suffer early, sudden deaths,when his body was found in a Paris hotel room in 2003 at the age of 54. Thecause of death was given as a cardiac arrest.Directed by Terence Donovan.BILLY IDOL: ‘EYES WITHOUT A FACE’Multiple personalities; one eye; hints at possession; ritual torture; ‘Eyes WideShut’-style masked and robed beings.Directed by David Mallet.IRON MAIDEN: ‘NUMBER OF THE BEAST’The video kinda tells its own story!One video version of Iron Maiden’s ‘The Trooper,’ from 1983, has the groupdeliver the entire song on the ever-popular Masonic checkerboard floor. That’sabout it ... oh, apart from the grinning demonic entity presiding over the wholeperformance, that is.Directed by David Mallet.MADNESS: ‘TOMORROW’S JUST ANOTHER DAY’The second half of the video features the group with spinning umbrellas. Theseare known triggers in mind-control programming, (making the group name ratherappropriate in this case,) and ‘spinning’ is a sensation reported as beingexperienced by victims. The band also appear dressed creepily as animals, (seeStanley Kubrick’s ‘The Shining,’ and accounts of ‘elite’-style sex parties.)It’s interesting that Madness were known by the nickname ‘the nutty boys,’ andthat their self-titled song includes the lyrics “Madness, madness, they call itmadness, I’m about to explain, that someone is losing their brain,” and “I won’tbe the one who’s gonna suffer, you are gonna be the one.”Directed by Dave Robinson.MADNESS: ‘BED AND BREAKFAST MAN’Like the majority of Madness videos, directed by Dave Robinson, and featuringmore mind-control symbolism as the group perform on a Masonic checkerboardfloor, (zzzzzz.)Directed by Dave Robinson.BEE GEES: ‘YOU WIN AGAIN’Taken from an album entitled ‘E.S.P,’ standing for extra-sensory perception. Asigil-fest from start to finish. And none too subtle, either.EURYTHMICS: ‘LOVE IS A STRANGER’Mind-control experimentation. Annie Lennox, (OBE,) was one of the main pushersof androgyny and Transgenderism imagery, (both aspects of intelligenceservices-controlled social engineering,) throughout the 1980s. She also rockedthe closely-cropped blonde hair look mentioned in Chapter 3.Directed by Mike Brady.EURYTHMICS: ‘SWEET DREAMS’Mind-control; androgynous gender-bending; Masonic one-eyes; globe/ NASAindoctrination, as footage of a Saturn V rocket launch is shown on a TV screen.Directed by Chris Ashbrook.EURYTHMICS: ‘SEXCRIME (1984)’The song and video to accompany the film remake of George Orwell’s ‘1984’ novel/instruction manual, released in the very year it was supposed to be prophesying,and depicting a nightmare totalitarian police and surveillance state. Ratherlike the one that’s being rolled out more with every passing month right now,come to think of it.BELINDA CARLISLE: ‘HEAVEN IS A PLACE ON EARTH’Straight from the bat we get a selection of small globes arranged in the form ofa pyramid. The globes then re-appear being clutched by a group of characters increepy face masks. What could be the significance of all these globes in thesemind-control videos, I wonder??? A dizzying, spinning sensation, of the typereported to be experienced by dissociative mind-control victims, (see KylieMinogue section,) is conveyed.Directed by Hollywood actress Diane Keaton (of ‘The Godfather’ fame.)NENA: ‘99 RED BALLOONS’Some analysis of the original promo for this song, from 1984, and its relevanceto other events, came from a very incisive video by the researcher Zod 44 whichyou can view here: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3TQOznid8o [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3TQOznid8o]Many years later, a technofied version of the video and song appeared, (with thelyrics delivered in French and German,) and – surprise surprise – there it allis. Transhumanism; black and white Masonic duality/ mind-control triggers;Orwellian police state; Nena sitting atop a pyramid with a removed capstone amidapocalyptic destruction. Oh, and a nice Chemtrailed sky to top it all off.The updated version is here: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wMeOSED5W8 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wMeOSED5W8]MADONNA: ‘LIKE A VIRGIN’Madonna didn’t earn her nickname of ‘Grand Priestess of the Industry’ fornothing, and entire tomes could be written covering her involvement in occultritual symbolism ... and have been. The video to her ’Like A Prayer,’ (alsodirected by Mary Lambert, whose sister is former US senator Blanche Lincoln ofArkansas, incidentally,) can be endlessly analysed, and even mainstream scholarswith no grounding in truth/ conspiracy issues acknowledge that it’s loaded withspiritual symbology.[../images/00024.jpeg]Madonna, Grand Priestess of the Industry.https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Madonna_-_Rebel_Heart_Tour_-_Antwerp_5.jpg[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/Madonna_-_Rebel_Heart_Tour_-_Antwerp_5.jpg]Credit: Pascal Mannaerts.We’ll just concern ourselves with the prior ‘Like A Virgin,’ therefore. It wasearly days for Madonna, and the video seems to have been part of her industryinduction rituals. In it, she is pursued around the waterways of Venice by alion, (see Beta sex kitten programming,) and by the end, the beau who has beenromancing is seen sporting a creepy lion mask himself. It’s straight out of‘Eyes Wide Shut’ and ‘The Shining’ with reference to ‘elite’ ritual abuse andmind control ... and doing a Google image search with the phrase ‘Rothschildparty 1972’ will bring up a few interesting results.By the following year’s ‘Into The Groove’ video, Masonic symbolism had beenintroduced, in the form of a jacket embroidered with a pyramid, a removedcapstone and an all-seeing eye. Was this symbolising Madonna swiftly moving upthrough the ranks?Directed by Mary Lambert.MADONNA: ‘BORDERLINE’The video begins with Madonna dancing on the street with her friends, when asleazy photographer makes her a job offer, (a metaphor for the way the musicindustry selects its assets?) She is seen posing in his studio, the shotsrendered in black and white to indicate the soullessness of it all. Theinteresting thing about the studio is that it just happens to be adorned withtwo Freemasonic pillars and – you might want to sit down here – a black andwhite checkerboard floor and walls.Directed by Mary Lambert.KATE BUSH: ‘BABOOSHKA’Kate Bush has been one of the most endlessly-fascinating and enigmatic artistsof all time. Her music and look remain utterly unique. But the question has tobe reluctantly asked as to whether she may have been yet another of theindustry’s mind-control subjects? Her father was a doctor, (very littleinformation can be found on-line about his actual work,) which is a commonfactor in test subjects, and Kate’s painfully shy persona is a far cry from theflamboyant charisma with which she ‘comes alive’ during performances.Was the CBE that she received from the Queen in 2013 a symbolic nod for servicesrendered, of a different type the ones we all think? The video to her early song‘Babooshka,’ shows her displaying robotic-like dance moves (programming,) beforemorphing completely from one personality and look to another, along with thebreaking of glass, (symbolising shattered personalities?)Directed by Keith MacMillan.KATE BUSH: ‘THE MAN WITH THE CHILD IN HIS EYES’This promo does not disappoint either, (and yes, I know this was 1978 ratherthan into the 80s, before anyone points it out!) and the song title itself is aneyebrow-raiser when considering ritual abuse and mind-control from an early age.The song begins with the ghostly whispering of “he’s here, he’s here” – as if analter has been brought the fore? The whole video has a surreal, dream-like feelto it, and at one stage, three versions of Kate appear in the same frame.Kate wrote the song when she was 13 years old. In a 2010 ‘Daily Mail’ interview,Steve Blacknall, said to be Kate’s first boyfriend, claimed that he was thelyrical inspiration. At the time he worked as a toilet cleaner in a localhospital, but went on to land a marketing job at Decca Records, and said he hadbecome Kate’s ‘first true love’ by the Spring of 1975.Directed by Keith MacMillan.KATE BUSH: ‘CLOUDBUSTING’A video of a whole different kind accompanied this 1985 outing, filmed at themystical White Horse Hill near Uffington, England. This masterpiece stands as afully-fledged movie in its own right, and indeed, features Hollywood actorDonald Sutherland portraying the suppressed scientist and psychologist WilhelmReich.The film touches on the relationship between Reich and his son, Peter, played byKate, and depicts his orgone energy technology being used for cloud-seeding andweather manipulation, much to the chagrin of some dark suits in government.These are not subjects ordinarily addressed in pop promos! Everyone should watchthis genius video at least once in their lives.Directed by Julian Doyle, with input from Monty Python’s Terry Gilliam.CULTURE CLUB: ‘VICTIMS’Could the title be hinting at the industry’s ever-present MK-Ultra mind-controlprogramme – especially with lyrics like: “The victims we know so well, theyshine in your eyes when they kiss and tell. Strange places we never see, butyou’re always there like a ghost in my dream?” Boy George also makes referenceto his “puppet strings.” It’s probably the case that far more otherwiseambiguous 1980s pop songs than we would ever suspect, are actually revealingveiled secrets, in the same way that so many famous rock songs are said to havebeen written in ‘witch language.’This video features an androgynous globe sigil at the beginning, along withhints at dissociated dreamstates. The video for the group’s breakthrough single,1982’s ‘Do You Really Want To Hurt Me,’ shows George facing courtroom judgementwearing a Jewish Rabbi’s hat, and a long white shirt adorned with Hebrewwriting, apparently spelling out ‘Culture Club.’ In photo shots from the set ofthe video, a ‘Star of David’ symbol, (also the sigil adopted by the Rothschildbloodline,) appears on his shirt.Many years later, an ageing George was pictured with a collage of bizarre imagespainted on to his bald head. Taking centre stage was the same ‘Star of David’/Seal of Solomon symbol. What am I missing here?Directed by Kevin Godley and Lol Creme.STEVE WINWOOD: ‘WHILE YOU SEE A CHANCE’A recurring pyramid. About as subtle as a flying brick. Winwood was a childstar, performing in bands from the age of eight.Directed by Clive Richardson.GARY NUMAN: ‘CARS’Technically from 1979, but still in an early 80s style. It could be said to havebeen ahead of its time, which is what Numan’s whole futurist persona was allabout.He started making music in a Punk and New Wave style, but later became seducedby the electronic Synthpop sound, in which genre he found his success. GaryWebb’s core image very much promoted Transhumanism, (his debut hit was titled‘Are Friends Electric?), even down to his chosen artist name of ‘Numan’ = ‘newman,’ as in one ‘augmented’ by technology.This video runs the full gamut – mirror images; duality; multiple personalities,Masonic black and white duality represented by the keyboard. And to top it alloff, the song is performed from inside a large pyramid structure!Directed by Derek Burbidge.M: ‘POP MUZIK’Back to ’79 for this one, too, but worth mentioning in light of its lyrical hookof “New York, London, Paris, Munich ... ” While it could just be coincidence,alert observers have pointed out that this was the order of major “terror”events which would ensue in the years to come – New York with 9/11, London with7/7, Paris with ... take your pick, and Munich with the shopping mall shootingof 2016, which ended outside a McDonalds displaying its big ‘M’ sign.The lyrics to ‘Pop Muzik’ include “mix me a Molotov,” “wanna be a gunslinger”and make a reference to “infiltration.” Readers must make of it what they will.M was the alias of Robin Scott, who was an early associate of Malcolm McLarenand Vivienne Westwood. M was also the name of James Bond’s boss, of course, in atenuous link back to military intelligence. Robin Scott’s 1980 album was titled‘Official Secrets Act,’ and in the video to ‘Pop Muzik,’ he appears as a spy ofthe film noir genre.Directed by Brian Grant.THE BOOMTOWN RATS: ‘I DON’T LIKE MONDAYS’And just one more from ’79. It’s more about the lyrical theme than thevisuals ... though we do get creepy schoolkids straight out of the movie‘Village of the Damned,’ and Bob Geldof in a black and white chequered jacketfor good measure. Geldof has explained that his writing of the song was inspiredby the shooting spree of 16-year-old Brenda Ann Spencer at a San Diego school inJanuary of 1979. The line, “the silicon chip inside her head gets switched tooverload,” becomes intriguing when you factor in the phenomenon of mind-controlprogramming and the brain implants that are said to be used.The song seemed to foreshadow the spate of school shooting/ “shooting” eventsthat would follow in the intervening years, such as Virginia Tech, Columbine,Dunblane and Sandy Hook.Directed by David Mallet.DEPECHE MODE: ‘ENJOY THE SILENCE’A video which just missed the other end of the 80s, being released at the verystart of 1990, came from British Synthpop heroes Depeche Mode. Although thistrack carried a different official video, an alternative version was recordedfor French TV, which featured the group performing the song atop the South Towerof Manhattan’s World Trade Center. At one point, Dave Gahan sings the lyric,“come crashing in, into my little world.” The towers had a little over elevenand a half years left to stand.YouTube seems to have banned every copy of this video uploaded to its channel on‘copyright’ grounds. I’m sure that’s the only reason and that it’s nothing to dowith the fact that truthseekers are now all over such subjects and starting toask some pertinent questions. It is, however, available to view via Vimeo on thefollowing link: * https://vimeo.com/74354252 [https://vimeo.com/74354252]THOMAS DOLBY: ‘HYPERACTIVE’Obvious mind-control evocations with lyrics like, ‘and they’re messing with mymind ... ripping me apart.” Elements of hypnosis, mind-control triggers and theomnipresent black and white duality are all there, with Dolby also appearing asa creepy ventriloquist’s dummy, hinting at dissociation.Directed by Daniel Kleinman.MR. MISTER: ‘IS IT LOVE?’This was filmed in what looks to be a Rothschild-style country house, but turnsout to be Greystone Mansion and Park in Beverly Hills, and was apparentlysponsored by the Vidal Sassoon brand.It pretty much contains everything you’d expect from a Weekend with the‘Elites.’ The band perform amidst Masonic garb and – would you believe it – ablack and white checkerboard floor!!! The lead female shows signs of being aStepford Wives-style mind control slave, and there are hints at dreamstatedissociation, trauma and ritual sacrifice. Just another day at the office.“PAUL MCCARTNEY” (IT SAYS HERE) & STEVIE WONDER: ‘EBONY & IVORY’Black and white duality; multiple/ shattered personalities.Directed by Barry Myers.MICHAEL JACKSON: ‘BEAT IT’A full analysis of this one came from the researcher Lenon Honor in thefollowing video, demonstrating how it depicts group male masturbation. (The songtitle, seemingly, is no accident.) * https://vimeo.com/100178568 [https://vimeo.com/100178568]Directed by Bob Giraldi.STRAWBERRY SWITCHBLADE: ‘SINCE YESTERDAY’Contains coloured dots of the type reportedly used as mind-control triggers. (Awoman wearing a polka-dot dress is said to have been seen disappearing from thevicinity of Sirhan Sirhan when he is said to have assassinated Senator RobertKennedy in 1968. BBC children’s entertainer Justin Fletcher, in his CBeebiesguise as ‘Mr. Tumble,’ carries a bag with the same design. Fletcher has beenpictured flashing the familiar ‘666’ hand sign.)At some points, the dots appear as Mickey-Mouse-ears behind the girls. In a 2002interview, the group’s Rose McDowall talked about Soft Cell frontman Marc Almondbeing inducted into Anton La Vey’s Church of Satan in the grounds of her house:“ ... Boyd Rice initiated Marc Almond into the Church of Satan in the littlegrotto that’s just a walk down there ... I don’t think the landlord wouldappreciate that!”Boyd Rice is an American experimental sound/ noise musician, and proud socialDarwinist, (an expression of satanism,) who collects Barbie dolls. These aresymbolic of dissociative mind-control programming. Rose stated that herinterpretation of his role in the Church of Satan, was that it was merely allabout doing whatever you want without concern, and that it’s ultimately justharmless and fun.(If readers will allow another couple of related side notes, meanwhile, in 1989,Dave Ball, who had been in Soft Cell alongside Marc Almond, formed the dancemusic act The Grid alongside Richard Norris. The following year the pairreleased the track ‘Origins of Dance,’ featuring the 1960s ‘acid guru’ (and CIAasset) Dr. Timothy Leary, just as the UK’s own acid culture was in full throttlefor a new generation of malleable youths. In 1994. The Grid put out their album‘Evolver,’ which contained a track called ‘Golden Dawn’ in apparent homage tothe one-time leader of that occult mystery school, the omnipresent AleisterCrowley. One of The Grid’s later singles was 1995’s ‘Diablo,’ the Spanish wordfor ‘devil.)Directed by Tim Pope.DEAD OR ALIVE: ‘YOU SPIN ME ROUND’Androgyny; one-eye imagery; hints of Hindu god Vishnu. See following section onKylie Minogue for more on the concept of ‘spinning.’Frontman Pete Burns, whose father was an army soldier and his mother Jewish, hadembodied Transgenderism for years, and had an early gimmick of covering one eyewith a patch. In a similar bizarre ‘coincidence’ to George Michael singing,“Last Christmas I gave you my heart,” and going on to die on Christmas Day ofheart failure, on a track on Dead Or Alive’s second album, ‘Youthquake’, PeteBurns sang, “Get me to the doctor, my heart goes bang, bang, bang, bang,” andwent on to die of a reported cardiac arrest as part of the 2016 celebrity deathpandemic, aged 57.Directed by Vaughan Arnell.DEAD OR ALIVE: ‘IN TOO DEEP’See above, plus human/ fish hybrids.MURRAY HEAD: ‘ONE NIGHT IN BANGKOK’Yet more shenanigans on a black and white checkerboard floor. There’s a fairlycredible excuse for this one, given that the song is taken from the musical‘Chess,’ and the characters are supposed to be on giant chess boards. But eitherway, it’s a continuation of a familiar theme.Directed by David G. Hillier.Over to America for a couple.TONI BASIL: ‘OVER MY HEAD’Dissociation; multiple personalities; altered reality; dreamstate; black andwhite duality, (mind-control trigger designs.) Basil has primarily been a dancechoreographer, and was an actress in a handful of movies, most notably in thehippie/ counter-culture classic ‘Easy Rider.’Directed by Toni Basil and Michelle Simmons.LAURA BRANIGAN: ‘SELF CONTROL’This one deserves an essay all of its own, and got one from Vigilant Citizen,(see link at the end.) It was directed by William Friedkin of ‘The Exorcist’fame, and is as blatant an exposé of ‘elite’ mind control and ritual abuse asit’s possible to get, coming some 15 years before ‘Eyes Wide Shut’ offered manyof the same visual motifs.Branigan died suddenly aged 47 in 2004, from what is said to have been a brainaneurism. It was reported in the media that she had been experiencing headachesfor several weeks.SINEAD O’ CONNOR: ‘TROY’This debut video from 1987 is full of subtle hints towards mind control. Sineadhas talked openly of her battles with mental illness over the years, and hasbeen outspoken about Establishment corruption. Her exposure of paedophiliawithin the Catholic church is reminiscent of the likes of Michael Jackson,George Michael and Prince going “off-script” in their latter years. Theshaven-head look she has always rocked is also a motif closely associated withprogramming.Directed by John Maybury.KYLIE MINOGUEAn artist who emerged in the late 80s, but whose key videos date from lateryears, is Kylie. Her most frequently-pushed image ties very much into the ‘sexkitten’ look prevalent throughout entertainment. This is an aspect of BetaProgramming, where sex slaves are symbolised by animal print designs,representing their sexual, animalistic nature being exploited. (This dynamic wasalluded to in Robin Thicke’s video to his song ’Blurred Lines’, and its lyrics“tried to domesticate you, but you’re an animal, baby, it’s in your nature.”)And does this song’s title refer to a blurring of the lines between reality andmind-dissociation?A Google image search under ‘Kylie Minogue animal print’ brings some rewardingresults in this context. So does substituting Madonna’s name for Kylie’s.Three of Kylie’s song titles evoke aspects of trauma-based mind control. Victimsare said to often experience spinning, dizzying sensations when they dissociatefrom reality, with electro-shock used as an aspect of programming. Were thesefactors being communicated with dark, morbid irony through Kylie’s ‘SpinningAround’ and ‘Shocked’ songs?Brain implants and microchips are also used, (remember fellow ‘blonde bombshell’Britney Spears commenting on “getting these things out of my head” during herfamous hair-shaving incident?) Kylie’s 2000 comeback hit was entitled ‘Can’t GetYou Out Of My Head,’ its video showing a futurist cityscape with dancingStepford Wives-style cyborgs. Kylie becomes dissociated and robot-like herself.‘Can’t Get You Out of My Head’ was directed by Dawn Shadforth.Going back to 1988, finally, the Chris Langman-directed video for Kylie’srendering of ‘The Locomotion,’ sees her and her dance troupe gyrating on – wouldyou believe it – a black and white checkerboard floor. (Note to all videodirectors – other designs of flooring are available.)It could be argued that it’s not as if we haven’t been told, all along, whatwe’ve really been looking at for all these years.HOWARD JONESJust to end this section on a more inspiring note, however, lest I be accused ofwallowing in the dark stuff for too long – perish the though – an artist whosemusic I lapped up in the ‘80s, but whose lyrical themes I’ve only begun toappreciate in recent years, is the English Synthpop soloist Howard Jones.Although the string of hits he scored from 1983 to ’85 appeared, on the surface,to be nothing more than chart-friendly pop songs with catchy hooks, closeexamination of his lyrics reveals some deeply philosophical messages beingsneaked into the listening public’s psyche. It turns out that many of the lyricsfeatured on his breakthrough ‘Human’s Lib’ album were actually penned by aBuddhist practitioner named Bill Bryant, who became something of a mentor toJones. The pair later became estranged, however, and Jones appears to have givenno public recognition to Bryant’s influence on him since.Either way, Jones’ debut ‘New Song’ spoke of the triumphs of individuality –throwing off mental chains and not being led by the crowd. ‘Pearl In The Shell’claimed “the fear goes on,” hinting at a kind of societal mind control. Thealbum track ’Assault And Battery,’ was a sobering commentary on the hypocrisy ofcarnism.Howard’s real gem, however, was the 1984 single ‘Hide And Seek.’ Here, he talkedof the divine Creator wishing to experience itself through All Possibility, andso creating the earthly realm, then splitting itself into individuated units ofconsciousness which forget their true nature, (hide) in order to come and learntheir life lessons, (seek.)‘Agadoo’ it was not."},{"pageContent":"Resources:Daily Mail: Adam Ant’s father dragged into VIP child abuse probe: Alfred LeslieGoddard was jailed for preying on runaway boys nearly 30 years ago: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3215608/Adam-Ant-s-father-dragged-VIP-child-abuse-probe.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3215608/Adam-Ant-s-father-dragged-VIP-child-abuse-probe.html]The transformation of Stewart Goddard into Adam Ant: * http://dangerousminds.net/comments/young_adam_ant_looking_like_a_pretty_punk_rock_adonis [http://dangerousminds.net/comments/young_adam_ant_looking_like_a_pretty_punk_rock_adonis]The Telegraph: Adam Ant in mental ward after gun scare: * http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1381673/Adam-Ant-in-mental-ward-after-gun-scare.html [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1381673/Adam-Ant-in-mental-ward-after-gun-scare.html]Vigilant Citizen analysis of Laura Branigan’s ‘Self Control’ video: * https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/self-control-laura-branigan-creepy-80s-video-mind-control/ [https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/self-control-laura-branigan-creepy-80s-video-mind-control/]Lenon Honor’s analysis of Michael Jackson’s ‘Beat It’ video: * https://vimeo.com/100178568 [https://vimeo.com/100178568]Illuminati Watcher analysis of Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines video: * http://illuminatiwatcher.com/illuminati-symbolism-in-robin-thicke-blurred-lines-music-video/ [http://illuminatiwatcher.com/illuminati-symbolism-in-robin-thicke-blurred-lines-music-video/]Miles W Mathis analysis of Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines video: * http://mileswmathis.com/blurred.pdf [http://mileswmathis.com/blurred.pdf]Occult aspects of Duran Duran’s ‘Wild Boys’ video analysed: * http://www.occulomency.co.uk/duran-duran-video-analysis/ [http://www.occulomency.co.uk/duran-duran-video-analysis/]Culture Club: Behind the Videos: * http://www.boygeorgefever.com/behind_the_videos.html [http://www.boygeorgefever.com/behind_the_videos.html]Complete Strawberry Switchblade interview by subject: * http://www.strawberryswitchblade.net/print.php?section=interviews&item=bysubject [http://www.strawberryswitchblade.net/print.php?section=interviews&item=bysubject]Dazed Digital: The story behind Kate Bush’s Cloudbusting video: * http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/27217/1/the-story-behind-kate-bush-s-cloudbusting-video [http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/27217/1/the-story-behind-kate-bush-s-cloudbusting-video]Daily Mail: I’m The Man With the Child in His Eyes: Kate Bush’s first boyfriendreveals he was the secret inspiration for classic hit: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1314539/The-Man-With-The-Child-In-His-Eyes-Kate-Bush-lover-reveals-classics-secret.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1314539/The-Man-With-The-Child-In-His-Eyes-Kate-Bush-lover-reveals-classics-secret.html]The mysterious lyrics of Howard Jones (and William Bryant:) * http://mineforlife.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/mysterious-lyrics-of-howard-jones.html [http://mineforlife.blogspot.co.uk/2009/06/mysterious-lyrics-of-howard-jones.html]Howard Jones’ ‘Hide and Seek’ lyrics: * http://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/howard+jones/hide+seek_20066159.html [http://www.lyricsfreak.com/h/howard+jones/hide+seek_20066159.html]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11THE FINAL CHAPTER ...

While thiscertainly gives people the opportunity to understand the tactics being usedagainst them – and to make a free-will choice to unplug from their control – thesolutions that humanity ultimately needs to tap into lie beyond this physicalreality. It’s only by addressing things on this basis that long-lasting,wide-reaching change can be affected. And it really can. Like everything inCreation, it’s a choice.I addressed the eternal, universal concepts of Natural Law, (or whatever othername anyone cares to put on it,) in the last book. Humanity remains bound bythis immutable dynamic whether any one individual likes it or not, believes itor not, or chooses to look at it or not. It really doesn’t make a difference. Itgoes on being Truth, and we go on being bound by its tenets either way.A society, ultimately, gets what it deserves, and so the fact that we have amusic industry that should be all about free-spirited creativity and fun, but isin fact controlled at a corporate level by a dark occult priest class, meansthat humanity – collectively – has allowed things to get this bad through itslack of spiritual Care.It’s for the same reason that we live in a reality ruled over by a force of evilin which paedophiles in positions of power go unpunished, bankers enslave uswith imaginary ‘money’ that never existed, and animals suffer all manner ofunspeakable cruelty daily. If the element of Care had been present in line withdeep understandings of the way spiritual laws work, this type of situation couldnever have taken a hold; only one rooted in morality could have done so.FIRST DIVISION: ATTACKERSIt’s becoming clear that there are now three main groups of people in the worldwhen it comes to where the consciousness of humanity is really at.A central tenet of the aforementioned Five Per Cent Nation, (or Allah’s FivePercenters,) is that the worldly population is split into three groups in termsof conscious enlightenment; 85 per cent are in ignorance of all Truth, acontrolling ten per cent seek to keep true knowledge to themselves, to gain atactical advantage over everyone else, and the remaining five per cent are the‘poor righteous teachers,’ who know the truth and seek to enlighten the 85 percent. This dynamic formed the foundation of the Minister LouisFarrakhan-featuring 1992 track ‘The Meaning Of The Five Per Cent’ by BrandNubian.I have my own personal take on this dynamic and the percentages involved.First off, there are those who like to think of themselves as the ‘elite’ class.This is the smallest of the three groupings by number. These are individualswith an advanced understanding of the occult – knowledge of the human psyche andhow it operates, and how it, in turn, interacts with the rest of Creation. Thesepeople have studied the nature of reality, and understand howconsciousness – and the applied Will of the individual – can help shape thereality that is experienced both on an individual, and a collective basis, ifproperly applied.Unfortunately for everyone else, this group is not out for the upliftment andadvancement of all humanity. They do not serve Creation and the force that mostwould refer to as ‘God.’ They are steeped in their own ego-consciousness, andsee themselves as ‘gods,’ and therefore superior to those who do not belong totheir group.This is what lies at the root of satanism, which, in its widest sense, is notabout an entity called ‘the devil,’ or dancing around a fire in robes andsacrificing chickens in forests at three in the morning, but refers to absoluteservice-to-self. Satanism took its name from the Hebrew, (and rendered in Arabicas shatain,) meaning ‘adversary,’ or ‘opposer.’ This infers that it opposes theone true Creator, and the morality of Natural Law. It maintains that theindividual gets to decide their own interpretation of right and wrong, that anyone individual’s take on it is just as valid as the next man’s, and that nothingelse matters but the appeasement of one’s personal wants and desires. Moralrelativism by any other name.The ‘elites’ belonging to this group, believe that only their own kind areworthy of taking on occulted knowledge, and they go to great lengths to keep ordistort truths from those outside of their circle. This group’s arrogance is sodeeply entrenched, that they even believe they will soon find ways of cheatingphysical death by making themselves immortal, which is where the insanity ofTranshumanism and futurism lies, with its ideas of humans being able to uploadtheir consciousness into a computer for later downloading into an upgraded body.This explains their obsession with these methods, and why depictions of them areso frequently encoded into music videos and movies and the like.Most in this group are either primary or secondary psychopaths, and have beensystematically bred to be that way. Their humanity and empathy towards othershas been removed, usually through being subjected to mind-control or SatanicRitual Abuse from early childhood. They remain mentally ill, spirituallycorrupt, and something less than a well-balanced, authentic human being.Only someone of this condition could perpetrate the activities that this classdoes – manipulating wars, devising false-flag ‘terror’ hoaxes, inventing thescams of the cancer industry, establishing the horrors of the meat industry, andso much else – without their conscience troubling them so much that they areincapable of continuing to be a part of it.SECOND DIVISION: DEFENDERSThe second group are increasing in number by the day, and are the real enemiesof the first group. These are individuals who are coming to the sameunderstandings about the nature of self and reality, our true power when ourWill is engaged, and our inherent connectedness back to Creation. These truths,deliberately hidden from the masses, are now being widely understood, largely asa result of the internet. The worldwide web was initially developed as a toolfor data-gathering and surveillance by the ‘elite’ class, but I would suggestthis was their biggest tactical error ever, and that it has backfired on themmajorly in terms of how the public has made it its own to share empoweringinformation widely and quickly.This book would not have been written had the internet not been in place, as Ipersonally would not have gained access to any of the information within it. Thecontrollers will not be able to shut the internet down, or even place majorworldwide restrictions on its usage – much as they might like to – withoutmassive resistance from the general public. There aren’t many things that Ibelieve would galvanise the masses out of their passivity and intorevolution ... but this is one. The generations populating the world today areprivileged to have access to information on a scale never before seen in humanhistory, and the opportunities for the evolution of their souls through takingon these great truths are truly profound.In each case, it is the individual’s free will consciousness that has spurredthem on to embrace the truths to which they have been given access; they couldjust as easily have chosen to ignore it, (see Group 3 below.) As the researcherCrrow777 wrote in his on-line article ‘Woke Up, Got Out Of Bed, Heard The SongsInside My Head’:“The truth hurts – at first. Like anything else, once this knowledge is gained,you can accept it and begin to understand reality, or you can ignore it and goon as you always have. It comes down to choosing to accept your cell,’ orchoosing to change your current situation. After all, the control system can bedescribed as a prison, but it is more accurately viewed as a prison for yourmind. If you become aware you can then begin to seek freedom.”The phrase ‘where there’s a will there’s a way’ didn’t come about by accident.This group’s people are not obsessed with gaining control and power over theirfellow humanity, and have the natural states of empathy, compassion andconscience in their rightful place. Although some will choose to sit on theinformation for their own personal empowerment, most in this number – havingtaken on these new understandings – will feel compelled to share what they havecome to know with everyone they can reach with it. A common criticism of secretsociety and mystery school groups, is that they seek to sequester theirteachings for themselves and to keep them hidden from the ‘profane’ masses, whothey see as unworthy of taking them on. Truth is the gift of Creation to allhumanity. Understanding it is the right of each individual, and no-one has theright to keep it deliberately hidden from others.With Truth comes responsibility, and an individual taking on new understandingsabout the nature of this reality and our place in it, takes on also anobligation to communicate that truth as widely as possible. Never by force, butby using whatever methods they find effective to invite others – through theirown free will – to embrace those same understandings.Many hundreds of thousands are now observing this tenet. This process explainsthe phenomenal growth in human consciousness which is now taking place, (thoughhappening nowhere near as rapidly as it needs to,) as well as the all-outassault by a desperate control system, now using every method at their disposalto halt it and keep the masses wallowing in ignorance.THIRD DIVISION: WANDERERSThe third group is the largest of all, and is in the crosshairs of each of theother two. This group comprises the vast majority of humanity. It is the masseswho are still deeply entrenched in the ignorance of base consciousness. They are‘trapped in the Matrix,’ as the popular truth community phrase goes – living inan illusory world which has been systematically made that way by the ‘elite’controllers, with no comprehension that anything’s amiss.Unless we happen to be born into the world of the ‘elites,’ this is the group weall enter this reality being a part of. Through a programme which starts fromthe moment we leave the womb – through the indoctrination of the ‘education’system, (which teaches only the Establishment’s version of events,) and throughentertainment, popular culture, and a calculatedly deceptive mainstreammedia – we are conditioned to perceive the insanity of this world and the wayit’s been made to be over thousands of years, as ‘normal’.We are taught, as a mass herd, that war, death and suffering are necessary and“just the way it goes.” We’re taught that we need an entity known as‘government,’ (which literally means ‘mind-control’ when you get into theorigins of the word,) to tell us what we can and can’t do, and to punish us ifwe disobey their dictates, because we’re incapable of organising our societieswithout them there to instruct us. We’re taught that billions upon billions ofanimals must meet terrifying and brutal deaths in slaughterhouses because eatingtheir corpses is just ‘normal’ and we can’t live without it. (We can.)We’re taught that there’s no other way to run a financial system other thanhaving cartels of private bankers create imaginary ‘money’ out of thin air, thencharge everyone else interest for its use.We’re taught that millions dying every year of cancer is just another of “thosethings,” and that savage and harsh radiation and drug treatment, (which actuallycauses cancer in itself) is the only way to deal with it, because the natural,plant-based remedies provided by Creation are ‘pseudo-science.’ They must be,because a bunch of men in white coats with letters after their name, who studiedat prestigious schools and so must be so much cleverer than us, tell us so.We’re taught that working all week and paying taxes for 50 years just to be ableto afford to live in the places we call home, (but spend very little timeoccupying because we’re so busy out earning the funds,) and to buy a load of‘stuff’ from a bunch of corporations with tax attached – and raising newgenerations to grow up to do exactly the same – is the ultimate point of life.Then one day we die and go into oblivion, (and our families get taxed just alittle bit more,) and that was it. That was your life. Thanks for coming. Closethe door on the way out.BATTLE OF THE SOULSThe first group have nothing but scathing contempt for those that populate themasses. They see them as base and profane, and wholly deserving of the spiritualdarkness in which they dwell. As the speaker, researcher and activist MarkPassio, a former member of satanic groups before breaking out and committinghimself to conveying liberating truths to the world, has revealed, the darkoccultists refer to the general public as “the unbegun,” or “the dead.” They areseen as nothing more than flesh robots – a walking dead so lost in ignorance andremoved from knowledge of their true spiritual nature, that they have not evenbegun their first baby steps towards true knowledge.And this is the condition in which the few ‘elite’ controllers, working throughtheir networks and groups, want to keep humanity rooted. They feed off thephysical, mental and spiritual slavery of the masses. They need large numbers ofpeople to keep their industries going, and to generate (illusory) profits andinterest for the immoral monetary system which keeps just a few thousand of themin privilege and affluence, and the rest of us as indentured debt slaves.[../images/00025.jpeg]A Wheel of Dharma, a concept representing the governing spiritual laws of allthe universe.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wheel_of_Dharma.svg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wheel_of_Dharma.svg]Credit: DarkEvilLarge numbers of people ‘waking up’ to their true spiritual nature – asindividuated aspects of Creation with infinite power to shape the reality we allwish to experience – is the control system’s worse nightmare. As the latecomedian George Carlin so astutely observed: “They don’t want well-informed,well-educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested inthat.”The last thing the controllers want, is for people in their millions to come toa deep understanding of Natural Law and the Law of Correspondence – that thethoughts, emotions and actions which humans put out into the world come back tous, and that if a society has been manipulated towards adopting a satanicmindset, putting themselves and their own selfish needs before the greater goodof humanity, then the whole of society will experience the results of thatconsciousness reflected back to them in their everyday reality.Death, suffering, hardship, injustice, immorality. Sound familiar at all? It’sunfortunate that individuals who do take a personal responsibility towardsunderstanding spiritual truths and applying them in their life, still have toreap the collective consequences of a society in which the vast majority do not,and therefore cause the negative results of their ignorance to be experienced byall. This process serves as a reminder of the old phrase ‘no man is an island,’and that all humanity remains ultimately connected.The flipside, though, is that if the same society were to come to a deepunderstanding of how, if we were to apply our thoughts, emotions and actionstowards upholding the inherent spiritual rights of all, the whole of thatsociety would experience these collective results instead. This really is thelast truth that a force of malevolent controllers would ever want their humanprey to take deeply within themselves, and it explains why they go to such greatlengths to keep people stupid and docile through the many different methods theyemploy – from brain-eating food and drink additives like Aspartame, to theunseen ocean of unnatural wireless, microwave and electromagnetic frequenciesthat we now bathe in, to chemtrails, to moronic and spirit-sapping TV, movie andpop music – and all points in between.I expanded upon this whole dynamic in the final chapter of ‘Musical Truth 1,’and feel a comment included there from Mark Passio bears some useful repeatingto help illustrate the point:“The solution is so simple. It always has been. Don’t treat others the way youyourself wouldn’t want to be treated. State it that way and it becomes realunambiguous, and so simple that a child could figure it out.“You don’t want to be harmed, defrauded, stolen from, raped, have your rightstaken away? Don’t do that to other people. Period. The end. It’s so simple it’salmost stupid, folks. It can’t get any simpler than that, and yet humanity hasproven we still can’t grasp it, we still can’t understand it, and we want theassociated suffering and death that’s going to come with refusing to live bythat basic rule.”My own take on these concepts was further articulated by the researcher andspiritual scholar Marty Leeds, when he guested on Greg Carlwood’s ‘TheHigherside Chats’ in January 2017:“The Great Creator, The Great Spirit ... didn’t create earth to be a hell! Man,in my opinion, is put here, and we were given this gradation of experience touse our free will and our sovereignty to go through this spectrum ofreality ... “So every single second of every single day, we’re given that choice between theextremes of good and evil. And we have to find balance within this scale. So Ithink, centre-ing the self, (not being self-centred,) is ultimately what thedrama of the human experience is all about.“ ... Throw all the numbers out, throw all the language out, throw all theBibles out, throw all the Qurans out, throw all that shit out. At the end of theday, when you cross the gates of death, your heart’s going to be weighed. Howlight your heart was is what’s going to count. And that, to me, is the trueexperience of God.”THE LAST BARS IN THE PRISONIn the same way that the first group’s very survival depends on keeping thethird group in this state of spiritual imprisonment, so the only hope for thesecond group – and therefore humanity as a whole – is in influencing as many aspossible to snap out of their mind-controlled trance and get on the battlefield.As anyone who has ever engaged in this process will understand – and as many afutile chat thread argument has borne out – it ain’t easy! The mind control of alifetime runs very deep, to the point that most of humanity is engaged in a kindof societal Stockholm Syndrome. Things have been the way they are for solong – and it’s all people have ever understood as ‘normal’ – that many willactually fight to ensure its continuation, and will viciously resist anyone whoattempts to persuade them to change. Why get angry at the evil psychopathsmaking this world a living hell when, you can simply write off the persontelling you about it as ‘crazy?’ No personal responsibility or effort requiredthere, then. Phew, that was close!Most people, it seems, are not of a level of consciousness that allows them toeven envisage any kind of change. At the same time, the satanic mindset has beenso deeply and successfully implanted, that they cannot see beyond their ownindividual and immediate needs, and the personal sacrifices that may be requiredto transform human society into a better version of itself, are too much forthem to consider. It can often seem pointless, therefore, for those who haveresolved to communicate truths. Certainly, it can seem like they are bangingtheir heads against a brick wall with certain individuals who are not having anyof it, and have clearly chosen to live out an entire human lifetime in baseignorance.American writer and broadcaster Sonia Barrett offered some perspectives on thisduring her ‘Good Vibrations’ interview with me:“I think that it really boils down to the journey, the experience, that eachcharacter or individual or being came into this life for. To play the role of acertain character requires certain kinds of experiences ... You either come inas a bit more aware, a bit more awake, or you come in really, what we define asasleep ... And then there are those that go completely against the grain.“Some people get triggered by one thing or another, and they get really curious.And then, you have people who will stone you for trying to wake them up! Theydon’t want to hear it. It’s ‘don’t wake me up, this is the dream I’m having, andI don’t want to know all of that, because it would take me away from whatever mycharacter is right now. If I wake up I can’t play that role I’ve been playing,so leave me alone’!”Just as trying to reach certain individuals is an exercise in futility,therefore, there will be others who will be receptive to new information whichresonates with them, and a new path awaits should the right trigger give themthat initial boost that they need. It’s with people of this status that the realwork lies. Reaching a critical mass of the population who wilfully embrace andapply spiritual truth is something that has to happen sooner rather than later.The question that remains is whether those on the path will succeed ininfluencing the rest of humanity while there’s still time, and before theincreasingly desperate controllers get to put the final bars in place for theNew World Order prison they have planned for us ... and are getting dangerouslyclose to completing.Joe Atwill mused on the crucial nature of time being the deciding factor onepisode 51 of the ‘Unspun’ podcast:“Really, history is hinged on this one moment. We have been under mind control,under fake history, for hundreds of years. The oligarchs are unified; theycontrol the media, they control the financial system, they own the government.But they don’t own the internet, and the citizen researcher is starting to makeinroads into the minds of the population.“And we have a better case to make, because so many people are starting to say,‘well, wait a minute, I’m being poisoned, the democratic elected representativesseem to be working with the banks, not with me. I’m poor every year. My family’sshattered. There’s pornography everywhere. What the hell is going on? ‘Thepopulation is sceptical.“So if the internet stays open another couple of years, I honestly don’t thinkthey’re going to be able to shut it off.”GETTING ON THE PLAYING FIELDWe need more leaders, not followers. If the information in this book has spokento you and inspired you, become a teacher yourself. It’s the Each One Teach Oneprocess. I concur with what Mark Passio has articulated on severaloccasions – that the most satisfying response a researcher can get from alistener or reader of their work is not: “Thank you for what you do. Yourinformation has helped me understand things so much better now,” but: “Thank youfor what you do. Your information has made me realise that I need to get out inthe field myself, and make my own personal contribution, and I will now be doingthat.” For as long as all the work is left to a comparative handful ofindividuals, the transformation that needs to take place will not happen. Wejust don’t have the numbers.As Passio himself put it during his provocatively-titled ‘Fake Ass Christians’presentation in Philadelphia in June 2017:“If the so-called Christians and so-called truth movement focused their grassroots efforts and resources into a worldwide campaign to teach the truth ofuniversal, cosmic, moral Natural Law to everyone ... think how many people couldbe reached with a message of self-improvement, conscience, and freedom. Foreveryone to know the truth of Natural Law will truly make us free.”When I first ‘woke up,’ I was naive enough to assume that, by pooling myconsciousness with other like-minded individuals on the same path, we couldactually shake off the chains of this control system within my lifetime. Gettingdrunk and giddy on well-meaning intent is a common symptom of those firstpiercing the veil of the Matrix. I’ve found, however, that as time goes on, itbrings with it a spiritual maturity and a sense of sober realism, and I’ve cometo realise that, of course, it will take way, way longer than just the next fewdecades to see any real, positive change play out. It’s far more likelythat – if it does happen – it will be many, many generations into the futurebefore the results can be truly felt and enjoyed.For many, therefore, this realisation might make the process of trying to effectchange in this lifetime seem futile. Those of us alive today can expect only tospend the rest of our days toiling away with ever-increasing obstacles placed inour path.The first thing to remember for those of us who have children, however, is thatit’s our descendants – who will carry our DNA and may look just like us – whowill have to live in the nightmare world that’s planned, if those of us who areconscious enough to understand the game, don’t do whatever we can now. What ifour own ancestors had had the opportunities that we now have, but they’dsquandered the chance to do what needed to be done, either through laziness,cowardice, or a sense of “it’s futile, so why even try?” If we and our childrenwere now living a worldwide concentration camp straight out of Orwell’s ‘1984,’in absolute servitude to slavemasters, and with no prospect of ever breakingfree – how would we feel about the generation that could have helped prevent it,but didn’t?In this regard, a truly thought-provoking movie to take in, is 2012’s ‘CloudAtlas’ from the Wachowskis, the same team that brought us the ‘Matrix’ trilogyand ‘V For Vendetta.’ (By way of a caveat, the Wachowskis are industry insiderswho wouldn’t have been allowed to make such high-profile movies if they weren’tplaying the game, and the sex-change operation of Larry to Lara Wachowski,appears to be directly out of the Transgender Agenda 101 handbook. But eitherway, this film – like their others – conveys great spiritual truths, andpresumably the fact that it does, is all part of the ‘Revelation of the Method’which the ‘elites’ seem to feel duty-bound to observe in their variousactivities.)‘Cloud Atlas,’ based on the book by David Mitchell, tells the story of severalcharacters reincarnated through six timelines. The tagline for the movie’spromotion was: “An exploration of how the actions of individual lives impact oneanother in the past, present and future, as one soul is shaped from a killerinto a hero, and an act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire arevolution.” The tagline seems to have been inspired by the celebrated “what wedo in life ripples through eternity” quote from the Roman Emperor MarcusAurelius.The narrative reminds us that the actions we choose to take in one lifetime, canhave ramifications affecting others – and the very course of human historyitself – in either a positive or negative way. By way of example, the characterplayed by Tom Hanks in the first story, is a morally corrupt doctor who seeks topoison his charge and steal his possessions. A couple of generations on, hissoul is already seeking to redeem itself for its past actions, as he has becomea whistleblower revealing secrets about a defective nuclear power plant, whichmay pose grave threats to human life if not heeded. He pays for his good deedsby being assassinated by his enemies.By the final timeframe, much of humanity has gone to live on off-world colonies,(it’s fiction, remember!,) the earth having undergone some unstated disaster,(nuclear, maybe?) which has rendered it largely unfit to live upon. This latestincarnation of Hanks’ soul has to overcome superstitious fear to provide a vitalrole in connecting the remaining human population with the new colonies.The journey of the Hanks character’s soul shows how, through learning from pastmistakes and resolving to redeem them, we can spiritually evolve, and have awide-reaching transformative effect on the shared experience of all. His storyis contrasted with that of favourite Wachowski actor Hugo Weaving. Through thesix timeframes, we see his soul regress through the choices that he makes. Hestarts out as a slave trader, ending up so far devolved, that he’s become somekind of demonic entity and isn’t even human any more. It could have turned outso differently if his free will choices had been better made. But they weren’t,and so it is what it is.I’ve not come across any other story which shines light so well on what oursouls come to this place we call home for – and the way that consequentialismworks – and I recommend at least two or three viewings of ‘Cloud Atlas’ to getthe full impact of its message. I am, however, reminded of the final episode ofthe BBC’s uncharacteristically excellent ‘Ashes To Ashes’ drama, in which theaudience finally discovers that its ragtag mob of troubled cops are in factdead, and have been living in some kind of purgatory between the physical worldand the next. Philip Glenister’s Gene Hunt character reveals that their world is“somewhere we go to sort ourselves out” – a cunning metaphor for the humanexperience, indicating some deep knowledge on the part of the show’s creators.Another great allegory, this one disguised as a mainstream comedy, is the 1993movie ‘Groundhog Day’. A sneering and cynical TV weatherman played by BillMurray, is made to live out the same tedious day over and over, with no escapefrom the cycle until he learns how to improve his relationships with others.There’s little doubt that what the film’s makers were communicating, was how ourown lives are like the day in question, and getting the point of why we’reliving them, is the key to escaping the prison. It’s what Michael Jackson wasreferring to in the lyrical sentiments of his ‘Man In The Mirror.’[../images/00026.jpeg]The Ying Yang symbol, reflecting the intertwined duality of all things in naturehttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_yang.svg[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Yin_yang.svg]Credit: Gregory MaxwellWhether any one individual has children or not, it becomes a moralresponsibility to communicate truth to others once they’ve come to understandit, and to resist evil as far as it’s within their capability to do so. Each ofus is a spirit-soul – an aspect of Creation – before we make the choice, in ourhigher selves, to incarnate into this realm of existence and go through theseexperiences that we call ‘life.’ We forget this fact when we are born, ofcourse, which is all part of the ‘game’ that we consented to participate in. Ifwe remembered, we would not go through the situations our individual soulsneed – usually through several human lifetimes – to evolve and grow.There are factors at play in this reality which contribute to the experiences weundergo. These include the apparent ’physicality’ of matter, the passage of whatwe think of as ‘time’ – and the ageing and eventual death of our bodies that itbrings – our attachment to ego consciousness, the need to eat, drink and sleep,the light and heat of the sun, the dualities of night and day, cold and hot, thefears and phobias we undergo, pain, emotions and even fetishes. None of thesecriteria exist in the spirit realm, but they form a vital infrastructure here,in order that we can be bound by their workings, and therefore gain theexperiences that we need.It is possible to come to this understanding during our lifetimes,however – particularly in the times in which we are living right now. The truthabout all things can now be known by any individual with the mental capacity toprocess the information, and – most importantly – the Will to want to know.This is why, when people first hear that they’re not discovering their truespiritual nature for the first time, but they’re having this higher-self aspecttriggered by remembering who they really are, it resonates so much. Suddenly,the path that we’re meant to be treading during our time here becomes so muchclearer. Those responding to this process find themselves led by intuition, by ahigher knowing of where they’re supposed to be. Intuitive knowing trumpsintellectual and ‘logical’ thought every time, because it represents our directconnection back to Creation.ONE ACT, MANY IMPACTSThe nature of contribution that any one individual can make will differ fromperson to person, of course. Not everyone is cut out to write books and hostradio shows, in the same way that there are so many things that I’m woefullyhopeless at doing, (my house won’t be featured on any DIY TV specials any timesoon, as my wife will wearily confirm, and I won’t be winning any sportingtrophies.) So I don’t waste my time trying to get better at those. I recognisethat my time and resources are best spent on activities to which I feelnaturally drawn. Large numbers of others need to respond to the same calling,and, having understood the nature of the problems that humanity faces, toidentify ways in which they can be an essential cog in the wheel of change.A meme which I created for my public talks a while back, reads: “One personcan’t change the world, but they can be an essential component in the processthat can.”I often expand upon it by asking people to imagine a dejected, disillusionedindividual sitting alone at home, appreciating the world’s problems at the handsof a malevolent control system, but lamenting that: “I’m just one soul. Whatdifference can I possibly make?”Now, picture a million, or ten million, or 100 million other individuals inexactly the same situation, all sitting at home saying the same thing. When younow envisage all these people pooling their positive intent in the samedirection – and instead of regretting their lack of effectiveness, resolving todo whatever they can do to bring about a better existence, regardless of howlittle those around them might seem to be doing – now you have an entirelydifferent potential future waiting to be played out.The Transhumanist/ AI nightmare is the biggest threat facing humanity in thesetimes at the hands of mentally-ill maniacs like Ray Kurzweil and Elon Musk.Those who have pierced the veil and can see this madness for what it truly is,need to extricate themselves from the control system in any way they can. It’ssmall gestures which will lead the way here, such as opting to avoidsurveillance-laden smart phones, smart TVs and smart meters, (or anything elsewith ‘smart’ in the name for that matter,) and choosing the supermarket checkoutstill manned by a human being, rather than the robot self-serve machines.We should use cash rather than electronic currency while we still can. Opting touse old-school paper maps and to keep the skill of navigation alive, over havingGPS systems instruct us in where to go, is another great way of asserting ourindividuality, and of symbolically telling the architects of the would-be AIfuture where they can stick it.Microchips and any kind of bodily implants, however seductively they’remarketed, are a big ‘no’ for anyone vaguely awake and aware. The same goes forhuman health-damaging vaccines. These acts all seem trivial in isolation, butlarge numbers of people making their individual choice not to take them, wouldthrow a major spanner in the works in terms of getting the desired Transhumanistinfrastructure fully in place. We need more spanners.I find it deeply ironic that these very sentiments were articulated by noneother than Mrs. Betty Battenberg, (you know her better as the Queen of England,well, Germany,) during her 2016 Christmas message. You’d struggle to find abetter poster child for this system of human enslavement, so you have to wonderwhether these words were spoken as a form of mockery, or whether it was anotherrendering of ‘placing the truth in plain sight.’ Either way – and I neverthought I’d hear myself saying this – the Queen spoke eternal truth when shestated:“Even with the inspiration of others, it’s understandable that we sometimesthink the world’s problems are so big that we can do little to help. On our own,we cannot end wars or wipe out injustice. But the cumulative impact of thousandsof small acts of goodness can be bigger than we imagine.”(It’s very tempting for me to make further comments about references to ‘wars’and ‘injustice’ coming from the figurehead of an empire with a personal wealthreckoned to be in the trillions ... but I’ll refrain!)Many survivors of near-death experiences, along with spiritual mediums, speak ofthe ‘life review’ which awaits each of us as we exit our bodies at ‘death,’ andgo back to the spirit-source from which we all came. This is where we relive allthe experiences we ever went through during the lifetime that has just passed,all revisited simultaneously, (because there is no passing of ‘time’ outside ofthis realm of existence.) It’s said that we experience the results of the freewill choices we made with regard to our behaviours, from the perspectives ofthose they affected, (because, ultimately, all living things are connected.) Ican’t imagine the life review of a despotic dictator, a murderous eugenicist ora slaughterhouse operative will be much of a picnic in that regard.Keeping this in mind can be very effective in influencing the daily decisionsthat we make, therefore. It can also be challenging to question; if we were to‘die’ unexpectedly this very day and re-experience everything we did with thelife that we just went through – would we be proud of what we did with our timehere? Or would we be filled with regret that we had squandered opportunities,and had spent too much time catering selfishly to our own egos?If we’re honest with ourselves, I feel most of us would gravitate towards thesecond option, I certainly would. Bringing this dynamic to mind every now andagain can be a powerful tool in navigating you back to the path you know youneed to be on, I often find. Though the music style isn’t my cup of tea, thisprocess of considering the net worth of your time on earth is summed upstrikingly in the lyrics to ‘The Ballad of Accounting’ by Ewan MacColl,(Kirsty’s Dad,) and Peggy Seeger. I highly recommend a look at the lyrics, whichcan be viewed in full through the link at the end.THE LAST GENERATIONIt’s very grounding to realise that the generation of adults alive today, is theone which will determine whether humanity gets steered into the nightmare trapthat’s been prepared for it, or whether it will finally take the reins towardsfreedom which remain the alternative option, (but only just.) The analogy Ialways keep in mind is of humankind in a prison cell. The iron door has almostbeen slammed shut, and once it has, it’s game over. There’s still a very smallgap before it gets locked into place, however – just enough to jam a foot in toprevent it from closing completely.Will we jam that foot?We are the last generation to retain some living memory of how things used to bein a time before the digital smart grid and daily Chemtrail bombardments. Oncewe’re gone, that connection back to slightly more sane times goes too, which iswhy so much effort is being invested in mind-controlling today’s young peoplewho will replace the Last Generation. The outstanding YouTube user known as Dayzof Noah, summed up this scenario incisively in the opening lines to his video‘How Media Shaped The Generations: Radio and the Teenager:’“For many years, youth culture creation has been a forerunner in Westerncivilisation engineering. The younger generation of any given time representsthe influential group of the future. Therefore, these generations of youth – inorder to ensure civilisation follows the intended direction – must be, andalways have been, conditioned and inculcated via culture ... ”This is why in the UK, the state broadcasting institution that is the BBC, hasbeen pitching its flagship radio station, Radio 1, at ever younger audiences.Its official remit now states its target audience begins at 15 years of age, andthat, “it should also provide some programming for younger teenagers.” Thestation, working in tandem with other broadcasters such as Kiss FM and CapitalXtra – who, ultimately, are all owned and controlled by a shockingly smallnumber of corporations as a result of many years of consolidation – bombards itsaudience with ‘the official version of everything’ – re-packaging mainstreamnews (lies) for a younger listenership, playing music whose lyrics deal withthemes of cultural debasement, and pushing the latest technological gadgets assomething “great” and aspirational.Considering things this way enforces the crucial importance of what happens inthe next couple of decades. I can’t help recalling the lyrics to Tina Turner’s1985 hit ‘We Don’t Need Another Hero,’ (the video to which, appropriately,depicted a nightmare dystopian landscape as if to emphasise the point!)“We are the children, the last generation ... “And I wonder when we are ever gonna change?”Only those of us alive today can make that decision.Let’s make it a wise one."},{"pageContent":"Resources:The Queen’s Christmas message 2016: full transcript: * http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/watch-queens-annual-christmas-message-9512643 [http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/watch-queens-annual-christmas-message-9512643]Crrow777: Woke up, got out of bed, heard the songs inside my head: * https://www.crrow777radio.com/woke-up-got-out-of-bed-heard-the-songs-inside-my-head/ [https://www.crrow777radio.com/woke-up-got-out-of-bed-heard-the-songs-inside-my-head/]Lyrics to ‘The Ballad of Accounting’ by Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger: * https://genius.com/Ewan-maccoll-and-peggy-seeger-the-ballad-of-accounting-lyrics [https://genius.com/Ewan-maccoll-and-peggy-seeger-the-ballad-of-accounting-lyrics]"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 1LOVESEXY TO SPOOKY ELECTRICSIN, REDEMPTION AND REBIRTH IN THE MUSIC OF PRINCE. AN ESSAY BY DAN MONROE.“That’s when you find out that you’re better off making sure your soul’salright.”Prince: ‘Money Don’t Matter 2 Night’ (1991)The popular music industry’s trend of embracing the signs, symbols and motifs ofancient mystery schools, fraternal orders, or – as dubbed by some – the satanic,has become easy to spot by alternative and mainstream journalists alike. Itsproliferation – so intense and noticeable that it is even self-referenced bythose same artists who, whether seriously or jokingly, align themselves withthese ancient groups and their symbolism – supports the idea that those samegroups are the hidden rulers of world or, somewhat less dramatically, theinfluencers and dictators of society.Another trend which has emerged in the output of popular music, and coincidingwith the rise in occult themes, is the increase in musical, lyrical and visualcontent that displays lewd and lascivious material, hyper-sexualised imagery,and undertones of violence and corruption. Materialistic ideals are also widelypromoted.It could also be argued that contemporary popular music suffers from a lack ofcontextual awareness, in which issues of politics, social injustice, war andterror, are not readily addressed in the way they were so vociferously byartists in the 1960s and ‘70s.To the untrained eye, it appears that some of these themes are relatively newphenomena. But as some researchers have called attention to occult and sexualimagery in music, they have started to revisit music history only to discoverthe same themes recurring – though somewhat more discreetly – in the work ofsome of pop music’s greatest icons.The Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Led Zeppelin have featured prominently instudies of the occult in popular music, and the great icons of the 1980s thatwere Michael Jackson and Madonna, have been dissected for not only what theiroutput indicated, but also their intimate, complex relationships with the musicbusiness itself.Little or nothing has been written about Jackson’s and Madonna’s greatcontemporary rival Prince Rogers Nelson, however.A DYNASTY BEGINSThe prodigal virtuoso signed to Warner Brothers aged just 17, and went on tocreate an incredible catalogue, as well as to become one of the most enigmaticmusical personalities of the last thirty years. He is known not only for thecontent of his music, but for his complex relationship with the industry and thepress.From the peak of his commercial success in the 1980s, when he was arguably oneof the biggest music stars in the world, his notoriety and presence in thepublic consciousness slowly slipped away in the 90s, due to a series ofconflicts with the music industry and his place within it.Notoriously reclusive, there are few of Prince’s opinions on public record, and– as stated by Mica Paris in her narration of the BBC radio bio ‘Prince: APurple Reign’ – to truly understand his world view, you must study his music.This essay seeks to study the music, the imagery and the symbolism of Prince,and to look for clues that might lead to interesting revelations about theinfluence of mystery school teachings on his work. Given Prince’s level of fame,if the arguments for occult influence in the music industry are true, we maywell see it reflected in his work. If not the occult, then we will discuss whatis revealed by Prince’s music, focusing primarily on the period that was thepeak of his commercial and popular success in the 80s.Prince was a man who could well be accused of laying the foundations of thesexual revolution in music that we see today. From his hypersexual lyrics andimagery – in songs, on stage and in music videos – he was chief among theartists cited as the catalyst for the first Parental Advisory stickers on albumcovers. His lyrical content included depictions of oral sex, masturbation,sexually dominant characters both male and female, and even incest, all whilemaintaining a semi-androgynous visage which hinted at homosexuality in bothgenders.Frame that against the backdrop of an increasingly conservative US and Britain,(with both Reagan and Thatcher in charge,) and it’s easy to see why Prince wouldname his 1983 album ‘Controversy.’ There was a contradiction here, wound up inall of the sexual darkness. Proclamations of love and deep spirituality wereresonant in the music, as well as numerous concerns about the state of theworld, and the strong notion that society was on the brink of Apocalypse andself-destruction.Using Prince’s own terminology, he was clearly aware of the antagonisticconflicts within his own music. What is revealed by his output, is an innerconflict between spirituality and love, and the forces of darkness.Like other artists before him, such as George Clinton’s Parliament/ Funkadelic,he created his own personal mythology within his music through 1988’s‘Lovesexy.’ On this album, (which will be discussed in greater detail later), hepresents a spiritual battle between the forces of light -= characterised as theeponymous “Lovesexy” – and the forces of darkness, called ‘Spooky Electric.’ Thecontent serves as the most obvious example of the same battle played out throughhis musical output, both before and after the album. This essay will argue thatthe “battle” was not just an internal personal struggle, but one which heprojected on his understanding of the wider world around him.Prince’s output began in 1978 with the release of his first album, ‘For You,’ acollection of short R&B songs which did not make much of an impact, apart fromdisplaying the exceptional range of Prince’s mastery of musical instruments.However, lurking on the inside sleeve, was the start of a recurrent theme in hisimagery – nudity. There is an image of Prince naked on the bed, his “modesty”covered by a conveniently-placed acoustic guitar. The nudity would be carriedover into his second album, entitled ‘Prince,’ which would present him nakedfrom the waist up, and straddling a white horse with wings.This is most clearly a reference to the Greek mythological character andastrological constellation Pegasus, often associated with aspiration to theheights of accomplishment – certainly something reflective of Prince and hisgoals to ascend to the top of the music industry. It could also be argued,however, that this was merely pretentious imagery chosen by a callow 21-year-olddiscovering his musical and personal identity.Of more interest in terms of his musical content, the album ‘Prince’ wouldindicate his future trademark direction with more sexually-charged lyrics insongs such as ‘I Wanna Be Your Lover’ and ‘Sexy Dancer.’ While these songs seemminor forays into explicit content, the track ‘Bambi’ reveals a darker edge toPrince’s work. Representing the author’s desire to engage in sexual relationswith a lesbian, he argues that Bambi should renounce her sexuality, because onlya man can deliver the sexual satisfaction required.Semi-homophobic attitudes aside, Prince goes further:“Bambi – I know what U need, Bambi – maybe U need 2 bleed.”In a lyric that probably disturbs more in a politically sensitive environment,the suggestion that rough penetrative sex is a cure for female homosexuality,still sits uncomfortably today. It represents a step into an even darker moralabyss that Prince would explore in his next LP.‘Dirty Mind’ is the album that is generally acknowledged to have announced thatPrince was going to be a major musical force. Its unique blend of New Wave andPunk Rock – fused with Prince’s R&B and funk heritage – began to establish hisreputation as a potential ‘next big thing.’It is also Prince’s most controversially-charged album, with lyrics and imageryencompassing a large swathe of taboos. It introduced a political and socialconsciousness in the artist’s work, that would contrast against the darkersexual overtones throughout his first twenty years of recordings.The album cover is one of the most provocative of the period: Prince, dressed ina flasher-style overcoat with bikini brief underwear and thigh-high stockings,is probably the most unsubtle representation of androgyny in music history. Thisblending of the male and female – through costume, appearance, songwriting andsymbolism – is another major theme. The black-and-white colour scheme andbarbed-wire scratching on the front cover, serve to reinforce the punk stylingsof this album.On the inner sleeve, Prince is back on the bed – not naked this time, butequally provocative in the bikini-and-stocking combination. The songs cover amass of lurid material, from the title track, in which the artist simply wantsto take his latest conquest “in his Daddy’s Car”, to ‘When U Were Mine,’ inwhich his lover was so unfaithful that, “she didn’t have the decency to changethe sheets.”Finally, there is the unambiguous ‘Head’, in which Prince steals a bride on herwedding day, ejaculates on her dress, then proceeds to give her oral sex“morning, noon and night.” Prince addresses his most controversial subject in‘Sister,’ however, and suggests the cause of his sexual proclivities:“My sister never made love to anyone else but me,She’s the reason for my sexuality.She showed me where it’s supposed to go, a blow-job doesn’t mean blow,Incest is everything it’s said to be.”While most critics suggest that the material is not auto-biographical, given thepolitical climate of the time, (‘Dirty Mind’ was released the year Ronald Reaganwas elected,) it appears Prince was deliberately positioning himself in acontroversial stance that would antagonise a progressively conservativesociety. Unique to his record deal with Warner Brothers, he had a large amountof control over his output, so the blame for this material seems to sit largelyat the artist’s own feet.However, given that Prince was on the third album in a contract, and had yet todeliver a serious commercial reward, the faith shown in him and his extremes on‘Dirty Mind’ was remarkable. It seems hard to believe that Warners did notunderstand this controversial positioning, and were happy to exploit it and seewhere it would lead.As mentioned, ‘Dirty Mind’ would also mark the start of a nascent political/social commentary in Prince’s work. On the final track, ‘Partyup,’ he argues fora ‘revolutionary rock and roll’, and seems to be arguing against making youngpeople fight for American foreign policy:“They got the draft, uh-huh. I just laugh.Party up. Fightin’ war is a such a fucking bore.Party up.”After all of these lurid encounters, Prince ends the album with the somewhatunder-developed, yet earnest, “you’re gonna have to fight your own damn war,‘cause we don’t wanna fight no more.” As simplistic as the lyric is, it wouldbegin to point to another lyrical direction juxtaposed against the more sexualthemes. Both would be controversial and – given the title of the next album – itseems that Prince was fully aware of the direction he was taking.CULTIVATING CONTROVERSY1982’s ‘Controversy’ saw Prince move away from the raw New Wave rock sound thatdefined ‘Dirty Mind,’ and towards a more electronically funk-focused album,which would remain influential in dance music for years to come. The title tracklaid the foundations for a personal creed; as music critic Paul Gambaccinidescribed in a documentary, “a sort of ‘pan-sexuality.”“I just can’t believe, all the things people say. Controversy.“Am I black or white? Am I straight, or gay? Controversy.”And later in the track:“Listen, people call me rude, I wish we all were nude,I wish there was no black and white, I wish there were no rules.”In the context of occultism, with the last line of this song in mind, it isworth bringing up Aleister Crowley, whose infamy seems intertwined with the fateof late 20th century pop music, and still reverberates to this day. From hisinclusion on the Beatles’ ‘Sgt. Pepper’ album cover, to Jimmy Page of LedZeppelin buying his Scottish house; from David Bowie and Ozzy Osbourne bothdirectly referencing him in song, to the recently (mysteriously) deceasedPeaches Geldof, who claimed membership of the Ordo Templi Orientis mysticalorder which he founded, Crowley has had a strong influence on some of rockmusic’s most famous names.Clearly, Crowley displayed vast interest in the occult teachings and writings ofthe mystery schools, tied into a personal philosophy encompassed by the phrase,“Do what thou wilt.” This ethos, (most recently brought to public attention byJay Z,) summarises another area of Crowley’s lifestyle – his libertine sexualexperimentation of all types, but particularly, sexual ritual or sex magick.Prince’s creed of “I wish there were no rules” best describes his view of sex asa liberating force and, like Crowley, a life philosophy.Indeed, we only have to wait until the next track on ‘Controversy,’ titled‘Sexuality,’ for Prince to clarify this standpoint:“Stand up everybody, this is your life,Let me take you to another world, let me take you tonight.You don’t need no money, you don’t need no clothes, the second coming, anythinggoes.Sexuality is all you’ll ever need, Sexuality, let your body be free.C’mon everybody, yeah, this is your life, I’m talking about a revolution, wegotta organise.We don’t need no segregation, we don’t need no race, New Age revelation, I thinkwe got a case.”In Prince’s world, anything goes via letting your body succumb to its sexualinstincts. But ‘Controversy’ points to the other side of his concerns with theinequality of the world.In ‘Sexuality,’ it is important to pick up on the “New Age revelation.” The NewAge and a new breed leader, are important concepts when looking at the mysteryschools and the occult, both of which deal with the creation of a newworld. Some have argued that this might be a call for a Luciferian worldview –that is, a new world free of religious and social inhibitions – which makes itall the more interesting that Prince would deal with the concept of anAntichrist on the album in the character of Annie Christian. Annie Christian =Antichrist?Prince certainly does not celebrate it, laying the blame for John Lennon’s andRonald Reagan’s shootings, and the deaths of black children in Atlanta in theearly 1980s, on this Annie Christian individual, as well as calling her a“whore, looking for fun.” We certainly see Prince putting some boundaries onwhat type of sexual freedoms are to be approved of, and which are not.Reagan would get a second mention on ‘Controversy’ in the curious period piece‘Ronnie Talk to Russia,’ as Prince begins to expand on the anti-war leaningshinted at on the previous album. He also addresses a subject that would becomevery important on his next album and resonate through his work for years tocome, as he implores Ronnie to talk to Russia “before they blow up the world.”ARMAGEDDON DAWNS‘1999,’ Prince’s fifth studio album, marks a significant change in the artist’sdevelopment for a number of reasons. It becomes his first commercial success,marking his first truly impactful singles and video airplay as the age of MTVarrives. Additionally, it is the first to feature the name of his band theRevolution, the first to feature lyrics on the inner sleeve, and the first whichsees him choose symbolic imagery for the front cover, rather than a picture ofhimself. The title track, probably his most sonically-advanced to date, isostensibly a party song about the end of the millennium, but plays intolong-held fears about the date being associated with the Apocalypse, setting thestage for the ultimate party in the face of impending destruction:“I was dreamin’ when I wrote this, forgive me if it goes astray,But when I woke up this mornin’, could’ve sworn it was Judgement Day.The sky was all purple, there were people runnin’ everywhere,Tryin’ to run from the destruction, you know I didn’t even care.”Prince would also warn us that “we can’t run from revelation,” mixing a biblicalworldview with the fears of mutually-assured destruction. This was a period whenantagonism was growing between the US and USSR after a period of relative ColdWar thawing. This ostensibly Christian worldview was not the first time Princewould introduce a theological perspective to his music. The liner notes from‘Controversy’ onward would “thank God” in the first line of hisacknowledgements. The artist would openly acknowledge his Christian faith until2001, when he was baptised as a Jehovah’s Witness.Much has been made in recent times of the symbols used by music artists,especially when linking occult ideas to the industry. When we examine the coverartwork previous to ‘1999,’ we are treated to a feast of telling imagery.Interestingly, there are several symbols which are indicative of themes whichPrince would explore in later albums, such as the ‘Ban the Bomb’ motif, whichdoes have relevance to ‘1999’ with its apocalyptic themes. This is directlyreferenced in the title track, when a child-like voice wonders “why doeseveryone have a bomb?” There is the sunrise, (the Dawn of a new day,) a ladderto a house in the clouds, and the traditional symbols for male and female – bothseparate and combined – which would become synonymous with the artist from thispoint on, (and an elaborate version of this symbol would represent his name forseveral years.)The other symbol which stands out on the cover – and one to which Prince wouldreturn frequently – is the Eye of Horus. In Egyptian mythology, this isrepresentative of the solar deity in its new-born state at the Dawn, (the originof the word ‘horizon.’)The Eye is one of the most easily-recognised occult symbols, largely through itsplacing atop the pyramid on the reverse of the American dollar bill. It haswidespread use within secret societies, such as Freemasonry and the Order of theGolden Dawn. It is also the symbol of the Bavarian Illuminati, the origin ofmodern-day concepts of “the Illuminati” as a loose term to define a group ofpeople practicing occult knowledge, with an agenda to control the world.Furthermore, it is sometimes referred to as “the All-Seeing Eye,” denotingenlightenment and knowledge, and has astrological significance in thecelebration of the newborn sun within mystery school teachings.Here, on the ‘1999’ cover, it appears twice in the holes of two of the 9s. Itwould be easy to dismiss these symbols as mere artistic egotism, had the artistnot returned to this motif numerous times later in his career, as well as to theconcept of the Dawn imagery.One of the most oft-cited examples of occult influence on recorded music, is theLaw of Reversal, or the use of backwards writing or speech. The phenomenon iswell-known to even casual observers; even so, not much credence is given to itand, when it makes an appearance, it is usually written-off as some sort ofdrug-fuelled foolery.In the world of magickal rites, however, reverse meanings are important forseveral reasons. One is the ability to communicate a message subliminally to thesubconscious mind. Another is to convey an esoteric meaning within an exotericone – usually as a sign of notification to other initiates of the hiddenknowledge. There are two reversals on the cover of ‘1999;’ in the ‘i’ ofPrince’s name is written “and the Revolution” in reverse, marking the firstmention of the band name in any of his work to this point.The second reversal is more telling: when the ‘1999’ album is flipped 180degrees, the 999 in 1999 becomes 666, and the number 1 is capped with a bulboushead which bears a striking resemblance to the male phallus. As with the Eye ofHorus, phallic symbolism is prominent in Egyptian mythology, is representativeof the rays of the sun impregnating the Earth, and is used in a symbolic senseto channel male sexual energy.What does this all mean with regard to Prince’s career? Sceptics are quick toproclaim that apparent occult symbolism used by music artists, amounts tonothing more than coincidence, or a desire for controversy. Is every eye on analbum cover the Eye of Horus, they ask? Does every hand gesture bely thatperson’s involvement in the occult, and so on?It may well be a tough argument to lay every errant symbol at the door ofdeep-rooted occult leanings. But when we start to stack up the motifs and themesrepeated throughout a particular artist’s work – as compared to that of theircontemporaries – important patterns do emerge.So here we have Prince who, in his previous work, had displayed a tendency topush boundaries of a sexual nature, foreshadowing a move to greater sexualexpression throughout the music industry. He also preaches against a certaintype of capitalism, and argues for some sort of “revolution” to coincide withthe Dawn of a “new breed” or “New Age.” Along comes ‘1999’ with its musicalstyles, themes, and sounds formatted for a mainstream audience, in tandem withthe overt display of occult symbols on its cover.This, his most successful record to date, would set the stage for the followingalbum, one which would make Prince a bona-fide world superstar.DEEP PURPLEIt is easy to forget now, 30 years-plus after the fact, how important an album,(and accompanying feature film,) 1984’s ‘Purple Rain’ truly was. After six yearsand six albums, Warner Brothers had their faith in the potential of Princerealised with a record that was a multi-million seller worldwide, and yieldingnumerous number one singles. For a time, Prince was the only artist since theBeatles to hold the number one position for a single, an album and a moviesimultaneously. Grammy Awards and Oscars followed, and Prince became thephenomenon he had always suggested he could be.Though ‘Purple Rain’ is clearly one of Prince’s most commercially-accessiblealbums, fusing a more palatable mainstream sound with his funk roots andelectronic pioneering, it has considerably more lyrical and conceptual depththan ‘1999.’ The opening sermon on ‘Let’s Go Crazy’ set the tone, presenting anargument for a positive, spiritually-charged afterworld that we must bear inmind when the metaphorical “elevator tries 2 bring U down.”‘When Doves Cry’ would become one of Prince’s most famous songs and his first USnumber one single, addressing the consequences of parental influence, andwriting the narrative of the accompanying feature film. However, despite theincreasing maturity in some of the lyrical content, Prince continues hisreckless abandon when pushing the boundaries of sexual exploration – though inarguably a less gratuitous way than encountered in the earlier albums. ‘DarlingNikki’s graphic portrayal of an uninhibited “sex fiend,” who “masturbates with amagazine,” seduces the author, subjecting him to a dark sexual experience:“She took me 2 her castle and I just couldn’t believe my eyes,She had so many vices, everything that money could buy.She said ‘sign ur name on the dotted line,’The lights went out, and Nikki started 2 grind ... ”The song would later achieve infamy at the hands of Tipper Gore, wife of futurepresidential candidate Al Gore. She founded the Parents Music Resource Center,which led to the use of Parental Advisory stickers on album covers, when shecaught her 11-year-old daughter listening to the song. It would later be coveredby many other artists, including the Foo Fighters and “Princess of theIlluminati” Rihanna, on her 2011 tour.There is an interesting post-script to ‘Darling Nikki,’ however, and one whichcould indicate a great many concepts, according to Prince’s sound engineer SusanRogers. On the aforementioned BBC radio documentary ‘Purple Reign,’ sheindicates a desire on the part of Prince to balance the dark with the lightusing the Law of Reversal. The frantic guitar strains at the song’s finale fadeinto eerie wind and rain sounds with a vocal which, it soon becomes clear, is abackwards recording. When reversed, the message reveals itself to be: “Hello,how are you? Fine. Fine, ‘cause I know that the Lord is coming soon, comingsoon, coming soon.”Rogers, (no relation to Prince,) was convinced that this was a purposefulattempt to offset the darkness inherent in the song. When viewed from an occultperspective, though, it becomes more entrancing. First, it’s a piece of recordedmusic tracked backwards, as (it’s argued) Led Zeppelin and the Beatles did with’Stairway to Heaven’ and ‘Strawberry Fields Forever’ respectively. The idea isthat when certain songs are played backwards, they would reveal dark,satanically-inspired messages, and create dissonant and mysterious sounds.Prince turns each concept on its head; he reverses the music, but maintains anangelic, yet eerie sound, followed by a spiritually positive message as thereversal reveals itself. Could this be a statement purposely damning otherartists’ negative uses of the occult?Additionally, the message is concerned with the ‘second coming of Jesus Christ,’which, as we have seen from some of Prince’s earlier work, is tied to hisconcept of the New Age. On the face of it, the Second Coming appears to reflecta distinctly straightforward Christian perspective. When combined with hisearlier themes of a New Age revolution leader, however – plus the Dawn and otherastro-theological hints – perhaps the coming referred to here is the sun bornunder the New Age.This ‘coming’ was also declared as a striking innuendo earlier in ‘Let’s GoCrazy,’ the track closing with the artist breathlessly declaring ‘he is coming,’multiple times. If we suspect that Prince himself did not understand the powerof the hidden message, he confirmed it in one of his few press interviews duringthis period. In ‘Rolling Stone’ magazine, he told Neal Karlen in 1985 that:“I’ve always had hidden messages, and I always will.”The concept of the new leader, the death of the old world, and the Dawn of thenew, would come to a head in the title track of the album, and the one withwhich he is still most closely associated. ‘Purple Rain’ is an eight-minuteguitar-based epic, full of emotive and melancholic chord progressions, andremains one of the most iconic songs of the 1980s. It is also the track thatmost directly references events in the accompanying movie. Indeed, whendiscussing the meaning of the song, the most commonly-held theory is that eachof the verses directly addresses the key relationships of Prince’s character inthe film. The first verse concerns his parents; the second his lover; and thethird, his band, with all of whom he struggles throughout the film, and with allof whom he reconciles through the playing of that song.It is interesting to see another statement making its first appearance onPrince’s sleeve liner notes with ‘Purple Rain.’ At the end of theacknowledgements, he would sign off with the message, ‘May U Live 2 the Dawn,’and would continue to do so until the 1990s.The significance of “the Dawn” is interesting, particularly considering Prince’sgrowing concern with a potential Apocalypse, and earlier calls for “arevolution” and a “new-breed leader.” The Dawn is of significance in Masonic andCommunist writings – especially when one considers the astro-theological rootsof many modern religions, and Christianity in particular.The Dawn that is referred to in such literature, and quite possibly here byPrince, is the Dawn of a New Age, the precessional passing of the sun from oneastrological star sign to another that occurs approximately every 2,160 years.Musicians in the 60s were already suggesting that the ‘Age of Aquarius’ was uponus, and – however trite we may think this ‘New Age’ to be – theastro-theological importance to the occult mystery schools is vast. One suchfraternity is another Crowley-linked society – the Order of the Golden Dawn.It is also significant that the Da’wn of a New Age ties into exotericunderstandings of this Dawn being associated with the end of the world, andnotions of the impending destructive Apocalypse over which Prince seemed toobsess. Indeed, the ‘purple skies’ of ‘1999’ had already set up the associationbetween that colour and the theme of Armageddeon. It seems that the third verseof ‘Purple Rain’ may see Prince leading us into some sort of post-death heavenlystate. If we remain in doubt as to the meaning, then one of the few publicinsights from Prince himself, attributed to him by the ‘New Musical Express,’should elucidate:“When there’s blood in the sky – red and blue = purple. Purple Rain pertains tothe end of the world, and being with the one you love, and letting your faith/God guide you through the Purple Rain.”Ironically, if ‘Purple Rain’ the song is transitioning between the death of anold world and the start of a new, the album would mark a significant turnaroundin Prince’s work. His critics have often remarked that he would ‘reject’ hissuccess from this album onwards, by abandoning the rock-funk fusion so criticalto its success, in favour of alternative styles, including psychedelic, baroque,jazz and R&B.What is more interesting is the framing of his previous thematic concerns –sexual freedoms, apocalyptic fears, the Dawn of a New Age and a new breed – intoa new context: the battle between a darker side, which almost always concernsthe descent into sexual temptation, and a lighter side that is yearning for aspiritual awakening.It is important here to discuss the sigil that has become most associated withPrince. Its earliest incarnation appeared on the ‘1999’ album cover, and itwould retain that format up to 1992’s ‘Love Symbol,’ where it would beembellished to the format with which we are familiar now, and which would standas the artist’s legal name for seven years.It is a combination of the shorthand symbols for the male gender, (a circle witha pointed arrow to the North-East,) and the female, (a circle with an arrowpointing south with a cross at the bottom.) In the Prince version, the arrowpoints South, with the arrow at the bottom and cross in the middle. In anexoteric understanding, the combination of male and female seems an obvious fitwith Prince. His clothes, make-up, singing style and high-heeled boots allembrace the feminine, and some of his most famous songs are about powerfulfemale protagonists, or express curiosity about female perspectives.Prince also dons the guise of the phallic guitar-playing rock-and-rollAlpha-male protagonist – certainly a role he would play in real life, as adisciplined band leader marshalling his musicians to become some of thestrongest live performers of the past 30 years. Yet, his strongest musicalcollaborations would seek direction from female musicians such as Wendy Melvoin,Lisa Coleman, Sheila E and more, having recently recruited an all-female backinggroup, 3rd Eye Girl, (interesting name.)Still, there is more to the ‘love symbol’ thematically than first appears. Themale and female symbols are derived from astrological symbols for the planetsMars and Venus, which are associated with gods in the Roman pantheon, (andfurther back to the Greek and beyond). The male/ Mars symbol has the circleforming a shield and the arrow forming the spear of the God of War. Indeed, waris often symbolised as the ultimate expression of male energy, in its mostdestructive and conquering form. The female symbol is the same as that of theplanet Venus, and is said to represent the beauty of the goddess and aestheticvanity – certainly something in which Prince has also had an interest.But there are many other feminine qualities. She is, after all, the goddess oflove as opposed to war. After ‘Purple Rain’ Prince set about questioning thisconflict.PARADOX CITY‘Around The World In A Day,’ Prince’s critically underwhelming follow-up to‘Purple Rain,’ is often said to have been inspired by psychedelia, most likelydue to the striking cover artwork, best appreciated on the vinyl version. Thisopens into a two-page spread which communicates the themes that Prince wouldcover on the album, (criticism of foreign and social policy in Americasymbolised by a naked black toddler carrying an American flag,) and concernsabout the next generation and Apocalypse:“Jimmy Nothing never went 2 school,They made him pledge allegiance. He said it wasn’t cool.Nothing made Jimmy proud, Now Jimmy lives on a mushroom cloud.”The growing concern with temptation symbolised by the woman in the RaspberryBeret holding a picture of an apple, perhaps represents the Christian attitudethat woman is the progenitor of original sin via Eve’s yielding in the Garden ofEden. On the cover, the ladder sits in a pool and splits into two parts: on theleft side, we see images of a black baby, the raspberry beret, a crying agedperson, and a fighter plane flying overhead: on the right sit a group ofmusicians, some bearing similarities to members of his band.There is also the suit that Prince would don in the video accompanying‘Raspberry Beret.’ Prince’s visage appears top-right, the middle of three robedfigures evoking the Three Wise Men. There is also a Biblical nod to rebirth,with the Noah-inspired doves flying about clear blue skies. Finally, on theleft, the waves are turbulent; on the right, the water is still.The significance of the ladder in the middle, separating the turbulent world oftemptation from Prince’s concept of peace, is made clear in the song of the samename, which tells us that: “Everybody’s looking for the ladder, everybody wantssalvation of the soul.” Prince evangelises, yet states that the road tosalvation will be hard. But ‘The Ladder’ is followed by a song called‘Temptation,’ which, despite its carnival feel, is profound in its expressedguilt over a descent into the dark side symbolised by sex, temptation and lust:“Everybody on this earth has got a vice, and mine, little darlin’, mine is theopposite of ice.Mine is the running hot water of the daughter of morality,In other words, this little Prince thinks a lot about U, see?Baby, baby, baby, I’m guilty in the first degree.”Sexual guilt and subsequent punishment would inspire his next project. Musicallyspeaking, if ‘Around The World In A Day’ marked a departure in style from‘Purple Rain,’ then ‘Parade’ went even further. Indeed, to release what isessentially a European-inspired baroque jazz-funk album, is a risk for anymainstream American artist. Thematically, the album seems at first to lack anymajor theme. But when Prince’s second film project, (of which ‘Parade’ formedthe basis of the soundtrack,) is considered, guilt and punishment for sexual sinbecomes evident.‘Under the Cherry Moon,’ despite its lighthearted campy feel, tells the story ofChristopher Tracy, a gigolo servicing the South of France’s monied widows. In anattempt to make it big, he and his accomplice decide to seduce, and hopefullywed, the heiress of a huge financial dynasty. While the seduction is successful,Prince’s character falls in love with the heiress and risks it all to rescue herfrom the clutches of an overbearing father, who orders, in a rather severereaction, the execution of the gigolo. He dies under the moonlight.If the plotline sounds glib and corny, it’s because it is. However, itunderlines a certain development in Prince’s thinking at the time. His characteris the ultimate representation of sexual avarice, coupled with a desire for thealmighty dollar. In Prince’s mind, despite being redeemed by his romanticrealisation, he is still sinning. According to Prince biographer Matt Thorne,there was an alternative ending in which the character survived, which was morepopular with the crew and the studio. But Prince – with full creative control –insisted on the character’s death, which only reinforces that theme’s importanceto him.There are two songs on the album with the theme of death: ‘Sometimes It Snows inApril’ is the funeral lament to Prince’s film character: “Tracy died soon aftera long-fought civil war.” There is also the title track to the film, ‘Under theCherry Moon’: “If nobody thrills me or kills me soon, I’ll die in your armsunder the cherry moon.”This could be a reference to the Blood Moon, which has different meanings inancient traditions. For the Pagans, it is often associated with the time ofharvest, but in the Bible, (which Prince is much more likely to reference,)there is the Blood Moon prophesied by certain Christian ministers, involvingfour consecutive lunar eclipses, during which the moon will turn red. This issaid to foreshadow the final Battle of Armageddon.Given Prince’s previous intimations of the end of the world, this is aninteresting coincidence. He also appears in black-and-white on the album coverand in the film, which, again, could be symbolic of the theme of death. Theartist is now beginning to seriously question his role as the pan-sexualviolator in his early career and, with ‘Parade,’ it seems he is acknowledginghis own guilt.‘Parade’ would not only express the thematic death of one of Prince’salter-egos, but would also mark the death of his most important musicalcollaboration. At the end of 1986, while preparing material for the nextproject, he disbanded the Revolution, and in the process, cut ties with some ofhis oldest musical collaborators, including Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman.Whether Prince anticipated it or not, the Dawn of a New Age of music was nigh,with Hip-Hop bubbling under the surface and about to explode. His initialreaction to these changing times, was to return to a multi-instrumental soloapproach on the double-album ‘Sign O’ The Times.’Often lauded as his greatest work, and a regular amongst 100 Greatest Albumpolls, this LP marked the beginning of a new era. Michaelangelo Matos describedit as: “The last classic R&B album prior to Hip-Hop’s takeover of black music,and the final four-sided blockbuster of the vinyl era.”Certainly, ‘Sign O’ The Times’ marks Prince’s return to the popular black musicstyles he had often put to the side in his quest for superstardom. The JamesBrown groove of ‘Housequake,’ the Parliament-style party funk of ‘It’s Gonna Bea Beautiful Night,’ echoes of Stevie Wonder in ‘Strange Relationship,’ classicsoul ballads like ‘Adore’ and ‘Slow Love,’ all embrace the styles of his musicalforebears in the R&B genre.Thematically, the songs cover much ground. But the title track is as explicit anembodiment of Prince’s social and political commentary as you will find in anyof his songs. The AIDS epidemic, young gang warfare, poverty versus plenty, andthe drugs war all feature in the commentary. The most striking verse and chorusecho a familiar theme in his work, however, augmented by the Campaign forNuclear Disarmament’s ‘Ban the Bomb’ symbol as a replacement for the ‘O’ in thealbum title.“Baby make a speech, Star Wars fly, Neighbours just shine it on,But if a night falls and a bomb falls, will anybody see the dawn?”The Apocalypse and the dawn feature here. But Prince seems pessimistic. Whereasin earlier songs, the Apocalypse was the inevitable turbulence before the startof the New Age, here, there doesn’t seem much hope for anyone.Later in the album, though, Prince would analyse the world again from areligious perspective in ‘The Cross’: “He is coming” presages a New Age with thesecond coming of Christ. Indeed, on the sleeve notes, we are left with the finalmessage that, “soon the boat will sail and take us all away.”Prince has not yet abandoned the sexual indulgences he has been battling for thelast two albums. The straight-to-the-point ‘It,’ simply describes how he stilllikes “to do it all the time,” while ‘Hot Thing’ charts the seduction of a21-year-old girl, cynically recommending, “you should give your folks a call andtell them you’re coming home late ... if you are coming home at all.” This isstill 1987, and a long time before Britney Spears would sell the schoolgirl as asex object. So while seducing a 21-year-old seems tame by contemporarystandards, the implied sexual predation and the explicit threat to parents,could be seen as unsettling to a mid-1980s audience.As he did with previous albums, Prince would then close off his voyage intotemptation with one of his most overt songs regarding lasting commitment in arelationship. He seems to be evoking a change in direction and feeling – notjust in his relationships, but in his music as well, in the song ‘Forever in MyLife.’:“There comes a time in every man’s life, when he gets tired of fooling around,Juggling hearts in a three-ring circus, some day will drive your body down tothe ground.”So, at the end of ‘Sign O’ The Times,’ it seems Prince is ready to settle down.In many ways, he has grown from a youthful lothario tearing down sexual andgender barriers and screaming for revolution, to a politically-aware,introspective man. He is on his way to some sort of personal redemption.However, things would become darker before they would get any lighter.INTO THE ABYSSDespite his growing maturity, Prince would again lunge into the darkness on hisnext project. Whether it was the break-up of the Revolution, the end of hisrelationship with Susannah Melvoin, (Wendy’s twin sister, and Prince’s muse formuch of his mid-80s relationship songs,) or the rise of Hip-Hop as a seriousthreat to his position, his darker feelings during this period are conveyed via‘The Black Album,’ intended to be released with a plain black cover and notitle.The story behind ‘The Black Album’ has entered into legend. With it pressed andready to ship, Prince recalled it at the last minute and refused to release it.Thus, it would become one of the biggest bootleg albums of all time, even makingsome polls for that year’s greatest albums. (It would later be released byWarner Brothers as part of his contractual commitments in 1994).The album starts with ‘Le Grind.’ His voice is slowed to a demonic groan,rendering it almost incomprehensible – a variation on a trick with which Princewould experiment throughout his career. It intimates that the listener has foundtheir way into a secret group or club:“So U found me. Good, I’m glad.This is Prince, the cool of cools.Some of U may not know this, but some of U may know.Some of U may not want 2 know, We R here 2 do service.Welcome to the Funk Bible. The New Testament.”‘Le Grind’ then welcomes the listener to a ‘nouveau dance,’ which calls for allto have no fear on the dancefloor, and to indulge their carnal desires “like apony would”; to “put it where it feels good” all night long. The album repeatsthe familiar themes of sexual temptation, with some of the darker aspectsseemingly hinting at experiences that Prince had either witnessed, or taken partin during his years in the entertainment industry.Next on the album is ‘Cindy C,’ on the face of it, a vulgar desire piece basedon Prince’s affection for supermodel Cindy Crawford. However, when we considersome of the darker aspects of the entertainment industry, and its possible tiesto occult rituals, mind-control, and the high-class sex industry, some of thelyrics become more provocative:“Cindy C, play with me, I will pay the usual fee,I’ll give you seven sips of elderberry wine; maybe we’ll unlock the secrets ofyour mind.”Firstly, Prince indicates that he can have the ‘high-class model’ simply bypaying the usual fee, and that he will need to use some sort of alcoholicencouragement to elicit her secrets. This suggests that the secrets are those ofher high-class clients ... or possibly, that the model herself could be atrauma-based mind-control slave. Either way, Prince continues to emphasise thatCindy C is nothing more than a sexual plaything to him: “I’m sure you’re quiteintelligent, a wizz at math and all that shit. But I’m a tad more interested inflying your kite tonight.”There are both stylistic and overt references to Hip-Hop in the album, very muchindicating Prince’s negativity toward the genre at this stage of his career. Hisposition at the cutting-edge of black music was being dissolved not just by theemergence of a new musical genre, but by a cultural one, too. It’s easy to seewhy Prince, the multi-instrumentalist workaholic who spent a lifetime craftinghis tunes, was now being outsold and made to look out-of-date by musicians whowere – as Alan Leeds put it – “making hit records in their bedrooms.” ‘2 NigsUnited for West Compton’ would illustrate Prince’s scorn, and in ‘Dead On It,’he would mockingly rap:“Riding in my Thunderbird on the freeway, I turned on my radio 2 hear some musicplay.“I got a silly rapper talking silly shit instead, and the only good rapper isone that’s dead ... on it.”Another song on ‘The Black Album’ with a stylistic connection to Hip-Hop, is‘Bob George.’ Having played with prostitution in ‘Cindy C,’ here, Prince – withhis voice altered – assumes the role of a pimp berating his charge for playingaround, and accepting a diamond ring from a decadent rock-and-roll manager,“Slick-Back Paddy with all the gold in his mouth.”He paints a none-too-pretty picture of the management system in music and – lestwe think he is not speaking from experience – he makes it very clear in thepimp’s conversation with the trick:“Who bought you that diamond ring? Yeah, right.Since when did you have a job?You seeing that rich motherfucker again?What’s his name? Bob? Bob, ain’t that a bitch?What’s he do for a living? Manage rock stars?Who? Prince? Ain’t that a bitch? That skinny motherfucker with the high voice?”The pimp then threatens the trick with a gun, before making her wear the‘reddish-brown’ wig that he bought her. She is then chased by the police, andhas a phone conversation with a Mr. George, (speculated to be Nelson George, amusic critic with whom Prince was said to have been upset,) asking him, “whydon’t you leave motherfuckers alone?”After Prince has vented his frustration at Hip-Hop, his management and thecritics, ‘Superfunkycalifragysexy’ sees him back at the party in “the ‘house ofill-repute,” for a disturbing trip involving blood, drugs, and sadomasochism.Many theories have circulated, based on reports from band members, bodyguards,and sound engineers, that Prince had a bad experience on ecstasy, and haddetermined that ‘The Black Album’ was the devil working through him. This mayhave been the reason he shelved the album. That theory seems to be supported by‘Superfunkycalifragysexy.’ But, as we have been delving deeper into the lyricsfor any possible occult connections, then perhaps there might be something moreto the following:“If your body needs water, keep on dancing ‘cause you oughtaKeep the blood flowing down to your feet,Brother Maurice should be around in a minute with a bucket filled withsquirrelled meat.The blood is real good if you drink it real fast, but the aftertaste just lastsand lasts,If you kiss somebody, you want to party all night, All right!“If you do too much, your skin will be sensitive to touch,The first person that touches you, you want to fuck.You take them to your crib and you tie them to a chair,Then you make funny faces ’til they get really scared.Then you turn on the neon, then you play with yourself,Til you turn them on.”Here, Prince is talking about drinking the blood of what appears to be ananimal. In occult rituals, the drinking of blood signifies absorption of thepower of that blood, (some might say this is analogous to the drug ecstasy.)It seems that this blood makes him desire sex with the first person he touches.But then he goes further into sado-masochistic realms with a hint of torture, ashe ties the victim to a chair before masturbating in front of them. Later,Prince mentions “seven measures to make you scream.” Measure is another term foran alcoholic beverage, evoking the seven sips of elderberry wine that unlockedthe secrets of Cindy C’s mind earlier on.Prince had gone to a dark place. It’s interesting to consider how much he mighthave seen during his time at the very top of the music business. He would havedealt with executives, other musicians, and the criminals that are said toassociate with the industry, (drug dealers, pimps, etc). It could be argued thatsome of this is reflected in the dark imagery of ‘The Black Album.’ Speakingthrough his alter-egos in the programme for the 1988 ‘Lovesexy’ tour, hereflected:“Camille set out to silence his critics. No longer daring, his enemies laughed.No longer glam, his funk is half-assed.“Tuesday came. Blue Tuesday. His canvas full and lying on the table, Camillemustered all the hate that he was able. Hate 4 the ones who ever doubted hisgame. Hate 4 the ones who ever doubted his name. ’Tis nobody funkier. Let ‘TheBlack Album’ fly.“Spooky Electric was talking, Camille started 2 cry. Tricked. A fool he hadbeen. In the lowest utmostest. He had allowed the dark side of him 2 createsomething evil. ‘2 Nigs United 4 West Compton.’ Camille and his ego. ‘BobGeorge.’ Why? Spooky Electric must die.”The above excerpt provides the only testament from Prince personally about whyhe made ‘The Black Album’ the way he did.WHEN TWO WORLDS COLLIDEThe next album was ‘Lovesexy’, whose cover would again feature a paintedportrait of Prince nude against a white background filled with flowers. But thistime – in contrast to earlier albums – the scene arguably indicates purity and aspiritual rebirth.The two symbols that appear consistently throughout the album sleeves are theEye of Horus, and a stylised heart featuring the word ‘yes.’ This symbolic duetsums up this album’s dichotomy. We have seen Prince use the Eye before, and hehas always been fond of using numerical shorthand, (‘2’ for ‘two’, ‘4’ for‘four,’, etc,) so it’s little surprise that he would embrace the Eye in place ofthe letter ‘I.’There is, however, a possible alternative reason for its use from the album’sfirst song, ‘No.’ It starts with a spoken verse by poet Ingrid Chavez, whichthen fades into Prince’s voice stating: “Welcome to the New Power Generation,the reason why my voice is so clear is there is no smack in my brain.”This is not the first time Prince has sermonised against drugs, (he is criticalof his fellow rock stars’ fondness for cocaine in 1985’s ‘Pop Life.’) But givenhis sexual licentiousness explored on ‘The Black Album’ – or indeed, if rumoursof that bad ecstasy trip are true – he is directly announcing that his messageon this album is free of that influence. This song is all about the title inmany ways.“I know there is a Heaven, I know there is a Hell,Listen to me people, I got a story to tell,I know there was confusion, lightnin’ all around me,That’s when I called his name. Don’t you know he found me.No, is what Spooky Electric say, it’s not okay.But I know love is the only way, ’til my dying day.No, ‘til my dying day I’ll be okay, cuz Lovesexy is the one,’til my day isdone.”If we take the Eye of Horus as representative of the controlling occultsocieties, then Prince is possibly conveying two messages here. First, with thespelling of the title ‘I No,’ his rejection of the negative forces around himwhich he associates with the devil, as personified by Spooky Electric.But there is a double meaning here; it’s clear from the context that he alsomeans ‘know’ as in awareness and understanding. That, too, makes sense, as ‘Iknow’ becomes ‘I know about the eye.’ The symbols, therefore, of the Eye meaning‘no’ and the heart meaning ‘yes,’ are a simple reflection of the polaritybetween positive and negative forces.This theme is continued in ‘Anna Stesia.’ Some have argued that this title is aplay on the word anaesthesia, a means of inducing sleep. Indeed, the song tellsthe story of his awakening to positive forces, (personified here in a Christiansense as God,) as he seemingly inhabits the “houses of ill repute,” seekingsomeone to “play with” to cure a desperate loneliness. After being ravished andthen liberated by Anna Stesia, he begins to review his previous work, with apossible direct reference to ‘The Black Album’:“Between white and black, night and day, black night seemed the only way.”Prince then muses: “Maybe I could learn to love, I mean the right way,” andlater in the song undergoes a personal epiphany:“Save me, Lord, I’ve been a fool. How could I forget you are the rule?I am your child, oh yes I am your child. From now on, I shall be wild.I shall be quick, I shall be strong.I’ll tell your story no matter how long.”As Prince personified the negative as Spooky Electric, so he would give the name‘Lovesexy’ to the positive energy, describing it as, “the feeling you get whenyou fall in love, not with a boy or a girl, but with the Heavens above.” Thesong of the same name proves that – despite his awakening – sex is never farfrom his mind, as he seeks to infuse his sense of spirituality with his sense ofsexuality. The power of Lovesexy, he suggests, is as powerful as sex itself.There are some heavily sexualised lyrics in the mix, but he does stress at theend that, “we make love with only words.”The album’s last message is offered in ‘Positivity,’ a slow groove with amelancholic feel. In contrast to the “no” of the first song, the first wordshere are “yes, yes, yes.” Prince delivers this track as one final warning tosociety about the dangers of Spooky Electric, and of the temptation which haspermeated his work:“In every man’s life there will be a hang-up. A whirlwind designed to slow youdown,It cuts like a knife and tries to get in you, this Spooky Electric sound.Give up if you want to and all is lost, Spooky Electric will be your boss,Call ‘People’ magazine, ‘Rolling Stone,’ call your next of kin, ‘cause your assis gone.He’s got a 57 Mag with the price-tag still on the side, cuzzin,’ when Spooky saydead, you better say died.Or you can fly high right by Spooky, and all that he crawls for, Spooky and allthat he crawls for.”This could arguably be directed at his industry colleagues selling their soulsfor success – a rite of passage long mythologised when it comes to musicians.Prince, however, seems to escape the fate of having Spooky Electric be his‘boss,’ and leaves the listener – and perhaps any initiates in the musicindustry – with the following warning:“You gotta hold on, to your soul, we’ve got a long way to go,Don’t kiss the Beast.”If there were ever any doubt that this was the story Prince wanted to tell andthat, indeed, his internal conflict went beyond an adverse reaction to ‘TheBlack Album,’ the accompanying Lovesexy live tour would assuage it.A recording was aired on the UK’s Channel 4 in the late 80s, and remains one ofthe most interesting pieces of live footage of any popular musician. A conceptconcert in two parts, it tells the story of the battle of dark against light as,in the first half, he rips through some of his most salacious material. ‘EroticCity,’ ‘Head,’ ‘Jack U Off,’ ‘Sister,’ ‘Dirty Mind,’ ‘Controversy’ andSuperfunkycalifragisexy, see Prince cavort around a circular stage, completewith a basketball hoop, park swing and bed, while depicting sex acts,sadomasochism, and a gun battle with members of the band.Interestingly, he places ‘Bob George,’ the story of the pimp, at the end of thefirst set. As in the song, the police chase him on-stage, but the live concertshows them catching him up. As he realises his fate he reads the Lord’s Prayeraloud, and is finally shot dead in an echo of Prince’s message from ‘Under TheCherry Moon’ that, even in redemption, the guilty will be slain.The second part of the concert opens up with ‘I No.’ He then plays most of theuplifting music from ‘Lovesexy,’ with a smattering of greatest hits and upbeattunes. Even at concert level, Prince is telling the same story: the dark vs. thelight, the joys and pitfalls of temptation, and the inevitable punishment,followed by revelation and rebirth. As the lights go down, Prince is heardaddressing the audience:“Cross the line, cross the line, God will take care of you.”THE GREAT BEYONDThe end of the ‘Lovesexy’ album is not the end of the story, and by no means isit the end of Prince’s internal battles. He would go on, in the 1990s, to recordsome of his most sexually-explicit and aggressive tracks. He would also continueto be as politically, socially and spiritually aware as ever.It could, however, be argued that ‘Lovesexy’ marks a definite turning point,from which he begins to look at the trappings of superstardom in a negativelight, and possibly becomes aware of the occult influences upon it. From thisperspective, it’s possible to see the origin of the antipathy towards the musicindustry that would lead to his name-change, and his determination to find new,independent distribution models.Also evident is a rejection of himself as a tool of the industry to foment thefurther sexualisation of society; though he doesn’t completely reject it forsome years, after ‘Lovesexy,’ he is playing by his own rules.It is clear from what has been discussed, that Prince has used his art tohighlight the dualistic nature of our reality, and that his major topic – otherthan the act of sex itself – has been the battle between the dark and lightforces, and his own personal journey therein. All the themes of his albums –albeit maturing as time passed – concern its nature.He conveys a lasting interest in the Apocalypse as the precursor to a New Age.His conversion to the Jehovah’s Witness faith at the turn of the millennium isof little surprise, given that denomination’s focus on the end times and thesecond coming. The research undertaken shows that, while Prince is no seriousoccult adept, he is aware of the meaning of symbols, and how to use both themand language to deliver coded messages which are best hidden in plain sight, andalways open to interpretation.This writer will confess that this work represents just that – an interpretationof music searching for an elusive, yet fascinating theme. Prince’s reluctance togo on-record in any substantial way, leaves us only his output by which tofigure it all out."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUEMost of this article was written in 2015, and was finished just prior to theartist’s death the following year. His passing is therefore not mentioned, andit makes little difference to the content. It was written as a research piece toaccompany the work of this book’s author, and will be best appreciated withinthat context.As one might gather from a work this in-depth, I have a long-standing admirationand respect for Prince’s work, and grieve the loss of talent his deathrepresents. As some of the topics were conspiratorial and occult in nature, itbears mentioning that – as with other early deaths of major artists – there area number a conspiracy theories regarding his demise. I would direct yourattention to the author’s earlier chapter for an excellent summary of the majorpoints.Whether there is any truth to the rumours, or it was – as portrayed in the press– an unfortunate and untimely event, the battle for music’s soul goes on, ascorporate artists continue to sell an agenda of baser instincts for ever-largerprofits. In the background – or even in the foreground – artists will perhaps betrying to convey something deeper and more spiritual through their work.Sadly, there will be nothing new on the horizon from the artist formerly knownas Prince.Dan Monroe, 2017.Dan Monroe can be e-mailed directly at secretfirefilms@gmail.com"},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX 2FURTHER DUBIOUS CONNECTIONSIn the spirit of many other parts of this book, here’s another dizzying array ofcurious links and connections which readers might not have expected to havefound before reading this tome, but which will surely come as no surprise tothose who now have. We’re darting around a bit, as always, and this ismulti-music genre, but bear with me ... Let’s start by going back to the aforementioned Wilde family. The real name ofMarty’s dad was Reginald Smith, and he was a military man, trained at the‘prestigious’ Sandhurst Military Institute. Marty, like his dad, also went bythe original name of Reginald Smith, and became the father of Kim. Marty, in hisheyday as a performer and artist mentor, knew the celebrated record producer JoeMeek, and would take other musicians to recording sessions with him. Joe Meekhad a dubious private life, having connections to the world of organised crime,and having been prosecuted in 1963 for ‘importuning for immoral purposes,’homosexual acts still being illegal at the time. Meek had reportedly been one ofseveral homosexual paedophiles to share a rent boy named Bernard Oliver, whosebody was found cut into eight pieces and put into two suitcases in Suffolk inJanuary 1967. Meek, by this point having suffered a mental breakdown, wasreportedly terrified of being questioned by police over the murder, and inFebruary 1967, used a shotgun that he’d taken from former Tornadoes bassistHeinz Burt to blast the landlady of his London home to death before turning thegun on himself.Just before we leave the family, another of Marty’s early industry associates,(and Joe Meek’s,) was the celebrated producer Mickie Most, (real name MichaelHayes,) another key player whose father was a career military officer. A coupleof decades later, Kim Wilde got signed to Mickie Most’s RAK Records in her firstlabel deal. The label later hosted the 1980s pop act Johnny Hates Jazz, of whichMickie’s son Calvin was a member. Calvin and Kim were romantically linked for atime, with rumours of impending marriage, but the relationship fizzled out.Back to Joe Meek now, and one of the most high-profile acts on his roster wasThe Tornadoes, best known for their UK number one hit ‘Telstar.’ One of the bandmembers was a Robb Huxley. In his on-line autobiography, Robb notes that somedigging into his genealogy revealed that he’s a fourth cousin of theaforementioned ‘Brave New World’ author, eugenicist and co-architect of theCIA’s MK-Ultra programme, Aldous Huxley. What were the chances?! There is acurrent-day DJ and producer named Huxley who has enjoyed great success, butdisappointingly he turns out to have adopted the moniker, having been bornMichael Dodman. It was Aldous’ brother Julian, meanwhile, who created the ideaof ‘conspiracy theorists’ wearing tinfoil hats to shield themselves from havingtheir minds read in his 1927 science-fiction short story ‘The Tissue-CultureKing.’ Now, of course, this notion is used to mock and deride those whochallenge official government narratives and seek truth.In a 2012 interview with ‘It’s Psychedelic Baby’ Magazine, Robb Huxley spoke ofhis time working with Joe Meek, commenting:“He (Joe) also arranged for us to play at the Aberfan Disaster charity eventwhich was held in Cardiff ... At the charity function, we as the Tornadoesbecame acquainted with the infamous Kray twins, and Ronnie Kray first becameinterested in stealing us away from Joe. When Ronnie was told that we were undercontract to Joe Meek he told us: ‘Don’t worry we’ll take care of him’.”Could this be a hint towards what really happened to Joe?This is far from the only link between the British music industry and the worldof gangland crime, meanwhile. The criminal antics of Don Arden, the father ofSharon Osbourne and manager of several bands including Small Faces and BlackSabbath, were documented earlier. And readers of ‘Musical Truth 1’ may recall alink to an article originally penned by the former British intelligenceoperative known as T. Stokes and later expanded upon by the writer Chris Spiveyon his website. It details many such links in a mind-blowing interconnected web.Here’s the link again for anyone wanting to recap:http://chrisspivey.org/sutch-as-it-is-based-on-the-unpublished-t-stokes-article-who-murdered-screaming-lord-sutch/#comment-172748[http://chrisspivey.org/sutch-as-it-is-based-on-the-unpublished-t-stokes-article-who-murdered-screaming-lord-sutch/#comment-172748]In 2010, a collection of personal items that had belonged to the Krays was soldfor £20,000 at an auction in East Sussex. Among them was a handwritten letterfrom Ronnie Kray to the Krays biographer John Pearson, written during his timein Brixton prison, telling him that Cliff Richard had written to him to cheerhim up. Isn’t heart-warming to hear of Cliff doing his Christian duty?In their criminal heyday, the Krays were associates of the Labour MP Tom Dribergand the Tory peer Lord Boothby, both of whom were homosexuals and allegedpaedophiles. (Boothby is portrayed, none too flatteringly, in the 2015 Kraysbiopic ‘Legend’ starring Tom Hardy.) Cliff Richard was also a close associate ofBoothby in his younger days, and according to some, a whole lot more. The Kraysare believed by many researchers to have been involved in the procurement ofchildren for ‘elite’ paedophile rings, and by some to have been subjects ofmind-control experimentation themselves. Twins were favoured in the ‘work’ ofNazi ‘doctors’ such as Josef Mengele, and psychopathy and extreme violence arecharacteristics resulting from ‘experiments.’ The Krays also had working linksto many other movers and shakers of the 1960s music scene, including theomnipresent Jimmy Savile, fellow BBC DJ Alan ‘Fluff’ Freeman, (the subject ofmale child-rape allegations in 2013,) and the Beatles’ manager Brian Epstein whodied very suddenly in 1967.Staying with the Krays, an affiliate of theirs in the 1960s was a criminal bythe name of James ‘Jimmy The Dip’ Kensit, who also worked on frauds for thenotorious Charlie Richardson Gang. Jimmy The Dip went on to become the father ofPatsy Kensit, born in 1968, whose first taste of fame was as a child star whenshe appeared in TV commercials for Birds Eye Peas. Ronnie Kray became godfatherto Patsy’s brother Jamie. Patsy went on to become a singer, and was another torock the familiar ‘blonde bombshell’ image, fronting the group Eighth Wonder inthe 1980s. She is better known for being a rock star wife, however, havingmarried (and divorced) Dan Donovan of Big Audio Dynamite, Jim Kerr of SimpleMinds, Liam Gallagher of Oasis and Jeremy Healy of Haysi Fantaysi in rapidsuccession. In 2003, Patsy took part in the BBC ancestry programme ‘Who Do YouThink You Are,’ where she was revealed to have been shocked by the criminal pastof both her father and grandfather.Military-intelligence, social-engineering think-tanks, organised crime,mind-control, paedophilia ... . did we leave anything out?

Init, he draws attention to the breathtaking amount of aristocrats, dignitaries,royals and political and religious leaders who, over several centuries, havebeen painted or photographed displaying a Masonic-style ‘clawed hand’ gesture.This has been further identified as a Triad Hand Sign, and a motif of theMarranos, of which, more on this link –http://www.thebabylonmatrix.com/index.phptitle=911:Occult_symbolism_XVI#Triad_sign[http://www.thebabylonmatrix.com/index.phptitle=911:Occult_symbolism_XVI#Triad_sign]The sign is shown in a portrait of the English philosopher and friar RogerBacon, dating as far back as the 13th century. It goes on to appear in portraitsof the likes of Christopher Columbus, Martin Luther, several ‘British’ (soGerman) monarchs, Sir Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, Josef Stalin and AdolfHitler, coming all the way forward to present-day with Michelle (Michael) Obama,Pope Benedict XVI and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The gesture involves the two middle fingers being bunched together to leave theremaining two free, and has been interpreted as signalling the letters M and W.These together render three Vs. The letter V is “waw” in Hebrew and “vav” inGematria and is the 6th letter in both, meaning the numerical value of the handsign would be 666. (Is it just me, or have we come across that number somewhereelse in this story?) These three Hebrew letters also form the ‘claw’ emblem ofthe popular ‘Monster’ energy drink brand.Makow points out that the hands being so prominently shown in such a largenumber of portraits, and over such a vast period of time, goes beyond the realmsof ‘coincidence,’ and that there has to have been a good reason for wanting themon display. He speculates that the sign may indicate genealogical links to aparticular bloodline deemed to be of great importance in ‘elite’ circles, ormembership to a particular order or fraternity. According to the alternativehistorian David Livingstone, the Triad sign is the calling card of an ongoingbloodline of Khazar crypto-Jews which has its roots in Jewish mysticism and theKabbalah. The Vulcan hand sign frequently displayed by Mr. Spock in ‘Star Trek’also becomes very interesting in this regard. Once again, the truth appears tobe getting placed in plain sight, in the knowledge that only a few will be ableto discern any real meaning from it.As a commenter on Makow’s on-line posting stated:“ ... It is hard to believe that these people did not do this sign withoutintention. Firstly, the sign does take an effort to make, and secondly it hasbeen performed over many centuries. As to the painters, I think they were mostlikely initiated as well, meaning they knew the meaning of that sign. It waspurposely drawn this way.“You could equate the paintings from back then to our modern magazines, whereyou constantly see photographers taking one-eye, pyramid and other symbolicpictures.”"},{"pageContent":"Resources:Henry Makow: Hand sign indicates massive Satanic conspiracy: * https://www.henrymakow.com/2016/10/Hand-Sign-Indicates-Massive-Satanic-Conspiracy%20%20.html [https://www.henrymakow.com/2016/10/Hand-Sign-Indicates-Massive-Satanic-Conspiracy%20%20.html]Hand signs of Freemasonry explained: * https://veritas-vincit-international.org/2015/01/18/hand-signals-of-freemasonry-explained/ [https://veritas-vincit-international.org/2015/01/18/hand-signals-of-freemasonry-explained/]"},{"pageContent":"THE SOUND OF FREEDOMTSOF is a free, regular showcase of conscious music old and new, compiled byMark Devlin.
