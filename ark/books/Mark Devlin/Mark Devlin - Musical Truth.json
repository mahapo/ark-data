Truth does not changebecause it is, or is not, believed by a majority of the people.”Giordano Bruno (1548-1600)“It’s the action, not the fruit of the action, that’s important. You have to dothe right thing. It may not be in your power, may not be in your time, thatthere’ll be any fruit. But that doesn’t mean you stop doing the right thing. Youmay never know what results come from your action. But if you do nothing, therewill be no result.”Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948)“There are only two mistakes you can make on the path to truth. One is notstarting, the other is not going all the way.”Mark PassioThe title for this book was chosen because it reflects my two main passions inlife – music and truth. To be absolutely clear, though, I’m not claiming thateverything mentioned in this volume is the absolute, undisputed truth. No-onecould ever make so bold a claim. Much of it, by necessity, has to be conjecture,or an account of what other researchers have themselves claimed. Overall,though, the ‘truth’ bit can be taken as the observation that nothing in theentertainment industry is as it appears on its glossy surface. That much atleast is a consistent truth!What is written in this book will shock many people – particularly those I’veknown since before 2010, the year that I ‘woke up.’ This is entirelyunderstandable given the degree to which the content goes right against thegrain of everything we’re raised to believe is ‘normal’ and to accept as truth.All I would ask is that, when confronted with information that, heard for thefirst time sounds ridiculous or impossible, you do not reject it out of hand onthe basis that it ‘doesn’t sound right.’ It is a natural tendency of the humanpsyche to throw out anything that doesn’t fit in this way.As recently as 2011, anyone claiming that UK ‘national treasure’ Jimmy Savilewas a vile paedophile who sexually abused children on BBC premises unimpeded foralmost 50 years, would have been scoffed at and written off as a wild fantasist.Yet with the passage of time and the availability of new information, we nowknow this to be the case. The same principle can apply to any of the informationcontained within this book, and an open mind that is prepared to go where theevidence takes it and, crucially, question for itself at all points, is anessential tool to get anything out of the information you’re about to read.As many other researchers in the alternative realm often say, I absolutelyencourage readers not to just take anything that I say here at face value, butto go away and research all these points for themselves. An avoidance ofcorporate-owned, mainstream media outlets is going to be necessary to thisprocess for reasons that will be obvious, and any on-line endeavours require amindfulness of the vast amount of mis- and dis-information on the web – some ofit there through the writer’s well-meaning error, some posted to deliberatelymis-inform and lead visitors up the garden path. Either way, a vigilantresearcher with the genuine will to want truth will be synchronistically led tothe information they need. An enquiring mind coupled with a strong dose ofintuition will provide the results that are sought.None of the scenarios I outline in this book are that way just because I, oranyone else, says they are. I sincerely wish most of them weren’t that way andthat I’d never had to tell this story. There are many things I’d prefer to bedoing with my life than putting out information like this. But truth is truth,and it remains so eternally regardless of whether any one individual likes it,believes it or chooses to look at it.The following is pretty much the best debunk I’ve seen of the classic accusationlevelled against individuals who prefer to think for themselves rather than taketheir instructions from other sources, being labelled ‘conspiracy theorists’ asa convenient way of writing them – and therefore anything they say – off. Itreally makes the point:“You keep asking for evidence, as if anything anyone posts on-line will qualifyas such. How about looking at the world around you? Do you not see what ishappening? The architects of the New World Order are anything but subtle.“I was once sceptical, as society instructed me to be, of anything that impliedthat all the horrible things that happen in the world are conjured up byconspirators, as if it’s perfectly natural for things like slavery, fascism, andthe wholesale rape of our planet to occur. But pure logic eventually overwhelmedmy programming and forced me to take a closer look at what I was being told wastrue.“ . . . The evidence that well-organised, well-funded, sinister organisationsare implementing an Orwellian totalitarian society is so ubiquitous that onemust pay no attention at all to world news to avoid being assaulted withhorrors.“The state of the world is evidence enough for me that someone is conspiring tobring these things about, and the only places I find any answers that make alick of sense are the so called ‘conspiracy’ nuts, who look into these thingsand risk their own lives to share what they find. If you really don’t knowbetter, then I feel sorry for you; if you do and are just dutifully debunkingthe enemies of your masters, then you might want to consider what’s going tohappen to you once they completely take over and you are no longer useful tothem . . .”To get the most out of this book, I recommend reading the chapters sequentially,rather than dipping in and out at random. If nothing else, however, do notdepart without reading the chapter on Predictive Programming, and the final twochapters, as this is where the most valuable information this entire story hasto impart resides.Strap yourself in, and watch the ride!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1THE ROAD TO TRUTHThe origins of an awakening.\"Wake from your sleep, kid,Let it settle in,We be living in the strangest times that's ever been.\"Alais Clay: 'Wake 'Em Up' (2013)\"If you are wondering who are the designers of the terrible lie, they are thosewho in secret conspire to control the Earth and all of its resources. They reignby using terror, lies, murder and deceit. They have created the illusion thatpain, suffering, war, death and slavery is just how things have to be. Do not befooled by them, live freely, walk uprightly. Ashe!\"Mel Bell-Grey: You're Not Invited' (2014)\"You wouldn't be here if you didn't want this.\"Santos BonacciIt was always written, it seems to me, that I was to become a music man. Alifelong love of it was instilled in me from a very early age. I'd like to saythis was as a result of my Dad being some Bohemian singer/ songwriter always athis guitar, or my Mum playing soul and blues records around the house. In fact,it was all down to Sunday bathtimes. Enduring memories of my childhood involvebeing given my bath ready for school on Monday, at the time of the weekly topten countdown on 'Pick Of The Pops' as it was called back then, on Radio 1.(Unfortunately most of the DJs presenting it seem to have been exposed aspaedophiles or sex pests of one variety or another in recent years, but that'sthe BBC for you.)Anyway, this routine exposed my impressionable young brain to whatever pop songswere doing the rounds over the course of several years, and was responsible forme scraping together some pennies and buying my first 7-inch single from mylocal Woolworths at the age of five. Given some of the appalling tosh that wasaround in 1975 this could have had disastrous results; ('Whispering Grass' byWindsor Davis & Don Estelle? 'The Magic Roundabout' by Jasper Carrot, 'The UglyDuckling' by Mike Reid? 'The Trail Of The Lonesome Pine' by Laurel & Hardy?)Thankfully, my induction into a lifetime of musical consumption was far morecool. It was Queen's 'Bohemian Rhapsody' during its nine-week run in the UKnumber one spot at the tail end of '75.My remaining childhood and early teen years were spent soaking up the pop musicof the times, before some fine-tuning of my musical tastes at the age of 15,aided by the strong influence of a progressive-thinking school-friend, turned meon to the appeal of what was broadly termed 'black dance music.' Thisencompassed the soul, funk and electro styles that were prevalent in themid-80s, along with early hip-hop, and we were pretty much the only kids in myschool that showed an interest in this stuff. It just wasn't that kind of town.Nevertheless, standing out from the crowd and not blindly doing what everybodyelse was doing held a certain appeal for me. Plus the music was bloody good. Soa few years down the line I decided that what I really wanted was some kind ofcareer playing and exposing all this stuff to as many people as possible. Thingsdidn't get off to the best of starts. Social inadequacy and a crippling lack ofconfidence held me back from doing anything constructive for many years, and thelack of resources at my disposal based on where I lived didn't help.But to cut a very long story short, I eventually went on to re-invent myself asa radio and club DJ, and later a music writer. The driving factor behind all ofit was simply a desire to generate the same kind of passion and enthusiasm forothers towards anything that I considered a great tune, and to reflect theamazing power that music has for capturing the emotions; to articulate in threeor four minutes a state of mind that would be impossible to communicateadequately in any other way, and to help conjure up cherished nostalgic memoriesin the way that only a song which truly resonates can really do.I'll spare readers any specific anecdotes from my DJing career. I covered plentyof those in my debut book 'Tales From The Flipside' anyway, (still available athttp://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000227787[http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000227787]for anyone who's interested,) published in what now feels like another lifetimelong before I 'woke up.'Suffice to say that, for many years, I played the game and felt very much a partof the machine referred to as 'the industry.' I did everything DJs were expectedto do; got myself on to promotional mailing lists, helped the record companiesout by playing certain tunes that had been designated promotional 'priorities,'sent off my weekly chart returns to show which records I was supporting,interviewed key artists for the radio, etc. In the early years, I rarely foundmyself playing tunes I wasn't personally into myself. I was active within thehip-hop, R&B and 'urban' music fields, and most of what came out of the biglabels during the 1990s was credible, high-quality material which I still love.Sadly, the same can't be said of the product that emerged during the decade thatfollowed, but the degeneration of those styles was a slow-drip effect that creptup stealthily like a mugger in an alley. In retrospect, the product of the early2000s, though not a patch on what had preceded it, was still of masterpiecequality compared to the stupefying garbage that mainstream so-called 'R&B' and'hip-hop' had become by 2009.Not that I really gave much thought to it at the time. Like all my peers, I wasswept along with the scene as the years progressed, and continued to play myposition as a professional DJ, reflecting public tastes by giving the crowdswhatever they wanted to hear, and helping to gain familiarity for new styles,sounds and production techniques as they occurred.By 2008 though, the indicators that all was not quite as it should be in thesegenres – and in popular music generally – was becoming too blatant for even mywholly unawake self to ignore. I presented a 'Top 40 Urban Tunes of 2008' on theradio and remember only personally liking two of them. Something had gone wrong.Lyrics in hip-hop, once a wonderfully creative, energetic and inspiring genre,had all gone the same way, and talk of sex, champagne, gold chains, assortedhigh-fashion brand names and girls with big butts in the club were the onlysubjects that ever got referenced. The production styles had changed. Gone werethe sample-based beats of the 90s, evoking wonderful mood and emotion throughthe use of old soul and funk records. Everything by this point had taken on agrating, electronic style and seemed to be mastered to an ear-splittingfrequency range that created a feeling of imbalance and unease. There was also atidal wave of Auto Tune, a vocal production 'style' straight from the bowels ofHell which I'll do proper justice to in a later chapter.Either way, the glut of rappers that were now being presented as the current-dayhip-hop royalty – Lil' Wayne, Drake, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, T-Pain, Akon, FloRida, Pitbull, and a severely degenerated Jay-Z and Kanye West, just didn't holdthe same appeal as the likes of A Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr, Brand Nubian,Pete Rock & CL Smooth, KRS One, De La Soul, Main Source, Naughty By Nature, WuTang Clan, Public Enemy, Notorious BIG, MC Lyte, Foxy Brown and Lil' Kim had adecade before. Everything felt corporate-controlled to an extent that had notbeen evident before, and all output seemed to be produced according to somestandard blueprint or other, with individual creative expression being stifled.Above all, the music just wasn't fun any more, and no longer spoke to me in anymeaningful way.So some dis-satisfaction was already present on my part prior to being led tosome revelations that were altogether more disturbing.THE PARADIGM SHIFTBy 2008 I'd already come to some realisation that the world is nothing like whatwe've spent all of our lives being told it is by governments and the mainstreammedia. And if anything, this is understating the situation grossly! Although Iwas still 'unawake' at this point, and was blindly stumbling around in the worldwith no proper awareness, I'd still spent a fair bit of time in my life musingover some of the bigger questions; who or what are we? Why are we here? What is'here' anyway? What happens when we die? You know, lightweight pub conversationslike that. I'd been through a phase as an agnostic, followed what I believed tobe a born-again Christian, then a long period of ardent atheism, largely as aresult of frustration that my previous status hadn't come anywhere near toanswering my big questions, but had instead raised a whole bunch of new ones.I'd always had a propensity towards open-minded free thinking, somethingenthusiastically encouraged by my Dad, who had been a prodigious reader andlate-night armchair ponderer for as long as I could remember.In 1995 I read Graham Hancock's 'Fingerprints Of the Gods', which proposed thathuman civilisations were far, far older than the conventional history bookswould have us believe, with some evidence for humanity having been seeded byoff-world entities, and this was a real paradigm-shifter for me. This was thefirst time I'd heard about the Mayan calendar and the end of the yuga cycle thatit foretold in December 2012, some 17 years ahead at my time of reading. Thisseemed like a doom-laden prophecy at the time, and as I read the book amidst thehigh-rise buildings of Manhattan, imagining all kinds of destruction that the'end of an age' might bring, I remember making contingency plans for being atthe top of a very high mountain when December 2012 came around. (I wasn't.)The books of David Icke had come on to my radar by 2008, and there are twophrases of his which resonated big time and really summed up what I'd come tounderstand, and which again, were probably huge understatements. One was, 'thegulf between what's really going on in this world and what we're told is goingon, is absolutely immense.' The other was, 'this world is being run byunbelievably sick people.' Those two phrases ring ever truer with every passingyear.Something which was very easy for me to take on board was the assertion thatworld events are not controlled by those we are told they are. Governments don'trun countries. The truth is that there is an 'elite' class of individuals, verysmall in number as a percentage of the world population, who over an immenseperiod of time, have consolidated their position as the manipulators of prettymuch every aspect of daily human life. Membership of this group is mainly bygenealogy, and families of this cabal obsessively interbreed with each other inorder to keep their bloodlines 'pure,' such is the importance they place ontheir DNA. (This, of course, raises the question of their true origin, andwhether or not they descend from a source that is fully human.)This group has a deep understanding of the true nature of reality – thateverything in existence is an expression of the same universal field of soundand light energy, vibrating at an infinite number of frequencies, and that whenyou understand this and learn how to manipulate it, it can be shaped and mouldedto bring about the type of physical manifestations you desire. If you justhappen to be a group with malevolent intent and hell-bent on gaining a tacticaladvantage over the rest of humanity by controlling and enslaving themphysically, mentally and spiritually, the implications are immense, and thepower that you stand to gain is monumental.Understanding this dynamic – or even entertaining its possibility – actuallymakes sense of so much of the insanity, injustice and human suffering that wesee in this world, and have done throughout history. Wars, engineered faminesand diseases, corporate and financial slavery, all take on a different naturewhen viewed from this perspective.The evidence is overwhelming that groups of families, frequently operatingthrough various secret societies that reflect their dark occult practices, havecome to hijack and infiltrate all walks of life, in all parts of the world. Itis this group that has been responsible for instilling royalty, (and thequestion of where the 'divine right to rule' of kings may come from is a wholenew subject in itself which a great many authors and researchers go into.)They've long since installed the governmental rulers of the world to enforcetheir will upon the respective populations. Through various covert methods theyhave worked on mind control and social engineering programmes, to literally'hypnotise' humans into accepting their version of what constitutes 'normal.'They've created the world of corporations and business, and have worked toestablish materialism and the idea that the more possessions you have thehappier you will be in life, as the ultimate dream to pursue.They created the illusory concept of 'money' through instilling fiat currencies,and have crafted the world's financial systems to keep humanity enslaved andrestricted in the type of life they can live according to the amount of 'money'they have access to. And through recognising that, on the whole, humans have aninnate and inherent tendency towards exploring their true spiritual nature, theyhave created and manipulated the religious systems of the world, to keep peoplefurther enslaved by the dogma of whatever religion so many adhere to by sheervirtue of the world region that they happen to be born into.They've even provided for those who reject any kind of spiritual world view bycreating the equally rigid and restrictive dogma of scientism – the idea thatthere are no mysteries to life, that there is no great intelligence beyond thehuman mind, and that anything that can't be explained by government-funded,peer-reviewed scientific 'fact' – usually by people who place assorted lettersafter their name – can be rejected by default as 'unscientific' bunkum. Thenthere's rigid atheism and denial of anything of an esoteric, non-physical naturepeddled by the likes of Oxford University Professor Richard Dawkins, (whose workI deludedly followed for many years,) to make sure that every base is covered.I fully understand how preposterous this suggestion sounds to so many when heardfor the first time, because it flies in the face of everything we've spent alifetime being conditioned to accept as 'normal'. I can understand that itbecomes harder to accept the older the recipient of the information is, becauseembracing its validity involves admitting that you've spent an entire lifetimebeing duped, and that you now have to start afresh with a proverbial blank sheetof paper and recreate your entire world view from scratch. But to any rigidsceptic I would pose the following question: Looking at the way the world istoday, which version of events makes the most logical sense? That it's this waybecause of random chance and the way things just happen to have evolved throughhuman beings just not being able to get on with each other? Or that it's thisway because it's been coldly manipulated to be so by an extremely powerful groupof individuals obsessed with gaining power and control for themselves to thedetriment of everyone else?British hypnotherapist and writer on the subject of mind control, Neil Sanders,commented in a 2013 interview:\"It's not really as paranoid as it might sound to assume that, essentially,there's a status quo, and they quite like the way it is and they quite likebeing in charge. So it's not unreasonable to assume that powerful people haveconsolidated their position, and wish to maintain this position, and one of theways that they do this is by the setting of roles and the setting of 'norms' insociety.\"The Canadian researcher and writer Henry Makow observes:\"People who control a grossly disproportionate share of the world's wealth willtake measures to consolidate their position.\"Fairly obvious when you think about it. And it was put even simpler by the late,great US comedian George Carlin.\"It's a big club . . . and you ain't in it.\"I was ready to accept this state of affairs as a reality, because it made senseof so many unanswered questions. But many struggle with accepting it for monthsor years as a result of a condition that's come to be known as cognitivedissonance. This is described as 'the mental stress or discomfort experienced byan individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values atthe same time, or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existingbeliefs, ideas, or values.'Cognitive dissonance comes into play when you raise any kind of theory whichconflicts with the official take on a given subject. Suggest to some that 9/11was covertly staged by elements of the US government, and many, (although theirnumber are diminishing by the day,) will still be quick to dismiss you as a'conspiracy theorist,' (a phrase specifically created by the CIA in the 1960s todiscredit those who were asking valid questions about the JFK assassination,)and cling desperately to the official line that 'Bin Laden did it.' Because toaccept the alternative suggestion would set off a whole sequence of mentalspanners-in-the-works. If the US government was somehow involved, that wouldmean they've been lying to us all these years. That would mean that the 'War onTerror' and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq launched in its wake werebased knowingly on a lie, and that millions of people have died needlessly as aresult of that lie. And if the US government has no problem seeing millions ofinnocent people killed on the basis of a lie they knowingly concocted, what doesthat say about the true nature of the people we look up to and who claim torepresent us and have our best interests at heart? And if they lied aboutsomething as monumental as 9/11, what else could they be lying about? (Theanswer, by the way, would be 'pretty much everything!')This is the type of cognitive dissonance brought about by just one event. Theevidence to support the fact that 9/11 was, to a very large extent, an 'insidejob' and not the work of 19 Arab hijackers armed with box cutters directed by aman living in a remote cave on a dialysis machine, as the governments andmainstream media outlets of the world would have us believe, is monumental. Thefact that at least five of the 'hijackers' are still alive is one. The idea thatthe incriminating paper passport of one of the 'hijackers' just happened tosurvive the carnage in New York City intact, when all around steel and concretehad been pulverised to rubble is another. World Trade Center Building 7 standingintact behind BBC TV reporter Jane Standley as she announced it had collapsed afull 26 minutes before it actually did, and the BBC just happening to 'lose'their archive tapes of the broadcast is another. (You don't see much of JaneStandley on TV any more, do you? Funny that.) But you can take your pick fromthe several hundred other anomalies and discrepancies if you choose, as there'sno shortage to select from, with the number of books, articles and videos nowinto the hundreds of thousands.And all this from just one event. 9/11 is far from an isolated incident in termsof the big picture of what's really going on in our world, and the sameanomalies with the 'official version' can be applied to pretty much every othermajor news event of the past several decades and beyond. While 'conspiracytheory' is a convenient catch-all term to dismiss any truthseeker who offers analternative view to the official line, the majority of popular conspiracy'theories' can now be demonstrated, with supporting evidence, to be conspiracyfact. And in the twisted, inverted reality in which we find ourselves, it's theofficial government story which is the real 'conspiracy theory,' laden as theyalways are with glaring inaccuracies and discrepancies that make no sense underthe scrutiny of a truly inquisitive and unbiased mind.This being the case, there are two stances that I generally take with thosesceptics who automatically scoff and dismiss any suggestion that the world couldbe just a little different to what we're being told, on the basis that it can'tpossibly be true because it 'doesn't sound right.'One is to ask them to use their imagination and put themselves in the place ofan 'elite.' For this, they need to forget all about how they themselves wouldact in any given situation, and instead, take on the mind-set of a psychopath –one whose mental condition makes it impossible for them to empathise with thefeelings of others, thus leaving them free of any qualms whatsoever about howtheir actions might cause others to suffer. Their priority is to maintain theirposition as a ruler and controller over the rest of the population, and thismust be upheld at all costs. Imagine also that you happen to be a satanist, andimmersed in dark energy that allows any act of evil to be fair game. With thesetenets in place, now consider what tactics you would employ.Would you seek to install obedient governmental leaders around the world thatwould do your bidding and adhere to your agenda? Would you instruct thesegovernmental leaders to present an innocent and benevolent-sounding cover storyfor their actions to disguise their true nature? (Telling the public that youare invading an overseas nation to 'protect the people' while you slaughter thepopulation and steal that nation's land and natural resources would be just oneof a multitude of examples that would apply.)Would you bring all the main media outlets – newspapers, television and radionews, prominent internet sites – under your control, and shape and mould thecontent to give the masses the versions of events that suit you, whilecompletely ignoring and side-lining those subjects that you don't want thepeople to know about?Would you coerce the public into eating food and adopting lifestyle habits thatbring on cancer and other diseases, then deliberately suppress known naturalcures and criminalise their use, instead offering pharmaceutical drugs,chemotherapy and radiotherapy, knowing that these treatments are actuallyresponsible for killing off many of the patients even quicker and causing thevery diseases they're claimed to cure, while at the same time creating anindustry worth billions every year to those that run it?Would you seek to introduce a worldwide financial system that keeps thepopulation in perpetual economic slavery to the bankers that run it, and thatkeeps the people of the world needing to constantly work for the majority oftheir lives just to be able to afford to live?Would you create religious systems that keep vast groups of people controlled bycreating a belief that they will suffer eternal damnation and separation fromtheir 'god' if they dare to disobey the rules and regulations set out in aparticular book?Would you seek to create a paradigm in which what's considered 'normal' or'possible' is what suits your ongoing agenda of control, and of cutting peopleoff from a recognition of their true spiritual nature and potential, in whichanyone who deviates from these 'norms' and tries to tell others that there'sanother way of looking at things is immediately demonised and branded as'crazy?'I can say for myself that I would certainly do all of the above. Is it reallytoo much of a stretch to imagine that this might be exactly what has happened?Consider also, the type of public reaction that would most suit the darkcontrollers in such a scenario. Would it not be a widespread scoffingcondemnation of any information offered regarding their true nature on the basisthat it 'can't possibly be true'? Dismissing information on this basis withoutdoing any independent research of your own whatsoever, is exactly the type ofresponse they would rely on. This stance is the origin of the phrase made famousby Albert Einstein: \"Condemnation without investigation is the height ofignorance.\"The other stance is to ask people whether they can afford to take the chancethat the above scenario might be true, given the implications for human freedomthat it brings. Yes, the idea of a worldwide conspiracy spanning generationsthat has prevented human society from taking what would have been its naturalcourse if left free of these manipulations might be a load of old bollocks. Butthen again it might not. And, with doubts being cast by so many researchers intothe subject, and evidence presented at every turn to suggest all might not be asit seems, . . . can you afford to take the chance? Through adamantly refusing tolook at the evidence, despite the free abundance of it now available through theinternet, are you allowing this system of human subjugation to continueunimpeded by your tacit co-operation? It's a question I would suggest everyoneowes it to both themselves and their families to ask.There are the two classic errors of judgement that people so often make:1. They'd never do that(No, you and I would never do that. They do it all the time!)2. If they did the media would tell us about it.(Well, the alternative media has been trying to do just that for a long timenow, but they're the ones so quickly brushed off as 'crackpots.' So much for theassertion that we'd know if there was a conspiracy against humanity then. As forthe mainstream media, they're just another expression of the very problem we'retalking about here. How could they not be when they're ultimately owned andcontrolled by the same organisations?)What it boils down to is that most of us have been deliberately lied to anddeceived about great truths in the world from the moment we were born. We havebeen taken for fools, and in the case of those who continue to blindingly acceptwhat they're told without applying any kind of critical research for themselves,as willing fools, complicit in their own duping. To put it in everyday language,we've all been taken for mugs, and who appreciates being treated as a mug? Notthis one. It's so bizarre that you can say to people, 'if there were a sinister,far-reaching agenda to subvert and enslave you and your family, would you wantto know about it?', to which most people would answer 'yes, of course I would.'Having established this, you can then go on to point out that this is exactlywhat is happening right now, to which most of those same people would laugh,sneer and dismiss the suggestion. I guess they didn't really want to know afterall, then?WAKEY, WAKEYAnd so, what I came to understand caused me to grudgingly accept that I had tore-evaluate my entire perspective on the world and who was really controllingit, and this led to even bigger questions such as, how have they been able to doit . . . and what is the true nature of this existence in which we findourselves in the first place? The answers to these are beyond the scope of thisbook, (although I'll be attempting to touch on them from time to time to putsome of the other contents into a full perspective.) For me, the process ofserious questioning which had begun in 2007/08, reached a peak in September2010, and again, this was on a trip to New York City.In the midst of my typically hectic lifestyle, I was able to take four days outthat month to visit Niagara Falls, along with a quick stop in Manhattan. Thehours spent travelling gave me the enforced downtime I needed to get somequality reading done, and on the agenda was David Icke's new book 'Human RaceGet Off Your Knees: The Lion Sleeps No More'. Like the earlier Hancock book,this one was a life-changer by any standards, and although I was alreadyfamiliar with much of the material, there came a point where it felt as if alight bulb had gone on in my head, suddenly illuminating great truths which hadbeen hidden just out of sight in the darkness up to that point. I later came torealise that I had undergone what so many refer to as a 'conscious awakening'.It was a raising of my personal vibratory frequency out of the depths of baseconsciousness, to a higher state of awareness. Once you achieve this, you startto access the part of you that goes beyond the physical body into the realms ofpure source consciousness, of which we are all individual expressions.Again, these are all terms which, I fully appreciate, will sound utterly alienand 'out there' to anyone new to the subject. But there are a great manyscholars in these subject areas who can explain the concept far better than Ican, and an infinite number of resources for anyone who wants to delve into it.It became clear that my experience was far from unique, and there is somethingabout this point in the human timeline in which those of us alive today arehaving our experiences, which is causing vast numbers of people to 'wake up,'remember who they are and where they have come from, and to gain a newperspective on truths which have been deliberately veiled and cloaked from thebulk of humanity for aeons.An article I found posted on the Above Top Secret website forum(http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread715284/pg1[http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread715284/pg1]) put it very well:\"Folks, whatever you may believe, I hope you understand that the people who havethe most gold make the rules. If you want to connect the dots, you will not findthe necessary information from the mainstream media. In order to come to gripswith this incredibly profound truth, you must first be de-programmed.\" . . . After maybe 100 hours of reading and listening to these serious truthresearchers and learning about what is really happening you may be sufficientlyde-programmed to both understand and accept the real truth about the evil rulingelites running our planet.\"Hopefully, when enough people know the truth, the power in this truth willestablish the morality, justice, and freedom human beings should have.\"AN OBLIGATION TO TRUTHIt took a while for me to mentally compute the 'awakening' process. But despitemany initial doubts, the confirmations that I was on the right road were allaround me, and my experiences were validated by so many other people who Ibecame synchronistically connected with. After a while of quietly walking thisnew path, an instinctive feeling of responsibility to start communicating toothers what I had started to learn swept over me. As so many who have undergonesimilar experiences have surmised, anyone coming to an understanding of greattruths, takes on with it an obligation to communicate that knowledge. It's anobligation that comes from the creative force behind the universe, (which isvery different from the assorted 'gods' of the man-made religions,) of which weare all individualised expressions.And this is the stumbling block for so many. As has been frequently pointed out,one of the greatest mental prison cells that people can find themselves in isthe fear of what other people might think. Some have less to lose than others incoming right out and saying what needs to be said, however, regardless of thelikely response from family, friends, employers or others.My process of awakening, then, led to me understanding how certain facets of themusic industry of which I'd been a part, were an important piece in the overalljigsaw puzzle of the real control system. Going back to the earlier hypothesisof a malevolent international elite wishing to control all aspects of human lifeand mentality, having taken the time and trouble to shape religions,governments, the financial system, all the major worldwide corporations, theworld of science, the military, and the educational and academicestablishments . . . why would they possibly miss out one of the greatestopportunities for mass mind control and social manipulation that is offered bycomplete control of the entertainment industry – movies, television, and – myspecial area of interest – the corporate-controlled mainstream music industry?They haven't, of course. And, given that communicating the truth becomes a moralobligation of anyone coming to gain an understanding of it, here's where ourstory begins."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Mark Devlin's debut book 'Tales From The Flipside' at Authorhouse: * http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000227787 [http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000227787]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2NOTHING NEW UNDER THE SUNThe early days of the music industry machine.\"For, you see, the world is governed by very different personages from what isimagined by those who are not behind the scenes.\"Benjamin Disraeli, British Prime Minister, 1874-1880\"By now, more and more people become aware of that this world is, to a majordegree, controlled by a secret cabal we call the Illuminati, a Shadow Governmentif you will . . . They have already taken over a big part of world politics,business, education and religious movements. This fact is accepted by many,because the evidence is overwhelming. So why would this cabal, who wants totalcontrol and the ability to take over our minds and thinking processes, leave thefilm and music industries alone?\"Wes Penre, Illuminati News article, 2008The dark manipulations of the music business are as old as the industry itself,and early examples of the dubious calling cards evident in the contemporaryscene are equally present in its formative years. Mind-control, military'intelligence', paedophilia and occult fascination are, it seems, nothing new.THE 'KING' OF ROCK AND ROLLA good starting point, then, would appear to be with the first world superstarof popular music. Elvis Presley stands as a classic example of an artistmanufactured by the industry machine, and whose entire persona was carefullycrafted. US President Jimmy Carter stated after Presley's death that he had\"permanently changed the face of American popular culture\". This, apparently,was the plan.Elvis' eventual wife, Priscilla, was just 14 when they met. According toWikipedia:\"Elvis and Priscilla met on September 13, 1959, during a party at Elvis' home inBad Nauheim, Germany, while he was serving in the army. Despite her being 14years old, she made a huge impression on Elvis with her much older appearance.\"This in itself is no proof of illegal sexual activity, of course. Presleybiographer Albert Goldman didn't mince his words in declaring him to be a'paedophile' and 'pervert', however.In her own book, 'Elvis and Me', Priscilla insists that even though she andPresley engaged in heavy petting and kissing, they always stopped before it ledto intercourse, claiming they waited until their wedding night in 1967. Veryrestrained.The circumstances surrounding Presley's death do not disappoint either, andrival any of the later stories involving the exits of Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrixor Michael Jackson. Music lore has it that a heavily bloated and sick Elvis diedin his bathroom at Gracelands, (on the toilet, according to most accounts,) on16th August 1977, (which just happened to be Madonna's 19th birthday.) The causeof death was attributed to a heart attack brought on by heavy drug use and poordiet. In an early example of a musical 'conspiracy theory,' there have beenseveral alleged sightings of Presley since 1977, amid rumours that he faked hisown death to escape the public spotlight and live out his remaining yearsquietly.It has to be acknowledged that much of this could be down to denial andcognitive dissonance; fans form a very personal connection to their heroes, andthe idea that they have gone can be too hard for some to acknowledge.Nevertheless, this doesn't alter the fact that there are some strange factorsthat require debunking before the official version of events can be comfortablyaccepted. Presley's demise was echoed in 'Orion,' a novel by Gail Brewer-Giorgioabout a Southern-based superstar who fakes his own death, her story having beeninspired by the newspaper coverage of Presley's death. Giorgio states that,shortly after her book's initial publication, she started getting calls advisingthat the book had become unavailable from the retail stores. In one case, therewas an account of two businessmen in suits buying up all copies from a shop inPennsylvania. Giorgio says that her distributor had told her he'd been orderedto withdraw the book by the publisher, despite her having been paid a healthyadvance. (Identical problems of publisher interference were reported years laterby Alan Power, author of 'The Diana Conspiracy,' alleging that MI6 were behindPrincess Diana's murder, acting upon the direct instructions of Prince Philip.Do you think he upset someone?)Strangely, the same thing was experienced simultaneously by Monty Nicholson,author of the book 'The Presley Arrangement,' which investigated some of theanomalies concerning Elvis's apparent death, such as an allegedly doctoredautopsy and the disappearance of photographs, medical notes and toxicologyreports. This joins claims from witnesses that the body in the casket did notresemble Presley. Some attested that it appeared to have a fake glued-onhairpiece, the nose was the wrong shape, and there were beads of sweat on theface.Maria Columbus, co-president of the oldest Elvis Presley fan club, spoke toPresley's father shortly after the death announcement.\"He asked us not to come out, said that he wanted us to come to Memphis a weeklater. He said that it was too hectic, too many people, the press was there, andthat it would be more quiet and beneficial for us to talk to him a week later.So we agreed.\"We arrived the next week, and there was a whole feeling of make-believe, not ofreality. When we went to the mausoleum there was the atmosphere of a carnival.There were people selling popcorn and soft drinks, people standing in front ofthe mausoleum posing for pictures with the security guards. It felt like it wasa game, and we didn't feel like Elvis' spirit was there. It felt like acoldness. Like a joke.\"There have also been stories of missing cheques, jewellery and a private jet,and the cashing in of only two of the three life assurance policies. And furtherintrigue comes from claims that the handwriting on the death certificate matchedElvis' own, as verified by handwriting experts.This occurred amidst revelations that Elvis had long been an undercover agentfor the US intelligence services, the police departments of several cities, andthe Drug Enforcement Agency. His enthusiasm for his law enforcement activities,and the difficulty of maintaining these alongside his public fame, is cited asone of the reasons for his death hoax, so that he could quietly be inducted intothe Witness Protection Programme. Other more ambitious theories exist, too, suchas that of the website http://elvistruth.wordpress.com[http://elvistruth.wordpress.com]/, which alleges that Elvis' newly-deceasedbody was taken to the secret Area 51 base in Nevada, where government scientistsused cryogenics, homeopathy and a blood transfusion to re-establish his lifeforce, then applied plastic surgery to alter his appearance!Whatever the truth concerning Elvis' 'death' – and who can honestly claim toknow for sure what that is? – it demonstrates that suspicion and scepticism overofficial versions of events were just as rife in decades past as they are now.As long ago as the 1960s there was widespread public doubt over what we weretold about the deaths of John F Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe, and the Apollo moonlandings too.BUDDY HOLLY, THE BIG BOPPER, RICHIE VALENS, EDDIE COCHRAN AND THE RESTIn the same way that the fortunes of the Kennedy political dynasty have beensaid to be cursed, an air of doom-laden misfortune also seems to surround thestory of 1950s rocker Buddy Holly. It seems to extend beyond the fateful nightof 3rd February 1959 when he and fellow musicians The Big Bopper and RichieValens died in a plane crash, being synchronistically entangled with the fatesof many other characters associated with the rockers. The intricate story isbest told in this thorough article from the Angelfire website: * http://www.angelfire.com/music5/archives/curseofholly.html [http://www.angelfire.com/music5/archives/curseofholly.html]ALL KNOWN VICESThe early British music industry of the 1950s and 1960s is infested with storiesof paedophilia, sexual deviancy, drug abuse, extortion, and organised crime on ascale that would be right at home within the political establishment of thepresent day. Synchronicity rears its head in many of these stories, too, with abaffling array of links and apparent 'coincidences' between the key players.Acknowledgement must go here to an unpublished article written by theex-intelligence operative known as T Stokes, (and later expanded upon by Britishwriter Chris Spivey.) This unveiled a fascinating and sinister web linking,among many others, record producers Robert Stigwood and Kit Lambert, Labour MPTom Driberg, and the Tory peer Lord Boothby. (Hold tight because we're going tomeet a fair few 'Lords' and 'Sirs' in this story!) The notorious Kray twins arepresent in the saga, which is steeped in the London criminal underworld, andinvolves blackmail, shotgun murders, the discovery of rent boy Bernard Oliver'sbody in a suitcase, 'suicides' and the ever-present influence of AleisterCrowley. (Much more of him later, too!)According to a blog article on the UK's Aangirfan website, The Krays may wellhave been mind-control victims themselves, (twins were often favoured in earlyexperiments conducted by Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.) They were known for theirsudden moodswings from placid and urbane to violent and psychopathic, in keepingwith multiple personality disorders. Aangirfan suggests they were put to use inLondon's criminal underworld in the 60s, and involved with the procurement ofchildren for the same elite paedophile rings we see today. They had links to keycharacters in the music industry, including BBC DJs Jimmy Savile and Alan'Fluff' Freeman, producer Joe Meek and Beatles manager Brian Epstein. The Krayswere said to be 'crypto-Jews,' those of Jewish genealogy who prefer to keep thisaspect of their background hidden from the public, often changing their surnameto disguise their roots.Another key figure is David 'Lord' Sutch, a pioneer of the British pirate radioscene of the 1960s, and later a parliamentary candidate, who just happened todie in mysterious circumstances in 1999, aged 58. The paedophile artist GrahamOvenden and 'Sergeant Pepper' sleeve artist Peter Blake also make appearances,as does former Bee Gee Robin Gibb. In several cases, the males concerned turnout to have been homosexual, and/ or paedophiles, and in certain cases,Satanists.It also has to be pointed out that, throughout the back story of the mainstreammusic industry, on both sides of the Atlantic, a hugely out-of-proportion numberof the key players are of Jewish background. Because of the mechanisms in placeto instantly demonise as 'anti-semitic' those who question anyone who happens tobe Jewish – regardless of whether the inquiries have any foundation or not –this is a factor which is rarely discussed. But it's neither slander norconjecture to point out the large number of Jewish individuals in theentertainment industry. It's a provable fact. Why would this be when Jewishpeople make up such a small proportion of British and American society in theaggregate? If such vast numbers of, say, Swedish or Portuguese people justhappened to populate an industry so abundantly, against all the odds, peoplewould surely find it strange and ask why it should be. I think the questionremains equally valid when it comes to the Jewish influence. The same could alsobe said of the large number of homosexuals in the business – again, way out ofproportion to the ratio in society generally, (and it's not 'homophobic' topoint this particular fact out, either!) Indeed, a popular quote attributed toJohn Lennon runs: \"Only queers and Jews can get on in showbiz.\"Two other factors wildly out of proportion to the average are the sheer numberof sudden deaths attributed to either 'suicide' or 'accidental overdoses.'A couple of T Stokes' articles containing some of the information, reside at thefollowing domains: * http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=13451 [http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=13451] * http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=36860 [http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=36860]Chris Spivey's much-expanded (and highy recommended) rework of the original TStokes article is here: * http://chrisspivey.org/sutch-as-it-is-based-on-the-unpublished-t-stokes-article-who-murdered-screaming-lord-sutch/#comment-172748 [http://chrisspivey.org/sutch-as-it-is-based-on-the-unpublished-t-stokes-article-who-murdered-screaming-lord-sutch/#comment-172748]The work of T Stokes also appeared on the UK investigative blog site Aangirfanin 2012, in an article which included the following information:\"At a big London railway station in the spring of 1970, a plastic carrier bagwas found in the regular search for bombs before the station closed for thenight. The contents were an odd assortment of letters and photos, which seemedto have been taken at a kinky party attended by some well-known figures inentertainment.\"One in particular showed a pop singer who masquerades under a Christianpersona; dressed in women’s underwear, he was pictured with young boys.\"The bag was duly taken to the station office, and as a senior rail worker wroteout a report for the lost property office, two MI5 men and a special branchofficer arrived and demanded the photos.\"The pop singer in question had even threatened to commit suicide if the photoswere released.\"However MI5 passed one particular letter from the bag to the tax authorities,because it seemed to indicate that the three brothers who had a virtual monopolyover Britain’s entertainment industry were short-changing the taxman.\"The brothers – Bernard Delfont, and Lew and Leslie Grade (Winogradsky) – had astranglehold over stage and screen appearances in Britain and gave preference toJewish stars and promoters. Such were the amounts involved that fellow Jews theKray twins were asked to launder much of the money in clubs and fixed boxingmatches, gambling and other dubious enterprises.\"The Aangirfan blog articles can be found here: * http://aangirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/jimmy-savile-kray-twins-cliff-richards.html [http://aangirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/jimmy-savile-kray-twins-cliff-richards.html] * http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/cliff-richard-rolf-harris-jimmy-savile.html [http://aanirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2015/08/cliff-richard-rolf-harris-jimmy-savile.html]'WHITE' CLIFF?A very prominent character in the early British music scene is Cliff Richard,often dubbed 'the British Elvis'.Richard was born Harry Webb in India in 1940, reportedly of British andpart-Spanish ancestry, settling in England in 1948. His recording career beganten years later with 'Move It', and his early releases saw him coupled with TheShadows as his backing band. He started out with a rebellious rock-and-rollimage suited to the times, largely modelled on Elvis, before re-inventinghimself as a Christian singer in the 1960s, at which point his output switchedto a middle-of-the-road style, earning him a legion of middle-aged, largelyfemale fans. He opted for a more edgy rock image in the 70s with the the single'Devil Woman' and a handful of others, before focusing his attention on regular,profitable Christmas appearances with the likes of 'Mistletoe And Wine,''Saviour's Day' and 'The Millennium Prayer.' Richard made the history books bybecoming the only artist to have ever scored a UK number one single in fiveconsecutive decades, a feat that seems unlikely to ever be repeated.Richard was appointed a Knight Bachelor by the Queen in 1995, achieving his'Sir' status.On 14th August 2014, Richard's £3-million penthouse home in Sunningdale,Berkshire was raided by police in his absence. Media reports claimed that thiswas in connection with an alleged sexual assault on a 15-year-old boy at a'Christian' rally in Sheffield involving the US celebrity evangelist BillyGraham, and dating back to 1985. Richard subsequently returned from his vineyardhome in Portugal's Algarve to be questioned by police. Although reports lateremerged that the alleged victim had contacted the police well over a year beforein the wake of the TV documentary exposing Savile, Richard was released withoutarrest or charge, insisting upon his innocence. By August of the following year,however, South Yorkshire Police advised that the number of alleged offences byRichard that they were now investigating had risen to three, both in the UK andabroad.The BBC was publicly criticised for its apparent advance knowledge of the raid,when it already had a camera crew in place to record the arrival of police.Because of this, the search and the related questioning was said to have been'compromised,' preventing the normal course of action in such cases from takingplace. Conveniently for Sir Cliff, the BBC's 'bungle' saw him walk awayscot-free. Richard announced some three months later that he planned to sue theBBC and demand damages.Although the incident only raised further suspicion within the alternativecommunity as to what the real story was, it seemed to have little effect onRichard's mainstream image. A consortium of fans, rallying to their hero'ssupport, started a campaign to get his 1992 song 'I Still Believe In You' backinto the Top 40. It managed a showing at number 57 for one week in late August2014. Seemingly benefiting further from the ardent support of his fans, Richardwent on to announce a world tour in 2015 to mark his 75th birthday, despite hisspokesperson claiming at the time that the police incident had caused his career'irreparable damage,' and his lawyer claiming he had suffered 'immeasurableharm.' For some inexplicable reason, Morrissey, former frontman of The Smiths,was due to tour with Cliff in 2014, a partnership that sounds about ascompatible as that of Buju Banton and Liberace, but the gigs were called-offfollowing Morrissey's unfortunate announcement that he had developed cancer. Anequally unlikely pairing had come from Sir Cliff's 12-date tour of Germanyalongside Boy George. The previous year, George had been imprisoned for theassault and false imprisonment of a male escort.In his early years as a singer, Richard was closely linked to the Tory peer LordRobert Boothby, a prominent MP from the 30s through to the 60s. ('Lords' and'Sirs' tend to move in close circles, it would appear,) and portrayed ratherunflatteringy in the 2015 Kray Twins biopic 'Legend.' Boothby kept eclecticcompany; he was also an associate of both Ronnie Kray and Winston Churchill,with all three reported to have been homosexual paedophiles.Richard himself also had an association with the Kray twins, particularly RonnieKray, and was an associate of Jimmy Savile. Richard appeared on the firstepisode of 'Top Of The Pops,' hosted by Savile, in January 1964. Anotherlong-standing friendship was with Cilla Black. Interestingly she changed hername from Priscilla White at the start of her career. Readers can decide forthemselves given the hidden nature of the entertainment industry, whether therewas any symbolic relevance to trading 'white' for 'black.' Richard and Blackboth had BBC television shows during the 1960s and 1970s, and each wouldregularly guest on the other's programme. Cilla Black was also a long-standingfriend of Jimmy Savile. She remained noticeably silent upon the revelations ofSavile's historic paedophilia, but did rally to the defence of her old pal Cliffduring his brush with the law. She said in a statement: \"Cliff is a very closefriend of mine and has been for a million years. I, like everyone else, wasshocked to hear of these allegations and I am absolutely positive that they arewithout foundation.\" She also spoke of her 'disappointment' over Rolf Harris'conviction for indecently assaulting young girls, stating: \"I've never knownRolf be any different to anyone else. I thought he was lovely.\" Cilla Black isone of a few who passed away during the writing of this book. With 50 years in'showbiz,' who knows what other secrets she took to the grave with her?Interestingly, Leslie Grade, father of the TV executive Michael Grade, was CliffRichard's talent agent for many years. Lew Grade was the founder of ATV, one ofthe regional franchises of the newly-created ITV television network, on whichRichard hosted an entertainment show in the early 1960s. Lew Grade was knightedin 1969.In the wake of the house raid incident, it was reported that Cliff would beselling his Berkshire home, and would now spend all his time in the BritishCommonwealth island of Barbados, of which he had obtained citizenship. Tony andCherie Blair are among the guests reported to have stayed at his home there.According to a 2006 story on the politics.co.uk [http://politics.co.uk] website,Cliff offered to lend his home to Blair after seeing him looking \"dwindled andhaggard\" during the Iraq war. How very Christian. The Berkshire property salewas completed in May 2015, in the same week as the announcement that thepolice's Operation Hydrant was investigating more than 1,400 men in the UK overclaims of historic sexual abuse. Of these, 261 were said to be 'high-profile'individuals, with 76 politicians, and 43 connected to the music industry.ELTON AND ALEISTERAnother titan of British rock with an intriguing background, and a long andsuccessful career to match, is Reginald Dwight of Harrow, better known as 'Sir'Elton John. He is one of several artists of his era that has expressed afascination with the occultist Aleister Crowley and ritual magick. Some of hissongs, such as 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road', are also said to have been writtenin 'witch language.'The late US record industry whistleblower John Todd, who we'll encounter againlater in this story, stated in a testimony:\"Now, much of the music is written in witch language by witches. Elton John hasmade the statement that he has never written a song that was not written inwitch language. That is why many songs you don't understand. That is why manypeople who listen to them don't understand. Until they get high on drugs, andthen all of a sudden the meanings start coming to them.\"This seems to be a variation on the phenomenon of 'automatic writing', where anindividual makes a connection with an off-world spirit, which uses their body tochannel through certain information from the spirit realm. Participants havetalked of being given words and phrases so fast that they are unable tocomprehend them as they come, only to write down what they receive as fast aspossible. Only afterwards are they able to try and deduce any meaning from whatthey have written. Sometimes the writing is clear, other times it is seeminglynonsensical, but may well include cryptically encoded messages. Many rock songsin music history are said to have been written in this way. David Bowie hastalked of assembling songs by cutting up pages from newspapers, thenre-attaching the shreds at random and basing his lyrics on whatever phrasesemerge, which sounds like an interesting variation on the phenomenon. KurtCobain of Nirvana and Thom Yorke of Radiohead are also said to have used thetechnique for some of their popular songs.Bernie Taupin, John's co-writer, has said that \"John's home is laden withtrinkets and books relating to Satanism and witchcraft.\" Just the household fortwo young babies to be raised by two homosexual adult males in then. (John andhis partner David Furnish adopted two baby boys named Zachary and Elijah, makingfor a rather unconventional domestic set up.)In 1999, John caused controversy by performing at a charity concert with dancersdressed as boy scouts, subsequently forcing them to strip. He was joined onstage by George Michael. John Fogg, a spokesman for the Scout Association, saidat the time:“We think it is pretty deplorable and in bad taste in terms of denigrating ouruniform and what it stands for. We are disappointed that someone of Sir Elton’sstanding should involve himself in something of such poor taste. It linkedhomosexuality with paedophilia. If Stonewall are completely for the rights ofhomosexual people, they have not done themselves any favours.”The issue of paedophilia rears its head again when it comes to John's artisticand photographic preferences. As the excellent UK website The Coleman Experiencereported in its 2014 article 'Elton John's Mysterious Meltdown':\"In a little reported incident, Elton John was stopped and searched at anairport in 2007. A paedophilic photograph was confiscated from his person.John’s excuse was that the photograph was part of an art exhibition. The photoin question was amateurish and any real photographer would be able to point outthe elementary technical mistakes, but John’s name gives it ‘status’ as socalled ‘art.'\"He is also known to collect ‘artwork’ by convicted sex-offender GrahamOvenden.\"And this article by Chris Spivey raises some highly pertinent questions abouthow John and Furnish, who married on the Winter Solstice in 2014, were so easilyable to adopt two baby boys, given John's history of promiscuous sexualactivity, (with album titles like 'Captain Fantastic And The Brown Dirt Cowboy'it's not like he didn't offer the odd clue,) his close association with knownpaedophiles, his collection of art by paedophile painters including depictionsof naked children, his background in dark occultism, and his status as anotorious alcoholic and drug addict. As Spivey observes, had John and Furnishbeen a regular working class non-celebrity couple, does anyone believe theywould have got the green light for adoption, or that the boys wouldn't have beenseized by Social Services and placed into 'care?' It seems membership of the'Sir' club is the gift that just keeps on giving. * http://chrisspivey.org/something-about-the-way-you-look-tonight/ [http://chrisspivey.org/something-about-the-way-you-look-tonight/]FOR PETE'S SAKEThe same broad subject area crops up in the story of The Who. Guitarist PeteTownshend was famously arrested for viewing on-line child porn in 1999. As theDaily Mail reported:\"He insisted at the time that he had simply been conducting ‘research’ when hepaid £7 with his credit card in 1999 to access a website bearing the message‘click here for child porn’.\"Despite his denials of harbouring depraved desires, he accepted a policecaution, and was duly placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years.\"Later, Townshend claimed to The Times newspaper that he paid for childpornography to prove that British banks were complicit in channelling theprofits from paedophile rings.He offered a different explanation in a statement at the time of his arrest,however:\"I have been writing my childhood autobiography for the past seven years. Ibelieve I was sexually abused between the age of five and six-and-a-half when inthe care of my maternal grandmother who was mentally ill at the time. I cannotremember clearly what happened, but my creative work tends to throw up nastyshadows – particularly in 'Tommy.'Elsewhere in his interview with The Times newspaper, Townshend stated:\"I had experienced something creepy as a child, so you imagine, what if I was agirl of nine or ten and my uncle had raped me every week? I felt I had anunderstanding, and I could help.''The Who are perhaps best known for their rock opera 'Tommy,' made into a KenRussell-directed movie in 1975. This featured the titular character, a deaf,dumb and blind kid played by Roger Daltrey, (MBE,) being sexually abused by apaedophile babysitter, 'Uncle' Ernie, played by drummer Keith Moon. Almost fourdecades later, it emerged that (Sir) Jimmy Savile had been sexually abusingdisabled and paralysed children at Stoke Mandeville Hospital.ALL THAT GLITTERS . . . Gary Glitter, meanwhile, (born Paul Gadd in Banbury, Oxfordshire,) is an artistwho could be said to be way ahead of his time in getting arrested on childpornography charges as long ago as 1997. According to Wikipedia:\"In November 1997, Glitter was arrested after pornographic images of childrenwere discovered on the hard drive of a Toshiba laptop that he had taken forrepair to a branch of PC World at Cribbs Causeway, near Bristol.\"In 1999, Glitter was sentenced to four months' imprisonment and listed as a sexoffender in the UK following conviction for downloading thousands of items ofchild pornography.\"He was also charged with having sex with an underage girl, Alison Brown, around20 years earlier, when she was 14 years old.\"Glitter went on to reside in Cambodia, before being deported to Vietnam as aresult of suspected child abuse. Wikipedia reports that:\"From March 2005, Glitter resided in Vũng Tàu, Vietnam. In late 2005, at age 61,Gary Glitter was arrested by Vietnamese authorities and charged with molestingtwo underaged girls, aged 10 and 11, at his home in Vũng Tàu. He initially facedpossible child rape charges carrying the death penalty, but prosecutors did notfind enough evidence for those charges, so Glitter was instead tried for lesserchild sexual abuse charges. Early in 2006, he was convicted of committingobscene acts with minors and sentenced to three years imprisonment.\"On his eventual return to the UK in 2008, after years of residing in Asia,Glitter was placed on the Sex Offenders' register for life.Glitter's Wikipedia entry goes on to detail his alleged links with Savile andthe BBC sex scandal:\"In October 2012, ITV showed the documentary 'The Other Side of Jimmy Savile' inits 'Exposure' strand. The story developed and extended over the ensuing weeks,and included an accusation against Glitter. He was alleged to have been seenhaving sex with a 13 or 14-year-old girl in Savile's dressing room at the BBC.\"A clip from Glitter's vintage appearance on ITV's 'This Is Your Life'subsequently appeared on Youtube, and turned out to be quite revealing inretrospect. Guest Tessa Dahl relates an anecdote about her sister bringingadolescent girls in school uniform to meet Glitter, at which point he toucheshis neck nervously and whispers 'sssshhh!' to her. You can view the clip here: * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OZTB03azM [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OZTB03azM]And this clip of Glitter guesting on Savile's 'Clunk Click' programme on theBBC, with their arms around assorted children, speaks for itself. Right there inplain sight. * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Hx7Q2oC5U [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Hx7Q2oC5U]Either way, you know something's gone wrong with your life when your name getsadopted in your homeland as crude rhyming slang for a craphouse, (\"Gary Glitter\"= \"shitter\".)JIMMY JIMMYLed Zeppelin were a group that picked up the term 'devil rockers' in the 1970s,owing to their flirtation with dark occult and esoteric imagery in their recordsleeves and stage shows. (See the chapter on Backmasking for some interestingdetail on their flagship song 'Stairway To Heaven.') They were also keen on harddrugs and extreme sex and provided more than a little inspiration for theclassic spoof rockumentary 'This Is Spinal Tap'. Guitarist Jimmy Page was happyto admit an infatuation with occultist Aleister Crowley and his works, tellingSounds Magazine in a 1978 interview: \"I feel Aleister Crowley is a misunderstoodgenius of the 20th century.\" Page had a variation on Crowley's famous 'do whatthou wilt shall be the whole of the law' quote inscribed into the vinyl of hisgroup's third album 'Led Zeppelin III,' which read: 'Do what thou wilt. So moteit be'. For a time Page owned an occult bookshop and publishing house, TheEquinox Booksellers and Publishers, in London's Kensington High Street. Keepingthe theme of paedophilia and ritual sex magick alive, (although seeminglypreferring girls to the usual choice of boys), Page embarked on a sexual affairwith a 14-year-old Los Angeles groupie, Lori Maddox, known popularly as LoriLightning.As an article on the website stryder.de [http://stryder.de] explains:\"According to Lori, after Jimmy tried and failed several times to get togetherwith her, Jimmy had Led Zeppelin's tour manager 'kidnap' Lori and bring her backto the Continental Hyatt, the hotel where Led Zeppelin was staying. Lori wasbrought to Jimmy's room, where as she described in the Led Zeppelin book 'HammerOf The Gods': 'It was dimly lit by candles . . . and Jimmy was just sittingthere in a corner, wearing this hat slouched over his eyes and holding a cane.It was really mysterious and weird. He looked just like a gangster. It wasmagnificent!'\"That night, Jimmy and Lori began a torrid affair, but they had to keep theirrelationship a secret from the public since Lori was underage and Jimmy was atrisk of being arrested.\"Page was already in a relationship with another groupie, Pamela Des Barres, atthe time of meeting Maddox on the group's 1972 tour. Page reportedly dumpedMaddox around a year and a half later after taking up with yet another groupie,Bebe Buell, at the same time as seemingly maintaining a long relationship withFrench model Charlotte Martin, who had earlier dated Eric Clapton.Page wasn't the first in line with Maddox, however. That dubious honour seems tohave fallen to David Bowie, to whom she is said to have lost her virginity atthe age of 13. Maddox admits to the affair in the VH1 documentary, 'Let's SpendThe Night Together', (available on Youtube,) while interviewed by Pamela DesBarres, her former love rival. Maddox states that Bowie 'was very gentle with meknowing it was my first time.' Elsewhere she states that the Bowie experiencepre-dated her time with Page.If Maddox was 13 when she was deflowered by Bowie, (who, like Page, has alsoexpressed infatuation with the works of Aleister Crowley,) this evokes anearlier unsavoury musical relationship. American rock & roller Jerry Lee Lewismarried his 13-year-old cousin, Myra Gale Brown, when he was 22. It was thethird of Lewis' seven marriages, and lasted 13 years. (The first was to a17-year-old when he himself was 13, so presumably any paedophilia present herewas inflicted on him.) Lewis and his management insisted that Brown was actually15 (because it makes all the difference, right?) but the resulting controversyled to the cancellation of Lewis' British tour of 1958. He encountered similarhostility back home when his records were dropped from radio playlists, andinterviews and other shows cancelled.Lewis' scenario – though lacking much of the moral judgement that he underwent –was later echoed by Bill Wyman of the Rolling Stones, when he embarked on anaffair with child model Mandy Smith in 1983, when he was 47 and she was 13. In alater interview, Smith admitted to having sex with Wyman from the age of 14.They married in 1989, divorcing two years later. (That's a surprise.) Smith hadalways been presented as being older than her years, but when the truth abouttheir sexual relations emerged, Wyman says he voluntarily contacted the police,but was told they 'weren't interested' in pursuing it.ALEISTER CROWLEY, ROCK STARIn so many ways, Crowley was the original rock star, with ritual sex magick andmind-altering drugs ever-present in his life story. Crowley's influence on, orassociations with The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Page and Jay-Z arewell-documented. His deification by pop culture goes much further, however. TheDoors' '13' album sleeve shows the band posing with a ceramic bust of Crowley,Stephen Tyler of Aerosmith has talked of practicing Crowley magick, and FrankZappa and Sting have both been students of his works. Russell Brand has publiclyquoted him, while Kanye West, taking a day off from the Baphomet designs, hasworn a necklace depicting the aeon of Horus, as espoused in Crowley's teachings.'American Idol' singer Adam Lambert, Kevin Jonas of The Jonas Brothers andsinger and actress Taylor Momsen are among those to have been recently picturedsporting Crowley T-shirts. 'Brave New World' author and eugenicist Aldous Huxleywas a personal friend of Crowley, as was James Bond creator Ian Fleming, and LSDguru and CIA agent Dr. Timothy Leary talked of continuing his work during the1960s counter-culture era.Ozzy Osbourne called Crowley “a phenomenon of his time,” and recorded a songcalled 'Mr. Crowley.' David Bowie referred to Crowley in his song 'Quicksand'from the album 'The Man Who Sold the World.' Graham Bond claimed to be Crowley’sillegitimate son and recorded albums of what have been said to be satanicrituals with his band Holy Magick. Iron Maiden's famous song 'The Number Of TheBeast' is thought to be in part-reference to Crowley's self-imposed moniker.Daryl Hall of the duo Hall & Oates reportedly owns a signed and numbered copy of'The Book Of Thoth' and has said in interview: \"I was fascinated by him(Crowley) because his personality was the late-nineteenth-century equivalent ofmine – a person brought up in a conventionally religious family who dideverything he could to outrage the people around him as well as himself.\" Churchof Satan priest Marilyn Manson's song 'Misery Machine' includes the line 'We’regonna ride to the Abbey of Thelema.' Perhaps the most surprising endorsementcame from Barack Obama during his 2012 presidential campaign, in which aphotograph showed him hugging a young boy, and wearing a T-shirt with Crowley'sface on it and the slogan AC2012. Some have suggested that the picture is aphoto-shopped fake, but the general consensus among those that have examined itscientifically is that it was genuine and part of the campaign known as 'AC2012'which resides here – http://ac2012.com [http://ac2012.com]/Either way, in spite of an extremely colourful and extraordinary life, Crowleydied a bankrupt heroin addict in December 1947. Perhaps surprisingly in thecircumstances, a BBC poll in 2002 cited Crowley as the 73rd Greatest Briton ofall time, as voted for by viewers."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:(The URLs given are obviously clunky to re-type when not reading on-line.

Beneath the pomp and pageantry lies a network ofpaedophilic depravity so vile and despicable, it literally beggars belief.\"Don’t be fooled into thinking Jimmy Savile was an isolated case either. Hewasn’t.\"SAVILE AND 'AUNTIE' BEEBThe British Broadcasting Corporation, a propaganda arm for the BritishEstablishment, has itself been up to its neck in vice during recent times. Theactivities of Jimmy Savile as a serial child-rapist have been well-documentedsince his exposure in October 2012, a year after his death at the age of 85. Therevelations came from a documentary, 'Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile,'researched and presented by Mark Williams-Thomas, which was screened in the UKby ITV on 3rd October 2012.Williams-Thomas was originally a consultant for the BBC's 'Newsnight' programme,which had started investigating the claims against Savile for an episode of theshow. This was reported to have been shelved at the eleventh hour by BBCmanagement, however, as it would have conflicted with the schedule of programmesthe Corporation had lined up for that Christmas celebrating Savile's life,including a tribute episode of 'Jim'll Fix It' presented by a sycophantic ShaneRichie, (Alfie Moon in 'Eastenders.') Despite evidence of Savile's crimes havingbeen presented, this and other tributes still went on to be broadcast at the endof 2011.Savile was employed by the BBC for several decades, as the host of twolong-running and highly prominent TV shows, 'Top Of The Pops' and 'Jim'll FixIt', (what some relevance to that title there turned out to be given that Savilewas subsequently exposed as a procurer of children to rich and famouspaedophiles,) as well as for many years as a DJ on BBC Radio 1. The Savileexposure revealed how he had been sexually abusing children unimpeded for years,with some of the offences having taken place in his BBC dressing room. Thesuggestion that this could have gone on for so long without the knowledge ofsenior BBC management is inconceivable, particularly with 'celebrities' such asEsther Rantzen, Terry Wogan, (who was reported to have died from cancer on 31stJanuary 2016,) Bill Oddie, Noel Edmonds and Paul Gambaccini having acknowledgedrecently that Savile being a 'kiddie fiddler' was an 'open secret' within theCorporation. For Savile's 80th birthday, Prince Charles sent him a pair of goldcufflinks engraved with the words: 'No-one will ever know what you have done forthis country, Jimmy.' At Savile's funeral, prior to his crimes being madepublic, former boxer Frank Bruno, (who Savile had introduced to his friend PeterSutcliffe, aka The Yorkshire Ripper,) remarked that Savile had done 'a lot ofgood, special things that people don't even know' and that Savile 'helped me ina lot of ways that I can't really talk about on the television.' In June 2000,comedian Frank Skinner made what seemed to be a knowing reference to Savile'spenchant for necrophilia in a live show. In a 1978 interview, Sex Pistolsfrontman Johnny Rotten remarked that he'd like to kill Jimmy Savile, saying: 'Ibet he's into all kinds of seediness that we all know about but we're notallowed to talk about,' adding, 'I know some rumours!' The general public, itseems, were the last to know.In addition, James Anderton, the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police,is reported to have warned the BBC back in 1975 that several of theirperformers, including Savile, had been named as using teenage boys who werebeing sold for sex in the Canal Street area of Manchester. Despite this, noformer director of the BBC has been called on to address the subject byOperation Yewtree, the exercise in damage limitation that was hastily set up inthe wake of the scandal.Elsewhere, Savile was discovered to have abused children at the hospitals atwhich he 'volunteered', including disabled children in the spinal injuries unitof Stoke Mandeville hospital, and inmates at Broadmoor Psychiatric Hospital. Hewas also exposed as a necrophiliac, having had sex with dead bodies in themortuary of Leeds General Infirmary where he 'volunteered' as a night porter, (aclaim made by fellow Radio 1 DJ Paul Gambaccini . . . before he himself wasarrested on suspicion of historical sexual offences, but later released withoutcharge.) Apparently no-one in BBC senior management had the slightest clue.Neither did the Queen when she awarded him an OBE in 1972 and as a KnightBachelor in 1990. I'm sure it was all just one big misunderstanding. Savile'sfuneral was held on 9th November (or 9/11,) but I'm sure that's just acoincidence.Savile is said to have been obsessed with Satanic practices, and someresearchers have suggested he was a black magician, and hailed from along-running bloodline of occultists. He referred to his late mother as 'TheDuchess', and it has been suggested that this was far more than a randomnickname, hinting at the relevance of the bloodline from which he descended.Savile was a friend of the Yorkshire Ripper, Peter Sutcliffe. The body of one ofSutcliffe's victims, Irene Richardson, was discovered close to Savile's home inRoundhay Park, Leeds.In the BBC2 documentary with Louis Theroux, 'When Louis Met Jimmy,' screened inApril 2000, Savile shows the audience what he claims to be the wardrobe of hislate mother in Scarborough, claiming to have kept many of her garments assouvenirs of her memory. Irish researcher and author Thomas Sheridan and othershave speculated that these may in fact be trinkets of some of his victims, andthat his crimes may go beyond child abuse to include murder.Elsewhere in the documentary, Theroux is seen questioning Savile about theongoing allegations of paedophilia that had plagued him for years. The dialogueruns as follows:\"Louis: So, why do you say in interviews that you hate children when I've seenyou with kids and you clearly enjoy their company and you have a good rapportwith them?Jimmy: Right, obviously I don't hate 'em. That's number one.Louis: Yeah. So why would you say that then?Jimmy: Because we live in a very funny world. And it's easier for me, as asingle man, to say 'I don't like children' because that puts a lot of salacioustabloid people off the hunt.Louis: Are you basically saying that so tabloids don't, you know, pursue thiswhole 'is he/ isn't he a paedophile?' line, basically?Jimmy: Yes, yes, yes. Oh, aye. How do they know whether I am or not? How doesanybody know whether I am? Nobody knows whether I am or not.\"The 'When Louis Met Jimmy' documentary, which used to be viewable in itsentirety on Youtube, now appears to have been removed. It has also disappearedfrom Vimeo, a message in its place reading: \"Vimeo has removed or disabledaccess to the following material as a result of a third-party notification byBBC Worldwide claiming that this material is infringing.\"Among the glut of 'celebs' who were hung out to dry by Operation Yewtree amidstaccusations of sexual impropriety were BBC 'It's A Knockout' presenter StuartHall, comedians Freddie Starr and Jim Davidson, former BBC producer WilfredDe'ath, publicist Max Clifford, Ted Beston, known in BBC circles as 'Uncle' Tedand a one-time radio producer for Jimmy Savile and Tony Blackburn, BBC DJ PaulGambaccini, (later vindicated,) and the former BBC2 announcer and Radio 1 DJChris Denning.Many people who were abused as children turn out to exhibit the same behaviouralpatterns as adults. Denning has said that he was a rent boy for the rich andfamous from the age of 13 to 18. His first conviction was for gross indecencyand indecent assault as long ago as 1974. Prior to this, Denning had beenworking with Jonathan King on his UK Records label. The pair were laterimplicated in the Walton Hop paedophile breeding ground, along with Tam Paton,manager of the Bay City Rollers. Denning went on to do jail time for variouschild sex offences. In November 2014 he admitted to a total of 41 sex offencecharges against young boys involving 26 victims between the years 1967 and 1987.A further veteran Radio 1 DJ whose name has cropped up in many related instancesis Alan 'Fluff' Freeman, long-time host of the BBC's 'Pick Of The Pops.' InSeptember 2013, seven years after Freeman's death, UK newspapers ran a story ofa man who claimed Freeman and Savile had raped him at a party in a London flat,(in the same block in which Freeman himself lived,) when he was a schoolboy. TheDaily Mirror's version of events stated:\"Speaking out for the first time since being interviewed by detectives, heclaimed Freeman and Savile 'showed me no pity and arrogantly thought they couldget away with anything.'\"'Fluff” Freeman – famous in the 1960s for his catchphrases 'Greetings, poppickers' and 'not ’arf' – is the latest on a growing list of stars named in themassive sex crimes investigation.\"It raises further concerns about a paedophile network that flourished at theheart of the BBC.\"The victim, happily married for 20 years, claims his horrific ordeal came in1964 – the year Savile and Freeman were founder presenters of 'Top Of ThePops'.\"Former Radio 1 DJ Dave Lee Travis, (real name David Griffin), was convicted oftwo sexual offences in 2014, but unusually, these concerned the groping of adultwomen's breasts, rather than involving young boys. Although morally wrong, thiswas hardly in the same league as the other grotesque offences Yewtree wassupposed to be investigating, and Travis seems to have been used as a convenientscapegoat to satisfy the public appetite for 'something to be done,' deflectingscrutiny from the real key players involved.DOWN WITH THE KINGRadio 1 and BBC presenter, (is it me, or is there a pattern emerging here?)Jonathan King was exposed as a serial paedophile with a preference for youngboys long before the Savile scandal, getting convicted and sentenced to sevenyears in jail in 2001. Wikipedia reports that:\"The investigation led to King's prosecution, which, for 'case management'purposes, was split between three trials at the Old Bailey. King denied thecharges but, in September 2001, he was found guilty, in the first of the trials,of four offences of indecent assault, one of buggery and one of attemptedbuggery against five boys aged 14 and 15 during the 1980s. Two months later, hewas sentenced to 7 years' imprisonment for those offences.\"In sentencing him, Judge David Paget, QC, said 'You used your fame and successto attract adolescent and impressionable boys. You then abused the trust theyand their parents placed in you.' Shortly before he was sentenced, King wasacquitted in the second trial. The prosecution had offered no further evidenceafter the alleged victim admitted during the trial that he was 'probably 16' atthe time of the alleged offences; the prosecution had been unable to prove thatthe sex was non-consensual. The prosecution then dropped the charges in thethird trial.\"According to a July 2014 article on The Coleman Experience website:\"Documents presented in Operation Arundel’s court case against DJ Jonathan King,were that he invited back boys from the Walton Hop club, and would also driveround in his Rolls Royce outside schools enticing boys into the car to help himwith a pop quiz. He had a secret ‘fantasy room’, a large rectangular suite inhis Bayswater mansion bedecked in lush black leather sofas, large swastika flagshung ceremoniously from ceiling to floor.\"Although Jewish, he had commissioned elaborate faked photo blow-ups of himselfin SS uniform, shaking hands with Hitler. He also screened 16mm projections ofNazi films which seemed to excite him.\"Boys were told if they mentioned to anyone what had happened, the police wouldbe told they had taken drugs and they would be in serious trouble. So the boysin the main kept quiet. One report shown to me said these DJs were regularvisitors to the twelve London care homes, and boys taken out were known as 'thesweety boys' as they always came back with sweets.\"Margaret Hodge (Oppenheimer) was the children’s minister who was accused ofhiding up the child abuse scandal. She was alleged to be close friends with TonyBlair, Peter Mandelson and Jonathan King.”King has consistently behaved as if he feels he has done nothing wrong. He hasrefused to apologise to his victims and their families, instead stating in 2012:\"The only apology I have is to say that I was good at seduction. I was good atmaking myself seem attractive when I wasn’t very attractive at all.\"Interestingly, record industry svengali and TV mogul (and freemason) SimonCowell put up £50,000 of King's £150,000 bail money when he was first jailed.The Mail Online reported in 2004 that Cowell's publicist Max Clifford wasangered at Cowell's actions, saying he subsequently 'set him straight about whatkind of man King is' . . . before Clifford himself was sentenced to eight yearsimprisonment in 2014 after being found guilty of eight charges of indecentassault against girls and young women.The BBC hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons again in 2014, meanwhile,when the publicly disgraced Jonathan King was wheeled out to give comments to aBBC2 documentary about the rock group Genesis. King is credited with'discovering' the band while they were still pupils at Charterhouse publicschool in Surrey, which he himself attended. Apparently no-one else would do andthe BBC considered King's inclusion more important than the insult that would becaused by giving airtime to a child-rapist in a programme funded by publiclicence payers, despite having already been embroiled in paedophile scandal fortwo years following the Savile revelations. A cynic could be forgiven forconcluding that they were smugly and knowingly taking the piss. And King was inthe headlines yet again in September 2015 when he was arrested on suspicion ofyet more historical sex offences linked to the Walton Hop.PEEL AWAY THE LAYERSIt seems even the hero of the alternative scene, John Peel, (real name JohnRavenscroft), whose anti-establishment image flew in the face of theconventional side of 'Auntie' Beeb, was not immune to the odd temptation in thespirit of the times, or the sickness that seems to have afflicted theCorporation. Maybe Peel was more of a BBC man than his carefully crafted rebelimage led us to believe. He did, after all, come from a public schoolbackground, the de facto Establishment breeding ground, and joined the VIP clubby getting awarded an OBE in 1998.Before joining the original line-up of Radio 1, and going on to enjoy a long BBCcareer which lasted all the way up his death in 2004, Peel worked at a Texasradio station in the early 60s. In later interviews, he recalled some of theperks of that particular period as involving many girls, some as young as 13,queuing up outside his studio to offer him sexual favours.\"Well, of course, I didn’t ask for ID,’ Peel has said in interview. \"All theywanted me to do was to abuse them sexually, which of course I was only too happyto do.\"It was the glamour of the job . . . but frustratingly, American girls of thatperiod – as they do now, actually – had this strange notion of virginity as atangible thing which you surrendered to your husband on your wedding night. Sothey would do anything but shag you. They’d give you a blowjob before they’dshag you.\"One of the girls who queued up outside his studio was Shirley Anne Milburn. Peelwent on to marry her in 1965 when he was 26 and she was 15. They moved toLondon, but divorced in 1973. Shortly afterwards Shirley returned to the USwhere she committed suicide.Peel wrote a column for the music magazine 'Sounds' through the 1970s, in whichhe often joked of how he preferred fans when they were dressed in schoolgirloutfits. For one series of pictures illustrating the column, Peel posed dressedas a St. Trinians-style schoolgirl himself, complete with stockings andsuspenders.Peel also ran a 'Schoolgirl Of The Year' competition on Radio 1.Meanwhile, a glance at the Wikipedia biography of Ed 'Stewpot' Stewart, famousfor his stints on Radio 1, Radio 2 and hosting 'Crackerjack' on BBC1, revealsthat: \"Stewart met his wife when she was 13 and he was 34. They married fouryears later.\"'THE SPIRIT OF THE TIMES'Some may look at these 'crimes' and consider them mild when compared with someof the other horrors now being uncovered, such as Satanic ritual abuse againstchildren. Such encounters are often written off as merely in keeping with 'thespirit of the times,' when 'everyone was at it,' and attempts are made tojustify the situation by pointing out that the girls were willing participantsand were 'throwing themselves' at the celebs concerned. What's a red-bloodedmale to do?But whichever way you cut it, sex with underage girls is still paedophilia,(with Dave Lee Travis getting jail-time for the lesser crime of adult fondlingto keep things in perspective,) and it would be a difficult task to find toomany fathers of teenage girls who are absolutely fine with the idea of theirdaughter being lured to bed by a grown man as a perk of his 'celebrity' status.Viewing things from this perspective, I find, always acts as a good moralcompass for judging a situation.In 2012, The UK Daily Mail carried the story of a 15-year-old schoolgirl, ClaireMcAlpine, who had been a dancer on BBC1's 'Top Of The Pops' show. She had beendiscovered dead by her mother in 1971, apparently the result of a suicidaloverdose. Claire had left behind a diary for her parents, in which she hadwritten accounts of how she had been sexually abused by a string of BBCpresenters and celebrities. The celebrities in question were never publiclyidentified, though it has emerged that Jimmy Savile, (surprise, surprise, asCilla Black would have said,) was quizzed by detectives over whether he knewher, which naturally, he denied. One of Claire's friends, Jenni Bale, laterstated that Savile was one of the DJs who had abused Claire, but that he had'bluffed his way out of it,' Claire was written off as a troubled fantasist,with the coroner ruling that she had taken her own life in anticipation of notbeing able to fulfil her dreams to become a pop star.As The Mail reported in its 2012 article:\"The allegations made – and casually dismissed both within and outside the BBC –by Claire McAlpine all those years ago can point only to one dreadfulconclusion: that far from being alone, the predatory behaviour displayed byJimmy Savile, national icon and charity fundraiser, was common among many bigshowbusiness names of the time.\"Indeed, all this week accusations have been appearing in national newspapersabout various well-known DJs. How many famous men are sitting at home nowterrified that the truth is about to come out?\"They may not have been paedophiles, (although we know of at least two, namelyJonathan King and former Radio 1 DJ Chris Denning, who were,) but they were partof the same culture of permissiveness that allowed the moral boundarysurrounding under-age sex to become blurred.\"Might this be the real reason for the code of omerta that seems to haveprevented many of those who must have known about Jimmy Savile’s predilectionfor young girls from speaking out?\"Stories such as these are the true, bitter legacy of celebrities takingadvantage of their status to get their sexual kicks. The fact that 'everyone wasdoing it' only makes it worse. There were no lack of visual clues as to thezeitgeist of that era either, it seems. Original copies of Alice Cooper’s 1972album 'School’s Out' were sold with a pair of panties wrapped around the sleeve,(and available in four different colours to increase collectability.) The debutalbum from Blind Faith, meanwhile, appeared around the same time with a topless,adolescent girl on the cover.SHARKS IN DOLPHIN SQUAREThe Mail article went on to give accounts of another former victim of childrape, who named a former celebrity DJ as having abused her, along with a formerassociate of another DJ who made similar claims. The article did not revealtheir identities, though it was hinted that one of them worked for London'sCapital Radio. What it did say was that one of the DJs in question allegedlytried to rape a girl at a party in Dolphin Square, in Pimlico, London, in the1980s. Dolphin Square has been hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasonsin recent months. Flats and apartments there are owned or rented by prominentMPs, and many have been implicated in accusations of child rape on-site.Scotland Yard confirmed in 2014 that they had launched a murder investigationconnected to allegations of child sex abuse dating back to the 1970s and 1980s,involving three paedophile MPs and centred around flats in Dolphin Square.One former Capital Radio DJ who was publicly named and arrested for historic sexoffences was Neil Fox, who had also been a judge on 'Pop Idol' alongside SimonCowell. Fox was charged in 2015 with nine sex offences against six people, ofwhom three were said to be under the age of 16. (Purely as a matter ofcuriosity, 'Fox' translates into '666' using Pythagorean numerology, and this isnot the last time we'll be encountering that particular number!)TWO LITTLE BOYS (AND THE REST)Rolf Harris' conviction as a child-rapist was wholly shocking for many, givenhis kindly public persona. New relevance was placed on a sketch filmed for the1980s BBC2 comedy 'Not The Nine O Clock News' but never broadcast, when itrecently emerged on Youtube. It shows several children being abducted from atown centre and herded into a BBC lorry. As the lorry drives off, the words'Rolf's On Saturday OK' can be seen on the side.You can watch the video here: * http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Rolf-Harris-1980-s-comedy-sketch-showing-children/story-21343123-detail/story.html [http://www.westerndailypress.co.uk/Rolf-Harris-1980-s-comedy-sketch-showing-children/story-21343123-detail/story.html]A similar story surfaced in the wake of Cilla Black's death in August 2015, whenThe Sun 'newspaper' revealed that a sketch from comedienne Tracey Ullman'supcoming BBC comedy show had been 'put aside.' It was said to feature Ullmanportraying Black visiting a number of showbiz homes . . . only to realise thatthey'd all been, as The Sun puts it, \"done for Jimmy Savile-type offences.\"Hiding the truth in plain sight once again.JILL DANDO AND THE ESTABLISHMENT RINGThere is strong evidence to suggest that BBC journalist Jill Dando was in theprocess of investigating institutionalised paedophile rings within the BritishEstablishment when she was shot in the head at point blank range on her Londondoorstep in 1999.These revelations became so widespread within the alternative media that evencorporate mainstream newspapers were forced to report on the story in July 2014to avoid being seen to be out of touch or deliberately avoiding the issue. Afriend and retired co-worker of Dando's stated:“I don’t recall the names of all the stars now and don’t want to implicateanyone, but Jill said they were surprisingly big names. I think she was quiteshocked when told about images of children and that information on how to jointhis horrible paedophile ring was freely available.“Jill said others had complained to her about sexual matters and that somefemale workmates also claimed they had been groped or assaulted. Nothing hadbeen done and there seemed to be a policy of turning a blind eye.”Barry George, the man originally charged with the Dando murder in a usefuldiversion to satisfy the general public that 'something was being done,' waslater revealed to have been framed when he was acquitted in 2008 after servingseven years in jail. His claims for wrongful imprisonment were rejected.The plot goes further yet, in another interconnected labyrinth involving, amongothers, the BBC's Nick Ross, Esther Rantzen, Royal gynaecologist (and formerfiancé of Jill Dando) Alan Farthing, Childline founder Sarah Caplin, and manyothers, as detailed in the following two 2013 articles from the UK ColemanExperience and Aangirfan blog sites: * http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/the-curious-case-of-nick-ross-vip-child-abuse-filthy-comments-operation-yewtree-crimestoppers-and-the-death-of-jill-dando/ [http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2013/06/03/the-curious-case-of-nick-ross-vip-child-abuse-filthy-comments-operation-yewtree-crimestoppers-and-the-death-of-jill-dando/] * http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2013/07/il-principe.html [http://aangirfan.blogspot.com/2013/07/il-principe.html]And in this Coleman Experience piece, which speculates on whether the deaths ofthe former BBC celebrities Kristian Digby, Natasha Collins, Mark Speight, KevinGreening, Rik Mayall and Mike Smith could have been connected to knowledge of ahigh-ranking paedophile network: * http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/mysterious-deaths-at-the-bbc/ [http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/mysterious-deaths-at-the-bbc/]Natasha Collins, the girlfriend of BBC children's entertainer Mark Speight, wasfound dead in a bathtub in 2008. Death by Bathtub seems to be a common theme inthe passing away of celebrities, and this is not the last time we will encounterit in this book. Speight is reported to have sunk into a deep depression afterbeing arrested on suspicion of murder and of supplying her with Class A drugs,though he was not charged. Speight's body was discovered hanging from a disusedpart of Paddington train station in London three months later.Greening is said to have died of a heart attack a day before his 45th birthdayafter taking large quantities of cocaine, ecstasy and GHB. His boyfriend, SeanGriffin, was arrested in connection with his death, but charges were notsubsequently pursued by the police. Given the large number of unpleasant deathsof so many of its employees, the BBC sure could be said to be one 'unlucky'organisation.And just to keep it all in perspective, not forgetting this blog article whichlists many of the current and former BBC employees, (but by no means all ofthem,) who have been convicted and charged with various crimes, (and whosesalaries are paid for by public money extorted with threats of violence via theBBC TV licence scheme, lest we forget.) * http://scrapthelicence.weebly.com/bbc-criminals.html [http://scrapthelicence.weebly.com/bbc-criminals.html]CHEGGERS DROPS A BOMBThe comments about the BBC being under Jewish control brought to mind theremarkable cameo of a bloated, latter-day Keith Chegwin on Ricky Gervais''Extras' comedy, screened on BBC2 in 2006. Chegwin is seen back in a BBC studio,the joke being that he's long past his glory years of presenting 'Swap Shop' and'Cheggers Plays Pop' and is now all washed up. Getting nostalgic he says: \"14years at the BBC . . . still run by Jews and queers, is it?\" It seems all themore incredible with every passing year that Gervais got the green light toinclude this line in his show. Particularly as Chegwin follows it up with:\"Gay!' I forgot! Not allowed to say 'queer' nowadays, are you? Suggestssomething 'abnormal'. What could be more 'normal' than shoving your cock up abloke's arse?\" This particular clip of Extras is another item which used to beavailable on Youtube but now seems to have 'disappeared.'AS BLATANT AS IT GETSThe more you delve into the truth behind the sick, diseased nature of theBritish Establishment, the more you come to realise that they love placing cluesto their activities in plain sight, knowing that they will go right over theheads of all but those open-minded and vigilant enough to go where the truthleads them. Perhaps none of us should have been too surprised at the sickeningchild sex abuse now known to have taken place within the British BroadcastingCorporation, given the statue that stands outside its iconic Broadcasting Housebuilding in London. Named 'Ariel and Prospero' after Shakespeare's 'TheTempest,' it depicts an adult male in ecstasy as a naked male child writhesagainst his crotch. The 'work' was sculpted by Eric Gill, a known paedophilewhose activities have been reported by the BBC itself. Despite the revelations,and the ongoing Savile scandal, the statue remains in place.Which all goes to make a sick joke of the BBC's 'Children In Need' appeal. Thisannual money grab seems like a dark mocking of the nation's gullibility. Here isan organisation which covered up paedophilia on a monumental scale, which thenhas the nerve to tug at the heartstrings of the public and claim to care aboutthe plight of children, with Sir (what else?) Terry Wogan wheeled out as thecuddly, friendly face of 'Auntie' Beeb. Just how much of the millions raisedgoes to any constructive, practical use in alleviating child suffering isanybody's guess, since recent enquiries into many leading charities haverevealed that the bulk of money raised goes towards paying executive salariesand on 'admin' costs. The BBC-supported 'Comic Relief' found scandal when it wasrevealed in 2013 that some of the money raised, far from going to help people inneed in Africa, had been invested in tobacco and arms companies. The findingswere even reported on an episode of 'Panorama' broadcast by BBC1 itself. LennyHenry, the friendly face of 'Comic Relief' for many years, was made a KnightBachelor in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 2015.In light of this book's imminent chapter on the one-eyed symbolism peddled byA-list celebrities, isn't it interesting that the mascot for the BBC's 'ChildrenIn Need', Pudsey Bear, just happens to have one of his eyes covered up by abandage, and in earlier years, appeared inside a pyramid? The official mascotsfor the 2012 London Olympics, Wenlock and Mandeville (man-devil?), were twoentities who just happened to have one eye. But I'm sure it's all justcoincidence.BLACK IS WHITE, WHITE IS BLACKIt seems grotesque in retrospect that convicted paedophiles Jimmy Savile, GaryGlitter and Rolf Harris all appeared on 'Children In Need' appeals clutchingPudsey Bear and imploring the public to part with their cash. History has shownthat many of the real 'children in need' ended up in that status because of thesexual deviants the BBC has employed. The nerve of such an organisation inmoralising to the public and manipulating a guilty response is deplorable. Butit becomes clear that this is how the various expressions of the Establishmentoperate. In Satanic ideology, meanings are back-to-front, which is whyupside-down crosses and inverted pentagrams are among their favoured symbols.It's reflected in speech, too. When a politician tells the public he won't underany circumstances be raising taxes or sending the country to war, you can takeit that the opposite is what is really meant. (There's also a playout of thisideology in the phenomenon of backwards speech recordings, as we'll discover ina later chapter.) So 'Children In Need', as some have suggested, could be takenas covertly meaning 'in need of children.'The control system also likes to mock us by revealing their true motives rightthere in plain sight, arrogantly secure in the knowledge that the vast majoritywill have no idea what's really going on, and will blindly go along with thesurface narrative they're given. Most people, with a warm, feel-good image ofdear old Terry Wogan on screen with a cute bear with a bandaged eye, evoking anemotional response and piquing at their guilt, will go right along with thecoercion to give whatever they can, without thinking to question where the moneywill end up. Few would believe that such cynical duplicity is possible, which iswhy so many had great trouble believing the revelations about Rolf Harris' childabuse given his amiable public image. Even Jimmy Savile hid behind his coverstory of 'doing a lot of good work for charity,' much of it ensuring he got tohang around large numbers of kids. This is a standard trick used by the controlsystem to disarm the general public, by instilling a glossy veneer so reassuringthat it breeds an absolute disbelief that any wrongdoing could be taking place.Of course, we could never do anything so outrageously deceptive. But they playby different rules of morality and do it all the time. Things have beenoperating this way, on so many levels, for a very long time. Have we had enoughyet?The Savile scandal should have spelled the end of the BBC, or at the very least,led to a nation so collectively outraged by what had been going on right undertheir noses, that they refused, en masse, to continue paying the licence feethat funds the BBC's activities. Somewhere in a parallel universe stands acountry of aware, morally motivated people where exactly that has happened. Butnot, sadly, in this one.Either way, Rolf Harris' 'Two Little Boys,' Gary Glitter's 'I'm The Leader OfThe Gang (I Am),' Cliff Richard's 'The Young Ones' and Jonathan King's 'Let ItAll Hang Out,' are four songs you needn't expect to hear again on the radio anytime soon.PLEASE, SIRThere's no doubt that this section only scratches the surface of the sick,filthy, sordid nature of what really goes on beneath the surface glitz of theentertainment industry, and that alternative stories will be legion. Peopleoften express bewilderment at how one industry can spawn such depravedbehaviour, immoral lifestyles and negative outcomes. In fact, it's not muchdifferent from another level of The Establishment – that of politics. This is anarea infested with the same type of activity when you really get down to it –much as the mainstream media may try to downplay it – and politicians areselected for prominent positions in much the same way that Hollywood actors, TVpersonalities and music artists are.In the wake of the Savile scandal, media attention – both alternative andmainstream – turned towards the notorious Elm Guest House in South West London.It was kept by Mary Moss, herself a child abuse victim, and formerly with theNational Association Of Young People In Care. Elm Guest House was revealed tohave been the setting for an ongoing series of depraved orgies through thedecades, where famous politicians, business chiefs and well-known entertainerswould engage in sex with children that had been procured from various 'care'homes and plied with drugs and alcohol. The guest list that Mary Moss kept makesfor very interesting reading.The fact that the British government has been populated by such a high number ofchild-rapists, sexual deviants, perverts and Satanists through the decades,defies the laws of probability. The Savile scandal, which would never have beenpublic knowledge had the 'elites' had their way, lifted the lid on a huge swatheof parliamentary paedos that have been protected from public scrutiny fordecades. In most cases, they've not only been given important positions, butthey've been knighted in the process. By 2015, even the mainstream press wasreporting on the fact that former British Prime Minister Sir (anyone surprised?)Edward Heath had been a child-rapist and part of a parliamentary paedophilering, and had taken young boys from 'care' homes out on the yacht he used tosail to Jersey. They were never seen again. Heath reportedly worked in leaguewith Savile, who was a 'friend.' These revelations should have filled thegeneral British public with absolute outrage and led to demands for questions tobe answered. Like everything else, predictably, the story faded from theheadlines after a couple of days and the nation carried on going about itsbusiness. Wherever the moral line in the sand is in this nation, clearly it's along way from being reached yet.It has to be acknowledged that the amount of public figures exposed aspaedophiles who just happen to be 'Sirs' is staggering, and it defies allpossibility that the Queen could not have known about their activities,particularly as the M15 security services are supposed to thoroughly vet thebackgrounds of anyone that the royal family comes into close contact with. Thefact that Jimmy Savile, a serial child-rapist, necrophiliac and Satanist,remained a close personal friend of the royals for decades, speaks volumes abouthow effective and relevant this supposed method of vetting really is, not tomention the type of company that the 'Windsors' (Saxe-Coburg-Gothas) choose tokeep.Conversely, an observer could be justified in theorising that the bestowing of aknighthood is in fact a reward for services rendered. Either way, given theviolent and bloody history of the British Empire, and what it has stood forthrough the centuries – invading foreign lands, slaughtering the indigenouspopulations, (more often than not people with black and brown skin,) andplundering their natural resources – I find it hard to understand why anyonewould want to be associated with it by way of letters after their name. Itsuggests pride at the Empire's murderous activities, which seems a very strangething for any morally decent person to want, no matter how much a knighthoodmight stoke the ego. Recently, DJs have started getting them, too. Reggaesupremo David Rodigan and soulful veteran Norman Jay are now 'Sirs', while SoulII Soul's Jazzie B is an OBE, and BBC Radio 1 veterans Pete Tong and AnnieNightingale are now MBEs. Pete might want to think about re-wording the text atthe top of his Twitter page, by the way, where he refers to himself as 'the piedpiper of dance,' given that The Pied Piper, who in the story kidnapped all of atown's children, has also been a nickname for R Kelly, Russell Brand and JimmySavile!My respect goes out to those conscientious individuals who have declinedknighthoods. Among them are poet Benjamin Zephaniah who stated in 2010: \"I getangry when I hear the word 'empire'; it reminds me of slavery, it reminds me ofthousands of years of brutality, it reminds me of how my foremothers were rapedand my forefathers brutalised.\" Another knighthood decliner is British hip-hopdance supremo Jonzi D, who remarked: \"I am diametrically opposed to the idea ofempire. Man, I'm a 'Star Wars' fan – empire is bad.\" I recorded an interviewwith Jonzi in which he went further into his reasoning, which can be listened tohere: * https://soundcloud.com/mark-devlin/mbes-to-b-boys-mark-devlin [https://soundcloud.com/mark-devlin/mbes-to-b-boys-mark-devlin]"},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Sir Cliff Richard 2014 arrest: * http://www.itv.com/news/story/2014-08-23/cliff-richard-not-charged-or-arrested-after-police-interview/ [http://www.itv.com/news/story/2014-08-23/cliff-richard-not-charged-or-arrested-after-police-interview/] * http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/cliff-richard-planning-new-life-4296739 [http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/cliff-richard-planning-new-life-4296739]Sir Cliff Richard plans to sue the BBC: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2845650/Sir-Cliff-Richard-vows-sue-BBC-demands-damages-TV-news-crew-filmed-abuse-inquiry-police-raiding-home.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2845650/Sir-Cliff-Richard-vows-sue-BBC-demands-damages-TV-news-crew-filmed-abuse-inquiry-police-raiding-home.html]Led Zeppelin's underage groupies: * http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/led-zeppelin-there-was-a-whole-lotta-love-on-tour-763446.html [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/led-zeppelin-there-was-a-whole-lotta-love-on-tour-763446.html]Lori Maddox's affair with Jimmy Page: * http://www.stryder.de/rest/Groupie_Central_Lori_%20Maddox.html [http://www.stryder.de/rest/Groupie_Central_Lori_%20Maddox.html]VH1 documentary 'Let's Spend The Night Together': * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnViqstGsYs [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnViqstGsYs]VH1 documentary on groupies, including interview with Lori Maddox re Jimmy Pageand David Bowie: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnViqstGsYs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnViqstGsYs]Was Elvis Presley a paedophile?: * http://www.nkornitankwa.com/were-these-6-incredibly-talented-men-pedophiles/ [http://www.nkornitankwa.com/were-these-6-incredibly-talented-men-pedophiles/]Jill Dando investigating alleged paedophile ring at the BBC: * http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/490169/Dando-alarm-paedophile-ring-BBC [http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/490169/Dando-alarm-paedophile-ring-BBC]The BBC paedophile ring: * http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/the-bbc-and-the-paedophile-ring/ [http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/04/03/the-bbc-and-the-paedophile-ring/]Jonathan King and the Walton Hop paedophile ring: * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGAUWw6s6r4 [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGAUWw6s6r4]Tony Blair, BBC, Britain’s missing children and the VIP paedophile connection: * http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/tony-blair-britains-missing-children-and-the-vip-paedophile-connection/ [http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/07/19/tony-blair-britains-missing-children-and-the-vip-paedophile-connection/]The Who's Who of Satanic Child Abuse, by Chris Spivey: * http://chrisspivey.org/the-whos-who-of-Satanic-child-abuse/ [http://chrisspivey.org/the-whos-who-of-Satanic-child-abuse/]Elton John's mysterious meltdown, by The Coleman Experience: * http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/elton-johns-mysterious-meltdown/ [http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/08/02/elton-johns-mysterious-meltdown/]Pete Townshend interview with The Times: * http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9572773/Pete-Townshend-I-paid-for-child-porn-to-prove-British-banks-were-channelling-sex-ring-cash.html [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/9572773/Pete-Townshend-I-paid-for-child-porn-to-prove-British-banks-were-channelling-sex-ring-cash.html]Wikipedia: Jimmy Savile: After His Death: * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile#After_his_death [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Savile#After_his_death]Jimmy Savile, The Kray Twins, Cliff Richard, by Aangirfan: * http://aangirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/jimmy-savile-kray-twins-cliff-richards.html [http://aangirfan.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/jimmy-savile-kray-twins-cliff-richards.html]Gary Glitter on 'This Is Your Life': * http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OZTB03azM [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OZTB03azM]Jimmy Savile and Gary Glitter in their element: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Hx7Q2oC5U [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Hx7Q2oC5U]Mysterious deaths at the BBC: * http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/mysterious-deaths-at-the-bbc/ [http://thecolemanexperience.wordpress.com/2014/10/25/mysterious-deaths-at-the-bbc/]Man tells of agony at the hands of BBC paedo ring involving DJ Alan Freeman andevil pal Jimmy Savile: * http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-tells-agony-hands-bbc-2292125 [http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/man-tells-agony-hands-bbc-2292125]Daily Mail: Special report: A 15-year-old who killed herself after leaving adiary naming DJs as abusers.

Sure enough,a thorough delving into the story of The Beatles does not disappoint – even ifsome sober discernment is needed to identify likely truths from the ever-presentglut of misinformation in circulation, whether by deliberate diversion, orwell-meaning mistake.It's been widely claimed that The Beatles were the creation of The TavistockInstitute of Human Relations, the British organisation concerned with mass mindcontrol and social engineering techniques. Its headquarters in London'sTavistock Square was the site of the fourth bomb that went off during 7/7 in2005. A slogan for a film ad on the side of the wrecked bus just happened toread: \"Outright terror . . . bold and brilliant.\" Tavistock's public cover storyis that it's a 'British charity concerned with group behaviour andorganisational behaviour,' but the truth about its activities and influence islikely to be rather different. Baron Jacob Rothschild is described officially asa 'philanthropist,' after all, as is David Rockefeller, showing thatpublicly-acceptable cover stories are a wonderful thing.The Beatles/ Tavistock theory seems to have become viral after originating fromDr. John Coleman, who, like T. Stokes, was a former British intelligence officerturned whistle-blower. The account appeared in his book 'The Conspirators'Hierarchy: The Committee Of 300,' and is linked to the allegation that themajority of The Beatles' lyrics were actually written by Theodor W. Adorno, arepresentative of The Frankfurt School, a German organisation similar in natureto the Tavistock Institute. Adorno appears to have been a professor ofphilosophy who wrote music, but the claim of his involvement with The Beatlescame originally from Coleman. He stated in an interview:\"Theodor W. Adorno was well-known to Tavistock. He was known as 'the Karl Marxof music.' Adorno called his sound 'corrosive' and 'unacceptable,' and it wasbased on a 12-atonal system, consisting of heavy, repetitive sounds. He startedwriting all his songs using this system. Adorno believed the bourgeoisie wantedmusic that didn't bother them or make them think. Tavistock wanted to pass onthese new musical experiences to new audiences, affecting the masses. So'uncomfortable' music was born.\"Coleman also claimed that The Beatles' music was later used to normaliserecreational drug usage among young people, creating an entirely new andirreversible social dynamic within the course of a few years.Many have viewed The Beatles' music, image and cultural legacy in new light inthe spirit of these times. The suggestion that they were a project of unseenforces, rather than four working class lads from Liverpool who just happen tohave found success through hard work and some catchy songs, seems distinctlyprobable. It's also been pointed out that The Beatles' monumental success inAmerica, off the back of their fabled February 1964 appearance on 'The EdSullivan Show,' occurred only weeks after the assassination of President Kennedywhich had so traumatised that nation. The Beatles served as a hip and upliftingdistraction to the sinister aftermath of that event.Despite this, however, substantiating Coleman's claim is difficult. Many fanshave pointed out that the notion of a dusty old professor writing lyrics as hipand poignant as those of The Beatles is absurd – particularly ones such as'Penny Lane' and 'Strawberry Fields' which supposedly drew on John Lennon'spersonal childhood memories.Although Coleman is often apparently 'debunked,' a wide variety of researchersand Beatles scholars tend to find the idea that the group were a Tavistockproject entirely plausible. And claims that The Beatles' against-all-oddssuccess story involves more than meets the eye, do not go away through simplydismissing Coleman's account.A DONE DEAL?In 2008, lifelong Beatles fan-turned-author Joseph Niezgoda released his book'The Lennon Prophecy: A New Examination Of The Death Clues Of The Beatles.' Likemany US authors, Niezgoda makes no secret of the fact that he is a Christianpatriot, and his religious views tend to colour his findings. He does make someintriguing contentions, however.The crux of Niezgoda's theory is that dark occult clues and symbols were placedthroughout The Beatles' material, but rather than hinting at the premature deathof Paul McCartney, (we'll get to that!), they all relate to a kind of demoniccurse that followed John Lennon. The reason for this, Niezgoda states, is thatLennon entered into a contract with 'The Devil' in the early days of the group,in which he was promised 20 years of fame and fortune on an unprecedented scale.Lennon's fee was a heavy one, involving him effectively giving over his soul,while 'The Devil's end of the deal speaks for itself.This deal was reportedly made in 1960, and there is a point in December of thatyear where the phenomenon of teenage fans screaming hysterically and trying tomob the stage can first be seen – an unseen spectacle in Britain up to thatpoint. This would seemingly have been sometime between 10th December, when TheBeatles returned uneventfully from a lacklustre stint performing in Germany, andthe 27th, the date of a far more successful turn at Liverpool's Litherland TownHall.Certainly, this article by Dave Persails detailing the early incarnations of thegroup, and the changes in name and personnel before their breakthrough, begs theintriguing question of just what it was that magically gelled to propel theBeatles to overnight success after years of struggling amateurism –http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/named.htm [http://abbeyrd.best.vwh.net/named.htm].Indeed, Robert Whitaker, the photographer behind the infamous 'butcher' cover ofthe 'Yesterday And Today' album, remarked: \"All over the world I'd watchedpeople worshipping like idols, like gods, four Beatles. To me they were juststock standard normal people. But this emotion that fans poured on them made mewonder where Christianity was heading.\"These last days of 1960, goes the story, were the starting point of the fame andfortune deal. Bearing in mind it was only to last for 20 years, however, itwould have expired in December 1980, the month when Lennon was murdered outsidethe Dakota building in Manhattan.According to an uncredited article on the blog site No-One Has To Die Tomorrow:\"The Beatles' ascension to the top rung of the Rock & Roll pantheon, displacingElvis Presley and American rock legends who had a lock on the reins of Rock &Roll, was rigged and engineered into place by the British Crown and BritishMilitary Intelligence.\"For instance, in August 1963, at their first major television appearance at theLondon Palladium, the newspaper reported that police had to hold back '1,000squealing teenagers,' but the story was fabricated. The newspaper photo actuallytightly cropped three screaming teenagers and claimed it was a thousand. Onereporter who was there later said there were less than eight girls present.There was no 'riot' by frenzied teenage girls.\"Similarly, 'Beatlemania' hysteria was manufactured at JFK Airport in Februaryof 1964 when the Beatles arrived in the USA to perform for 'The Ed SullivanShow.' Busloads of girls from a Bronx school were paid by Beatles promoters toscream hysterically when the Beatles got off the plane and went into theterminal.\"It was a manufactured publicity stunt, but it paid off in priming the pump forthe 'Ed Sullivan Show' appearances, which did create a frenzied attitude amongmany American teenagers, set the stage for a looser rein on moral boundaries,and opened the door for kids from 'decent,' middle-class families to start usingdrugs, which is precisely what British Intelligence, Tavistock, and the CIA hadin mind all along.\"Lennon's assassination appeared to have been foreshadowed by film footage shotin early December 1969, which later appeared in the BBC documentary 'JohnLennon: 24 Hours.' Lennon is with Yoko Ono, going through letters sent in byfans. He reads out one from someone saying they'd been using a Ouija board andreceived a message that someone will try to assassinate him, writing: 'Thespirit that gave me this information was Brian Epstein'.Almost exactly 11 years later the prophecy became true.WINGED BEATLESThe very naming of The Beatles is an aspect that has intrigued researchers intothe group's more occultic aspects. 'Beatles' is taken to be a simple pun, inreference to their status as a 'beat' group. In its earliest incarnation as alate 50s skiffle band, Lennon first called his ensemble The Black Jacks, beforeit morphed into The Quarry Men, then further monikers such as Johnny and theMoondogs, The Nerk Twins, (for just two days,) The Beatals, The Silver Beetles,The Silver Beats and The Silver Beatles, before eventually surviving as TheBeatles. Original member Stuart Sutcliffe is supposed to have come up with the'Beatles' idea as a play on Buddy Holly's Crickets. (Sutcliffe died of areported brain aneurysm in 1962 at the age of just 21. A common internet rumourrefers to Sutcliffe's sister Pauline claiming that John Lennon had a homosexualaffair with her brother, that he later beat him up out of confused guilt, andthat Lennon's blows to the head led to Sutcliffe's eventual fate. However,Pauline denied ever making these comments in 2003 as she unveiled a collectionof her brother's personal items to be sold at auction.)When writing an article for his friend Bill Harry's 'Mersey Beat' magazine in1961, in the days before The Beatles had found Ringo, Brian Epstein or GeorgeMartin, Lennon stated: 'Many people ask what are The Beatles? Why Beatles? Ugh,Beatles, how did the name arrive? So we will tell you. It came in a vision. Aman appeared on a flaming pie and said unto them: 'From this day on you areBeatles with an A'. 'Thank you, Mister Man,' they said, thanking him.' ('FlamingPie' cropped up as the title of Paul McCartney's tenth studio album decadeslater in 1997.)The alternative consensus, however, appears to be that the group's name isderived from the horned scarab beetle, a religious symbol of Ancient Egyptianculture. These insects were revered as symbols of regeneration and creation,conveying ideas of transformation, renewal, and resurrection. Furthermore, theirhabit of making balls of dung and rolling them, were considered a symbol of thesun god Ra rolling the sun across the sky every day. Synchronistically, theseparticular beetles have wings, with Paul McCartney choosing 'Wings' as the nameof his later group. Intriguingly, \"The Winged Beetle' was the title of acollection of poems by Aleister Crowley. Heard of him anywhere?HEARTS ON THEIR SLEEVESAny advanced study into the hidden nature of the corporate industry machinereveals a heavy reliance on symbolism, steeped in occult, esoteric and mysticalpractices, and designed to have an unknowing effect on the subconscious mind ofthe viewer. When it comes to The Beatles, students of this phenomenon have had afield day with the group's album covers, and it would take a very heavy dose ofworld-weary cynicism to deny that something – whatever the interpretation – isdesigned to be communicated by some of the key images.An early album sleeve, Parlophone's 'With The Beatles', has the four pictured inblack-and-white with one half of their faces shaded, the other illuminated,evoking the eye of Horus/ all-seeing eye/ illumination symbology we willencounter elsewhere. The 'Hard Day's Night' sleeve similarly features half ofThe Beatles' faces, this time cut off below the nose, with one eye slightlyshaded in each case. On a rare Dutch version of 'Help,' the band are paraded infront of a giant version of the Shell petroleum company logo. Except the Shelllogo has always been a cleverly-disguised representation of the rays of therising sun. Sun symbolism crops up throughout Beatles imagery and in the lyricsto a great many of their songs. The more common version of 'Help' has themembers striking 'grade sign' poses straight out of Crowley's AA occult secretsociety. Similarly, there are telling hand signs from Lennon and McCartney onthe sleeve to 'Yellow Submarine,' (a slang term for both a cannabis joint and amild pharmaceutical stimulant capsule.) The 'Beatles' '65' sleeve has the bandposing under umbrellas, which is interesting bearing in mind Lenon Honor'sinterpretation of Rihanna's 'Umbrella' song and video that appears in the laterchapter on video symbolism.The meanings hidden in the 'Sergeant Pepper' sleeve could cover an entire bookin themselves, and we'll get on to that one later, along with the similarlyambiguous and endlessly-analysed 'Abbey Road.' Only one other sleeve hasreceived anywhere near as much analysis and opining in recent years, and this isthe infamous 'butcher' cover for the June 1966, (6/66?) compilation release 'TheBeatles: Yesterday And Today.'The image, surely shocking by anyone's standards, has the four smiling Beatlesdressed in butchers' smocks, with raw meat draped all over them, along withnaked toy baby dolls. The dolls are mutilated, with heads and arms missing.Lennon is pointing downwards with one of his fingers. The image was one of nineknown to have been taken during a photographic session directed by theaforementioned Robert Whitaker. The unused images, all grisly, differ widelyfrom the one chosen. In one, Lennon alone smiles, covered in meat, displayingteeth and eyes on his hands. Another has McCartney alone, gazing upwards whileclutching mutilated dolls and meat, (an interesting stance for one of theworld's most famous vegetarians,) with what looks like an umbilical corddangling from his wrist. The four are seen smiling as Lennon puts a pair ofsunglasses on a doll's decapitated head. Two pictures similar to the finalchoice have the Beatles looking sullen and forlorn, rather than smiling. Inanother, all have their eyes closed, seeming to be asleep or in a trance.Decades later, the raw meat look would be resurrected by Lady Gaga and hernotorious 'meat dress,' which caused similar shock and controversy.THE MEANING OF THE MEATUnsurprisingly, there have been multiple interpretations of the sleeve. Amongthe most popular, (put forward by Joseph Niezgoda among many others,) is theunsettling suggestion that the group were subliminally communicating thepractice of infanticide, the ritual sacrifice of babies and young children bythe elite ruling class. Certainly, there has been endless evidence provided byresearchers and whistleblowers to show that this sick and horrific practice isone routinely employed by the dark occult priest class who ultimately controlhuman activity.The idea is that The Beatles, presumably at the behest of their controllers,were providing a representation of this, either as a well-meaning indicator ofwhat goes on, or as a way of mocking their fans, in the sure knowledge that allbut a handful would be completely ignorant of the true meaning. A glance at thefull photoshoot reveals four men who appear far from in confident control of thesituation they find themselves in, looking more like manipulated stoogesfollowing every stage of their instructions. In fact, the uniformity of theBeatles, with all four members looking, dressing, talking and acting in the sameway throughout their formative years, smacks of a quartet of puppeteered dupes,rather than four fiercely creative and self-driven individuals making statementsof their own independent choosing.There is another, far more innocent-sounding interpretation of the 'butcher'cover, however, which seems to have become equally prevalent. This version wasdescribed to me in an e-mail from Bruce Reid, a filmmaker currently involved ina project called 'The King And The Queen's Men,' examining the cultural impactof The Beatles and Elvis Presley:\"When The Beatles made their splash in the US, the record label, (Capitol,) thatdistributed their music came up with a brilliant idea. Capitol completelyaltered albums, or came up with completely different albums that never existedoutside the US and Canada. 'The Beatles' 2nd Album', 'Something New', 'Beatles'65', 'Beatles VI' and 'Yesterday And Today' are examples of these type ofalbums.\"Until the release of 'Sergeant Pepper' none of the British albums lined up withthe US versions. When 'Yesterday And Today' was released, it was two monthsbefore 'Revolver.' What they decided to do was remove three songs from theunreleased 'Revolver' and place them on 'Y&T.' The songs were 'And Your Bird CanSing.' 'I'm Only Sleeping,' and 'Dr. Robert.' The Beatles were tired of theirartistic works being butchered, which resulted in the picture being sent toCapitol as a message to quit butchering their albums in order to make a quickbuck. Somehow, it was determined by Capitol that this was supposed to be used asthe official cover. That was Capitol's mistake, not The Beatles'.\"This makes for an interesting case. But if this was indeed the motivation behindthe cover, it occurs to me that the statement could have been made with just thesmocks and the raw meat. Why the need for the mutilated babies too?However, Bruce Reid adds:\"I truly believe that someone in The Beatles' camp, (George Martin, BrianEpstein or Sir Lew Grade – probably Lew Grade,) was involved with The TavistockInstitute that, unbeknownst to the Beatles, were involved with theirtremendously quick rise to the top. I feel that when they discovered they weretoo far in to get out, they decided to let the fans know what was going on. I'veheard that one of the reasons John Lennon was assassinated, was that he wasgoing on a world tour in 1981 and that he was going to expose Tavistock for whatthey were.\"Both Robert Whitaker and Paul McCartney have claimed credit for the photoshootidea. Some fans have suggested that McCartney was the most conscientious of TheBeatles regarding what they came to realise they were a part of. According to a2002 interview in the music magazine 'Mojo,' former Capitol president Alan W.Livingston stated that it was McCartney who pushed strongly for the photo'sinclusion as some kind of comment on the Vietnam War, rather than a comment oninfanticide. Whitaker's apparent version is that he wanted to push the envelopeby creating something genuinely avant-garde, simply for its shock value. He issaid to have been trying to recreate the work of the German surrealist HansBellmer.A fascinating array of information on hidden aspects of The Beatles residingjust beneath the surface, (or sometimes, right upon it,) comes from thefollowing blog site, meanwhile. As ever, readers must decide for themselveswhether all the claims and contentions have merit. At the very least, itprovides for many hours of deep pondering and musing for those who like toembrace all the possibilities of a situation: * http://pinballking.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/whats-wrong-with-beatles-alot.html [http://pinballking.blogspot.co.uk/2010/07/whats-wrong-with-beatles-alot.html]It all serves to further muddy the waters when it comes to the truth behind TheBeatles. The only thing that remains undeniable, whatever the finer detail, isthat there was always far, far more to the group than the carefully cultivatedimage of four fun, wholesome lads that was presented to the general public.And that's before you even get into the whole area of 'PID.'

ISN’T HE?Did the real Paul McCartney die in 1966?“Sometimes people hold a core belief that is very strong. When they arepresented with evidence that works against that belief, the new evidence cannotbe accepted. It would create a feeling that is extremely uncomfortable called‘cognitive dissonance.’ And because it is so important to protect the corebelief, they will rationalize, ignore and even deny anything that doesn’t fit inwith that core belief.”Frantz Fanon, philosopher and writer (1925-1961)\"There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the otheris to refuse to believe what is true.\"Søren Kierkegaard (1813-1855)When it comes to 'conspiracy theories,' the music industry has its very ownfavourite to rival JFK, the Apollo moon landings or 9/11. Over the years theidea has come to be known as 'Paul Is Dead,' or 'PID,' and it refers to thesurprisingly widespread suggestion that the real James Paul McCartney diedsometime in 1966 and was replaced by an impostor who has been taking his placeever since.Anyone hearing this idea for the first time is likely to react the same way as Iinitially did; scoffing condemnation towards a patently ridiculous idea.As with almost every other subject, however, some delving beneath the 'official'version of events reveals some plausible alternatives that anyone with an openmind and a capacity for critical thought might like to spend a little timemulling over. And so it is with PID. Although sounding worthy of instantdismissal, some proper investigation at least takes it beyond the realms of theoutright impossible. You don't gain the right to dismiss a subject as'ridiculous' until you've at least looked at the evidence and given it a chance.And cynics are invited to debunk and explain a huge array of discrepanciesbefore retiring into smug certainty on this one, or to nominate any alternative'ridiculous' claim at random that involves so many potent synchronicities. Itsurprises me the amount of 'truth' and 'conspiracy' researchers who won't gonear the fine detail of this one purely because it doesn't 'sound right.'This chapter, therefore, is a thorough chronicle of the widespread claims of aMcCartney replacement. As with all things, readers must make up their own mindsbased on the information available.ACCIDENT? . . . There seem to be two widely circulated versions of the PID myth. In one,McCartney, 24 at the time, is said to have got into a heated argument with theother Beatles during a recording session, (at around 5am supposedly,) andstormed off in his convertible sports car. An Aston Martin, by all accounts. Heis then said to have been involved in a freak accident, (some accounts suggestthis was somewhere on the M1, others that it occurred in London,) where he wasnear-decapitated and killed instantly. In this version of the story, newsquickly reached the remaining three and their management who panicked,anticipating mass suicides among Beatles fans if the news got out, and workedalongside British 'intelligence' services to quickly replace Paul with a doubleso that the public would be none the wiser and the group could continue asbefore. (I'd initially scoffed at the idea of any announcement of Paul's deathbeing the cause of mass suicides among fans. Then I saw the headlines after ZaynMalik left One Direction in 2015, with accounts of young females taking toself-mutilation in their despair and counselling helplines being set-up to aidfans through their grief, so I stand corrected on that one. Still, the idea ofM16 being concerned about young Beatles fans committing suicide seemsimplausible given that this particular agency is not exactly famed for the greatvalue it places on human life.)According to some accounts, this happened on 9th November 1966 – so an earlyshowing for 9/11, as that date is expressed in the UK format, merged with acouple of sixes for good measure. This was a Wednesday, and the lyric 'Wednesdaymorning papers didn't come' in the later song 'Lady Madonna' is taken by some tobe a lyrical clue as to the cover-up and press blackout that was hastilyarranged by the forces that controlled the Beatles. As an aside, 9th November1966 is also said to be the date that John Lennon first met Yoko Ono, havingbeen introduced by Paul McCartney. This event is taken by many Beatles fans tospell the beginning of the end for the group, so the date could carry somesymbolic 'death' relevance in that sense. And by way of additional curiosity,Mary Kelly, the final victim of Jack The Ripper, is reported to have beenmurdered on 9th November 1888 – 9/11/88.Others, however, assume the date to have been the US-style rendering of 9/11,suggesting it occurred on 11th September 1966. (This is another date loaded withBeatles-related 9/11 synchronicity. John Lennon appeared on 'The Dick CavettShow' on US TV on 11th September 1971 to premier the film for his song'Imagine', and the recording date for the song 'Glass Onion' on 'The WhiteAlbum' is given as 11th September 1968.) I was greatly impressed to see therespected US researcher Jim Fetzer cover the McCartney deception in great detailin a series of essays he brought together for his 2015 book 'And I Suppose WeDidn't Go To The Moon Either.' Fetzer points out that the 11th September date isthe more likely one for McCartney's death, since Beatles manager Brian Epsteinannounced the following month that the group would no longer be performing live,citing the unconvincing reason they could no longer hear themselves play abovethe screams from the audience. Why would Epstein have needed to make thisdiversionary statement in October if Paul didn't die until the following month,Fetzer asks?An alternative spin on the story of McCartney's demise suggests he stopped topick up a female hitchhiker he saw in the rain. Supposedly her name was Rita, asin the song 'Lovely Rita'. Once Rita realised who the driver was, she excitedlytried to hug him, causing the crash, though it's difficult to understand howthis story could have got out if true, since no-one other than 'Rita' would haveknown it happened. This smacks of the over-embellishment of a myth.There are two other possible motives for the Beatles' controllers to have workedso desperately to find an instant replacement if you go for this version of thestory. One is straight corporate greed; the group had become such money-spinnersfor everyone in their camp, that there was much at stake if it were all to cometo an abrupt, unplanned end. The other is that, more important than the Beatles'financial potential, was the original reason for their engineered creation – asa Tavistock Institute-spawned exercise in brainwashing and social engineeringfor an entire generation of young people that had not yet achieved all of itsgoals.This version of events certainly seems far-fetched, because it relies on theBeatles team being able to find someone within days who looked and soundedenough like the original McCartney, had sufficient musical ability to be able toimpersonate him convincingly, and had nothing in his diary for the next 50-plusyears. That's the trouble with household name-impersonating doubles. There'snever one around when you need them.. . . OR 'ACCIDENT'?It's the second variation of the PID legend that carries more plausibility in mybook. In this version, McCartney's demise was no tragic accident, but was animpeccably-planned affair, with enough time to identify and fully train a doubleto take his place, and to apply whatever cosmetic tweaking was needed to hisappearance. It's an equally big ask of whoever could have taken his place togive up their own identity for the rest of their life, but this version at leastoffers a substantial preparatory period. The offing of the real Paul wouldeither have been some form of ritual sacrifice favoured by the dark controllersof the entertainment industry, (there's more on this whole subject in laterchapters,) or a damage-limitation exercise assuming McCartney had becometroublesome and unco-operative with the agenda he was expected to be fulfilling.Some believe that McCartney was unhappy about the radical change in the Beatles'music that was scheduled for the latter half of the 60s, tying in with thepsychedelic era and LSD, and that he had become a liability to these plans. Thereal Paul is also rumoured to have taken a healthy interest in the detailssurrounding the recent JFK assassination, and to have started questioning theofficial story. He is known to have offered to create the music score to theJFK-related movie 'Rush To Judgement.'The suggestion that the method of execution may actually have been an arrangedcar accident is, of course, a possibility. Memories of the death of PrincessDiana will come flooding back to many, but few will be aware that this exactsame method of assassination – by applying a blinding light to a car as itpassed through a tunnel – was being planned by British 'intelligence' servicesfor Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic during the Balkan War, as revealed byformer M16 employee Richard Tomlinson during the inquest into Diana's death. Itseems a good idea can always be recycled.The only remaining option is that the real McCartney wasn't killed but, forwhatever reason, 'disappeared' into a life of obscurity, but this to me seemslike the most improbable of the possibilities.Arguably the leading proponent of the PID theory is Tina Foster, proprietor ofthe website plasticmacca.blogspot.com [http://plasticmacca.blogspot.com],('Macca' has long been McCartney's public nickname in the UK.) I interviewed herfor one of my 'Good Vibrations' podcasts on the date of James Paul McCartney's72nd birthday in 2014, where she ran through the whole story and many of the keyclues. You can listen to it here –https://soundcloud.com/mark-devlin/good-vibrations-podcast-vol-42.[https://soundcloud.com/mark-devlin/good-vibrations-podcast-vol-42.]She postulates that the replacement of McCartney took place not in November, butin late August 1966. This would have been shortly after the Beatles' concert inSeattle on the 25th, and before a press conference in Los Angeles on the 28th.(The following day marked their concert in Candlestick Park, San Francisco,their last live performance with the exception of the Abbey Road rooftop jam in1969.) The LA press event is taken by many to be the first public appearance of'Faul' (faux Paul,) as the alleged impostor has come to be known.I included a section on the PID theory in a talk I gave in Liverpool a couple ofyears back. In the interval, a guy came up to me and said, 'you do realise allthe Beatles were replaced and not just McCartney, don't you?' I'd certainlyheard the idea that Lennon was replaced, but not the whole group. The guy saidhe once presented this in a public talk in the Beatles' home city, and hadnarrowly escaped getting chased down the street and lynched for blasphemy. WhileI know that doubles have been widely used for public figures – particularlypoliticians and world leaders – my brain just can't deal with more than oneBeatle at a time. And this would of course mean that the 'John Lennon' who putout such profound music throughout the 1970s and who was apparently assassinatedin December 1980, wasn't really him at all, but a double!For the record, though, Tina Foster is open to the idea of Lennon beingreplaced, as well as McCartney, and details her observations on the subjecthere: * http://plasticmacca.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/imagine-john-fennon.html [http://plasticmacca.blogspot.co.uk/2014/10/imagine-john-fennon.html]Well, no-one ever made the claim that this conspiracy game is straightforward.METHODS TO THE MADNESSBefore we examine some of the many clues that have been put forward by fans overthe decades – and there are reckoned to be at least 400 – it's worth bearing inmind a couple of factors. As I hope the rest of this book shows, theentertainment industry, just like the world in general, is nothing like we'vespent most of our lives thinking it is. The same forces are at work throughout,and the uncomfortable truth is that they are steeped in Satanism, Luciferianismand other dark occult practices. The evidence to support this is so widespreadthat I don't know what more to say to anyone who still doesn't accept it.In this context, their rituals have always been of supreme importance, as hasKabbalistic numerology. They are equally obsessed with symbolism, and havedemonstrated their need to cryptically encode their intentions and their pastdeeds into works of popular culture. This, in their sick, twisted mindset,allows them to escape the proper karmic consequence for their evils, because, asthey see it, they gave the public the opportunity to know what they have done,and to therefore object. When no objection is voiced, (how could it be when theinformation is so ambiguous?) they take this as the tacit approval of themasses, and a green light to keep pressing on. This is a complicated conceptrelated to a deep understanding of Natural Law, and I'll go into this further inthe final section of the book and in the chapter on Predictive Programming. Iwould suggest that their logic in assuming they can cheat the moral laws of theuniverse in this way suggests supreme ego-driven arrogance, and a deeply flawedunderstanding of how everything works, bringing with it some very heavy payback.Either way, this all stands as a point of reference to bear in mind beforediving fully down the PID rabbit hole.THE MAKINGS OF A MYTHThere are claims that some vigilant Beatles fans noticed anomalies withMcCartney straight away in 1966. There was also an incident in January 1967which resurrected the death rumour, when his Mini was involved in a road smash,(on the M1 again.) It turned out, however, that McCartney was not in the car atthe time, and that it was being driven by a Moroccan student named MohammedHadjij.Here, the story is taken up by an article on thebeatlesbible.com[http://thebeatlesbible.com] website:\"Hadjij was an assistant to London art gallery owner Robert Fraser. The pairturned up at McCartney's house on the evening of 7th January, and were laterjoined by Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Brian Jones and antiques dealerChristopher Gibbs. The party decided to head to Jagger's home in Hertfordshire,before moving on to Redlands, Richards' Sussex mansion (and scene of his laterdrugs bust). McCartney travelled with Jagger in the latter's Mini Cooper, whileHadjij drove in McCartney's Mini.\"The two cars became separated during the journey. Hadjij crashed McCartney'sMini and was hospitalised with injuries. The heavily customised car was highlyrecognisable, so rumours began circulating that McCartney had been killed in theincident. The following month a paragraph appeared in the February 1967 editionof the 'Beatles Book Monthly' magazine, headed 'False Rumour':\"Stories about the Beatles are always flying around Fleet Street. The 7thJanuary was very icy, with dangerous conditions on the M1 motorway, linkingLondon with the Midlands, and towards the end of the day, a rumour swept Londonthat Paul McCartney had been killed in a car crash on the M1. But, of course,there was absolutely no truth in it at all, as the Beatles' Press Officer foundout when he telephoned Paul's St. John's Wood home and was answered by Paulhimself who had been at home all day with his black Mini Cooper safely locked upin the garage.\"So much for that one then.It wasn't until 1969 that the replacement theory gained mainstream prominence.The first known print reference came from an article penned by Tim Harper thatappeared in the 17th September edition of 'The Times-Delphic', the newspaper ofthe Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Harper claimed later that his articlewas written for entertainment purposes only, and that he'd got the informationfrom a fellow student named Dartanyan Brown, who in turn, claimed he'd heard thestory from a musician in California.This article seems to have led to the now-legendary phone call to DJ Russ Gibb'sshow on Detroit radio station WKNR-FM on 12th October 1969. The caller,identifying himself as 'Tom,' told Gibb that McCartney was dead and that theBeatles had placed a clue in the track 'Revolution No. 9.' He urged Gibb to playthe record backwards, which he somehow achieved, and the repeated phrase 'numbernine, number nine, number nine', was heard as 'turn me on, dead man.' PID'smythical status was born. The day before Gibb's show, the Beatles' press officerDerek Taylor had responded to the rumour, stating: \"Recently we've been gettinga flood of inquiries asking about reports that Paul is dead. We've been gettingquestions like that for years, of course, but in the past few weeks we've beengetting them at the office and home night and day. I'm even getting telephonecalls from disc jockeys and others in the United States.\"Two days after the Gibb programme, however, an article entitled 'McCartney Dead;New Evidence Brought to Light' was published by 'The Michigan Daily.' It was asatirical review of the 'Abbey Road' album credited to University of Michiganstudent Fred LaBour. He confessed that he had invented many of the clues that hehad cited as pointing to McCartney's death. Despite this, however, the mythfailed to go away, and LaBour's admission seems to have only fuelled a hugeappetite among Beatles fans to scour their record collection for further clues.THE MACCA MISSIONThe 1969 rumour had gained such prominence that a mission had begun in the pressto try and track 'McCartney' down. He had not been seen in public for some time– perhaps wisely if he was the replacement, as there would have been renewedscrutiny of his appearance, height, accent, etc. By way of an 'official'confirmation that all was well, 'Life' magazine commissioned a journalist totravel to McCartney's Scottish farm on Mull Of Kintyre, where they reported himto be alive and well, living with wife Linda and their children, andcontemplating his forthcoming solo career with the Beatles now all but finished.In the edition of the magazine dated 7th November 1969, in an article headed'The Case Of The 'Missing' Beatle – Paul Is Still With Us,' McCartney is quotedas saying: \"Rumours of my death have been greatly exaggerated,\" paraphrasingMark Twain. \"However,\" he continued, \"if I was dead, I'm sure I'd be the last toknow.\" He added: \"Perhaps the rumour started because I haven't been much in thepress lately. I have done enough press for a lifetime, and I don't have anythingto say these days. I am happy to be with my family and I will work when I work.\"BBC Radio 4 also sent their reporter Chris Drake on the same mission, and'Rolling Stone' magazine published an article assuring that McCartney was stillalive.This particular edition of the magazine didn't quite put the theories to rest aseffectively as some would have liked, when it was discovered that if you holdthe front page up to the light, some bleed-through from a car advertisement onthe other side can be seen. This has the visual effect of cutting Paul's head inhalf, with the speeding car emerging through the middle of his body.FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBITThere are literally hundreds of lyrical and sonic clues that are said to havebeen found in Beatles music, and visual hints on record sleeves to support PID.And for every single claim of a valid 'clue' there are stories to rubbish it as'disinformation.' Entering into the PID rabbit hole is guaranteed to take updays or weeks of any researcher's time in trying to assimilate and validate allthe information. It certainly piqued my interest to that degree. It would beimpractical to list every single clue that's been identified here – that's awhole book in itself, and there is an unending supply of websites, forums andYoutube videos for readers wanting to study the full set. I'll just summarise afew of the most frequently-cited ones here. * The previously-referenced avant-garde track 'Revolution No. 9' from 'The White Album' is generally taken to be the Beatles' most obscure recording, much of it consisting of effects and noise. When played in reverse, besides the 'turn me on, dead man' message, many claim to hear other clues such as the sound of a fiery car crash and someone screaming “let me out.” * The rest of 1968's 'The White Album' was thoroughly searched for clues by fans. A major one was supposedly found in a back-masked message at the end of 'I'm So Tired.' As the music fades at the end, John Lennon can be heard speaking incomprehensibly. When this is played in reverse, some hear the words 'Paul is dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him.' * Meaning has been placed on a couple of lines from 'I Am The Walrus', a bizarre track by any standards. The line 'man you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long' certainly has some compatibility with the observation that the pre-'66 McCartney's face appeared rounder than in post-'66. Just before it is the reference to 'stupid bloody Tuesday'. Fans claim that McCartney was last seen alive on a Tuesday, (though 11th September and 9th November '66 were a Sunday and a Wednesday respectively, which blows that particular theory out.) The 'eggman' lyric is supposed to be a reference to Humpty Dumpty, who cracked his head open, as did Paul according to the legend. * 'I Am The Walrus' was inspired by occultist author Lewis Carroll and the poem 'Jabberwocky.' An excerpt from this reads: 'She puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck her. ‘Why, it’s a looking-glass book, of course! And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.' This, according to researchers, adds further validity to reversing Beatles recordings to find hidden messages. Paul is said to have occasionally used the alias 'Ian Iachimoe', which sounds like 'Paul McCartney' being said in reverse.The 'Walrus' phrase has other dubious connotations, meanwhile. Crazedpsychopaths, it seems, are not without a warped sense of irony when it comes tonaming their operations. The music writer Alex Constantine in his book 'TheCovert War Against Rock,' reveals that Project Walrus was a below-the-radarCIA-controlled black op, involving surveillance, psychological operations andassassinations. John Lennon's murder, and the subsequent defacing and'disappearing' of his journals and other materials, are all said to haveoccurred at the hands of 'Walrus,' staffed by some of the people who wereclosest to Lennon, including Beatles chauffeur and author of 'The Last Days ofJohn Lennon: A Personal Memoir,' Fred Seaman. * In the song 'Glass Onion,' Lennon sings: 'Looking through a glass onion. I told you about the walrus and me, man. You know that we're close as can be, man. Well, there's another clue for you all: the walrus was Paul.\" Some have said this is a reference to a Nordic belief that the walrus is a sign of death, whilst a 'glass onion' is said to be a nickname for the transparent corner knob of a coffin. * The song 'Nowhere Man' is supposed to be a maudlin reference to Paul's corpse state: 'He's a real nowhere man, sitting in his nowhere land, making all his nowhere plans for nobody.' * Meaning has been placed on the lyric: 'You were in a car crash and you lost your hair' from the song 'Don't Pass Me By' as being a reference to the mythical accident. A similar reference is said to come from the words: \"He hit a light pole. We better get him to see a surgeon. So, anyhow, he went to see a dentist instead, gave him a pair of teeth that weren't any good at all. My wings are broken and so is my hair,\" as part of the jumbled noise of 'Revolution No. 9'. This could certainly be seen as tying in with the findings of two Italian forensic experts, (who we'll meet in a while), who observed that the dental palates of the pre-1966 Paul and those of Faul appear completely different, but that the latter could have undergone surgery to make one tooth look crooked to more closely emulate his predecessor. * The lyric in 'Hello Goodbye' from 1967, 'You say goodbye, I say hello' is taken by some to mean Faul is saying goodbye to the real McCartney, and introducing himself as the new one. * Some claim the phrase 'it was a fake moustache,' referring to attempts to conceal Faul's recent plastic surgery, can be heard when the chorus to 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band' is played backwards. * The phrase 'Ma Ma Ma McCartney, he's dead', dead, dead, dead, dead' is said to be encoded backwards in 'Hey Jude'. * John Lennon's song 'How Do You Sleep,' an acknowledged bitter swipe at McCartney, contains the lyric: 'Them freaks was right when they said you was dead, the one mistake you made was in your head.' Some feel this is a reference to the obvious differences in appearance between the pre- and post-replacement McCartneys. A further lyric goes: 'A pretty face may last a year or two, but pretty soon they'll see what you can do.' * There are claims of a backwards message contained in the song 'Magical Mystery Tour,' where the words 'Will Paul be back as Superman?' can be heard. * On page 13 of the 'Magical Mystery Tour' album insert, there is a photo of McCartney playing bass in his socks with a pair of bloody shoes next to him, insinuating that there should be someone else standing in the spot. * On 1970's 'Let It Be' album sleeve, Paul is the only Beatle pictured with a blood-red background added. Originally the photos were in black and white. * John Lennon can supposedly be heard faintly muttering 'I buried Paul' at the end of 'Strawberry Fields Forever.' Lennon has addressed this particular one in interviews, claiming he was in fact saying 'cranberry sauce' or 'I'm very bored.' * McCartney admitted to planting hidden clues and messages in his album 'Memory Almost Full.' Lennon has also admitted the Beatles were always placing clues in their records: 'All our messages were subliminal.'CRACKING THE CODEThe idea that secret messages could be cryptically encoded in the first place isby no means far-fetched. An excerpt from the www.baconsocietyinc.org[http://www.baconsocietyinc.org] website, charting the activities of theenigmatic Sir (what else?) Francis Bacon, (who many attest was the real WilliamShakespeare,) states:\"Many Baconians of the esoteric persuasion hold that Bacon and his fellowoccultists encoded secret messages or cryptograms into printed books, using bothtext and image. Bacon himself is believed by some to have told an outlandishsecret history through such cryptogrammic methods.\"Anyone who's read Dan Brown's novels, or seen the films starring Tom Hanks, willdoubtless recall that the hero, Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon, spends hisadventures deciphering ancient esoteric codes to solve mysteries. It's the samedynamic at work. Dan Brown would appear to be highly in-the-know as to what goeson, and it's no coincidence that his books started to appear in an era when,fuelled by the internet, public interest in matters of the occult, symbology,and the existence of powerful secret societies has never been stronger.Given that those who ultimately pull the strings of the entertainment industryare steeped in the same mystery school traditions that have been in place forcenturies, it takes no wild stretch of the imagination to assume that tried andtested tactics from ages past might still be put to use in contemporary times.ANOMALIES ABOUNDJames Paul McCartney was left-handed. In a 1963 interview, he said: \"The onlything I couldn’t cure myself of was being left-handed. I do everything with myleft hand, and no matter how I try I can’t change the habit. I just seem to doeverything back-to-front. I used to even write backwards. Every time theschoolmasters would look at my handwriting they would throw swinging fits.\" Frommid-1966 onward, fans started noticing that 'Paul' was using his right hand forkey tasks – holding bottles of beer and cups of tea, smoking, and most notably,holding and playing his guitar. Adherents to the PID theory have observed that,however much you might be able to alter the appearance of an impostor, and eventrain them musically and vocally, you can never turn a right-handed personleft-handed, or vice-versa.Many PID adherents have also pointed to what they consider to be the strangereaction of McCartney to news of the death of John Lennon in 1980. In footagewidely available on Youtube, Paul appears nonchalant, chewing gum and writingoff the sudden murder of the old friend with whom he had written musical historyas 'a drag.'This would certainly tie in with claims that Lennon and the McCartneyreplacement were never able to get along. Sceptics, meanwhile, have claimed thatMcCartney's seemingly flippant reaction could have been down to shock and theimpact of the situation having not yet sunken in. Readers must make up their ownminds. You can view the reaction here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf30KfAUK5k[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xf30KfAUK5k]This brings in a possible motive for Lennon's assassination according to some,who have speculated on whether, no longer able to live with the terrible secret,he was about to spill the beans on the McCartney deception and had to be swiftlysilenced. (That's if you don't go for the theory that he's still alive!) Therehas been similar speculation regarding the frenzied knife attack on GeorgeHarrison by an intruder in his home in 1999 which he survived, only to die oflung cancer two years later.WHAT THE DRUMMER KNEWIn a May 2011 interview with the UK's 'Daily Mail,' Ringo Starr stated twicethat he was 'the last remaining Beatle.' His exact comments were reported asfollows:\"I think it's people on the outside who perceive Paul as thinking he's the onlyone left. Actually, it's me. I am the last remaining Beatle.\"You all know that the only person round this table who can go is me. I was inthe biggest Rock & Roll band in the history of music. I am the last remainingBeatle.\"Starr did, however, precede these comments by referring to McCartney as follows:\"We are good friends. We don’t live in each-other’s pockets, but if we’re in thesame country, we get together. He’s singing and playing on my latest album and Iplayed on several of his. We’re just pals. We’re the only two who’ve experiencedall this who are still here.\"The Mail states that \"deadpan is (Ringo's) default setting.\" It's impossible toknow if comments such as this just slip out, as an involuntary rendering of thetruth, or if they're all part of the Beatles' mischievous sense of humour,knowing that they will further empower the PID rumours and thus the bankbalances of those from the Beatles camp who are still alive, as new generationsof fans arm themselves with copies of their music to search for further clues.What Ringo Knew took on new life in early March 2015, meanwhile, when whatpurported to be a new interview with the drummer went viral on-line. It was saidto have been given to a publication known as 'The Hollywood Inquirer,' andclaimed that Ringo had decided to break his silence on the McCartney deceptionafter almost 50 years. He went on to basically reinforce the story of McCartneydying in a tragic accident on 9th November 1966 and an impostor by the name ofWilliam Shears Campbell being swiftly groomed as his replacement.This was followed a couple of days later by an alleged response from'McCartney', completely refuting Ringo's claims, as reported on the site WorldNews Daily Report. 'McCartney' is quoted as saying: “I know that Ringo isgrowing senile and losing his mind, but he doesn’t need to invent such idioticstories to attract attention . . . I’ve seen Ringo do and say many stupid thingsin my life, but this is one of the worst! If he’s so badly in need of mediacoverage, he could just invent crap about himself without implicating me in hisdelirium.\"World News Daily Report, it turns out, is a well-known spoof site thatspecialises in satire. Its 'About Us' section states: \"World News Daily Reportis an American Jewish Zionist newspaper based in Tel Aviv . . . Our News Team iscomposed of award winning Christian, Muslim and Jewish journalists, retiredMossad agents and veterans of the Israeli Armed Forces.\" Similarly, there's thesmall matter of 'The Hollywood Inquirer' not actually existing.While there's an amusing side to this rendering of the subject, stories such asthese also serve to reinforce the apparent absurdity of it in the minds of many.It follows that any researchers seriously proposing the idea are then treatedwith the same scorn and ridicule, regardless of what validity the evidence theyput forward may have. You have to question, therefore, whether or not there is adeliberate element of disinformation in such 'spoofs' appearing.PEPPER BOMBSAcres of meaning and interpretation have been applied to the iconic 'Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,' the first Beatles studio album since thealleged replacement. The sleeve design is credited to 'Sir' (count 'em) PeterBlake, known as 'the Godfather of pop-art' and a tutor and close friend of thepaedophile artist Graham Ovenden, who was sentenced to two years' imprisonmentin 2013 at the age of 70 for sexual offences against children. Besides Blake,McCartney, (the fake one, if you go for the theory,) is said to have had astrong influence on its composition, along with his friend Robert Fraser. Fraserwas, in turn, linked to the satanist film-maker and mentor to the RollingStones, Kenneth Anger. Anger had introduced both the Stones and the Beatles tothe works of Aleister Crowley, and in particular, the OTO occult secret societywhich has proven a fascination for many a rock star through the decades.Reportedly, it was only McCartney for whom it all had any real appeal. Fraserand McCartney intended the 'Sgt. Pepper' sleeve to be a kind of treasure mapfull of clues that could be deciphered by those in the know, but which would goover the heads of the 'profane' masses.(Incidentally, although the 'Sgt. Pepper' track 'Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds'has long been taken to be a barely-concealed reference to LSD, which theBeatles' psychedelic period was being used to help embed into youth culture,there is an alternative interpretation to its meaning. 'Lucy' can be taken to bea depiction of 'Lucifer,' an entity revered by the OTO and other occult mysteryschools, and the 'Diamonds' reference is highly reminiscent of the 'Roc' sign ofJay-Z and co. that we'll encounter in a later chapter – really an ancient symbolused by the OTO and other Crowley-related secret societies.)A depiction of Crowley himself famously appears in the top-left of the albumsleeve. Some have claimed that the opening line to the album, 'it was 20 yearsago today,' was a kind of veiled tribute to Crowley, who died in 1947. That wasin December, however, whereas the album was released in June '67, so technicallyit was 'nineteen and a half years ago today.' Crowley is far from alone in termsof questionable choices of 'heroes,' however. The blogger Pinball King in hisarticle titled 'What's Wrong With the Beatles?', lists some of the othersdepicted, as follows:\"Other 'heroes' include four Indian gurus (occult mysticism,) Carl Jung (occultpsychology,) Edgar Allan Poe (alcoholic horror mystic,) Aldous Huxley(globalist, eugenicist, LSD promoter,) William S. Burroughs (homosexual junkiemurderer,) Karl Marx (satanic father of communism according to 'Marx and Satan'by Richard Wurmbrand,) Oscar Wilde (homosexual writer,) George Bernard Shaw(racist eugenicist,) Lewis Carroll (paedophile,) Marlene Dietrich (decadentlesbian singer,) James Joyce (alcoholic writer,) Lenny Bruce (junkie comedian,)H.G. Wells (eugenicist occultist writer,) Terry Southern (obscene writer,)Sigmund Freud (neurotic father of psychoanalysis,) a doll of six-year-oldShirley Temple with a shirt that says 'Welcome The Rolling Stones' withblood-stained gloves (implied paedophilia,) and a legionnaire from the Order ofthe Buffalo (behind the standing Shirley Temple.)\"There is also a doll of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi pointing 'as above, sobelow', a hookah (drug bong,) a purple velvet snake (serpent/ Satan/ phallic,)Snow White (from occultist Walt Disney,) a Mexican Tree of Life (usuallydepicting the serpent Satan offering Adam and Eve forbidden knowledge in theGarden of Eden,) and a Saturn trophy (sun/ Satan) near the 'L' (90-degreesquare.)\"Note Ringo's flat hat ('Here come ol' flat-top',) resembling that of15th-century occultist Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, and George's secret societybicorn hat.And later:\"The Beatles also wanted to include their 'hero' Adolf Hitler on the cover of'Sgt. Pepper,' but were not permitted by EMI. Hitler waits forlornly in thewings, to the right. If you think this was just John's grim humour, then here'sa quote from Paul: 'I had the idea that instead of Hell's Angels, they put uppictures of Hitler and the latest Nazi signs and leather and that. We went intoit just like that. Just us doing a good show.\"Researchers and fans claim to have uncovered many other visual clues in thesleeve: * On the right-hand side of the front cover is a figure with a child seated in its lap, with the caption 'welcome The Rolling Stones, good guys' on her T-shirt, and with what looks like a bloodstained driving glove. The child, (said to be Shirley Temple,) is holding a white sports car in one hand. * The focal point of the front cover is the word 'Beatles' spelled out in flowers on a grave. There are wax dummies of George, Ringo and Paul in their early days looking at the grave, whereas John is looking away. Amid the grave are yellow flowers shaped like a guitar. This has been taken to mean that 'Sgt. Pepper,' the first album since the alleged replacement, signifies that the old Beatles are dead and gone, never to return. * Paul is markedly taller than the other Beatles on the front cover. On the reverse, his back is turned to the camera, perhaps signifying that he does not fit in. * A hand is held up behind Paul's head on the front cover which, in some religions, is seen as a mystical depiction of death. A hand raised behind Paul's head is a recurring clue in many photos of the band. * On the back cover, Paul is wearing an arm patch with what appear to be the letters 'OPD,' which is police jargon in Britain for 'Officially Pronounced Dead.' This one is frequently debunked, however, as actually reading 'OPP,' standing for Ontario Provincial Police. Paul was apparently given the patch while on tour in Canada. * In a real mindblower, it's been pointed out that if you hold a mirror horizontally across the words 'lonely hearts' on the front cover's bass drum, with the reflective part of the mirror pointing away, the letters in both the mirror and the album collectively spell out '1 ONE 1 X= HE/DIE.' The \"/\", resembling an upward arrow, points at Paul. This phrase has been claimed to be marking out the date of the alleged death. The 1 and ONE make 11, whereas I and X equals 9 in Roman numerals. Together these form 11/9, (or 9/11 in reverse.) * The blogger known as Horselover Phat, meanwhile, as part of his truly fascinating and impeccably-researched article, applies Crowley's 'law of reversal' to the front sleeve image, demonstrating that even more symbolism crops up when you create a full mirror image. I thoroughly recommend a delve into this article for all who want to truly absorb themselves in the Sgt. Pepper magic(k) – http://subliminalsynchrosphere.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/oto-hip-hop-hollywood-and-msm-masonic.html [http://subliminalsynchrosphere.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/oto-hip-hop-hollywood-and-msm-masonic.html] * The official story behind the lyric 'he blew his mind out in a car, he didn't notice that the lights had changed' in the track 'A Day In The Life,' is that it refers to the socialite and heir to the Guinness empire Tara Browne, who died aged 21 in the same way that Paul is supposed to have done, in a car crash, on 18th December 1966. There are reports that this occurred after an LSD session with McCartney, and that Browne was travelling in excess of 100mph. According to the Wikipedia account of his death: \"He failed to see a traffic light and proceeded through the junction of Redcliffe Square and Redcliffe Gardens, colliding with a parked lorry. He died of his injuries the following day.\"Many have questioned this account, however, by pointing out a few discrepancies.Among them are the observation that it's impossible to get anywhere near a speedof 100mph in highly built-up Central London. Photos of his crashed car show onlyminor damage, too, which is certainly not compatible with a fatal crash at thatspeed. This has led to claims of foul play in Browne's death from some quarters.It may have been the origin of Lennon's further line in 'A Day In The Life:''Well, I just had to laugh. I saw the photograph.'THE CRYPTIC CROSSINGThe other album whose sleeve design has been pored over and studied to the pointof obsession is 'Abbey Road.' It's this album's iconic image of the band walkingover the zebra crossing which seemingly inspired the call to Russ Gibb's radioshow, springboarding the world of PID into the mainstream.Significance has been placed on the group members apparently depicting a funeralprocession. John, dressed in white, is supposed to represent a priest, Ringo inblack is said to be a pallbearer, with George, in denim, as a gravedigger. Paul,in a scruffy suit, is out of step with the others, and is barefoot. It has beenpointed out that corpses are traditionally buried barefoot in several Europeancountries. Left-handed Paul is holding a cigarette in his right hand. A VWBeetle car parked in the road displays the licence plate '28IF', and fans havesaid this means McCartney would have been 28 if he'd lived. This one doesn'tquite work though. 'Abbey Road' was released in 1969, at which point McCartney,born in June '42, would only have been 27.On the back of the sleeve the words 'the Beatles' are spray-painted on a brickwall, but with a crack running through the name, signifying for some that theoriginal four have been split. This ties in with many other suggested cluespertaining to three Beatles, rather than four. Among those unearthed have beenthe family coat-of-arms of key Beatles producer George Martin. This featuresthree beetle insects in the crest. It has been noted that, with six legs each,the three could be taken as a depiction of 6/6/6. The scarab to the left of thecrest appears to have a Kabbalah 'Tree of Life' pattern. (The Guinness Family'scoat of arms, meanwhile, features a raised hand very similar to the one thatappears behind Paul on the 'Sgt. Pepper' sleeve!)THE SCIENCE FOR A SWITCHFor the more scientifically-minded who don't go for the concepts of crypticsymbolism and the occult, and prefer cold, hard, verifiable fact, there's noshortage of this available when it comes to forensic evidence to support theidea of a switch.Even a cursory glance at certain photos of McCartney prior to and after 1966show some anomalies. His face is much rounder and fatter in earlier pictures,but is much longer with a more pronounced jawline after '66. The eyes seem tohave changed colour. Then there's the issue of Paul's height. In early picturesof the band, McCartney is roughly the same height as John Lennon and GeorgeHarrison, all approximately 5'11\". Post-1966, however, McCartney towers overLennon in pictures, not least in the sleeve photos for the 'Sgt. Pepper' album.In August 2009, the Italian magazine 'Wired' ran an article focusing on thefindings of two Italian forensic experts, Francesco Gavazzeni and GabriellaCarlesi. The pair had set out to finally put an end to the persistent PIDtheories by proving that no replacement had taken place, but ended up concludingthe exact opposite in the face of the evidence. They conducted a biometricalanalysis of Paul pre- and post-1966, and reported discrepancies in the facialfeatures that could not be accounted for by error or plastic surgery. There's athorough breakdown of the conclusions here –http://hugequestions.com/Eric/TFC/FromOthers/Paul-McCartney-Italian.html[http://hugequestions.com/Eric/TFC/FromOthers/Paul-McCartney-Italian.html]Among the key findings, the Italians decided that the front curvature of the jawbetween photos is different, there is evidence of imperfect cosmetic surgeryaround the area of the eyes, the line separating Faul's lips is much wider,which perhaps accounts for his growing of a moustache to hide it, the ear shapediffers widely, (something which cannot be modified by surgery,) and the teethare different, with Faul's crooked tooth suggesting dental surgery to simulatethe real Paul's. (Faul apparently displays a chipped tooth, however, consistentwith the real Paul chipping his in a motorcycle accident in late 1965.)An article on the hugequestions.com [http://hugequestions.com] website observed:\"Therefore, if the conspiracy theories are false, ie, if the Paul McCartney thatwe see today with a large palate is the original Paul McCartney with a smallpalate – then Paul went through some very serious dental surgeries, and he wouldhave suffered for a long time, and it would have had an effect on his voice.\"The more logical conclusion is that the Paul McCartney of today is asubstitute, and that Faul went through a much simpler dental operation to makeone of his teeth crooked.\"An intriguing incident occurred in January 1980 when McCartney arrived for atour in Japan, and ended up being imprisoned for nine days when a customsofficer found marijuana in his luggage. There are claims that McCartney'sfingerprints were taken, but did not match those already held on record, (he hadpreviously toured Japan in early 1966), and that this was the real reason forhis incarceration before some useful intervention from higher up secured hisrelease.Then there was a paternity case involving a German woman named BettinaKrischbin, who emerged in 2007 to allege that she was his illegitimate daughter.The claim was that during the Beatles' early days of playing in Hamburg,McCartney had an affair with her mother, and that Bettina was the result.McCartney has always denied being the woman's father and when the blood testproved negative in 1984, a Berlin court dismissed her claim. However, this storytook a freak twist when Bettina claimed that McCartney cheated the blood testsby sending a stand-in. Adding fuel to the fire, she also stated: \"The signaturein the old documents is false. We have found the signature is from aright-handed person, but Paul is left-handed.\"She told 'Bild Zeitung' magazine that McCartney, estimated to be worth almost £1billion, gave her mother 30,000 deutsch marks in 1966, followed by 200DM a monthfor years. \"Why would he do that if he supposedly isn’t the father?,\" she asked.Erika Hübers said she supported her daughter's wish for a new paternity test andrecognition as McCartney's daughter. \"I think we have a good chance now,\" shesaid, \"because he lied to the court – provided it with false evidence.\"JUST WILLIAM?Of course, having digested all of the cryptic and scientific information, we'releft with a highly reasonable and vital question which still requires answering.If the real Paul McCartney is dead . . . who the hell is it that's been passinghimself off as Macca for the past fifty years? And furthermore, why would anyoneundertake such a monumental commitment and outrageous deception, knowing theycould never return to their former identity for as long as they go on living?Certainly, a lifetime of fame, fortune and untold wealth would be of appeal tomany, as the glut of 'talent' shows on TV constantly reminds us. In thiscontext, the idea of taking the place of an already-established superstar andenjoying the associated riches without having to climb the ladder yourself,could be of great egoic appeal. It's also worth bearing in mind that when itcomes to occult secret societies, members are known to swear oaths of allegiancethat last their entire lifetime, promising to never divulge secrets upon pain ofdeath, and with very high rewards offered as an incentive.(Incidentally, Faul's veganism at face value appears to be entirely at odds withthe idea of an unscrupulous charlatan happy to spend the rest of his daysimpersonating a beloved dead celebrity. But it could also be viewed as aningenious element to the deception. Benevolent-sounding cover stories often maskfar more nefarious activities. Some have even questioned the true nature of theLinda McCartney range of soya-based vegetarian foods, given that the healthrisks associated with a soy diet are now under much scrutiny.)The name that crops-up more than any other as a possible candidate for Faul isWilliam Shepherd 'Shears' Campbell, who is supposed to have been the winner of aPaul McCartney lookalike competition set by the Beatles' official magazine inthe 1960s. Campbell was apparently from Edinburgh. Adherents to the story thinkthat Campbell became of great interest when the plan was being hatched todispose of McCartney, and he was somehow co-opted into the scheme.Tina Foster and others have speculated that the line 'so may I introduce to you,the one and only Billy Shears' is a hint that the 'new' McCartney was beingunveiled on that album. To add further intrigue, included in the video 'Paul IsDead: The Shocking Clues Collection Video' available on Youtube, there is anout-take of George Harrison saying 'hello, William' as 'McCartney' enters aroom. Additionally, in the movie 'Give My Regards To Broad Street', a charactersays 'do you know William?', as McCartney walks in. Fans have also pointed tothe McCartney-penned track 'I Will' as being intended to mean 'I, Will'!Still others, meanwhile, surmise that 'William' and 'Billy Shears' are both slyreferences to William Shakespeare, another character whose true identity hascome in for much speculation. There are strong suggestions that Shakespeare wasactually a fictional composite character whose works were actually written bythe Royal courtier and occultist Sir Francis Bacon. Other accounts haveShakespeare down as being the close associate to Queen Elizabeth 1, Sir(naturally) John Dee, (whose codename of '007' was the inspiration for IanFleming's James Bond centuries later.) Shakespeare's works are loaded with thesame codes, ciphers and clues for those in the know, as the Beatles' post-1966works are said to be.In other apparent clues, it was reported that the original title of the 'AbbeyRoad' LP was to be 'Billy's Left Boot,' and in the live concert DVD 'The SpaceWithin Us,' there is allegedly a sign saying 'Bill' next to a shot of McCartney.Some have also suggested that the character of Bungalow Bill from the track 'TheContinuing Story Of . . . ' on 'The White Album' may have been a mockingreference to William Campbell/ Shears and his 'bungling' slip-ups in keeping upthe pretence.There have been other claims that early representations of the replacedMcCartney were none other than Denny Laine of The Moody Blues, meanwhile, andthat the Beatles song 'Penny Lane', with its lyrics 'Penny Lane is in my earsand in my eyes' is another clue, with 'Penny' really being 'Denny.' Butcomplication surrounding this one arises from the fact that 'McCartney' laterfounded the group Wings with Laine, and both appeared publicly together foryears, so I'm not entirely sure how that one works.In his essay entitled 'Replacing Paul: The Who, How & The Why,' James A Larsonpresents some other possible candidates for the doppelganger, albeit in aseemingly tongue-in-cheek style. These include Keith Allison, the winner of a1965 McCartney lookalike contest, Dino Danelli, member of the 60s US rock groupThe Rascals, British singer Ian Whitcomb, and a character by the name of PhilAckrill, who he claims is an alias for Vivian Stanshall, a member of the BonzoDog Doo-Dah Band, and the voice introducing the instruments at the end of MikeOldfield's 'Tubular Bells.' Vivian/ Phil is reported to have died in March 1995.It has been claimed that Faul is actually five years older than the originalPaul, meaning he would have been born in 1937, and that part of the surgeryprocess, and the initial growing of a moustache, was to disguise his lookingolder than his bandmates. Larson's essay asks whether the song 'When I'm 64,'with its lyric, 'will you still need me . . . when I'm 64?', could haverepresented the Faul character wondering whether his deception will have beendiscovered by then, or will still need to be kept up. If he was indeed born in1937, he would have been 64 in . . . 2001. That infamous year again.If there were ever any danger whatsoever of the waters becoming remotely clearin the world of PID, the American author and researcher Thomas E. Uharriet wasthere to ensure they became sufficiently murky again with 'The Memoirs Of BillyShears.' This epic tome, presented in the form of fictional memoirs written bythe replacement, offers the unique view that the genuine James Paul McCartneywas actually a willing participant in his own sacrifice, and that he was fullyaware of the character that would take on his identity for the rest of his days.There have also been claims that Uharriet wrote the book in league with Faul, asa way of the latter finally getting his story off his chest, but with it alldressed up as 'fiction' so plausible deniability could be claimed wheneverrequired. With 66 chapters, (nice touch,) somehow the printers saw to it thatthe book stretched to exactly 666 pages, and produced it with an acrostic codein place; the first letter in every other line combines to spell secret messageswhich are revealed in the sister book 'Billy Shears Acrostical Decoding.' Thebook was also released on 9th September 2009, so 09/09/09, (or 06/06/06upside-down if you prefer,) and this date just happened to be the same one onwhich Apple in the US released the back catalogue of Beatles albums in newdigitally-remastered CD form. For any brains that aren't already fried by allthe other clues, symbols and theories, this one will surely complete theprocess.SO IT'S GOODNIGHT FROM ME, AND IT'S GOODNIGHT FROM HIM'McCartney' seems to have found some amusement from the rumour over the years,having made occasional references to it. He parodied PID with his 1993 album'Paul Is Live.' The sleeve design was based on the infamous Abbey Road image.The '28IF' on the car number plate had been switched to '51IS.'At other times, meanwhile, (and bearing in mind we have almost 50 years' worthof interviews to draw on here,) McCartney has uttered some highly crypticcomments which, whether by design or accident, have only served as ammunitionfor the PID crowd's arguments. Or maybe it's down to the favourite manipulator'stactic of placing the truth right there in plain sight? His many ambiguousone-liners and soundbites have included:\"I'm not him. I'm some guy in a fictitious band.\"\"There are two Paul McCartneys.\"\"In a way, I think of Paul McCartney as ‘him.' I do wake up some mornings andthink, Jesus Christ, am I really that guy that is in the same body as I’minhabiting?\"\"I’ve learnt to compartmentalise. There’s me and there’s famous him. I don’twant to sound schizophrenic, but probably I’m two people.\"\"I've always had this thing of him and me; He goes on stage, He's famous, andthen me; I'm just some kid from Liverpool. Occasionally I stop and think, I amPaul McCartney! Feckin' hell, that is a total freak-out!”\"I look in the mirror and just think, I, in this shell, am the guy I’ve read somuch about. I don't know whether it’s a schizo thing. I’m very proud of him, butyou know, I don’t imagine I am him, ’cause otherwise it would just blow my headoff.”\"So I thought, being Paul McCartney, the whole bit is really, you know, too muchto live up to. The advantages, I like to think they outweigh the disadvantages.\"\"Why do the rumours come about? Because Paul McCartney’s dead, of course.\"\"I dreamed it, didn’t believe it was mine really. I didn’t even write it really,in a way.\" (Talking about the song 'Yesterday.')\"We were kind of experimenting with anything. I'd written the title song, and Iput it to the guys that, what we should do, we could make this record now underanother persona. Kind of like hiding behind a pseudonym.\" (Talking about theidentity of the character Sgt. Pepper.)Curiously, McCartney appeared on 'The David Letterman Show' at the Ed SullivanTheatre in New York, on 15th July 2009, the exact date that Italy's 'Wired'magazine published the findings of the two forensic experts. The pair jokedabout the replacement rumours, with McCartney quipping that he makes 'a verygood double.'To add to the ambiguity, Paul/ Faul guested on 'The Tonight Show With JimmyFallon' in late 2014, on which Fallon told him he does 'the best Paul McCartneyimpersonation.'And this article from the Plastic Macca site documents a modern-day McCartney ininterview stating he had 'a couple' of jobs in factories before the Beatles,which conflicts with what a young McCartney used to say. Are his homeworkstudies failing? He also seems to get confused about his age: * http://plasticmacca.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/oops-things-faul-says-sometimes.html [http://plasticmacca.blogspot.co.uk/2010/01/oops-things-faul-says-sometimes.html]TO THE POWER OF SIXThere does seem to be a lot of occult significance placed on the year 1966.Something about the sixes seems to appeal to the elite priest class. '66provided the backdrop for the alleged McCartney replacement, and was the yearthat the Beatles' music changed from innocent rhythm and blues-based pop songs,to the experimental sonics of the psychedelic age. John Lennon's first wife,Cynthia, said of the era in her book 'A Twist Of Lennon': \"The years 1966-67were tremendous years of mental and physical change for the Beatles.” Cynthiadied during the writing of this book in April 2015, so another original voicethat would surely have carried knowledge of any replacement, was lost forever.Another candidate would be Beatles associate and Liverpool contemporary CillaBlack.1966 was also the year that Anton LaVey founded The Church Of Satan. This was a'front' organisation that acted as a recruitment arm for higher-up degrees ofSatanism, and which has counted many 'celebrities' among its members, includingSammy Davis Jr., Jayne Mansfield, Liberace, Soft Cell frontman Marc Almond, andmore recently, Marilyn Manson who became a fully inducted priest appointed byLaVey himself. It's also interesting to note that 1966 has significance to RomanPolanski's 'Rosemary's Baby,' a darkly fascinating movie based on the Ira Levinnovel that contains many barely-hidden truths about how Satanism and theentertainment business are intrinsically linked. The film was released in 1968,but the narrative is set two years earlier in '66. This is described by the leadsatanist character as 'year one' and marks the birth of the Antichrist.'Rosemary's Baby' was set in the Dakota Building near New York City's CentralPark, which just happens to be where Lennon had an apartment for many years, andoutside which he was shot dead in December 1980. LaVey himself described'Rosemary's Baby' as 'the best paid commercial for Satanism since theInquisition.'(Incidentally, as with the McCartney rumour, Jayne Mansfield is said to havebeen virtually decapitated when she was involved in a car accident in 1967 withboyfriend Sam Brody. Some accounts have claimed that LaVey had put a curse onBrody, and took it particularly bad when Mansfield was killed as well.)Further ritual significance to 1966 comes from the fact that construction of theWorld Trade Center towers in Manhattan began in that year. They would stand for35 years before the events of September 11th 2001, and there is widespreadconjecture among 9/11 researchers that they were built with the specific purposeof being brought down decades later. Numerical symbolism is present throughout,(lots of 11s and a fair dose of our old mate Aleister Crowley's doctrines too.)Finally, '66 was the year that principal production took place on StanleyKubrick and Arthur C. Clarke's enigmatic masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey',even though, like 'Rosemary's Baby', it didn't get its commercial release until1968. It's intriguing that this story postulates something of world-changingsignificance happening 35 years later in 2001, particularly as Kubrick andClarke were both rumoured to be 'insiders' – if not high-ranking members of thecabal, then privy to certain hidden knowledge. In England, the movie had such aprofound effect on a young David Jones, (another Crowley-ite,) that he choseDavid Bowie as his artist identity for the rest of his career, after the '2001'lead character David Bowman, and his debut single, 'Space Oddity,' was a darkhomage to the film.And for anyone still salivating for more relevance to '66,' according to theAmerican researcher Freeman Fly, who specialises in showing how the occult andesoterica is weaved into popular culture, 66 is 'the number of the abyss.' InKabbalistic magic, it equates to The Qliphoth, said to represent negativeaspects of, or separation from divinity. America's fabled Route 66 highway issaid to have been the continent's first military route from East to West for thepurposes of transporting gold.A TALE OF TWO LOVERSMcCartney is said to have lived at girlfriend Jane Asher's home for a while. Hestarted seeing her in 1963 and they announced their engagement on Christmas Day,1967, by which point he was also going out with Linda who was shortly to becomehis first wife. The Beatlesbible.com [http://Beatlesbible.com] website states:\"The engagement didn't last, however. It was called off when she returned fromworking in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman. They attemptedto continue the relationship, but on 20th July, Asher announced to the BBC thatthe relationship was over.\"McCartney had continued to sleep with other women throughout theirrelationship, considering it permissible as they weren't married. In addition tohis infidelities, Asher had found McCartney had changed since his experienceswith LSD, and her commitment to her career meant they were often heading indifferent directions.\"Since their split Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss herrelationship with McCartney.\"If the replacement story is indeed true, this would mean Asher dated both theoriginal and the 'new' Paul. Nick Kollerstrom's terroronthetube.co.ukwebsite surmises:\"Jane had to be seen going out with the new ‘Paul.’ But once Faul married LindaEastman, she was out of the picture and might have needed a warning never totalk about what she knew. Her father’s death would have achieved that, and tothis day, she will never talk about this matter.\"Jane's father, Richard, was a leading neurologist who reportedly worked withScotland Yard studying the effects of LSD. McCartney is said to have writtenmany of his key songs at Asher's house, including 'Paperback Writer' and'Yesterday.' Richard Asher died in 1969, having apparently committed suicideafter suffering a bout of depression. His son Peter was one half of the duoPeter And Gordon, for whom McCartney penned hit songs including 'A World WithoutLove' and 'Nobody I Know.'The terroronthetube.co.uk [http://terroronthetube.co.uk] article goes on toaddress Paul's first wife, Linda, portraying her as something of an opportunistwho saw a chance to blackmail her way into being a famous pop star in her ownright.\"The US photographer Linda Eastman homed in on the new ‘Paul’ and they marriedvery quickly. The story is that she said to him she knew of his identity change,and had it on photographic record, but she would stay mum if he married her andmade her a star. Faul realised that this was exactly what he needed! Here was asexy female with whom he could talk about all the weird stuff he had beenthrough, and she’d keep his secrets and be part of his new band Wings and helpto build up his confidence. And her Jewish lawyer father could be exactly whathe needed in tricky times. He in fact acted for Faul as the Beatles broke up.\"Just like the Beatles' famous manager, Brian, Linda's real family name wasEpstein. Her father changed his name from Leopold Vail Epstein to Lee Eastman tosound less Russian/ Jewish and more American. She grew up in Scarsdale,Westchester County, New York.Linda died in 1998 after a battle with cancer. Of course, it's impossible foranyone outside of the small circle of people who were personally involved toknow the truth behind her death, but inevitably, it led to speculation that itmight have been some sort of engineered offing, given that it's relatively easyto induce cancers. It has been suggested that she was disposed of to prevent herknowledge of the truth about the McCartney switch from ever coming out.Readers might like to consider this possibility in tandem with the infamousinterview comments given by Heather Mills, Paul's second wife.THE HEATHER ENIGMAFor many PID proponents, Heather is the real smoking gun. Though they don'tprove the theory in itself, her words and behaviour sure take some explaining.Mills is a former high-class prostitute and soft porn model, and it's oftenpointed out that those attracted to these professions aren't necessarily themost trustworthy. Indeed, Mills would appear to be a habitual liar. There arediscrepancies over her account of her childhood sexual abuse, (which seems to bean ever-present spectre in stories related to the entertainment industry.) Asher Wikipedia entry puts it:\"Mills later wrote that she was kidnapped and sexually assaulted by a swimmingpool attendant when she was eight years old, but her next-door neighbour,Margaret Ambler, who was sexually abused by the swimming pool attendant, allegedthat Mills' story was 'nothing what she made it out to be.' that Mills was nevera victim, and that the pool attendant did not commit suicide, as Mills hadwritten.\"And later, with regard to her relationship with Alfie Karmal:\"After returning to London, Mills asked Karmal to marry her. Karmal said yes,but on one condition: \"I told her I couldn't marry her until she did somethingabout her compulsive lying, and she agreed to see a psychiatrist for eightweeks. She admitted she had a problem and said it was because she'd been forcedto lie as a child by her father.\"And:\"Mills has been accused by several newspapers of having embellished her lifestory. Journalist namesake Heather Mills, then at 'The Observer,' accused Millsof impersonating her for over a year in the late 1990s, showing people cuttingsof articles the journalist had written, which helped Mills secure a jobpresenting 'The General' TV show.\"Despite her track record in attention-seeking, however, in the key TV interviewsin question, Mills seems genuinely distressed, and declines to be specific aboutwhat she's referring to, presumably out of fear of the consequences.Her 2008 US TV interview with Billy Bush on the show 'Access Hollywood' is theone that has come in for the most scrutiny. This occurred in the midst of herbreak-up from McCartney prior to their divorce settlement. Evidently addressingMcCartney, she says to the camera:\"You know why I've left you. Protect me, and I will say nothing.\"Quizzed by Bush, she goes on to say:\"Something so awful happened. Someone I've loved for a long time I found out hadbetrayed me immensely. And I don't mean infidelity or anything like that. Like,beyond belief. I have to protect myself.\"People don't want to know what the truth is, because they could never, everhandle it. They'd be too devastated.\"Bush asks: \"Knowing what you know now about Paul, would you have married him inthe first place?\" Mills replies: \"Never.\"Given that she makes it clear she's not talking about infidelity, what otherkind of revelation about a beloved celebrity could be considered thisdevastating that the public could never, ever handle it if the truth emerged?In a separate interview for a morning television show for the UK's ITV channel,Mills added to the intrigue by saying to the camera:\"I have a box of evidence that's going to a certain person should anythinghappen to me. So if you top me off, it's still going to go to that certainperson and the truth will come out. There is so much fear from a certain partyof the truth coming out that lots of things have been put out and done, so thepolice came round and said, 'you have had serious death threats from anunderground movement.'\"Mills added to the intrigue in an interview for the BBC where she was asked ifshe feared for her life. She replied: \"Yes I do, yes I do.\" Asked if she meantthat \"Paul McCartney does not protect you and your child?\", she replied: \"I'mafraid not.\" (McCartney and Mills had a daughter together, Beatrice, born in2003.)Mills was subsequently demonised by the mainstream media, particularly in theUK, where she was generally portrayed as unstable, neurotic and hysterical. Thecorporate media is skilled in tactics to influence mass public opinion onparticular individuals, and given his massive clout as, by this time, a Knightin the British Establishment, it's not unreasonable to assume that 'McCartney' –or those he associates with – could have held considerable sway over editorialdecisions made by the BBC, ITV and the like.BOXES OF TRICKSHeather's reference to her 'box of evidence' brings to mind another story fromthe Beatles camp. Alongside Neil Aspinall, Mal Evans was a long-time assistantand roadie for the group, and was travelling with McCartney in Kenya in late1966. Some researchers who opt for the 11th September 1966 date of death havespeculated that Faul's visit in November was for the purpose of undergoingplastic surgery, away from the public glare of the UK, and in a country thenstill under British colonial control. According to some accounts, girlfriendJane Asher also went along on the 'holiday' between 6th and 19th November, viaFrance and Spain. Evans would appear to have been a particularly trustedconfidante of the Beatles, and if full knowledge of Paul's replacement were tohave been to only a select few, he would presumably have been among them. He isreported to have been the only Beatles-related person present at the marriage ofPaul and Linda in 1969. Beatles lore has it that the 'Sgt. Pepper' album ideawas hatched between McCartney and Evans during the Kenya trip. Mal Evans'Wikipedia entry describes events as follows:\"They spent their final night in Nairobi at a YMCA, before they returned toLondon. The Beatles, according to McCartney, needed a new name, so on the flightback to England, Evans and McCartney played with words to see if they could comeup with something new. Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters 'S' and'P' stood for on the pots on their meal trays, and McCartney explained that itwas for salt and pepper, which led to the 'Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts ClubBand' name.\"Evans was all set to publish his memoirs from the Beatles years in a book to beentitled 'Living the Beatles' Legend.' He was due to deliver this to hispublishers, Grosset & Dunlap, on 12th January 1976. A week earlier, on 5thJanuary, he'd reportedly told John Hoernie, the book's co-writer, to ensure itgot published at all cost in the event of anything happening to him. Withinhours, an apparently doped up and erratic Evans had been shot dead by the LAPDin an altercation, and the suitcase containing the manuscript reportedly'disappeared.' Only one page is said to have remained, page 146. According to anessay by British writer Nick Kollerstrom, this page detailed Evans' uneasinesswith being charged by Beatles manager Brian Epstein to sack Paul's loyal butlerGeorge Kelly, and get him removed from his London home before 'Paul' returnedfrom his Kenya visit. It also chronicled a meeting of the Beatles' inner circlewhere Paul outlined his plans for 'Sgt. Pepper.' Evans then teasingly writes,(assuming the page is genuine,) 'it was like we had known him forever.'Epstein himself famously 'committed suicide' in 1967, and some have inevitablyquestioned whether this was a hit by the 'intelligence' services to eliminateany chance of him ever revealing what he had been a part of.MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERSA comment on the Beatlesbible.com [http://Beatlesbible.com] website under thearticle 'The Paul Is Dead Myth,' from a user by the name of 'Seeker,' sums up anembracing of the PID theory well:\"People do not understand just how crucial the Beatles were to the economy ofBritain at the time. If you understand that then you can start to see how, ifPaul died, the truth would not necessarily have come out.\"The Beatles were also far more ‘managed’ than people thought and think. Theywere a real group who honed their skills during countless nights in Hamburg, butthere seems little doubt that George Martin had a lot to do with their songwriting.\"I am not sure the Theo Adorno theory is credible, but I have always wonderedhow Michael Jackson got to buy the Beatles back catalogue when McCartney had farmore money than him and far more clout in the industry by virtue of his status.And the fact he wrote those songs either by himself or with Lennon, and withmore than a little help from George Martin to begin with.\"I was a sceptic until I started reading various articles and watching variousclips on Youtube. I am old enough to remember the Beatles in the few yearsbefore their break-up, and I remember even then thinking how Paul had changed inthe space of a few short years. We’re not talking about the changes that usuallyhappen in people's physical features when they are in their late thirties andafter. His face changed in the space of a couple of years when he was in histwenties.\" . . . Now that writers have the background information about Tavistock, (theactual facts and not some bright ideas,) and how it was definitely about socialengineering, now that we know Jane Asher’s father kept company with doctors whoabused hypnotherapy to perform deep sleep hypnotherapy on unsuspecting victimsand killed himself, now that we know of the Beatles’ links with those closelyconnected with Manson etc., we know there is more than meets the eye to all ofthis.\"Truthteller though John Lennon was, he did lie, and all his dismissal of songlyrics as just playing with words or with fans does not ring with the truth.Clearly there are references that are not there to mock the fans or the world.\"TRUTH, LIES AND AUDIO TAPEIn 2010, a hoax 'mockumentary' entitled 'Paul McCartney Really is Dead: The LastTestament of George Harrison' appeared. The tongue-in-cheek story claims that,in the Summer of 2005, a package arrived at the Hollywood offices ofLondon-based Highway 61 Entertainment, containing two audio mini-cassettes.These were said to be labelled 'The Last Testament of George Harrison,' andpurported to contain Harrison's voice, spilling the beans about the car crashwhich killed McCartney, and the M15 conspiracy to replace him with a double.There were slight problems with verification given that Harrison himself hadinconveniently died in 2001.The hoax was in pretty poor taste. The tapes are dated 30th December 1999, thedate of Harrison's attack in which he was savagely stabbed by an intruder at hisOxfordshire home. Recording his memoirs whilst in a critical condition inhospital is not likely to have been at the forefront of his mind. And in thesection where 'Harrison' describes the remaining Beatles being taken by an MI5agent to view the body of McCartney, the head was said to have been mangled withtwo teeth protruding outwards, causing the agent to observe, 'he kinda lookslike a walrus, doesn't he?' and John to respond, 'No! I'm the walrus! I'm thewalrus!\" The girl known as 'Rita' who, in one version of the story caused thecar crash, is said to have been targeted by MI5 years later and lost a leg in ahit and run. You guessed it . . . she cropped up later under the new identity ofHeather Mills, and tried to blackmail Faul. Given that this story has Millsalready as an adult in 1966, she would have been at least 60 years old when shemade her famous TV interviews in 2007, (and clearly wasn't.) Furthermore, theMI5 agent's name is given as 'Moxwell,' presumably as in 'mocks well,' which thedocumentary sure does. The narrative is full of glaring inaccuracies, and thelaughingly unconvincing attempt at a Liverpool accent fails to hit the funnyspot – all dropped h's, and sounding more like a Brummie than a Scouser.Like the Ringo Starr spoof in 2015, the 'Testament' farce did damage to thecredibility of genuine researchers into the McCartney enigma, and, aside frombeing a self-indulgent piece of fun, it's worth bearing in mind that this mayhave been the intention of the creators all along – to taint any Beatles-relatedconspiracy with an air of implausibility, so that all will be dismissed as'ridiculous' in one fell swoop.KEEP IT IN THE FAMILYThere is another aspect of the story that requires some explanation before itcan be fully accepted. (Who ever claimed anything in the world of PID isclear-cut?) A small circle of individuals keeping quiet about a replacement isone thing. But there's then the question of the real James Paul McCartney'sfamily. If he did indeed die – whether taken out or the victim of a tragicaccident – there's no way an impostor could have fooled Paul's own parents andsibling, (brother Mike McGear, a member of the 60s group The Scaffold of 'LilyThe Pink' fame.) The fact that none of them have ever spoken publicly about anyfoul play means they would have to have been involved in the deception.Upon first suggestion then, the idea that they would have co-operated with thelie sounds preposterous. But, however unfeasible, possibilities do exist.Multi-million pound pay-offs have been known to buy silence, and threats,intimidation and mind control techniques have also been highly efficient inkeeping people in line, as have oaths of allegiance sworn to secret societies.It's certainly on record that Paul never attended the funeral of his father whenhe died in 1976. This was two days before the start of a Wings European tour,with Paul apparently choosing to play the gigs rather than pay his lastrespects.Many PID researchers have pointed to the behaviour and liaisons of themodern-day McCartney as further evidence of their claim. Even some Beatles fanswho reject the claims of a McCartney replacement are prepared to acknowledgethat something has happened to him, and that he's a very different character tothe cheeky cherub-faced chap of the early 1960s. McCartney's acceptance of aKnighthood from The Queen has led to a seemingly close friendship with theroyals. Could this have been a reward given knowingly for services rendered? Ifthe replacement really did take place, it would have involved complicity amongthe very upper levels of the British Establishment to ensure the story never gotout. McCartney can barely contain his glee at fraternising with the monarch inmany photos of them together. (Incidentally, it was revealed by the mainstreampress in 2013, after gaining access to documents through Freedom of Informationlaws, that George Harrison was offered an OBE in the Queen's New Year's Honoursof 2000, but had turned it down, apparently considering anything less than thefull Knighthood his bandmate McCartney had received to be an insult. Harrisonwas dead less than two years later.)Additionally, photographs show that he has become fond of flashing up the'Baphomet' hand sign that we'll examine in a forthcoming chapter, at many of hislive performances of recent years. As many have pointed out, there seems to be amoral corruption that accompanies recruitment to the upper levels ofentertainment's VIP Club, and McCartney's seemingly willing induction into it isvery much at odds with his innocent past. There's a certain poetic relevance toPaul/ Faul appearing on record with Kanye West on the track 'Only One' in 2015,and again with Kanye and Rihanna on 'Four Five Seconds.' One generation ofartificiality and manipulation meets another. Even if his appearance didhighlight the cultural ignorance of young people in America when many of themTweeted comments like, 'who's this new Paul McCartney cat?' That's what I likeabout Kanye, man; always willing to give a platform to new up-and-coming names!'It may well be that the McCartney replacement was only ever supposed to play therole for the few years until the Beatles' final break-up, then fade away into aprivate life of obscurity, but that he so got the taste for musical fame andfortune that his ego got the better of him, and motivated him to go on puttingout his own music for decades afterwards.'McCartney's' carefully cultivated family-friendly image took a battering in2003 when American illusionist David Blaine was in London to perform anendurance stunt, suspending himself in a glass box over the Thames for 44 days.McCartney decided to pay a late-night visit. According to the book 'Fab: AnIntimate Life of Paul McCartney' by Howard Sounes, Paul's publicist Geoff Bakerbeckoned a photographer, Kevin Wheal, to go and take his picture. Anenthusiastic Wheal reportedly ran towards McCartney, incurring some hostility.McCartney, who appeared drunk, is said to have pushed Wheal away and said,\"listen mate, I've come to see this stupid cunt. You're not going to take apicture of me tonight. Fuck off! I'm a pedestrian on a private visit.\" Alertedto his presence, a member of the public then came up and asked if they couldshake McCartney's hand, to which they received the reply \"fuck off.\" McCartneyis then said to have fired Baker and ordered his driver to take him home.Prior to 2015, Paul had already made some comments about the famousLennon-McCartney song writing tag, suggesting that it should be alternated sothat his own name appeared first 50 per cent of the time. In July 2015 he tookthings further and angered many John Lennon and Beatles fans in the process, inan interview given to the UK's 'Telegraph.' McCartney complained that Lennon'sassassination had made him a martyr. The article quotes him as saying:\"When John got shot, aside from the pure horror of it, the lingering thing was,'OK, well, now John's a martyr. A JFK.' I started to get frustrated becausepeople started to say, 'Well, he was the Beatles.' And me, George and Ringowould go, 'Er, hang on. It's only a year ago we were all equal-ish.'\"John was the witty one, sure. John did a lot of great work. And post-Beatles hedid more great work. But he also did a lot of not-great work. Now the fact thathe's martyred has elevated him to a James Dean, and beyond.\"So whilst I didn't mind that – I agreed with it – I understood that now therewas going to be revisionism. It was going to be: John was the one. I mean, ifyou just pull out all his great stuff and then stack it up against mynot-so-great stuff, it’s an easy case to make.\"Stories such as this leaking out at the same time as spoofs like the Ringo one,do make me wonder whether they're paving the way for some kind of disclosureregarding the whole Paul Is Dead subject area. Truth does sometimes take years,decades, even centuries to reveal itself. But it always gets there in the end.DENIAL RUNS DEEPIt's worth bearing in mind that, for most people alive in the world today, theirentire perception of who 'Paul McCartney' is and what he looks like, has beenformed since 1966. The number who have vivid recollections of witnessing thepre-'66 Paul are dwindling with every passing year. What if enough time hasamassed for an impostor to have been so thoroughly integrated into the public'sconsciousness, that he is now unquestioningly accepted? As terroronthetube.co.ukputs it:\"The world has greatly forgotten what the real Paul McCartney looked like; thatcute, round-faced cherubic look, the heart and soul of the original Beatles,adored by his fans around the world, so successful has been the ‘morphing’ ofthe new lad.\"The suggestion of the McCartney replacement does tend to be met with scorn andderision from those old enough to remember the Beatles and their impact on the1960s. This generation often maintains that the switch couldn't possibly havetaken place. In many ways this is understandable. There is a lot invested inpersonal nostalgia, and to have these memories challenged in a way that wouldforce you to re-evaluate the entire experience is too difficult for many toface. Acceptance of a hoax also involves admitting that you were duped, alongwith the rest of the population on whom the deception was foisted, and it seemsmany prefer not to acknowledge that they're capable of being fooled in such away. I recently asked an old boss of mine, who was a young musician himself inthe 1960s, what he thought of the idea that the music of that decade could havebeen a cynical exercise in social engineering. His response, 'I prefer the 60sas I remember them, thanks', will be a common stance among members of thatgeneration.The McCartney replacement – if it did take place – was very much a product ofits time, where a reliance on largely black-and-white printed photographs wasthe only chance any researcher really had of highlighting any discrepancies. Andanyone who thought they might be on to something only had newsletters, fanzinesand the occasional radio phone-in through which to communicate their suspicions.Such an audacious plan could never work in today's internet era, where vigilant'webheads' would be all over any anomalies between photos and video footage inseconds, and with a Youtube video and blog essay posted to the world by the endof the day.I can't prove that a McCartney replacement really did take place, and the numberof people who could is limited only to those who had a first-hand involvement inthe events of those times. The rest of us are left to speculate based on theevidence that is available to us, along with whatever logic and intuition weindividually bring to the table. Maybe the full revelations will emerge onlyafter the passing of Paul/ Faul, just as the truth about Jimmy Savile did. Maybelifetime oaths of allegiance really do work like that.Stranger things have happened.

Certainly, a glance at recordsales and chart positions achieved by the two groups, provides instantconfirmation that they were the two leading collectives in the early rock era.However much the Beatles' latter career was characterised by occultic activityand symbolism, however, the Rolling Stones were not to be outdone and, ifanything, walked all over their Northern rivals when it came to dark, Satanicovertones, and the ever-present shadow of death.While the Beatles – in their early days at least – were marketed as a kind ofwholesome, clean-cut group singing catchy, innocent songs that young fans couldlisten to with their grans, from the start, the Rolling Stones were portrayed asa much rougher, more dangerous outfit. Andrew Loog Oldham started out as theBeatles' early publicist, but defected to the Stones in 1963, and straight awayworked on hyping their loutish image. It's Loog Oldham who's credited withinventing the quote 'would you let your daughter marry a Rolling Stone?' andsimilar provocative headlines in the press of the time. Loog Oldham's father wasa British Air Force pilot who was shot down and killed before his son was evenborn in yet another of an endless glut of connections between the music industryand the military/ \"intelligence\" services. Loog Oldham was of Jewish parentage –another ever-present credential in the music industry's back-story. He alsoworked for a time as the publicist for reported paedophile and satanist recordproducer Joe Meek. A full house.Part of Loog Oldham's plan to shape the rebellious image of the Stones involvedpictures taken by his Jewish photographer friend Gered Mancowitz, the son of thescreenwriter Wolf Mancowitz. Following Loog Oldham's defection to the Stones,the Beatles became managed by the Jewish Brian Epstein. Meanwhile, when LoogOldham's tenure with the Stones came to an end in that magical year of 1966,management was turned over to a Jewish, (just a coincidence, nothing to worryabout) New York accountant named Allen Klein.SOMETHING IN THE AIRFrom the start, the vibe at the Rolling Stones live shows had a very distinctiveair, attracting unruly audiences, and their gigs became known as hotbeds ofbrewing angst and discontent. One such example was a gig at The Empress Ballroomin Blackpool in 1964. The violence that erupted when Keith Richards had analtercation with an aggressive member of the audience led to the group beingbanned by the town council for the next 45 years.These types of experiences were only the prelude to a far darker liveperformance, however, which has gone down in the annals of rock historyalongside The Who's ill-fated gig in Cincinatti and Pearl Jam's fatal appearanceat Denmark's Roskilde Festival for all the wrong reasons. This was the AltamontFree Festival held at a racetrack in California in December 1969, where a black,18-year-old Stones audience member named Meredith Hunter was stabbed and beatento death in front of the stage as the group performed.Fellow British DJ, writer and researcher Matt Sergiou, who runs the brilliantand endlessly fascinating Conspiro Media blog site, has published amindblowingly comprehensive overview of the Stones' darker side. Here, in anabridged version of the heavily-detailed article on the site, he takes up thestory of Altamont:\"(Meredith Hunter) had got locked into an altercation with members of the HellsAngels, the notorious motorcycle club which, it’s said, was hired to take careof security, although this has been denied by some who were closely involvedwith the gig. The reputed photographer Ethan Russell, who’s shot album coversfor the Beatles and The Who during his lengthy career, was with the Stones atAltamont. He wasn’t impressed with what he saw from the start. For him, thelocation of the venue 'was a dull, lifeless landscape. There was no hint ofgreen, not a tree, not a blade of grass. When we arrived there was no palpablefeeling of joy or even happiness. It slowly dawned on me that this concert mightnot turn out to be what I expected . . . '\" . . . Fellow Altamont performer Grace Slick, who was a singer with theJefferson Airplane at the time, is also said to have picked up on the 'strange'vibrations that day, recalling that 'the vibes were bad. Something was verypeculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. I had expected the lovingvibes of Woodstock but that wasn’t coming at me. This was a whole differentthing.' The magazine 'Rolling Stone', in a special Altamont issue publishedshortly after the event, reported that 'a chick toward the front of the stage”on the opening day of the festival 'was telling her old man: ‘It’s weird. Theyconsulted the astrologers before setting the dates for Woodstock, but theycouldn’t have consulted an astrologer about today. Anyone can see that with themoon in Scorpio, today’s an awful day to do this concert. There’s a strongpossibility of violence and chaos and any astrologer could have told themso . . . '\"The Stones took to the stage the following morning at around 4am. Mick Tayloris quoted as describing the scene before him as 'completely barbaric, like therewas so much violence there it completely took the enjoyment out of it for me . .. it was impossible . . . to enjoy the music, or anything, because most of theviolence was going on right in front of the stage, right in front of our eyes,and like I’ve never seen anything like it before. I just couldn’t believe it.The Hells Angels had a lot to do with it . . . '\"The Stones’ performance at Altamont, and the horrors which unfolded before themas they played, are featured in the documentary, ’Gimme Shelter,’ which picks upon their set some two songs in when they launch into ‘Sympathy for the Devil,’but not before Jagger addresses the crowd in a soft, almost effeminate manner,asking them to 'just be cool down the front there and don’t push around. Justkeep still, keep together . . . '\"A few seconds later, the opening beats of the number ‘Under My Thumb’ begin.Jagger calmly asks the crowd to 'sit down just keep cool and let’s just relax,let’s just get into a groove, come on, we can get it together. Sit down.' As thesong ends though, we see a wide, empty space forming in the audience again.There’s trouble, and there’s Meredith Hunter at the edge of the rapidly recedingcrowd, recognisable by his bright green jacket and trousers. A Hells Angel comeslunging at him, making stabbing-like motions into the 18-year-old before pushinghim out of shot into the darkness.\"Bill Wyman was recently quoted as saying, “'Mick Taylor and I were the onesnearest to it. We saw the crowd open up and the guy chase the other guy right infront of us. We both saw the commotion when the guy got stabbed. We saw thewhole thing, and my heart skipped a beat.' In the documentary, we see peopletending to a stretcher. There’s a bloodstained sleeve hanging out fromunderneath a blanket that‘s been strapped into it, and it’s the same shade ofgreen as worn by Meredith Hunter. We can’t see him. The face has been covered.We can also hear a voice say, 'we pronounced him dead at six o’clock.'Albert Maysles, director of the documentary 'Gimme Shelter', has confirmed thatone of the camera operators at Altamont just happened to be a young aspiringdirector named George Lucas. Purely as a matter of curiosity, the name Lucas issaid to mean 'bright', 'shining' or 'luminous', and is connected to the nameLucifer, meaning 'the light bearer.' Mick Jagger gave the name Lucas to histhird son, born in 1999.It was a devastating event for the Stones' mainstream public image, though itonly served to reinforce their credentials within rock music's darker circles.THE DEVIL GOES MAINSTREAM'Sympathy For The Devil' itself is arguably the Stones' most notorious track. Itremains on frequent radio rotation around the world, bringing demonicconnotations into the general public's consciousness. Wikipedia claims it to be:\"An homage to Satan, written in the first-person narrative from the point ofview of Lucifer, who recounts the atrocities committed throughout the history ofhumanity in his name.\"This reinforces the idea, central to modern Christian teaching, that 'Lucifer'and 'Satan' are both names for a singular entity known as 'The Devil' who standsas the antithesis to the God of creation. This is an over-simplification of theoccult teachings of ancient civilisations. Within the circles of esoterica andblack magic(k), 'Satan' is represented by the Planet Saturn, in recognition ofthe dark influence it is said to have had over human affairs for aeons. It's nocoincidence that the spellings are so similar. 'Lucifer,' meanwhile, is asymbolic rendering of Venus, commonly known as The Morning Star.Either way, 'Sympathy' has Mick Jagger assuming the person of 'The Devil,' andgloating over the death, misery and human suffering he has brought through theages, citing Jesus' trial at the hands of Pilate, the bloody Russian Revolution,and the murder of the Kennedys among his achievements. (Reportedly, SenatorRobert Kennedy was assassinated during the time that Jagger was writing thesong, so the lyric 'I shouted out, who killed Kennedy' was swiftly pluralised to'the Kennedys.') The song, originally titled 'The Devil Is My Name,' appeared onthe album 'Beggars Banquet,' and is credited to Jagger/ Richards, althoughJagger is acknowledged as having penned the lyrics single-handedly. Ininterviews, he has said that he was inspired by a book given to him by hisgirlfriend Marianne Faithfull, (in turn recommended to her by film-maker KennethAnger,) 'The Master And Margarita' by Russian author Mikhail Bulgakov, whichconcerns The Devil paying a visit to the Soviet Union. 'Sympathy' inspired thetitle of a 'producer's edit' of a 1968 film by Jean-Luc Godard. The film wasoriginally titled 'One Plus One' and is a depiction of the late 60s UScounter-culture scene. Its footage features the Stones in the process ofrecording 'Sympathy' in the studio.It was inevitable that the song would gain the group a reputation amongChristian groups as 'devil worshippers,' given that John Lennon's earliercomment that 'we're more popular than Jesus now' had caused such a stir. TheStones acted shocked at the reactions – at least for the purposes of interviews.Jagger stated: \"When people started taking us as devil worshippers, I thought itwas a really odd thing, because it was only one song, after all. It wasn't likeit was a whole album, with lots of occult signs on the back. People seemed toembrace the image so readily, and it has carried all the way over into heavymetal bands today.\"Keith Richards observed:\"Before, we were just innocent kids out for a good time. They're saying,'they're evil, they're evil.' Oh, I'm evil, really? So that makes you startthinking about evil . . . What is evil? Half of it, I don't know how much peoplethink of Mick as The Devil or as just a good rock performer or what? There areblack magicians who think we are acting as unknown agents of Lucifer and otherswho think we are Lucifer.\"These comments seem naive or carefully contrived when put into the context ofthe rest of the Stones' career, because 'Sympathy' is far from alone inrepresenting the group's dabblings into diabolical realms. An earliereyebrow-raiser had been the album 'Their Satanic Majesties Request,' released inDecember 1967. According to the Stones' official website, the title was a playon the wording found in a British passport of the time: ‘Her Britannic Majesty’sSecretary of State requests and requires . . .’ The Stones version will no doubtprovide particular intrigue to anyone who has researched the true nature of theBritish monarch and her family, and some aspects of their background thatsomehow never seem to get covered by the BBC's 'Royal correspondent' Jennie Bondand her like! In countries such as South Africa and The Philippines the albumhad to be retitled 'The Stones Are Rolling', due to controversy over the word'Satanic'.The album was notable for the distinct similarities between the sleeve designand that of the Beatles' Peter Blake-designed 'Sgt. Pepper' album which hadappeared six months earlier. It utilises lenticular printing, giving the imagethe feel of 3D depth. According to legend, the original cover was to feature animage of a naked Jagger being crucified, before it was rejected for being in'bad taste.' (That's a surprise, eh?) The image that got used, designed byacclaimed rock photographer Michael Cooper, depicts the band members in variousgarb, much of it similar to that on 'Sgt. Pepper.' Jagger stands out in thecentre, dressed as a black magician, complete with pointed wizard's hat adornedwith a crescent moon. A blood-red Planet Saturn (Satan) hovers ominouslyoverhead, along with a quarter of a 'supermoon' in the top-right corner. On theback cover is a painting by Tony Meevilwiffen depicting the four elements ofEarth, Water, Fire and Air.'Their Satanic Majesties' stands as the Stones' sole outing into theexperimental and psychedelic style of the times, the rest of their pantheonremaining grounded in Rock and Rhythm & Blues territory. The group themselveswere less than happy with the outcome, with Jagger commenting: \"There's a lot ofrubbish on 'Satanic Majesties.' Just too much time on our hands, too many drugs,no producer to tell us, 'Enough already, thank you very much, now can we justget on with this song?\" Beatles John Lennon and Paul McCartney reportedlycontributed uncredited backing vocals on the songs 'Sing This All Together' and'We Love You,' which is an interesting state of affairs considering theirrespective groups were marketed as 'rivals'.KEEPING UP WITH THE JONES'SWhen it comes to black magic(k) and other dark occult activity, it's foundingStones member Brian Jones, (who always bore more than a passing resemblance toBritish sex-comedy actor Robin Askwith,) whose name crops up time after time.Even the name of his first pre-Stones band, Thunder Odin’s Big Secret, with itsnod to the Norse god from whose name the word Wednesday is derived, hasother-worldly overtones.Matt Sergiou again takes up the story:\"German singer Nico met the band in 1965. Of Brian Jones, she reportedly told awriter, 'do you know Brian was a witch?' We were interested in these things andhe was very deep about it.' According to the book ‘Nico, the Life and Lies of anIcon’ by Richard Witts, 'she said on another occasion that Jones was keen on theoccult but he was like a little boy with a magic set. It was really an excusefor him to be nasty and sexy. He read books by an old English man, (AleisterCrowley) who was The Devil.'\"Rock author Mick Wall states that well-renowned Aleister Crowley devotee JimmyPage was a regular visitor to Brian’s and Anita’s London flat when he was amember of The Yardbirds, and that the Rolling Stone 'was into paganism, Zen,Moroccan tapestries . . . and drugs.' Anita (Pallenburg) was an aspiringfilm-star and model, into magick, sex, hanging out with rock stars . . . anddrugs. A small-time crook as a teenager, not only was Brian a gifted andsuccessful musician, he was up for anything. He and Anita would hold séances atthe flat using a ouija board; or they would pile in the car and drive off tolook for UFOs in the dead of night.”Elsewhere, the Conspiro Media article makes mention of Brian's alleged 'Witch'sTit':\"Kenneth Anger is widely quoted as saying, 'the occult unit within the Stoneswas Keith, Anita and Brian. I believe that Anita is, for want of a better word,a witch . . . ' Indeed, Pallenburg has reportedly declared, 'yes, I did have aninterest in witchcraft, in Buddhism, in the black magicians that my friendKenneth Anger, the film-maker, introduced me to. The world of the occultfascinated me . . . ' Of Jones, it’s claimed that Anger said, 'you see, Brianwas a witch too. I’m convinced. He showed me his Witch’s Tit. He had asupernumerary tit in a very sexy place on his inner thigh. He stated, ‘inanother time they would have burned me.’ He was very happy about that.' Ofcourse, Jones wasn’t wrong to assume that his purported third nipple might’veled to persecution in a long bygone age. At the height of the witch-hunts inEurope in the 17th century, it was said supernatural entities which appeared inanimal form fed off these marks on the body. Known as ‘familiars,’ these spiritswere supposedly assigned by The Devil to act as the servants of witches; to aidthem in their magick and protect them from attack.\"Jones' background throws up yet another link to the government and military'intelligence' services, (Michael Franti observed wonderfully on the track'Television: The Drug of the Nation' that 'military intelligence' is actually anoxymoron.) The fact that so many prominent musicians have family connections tothese establishments, almost invariably through their fathers, surely goesbeyond the realms of 'coincidence.' If the fathers of countless rock stars justhappened to share jobs as, say, carpenters, traffic wardens or bakers, thiswould surely be considered strange. In his book 'Your Thoughts Are Not Your Own,Volume 2', British writer Neil Sanders lists just some of the famousmusic-makers whose parents have come from military, secret service, orgovernment department backgrounds. These include: Kris Kristofferson, JohnDenver, the band America, Ciara, Lionel Richie, Christina Aguilera, MichaelStipe, Emmylou Harris, Ann and Nancy Wilson of Heart, Marilyn Manson, TreySongz, Pete Doherty, Englebert Humperdink, Elton John and Bob Marley. There willbe many others, not least the huge array of US and Canadian artists detailed inthe next chapter on Laurel Canyon. Meanwhile, the list of artists who themselveshave served in the military is just as extensive, including, but by no meanslimited to: Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, John Coltrane, John Fogerty, BillyCobham, Lou Rawls, Jerry Reed, Woody Guthrie, BB King, Henry Mancini, CharlieRich, Tony Bennett, Grover Washington Jr., Jim Croce, Bill Wyman, Artimus Pyleof Lynyrd Skynyrd, Rick James, Shaggy, Ice T, Turbo B of Snap, MC Tee ofMantronix, James Blunt, Rihanna, Canibus, Fred Durst and Maynard Keenan. Anotable one is Stewart Copeland, the drummer with The Police. His father wasMiles Copeland, a high-ranking London-based CIA officer from the time of itsmutation from The Office of Strategic Services, and in his retirement, creatorof the 'Game Of Nations' board game. 'The Police' becomes an interesting choiceof band name within this context, as do lyrics like 'every step you take, I'llbe watching you!'In Brian Jones' case, he was born Lewis Brian Hopkins Jones in Cheltenham in1942 to a well-off musical family. They originated from Wales, but had moved toCheltenham to further his father's career as an aeronautical engineer.Cheltenham, as well as being a favoured retirement town for military top brassand government officials, has a rich history as a seat of British government'intelligence' services. In 1951, it became home to the newly-founded GeneralCommunications Headquarters (GCHQ,) a prominent government spying post, and theequivalent to America's NSA, whose nefarious activities were recently exposed bythe 'whistleblower' Edward Snowden.According to an excellent on-line article titled 'Rolling Through TheIntelligence Community' on the anolen.com [http://anolen.com] website, the youngBrian Jones gained a notorious reputation around Cheltenham for impregnatingyoung girls, then absolving himself of any responsibility towards mother orchild. He reportedly fathered six illegitimate children in this manner, becomingsomething of an embarrassment to his father, and to the defence industry forwhich he worked. At the same time, Jones was showing considerable talent as ablues musician. Before long, he'd been recruited to play in a collective knownas Blues Incorporated in London, headed by the charismatic Alexis Korner, thendubbed 'the father of British blues.' Korner's father was Austrian-Jewish, whilehis mother was Turkish-Greek. They had moved to London in 1940. It was here thatJones was introduced to a young Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Korner had forsome reason recruited the pair, despite them having no previous musicalexperience. Charlie Watts and Ian Stewart, later to become the Stones' drummerand guitarist, were also a part of the Blues Incorporated collective. Korner iscredited with having spring-boarded the careers of many other prominentmusic-makers, including Rod Stewart, John Mayall and Jimmy Page, and pretty muchfounding the groups Led Zeppelin and Cream. Korner went on to enjoy a successfultelevision career with the newly-launched ITV, (headed by the Jewish Gradebrothers,) and later joining BBC Radio One as a presenter.Elsewhere in the fascinating anolen.com [http://anolen.com] article, which youcan find here : http://anolen.com/tag/up-and-down-with-the-rolling-stones/[http://anolen.com/tag/up-and-down-with-the-rolling-stones/%E2%80%8A] the writerspeculates on there being an organised link between the British music scene ofthe mid – to late-1960s, and that which emerged out of LA's Laurel Canyondistrict in the same timeframe, all connected by the British and US government,military and \"intelligence\" services.The suggestion of many researchers is that, like the Beatles, the Rolling Stoneswere a creation of some arm of the British government/ 'intelligence' services –possibly The Tavistock Institute – and that, like their Northern counterparts,they also constituted a massive exercise in shaping the social attitudes of ageneration. Mind-altering drugs were never far from the picture. Neither werethe suspicions of 'plants' and 'handlers' within their inner circle. Brian Joneswas the original in-band boyfriend of Anita Pallenberg, before she later becameattached to Keith Richards. Little is known about exactly how she came to beintegrated into the Stones' fraternity, leading some to speculate that she couldhave been some kind of 'insider.' It was Pallenberg who is said to haveintroduced Jones to LSD, to which he quickly became addicted, and which led to arapid downward spiral all the way to his untimely death. The sexual antics inthe Stones camp have led to much theorising that the group was run as a kind ofmind-controlled cult. Members of such groups are typically cut off from familymembers and their former friends, and encouraged to fraternise only with fellowmembers. This is certainly a phenomenon seen throughout the music industry. Oncethey cross a certain threshold, many artists have spoken of only having'industry friends,' and of having all ties with their previous life severed.The other Stones girlfriend, Marianne Faithfull, also comes from a militaryfamily background. Her father was reportedly a British spy in wartime Berlin,while her half-Jewish mother was a cabaret dancer in Germany. Does anyone elsesee any patterns forming here?THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH OF BRIAN JONESBy the time of his sudden death at the age of 27, (remember that number!),Jones' career with the Stones was all but finished. As the rest of the bandplanned an ambitious tour of the US in the Spring of 1969, Jones had effectivelybeen kicked out of the group he had formed. He was said to have been badlyaffected by years of drink and heavy drug abuse, had become unpredictable,aggressive, unfit and bloated, and had holed himself up as something of arecluse at his 16th century farmhouse, Cotchford Farm, in East Sussex. (Thisjust happened to be the former home of Winnie The Pooh creator and allegedpaedophile AA Milne.)Ever the party guy, however, Jones never lost his enthusiasm to entertain, andhosted small parties for friends during a period where his house was undergoingrenovation. At around midnight on the night of 2nd/ 3rd July 1969, at the tailend of one such gathering, Jones' lifeless body was discovered in the outdoorswimming pool of his house.The official verdict was 'death by misadventure,' the implication being that aheavily drunk and drugged-up Jones had accidentally drowned after deciding totake a lone, late-night swim. The coroner's report made a point of noting thathis liver and heart were unnaturally enlarged due to drug and alcohol abuse.The suspicion that Jones was actually murdered has persisted in rock music loreever since, and the candidate frequently cited as his killer is a man by thename of Frank Thorogood. A builder, he was part of the construction team workingon Jones' property shortly before his demise, also seemingly acting as Jones'unofficial minder and supplier of drugs. It's said that, years later, Thorogoodconfessed to the killing to Rolling Stones driver Tom Keylock. This story becamethe subject of the 2005 movie 'Stoned,' with Leo Gregory playing the part ofJones, and Paddy Considine portraying Thorogood.By 2009, an investigative journalist named Scott Jones claimed to have tracedmany of the people who had been at Jones' house the night he died, and as aresult, Sussex Police agreed to open the first review into the death since 1969.Soon afterwards, however, they announced they would not be re-opening the case,stating: \"this has been thoroughly reviewed by Sussex Police's Crime Policy andReview Branch, but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroner'soriginal verdict of 'death by misadventure' was incorrect.\" In an articlepublished in 'The Mail On Sunday' in 2008, Scott Jones alleged that FrankThorogood had killed Jones following a fight, and the police at the time hadcovered up the cause of death. Jones had allegedly sacked Thorogood from thebuilding project earlier in the day, having been dissatisfied with his work.One of the small group gathered at Jones' house was Janet Lawson, girlfriend ofStones assistant Tom Keylock. In his 2008 article, Scott Jones relates whatLawson had told him about that fateful night, shortly before she died fromcancer:\"Frank was not doing the building work properly. Jan told me: 'Brian had sackedhim that day. There was something in the air. Frank was acting strangely,throwing his weight around a bit. In the early evening Frank, Anna, Brian andmyself had dinner – steak and kidney pie.'\"After eating, the group returned to the garden where Jones and Thorogood larkedabout in the pool. Later, when Jones was in the pool by himself, he asked Janetto find his asthma inhaler. 'I went to look for it by the pool, in the musicroom, the reception room and then the kitchen. Frank came in in a lather. Hishands were shaking. He was in a terrible state. I thought the worst almoststraight away and went to the pool to check.\"When I saw Brian on the bottom of the pool and was calling for help, Frankinitially did nothing. I shouted for Frank again as I ran towards the house, andhe burst out before I reached it, ran to the pool and instantly dived in. But Ihad not said where Brian was. I thought, 'how did he know Brian was at thebottom of the pool?'\"I ran back to the house and tried to call 999 but Anna was on the phone andwould not get off it.\"But in her original statement, Janet did not mention the tension between Jonesand Thorogood, or the fact that she feared the worst as soon as she sawThorogood coming in from the pool. Nor did she reveal how Thorogood initiallyignored her cries for help or that he dived into the pool without her tellinghim that was where Jones was. Did she think Thorogood had killed Jones?'Yes. I went into the house to look for Brian's inhaler. Frank jumped back inthe pool, did something to Brian and by the time I came back, Brian was lyingpeacefully on the bottom of the pool with not a ripple in the water.'\" . . . Jan believed that Thorogood had not intended to kill Jones but theguitarist's death was probably the result of horseplay that had got out ofhand.\"According to another researcher, Trevor Hobley, one of Jones' neighbours hadseen a large bonfire burning on Jones' property a few hours after his body hadbeen found, in which Jones' clothes and some documents were being burned. AnAmerican author and former editor of 'Rolling Stone' magazine, meanwhile, RobertGreenfield, has claimed that Tom Keylock, Janet Lawson's boyfriend, was assignedto cover up Jones' death at the hands of Thorogood. His claim came as the resultof conversations with Keith Richards, with whom he lived in the South of Francein 1971. Richards was apparently convinced that Thorogood had been Jones'killer.Thorogood himself died in 1993. The story, however, did not die with him. In2013, Thorogood's daughter, Jan Bell, spoke to the UK's 'Daily Mail' to claimthat her father had told her of a vicious row between Jones and other members ofthe Stones on the day of his death. She had related this story as part of herreport to Sussex Police, she said, but the police had decided to take no actionon it. Thorogood's claim was that Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had visited thefarmhouse to ask Jones to agree to a financial settlement for giving over thename of the Rolling Stones. A row reportedly broke out when Jones refused.According to Thorogood, Richards then drew a knife on Jones in anger. Thorogoodis said to have calmed everyone down, after which Jagger and Richards left theproperty.Just before things start to become too clear-cut and transparent, however –because that would never do in the world of rock music deaths, would it? – adifferent slant is put on the Jones affair by respected US music author AlexConstantine in his book 'The Covert War Against Rock.' Constantine claims that,by the time of his death, Jones had been on a rehabilitative path and had beenclean of drink and drugs for some weeks, making a nonsense of the coroner'sreport findings. The book's chapter on Jones places a different emphasis on theconstruction crew at the house of which Thorogood had been a part:\"A hostile clique, a very odd construction crew hired to restore Brian's home,originally AA Milne's cottage, muscled their way into his private life atCotchford Farm. Brian's friend Nicholas Fitzgerald ran into the rhythm guitaristand founder of the Stones at a pub before he was found at the bottom of hisswimming pool. Jones was in a snit over 'a bunch hanging out at the farm.' For alark, they'd hidden his motorcycle. When on the phone, the line would sometimessuddenly go dead. 'Then when I get the engineers in, they say there's nothingwrong. They're always leaping up to answer the phone and then they tell me itwas a wrong number. I just can't trust anybody. I know you think I'm paranoid.Maybe I am, but not about this. I know they're up to something.'\"Bassist Bill Wyman found the crew 'a horrible group of people,' and it waslargely due to their intimidations that Jones decayed \"physically, mentally andmusically.\"Fitzgerald offers a further account of having arrived at Jones' house on thenight of the death:\"Nick Fitzgerald now acknowledges that he arrived at the Jones estate shortlyafter the drowning, walked past the Summer house behind the mansion and 'saw thefull glare of the lights over the pool and in the windows of the house. We had aclear view of the pool.' Fitzgerald approached to find three men dressed insweaters and blue jeans, probably workmen, but the spotlights 'blotted out theirfeatures and made their faces look like white blobs. At the very moment I becameaware of them, the middle one dropped to his knees, reached into the water andpushed down on the top of a head that looked white.' Two others, a man and awoman, watched passively. 'The kneeling man was pushing down on the head,'Fitzgerald told Hotchner, 'keeping it under. The man to the right of thekneeling man said something. It sounded like a command.' One of the men leapedinto the pool and 'landed on the back of the struggling swimmer.' A third manwas 'commanded' into the pool to hold Jones down.\"From the bushes near Fitzgerald, a 'burly man wearing glasses' rushed him. Theman pushed Richard Cadbury, a companion, out of the way and grabbed Fitzgeraldby the shoulder. He stuck a fist in Fitzgerald's face. 'Get the hell out ofhere, Fitzgerald,' the man spat, 'or you'll be next.'\"He meant it,' Fitzgerald reported decades after the fact. He had never seen theCockney before, yet somehow the brute knew his name. Shaking, he stumbled to hiscar and Richard floored it away from the murder scene. They were too terrifiedto go to the police. 'Brian was dead. I couldn't rectify that and I might beputting my own life in danger. So I let it pass. But that scene hasn't passedfrom my mind, and even to this day it troubles me very much.\"Apparently, Jones had never held out hope of making it much beyond the age atwhich he died. Keith Richards has reportedly said: “There are some people whoyou know aren’t going to get old. Brian and I agreed that he, Brian, wouldn’tlive very long . . . I remember saying, ‘you’ll never make 30, man,’ and hesaid, ‘I know.’Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman were the only Stones members who attended Jones'funeral, at a cemetery back in Cheltenham. Two days afterwards, the group playedtheir historic open-air gig in London's Hyde Park, where new guitarist MickTaylor was unveiled. The show was said to be dedicated to Jones' memory, withJagger reading excerpts of the Percy Shelley poem 'Adonais.'ENTER THE ACID MANA saga which further cemented the Stones' reputation as the bad boys of 60s rockwas the notorious drugs busts of 1967, first at Keith Richards' Sussex houseRedlands in February of that year, then at Brian Jones' London flat on the veryday that Jagger and Richards were standing trial for the earlier offence on 10thMay. A photograph of a handcuffed Jagger and art dealer Robert Fraser hidingtheir faces as they're driven away in a police van the following month hasbecome one of the most iconic of the era. A more telling one that will be ofinterest to numerologists emerged from Brian Jones' court case, when he wasphotographed driving away in a car with the personalised registration plate DD666.Some examination of the finer details, however, offers the suggestion that theFebruary bust was a long-planned event manipulated into place by certain partiesoutside of the Stones' close circle, and with the ever-present element ofBritish and American security service collusion. A key piece of evidence is theconvenient emergence – and prompt disappearance – of a highly ambiguous figureby the name of David Schneiderman, (among various other pseudonyms.)Conspiro Media takes up the story:\"In his memoirs, Keith makes note of the police raid on Brian’s London residencewhich occurred 'almost on the hour' that he and Mick were standing beforemagistrates. The 'stitch-up,' as he describes it, 'was orchestrated andsynchronised with rare precision. But due to some small glitch of stagemanagement, the Press actually arrived, television crews included, a few minutesbefore the police knocked on Brian’s door with their warrant.\"The suggestion, reinforced by Tony Sanchez in his book 'Up And Down With theRolling Stones,' is that certain parties within the British Establishment haddecided that the Rolling Stones' influence on the youthful generation had insome way gone 'off-script,' and that the group needed to be reminded of who wasultimately calling the shots. Enter David Schneiderman.\"One of the most intriguing aspects of the raid is the cloud of suspicion thathangs over the enigmatic David Schneiderman, who Keith and Marianne believe wassent to discredit The Stones. Of particular interest is his attaché case whichwas supposedly full of drugs and which police allegedly failed to search, eventhough it sat on a table in full view of them at Redlands that night.\"Marianne also questions the timing of Schneiderman’s unexpected arrival in theUK, which just so happened to coincide with Mick Jagger’s legal moves againstthe ‘News of the World.’ . . . \"They must have flown him in for this bust. Heappeared very fast; right after the writ had been issued he showed up at RobertFraser’s flat. Robert called up and said: ‘We’ve got this guy here, DavidSchneiderman, a Yank, just got in from California and he’s brought this greatAcid with him from the States. It’s called White Lightning or something fabulouslike that and he wants to lay some on us, man.’ So I said, ‘how f*****g great!Wait, Robert, I’ve got a fantastic idea, why don’t we all go down to Redlandsfor the weekend? I’ll call Keith right now and set it up.’ And right after allthis, Schneiderman vanished into thin air, (whisked out of the country I shouldthink).”It was many years later in the 1980s, that a television producer and failedactor by the name of David Jove was found to be none other than Schneiderman/Synderman operating under a new guise. This story was related by Philip Norman,author of the book 'The Stones,' based on accounts given to him by MaggieAbbott, a British film agent who had befriended 'David Jove' in LA. In anarticle for 'The Mail OnLine,' Norman states:\" . . . In January 1967, according to the account he gave Maggie Abbott,Snyderman was a failed TV actor, drifting around Europe in the American hippiethrong with Swinging London as his final destination. At Heathrow Airport he wascaught with drugs in his luggage and expected to be thrown into jail andinstantly deported. Instead, British Customs handed him over to some ‘heavypeople’ who hinted they belonged to MI5 and told him there was ‘a way out’ ofhis predicament. This was to infiltrate the Rolling Stones, supply Mick Jaggerand Keith Richards with drugs, and then get them busted. According to Snyderman,MI5 were operating on behalf of an FBI offshoot known as COINTELPRO (CounterIntelligence Program,) set up by the FBI’s director J. Edgar Hoover in the 1920sto \"protect national security and maintain the existing social and politicalorder.\"Scneiderman / Jove, was said to have been yet another devotee of the occultworks of Aleister Crowley, coincidentally.Meanwhile, despite the British Establishment's apparent moral stance against therecreational use of narcotics, the 1967 bust didn't appear to have done MickJagger any lasting damage when he was awarded a knighthood in the Queen'sBirthday Honours list in June 2002. She's clearly a highly liberal and forgivingindividual.WHERE'S CHARLIE?Like Aleister Crowley, the murderous cult leader Charles Manson is a name thatcrops up all over the place in the story of rock music's pivotal years,synchronistically woven into the fabric of the era. Manson's reputation as acrazed satanic psychopath has overshadowed his status as a reasonablyaccomplished musician in his own right. Capitalising on his notoriety followinghis murder conviction, various artists have recorded songs written by him,including Guns N' Roses, White Zombie and Marilyn Manson, (whose artist name isa hybrid of Marilyn Monroe and Charles Manson.)The suggestion that the infamous Tate/ LaBianca murders at the hands of Manson's'family' were influenced by the Beatles' track 'Helter Skelter' has long been apart of rock music lore. The story goes that Manson believed in an imminentapocalyptic race war between whites and blacks which he had dubbed 'HelterSkelter.' This war would be won by militant blacks, he surmised, leaving only afew white survivors – himself and his 'family' – who would hide out in anunderground city below California's Death Valley, before re-emerging to conquerthe blacks who, he believed, would be incapable of ruling themselves. It's saidthat he had interpreted subliminal messages to this effect hidden in music fromthe Beatles' 'White Album', as well as from the Book of Revelation in The Bible.'Helter Skelter' later became the title of the 1974 book written by VincentBugliosi, who was the prosecuting attorney in Manson's Los Angeles trial.Bugliosi got Manson charged for the murders despite him not having been presentat the scene, by arguing that he still bore responsibility for orchestratingthem.Some researchers, however, have claimed that the Manson/ Beatles connection isone that has been hyped out of proportion by certain parties keen to deflectattention from Manson's far closer association with another group. The BeachBoys, similar to the Rolling Stones, were marketed as something of a rival actto the Beatles in the mid-60s. Manson's reputation as a dangerous killer doesnot sit comfortably with the Beach Boys' clean and wholesome all-American image.The facts, though, tell a different story.Manson reportedly struck up a friendship, leading to a musical workingrelationship, with founding Beach Boy Dennis Wilson in 1968. Wikipedia relatesthe story as follows:\"The events that would culminate in the murders were set in motion in lateSpring 1968, when, (by some accounts,) Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys picked uptwo hitchhiking Manson women, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey, andbrought them to his Pacific Palisades house for a few hours. Returning home inthe early hours of the following morning from a night recording session, Wilsonwas greeted in the driveway of his own residence by Manson, who emerged from thehouse. Uncomfortable, Wilson asked the stranger whether he intended to hurt him.Assuring him he had no such intent, Manson began kissing Wilson's feet.\"Inside the house, Wilson discovered 12 strangers, mostly women. Over the nextfew months, as their number doubled, the Family members who had made themselvespart of Wilson's Sunset Boulevard household, cost him approximately $100,000.This included a large medical bill for treatment of their gonorrhoea and $21,000for the accidental destruction of his uninsured car, which they borrowed. Wilsonwould sing and talk with Manson, whose women were treated as servants to themboth.\"Wilson paid for studio time to record songs written and performed by Manson,and he introduced Manson to acquaintances of his with roles in the entertainmentbusiness. These included Gregg Jakobson, Terry Melcher, and Rudi Altobelli, (thelast of whom owned a house he would soon rent to actress Sharon Tate and herhusband, director Roman Polanski). Jakobson, who was impressed by 'the wholeCharlie Manson package' of artist/ lifestylist/ philosopher, also paid to recordManson material.\"Manson is said to have recorded at the home studio of Dennis Wilson's brother,Brian, but the recordings have never been made public. On their 1969 album'20/20,' the Beach Boys released a song written by Manson, originally titled'Cease To Exist,' but changed to 'Never Learn Not To Love'. Dennis Wilson issaid to have distanced himself from Manson as word of his volatile naturespread, and he ended up simply moving out of his own house and leaving Mansonthere.And so – bear with me – the assorted Manson connections gradually come backround to links with the Rolling Stones, all via a sinister organisation known asThe Process Church. Matt Sergiou's reporting in Conspiro Media's Stonesretrospective can't be bettered in telling the story:\"After brief sexual dalliances with Brian Jones and Keith Richards, the youngbeauty, (Marianne Faithfull,) eventually left her husband and began a four-yearrelationship with Mick Jagger in 1966. She too was fascinated by the occult andwas briefly involved with the Process Church of the Final Judgement, a religiousgroup founded in London in the early 1960s by former Scientologists, Mary andRobert DeGrimston.\"In his book, ‘Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and The Dark Side of theAge of Aquarius,’ Gary Lachman quotes Faithfull as saying of The Process: 'I wasattracted to them at first, mostly because they took me seriously when nobodyelse did. They were very admiring of me – they must have recognised that I havegot magic powers.'\" . . . He adds: 'in Haight-Ashbury, (the DeGrimstons) visited the offices ofthe ‘San Francisco Oracle,’ hoping to bring the underground newspaper over tothe cause. 'The Oracle' was too busy hyping the coming Age of Aquarius to giveSatan much time.\" . . . They paid a visit to the Black Pope, Anton LaVey, head of the Church ofSatan, but he had no use for them either. They set up a church at 407 ColeStreet. Their neighbour at 636 Cole was someone who would cause them a lot ofgrief in a year or so. His name was Charles Manson, soon to become head of ‘TheFamily,’ responsible for the gruesome Tate/ LaBianca murders in August of 1969.\"Just as the notorious Kray twins pop up in the interconnected stories of the1960s British pop industry, so another infamous serial killer remainsintertwined in the American version. David Berkowitz, who was convicted of sixmurders in the 'Son Of Sam' killings in New York in 1976-77, made a series ofallegations to investigative reporter Maury Terry from his jail cell, whichTerry documented in his book 'The Ultimate Evil'. At the time of his capture,Berkowitz claimed he was acting alone, and on the instruction of a demon whichcommunicated with him through his neighbour's dog, (as immortalised in the 1999Spike Lee-directed movie 'Summer Of Sam.') Berkowitz later amended hisconfession, however, stating that he was a member of a satanic cult, and thatthe shootings were ritual slaughters. Berkowitz implicated the Process Church inthis regard, also stating that the organisation was implicated in the 'Mansonmurders.'Conspiro Media continues with Terry's account of his Berkowitz interviews:\"The Process was very sophisticated and dedicated,’ Berkowitz told me. ‘They hadtheir hands in a lot of things, including drugs and that disgusting childpornography. They also provided kids for sex to some wealthy people, and I didsee some of those people at parties.' Michael Tsarion suggests Manson carriedout the 1969 murders on behalf of The Process. He says: “all these familiesliving on Cielo Drive were deeply involved – not only in drugs, but in childpornography – that’s the Tate family, the LaBianca family, and the Polanskifamily, and even Sharon Tate. They were all involved in paedophilia and childpornography. And The Process hit them for internal reasons.\"The amazing synchronistic quirks that eventually tie together so many key names,places and cultural events to the Rolling Stones, (and similarly the Beatles) –however tenuously – are so abundant that it seems to go beyond the realms ofhuman planning. It starts to feel far more likely that unknown forces within theuniverse are bringing everything together in these strange, interconnected ways.It's a process which has been dubbed 'synchro-mysticism.'LOOK BACK AT ANGERNo account of the Rolling Stones' involvement with the dark occult is completewithout examining their association with the independent avant-garde film-makerand practising satanist Kenneth Anger. Born Kenneth Anglemeyer in California in1927, he began making films at the age of ten, and has produced more than 40,his speciality being short montages of striking images lasting just a fewminutes. His themes merged homo-eroticism with occult and esoteric imagery. Likeso many of his rock star peers, Anger has expressed a fascination with the worksof Aleister Crowley, and has been a follower of his Thelema religion. There havebeen many claims that he was also an asset of the CIA, involved with the drugsaspect of the nefarious MK-Ultra programme.Crowley is said to have channelled a set of instructions and principles from a'guardian angel' he called Aiwass in 1904, and these formed 'The Book Of TheLaw,' which was the central basis for Thelema. This is the Greek word for'will,' and Crowley described the art of 'magick,' (his preferred spelling waswith the extra k,) as 'the art of causing change to occur in accordance withwill.'In the 1920s, Crowley established The Abbey Of Thelema in a farmhouse in Cefalu,Sicily, where he reportedly practised ritual and sex magick, until he wasdeported by Mussolini. This period saw him labelled in the mainstream press as'the wickedest man in the world.'In 1955, Anger and his friend, the renowned sexologist Alfred Kinsey, travelledto the now-derelict Abbey of Thelema. The pair had gone to film a shortdocumentary titled 'Thelema Abbey.' Anger and Kinsey restored many of the eroticwall paintings which had since been whitewashed over. Their arrival wasless-than-enthusiastically greeted by Sicilian locals, who had strongly resentedCrowley's presence there.Anger moved to London during its 'Swinging Sixties' heyday, apparently attractedto the homeland of his hero, Crowley. He mixed with the aristocrats, artists androck stars who populated the city's society scene, and was reportedly introducedto the Rolling Stones by art dealer Robert Fraser, sometimes known by thenickname 'Groovy Bob.' At the invitation of Jimmy Page, who owned the place from1971 to 1991, he spent some time staying at Boleskine House, Crowley's formerresidence on Loch Ness, Scotland, reportedly to help Page exorcise the ghost ofa headless man.In a 2013 radio interview with Miles Johnson, former mind control victim-turnedwhistle-blower Max Spiers had some comments to add regarding Crowley's infamoushome:\"Crowley opened a door to another dimension at Boleskine House. He was trying tosummon Baal in a six-month ritual . . . He collapsed a broken man at the end andcouldn't finish it and just left the house. He went back to London and had a bigfight with McGregor Mathis . . . They were the two leaders of the Golden Dawn atthe time. They had a massive feud, they fought for two or three years, andMathis was left a broken man too.\"(Boleskine is said to have been situated where it was due to the lack of directsunlight that hits that particular region of the Lochside valley. Its latitudeand longitude is also of importance in the energy grid system.)Anger's working association with the Rolling Stones first came from his11-minute film 'Invocation Of My Demon Brother', released in 1969. It is said tobe loosely based on Crowley's 1929 novel 'Moonchild.' Anger himself stars in themovie, as does his friend Anton LaVey, founder of the Church Of Satan. (Therehave been suggestions, however, that Anger himself was the real power behind theChurch and that the role of LaVey, a former circus lion tamer, was merely as acharismatic celebrity-style frontman.) Jagger provided what's loosely describedas the 'soundtrack' on his new Moog synthesiser, in reality a series of bleak,soulless instrumental stabs.Anger began collating footage back in 1966, (when else??) for what was intendedto be a film called 'Lucifer Rising', this time an interpretation of Crowley'spoem 'Hymn To Lucifer'. Anger assembled the film at The Russian Embassy, a housein the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco which he was renting, and thefilm was intended to draw on the hippie/ counter-culture movement of the areawhich was then in full swing. 'Invocation' consisted largely of footage intendedfor 'Lucifer Rising' which had been binned but later retrieved. The footage thatwasn't retained is said to have been stolen by a young musician and aspiringactor and poet named Bobby Beausoleil, ('beautiful sun' in French,) with whomAnger was rumoured to be having a gay affair. Anger's affectionate nickname forBeausoleil was reportedly 'Lucifer.' Beausoleil had been a one-time guitaristwith the Laurel Canyon group Love. He would go on to achieve notoriety as adisciple of Charles Manson's 'family,' getting life imprisonment for the tortureand murder of music teacher Gary Hinman. Beausoleil paid Hinman a visit, alongwith Manson disciples, Susie Atkins and Mary Brunner, to reportedly call in adebt owed to Manson, and ended up stabbing him to death.'Lucifer Rising' eventually got completed in 1972, with Anger filming newscenes, but didn't attain a full cinema release until 1980. Anger had decided tosteer its theme away from the San Francisco hippie scene, instead focusing onthe incoming astrological Age of Aquarius. Rolling Stones girlfriend MarianneFaithfull was cast as the goddess Lilith, appearing in a strikingly memorablescene filmed in front of The Sphinx in Egypt. Fellow film-maker and close friendof Anger, Donald Cammell, appeared as the Egyptian deity Osiris. Jimmy Page, bythis point with the highly successful Led Zeppelin, was hired to produce thefilm's soundtrack. Page also appears briefly, credited as 'Man Holding TheStella Of Revelation.' Anger and Page had a public falling-out before the film's1980 release, however, and soundtrack duties were given to the murderer BobbyBeausoleil who composed the music from his prison cell. By this point, Anger hadretracted his earlier claims that Beausoleil had stolen the film footage fromhim. Page's version of the soundtrack was released in 2012.Donald Cammell went on to direct the cult classic 'Performance', in which MickJagger starred as the stereotypical reclusive rock star alongside James Fox'sLondon gangster. Jagger also recorded the film's soundtrack. In turn, Cammell'sfather, Charles, was said to have been a close friend of Aleister Crowley. (It'snever too long before 'the Great Beast' himself pops up like the proverbial badpenny in rock music history!) Reportedly, Crowley used to draw up 400-pagehoroscopes for the Cammell children, who he lived close to.As well as inducting the Stones and their girlfriends into the world of Crowleyand the dark occult, Anger also generated a strong interest from Paul McCartney,(the real one, presumably!) who occasionally hung out with the Stones. McCartneyhad, in turn, been led to Anger through a mutual acquaintance, Robert Fraser.These revelations came from 'Spanish' Tony Sanchez, in his book 'Up And DownWith the Rolling Stones'. Sanchez was a long-time assistant and 'runner' for theStones, as well as being a gang member and drug dealer, with both Keith Richardsand John Lennon among his reported clients. Fraser is also said to haveintroduced Yoko Ono to McCartney, and later John Lennon. Diehard Beatles fanswould doubtless concur that he therefore has a lot to answer for. Prior to hisart career, Fraser served in The Kings' African Rifles colonial militaryregiment in East Africa, where his sergeant was none other than Idi Amin, laterthe murderous dictator of Uganda. There have even been claims that Fraser andAmin had a homosexual affair.The links just keep on coming.Anger himself had been initiated into the OTO, or Ordo Templi Orientis, ('OrderOf The Temple Of The East,') a secret society once helmed by Crowley, with somevery deep connections with the music industry through the ages, and of which,much more in a later chapter.AND FINALLY . . . The sudden death that has surrounded the Rolling Stones came knocking one moretime in 2014 when Mick Jagger's 49-year-old girlfriend, L'Wren Scott, was foundslumped on the floor of her New York apartment having apparently been hung froma doorknob by a black scarf.

The arrival of the contraceptive pill and the resulting sexualemancipation also had their part to play in reshaping social norms.There is another aspect of the decade's second half which has arguably had asmuch cultural impact as any of the above. This is the emergence of LSD,contemporary with what has come to be known as the 'hippie' movement, and themusic which provided the soundtrack for the transition. The youth-aimed soundsof 1965 and after – much of which came to be known by the newly-created monikerof 'folk rock' – were markedly different to what had been produced in the fiveyears previous. Although some may choose to put this down the organicprogression that occurs naturally in any art-form as time marches on, there areothers who will claim this mutation was less by accident than by design.There is some disagreement over the correct application of the term 'hippie,'particularly among the generation that has vivid recollections of the 60s.Alternative labels for the scene in question are 'counter-culture' and'anti-establishment.' Either way – on the surface at least – the artists thatpermeated this period were taken to be youths of a rebellious spirit who hadgrown tired of the hypocrisy and corruption of 'The Establishment,' and theaustere values of their parents' post-war generation. Their age group now hadits own foreign war, in Vietnam, and there was much opposition to it.Simultaneously, the recreational use of LSD, cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms andother substances to attain altered states of consciousness, had been ushered in.The phrases 'make love, not war' and 'turn on, tune in, drop out' became thecultural soundbites of the era.FROM HAIGHT TO THE CANYONRock music lore has it that the cultural movement of these times was centredaround the 'free love' city of San Francisco, and particularly, itsHaight-Ashbury district. As Wikipedia puts it:\"The earlier bohemians of the beat movement had congregated around SanFrancisco's North Beach neighbourhood from the late 1950s. Many who could notfind accommodation there turned to the quaint, relatively cheap andunder-populated Haight-Ashbury. The Summer of Love (1967,) the 1960s era as awhole, and much of modern American counter-culture have been synonymous with SanFrancisco and the Haight-Ashbury neighbourhood ever since.\"\"During the 'Summer of Love,' psychedelic rock music was entering themainstream, receiving more and more commercial radio airplay. The ScottMackenzie song \"'San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair,)' writtenby John Phillips of The Mamas & the Papas, became a hit single in 1967. TheMonterey Pop Festival in June further cemented the status of psychedelic musicas a part of mainstream culture and elevated local Haight bands such as theGrateful Dead, Big Brother and the Holding Company and Jefferson Airplane tonational stardom.\"In 2008, however, a rock music journalist by the name of Dave McGowan began aseries of web-based articles making an alternative claim for the birthplace ofthe counter-culture movement. This was a little-known district of his native LosAngeles known as Laurel Canyon. McGowan pointed out that a vastly larger arrayof artists who characterised those years emerged out of this small region in theHollywood hills, starting in 1964-65, a good two years before the Haight-Ashburyexplosion. Their number includes, but is far from limited to; the Doors, theMamas & The Papas, the Byrds, Frank Zappa & The Mothers Of Invention, CaptainBeefheart, the Monkees, Steppenwolf, Alice Cooper, Arthur Lee & Love, TheEagles, John Mayall, Carole King, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, BuffaloSpringfield, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Jackson Browne, James Taylor and JoniMitchell. Even a pre-Lindsey Buckingham Fleetwood Mac based themselves there, asdid the Beach Boys. Many of these artists did not hail from LA at all, but hadbeen drawn, magnet-like, from all corners of the US, Canada and even Britain.What could have been the attraction of a neighbourhood that had no previousmusical heritage whatsoever?McGowan wasn't the first researcher to highlight the Canyon's musical heritage.He revealed that his own interest was sparked after reading a copy of MichaelWalker's 2007 book 'Laurel Canyon: The Inside Story of Rock-And-Roll's LegendaryNeighbourhood' while on holiday. What McGowan found so interesting, followingsome further delving, was that this community of rebellious musicians seems tohave grown up out of the Canyon almost overnight, and the influence that theywent on to wield on youth culture was almost unbelievable, given the tinydistrict of just a few streets from which it all happened.His findings constituted his 2008 web series entitled 'Inside The LC: TheStrange But Mostly True Story of Laurel Canyon,' and the resulting book, 'WeirdScenes Inside The Canyon,' published in 2014. As McGowan told me in the GoodVibrations podcast interview I recorded with him:\"It happened very, very quickly. You think of an organic, grass roots movement,and you think of these struggling artists playing coffee houses, and maybegetting on college radio, and slowly working their way up to some sort ofmainstream acceptance. And this didn't happen like that. I mean, these peoplearrived in town and within weeks they had fully-formed bands and brand newinstruments and recording contracts and studio space. So all these people,really just in the space of two years, just simultaneously congregated on LaurelCanyon. LA did not have any kind of vibrant music scene before Laurel Canyon.The music industry pretty much moved here because that's where the artists were,rather than the other way around.\"Coming to realise the true scale of impact that Canyon residents had had, hefelt inspired to do some digging into the backgrounds of these artists. What hefound was highly revealing, and may well provide the answer to the earlierquestion. Almost without exception, he discovered, the fathers of themusic-makers came from backgrounds in either the US military, the CIA, various'intelligence' (their words) and security services, or some other department ofthe US government. One of the key characters was one Admiral George StephenMorrison.\"You don't find a stranger juxtaposition between father and son than with JimMorrison and his father. Jim Morrison was actually one of the most unlikely rockstars. His dad – which had never been reported before it first appeared in myweb series in 2008 – was actually the navy Admiral that was in charge of thefleet of ships involved in the notorious Tonkin Gulf incident. And this was theincident that led America directly into a very prolonged and bloody ground warin South East Asia! This was what provided the justification to send in groundtroops and turn it into a complete bloodbath. And it's been all but officiallyacknowledged that the incident is likely to never have happened. The ships neveractually came under attack. It was a classic false flag orchestrated directly byJim Morrison's dad! And almost simultaneously, we had him emerging out of LaurelCanyon as this fully-formed icon of the anti-war crowd.\"Admiral Morrison died at the tail end of the very year McGowan published hisfindings into the strange links between Laurel Canyon and the US military. AfterLC's heyday, Jim Morrison went on to attain dubious fame as a member of thefabled '27 Club' – one of an absurdly high number of prominent musicians whojust happened to meet an untimely end at the age of 27. (That's if you don'taccept the claims of him faking his own death with US secret service assistance– more of that in a later chapter!) A popular quote attributed to Jim Morrisonreads: 'The most loving parents and relatives commit murder with smiles on theirfaces. They force us to destroy the person we really are; a subtler kind ofmurder', which takes on a chilling resonance in light of the information above.Crucially, McGowan added:\"The neighbourhood just happened to house a covert military intelligencefacility, which was the first thing that raised alarm bells with me when I readMichael Walker's book.\"This was The Lookout Mountain Air Force Station, founded in 1947, the same yearas the CIA, which secretly produced motion pictures and still photographs forthe United States Department of Defense and the Atomic Energy Commission, andwas involved in the US government's nuclear testing programme. Walt Disney,Marilyn Monroe and Ronald Reagan are said to have worked there covertly. Thebase was decommissioned in 1968 during Laurel Canyon's musical heyday. It waslater converted into a private residence and was bought in January 2015 by theHollywood actor Jared Leto.As McGowan continued:\"Frank Zappa's another interesting one. His dad was a chemical warfare engineer,initially assigned to the Edgewood Arsenal, which was not only the long-timehomebase of US chemical warfare research, but has been implicated repeatedly invarious unclassified documents as a hotbed of MK-Ultra research. Frank Zappa wasactually born at the Edgewood Arsenal! The family lived in housing right thereon the base. Zappa was born, raised and educated there for the first seven yearsof his life, which is a pretty curious background for a rock star to have!\"Then, on top of that, his wife, whose maiden name is Gail Sloatman, was alsofrom a naval intelligence family. Her dad came from a long line of career navalofficers. And she actually knew Jim Morrison from 20 years earlier. They kneweach other as kids and actually attended a naval kindergarten together when theywere five years old! So here you have another strange 'coincidence.' 20 yearslater he emerges as this larger-than-life rock star, and she as the wife ofanother larger-than-life rock star, all connected through military intelligencecircles. What are the odds that that just happened by chance?\"The father of Mamas & Papas' star John Phillips was also a career marine corpsofficer, McGowan added, and his mother, sister and first wife were all careeremployees of the defence department at The Pentagon. Furthermore, John Phillips'first wife, Susie Adams, was a direct descendent of John Adams, America's secondpresident. Even Phillips himself went to West Point and was being prepped for amilitary career.Further revelations about Phillips, meanwhile, came from his daughter Mackenzie.Phillips named her after his good friend Scott McKenzie, for whom he wrote thehippie anthem 'San Francisco (Be Sure To wear Some Flowers In Your Hair)'. Sheclaimed in her 2009 book 'High On Arrival', that on the eve of her 1979 weddingshe had sex with her father. “He was full of love,\" she wrote, \"and he was sickwith drugs. I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex withmy own father.” Mackenzie appeared on the 'Oprah Winfrey Show' in September 2009and embellished the story by adding that her father also injected her withheroin and cocaine, a process known as 'speedballing.' She claimed herincestuous relationship ended when she became pregnant, but did not know who hadfathered the child. Her father paid for her to have an abortion. John Phillipsis said to have been closely involved in a satanic network involving fourcharacters we have already met – cult leader Charles Manson, 'Rosemary's Baby'director Roman Polanski, murderer and one-time guitarist with the band Love,Bobby Beausoleil, and satanist film-maker Kenneth Anger.In July 1980, by which point he was chronically addicted to heroin, Phillips wasarrested and charged with running a large-scale drugs wholesaling operation. Hehad apparently been funding his habit by trading books of stolen prescriptionsfor bottles of pharmaceutical drugs at a Manhattan pharmacy, then trading thosewith his drug dealers for cocaine. Phillips narrowly escaped a possible 45-yearprison term. He died in 2001, aged 65, of reported heart failure.Meanwhile, similar military backgrounds can be uncovered with David Crosby,Graham Nash, Stephen Stills, and virtually all the other key players from the LCcrowd, said McGowan. Gram Parsons' stepdad, who raised him after his own fathersupposedly committed suicide, (though there are suspicions he was murdered,)turns out to have been closely involved in training Cuban expatriot groups inFlorida to overthrow the Castro regime, with the obvious suggestions of a CIAbackground that such a link brings. Parsons just missed becoming a member of thefabled '27 Club.' His birthday was just seven weeks away when his body wasdiscovered in a motel room near the Joshua Tree National Monument in SanBernardino County, California, having apparently overdosed on morphine andalcohol. (D'you know, I think I've come across that scenario before somewhere.)These revelations call into question just how organic and grass-roots the growthof the hippie movement may have been after all. Conversely, they present thevery distinct possibility that the entire scene may have been an exercise insocial engineering, cynically concocted by various Establishment think-tanks andtheir military-intelligence offshoots. The offspring of families employed in theprogramme would have been charged with spearheading it, either out of familyloyalty or by some method of coercion, and with giving it a credible public facethat the kids would willingly buy into. It's a suggestion that has horrifiedmany original-generation hippies, who consider it sacrilege that their cherishedmemories of this time could be subverted in such a way. The evidence, however,speaks for itself and takes some explaining away.Some grudging acceptance, along with some insight into the way that socialconditioning covertly works away at affecting the human mind, came from the userknown as 'choose2know' in the comments section of a blog article entitled 'WhatHappened To The Music?' She writes, insightfully:\"Patrick, I enjoyed your article as I’d read Dave McGowan’s exposé several yearsago and had seen the Youtube videos that were once available. It was allcertainly an eye-opener for me, and yet his allegations did not seem foolish orover the top. I was coming of age in the 60s era and the music impacted me morethan any other single thing in the culture. I was educated, well-read, and I hadan integral Christian background, yet I was completely taken over by the promiseof enlightenment to be found in rebellion. I’d almost prefer to believe that I’dbeen manipulated by some Power Elite than to acknowledge that I’d fallen forsome vapid cultural shift that negatively impacted my life for many years.\"Sex, drugs and rock and roll was a choice that many of us made, stupidlythinking that within the self-destructive behaviour lay some freedom, somemeaning that our parents couldn’t fathom. Obviously they just weren’t coolenough. I still listen up when I hear a Jim Morrison song, Hendrix wailing, orJanis Joplin singing her pain out. Neil Young was in a class by himself andseemed to be some mystic who had answers to all the questions. This musicaccompanied my life. It was the backbeat to failed relationships, getting high,and it provided me with the notion that I 'got it,' that I was in on somesecret.\"And the regrets still keep me awake some nights. I threw away an opportunityfor a first-class education. I said no to the good men and followed the bad boysto the clubs where they were doling out their imitations of my musical 'gods.' Iwonder how many of my generation failed to achieve what they could have becausethey too were seduced by this empty trap? Some may think I’m being too harshbecause, after all, aren’t the 60s the 'good ol' days' now? Yes, the civilrights and feminism seemed to gain ground, and you can bet I burned my bra andmarried the first draft dodger/ musician I could convince myself I loved. Well,my false idols began to die of drug overdoses, of suicide, and I woke up to thefact that they didn’t have any answers for me at all. I reclaimed my life andrectified as many mistakes as possible.\"Then the 80s arrived and I saw my own adolescent children being manipulated inthe same ways, just by different faces and a different beat. I saw it and Ifought it, but the system took them in too, into negativity and darkness.Television made it cool to be promiscuous, and the term 'friends with benefits'was part of their college education. Absolutely I believe that none of this wasby coincidence or mere synchronicity.\"And a viewer comment left below one of my Youtube talk videos on the subjectconcurred:\"What the 'hippie' movement did was discredit the voice of the youth by theEstablishment that was sending them to die in Vietnam. All their parents saw wasa bunch of dropout stoners that didn't 'love' their parents, country or God.They were at worst demonic, at best freeloading sex-addicted bums. And all thewhile their children thought they were 'expanding' their minds, loving theirfellow human beings and doing what's right. They were tricked, lied to andmanipulated by a power greater than they were able to understand.\"Further links between the record industry and the military intelligence complex,meanwhile, come from Thorn EMI in Britain and RCA in America, two of the biggestmusic corporations of decades past, having divisions steeped in militaryresearch and development and weapons systems. As a matter of curiosity, CliffRichard's father was a one-time employee of Thorn Electrical Industries. Cliffbegan recording for the EMI record label in the 1970s prior to its merging withThorn in 1979.Tragically, as this book was being finished in late 2015, the news came thatDave McGowan had passed away aged just 55, apparently as the result of cancer.He had died on 22nd November, the anniversary of the Kennedy assassination, anda highly symbolic date for a renowned conspiracy researcher to depart thisrealm. He left behind a body of work that remains invaluable, and the key tounderstanding so much about the bigger picture.ACID REIGNAs will be apparent throughout this book, the idea that certainconveniently-timed events can be written off as 'coincidence' when the resultingoutcome just happens to suit the agenda of the world's controlling forces sowell, goes well beyond the realms of credibility. And so it is with theemergence of LSD into the public domain, completely contemporaneously with theunfolding of the Vietnam War, and the changing identity of rock music.The iconic figure involved in the rapid arrival of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide,is the psychologist and hallucinogenic researcher Timothy Leary, who wasattached for a time to Harvard University, before getting expelled followingextensive experimentation with mind-altering drugs. Leary's credentials go alittle further, however. Many had suspected that he was working on behalf of theCIA, and this appears to have been borne out in a few cryptic comments he madein his later years. At one point, referring to his Harvard tenure, he reportedlyadmitted that: “some powerful people in Washington have sponsored all this drugresearch.” In Leary's autobiography 'Flashbacks,' published in 1983, he creditsCIA executive Cord Meyer with: \"helping me to understand my political culturalrole more clearly.\" Leary is said to have had an affair with Cord Meyer's wife,Mary, who was also intimately associated with President John F. Kennedy.According to Leary, Mary had sought him out for the purpose of learning how toconduct LSD sessions with Kennedy. In October 1964, Mary Meyer was found with abullet in the back of her head and another in her heart after going for a walkalong a canal in Georgetown, Washington DC.In 1954, Leary is reported to have been director of clinical research andpsychology at the Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Oakland, California. Part of hiswork involved devising a personality test which he called 'The Leary,' which wasused by the CIA to assess prospective employees.Reading between the lines it seems Leary was not in the direct employ of theCIA, but was rather utilised as a dupe. The controllers have long enjoyed thewell-worn strategy of engaging people who believe wholeheartedly in anindividual cause, and subverting that cause to suit their own, wider agenda.These individuals remain largely unaware of how their passion is being exploitedfor more nefarious means. The CIA had already run experiments to study theeffects on human behaviour of LSD during the 1950s. Leary would appear to havebeen just the candidate, given his track record, to be co-opted into theAgency's plans to roll out mind control experimentation through drugs on a muchlarger scale in the following decade. Another character, contemporary to Learyand an active name in the 'counter-culture' era, was Jerry Garcia of TheGrateful Dead, a key group from the Haight-Ashbury scene, who is often reportedto have been an undercover spy for the CIA.Incidentally, in 'The Playboy Interviews with John Lennon & Yoko Ono,' by DavidSheff and G. Barry Golson, John Lennon is quoted as saying: “We must alwaysremember to thank the CIA and the army for LSD, by the way. That’s what peopleforget.\"Like the Laurel Canyon story, Leary's CIA links call into serious question theconventional idea that he was a solo maverick, the self-styled 'Acid Guru,' whowas operating to his own personal agenda, connecting with a youthful generationand taking them on a wonderful journey of new discoveries. Viewed from theperspective of 50 years of hindsight, it becomes far more likely that the LSDera was another cynically calculated plot, running concurrent with other socialengineering methods in place at that most volatile of times.Further intrigue comes from a seemingly religious aspect to Leary's activities,very much tapping into the emerging New Age movement of spirituality that wasbeing ushered in during the 1960s. According to many accounts, this 'movement'was a creation of dark occult establishments such as the Church Of Satan as aform of 'controlled opposition' rather than something that evolved organically.There was also much talk of the upcoming zodiacal Age Of Aquarius, asimmortalised in the popular musical of the time 'Hair'. Nobody seems to be ableto give a definitive date as to when the earth moved, or will move, from Piscesinto this new astrological age, the estimates remaining hundreds of years apart.Wikipedia observes:\"The approximate 2,160 years for each age corresponds to the average time ittakes for the vernal equinox to move from one constellation of the zodiac intothe next. According to different astrologers' calculations, approximated datesfor entering the Age of Aquarius range from 1447 AD, (Terry MacKinnell,) to3597, (John Addey.) Astrologers do not agree on when the Aquarian age will startor even if it has already started.\"Leary described himself as 'a pagan,' and had sought to establish his own'religion' just prior to the acid era in 1966, (where have I come across thatyear before?) which he called The League for Spiritual Discovery – LSD forshort.The aim of the LSD influx would appear to be to have been the creation of awhole generation of young people who might otherwise have been galvanised intothe type of political activism that had occurred earlier in the decade –particularly in defiance of the unfolding Vietnam War – instead being sedatedinto a state of chemically-induced passivity, content in the spirit of thetimes, to 'drop out.' At the same time, this caused ever greater alienationbetween this generation of human lab-rats and that of their parents,kick-starting a long-term plan to break up family units and create generationalrifts in society, rendering each group more rife for further methods of controland manipulation.If the plan was indeed for this era to have a long-term and extremelyfar-reaching effect on all aspects of Western culture and fashion, few woulddisagree that the experiment could be considered a great success. Wikipediacomments:\"Hippie fashions and values had a major effect on culture, influencing popularmusic, television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, many aspectsof hippie culture have been assimilated by mainstream society. The religious andcultural diversity espoused by the hippies has gained widespread acceptance, andEastern philosophy and spiritual concepts have reached a larger audience. Thehippie legacy can be observed in contemporary culture in myriad forms, includinghealth food, music festivals, contemporary sexual mores, and even the cyberspacerevolution.\"TRIBAL GATHERINGSLSD had become an important backdrop to the Haight-Ashbury 'hippie' scene in SanFrancisco by the time of the legendary 'Summer Of Love' in 1967. It is said tohave arrived there as part of a CIA project, (with input from British'intelligence' services,) connected to the notorious MK-Ultra mind controlproject, (of which much, much more in a later chapter!), with this aspect of itbeing handled by a character named Ken Kesey. In popular culture, Kesey is bestknown as author of the 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest' novel of 1962, a storyof experimentation in a psychiatric ward which was made into a well-receivedfilm starring Jack Nicholson in 1975. Kesey's extra-curricular activities,besides being a convicted drug dealer, a stated CIA asset, and a former MK-Ultratest subject himself, involved running what was referred to as his 'MerryPranksters.' This was a commune which travelled around in a tour bus, freelydistributing LSD tablets and Koolaid laced with LSD, in key locations inCalifornia. The after-effects were then observed and studied.It also figured majorly at the fabled Monterey International Pop Festival inCalifornia in June 1967, where up to 90,000 young people are estimated to havecongregated over three days. In his book 'Aquarius Rising', author RobertSantelli documents the open use of hallucinogens at the event:\"LSD was in abundance at Monterey. Tabs of ‘Monterey Purple’ were literallygiven to anyone wishing to experiment a little. The police made no arrests, andset a precedent for future outdoor concerts, as there was a larger scheme inoperation tied into the MK-Ultra project.\"Sure enough, similar scenes were witnessed at the equally legendary Woodstockconcert in New York State two years later in August 1969. Interestingly, theoriginal funding for Woodstock, the brainchild of Artie Kornfeld of CapitolRecords, came from John Roberts, the heir to a large Pennsylvania-basedpharmaceutical company, along with two business partners. (It was anotherpharmaceutical company, Sandoz Laboratories of Switzerland, which is creditedwith having first synthesised LSD.) Roberts was later accused of using hiscompany for the mass drugging of the attendees, which appears to have been theplan.Either way, by the time of Woodstock, the original 'vibe' of the hippie era hadall but fizzled out, not helped by the horrors of the Manson murders over inCalifornia just a few days before the event. The Beatles were all but over too.Much of the consciousness and ideals of the counter-culture era, no matter howgenuine or manipulated it may all have been, made an exit along with the decadeas the 1970s dawned."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Inside The LC: The Strange but Mostly True Story of Laurel Canyon and the Birthof the Hippie Generation: * http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/nwsltr93.html [http://www.davesweb.cnchost.com/nwsltr93.html]Was Timothy Leary a CIA agent?: * http://www.whenthenewsstops.org/2011/04/was-timothy-leary-cia-agent-was-jfk.html [http://www.whenthenewsstops.org/2011/04/was-timothy-leary-cia-agent-was-jfk.html]Timothy Leary’s liberation, and the CIA’s experiments!

Or perhaps they have sold their souls, figurativelyor even literally for fame and fortune, and are now 'in the know?'\"Wayne Bush on The Higherside Chats podcast, June 2015HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHTCall me old-fashioned, (I get called much worse,) but like many who grew upduring the 1980s, I do tend to hold a nostalgic affection for the pop videos ofthat decade, and they have tended to colour my view of what a music promo shouldentail. Memories of Midge Ure evoking 'The Third Man' in Ultravox's atmospheric'Vienna', The Human League's mock film set on 'Don't You Want Me,' Duran Durancavorting on a Caribbean yacht in 'Rio' and Frankie Goes To Hollywood pittingworld leaders Reagan and Chernenko in a wrestling ring in 'Two Tribes' havestayed with me. (As well as anything involving Samantha Fox . . . but that's forslightly different reasons.) The likes of Madonna gyrating on a gondola in 'LikeA Virgin' and Michael Jackson's zombie-fest in 'Thriller' may take on a moremorally questionable tone put into their fuller context, but even they wereinnocent by comparison to music video content in the 2000s.Of course, 1980s pop videos were pretentious and overblown, and the visuals borelittle relevance to the lyrics which were often ambiguous themselves anyway. Buton reflection, it was more about what you didn't get from videos in decadespast. Particularly when it comes to dark occult symbolism, Satanic icons, andtrauma-based mind control triggers. Things are a little different now.BLINK AND YOU MISS ITIn my early days of grudgingly accepting that all was not quite as I'd thoughtin the mainstream music industry, one of the first elements I got put on to wasthe analysis of contemporary music videos that was done by the researchercalling himself Vigilant Citizen. On his monumentally popular websitewww.vigilantcitizen.com [http://www.vigilantcitizen.com], VC reveals himself tobe a young Canadian researcher who has studied symbolism and the occult, as wellas the MK-Ultra and Monarch and Beta Programming facets of trauma-based mindcontrol. (This subject area gets covered in-depth soon.) In the late 2000s, theVC site started posting detailed articles taking apart the symbols and occulticimagery that was routinely appearing in music videos. In all cases, the symbolsinvolved were unannounced, appeared in and out of shot very rapidly, and boreabsolutely no relation to the lyrical content of the song.An early example was the video to Rihanna's 2007 hit 'Umbrella,' which featuredJay-Z, and was a number one hit in the US, the UK and several other countries.It turns out that the song was originally written for Britney Spears, but wasgiven to Rihanna when her label rejected it, such is the interchangeable natureof corporate A-list artists. The video was directed by veteran industry playerChris Applebaum and, conveniently, won Video of the Year at the 2007 MTV VideoMusic Awards.VC's analysis of the lyrical theme of 'Umbrella' was based wholly on the work ofthe wonderful US researcher Lenon Honor, whose work all resides atwww.lenonhonor.com [http://www.lenonhonor.com]. Lenon had deduced that, far fromportraying Rihanna's appreciation of her lover keeping her safe and secure intheir relationship, its underlying meaning concerns demonic possession and darkenergetic manifestations. As VC writes:\"In a nutshell, the song talks about a storm that’s about to take place, andRihanna offers her loved one protection under her umbrella. In this song, 'Youcan stand under my umbrella' can have a sexual connotation, but it mostly means'You can be under my protection'. When you are under something’s protection,this something has more power than you regarding your own security. You dependon it. It has control over you.\"He goes on to explain that Rihanna herself portrays two roles throughout thevideo. In some shots she is seen in a virginal white dress, symbolising theinnocent 'good girl' archetype. In others, she appears in black complete withclawed fingernails, symbolising a dark entity that is trying to take her over.The album from which the track is taken is called 'Good Girl Gone Bad.' One ofthe song's lyrics is: 'You're part of my entity, here for infinity.'For no apparent reason, the video features split-second images of Rihanna insidea pyramid, and striking a very curious anatomical pose, (which gets furtheranalysis in this book's chapter on demonic possession.) Some of these strangeaspects rang some early alarm bells for me, as they did for Lenon and a numberof other researchers. One was Freeman Fly. Another was Mark Dice, whose pride atbeing a 'Christian patriot' does tend to colour the tone of his Youtube videos,along with his references to the likes of Ke$ha and Miley Cyrus as 'satanicsluts' making him unpalatable for some. Either way, he still makes some astuteobservations, and his work, I would suggest, is worth a look.'Umbrella' is very far from an isolated case. Further examples of videosproviding an A-Z of dark occult imagery are everywhere. Katy Perry's 'DarkHorse' is replete with ancient Egyptian symbolism, with Perry playing the roleof a Pharaoh who uses black magic to destroy men and acquire their belongings.Plenty of human-animal hybrids and snakes in attendance, and a giant floatingpyramid resembling a UFO. Standard.Azealia Banks' 'Yung Rapunxel' sees an owl flying out of her head before sherides a bull and swallows a miniature Beats By Dre-branded audio speaker.Esoteric and Masonic symbols depicting duality and astro-theology lie allaround. As they so often do.Jessie J provides a rare example of a British artist displaying all thetrauma-based mind control hallmarks usually reserved for American artists. Inher 'Price Tag' video she sports Mickey Mouse ears and appears as a marionettehaving her strings pulled, as well as posing inside a doll's house.Kanye West's unsettling 'Power' meanwhile, takes the dubious art form to a newlevel, consisting of just one stationary composite image of occult symbols, thecamera panning out as the song progresses to reveal ever more detail, endingjust as Kanye is about to be beheaded by two swords.Whatever excuses the deniers may come up with – 'they're just fashionstatements,' 'they're just a way to look cool,' etc – I'd love to hear theirreasoning behind why depictions of demonic entities have been placed into recentvideos by three prominent artists.In Lil' Wayne's video for 'Love Me,' for a split-second Wayne is seen depictedas a type of devil, with horns, a bizarrely tattooed forehead and maniacal grin,and standing next to a girl with a Monarch butterfly obscuring one of her eyes.This occurs at the point in the lyrics where Wayne states \"these hoes love melike Satan, maaan.\" (Quite why the hoes love Satan in the first place isn'texplained, but apparently it's a given that they do.)A horrific demon-like entity appears, again for a split-second, in the video forRobin Thicke's 'Get Her Back.' And a similar being makes a cameo a little afterthree minutes into Beyonce's 'XO,' generating a horrified reaction fromBeyonce's female companion, while B herself smiles knowingly. In these cases,the images bear no relation to the lyrics being heard at the time.What possible reason could there be for the inclusion of such imagery if all inthe music business is good and well?Some readers may recall the stir created by Madonna's video for 'Like A Prayer'in 1989 when she was depicted kneeling at the statue of a black Jesus,suggesting imminent fellatio. This was clearly calculated controversy for thesake of marketing, and seems almost innocent when compared with the dark,sinister overtones being placed into music videos now. Sceptics still claim thatthe Satanic stuff is being put in for no other reason than to get the artiststalked about, and thus increase sales for the corporations. But anyone who haseven a rudimentary understanding of the priest class that controls humanactivity, and the ancient symbols they use as their calling cards, will be ableto see another dynamic at work. These symbols are being used for a very darkmethod of mind control, with aspects of Predictive Programming at play too.There's far more on that particular subject later in the book as well.As VC and many other researchers were starting to observe, the same icons werecropping up time and time again in the videos of the most prominent stars of thetime – Beyonce, Jay-Z, Katy Perry, Kanye West, Lil' Wayne, Britney Spears andothers – besides recurring offerings from Rihanna and Lady Gaga. Among the mostcommon were depictions of pyramids, all-seeing-eyes, pentagrams, crosses,(inverted or otherwise,) Monarch butterflies, dolls, broken mirrors, unicornsand rainbows. A classic example of these images on full display came fromKe$ha's video for the charming song 'Die Young,' (which advances the view thatlife is harsh and ultimately pointless, so we may as well all party wildly, andaccept that we're going to die young – really great stuff considering the targetmarket for Ke$ha and artists of her ilk is girls aged around 8 upwards.) The'Die Young' video features an upside-down cross, a pentagram of the type oftendepicted in satanic rituals, and a pyramid with an all-seeing eye super-imposed,all in the space of a few seconds.A nice, alternative message to the one peddled by 'Die Young' came from RaquelCastro in 2015 with her song 'Young & Dumb,' which pretty much tells youeverything you need to know. A promo shot for the song shows her obscuring oneeye with a flower.'Eye' symbolism is an aspect of the agenda that has transcended the videos, tothe point that virtually every prominent music-maker of the past decade has beenphotographed highlighting or obscuring one of their eyes. There are variousmethods to achieve this; the eye can be encircled, one eye can be obscured by ahand, or the hair, or the brim of a hat. There was a style of photography whichbecame very fashionable a few years ago, whereby just one half of a celeb's facewould be shown in a promotional picture, the other half being out of frame. Inever understood why this was 'cool' or had become so widespread, but now it allmakes sense.Either way, the idea is to draw the viewer's attention to one eye. As with allsymbols, this is interpreted in different ways according to who's doing theinterpreting. It's often assumed that this pays homage to the 'all-seeing eye'depicted in freemasonic imagery, and on the pyramid on the US dollar bill. This,in turn, is taken as a representation of the Eye of Horus of Egyptian mythology.A common view is that both of these symbols reflect the pineal gland that liesat the centre of the human brain, often referred to as 'the third eye,' whichgives access to higher levels of consciousness when activated, and acts as aportal to other realms of existence.A further interpretation, however, is that limiting a person's vision to justone eye, rather than tapping into the balanced unity of both, is evoking ahuman's base consciousness, the absolute lowest form of self-awareness making itjust possible for the person to operate mechanically in this physical domain,but completely cut off from any higher spiritual capacities. Certainly, the typeof music that now accompanies the artists employing this symbol seems in-keepingwith that overall concept. For me, the jury is still out on two prominentartists whose wearing of an eye patch was always an iconic part of their image –90s singer Gabrielle, and 80s hip-hop pioneer Slick Rick. In Rick's case, apromo shot exists of him sporting his patch whilst concealing his arm in hisjacket, in a Napoleon-esque Masonic stance. Was he being employed as a veryearly example of calling-card symbolism in that particular genre?Whatever the case, a surprising number of your favourite pop stars feel the needto make this gesture when in the public eye, (no pun intended.)THEMATIC THROWBACKSI think anyone vaguely alert to what's going on around them would be well withintheir rights to ask what these motifs have to do with pop songs aimed at youngpeople and played daily on mainstream TV outlets. It's a far cry from TheSpecials crammed into a car in 'Ghost Town' or Dexy's Midnight Runners rompingin dungarees, isn't it?Despite the apparent innocence of previous decades, however, there is the oddexception, giving an indication that The Hidden Hand has been making itspresence felt for far longer than just the past few years.Duran Duran's 'Union Of The Snake' promo from 1983 offers some very interestingvisual imagery. At the time it would have been seen as a normal part of theself-important pretentiousness that Duran videos typically carried. But viewedin the context of what we've now come to know about the true nature of theworld, it takes on rather more sinister connotations.It begins with the group driving a jeep at night through a remote desertlandscape, (the Area 51 region of Nevada, possibly?) Slinking around on the sanddunes are bizarre, lizard-like creatures. Simon Le Bon gets distracted by apretty female bellhop, who beckons him over to a strange elevator which descendsbelow the desert surface. It emerges into an underground candlelit temple thatcould be a depiction of the DUMBs (Deep Underground Military Bases) which areknown to exist in the US, Australia and other countries. More lizard beings arearound, and the base is full of children who appear to be kept captive, many ofthem in white robes. A character is seen juggling wearing a black and whitechecquered top, similar to the pattern found on the floor of masonic temples, aswell as being a known trigger in trauma-based mind control. The title of thesong itself takes on an intriguing air, of course, and a curious added touch isthe depiction of a single eye on the record sleeve image.(Another veiled allusion to Area 51, incidentally, comes from the 1971 JamesBond film 'Diamonds Are Forever.' In one scene, Bond tails a scientist in acamper van as he drives out of Las Vegas into the Nevada desert. Entering whatlooks like a secret military base, the van goes into a lift and descends severalstoreys underground into a covert research facility. We later see what appearsto be a mock-up of the Apollo moon landings on a film set – possibly a sly nodto the 'conspiracy theory,' still fresh at the time, that NASA faked the realmoon landings in 1969?)From the same year, meanwhile, comes a very popular offering lifted from MichaelJackson's 'Thriller' album. The aforementioned Lenon Honor put out acomprehensive analysis of the video for 'Beat It' a few years ago. On the faceof it, the song appears to be all about warfare between two rival street gangs,with the title taken to mean 'scram,' or 'get out of here if you know what'sgood for you.' Lenon's highly plausible breakdown, however, reveals much abouthow depictions that are so obvious to the conscious mind once pointed out, canotherwise go completely un-noticed to all but the subliminal mind, which storesand reacts to information without the discerning awareness of the viewer.The most telling aspect comes in the latter part of the video where the rivalgang members meet in a warehouse. As they go through their carefullychoreographed dance routines, it becomes clear that Jackson and the otherdancers are simulating masturbation with their hand gestures, suddenly bringinga whole new meaning to the term 'beat it.' Closer inspection reveals the openlygay mannerisms and garbs of the gang leaders, along with a scene where Michaelis seen apparently sporting an erection in his bedroom as he anticipates theshowdown that lies ahead. The video, Lenon Honor concludes, is a celebration ofmale homosexuality rituals and group masturbation. This ties in with the agreedview of many observers that one of the entertainment industry's socialengineering objectives is to promote homosexuality and the destruction of thetraditional family unit, through slyly implanting ideas into the public psyche.You can view the video for yourself and assess his findings here –http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0[http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0] Some of the reasons as to why thecontrollers would go to such lengths to promote such ideas will become cleareras this book progresses.FOR THOSE WHO WISH TO SEEAs the observations of VC and others came across my radar, it coincided with mynew understanding of who, or what, has really been pulling the strings of humanaffairs for aeons, and I was able to put the two together to gain a view on whatwas really being communicated here. It became clear that the elite forcescontrolling the world, who many refer to as the Illuminati, utilise a variety ofsymbols and cyphers to announce and highlight their activities. The Illuminatinametag actually refers to The Bavarian Illuminati, a secret-society establishedin Germany on the esoterically significant date of 1st May 1776, and in closeconjunction with the Rothschild banking family who were still based in Germanyat the time. Official lore, (along with some useful disinformation peddled bythe author Dan Brown through his book 'Angels And Demons',) dictates that 'theIlluminati' has long since dissolved and is now defunct, although manyresearchers would disagree. Either way, 'the Illuminati' has come to be adoptedas a convenient catch-all phrase for the secret-society dark occultists whocontinue to run the show, so for the sake of convenience, I will use it fromtime to time when referring to the control network.There always seems to be more than one reason why the Illuminati revealthemselves in their various different ways – a main purpose with severalsubsidiary reasons attached – all of which serve their agenda in some way. Sothe question of why the forces that control the entertainment industry wouldchoose to announce their presence and their full ownership of the artistsconcerned, has a few possible answers. One is that the manipulators like toplace their calling cards in full view – albeit subliminally. Part of thereason, it has been suggested, is that this offers a method of covertcommunication between members, so that a dark occultist spotting one of their'own' symbols in a music video can understand that this is the work oflike-minded individuals sharing the same mindset.(You also have to wonder, given the large number of alert individuals who arenow up on the use of occult symbolism thanks to the research opportunitiesafforded by the internet, whether there's actually an element of themanipulators taunting and mocking those that are on to them. As if to say, 'weknow you lot can see what we're doing, but you try communicating that to therest of the brainwashed population and see where it gets you. Let us know how itworks out for ya!')A stronger suggestion, however, is that these images are in place to have ahypnotic effect on the subconscious mind of the viewing public, which in thecase of most pop music videos, comprises children, teenagers and young adults.Conventional science tells us that the human brain absorbs several millionpieces of information from any of the five senses, every second. Because theconscious mind doesn't have the capacity to fully process that colossal amountof data, however, it works to filter out the bulk of it so that only what areconsidered the important elements are retained in the conscious memory. Thisdynamic is seen at work among motorists, who often realise that they've drivenseveral miles without being able to recall any detail of the journey. It'sreferred to as 'automatic pilot' mode, and it's the same process. The brain hasbeen recognising all the information, and if an accident were about to occur,the driver would have reacted instantly. But otherwise, much of the receiveddata is considered unimportant, so no memory of it gets retained.It's a different matter with the subconscious, or subliminal mind, (meaningbelow the threshold of conscious perception.) In this realm, perceived images,phrases and sensations can lie dormant in their multitudes. Most of them willhave no reason to be recalled into the conscious mind, so sit there harmlessly,but some can be brought into recognition by triggers – by being experiencedagain, or by having memories of them evoked. Those that don't get taken throughcan still have an effect on the behaviour or perceptions of the individual,without them having any awareness of it.A third reason often cited for the placement of favourite signs in music videos,goes back to the recognition that everything in existence is universal energy,vibrating at an infinite range of frequencies. Because humans are gifted withconsciousness, scholars and researchers in this field concur, and because theenergy field of which we are all a part is basically fluid and malleable, we areable to shape and mould our reality and determine certain results, purely by ourthoughts and intent. This is a great truth which has been understood by gurus,sages and mystics throughout human history, but which has been systematicallykept from the bulk of humanity, because the last thing that those controllingthe show with selfish intent want, is for their subjects to understand the truepower that this reality grants them. This truth has been purposely obscured bythe man-made religions of the world, too, by conditioning humans to believe thatthe only true power in the universe lies with some named god entity to whom usinsignificant mortals must all cower in subservience, rather than teaching thatwe are all, in fact, individuated aspects of the one source consciousness.It's from the recognition that we have the power to create the kind of realitywe wish to experience by focussing our attention on it, (if done correctly andwith an appropriate level of conscious intent,) that the well-worn phrase'energy flows where attention goes' originates. The idea is that by focussingconscious attention on an idea or a scenario – particularly when a large groupof people are all pooling their conscious intent together on a desired result –a situation can be brought into reality through being empowered in this way.This is the origin of the well-known terms 'be careful what you wish for,' and'speak of the devil and the devil will appear.'So what many suggest is that, by placing into music videos symbols and imagesthat represent the Illuminati power structure, the structure itself can beempowered and strengthened by the collective energy coming from the vast numbersof people making a connection with them – albeit on a subconscious level. Onreflection, this struck me as a pretty good reasoning as to why pyramids, eyes,pentagrams and many other esoteric symbols were popping up between scenes ofBritney Spears or Lady Gaga singing some vacuous pop song.And they're far from the only tactics being used."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Waking Times: The Music Industry Exposed – Misuse and Abuse of Esoteric Symbols: * http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/12/02/music-industry-exposed-misuse-abuse-esoteric-symbols/ [http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/12/02/music-industry-exposed-misuse-abuse-esoteric-symbols/]Rihanna's 'Umbrella' video: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=_iQRXuAo6Eg [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=_iQRXuAo6Eg]Rihanna's 'Umbrella' video examined by Vigilant Citizen: * http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/occult-and-prophetic-messages-in-rihannas-umbrella/ [http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/occult-and-prophetic-messages-in-rihannas-umbrella/]Kanye West's 'Power' video: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=L53gjP-TtGE [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=L53gjP-TtGE]Lady Gaga's 'Alejandro' video: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=niqrrmev4mA]Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' video: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0 [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=0KSOMA3QBU0]Lil Wayne's 'Love Me' video: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=KY44zvhWhp4 [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=KY44zvhWhp4]Robin Thicke's 'Get Her Back' video: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=bz_EqawkmTg [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=bz_EqawkmTg]Beyonce's 'XO' video: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=3xUfCUFPL-8 [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=3xUfCUFPL-8]Duran Duran's 'Union Of The Snake' video: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=n6p5Q6_JBes [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=n6p5Q6_JBes]Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' video: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0 [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=oRdxUFDoQe0]Lenon Honor video on subliminal messages and mind control: * http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=By6yDL7LGgY [http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=By6yDL7LGgY]Freeman Fly's website: * www.freemantv.com [http://www.freemantv.com]Freeman Fly on Youtube: * www.YouTube.com/user/Freemantv [http://www.YouTube.com/user/Freemantv]‎Mark Dice's website: * www.markdice.com [http://www.markdice.com]Mark Dice on Youtube: * www.YouTube.com/user/MarkDice [http://www.YouTube.com/user/MarkDice]‎Lady Gaga 'stole' the identity of Lina Morgana: * http://starcasm.net/archives/64492 [http://starcasm.net/archives/64492] * http://www.henrymakow.com/lina_morgana_leftby_richard_ev.html#sthash.yNQqJElY.dpuf [http://www.henrymakow.com/lina_morgana_leftby_richard_ev.html#sthash.yNQqJElY.dpuf]Rihanna's 'Rock 101' video analysed by Marshall Hammond: * http://marshallhammond.hubpages.com/hub/Esoteric-Media-Rihannas-Rock-Star-101 [http://marshallhammond.hubpages.com/hub/Esoteric-Media-Rihannas-Rock-Star-101]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9A SHOW OF HANDSThe secret language for those who who know.'A man always has two reasons for doing anything: a good reason and the realreason.'Banking magnate J. P. Morgan (1837-1913)Symbolism is the language of the subliminal mind, and if the symbols in videosdon't work their magic, the hand signals being flashed by many of the artistsconcerned just might.Anyone paying attention to how music's A-listers behave in public will havenoticed an array of hand signals on frequent display. It's merely a question ofwhether they've been consciously acknowledged, or absorbed at a subliminallevel.GETTING THE HORNAt first glance, many appear completely innocent. The best example is the signsaid to have been created by the American activist and campaigner Helen Keller.She devised a system of hand signing for the deaf, of which one of the mostprominent is the signal to convey the phrase 'I love you.' To achieve this, themiddle fingers of one hand are bent down, while the two outer fingers and thumbremain extended. The fingers are said to represent a capital 'I', 'L' and 'U.'The symbol has long since been adopted into mainstream use, and people can beseen flashing it frequently, and apparently innocently.The key is in the thumb, because when the thumb is brought in to hold down thetwo bent fingers, it takes on a different connotation. This is now the 'hornedhand,' known in occult circles as 'il mano cornutto,' and is an ancient methodof signalling said by many to be a depiction of the androgynous goat-headedentity known as Baphomet, originally a pagan deity, but later adopted andcorrupted by Satanists as a symbol of their twisted ideals.Writer Matt Sergiou of Conspiro Media elaborated further on the origins of theBaphomet icon in a 2014 article on his site:\"When the Knights Templar were arrested, tortured and interrogated by KingPhilip IV of France in the 14th century at the time of the Roman CatholicInquistion, some of them confessed that they had participated in the worship ofa 'heathen' idol, usually consisting of a severed head and known as, Baphomet.In the mid-1800s, the French occultist, magician, and freemason, Eliphas Levidrew a picture of an androgynous figure with a goat’s head, dubbed the ‘Baphometof Mendes,’ a name which harks back to themes explored and recorded by Greekhistorian Herodotus thousands of years earlier in ‘The History – Book II.’ Hewrote of Djedet, an ancient Egyptian city known in Greek as Mendes, and in itsnative language as Banebdjed, in honour of the ram deity of the same name.Herodotus described how this Mendesian God was represented with the head, legs,and fleece of a goat. He also stated that in Egyptian, the goat and Pan are bothcalled Mendes.\"Levi’s illustration, which combined elements from The Devil in Tarot cards,lives on, most notably through organisations such as the Church of Satan, whichhas adopted and adapted the iconic image as its official logo.\"So we have a internationally-recognised symbol for 'I love you' just one thumbaway from a calling card for mystery religion magick.Some researchers have suggested that this apparent contradiction isn't toosurprising when you delve into the background of Helen Keller, who wasreportedly an occultist and student of Madame Helena Blavatsky's Theosophypractice. The suggestion is that the sign was placed into public usage afterbeing deliberately designed to be similar to the Horned Hand. Naturally, the twosigns and their meanings have been much misconstrued – particularly as Keller'sversion is supposed to be shown with the palm facing outwards, and the 'Satanic'version with the palm kept facing the user. It does seem very convenient,however, that a method of symbolic communication between Satanists can bewritten off with the innocent cover story that it means 'I love you' if everit's called into question.It certainly gets around. Virtually all of the world's major leaders have beenphotographed flashing it at public events, George W Bush, Barack Obama, HillaryClinton and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad among them. The symbol, (with thumb tucked in,)was a favourite of Anton LaVey, the founder of the Church Of Satan, and thequestion of whether it was intended to evoke Baphomet or was LaVey's way oftelling his followers 'I love you' is probably answered by the nature of theorganisation he headed.It's equally prolific in the music world, however. John Lennon famously throwsup the sign on the front cover of The Beatles' 'Yellow Submarine', with fingersfacing the camera on one hand, and turned away on the other to make sure hecovers all possible meanings. Eminem and Azealia Banks are among the artiststhat have depicted themselves with 'devil horns' in recent times, with JustinBieber, Rihanna, a latter-day Paul McCartney, (or should that be 'PaulMcCartney'?) and an assortment of heavy metal artists among other users. DiscoMix Club founder and former Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince was photographedsporting the sign at the funeral of his friend Jimmy Savile, (On 9th November2011 as a matter of interest – 9/11/11,) shortly before Savile was publiclyrevealed to have been a serial child rapist, Satanist and necrophiliac. (Princesaid at the time: \"If there's a Heaven, he'll be laughing now if he's got time.\"The laughing bit, yes. The Heaven bit, I beg to differ.)ALL THE SIXESThose quick to write off this sign as innocent confusion between two conflictingmeanings have a further debunking task, meanwhile. There's another hand signthat's proven very popular within the music world. This one involves the thumband second finger of one or both hands touching to create a circle, leaving theremaining three fingers outstretched. The perfectly acceptable explanation isthat it simply means 'OK' or 'everything is fine,' and we see it in public useall the time. In many cases, the intent behind it is doubtless entirelyinnocent. It does, however, carry another connotation.Within Satanic societies, the arrangement of thumb and first and second fingersis seen as a depiction of the figure 6, with the three extended fingersindicating 'to the power of three', thus 666. In itself – just as with any othernumber or symbol – 666 remains completely neutral, with neither negative norpositive connotations. That changes when it becomes charged with the energeticintent of the individuals putting it to use, however. 666 has long been adoptedby Satanists and imbued with the negative intent for which they stand. Withinthese circles, it is said to be a representation of base consciousness withinwhich the majority of humans are manipulated into being kept. 666 is alsoheavily linked to the influence of Saturn. When the corresponding symbols areput on public display, therefore, and attract the focus of those that view them,an energetic connection is being established, completely unbeknown to most. Justas the Baphomet 'horned hand' is markedly similar to 'I love you' as an instantway of protesting its innocence, so the '666' can be written off as simply 'OK'when an explanation is required. Three sixes can be seen cleverly hidden in theItalic logo of the Disney corporation, itself a deeply Satanic organisationhiding behind a respectable front. Walt Disney himself was a 33rd degreefreemason and reportedly a Satanist. The sixes also appear in the crossedfingers logo of the UK's National Lottery, disguised as single quote marks inthe Vodafone logo, and in countless other corporate designs, including many ofthe advertisements for Dr Dre's Beats By Dre headphones with what purport to be'b's for 'beats' actually representing 6s.We get two symbols for the price of one with 'Yellow Submarine' again. Next toLennon's 'mano cornutto' is 'Paul McCartney' creating a '6.' In an alternativepromo shot for the album, meanwhile, 'McCartney' holds two sixes up to botheyes. A very young Michael Jackson was pictured in a promotional shot doing thesign.Contemporary artists seem just as keen on this one, meanwhile. Beyonce put bothher hands into 'sixes' as the camera focused on her at the 2013 Grammy Awards.Jay-Z, Drake, Justin Bieber and Jessie J have all felt the need to show it. Andour old friends the world leaders (puppets) just happen to like this one too,with the Bushes, Obama, Bill Clinton, Benjamin Netanyahu and Tony Blair havingall been pictured with it. As have Jimmy Savile, Rolf Harris and Cliff Richard.But I'm sure that's all just one big coincidence and nothing to worry about.As is the fact that this symbol's popularity is not limited to the 20th and 21stcenturies. There are many ancient depictions of the pagan god Shiva offeringboth this sign, and the 'horned hand' one.THROWING UP THE ROCSWhen it comes to hip-hop, (or what passes for it in the 2010s,) there's anothersymbol that will be familiar to any committed followers of the genre. It's onethat has come to be associated with Jay-Z, and become known as 'the Roc sign.'This one involves creating a triangle, or pyramid shape, by placing the thumbsand first fingers of each hand together. The symbol is placed in front of theface so that the left eye can be viewed through the triangle. All-seeing-eye/third eye symbolism meets Illuminati pyramid symbolism in one easy go. Jay-Z'sown explanation is that it represents the 'rags to riches' aspect of the hip-hopgame; it's the 'Roc, or 'rock,' a diamond symbolising his making it out of theghetto to attain fame and fortune against all the odds. The 'Roc' referencecomes from the name of the record label that Jay-Z founded with fellowentrepreneurs Damon Dash and Kareem 'Biggs' Burke – Roc A Fella Records.If no other aspect of Jay-Z's career path strikes as anyone as suspect, thischoice of moniker should at least raise an eyebrow. It was named after theJewish Rockefeller family which relocated to the United States from Germany inthe 18th century, changing their name from 'Rockenfelder' to sound moreall-American. It was JD Rockefeller, the industrialist, oil tycoon and banker,who put the family's name into the public domain during the early 1900s. TheRockefellers, along with German-Jewish contemporaries the Rothschilds, areconstantly cited as one of the most prominent interbreeding Illuminati bloodlinefamilies. Lurking beneath their public face as 'philanthropists,' theiractivities are said to have involved eugenics, mind control experiments, thefunding of the Nazi party, drug running, whiskey bootlegging, the hijacking andreshaping of the educational and medical establishments in the US, the formationof the US Federal Reserve, the deliberate suppression and outlawing of naturalcures for cancer and, many claim, a direct involvement in the events ofSeptember 11th 2001. Just the folk to name a business empire after, right kids?The sentiment appeared to be shared by Nas in the lyrics of his infamous 'diss'track against Jay-Z, 'Ether.'In recent years the Roc A Fella tag has been phased out, replaced with RocNation as a catch-all name for Jay-Z's various corporate ventures. Just howgrass roots its formation was in the first place remains questionable given thatJay-Z stands as the most blatant example of a fully controlled corporate stoogein the modern music business, his every look, move and sound carefullycultivated in line with a far-reaching agenda. Jay-Z went from years spent as adrug dealer and struggling rapper, to the biggest artist in the game upon therelease of his debut album 'Reasonable Doubt' in 1996, this seemingly miraculousovernight success having been replicated by many rappers in the interveningyears.In a 2009 interview, (which has since been deleted from Youtube and elsewhere onthe web,) Jay-Z gave the following account of having 'invented' the 'Roc' sign:“Well, like I said, we had lofty goals early on. We thought we was gonna put outan album by this group called Christión, and we thought it was gonna go diamond.We thought it was gonna sell 10 million records. So we was doin’ this aslaughing, like, ‘we gonna sell 10 million records. Diamond.’ And then it stuck.We kept doin’ it. Then we started doin’ it at shows.”Despite his protestations, (and Beyonce's subservient flashing of the symbol atpublic events, interpreted as being 'in homage' to her husband's business,) the'Roc' sign, it turns out, is no new thing, and far from a Jay-Z creation. It isknown in mystery school traditions as the Triangle of Manifestation.As with duality, (light and dark, night and day, good and evil, male and female,etc), the concept of the trinity occurs throughout creation. It is therepresentation of mind, body and spirit, or the unity of thoughts, actions andemotions, which, when aligned in balanced unity, lead to the manifestation ofdesired situations. This concept is symbolised in Christianity as 'the father,the son and the holy ghost,' and finds its way into countless myths of theancient world, such as Isis, Osiris and Horus of the Egyptian tradition, andSemiramis, Nimrod and Tammuz of ancient Babylon.The website www.themystica.com [http://www.themystica.com] describes the purposeof the Triangle of Manifestation as follows:\"This is a phase that indicates the principle of magical manifestation. Thisbasic principle is rooted in the number of three. It is a metaphysical beliefthat in order to manifest something, three components must come together. Thesecomponents are time, space, and energy. The functioning of the components issuch that if a time and a space are selected into which energy is directed, amanifestation will occur.\"A convenient method of directing the energy is through a triangle formed withboth hands by placing the tips of the index fingers together while placing boththumbs together with all other fingers extended. This symbolic hand gesture maybe employed in a ritual, chanting, or charging an object.\"So what could Jay-Z and his cohorts be trying to manifest in this way? And whythe need for concealing the truth behind a highly unconvincing cover story?Like the horned hand, the Triangle was used by Anton LaVey in the rituals of theChurch of Satan. It also appears as one of the grade signs of the OTO, or OrdoTempli Orientis, the occult school of ritual magick headed for a time byAleister Crowley, and to which many musicians have belonged. In this context,the 'Roc' sign is said to symbolise 'fire' or 'The Goddess Thoum-aesh-neith.'The same sign is also a symbol of the Levites, one of the original twelve tribesof Israel. And Jay-Z was far from the first in the music industry to use it.Among many others, there exists a picture of original Beatles member StuartSutcliffe striking the 'Roc' sign way back in 1962.Given the nature of the power structure that created the entertainment industry,and its obsession with dark occultism, it's safe to assume there is more goingon than meets the eye with this sign, particularly when the instruction goes outat one of Jay-Z's concerts for the crowd to 'throw up your Rocs'. Tens ofthousands of people all pooling their attention into a symbol simultaneously isgoing to have a significant effect on the energetic field around them.LIVE AND DIRECTIt's large-scale live events that offer another way for the entertainmentindustry to trawl the life energy of the masses using symbology. Such eventshave the benefit of establishing a direct energetic link with the audience. Mostare also televised or recorded for later broadcast, bringing a whole new, andeven greater viewer base on which to have the same effect. In recent years, thelive performances of the most controlled music makers have been getting fardarker and more occultic in nature, causing even those who have no knowledge orinterest in esoteric subjects to comment on some of the more blatant aspects.One of the most extreme was Madonna's half-time performance at the 2013 SuperBowl. The massive attendance aside, this event garners one of the biggest TVaudiences in the world, so any musician performing is guaranteed one of thegreatest opportunities for simultaneous mass mind control in the history ofhumanity. Madonna has long been referred to as 'the Grand Priestess' of themusic industry, meaning that having faithfully served the hand that feeds herfor thirty years, she's now been elevated to a senior position whereby sheoversees more recently recruited artists in a ritualistic fashion. Many havesuggested that this is what her famous kiss with Britney Spears and ChristinaAguilera at the 2003 MTV Video Music awards was all about. In the 2013 SuperBowl, she appeared in the regalia of the ancient Sumerian goddess known asInanna-Ishtar. Evocations of sun symbolism are seen, including the winged solardisk favoured by groups including the Freemasons and Rosicrucians, and there'splenty more ancient Egyptian themology. Subservient to her in this performanceare fellow artists LMFAO, MIA, Nicki Minaj and CeeLo Green, all of whom appearto undergoing some kind of induction.A week before the event, in interview with CNN broadcaster (and CIA asset)Anderson Cooper, Madonna alluded to the esoteric nature of her upcoming show:“The Super Bowl is kind of like the Holy of Holies in America. I’ll come athalfway of the 'church experience' and I’m gonna have to deliver a sermon. It’llhave to be very impactful.”Madonna has openly admitted to her affiliation with Kabbalah, the school ofJewish mysticism, making her choice of wording with 'the Holy of Holies' veryinteresting. This was the name of the most sacred place in Solomon's Temple,access to which was only granted to the High Priest.Interpretations of exactly what the symbols and icons are intended to evoke varyfrom researcher to researcher, and you quickly come to realise that the world ofocculted knowledge is far from clear-cut and easy to navigate. Certainly, manyof the hand signals we now see celebrities routinely use seem to have theirroots in the Indian system of 'mudras,' described by Wikipedia as: \"a spiritualgesture and an energetic seal of authenticity employed in the iconography andspiritual practice of Indian religions.\" The point is that subliminalcommunication is clearly going on, whatever the meaning, and consumers mightlike to ask themselves what relevance any of this has to what is supposed to besimply fun and leisurely entertainment, for the most part aimed at children andyoung adults. Why is it there at all?Vigilant Citizen summed up the 2013 performance as follows:\"When taken individually, the symbols described above can be simply consideredas 'cool-looking,' and most Super Bowl viewers did not give them much attention.The packing of all these signs and symbols into one comprehensive 13-minuteperformance cannot, however, be dismissed as 'random images.' Quite to thecontrary, the combination of all of these symbols form a whole, and define withgreat depth the underlying philosophy and agenda of those in power – theIlluminati.\"Anyone still proclaiming that this was all about Madonna 'expressing herself'and simply being 'artistic' is in a very heavy state of denial about what'sreally going on in this world, I would suggest.A further ritual written off as a 'wardrobe malfunction' was the exposing ofJanet Jackson's nipple during her performance with Justin Timberlake at the 2004Super Bowl show. The cover story is that this was an unscripted accident. The'scandal' dominated international headlines for days, and whenever any seeminglytrivial matter takes precedence over war, famine, corruption and naturaldisasters, it's a safe bet that there's some ritualistic significance to it thatthe powers that be are keen to get out.For an 'accident' it was rather convenient that Janet's nipple just happened tonot be bare, but instead adorned with a 'shield' depicting the rays of the sun.Never miss an opportunity to get some solar cult symbolism into the publicpsyche in that all-important split-second, right?(It's also interesting to note that Spears, Aguilera and Timberlake were allchild stars that emerged simultaneously out of the Mickey Mouse Club of theaforementioned Disney Corporation, and all just happened to go on to becomemassive pop stars at the same time. More of that later.)For those wanting to really immerse themselves in ritualistic occult imagery,meanwhile, no better example presents itself than the opening and closingceremonies of the 2012 London Olympics. It's all there – phoenixes, pyramids,Glastonbury Tor, 'Satanic' mills, a cauldron, a giant baby, a rendition ofWilliam Blake's 'Jerusalem,' the theme from 'The Exorcist' movie, and'revolutionary' Russell Brand, (right on, brother!) seemingly portraying theChild Catcher character from Ian Fleming's 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang,' amongdemonic-looking figures cloaked in black overlooking ranks of children coweringin hospital beds, all occurring weeks before BBC 'entertainer' Jimmy Savile wasexposed posthumously as a serial paedophile that had abused children in hospitalwards. Lovely family-friendly stuff.Fleming, incidentally, the creator of James Bond, was himself attached tomilitary 'intelligence' during World War 2, and was a personal associate ofAleister Crowley in his latter years, and according to some, his handler.Fleming is said to have based the character of Le Chiffre, the first of Bond'sadversaries in the novel 'Casino Royale,' upon Crowley. Backgrounds in military'intelligence' and mystery religion magick – also the case with Flemingcontemporaries Dennis Wheatley and Roald Dahl – are never far from the surfacein these particular stories."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:The Rockefeller bloodline: * http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/the_rockefeller_bloodline.htm [http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/the_rockefeller_bloodline.htm]The Rockefellers at www.thetruthseeker.com [http://www.thetruthseeker.com]: * http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?cat=47 [http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?cat=47]Grade signs of the OTO: * http://www.theorteekstasis.org/oto/pdf/signs.pdf [http://www.theorteekstasis.org/oto/pdf/signs.pdf]Ordo Templi Orientis at Wikipedia: * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordo_Templi_Orientis]Vigilant citizen on Madonna at the 2013 US Superbowl Half Time Show: * http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/madonnas-superbowl-halftime-show-a-celebration-of-the-grand-priestess-of-the-music-industry/ [http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/madonnas-superbowl-halftime-show-a-celebration-of-the-grand-priestess-of-the-music-industry/]Vigilant Citizen on the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2012 LondonOlympics: * http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-occult-symbolism-of-the-2012-olympics-opening-and-closing-ceremonies/ [http://vigilantcitizen.com/vigilantreport/the-occult-symbolism-of-the-2012-olympics-opening-and-closing-ceremonies/]Vigilant Citizen on Jay-Z's occult connections: * http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/jay-zs-run-this-town-and-the-occult-connexions/ [http://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/jay-zs-run-this-town-and-the-occult-connexions/]Freeman of www.freemantv.com [http://www.freemantv.com], on Madonna's 2013 USSuperbowl Half Time show and others: * http://freemantv.com/occult-symbolism-of-madonna-at-superbowl-halftime/ [http://freemantv.com/occult-symbolism-of-madonna-at-superbowl-halftime/]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10BACKWARDS – IT’S THE NEW FORWARDSIn a world of inversion, are true motives hidden in reverse?'Let the adept . . . listen to phonograph records reversed . . . 'Aleister Crowley (1875-1947) from the book 'Magick'It became clear a while back that I'm not really one for supernaturalexperiences. That's not to say I don't accept the existence of alternativerealms beyond this 'physical' world. On the contrary, an understanding of thetrue nature of reality and the infinite possibilities of universal consciousnesshave been fundamental to the process of pulling the different strands of thisbook together. But I seem to have made the choice before I got here to live alife that's very much rooted in the 'real' world, and to knuckle down to whatneeds to be done within it, rather than undergoing some of the fascinatingspiritual experiences that we hear about from others. I've shown myself to benon-hypnotisable, and my curious attempts at a past-life regression merelyresulted in me trawling the depths of my memory and imagination, it seems to mein retrospect, rather than awakening any genuine memories of previous lives.But despite my lack of other-worldly experiences, there are two unexplainedevents that I can point to as personal evidence that this world is not all thatit would seem. One involves a Satanic ritual in Prague which I detail elsewherein the book. The one I'll recount here is an anecdote that's featured quiteheavily in my public talks, and which leads us nicely into the area ofbackmasking, or subliminal messages hidden backwards in sound recordings.A 3AM WAKE-UPI'd heard whisperings of this phenomenon, apparently favoured by heavy metalbands in the 70s and 80s, during my schooldays. In late 1990, it was the subjectof a feature on Channel 4's 'The Word', a programme which revelled in itsreputation for controversy. The piece in question concerned Madonna's single'Justify My Love' which had just been released. It was already raising eyebrowsthrough its sexually explicit video and orgasmic moanings, but 'The Word' addedto this by claiming that, when played backwards, a certain section of the song'slyrics emerge as sounding distinctly like 'hear us, love us, Satan.'I've no idea who first discovers these things or in what circumstances, butapparently someone had. At this time, I was at the end of my first year workingas a general dogsbody at Fox FM, my local commercial radio station in Oxford.Youthfully naive and hungry to make it in the business, I'd been spending all mywaking hours as part of the Fox furniture, doing everything from making tea forthe journalists, to archiving old news stories, to playing out pre-recordedshows live on air. Significantly, this was still in the era of quarter-inchreel-to-reel broadcast tape, in the last years before computers. Having accessto such equipment, when I first heard about the Madonna record, I immediatelysaw the opportunity to try the theory out for myself.At around 3 in the morning one weekend, a time when I could often be foundhanging out in the studios rather than displaying any kind of social life orsleeping, I recorded the track on to a reel of tape, flipped it around, and fedit back on to the machine's spools ready to play in reverse. As I did, it becameapparent which section of the track the TV show had referred to, as the chillingwords 'hear us, love us, Satan' appeared to come from the tape, and were madeall the more chilling by the distorted, non-humanesque quality of the sonics,and the fact that that the only other human in the building was the on-air DJ inthe next studio.Shocked by what I thought I'd just heard, and wanting an ally in the experience,I shot next door and told the DJ there was something he just had to come in andhear. I rewound the tape to the appropriate point, pressed Playand . . . nothing happened. Silence. The tape was completely blank, therecording never to be heard again. I have no explanation for what went on there,but it certainly sent a chill down my spine and I've never been able to listento 'Justify My Love' in the same way since.I recounted this story at a talk in Birmingham recently, and during the break anaudience member came up to me and said, 'you do realise that FOX in EnglishGematria equates to the numbers 666, don't you?,' which I thought added a nicetwist to the anecdote. I've also been reminded that 3am is known as 'thewitching hour' when black magic is thought to have its most potent effects.Over 20 years after the Fox incident, meanwhile, I was fascinated to come acrossa comment on a chat site called Feel Numb, ('useful useless info,') from a userby the name of Raul. He stated: \"I used to be a DJ and remember playing 'JustifyMy Love' by Madonna on the turntables. Every time she sings the line 'justify mylove' in the chorus, all you have to do is spin it backwards and you can clearlyhear the words 'I love Satan.' I will never forget the feeling I had when Ifirst spun this song backwards. Freaked me out!\"Raul, I know what you mean, mate.Researching the song further, I came across an explanation of the remix that wasapparently done by Madonna in conjunction with Lenny Kravitz. This was known as'The Beast Within Mix,' and replaced the verses with passages from the Book ofRevelation. The song first garnered media attention in early 1991 when the SimonWiesenthal Centre accused it of containing 'anti-Semitic' lyrics, specificallythe one that goes \"those who say they are Jews but are not. They are a synagogueof Satan.\"Far more truth to that lyric than might at first be apparent, I would suggest,in the context of some of the stuff covered elsewhere in the book. Either way,it reinforces that there's something special about that particular Madonna song.Perhaps it shouldn't come as too much of a shock, either, given Madonna'slong-standing status as an artist who's shown signs of being subservient to hercorporate masters since her breakthrough. Madonna's stands as an example of thelong career that awaits when you sign a contract with the music industry machine– but one that's always on their terms with no option to say no to whateverdirection they might choose to steer you in some way down the line.BACK ENGINEERINGThere are three general schools of opinion when it comes to subliminalbackmasking. One is that it's a cynical ploy deliberately applied by mischievousmusic-makers to generate attention and controversy. The second is that itrepresents a genuine communication of some message or thought which may havebeen conveyed at a sub-conscious level by the creator of the recording, albeitunwittingly. The third is that it's all a load of bollocks and that if youlisten hard enough, you'll hear anything you want to hear. Sceptics will cite'phonetic reversal,' the effect of a word unintentionally sounding like anotherwhen reversed.It doesn't follow that every single backmasked recording has to fall into onlyone of these categories, of course. All three options remain feasible dependingon the recording in question. The second possibility is the one where mycuriosity lies, and on this front, I was interested to come across thephenomenon of reverse-speech therapy. This is the idea that thoughts or intentsthat are present in an individual's subconscious, but which aren't apparent tothe conscious mind, can embed themselves into that individual's speech patternsin reverse form. This means the messages cannot be recognised by the alert,conscious mind, but can be absorbed subtly by the subconscious mind of thelistener, allowing them to intuit the true thoughts of the person speaking thewords. The subconscious mind does not need to have words and phrases presentedin a linear, front-to-back fashion because, in their base state, all words aresound vibration, decoded into recognisable form by the ear and the brain. It'sthe vibrational patterns of the words that are picked up on.The science of reverse-speech therapy appears to have pioneered by David J Oatesin Australia. The story goes that in 1983, he accidentally dropped a tape playerinto a toilet, and it would only play in reverse from that point on. This led tohim stumbling upon the hidden messages that can be encoded into speech, and onlyproperly understood in reverse. Oates went on to write five books on thesubject, as well as publishing a magazine called 'Backtalk,' lecturing on thesubject, and running training courses in how to become a practitioner. He nowlives in Australia and remains one of its leading proponents. Oates announced inSeptember 2015 that he was starting work on a comprehensive documentary onreverse speech, expected to be released the following year.Another advocate is the clinician and speech analyst Jon Kelly ofwww.yourinnervoice.com [http://www.yourinnervoice.com]. Like Oates, Kellyremains a strong advocate of reverse-speech being a genuine psychological methodof getting to the root of a person's true thoughts and emotions, and devisingappropriate therapy. In his sessions, he gets subjects to speak at length on anysubject of their choosing and records the results. Then begins the discipline oftrawling through the recording in reverse, listening for revealing words andphrases. In his interview with Red Ice Radio's Lana Lokteff in 2013, Kellyincluded recorded examples from some of his therapy sessions. A woman recallingthe tragedy of her little brother being killed by a car when she let go of hishand at a roadside, produced the phrase 'better hold on to him' when reversed.The phrase 'hurry, life is only a lesson' emerged from a small businesswomanreflecting on what her future might hold. Kelly goes on to reveal how thismethod led to him discovering highly confidential aspects of the US's 'shock andawe' programme used in the second Gulf War a full two years before it happened.As he explained: \"The truth will always reveal itself eventually . . . and thisis one venue via which it can be done. But you have to become an activelistener. The messages are encrypted, so you have to get involved in decryptingfirst before you can receive that information.\"You can hear his interview with Lana Lokteff on this link –http://www.redicecreations.com/radio3fourteen/2013/R314-131220.php[http://www.redicecreations.com/radio3fourteen/2013/R314-131220.php]There's more on the phenomenon at this site too – http://reversespeech.com[http://reversespeech.com]/Interestingly, Regan, the character in 'The Exorcist' movie, (based on the truestory of a 1949 exorcism in Georgetown University Hospital, Washington DC,)utters words and phrases in reverse when under the possession of a demonicentity. These can only be consciously deciphered when a tape recording of themis played backwards.Given that this method is said to involve individuals communicating hiddenmessages only fully audible in reverse, therefore, is it too much of a stretchto imagine it might have been at use in popular music recordings through thedecades too? The science of it is certainly amusing to me as a hip-hop DJ whohas spent more hours than I care to remember cleaning up explicit phrases in raptracks to deem them appropriate for radio play. Although there are now moresubtle ways of muting out offending words, all radio edits some years back usedto reverse words like 'fuck', 'shit' and 'nigga,' to transform them into theinoffensive 'cuff', 'ish' and 'uggin.' If the idea of the subconscious mindaccepting phrases in reverse holds true, 'clean' radio edits serve littlepurpose other than to provide an aesthetically pleasing veneer of apparentrespectability!This theory gained some extra notoriety when claims emerged a short while afterBarack Obama's 2008 presidential victory, that one of his famous speeches takeson a different nature when the reversal treatment is applied. Each time hisfamously vacuous 'yes we can' slogan is spoken, in reverse form it becomes'thank you Satan,' according to many independent researchers. As with allthings, each listener must make up their own minds, but I know what it soundslike to me. And when you come to realise that the worldwide cabal that placesall world 'leaders' in place is obsessed with the dark occult, the idea thatsomething could be going on here doesn't sound too preposterous.This could well be by design – if you want to communicate a particular idea inreverse form, it's not that difficult to work out what you need to say inregular form to achieve the effect – or it could be an example of an involuntarycommunication, as a reflection of the dark energy in which Obama and his likeare immersed. Also, Obama is an acknowledged master at NLP, or Neuro LinguisticProgramming, the science of using carefully-chosen words and phrases, deliveredin certain pitches and tones, to generate a desired emotional response in alistener. We hear politicians and television news presenters doing this all thetime, and in the UK, the cosy-sounding continuity announcer on BBC1 uses thetechnique nightly. This being the case, Obama rarely utters a phrase that hasn'tbeen very carefully considered . . . even if someone else has written it andhe's merely delivering it faithfully from the Autocue.Either way, here's a video breaking down the effect: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8g2nCxAVrk [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8g2nCxAVrk]And here it is in briefer soundbite form: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS53I-k_T4o [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS53I-k_T4o]There is also a video making the case for another phrase of Obama's – this timethe repeated words 'let me express' uttered during his presidential acceptancespeech – coming out as 'serve Satan' when the same reverse effect is applied.Catch that one here: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-TMKUea87E [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-TMKUea87E]Either way, this event certainly hit home with Canibus, a rapper whose trickywordplay deems most of what he says incoherent, but who occasionally astoundswith amazingly hard-hitting lyrics. On the title track to his ninth album,'Melatonin Magik', he says:\"Watch who you followin', watch who you praisin''Yes we can' backwards is 'thank you, Satan.\"HEAVY VIBESBackmasking entered the public consciousness in a big way in 1990, in a US civilaction case involving the British heavy metal group Judas Priest. The casealleged that two youths, 20-year-old James Vance and 18-year-old RaymondBellknap, shot themselves as a direct result of hearing a subliminal messagehidden in the song 'Better By You, Better Than Me' from Judas Priest's 1978album 'Stained Class'. The parents and their legal teams claimed that the songcontains the phrase 'do it, do it' when played in reverse, and that the youthshad interpreted this as an instruction to kill themselves in a suicide pact.(Interestingly, Mark Chapman, John Lennon's alleged killer, reported hearingvoices in his head saying 'do it, do it, do it' shortly before he is said tohave pulled the trigger.) The youths went to a church in Sparks, Nevada with a12-gauge shotgun to carry out the deed. Bellknap died instantly after shootinghimself from under the chin. Vance then shot himself but survived, only to dielater in 1988 from related complications.The suit was dismissed in August 1990, when the judge ruled that the allegedmessage was the result of a mix-up of background lyrics. It was also pointed outthat the youths had been drinking and smoking marijuana in the hours leading totheir death, hinting at this as the real contributing factor. The trial wascovered in the 1991 documentary 'Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James VanceVs. Judas Priest'.Predictably, the Christian community of the US has been highly critical ofsubliminal messaging techniques in music, claiming it to be, in their simplisticview of things, the 'work of the devil.' The state governments of Arkansas andCalifornia were successful in passing legislation to this effect. The Californiabill boldly stated that it stood for preventing recordings 'that can manipulateour behaviour without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of theAntichrist.' The 1983 Arkansas bill, meanwhile, recommended that records withbackmasking include the words: 'Warning: This record contains backward maskingwhich may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is playedforward.' This bill was subsequently thrown out by none other than StateGovernor Bill Clinton.Whether there was validity to the claim or not, the case was instrumental ingetting the mainstream public familiar with the suggestion that backmasking inmusic does go on. The satirist Weird Al Yancovic, whose pop parodies haveincluded 'Eat It' and 'Like A Surgeon', got in on the backmasking act when heencoded a gibberish-sounding message on his track 'I Remember Larry'. Whenplayed in reverse it comes out as, 'wow, you must have an awful lot of free timeon your hands.' He had another go on 'Nature Trail To Hell' which contains thephrase 'Satan eats cheese whiz.'A similar spoof treatment came from Pink Floyd on the track 'Empty Spaces' fromthe album 'The Wall.' When an apparently nonsense sequence is played backwards,listeners hear:\"Hello, Luka . . . congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message.Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm,Chalfont . . . Roger! Carolyn’s on the phone! Okay.”TWO PATHS YOU CAN GO BYThe Beatles were well-known for dabbing in backmasking, as mentioned in theearlier chapter. Perhaps the most famous illustration of the practice, though,comes from one of the most celebrated rock tracks in history, Led Zeppelin'sperpetually enigmatic 'Stairway To Heaven' from their un-named fourth album in1971. It was vocalist Robert Plant who penned the lyrics to 'Stairway,'recounting in a later interview: \"Suddenly my hand was writing out thewords . . . \" Guitarist Jimmy Page has also talked of 'channelling' his songs;pulling lyrics and concepts out of the ether as if they're coming from someunknown source. Plenty of other artists, including David Bowie and Elton John,have talked of using the same process.Surprisingly, Led Zeppelin's Wikipedia page addresses the accusation of'Stairway' containing a backward Satanic message. This occurs during the middlesection in the lyrics, \"If there’s a bustle in your hedgerow, don’t be alarmednow. It’s just a spring clean for the May Queen. Yes, there are two paths youcan go by, but in the long run, there’s still time to change the road you’reon.\" When played backwards, this is said to come out as:\"Oh here’s to my sweet Satan,The one whose little path would make me sad, whose power is Satan,He will give those with him 666,There was a little tool shed where he made us suffer, sad Satan.”The website www.remnantradio.org [http://www.remnantradio.org], in its sectiontitled 'Rock Music and Witchcraft,' elaborated further, stating:\"The song also used a process known as 'backward masking,' which is accomplishedwhen a phrase is recorded on tape, played backwards, then recorded again on themaster tape. One segment which says: 'Yes there are two paths you can go by, butin the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on. And it makesme wonder . . . ' played in reverse, says: 'There's no escaping it, oh, it's mysweet Satan, the one whose path makes me sad, whose power is Satan.' Other partsof the song, when played in reverse, say: 'I live for Satan,' 'The Lord turns meoff,' 'Here is to my sweet Satan,' 'There's power in Satan,' and 'Take the 666.\"This aspect of the song was first brought to light on a 1982 US TV programme onthe Christian Trinity Broadcasting Network. Even more surprisingly, Led Zep'sWikipedia page actually contains audio snippets of this section of the song inboth forward and reverse formats, allowing listeners to judge the matter forthemselves.Unsurprisingly, the band themselves have always refuted the claims. Swan SongRecords, Zeppelin's own label, issued the blunt statement: 'Our turntables onlyplay in one direction – forwards.' In a 1983 interview with 'Musician' magazine,Robert Plant stated: \"To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway to Heaven' waswritten with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and puttingmessages on the end, that's not my idea of making music.\"(Led Zep removed any ambiguity when it came to the lyrics for their later song'Houses Of The Holy', however, which included the lyrics: \"From the houses ofthe holy, we can watch the white doves go, from the door comes Satan's daughter,and it only goes to show. You know.\" And: \"Let the music be your master. Willyou heed the master's call? Oh . . . Satan and man.\")It's interesting to note that one of the famous quotes of Aleister Crowley, acharacter who, like the invincible Blofeld in the James Bond movies, has a habitof popping up spontaneously through these stories, was: 'Let him train himselfto think backwards.' This doctrine was known as The Law Of Reversal. An extractfrom Crowley's book 'Magick' reads:“Let the adept . . . train himself to think backwards by external means, as setforth here following. 1. Let him learn to write backwards . . . 2. Let him learn to walk backwards . . . 3. Let him . . . listen to phonograph records reversed . . . 4. Let him practise speaking backwards . . . 5. Let him learn to read backwards . . .”It's said that in many Satanic churches the congregation will recite 'The Lord'sPrayer', but start with 'Amen' and say 'Nema' and then progress in reverse.The same concept of inversion was portrayed when the Nazis took the ancientsymbol of life, the sun, power and good luck that it twisted into its Swastika,imbuing it with its own malevolent intent as it did, and totally subverting itsoriginal meaning. We live in an upside-down world full of contradictions where,when world leaders publicly announce one thing, it's in the exact reverse ofwhat they say that the truth lies. So when Barack Obama announces that 'Americastands for peace, freedom and justice', it kinda speaks for itself. Just thesame as when David Cameron announces that there'll be no new taxes.Given the Satanic practices which are inherently linked to the corporate musicindustry then, and bearing in mind the claims of Jon Kelly and others thatbackwards messages give away the true intentions of those uttering them, perhapsit's not too outrageous to assume that there could be some validity tobackmasking after all?"},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Ten famous cases of backmasking: * http://listverse.com/2011/08/28/top-10-famous-cases-of-backmasking/ [http://listverse.com/2011/08/28/top-10-famous-cases-of-backmasking/]Wikipedia entry on the phenomenon of backmasking (including Led Zeppelin'Stairway To Heaven' soundbites): * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backmasking]David J Oates' website: * http://davidoates.com [http://davidoates.com]Jon Kelly's website: * www.yourinnervoice.com [http://www.yourinnervoice.com]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11ALL IN THE MINDMK-Ultra and its evil mind-control cousins.\"The more we do to you, the less you seem to think we're doing it\"Nazi doctor Josef Mengele\"In the technetronic (sic) society, the trend seems to be toward effectivelyexploiting the latest communication techniques to manipulate emotions andcontrol reason. Human beings become increasingly manipulated and malleable.\"Zbigniew Brzezinski in 'Between Two Ages: America's Role In The TechnetronicEra' (1970)CLOCKWORK ORANGESWhen Britney Spears shaved off her hair in a salon in February 2007 beforeattacking a car with an umbrella, the public reaction was the same as it alwaysis when a celeb 'goes a bit crazy.' Comments seen on-line and heard around thewater cooler go along the lines of: 'What is it with these celebrities? Theyhave fame and fortune and all the money in the world, and they just go off therails. Why do they all act that way?'There's a very good reason why so many famous people act in erratic,unpredictable and just plain bizarre ways, and it has nothing to do with themoney and fame going to their heads. The reason is one that will shock to thecore anyone hearing it for the first time, and probably bring about instantdismissal on the grounds that 'it can't possibly be true.' The evidence,however, tells a different story. Welcome to the dark and very ugly world oftrauma-based mind-control.The manipulation of the human mind by force is something that has been practicedfor aeons. As an article on Monarch Programming on the Vigilant Citizen websiteexplains:\"Throughout the course of history, several accounts have been recordeddescribing rituals and practices resembling mind-control. One of the earliestwritings giving reference to the use of occultism to manipulate the mind can befound in the Egyptian 'Book of the Dead'. It is a compilation of rituals,heavily studied by today’s secret societies, which describes methods of tortureand intimidation, (to create trauma,) the use of potions (drugs,) and thecasting of spells (hypnotism,) ultimately resulting in the total enslavement ofthe initiate. Other events ascribed to black magic, sorcery and demonpossession, (where the victim is animated by an outside force,) are alsoancestors of Monarch Programming.\"One of the most widely-documented methods of mind-control, with a reputation sonotorious that many members of the public have heard of it, is known asMK-Ultra. This was a covert operation spawned by the CIA at the time of itsmutation from the Office of Strategic Services at the end of the Second WorldWar, and it involved a number of prominent scientists from Nazi Germany. Ratherthan facing trial for crimes against humanity as they should have done, manywere covertly smuggled into the US to be put to work in laboratories continuingthe work that had reportedly been done in the concentration camps. The codenamefor the project was Operation Paperclip. Whether these Nazis were blackmailedinto co-operation with the threat of imprisonment or execution if they refused,or whether they were co-opted on more friendly terms, remains open to debate.Either way, the US Establishment was very interested in exploiting many of thetechniques that they had perfected.So, along with rocket scientists like Wernher von Braun who were put to work ona space programme that became NASA, notorious psychopaths such as Dr. JosefMengele were recruited to start moulding and rewiring the minds of selectedAmericans like never before. The MK-Ultra programme took its name from thephrase mind kontrolle as an homage to its German roots, and its far-reachingexperiments ran through the 1950s and beyond. Inevitably, some leakage of itssecrets got out, and by the 1970s, many Americans had heard rumours of theprogramme and some of what it entailed. A CIA memo from 1952 which was leakedyears later and made publicly available stated: 'The aim is controlling anindividual to the point where he will do our bidding against his will, and evenagainst such fundamental laws of nature as self-preservation.' The same methodsof experimentation were known by various names in the early days, such asOperation Bluebird and Operation Artichoke. Another aspect of MK-Ultra involvedexperimentation with mind-altering drugs on a mass scale, which was what thecontrolled explosion of LSD on to the hippie/ counter-culture scene of the late1960s was all about.This led to a public admission by then-CIA director Richard Helms in 1973 thatit had been running a mind-control programme in the two decades previous, butthe Agency claimed it had now been terminated. In what was presumably a publicrelations exercise, on 3rd August 1977, the 95th US Congress opened hearingsinto the reported abuses concerning MK-Ultra. It was alleged that most of therecords pertaining to previous experiments had by that point been destroyed. Asevidence has shown, however, this was not the case and the hearings were merelyan exercise in damage-limitation to placate the public. The Agency had now beenforced into guarding its activities much more carefully.One purpose of the MK-Ultra technique was to create assassins, for deployment insituations useful to the US government, and who would remain undetectable untiltheir programming was activated. This theme has been the basis of manymainstream movies over the decades. The best example is the Bourne trilogystarring Matt Damon as an asset of a top secret CIA black operation known as'Treadstone.' He spends the movies trying to recall why he possesses certainmental and physical skills that he can remember nothing about, and why hisformer employers are now trying to kill him and cover up all evidence of theprogramme of which he was a part. As with so many Hollywood movies, I wouldsuggest there's a great deal of truth to what at first appears to be a wildlyfar-fetched plot. One of the very reasons for placing these depictions intoworks of popular culture is so that anyone seeking to claim that this subject isvery real, can be scoffingly dismissed as delusional with lines like 'I thinkyou've been watching too many movies mate. Maybe you should get out more!'(Doubtless followed by 'lol' if the comment is delivered on-line.)Two of the best examples of individuals strongly suspected to be MK-Ultraprogrammed assassins are Sirhan Sirhan, said to have shot Senator Robert Kennedyin 1968, and Mark David Chapman, credited with having shot John Lennon, (thoughmore on this in a later chapter!) I can't help thinking there's somethingdevastatingly symbolic about Sirhan being Palestinian and being framed formurder by a network heavily connected to the Zionist regime of Israel, the USand elsewhere. Both are still serving endless jail terms for their 'crimes',with appeals for parole being consistently overturned, and both have maintainedthat they have no memory of what they are said to have done. There are alsostrong suggestions that JFK 'murderer' Lee Harvey Oswald was under the sameinfluence before he was conveniently disposed of by club owner, mobster and CIAasset Jack Ruby, (real name Jacob Rubenstein.) Few now swallow the official linethat Oswald acted as a lone assassin in killing JFK. But researchers into theRFK and Lennon murders have suggested that both Sirhan and Chapman were also'patsies,' programmed to provide the distraction of appearing to shoot theirtargets, whereas in fact the fatal bullets were fired from elsewhere. In thisscenario the public gets a ready-made scapegoat to satisfy their appetite forjustice, and a mind-controlled patsy rots away in jail for the rest of theirdays while the real killers slip back into the shadows. There are reports of awoman in a distinctive polka-dot dress appearing then vanishing at the scene ofthe RFK murder, leading many to surmise that this may have been a kind ofmind-control trigger for Sirhan.In Sirhan's case, he's said to have developed an uncanny ability to tell thetime accurate to within a minute, without any access to a clock – a possibleside-effect of his programming having opened up an extra-sensory ability in hismind?In 2011, British illusionist Derren Brown presented a TV programme entitled 'TheAssassin' on the UK's Channel 4 as part of a series called 'The Experiments.' Itinvestigated the phenomenon of MK-Ultra-style mind-control techniques, withBrown revealing that this was a very real scheme at the hands of the CIA. Brownattempted to demonstrate how the programming could be achieved, citing SirhanSirhan as a case in point. For this, he hypnotised a member of the public, andcoerced him into 'shooting' a celebrity, which turned out to be British'comedian' (it says here) Stephen Fry. The subject fired what he fully believedto be a loaded gun, (but which was a replica firing blanks,) at a complicit Fryas he spoke on a public stage. Afterwards, he claimed no memory of what he haddone. Given that Brown's shows normally take a disparaging tone towards anythingvaguely conspiratorial, it was truly incredible to see the subject ofmind-controlled assassins supported with credible evidence on peak-timemainstream TV, and it remains baffling how this was approved by seniormanagement. (Brown also denies a belief in anything supernatural, and is astrong vocal supporter of Richard Dawkins and his atheistic world view. Giventhat Brown can clearly read peoples' minds and apparently predict or 'see' thefuture, I feel there could be more to his understanding of the true nature ofreality than he's letting on. Maybe that's the kind of public statement you haveto routinely make in order to retain a contract with a mainstream televisionoutlet like Channel 4?)A movie depiction of such MK-Ultra techniques was 'The Manchurian Candidate,'released in 1962 starring Laurence Harvey and Frank Sinatra, (and subject of aninferior remake – aren't they always? – in 2004 starring Denzel Washington andLiev Schreiber.) Harvey plays a US soldier returning from action in the KoreanWar but who, it turns out, had first been captured by the enemy and taken to afacility in Manchuria in Communist China, where he and others had beenprogrammed to become enemy assassins. His mind-controlled alter-ego is triggeredwhenever he sees the Queen of Diamonds playing card.The subject also cropped up in a 1977 Don Siegel-directed movie entitled'Telefon' starring Charles Bronson and Lee Remick. The plot, based on a book byWalter Wager, involves the Soviet Union placing a number of deep-cover 'sleeper'agents in key positions all over the US. The film reveals that the agents haveundergone brainwashing and are entirely unaware of their sabotage missions,until their programme is activated by hearing a code phrase from a poem,followed by their given name, delivered via a telephone call. The agents thencommit suicide after completing their mission.MK-Ultra actually appears by name in the Richard Donner-directed 1997 movie'Conspiracy Theory.' This stars Mel Gibson as the titular character, a taxidriver called Jerry Fletcher who doubles as one of those batshit-crazyconspiracy theorists that the mainstream loves to mock so much, (you know,because there couldn't possibly be powerful people colluding to control everyoneelse in a world so full of fairness, peace and justice such as this, couldthere?) Gibson's character is made wide-eyed and neurotic, casting him in a verydifferent light to his sex-symbol image from the 'Lethal Weapon' films. Jerryshares his concerns with a lawyer played by Julia Roberts. Soon his wildramblings appear to have foundation as he's kidnapped and tortured by a CIAscientist played by Patrick Stewart, who later reveals to Roberts the existenceof the programme known as MK-Ultra, and that Gibson had been an earlyexperimental subject. The movie's narrative claims that the programme wasterminated in 1973. Stewart states that \"MK-Ultra was science, sanctioned by thegovernment. But it all ended the moment John Hinckley shot Ronald Reagan. Thatwasn't us . . . but the technology had been stolen.\"The propaganda that this movie successfully achieved was demonstrated to meshortly after I 'woke up' and started posting conspiracy-related articles onFacebook. A long-time DJ associate of mine suggested to me that I'd lost theplot, adding 'have you actually seen Mel Gibson in 'Conspiracy Theory?')Movies such as this, made in full knowledge of the effect they will have, do nofavours to those genuinely attempting to expose hidden truths about this world.It's notable that Jerry's apparently incoherent ramblings to his passengers atthe start of the film all concern subjects that are provably genuine, ratherthan any 'theory' – fluoride being added to water supplies to make peopledocile, the existence of US militia groups and 'black' helicopters, manipulatedearthquakes, the fact that George HW Bush was a 33rd degree freemason, theagenda to microchip the population, the existence of The New World Order. Thefact that these subjects are addressed in a work of fiction, by a characterpresented as mentally compromised, serves to discredit their validity in theminds of those who take everything Hollywood and the television industry givesthem at face value, and who can't be bothered to do any independent research oftheir own.There are also allusions to mind-control in Stanley Kubrick's 'A ClockworkOrange'. Kubrick was an insider who carried a great deal of knowledge about theelite secret societies and their workings, and encoded aspects of it into allhis movies from 1962's 'Lolita' (which depicted elite paedophilia,) onward. In'A Clockwork Orange,' Malcolm McDowell's violent sociopathic character issedated into a barely functioning automaton by a series of mind-control andpsychological experiments. Kubrick's screenplay was based on the novel byAnthony Burgess who is said to have worked covertly for British 'intelligence'services, with a special interest in the area of mind-control. Reportedly, MickJagger was originally considered for the McDowell role.It's not just as government-sanctioned assassins that CIA mind-controltechniques have been rolled out in the decades since World War 2, however. Theyalso have a very firm place in the entertainment industry – in Hollywood movies,in the worlds of television, fashion and sport, and of course, in music.MIND GAMESTrauma-based mind-control depends on a deep understanding of the workings of thehuman psyche, and how to manipulate it. Robbing someone of their own mindthrough the application of terrifying trauma is one of the sickest, mostdepraved things one human being can do to another, and it beggars belief thathumanity can have been degraded to these depths. Regrettably it has, as a wealthof fact-based evidence shows, and however tempting it may be to turn away fromthis whole area on the grounds that it's just too horrific or 'negative' tocontemplate, that type of reaction will only serve to ensure its continuation,and the suffering of ever more victims. Those who remain in ignorance and thosewho refuse to look at it are giving the controllers exactly the type of reactionthey want and need. Only by seeking to expose these activities, and gaining anunderstanding of what goes on and why, does human decency stand any chance ofseeing these horrors brought to an end.As well as the application of mind-altering drugs, it works – as the titlesuggests – by exposing the subject to extreme levels of trauma. This can involvephysical torture, rape, the application of electroshock and sensory deprivation,and exposure to horrific sights, such as the witnessing of an animal, child oradult being murdered. The original German scientists had discovered that thehuman mind finds such terror so utterly overwhelming, that it resorts to a kindof firewalling function to block it out. The mind does this by fracturing, or'shattering' into multiple compartments, creating a kind of honeycomb effect. Bysplitting itself into these different compartments, the conscious mind is ableto block out the ability to acknowledge the trauma which it has found sounsettling. The process is referred to as 'dissociating' from reality, and thevictims as suffering from 'dissociative identity disorder' (DID.)The perpetrators had then discovered that each of these compartments of the mindcould be individually programmed, and given their own personality and set offalse memories, entirely independent of the others. Each compartment is referredto as an 'alter,' (because its perception of reality has been altered.) In asuccessfully-programmed subject, there is a 'front alter,' which is the everydaypersonality that other people engage with, and which is taken to be theindividual's true character. Beyond the front alter, however, lie all theothers. Each can be brought out to temporarily replace the front alter bywhatever has been programmed to be the trigger. This can be a key word orphrase, a piece of music, or a colour or visual pattern. Each alter remainsunaware of the existence of the others. When each alter is sent back into thedeep recesses of the subconscious mind and the front alter is brought forward toreplace it, the memories and characteristics go with them. Another phrase forpeople exhibiting these symptoms is Multiple Personality Disorder.The Irish author and researcher Thomas Sheridan expanded on the effects ofmind-control experiments in an interview with Lou Collins on People's InternetRadio in October 2014:\"The MK-Ultra programme was initially discovered by the Nazis in World War 2.People that they had in labour camps used to develop alternate personalities, sothey could actually do the most horrific things on behalf of the SS. Dr. JosefMengele discovered this, and that's why he was so interested in twins, becausehe was trying to develop dissociation in the twin, to see if he could switch thepersonalities from one into the other.\"What they discovered under the MK-Ultra programme in Canada – and they did itthere so that Americans could be taken up there and experimented on outside theremit of the US Constitution and the Bill of Rights . . . some of the storiesthat came out of there were quite horrible. There was one of a woman who hadpost-natal depression and she was locked in a room, and they just played a tape24 hours a day while she was on drugs, that just said 'kill yourself, killyourself, kill yourself' over and over. And what they discovered was, when thehuman brain is put into this extreme trauma, dissociation happens. And what thatbasically means is a partition of the human brain is created where the traumadoesn't exist, and they go permanently into that in order to block out thetrauma. Then they discovered that if they needed the subject to do something,like kill someone for instance, they could use that trigger word or phrase, suchas the 'kill yourself', and it would throw them right back into that state ofderangement that they were experiencing.\"One of the leading authorities on the application of trauma-based mind-controlis the American author, researcher and counsellor Fritz Springmeier. His keyworks have been the books 'Bloodlines of the Illuminati' and 'The IlluminatiFormula Used to Create an Undetectable Total mind-controlled Slave', written inconjunction with Monarch Programming survivor Cisco Wheeler. Springmeier workswith deprogramming and rehabilitating former mind-controlled slaves. In 2003, hewas jailed for his alleged involvement in an armed bank robbery, eventuallygetting released in March 2011. Just happening to get charged and jailed for acrime right at the time you've started to expose great secrets about theEstablishment does tend to offer some validation that you might just be on tosomething, I would suggest. Either that or it's just another of those wildcoincidences that seem to occur so regularly.Springmeier's work has exposed how MK-Ultra derivatives have been used toprogramme women as submissive sex slaves for the rich and powerful. Thistechnique is known as Beta Programming, with Marilyn Monroe as its icon. Marilynwas the original archetypal sex kitten, which is why so many celebrities fromMadonna to Anna Nicole Smith are seen emulating her image. (Comments that alwaysused to accompany Madonna in her early career along the lines of: 'she's so incontrol, she so knows what she wants' seem laughable in the context of whatwe're now able to know concerning mind-controlled artists, since she is almostcertainly a prototype example.) A common symbol of Beta Programming isleopard-print, or other feline designs. This claim was backed up by CathyO'Brien in her famous book 'Trance-Formation of America,' in which she talksabout being used as a mind-controlled sex slave for George HW Bush, Dick Cheney,Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and Hillary Clinton, among others.Springmeier has also done much to show how many of the household-namecelebrities that we see and hear every day – mainly those in the US – will haveundergone mind-control. He related some aspects of this in my 'Good Vibrations'podcast interview with him in 2013:\"The people in charge of things want to make sure that anyone in the public eye,who is an icon, is controlled so that they don't spill the beans about thecontrollers and what's going on, or say something that they wouldn't want said.So your movie stars, your iconic big rock stars, these big musicians, they'revictims of the mind-control. But not only that, they're perpetrators too.They'll have a dual role. Basically, the UK and the USA are mind-control labs.\"The easiest way to say it is, if someone is famous and is in the limelight,they have gotten there because the World Order put them there. Some of themdon't even have talent. I mean, Paris Hilton in my opinion is neither pretty nortalented! She's obviously an Illuminati programmed multiple. So if somebody getsup there like that, it's a fairly safe assumption that they're a programmedmultiple.\"It may surprise many to know that British researcher and author David Icke,although not the obvious go-to choice on the subject, is very well-informed onthe manipulations of the music industry and the use of mind-controlled artistswithin it. As he related to me when I interviewed him for my very first 'GoodVibrations' in late 2011:\"It's very clear that major music artists, and famous actors and actresses inHollywood, are a part of this whole mind-control operation. It's so widespread.One of the reasons they do this is, this control system is itself controlled bya force, a mentality, that is terrified of things it cannot call. It talks inits own writings about how maverick people are its biggest enemy, becausemaverick people, they're flowing with life, they're ad-libbing life. They don'tknow what they're doing next, never mind anyone else. And this mentality of thecontrol system cannot cope with that.\"To use an analogy, it could not watch a football match in anything but ashaking, traumatic state unless, before the kick-off, it controlled both sidesand the referee and therefore knew what the score was going to be before thegame started. And they use mind-controlled people a lot for that reason. Thereare no mavericks in there because they haven't got control of their own mind. Sothey're entirely predictable.\"This would explain why there are now virtually no truly maverick artists – atleast signed to any of the major corporations – who make any kind of individualartistic statements through their music. We've seen their like in the past – andit's doubtless a mere coincidence that the most politically and sociallyoutspoken of them just happen to have died before their time – but where are theJohn Lennons, Bob Marleys and Marvin Gayes of today's scene? Populating theindustry with mind-controlled stooges who remain 'on script' is a surefire wayof making sure any mass social engineering agenda doesn't get derailed andcontinues to go to plan.The website Vigilant Citizen has, in recent years, published many excellentarticles detailing the symbolism that depicts mind-control, now being routinelyplaced in the videos of A-list music artists. Exactly the same symbols can beseen in advertisements, in movies and TV shows, and at major public events suchas the Grammys, the MTV Awards and the Super Bowl half-time show, taking thingsway beyond the realms of 'coincidence.' It has become abundantly clear that theforces controlling the entertainment industry, as part of their dark religion,feel the need to encode what they're doing into works of popular culture in theform of signs and symbols which can be readily absorbed by the subconsciousmind.The meaning of these archetypal symbols stays below the threshold of theconscious mind, meaning that what they convey is never properly computed. Butthey continue to work away having a subliminal effect. The reason they feel theneed to let us know what's going on – albeit in this underhand and deviousmanner – is all to do with the universal concepts of consent and free will. Thisis a very far-reaching subject area which we'll get into in the next chapter,and which I would urge all readers to take a look at in order to understand thefull picture. But for now, suffice to say that it's very important for themanipulators to reveal their methods. What they're also doing is conducting aform of magic which requires the participation of both the practitioner and awatching audience, in order to be fully effective.CRASHING SYMBOLSThere is a division of MK-Ultra known as Monarch Programming which dealsspecifically with trauma-based methods. This appears to be the one that mostaffected celebrities have been subject to and is named after the Monarchbutterfly, which has very distinct orange colouring. One explanation for this isthat the dissociative mental states brought about by the programming causes akind of metamorphosis similar to that of a larva turning into a butterfly in thechrysalis. Fritz Springmeier goes further in his observations:\"The concept is that the Monarch butterfly was one of the first scientificexamples of how knowledge is passed from one generation to another. The Monarchwill pass on to the next generation directions for where to fly, and this wouldhappen during a shift. This was very important for the programmers because theyneed the children they programme to dissociate, and they discovered the abilityto become a multiple personality is something that's passed from one generationto another. Which is why they have to keep this trauma-based mind-control withindissociative bloodlines. And the Illuminati have been traumatising their ownkids for thousands of years. But in modern times, the programme has beenbroadened out to regular members of the population.\"A further explanation for the naming came from Ron Patton in the book 'ProjectMonarch':“When a person is undergoing trauma induced by electroshock, a feeling oflight-headedness is evidenced; as if one is floating or fluttering like abutterfly. There is also a symbolic representation pertaining to thetransformation or metamorphosis of this beautiful insect: from a caterpillar toa cocoon, (dormancy, inactivity), to a butterfly, (new creation,) which willreturn to its point of origin. Such is the migratory pattern that makes thisspecies unique.”As Vigilant Citizen has pointed out, Monarch Programming has a number of symbolsattached to it. It is evoked by many images relating to childhood. The majorityof mind-control victims undergo trauma from a very early age while their naturalpersonality is still being shaped. These symbols are said to represent theinnocence and purity of childhood which is shattered when children aretraumatised. Dolls and teddy bears with severed limbs, such as a broken arm, ora missing eye, (remember the BBC's Pudsey Bear?!) are also key icons in thisregard, symbolising the helplessness child victims feel when being abused –often by their own fathers. Unfathomably sick, huh? Shattered mirrors are oftenfeatured, representing the shattered components of the mind. Rainbows, and thecolour pink are very much associated with this method, too.The US researcher Freeman expanded on the significance of the teddy bear motifin an article for his freemantv.com [http://freemantv.com] site:\"The Teddy Bear is used in mind-control as a symbol of your helplessness. Adrugged-out, one-eyed teddy bear is beyond the concept of the message given tochildren by Satanic Ritual Abusers when they defile their most treasuredpossession. This lovable stuffed bear is turned into a constant reminder of themolestation the child has suffered. If it can happen to Teddy . . . \"All of these icons have been showing up with incredible regularity in the musicvideos of leading US pop artists, in most cases, having absolutely nothing to dowith the subject matter of the song. Among the artists whose names crop up themost are Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Britney Spears, Ke$ha, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, TheBlack Eyed Peas and Kanye West. Exactly the same imagery also appears in videosfrom prominent artists in the 'J-pop' and 'K-pop' scenes of Japan and Korea,showing that this truly is a international agenda, with the entertainmentindustries of countries all over the world having their strings pulled by thesame dark masters.There are very few examples of British artists being presented in this way, butone exception is Jessie J. The video to her breakthrough single 'Price Tag'starts straight off with the image of a teddy bear with a missing eye and asevered arm. It goes on to depict Jessie as an ornamental ballerina doll, insidea toy doll's house, as a puppet on a string, clutching a one-eyed broken doll,and with a fractured leg complete with animal print. It couldn't be more blatantif it beat you savagely around the head with a baseball bat with the words'mind-control' on it. Jessie studied at The BRIT School for Performing Arts andTechnology in Croydon, which has spawned a massive array of successful Britishpop artists. 'Price Tag' elevated her from obscurity to international stardomvirtually overnight. It just happened to have been co-written and produced byone 'Dr. Luke.' More on this individual later in the chapter.These are only a handful of a great many examples which are all broken down indetail at http://vigilantcitizen.com/category/musicbusiness[http://vigilantcitizen.com/category/musicbusiness]/Interestingly, there are occasional depictions of these same images fromprevious decades too. Rock lore has it that Pink Floyd's original singer SydBarrett went insane after years of erratic behaviour, supposedly as a result ofLSD and other substance abuse in his youth. His father was a prominentpathologist and he was said to have been related to the celebrated Englishphysician Elizabeth Garrett Anderson. It may be relevant to note that Barrett'sfather was connected to Cambridge University, an institution which, along withthe Tavistock Institute, is said to be used for mind-control and socialengineering experimentation. On the compilation album 'An Introduction To SydBarrett,' he's pictured wearing a mask, kneeling in front of a mirror which he'stouching, and flanked by a couple of teddy bears.On the cover of the album 'Brilliant Corners' by jazz musician Thelonious Monk,meanwhile, there are five clones of Monk all pictured together, as if in akaleidoscopic mirror image. Could this be hinting at multiple personalitydisorder? An interesting aside about Monk is that, against all the odds, he wasinvolved in a long-term relationship to an heiress of the Rothschild bankingdynasty, Pannonica Rothschild, known socially as 'Nica.'In some cases, it may well be that artists are having their fame exploited asvehicles for disseminating mind-control symbolism without necessarily beingvictims of the practice themselves. Evidence of programming is certainly easierto spot in certain artists than in others.GAGA BY NAME . . . Lady Gaga's persona is of course entirely manufactured. I can recall first beingtold about her towards the end of 2007 when someone said, 'she's going to be thenext big thing.' How it could it be known that she was going to be the next bigthing if artists and songs get to the top purely by merit of how good they are,and how much the public chooses to support them? They don't. Artists arepre-selected and groomed by the industry, and placed at the top of the game asrequired. In the same way that presidents and prime ministers aren't elected,they're selected, so it is with A-list artists. It's not by merit of theirartistic talent that musicians rise to the top – certainly not in the 2010sanyway – but by a measure of how willing they are to be completely manipulatedand puppeteered by The Hidden Hand. Public opinion is irrelevant since mostconsumers sadly follow whatever puppets they're given and are told are 'the nextbig thing' without exercising any kind of discernment on their part.It appears that the Lady Gaga personality was in fact stolen from another artistnamed Lina Morgana, and 'given' to Stefani Germanotta through which to re-inventherself. Some multiple personality overtones start to emerge here. (The Gagaidentity itself is said to have been inspired by Queen's hit song 'Radio Gaga,'of which Germanotta was apparently a fan, but given the infestation ofmind-control in the music industry, the 'gaga' bit could be seen to carry adifferent connotation.)Lina Morgana was a fast-rising teen pop star, with whom a young StefaniGermanotta collaborated in New York City as a dancer, songwriter and backingsinger. The relationship came to a sudden end in October 2008, when Morgana fellto her death from a Staten Island hotel room window in what was reported as yetanother 'suicide.'A few weeks later, Lady Gaga suddenly burst on to the pop scene as 'the next bigthing,' with the distinctive image, sound, songs and persona all intact.Immediately, however, there were accusations that Germanotta had effectively'stolen' not only the personality, but also the soul of her former collaborator,not least from Morgana's mother Yana, who told the NY Post:\"I'm doing this because I want to keep her spirit alive. Lady Gaga is holdingLina’s soul, and I want her soul to be free. Every other word she says is fromLina. She talks about having a dark and tragic life, but she had everything shewanted in the world. She went to (the same) high school as Nicky Hilton, herparents were rich. But Lina did have a tough life, and she often talked abouther tragic life.\"The journalist Richard Evans observed:\"Lina's professionally-shot portfolio shows she was corrupt as hell anyway. Itwas just a case of which witch would be Satan's favourite. Her association withGaga was during Stefani's 'experimental' phase – lots of orgies and drugs.Stefani became Gaga and her career took off one month after Morgana's death.\"Morgana's death seems to be evoked in the video for Gaga's 'Paparazzi.' In it,Gaga is seen being thrown off a balcony, from where she tumbles in a spiralfashion until she hits the ground. The camera then pans in on a life-sizemanikin in her place with its limbs all twisted – another strong symbol of amind-control victim.As if to publicly announce that she was fully down with the industry's sick,Satanic rituals, Gaga's perfume range, 'Fame,' was revealed to contain fragrancenotes of blood and semen among its ingredients. The blood traces were said to bebased on Gaga's own to create, as she put it, 'a sense of having me on yourskin.' The liquid is black whilst in the bottle, but turns invisible upon beingsprayed. The symbolism speaks volumes as to the dark occult priest class thatshe serves.NICKI AND ROMANAnother text-book example would be Nicki Minaj, whose entire persona gives somany in-your-face indications of programming that it's difficult to know whereto start. Let's make the starting point the fact that she openly slips in andout of multiple personalities in public, and makes no attempt to hide it. Duringinterviews, she will often start speaking in a different voice and accent.Listeners find this a source of great amusement, having no idea of what islikely going on just below the surface. One of her favourite alter-egos is the'British girl,' where she will begin speaking in a London society accent. Theinteresting thing is that Minaj is not the only US celeb to slip into 'Britishgirl' mode. Mariah Carey has frequently used the same accent in interviews, ashas Britney Spears. Britney even went so far as to record the hook to her numberone single 'Scream And Shout' in the very same British accent. Fans worldwidecommented on how cute and funny she sounded, not realising that 'Scream AndShout' is an extremely dark song that mocks the world of mind-controlled slaves.The refrain 'I'm gonna scream and shout and let it all out' is taken to be areference to the mental anguish a victim experiences, and the fact that whenthey feel the need to scream and shout and let it all out, there's unlikely tobe anyone around to either hear or believe them. Also featured on the song isBlack Eyed Peas frontman Will.I.Am, pictured at one point in the video with aMonarch butterfly, suggesting he too is a programmed multiple. Given that threevery prominent artists all randomly slip into the same accent and persona, is itpossible that 'the British girl' is a standard alter in the case of programmedfemales?Minaj is also notable for having regularly slipped into an identity she refersto as 'Roman Zolanski,' obviously in reference to the paedophile film directorRoman Polanski. She claims her Zolanski is an orange-haired homosexual male. Shemakes no secret of hiding the fact that she has 'become' Roman in her interviews– again, usually a great source of amusement for both the interviewer and theaudience who are absolutely clueless as to what they're really a part of.(Interestingly, Roman is also the name of the chief Satanist played by SidneyBlackmer in Polanski's movie 'Rosemary's Baby.')In an interview with MTV prior to the release of her second album, 'Pink Friday:Roman Reloaded,' Minaj warned the audience to get ready for the Roman Zolanskicharacter:\"If you're not familiar with Roman, then you will be familiar with him verysoon. He's the boy that lives inside of me. He's a lunatic and he's gay, andhe'll be on the new album a lot.\"The Zolanski character is the inspiration for the song 'Roman's Revenge' fromMinaj's debut album 'Pink Friday'.It features a charming, heartwarming cameo from Eminem, who, when he's notcalling women 'sluts' and 'bitches' and threatening to kill them, talks abouttying Minaj up and pissing on her while he videotapes it.The same alter-ego is featured on 'Roman Holiday,' the opening track fromMinaj's second album and described by reviews as containing 'derangedyodelling.' As well as taking on the Zolanski persona, adopting what sounds tobe a Polish accent, Minaj also 'becomes' his mother Martha in a section of thesong, effecting a cartoon cockney accent. I can't help but be reminded of theNorman Bates character in Hitchcock's 'Psycho' 'becoming' his murderous motherby this.In a subsequent interview with 'Rap-Up' magazine, Minaj even addresses thequestion of the Roman character being exorcised from her, as if he has come topossess her:\"I had this vision for him to be sort of exorcised – or actually he never getsexorcised – but people around him tell him he's not good enough because he's notnormal, he's not blending in with the average Joe. And so his mother is scaredand the people around him are afraid because they've never seen anything likehim. He wanted to show that not only is he amazing and he's sure of himself andconfident, but he’s never gonna change, he’s never gonna be exorcised. Even whenthey throw the holy water on him, he still rises above.\"Certainly, Minaj's performance of 'Roman Holiday' at the 54th Grammy Awards hadstrong religious overtones, including a confession and mock exorcism of Roman,and caused inevitable controversy among America's Catholic groups. She enteredwearing flowing blood-red robes, (a colour representing Saturn,) accompanied bya character dressed as a Pope. It makes Madonna's 'Like A Prayer' look like aharmless nursery rhyme.The whole Roman alter is reminiscent of one of Lady Gaga's aliases known as JoCalderone, where she dresses in a suit and claims herself to be a gay male –another shared programming technique? She started her performance at the 2011MTV Video Music Awards with a bizarre monologue in the character of 'Calderone.'Large-scale events such as the MTV Awards, the VMA Awards, the Grammys and theSuper Bowl Half Time Show are mass rituals used to trawl the life energy of theviewing public via their attention. For this reason they're frequently used toput depictions of mind-control and occult possession right there on publicdisplay.Another of Nicki Minaj's identities is 'Barbie Doll,' and indeed, she has oftenappeared depicting herself as a human doll, complete with pink hair. Her debutalbum was called 'Pink Friday.' Dolls and the colour pink are symbolic ofMonarch Programming. She's often referred to as 'Barbie,' and her female fansare known collectively as her 'Barbz,' (with her male fans known, unbelievably,as 'Kenz'!)In 2012, Minaj appeared in a video for the song 'Out Of My Mind' alongside'rapper' (it says here) BoB. Is the song title ringing any alarm bells at all?In the video, Minaj appears in what looks like the cell of a mental institutionin a straight-jacket. Scrawled on the walls are various symbols, including anall-seeing eye inside a pyramid, a depiction of a UFO, and phrases like 'theyare us' and 'they see.' Some lyrics from the 'song' include:\"I'm out of my fucking mind, G-G-golly, oh my,I was doing fine, once upon a time,'Til my brain left and it didn't say bye,Don't look at me wrong; I'm out of my mind.\"Some incisive reflections on the family background of Nicki Minaj, (real nameOnika Maraj,) came from an article on the MK Culture blog site in 2011:\"Nicki Minaj was born in Saint James, (a suburb of Trinidad and Tobago's capitalcity Port of Spain.) Around the age of five she moved to Queens, New York withher parents. According to Minaj, her father had an ongoing drug and alcoholproblem and was abusive to her mother. This fact is the first alarming sign inNicki Minaj's personal life. Children of Project MK-Ultra and Project Monarchoften come from abusive households with parents who are on drugs and suffer fromalcoholism. The children are sold at a young age and remain slaves for theremainder of their lives. Suspected MK victims Rihanna and Chris Brown also comefrom abusive households.\"Nicki has revealed in several interviews that the abusive nature of herupbringing forced her to create alter-egos to escape her troubles. She hasstated that her first identity was named 'Cookie' and it 'stayed with her for awhile.' Her next identity was 'Barbie.' Barbie and dolls are programming toolsfor Monarch victims who are often programmed with doll personalities.\"This is a key point. People often ask how it is that the industry machine canget so many artists on-board with the agenda with such apparent ease. It isindeed the case that some mind-control and SRA (Satanic ritual abuse) victimsare plucked from 'care' homes as children from abusive family backgrounds. Inother cases, meanwhile, the parents are fully complicit in their childrens'involvement in mind-control experiments. Frequently, the families come from amilitary background. The control system does seem to feel it has a green lightto treat those who sign up for a career in the military or 'intelligence'services as their fully-owned property, and military personnel are often thefirst in line for psychological and biological experiments and testing.Similarly, the children of military officers often seem to be given over,whether voluntarily or by coercion, to be used in various programmes.Outside of military circles, meanwhile, there are examples of overbearingparents offering up their offspring to the entertainment industry, perhapshaving been promised massive material gain. Joseph Jackson, father of Michaeland the rest of the Jackson stars, and Mathew Knowles, father of Beyonce andSolange, are two such fathers that spring to mind. While there's no fact-basedproof that Michael and Beyonce are victims of programming, there are suspiciousindicators everywhere. A video emerged on Youtube in late 2014, for instance,showing Beyonce in the audience of a sporting game with Jay-Z, rocking from sideto side and seemingly in some sort of trance state completely oblivious to hersurroundings. Jay-Z doesn't seem to notice or care. Catch that one here –http://www.wedr.com/videos/news/99jamz-exclusivevideo-whats-going-on-with-beyonce/vCz2R3[http://www.wedr.com/videos/news/99jamz-exclusivevideo-whats-going-on-with-beyonce/vCz2R3]/Another viral video from the same year saw CNN presenter Anderson Cooper, (whoalso happens to be the son of socialite and heiress Gloria Vanderbilt and astated CIA asset,) mocking fellow presenter Al Roker who, midway through a liveTV link, completely freezes in an apparent trance state. This happens at theprecise moment one of his co-presenters says 'leave room for the Holy Ghost,'leading to the idea that this may have been a trigger phrase. That video isright here – http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=4jjIDWfWuPE[http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=4jjIDWfWuPE]Given the benefits of hindsight and the availability of new information, it'samazing what you completely missed in years gone by. Another article on the MKCulture blogspot site details the video to Kylie Minogue's interestingly-titled'Shocked,' breaking down much of the imagery which appears to relate to MonarchProgramming. The article mentions that subjecting victims to a dizzying spinningsensation is a standard tactic both before and after a session of abuse. In'Shocked,' Kylie is seen in a revolving door. It also puts an interesting slanton her 'Spinning Around' song. Like many female singers, Kylie has often beenportrayed in sex kitten mode, complete with animal print.

We'll get far more into these areas in the followingchapter. Fritz Springmeier offered some astute interpretation in his 2013 'GoodVibrations' interview, meanwhile:\"There's a reference in scripture where Satan has to come before God to askpermission to mess with Job's life. So people who are religious will often saythat God insists that evil broadcasts what it's going to do. You don't just havea free ticket to go ahead and do evil, but you have to tell. It's calledRevelation of the Method.\"I've always thought that one reason why they do Revelation Of The Method isthat it's very intimidating to the slaves. Imagine if you were a mind-controlledslave and your handler or programmer could come to you and say, 'you thinkyou're going to get free of us? Look, we're doing this right in front ofeverybody, and nobody's coming to help you.' That must be very intimidating tosomeone who is trapped in this. Or maybe part of it is just that a psychopathicsadistic personality gets enormous pleasure out of announcing what they're goingto do.\"WHICH BRITNEY?All of which brings us right back round to Britney Spears and her strangebehaviour of 2007, (the same year that she released an album entitled'Blackout.') There is much evidence to suggest that Britney is a trauma-basedvictim exhibiting the usual different personalities, not least the fact that sheemerged as one of the 'mouseketeers' of The Mickey Mouse Club. This was atelevision creation of the Disney Corporation which showcased an array of childperformers from 1955 to 1996. Britney appeared in the same year as ChristinaAguilera and Justin Timberlake, before all three went on to become massive popstars and public figures simultaneously. In all cases, their initial images werewholesome, pure and all-American, getting gradually raunchier and more sexual astime passed. The same dynamic can be seen with fellow Disney star Miley Cyrus inher transformation from squeaky clean Hannah Montana into the sluttishdebauchery that now characterises her stage shows – from straddling giantwrecking balls in videos, to performing a refrain of Khia's strip club anthem'My Neck My Back' at a stage show attended by pre-teen girls. You know the one,it goes 'my neck, my back, eat my pussy and my crack.' Yeah, girl power!Disney is in fact a deeply Satanic organisation. There have been claims that thetrauma-based abuse of children occurs in underground bases beneath popularDisney attractions like Walt Disney World in Florida, while dazzled crowdswander around obliviously above. There are multiple videos on Youtube showinghow Disney's cartoons through the ages have used Satanic and highly sexualsymbols targeted directly at the subliminal minds of children, and a quickinternet search using the words 'Satanic disney' will throw up many of them. Thetruth of what's being conveyed in Disney films couldn't be further from theapparently clean and innocent surface narrative – another example of how theSatanic mindset twists and perverts original meanings to its own end. It's allpart of an over-arching plan to sexualise children at ever-earlier ages, and todebase and degrade the purity and innocence of childhood. At the same time theagenda works to destroy the archetype of the traditional family unit; evernoticed how many of the central characters' mothers die in Disney movies?Further evidence to suggest that Britney suffers from Multiple PersonalityDisorder, comes from a 'Prime Time' TV interview she gave with Diane Sawyer in2003. When asked about the tough year she'd just endured, Britney seems toswitch personalities and apparently interact with an unseen person, or entity.She turns quickly to the side and says 'oh, weird,' followed by,'hello . . . umm . . . oh my goodness . . . hello . . . eww! Strong Britney,'before apparently snapping back into her 'front alter' and becoming tearful andoverwhelmed.You can see the video here. When armed with an understanding of how traumatechniques work on the human mind, it makes for very disturbing viewing:http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=DMpguv7st7s[http://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=DMpguv7st7s]On occasion, the mind-control programming breaks down, and Britney's headshaving antics give an indication that this is what was really going on. Freemanaddressed this event in an article on his freemantv.com [http://freemantv.com]site:\"Survivors report that when victims of mind-control approach 30 years old, theirbrain attempts to break the amnesiac barriers and reintegrate itself. First, shedyed her hair dark brown. She then walked into Esther’s Hair Salon and demandedto have her head shaved. The owner told Britney that she would not shave herhead and Britney took the shears and did it herself. When Arizona Wilder toldDavid Icke of her escape from the Mothers of Darkness she said that she had dyedher hair brown to be removed as the ritual goddess of the order. When thiswasn’t enough to keep her out of the rituals, she then shaved her head.\"When Britney was asked why she did it, she replied that she was tired of peopletouching her and she didn’t want them plugging things into her. She had been inand out of 'rehab' before the salon incident. After she shaved her head, shechecked into Promises clinic in Malibu where she terrified staff by scrawling666 onto her bald head, screaming she was the Anti-Christ and then attempting tohang herself with a bed sheet.\"This raises a good point. Are the 'rehab clinics' that we hear of so many celebsattending really mind-control labs? You can read the rest of Freeman's articleon the dark occult and mind-control overtones of Britney Spears and many otherartists here: http://freemantv.com/celebrities[http://freemantv.com/celebrities]-under-mind-control-release-the-stars-weird-stuff/CAN YOU HANDLE IT?Just as with the later incident involving singer Ke$ha and her producer/ managerDr. Luke, the issue of pop stars and their mind-control handlers appeared tobreak the surface into the mainstream realm in 2008 – albeit in a way that thatonly those with some prior knowledge of the subject would have been able toproperly interpret.Sam Lutfi, who for a time was Britney Spears' personal manager, brought alawsuit against Britney's mother, citing breach of contract, libel anddefamation. Britney's mother, Lynne Spears, had blamed Lutfi for her daughter'sfamous breakdown which incorporated the head-shaving incident. The breakdown sawBritney losing custody of her two children to dancer Kevin 'K-Fed' Federline.Lutfi denied the claims, writing on his Twitter account that he was 'falselyaccused of doing horrible things by horrible people.'Lutfi's lawsuit was thrown out, and Britney's family obtained a restrainingorder against him, alongside her ex-boyfriend Adnan Ghalib and attorney JonEardley. The order forbade all three from contacting Britney or coming within250 yards of her, her property or family members.As Vigilant Citizen observed in 2012:\"Proof is piling up that Britney Spears is a victim of mind-control at the handsof unscrupulous handlers. While mass media points their finger at specific'controlling' individuals, it is increasingly obvious that she is the product ofa system that totally suppressed her free will and personal freedom. What makesBritney’s case different from others is that the apparent feud between her pastand present handlers is causing some otherwise 'censored' information to leakout about how pop stars are completely owned and handled by people behind thescenes. If people are led to believe that Spears' case is special, well, it ismore common than most would believe.\"Possibly the most intriguing aspect of the whole matter, however, was thephrasing used by the probate judge overseeing the conservatorship. Despite Lutfifiling papers at Los Angeles County Superior Court requesting that Britneyherself be made available as a witness, the probate judge ruled that she couldnot appear on the grounds that being exposed to the discussions could cause her'irreparable harm and immediate danger.' Britney's own family made the claimthat she was 'mentally incapable' of testifying.Anyone not directly involved in the event is left to speculate, of course, butis this curious piece of terminology not compatible with a mind-control subjectbeing sheltered from memories that could trigger an unwanted deviation fromtheir programming – particularly when this had already happened in thenot-too-distant past?Britney's father Jamie was awarded conservatorship in 2008, giving him fullcontrol over her personal and business affairs. A conservatorship is normallyawarded when someone develops dementia, a brain injury, or is otherwise deemedmentally unfit to handle their own business. What could have caused suchdissociation from reality in the case of Britney Spears, I wonder? Theconservatorship was meant to be temporary, but Britney's family argued the casefor it to be permanently in place.An article on the matter in the UK's 'Daily Mail' in October 2011 stated:\"Earlier this month a claim for $900,000, (around £500,000) in legal fees wasput in front of the judge in charge of her case – just for sorting out theconservatorship.\"That money will all come from Britney’s funds. No wonder she is still workingso hard despite her troubles. ‘She does love performing,’ says one source closeto the Britney camp, ‘but left to her own devices it’s highly unlikely she’dundertake the sort of commitments that her conservatorship has signed her onto.’\"And there are signs she no longer enjoys the touring as she once did. It isalmost a given she mimes throughout most of her performances – something sheused to put down to her energetic dance routines. But even they have fallen bythe wayside.\"Britney later hooked up with another manager, Jason Trawick, who she shortlyafterwards described as her 'boyfriend,' and later, fiancé. Trawick joinedBritney's father in overseeing her conservatorship. Partners often double ashandlers in the world of celebrity mind-control. There were claims that Trawickwas effectively chosen for the 'boyfriend' role by Spears' parents. Spears andTrawick ended their 'engagement' in early 2013.That same year, Lutfi Tweeted what purported to be images of texts sent to himby Britney during their turbulent years together. One reads:\"My Dad will send me away again. He's soo (sic) mean. I can't believe they hurtme like this . . . my Dad's reading everything right now that I text andeverybodys (sic) really scares me. I miss my babies and I'm really still scaredI'm never gonna see my babies again.\"Another text, which Lutfi alleged was from Britney, elaborated:'My mom and dad are soo (sic) mean. They don't care about me, they just want mymoney and my babies. They stole my voice and scarred me for life. I will neverforgive them . . . all they care about is $$$$. They makes (sic) up lies aboutyou to all these fucking shady lawyers . . . I'm sad. So very sad. Lost. Verylost.'HOW MANY MCSIt's impossible for outside observers to say with absolute certainty whichartists are victims of mind-control. Given the penchant for offering visualclues, however, it's certainly possible to make an educated guess. In thiscontext, a singer who appears as a likely candidate is Mariah Carey.Carey first emerged in 1990 signed to Columbia Records, a division of theentertainment giant Sony, with her sweeping ballad 'Vision Of Love'. From 1993to 1998 she was married to Tommy Mottola, himself a former singer andsong-pitcher, former manager of the duo Hall & Oates, and by then, CEO of SonyMusic Entertainment. Michael Jackson famously branded Mottola a racist andreferred to him as 'devilish' in a rant about the Sony corporation, to which hewas also signed, at Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network event in NewYork City in 2002.(Columbia itself is a name to conjure with. Like the country of Colombia, andthe District Of Columbia which comprises the city of Washington, it is derivedfrom 'columb,' the Spanish word for dove. The dove is a symbolic rendering ofthe mother goddess figure of Semiramis in Ancient Babylonian mythology. This isthe archetypal figure also represented by the Statue Of Liberty in New YorkHarbour, which was given to the city by French freemasons in Paris, where areplica of the same figure stands on an island in the River Seine. Masonic andancient mystery school symbolism throughout.)Many researchers have questioned whether Mottola was acting as Mariah's handlerduring their time together. Certainly, their marriage was known to be turbulentand unconventional. Mottola himself addressed this in his book 'Hitmaker: TheMan and His Music,' writing: \"it was absolutely wrong and inappropriate for meto become involved with Mariah.\" When interviewed by 'The Hollywood Reporter' onthe subject, Mottola remained his notoriously evasive self when asked: \"You wereaccused in the press of 'trapping' Mariah Carey in an unhappy marriage. In'Hitmaker,' you describe friction at home as she grew 'resentful.' Why divulgesuch details?\"Mottola replied:\"I came to the conclusion long ago that I gave the marriage the best that Icould, as did she. The good news is that she went on to have a huge career, andso did I. Our personal life didn't work out, but I continue to be her biggestfan and support her.\"In 1997, Mariah released an album entitled 'Butterfly'. Although Monarchbutterfly imagery was missing from this particular album sleeve, on the cover toher 'Greatest Hits' album, she is indeed pictured clutching one of thedistinctively-coloured Monarchs for no apparent reason.Mariah's apparent obsession with butterflies was taken further in 2011, when shehad a butterfly design painted on to her pregnant stomach for her birthday,along with the phrase 'dem babies.' This particular butterfly featured one pinkwing and one blue, so wasn't an obvious depiction of a Monarch. But the strangemove nevertheless prompts some questions as to why she chose it. She gave birthto twins three years to the day after marrying all-round entertainer NickCannon, in another example of an industry-only relationship.A very interesting turn of phrase comes from a paragraph in Mottola'spreviously-mentioned book, where he describes the final break-up of hisrelationship with Mariah. He writes that he went to work and \"left a note withlyrics to an Elton John song on the nightstand: 'Butterflies are free to fly.Fly away . . .”According to the Vigilant Citizen website's extensive article on Monarchprogramming, a rainbow is another image that has strong connotations inmind-control circles, linked as it is to the 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow' songfrom 'The Wizard of Oz.'\"In each case, the slave is given a particular interpretation of the movie’sstoryline in order to enhance programming. For example, a slave watching 'TheWizard of Oz' is taught that 'somewhere over the rainbow' is the 'happy place'dissociative trauma slaves must go to in order to escape the unbearable painbeing inflicted upon them. Using the movie, programmers encourage slaves to go'over the rainbow' and dissociate, effectively separating their minds from theirbodies.\"In 1999, Carey released an album entitled 'Rainbow', whose sleeve designfeatures her cavorting in front of a rainbow on an all-white background, whilethe inside gatefold has her reclining on a bed sucking on a heart-shapedlollipop, with an electric-light rainbow overhead.Two years later came an incident which, on the surface, looks like another ofthose 'crazy celebs' who have everything in the world going off the edge, buthas some darker connotations. In September 2001, immediately prior to the eventsof 9/11, headlines reported that Mariah had suffered an apparent nervousbreakdown and made an attempt at suicide. According to the 'Daily Mail,' (andseveral other sources who ran an identically-worded article, proving thatmainstream outlets work from the same limited and controlled sources!):\"The 31-year-old singer's publicist denied that she had tried to take her ownlife, but Carey's mother apparently made a distraught call to the emergencyservices last week after her daughter was discovered in her New York hotel roombleeding from slit wrists and cuts to her body.\"She's cracking up. I think she's going to kill herself,' her mother is quotedas having told police officers before Carey was taken to Westchester NorthHospital, where she remains since being checked in as 'emotionally disturbed'last week. Her spokeswoman, Cindy Berger, said Carey had cancelled all publicappearances after experiencing an 'emotional and physical breakdown.'\"She dismissed tabloid reports that the singer tried to commit suicide. She saidthat, just before the breakdown, Carey suffered cuts to her body, but theinjuries were unintentional. 'She did break some dishes and glasses, and she mayhave stepped on them,' said Ms. Berger. 'She is taking it day by day and isresting and improving.\"And later in the article:\"Last month, Carey made a surreal, impromptu appearance on MTV's 'Total RequestLive,' dressed in little more than a lavender T-shirt. She also made a publicityappearance at a Long Island shopping centre, where her publicist eventually tookthe microphone off her to stop her speaking.\"In what appears to be another example of an arranged relationship of the typethe entertainment industry likes to engineer, (see Jay-Z/ Beyonce, Rihanna/Chris Brown, Nas/ Kelis, Katy Perry/ Russell Brand, etc, etc,) Mariah reportedlyhad a brief sexual dalliance with Eminem. This seemingly turned bitter quickly,(as they have a tendency to do,) resulting in Mariah taunting Eminem with thesong and video 'Obsessed.' This spawned a vicious 'diss' track from Eminem inthe form of 'The Warning,' in which he complains of having to 'put up with' her'psycho ass,' and portrays her as an alcoholic.The subject of Carey's mental well-being came back to the mainstream in June2015, when 'The National Enquirer' ran a front-page headline entitled 'Mariah:Suicidal & Insane! Carey's terrified brother tells all.' The article referencesMariah's 2001 breakdown, with her brother Morgan detailing how her irrationalbehaviour, alcoholism and addiction to prescription drugs have prompted fearsshe could 'end up like Whitney.'EAGER BIEBERSome similarly erratic behaviour patterns came from Justin Bieber's visit toLondon in 2012. Bieber, another former child star, was pictured around townwearing a gas mask and was late arriving on stage, frequently babblingincoherently. A few days earlier he had sported purple leopard-print harempants.A couple of years later, he was arrested for drag racing on Miami Beach,appearing memorably in court in an orange prison suit. The media also reportedhim verbally abusing and spitting at fans. In 2014, a vintage video emerged ofBieber singing a song about killing black people.All of this served to demonise Bieber as an obnoxious brat in the eyes of thepublic, and it begs the question of how much of it was instigated as part ofsome scheme to humiliate him. For instance, it would take a person of verydisciplined morals to be able to watch this video and not feel compelled toreach for the nearest baseball bat: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=CCJ51ibuoIM [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=CCJ51ibuoIM]The public was further subliminally instructed to hate on Bieber in June 2015,when he was charged with assault and careless driving charges. It also emergedthat there was a warrant for Bieber's arrest issued in Argentina, after he hadfailed to respond to a summons related to an assault accusation dating back to2013.Vigilant Citizen posted an article upon the release of Bieber's disturbing'Where Are U Now' video, positing the idea that the industry that spawned himwas now mocking and humiliating him, which you can check out here: * https://www.facebook.com/events/403201616537938 [https://www.facebook.com/events/403201616537938]/It's not the first time the industry has built an artist up to become famous andsuccessful, only to later degrade them by carefully fostering the public'scontempt. Chris Brown, another former child star, received this treatment whenhe was charged with assaulting girlfriend Rihanna. Although hitting women isalways indefensible, the amount of scorn and judgement poured on him for monthsafterwards did seem out of all proportion to the event.HOLLYWEIRD AND LA LA LANDBritney and Bieber's strange behaviour brings to mind stories of actress LindsayLohan running wild, crashing cars, getting ejected from celebrity nightspots andgoing in and out of 'rehab.' Lohan is yet another former child star to have comeout of the Disney empire, (is there a pattern emerging here?), and is an exampleof Hollywood celebs sharing many characteristics with their music industryequivalents.The Hollyweird scene is reportedly a hotbed of MK-Ultra mind-control activity,as evidenced by a handful of whistleblowers. Best known among these is theactress Roseanne Barr who has been interviewed on a few different occasions onthe subject. (The very name Hollywood comes from the 'holy wood' which wizardsand druids used to construct magic wands. Highly relevant considering the mindspells that Hollywood films cast over their viewers.)Barr appears to have first raised the issue of mind-controlled celebritiesduring an interview on CNN with a cynical Larry King on 16th August, (Madonna'sbirthday and Elvis's reported death day,) in 2001. During the interview shementions Nazi scientists being brought to America by the CIA at the end of WorldWar 2. She goes on to suggest that she may have had some kind of chip implantedin her head, and that she feels her moves are being constantly monitored by agroup of women including chat show host Oprah Winfrey. She claimed she hadsuffered intense trauma during her childhood, leading to Multiple PersonalityDisorder. Barr was raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, home of the Mormon Church,and is of Jewish parentage. Her paternal grandfather changed his surname fromBorisofsky to Barr upon entering the US from Russia.In 2013, by this point having run as a presidential candidate, Roseannediscussed the issue of racism, sexism, the Hollywood class system and thepresence of MK-Ultra in an interview with Abby Martin's 'Breaking The Set' onthe RT America network. You can watch that video here: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=8whbmRMw0Bg [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=8whbmRMw0Bg]The fact that Barr stands as one of only a handful of Hollywood insiders thathave come forward should not be taken as representing any lack of credibilityfor the information. There are obviously great risks involved in speaking out inthis way. A best-case scenario is that an actor's career is likely to flopovernight. She has spoken of a 'culture of fear' that permeates the industry andkeeps most potential whistleblowers obediently in their place. There's also thestrong possibility of mind-controlled slaves undergoing programming thatprevents them from speaking out even if they wished to.THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKEJust as with the Britney Spears/ Sam Lutfi affair, the issue of A-list pop starsbeing under the dominance of their mind-control handlers emerged from the murkyshadows again in 2014 with an extraordinary story involving the singer KeshaSebert, known then by the artist name of Ke$ha. Up to that point, she had beenjust one name in a glut of soul-less industry puppets singing vacuous songs overgeneric electronic production, and displaying all the usual symbols pertainingto dark occultism and mind-control in her videos. Her stage show at the 2011Sydney Future Music Festival depicted her drinking blood from a human heart tothe song 'Cannibal' in a performance that would have been watched by millions ofpre-teen children, such is the target market of 'artists' of her ilk.Things reached a new moral low – even by the standards of the industry's cesspitof depravity – with her song 'Die Young'. The lyrics offered the basic sentimentthat life is all about partying, drinking, having promiscuous sex and living forthe moment. There's no point in morality because life is basically pointless,and we're all going to die young anyway.The video was notable for all the wrong reasons, too, overloaded with esotericimagery to the point that even regular members of the public with no backgroundin studying occult symbolism were questioning why pyramids containingall-seeing-eyes, upside-down crosses and pentagrams were being flashed on-screenfor no apparent reason. Ke$ha is depicted as leading some kind of cult immersedin sex magick as she sings about 'young hunks, taking shots, stripping down todirty socks.'Feigned moral judgement came from the mainstream media and governmentspokespeople, however, when the Sandy Hook school 'shooting,' (which has provento be yet another staged false flag event involving actors, just as an aside,)occurred a few weeks after 'Die Young' had become a massive hit. The chorus linewas felt to be distasteful and inappropriate in the aftermath of what had justhappened, (but didn't.) Apparently there was no problem with the song beforethat, and it was deemed just fine for daytime radio play.Although Ke$ha is credited with having written the song's lyrics, (its Wikipediaentry makes the statement, in all apparent seriousness, that she \"wrote thelyrics after travelling around the world and embarking on a spiritual journey,\")in the aftermath of the 'Die Young' controversy, she posted the followingmessage on her personal Twitter account:\"Understand, I had my very own issue with 'Die Young.' For this reason I did NOTwant to sing those lyrics and was FORCED TO.\"Soon afterwards the Tweet was deleted, but it had already offered the firstofficial indication of the level of control that existed in the Ke$ha camp.It was the song's producer, who also happened to be Ke$ha's manager, who is ofparticular interest in this context. This is one Lukasz Sebastian Gottwald,known throughout the music industry by the name Dr. Luke.Gottwald's Wikipedia entry says that he was born in the US state of Rhode Islandin 1973 and is of Jewish parentage, (a fact which will surely surprise no-one bythis point in our story!) His father is said to have been an architect whoemigrated from Poland. Gottwald's professional music career began as the houseband guitarist on the TV show 'Saturday Night Live.' According to comments givenby Ke$ha to the entertainment site TMZ, Gottwald earned his 'Dr.' nickname inthis period by selling drugs to other artists.His first music production credit is on Kelly Clarkson's 'Since U Been Gone' in2004. Since then, pretty much all the A-list artists he has produced and writtensongs for have been the ones whose lyrics most promote the Illuminati agenda ofmoral degradation, and whose videos are most laden with Satanic and other darkoccult symbolism. These include Katy Perry, Pink, Avril Lavigne, Britney Spears,Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Miley Cyrus, Jessie J, Juicy J and Shakira. A glance athis credentials shows that Gottwald is a well-connected individual in thecorporate music game.Gottwald had acted as Ke$ha's manager throughout her ten-year career. In 2012,Ke$ha wrote and recorded a song called 'Dance With The Devil' which was said todocument aspects of her relationship with Gottwald, and the control that he andthe industry in general exerted over her. It included the lyrics:\"I keep on dancing with the Devil,I keep on dancing with the Devil,I sold my soul, ain’t no turning back,I keep on dancing with the Devil.\"The real shocker came in October 2014 when Kesha, (who by this point had droppedthe '$' from her name in an apparent statement of independence,) filed a lawsuitagainst Dr. Luke, claiming sexual assault and battery, sexual harassment, genderviolence, and emotional abuse throughout their working relationship. Ke$ha'smother, Pebe Sebert, had already claimed that emotional pressure from Gottwaldhad led to Ke$ha developing a nervous eating disorder.Reading between the lines, the lawsuit gave as strong a public indication asthere's ever been, of the relationship between a mind-controlled music industryslave and her handler. Handlers often turn out to be artists' own managers,('management' in the true sense,) spouses or other family members, their closeproximity allowing for constant monitoring of their activities and mental state,and for intervention whenever required. The 24-page lawsuit opens with thefollowing wording:“At eighteen years old, Ms. Sebert was induced by defendant Lukasz SebastianGottwald, (a.k.a. 'Dr. Luke,') a successful music producer, to drop out of highschool, leave behind her family, home, and life in Nashville, Tennessee, andcome to Los Angeles to pursue a glamorous career in the music industry.\"For the past ten years, Dr. Luke has sexually, physically, verbally, andemotionally abused Ms. Sebert to the point where Ms. Sebert nearly lost herlife. Dr. Luke abused Ms. Sebert in order to destroy her self-confidence,self-image, and self-worth so that he could maintain complete control over herlife and career.”Further on, it alleges drugging and rape at the hands of Gottwald:\"Ms. Sebert took the pills and woke up the following afternoon, naked in Dr.Luke’s bed, sore and sick, with no memory of how she got there. Ms. Sebertimmediately called her mother and made a ‘fresh complaint,’ telling her that shewas naked in Dr. Luke’s hotel room, she did not know where the clothes were,that Dr. Luke had raped her, and that she needed to go to the emergency room.\"To save face – and unsurprisingly – Gottwald responded by filing a countersuitagainst Kesha and her family, denying the accusations and claiming that thelawsuit had been an attempt to pressure him into releasing Kesha from theconfines of her recording contract.Kesha's attorney Mark Geragos responded to this by stating:\"This is just another pathetic and entirely predictable example of Dr. Luke’scontinued abuse, and a misguided attempt to keep Kesha under his tyrannicalcontrol. This lawsuit has absolutely no basis in fact, the law or reality. Keshais focused on reclaiming her voice and her freedom. She is determined to move onwith her life and her career by putting this dark period behind her.\"This was followed by another counter-lawsuit against Dr. Luke's, from Kesha'smother in December 2014. Geragos, meanwhile, seized upon a comment made by LadyGaga earlier that month that she had been raped by a famous music producer whenshe was 19, by claiming the rapist in question was Dr. Luke. Althoughspokespeople for Gaga denied this, Geragos stuck by his allegation.For many who only obtain their view of what's going on in the world fromcorporate, mainstream sources, this would have offered their first exposure tothe dominance that is exerted over artists by their industry overseers,revealing them to be nothing more than pawns who, in the eyes of the industry,are owned property to be used and abused at will.RUNNING IN THE FAMILYSatanic Ritual Abuse, (SRA,) incorporates elements of trauma-based mind-control.A survivor of a lifetime of this at the hands of his own parents and the cult towhich they belonged is Jay Parker, who now works as a radio show host, publicspeaker and counselor for other victims. In his 2015 'Good Vibrations'interview, he elaborated on the importance of keeping the abuse within certaingenerational bloodlines:\"My experience was growing up in a family of teachers. Both my parents wereschoolteachers. My mother traced her Satanic heritage back to the Amalekitepeople, from basically 2000BC in what would now be Palestine. My father wasninth-generational Illuminati; I would have been tenth. My family came fromNorthern Ireland and came to the US back in the potato famine in the 1850s.There were three brothers. They were all Satanic as far as I can tell. One wentto Chicago, one went to Philadelphia and one went to New York State. Theystarted Illuminati cells wherever they went. When my grandfather was buried in asmall town in New Jersey, 300 people showed up that no-one in the town had everseen.\"The religion that they're working with is at least from 2000BC, and it's areligion based on abuse and programming. The human, in a hypnogogic trance forthe first five to six years of their lives, is building their subconscious. Yoursubconscious will run 95 per cent of your adult life. So in the first five tosix years of your life, you're having your subconscious built by your society,by your religion, by your parents. None of it's being built by you. None ofit's, 'oh, I like that. I'm going to put that in my mind. That's going to bepart of my data bank.' Thoughts, images, prejudices. All kinds of things arebeing thrown in there, by television, through subliminals in mass media.\"Jay says that keeping the SRA abuse in the family is to ensure the programme iscontinued like clockwork through successive generations. He himself would havebeen expected to continue the trauma had he not risen above the programming andthus broken the long-running chain when he did in 2001.PULLING TRIGGERSVictims and handlers within Monarch Programming are interchangeable. Manyhandlers have undergone trauma themselves, and part of their programmingprepares them to traumatise new slaves, while remaining in servitude themselves.Arranged marriages never last long as shifts end and new handlers are broughtin.Katy Perry is another whose videos and promotional pictures are littered withall-too-blatant clues. Perry's husband for a short period was Russell Brand,alleged 'comedian,' former BBC presenter, host of the shows 'Big Brother' and'Brand X,' and The Child Catcher in the massive occult ritual that was theclosing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics. Despite all these red flags, manystill accept his positioning as a self-styled hero of the people calling for a'revolution of consciousness' in the UK. It's amazing the effect some long hairand a beard can have. That and a heavy dose of denial. Brand's controllers aretelling us all about his true allegiances through the symbolism they have himplace right in front of our faces, and yet still so many make excuses for him,constantly insisting, 'but he says all the right things!' Yes. He's a trained(millionaire) actor, and actors are known to improvise around scripts.The Youtube user known as Alien Fossil Project posted a video in which Brand andPerry are attending an Oscars Red Carpet ceremony. At one point while he'stalking, Brand momentarily flashes a pendant with the word 'Obey' on it, andPerry's demeanour changes as she becomes incoherent. The pendant also features apentagram design in red, white and black, the same colours the pair are wearing,coincidentally, and echoes a publicity shot featuring 'hip hop model' (it sayshere) Amber Rose, in which she poses with a massive 'Obey' sign in red on herT-shirt. The former girlfriend of Kanye West, Rose then gravitated towardsrapper Wiz Khalifa. Is anyone going to keel over in shock at the news her fatherserved in the US military for 20 years?You can see the Brand/ Perry video here –https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=9NaSYrVbH6c.[https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=9NaSYrVbH6c.]This has all the hallmarks of a handler/ slave scenario. Shortly after his splitfrom Perry, Brand began dating Jemima Khan, (nee Goldsmith,) an heiress toanother banking dynasty heavily connected to the Rothschilds. Brand has beenphotographed on a handful of occasions throwing up the 'mano cornutto'/ devilhorns hand sign that we visited in the earlier chapter. Brand has said that hewas sexually abused himself as a child. How many more clues do people reallyneed?WHO'S THE DADDY?Two works of fiction are frequently cited as providing triggers for those underMonarch Programming, to bring forward certain alters. These are the 1939 movie'The Wizard Of Oz', and the 'Alice In Wonderland' stories by freemason andoccult secret society initiate Lewis Carroll. Both these stories are laden withmind-control imagery in their surface narrative, as well as being allegedly fullof trigger phrases, images and colours. A further story subject to the sameclaim is J. D Salinger's 'The Catcher In The Rye', which Mark Chapman wasfamously reading when he 'shot' John Lennon.Fritz Springmeier got further into the question of 'triggers' in his 'GoodVibrations' interview:\"Another thing that they're using the music industry for . . . I used to listento the radio, and whenever they wanted to announce a ritual on the radio, you'dhear the song 'Heartache Tonight'. Or to reinforce the programming there's asong 'Playing With The Queen Of Hearts'. 'Knock Three Times' is another one.Three knocks is a mind-control trigger.\"Springmeier also contends that the US Country & Western music industry waseffectively founded on the basis of generational mind-control. Very interestingwhen you bear in mind that Billy Ray Cyrus, father of the clearly troubled MileyCyrus, made a name for himself on this scene.\"The Country & Western music industry was created by the intelligence servicesand the Illuminati, and has been a hotbed for this trauma-based mind-control.I've watched these Country & Western performers doing things, and right in frontof people, if you understand the mind-control, you see it. So Dolly Parton wasout there on stage one time, and her handler came out and she turned around andput her hand on his in submission as a slave does, because I'd been taught byCisco Wheeler how a slave is to show submission. So she does that and then sheturns around and calls him 'Daddy.' Right there in front of millions of peopleon television! If you understand the mind-control you're like, 'whoa, they justdid it right in front of us. This isn't even secret!' So once you know how torecognise these things, you see it right in front of you all the time.\"Dolly Parton is Miley Cyrus's 'Godmother', as a matter of interest.When armed with knowledge of the agenda that music artists are being used topropagate, it's easy to fall into the trap of resenting and despising them forit. I've certainly been guilty of that when it comes to the likes of Nicki Minajand Lil' Wayne and the role they've played in helping turn hip-hop from aonce-meaningful art form into the septic tank of toxic garbage it now is. But itremains important to consider what horrors many artists have most likely beenthrough since early childhood, to the point that their minds and personalitiesreally are no longer their own. No amount of mansions, yachts and nice cars canever be worth such a heavy price paid."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Cathy O'Brien/ Trance Formation of America: * http://www.trance-formation.com [http://www.trance-formation.com]/Conspiro Media: The Rothschild influence on music.

These are metaphysicalqualities which need to be understood for the tactics of the entertainmentindustry's dark magicians to make any kind of sense. Without being perceived intheir full context, these activities will appear as bizarre, random standaloneevents, rather than being part of the colossal, interconnected web that theyreally are.The concept of consent lies at the very root of the human experience, accordingto the teachings of many ancient religions, esoteric mystery schools, spiritualmediums and past-life regressionists. Within these lies the notion that, asspirit-souls and expressions of infinite consciousness, each of us 'consents' tobe born into physical human form before we get here. We also hear that ourhigher selves form bonding 'contracts' with other spirit-souls, which have abearing on what plays out as we go through our lives. In this regard, we canactually choose which other souls will be our parents, partners, children oradversaries. Spirit-souls often 'contract' in this way through severallifetimes, according to the teachings, exchanging roles from one lifetime toanother, in order that each can learn the lessons and undergo the experiencesthat they have pre-chosen for themselves. So your daughter in one life could beyour husband in the next.This truly is a mindblower when you hear it for the first time, and it can takeseveral days of mental assimilation to get your head around it. And I guessthere's no way of fundamentally proving this notion one way or the other untilwe depart this physical realm. Either way, the fact that the idea is sowidespread in cultural traditions all over the world, illustrates the importanceof free-will consciousness, and giving consent to a situation before you undergoit, so there can be no legitimate claim that it was foisted upon you without youagreement.As beings imbued with self-awareness, humans are also gifted with free-will –the ability to make decisions which govern our thoughts and behaviours. Thesehave a direct bearing on the conditions that manifest as a result. This isconsequentialism, a concept which has been called many names through the ages.Whatever the label, the dynamic is always the same. Humans are unique in beingable to shape the reality that we experience as a result of projecting our will.The nature of the energetic intent that we put out comes right back at us in theform of our experiences. By the same process we also reap the appropriateconsequences for our actions, (karma.) The dark priest class that has beenholding humanity in spiritual enslavement for millennia understand thisuniversal truth only too well. If we are to stand any chance of breaking thespell, therefore, and achieving the freedom that's so long overdue, we also needto understand that these concepts are very real, and start to utilise them forthe all-round betterment of humanity.This concept is documented in the writings known as 'The Kybalion: HermeticPhilosophy,' which was published in 1908 and attributed to unknown writers whocalled themselves 'the Three Initiates.' It offers an interpretation of theHermetic philosophies practiced in Ancient Egypt and Greece. On the subject ofconsequentialism, it states:\"This Principle embodies the fact that there is a cause for every effect; aneffect from every cause. It explains that: 'Everything happens according toLaw;' that nothing ever 'merely happens;' that there is no such thing as chance;that while there are various planes of cause and effect, the higher dominatingthe lower planes, still nothing ever entirely escapes the Law.\"The Hermeticists understand the art and methods of rising above the ordinaryplane of cause and effect, to a certain degree, and by mentally rising to ahigher plane they become causers instead of effects. The masses of people arecarried along, obedient to environment; the wills and desires of others strongerthan themselves; heredity; suggestion; and other outward causes moving themabout like pawns on the Chessboard of Life.\"But the Masters, rising to the plane above, dominate their moods, characters,qualities, and powers, as well as the environment surrounding them, and becomemovers instead of pawns. They help to play the game of life, instead of beingplayed and moved about by other wills and environment. They use the Principleinstead of being its tools.\"Despite so many of their teachings being otherwise full of controlling dogma,the human capacity to make free-will choice is something that's recognised inmany of the world religions. I certainly remember having it drummed into meduring the four years I attended a Christian church, that people make their ownindividual choice – independent of 'God' – to either accept Jesus and 'besaved,' or to be led astray by 'The Devil' and go to Hell. These aresensationalist over-simplifications of a universal truth, but the basicprinciple remains the same. Our capacity for free-will choice that affects ourresulting experiences, is our greatest gift as humans. To be able to hijack thatability by manipulating and corrupting free-will choice on a mass scale,therefore, is one of the greatest weapons available to any parasitic enemy.This is what is happening when we get into the phenomenon known as PredictiveProgramming.PREDICTIVE PROGRAMMINGPP is the practice of encoding visual clues and symbols into works of popularculture aimed at large audiences, which depict a real-world event yet to happen,or currently happening. In recognition of the powerful influence of thesubconscious mind on an individual's psyche, images are subtly conveyed inencoded form which foreshadow events which are known to be coming. When theindividual's conscious mind is then subject to news of the event in question,memories from the subconscious are unknowingly evoked, bringing a type offamiliarity with the event. The propaganda of whatever official story thepowers-that-be concoct and unleash via a compliant mainstream media, are thenmore readily absorbed.It's a variation on the occult symbolism being placed into music videos that weencountered in the earlier chapter, except this method is far more involved, asit relies on the unwitting participation of the audience to achieve its fullpotential. The power lies in the symbols remaining subliminal. Once they crossthe threshold into the conscious mind and their intent is fully understood,their power is lost. This is why it's so important for people in their largenumbers to understand how the game – and we ourselves – are being played.British researcher Alan Watt may have been the first to have coined thePredictive Programming phrase. He explains its workings as follows:\"Things or ideas which would otherwise be seen as bizarre, vulgar, undesirableor impossible are inserted into films in the realm of fantasy. When the viewerwatches these films, his/ her mind is left open to suggestion and theconditioning process begins.\"PP can be seen at work in music videos, live stage shows, television programmesand Hollywood movies, and has been used for decades. Logic dictates that theonly way this can be, is if the forces that control these industries are workingalongside those directing the events that are being depicted – or if they areultimately one and the same. Any sceptics rejecting this dynamic are left with awhole world of 'coincidences' defying all mathematical odds to explain away as'just one of those things.'We'll look at some classic examples of this phenomenon in practice, beforestudying the effects that they have and their reason for being placed where theyare.DOCTOR'S ORDERS AND LEGS ELEVENThe single event conveyed more than any other in Predictive Programming form hasbeen 9/11. There is a huge array of Youtube videos made by independent users,consisting of clips from Hollywood movies and TV shows made prior to 11thSeptember 2001. Some of these compilations go on for minutes, indicating thesheer number of examples. As a result there are way too many to list, but a fewclassics to illustrate the idea are as follows: * In the film 'Independence Day,' released in 1996, there is a split-second frame in which a digital clock is seen counting down hours, minutes and seconds. The clock just happens to be at 00:09:11:01. * In the first 'Matrix' movie, from 1999, the camera closes in on Neo's passport, which just happens to show an expiry date of 11th September 2001. * 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day' (1991) contains a split-second shot showing a low bridge with a clearance sign giving the height '9'11'. * In a 1997 episode of 'The Simpsons,' Bart holds up a bus leaflet entitled 'New York'. A massive '9,' indicating the $9 price, lines up next to the WTC towers, giving a nice, clear 9/11. (Matt Groening, creator of 'The Simpsons,' is reportedly a 33rd-degree freemason, but I'm sure it's just a coincidence and nothing to worry about.)Some Youtube videos which chronicle other 9/11 examples are listed in theResources section at the end of the chapter. The number of aspects of thatfateful day evoked – from planes flying into the towers, to bodies apparentlyjumping from them – will be truly astounding to anyone looking at this subjectfor the first time.It's not just the movie industry that has a monopoly on 9/11 imagery, however.There are examples of PP symbolism in American professional wrestling matches.And as further evidence that all aspects of the entertainment business are ownedand directed by the same forces, the music game played its part in subliminallypreparing the world for what it knew was to come.One of the key albums in the discography of Jay-Z, the Illuminati's key asset inthe corporate hip-hop world, was 'The Blueprint.' Its release date just happenedto be 11th September 2001. Most albums get released on a Monday, whereas thiswas a Tuesday. The reason given was that the release date was moved back fromthe following week to 'combat bootlegging.' Well, that's that all sorted then.The US author and researcher known as Isaac Weishaupt, (tongue-in-cheek wordplaybased around Adam Weishaupt, the founder of the Bavarian Illuminati in 1776!)points out some date significance from Jay-Z's other two 'Blueprint' albums inhis great book 'Sacrifice: Magic Behind The Mic'. 'The Blueprint 2: The Gift &The Curse' was released on 12th November 2002, he explains, which just happenedto be the day that a video tape of Osama Bin Laden was said to have beendiscovered containing his 'admission' to orchestrating the 9/11 attacks. (If youever want any tips on preserving your youth, by the way, Osama's your man. Inthe succession of videos that appeared in the post 9/11 years, he getsprogressively younger and his beard progressively blacker with every newappearance. What's his secret, goddamit?!) November 12th was also the date in2013 when New York's newly-constructed One World Trade Centre building wasannounced as the tallest building in the US.It was back to 9/11 for the release of the 'Blueprint 3' album, meanwhile, on11th September 2009. Weishaupt reminds us that this was around the time thatJay-Z was seen sporting a sweatshirt with the favourite Aleister Crowley phrase'Do What Thou Wilt' emblazoned across it. Countless researchers have drawnparallels with Crowley's works and the strange, esoteric aspects of September11th – particularly the fact that the numbers 9 and 11 figure majorly inCrowley's teachings. Many are of the view that the entire 9/11 spectacle was amassive dark occult ritual on a scale the world had never seen before.,incorporating numerology and Saturnic death cult symbolism. The author S. K.Bain has an excellent book entitled 'The Most Dangerous Book In The World; 9/11As Mass Ritual,' which comes highly recommended to anyone wishing to delvehead-first into the more sinister aspects of 9/11 symbolism.A couple of Busta Rhymes' albums in the late 90s, 'When Disaster Strikes' and'Extinction Level Event,' seemed to show a new-found fascination withlarge-scale chaotic events. And why did Busta add the line 'there's only fiveyears left' to the lyrics of his track 'Everything Remains Raw,' released in1996?It wasn't just in the years and months immediately prior to 9/11 that musicindustry foreshadowing occurred, however. There are now some very alertresearchers whose work has been facilitated exponentially by the internet, andbarely a trick gets past some of the more on-the-ball observers. The work ofthese people has enabled a widespread understanding of the techniques ofPredictive Programming. I've no idea what led to someone reversing the sleeveartwork to the British AOR group Supertramp's 'Breakfast In America' album from1979, but a very interesting phenomenon occurs when you do. The image, designedby one Mike Doud, depicts Lower Manhattan as seen from an aeroplane window, witha waitress in place of the Statue Of Liberty. The word 'Supertramp' appears overthe Manhattan skyline complete with WTC twin towers. When the image ismirror-reversed, however, the U and P of 'Supertramp,' partially obscured by thetowers, now appear to have become a 9 and an 11.If this reference is too ambiguous and unconvincing for some, I'd invite them todebunk the sleeve to an album entitled 'Party Music' by a little-knownCalifornian rap duo called The Coup. The original design features the pairparaded in front of the twin towers which are exploding in exactly the samemanner as we saw on 9/11. As Pam The Funkstress drums, Boots Riley is seenpressing what looks like a kind of remote-control detonator. The album wasscheduled for release in early September 2001. Post 9/11, this sleeve design waspulled by the group's label, Warner Brothers, and never made the stores. Thealbum eventually appeared in November of that year with a new sleeve showing ahand holding a cocktail glass. Group frontman Boots Riley has said that heconceived the twin towers design months earlier, and that it was intended as astatement against capitalism. Either this is one of the wildest examples ofcoincidence in the history of popular culture, or there's more to the sleeve'sbackground than Riley is letting on.On the subject of 9/11 foreknowledge, meanwhile, if anyone has any answer as tohow the musician Prince seemed to know what was coming back in December 1998, asevidenced by comments made at one of his live shows, I'd love to hear it. Heended one of his overseas concerts of that year with the words: \"We got onemore, then we gotta get out. I gotta go home, y'all. I gotta go home to America.I gotta go get ready for the bombs. Osama Bin laden gettin' ready to bomb,yeah.\" This could have been dismissed as a spontaneous and topical comment –particularly as Bin Laden had been indicted for orchestrating the 1995 bombingin Oklahoma City just the previous month – had it not been followed by thephrase ''2001 – hit me!\"(Of course, the fact that Bin Laden had nothing to do with the attacks isneither here nor there. The plan to pin 9/11 on him is likely to have alreadybeen in place in 1998.)The only options here as far as I can see are that: 1. It was a humorous quipbased on Prince's previous references to 'the bomb' in such songs as '1999', andthat the '2001' reference was random and just happened to end up being highlyportentous. Or 2. Prince moved in such social circles as to have obtained insideknowledge of what was to come from those who were in a position to know, and the'2001' reference was highly valid. Who can know for sure?I also find it interesting that, of all the years in which Arthur C Clarke andStanley Kubrick could have chosen to base their futuristic sci-fi epic '2001: ASpace Odyssey,' it just happened to be the year of the 9/11 attacks. The moviewas released in 1968, the year that construction of the World Trade Center'sNorth Tower began.9/11 pre-knowledge theories are exacerbated by accounts of several celebritieswho were scheduled to be on one of the doomed flights, but ended up not flyingfor one reason or another. Among these are said to be actor Mark Wahlberg,singer Patti Austin, Leighanne Littrell, actress and wife of Backstreet BoyBrian Littrell, Seth MacFarlane, creator of 'Family Guy' and 'American Dad,' andMichael Jackson. To be fair, it's unclear how true these claims are, and whetherthey may in fact be urban myths, but I feel they're worth throwing into the mixof strange 9/11-related questions nonetheless.Michael Jackson's 9/11 links don't end there, either. On the sleeve to his 1997remix album 'Blood On The Dancefloor: HIStory In the Mix,' Jackson is pictureddancing on a black and white-chequered floor, with a city in the backdrop whichlooks a lot like Manhattan engulfed in dust. (In further symbolic curiosities,meanwhile, the design of the tiled floor is that which is found in Masonictemples, representing the duality between light and dark/ good and evil/ nightand day, etc. Black and white designs are also said to be mind-control triggers.Jackson is wearing a blood-red suit, which is the principal colour associatedwith Saturn, the planet of death worshipped by the dark occult priest class.'Blood on the dancefloor' is taken to be a barely-concealed reference to Masonicritual sacrifice.EVERY CLOUD . . . The insane chemtrailing/ geo-engineering agenda that's now blighting skies theworld over also seems to have been foreshadowed using this tried-and-testedmethod. These days, the reinforcement that skies criss-crossed with clouds oftoxic chemicals from dawn, followed by a 'white-out' and a blocking out ofdirect sunlight a few hours later is totally normal, is hammered home by thedrawing in of chemtrailed skies into children's story books and cartoons, and onto packets of breakfast cereals like Weetabix. The Met Office and the TV weatherforecasts also pretend they don't exist, when anyone with a pair of eyes and aneck that tilts upwards can see for sure that they do. But in 1984, an episodeof the popular sci-fi series 'Dr. Who' made by the BBC, (surely not?!) includeda very interesting line of dialogue. In episode 2 of 'The Caves Of Androzani,'(which introduced actor Peter Davidson to the Doctor role,) the character knownas Morgus utters the phrase: \"as they used to say on Earth, every cloud has astrontium lining.\" Given that strontium has been identified as one of the mainmetal particulates of chemtrails, is it beyond the realms of possibility thatthis was a sly and knowing nod to the widespread agenda that was known to becoming the following decade? You can listen to the clip by scrolling 10 minutesand 44 seconds into the video at the following link, (assuming it hasn't sincebeen taken down amidst the usual bollocks about 'breaching terms of use'!) * http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2464uf_doctor-who-the-caves-of-androzani-2-4_shortfilms [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2464uf_doctor-who-the-caves-of-androzani-2-4_shortfilms]TERROR ON DEMANDThe PP agenda in movies has been stepped up majorly in recent years, and forpretty much every 'terror' event in the 'news,' there has been at least onemajor depiction of what was to come in a blockbuster movie or cartoon.In the Batman film 'The Dark Knight Rises,' the camera hovers for a second overa map of Gotham City, on which the place name 'Sandy Hook' has been circled. Thefilm was released in July 2012, five months before 'lone nut' Adam Lanza is saidto have shot 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School inNewtown, Connecticut. Research from the Infowars.com [http://Infowars.com]website revealed that in the earlier movie 'Batman Begins,' a similar map ofGotham City can be seen. In this version, however, the area in question is named'South Hinkley' and not Sandy Hook.This particular movie gets two bites of the PP cherry, however. During amidnight screening in Aurora, Colorado on 20th July 2012, a gunman is reportedto have burst into the theatre and opened fire on the audience, killing 12people and injuring a further 70. This is said to have occurred at the precisemoment that a trailer was showing for the movie 'Gangster Squad,' in whichgunmen are depicted firing machine guns through the movie screen at theaudience.The blame for this was placed on another 'lone nut,' one James Holmes. But theamount of anomalies surrounding the official version of what happened are sonumerous that they almost warrant a book in themselves. Conveniently, the gunmanwas reported to have been wearing a gasmask, obscuring his facial features.There's also the small matter of the individual appearing in court, with hairdyed orange like The Joker in the film, being an entirely different person tothe one in the identity photo of 'James Holmes' paraded by the mainstream media.More mind games being played at a bewildered general public's expense.There's even a third strand to this particular one, which is where the firstexample of a music video comes in. In the promo for the piece of toxic audiogarbage titled 'My Homies Still' by the rapper (it says here) Lil' Wayne, thereis a scene entirely unrelated to the song's content, where Wayne is depicted ina movie theatre surrounded by 12 skeletons. (How many people are said to havebeen killed in the Aurora shooting again?) 'My Homies Still' was released on 5thJune 2012, 45 days before the Aurora incident. In further symbolic links to theBatman movie, meanwhile, the rest of the video is full of bat-related imagery,including a girl in a leather Batman mask, and rappers (it says here) Lil Wayneand Big Sean hanging upside-down from the ceiling in a bat-like manner. None ofthese scenes have any connection to the lyrics of the song, of which here's anexample:\"Man, fuck ya'll with a sick dick, Semi automatic no click click,We don't feel you like an elephant, gettin' fucked with a tick dick,Little nigga with a thick bitch, and before I fuck this bitch,I gotta put that patch over my third eye, Slick Rick.\"Interesting reference to putting a 'patch over my third eye,' don't you think?As for the rest of the song's meaning, answers on a postcard. This is what thekids are getting down to these days, apparently.As a final aside, Wikipedia's entry on the 'My Homies Still' video tells us:\"(It) begins with several shots of white mannequins holding various poses, somewith missing limbs . . . After a panda is shown dancing, the elephant thenchanges colour to pink, and a man and dog are shown to have each-other's headssuperimposed onto each-others' bodies . . . Several female heads, (althoughstill seemingly alive,) appear as trophies on the wall.\"No more needs to be said for anyone who has read the previous chapter ondissociative mind-control!Following the Boston Marathon 'bombings' of 15th April 2013, (almost certainlyanother staged False-flag event using actors,) it didn't take sharp researcherslong to realise that the event seemed to have been predicted in a recent episodeof the cartoon 'Family Guy.' In one scene, the character Peter Griffin, 'winnerof the Boston Marathon,' is seen dressed in Muslim garb hitting a button on amobile phone, upon which two huge explosions are heard outside, the second oneaccompanied by screams. In a separate scene from the same episode, Griffin isseen mowing down other runners in a car at the finishing line of the marathon,echoing what we were told about the fate of one the Tsarnaev brothers in the'news.' Most clips of this episode that were posted to Youtube have beenconveniently removed due to 'copyright' issues, but you can still see one of theanalysis videos here: https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=wYdxWE_JF0Y[https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=wYdxWE_JF0Y]Other episodes of 'Family Guy' are said to have predicted elements of the 9/11and 7/7 attacks.The event said to have taken place in Woolwich, London, on 22nd May 2013involving an alleged soldier by the name of Lee Rigby being butchered by two'Islamic fundamentalists' (what else?), also appears to have been foreshadowed,and in a distinctly British way. The investigative filmmaker Tom Secker haspointed out that several aspects of the official Woolwich narrative weredepicted in Series 5 of the British TV drama 'Spooks,' created and screened bythe BBC, (surely not?!)Secker explains that several of the episodes feature a South East London-bornBritish Muslim convert of Nigerian descent – the exact background details ofMichael Adebolajo, Rigby's alleged attacker. In the 'Spooks' narrative, theMichael character has a white girlfriend, who gets co-opted by the British'intelligence' services to infiltrate the terror cell and become an informant.When she is discovered, she gets killed by means of a large kitchen knife. Thefemale character's name just happens to be Lee. The same Michael character alsocrops up in Series 6 of 'Spooks,' having now been recruited himself as aninformant. This series features another episode in which a character is murderedby way of a large knife. The BBC is a propaganda arm of the British government,and the idea that it could be working in league with security services such asM15 and M16 on mass mind-control agendas should surprise no-one who has beenpaying attention to what really goes on in the world.The fact that most, if not all of the 'real life' events above never actuallyhappened the way the official story maintains, and that most have been proven tobe faked using actors, doesn't detract from the validity of the PredictiveProgramming applied. The perpetrators rely on the public's acceptance of what'sbeing portrayed, regardless of whether it was 'real' or not. False-flag eventsare used to generate a reaction of fear and shock, and the notion from thepublic that 'something must be done.' This paves the way for the controllers toinstil a measure that suits their agenda – waging a foreign war, perhaps, theimposition of further public surveillance, or more restrictions on personalfreedoms in the name of 'terror prevention.' They would have a much harder timegaining public compliance for such measures had they not first justified theneed by way of a perceived threat.The nightly BBC 'news' is not to be outdone by works of fiction either, (eventhough what we're now asked to believe as 'news' crossed the boundary long ago.)There have been a handful of examples of the 'news' announcing stories beforethe details have occurred in reality. The BBC's coverage of 9/11, where reporterJane Standley is seen in front of the infamous Salomon Brothers building, betterknown as 'Building 7,' and announcing it as having collapsed several minutesbefore it actually did, has now passed into legend in conspiracy circles, and isvery much the smoking gun that proves complicity of the BBC and those thatcontrol it in the events of that day. That's unless you accept that she justhappened to get her story wrong, and it just happened to collapse unexpectedlyat odds of billions-to-one afterwards.In May 2015 we appeared to get more of the same, when the BBC reportedlyannounced the 'victory' of David Cameron's Conservative Party in the GeneralElection by beaming an image of the party's 316-seat majority on to the side ofBBC Broadcasting House in London, before the final count had officially beenannounced. This bolstered the claims of vast numbers of people that the electionwas rigged and that it had already been decided that Cameron's Conservativeswould get another term in office, regardless of how anyone may or may not havevoted.It's been going on forever, too. In 1898, a novel was written by MorganRobertson, 'Futility,' telling the story of an 'unsinkable' ocean liner namedThe Titan which collided with an iceberg in the North Atlantic in the month ofApril, and sank with huge loss of life, largely through there not being enoughlifeboats available. 14 years later, The Titanic sunk in circumstances uncannilysimilar to what had been depicted in the novel. (Conspiracy researchers willalso be quick tell you that the Titanic just happened to be carrying BenjaminGuggenheim, Isador Strauss, the head of Macy's department stores, and John JacobAstor, all three of whom were providing the main opposition to the creation ofthe US Federal Reserve. They all died in April 1912. In December of thefollowing year, the US Federal Reserve was instated.)Another extraordinary 'coincidence' appeared to come from the Pet Shop Boys''King's Cross,' a track from their 1987 album 'Actually.' It was released twomonths before a massive fire devastated the London train station of the samename, killing 31 people and injuring over 100 more. Although the officialaccount of the lyrics was that they referred to 'desperation and unemployment,'they appeared to eerily foreshadow the disaster, with lines like:\"Only last night I found myself lost,by the station called King's Cross,Dead and wounded on either side,You know it's only a matter of time.\"What were the chances?'UNCANNY SIMILARITIES'During the writing of this chapter, another classic example occurred, straightin at number one on the Top Of The Psy-Ops Hit Parade. In March 2015, aGermanwings Airbus A320 was reported to have crashed into the French Alps on aflight from Barcelona to Dusseldorf, killing all 150-plus on board. Themainstream media quickly ran with the story of how the 28-year-old co-pilot,Andreas Lubitz, had been suffering depression, and decided to take his own lifealong with those of everyone else on the flight. He used an opportune momentwhen the pilot left the cockpit to lock himself in, and deliberately steer theplane towards the ground. We're told that the pilot and some passengers tried invain to break the door down moments before it crashed.A couple of days later, a UK 'Daily Mail' article appeared, detailing the'uncanny similarities' between this event and the plotline of an Argentinianfilm that had been released weeks before, entitled 'Wild Tales.' The first ofthe movie's six short stories, intended as a black comedy, involves a pilotinviting several people with whom he had grievances – including a lover whojilted him and a troublesome work colleague – on to a flight, then deliberatelycrashing the plane into the ground, killing himself and everyone on board. Heachieves this by locking himself in the cockpit. In panic, a passenger is seenattempting to break the door down. Although the film had yet to be released inBritain, it had already been shown in the US, and in Spain and Germany, thedeparture and arrival ports of the Germanwings flight. Of course, the 'DailyMail' article put the similarities down to another of those 'amazingcoincidences.'It wasn't long until there was more of the same. The movie 'Kingsmen: The SecretService', one of the most blatant pieces of Establishment propaganda ever passedoff as 'entertainment,' featured a scene in which Colin Firth's secret agentcharacter, in a mind-controlled state, slaughters the entire congregation of achurch. The fact that the mutilation is shown in jerky CGI to give it a comicveneer, and that the general public just passively accepts such things as'entertainment,' shows the depths to which our collective morals have alreadysunk. A few weeks later came the news of the mass shooting at a largely blackchurch in Charleston, South Carolina, where yet another 'lone nutter,' DylannRoof, was said to have slaughtered nine people in what many researchers haveconcurred was a staged exercise as part of the US government's ongoing attemptsto disarm its citizens, and to create further racial hostilities in America.Different event, same tactics, no imagination.KNOCK BEFORE ENTERINGIt becomes clear that the powers-that-shouldn't be not only plan their movesyears (and sometimes even decades and centuries) in advance, but also love toencode their intentions into works of popular culture. Effectively, they tellthe truth to the subconscious mind which doesn't have the capacity to properlyprocess the information. They then lie blatantly to the conscious mind. It'stheir way of trying to cheat the karmic consequences of Natural Law, by, as theysee it, giving the public the opportunity to object to what they plan to do,then taking it as tacit approval or implied consent to go right ahead whennobody calls them out on it. Of course, it's a sick, twisted way of looking atit, as no-one could reasonably be expected to have interpreted the clues untilafter the event happens. What's the likelihood of anyone seeing the Lil' Waynevideo, for instance, and going \"Hey! Wait a minute! That split-second cinemascene tells me they're planning to stage a shooting in a movie theatre during ascreening of the Batman movie, then use it to try and tighten US gun laws andstrip Americans of yet more personal freedoms. I'm not having that!\" Who are yousupposed to write to should you figure this out? And the very idea that you cansomehow cheat laws set in place by the creative force behind the universe isegotisic arrogance of the first degree . . . but then we are talking aboutdemented psychopaths here.In an interview with John Gibbons on his 'Alchemy Radio' podcast in July 2014,Irish researcher Thomas Sheridan went into the reasons why revealing theirtactics is all part of the dark controllers' methods:\"Telling us is part of the magic. We have to consent. That's why they blow thewhistle on what they do through all kinds of books and movies and so on. Andthey'll often show us a hint of things before they do them. And this is howtheir sorcery, their black, hexan paganism works. You have to be told.\"This is why Dracula always knocked on the door and asked to be let in . . . TheDevil has to be invited in. Then you've forfeited your right to say 'I was takenby surprise.' No, you brought it in. This is why we all have to learn whatthey're doing to us, we have to learn wordplay, we have to learnneuro-linguistic programming. Because the only thing that's keeping them inpower is our acquiescence to their pathological drive. And the best weapon wehave against them is our refusal.\"In the movie 'The Exorcist', Linda Blair's Regan character only gets possessedby the demonic entity after she's messed about with a ouija board she found inthe cellar. Although Regan didn't fully understand what she was doing, this wasthe entity's 'invitation.' Without it, it could not have entered into her.In 'The Wicker Man', it is stated that Edward Woodward's policeman character isfair game as a human sacrifice purely because he came to the island of his ownfree will, (albeit having been coerced into looking for an apparently 'missing'girl.) He wasn't forced. He made the choice. Here are two films subtly conveyingthe implications of consenting in their narratives.Some further insight came from Mark Passio on his 'What On Earth Is Happening'radio show on Republic Broadcasting Network in October 2014:\"The societies that were planning this whole agenda, and had been planning thisevent (9/11) for decades before this, were using all kinds of occult symbolismand numerology in this event. They stick to this plan and they're verypredictable in this regard. They love their symbolism. They love playing withnumbers. They love putting this out into other peoples' faces.\"One of the dark principles of their ideological tenets is that, if you tellpeople what you're doing, even if it's telling them wordlessly through symbolsor numbers, then you have somehow gotten their implied consent, because theyhaven't said no. And to not say no is to tacitly say yes in their mentality. Sothat, in their mind, relieves the burden of karma that would ordinarily comedown upon them for directing these actions, (because they don't actually takethese actions, they get their order-following house slave dogs to do it forthem.) In their mind, because they told you in a wordless, occult way, then insome way that alleviates the karma, because they did say it in some form. It's asick, twisted way of looking at it.\"The veteran researcher Michael Hoffman expressed these same ideas in morescholarly fashion in a lecture he delivered in 1987, entitled 'The OccultPhilosophy:'\"The fallacy of even independent researchers is that, exposure per se of themethods and personnel involved in the cryptocracy's crimes is an ultimate goal.If only we could get some of these facts out into the open, runs the refrain.\"I would reply to that notion that the cryptocracy is not stagnant. It isengaged in a remarkable process set into motion centuries ago, an operationwhich has accomplished most, if not all of its chief goals with awe-inspiringdespatch already. In the beginning and middle stages of this operation, secrecywas a key to accomplishing these goals. Generally speaking, that secrecy is nolonger necessary today. Quite the contrary.\"The cryptocracy has actually been determined to reveal many of its greatestsecrets to we profane ones for some time now, but very few have noticed.\"When you come to understand this underlying need to let us know what they'redoing, it makes sense of so many of the control system's tactics. This is whythey always announce foreign wars via the mainstream media before going off toinvade another country. From their point of view, they've told us theirintentions; now they can steam right in. This is why ingredients are listed ondistinctly unhealthy food and drink items, and in toxic vaccines. You mightthink it would suit their purpose more to avoid telling people that braincell-destroying Aspartame is included in soft drinks aimed at kids, or that avaccine contains such delights as aborted human foetus, monkey brain tissue andformaldehyde, but they go right ahead and reveal it. (To be fair, these horrorsin vaccines are generally hidden under some multi-syllabled scientific name, buttheir true nature can still be discovered by anyone vigilant enough to do theresearch.) It's why fat, sugar and starch content and calorie quantities areincluded on supermarket food labels, alcohol content listed on liquor, andwarnings about the possibility of lung cancer on cigarette packets. You can'tsay you weren't told.By the same token, this is why 'side effects,' (so, 'effects,' then) ofpharmaceutical drugs have to be listed on the leaflets that come with them. Ifyou contract one of them, you were told it could happen, and they're no longerliable for the free-will choice you made to take it. It's the reason you can'tget a mobile phone package or a credit card without signing a contractconsisting of several pages of small print disclaimers that benefit thecorporation rather than the individual, and absolve them of any responsibilityin the event of a situation arising. It's the reason we have to be told thatCCTV is in operation on buses or in public buildings, or why we have to bewarned that speed cameras are in operation on roads, and of what the speed limitis before you can be issued with a speeding ticket. It's why we're told inadvance that taxes are going to go up, or new ones are to be introduced. Thedisclaimers that the manipulators feel allow them to be let off the karmic hookare everywhere you look. Tacit approval and implied consent are the constantname of the game.It does appear to be the case, however, that in instances where no 'contract' assuch has been entered into, they give the opportunity for an opt-out. It wouldappear to be an extension of the courtesy of revealing their intent in encodedform, by giving those who are alert enough to realise what they're doing theopportunity to say 'no thanks.' This is why, when the new glut of full-radiationbody scanners were introduced to US airports in the post-9/11 years, travellerswere given the option of avoiding them by announcing they wished to opt out andundergo a thorough groping by TSA officials instead. Taking this option reliedupon the individual being sufficiently well-informed to know about thedetrimental health effects of the machines, of course, which is why most peoplestill obediently walk through them when coerced into doing so. This concept of'opting out' is even expressed when police officers read you your 'rights.'(This is a fallacy in itself, since true rights under Natural Law can only begranted by the creative force behind the universe and not by any man or woman.)By informing you that 'anything you say can and will be used in evidence againstyou,' they're absolving themselves of any burden of responsibility by (as theysee it,) putting the onus on to the individual. It's their idea of having givenyou 'fair warning' of their intent and sufficient opportunity to neglect toconsent. There is a very real sense in which the famous phrase 'silence isconsent' applies. For as long as we demonstrate no opposition to what's beingdone to us, (and with no excuse for claiming 'I didn't know' when we're livingin the age of the most abundant availability of information humanity has everknown via the internet!) there is a very real sense in which we deserve what weget. Although there will be individual exceptions, the will and the principle ofcare is not present enough on a collective basis, and so we reap the collectiveresults that we are all experiencing.Understanding the concepts of consent and free-will approval, and the extent towhich the powers-that-shouldn't-be recognise they are bound by it, is where ourtrue power lies. If we, in our colossal numbers, make it abundantly clear thatwe do not in any way consent to the systems of slavery, oppression and violationthat they foist upon us, I feel some very interesting results could manifest.Without our approval, they would stand in full judgement for the crimes theycommit against humanity. They know this. Their understanding that they would betaking on the full karmic consequence for actions which they alone chose, wouldpresent a very different state of affairs to the one we currently have. Thisshift can only be achieved through vast numbers of people understanding deeplythe methods (such as those outlined in this book) that are being used againstus, which is why communicating this information is essential to human freedom.Great truths are often encoded into works of popular culture such as Hollywoodmovies, whose surface narratives can appear dismissively trivial. In the film'The Truman Show' starring Jim Carrey, his controller Christof states: “He(Truman) could leave at any time. If his was more than just a vague ambition, ifhe was absolutely determined to discover the truth, there’s no way we couldprevent him.\" Another reminder that everything we experience is down tofree-will choices, either on a microcosmic, or personal level, or the choicesthat we make collectively as a species on a macrocosmic level.For a human to have their free-will consciousness hijacked and manipulated is torender them as nothing more than an unthinking flesh robot, and this isprecisely the dynamic which is occurring with millions of people on the planetwithout their knowledge. Freedom is all about breaking the dark magician'sspell. Once you understand how an illusionist performs their tricks, you'llnever be fooled by them again. So it is with the tactics used in theentertainment industry. Once it's out of the confines of the subliminal mind,and into the conscious, the manipulations no longer work. More people need to bemade consciously aware of how they're being duped. When you're no longer makingany kind of unwitting energetic connection with the agenda, more discerningchoices can be made.Our very own minds are being used as weapons against us. But we can change itany time we choose. As the late, great Bill Hicks remarked so potently, 'it'sjust a choice.'"},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:9/11 Predictive Programming in Hollywood movies and TV shows: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=IzLDxP3Qrzs [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=IzLDxP3Qrzs] * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=Rd-zOMb3REU [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=Rd-zOMb3REU] * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=roE0sJktfBY [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=roE0sJktfBY] * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=rnf7hQE6leU [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=rnf7hQE6leU] * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=63OdK8ZcrrY [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=63OdK8ZcrrY] * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=OpYWt8yJAoI [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=OpYWt8yJAoI]The Coup's Boots Riley speaks out about 9/11: * http://www.daveyd.com/bootsonthewarpolitics.html [http://www.daveyd.com/bootsonthewarpolitics.html]Family Guy Predicts Boston, 9/11 & 7/7 London Attacks Weeks in Advance: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=wYdxWE_JF0Y [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=wYdxWE_JF0Y]Tom Secker talks with Alex G on the BBC's 'Spooks' Predictive Programming of 7/7and Woolwich: * http://www.investigatingtheterror.com/audio/The_War_on_Terror_in_the_UK_and_Africa___A_conversation_with_Alex_G.html [http://www.investigatingtheterror.com/audio/The_War_on_Terror_in_the_UK_and_Africa___A_conversation_with_Alex_G.html]Prince: 'Osama Bin Laden gettin' ready to bomb': * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=KzC_GNaf12o [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=KzC_GNaf12o]Daily Mail: Outrage over the release of Oscar-nominated movie showing member ofaircrew locking himself in cockpit to crash a plane and kill everyone on board: * http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3014631/Questions-raised-release-Oscar-nominated-movie-showing-member-aircrew-locking-cockpit-crash-plane-kill-board.html [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3014631/Questions-raised-release-Oscar-nominated-movie-showing-member-aircrew-locking-cockpit-crash-plane-kill-board.html]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13MINDS AND MACHINESMusic's role in normalising the Transhumanist agenda.'Just beneath the skin, you will hardly know it's in,Push a button if you want to know our names,Invented in the labs, to keep the low life under tabs,Something tells me that there is another aim.'Imani Hekima: 'Just Beneath The Skin' (2011)'Can't you see, they're trying to plug into our minds,Trick us with technology and keep us all confined,Can't you see the signs, we're running out of time.'Nate Featuring Dark Matter: 'Tricknology' (2014)'In the year 5555,Your arms hangin' limp at your sides,Your legs got nothin' to do,Some machine's doin' that for you.'Zager & Evans: 'In The Year 2525' (1969)INSTANT ROBOT; MIX WELLIn 1998, US singer Cher released a single entitled 'Believe.' It was the charthit and karaoke favourite it was always destined to be owing to its catchy hookand commercially-orientated production. There was something very distinctiveabout it, though. Cher's vocals sounded very strange and robotic when she hitthe chorus. It was the first time the general public had heard the phenomenon ofAuto-Tune.The technique was developed by California-based Antares Audio Technologies, acompany founded by a former geo-physicist by the name of Dr. Harold 'Andy'Hildebrand, who had used sound waves to map oil wells. The company's websitepoints out that it became the largest-selling audio plug-in of all-time shortlyafter its release in 1997.Auto-Tune is an audio production method which digitises a human voice, allowingfor its automated manipulation. The reason given for its invention is that itallows a singer's voice to hit required notes and tempos with precision. Therequired notes can be pre-programmed, and the voice is then pitched up or downthe scale to hit them spot-on, over-riding any shortcomings on the part of thevocalist. The Wikipedia entry on Auto-Tune describes the process as follows:\"Auto-Tune can also be used as an effect to distort the human voice when pitchis raised or lowered significantly. The overall effect to the discerning ear canbe described as hearing the voice leap from note to note stepwise, like asynthesizer.\"It strikes me that there's an obvious response to this explanation. It's just athought, but the music industry could always employ singers who are skilledenough to be able to hit required notes themselves, without the aid of plug-intechnology, and any singers unable to achieve this could be sent away topractice until they can. Can't help thinking that this would be a more sensiblesolution to the problem that Auto-Tune was apparently devised to rectify? Iguess I shouldn't be too surprised though, given that the same concept oftechnology compensating for questionable human skill is now prevalent throughoutthe DJ-ing profession. Software packages such as Serato and Traktor now comewith a function known as a 'sync button.' This allows for two tunes being playedoff a laptop to have their tempos and beats automatically detected, then to bemixed together seamlessly with no manual input required. An entire generation ofyoung 'DJs' are now being conditioned to accept this as the 'normal' way ofmaking a set flow, rendering them to the status of a machine operative, ratherthan any kind of artist. It's a testament to how fickle human nature can be, andto the short attention spans in the instant culture in which we now live, thatmany DJs couldn't wait to ditch the vinyl and embrace this 'cool' new digitaltechnology when it first appeared . . . but that now, a few years down the line,we're witnessing a nostalgic hankering towards real vinyl again and a resurgencein its output, as if laptop DJ-ing is now old-hat and the fashionistas arelooking for the next big thing . . . even if in this case that means the lastbig thing.Either way, the Cher tune was proudly trumpeted as an example of this great newmethod of production. There was a small drawback in that it stripped anysemblance of humanity out of her voice, making it akin to Stephen Hawking'selectronic voicebox. But that didn't seem to matter to anyone at the time, suchwas the novelty value of this new phenomenon. No-one then could have had anyclue as to the proliferation of Auto-Tune, (known popularly as 'the Cher effect'in its early days,) that was due to engulf mainstream music the followingdecade. Nor how this seemingly innocent and random phenomenon could be connectedto a much wider, and extremely sinister plan.Welcome to the music industry's part in the Transhumanist agenda.MAN AND MACHINE: AN UNHOLY ALLIANCETranshumanism is the merging of humanity with technology. For decades, there hasbeen a fascination within the 'elite' class of tinkering with the natural stateof what it is to be human – their way of asserting what they psychopathicallyconsider to be their god-like status – and this goes some way to explainingtheir reverence towards, and fascination for technology. The dark priest classhave revealed in their own writings how they fantasise about a society mergingits innate human qualities with technological 'improvements.' This is one of thecentral tenets of the New World Order. It sounds like the stuff of sciencefiction films, for sure, but hopefully the previous chapter on the workings ofPredictive Programming will have gone some way towards explaining why that wouldbe.The plans that the 'elites' have for themselves and those reserved for the restof us are rather different, however. They appear to believe that Transhumanismholds the key to immortality on their part. Experiments involving implants anddrugs on military subjects have already produced what are known as 'supersoldiers' – humans whose natural functions have been so artificially alteredthat they can go for days without food, water or sleep, are impervious to pain,and display the superhuman strength of comic-book heroes. These are thequalities that the dark controllers seemingly wish to retain for themselves intheir quest to go way beyond the regular mortality of humans.For the slave population, however, (that's you and me,) all the evidence pointstoward a different plan. Here, the aim is to have microchips and brain implantsinserted into the population, for remote tracking and mind-control purposes.Attempts have already been made to routinely chip babies as soon as they areborn, but these have been met with the suspicious resistance they deserve on thepart of parents . . . so far. To get the public mindset used to the idea and topresent it as a benign and beneficial thing, pet dogs have been already beengetting chipped for years, the RFID signal linked to satellite trackers with thesentiment that 'you need never lose Fido again.' There has been a big push inrecent times to extend this method to patients with dementia, with the helpfulsuggestion that if they should happen to wander off in their pyjamas in themiddle of the night, they can be easily traced.Chipping has become routine in certain facets of the military, whose staff arealways the first in line for any new biological experimentation, and somecorporations are now following suit, making it mandatory for staff to be chippedas condition of their employment. All on the grounds of 'safety' and 'security',naturally. One such establishment has been the Epicenter hi-tech business blockin Sweden, where staff of tenant companies have had to have RFID chips installedunder their skin to open office doors and even use the copier. Hannes Sjoblad,who carries the curious title of Chief Disruption Officer at the company whichmade the chips, was quoted as saying: “we already interact with technology allthe time. Today it’s a bit messy – we need PIN codes and passwords. Wouldn’t itbe easy to just touch with your hand? That’s really intuitive.”Right on script, Hannes.Upon first hearing, the idea of 'improving' oneself with technology will be anappealing prospect for many – particularly those with left brain-imbalancedscientific minds. A good example of this is Kevin Warwick, Professor ofCybernetics at Reading University in England. His website biog describes him as'carrying out research in artificial intelligence, control, robotics andbiomedical engineering.' He has been a highly vocal advocate of microchips beinginserted into humans and has undergone the process himself, proudly proclaimingthat he has had a device implanted into the median nerves of his left arm tolink his nervous system directly to a computer, and that he was responsible forthe first purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of twohumans.Warwick is either entirely down with the elite agenda, or is what is referred toas a 'useful idiot' – someone oblivious to the big picture, but whose workcontributes conveniently towards it. Either way, the plan for a microchippedpopulation remains high on the wish-list of the social engineers. As with allthings, however, they realise that were they to try and introduce such a drasticmeasure overnight, it would likely meet with strong resistance, such is thehuman mind's in-built aversion to sudden change. What they have long-sinceperfected, therefore, is a slow and gradual process of incrementalism, a methoddescribed by David Icke as 'The Totalitarian Tiptoe.' This advocates makingsmall changes in progressive steps over extended periods of time. Each stepgradually moves you closer to your end goal, but covertly enough so as not toraise attention. It has been described allegorically as the 'frog in a pot'syndrome; put a frog into a pot of boiling water and it'll jump straight out. Ifyou put it into a lukewarm pot, however, and slowly turn up the temperature instages, the changes will be so subtle that the frog won't notice it's beingslowly boiled alive.And so it has been with the desire towards Transhumanism. And the extent towhich the Totalitarian Tiptoe has been in place was brought home to me a whileback when thinking about the changes in society that have taken place in justthe last 20 years. These apply to my homeland of the UK, but will be familiar toreaders in pretty much any other country.Let's take 1996 as a starting point. In that year, very few people had mobilephones, and the internet was still in its infancy. The majority of people whoowned PCs would not have been using them to access the internet at that point.Broadband phone lines were yet to be unleashed, the limited amount of internetconnections being achieved by tragically slow dial-up modems. E-mail was verymuch in its infancy, with most business communications still being done by faxor letter.In 1996, you could still get a landline phone number, with a geographicaldialling code, for the local branch of your bank. You could still phone yourelectricity or gas company and have the phone answered by a human being. (And inthe same country as you, too – how about that?!) You could tell the personanswering the phone what you were calling for, rather than having to developAlzheimer's or reincarnate several times waiting for a menu read out by acheerfully-voiced computer to end. You could still go to a supermarket and haveyour groceries checked-out by a human cashier, rather than being coerced to scanthem on a machine and pack them yourself.To watch television, you required a television with an aerial connector. Theend. As everything ran on analogue signals, digital set-top boxes and theadditional wiring involved, was unnecessary. Drivers actually used to be able tofind their way from point A to point B utilising map-reading skills inconjunction with a good road atlas, rather than being instructed in which way togo by their car. They could also exercise their judgement in deciding when toput their windscreen wipers on for themselves, and unlocked their car by puttinga key in the lock and turning it. Somehow kids managed to get from one end ofthe day to the other without ringtones, Instagram or Snapchat and didn't losetheir minds when they were unable to pick up a wi-fi network to update theirFacebook status every half-hour.All of these major changes to daily life have occurred in less than 20 years,and a glance at the 'then' and 'now' scenarios is a master study in how theTotalitarian Tiptoe works. The technology involved has transformed human societybeyond recognition in most countries around the world. A time-traveller from asrecent as 1996 teleporting to present day would be left baffled as to what wasgoing on. And yet, because it has happened in small steps over an extendedperiod, and because each societal change has been presented as something that is'great' for us, it has been readily accepted and absorbed the way the architectsalways knew it would be. Does anyone really believe it's just coincidence thatall major supermarkets adopted self-scan checkouts at the same time as all majorcorporations adopted automated phone systems? Or that the only factor drivingthe changes is 'cost-effectiveness?' Is the fact that some restaurants nowcovertly record their customers' conversations all for their own 'safety,' andis fitting cars with tracking devices at the factory really just about'efficiency?'There are many of my generation who can remember clearly the days before 1996when our daily operations were much simpler and more organic. But 40 years fromnow, as we die out, the majority of the world's population will only ever haveknown a life dominated by computerised machines.Nobody is denying that technology has a positive role to play in some aspects ofour lives. Of course, numerous examples could be cited of the genuine benefitsto humanity that the world of science has brought. This has nothing to do withthe insidious and malevolent agenda being rolled out by the controlling forces,however.This complete remodelling of the way we humans interact with electronics inpretty much every aspect of our lives, has been slowly preparing uspsychologically for what's planned. This is the introduction of technologydesigned to interact with natural human functions, creating a human-machinehybrid, but with far more emphasis placed on the automated, machine-like aspectsthan the human ones.Hopefully anyone whose first instinct is to think it's truly astounding thatscience has come this far – rather like Kevin Warwick – will do some furtherresearch into what this agenda really entails, and why it's being so zealouslyfoisted upon us. Like every other manipulation in human society, from organisedreligion to the financial system, it's all about control and the perpetuation ofhuman slavery.The long-term plan, as the work of many researchers has highlighted, is to havea microchipped world population, linked, via remotely-controlled radio signals,to a central computer. David Icke went into the implications of such anarrangement at the hands of, shall we say, those who do not have humanity's bestinterests at heart, in his book 'The Perception Deception:'\"Google is the predominant player in the Transhumanist agenda, and technologylike Google Now is designed to track and manage every aspect of peoples' liveswith the ability to know if you are walking, driving or riding a bicycle, whenyou are at home, and able to recognise your voice patterns, which are anexpression of your unique vibrational signature. These stepping stones arepromoted as an 'ain't it great?' new gadget, when they are systematically takingpeople down a very dark and dangerous road. The modern Pied Piper has ditchedthe pipe for a Smartphone.\"Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said in 2013 that the company couldproduce artificial intelligence within five to ten years that would beindistinguishable from the human mind, (the enslaved human mind, that is.)Schmidt is obsessed with the Transhumanist agenda, and has described conceptslike sending a robotic clone of himself to social events and swallowingnano-technology to regulate his body. His desire for a society run by robots andTranshumanist technology is shared by so-called futurists such as Ray Kurzweil,who wants to see humans merged with machines and have a global societycontrolled by computer systems with an artificial intelligence that surpassesthat of the entire human race, (the enslaved minds of the human race.) Kurzweilis the director of engineering at . . . Google.\"And from Icke's earlier book, 'Human Race Get Off Your Knees:'\"We are now seeing 'eugenics: the final frontier,' with the emerging movementknown as Transhumanism. This is developing and promoting various controltechnologies like microchips, brain chips, brain-computer interfaces, cyborgsand nano-technology. Its advocates talk of 'upgrading' the race by implantingmore and more external technologies into the human body.\"The word 'Transhumanist' was first used by Julian Huxley, the eugenics fanatic.The Transhumanists push the benefits of improving health and intellect, but thereal idea is to create a master race that is part-human and part-machine.\"Anything that can be automated now is. Cars that drive themselves are now aphysical reality. Robots are now replacing warehouse workers, and a standardjoke in the DJ-ing industry is that human DJs won't be required in thenot-too-distant future. In a world where cars modify their speed according tothe volume of traffic their sensors detect around them, it surely won't be longbefore automated DJ systems intuit what tracks to play based on how busy itssensors detect the dancefloor to be. Maybe it won't all be so 'great' when largenumbers of people can't get jobs any more on the grounds that a robot can get itdone just as efficiently, and doesn't need pay, lunch breaks, sick days orholidays.We now also have the obsession with 'Smart' everything, from phones to meters.The idea behind a 'smart' network is very sinister, with devices linked toeach-other via an endless array of wi-fi networks, flooding the unseenmorphogenic field in which we live with disruptive electro-magnetic frequencies,and all the while relaying surveillance data back to a central computer. The UKhas now received the news that its first 'Smart' city to be configured in thisway is to be Glasgow, and there are now announcements that a stretch of the M6near Birmingham is to become its first 'smart motorway.' The only smart thingabout anything with 'smart' in its name is to give it the widest berth possible.(It's worth noting that 'smart' has multiple meanings, too. As well as meaning'clever', its dictionary definition is also given as \"to be the cause of asharp, stinging pain; as an irritating application, a blow, etc.\"Ray Kurzweil has also predicted that humans, (if they can still realistically bedescribed as such,) will even be able to have internet systems implanted intotheir heads so they can be organically attached to the worldwide web, and cansurf it by way of thoughtwaves, with the results displayed on a small screenimplanted into the cornea. The Google Glass invention, where being permanentlyand personally on-line was normalised, would appear to have been paving the wayfor this.While Google frequently eulogises about Transhumanist technology, co-founder ofthe Apple Corporation, Steve Wozniak, appeared to take a more guarded view in a2015 interview for the 'Australian Financial Review.' Apparently warning of thedangers of replacing humanity with Artificial Intelligence, he commented:'Computers are going to take over from humans, no question. If we build thesedevices to take care of everything for us, eventually they'll think faster thanus and they'll get rid of the slow humans to run companies more efficiently.\"The article goes on to quote Tesla Motors boss Elon Musk as stating that humanscould be banned from driving in years to come, with cars instead controlled byrobots. This gradual path is already being paved, with some cars now equippedwith cameras and programmed to automatically telephone the Police in the eventof an accident! The same article also tells of a hotel in China, Pengheng SpaceCapsules Hotel in Shenzhen, which is staffed and operated entirely by robots.The savings in staff costs apparently allow the hotel to offer rooms from aslittle as £6.80 a night.While anyone who has maintained the capacity to think for themselves wouldsurely reject the nightmare of a Transhumanist future, there are still many whohave been duped into a sense of awe at technological advances, presented as theyare with a 'wow!' factor attached. How else to explain the apparent enthusiasmof Australians to voluntarily take an RFID chip under their skin to makeelectronic payments, according to a 2015 story from 'The Business Insider'?\"A mind-boggling 25% of Australians say they are at least 'slightly interested'at the prospect of having a chip implanted in their skin that could be used forpayments, new research has found.\"The research by credit card company Visa and the University of TechnologySydney, found Australians are open to the prospect of paying for items usingwearable tech including smart watches, rings, glasses and even a connected car.\"Apparently, carrying a wallet or a couple of credit cards around has become areal problem. Which is convenient for the controllers as it has long been theplan to eventually ban cash payments in society, (a move recently introduced inSweden,) and to coerce the entire general public into taking such chips. On thisbasis people will not be able to pay for essential goods and services unlessthey are linked to a giant central computer via their unique electronic ID.Those whose first instinct is to think of this as 'really cool' might like toreflect on what would happen were they to somehow fall foul of the authorities,and have their eligibility to pay for essential products and services switchedoff? They might also like to picture a scenario where, should the Inland Revenueor any other government department decide that you owe them money, they canautomatically deduct it from your account and deal with all the questions later.(That's before you get into the technology where radio signals can betransmitted via embedded chips to remotely alter the brainwaves of the wearer,triggering emotional responses and mood changes. Chemicals can also be remotelyreleased into the bloodstream by way of appropriately-configured chips.)This hellish scenario can only transpire if people succumb to it through theirfree will, however. The resources do not exist to forcibly chip an entire worldpopulation if mass resistance is encountered. It's humanity's ultimate choice. Iwonder what the choice will be?The ugly face of the cashless society, along with biometrics, clashedspectacularly with the live music industry at the 2015 Download rock festival inLeicestershire, England. The event's organisers had already raised significantconcerns over their decision to introduce facial recognition scanning forcustomers, citing the tried-and-tested justification of 'reducing crime', (theyreally would be in trouble without that one to fall back on, wouldn't they?)They then added insult to injury by announcing a cashless payment system forfestival-goers, who would have to load credit in advance on to electronicwristbands known as 'dog tags,' (much slave symbolism there?), then have thesescanned by a network of electronic readers all over the site. The organiserscrowed proudly that \"not only will it reduce queues for the bar and food stalls,it removes the faff of cash and makes security on-site even tighter.\" This isthe exact blueprint for the cashless society that the elites want for nations atlarge, and Download would appear to have been a dry-run experiment, with theattendees as unwitting guinea-pigs, all the while paying for their ownexperimentation. Given what we've learned about how the dark controllers lovetheir symbolism, I guess we shouldn't be too surprised that the Download logoadvertising the wristbands shows a red devil's hand surrounded by fire flashingthe Baphomet/ horned hand symbol, with a blue wristband in place. There may beoptimism to be gained from the fact that the payment system was a monumentalfailure, however, with punters branding it 'useless,' 'a farce' and 'a completejoke.' Attendees complained of being forced to queue for hours for entry, to buyfood and drink, to check their balances and to top up their credit.There were similar glitches just a few weeks later with the cashless top-upsystem at the Digital Dreams Festival in Toronto. Notice how both events' nameshave electronic/ computer-related overtones.The 'Daily Mail' reported that European festivals have been using electronicwristbands for years, beginning with the Eurosonic Noorderslag Festival in theNetherlands in 2012. Glastonbury boss Michael Eavis is said to have brieflyconsidered the idea, but feared the technology would attract many externalcompanies making it 'too commercial.'AUTO-PAINAll of which brings us right back around to Auto-Tune, and the real reason it'sbeen so enthusiastically adopted by the corporate music industry. It can't bedown to just how great it sounds, after all. I've asked countless DJs andmusicians their opinions on the sound, and have yet to receive one commentpraising it. A rolling of the eyes and a stream of profanities is the usualreaction.Just like the techniques described in our earlier chapters, it's all targeted atthe suggestive subconscious mind – in this case, to bring about a more readyacceptance of human-electronic hybridization by making the merging of the twoseem completely normal.In the past, Auto-Tune has been confused with an earlier vocal synthesis systemknown as a vocoder, most popularly associated with the musician Roger Troutmanof the funk group Zapp. British producer Linslee Campbell once demonstrated tome the vocoder's workings when related to the human voice. He had a type ofharmonica in his mouth, connected to an electronic keyboard. He then spoke intothe vocoder and used the keys to manipulate the resulting sound. This is thecrucial difference between vocoders and Auto-Tune; the former at least stillinvolves a degree of creative human control!It's unlikely that Hildebrand and his Antares company created Auto-Tune with anymalevolent form of usage in mind, and more feasible that his creation was seizedupon to be incorporated into the Transhumanist mind game. Hildebrand is quotedas saying “we never thought anyone in their right mind would do that\" inresponse to how Auto-Tune was utilised on the Cher record. He did appear to getwith the programme later on though, by announcing a new software programme namedThroat Evo. This, according to the Antares website, \"processes voices through ameticulously crafted physical model of the human vocal tract,\" and \"allows thecreation of vocal tract models well beyond the limits of physical human anatomy,offering the possibility of vocal characteristics that are simply unattainableby any other means.\"I'd suggest they should remain unattained then. But that's just me.Following the Cher hit, little more was heard of Auto-Tune in popular musicuntil several years later. In 2005, an artist emerged on the so-called 'hip-hop'scene by the name of T-Pain, (I suspect the 'T' stands for 'tinnitus.') Hisdebut album, 'Rappa Ternt Sanga', utilised the technology to full effect,notably on the first two singles, 'I'm Sprung' and 'I'm In Love With AStripper'. It became T-Pain's trademark sound to the point that everything hehas ever released incorporates it, and he has become truly synonymous with theeffect, even to the point of boldly suggesting he should be paid royaltieswhenever the technique is used. In 2009 he collaborated on an iPhone appentitled 'I Am T-Pain' with the manufacturer Smule, allowing users to re-createhis vocal 'style' for karaoke purposes.Breaking through around the same time was the singer/ rapper Akon, who claimsthe dubious distinction of having 'discovered' T-Pain. Akon flooded songs fromhis second and third albums, 'Konvicted' and 'Freedom,' with the sound, as wellas a novelty excursion from his first album, entitled 'Lonely,' which truly hasto be heard to be believed. Within months, Auto-Tune was cropping up on themajority of hits in the pop music and 'hip-hop/ R&B' fields, including outputfrom Flo Rida, Ke$ha, Pitbull, Will.I.Am, Black Eyed Peas, David Guetta, ChrisBrown, Usher, Ne-yo, Lil' Wayne, Drake, Snoop Dogg, Kanye West, Taio Cruz andJennifer Lopez to name but a few, (and all those in 2008 alone!) In more recentyears, it has become worryingly present in the output of prominentreggae-dancehall artists. It also entered the British consciousness through'talent' (it says here) show 'The X Factor' in 2010, when producers admitted tohaving used the effect on the performances of certain entrants to improve theirsound. In what was more likely a publicity stunt than anything else, show bossSimon Cowell then imposed a ban on its use in future episodes.Stories even emerged of hopeful young girls auditioning at 'talent' contests andactually making their voices sound like they'd had Auto-Tune applied, such wastheir idea of what it takes to have a hit record in these times.There have been attempts to justify Auto-Tune's use as a form of creativeexpression. But many of the comments turn out to be quite revealing in light ofthe real purpose for its over-saturation.The US DJ and producer Jayce Clayton, known alternatively as DJ/rupture, writes:\"The plug-in creates a different relation of voice-to-machine than everbefore . . . Auto-Tune operates as a duet between the electronics and thepersonal.\"He added, with possible irony: \"As such, it becomes quite humanizing.\" (!)And could author, academic and Professor of Black Popular Culture, Mark AnthonyNeal, have been dropping a knowing clue when he commented on Lil' Wayne's use ofAuto-Tune by saying: \"his slurs, blurs, bleeps and blushes of his vocals, indexsome variety of trauma.\"? (Readers who may have missed the chapter on theworkings of trauma-based mind control are encouraged to go back and check itout!)Singer Michael Bublé, meanwhile, probably didn't realise the relevance of hisvocabulary when he criticised Auto-Tune as making everyone sound the same and\"like robots.\"Ludovic Hunter-Tilney, writing for the UK's 'Financial Times' during Auto-Tune'sexplosion in 2008, also nailed it – and was probably equally unaware of theprophetic potency of his words. Reviewing Britney Spears' album 'Circus,' heobserved:\"Her heavily-produced voice, as if responding to the turn of a dial, slides fromnatural-sounding coos to robotically-distorted chirps. In the course of a singlesong she morphs between flesh-and-blood Britney and automated Britney soseamlessly and frequently, that we grow unsure of the difference. With theall-too-human foibles of her breakdown-prone personal life acting as a backdrop,it makes for a dazzling display of technological enhancement.\"He went on to make a reference to \"Spears' Android drone.\"An album that stands as a showcase of how the Auto-Tune sound can be used todiscordant effect is Kanye West's '808s & Heartbreak.' By the time this wasreleased in 2008, Kanye's music had already been degraded and debased beyondhope. The album was released in the wake of the sudden death of his belovedmother, Donda, to whom Kanye was famously close, (he had dedicated the track'Hey Mama' on his 'Late Registration' album to her,) and his break-up fromfiancee Alexis Phifer. '808s' was said to be a kind of cathartic release forKanye's grief. It certainly showed in the set's downbeat and unsettling feel,which didn't go un-noticed by critics.Jody Rosen writing for 'Rolling Stone' magazine, observed:\"Kanye can't really sing in the classic sense, but he's not trying to. T-Paintaught the world that Auto-Tune doesn't just sharpen flat notes: it's apainterly device for enhancing vocal expressiveness, and upping thepathos . . . Kanye's digitized vocals are the sound of a man so stupefied bygrief, he's become less than human.\"An interesting choice of phrase within the overall context of this book's story.THOSE WHO KNOWThe Transhumanist plans – and specifically those of the microchipping agenda –have not gone undocumented by some of music's more awakened artists – those notowned lock, stock and barrel by corporations who dictate their every move, thatis. A brilliant interpretation, with a cracking video to match, came from theBritish musician Imani Hekima on his song 'Just Beneath the Skin'. Here's theYoutube link – https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=HE9wbbmQWAM[https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=HE9wbbmQWAM]I can remember back in the mid-90s hearing Rastafarians commenting on microchipsand barcodes as being 'the mark of the beast' at the hands of the 'BabylonSystem.' Back then in my walking sleep-state I had no idea what they meant. Inrecent years it's become all too clear. The only question remaining is how theyhad so much knowledge of the plan in the years before the internet. According tomany, Jamaicans possess a spiritual connectedness to higher consciousness, whichis amplified by their regular smoking of cannabis, and this allows them tochannel great truths into their minds.Similarly, there's a reason why technology is referred to untrustingly as'tricknology' in hip-hop slang, as exemplified by Jeru Tha Damaja on his tracks'Can't Stop The Prophet' and 'Revenge Of The Prophet.' In these, variousconcepts are metaphorically presented as comic book-style super-villains thatthe hero, The Black Prophet, must combat. Besides Ignorance, Hatred, Jealousy,Envy, Anger, Despair, Animosity and Deceit stands Tricknology. As conveyed in'Revenge Of The Prophet:' \"Fightin' ignorance everyday, it's gettin' weary. WhenI think I got him he pulls a slip on me. And there's so many soldiers in hisfiendish-ass army. One of the fiercest, is this nigga named Tricknology.\"(The track ends with the promising words, \"to be continued . . . \" This was in1996, however, and 20 years on we're still waiting! Either way, the lyrics tothese tracks truly convey the potency of real rap music to inspire, educate anduplift when in the hands of a responsible and intelligent lyricist, and areabout as far from the content of mainstream 'hip-hop' output of the past tenyears or more as it's possible to get!)The British rapper Nate expanded on this on a 2013 track, itself entitled'Tricknology,' with lyrics like:\"iPads and iPods, forever got your eyes locked on screens that's HD,Entertainment as a mind fog,Tapping Blackberries while you're walking,Arthritis of the hands will have you shaking.\"\"8 million megahertz of frequencies are passing you,Better use the eye of consciousness to see you fucking through.\"\"So don't get caught up in the World Wide WebUnderstand why it's called the interNET.\"The subjects of hip-hop and Transhumanism found common ground in a 2014interview by BJ Murphy with two New York MCs by the names of MC Kilch andMaitreya One. The artists appeared to be openly advocating the elites' agenda atfirst glance, with Kilch stating:\"I would like to see more emcees making music that utilizes Transhumanistthinking, or speaks about concepts such as the Technological Singularity, but Idon’t think that hip-hop has a duty to promote such.\"Maitreya One then appears to offer a more compassionate and human take on thesubject by saying:\"Hip-hop's duty is to show the proper use of technology, which is to be used ina humane way, not just to uphold a social order that oppresses and divides us.Hip-hop sees technology’s ability to free us from the mundane work-a-dayschedule that limits our freedom and holds our bodies captive to a corruptmonetary system that enslaves us. Hip-hop's version of the TechnologicalSingularity is all-inclusive and puts humanity first.\"However, the waters then get muddied again when you read that Maitreya cites JEdgar Hoover, the founding director of the FBI, as one of her influences, andpraises the covert and illegal COINTELPRO programme that he brought in. Then, atthe end of the interview, she gives a respectful shout-out to the aforementionedRay Kurzweil of Google. Whether they're in on an agenda or simply confused,therefore, remains in question, You can read the interview here: * http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/murphy20140502 [http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/murphy20140502]WANTED DEAD OR ALIVEThere is a kind of visual variation on Auto-Tune, and it first came to publicview in 2012 when a life-size hologram of slain rapper 2Pac was paraded at theCoachella Festival in California, 'performing' alongside a flesh-and-blood SnoopDogg and Dr. Dre. According to Nick Smith, president of San Diego-based AVConcepts, it took his company four months to create the hologram, at a cost atleast $100,000. The idea is said to have come from Dr. Dre himself. Smithboasted about how his company was able to recreate long-dead figures andvisually recreate them in the studio: “You can take their likenesses and voiceand . . . take people that haven’t done concerts before or perform music theyhaven’t sung and digitally recreate it.\" He also justified the massive cost ofproducing the hologram by pointing out that it still worked out far cheaper thanhaving to transport a real-life performer around a multitude of venues on tour.Why am I getting flashbacks of the British dark comedy starring Rik Mayallentitled 'Bring Me The Head Of Mavis Davis,' in which a record company ownerdecides one of his fading stars is worth more to him dead than alive, and plotsto kill her in order to pay off his debts? The 2Pac hologram itself was evengiven its own Twitter page, attracting more than 3,300 followers.Sorry . . . did I mention that the world is insane?A couple of years later, the 2014 Billboard Music Awards featured a life-sizehologram of Michael Jackson in performance, five years after his ritualsacrif . . . sorry, tragic accidental death at the hands of his physician. Thetechnology for this one used an illusory technique dating back to the 16thcentury, involving mirrors and known as 'Pepper's Ghost,' but like the 2Paccreation, it was said to have taken several months to prepare, and at a similarcost. The MJ hologram 'performed' the song 'Slave To The Rhythm,' (muchpertinence to that title?) from his second posthumous album, 'Xscape.' The songwas recorded for the 1991 album 'Black & White,' but didn't make the finalselection. Do you think there could have been a reason for that?Call me old-fashioned but I can't help thinking that if the industry didn't killoff its artists, then it could continue to put the real thing on stage ratherthan needing to create a hologram, but hey, that's just me. To be fair, though,I should mention that the industry doesn't always wait until its artists aredead and buried before making holograms. At the 2006 Grammy Awards, aflesh-and-blood Madonna performed with digitally-projected cartoon members ofthe Gorillaz. Holograms of Celine Dion and The Black Eyed Peas have also'performed,' though I'm unsure how you'd ever tell the difference in the case ofthe latter.STOOGE.HE.ISBlack Eyed Peas frontman Will.i.am stands as a text-book example of an artistcorrupted by the industry machine and co-opted to help push its Transhumanistpsy-op. His very name reads like a web address, (as does that of fellow groupmember apl.de.ap,) and it wouldn't surprise me if his trademark haircut, with acorner chunk cut out, is meant to symbolise a section of his mind that's beenlobotomised. This is certainly the effect that his 'music' is designed to haveon the masses.The group, and i.am in particular, became very useful to the agenda once theirmusic had been firmly shifted from the credible hip-hop sound of their 1998album 'Behind The Front,' into the brainless tripe they were producing by thetime of their fourth album 'Monkey Business,' with mind-numbing bile like 'MyHumps' and 'Pump It.' We'll get more into how this process has been repeatedtime and time again – and with the Black Eyed Peas as an example – in the laterchapter on The Systematic Degeneration Of Hip-Hop Culture.More than most, i.am's image for the past several years has been madedeliberately evocative of a robot/ cyborg. This is reflected in his own vocalstyle on record, (Auto-Tune overload,) and in tracks he has produced for othermanipulated puppets such as Flo Rida. Emphasis has been put on explicitlydigital/ electronic production styles.BEP videos have also been laden with robot/ cyborg imagery. A detailed analysison the Vigilant Citizen website by contributor LVB in 2010 went into this,highlighting in particular the song and video to 'Imma Be.' In terms of thetitle, this is generally taken to be a street-slang way of saying 'I'm going tobe.' Given the blatant symbolism of the video, however, LVB speculates that thereal meaning of this could be 'I'm a bee,' as in, an expression of the hive-mindmentality and The Singularity of which Ray Kurzweil speaks so enthusiastically.The same video makes use of the tune 'Rock That Body,' which, the articlesuggests, could be an alternative expression for improve, or upgrade that bodyby way of artificial implants.VC's article picks up the story of how the video's overall theme is set:\"Will.i.am tells everyone he has something cool to show them, and he busts outone of those high-tech aluminium CIA-type briefcases and opens it up. The otherPeas ask what it is, and he tells them that it is a machine with artificialintelligence, (AI,) that will sample your voice and allow you to just type inthe lyrics and it will 'do all the singing, talking, rapping.' He says that itis the future and it is what will take the Peas into 3008 . . . which is kind offunny, and very optimistic as far as being able to live that long without somekind of radical technology.\"This false 'reality' scene continues with another BEP asking Will if this meansthat he won’t actually be rapping in the studio any more, and Will explainsthat, no, he won’t be doing the rapping because the machine will do it all,which Will thinks is very cool.\"Then Fergie gets really mad and puts on a big drama-queen display. She says 'itwill take the soul out of it' and 'it’s not real,' and finally she says, 'we’renot robots!', and leaves the room pissed off.\"As the video progresses, subtle visual touches include dancing robots, agraveyard of broken machine parts and signs advertising beer. It could have beenany brand in the world, but it just happens to be TuBORG. VC breaks down howaspects of human/ machine hybridization being presented as a liberating thingfor humanity, are contrasted with those in which it is conveyed with a terrible,doom-laden foreboding, leading to extreme cognitive dissonance on the part ofany confused viewer under its spell.This is just one example of the Will.i.am/ Black Eyed Peas involvement inpushing Transhumanist ideas. In a much-hyped publicity stunt, in 2012, i.am.'ssingle 'Reach For The Stars' was reportedly released from NASA's Mars CuriosityRover. As reported by researcher Isaac Weishaupt on the Illuminati Watcherwebsite at the time:\"The quote he provided is quite telling if you look at it from this moresinister viewpoint. If you read it from the view that he is secretly trying toimplant the idea that it is acceptable to merge the power of technology into ourbody and become a Transhumanistic cyborg, then you can see how all of thesymbolism found in their videos also helps push the propaganda.“This is about inspiring young people to lead a life without limits placed ontheir potential and to pursue collaboration between humanity and technology,'will.i.am said.\"Further blurring of the lines between the natural and the artificial, comes fromthe increasing proliferation of CGI (Computer-Generated Imagery) in the majorityof Hollywood movies and in many TV shows. Decades ago, challenging and difficultscenes in movies had to actually be carried out physically by cast and crew,(see William Friedkin's 'Sorcerer' or Werner Herzog's 'Aguirre: Wrath Of God'for two great examples!) Now, some techno-boffin in a darkened lab is given abrief and a salary, and scenes that used to bear some semblance to physicalreality appear by magic with a few clicks of a mouse. I'm sure most will alsohave noticed how airbrushed and photo-shopped magazine covers make theirsubjects look like plastic dolls rather than real flesh-and-blood humans. Allpart of the dark mind-control games to allow artificiality to become acceptableand familiar within the general public's psyche.MAKING TYRANNY 'COOL'These scenes tie in with another trend in the popular music videos of recentyears. As well as subtle suggestions of Transhumanist elements, an unfeasiblenumber of A-list promos have featured depictions of a militarized Police statein what is always described in prophetic Hollywood movies as a 'dystopianfuture.' Police and military, often portrayed in the form of cyborgs, arefrequently seen interacting with the artists in choreographed scenes. In mostcases, of course, the lyrical content of the song bears no relevance to thescenes being acted out on the screen, but the chance to deeply embed certainimages into the collective consciousness – accompanied by a catchy hook to makethem more palatable – is too good an opportunity for the demented psychopaths toresist. In many countries – the US in particular – the Police have been gettingslowly more militarized every year, and there has been a specific drive torecruit psychopathic thugs to the profession, to the point that many officerswho joined the force with the genuine aim of 'making a difference' are leavingin their droves. Stories of US Police criminals executing people for crimes suchas being homeless or selling cigarettes on the street now come weekly. Theoutcome is always the same. Despite the apparent 'investigation,' and thefrequent availability of video evidence that should convict the perpetrators ofmurder, every officer walks free with no more than a temporary suspension.Standard-issue uniform is now all-black, (one of the colours associated withSaturn,) and the assorted accessories that the Police now sport, from shields tohelmets to body padding, already gives them the appearance of robots. A 'themand us' society, with 'them' protected by armies of violent, unthinking thugs,is precisely the type of future the social architects have in their plans for'us.' They would argue that it's not like they didn't announce their intentionsin advance. We're just supposed to know that they've done it by way of thelatest Beyonce or Rihanna video.SINGULARITY LADIESOne of the biggest pop-R&B hits of the past decade is Beyonce's 'Single Ladies,'a song that has been adopted by women the world over as an anthem of femalestrength and empowerment. The hookline berates the man in question for not'putting a ring on it.' He apparently should have shown his commitment to hiswoman by spending a large chunk of his corporate salary on an engagement ring,and now he's lost her as a result. Right on, sister!Some time afterwards, however, American musicologist and researcher Lenon Honorstunned many – myself included – when he presented an in-depth analysis of thetrue purpose of the song's accompanying video. As usual, the on-screen imageryis largely at odds with the lyrical content of the record. The video featuresBeyonce performing various eye-catching dance routines, flanked by a dancer oneither side mimicking her moves. Lenon elaborated in the 'Good Vibrations'interview I did with him in 2013:\"That song and video went viral, and oftentimes, the social engineering thattakes place is global . . . There were people dressing up as Beyonce, and theywould have two other dancers that would dress up too, and they would memorisethe dance. They would also have their children do it, scantily-dressed, andrecord them. Little girls doing these very provocative dances. Also males! Maleswould be doing the same thing. This provides a level of programming, becauseit's not just mind-control programming, it's also body control. In other words,you can actually programme someone by having them reproduce physical movements,and when these become a repetition, these can also access the subconsciousmind.\"Lenon points out that throughout the video, Beyonce is wearing a robotic sleeveon her left arm and hand. Although it's right there in plain sight, evoking themerging of the human body with cyborg machinery, it can still go un-noticedgiven the distraction of the intricate dancing. At the very end, though, sheholds the arm up and strokes it, before making the fingers zing and laughing. Ohit's such fun, this Transhumanist stuff!Viewers are left with a comfortable familiarity with the scenario beingdepicted. It doesn't matter that they're not consciously aware of it. It's thesame concept as when someone hears a piece of major news, but a while later,couldn't tell you what the source was. The only really important thing is thatthey now know it, and its potency has been firmly supplanted in their mind.At other times, Beyonce has appeared on stage as a robot, strongly resemblingthe one featured in Fritz Lang's 1926 movie 'Metropolis,' which was astoundinglyspot-on almost 100 years ago in its depiction of the type oftechnologically-governed 'them and us' society we see unfolding by the day.Kylie Minogue, Nicki Minaj and Michael Jackson have worn similar robotic garb.Miley Cyrus even released a single entitled 'Robot,' in which she is pictured asa mutilated cyborg/ human hybrid on the sleeve.Beyonce – and the so-called 'R&B' scene of the 2000s – have been useful to theTranshumanist agenda at other times, too. The title of her 2006 song 'UpgradeU,' further pushes the message, and there's little room for confusion with ChrisBrown's 'I Can Transform You' from 2008, either, complete with its screechingelectronic production and robotic voices. 50 Cent and Justin Timberlake got onthe bandwagon, (through coercion, no doubt,) with 2007's 'Ayo Technology.'Nas was foreshadowing a world he must have had advance knowledge of as far backas 1999 on his track 'New World' (interesting choice of title?) from the'Nastradamus' album. The closing line: \"I might be old-fashioned, stuck in myways, but nothing makes me more happy than seeing today,\" suggests a celebrationof how wonderful it is that technology has come so far. But other lyrics suchas: \"while the poor people starve, computers takin' over they jobs,\" and: \"yougot CD-Rom, everything operates by computers. Then what happens when circuitbreaks?\" present a conflicting message.In the electronic music realm, meanwhile, Daft Punk's song 'Harder, Bigger,Faster, Stronger' leaves little to the imagination in terms of what it isespousing – especially as the duo frequently depict themselves as cyborgs, andtheir trademark sound consists of robotised vocals over digital beats. Thesong's video shows four people being 'improved through mechanisation.' The grouphave also performed stage shows from inside of a pyramid complete withilluminated capstone. This song was later sampled by Kanye West for his track'Stronger' with its hookline 'that that don't kill me will only make mestronger,' a key part of the process of shifting the sound of 'hip-hop' everfurther away from sample-based analogue beats into the electronic realm.More of that next as the journey continues."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Website/ biography of Professor Kevin Warwick of Reading University: * http://www.kevinwarwick.com [http://www.kevinwarwick.com]/Music video: Imani Hekima: Just Beneath The Skin: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=HE9wbbmQWAM [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=HE9wbbmQWAM]Rolling Stone Magazine review of Kanye West's '808s & Heartbreak.': * http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/808s-heartbreak-20081211 [http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/808s-heartbreak-20081211]The Financial Times: Changing the parameters of pop by Ludovic Hunter-Tilney: * http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bf9b9a96-bcdc-11dd-af5a-0000779fd18c.html#axzz3VEZkYdLn [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/bf9b9a96-bcdc-11dd-af5a-0000779fd18c.html#axzz3VEZkYdLn]Throat Evo, by Antares Audio Technologies: * http://www.antarestech.com/products/detail.php?product=THROAT_Evo_14 [http://www.antarestech.com/products/detail.php?product=THROAT_Evo_14]Nate Featuring Dark Matter: 'Tricknology' (with lyrics): * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=RghsWi6uRa0 [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=RghsWi6uRa0]Hip-hop and Transhumanism: An Interview with M.C.

All you gotta do is sign here.\"K-Rino: 'Solitary Confinement' LP opening skit (2009)In 1993, one of the biggest hip-hop records of the year, to be heard in clubsand on radio stations the world over, was KRS One's 'Sound Of Da Police', ascathing reflection on the modern police force as a contemporary representationof the slavery system in America. Its lyrics included:\"You hotshot, wanna get props and be a saviour?First show a little respect in your behaviour,Change your attitude, change your plan,There could never really be justice on stolen land.\"In 2013, one of the biggest hip-hop (it says here) records of the year, to beheard in clubs and on radio stations the world over, was Big Sean's 'Ass'featuring Nicki Minaj. It's a song about a girl with a big ass. Its lyricsincluded:\"Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass,Ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass, ass,Stop . . . now make that motherfucker hammer time like,Go stupid, go stupid, go stupid.\"(Is it just coincidence that the 'go stupid, go stupid' hook-line also appearsin a separate song from Lil' Wayne, 'My Homies Still,' or is there a message ofinstruction being sent to the fans here?)And later:\"Wobbledy wobble, wo-wo-wobble, wobbin,'Ass so fat, all these bitches' pussies is throbbin.'I can think of no better example of the slow-drip debasement of aonce-meaningful art-form, into a retarded caricature of its former self over thecourse of 20 years, than to compare the type of lyrical content that was gettingunleashed through the genre then and now. For anyone who might suggest thatthese are two extreme examples, I would challenge them to find me a mainstreamhip-hop record from the past ten years – by which I mean one that was on heavymainstream radio and TV rotation and released through one of the main corporatelabels – which dealt with anything other than these general subject areas: * Having promiscuous sex * Partying in the club * Throwing wads of cash in the air * Girls with fat asses * A rapper's superior financial status over his or her peers * The possession of gold rims, chains or other paraphernalia * The acquisition of high-fashion clothing, alcohol or jewellery brands * Gun crime * Selling large quantities of drugs * Having more sexThe only one that springs to mind for me is Lupe Fiasco's 'Words I Never Said',and you can read more about this particular artist and record in the nextchapter!Has this transition come as the inevitable result of a genre's 'progress' ormutation over an extended period, in response to natural market forces, andreflecting random changes in society and attitudes? Is it just taking the easyoption towards vast profits by stripping its lyrical content down to the basestform to appeal to the widest possible demographic? Or has it occurred at thehands of an insidious agenda to subvert a powerful art-form and turn it intoimmoral, toxic filth as a way of brainwashing a naive new generation ofconsumers who, with such a long passage of time, will have no recollection ofthe original values that this genre once stood for?Before we attempt to answer the question, have another lyricalcompare-and-contrast. This is from Nonchalant's 'Five 'O Clock' from 1995:\"Well, Mr. Black Man, tell me where you're heading,The last few years I watched while you were shedding,Pounds and pounds of growth from the population,Soon we won't be able to have a strong black nation,A shooting here, a stabbing there, when will it stop?'Cause now you're dying from the dose of the crack rock,I'm just a Nubian Queen that needs a king to stand strong,And try to press on.\"Now, please enjoy the lyrical wisdom of Lil' Wayne on 2013's 'Million DollarPussy':\"If you hating, you just need some pussy,She fucked up when she gave me some pussy,Say, 'I fuck you better than that other nigga,'She say Tune, 'I'm 'bout to cum', I say, 'I'm cumming with ya,'And she don't like them pretty niggas, diddy niggas,She ride this dick, her titties jiggle,That's my pillows.\"Shall we move on?THE METAPHYSICS OF HIP-HOPWhy should it be that the dark priest-class should have set its sights onhip-hop? As ever, financial considerations will have played a part, but it's farfrom the whole story. The fact that the corporates have been able to make akilling out of the debasement and commercialisation of hip-hop is a secondaryfactor to the real likely motivation.In 2005, the writer, lecturer and MC known as Black Dot released his landmarkbook 'Hip Hop Decoded – From Its Ancient Origin To Its Modern Day Matrix.' Init, he proposed that there are spiritual and metaphysical components to hip-hop,with strong links to the ancestral history of black cultures. The aspect thatmost instantly think of is the rap element, which was largely derived from thespoken-word poetry traditions that preceded it, from the likes of GilScott-Heron and The Last Poets. (Check out their 'E Pluribus Unum' for thelowdown on the New World Order and the imagery on the US dollar bill from wayback in 1973, the same year that DJ Kool Herc is acknowledged as hosting thevery first hip-hop block parties.) The remaining elements of the art-form areequally important components, however – B-boying, or 'breaking,' turntablism andgraffiti art.These four fundamental elements, Black Dot proposes, have their origin in fouraspects of African culture that were in place centuries before the first slaveswere taken to the shores of America. They represent, respectively, the oracle,the dancer, the drummer and hieroglyphics, and combine to form the foundation ofthe fifth element, which is Knowledge Of Self. These traits lay embedded withinthe spirit and the psyche of Africans, Dot explains, and were resurrected in TheBronx when hip-hop culture was born from the roots of these earlier traditions.Pioneering artists such as Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, Grandmaster Flash andGrand Wizard Theodore were channelling these ancestral spirits, and applyingthem to a new generation in a new place and time.Black Dot expanded on his observations in a podcast interview with me, markingthe tenth anniversary of his book's release:\"I think the environment was right to bring this about. And these guys were nottrying to change reality. They couldn't hold it any more, so they just becamethe vessels in which the spirit took physical form and utilised them to bringforth a culture that is the biggest one in the world today. So in my book I makesure I honour them, because they were the first doers, as we say . . . GrandWizard said this book changed his life, Kool Moe Dee said it's the greatest bookhe ever read. Afrika Bambaataa said something very similar, because no-one hadput them in the proper perspective of their contributions.\"As Public Enemy's Professor Griff remarked when expanding upon this principle inone of his lectures:\"We set the hip-hop thing in motion and gave birth to something everyone isaffected by. Everyone that comes into music has to contemplate whether or notthey're going to deal with the vibration of hip-hop – Higher Infinite PowerHealing Our People.\"So in The Bronx, when we gave birth to this vibratory frequency . . . it setsomething in motion. And during this particular time, those trains that wentout, the tracks were like veins in the black community. Then brothers took themspray cans and tagged them trains. Put their hieroglyphs on there and we readit. Something was going on. A baby was born in The Bronx that we needed to bringthe gifts to. And it roared out of The Bronx. You can't help it now; the cat isout of the bag. Everyone's been affected by it.\"These elements can also be seen to be artistic expressions of the four principalelements inherent in the natural world – earth, air, fire and water, whichthemselves combine to complement the fifth element of spirit. It is thesecomponents that are represented by the five points of the pentagram, animportant symbol in occultic circles, with the spirit element pointing upwards.This is why satanists invert the pentagram, to have the spirit element pointingdownwards, relegating it to base consciousness status, as far removed fromhigher spiritual awareness as it's possible to get. (These elements also make anintegral appearance in the plotline of Dan Brown's 'Angels And Demons' novel andits Tom Hanks-starring film.Black Dot's lectures and videos on this subject, available on Youtube, comehighly recommended for further understanding of the concepts being conveyed.The intuitive awakening of these traditions within this beautiful new art-form,and the uplifting effect it was having on black communities, would not have goneun-noticed by the dark controllers. Sure enough, the infiltration intended todebase and degrade its spiritual potency began.The tactics used were similar to those applied to Rhythm & Blues and Rock & Rollbefore it, and any number of 'urban' music genres since. Time and time again,the corporates take a beautiful and creative art-form that had evolvednaturally, and seek to corrupt it. They can't stand not being in control. Thetrouble is, in their own machine-minds, they have no creative abilities orimaginations of their own. So they use scientifically-designed blueprints andtemplates and, once they have completely dominated a genre by throwing hugeamounts of money at it to buy everyone out, they unleash all subsequent productaccording to these formulae. That's why all output from that point forwardsounds like completely artificial constructs, devoid of artistic love andpassion. Real music fans can tell the difference between a track that was putout because the corporations just wanted to make a whole load of money and keepan agenda going, versus one that was produced because the music-maker genuinelyhad a message that they wanted to communicate to the world through their art,and they managed to put it out undiluted.MURDER, HE WROTEIn 2012, a letter started circulating heavily in the hip-hop press, purportingto have been written by a former executive with one of the big musiccorporations in the US. The writer didn't give his name, but claimed to havebeen present at a meeting at a private residence in Los Angeles in early 1991,along with representatives from the other big record labels of the time, wherethe future direction of rap music was on the agenda. This was the spawning ofthe genre which came to be known as 'gangsta rap.' Also present at the meeting,the writer said, were a small group of individuals that nobody else recognised.Before the meeting commenced, everyone present was required to sign aconfidentiality contract, with those that refused being asked to leave.As the meeting progressed, the guests identified themselves as representativesof the US private prison industry. They outlined a plan in which they invitedthe major music corporations to work with them on reshaping the lyrical identityof the hip-hop genre, which by then was already proving itself to be a powerfuland highly profitable market force. The record labels' job, they were told,would be to systematically change the lyrics going into records, and to shapeand mould the image of the artists, the aim being to modify the behaviour ofyoung black males based on the type of lifestyle they heard being propagated bytheir idols. The resulting crime waves would, in turn, lead todramatically-increased numbers of inmates filling privately-owned prisons,bringing colossal shares in the resulting profits for all parties concerned. Asthe letter outlines:\"We were told that these prisons were built by privately-owned companies whoreceived funding from the government based on the number of inmates. The moreinmates, the more money the government would pay these prisons. It was also madeclear to us that since these prisons are privately-owned, as they becamepublicly traded, we’d be able to buy shares.\"The writer states that he and three others, who by this point were disgusted bywhat they were hearing and wanted no part in it, were forcibly removed from thehouse at gunpoint and reminded that they had signed a gagging agreement. Thewriter says that he battled with his conscience for over 20 years, but finallydecided that he could no longer keep the secret and felt the need to share hisstory with the world.The letter continues:\"As the months passed, rap music had definitely changed direction. I was never afan of it, but even I could tell the difference. Rap acts that talked aboutpolitics or harmless fun were quickly fading away as 'gangsta rap' starteddominating the airwaves. Only a few months had passed since the meeting, but Isuspect that the ideas presented that day had been successfully implemented. Itwas as if the order had been given to all major label executives. The music wasclimbing the charts, and most companies were more than happy to capitalize onit. Each one was churning out their very own 'gangsta rap' acts on an assemblyline. Everyone bought into it, consumers included. Violence and drug use becamea central theme in most rap music. I spoke to a few of my peers in the industryto get their opinions on the new trend, but was told repeatedly that it was allabout supply and demand. Sadly, many of them even expressed that the musicreinforced their prejudice of minorities.\" . . . Now that I have a greater understanding of how private prisons operate,things make much more sense than they ever have. I see how the criminalizationof rap music played a big part in promoting racial stereotypes, and misguided somany impressionable young minds into adopting these glorified criminalbehaviours which often lead to incarceration.You can read the letter in full here: * http://www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html [http://www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html]THAT'S GANGSTAInevitably, the writer's mystery identity has led to claims that the letter is ahoax. Putting oneself in the writer's position, however, if everything he claimsis true, it becomes easy to understand why he would choose anonymity. Andlooking at how the landscape of hip-hop has changed over the past 25 years, cananyone really argue that the claims sound far-fetched and unrealistic?It's true that lyrical content and the stereotypical images portrayed by rapperschanged from the beginning of the 90s onwards. Wikipedia's entry on 'gangstarap' lists the type of lyrical subjects it expounds as including: \"crime, serialkilling, murder, violence, profanity, sex addiction, homophobia, racism,promiscuity, misogyny, rape, street gangs, drive-by shootings, vandalism,thievery, drug dealing, alcohol abuse, substance abuse, disregarding lawenforcement, materialism, and narcissism.\"NWA, (Niggaz With Attitude,) had largely paved the way with tracks such as'Straight Outta Compton,' 'Fuck Tha Police' and 'Gangsta Gangsta' – althoughPhiladelphia-based Schoolly D's 'PSK: What Does It Mean' is largely credited asthe first 'gangsta rap' record, followed by offerings from Ice-T and Just-Ice.By 1992, former NWA member Dr. Dre's 'The Chronic' had appeared, an albumconsidered an all-time classic in hip-hop circles, followed a year later by thedebut album from Dre protégé Snoop Doggy Dogg, two sets which continued steeringhip-hop in the desired direction with songs such as 'The Day The Niggaz TookOver,' A Nigga Witta Gun,' 'Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat,' 'Bitches Ain't Shit,' 'Murder WasThe Case,' 'Serial Killa,' 'For All My Niggaz and Bitches,' 'Gz And Hustlas' and'Gz Up Hoes Down.'Back in the early 90s, and all the way through to relatively recent times, you'dhave found me defending these trends, and explaining them away as naturalartistic expression, and merely a documentary-style reflection of the ghettostreet life from which many of these artists emerge. It's clear to me now thatit goes way beyond this and involves a long-term, concerted plan set into placewith some very clear objectives. The anti-establishment image of 90s hip-hop,along with the perception that it was 'cool' to be into it, was what attractedme to want to be a participant, so I can absolutely understand why the plan touse it as a method of social engineering has been so successful. It's only atthis advanced stage in life with the maturity that it brings, that I've beenable to break through the brainwashing and see the agenda for what it is – asdifficult as it is to admit that I was taken in, and that many artists Ipreviously looked up to were merely manipulated pawns. I can understand,therefore, why so many original-generation fans of The Beatles and the artiststhat emerged out of Laurel Canyon have such a hard time accepting that there wasany kind of Hidden Hand involved in the 1960s scene too.The release of the 2015 NWA biopic 'Straight Outta Compton,' inspired researcherLenon Honor to embark on a documentary film of his own, titled 'NWA – A CriticalAnalysis.' 'Compton' had documented the birth of the 'gangsta rap' era withaffectionate nostalgia, portraying Eazy E and Dr. Dre as valiant heroes whileconveniently forgetting to mention Dre's woman-beating tendencies, and the factthat Eazy had fathered – and abandoned – many children through his promiscuoussex life, (but with Dre serving as the film's Executive Producer should we betoo surprised at this sanitised take on the story?) Lenon undertook an in-depthanalysis of NWA's legacy, arming himself with a copy of each of their sixalbums, and trawling through the lyrics to identify certain themes, trends andvocabulary that were being systematically employed to change the landscape ofhip-hop music of the time.\"On NWA's first album there were 12 tracks. (Actually there were 11 tracks, butI've counted another song because in the re-release they've added 'A Bitch Is aBitch'!) You have 177 instances where male NWA members disrespected women, 143of those by NWA members, 34 of those instances by other members of the groupcalled The Posse. That's in 50 minutes and nine seconds. You also have 87instances of self-aggrandisement. That means the rapper is trying to makehimself out to be greater than he actually is . . . by disrespecting otherpeople. There were 66 negative references to the female body . . . calling blackwomen 'bitches', 65 times. Also, disrespecting of men 61 times. References toalcohol, 59 times, references to drugs, 34 times, the use of the term 'shit' 33times, the use of the term 'fuck', 28 times, references to money, 21 times,references to cars, 19 times, general violence against black men, 16times . . . \"And through the rest of NWA's canon of work, 48 tracks in total.\"There were 553 instances of disrespecting black women. The word 'fuck' was used198 times, 'motherfucker' 197 times, disrespect of black men, 193 times.References to 'dick' or penis, 96 times, references to guns, 93 times. Generalviolence against black men, 88 times, disrespect of other black rappers, 91times, references to drugs, 87 times.\"Lenon suggests that the appearance of the 2015 movie, far from marking anostalgic trip down memory lane, was strategically released to glorify the samevalue system that was pioneered in NWA's early days, to a whole new market.\"Here we are 25 years later, and this programming is being re-presented to theworld. So the idea is, if you present a movie to people who weren't even born 25years ago, if you promote it in the right way, they're going to be inclined toview the movie. So now we have a whole new generation of people who are going tobe exposed to the same type of programming that I was exposed to growing up.\"By the arrival of Notorious BIG, 50 Cent and Rick Ross, it had become thefashion for rappers to model their entire personas on criminal figures.Christopher Wallace, aka Notorious BIG's alter-ego, was Biggie Smalls, abig-time gangster character portrayed by actor Calvin Lockhart in the 1975 movie'Let's Do It Again.' When rapper Curtis Jackson became 50 Cent, he was emulatingthe identity of Kelvin Martin, a street robber from The Bronx. Martin was shotin a project building in 1987, dying four days later, so it seems prophetic thatJackson was himself shot nine times in Queens, New York in 2000. Unlike Martinhe survived. The rapper Rick Ross, meanwhile, took his name from a notoriousdrug trafficker known as Freeway Ricky Ross, who has admitted to running cocaineas part of the Iran-Contra affair on behalf of those nice people at the CIA. Theimpostor Rick Ross's real name is William Roberts II, and his lawless gangsterimage took something of a battering when it emerged that, prior to his rapcareer, he had worked for the government as a correctional facilities Officer,as well as graduating from Albany State University on a football scholarship.Other rappers to have adopted crime-related pseudonyms include the New York duoCapone N Noreaga, named after an Italian mob boss and a Panamanian dictatorrespectively, Texas MC Scarface, named after Al Pacino's Tony Montana characterfrom the 1983 movie, and Tragedy Khadafi, named after the toppled Libyan leader.For a time, Nas went by the name of Nas Escobar after the Colombian drug lordPablo Escobar. Murder Inc. label founder Irv Gotti and Dogg Pound rapper DazDillinger, modelled themselves on American mobsters John Gotti and JohnDillinger.For many purists, 1996 was the last year in which mainstream hip-hop output heldany real credibility, and before the ulterior motives really plunged it into anever-downward spiral. I'm inclined to agree with that judgement. There seems tobe some allegoric potency to the deaths of 2Pac and Notorious BIG in 1996/ 97,as if their murders symbolised the death of the art-form. Hip-hop's obsessionwith 'bling' culture really took a hold in '97, largely through the namespropagated by Sean 'Puff Daddy' Combs and his Bad Boy Records empire. Besidesthese, artists such as Jay-Z, R Kelly, Lil' Kim, Foxy Brown, Missy Elliott,Cam'ron, 50 Cent and Ja Rule saw to it that the worship of materialism andbig-name brands became normalised, as the original-generation heads whoremembered the better days of the genre's youth started to fall away fromclubbing and record-buying. The title of 50 Cent's breakthrough album, 'Get RichOr Die Trying,' summed up the mind-set of the 2000s scene with perfection.Even the trivial party records of old, going back to the likes of SugarhillGang's 'Rappers Delight' and Kurtis Blow's 'The Breaks', going through to 90sofferings from Nice N Smooth and Naughty By Nature, managed to be creative,lively and fun without resorting to the crudeness that today's tunes areseemingly required to in order to get put on.EAST WESTIt was a depressing period for hip-hop purists when the so-called East Coast/West Coast 'beef' occurred during the mid-90s. The benefit of hindsight, thetestimonies of insiders, and the resources of the internet for independentresearch, all point to this period as having been manipulated and contrived atthe hands of the industry, (with some involvement from the CIA,) rather thanbeing the unfortunate random affair it was presented as. It centred around LosAngeles' Death Row Records, owned by Marion 'Suge' Knight, with Tupac Shakur asits prominent artist, and its counterparts in New York – Bad Boy Records, Sean'Puff Daddy' Combs and Biggie Smalls, aka The Notorious BIG. The events whichled to the murders of 2Pac and Biggie were foreshadowed by infamous tracks fromeach of the artists. In 1995, Notorious BIG had put out 'Who Shot Ya,' (withmuch background goading from Puffy,) apparently taunting his former friend 2Pacover a November '94 incident that had occurred outside Quad Recording Studios inManhattan. Shakur had arrived there to meet with Biggie and Puffy. He wasattacked by three unknown assailants, robbed of his jewellery and shot fivetimes. In a subsequent interview with 'Vibe' magazine, Shakur stated that hebelieved Biggie and Puffy, along with a criminal associate of Puffy's known asJimmy Henchman, to be responsible for the set-up. Henchman is currently servinga life sentence connected to a murder; Biggie is dead; Puffy is alive and welland reckoned to be worth around a quarter of a billion dollars.This, and the ongoing East/ West tensions, seemingly prompted 2Pac to record'Hit 'Em Up,' a vicious five-minute tirade in which he threatens to murder theentire Bad Boy Records and Junior Mafia personnel and their children, and boastsof having had sex with Faith Evans, Biggie's wife. He also references theearlier Biggie track by saying, 'Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish.' Thesuspicion that the shooting was a set-up was also referenced by fellow Outlawzmember Hussein Fatal's line 'Frank White needs to get spanked right for settingtraps.' (Frank White was one of Biggie Smalls' pseudonyms after the characterportrayed by Christopher Walken in the movie 'King Of New York.' Hussein Fatalhimself died in a car accident in Georgia in July 2015.)This period ushered in a new era of hip-hop 'diss' records, where two prominentartists would record tracks specifically to antagonise each-other. While none ofthem got as close to the mark as 'Who Shot Ya' and 'Hit 'Em Up' had, each glutwas used to ignite 'beefs' between the artists concerned. Early examplesincluded Canibus and LL Cool J taking each-other on with 'Second Round K.O.' and'The Ripper Strikes Back,' Jay-Z and Nas going at it with 'Takeover' and'Ether,' and 50 Cent re-launching his career by directing a beef record at anyother rapper in sight. It all seemed a far cry from the days of MC Shan andBoogie Down Productions arguing relatively peacefully over territorial status on'The Bridge' and 'The Bridge Is Over' in the 80s. The diss records of the 2000sbecame a staple part of the corporations' output, with every 'hot' artist havingto have some manufactured beef with one of their peers. While it became amarketing gimmick that netted large profits for the labels, it also served toportray hip-hop as a genre steeped in bragging egotism, rivalry and threats ofviolence, feeding right into the hands of its critics, and tying in nicely withother aspects of the long-term agenda.THE DARK KNIGHTInter-coastal rivalries aren't even necessary when there are deadly beefs withinthe same extended camp. At the time of the 'Straight Outta Compton' movie'srelease in 2015, a new theory regarding the fate of group member Eazy E wasthrown up. Eazy's death in March 1995 had been put down to AIDS after he hadbeen admitted to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, (more on thisplace later!), apparently suffering from asthma only a month before. From asthmato death from AIDS in a month is quite some going.Eazy's son, Yung Eazy, told the music press that Death Row Records supremo SugeKnight had deliberately injected his father with the AIDS virus only weeksbefore he died. As evidence, Yung Eazy pointed to a 2003 TV interview with hostJimmy Kimmel, in which Knight jokes about the stabbing of people withAIDS-infested needles being the new 'Hood' murder method of choice.You can view the Jimmy Kimmel interview clip here: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=zxGvS1F0L38 [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=zxGvS1F0L38]A possible motive became apparent when a 2013 interview featuring former NWAmanager Jerry Heller resurfaced two years later. In it, Heller revealed that hehad talked Eazy E out of his plans to kill Suge Knight, and that to have doneso, was 'a big mistake.' Heller recalled:\"One day I came into the office, and (one of my clients) and Eazy were talking,and I said, ‘What’s going on here?’ And Eazy said, ‘You know this guy SugeKnight?’ And I said, ‘Yeah.’ He says, ‘Well, I’m gonna kill him . . . This guy’sgonna be a problem, and I’m gonna kill him.'”Heller added:“And you know something? I should’ve let him kill him. I would’ve done the worlda favour. He would have done it, for sure. By himself.”It seems few people who have crossed his path would spend too much time mourningthe demise of Suge Knight. His track record speaks for itself – even leavingaside any role he may have had in the murder of Tupac Shakur in 1996. That sameyear he was jailed for a probation violation. Two years after his 2001 release,he was back in the Big House for another violation after assaulting a parkingattendant. In May 2008, out again, he got into a money-related dispute outside aHollywood nightclub. In August the same year, police were called to a Las Vegasstrip club where they found him beating his girlfriend and brandishing a knife.Another Vegas arrest came in 2012 when he picked up three years' probation fordriving on a suspended licence, for traffic violation charges and for beingfound with marijuana in his car. In August 2014, Knight was shot six times at amusic awards party hosted by Chris Brown, echoing a situation nine years earlierwhere he had also been shot at an awards event hosted by Kanye West. Do youthink it's something he said?Only two months later, he was bailed after a legal case relating to the theft ofa female photographer's camera, with a charge of second-degree robbery. He wasalso implicated in the 2009 robbery of Akon producer Noel 'Detail' Fisher, wherefive armed men broke into Detail's house claiming they were calling in a debt onbehalf of Knight. This incident was reportedly linked to one of the previousmonth where Knight was extensively beaten at a private party at the W ScottsdaleHotel.The big crunch, (no pun intended,) came when he was charged with murder andanother case of attempted murder in early 2015. Police had received a video tapeallegedly showing Knight reversing his jeep over 'friend' Terry Carter, (withfriends like him, eh?) and associate Cle 'Bone' Sloan in the car park of afast-food joint in Compton, LA. The incident is said to have occurred after anargument on the set of the movie 'Straight Outta Compton.' Carter died. Knightwas also charged with attempted pre-meditated murder, hit-and-run resulting indeath, and hit-and-run resulting in injury, facing possible life imprisonment.What a guy.As the UK's 'Black Sheep Magazine' observed at the time:\"As the body-count has piled up around him, Knight has displayed a seeminglysupernatural ability to avoid death-by-bullet against all the odds, bringing itsown brand of bleak comedy and making him seem more like an invincible cartooncharacter than a hulking manipulative thug that personifies everything that'swrong with hip-hop culture.\"Following his subsequent jailing, Knight complained that he was going blind, andit was reported that he had developed a brain tumour and a blood clot in hislungs. He also complained that the toilet in his jail cell was haunted as itflushed by itself every 20 minutes, keeping him awake. Could karma finally becoming home to roost for Suge Knight?YEAH, BABYBesides reinforcing criminal stereotypes, there is another aspect to thisinsidious agenda which has been slowly rolled out over the past two decades. Acase could certainly be made for mainstream hip-hop output becoming deliberatelyinfantile and retarded as the 2000s progressed, as the trend for songs comingwith their own form of line-dancing emerged. Fans would be required to recite adance that they'd seen on MTV when the record in question came on in the club,leading to armies of mind-controlled automatons doing as they'd been instructed.The likes of Soulja Boy's 'Crank Dat,' D4L's 'Laffy Taffy,' Lil' Jon's 'Snap YoFingers,' Young Dro's 'Shoulder Lean' and Cali Swag District's 'Teach Me How ToDougie' helped push this agenda. Jibbs' 'Chain Hang Low' even appeared to thetune of the nursery-rhyme 'Do Your Ears Hang Low?' as if to publicly announcethe tendency to child-like intelligence levels that was being employed. By thetime the 'Schmoney Dance' invented by newcomer Bobby Schmurda from his 'HotNigga' track had arrived, all hope had been lost.The same tactics have been applied to what's now laughingly referred to as the'R&B' scene, a genre which has always sat side-by-side with hip-hop. Where itonce referred to Rhythm & Blues, 'R&B' now seems to simply be a reference toRihanna & Beyonce. (Although 'Rubbish & Bollocks' might be a more fittingdescription for the 2010s.)The current glut of urban music A-listers all have infantile nicknames to dumbtheir followers down yet further, (as if the 'music' itself wasn't enough to doit,) by regressing them back to baby-talk. So Jay-Z, Kanye West and Beyonce areJay, 'Ye and B, Rihanna is RiRi, Rick Ross is Rozay, and Lil' Wayne, Chris Brownand Drake are Weezy, Breezy and Drizzy! It's all presented as something forthose 'in the know,' as if it's cool and 'down' to refer to the artists on thesefamiliar terms.The dumbing-down agenda was further enforced by a study put together by AndrewPowell-Morse on behalf of Seatsmart. For this, he fed popular song lyrics into aReadability Score software package, which he used to figure out the averagereading level against US schooling standards. He concluded that lyrics incontemporary songs, (with offerings by Kanye West, Chris Brown and Beyonceoffered as examples,) come in at below third-grade reading level. His reportconcluded that hip-hop had the lowest lyrical intelligence out of the four maingenres analysed, and that the overall reading level in mainstream hits had beendeclining since 2005.The Texas rapper Scarface seems to agree with the idea of the deliberatedumbing-down of intelligence levels through hip-hop. In an outburst that's rareto hear from an artist signed to a prominent label, he used his interview timeon 'Hardknock TV' in April 2013 to state:“I feel like we’re losing it, you know what I‘m sayin‘? I feel like the peoplethat are in control of what hip-hop does is so fucking white and so fuckingJewish until they don’t give a fuck about what the culture and the craft andwhat it really is about . . . Let me say this shit right . . . ’cos I want thisto be as offensive as I can fucking make it for these old-ass, er, punks that’srunning these record labels, you know, that’s in the powerful positions todictate what the black community hears and listens to . . . like there’s nofucking way that you can tell me that it’s not a conspiracy against the blacksin hip-hop, because you put out fucking records that make us look stupid.”As the UK's Conspiro Media site observed at the time:\"Scarface has good reason to bemoan the quality of modern-day hip-hop music, agenre that was once teeming with articulate, intelligent voices applying theirrhymes to topics worthy of further attention such as inner-city poverty, policebrutality, racism, drug-addiction, hidden black history, and the promotion ofself-empowerment. This social and spiritual consciousness that once prevailed,has now been minimised and marginalised by spitters of lyrical nonsense whocelebrate ‘bling, big bucks, big-brands and bitches.\"The article goes on to quote Wise Intelligent of the group Poor RighteousTeachers, one of a number of hip-hop acts from the early 90s that adhered to theteachings of the Five Per Cent Faction of the Nation of Islam:“It wasn’t expected for hip-hop to reach this level, but when they realised thatit would, it followed the same format as every other music genre. Blues, rock –they all had a political edge when they started, but they eventually wereover-marketed and commercialised and became what they became. And it’s necessarybecause, you have to understand, the powers that exist that are ruling theworld, they can’t have too much influence in the hands of musicians. There was atime in Europe when it was the arts that actually educated the people. Thepeople were being educated through the arts, through theatre, throughShakespeare and so-on and so-forth. So they understand that science, and theydon’t want to let music expand and let the musicians have that kind of power.\"THE WAR ON BLACKSThe insidious control system clearly has contempt for the bulk of humanity –those it considers to be 'useless eaters.' But it strikes me that it harbours aparticularly hateful brand of contempt towards people of colour. LawrenceFishburne's Furious Styles character in the classic movie 'Boyz N The Hood'nails it when he points out to his son that a gun store and a liquor store arethe two consistent features in any of LA's black neighbourhoods.Throughout modern history the system has employed various methods to destroyblack communities, create negative stereotypes of black people in the eyes ofothers, and to subvert and corrupt its forms of artistic expression. This stancecan be seen from more obvious measures such as the importing of slaves fromAfrica and the flooding of black inner-city ghettos with crack cocaine andlaboratory-developed AIDS, to less blatant strategies. The 'blacking up' ofwhite people such as Al Jolson and the participants in 'The Black And WhiteMinstrel Show' would be one. The gradual degeneration of hip-hop is another.As Black Dot's earlier comments emphasise, hip-hop is an art-form which hasblack cultural traditions built into its very fabric, so any co-ordinatedattempt to corrupt it also has the effect of corrupting the cultural identity ofits people. Pretty much all evolutionary ties to these past elements have nowbeen cut through the continual phases of corporate artificiality that hip-hophas undergone.The desecration of moral values relevant to black people has not been immune,either. As if things had not been degraded enough, in his guest verse on theremix of Future's 'Karate Chop,' (itself a master study in the absurd deploymentof Auto Tune,) Lil' Wayne included the line 'I beat that pussy up like EmmetTill.' Quite rightly, this incurred the scorn of certain factions of the blackcommunity, given that Emmet Till was a 14-year-old African-American who wasbrutally beaten and murdered by racist thugs in 1955 after supposedly flirtingwith a white woman. His mutilated body was weighted to a fan blade bound to himby barbed wire and dumped in a river, (which gave rise to Kanye West's lyric on'Through The Wire' where he states his girl is 'scared to death that her manlook like Emmet Till' after his jaw was wired together following a caraccident.)Here, with the Lil' Wayne lyric, was one of the leading figures in contemporary'black' music, (I know . . . I know,) desecrating the memory of one of the mosttragic African-American figures with a throwaway one-liner in a trashy piece ofaudio garbage. Among the most vocal critics was Airickca Gordon-Taylor, a cousinof Emmet Till and the founding director of the Mamie Till Mobley MemorialFoundation, who said:\"To compare his murder and how beaten and how bullied . . . and tortured he was,to the anatomy of a woman, was really very disrespectful . . . I just couldn’tunderstand how you could compare the gateway of life to the brutality andpunishment of death. And I feel as though they have no pride and no dignity asblack men.\"Epic Records subsequently issued an apology. To paraphrase the Mandy Rice-Daviescharacter in the film 'Scandal,' 'well, they would, wouldn't they?Cash Money Records, the label that spawned Lil Wayne, clearly hadn't learnedmuch of a lesson when they released Nicki Minaj's 'Lookin' Ass Niggaz.' In thepromo shot, Minaj used a famous photo of the black civil rights leader Malcolm Xlooking out of a window holding a rifle, while the song's video shows herreplicating the pose and shooting at men. Two on-line petitions demanded thepicture's removal. The first was worded:\"You come from a rich legacy. Without the work and life of Malcolm X, you wouldnot be able to do what you do. Unfortunately you have chosen to disrespect anddishonor the legacy that he left us . . . We demand that you remove thepicture.\"The second tackled Minaj's glamorisation of guns, writing:\"Malcolm X carried a gun as he feared for the safety of his family and himself,and was aware he would someday be killed by political opponents. The image ofMalcolm X looking out the window highlighted that fear. Nicki Minaj’s use ofguns in her new music video speaks to the gun culture in our society today wheregun violence is an acceptable norm.\"Minaj issued a part-apology on her Instagram page, worded:\"What seems to be the issue now? Do you have a problem with me referring to thepeople Malcolm X was ready to pull his gun out on as 'Lookin Ass Niggaz?' Well,I apologize. That was never the official artwork, nor is this an officialsingle. This is a conversation. Not a single. I am in the video shooting atLookin Ass Niggaz and there happened to be an iconic photo of Malcolm X ready todo the same thing for what he believed in!!!! It is in no way to undermine hisefforts and legacy.\"As Black Dot observed in an interview on the subject for this book:\"I think it arises because Lil' Wayne and Nicki Minaj and them are so removedfrom African culture, so to speak. Meaning, there's a generation now, and theyare part of that generation, that don't care about Malcolm X, they don't careabout Emmet Till. They don't care about anything but themselves. And part ofthat is this new multicultural thing we have going on in America, whereeverybody is everybody. As a result, you lose the base of who you are.\"But when you're disconnected through culture, and all this becomes just aboutmoney, hoes and things of that nature . . . he probably ran across a picture ofEmmet Till and figured, 'oh shit, look how messed up this guy's face is. Let memention that.' And he mentions it with no kind of connection to it whatsoever.That's why it was easy for him to kick those lyrics. I believe it wasn't untilthe backlash came that he said, 'oh shit! Wooah! I think I touched a nerve thereso let me back up.' And it's funny because, if we as a collective got pissed-offat half the things these guys said, they wouldn't say it. So I think the recordlabel tells them, this is what we're talking about for the most part – money,hoes and clothes, this and that. Stay out of anything political.\"David Icke, arguably the world's best-known conspiracy author, turns out to behighly clued-up on the machinations of the corporate music machine, and ofhip-hop's role in particular. When I interviewed him for the very first 'GoodVibrations' podcast, he told me that he had once been selected by the manager ofPublic Enemy to go up on stage at one of their shows, such had been the appetiteamong hip-hop's free-thinkers to the information he had put out during the1990s. On another occasion in New York, hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa hadattended one of his lectures, and he spent time explaining to Icke that whatpurports to be 'hip-hop' in these times is really nothing of the sort. In mypodcast, Icke made a striking point about what hip-hop's present-day obsessionwith materialism, 'bling' culture and the acquisition of personal wealth reallyrepresents:\"One of the things that saddens me among black America . . . is when I see thepeople who have come through from the families of former slaves, taking on theso-called 'values' of the slave-owners! Not only taking on the values . . . buttaking on the religion that was imposed on them by the slave-owners . . . To seepeople enslaved by a religion that was imposed upon their ancestors after theywere appallingly brought from Africa to serve the slave-owners . . . And ofcourse, the slave-owners' values are money, wealth, control . . . And here'sJay-Z making the point that this is a great thing! Look at the bling, look at mybig car, look at my clothes! How much did I make last year? A million dollarshere, and a million dollars there!The long-standing tendency towards rappers boasting about their materialpossessions is a baffling thing, when you really apply some critical thought toit. An MC taunts their listeners by relaying how much richer they are than them,and how much better they're doing in life, often addressing the listener as'nigga,' 'muthafucka' or 'bitch' in the process. In many cases, the listenerwill have paid money to be reminded of their apparent inferior status, (I say'apparent' because, in a significant number of cases, it's all fiction, and therapper will no better off than most of the people listening due to the way therecording industry is set up to always work in the favour of the corporation andnever the individual . . . a bit like the rest of daily life!) Why should it bethat people find it entertaining to be lyrically taunted in this way? Theoutstanding conscious rapper DISL Automatic addressed this on his track 'Here IStand' in specific reference to Jay-Z when he stated: \"ain't it funny how theylove it when a grown man brags, 'bout the jewellery and money that none of hisfans have?\"The corporations have shaped and moulded the music in line with their largersocial engineering plans, reinforcing in the public's mind the notion that lifeis an inevitable struggle, that money and material possessions are the judge ofa person's true worth, and that individuals should know their place in theworld. It's an expression of the externalisation of power. Celebrities areplaced on pedestals, giving the view that they're more important and worthy thanthe little people who are merely worker-ants, there to keep their heads down,pay taxes and be grateful to the hand that feeds them. Any tactic that deniespeople the acknowledgement that their true power lies within themselves is fairgame for this control network.Mobb Deep frontman Prodigy has been extremely vocal on the subject of Illuminatiinfluence on hip-hop. In a letter he penned to 'Urb Magazine' in the wake ofreading the book 'Leviathan 666' by Dr. Malichi Z. York, he stated:\"Jay-Z knows the truth, but he chose sides with evil in order to be accepted inthe corporate world. Jay-Z conceals the truth from the black community and theworld, and promotes the lifestyle of the beast instead . . . Jay-Z is a goddamlie. I have so much fire in my heart that I will relentlessly attack Jay-Z, theIlluminati, and every other evil that exists until my lights are put out.\"THE DAY THE BANKS FAILEDThe issue of black slavery in America cropped up via another heavily puppeteeredartist at the tail-end of 2014, when Azealia Banks felt compelled to call for$100 trillion in reparation payments to the ancestors of former slaves at thehands of white corporate America. Addressing the DeWolf family, who wereprominent Rhode Island-based slave-traders, she went on to directly messagedescendant James DeWolf Perry:\"What did you (sic) family do with all the money you made from slavery???? Ineed to know. Now. Someone should kick your ass, and punch you right in yourstupid smiling cracker face.\"Later, in an interview on New York's Hot 97, she offered some further opinionson how black and white artists respectively are treated in the music industry:\"I feel like, in this country, whenever it comes to our things, like blackissues or black politics or black music or whatever, there's always thisundercurrent of kinda like a 'Fuck you.' There's always a 'Fuck y'all niggas.Y'all don't really own shit.\"Banks returned to controversial territory a short while later when addressingrapper Kendrick Lamar about his response to the police shooting of Michael Brownand the Ferguson riots. She messaged:\"When we don't respect ourselves how can we expect them to respect us, dumbestshit I've ever heard a black man say.\"And:\"HOW DARE YOU open ur (sic) face to a white publication and tell them that wedon't respect ourselves . . . Speak for your fucking self.\"One of Banks' Tweets during her initial rant about slavery read:\"Please please please do not get distracted with reality tv and rap music andfashion and all that other dumb shit.\"As a scathing article in the UK's on-line 'Black Sheep Magazine' observed at thetime, the words pot, kettle and black do spring to mind here, given that Bankshardly finds herself in a position of integrity to lecture others on thedebasement of moral values, her 'music' acting as a major contributory factortowards the corruption of the scene she represents. She does know a lot about'dumb shit,' however:\"It seems a good idea to recap a little on Ms. Banks' track record here. Shefirst emerged into the public's consciousness with her track '212' in 2011. Thevideo featured her cavorting in a sweatshirt featuring Mickey Mouse, mascot ofthe massive, white-owned Disney corporation, also a symbol denoting thetrauma-based mind control programming of artists that's endemic throughout theentertainment industry. The video caused controversy for the subliminal messageflashed on-screen for a split second throughout. It reads:\"'I guess that cunt getting eaten.'\"Indeed, the line in question does crop up as part of the lyrics of the 'song'.Here's an excerpt:\"And fit that tongue tongue d-deep in,I guess that cunt gettin' eaten,I guess that cunt gettin' eaten.\"Like most pop market-aimed rappers featured on MTV and mainstream radiostations, Azealia Banks' target audience will be mainly children and teenagers.\"What other gems of wisdom do we learn from '212,' you might reasonably ask?Well, how about:\"I'm a look right nigga,Bet you do want to fuck,Fuck 'em like you do want to cum,You're gay to get discovered in my 2 1 deuce,Cock-a-lickin' in the water by the blue bayou.\"\"I can just see the pride on the faces of parents all over the world as theirten-year-old daughters swagger around the house reciting all this good stuff.The 'critics' certainly think it's great, anyway, if Wikipedia's entry on '212'is anything to go by:\"The song received universal acclaim, with critics complimenting Banks'versatile rapping style as well as her songwriting ability. 'The Guardian' gavethe song a positive review and placed it at number 2 on their 'The Best Songs of2011' list.\"And doesn't it speak volumes about where we're at that it did?The twisted morality of the BBC reared its head in 2014, meanwhile, when Radio 1announced its Teen Awards scheme by asking, 'are you 14 to 17 years old?' –clearly their target audience. They then immediately played Nicki Minaj's'Anaconda,' (a euphemism for big dicks,) which contains the lyrics:'This dude named Michael used to ride motorcycles,Dick bigger than a tower, I ain't talking about Eiffel's,Real country-ass nigga, let me play with his rifle,Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil.'Highly appropriate material for 14-year-olds to be listening to, I'm sure anyparent of one would agree.I HEARD IT ON MY RADIOAs a radio DJ of 20-plus years, I come with some authority on the type of lyricsthat are deemed acceptable for by legal stations in the UK and US. I wasn'tgreatly surprised to get pulled up by an angry station director for letting the'street' version of Sporty Thievz' 'No Pigeons' accidentally air, with the lyric'go home and fuck your babysitter.' It's fair to say the lines of acceptabilityhave been systematically blurred in recent times, however.In the 90s and early 2000s, words such as 'fuck 'and 'shit' were definiteno-gos, and were usually obscured by being spliced into the radio-friendlyversion of a track backwards, becoming 'cuff' and 'ish' respectively. Theintention is to avoid offending listeners who might be upset by hearing explicitlanguage, of course, or to protect children who might happen to be listening.You could certainly debate the effectiveness of such methods, given that hearingthe phrase 'cuff all y'all mutha-nickuff ziggin' leaves little to theimagination. But the advent of digital production brought even more questionable'censorship' methods. A common way of allegedly disguising the word 'fuck,'became to simply render the word so the end of it has a downward inflection,mimicking the sound of a turntable being turned off. This has become somethingof an industry standard. Even more ludicrous has been the muting-out of just themiddle vowel, so 'I don't give a fuck' now becomes 'I don't give a f(silence)ck.Because there's no telling what the original word was from that, right?The opening lines to Nicki Minaj's track 'Only,' demonstrate the technique, (the*s denoting a split-second of silence.)\"I never f*cked Wayne, I never f*cked Drake, all my life, man, for f*ck's sake.If I did I'd menage with 'em and let 'em eat my a*s like a cup cake.'Well, now that the 'u' in fuck and the 's' in ass have been muted, it'sperfectly acceptable for radio play. Who could possibly get upset now? Feel freeto have a listen to the 'clean' version for yourself: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=FIw4C2yqD5I [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=FIw4C2yqD5I]Things have become even more farcical, however, with certain non-swear words nowbeing singled out for censorship. The radio version of Snoop Dogg and Pharrell's'Drop It Like It Hot' mutes the word 'suicide' from the line: 'the interior likesuicide, wrist red' as Pharrell describes his Phantom car. On 'Get Right' by AyoBeats featuring Abel Miller, the word 'cocaine' has its second syllable muted.It makes all the difference, you know.My favourite absurd radio edit of all, though, has to be the 'clean' version ofJadakiss's 'Why.' The original 'street' version includes the line, (quitereasonably in my view,) 'why did Bush knock down the towers?' Those behind theradio edit deemed it appropriate to mute the word Bush, however, so the linebecomes 'why did (blank) knock down the towers?'Well, that's cleared that one up then. No complicity from the Bushadministration in the events of 9/11 after all. Phew.SELECTIVE MORALITYThese all stand as examples of what I call Selective Morality. According to thecorporate entertainment machine, it's just fine for eight-year-old girls to heartheir idol Rihanna exclaiming 'whips and chains excite me' and 'bitch betterhave my money', or Katy Perry advising that 'I kissed a girl and I liked it,' orto watch Disney cartoons with erect penises cleverly disguised into the artworkso as to only be perceived by the subliminal mind. But we can't possibly havethese same kids hearing the words 'suicide' or 'cocaine' in a song on the radio.That's just not acceptable at all.Selective Morality would also have been at work when BBC Radio 1 DJ Mike Readimposed a ban on Frankie Goes To Hollywood's 'Relax' in 1984 in protest at itsobscene lyrics . . . right in the era when there would have been massivecomplicity to cover up the fact that Jimmy Savile and others were sexuallyabusing children on BBC premises. Did someone say double standards? Read, whofor a time revelled in being a lookalike of his friend and tennis partner CliffRichard, joined a bizarrely-behaving Frank Bruno as a guest at Savile's funeral,gushing their praise for him as 'a great man,' a year or so before Savile'sexposure as a sex monster.I raised the Selective Morality issue with Lenon Honor when we studied thecontent of Kanye West's extremely dark 'Yeezus' album for a 'Good Vibrations'podcast. We discussed a line in the song 'On Sight', where Kanye states that \"weget this bitch shaking like Parkinsons.\" This had incurred the wrath of theParkinsons Society, and several other groups, for its trivialisation of theeffects of Parkinson's Disease. Elsewhere, offence was caused to some Asianpeople by a line on 'I'm In It', where Kanye states that he needs somesweet-and-sour sauce before performing cunnilingus on Asian women. I canunderstand the sentiments in both cases, but what struck me as strange was thatlyrics such as these were taken in isolation and scrutinised, while the rest ofthe album's depraved content completely flew under the moral radar. The albumcontains multiple references to 'niggas,' 'hoes' and 'bitches,' as well as todark occultism and demonic possession. It seems all that is just fine in today'sscene. The same dynamic was at play when Rick Ross got dropped from asponsorship deal by Reebok after apparently advocating date-rape on the Rockotrack 'U.O.E.N.O.' with the line: \"Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’teven know it, I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain't even know it.\"(Molly is a slang name for MDMA, or ecstasy.) While this was clearly anirresponsible and insensitive line, it's far from the only morally reprehensiblething Rick Ross has ever had to say!As Lenon observed:\"The nature of the entertainment industry is like social engineering. You bringpeople along a particular course. If you call black people 'niggers' for longenough, soon enough they'll start calling themselves 'niggers.' I've been on abasketball court where you have Asian people calling each other 'nigger.' Thesame with white people. It's social engineering over time. Calling women'bitches' and 'hoes' is now normalised. And now, we're even seeing dark occulticreferences in certain lyrics being normalised! It's all been so propagandisedthat people have been de-sensitised to it. So now when they hear it it's not abig deal. But then when they hear something like 'I got this bitch shaking likeParkinsons,' people are shocked. The only reason people no longer react withshock to hearing references to 'bitches' and 'hoes' or 'niggers,' is because,over time, we have been conditioned to just think of it as 'normal' andacceptable.\"With Miley Cyrus simulating fellatio on a blow-up doll at concerts attended bychildren under ten and sporting a strap-on cock in promo shots, and Nicki Minajproclaiming on track that 'I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt,' ('Roman's Revenge,')it's difficult to imagine how the popular music scene can be debased anddegraded any further. But I'm sure they'll find a way.THE WEAPONISATION OF SOUNDWorking alongside the degeneration of lyrical content, has been the mutatedproduction methods within 'hip-hop.' A couple of decades ago, sampling was stillrife – one of the original hallmarks of the art-form. Popular producers such asDJ Premier, Large Professor, Pete Rock and Q-Tip routinely took select portionsof old soul and funk records, and looped them over a newly-created drumbeat togive a track its underpinning rhythm. Those who study the science of sound haveremarked that a track employing a sample in this way carries some of thesignature energy and ethos of the original record. Either way, the use ofsamples spelled a creative and imaginative way of making new records; audiotrain-spotters had a field-day trying to identify the original sounds, and itprovided a way for hip-hop to retain a connection to black music sounds andstyles that had gone before.The fashionability of sampling started to wane as the 90s turned into the 2000s.The excuse generally given was that, music law being what it is, it became tooexpensive for record labels and their producers to keep making the publishingpayments that were necessary when old recordings were used. Given the hugeprofits that A-list rappers generate for their corporations – plus the fact thatmusic giants like Sony and Universal would have had a stake in the originaltunes anyway – this seems more like a cover story for the real reason samplingwas phased out.It was part of the plan for the music to be deliberately detached from blackmusic styles of old and to lose its soul. Noughties mainstream 'hip-hop' wasdesigned to have an effect on the subconscious mind. Sample-based beats werereplaced by newly-created rhythms, coming in the early 2000s fromsuper-producers like Timbaland, Just Blaze, Swizz Beats, The Neptunes and KanyeWest, (before his switch from producer to rapper.) These producers did stillemploy some sampling, but by-and-large, their trademark sound involved newinstrumentation. By the dawn of the 2010s, 'hip-hop' creations relied heavilyupon digitised production, bringing artificial electronic sounds. The tempo oftracks started to fluctuate wildly, too. Whereas a standard hip-hop tune fromthe 80s or 90s would have a steady rhythm of between 90 and 105beats-per-minute, by the 2010s, tracks were coming in with wildly differing beatpatterns, putting a strain on the ear of the listener, not to mention giving DJsa hard time trying to mix them and make a set flow naturally. The 'hip-hop'producer of choice in recent times has been DJ Mustard out of Los Angeles. Hissignature style, heavy on the synthesised handclaps, is now all over the work ofpretty much every A-list artist, from Chris Brown to Lil' Wayne to Tyga toTinashe to Wiz Khalifa.As any audiophile will confirm, there are sound frequencies which are harmoniousand natural to the human energy field, and which synch with our brainwavepatterns, and there are those that do the opposite. When the latter aredeliberately used they have an unsettling and discordant effect on the listener.In the same way that sound has been proven to heal and restore the human body toholistic health, it can have the reverse effect, too. Appropriately-structuredsounds can generate a range of negative emotional responses, includingmelancholia, depression and rage.These can all occur without a listener having any idea that it's as a result ofthe music they're listening to. We're into the realms of A=440 versus A=432hzhere, which is a theme I intend to get into in 'Musical Truth 2,' (as it'salready become clear that there needs to be one!) I've personally been unable tolisten to what passes for 'hip-hop' for at least the past eight years. If I'mever unfortunate enough to have a track by Lil' Wayne, Drake, Big Sean, Future,2 Chainz, Nicki Minaj or their ilk come on the radio, I have to reach for theoff-button in a mad panic, because these tracks actually make me feel unwell.There's something going on at an unseen level. (TV and radio ads have the sameeffect on me now, too.)ALL BASES COVEREDAs if to drive home the absolute corporate dominance at all levels of the USmarket, even those artists commonly thought of as 'conscious' rappers, whosemusic has stayed outside of the obvious corporate agendas, have offered the oddclue as to the true nature of their industry owners. Common, generally thoughtof as offering thoughtful and positive rhymes throughout his canon of work, putout the track 'Universal Mind Control' alongside Pharrell Williams in 2008. Thetitle speaks for itself, and it came with a video very much pushingTranshumanist imagery. De La Soul, heralded as the original 'Native Tongues' rapcrew, put out a promo pic recently showing frontman Posdnous striking the sametired one-eye pose that all the more obvious puppets of the industry do. De Ladefendants will claim that the pose is mocking and ironic, but I wonder if thiswould really be the case? Would a group with a fan base in the tens of millionsrisk many of them getting it twisted in this way, knowing how it would workagainst them if their clever joke were to be misunderstood?Erykah Badu's place, meanwhile, remains as open-for-discussion as her overallimage and style always have. She was the girlfriend of the aforementionedCommon, in the midst of further inter-industry relationships with Andre 3000 ofOutkast, (with whom she had her first son,) and fellow Texas-born rapper TheD.O.C, (with whom she had a daughter.) She then had a third child with equallyenigmatic rapper Jay Electronica, of whom, more in the next chapter.Having changed the spelling of her first name from Erica in protest at it havingbeen a slave-name, Badu has always been marketed as something of an Earthgoddess figure, very spiritual in nature, showing a reverence for the religionsof Ancient Egypt, or Khemet. These credentials were very much cemented by herdebut album, 1997's 'Baduizm.'As the years progressed, however, some suspect symbolism started to creep intoher work, some of it hinting at Transhumanism, (a robotic/ cyborg headpiece in apromo shot,) and some at the presence of Monarch Programming, (she wearsbutterfly wings on the sleeve to her 'Erykah Badu Live' album, and guests in thevideo to the song 'Queen' by Janelle Monae, which is absolutely laden withtrauma-based mind control symbology.) Other esoteric and mystery-school imageryhas routinely appeared in her promotional material and live shows.Badu has never been a stranger to controversy. Her most infamous video, to thesong 'Window Seat,' sees her stripping naked as she walks the streets of hernative Dallas, culminating at the spot of the JFK assassination, at which pointa shot is heard and she falls to the ground bleeding blue blood. Go figure.MOVE OVER, SCARFACEReferences to 'The Illuminati' have become commonplace in mainstream hip-hoplyrics, to the point that they have eclipsed the frequent references tolegendary gangster characters like Scarface and Don Corleone as a way ofcourting controversy. There is almost a cachet of 'cool' that has come to beassociated with the idea of a mysterious powerful cabal, with rappers droppinghints that they are a part of this elite group. Chat forums and Youtube threadsare alight with claims from fans that such-and-such an artist has sold theirsoul and is 'in the Illuminati.' (And of course, for every such comment, there'sanother blasting the poster as a 'retard' or a 'fuckwit,' and denying that anysuch group exists.)The truth is that, first of all, the 'Illuminati' is a much-misunderstoodphrase, in its broadest sense standing as a catch-all term for the networks ofsecret societies that control human activity from the top down. It's doubtfulthat a singular organisation by that name is in current existence. Secondly, theelite class to which it refers, reserve membership only for those of certainselected bloodlines, or for deeply trusted associates who have shown themselvesto be unquestionably down with the agenda. The idea that they would accept intotheir ranks former street hustlers and heroin pushers who have sold their soulas a way of escaping their ghetto lifestyle, is laughable. These individualsaren't 'in the Illuminati', they're merely the rank-and-file foot soldiers doingits dirty work, (although it's rumoured that Jay-Z has joined the ranks of TheBoule, an elite secret society with membership restricted solely to blackpeople.) It's more likely that the elite controllers harbour nothing butcontempt towards those prepared to degrade their morals in exchange for a quickfix of fame and fortune. Either way, the fashionability of 'the Illuminati' hasbeen gradually drip-fed to the current generation of music fans.One of the earliest references came from Mobb Deep frontman Prodigy, in hisguest verse for LL Cool J's 'I Shot Ya' remix in 1995, where he states:\"Illuminati want my mind, soul and my body, secret societies trying to keep theyeye on me.” Later, on the song 'Skull & Bones,' he proclaimed: \"I shine,illuminate, yeah, my aura is awesome. Illuminati is us, we are the origin.\" Inthe same year, on 'Been There, Done That,' Dr. Dre stated: \"Money is the root, Iwant the whole damn tree. Ain’t tryna stick around for Illuminati. Got to buy myown island by the year 2G.\"More recently, on 'Holy Ghost,' (featuring P Diddy/ Puff Daddy, appropriatelyenough,) Rick Ross rhymes: \"They say I’m gettin’ money, must be Illuminati,talking to the Holy Ghost, in my Bugatti.\" Fellow Maybach Music artist Meek Millpreferred rhyming 'Ferrari' than 'Bugatti,' meanwhile, on 'Dreamchasers:' \"I’mgetting money, must be Illuminati. They think I signed up 'cause I just bought anew Ferrari.\" He then managed to slip in a reference to a Maserati on 'FenderUp': \"Illuminati wanted my mind, soul, and body. They asked me would I trade itfor all for a Maserati.\"On 'Hiipower,' Kendrick Lamar offers: \"Who said a black man in the Illuminati?Last time I checked that was the biggest racist party.\" Fellow new-generationrapper J Cole went all-out on 'Villuminati' from his 2013 album: \"These nextthree bars is dedicated to the retards, keep on asking me about the Illuminati.Is you stupid, nigga? Young black millionaire, old white billionaires. I'm surethat they can do without me. And I ain't really into sacrificing human bodies.\"Nas, strongly rumoured to be a high-ranking initiate, blurred clarity somewhatwith a line on his verse for the DJ Khaled track 'Hip Hop,' which personifiesthe hip-hop art-form as a woman. Seemingly stating that suggestions of anIlluminati plot within hip-hop were ill-founded, he states: \"Confused fans thinkthat she illuminates, demonic.\" Either way, Nas certainly seemed to becommunicating the agenda when he titled his 2006 album 'Hip Hop Is Dead.' Bythat point it had been cold in the ground for quite a few years, and Nas wouldbe one to know.High Priestess of the Industry Madonna then went all the way in 2014, with asong actually entitled 'Illuminati,' presenting the idea that this was some kindof benevolent religious movement dedicated to the uplifting of all humanity.The lyrics began:\"It’s not Jay-Z and Beyoncé; it’s not Nicki or Lil' Wayne,It’s not Oprah and Obama, the Pope and Rihanna,Queen Elizabeth, or Kanye.And later:\"Rihanna don’t know the New World Order,It’s not platinum-encrypted commerce,It’s not Isis or the Phoenix,The Pyramids of Egypt.\"Don’t make it into something sordid.\"Phew, that's that all cleared up then.This was a blatant piece of propaganda at the hands of the industry machine, togive kids the idea that they were now all clued-up on what this mysterious'Illuminati' is because they heard it in a Madonna song, and that's all theyneed to know about it.These are just a few 'Illuminati' namechecks in tracks of recent years. Many,many more are available.RUE THE DAYOn 20th March 1969, a meeting took place in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, attendedby a number of paediatricians who were part of the Planned Parenthoodorganisation. This, in turn, was connected to the Rockefeller Foundation whichwas, and still is, heavily involved in eugenics and the long-term massdepopulation programme. A guest speaker, Dr. Richard Day, addressed thedelegates. All in attendance were asked to put down their notepads and switchoff any recording devices, as the information they would hear was to betop-secret. Thankfully, one delegate, Lawrence Dunegan, did take notes, andalmost 20 years later in 1988, recorded some tapes detailing what he rememberedof the meeting. In it, Day, (who died in 1989,) had outlined a massive array ofchanges that were to be introduced into all aspects of human society over thecoming years and decades. Being a part of the Rockefellers' inner circle, he wasin a position to know. In among measures such as compulsory sterilisation, thedestruction of traditional family values, the promotion of homosexuallifestyles, the introduction of genetically-modified crops and fluoridatedwater, and the suppression of cancer cures as a means of population control,Day's comments regarding the future deployment of music and the entertainmentindustry speak for themselves. Dunegan recalled:\"Movies would gradually be made more explicit as regards sex andlanguage . . . There would be pornographic movies in the theaters and ontelevision . . . He said something like: 'you'll see people in the movies doingeverything you can think of.' . . . Violence would be made more graphic. Thiswas intended to desensitise people to violence . . . People's attitudes towarddeath would change. People would not be so fearful of it but more accepting ofit, and they would not be so aghast at the sight of dead people or injuredpeople. We don't need to have a genteel population paralysed by what they mightsee. People would just learn to say, 'well I don't want that to happen to me.'\"As regards music, he made a rather straightforward statement like: Music willget worse . . . Lyrics would become more openly sexual . . . Older folks wouldjust refuse to hear the junk that was offered to young people, and the youngpeople would accept the junk because it identified them as their generation, andhelped them feel distinct from the older generation . . . This aspect was sortof summarised with the notion that entertainment would be a tool to influenceyoung people. It won't change the older people, they are already set in theirways, but the changes would all be aimed at the young who are in their formativeyears, and the older generation would be passing. Not only could you not changethem, but they are relatively unimportant anyhow.

There is no matter.”Albert Einstein (1879-1955)THE NATURE OF EVILBefore we move on, a little background would appear to be relevant to explainthe context in which many of the happenings detailed in the following chaptersoccur.Satanism is not what most have been trained to think it is. The religious pointof view – particularly within Christianity – holds that it is the worship of asingular supernatural entity known as the Devil, and with such pseudonyms asLucifer, Beelzebub and of course, Satan. For many, these are expressions of thesame entity, and it is a paradigm which the same forces that created thereligious systems themselves, find it very convenient to have the majority ofthe general public believe. It serves to keep large numbers of people uniformlycontrolled through preying on their primal superstitious fears. Just asimportantly, it keeps them from doing any kind of personal research into thereal concept of Satanism and the black magic ritual practices that go with it.Just blame the evils of the world on 'the Devil,' goes the approach, rather thantake any personal responsibility by acknowledging your own part in the dynamic,and how your own behaviour might be continuing to perpetuate the problems thathumanity faces.The word 'Satan' comes from Hebrew, and means adversary or enemy. In theesoteric context, the original Hebrew word can be taken to mean an adversary tothe Christ consciousness – nothing to do with the figure of Jesus, but insteadconcerned with humans accessing higher levels of consciousness and re-connectingto the divine source from which we all emanate. The concept of Jesus and othermessianic figures are symbolic of this alchemical process. Satanism stands asthe absolute antithesis of humans achieving this, seeking instead to keep themgrounded in base consciousness, attached to the ego and all the materialtrappings of this physical plane. Given that the thoughts of the majority ofpeople in the world today – from the moment they get up in the morning to themoment they go to bed at night – are concerned solely with what they themselveswant or need right here and now, without a single consideration towards thewellbeing of others, most people can be said to have been manipulated by societyinto becoming Satanists. It's a statement that will horrify many and bringinstant denial, but it doesn't stop it from being true. Are my immediate andpersonal needs, whims and desires taken care of right here and now? Am I all OK?Yes? Well then, what else in the Universe could possibly matter? That'sSatanism.Satanism on an organised basis, is rooted in an understanding of Natural Law, orthe law of cause-and-effect, and the recognition that, in this energeticconstruct in which we find ourselves, every action has a reaction. But Satanismdenounces the moral aspect of this dynamic – the idea that there are absolutesof right and wrong behaviour set into place by the creative force behind theUniverse. Instead, it teaches that the individual is their own God who gets tomake up their own interpretation of right and wrong – or reject any semblance of'right' at all if they choose. A direct quote from the Church of Satanorganisation, (to be found in the FAQ section of its own www.churchofSatan.com[http://www.churchofSatan.com] website,) sums up this mindset as follows:\"We see the Universe as being indifferent to us, and so all morals and valuesare subjective human constructions. Our position is to be self-centered, withourselves being the most important person (the 'God') of our subjectiveuniverse, so we are sometimes said to worship ourselves.\"This worldview completely disregards any thought or care as to the effect anindividual's self-serving actions may have on any other living thing, and it'ssummed up in the title of one of the principal ceremonies performed at theannual Bohemian Grove gathering – the Cremation Of Care. Bohemian Grove is alarge, privately-owned area of redwood forest in Northern California, where therich, famous and powerful of the world meet each Summer, dress in robes, andperform various rituals including a mock sacrifice, (it's apparently 'mock',anyway,) in front of a 40-foot stone effigy of an owl, designed to represent thedemonic entity known in the ancient world as Moloch. This gathering is adocumented fact, and there's a famous photograph of Richard Nixon and RonaldReagan there in 1957, both of whom would go on to become US presidents. Thosewho summarily scoff at the idea of 'a conspiracy' without bothering to do anounce of independent research of their own, might like to ask themselves why theso-called 'leaders' of this world feel the need to enact this stuff every year,and why the mainstream 'news' always forgets to tell us about it. 'Care' is anexpression of the sacred feminine principle inherent in the Universe, whereas'action' is the sacred masculine equivalent. These two values need to bewell-balanced and at work in an individual, in order for them to fully observethe two principal tenets of Natural Law. More of this in the final two chapters.SEQUESTERED UNDERSTANDINGSSatanists have a knowledge of the esoteric workings of the Universe, and as in(hijacked) Freemasonry and other fraternal orders, the degrees of knowledgeincrease the further up the chain of command you go. So an entry-level Satanistwill have only the most basic understanding of what their practice is all about.The real knowledge is retained by the high priests. A central tenet of mysteryreligion magick is to keep this knowledge limited only to those who are deemedworthy of it. There are deliberate efforts to keep great truths about the natureof reality hidden from the vast majority of the population – those consideredthe profane ones. Dark occultists utilise the power differential that thisknowledge gives them over the rest of the population to their tacticaladvantage. It suits them to have the bulk of the people, on whose life-forceenergy and tacit approval they rely to be able to carry out their activities, incomplete ignorance of how Natural Law and the Universe works. Little surprisethen, that this type of knowledge is nowhere to be found in schools, colleges,universities or any other so-called 'seat of learning.'This is why there are Satanists and other dark occultists at the very top of allprofessions and walks of life, from politics and commerce, right through to theentertainment business. They've made it their mission to infiltrate theseinstitutions and ensure that Satanic ideology is filtered from the top-downthroughout daily human affairs, to a population left absolutely clueless as tohow they're being manipulated.This ideology feeds very much into eugenics. The dark 'elite' practitionersbelieve that they themselves, through the advanced knowledge that they closelyhoard, have the right to decide who in society gets to propagate their genes,and who, conversely, does not. It's a mindset that's summed up nowhere betterthan on the notorious Georgia Guidestones in the US, a series of granitemonoliths which were erected in a remote location in March 1980, and which wereinscribed with certain ideologies in line with what's commonly referred to asthe New World Order – the masterplan of the elite controllers for the rest ofhumanity. The stones contain ten 'guidelines' inscribed in eight modernlanguages, with a shorter message written in Babylonian, Classical Greek,Sanskrit, and Egyptian hieroglyphs. All of the guidelines feed into what'sclearly in place throughout the planet already. But the Satanic ideology ofmaintaining the human population by deciding who gets to live and who dies, issummed up in the first two – 'Maintain humanity under 500,000,000 in perpetualbalance with nature.' and: 'Guide reproduction wisely – improving fitness anddiversity.'The fact that this aim is inscribed in stone and put on public display for allto see also ties in with the concepts of free will, consent and tacit approval,as explored in our chapter on Predictive Programming. No-one can say theyweren't told.HEAVY VIBESThe rituals that form a central part of Satanism (and other forms of dark occultpractice,) meanwhile, are based in an understanding of the true nature of thisreality – that all apparently 'physical' matter is actually an expression of thesame universal energy force, simply in different states of vibration at anendless array of frequencies. The lower the vibratory rate, the more apparentlydense the matter in question will be. All living things, and all theirsurroundings, are expressions of the same energy force. Any individuals orgroups with a deep understanding of this knowledge – along with a malevolentintent towards the rest of humanity and a desire to keep this knowledge withintheir own closely-controlled circle – stand to gain a powerful advantage overthe rest of the human population, and this is precisely the dynamic which hasbeen played out in this world for many, many thousands of years.Satanic rituals, therefore, are all about the manipulation of energy to bringabout certain vibratory states, and therefore, to 'physically' manifest certaindesired outcomes. The vibratory frequencies involved are extremely slow, whichis the realm of fear-based emotions generated by humans. These include guilt,anxiety, hatred, jealousy, regret, despair . . . all negative emotional stateswhich keep humans very much grounded in this 'physical' reality, and very muchcut off from their true nature as inter-dimensional spirit-souls. This is whyhuman society is structured to trap the majority of people in these fear-basedstates, and many researchers have pointed out that these collectively allow fora connection to other realms of existence, in summoning non-human entities. Theyfeed energetically off of fear-based energy which serves as sustenance for them,and they crave a constant supply of it, hence the ongoing need for rituals to beperformed in the same tried-and-tested fashion, over and over again. They areperformed at key geographical points on the earth's energy grid, too, frequentlyat vortex points where two or more 'ley' or energy lines cross and the earthenergy is naturally amplified. By performing dark rituals at these points, thenegative energy is then absorbed into the grid and re-distributed, helping tospread the 'bad vibes' far and wide.Far-fetched as it may at first sound, this is a concept that has been referencedin ancient texts, legends and religious writings by civilisations from all overthe world, spanning vast ages. The entities that are evoked through bringingabout an energetic state compatible with theirs, have been known by many names.They are the demons spoken of in The Bible, the Djinn of Islamic lore, theArchons spoken of by the Gnostics, the Chitauri of the South African Zulutradition, and many, many others. It's the same concept as the over-simplifiedChristian 'Devil' or 'Antichrist,' only very much in the plural rather than thesingular. These entities can only be temporarily brought into this state ofexistence through being summoned or 'invited,' which is where the concepts ofconsent and free-will choice come into play again. Satanists make a consciouschoice, through their will and intent, to bring these entities intomanifestation. In seances, similarly, entities have to be 'invited' in beforethey can take possession of a human body.KNOCK THREE TIMESI'm alarmed to realise that I've actually witnessed a Satanic ritual almostfirst-hand – though I didn't understand it to be such at the time. In 2004 Iwent to the Czech capital of Prague with my wife to play a DJ gig, and we bookedourselves into lodgings on the recommendation of a DJ mate who'd stayed thereshortly before. The venue wasn't a hotel as such. It was a grand restaurant inan old building on the side of a sloping hill overlooking the old city, andaccessible by a hillside car on a track. Above the restaurant were two guestrooms, both served by a kind of annexe room with a billiard table in. I noticedthat the annexe had a metal spiral staircase in the corner leading to some kindof loft. Our room was tastefully decorated and furnished, with a largefour-poster bed.We spent the evening downstairs in the restaurant where there was an air ofcelebration, as a musician who looked very much like bearded Benny from ABBAplonked away at the piano, and kept glancing our way with a knowing smile. Hourslater, we'd gone to bed, but had both been awoken by something at the same time– around 3am. We heard movement in the annexe outside our room, and suddenly,there were three firm knocks in short succession on our door. This put me onimmediate alert as we weren't expecting anyone, and something about the knockseemed unsettling so we didn't respond. Shortly afterwards, we heard creakingfloorboards and footsteps from the loft area above us, and a form of low vocalchanting. The atmosphere turned unfeasibly cold. At one point, I sensed whatfelt like a hand on my shoulder and turned around to see what my wife wanted.She was right over the other side of the bed and couldn't possibly have touchedme from there.By some miracle we did get back to sleep, but remained shaken by the experience.As we headed back downstairs, we noticed the venue was adorned with paintingsdepicting what looked like grinning demonic entities, lunatic asylums, andvariations on Dante's 'Inferno'. We decided to explore further up the hill onwhich we were situated. Taking the hillside car to the top, we found a largeflat area with a massive inverted pentagram etched into the ground. I've trawledthe internet for information on this venue for the past few years, but can findno reference to it or the things that go on there. However blatantly it might beadvertised by the pentagram, the place appears to remain a best-kept secretstrictly for those in the know.Understanding what I now do about black magick rituals, it's clear that wewitnessed one that night. It seems that we were assumed to be there to take partin it, rather than having naively stumbled upon the place by accident as we had,hence the knowing smiles from Benny. The knock on the door was our invitation totake part. The air becoming cold was a reflection of the energetic shift thatwas being brought about. I don't like to think of what else might have beengoing on right above our heads.Max Spiers touched on the power of Satanic ritual in his on-line interview for'The Bases Project' in 2014:\"We have in our DNA the ability to conjure and call upon certain entities if aritual is done in the right way. The reason rituals are so important to them isbecause whenever you do it, you're then re-activating the morphogenetic field ofanybody else who's ever done that ritual before. And if you know what you'redoing you can bring them into being.\"THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT SATURNWhatever entities it might connect with, Satanism is also very much about theinfluence of the planet Saturn, whose name would appear to be directly derivedfrom 'Satan'. So many clues are hidden in language and placed right there inplain sight, but get missed through a daily over-familiarity with the words thatmost never think to question.There have been many methods of depicting Saturn through the mythology of theages. In the ancient world, the planet was referred to as 'The Dark Sun,' andhas also been known as 'The Dark Lord.' Some scholars have suggested that Saturnwas the original Sun of our solar system, before it was displaced by somemonumental heavenly cataclysm that gave birth to our current Sun.Whatever the scenario, Saturn is always depicted as having a negative,controlling effect on humanity. It represents hierarchical structure, order andcontrol. Its ancient symbol resembles an extended lower-case h, with a cross atthe top. It has been suggested that this is where the cross seen atop many asupposedly 'Christian' church originates, and that in fact, Christianity, justlike Islam, are fronts for much older systems of Saturn worship. Saturn'scolours are black and blood-red. This is why judges and priests wear blackrobes, and why the Trooping Of The Colour ritual of the British monarchy issteeped in black and red. Saturn has also been represented through history as ablack cube, from which the Ka'bah at Mecca is derived, (the Muslim followerswalking around it in concentric circles mimicking the cloud patterns persistentat Saturn's north pole,) as is the black 'mortar board' hat that universitygraduates wear. These institutions were all set up in reverence to Saturn, withthe vast majority of initiates having no idea that they're a part of it.Saturn is associated with time, a construct attributable to this 'physical'reality, and which doesn't exist outside of this realm. Saturn is seen as aforce which governs the passage of time, and which therefore brings ageing andeventual 'death' to humans and other living things. For this reason, the figureof 'Old Father Time' is actually a depiction of Saturn. It is the Greek figureof Cronus/ Cronos/ Kronos, which was seen to govern time, and from which we getwords such as 'chronology,' all concerned with the measurement of time.It is also a symbol of agriculture and harvesting. Saturn is the figure of thehooded, scythe-wielding Grim Reaper, representing a bringer of death and aharvester of souls. Cronos was also depicted with a scythe, or sickle, andsometimes a harp. The hammer-and-sickle emblem of the Soviet Union is anotherevocation. Throughout ancient civilisations, Saturn was symbolised as an old manwith a white beard, an icon that feeds very much into the festival ofSaturnalia, celebrated by the Ancient Romans and based around the 'death' of thesun at the Winter Solstice, from which we got the modern concept of Christmas.No great surprise to find Father Christmas as an emblem of this event, then,another old man with a white beard, and alternatively known as Santa, anone-too-subtle anagram of Satan! The Dark Sun is also the inspiration for thecharacter of Set, (sometimes known as Seth,) in Egyptian mythology. This figurewas said to be a god of violence, disorder and upheaval and was the enemy ofHorus, representing the Sun (or Son) of Man. In Arabic, the word 'Shatain' meansSatan, 'the devil,' or any vicious person or animal. 'Al Shatain Ramad,' meaning'the Devil of Ramadi,' was the nickname given to Chris Kyle, the inspiration forthe Hollywood blockbuster 'American Sniper', who is said to have killed up to160 alleged 'insurgents' during the second Iraq 'War,' before falling victim toa fatal bullet himself in a classic example of consequentialism in action.Saturday is, of course, named after Saturn, and is the day in the Western worldwhere people give their energy to celebrating the weekend in a leisurelyfashion, unwittingly making a subtle energetic connection to Saturn in theprocess. It represents the 'holy' day, meanwhile, in certain religious cultures.Saturday is the sixth day of the week, and Saturn the sixth planet in the solarsystem. From this comes Saturn's strong association with the number 666, 'thenumber of The Beast,' which goes some way to explaining why this particularnumber crops up so much in popular culture. The dark priest-class that controlthe entertainment industries – along with so many other walks of life – worshipthe energetic influence of Saturn.As the veteran occult researcher Jordan Maxwell has commented:\"The planet Saturn is very important. The Nazi party were the most SaturnalianBrotherhood of war and destruction. They always knew Saturn had rings, the Lordof the Rings. Saturn is the God of this world. From that we get the dark side ofThe Force, Darth Vader. Remember Darth Vader with his Nazi helmet speakingthrough his masonic triangle? . . . The god Saturn was referred to as El. If youcontinue today to worship the planet Saturn, you become known as an elder, yougot elected, with elections, now you’re one of the elites, now you’ve gotelevated.\"And according to author Fritz Springmeier:“Saturn is an important key to understanding the long heritage this conspiracyhas back to antiquity. The city of Rome was originally known as Saturnia, orCity of Saturn. The Roman Catholic Church retains much of the Saturn worship inits ritual. Saturn also relates to Lucifer. In various occult dictionariesSaturn is associated with evil.”AN INSIDE STORYAuthor, public speaker and radio show host Mark Passio ofwww.whatonearthishappening.com [http://www.whatonearthishappening.com], hasrevealed that he was a low-ranking member of various dark occult groups in hisyounger years. He has explained that he was born into a typically CatholicItalian-American family in Philadelphia, and was inducted into traditionalchurch ceremonies from childhood, where he gradually came to observe thehypocrisy of the church and its people, causing him to rebel and seek theabsolute antithesis of the institution which he found so repellent. This turnedout to be the Church Of Satan, then still under the leadership of its originalHigh Priest Anton LaVey. The young Passio's skills as a writer, communicator andmusician had marked him out as being potentially useful to the group. Within afew years, however, Passio says he had become wise to the organisation's truenature, and his conscience could no longer allow him to continue. He stated hisintention to leave the Church and start revealing many of the occult teachingsthat he had learned there to the general public, and was met with no oppositionwhatsoever. Instead, he says, his former colleagues mocked him and wished himluck in what they considered a futile attempt to wake the masses up from themanipulated trance that they had been collectively placed under, such was theirconfidence in the worldwide Satanic ideology they had installed. These peoplereferred to the public disparagingly as 'the dead,' such was their view of thealmost non-existent state of their spirituality, and their confidence in theirown techniques of worldwide mind-control. They were also referred to as 'theunbegun,' as in they hadn't even taken the first steps on any kind of personaljourney towards spiritual enlightenment.In a January 2015 interview with Lee Ann McAdoo on Infowars' 'Nightly News,'Passio related some home-truths about the often misconstrued world of Satanismand Satanists.\"I became aware that this wasn't just an isolated group of individuals that werejust working with occulted, or hidden knowledge in order to, essentially, growtheir own personal power, but they were inter-networked groups of people whowere working together, and they came from an eclectic array of people from everywalk of life. In every social institution you can imagine, there were Satanistsplaced in positions of high influence and power within those institutions,including politics, banking, law, military, law-enforcement, entertainment,technology, medicine, education and every other area of our lives. And they werenot isolated individuals who were trying to increase their own power andinfluence. They were working together as a tight-knit unit towards a commongoal, and that common goal was to increase their own power and control at theexpense of everyone else's rights and freedoms.\"The occult is knowledge that has been hidden for particular reasons and held byvery few people. When you hide and hold very important knowledge tight toyourself, and you try to keep it sequestered from everyone else, what you aredoing in that instance is creating a power differential through the knowledgedifferential you've created. We've all heard the term 'knowledge is power.' Iwould have a slightly different take and say that knowledge which is applied canbe converted into real world power. And that is what these dark occultists dowho are using this knowledge, certainly not to uplift humanity. They're using itto create a knowledge differential in the world so that they can stay in power,and they can take advantage of the ignorant masses who have no idea what thatknowledge is or how it works.\"Occultism is effectively hidden knowledge about two over-arching fields ofstudy and endeavour. The first is the human psyche. The mind, and how the mindworks. All its inner workings and operations. I would call this 'the innerworld,' the inner world of the individual. And in the occult, this is oftenreferred to as 'the lesser arcana,' or the body of knowledge that constitutesthe microcosmic world, in other words, the world of the individual.\"Then there's a second body of knowledge that is all about the greater spirituallaws that, ultimately, the entire Universe is bound by and works according to.This would be considered the greater, or major arcana of knowledge, or themacrocosmic knowledge. It also includes the physical sciences, because much ofthe true knowledge about how the physical sciences work is also occulted orhidden from us, so that our society doesn't progress and advance in ways thatthe people who currently hold the reins of our society don't want it to.\"Separately, on edition 184 of his ongoing podcast series, Passio observed:\"Satanism is about me, me, me, me, all day every day. If I could explain to youwhat Satanism really is . . . when you say the term, everybody's mind goes tothe idea of the Christian devil, the red devil with the horns and the pitchforkand the tail. This has little-to-zero to do with what I am calling ideologicalSatanism. Satanists chose that name because of the archetypal connection to theChristian 'adversary' or 'opposer,' (which is what Satanism means in Hebrew,) tothe Christ consciousness – the higher mind, the connection to the higher self.The real saviour of the world, which is making that connection to higher-selfand higher consciousness, and really being aware of what's going on within usand around us. Satanists chose that image, because what they're really trying todo is keep people in low-vibratory consciousness so they can ultimately be ruledand controlled and put into slavery and bondage.\"What is it about Satanism and dark occult practices, and the top ranks of theentertainment industry? How and why should they be even remotely connected?Our story continues . . . "},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16A CERTAIN SACRIFICE?Blurring the lines between rituals and 'tragic accidents.'\"Who do you think you are?To them you are nothing but a piece of meat, and you're only as valuable as yourlast hit song,And when you make no more hit songs, nobody cares for you no more.\"Minister Louis Farrakhan of The Nation Of IslamOn the face of it, the worlds of dark energy/ ritual magic and the entertainmentindustry should have no interlinking threads whatsoever, and should be about asfar removed as it's possible for any two subject areas to get. Yet anever-ending array of hard evidence and revealing symbolism tells a differentstory, indicating that dark occult elements are a part of the very fabric ofthis industry, and have been since its inception. Many would go as far as tostate that the very reason for the corporate music, film and televisionindustries being set up in the first place, was so they could be specificallyused to cast malevolent spells into the minds of the unwitting general public,all the time under the guise of something that's cool, fun, and which peoplewillingly choose to bring into their lives.THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON GIVINGRitual sacrifice is a deeply horrific practice which has unfortunately been apart of human society for aeons. It has taken various forms among differentcivilisations. Although the fine detail of the religious belief systems differ,the common point is that such sacrifices are designed to appease whatever 'gods'or supernatural deities the culture in question believes in, and to attain theirblessing or goodwill. Although once a socially accepted part of many cultures,in modern times these practices have been denounced as the barbaric acts thatthey truly are. At least in the mainstream. Unfortunately, ritual humansacrifice never went away. It just went underground.There is evidence that the old mystery religion which presides over theentertainment industry – and so many other walks of life – is steeped in a needfor the continued offerings of human life-energy to its various deities, andthat the untimely deaths of many prominent musicians through the decades can beattributed to this very factor. This claim, understandably, is dismissed by manyas outrageous, and a step too far in what might otherwise have been a compellingstory. But as has hopefully become clear by this point, the world really is verydifferent to how we were raised to think it is. And, rather inconveniently, manymore dark and sinister things go on than most would be comfortableacknowledging. It becomes a question of just how much an individual wants todiscover truth, as to what places they're willing to go to pursue it.The Vigilant Citizen site provided some reflections on the suggestion ofindustry ritual sacrifices in a 2011 article:\"The phenomenon of stars dying at a young age in strange circumstances goesbeyond the well-publicised 27 Club. While this Club is 'reserved' to singersdying at the exact age of 27, many other types of artists have died inmysterious circumstances around the age of 30. Recently, the deaths of HeathLedger and Brittany Murphy followed the same pattern as those described above.Strangely enough, there often appears to be a media build-up around thesefigures before their death, documenting their odd behaviour or personalproblems. Were these deaths pre-meditated and part of some kind of sick ritualcarried out by the occult-minded elite at the helms of the industry? Arecharismatic stars being risen to fame in order to later sacrifice them, creatinga worldwide mega-ritual? Is the wave of shock and grief surrounding these eventsharnessed in some way by high-powered occultists?\"These concepts might sound totally ridiculous to the average person but, tooccult initiates, the magical potency of human sacrifices has been recognisedand documented by the rituals of many ancient civilisations. In 'SecretSocieties and Psychological Warfare,' author Michael A. Hoffman II writes:\"The issue of controlling humanity with esoteric words and symbols encodedwithin a play, a media spectacular or a ritual, is one of the most difficult forpeople to comprehend. That is why most people are viewed with utter contempt as'cowans,' 'the profane,' 'the gentiles' and 'the goyim' by secret-societyinitiates'\"About mega-rituals, Hoffman writes:\"(Some murders) are ritual murders involving a cult protected by the USgovernment and the corporate media, with strong ties to the police.\"Such killings are actually intricately-choreographed ceremonies; performedfirst on a very intimate and secret scale, among the initiates themselves inorder to program them, then on a grand scale, amplified incalculably by theelectronic media.\"In the end, what we have is a highly symbolic ritual, broadcast to millions ofpeople, a Satanic inversion; a Black mass, where the 'pews' are filled by theentire nation, and through which humanity is brutalised and debased in this, the‘Nigredo’ phase of the alchemical process.\"A PROFESSOR SPEAKSOne of the most outspoken proponents of the idea that the music industryperiodically sacrifices the artists it has nurtured, has been Professor Griff,Minister of Information – a kind of intellectual public face – for thelong-standing hip-hop group Public Enemy. PE are one of the few groups to havemaintained their integrity and longevity through the drastically-altered hip-hoplandscape of the past 30 years, and their overall message of truth, knowledgeand empowerment – and the preservation of black culture and heritage – has beenlargely unchanged in this time. Their 2012 track 'WTF' included the line: \"I'mat the age, if I can't teach, I shouldn't even open my mouth to speak,\" whichresonates with me big-time. Griff's personal and passionate messages have beenvery much in-line with this ethos. Inevitably, though, they have not beenwithout their controversies.Griff, (born Richard Griffin in New York in 1960,) spent a stint in the US army,before launching a security service to work the hip-hop party circuit in hisnative Long Island. He was then recruited as an associate member of Public Enemyfor its formation and signing to Def Jam Records. Following two successful groupalbums, Griff hit the headlines in 1989 when he made public comments that werebranded 'anti-Semitic' and 'homophobic.' When these labels get applied, it'susually a sign that you've got a little close to the mark and upset someimportant people. Because of the social stigma systematically created by theRothschild-controlled Anti Defamation League of saying anything remotelycritical of someone who identifies themselves as 'Jewish' – regardless ofwhether the claim has any foundation or not – the minute the term 'anti-Semitic'comes into play, it spells instant discrediting of anything the individual inquestion has to say in the eyes of many. The same has become true of criticisinghomosexuals in recent times, which represents a major 180-degree turn since, asrecently as 1967, it was considered a punishable crime in the UK, (1982 inNorthern Ireland.) As the old wartime maxim observes, 'if you're copping theflak you're over the target.' And so Public Enemy frontman Chuck D had littlechoice but to announce that Griff had been axed from the group in the wake ofthe ensuing controversy. Griff rejoined shortly afterwards, was 'fired' again,and rejoined a second time, since when he has been appearing sporadically atlive shows. In his 2009 book 'Analytix', Griff apologised for his earliercomments, admitting they were misjudged.His position at the frontline of both the music industry, and specifically thehappenings within the hip-hop genre, quality Griff as a credible source ofinformation as to what goes on behind the public veil, and his lack of anycorporate affiliations has given him the personal freedom to speak candidly. Andhe has.Griff's assertion, made many times in interviews and public appearances over theyears, is that the hip-hop business – like all aspects of the music industry –is ultimately controlled by a dark priest class steeped in ritual magick, andthat aspects of their religious beliefs require them to make sacrifices ofcarefully-chosen individuals who have signed contracts with them. Thesecontracts go far beyond straightforward business deals, and in effect, representlifelong binding arrangements where the artist could be said to have 'sold theirsoul' to the corporation in exchange for a life of promised fame and fortune.This phrase can be taken either symbolically or literally. There would appear tobe a clause in some such contracts, however, which allows the controllers todecide how long the life of the performer concerned lasts.There is a secondary aspect to the sacrificial tenet, too. This involves theseartists giving up a nominated family member, close friend or associate, who willbecome their 'blood sacrifice,' thus enabling them to move up the ladder ofsuccess. The first level of this is referred to as the 20 Million Dollar Club,membership of which shows you're on your way. Those who reach the lofty heightsof the 100 Million Dollar Club and upwards are considered to have paid theheaviest personal prices, and to have demonstrated just how much they wanted thefame. Many researchers claim that all of the successful A-list stars in music,films, TV and sport will have made some kind of sacrifice of this nature, sincethey wouldn't have been elevated to such positions of prominence if they hadn't.Certainly, a delve into the fine detail of many celebrities' life stories doesreveal the untimely passing of family members and others.Professor Griff went into this subject area when he guested on an episode ofGreg Carlwood's 'Higherside Chats' podcast in 2014:\"These people have enough influence and power to have your wildest fantasiescome true. People that have put themselves into a position where they can dothat, oh yeah, they have a lot of power over the average person. You sacrificinga family member is absolutely nothing to these people. It's almost like, if youdon't, then you're not loyal to us. And I think that is the conversation that weare not having. What is the price that you will pay to be rich and famous? Thatis the question we need to ask. What is that price? What does that look like?\"And we don't know these individuals. Some of us will allow our mom to getsacrificed. Some of us will allow our girlfriends or wives to get sacrificed.Each of us knows what our own threshold is. And there are certain things thatI'm just not going to do. Other people around me will have taken it, and they'reprobably living a better life. Fortunately or unfortunately, one of mine is thatI'm not going to apologise for the truth. Poison me, burn my house down, shootat me, do whatever you feel you need to do. But I'm not going on record toapologise for the truth. I'm just not.\"The allure of you being rich and famous and successful and having enough moneyto buy anything that you want, to someone growing up poor and not really havinganything – which is the majority of us – the allure of living this kind of lifeis attractive to any one of us. No-one wants to live poor. So the whole idea ofyou having two or three cars, and a couple of homes, and living in the finestplaces, eating the finest food and doing anything you want to do, is veryattractive. I think we can agree, Americans are fucking lazy! We want to reapthe most benefits for the least amount of work.\"Griff wasn't speaking hypothetically in his reference to being shot at, poisonedand having his house burned down, by the way, as all of these have happened tohim over the years. Which could well be taken as further confirmation that hiscomments have touched a few raw nerves which would prefer not to be touched.The hip-hop genre specifically is said to offer countless examples of bloodsacrifices. Even those who scoff at such 'conspiracy theories' are forced toacknowledge that this musical genre, more than any other, has had anabove-average quota of casualties who just happen to have died prematurely forone reason or another. It's suited the Establishment to have the public put thisdown to the erratic and edgy lifestyles lived by so many hip-hop artists. Butsome closer examination of the finer detail, for those who are prepared to gothere, throws up a sea of strange anomalies.ALL ABOUT PUFFOne of the most frequently-cited examples is the suggestion that rapperChristopher Wallace, known as Biggie Smalls or The Notorious BIG, was offered upas a sacrifice. Professor Griff has always been direct in his accusationstowards Biggie's producer and mentor, Sean 'Puffy' Combs in this regard, as inthese comments given on the Amen-Ra Film Productions DVD 'Blood Sacrifice ForFame & Fortune & Freemasonry.'\"All the evidence points to the fact that he (Combs) had something to do withit. Puffy wasn't no real rapper like that, but as soon as Biggie was off thescene he came out with his album. Now he's up in the 300, 400, 500 MillionDollar Club. Jay-Z, as I'm told, is the one that was called in by The HiddenHand, by the Illuminati, and they gave him a $40,000 nice room on a beachsomewhere where he spent the weekend with Denzel Washington and some otherpeople sipping $20,000 bottles of Crystal. Him and Beyonce. And when he cameback off that trip, the beef between him and Dame Dash began.\"Sean 'Puffy' Combs' father Melvin, was a drug dealer and small-time hustler inHarlem, and was an associate of Frank Lucas, the character portrayed by DenzelWashington in the movie 'American Gangster'. Melvin was shot dead while sat inhis car in New York when Puffy was three years old. In a 2013 interview, Puffcommented: 'I have his hustler's mentality, his hustler's spirit . . . He was adrug dealer and he was a hustler, so I learned early in life that there's onlytwo ways out of that dead-end jail. It made me work even harder.\"The young Combs first found success in the music industry as an intern at MCARecords, under the mentorship of executive Andre Harrell. Combs was charged withlaunching his own imprint, Uptown Records, through which he launched suchartists as Mary J Blige and Jodeci. Harrell had hired Combs on the advice ofDwight 'Heavy D' Myers, whose act Heavy D & The Boyz were among the artists onUptown. Tragedy loomed in December 1991 when Puffy, together with Heavy D,staged what was billed as their Celebrity Charity Basketball Game, with manyhigh-ranking black music artists scheduled to perform at The Nat HolmanGymnasium at City College, New York. The promoters had oversold tickets, and thecommotion that occurred through large numbers of people trying to force theirway in, resulted in a stampede in which nine people were trampled to death.Andre Harrell hired the celebrated lawyer William Kunstler to defend Combs, andhis team fought the families of several victims over wrongful death charges foryears. Harrell subsequently fired Puff, describing him as 'too arrogant' for hisown good. It is an incident largely missing from official biographies of SeanCombs, and an early encounter with death marking the very start of his longcareer. (Heavy D died aged 44 in Los Angeles in November 2011 shortly afterreturning from a tribute concert to Michael Jackson in Cardiff. The cause of hisdeath was cited as complications from deep-vein thrombosis in the leg, withheart disease also a factor.)Ultimately, the tragedy did little to harm Combs' career. From Uptown, he wenton to found his own Bad Boy Records label through Clive Davis' Arista, thevehicle through which he launched the career of The Notorious BIG, arguably thenumber one hip-hop star of the mid-90s. In 2009, former Bad Boy recording artistMark Curry released his book 'Dancing With The Devil: How Puff Burned The BadBoys of Hip-Hop,' in which he gave an insider's account of how every artist thatever recorded on Bad Boy has ended up either dead, broke, in prison, a drugaddict, or has turned to religion, (Ma$e became a Christian minister, Loonconverted to Islam, Shyne to Judaism.)Curry documented some of Puff's favourite operating tactics in his book:\"Puff has an annoying habit of inserting himself into the songs and videos ofall the artists on his label, and it was common knowledge that many Bad Boy actsresented him for this. Asked about the practice in the July 1995 edition of amagazine aimed at black teenagers, Puff said: 'I like performing with myartists, I like talking on the records, and I like being in videos.'\"But he also revealed an ulterior motive: 'It protects my interests in terms ofwhat I'm going to do in the future. Say if a company tries to remove me. It'sgoing to be hard to remove me and still have all my acts and the same level ofintensity and the same flavour and feeling.'\"Even worse, Puff charged the artists for his appearances on their records andvideos, usually without them realising it until they received their paltrypublishing royalty statements. That's when they discovered that a large sum oftheir money had gone to fees which were doubled, tripled and even quadrupledbecause of Puff's 'special guest appearance.' He charged artists, for example,for having his Bentley in their videos – which he insisted upon – then took atax credit for business use of the car.\"A few had complained publicly that Puff was upstaging them as much as he waspromoting them. They felt that his presence was more of a distraction than anattraction, since critics considered Puff a mediocre rapper and marginal dancerat best.\"Aside from the moderate success of singer Faith Evans, who was briefly marriedto Notorious BIG and pregnant at the time of his murder, the only success storyto emerge from Bad Boy Records has been Puffy himself, who consistently crops upin the top three of the annual Forbes Rich List in hip-hop, his personal wealthestimated to be in the hundreds of millions. He must be doing something right.The strong implication that Puff had earned some friends in influential placescame from a well-publicised incident in December 1999. Puff was in attendance atClub New York in Manhattan alongside Jennifer Lopez, said to be his girlfriendof the time, bodyguard Anthony 'Wolf' Jones, and Shyne, one of the artistssigned to Bad Boy Records. A shooting ensued in which three people were injured.Witnesses said the incident erupted when Puffy walked into someone in the cluband a drink was spilled. An argument followed in which the other man tauntedPuff about his wealth and threw cash at him as an insult. This caused acommotion among the crowd. Shyne is claimed to have drawn a gun and attempted tofire at the man, but ended up wounding three bystanders instead.Puffy is said to have been seen firing a gun into the ceiling of the venue. AsPuff and his entourage hurriedly left the club, their car got pursued by copsand ran through 11 red lights, at which time a gun was seen being thrown fromthe window. Shyne, then 21, was charged with, and later convicted of, attemptedmurder, assault, and reckless endangerment. He was sentenced to ten years inprison in June 2001, getting released in October 2009. Shortly afterwards, heannounced that he had converted to Judaism, was studying the Torah 12 hours aday, and had moved to Jerusalem under the new name of Moses Michael Levi.For his part, Puffy was facing a possible 15 years imprisonment for illegal gunpossession and bribery charges. He stood accused of offering his driver, WardelFenderson, $50,000 in cash to say the gun was his.In the event, Puff walked away scot-free. There has been much suspicion that hewas cut a behind-the-scenes deal allowing for his career to continue undeterred,and that his VIP status had marked him out for special treatment. (He has beenstrongly rumoured to be a Freemason.) This 'favour' would have left him beholdento his superiors, however, as there's no such thing as a free lunch in thisgame.Puff's name re-emerged in intriguing fashion in 2013, when music industryexecutive-turned cocaine druglord Jimmy Rosemond was interviewed by federalagents. According to an article on the Smoking Gun website, Rosemond reportedbeing quizzed about the sexual activities of many music industry key players,which included being asked directly whether Sean 'Puffy' Combs was \"havingsexual relationships with under-age boys.\" Where did that question come from?!TUPAC & BIGGIEBiggie was gunned down in the early hours of 9th March 1997, shortly afterleaving an after-party for the Soul Train Music Awards in Los Angeles, hosted byQuincy Jones's 'Vibe' magazine and Qwest Records. As the SUV he was travellingin pulled up at a red light, a Chevrolet Impala was seen to draw up alongside.Shots were fired and Biggie was hit four times. He was pronounced dead shortlyafter being rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, (more on this place later!)He was 24. Puff, Biggie's mentor, manager and apparent best friend, happenedfortuitously to be riding separately in the car ahead. It seems he didn't handlethe situation well. In his book, Mark Curry reports that Puff ran over toBiggie's car distraught, crying \"Oh God, please let him pull through.\" Puffclaimed to have been the one to call Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mother, to breakthe bad news, but this turned out to be a lie. Curry adds:\"Puff was freaking out,' (Junior MAFIA group member) Lil' Cease said in a recentdocumentary. Cease said that while he and members of Junior MAFIA were trying tofigure out how to get Biggie back home, Puff went back to his hotel, grabbed hisstuff, and was on a plane to New York in less than three hours.\"There have been multiple claims as to the responsible party in the years since'97. The theory that it was rogue elements within the LAPD crops up repeatedly,as does the suggestion that Biggie was the victim of warfare between rivalstreet gangs in LA. Either way, despite the shooter being identified as a blackmale by witnesses, and sketches being drawn up, no-one has ever been chargedwith The Notorious BIG's murder.Biggie's death occurred almost exactly six months after that of hisone-time-friend-turned-opponent, Tupac Shakur, in startlingly similarcircumstances. Tupac had been attending a boxing match alongside Death RowRecords supremo Suge Knight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on the evening of 7thSeptember 1996. He, Knight and their entourage were reportedly involved inassaulting a member of the Crips street gang, Orlando 'Baby Lane' Anderson, uponexiting the MGM Grand lobby. After stopping at a venue known as Club 262, Tupacand entourage left in their Sedan. As they were at a red light, a Cadillac wasseen to pull up at the vehicle's side and a series of gunshots were rapidlyfired. Tupac was hit several times and Knight was reportedly hit in the head byfragmentation. As in the Biggie case, the shooters' car sped off never to beheard of again. Unlike Biggie, Tupac did not die instantly. He remained in acritical state in hospital for a further six days, largely in an induced coma,eventually being pronounced dead on the afternoon of Friday 13th September atthe age of 25.(It's interesting to note that prominent music industry deaths often occur ingroupings. Brian Jones and Jim Morrison died exactly two years apart, forinstance, in 1969 and 1971. In between were the deaths of Jimi Hendrix and JanisJoplin within days of each other in 1970. T-Rex frontman Marc Bolan's deathoccurred in 1977, when the mini being driven by his girlfriend Gloria Jonescrashed into a fence post and a tree in Barnes, South West London. I hadn'tuncovered any bizarre elements to this one, suggesting that it may have beenthat rarest of things – a genuine 'tragic accident' – until I learned that theregistration mark on the car was FOX 661L, with FOX corresponding to 666 inPythagorean numerology! A few years before, Bolan had released the song 'CosmicDancer' which included the possibly prophetic lyric 'I danced myself into thetomb.'There was then a gap of three years until John Lennon's assassination inDecember 1980 was followed by the death of Bob Marley five months later. Reggaelegend Peter Tosh and hip-hop pioneer Scott La Rock were both shot dead in 1987.Tupac and Biggie then occurred within six months of each other in 1996/ 97, withMichael Hutchence shortly after in late '97. Aaliyah and Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopez''accidents' occurred within 8 months of each other in 2001/02, followed by JamMaster Jay later that year, then Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse and WhitneyHouston, in 2009, 2011 and 2012 respectively.)Just as with the Biggie case, no-one has ever been charged with Tupac's murder.Two police forces from two separate cities just don't seem to be able to solvetwo murders committed in busy public streets in front of dozens of witnesses. Iwonder if the cases would have remained 'unsolved' had it been, let's say, RodStewart and Mick Jagger as the victims? Again, with the Tupac murder, there havebeen allegations of police corruption and/ or organised crime affiliations. Apopular alternative theory, however, is that Tupac's murder was arranged by SugeKnight and served as his own ritual sacrifice to the industry. He was certainlytaking a chance by riding in the same car as Tupac if he did indeed have priorknowledge of how the events of that night were going to go down.In what would appear to be a couple of examples belonging right in the earlierchapter on Predictive Programming, both Tupac's and Biggie's deaths appeared tobe eerily foreshadowed on a pair of now-infamous record sleeves in the monthsleading up to their murders. Earlier in 1996, Tupac had released an album by theintriguing title of 'The Don Killuminati: The 7-Day Theory,' credited to his newalter-ego of Makaveli. The image depicted his naked body being crucified. Theartist name was in homage to the Italian writer and philosopher NiccoloMachiavelli whose works Tupac had studied while in jail. Machiavelli lived from1469 and wrote the book 'The Art Of War.' It is claimed, (but equally disputed,)that he faked his own death at the age of 25 to fool his enemies, returning inpublic 18 years later at the age of 43. This led to speculation that Tupac mayhave somehow faked his death and would do the same. He would have been 43 in2014. The last entry on the sleeve notes on the reverse of the album reads 'Exit– 2Pac, Enter – Makaveli.' Meek Mill, an affiliate of rapper Rick Ross and anartist on his Maybach Music Group label, released a track entitled 'Tupac Back'in 2011.A highly-detailed examination of the theory that 2Pac may have somehow faked hisown death resides here: * http://real-eyes-realise-real-lies.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/2pac-amerikaz-most-wanted-dead-or-alive.html [http://real-eyes-realise-real-lies.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/2pac-amerikaz-most-wanted-dead-or-alive.html]In Biggie's case, all three of his albums appeared to indicate a morbidfascination with his own death. This has even led to claims that he may havesomehow been complicit in his own sacrifice. These rumours have been fuelled bythe bleak track 'Suicidal Thoughts' which depicts him killing himself, andincludes lyrics like: \"When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell. Cause I'm apiece of shit, it ain't hard to fucking tell. It don't make sense, going toheaven with the goodie-goodies. Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and blackhoodies.\" And: \"I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end thisbullshit. Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit.\" The voice of PuffDaddy is heard at the end of the track saying, \"ayo, Big . . . ayo, Big.\"Either way, his breakthrough LP was titled 'Ready To Die,' the double-album thatwas completed, but only released after his murder, was titled 'Life AfterDeath,' and the collection of previously-unreleased tracks that seems inevitablein the case of a deceased artist, (do you think there could have been a reasonwhy these tracks in particular were unreleased?) was titled 'Born Again.' Whatmany distraught fans found so strange about 'Life After Death', was that thegloomy sleeve image showed Biggie in a funeral suit standing next to a hearsewith the licence plate 'B.I.G.' This album included the songs 'You're Nobody'Til Somebody Kills You,' and 'Somebody's Gotta Die.'A very interesting article appeared in 2012 on the egotripland.com[http://egotripland.com] site, based on an interview with Ebon Heath, who wasthe art director for the photoshoot that spawned the cover image for 'Life AfterDeath.' Heath revealed that, of the many pictures and themes that wereconsidered for the album, it was Puff's ultimate decision for the funeral themeto be used. He recounts:\"In the beginning we spoke about the album. Puff was really his own art director– it was more us supporting his vision and coming up with it from the conceptualstages. And he was like, 'Life After Death' is gonna be bright. It’s gonna beabout blue skies and green grass. And this isn’t some dark shit, this is reallyabout the 'life' part, not the 'death' part.\" . . . Then the graveyard location came up where we shot – my partner Michelethinks it was Cypress Hills Cemetery on Jamaica Avenue in Brooklyn . . . I don'tknow, it was weird. Like it somehow switched. We were out there in the middle ofthe graveyard at the end of the day, and it sort of switched just as a conceptjust in the process of us shooting in this graveyard. And it was bugged, too,because it was a cold day. Big had messed up his leg in a car accident, and hewas on a cane. So he was already sort of grumpy. So already that was a weirdvibe.\"THE KING IS DEAD, LONG LIVE THE KINGOften when prominent artists are removed suddenly, they are quickly replaced byanother who has been groomed for stardom, and is swiftly moved into position. Itseems to be an additional twisted component of the process. The long-heldsuspicion in this regard is that Biggie Smalls' murder paved the way for Jay-Zto be ushered into place as the number one hip-hop star, a role he's pretty muchheld ever since. (When it comes to Tupac Shakur, meanwhile, Professor Griff'sidea is that DMX and Ja Rule were ushered into place shortly after his murder,to fill the vacancy for an edgy 'thug-style' rapper that had been left.)Biggie and Jay-Z recorded the track 'Brooklyn's Finest' together, which appearedon Jay-Z's LP debut 'Reasonable Doubt.' It included the line: 'the number onequestion is can the Feds get us?' Jay-Z then cropped up on the track 'I Love TheDough' from Biggie's second album 'Life After Death,' which by that point was aposthumous one. 'The City Is Mine,' a track from Jay-Z's follow-up album 'In MyLifetime Vol. 1,' released in February 1998, is said to be dedicated to Biggie'smemory and includes the line 'you held it down long enough, let me take thosereins.'There's some crossover in theories here, as some have speculated that Biggie mayalso have served as a sacrifice on the part of Jay-Z, given that his ownmonumental success only occurred after Biggie's removal. Other theories point toJay-Z's nephew, Colleek D. Luckie, serving as his sacrifice. Luckie, (a morbidlyironic name in the circumstances,) died in an accident in the Chrysler 300 thatJay-Z had bought him as a graduation present. Jay-Z addressed this in his song'Lost One' with the lyrics:\"My nephew died in the car I bought,So under the belief it's partly my fault,Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought,Place any burden on me, but please, not that, lord.\"Whatever the circumstances, Jay-Z was evidently chosen by the elite controllersas 'their man,' and he went on to faithfully serve the agenda for the next20-years-plus.The young Jay-Z – real name Shaun Carter – spent years as a struggling rapperbefore making it big, and has made no secret of his early years selling crackout of his home in the Marcy housing projects of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn.It's a story which continues to provide the basis for his rhymes to this day. Heis acknowledged to have been put on in the rap game by an older mentor from theMarcy, a rapper by the name of Big Jaz, later renamed Jaz-O, thus inspiring thesimilarly-formatted Jay-Z moniker, (also said to be a variation on his nicknameas 'Jazzy.') It's not hard to see why a glittering contract offered with thepromise 'you'll never be poor again' would have been so attractive. It's oftenstated that 'there's no way out of the ghetto.' Maybe there is but, as it turnsout, you'd have been better off staying there.1996 was the year chosen for Jay-Z to blow up. He emerged with a fully-formedrecord label co-owned by himself, Damon 'Dame' Dash and Kareem 'Biggs' Burke.The name chosen was the eyebrow-raising Roc-A-Fella Records, named after theGerman-Jewish Rockefeller family, (Rockenfelder in the original German,) citedas one of the principal Illuminati bloodlines. The three partners split in 2004when they sold their 50 per-cent interest in Roc-A-Fella Records to Def JamRecordings. Jay-Z was appointed President and CEO of Def Jam by this point. Dashand Biggs went their separate ways. Little more has been heard of Biggs. Dash,however, very much fulfilled the role of entrepreneur, involved as he was in thelabel's Rocawear street clothing spin-off, two film companies, Armadale Vodka,and the Pro Keds sneaker brand. At his peak, he is said to have been worth anestimated $50 million. In his early years he swept floors in a barber shop andsold newspapers to earn enough to buy sneakers.It has been observed that Dash's own success would not have been facilitatedwithout his own heavy price to pay, and Professor Griff and others have remarkedthat his own blood sacrifice to his masters may have been the singer Aaliyah, towhom he was engaged.AALIYAH AND LEFT EYEAaliyah was a child star, appearing on a TV talent show aged 10. She signed toJive Records aged 12, where she was moulded as a singer in the R&B genre. Almostimmediately, she was embroiled in controversy over the nature of herrelationship with R Kelly who was described early on as her 'mentor,' andproducer of her first album titled, perhaps tellingly, 'Age Ain't Nothin' But ANumber.' Rumours began to circulate that Kelly was involved in a sexualrelationship with the underage Aaliyah. Paedophilia in the entertainmentindustry yet again. The Quincy Jones-owned 'Vibe' magazine uncovered a marriagecertificate showing that the pair had wed in 1994 while Aaliyah was only 15, andthat she had lied about being 18 in order to obtain it. This marked the first ofmany allegations against R Kelly involving sexual relationships with underagegirls. In one, a video emerged purporting to show Kelly having sex with a minor,and urinating on her. Despite several allegations, however, he always managed toavoid jail. Could he have friends in high places?On 25th August 2001, Aaliyah was in the Bahamas to film the video to her song'Rock The Boat.' She and eight others were killed when their twin-engine Cessnalight aircraft crashed close to the runway upon leaving Marsh Harbour Airport.The official account of what happened had the pilot, Luis Morales III, down asunlicenced, and with traces of cocaine and alcohol in his system, implying thatthe crash was a tragic accident due to pilot error. (Why am I getting flashbacksof what was said about Princess Diana's driver Henri Paul at this point?)Alternative theories have emerged, however, including the suggestion that theplane was somehow intercepted by remote-control using technology known to be inthe hands of the CIA, and deliberately flown into the ground. Either way,accusations have persisted that the murder was somehow connected to Damon Dash.The video had been directed by high-ranking industry favourite Hype Williams,who did not board the plane. Aaliyah's family also had a lucky escape, as herbrother Rashad, now a writer, film director and screenwriter, revealed that oneor more members of her immediate family were almost always present at her videoshoots, but that all had been fortuitously absent from this one.Back with the strange stuff, Germany's 'Die Zeit' newspaper published posthumousexcerpts of an interview with Aaliyah, in which she appeared to be relatingpremonitions of her death:\"It is dark in my favourite dream. Someone is following me. I don't know why.I'm scared. Then suddenly I lift off. Far away. How do I feel? As if I amswimming in the air. Free. Weightless. Nobody can reach me. Nobody can touch me.It's a wonderful feeling.\"Could these be the memories of a Monarch-programmed alter?It has been noted that shortly before her death, Aaliyah had been filming themacabre movie 'Queen Of The Damned,' in which she portrayed a vampire queen bythe name of Akasha whose blood ends up being drained by her successors as herpowers diminish. It was commercially released six months after her death.Aaliyah was a close friend of Kidada Jones, the daughter of Michael Jacksonproducer (and 'Vibe' magazine founder) Quincy Jones. (Jackson and Aaliyah bothdied on the 25th of the month, as did Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes.) Kidada Jones hadalso been engaged to Tupac Shakur, who also died an untimely death. There areinterconnecting links between key players everywhere you look in these stories.Left Eye's own story is another riddled with dark and strange elements. She diedin another 'accident,' again just outside the continental United States, thistime in Honduras on 25th April 2002, when she swerved and flipped the SUV shewas driving on a busy road. All eight of the passengers she was carryingsurvived, while she herself died from a massive blow to the head and a fractureat the base of her cranium.Lopes provided the 'L' part of the group TLC's name, generally providing the rapverses while bandmates T-Boz and Chilli sang the verses. The 'Left Eye' nicknameis one that will spark the curiosity of anyone who has read the chapter onsymbolism, with all its connotations to the infamous all-seeing eye, and shewould often appear in videos and in photos with her eye highlighted or paintedaround. Many interpretations of Egyptian mythology maintain that the Eye ofHorus is a sign representing sacrifice and rebirth. Her private life was notwithout turmoil, and she's remembered for having burned down the house ofAtlanta Falcons football player Andrew Rison in 1994. Inevitably, the mainstreammedia portrayed her as an alcoholic with mental health issues in the wake ofthis.Left Eye had gone to Honduras in 2002, at the tail end of a turbulent careerwith TLC that involved much in-fighting and legal wrangling, seemingly in a bidto 'detox' and clean up her life. She was reportedly engaging in yoga, hikingand natural dieting. A film crew was following her movements for 27 (!) days fora 'VH1 Rock Docs' film, which came to be titled 'The Last Days Of Left-Eye.' Thecrew were reportedly filming at the time of her death.The author known as Isaac Weishaupt goes into much detail on Left Eye's passingin his fascinating book 'Sacrifice: Magic Behind The Mic:'\"Some theorists speculate that she could have been triggered to actually wreckthe SUV through an elaborate mind-control program, similar to the film 'TheManchurian Candidate,' where the victim has a small section of the mind takeover and perform an automated action without the conscious ability to stop it.The support for this theory is that she appears to have a calm, trance-likedemeanour, (although I disagree with all of that because the documentary seemsto show otherwise.) If she actually wrecked the car on purpose, the only thingthat would support the theory would be the fact that she believed she waspossessed by a spirit named Nikki. During the documentary she says: \"Anytime Igot drunk this girl Nikki would show up. When I got drunk I was just a differentperson. When these two started battling it out, I had to create a third personto straighten them out.'\"She later details an evil twin named Nina as well, and that she was creatingall these different personalities, and that's when her problems started. Thissounds like the problems that occur when people start dabbling in magic andevoking other people's spirits. This also happens in ghost hunting or ouijaboard sessions where people try to contact the spirit realm and becomepossessed. It's possible that Left Eye was plagued by these spirits before shewent to Honduras and was truly trying to cleanse them away.\"The website PanacheReport quoted Left Eye's mother, Wanda Coleman, as havingsaid: \"Her death was pre-destined. The Lord had already prepared me for Lisa'sdeath two years in advance.\"Her own fatal accident wasn't Left Eye's only tragic encounter during her timein Honduras. Almost three weeks earlier, a vehicle in which she was riding,driven by her personal assistant, knocked down and killed a ten-year-old boy,Bayron Isaul Fuentes Lopez, as he stepped off the sidewalk into the road. In theVH1 documentary, she states that she felt the presence of a spirit followingher, and that it may have been a mistake that the boy died and not her –particularly in light of the similarity of their surnames. Left Eye was widelyreported to have keenly dabbled in the occult, and right before her moment ofdeath, the VH1 film shows her holding a tin that seems to have housed a set ofTarot cards. A passenger in the back is heard asking for 'the cards,' rightbefore the SUV veers out of control.Additionally, Isaac Weishaupt observes that:\"The final few scenes before the day of filming Left Eye's fatal accidentincluded a chilling shot of Left Eye in her room, saying that whatever you feargets manifested when you're in Honduras. She said it's like going down a hill ina car and not hitting the brakes. Meanwhile, on the wall of the room, you cansee that she spray-painted a giant All-Seeing-Eye of Horus.\"She was also seen holding the dead boy's shoes, and says that she felt thespirit that is haunting her had killed the child by mistake. She also said shedoesn't believe in death, but rather transformation . . . The fact that she wasin possession of the dead boy's shoes is of concern because this is a practiceknown as Sympathetic Magic. Practitioners believe that this use of amaterial-world object would physically link a person to it. This is also usedwith voodoo dolls when they inflict pain upon the doll and the person feels itin a similar manner. In fact, this concept holds even more value when youconsider that Honduras has a population known as the Garifuna, who practice areligion that some compare to Haitian Voodoo. Left Eye's aunt had suspicions ofvoodoo because, not only did Left Eye die in an odd sequence of events, but heruncle, Anthony Lopes, also died. He accompanied her to Honduras and stayed afterthe fatal accident, only to succumb to congestive heart failure just monthslater.\"One implication is that Left Eye's death may have been some form of industryritual sacrifice, but equally, it may have been the result of her dabbling inthe dark occult magick that seems to permeate so much of the music game, andwhere certain artists seem to be possessed by, or at least in contact with,entities from outside of this physical plane. Who can really say what the casehere? Either way, portents and a general air of unease are present throughout.THE PROOF IS IN THE PROGRAMMINGAnother untimely and suspicious death in the hip-hop world is that of Proof, amember of the Detroit group D12, and a close childhood friend of Eminem. Proofwas shot dead during an altercation outside a nightclub in Detroit's infamous 8Mile district. The usual confusion and conflicting stories arise when it comesto the fine detail of what went down. Proof's death could well be dismissed asthe consequence of fights occurring in a dangerous part of town, were it not foranother piece of bizarre and unsettling Predictive Programming, which appearedto portray the incident in advance. The video to Eminem's 2004 single 'ToySoldiers,' depicts Proof getting shot and killed outside of a nightclub in verysimilar fashion to what came to pass on 11th April 2006. Did Eminem and thosewho control him have prior knowledge of Proof's demise? The cover to Proof's2005 album, 'Searching For Jerry Garcia,' (named after the Grateful Deadfrontman and CIA asset who had died exactly ten years earlier,) shows himclutching a skeleton, as if symbolically embracing death.HOLD THE AMBULANCEIntriguingly, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles figures heavily in thestrange deaths of many celebrities, causing some to question whether it housessome kind of mind-control facility. The Notorious BIG was 'rushed' there afterbeing shot, despite a closer hospital being reportedly available, WhitneyHouston's daughter Bobbi Kristina was 'rushed' there after being 'discoveredunconscious' the first time around, Britney Spears was 'rushed' there for a'medical examination,' actor Charlie Sheen, who achieved notoriety for publiclyquestioning the official story of 9/11, was 'rushed' there with a hernia pain.(He's since been rumoured to be HIV Positive.) Others who have died thereinclude Heavy D, Barry White, Minnie Riperton, George Gerschwin, Brittany Murphyand the film-maker Aaron Russo, another researcher whose work questioned theofficial story of 9/11 and implicated Nick Rockefeller as being complicit. Russojust happened to contract bladder cancer shortly afterwards. It's notnecessarily the place to be 'rushed' to, in my humble opinion.BLOOD SACRIFICE 101An indication of how far the idea of celebrities giving up loved ones inexchange for engineered fame and fortune has reached, came with a news storythat is shocking, yet carries an air of morbid hilarity. In 2013, it emergedthat a struggling would-be rapper from Virginia with the catchy moniker ofWafeeq Sabir El-Amin, had attempted to kill his best friend, since he believedthis would qualify as an acceptable sacrifice to 'the Illuminati,' who would inturn facilitate a successful career. After a night of smoking weed together, thefriend reported waking to find El-Amin pointing a gun at him. There was astruggle in which the friend was shot in the hand. He then grappled to grab thegun, with El-Amin getting shot in the stomach in the process. The news story, onthe Red Ice Creations website, stated:\"Deputy Commonwealth's Attorney Thomas L. Johnson noted that El-Amin had becomeobsessed with the Illuminati and truly believed that there was a link betweenhip-hop and the secret-society. In El-Amin's mind, he believed that a'sacrifice' was expected of people that wished to join the ranks of theIlluminati. Johnson went on to say that El-Amin believed the Illuminaticontrolled the careers of popular hip-hop musicians, and that they were the keyto success. Johnson also stated that before El-Amin shot his friend, hesupposedly exclaimed, \"You are my sacrifice.\"BODY COUNTThe idea of blood sacrifices is obviously extremely difficult territory totread, given that there's no direct proof for anyone outside of the circle thatany individual cases may have taken place or not. There are also a wide varietyof death methods involved, many of which would require complicity from otherparties in order to be kept secret if foul play is indeed at work. This is notbeyond the bounds of possibility, of course, particularly when you come to anunderstanding of how inter-connected everything is in the world ofsecret-societies. It's never the intention to cause undue hurt or offence to thefamilies of those involved, however. Any researcher into the subject, therefore,is only able to speculate on possibilities, rather than being able to lay claimto the definitive truth. With this in mind, the following are further examplesof possible blood sacrifices in the music industry that have been cited fromvarious sources. They remain suggestions only, of course, rather than provablefact, and readers must make up their own minds about each one, and do furtherresearch of their own if they wish. Any, or all of these deaths may indeed bedown to the factors given in the official story, but it would have been remissto have left them out of a chapter discussing matters of this nature.A perennial suggestion concerns the sudden death of Kanye West's mother, Donda.He was famously close to her, even dedicating a song on his second album to her,'Hey Mama,' while she was still alive, in which he spoke of his appreciation forher having instilled moral values in him. Donda died as a result ofcomplications following surgery for liposuction and breast-reduction in November2007. Kanye was visibly affected by her death, occurring as it did a few monthsbefore his split from fiancée Alexis Phifer. These events largely dictated thedark mood of his subsequent '808s & Heartbreak' LP, and as previously discussed,his music changed dramatically from this point on.Kanye used a very interesting turn of phrase when interviewed for 'Q' magazinein June 2015. When asked what was the biggest sacrifice he had made for hismassive level of success, he replied: \"my mom.\" He went on to add: \"If I hadnever moved to LA she'd be alive . . . I don't want to go far into it because itwill bring me to tears.\"Kanye isn't the only artist to have lost their mother quickly and unexpectedlyin recent times. Outkast frontman Andre Benjamin, better known as Andre 3000,had his mother Sharon die one day after his 38th birthday in May 2013, aged 58.She was said to have died in her sleep of 'natural causes,' with no furtherinformation having been made public. Just a few days later came the news thatBruno Mars was putting on a brave face and managing a smile as he arrived inWashington for a show, some days after his 55-year-old mother Bernadette haddied of a reported brain aneurysm in Hawaii.NWA rapper-turned-super-producer Dr. Dre is another titan of the hip-hop scenewho has had rumours follow him around for years. Most of these surround theuntimely death of his son, Andre Romelle Young Jr., in August 2008, who wasdiscovered dead in his bed by his mother. The coroner's report blamed it on anoverdose of heroin and morphine. An earlier death in Dre's family had been thepassing of Tyree Du Sean Crayon, Dre's half-brother from his mother Verna'ssecond marriage. The sombre track 'The Message' on Dre's '2001' album isdedicated to Tyree's memory, (although it is claimed that the track wasghost-written for Dre by rapper Royce Da' 5 '9 who receives no writing credit inthe sleeve notes.) There appear to be no pictures of Tyree on the internet, orinformation about when or how he died.Some have also suggested there is a connection between Dr Dre's phenomenallevels of success and the death of the singer Nate Dogg, who had collaboratedwith Dre on his single 'The Next Episode' along with otherprojects . . . although the same claim is often made with reference to fellowLong Beach rapper Snoop Dogg, with whom Nate was equally collaborative. Nate,real name Nathaniel Hale, died on 15th March 2011 from what were said to behealth problems brought on by multiple previous strokes.Others have suggested the early deaths of rappers Big Pun and Pimp C may havebeen connected to associates Fat Joe and Rap-a-Lot Records proprietor J Princerespectively.Rapper T.I. and Tameka 'Tiny' Cottle, formerly of the R&B girl group Xscape,lost their second child together when their daughter arrived stillborn sixmonths into the pregnancy in 2007. The previous year, T.I.'s personal assistantand lifelong friend Philant Johnson died when he was gunned down outside aCincinatti nightclub.Among other music-makers to have lost children young are Prince, whose son BoyGregory was born with Pfeiffer's Syndrome and died a week later, Led Zeppelinvocalist Robert Plant whose five-year-old son Karac died of a severe stomachinfection in 1977, and Marie Osmond, whose son Michael is said to have committedsuicide by jumping out of an eighth-floor window in 2010. A story thatdevastated the public in 1991, meanwhile, was the tragic death of Eric Clapton'sfour-year-old son Conor, who plunged from the open window of Clapton's53rd-floor apartment in Manhattan. Clapton fathered Conor with Italian modelLori del Santo while he was still married to Patti Boyd, who had previously beenthe first wife of George Harrison. Conor's death came during an unlucky periodfor Clapton; seven months earlier fellow musician Stevie Ray Vaughan, plusClapton's manager, agent, bodyguard, assistant tour manager and a pilot, had allkeen killed in a helicopter crash after leaving a gig in Wisconsin. Claptondedicated the song 'Tears In Heaven' to the memory of Conor. Inevitably,however, rumours have persisted that there may have been foul play involved inthe boy's fall.The subject of infant deaths also ties into other areas of human society since,as I hope has become apparent by now, all are ultimately linked at their veryupper levels. Something that seems to have flown under the radar of most of theBritish public, is the fact that the country's last three Prime Ministers haveall lost children in tragic circumstances. First off, Cherie Blair, wife of PM(and so many other things,) Tony Blair, suffered a miscarriage in 2002. In herrecently-published memoirs, Cherie actually revealed that her husband and his PRguru Alastair Campbell, had strategically timed the announcement of themiscarriage to 'avert false speculation about an early invasion of Iraq,'embroiled as the UK was at that time in the second engineered Gulf War(massacre.)Next up for the PM role following Blair's departure in 2007 was the highlyforgettable Gordon Brown. He and his wife Sarah announced the death of theirfirstborn, a daughter named Jennifer Jane, on 7th January 2002. She was said tohave suffered a brain haemorrhage ten days after being born.Brown's successor in 2010 was (distant cousin of the Queen – but don't worry,it's just another coincidence,) David Cameron. The previous year, he and hiswife Samantha had announced the death of their firstborn son, Ivan, who was saidto have been born with a rare combination of cerebral palsy and a form of severeepilepsy. Like the Blair and Brown children concerned, Ivan had been born in2002.Unlucky lot, these politicians.HIP-HOP ODDITIESAmong other deaths in the world of hip-hop that have raised suspicions are themurder of Run DMC co-founder Jason Mizell, aka Jam Master Jay, at a recordingstudio in Queens, New York on 30th October 2002 during the season of Halloween,(which in Pagan traditions, is always an important season for sacrifice.)Numerology is thought to be an important factor in other cases, with the date ofthe death holding special significance, as are planetary conjunctions and otherastrological influences. Many suspected a connection to fellow rapper 50 Cent.As Wikpedia puts it:\"In 2003, Kenneth 'Supreme' McGriff, a convicted drug dealer and longtime friendof Murder Inc. heads Irv and Chris Gotti, was investigated for targeting Mizell(Jam Master Jay,) because the DJ defied an industry blacklist of rapper 50 Centthat was imposed because of 'Ghetto Qu'ran,' a song 50 Cent wrote aboutMcGriff's drug history.Randy Allen, a former business partner of Jay's, one of the witnesses to theshooting, was also named as a suspect. Later, a man named Ronald 'Tenad'Washington was named as a suspected accomplice in the murder, as well as that ofRandy 'Stretch' Walker, a close associate of Tupac. Washington was neverconvicted, however, and no-one has been further investigated or charged withMizell's murder.\"A rapper whose early demise was highlighted by author Isaac Weishaupt aspossibly having an element of foreshadowing was Ol' Dirty Bastard, known as ODB,one of the original members of the Wu Tang Clan collective. Weishaupt points outthe tellingly paranoid nature of some of his lyrics leading up to his death inNovember 2004, such as: \"I need help because the black man is God, thegovernment is after me, and the worst is, black man is the devil\" on the song'Diesel.' And later: \"They already did 2Pac, my children, all six billionhumans, Biggie Smalls on the planet Earth, somebody help me!\" And on his pop hitwith Kelis, 'Got Your Money:' \"I'm the ODB as you can see, FBI don't you bewatchin' me.\" As Weishaupt continues:\"ODB said Bush had a personal beef with him and that the government was out toassassinate him. Similar to other artists and their downfalls, his last fewyears were spent in jail stints, legal issues and eccentric behaviour. Someclaimed that the government microchipped him because he made his way on to alist of the influential people that were outspoken enough to cause too muchcommotion. Officially he died from an accidental drug overdose of cocaine andTramadol, but others claim foul play. They say he fell on his knee at a show andasked for a painkiller, which a mysterious stranger gave to him, but he neverwoke up again.\"A few years after his death, it was revealed through a Freedom of InformationAct request that the FBI did in fact have a file on him, which includedstatements that the Wu Tang Clan was 'heavily involved in the sale of drugs,illegal guns, weapons possession, murder, carjacking and other types of violentcrime'.\"There was also the murder of the phenomenally-gifted Big L, a member of theDiggin' In The Crates crew, who was gunned down in February 1999 just a fewblocks from where he had grown up in Harlem. His slaying was seemingly connectedto the criminal activities of his brother; L was either mistaken for him, or wasshot in order to make a point. The prime suspect was a man named Gerard Woodley,one of L's childhood friends, who was arrested by police but later releasedwithout charge. Big L's murder, therefore, remains yet another from the black/hip-hop community that has been chalked up as 'unsolved.'THE ENIGMA OF GURU AND SOLARWhile endless scrutiny has gone towards the murders of Biggie and Tupac, (and toa lesser extent to the deaths of Jam Master Jay and others,) there is anotherlegendary hip-hop MC whose death is full of strange and dark factors and a glutof unanswered questions, but who rarely gets discussed at all any more. Guru,the former frontman of the group Gang Starr, is very much the forgottencandidate when it comes to premature deaths that smack of foul play. Guru wasone of my personal all-time favourites due to his smooth-voiced monotonedelivery, and incredibly incisive lyrics, which have meant all the more to mesince I 'woke up.' As far back as 1992 he made devastatingly candid observationson the true nature of the corporate music industry on the Gang Starr track'Conspiracy,' with lyrics like:\"Even in this rap game all that glitters ain't gold,Now that rap is big business the snakes got bold,They give you wack contracts and try to make you go pop,Cause they have no regard for real hip-hop.\"And later, on the title track of Gang Starr's 'Moment Of Truth' album, Guru camewith lyrics so on-the-money that they deserve to be taught in schools:\"Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge,You may not know the hardships people don't speak of,It's best to step back, and observe with couth,For we all must meet our moment of truth.\"Guru, known in his early days as Guru Keithy E, was born Keith Elam in Boston,into a middle-class family that was far removed from the ghetto lifestyle ofmany of his peers. His father was a judge and his mother a co-director oflibraries in the public school system. Having honed his rapping skills, he foundfame alongside the Texas-born, New York-based producer DJ Premier and rapper BigShug as the group Gang Starr, which released its first album in 1989, and wenton to be one of the most consistent and well-respected hip-hop acts of the 90s.In 1993, he released the first of his three solo 'Jazzmatazz' albums, fusingjazz influences with hip-hop rhyming, as a side project.By the early 2000s, Guru had reportedly fallen out with DJ Premier and ceasedtheir working relationship, instead beginning collaborations with aself-proclaimed 'super-producer' by the name of Solar, (real name John Mosher,and not to be confused with the French rapper MC Solaar.) Solar had appearedwith very little to show by way of a track record in hip-hop production, and hetook up the mantle of producing Guru's ongoing 'Jazzmatazz' series, as well ashis 'Version 7.0: The Street Scriptures.' Many Guru fans commented on thedecline in the standards of his music. By this point, it had become commonknowledge that Guru was an alcoholic and was suffering from other health issues,including depression and severe asthma.According to Guru's family members and friends, Solar seemed to gain amanipulative and controlling hold over him at this point. They have claimed thatSolar took any opportunity to reinforce the rift between Guru and Premier bytelling Guru that Premier hated him, and that he worked to cut Guru off from hisfamily. Guru's sister Patricia said: \"My brother and I were extremely close.Remained that way until he started working with Solar. So I know that Solar'spresence was the thing that caused our relationship to be different.\" Solarpublicly referred to himself as Guru's 'teacher' and 'healer,' also referring tohimself as a 'God,' and on one occasion, comparing his own life mission withthat of Jesus.According to Guru's close circle, Solar's relationship to the rapper was anabusive one. 'Jazzmatazz' collaborator Nick \"Brownman\" commented: \"I've seenSolar hit Guru full-on in the face. And the next day, Guru looked me in the eyeand said that he dropped some weights and hurt himself in the gym.\" Formeremployee of Solar, Tasha Denham, states: \"I had to get in-between them fighting,because Solar wouldn't quit . . . Guru had severe asthma, and I had to break itup. If I didn't, I think Solar would've kept beating him.\"Other strange things were happening, too. Guru no longer gave interviews or madeany public appearances without Solar by his side. In many cases, Solar answeredGuru's questions for him, and cut interviews and shows short on a whim. Fanscommented that Guru appeared increasingly withdrawn, vacant, thin, andultimately ill.On 28th February 2010, Guru suffered a cardiac arrest and went into a coma fromwhich he never regained consciousness. He died alone in hospital on 19th Aprilamidst reports that a clumped afro now appeared on his usually slick-shavenhead. Guru's family complained that Solar was preventing them from visiting himin hospital. After Guru's passing, Solar became CEO of 7 Grand Records, thelabel that Guru had started.Much of Solar's activity from this point was documented on a website,www.fucksolar.com [http://www.fucksolar.com], set up by a collective of Gurufans. Hacked e-mails from Solar were posted on the site. This may have been thefactor that enabled him to get fucksolar.com [http://fucksolar.com] taken downafter a few weeks.Among the site's claims were that Solar had attempted to embezzle hundreds ofthousands of dollars out of Guru's various business interests, that he had usedGuru's social media accounts to chat up and arrange sex with women, (despitebeing married,) and that he had made exaggerated, self-aggrandising claims abouthis own status as Guru's 'saviour.' Solar had also claimed that Guru hadawakened temporarily from his coma, the site reported, and had composed a letterappointing Solar as his sole representative. The authenticity of this letter waschallenged by Guru's family, who accused Solar of faking it. The family alsoaccused Solar of having announced Guru's death to the media before telling them,and of travelling with his body to the funeral home, passing himself off asGuru's brother.Much scorn, along with direct accusations, were directed at Solar on-line in theweeks following Guru's death. At first, Solar replied to everything that hadbeen written about him. Fans claimed that he was using false names to passhimself off as some third party, but giving himself away by his consistentlyappalling grasp of spelling, punctuation and basic grammar. Throughout, theysaid, he displayed a level of self-denial and a complete lack of conscience foranything he had done.It all raises the question of just where Solar came from, and whether he driftedinto Guru's life in some random, haphazard fashion, or whether he was sent intoGuru's inner circle by some outside party. It wouldn't be the first time thatthose who control the music game have turned against artists who espousepositive, conscious music. The air of gloom that pervaded Guru's last days haveled many to ask whether he had been put under some kind of dark, voodoo-likespell.Reflecting on the question, however, does tend to suggest that Solar wasfollowing a personal agenda, since the Satanic secret-society network does tendto reward those who play ball by elevating them up the ladder to fame andfortune, whereas Solar's career hasn't exactly flourished since 2010. In factit's probably safe to assume that there isn't an artist in the industry that'skeen to work with him given his track record.Ultimately, there has been no justice for Guru, and the tragic end to his liferemains a largely-forgotten and under-discussed chapter in music history. Hiswords live on eternally, however, allowing for reflection on their potency.Particularly the line from 'Moment Of Truth' that runs:\"Just as you get what's coming to you, everybody else is going to get theirstoo.\"LEGENDS REVISITEDThere are many who accept the idea of the music industry deliberately offingmany of its key artists, but who reject the suggestion of any ritual element tothe killings. They claim instead that the motivation is purely financial,stemming from the old adage that an artist is worth more to a label dead thanalive. There's certainly evidence to demonstrate how an artist's popularity canshoot way beyond what it might have been if they'd remained alive, with Tupacoften cited as an example, and the cynical ploy to increase the retail price ofWhitney Houston's back catalogue after her death in the run-up to that year'sValentine's Day offers further credibility. I'm not denying that corporate greedis a factor – particularly in the context of the lousy publishing deals thatartists often complain of, where contracts see to it that the corporationsretain the lion's share of the profit from their intellectual property whilethey themselves are left with crumbs. (It can be like that with book publishingdeals, too!) But I see no reason why both elements could not be at play intandem with each other; a decision is taken to take out a particular artist inline with the ritual magick of the dark religion, and the fact that thecorporations stand to make a killing, (no pun intended,) serves (for them) as avery happy consequence. This would also serve as a mutually beneficial way ofdestroying troublemakers who had become a thorn in the side of theEstablishment.Viewing things from this informed perspective does tend to cast new light on anumber of legendary rock music deaths. Here are just a handful of the mosthigh-profile ones, with a brief summary of some of the anomalies and unansweredquestions surrounding the official accounts. (For more on the deaths of ElvisPresley and Brian Jones see the earlier chapters.) These are quick overviewsonly and don't claim to be comprehensive, as to delve into the fine detail ofeach case would justify several entire books in their own right. But hopefully,these at least get across the fact that nothing about the official versions addsup, (as ever,) and the truth is highly obfuscated with all manner of foul playat work. To be entirely clear, I'm not saying that every one of these deathsdefinitely constituted some form of ritual sacrifice – just that in each case itdoes at least remain a possibility.JIMI HENDRIXLike Jim Morrison, Jimi Hendrix had taken on mythical status as an icon ofpro-peace, anti-war activism and youthful rebellion by the time of his death inLondon on 18th September 1970. Like Morrison, he was 27. His birthdate, 27thNovember, was the same as that of Bruce Lee, another iconic figure who diedyoung in mysterious circumstances. As author Alex Constantine commented in hisbook 'The Covert War Against Rock:' \"As the music of youth and resistance fellunder the cross-hairs of the CIA's CHAOS war, it was probable that Jimi Hendrix– the tripping, peacenik 'Black Elvis' of the 60s – found himself a target.\" AnFBI file obtained by a group of tenacious students from the University Of SantaBarbara in 1979 confirmed that Hendrix had been the subject of FBI surveillance,and furthermore, that he had been placed on the federal 'Security Index,' a listof 'subversives' to be rounded up and placed in detainment camps in the event ofa national emergency.Hendrix's is another death blamed on the sex, drugs and Rock & Roll lifestyle.It has gone down in the official record that he asphyxiated on his own vomit, asa consequence of ingesting barbiturates.It's widely acknowledged among alternative researchers that Hendrix's deathoccurred at the hands of his manager, Michael Jeffery, who hired a gang to breakinto Hendrix's Notting Hill hotel room and murder him. Jeffery was born inLondon in 1932, and after a brief bout of military service, embarked on a careeras an 'intelligence' agent. According to Hendrix biographers Harry Shapiro andCaesar Glebbeek, Jeffery often boasted of \"undercover work against the Russians,of murder, mayhem and torture in foreign cities.\" Jeffery was also acknowledgedto have ties with organised crime networks. Quite how these credentialsqualified him as a rock musician's manager over all other contenders, therefore,remains unclear. It seems Jeffery was deliberately sent into Hendrix's innercircle by parties unknown. Jeffery reportedly exercised a manipulative hold overHendrix, and, having come to realise his true nature, the musician becamedesperate to escape his binding contract with him. In May 1969, Jefferyreportedly planted heroin on Hendrix, leading to his subsequent arrest inToronto, as an intimidating reminder of the control he could exert. Through hisMob connections, Jeffery is said to have embezzled and laundered large amountsof Hendrix's income. Plus, as Alex Constantine adds:\"Some of Hendrix's friends have concluded that Jeffery stood to make a greatersum of money from a dead Jimi Hendrix than a living one. There was also mentionof a one-million-dollar insurance policy covering Hendrix's life made out withJeffery as the beneficiary . . . Crushing musical voices of dissent was provingto be an immensely profitable enterprise, because a dead rocker leaves behind afortune in publishing rights and royalties.\"Many researchers into the Hendrix enigma have speculated that Jeffery wascommissioned to keep tabs on him, once his profound ability to pen revolutionarylyrics had been noted, and at the point where it became clear he stood to have aprofound effect on the spirituality and consciousness of his fans. Hendrix wasanother highly vocal opponent of the Vietnam War and had voiced his support forthe Black Panther movement, a group that the government and FBI of the day hadmarked out as dangerous subversives that they were determined to put down. Thelyrics to 'Black Gold', one of a series of unreleased demo tracks recorded earlyin 1970, give an insight into the type of lyrical dexterity that a draconiancontrol system might prefer didn't get out into the mainstream. You can checkout the lyrics here –http://www.metrolyrics.com/black-gold-lyrics-jimi-hendrix.html[http://www.metrolyrics.com/black-gold-lyrics-jimi-hendrix.html]According to many, the official account that Hendrix 'asphyxiated' is code forthe truth that he effectively drowned in red wine. The method could even bedescribed as 'waterboarding' in modern parlance. This was confirmed by Dr. JohnBannister, the on-call registrar at St. Mary Abbot's Hospital in Kensington.'The Times' reports Bannister as saying:\"We had a sucker that you put down into his trachea, the entrance to his lungsand to the whole of the back of his throat. We kept sucking him out and it keptsurging and surging. He had already vomited up masses of red wine and I wouldhave thought there was half a bottle of wine in his hair. He had really drownedin a massive amount of red wine.\"Alex Constantine adds:\" . . . Hendrix was, the evidence suggests, forced to drink a quantity of wine.The barbiturates, as (Hendrix biographer) Tony Brown notes, \"seriously inhibitedJimi's normal cough reflex.\" Unable to cough the wine back up, \"it went straightdown into his lungs . . . It is quite possible that he thrashed about for sometime, fighting unsuccessfully to gain his breath.\" It is doubtful that Hendrixwould have continued to swallow the wine in 'massive' volumes had it begun tofill his lungs.\"Michael Jeffery was said to have been behaving oddly in the days followingHendrix's death. He refused to go inside the church in Seattle for Hendrix'seulogy, instead sitting in a limousine outside. He appeared to be consumed byguilt, and at one point, according to recording engineer Alan Douglas, evenconfessed. A further claim came from James 'Tappy' Wright, a roadie for thegroup The Animals, who Jeffery had also managed. Wright stated that he had beenwith Jeffery a year after the Hendrix death, and that he had confessed tomurdering Hendrix by plying him with pills and red wine in order to claim on hislife insurance.It seems karma came calling for Michael Jeffery on 5th March 1973, when theIberia flight that he was aboard was involved in a mid-air collision over Francewith another plane. Unfortunately, the remaining 60 passengers and seven crew onJeffery's flight were also killed. All on the second plane survived. Jeffery hadbeen on his way from his home in Majorca to London for a court case related toHendrix's affairs.As with the Jim Morrison story, Hendrix's girlfriend was present in his room onthe night he died. However, the testimony that Monika Dannemann gavecontradicted the findings of medical personnel on the scene in many respects.Dannemann herself, like Jim Morrison's wife before her, came to an untimely endwhen her body was discovered in April 1996 in a fume-filled car near her home inSussex, England, in what the police dismissed as 'suicide.'Sixteen days after Hendrix's passing, singer Janis Joplin was discovered dead inher Hollywood motel room, the official cause of death given as 'an overdose ofheroin, possibly compounded by alcohol.' She was also 27. Her being a musicalassociate of Hendrix has led to inevitable suspicion that her death may in someway be connected to knowledge she may have had of what had really happened tohim.It suited those involved to see to it that Hendrix's legacy was tarnished withimages of another tragic, self-destructive drug addict. As author John Holmstromconcludes in his book 'Who Killed Jimi?':\"He didn't die from a drug overdose. He was not an out-of-control dope fiend.Jimi Hendrix was not a junkie. And anyone who would use his death as a warningto stay away from drugs should warn people against the other things that killedJimi – the stresses of dealing with the music industry, the craziness of beingon the road, and especially, the dangers of involving oneself in radical, oreven unpopular, political movements . . . Whenever Jimi Hendrix's death isblamed on drugs, it accomplishes the goals of the FBI's program. It not onlyslanders Jimi's personal and professional reputation, but the entire rockrevolution in the 60s.\"JIM MORRISONAs detailed in the earlier chapter on the psychedelic era, Jim Morrison's familybackground is a factor which has been conspicuously missing from officialbiographies over the years, his father having been a high-ranking US navalcommander. In this regard, there are many parallels to the upbringing of RollingStones founder Brian Jones on the other side of the Atlantic, whose own fatherwas a government military intelligence officer. Both Morrison and Jones went onto die in suspicious circumstances at the age of 27, both on 3rd July, two yearsapart. As a matter of curiosity, this date turns out to be the Feast of St.Thomas the Apostle, occurring a day before the Earth is said to be at itsfurthest annual point from the sun.Morrison, (often known as 'The Lizard King' in a piece of imagery that willraise the eyebrows of anyone familiar with the work of David Icke!) was founddead on 3rd July 1971, in a bathtub in the Paris apartment he shared with hiscommon-law wife Pamela Courson. There are no police reports, emergency calllogs, medical examiner logs, reports or records related to his death, and noautopsy was ever performed. The official cause given was 'heart failure.'According to Wikipedia:\"The absence of an official autopsy left many questions regarding Morrison'scause of death. In 'Wonderland Avenue', Danny Sugerman discussed his encounterwith Courson after she returned to the United States. According to Sugerman'saccount, Courson stated that Morrison had died of an accidental heroin overdose,having snorted what he believed to be cocaine. Sugerman added that Courson hadgiven numerous contradictory versions of Morrison's death, saying at times thatshe had killed Morrison, or that his death was her fault. Courson's story ofMorrison's unintentional ingestion of heroin, resulting in an accidentaloverdose, is supported by the confession of Alain Ronay, who has written thatMorrison died of a haemorrhage after snorting Courson's heroin, and that Coursonnodded off instead of phoning for medical help, leaving Morrison alone andbleeding to death.\"Some contradictions arise from the fact that, according to paramedics from thelocal fire brigade, they found Morrison's body with a smile etched on to hisface, something which is entirely inconsistent with the stated manner of death.There are also reports of The Doors' manager, Bill Siddons, arriving at theParis apartment to find the body already in a coffin which had been sealed shut.Courson apparently notified the US Embassy of Jim's death only three days later,and listed him as having no living relatives. (He had plenty.)Morrison was very much the iconic rock star of his era, viewed as a figureheadof rebellion against the establishment status quo, and theoretically viewed as adangerous role-model for a control system that wished to keep the youthfulgeneration within its remit. He was outspoken in his music, his poetry and hisinterviews, and many have argued that it's not difficult to understand howMorrison's popularity would have been seen as a problem, and that this couldhave been a motive for his engineered death. Indeed, Morrison is reported tohave been the target of much harassment and intimidation at the hands of the FBIduring his final years. Some confusion arises with this theory, however, takinginto account the recent revelations about Morrison's connections to militaryintelligence via his father.In 1975, rumours that Morrison had somehow faked his death and had launched anew life as the proprietor of a communications agency, surfaced with the book'The Bank Of America Of Louisiana,' supposedly written by, and credited to, JimMorrison. The book has since been discredited as a hoax by almost allcommentators. As Alex Constantine notes:\"The rumour was a deliberate obfuscation concocted by unknown covert operators.The proper question is 'who killed Jim Morrison?,' not 'is he still alive andworking for the Bank Of America?'\"Given that Pamela Courson was the only other person supposed to have beenpresent when Morrison passed, any chance of establishing further truthdisappeared when she herself died of what was reported to be a 'drugs overdose'on 24th April 1974. As 'The Covert War Against Rock' observes, this was: \"a fewdays before a judge would have ruled in her favour concerning a dispute over thedistribution of the Morrison inheritance, a decision that would have broughther, as Morrison's common-law wife and sole heir, a quarter of The Doors' incomeand an immediate payout of half a million dollars.\" He adds: \"Dr. Max Vasille,the medical examiner, consistently turns down all interviews related toMorrison's death.\"There are some very esoteric aspects to Morrison's character which have to beconsidered, meanwhile, in order to get a full picture of what he was all about.According to the book 'The Lost Writings Of Jim Morrison,' he had married PamelaCourson in a Wiccan ceremony, where they stood inside a pentagram and drankeach-other’s blood. Morrison is quoted as saying: “I met the Spirit of Music, anappearance of the Devil in a Venice canal. Running, I saw a Satan, or Satyr(Pan,) moving beside me, a fleshly shadow of my secret mind . . .”In rock groupie Pamela Des Barres' book 'Rock Bottom,' she quotes Doors bandmateRay Manzarek as saying of Morrison: “He was not a performer. He was not anentertainer. He was not a showman. He was a shaman. He was possessed.” Andlater: \"While he, (Morrison,) was staying at the Chateau Marmont, he spent a fewwild nights with a buxom neighbour . . . , once waking up in a tangle of bloodysheets after they shared champagne glasses of each other’s blood.”JOHN LENNONThe official version of events has it that John Lennon was shot dead by MarkDavid Chapman, who has been presented by the media as a deranged fan, very muchfitting the profile of the classic 'lone nutter.' (See Lee Harvey Oswald, SirhanSirhan, Adam Lanza, James Holmes, etc, etc.) Lennon was returning to his home atthe Dakota Building in Manhattan, (the setting for Roman Polanski's dark gothichorror 'Rosemary's Baby,') with Yoko Ono on the evening of 8th December 1980.Earlier in the day, Chapman had approached Lennon and got him to sign a copy ofhis new album 'Double Fantasy'. At 10.50pm, Chapman is said to have assumed atrained marksman's position and fired at Lennon's back five times, hitting himwith four bullets. He is then said to have calmly waited until police arrived,who found him reading a copy of JD Salinger's 'Catcher In The Rye.' Chapman hasbeen in jail for the crime ever since, and despite consistent appeals for paroleover the years, these are always overturned, making it very unlikely that hewill ever be released.There has been much speculation to the effect that Chapman was a classicManchurian Candidate-style mind-controlled assassin, his behaviour showing allthe signs that would be expected. Chapman has consistently stated that he can'tremember anything about that fateful night, which certainly fits the model. Theconsensus of a great many researchers is that it was not Chapman that killedLennon, however, but that he had served as a diversion, and therefore a 'patsy'to take the rap for the murder, while the real perpetrator disappeared into theshadows.That real shooter has been named on several occasions as Jose Sanjenis Perdomo,a long-standing CIA operative and trained assassin, who was posing that night asa doorman at the Dakota Building. Even the highly-controlled Wikipedia confirmsthis, describing him as a 'witness' to Lennon's murder. Perhaps checking up onthe effectiveness of his programming, Perdomo famously asked Chapman if he knewwhat he had done, to which Chapman replied that he had just shot John Lennon.Perdomo has been named as a key member of an elite and very secret squad ofassassins codenamed Operation 40, whose personnel have been linked to anextraordinary array of high-profile assassinations, among them John and RobertKennedy, Martin Luther King, Bob Marley and Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme.The official story of Operation 40 tries to convince that it was a secretoperation limited to the early 1960s for the purpose of overthrowing the FidelCastro's Cuban regime, but the evidence suggests that it has extended way beyondthat timeframe. George HW Bush is a name that crops up time and time again withrelation to Operation 40 and the many assassinations it is said to have beenresponsible for. Bush has been proven to have been present in Dallas on the dayof the JFK assassination. When asked in an interview decades later where he wason that fateful day, he stated he 'couldn't remember.'The most common motive given for Lennon's murder was that it was sanctioned bythe Nixon Administration, which had tried without success to have Lennondeported from the US on several occasions. Lennon had been a highly vocal criticof the government's stance on the Vietnam War. The timing is said to have pavedthe way for Ronald Reagan, who had been voted in as the 40th US President just amonth before. Lennon was equally unpopular with J Edgar Hoover's FBI, and hadfallen victim to its COINTELPRO programme of surveillance. Some conspiracyresearchers have even suggested that Lennon was about to blow the whistle on thedeception surrounding the replacement of Paul McCartney back in 1966, (see thisbook's 15,000-word chapter on that subject!,) confessing to George Harrison thathe could no longer live with the lie, and so had to be quickly removed to keepthe secret safe. It's also fair to assume that Lennon hadn't exactly ingratiatedhimself to the British Establishment when, in 1969, he returned the MBE awardedto him by the Queen four years earlier, in an apparent statement against Empireand the Vietnam War.The waters get muddied still further, however, when you hear claims from somequarters that, not only was the original Paul McCartney replaced in 1966, butall four Beatles were at some point replaced! According to this theory, itwasn't the real John Lennon who died in 1980, but an impostor. We then have theclaims of the American researcher Miles Mathis that in fact, Lennon somehowfaked his death, Elvis Presley-style, and has been living all these years underthe assumed identity of Mark Staycer, and still performing as a musician.Mathis' comprehensive essay on the subject can be found here –http://mileswmathis.com/lennon.pdf [http://mileswmathis.com/lennon.pdf]If Mathis is correct, it presents the infuriatingly perplexing case that PaulMcCartney died but is pretending to be alive, whereas John Lennon lived but ispretending to be dead!Whether there's any truth to the Lennon replacement theory or not, it's alwaysstruck me as an enigma how a man known for his mischievous sense of humour andprone to the regular Rock & Roll vices during the Beatles years, could havetransformed into the profound spiritual poet he had become by the followingdecade. Lennon's output between 1970 and 1980 stands among the most captivating,esoteric and truthful of any mainstream musician's material, with songs such as'Instant Karma,' 'Gimme Some Truth,' 'I Don't Want To Be A Soldier,' 'Woman IsThe Nigger Of The World,' 'God,' 'Love,' 'Working Class Hero,' 'Mind Games,''Watching The Wheels' and 'Borrowed Time' resonating with so many as theconscious awakening of humanity starts to affect more and more people. Lennonwas writing songs 40-plus years ago whose lyrics are even more relevant today.It's possible that this period served as a kind of personal redemption for him,perhaps motivated by a sense of guilt over the excesses and deceptions of theBeatle years, and wanting to make amends. It's equally possible that these songssimply marked a coming-of-age, a maturing as he progressed into his thirties.Some have suggested that the influence of Yoko Ono brought about a kind ofspiritual awakening. Others, of course, will tell you that the reason thesesongs are so potent are because it's someone other than the real John WinstonLennon churning them out!Either way, he certainly appeared to have got a handle on the reality of theworld when he made what's become one of his most famous quotes:“Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives. I think we're beingrun by maniacs for maniacal ends, and I think I'm liable to be put away asinsane for expressing that. That's what's insane about it.”Theories abound about the true nature of Yoko Ono, too, and how it was that shecame to be so influential in Lennon's life. The suggestion that she wasresponsible for breaking up the Beatles through luring John away from hisbandmates is a well-known one. Less familiar are aspects of her background. Hergreat-grandfather, Zenjiro Yasuda, was the founder of the Yasuda bankingconglomerate, with her father having been a descendant of the Emperor of Japan.Yoko was reportedly enrolled at Tokyo's Gakushuin, one of the most exclusiveschools in the country which, before World War II, was open only to the Japaneseimperial family and aristocrats of the House of Peers. She spent a brief spellin a mental institution in Japan, just prior to her marriage to the Americanjazz musician and film producer Anthony Cox.Claims have also persisted that she was a practitioner in the dark occult,probably helped by the title of her 1974 song 'Yes I'm A Witch.' There have alsobeen theories that Lennon, like so many other prominent musicians, was under adegree of MK-Ultra mind control, and that Yoko was sent into his life as hisapproved handler, to ensure he remained 'on-script' and to report any issuesback to her superiors. This may have some connection to John's 'lost weekend'episode in 1973/4 where, with Yoko's apparent blessing, he embarked on a sexualrelationship with their personal assistant May Pang, living with her in New Yorkand LA before eventually returning to his marital home. The singer Harry Nilssonis on-record as having been present during much of Lennon's Lost Weekend period.Associations with Nilsson would appear to be bad luck for other musicians, giventhat both Mama Cass of the Mamas & The Papas and Keith Moon of The Who werediscovered dead in the same room of his flat in London's Mayfair in 1974 and1978 respectively, during his absence. A reportedly devastated Nilssonsubsequently sold the flat to Pete Townshend of The Who. Nilsson himself died ofheart failure in January 1994, aged 52.Backmasking crops up again in this particular story, with claims that theYoko-voiced 'Kiss Kiss Kiss' from their collaborative album 'Double Fantasy,'has lyrics which emerge as \"Satan is coming . . . six six six,\" and later, \"Weshot John Lennon\" when played in reverse.Numerology, too, seems to have played a big part in the life and death of JohnLennon. He was said to have been obsessed with the number 9, inspiring his songs'Number 9 Dream,' 'Revolution 9' and 'One After 909.' (9 incidentally, wasalways an important number in the occult work of Aleister Crowley, as well asfiguring majorly in the dark magick ritual that was 9/11.) Lennon was born on9th October 1940, and died forty years and two months later on 9th December1980, (still 8th December in New York, but already into the early hours of the9th in his British homeland.) Lennon and Yoko's son Sean was born on 9th October1975, Lennon's 35th birthday. John's first home was at 9 Newcastle Road inLiverpool.BOB MARLEYSome tenacious delving into Bob Marley's back-story throws up the usual odditiespresent when it comes to music legends. His father, Norval Sinclair Marley, waspart-Jewish, served in the British Royal Marines, and was employed as theoverseer of a plantation in Jamaica. Yet more establishment/ military links.Bob's musical stance, like Jim Morrison's, could well have represented rebellionagainst what his father stood for. But equally, maybe his father's status madeBob rife for manipulation, the way Morrison seemingly was? The Jewish link wasalluded to when Ziggy Marley, (real name David,) Bob's third child, married anIsraeli woman and gave Hebrew names to each of his three children. He courtedcontroversy when he refused to support a boycott against Israel in the wake ofits incursions into Palestine, and proceeded to play a series of dates inIsrael, despite being petitioned not to. This could be considered an odd stancefor the son of an artist whose entire persona was steeped in rebellion againstworldwide oppression, of the type enforced by the Zionist regime. Justifyinghimself, Ziggy commented: “Rastafarianism has a lot to do with the Old Testamentand Solomon and David and Moses, so we have a strong connection from many yearsback.”Bob Marley is another artist whose activism and ethics saw him fall foul of theCIA. It seems artists with an international fan base of millions whose musicpreaches love, unity and opposition to tyranny, don't chime too well with thespooks in Langley, Virginia. If the agency had had its way, Marley would havedied sooner than he did. This was the planned result of the violent gun attackupon his home on 3rd December 1976 in which he, his wife and his manager wereall wounded. It occurred two days before Marley's scheduled appearance at SmileJamaica, a free concert designed to ease tension between the two opposingpolitical groups, and organised by Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley. TheCIA were present in Jamaica at the time, and had reportedly been working todestabilise the country's political system ready for a takeover. Messages ofunity weren't really on their agenda.Despite the attack, the concert went ahead, as did Marley's scheduledappearance, elevating him to heroic status. When asked why he had stillperformed, Marley responded: \"The people who are trying to make this world worsearen't taking a day off. How can I?\"Marley and his entourage kept an understandably low profile after this event,installed at their compound with heavy security, and would have been cautious ofall around them. Marley was presumably flattered, however, when he wasapproached to be the subject of a documentary. One of the film-makers reportedlyvisited the compound, walking past machete-wielding rastas with a present forMarley – a pair of boots. Some accounts of the story say that they were footballboots, others that they were cowboy boots. Either way, according to witnesses,when Marley pulled one on he yelped in pain, and upon examination, one of theboots was found to have a sharp protruding copper wire which had piercedMarley's big toe. The wire would appear to have been laced with some kind ofcancer-causing agent. A few months later, in Summer 1977, Marley just happenedto break his toe while playing soccer. When the bone wouldn't mend, doctorsfound that the toe had cancer, which went on to spread throughout his body.The identity of the gift-bearer is very interesting. According to reports heturns out to have been Carl Colby, who just happened to be the son of the formerCIA director William Colby. In 2011, Carl Colby produced, directed and narrateda Hollywood movie, 'The Man Nobody Knew,' documenting his father's life andcareer in the 'intelligence' services. William Colby died in very mysteriouscircumstances in April 1996. He was found drowned in the Potomac River aftertaking his canoe out near his home in Rock Point, Maryland, in what the statecoroner inferred was a 'tragic accident' owing to a heart attack or stroke.Inevitably, there has been speculation of foul play, particularly since duringColby's time leading the CIA, he had revealed the existence of documentsdescribing illegal activities by the agency, (surely not?!), and had shown awillingness to be more transparent than previous directors. Steven Greer ofwww.disclosureproject.org [http://www.disclosureproject.org] also revealed toArt Bell on Coast to Coast AM Radio in a 2004 interview, that Colby was about toreveal the existence of extraterrestrial energy devices that were beingsuppressed.Colby had reportedly left his house unlocked, his coffee-maker brewing and hiscomputer switched-on when he suddenly felt the need to go out on a spontaneousboating trip. Greer also pointed out that the circumstances surrounding Colby'sdeath mirror those of a Senator who was about to become a whistleblower in themovie 'The Manchurian Candidate.' The character is murdered while out kayakingin Chesapeake Bay and it's made to look like an accident. Life imitating artonce again? Colby was replaced as CIA Director in 1976 by one George HW Bush.Heard of him before anywhere? Carl Colby, meanwhile, cropped up many years laterin the trial of OJ Simpson, (the two had been neighbours,) testifying againsthim. A poster on the Godlike Productions website on the subject commented wrylythat Colby 'seems to be bad luck for black people.'Marley lived for another four years, eventually succumbing on 11th May 1981. Theability of cannabis to cure cancer has been well-documented in recent times,(but was less well-known in the 1970s,) causing some to speculate that Marley'sdaily smoking habit may have prolonged his life way beyond what would otherwisehave been the case.The plan was presumably that he would die much sooner. This certainly seemed tobe in the intentions of a German doctor, Joseph Issels, recommended to Marley bythe Jamaican doctor Carl 'Pee Wee' Fraser. Issels practiced what he referred toas 'holistic immunotherapy' in Bavaria, Germany, and Marley travelled to hisclinic for treatment. Unfortunately, according to accounts, Issels was a veteranNazi and had worked alongside the notorious Josef Mengele at the Auschwitzconcentration camp during World War 2. As author Alex Constantine observes: \"BobMarley, the 'dangerous' racial enemy of fascists everywhere, had placed his lifein the hands of a Nazi doctor.' Issels' 'treatment' included the administeringof vaccines delivered by long needles plunged into Marley's stomach until theywent through to his spine. Issels also starved him. On the day of his death,Marley's emaciated body is said to have weighed only 82 pounds.Marley's death was followed in 1987 – on September 11th, intriguingly – by thatof Peter Tosh, fellow bandmate in the group The Wailers, and political activistin Jamaica. Tosh and Marley had converted to Rastafarianism together in the late1960s, and both had become thorns in the side of the political establishmentwith their outspoken comments and attempts towards civil unity. Tosh wasmurdered when a trio of thugs led by Dennis 'Leppo' Lobban, walked in on a partyhe was throwing for a small group of friends at his Westmoreland home. The gangdetained Tosh and his guests for several hours and demanded money from him. Toshrepeatedly told them he had none. Lobban eventually shot him in the head. Agunfight ensued in which DJs Doc Brown and Jeff 'Free I' Dixon were also killed.Lobban was jailed for life, but many of Tosh's associates suspected he was yetanother convenient 'patsy,' with Wayne Johnson, producer of 'The Red X Tapes'documentary film, citing an un-named government official who had told him thatone of the gunmen was a police officer. Whether or not there was foul playbeyond a simple robbery gone wrong, reggae music had lost another of its mostprominent and celebrated musicians, and the control system was rid of one moreinfluential freedom activist. It didn't end there, either. Several otherJamaican musicians known also as political activists have been murdered in onefashion or another in the intervening years, among them Major Worries, TenorSaw, Nitty Gritty, Pan Head, Dirtsman and Garnett Silk.MICHAEL JACKSONOn any level, there can be few life stories as captivating, and ultimatelytragic, as that of Michael Jackson. The old cliché 'you couldn't make it up' hasnever been more apt. It seems clear that Jackson and his siblings were forcedinto a life of show-business at an early age by their bullying and abusivefather, Joe. In one of her interviews on the subject of MK-Ultra in theentertainment business, Roseanne Barr brought up the subject, claiming JoeJackson to be an asset of the CIA. In her 'Roseanne World' blog she wrote:\"Joe Jackson is a child abuser, and catherine (sic) looked the other way whilehe beat their kids and tortured Michael mentally. Keep them both away fromMichael’s kids.\"There has been widespread speculation about Michael having been a mind-controlvictim since his early childhood, and this appeared to be borne out when aseries of his drawings were seen for the first time in public when they were putup for sale by a private collector in 2014. Many of them offer disturbing hintsat Monarch Programming. Included are the image of a smiling face with wirescoming from the head connected to what appear to be electrical switches, aself-portrait under the word 'seven,' in which the bottom half of the faceappears deformed as if in the midst of an electric shock, and a compositeself-portrait depicting a male, female and child all merged into one.Although Michael towed the line expected of him for many years, performing danceroutines on cue and releasing albums with regularity, by the late 1980s thecracks were starting to show. His various eccentric behaviours arewell-documented and need no repeating here. It would appear that he started togo off-script when the lyrical content of his music changed from the relativeinnocence of his early tunes, to containing conscious messages, from theconspiratorial 'They Don't Really Care About Us,' to the paranoid 'Leave MeAlone,' to the environmentally-conscious 'Earth Song.' His public statementsappeared to deviate, too, when he criticised the Sony music empire and thedraconian hold it had over its artists in terms of their publishing deals, whenhe branded Sony CEO Tommy Mottola 'the Devil,' and when he stated that thehistory books had been re-written to present the version of events that suitedthe worldwide Establishment, (the origin of his 'HIStory' project.) There havebeen suggestions that these comments stand as an indication of Jackson'smind-control programming starting to wear off. Either way, it's easy tounderstand how such behaviours would have made enemies in certain quarters. Manysaw the two allegations of child-abuse levelled at Jackson as warnings to him toget back on-track, and as a reminder of what those that control him can do tothose who don't play ball. Once again, the spectre of child-abuse hangsominously above this particular story, as it has over so many others throughoutthe years. Evan Chandler, the screenwriter and dentist who brought the first ofthe molestation charges against Jackson, 'committed suicide' five months afterJackson's own death.Jackson's death, on 25th June 2009, is no less strange and full of unansweredquestions than his life ever was. With the blame placed solely on Dr. ConradMurray for reportedly administering a cocktail of prescription drugs andpainkillers that proved fateful, the spotlight has fallen away from any otherparties. Murray has become this story's version of the 'lone nutter' blamed forso many false-flag terror hoaxes. The dictionary.com [http://dictionary.com]definition of 'a conspiracy' is given as 'an evil, unlawful, treacherous, orsurreptitious plan formulated in secret by two or more persons,',(with the worditself coming from the Latin, meaning 'to breathe together.') By restricting theblame for Jackson's death to Murray alone, the official version of the storyeliminates any suggestion of a 'conspiracy' and, as with the case of PrincessDiana, can be chalked up as yet another 'tragic accident.' (Michael was a closepersonal friend of Diana, incidentally – but with his social circle alsoincluding spoon-bender and admitted Mossad and CIA agent Uri Geller, he could beconsidered to have had poor judgement in this area. He also recorded twice with'Paul McCartney,' of course, before going on to purchase the Beatles backcatalogue, and married Elvis Presley's daughter Lisa Marie.)In 2012, a heavily-circulated video appeared of a bald white man sitting at adesk, who claimed his name was Robert Conners, and that he had been ahigh-ranking officer in the US Department of Defense. During his time with thedepartment, 'Connors' claimed to have worked on a project known as OperationSedgwick, which he says was a continuation of the CIA's MK-Ultra that wasspecifically aimed at subverting the African-American population through thestrategic use of music. He stated that after much internal struggling, hisconscience would not allow him to continue in his work, and that he had decidedto become a whistleblower. In the video, he gives an ultimatum to his formeremployers to publicly admit the existence of this project, or he would releaseincriminating material to back up his claims. \"To show I'm not bluffing,\" hesaid, the first item was a recording of a tapped telephone conversation between'Michael Jackson' and a friend named Dieter Weisner. The video included whatpurported to be the audio of this conversation, featuring a voice that soundedsimilar to Jackson's, appearing fearful and paranoid and voicing concerns thathis life was in danger.Despite his claim that he would produce new material each subsequent week,nothing further was heard from this 'whistleblower.' While the view could betaken that something may indeed have happened to him, it seems far more likelythat this video was a hoax and that the 'Michael Jackson' phone call was faked,either as someone's warped idea of a joke, or as a deliberate attempt to confuseand confound genuine truth researchers, and ridicule the idea of MJ 'conspiracytheories' in the minds of the masses.In 2013 it was reported that Paris Jackson, Michael's 'daughter,' was not infact his biological offspring. On 5th June of that year, she was admitted tohospital after attempting suicide by cutting her wrists and taking an overdoseof pills.Still think the star-spangled world of celebrity is all glitz and glamour?!There have been rumours among those who would always advise you to 'follow themoney,' that at the time of Jackson's death he was about to end hislong-standing publishing deal with Sony, which would have seen him taking backthe sole rights to not only his own back catalogue, but also that of theBeatles, in an arrangement worth potentially billions. This claim remainsunsubstantiated, however.The very best death conspiracies continue beyond the grave, and so it is withMJ. Just as with Elvis, (his one-time father-in-law,) Jim Morrison and Tupac,some have claimed that, with massive complicity from others, Jackson faked hisown death to evade the glare of celebrity life, and possibly to escape hismassive financial debts. One such clue is said to be Jackson's comment at thepress conference where he announced his gruelling series of live dates atLondon's Wembley Arena under the 'This Is It' brand, where he states: 'This isthe final curtain call.' This was his last public appearance before theannouncement of his death.On the day of Michael's funeral, a character known as 'Dave Dave' guested on'Larry King Live' on CNN. The back-story given was that his real name was DavidRothenberg, and that his father had doused him with kerosene and set him alightwhen he was six years old in 1983, resulting in 90-degree burns. 'Dave' statedthat Michael Jackson befriended him while he was undergoing surgery, and hadremained a loyal friend ever since. 'Dave' certainly gave the appearance ofbeing a serious burns victim . . . or the subject of some very elaborate plasticsurgery. He told King that he had changed his name 'to liberate myself from myfather's criminality.' Was this story genuine? Or, (despite pictures being shownof Jackson with what is said to be a childhood Rothenberg,) could 'Dave Dave'have possibly been a heavily-altered and 'reborn' Michael Jackson, with CNNcomplicit in one of the entertainment industry's favourite tactics – telling youwhat's really going on right there in plain sight?WHITNEY HOUSTONIn the days following Whitney Houston's death, R&B DJs everywhere rushed to puttogether their own personal 'tribute mixes' to mark the occasion. In absorbing afew of these, something struck me. With only a handful of exceptions, the songsthroughout Whitney's career were all about love; love of the romantic kind inmost cases, but also love of the 'agape' kind in the spiritual tradition, oflove for all humanity as exemplified on 'Love Will Save The Day' and 'TheGreatest Love Of All'. It certainly seems symbolic that an artist whose musicwas, on the whole, inspirational and uplifting, was possibly chosen as one to betaken out by a dark priest-class that stands for the very antithesis of thesequalities. The timing of her death certainly served her record label well,coming as it did three days before Valentine's Day. The resultant outpour ofgrief led to massively increased sales of her back catalogue, for which retailprices had been specially marked-up.Those looking for dark symbolic clues can have a field-day with this one, aseverything about it comes with a deeply unsettling tone. Whitney's deathoccurred at the time of the 2012 Grammy Awards, just a few days after the USSuper Bowl half-time show, an event which was itself loaded with occulticimagery for those with the eyes to see it. As a 'Vigilant Citizen' articlecommented at the time:\"When we look at the facts and the occurrences surrounding Whitney Houston’sdeath, coupled with the symbolic elements of the 2012 Grammy awards, the entire'event' has the looks of an occult ritual, complete with a blood sacrifice, acelebration and even a 're-birth.'\"As in the cases of Michael Jackson, Amy Winehouse, Heath Ledger, BrittanyMurphy and many others, bizarre events preceded and followed the death ofWhitney Houston. After reviewing all of those accounts, one cannot help butwonder: Was Whitney’s death truly an accident, or was it a deliberate sacrificeplanned by 'unseen forces”?\"Whitney's lifeless body was discovered in a bathtub in Suite 434 of LA's BeverlyHilton Hotel in the afternoon of 11th February 2012. She was pronounced dead at3.55pm. The official coroner's report stated that she had 'accidentally' drownedin the bathtub, with heart disease and cocaine listed as contributing factors.Yet another strange music industry death chalked up as a self-inflicted,drug-induced 'accident.' In this case, the implication was that Whitney'sdownward spiral from wholesome church girl to self-destructive substance-abuser,was the result of her turbulent relationship with her 'bad boy' husband BobbyBrown. There are reports that Whitney's body was cold when it was pulled fromthe warm water of the bathtub, indicating that she had already been dead forseveral hours, despite the time of her death being officially given as earlierthat afternoon.An industry pre-Grammys party had been scheduled to take place just four floorsbelow, hosted by music industry veteran Clive Davis. Like so many executives,Davis comes from a Jewish family. He was the founder of Arista Records and iscredited with having launched Houston's career. Despite the news of Whitney'sdeath being publicly announced, and her body still lying a few floors above, theparty went on regardless and is said to have had a celebratory air about it,whereas you might think that the appropriate response to such terrible newswould have been to cancel the party, or at least move it to another location. Ina speech to the crowd, Davis claimed that Whitney's family had said that theywished for the party to continue. Despite having been discovered in the lateafternoon, the coroner had reportedly received orders from above that her bodywas not to be removed until shortly before the party ended at around midnight.Whitney and Bobby Brown's daughter, Bobbi Kristina, was among a group of peoplesaid to have been present in the suite throughout, and was reported to have beenin a hysterical state.An item seldom reported in the mainstream media, is that Bobbi Kristina herselfwas discovered unconscious in a bathtub only a day before her mother's death, inthe same group of rooms at the Beverly Hilton, in an event that eerilyforeshadowed what was to come. At around 2.50am that night, a man stayingdirectly below the Houston entourage's suite, called reception to complain aboutwater cascading through his ceiling from above. When he went upstairs withsecurity to investigate, they reportedly found a bathtub overflowing, andnoticed that a large-screen TV had been smashed. This incident presents thestrong suggestion that Whitney may have died sometime during that night, ratherthan the following afternoon, which would make sense of why her body wasreportedly cold when it was pulled out of the bathtub.The whole affair appeared to get symbolically re-enacted on 31st January 2015,when Bobbi Kristina was again discovered face-down and unconscious in a bathtub,on this occasion by her 'husband' Nick Gordon at her Georgia home. This time,there was no official claim of drug or alcohol abuse, and no tangible reasongiven for her condition. She was placed in a medically-induced coma after shewas described as having undergone irreversible brain damage. The date of thisannouncement piqued the interest of Isaac Weishaupt, proprietor of theIlluminatiwatcher.com [http://Illuminatiwatcher.com] website, as he observedthat the start of February was a time of ritual sacrifice known to Pagansocieties as Imbolg. Weishaupt points out that actor Philip Seymour Hoffman wasalso found dead in strange circumstances at the beginning of February the yearbefore, (in a bathroom, though not reportedly in a bathtub.) Gordon's status asBobbi Kristina's apparent husband was later called into question when thesubject of inheritance arose. It later emerged that Bobbi Kristina had beenfound with bruising, and that Gordon had been investigated as a suspect.A few days after her 'discovery,' it was announced that Bobbi Kristina's familyhad decided to turn off her life-support machine on 11th February, the date onwhich her mother had died three years before, 'so they could be together.' Thesuggestion had apparently been made by veteran Gospel singer Cissy Houston,Whitney's mother. This did not happen, however, and Bobbi Kristina eventuallypassed away on 26th July after six months in a coma. By this time, the officialcause of death seemed to have been revised, as reported by the mainstream media,to a 'drowning.' Death-by-bathtub seems to be a common component in the musicindustry. Whitney, Bobbi Kristina and Jim Morrison were all discovered in them.The fact that Bobbi Kristina was in a bathtub at all was considered strange byher friend Debra Reis Brooks, who told the site RadarOnline.com[http://RadarOnline.com] that she had been terrified of baths ever since hermother's discovery in one, and never ever took one. The Illuminatiwatcher.com[http://Illuminatiwatcher.com] site goes further regarding the possible mysticalrelevance of celebrities in bathtubs, meanwhile, suggesting this may represent asymbolic ushering-in of the astrological Age of Aquarius, and highlighting thedumbfounding amount of music stars and actors that have been pictured in them inrecent times, not always bathing in water. Lady Gaga seems to be particularlyfond of them. You can read a totally fascinating article on the subject here: * http://illuminatiwatcher.com/decoding-illuminati-symbolism-water-and-the-occult-bathtub/ [http://illuminatiwatcher.com/decoding-illuminati-symbolism-water-and-the-occult-bathtub/]Bobby Brown could be considered to be one of the unluckiest men in showbusiness. Notwithstanding the tragic deaths of his wife and daughter, his nephewShayne, alongside two of his entourage, were stabbed when a fight broke out at aparty celebrating his father's birthday in 2005. The man indicted for theattacks, Marque Dixson, was shot dead in a parking lot the following year in acase that remained 'unsolved.'Fellow singer Chaka Khan was particularly outspoken about the tasteless aspectssurrounding her friend Whitney's death, (a young Whitney had been one of thebacking singers on Chaka's 'I'm Every Woman' in 1978 before going on to coverthe song herself in 1992.) Speaking on a CNN interview with a clueless andby-the-book Piers Morgan about the continuation of the Clive Davis party, shecommented:\"I thought that was complete insanity. And knowing Whitney I don't believe thatshe would have said 'the show must go on.' She's the kind of woman that would'vesaid 'stop everything! Un-unh. I'm not going to be there.' . . . I don't knowwhat could motivate a person to have a party in a building where the personwhose life he had influenced so enormously and whose life had been affected byhers. They were like . . . I don't understand how that party went on.\"She added:\"A more honest tribute, in my opinion, would have been, maybe, call everybodytogether, say a prayer, let's eat dinner and go home.\"Chaka may or may not have been speaking literally when she commented in the sameinterview:“I think we all, as artists, because we’re highly sensitive people and thismachine around us, this so-called ‘music industry,’ is such a demonic thing. Itsacrifices people’s lives and their essences at the drop of a dime . . . I had amanager once say to me, 'you know you’re worth more money dead than alive’.”Meanwhile, there's more Clive Davis-related strangeness from the fact that, twodays before her death, Whitney visited fellow Arista singers Brandy and Monica,who were with Davis at their rehearsals for the pre-Grammys party. Whitney wasseen to slip a note to Brandy, the contents of which Brandy has refused toreveal, and appeared to be saying her goodbyes to the three, leading tospeculation that she may have been aware of her imminent demise. She beckonedBobbi Kristina to 'come and say hi to your Godfather' in reference to Davis.Whitney's last public appearance was on-stage alongside Kelly Price, singing'Jesus Loves Me,' which was a far cry from the tone of the rest of that year'sGrammy event, including as it did Nicki Minaj's stage show depicting demonicpossession and the 'exorcism' of her character Roman Zolanski!The day after her death, it was announced that former 'American Idol' finalistJennifer Hudson would be performing the official Grammys tribute to Whitney. Twodays earlier, Clive Davis had told Piers Morgan that Jennifer Hudson was “thenext Whitney.\" Hudson herself had undergone her own personal tragedy in 2008when her mother, brother and seven-year-old nephew were shot to death inChicago. The estranged husband of Hudson's sister Julia was charged with themurders, and sentenced to several life imprisonment terms. Inevitably, therehave been claims that these deaths constituted some form of ritual sacrifice inexchange for the fame and fortune that Hudson would go on to receive – though ithas to be said her career has not been as prolific in recent years as many in2009 expected it would be.Clive Davis now has a theatre named after him in Los Angeles. It seems hislifetime of service to the industry has not gone unrewarded.Also entering the Whitney Houston story, is an enigmatic character who appearsto go by the name of Raffles Van Exel, though he has been known to use severalother pseudonyms including Raffles Dawson and Raffles Benson. According to anarticle written by 'Forbes' contributor Roger Friedman:\"He was on the fourth floor of the Beverly Hilton Hotel in one of Houston’ssuites when she died. He appeared downstairs in the lobby shortly thereafter,wearing aviator sunglasses, sobbing.\" . . . Despite the shock of Whitney’s death, Raffles still made it downstairsto Clive Davis’s party. He was dressed in formal wear, had Whitney’s tickets inhis hand, and intended to sit at her table. Just inside the ballroom, he wascomforted by celebrities to whom he related his story – “I found Whitney.” GayleKing hugged him. Quincy Jones listened patiently to his story. A security guardtold me later, 'Well, he was up there.' He was also hanging around with Houstonall week prior to her death. On Tuesday, when she emerged from a nightclublooking dishevelled, Raffles appears in a photograph on TMZ like a deer inheadlights. He is standing right behind her in a powder blue suit.\"But who is Raffles Van Exel? He’s one of Hollywood’s mysteries. I first met himin 2005 hanging around the Jackson family during Michael Jackson’s childmolestation trial. After Michael went abroad, Raffles was often seen withMichael’s father, Joseph Jackson. He trades on being an 'insider' when there’s ascandal. No-one really knows him, but he’s always where there’s action andcelebrities . . . On Twitter he claims to be managing “'my girl,' Chaka Khan.\" . . . Look for Raffles at Whitney’s funeral tomorrow. In the old days he usedto wear a yellow jacket full of black question marks, like The Riddler. OnSaturday night, as he pulled in various guests to Clive Davis’s party past thevelvet ropes, he was wearing a Michael Jackson-like tuxedo. He lives in WestHollywood now, but his official domicile – and where he’s been sued – isChicago. He has not responded to countless e-mails and phone messages.\"Finally, anyone armed with an understanding of how Kabbalistic numerologyfigures so heavily in the plans of the entertainment industry's dark occultists,will find it intriguing that the number 11 crops up many times in thecircumstances surrounding this story. 11 is known as a master number, andrepresents the completion of one cycle and the birth of a new one. It is anextremely significant figure in the works of Aleister Crowley, and anothercrucial component in the details of 9/11.Whitney died on the 11th of the month, two years to the day after Britishfashion designer Alexander McQueen was found hanged at his London home, in adeath which Metropolitan police described as 'not suspicious.' McQueen was saidhimself to have been a practitioner of the dark arts, (For the dark occultelements in his designs see:http://justifytheory.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/occult-fashion-alexander-mcqueen.html[http://justifytheory.blogspot.co.uk/2011/05/occult-fashion-alexander-mcqueen.html])and was reportedly related to three of the Salem witches, as well as justhappening to have been awarded a CBE by the Queen.The suite in which Whitney died was number 434, with 4 + 4 + 3 equalling 11.MICHAEL HUTCHENCEThe story of the premature demise of the Australian frontman of the group INXSis yet another tangled web of strangeness and unanswered questions. Hutchencewas discovered dead on the same date as the JFK murder, 22nd November, (22/11 –22 + 11 = 33,) in 1997. He was found in his hotel room at the Ritz Carlton inSydney, (Room 524 which also corresponds to 11 in numerology – 5 + 2 + 4,) andwas said to have 'committed suicide,' with the ever-present elements of drugsand alcohol added to the picture. Hutchence was said to have been depressed,largely as a result of an ongoing dispute with Bob Geldof, the former husband ofBritish TV presenter Paula Yates, with whom Hutchence was now involved. Therewas no inquest, and the coroner's report implied that Hutchence had taken hisown life by hanging himself with a belt from a doorframe. Rumours quicklyemerged that Hutchence had died as the result of a sex act gone wrong, and thathe was into auto-asphyxiation – a sexual thrill achieved by bringing oneselfalmost to the point of death by strangling, but letting go at the last moment.These claims were rejected by the coroner.Suspicion that all might not be as it seemed, came from further details in thereport which most mainstream media outlets chose to leave out of their coverage;Hutchence's body bore the signs of a beating, and he had a bleeding lip and abroken hand, which would have made hanging himself quite an achievement.Suddenly suicide begins to look less likely. On the evening prior to his death,Hutchence had been dining out with his father and stepmother, who said that hehad seemed in good spirits. Furthermore, Paula Yates later commented thatHutchence thought suicide was the most cowardly act in the world and that hewould never do it. As with the Amy Winehouse story, Hutchence was heard to bearguing loudly with somebody in his room during the early hours, according tothe occupant of the adjoining room.Much of the speculation of foul play came from comments given by Hutchence'sfather, Kelland, who told Australian TV that Geldof had been intimidatingHutchence and Yates in his attempts to gain custody of Tiger Lily, the daughterthey had together. Geldof began his actions after opium was found in Hutchence'sproperty while he was out of the country, in what many believe was a set-up.Kelland stated: \"He made their lives miserable. It's like he was on avendetta . . . I think it contributed very much to what happened.\" Kellandremarked that his son had had an argument over the phone with Geldof just hoursbefore he died.Yates herself went further, in an apparent outburst at an airport lounge inBangkok. The UK's 'Daily Express' quoted her as saying: \"Bob Geldof murderedMichael Hutchence. That bastard killed Michael. He is called 'Saint' Bob. Thatmakes me sick. He killed my baby. We have had three years of this.\" She alsoclaimed that Geldof had frequently threatened Hutchence and herself by saying\"don't forget, I am above the law,\" a comment similar in nature to what JimmySavile used to say when challenged. Yates later stated that she refused toaccept the coroner's verdict on Hutchence's 'suicide,' telling Australia'sChannel 9 TV: \"I will be making it abundantly clear that, because of informationthat I and only I could know about Michael . . . I cannot accept the verdict.And I won't have my child grow up thinking that her father left her, not knowingthe way he loved her . . . I just don't think he killed himself, I reallydon't.\"Like earlier rock stars who met untimely ends, Hutchence was known for hispolitical activism, and his Will named Amnesty International and Greenpeace asmajor benefactors of his assets.Paula Yates was another product of generational show business connections. Itemerged late in her life that her biological father was the veteran televisionpresenter Hughie Green, rather than the previously-assumed Jess Yates, thepresenter of religious TV programmes. She has long been suspected by researchersinto mind-control of being a subject of Monarch and/ or Beta programming, herpermanently-dyed peroxide hair fitting the stereotype perfectly.Paula Yates was herself found dead on 17th September 2000, aged 41, the officialline being that it was the result of a heroin overdose. The very next day, BobGeldof filed for custody of Tiger Lily, even though he is not related to her inany way. Hutchence's family objected to this, but say they were not givenGeldof's permission to join the custody proceedings. They also objected toGeldof's attempts to legally change her surname to his. A compromise was reachedwhereby she is now known as Tiger Hutchence-Geldof. Hutchence's mother, PatriciaGlassop, complained in 2007 that Geldof had been preventing her from seeing hergranddaughter, and branding him \"Satan\" and \"very cruel.\" She claimed he wasonly interested in raising Tiger for the inheritance she would receive from herfather's estate when she came of age.In what appeared to be another case of history repeating itself, Peaches Geldofwas found dead on 7th April 2014, aged 25. As with her mother, her death wasblamed on a heroin overdose. Peaches had been married twice, first to Americanmusician Max Drummey, then to Thomas Cohen, the singer with the Englishpseudo-punk band S.C.U.M. Despite stating that his family was \"beyond grief\" atthe news, 'Saint Bob' somehow managed to pull himself together within a fewweeks and announce his marriage to his long-term girlfriend Jeanne Marine. Onthe Beltane ritual festival date of 1st May.Peaches was a member of the dark occult secret-society known as the OTO, OrdoTempli Orientis, (translating as Order of the Temple of the East,) another ofthe many organisations linked to Aleister Crowley, and one which has proven astrange attraction for a great number of celebrities. Peaches had the initialsOTO tattooed on her left forearm. She had also professed to being aScientologist, and had become interested in her second husband's religion ofJudaism. There are promotional pictures of both Peaches and one of the two sonsshe had with Cohen wearing the Mickey Mouse ears that were covered in theearlier chapter, a symbol hinting at the presence of trauma-based mind control.There has been much speculation that Peaches was privy to information on afar-reaching paedophile ring connected to the entertainment industry, and thatshe was preparing to go public with information she had on it. A little overfour months before her death, she had faced criminal investigation after shere-Tweeted the names of the two mothers who had allowed their babies to besexually assaulted by Ian Watkins, the singer with the Welsh band Lostprophets,who was convicted in 2013 of 13 charges of sexual assault on children, receivinga 29-year jail sentence. Child-rape and the entertainment industry merge yetagain. The two mothers concerned were allegedly fans of Watkins, and had allowedhim access to their infants in full knowledge that they would be sexuallyabused, but were not allowed to be named in court to protect the children. Thetwo, who were referred to in the case only as Woman A and Woman B, receivedsentences of 14 and 17 years' respectively. I wonder what kind of welcome theycan expect from their grown-up offspring when they get released?AMY WINEHOUSEAmy Winehouse's demise on 23rd July 2011 makes her the most recent high-profilemember of the infamous 27 Club. This is the macabre acknowledgement of the manyprominent musicians who, through the decades, just happen to have passed away atthe age of 27. Among its members are the aforementioned Jimi Hendrix, JimMorrison, Janis Joplin and Brian Jones, alongside Kurt Cobain, Robert Johnson,and founding member of The Grateful Dead, Ron 'Pigpen' McKernan. If there is asinister aspect attached, what could be the significance of the age 27? Thegeneral consensus seems to be that, in the science of numerology, double figuresare added together to get a single value between 1 and 10, in this case 9, (2+7), with all the occult significance that number seems to bring. Alsointeresting to note is that 27 is the first number in a very notable cosmicsequence. Doubling it each time gives you 54, 108, 216, 432, 864, etc, and thesecombinations crop up time and time again in the dimensions and movements of theSun, Moon and Earth, as well as 432 hertz representing the harmonic frequencyfor music. There's far more to say about all of this in a future volume!Many of the same elements as with her fellow members are present in AmyWinehouse's own life story; artistic genius coupled with a turbulent personallife; a difficult childhood; chaotic relationships; the continued presence ofdrug and alcohol abuse, and contradictory reports and vague police evidenceregarding the circumstances of her death. Winehouse had a Jewish familybackground, which may be neither here nor there, but there's no evidence of anyconnections to military 'intelligence' or any other type of governmentinstitution.The official line regarding her death is that it was the result of alcoholpoisoning, accentuated by the eating disorder Bulimia. This was an explanationthat was accepted without question by the general public, who had observed hertragic downfall into alcohol-dependency in recent months, and before it, herdabbling with many varieties of narcotics. It was yet another death put down tothe trappings of the live-fast-die-young Rock & Roll lifestyle.Possibly the strangest aspect surrounding Amy's death, however, were the reportsfrom one of her neighbours of noises, including what sounded like a loud drumbeat, coming from her apartment the night before her body was discovered. Theofficial story has Amy's live-in bodyguard Andrew Morris observing her\"laughing, listening to music and watching TV\" at 2am on the day of her death,after which she was apparently alone. She is said to have texted a friend at3.30am. Morris next reports seeing her apparently asleep at around 10am, butwhen she had not moved by a little after 3pm, the alarm was raised. Threebottles of vodka were reportedly found in her room. The news site 'London 24'reported on the day of her death that:\"One of her neighbours said he is convinced she died in the early hours ofFriday because he heard screaming. 'I think something happened that night. Itsounded like some weird sexual game. There was screaming and howling.' The man,who would not be named, said he was woken by the sound at around 2am that night.'It just sounded really weird and my son said he heard some kind of drumbeating.'\"This afternoon he heard one of Winehouse’s friends crying in the house, andrealised she was dead. He believes a friend left her at home after a night out,and returned this afternoon to find her body. 'She’s been quite low-profile andthat’s why, when I heard these sounds – screaming – I thought it was unlike her.I said to my son ‘maybe she’s taken a bad drug’.”Winehouse appeared to stay outside of the regular industry machine, makingnon-agenda music that fell well outside of formulaic templates. On the whole,she displayed none of the Illuminati symbolism which many of her contemporariesdid – although one picture in particular has to raise the curiosity of anytruthseeking researcher who has followed the story so far. In 2008, an artsculpture of Amy was unveiled in which she is playing dead, lying in a pool offake blood having been apparently shot. By her side is a set of Mickey Mouseears.Dionne Bromfield, Winehouse's god-daughter and singing protégée, appearedemploying the infamous 'one-eye' symbolism at the end of the video for her song'Foolin,' released two months before Amy's death.Reportedly, Amy was well-aware of the fabled 27 Club, and had expressed herfears in advance at becoming a part of it. Her personal assistant, Alex Haines,gave an interview to the now-defunct UK tabloid 'News of the World' in December2008, stating: “It was my job to look after her. But it was impossible. She hadto have a heroin and crack-pipe near her or she freaked out. She’d keep takingdrugs until she passed out. Cutting herself was her favourite pastime. Shereckoned she would join the ‘27 Club’ of rock stars who died at that age. Shetold me, ‘I have a feeling I’m gonna die young'.\"As a footnote to the strange business of The 27 Club, Matt Sergiou published apiece on his 'Conspiro Media' blog concerning its possible links to a phenomenonknown as 'Saturn's Return:'\"It’s believed this affects a person’s life during their late-twenties. Veteranastrologer, Rob Tillett states: 'Giant Saturn, the outermost planet in our solarsystem visible to the naked eye, spends some two-and-a-half years in each sign,taking about twenty-nine years to complete his journey around the Zodiac. Longexperience shows that there are two (or sometimes three) especially significantperiods of transition in a human lifespan; these are when Saturn returns bytransit to the place in the Zodiac he occupied when you were born. Astrologerscall this dimensional shift the ‘Saturn Return.’ Each twenty-nine yearsnaturally presents us with the challenge to rise to new levels of awareness, orface the consequences of having failed to gain the wisdom required to do so.This critical phase only happens once every 29 years, so at around age 28-30,57-59, and, (if you live long enough,) 86-88, you have a Saturn Return. Itsignifies a definite time of transformation, an emotional transition from onelife-phase to the next.”Tillett’s knowledge of the Saturn Return is featured in the 2008 book, ‘The 27s:The Greatest Myth of Rock & Roll.’ It’s written by Eric Segalstad.DAVID BOWIEWhen the death of David Bowie was announced to an unsuspecting world on Monday11th January 2016, the wave of emotion that swept through the collectiveconsciousness was largely unparalleled in history. Certainly, the deaths of JohnLennon and Elvis Presley were felt just as deeply, but they were in apre-internet era. With Bowie, there could hardly have been anyone in the worldwith a phone or a PC who wouldn’t have been aware of the news within minutes ofits release. The fact that his death dominated worldwide corporate newsschedules, too, has inevitably led some to question whether Bowie’s apparentdemise wasn’t some kind of mass human-energy-trawling ritual along the lines ofthe Super Bowl or Grammys.If ever an artist were to be selected for such an occulted harvesting ofconsciousness, few of the modern age would have more relevance than Bowie, anenigmatic performer whose entire persona was steeped in mysticism. In an agewhere all A-list artists now conform to corporate templates, and where maverickindividuality has been completely snuffed out, Bowie was a remnant of an erawhere personal creativity was still allowed to flourish, and although much ofhis may have been co-opted into the dark agendas of the industry, he at leastmanaged to demonstrate how a life’s work can be fascinating, enthralling andutterly original when an artist is left to express themselves unimpeded.This factor was evident from the very start. Can anyone name a chart hit of thismillennium which comes anywhere close to the genius creativity of ‘SpaceOddity,’ Bowie’s breakthrough single from 1969? In his article immediately inthe wake of Bowie’s announced death, Vigilant Citizen pointed out that the MajorTom character from ‘Space Oddity’ could well be symbolic of the ascension of manto higher realms of consciousness, given that he begins on Earth and ends uptranscending boundaries as he floats through outer space - just as the DavidBowman character did in the film ‘2001: A Space Odyssey.’ VC points out howinteresting it is that Bowie’s next creation, Ziggy Stardust, represents areversal of this. As an entity from deep space who descended to live amonghumans, there are parallels to messianic figures such as Jesus coming down fromthe heavens. It has since been announced that a constellation in the vicinity ofMars has been named after the Ziggy Stardust character, after Belgianastronomers noticed that the stars could be linked to form the lightning-boltshape that was a Ziggy motif.So straight away in Bowie’s career, there are mystical/ spiritual/ occulticelements. These only get taken further when you factor in Bowie’s own statedinterest in occult traditions. In 1976, he addressed the fascination he held forthe Jewish mystery-school teachings of the Kabbalah on the track ‘Station ToStation:’“Here are we,One magical movement,From Kether to Malkuth 1.”Kether and Malkuth are sephirot, or points, on the Kabbalah’s Tree Of Life. TheTree itself is symbolic of the process of attaining higher levels ofconsciousness through re-connecting with the divine. Kether and Malkuth are thehighest and most grounded points on the Tree, so here Bowie is talking ofdescending from Godliness down to lowest consciousness.Bowie also expressed a lifelong fascination with the works of Aleister Crowley,(why would that surprise anyone by now?!) Crowley and one of the occultorganisations that he helmed, got a namecheck on 1971’s ‘Quicksand:’“I’m closer to the Golden Dawn,Immersed in Crowley’s uniform,I’m not a prophet or a Stone Age man,Just a mortal with potential of a superman”Occult symbolism pervaded Bowie’s work to the very end. Much scrutiny wasapplied to ‘Blackstar,’ his final album, portentously released just two daysbefore his reported death. Even fans who usually reject anything vaguelysupernatural, were struck by how the album seemed to show Bowie acknowledginghis own imminent passing. There are overtones of a resurrection or a rebirth,too, such as in the lyrics to the title track:“Something happened on the day he died,Spirit rose a metre and stepped aside,Somebody else took his place, and bravely cried,(I’m a blackstar, I’m a blackstar.)”The album’s first single was ‘Lazarus,’ in reference to the biblical characterwho died, but was resurrected to life by Jesus four days later.Amid the emotional surge of grief and shock, there was confusion among many whenSky News brought on a character by the name of Jack Steven to join in the Bowietributes. Viewers were immediately struck by the unsettling similarity thatSteven seemed to have to Bowie, causing many to question whether the death couldpossibly have been a hoax, with Steven being the man himself following someplastic surgery, and with a new eye and hairpiece. Steven was introduced as adirector of Fortress Music, a company which certainly does exist in London, andhe was said to have come with a long history of A&R work. Although the internetthrows up no record of Steven’s work from decades past, there are at leastreferences to him from earlier in the 2000s, suggesting that he is, after all,who he was presented as. Given that the dark controllers of these industrieslove to mock the gullible masses and place elements of the truth in plain sight,however, given the strange business of ‘Dave Dave’ in the wake of MichaelJackson’s death and the whole Paul McCartney replacement theory, and givenBowie’s own attachment to dark occult practices, it’s not hard to understand whysome were ready to consider that possibility.The puzzling elements don’t stop there, however. The world was told that Bowiehad died following an 18-month battle with cancer, and the media made a point ofcontinually emphasising his age, 69. Within days, the announcement came of thedeath of actor Alan Rickman, also as the result of cancer, and also at the ageof 69. Before long, astute researchers had unearthed an episode of ‘TheSimpsons’ going back to 2013, in which a depiction of Rickman’s character fromthe ‘Harry Potter’ movies is shown, while the song ‘All The Young Dudes’ by MottThe Hoople plays, for no apparent reason, in the background. The song waswritten for the group by David Bowie. Within days of the Bowie and Rickmandeaths, came the announcement that Dale ‘Buffin’ Griffin, the drummer from MottThe Hoople, had died aged 67.Either the connection between all three of these being shown by ‘The Simpsons’was a complete coincidence with odds of several-billion to one, (the optionpreferred by mainstream media such as the UK’s ‘Daly Mail,’ implying, in allseriousness, that this really was an ‘inadvertent’ tribute,) or there wasforeknowledge of what was to come on the part of the programme-makers, (‘TheSimpsons’ does have previous in such matters,) … or the Universe is speaking tous in a very profound way through the workings of Synchro-mysticism. Which ofthese three factors could be at play?A pertinent question raised by many in the wake of the news that Bowie hadsecretly been battling cancer, is why someone of his creative, Bohemian,maverick persona would not have sought out alternative treatments for thedisease, since cannabis oil and other natural compounds have been proven to curecancer and many other diseases. It’s hard to imagine someone of Bowie’s ilkopting for the conventional treatments of the pharmaceutical corporations, suchas chemotherapy. The fact that the public only learned that Bowie had cancer atall when it had already apparently claimed his life - plus the fact thatpictures subsequently emerged of him in his final weeks laughing, dancing, andseeming to glow with good health - has inevitably called the official story intoquestion. A week after the death announcement, the UK’s Odeon cinema chainannounced that special screenings of Bowie’s movie ‘Labyrinth’ were to be shown,with the proceeds going to the Cancer Research UK charity.As befits Bowie’s very persona, the scenario surrounding his announced deathremains an enigma. Was it an elaborate hoax, allowing him to live out his finalyears in seclusion? Was there a sacrificial element to it, either againstBowie’s will or with his complicity? Or did things happen exactly the way themainstream media told us, (which would be something of a first.) It’s beyond thecapacity of any researcher who was not directly involved in Bowie’s world to saywith absolute certainty. Until direct proof comes along one way or the other, asever, we’re left with a handful of clues, our best guess based on the availableevidence, and a strong dose of intuition.AND THERE'S MOREA post on the pinballking.blogspot.com [http://pinballking.blogspot.com] sitereally put into perspective the massive number of deaths that the general publichas always seemed satisfied to chalk up as 'the way it goes' in this particularindustry. This list, exhaustive as it is, doesn't even include the many earlydemises in the hip-hop game, but is still shocking in its fullness:\"Have you ever noticed how all the major groups and artists are surrounded bypremature deaths? the Beatles (Stuart Sutcliffe, Brian Epstein), the RollingStones, Robert Johnson, Bill Haley & the Comets, Buddy Holly, the Yardbirds, theDoors, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Grateful Dead, the Byrds, theTemptations, Deep Purple, T. Rex, Elvis Presley, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Chicago, PinkFloyd, the Who, the Sex Pistols, AC/DC, Joy Division, Led Zeppelin, Bob Marley,Ozzy Osbourne, the Pretenders, the Beach Boys, Marvin Gaye, Thin Lizzy, theBand, Metallica, Rainbow, Styx, Red Hot Chilli Peppers, the Velvet Underground,Mother Love Bone, Steely Dan, Stevie Ray Vaughan, Creedence Clearwater Revival,Def Leppard, Small Faces, Guns N' Roses, Kiss, Queen, Steppenwolf, BlackSabbath, Nirvana, Hole, Blind Melon, Smashing Pumpkins, INXS, the Cars, theRamones, Run-DMC, the Clash, the Bee Gees, Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers,Pantera, Crowded House, Boston, Bruce Springsteen & the E-Street Band, MarilynManson band, Manic Street Preachers, Michael Jackson, the Misfits, AmyWinehouse, Warrant, Weezer, Gwar, Beastie Boys, Whitney Houston, etc. This listdoes not even include family members or crew members.One last strange death is worthy of a mention in the circumstances, I feel. Itmay well have been the freak accident against all the odds that the mainstreamnews presented it as. Or it may not. On 27th February 2015, the death ofCharmayne 'Maxee' Maxwell, one of the singers with the 90s R&B group Brownstone,was announced. Initial reports stated that she had collapsed after attending oneof her son's soccer games in Los Angeles, but this quickly morphed into herhaving fallen backwards out of the back door of her LA home while holding a wineglass, with the broken shards having 'caused fatal puncture wounds to the backof her neck.' Maxee's husband was the Danish record producer Carsten Soulshockwho is said to have arrived home to find her bleeding to death."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:2Pac: Amerikaz Most Wanted, Dead or Alive?: * http://real-eyes-realise-real-lies.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/2pac-amerikaz-most-wanted-dead-or-alive.html [http://real-eyes-realise-real-lies.blogspot.co.uk/2013/12/2pac-amerikaz-most-wanted-dead-or-alive.html]AmenRa Film Productions: Blood Sacrifice For Fame & Fortune & Freemasonry: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JAONLsyyec [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JAONLsyyec]Celebrity Blood Sacrifices For Fame and Money: * http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2013/03/blood-sacrifices-for-fame-and-money-2597260.html [http://beforeitsnews.com/alternative/2013/03/blood-sacrifices-for-fame-and-money-2597260.html]Government Whistleblower releases what he claims is Michael Jackson's finalphone call: * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssz-qS20B3M [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssz-qS20B3M]Is Dave Dave Michael Jackson?

alter-egos?\"I don't know if I'm a medium for some outside source. Whatever it is, frankly,I hope it's not what I think it is . . . \"Ozzy Osbourne\"I made a bargain with . . . the chief commander . . . of this earth and thenthe world we can't see.\"Bob Dylan\"When two of the biggest rock songs of all time, Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway ToHeaven' and The Eagles' 'Hotel California' both contain the same elements, itdeserves a closer look. I mean, both songs contain a lost or confused traveller,a path or a road, a lady shining a light to show the way, Heaven or Hell, wind,spirit, and a piper whose voice is calling.\"Wayne Bush on 'The Higherside Chats' podcast, June 2015We saw in the earlier chapter on trauma-based mind control how many artists –particularly those in the hip-hop genre – show a penchant for having alter-egos.While much of this is undoubtedly due to the presence of Monarch programming andother methods, there is another explanation for the high prevalence of alternatepersonalities.If the world in which we live were truly three-dimensional and solid, therewould be no possibility for the phenomenon of demonic possession – the presenceof outside forces that interact with the human energy field, allowing them tomerge with and temporarily 'take over' an individual's very being. But, as evenmainstream science is now acknowledging, this is not the type of reality inwhich we find ourselves. The apparently 'physical' world is in fact illusory,and only appears to be solid because of the way we perceive it through ourconsciousness. In its base state, everything in existence is energy vibrating atan endless array of frequencies. The lower the frequency of vibration, the moredense and solid an item will appear to be, including ourselves. As implausibleas this will seem to anyone encountering this subject area for the first time,as with so much else, this is knowledge that has been understood by mystics,secret-societies and religious orders the world over for millennia, and whichhas been systematically occulted (hidden) from the general public. Understandinghow synchronising energetic frequencies can be achieved through carefullycontrived rituals, is key to understanding how possession of a human body – andsome would say, soul – is a genuine reality. There is much evidence to suggestthat the dark priest-class at the helm of the corporate music industry are inpossession of this knowledge, and use it to puppeteer and manipulate many oftheir key artists, who they see as their possessions, in line with theirreligious doctrines.WHEN HIP-HOP WENT TO THE DARKSIDEWe've already explored the systematic degradation of hip-hop, but the sinisterdirection that the art-form seemed to take a short while after the engineeredEast Coast/ West Coast 'beef' of the mid-90s is worth a mention here. Within tenyears, mainstream hip-hop had gone from lyrics mainly concerned with partyingand celebrating life, plus MCs bragging about their lyrical skill and dexterity,to tracks dealing with evil, sin, death and the presence of dark parasiticforces. Having been an active radio and club DJ through this period, I can saythat this strange transition went largely un-noticed by the majority of hip-hopfans, (as it did to myself,) who chalked it all up merely as interestingartistic expression. Viewing the situation with the benefit of hindsight,however, suggests that this was a trend that happened anything but by chance.In 1998, DMX released his album 'It's Dark And Hell Is Hot.' The title alone isenough to raise curiosity, and more of it comes from the track 'Damien.' Thisdepicts DMX becoming affected by a character who enters his life at a low pointand promises to turn his fortunes around, so long as he will 'be his friend.'DMX has conversations with Damien, to whom no-one else seems to be privy. Thetrack ends with his new mentor coercing him into murdering one of his oldfriends. DMX laments the situation with the final line, \"I see know, ain'tnothin' but trouble ahead.\"Damien appears very much to be a reflection of DMX's own 'dark side,' broughtabout by the presence of an outside force. This wasn't the last we heard of him,either. The pair engage in a more hostile conversation on the track 'The Omen'from the album 'Flesh Of My Flesh, Blood Of My Blood', part of which goes asfollows:\"Yo, I ain't ask you for shit,Oh yes you did, when you really needed something then you allowed me to give,You sold me your soul when you didn't say no,Just let a nigga go, and gimme what you owe,Fuck was you thinking? Ain't shit for free,Ain't a motherfucker you know, can defeat me,Forgive me Father, for I have sinned,And with your help, I know the Devil won't win.\"In true movie style, the trilogy is completed with 'Damien III,' in which DMXprays to Jesus for salvation from the evil that has possessed him.Within weeks of the DMX album, Cam'ron had appeared with his debut LP'Confessions Of Fire.' The track 'Death' sees Cam'ron in conversation with aGrim Reaper character, imploring him not to take his soul:\"Come on, chill man, don't take me,Don't take you? Why not? Cause you rhyme now?Listen here muthafucka, lie down,Yo yo, chill, it ain't my time now,Come on, last year you had me duckin' the blaze,What about that bitch that you fucked wit' AIDS?Aww shit, come on, Death, I ain't know that,You know I wouldn't have went up in that bitch Kojak.\"Elsewhere, on the track 'Confessions,' Cam'ron is heard consumed with guilt overhis sins as he confesses to a minister:\"See, my two-year-old nephew, I swear I was holding him well,'Til he cried, and he cried, and he cried, I had to scold him and yell,You know, one thing led to another, I said, 'oh what the hell',Then I threw him against the wall. His parents I told them he fell,That's why I'm going to hell.\"And later:\"I don't wanna talk about that Sunday evening, that cold November weekend,When I had to grab that deacon, and put him into my dungeons of heathens,And then in tongues I was speakin.\"One of the earliest tracks which Kanye West produced for Jay-Z was 'Lucifer'from 2003's 'The Black Album,' which sampled the Max Romeo reggae tune 'ChaseThe Devil,' (also used on The Prodigy's 'Out Of Space.') Lucifer has beenidentified as a deity worshipped by the dark priest-class which controls theentertainment industry – along with so much else – and this tune appears toemploy their favourite trick of placing the truth right there in plain sight,all dressed up as 'entertainment.' Some have speculated that this track wasannouncing Kanye's induction into the dark fraternities, as his own career as anartist took off shortly afterwards. In the lyrics, Jay-Z addresses theby-now-common subject of spiritual possession by outside forces:\"Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him,But he also got a righteous cause for sinning,Them a murder me, so I gotta murder them first.\"And:\"Man, I gotta get my soul right, I gotta get these Devils out my life,These cowards gonna make a nigga ride,They won't be happy 'til somebody dies.\"By the time Eminem appeared on the scene with his debut 'The Slim Shady LP' inearly 1999, hip-hop's fan base had been nicely primed to accept lyrics aboutmurder, mayhem, mutilation, rape, death, sin, guilt and parasitic evil forces as'normal.' The Totalitarian Tiptoe in full effect. Looking back from an informedperspective, it's incredible how all this stuff was so neatly ushered in with,on the whole, very little objection. Listeners had been conditioned towardsextreme lyrical scenarios being passed off as 'just a bit of fun,' and Eminemhad been very much groomed as the key player in this role. What was shockingwhen first heard, had become completely normalised into popular culture by justa few years later, the bar being raised ever higher in terms of what was fairgame by way of lyrics. Given the subject matter that has already made it intorap tracks, it's difficult to imagine how things can possibly be degraded anyfurther. But I'm sure they'll find a way.Explaining the Slim Shady pseudonym, Eminem, (already a pseudonym for hisgovernment name Marshall Mathers,) said in the early days: \"Slim Shady is justthe evil thoughts that come into my head. Things I shouldn't be thinking about.\"This absorption was referenced on 'The Bad, The Sad & The Hated,' the Lil' Waynetrack on which he guested, with the lines:\"No one knows what it's like,To be the bad man, (when Eminem created Slim Shady,)To be the sad man, (and began to explore his dark-side alter-ego in his lyrics,)Behind the lies, (DJ Cinima,)No one knows what it's like to be hated, (he really started to connect withpeople across the world,)To be faded, (but the violence, rape, and murder in his lyrics,)To telling lonely lies, (have outraged just as many people as they won over.)The debut album's second single was 'Guilty Conscience.' It portrays threescenarios in which Dr. Dre appears as the voice of each individual's morality,while Eminem portrays their dark side, coercing them into robbery, murder anddate-rape. By the end of the track, Dre's voice of reason has turned dark too,as he also advocates murder. The chorus hook runs: \"These voices, these voices,I hear them. And when they talk, I follow, I follow, I follow.\"Elsewhere on the album, Eminem takes his three-year-old daughter along with himto a lakeside on '97 Bonnie & Clyde,' where he dumps the body of her motherwhose throat he has slit, as well as that of her new lover and his baby son,getting his daughter to help him tie rocks to her mother's foot to help weighher down. Equally telling as to the agenda that was being slowly unfolded was'Bad Meets Evil,' where Eminem talks of being a ghost that inhabits rapper RoyceDa 5'9's head:\"Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed,Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead,Told him each one of his boys is dead,I asked him to come to the dark side. He made a choice and said . . . \"A similar scenario was depicted on the track 'Murder Was The Case' on SnoopDoggy Dogg's 1993 album 'Doggystyle,' the common denominator between Snoop andEminem being that both artists are credited with having been 'discovered' by Dr.Dre, who executive-produced both albums. The track depicts Snoop beingcritically shot in a drive-by shooting, with echoes of a real-life incident thatoccurred during the recording of 'Doggystyle,' (in a rare case of apparentPredictive Programming occurring after the event rather than before!) Snoop,real name Calvin Broadus, was arrested in connection with the murder of PhillipWoldermariam, a rival gang member. Snoop was charged with murder along with hisbodyguard McKinley Lee, as Snoop was driving the vehicle from which the shotswere fired. Both Snoop and Lee were later acquitted.On 'Murder Was The Case,' Snoop is in a coma and on the brink of death, when heis visited by a demonic entity who offers to restore him to life and grant himall his wishes, but all on the condition that he remembers 'that ass is mine.'The following year, a short film directed by Dr. Dre and Fab Five Freddy wasreleased, also entitled 'Murder Was The Case.' In the narrative, Snoop dies, butis resurrected after making a deal with the Devil.Dr. Dre appeared with Cypress Hill frontman Be Real on a 1997 track tellinglytitled 'Puppet Master,' laden with imagery straight out of a horror movie. Dreappears as a demonic skeleton in a pope's mitre hat, with Be Real as a horned,clawed and bearded depiction of Baphomet/ Pan/ the Devil, (and in his regularguise looking much like Church Of Satan founder Anton LaVey.) Cypress Hill hadreleased their album 'Black Sunday' a few years before. Although most of thesongs were about smoking weed, the sleeve image offered more horror filmimagery, showing a rotting skull at the foot of a gothic cemetery.As if to assert his demonic credentials still further, Dre had also appearedwith former NWA groupmate Ice Cube on 'Natural Born Killaz,' a track narratedfrom the perspective of a crazed, psychopathic murderer who hints at beingpossessed, all set to a dark, twisted beat.Other references from rappers to having sold their soul in exchange for fame andfortune are legion. In 2Pac's 'Good Life' he states: \"Picture a nigga on theverge of livin' insane, I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang.\" DMXaddresses soul-selling again on 'Let Me Fly' with: \"I sold my soul to the Deviland the price was cheap.\" On 'Eyes Closed,' Kanye West told listeners: \"I soldmy soul to the Devil, that's a crappy deal, Least it came with a few toys like aHappy Meal.\" Later, on 'Black Skinhead' from his extremely dark 'Yeezus' album,he remarks: \"They say I'm possessed, it's an omen.\"Lil' Wayne, an artist whose back-catalogue is a one-stop-shop in everything thathas gone wrong with \"hip-hop,\" slipped a reference to 'Satan' into hisunsettling track 'Love Me' in 2012, with barely anyone batting an eyelid. Inbetween Future boasting that \"I got some down bitches I can call,\" and Drakeadvising us that ''long as I got my bitches I couldn't give a fuck about nohaters,\" Wayne's line states: \"And these hoes love me like Satan, maaan.\" Aquestion has always occurred to me – why is it taken as a given that the hoes inquestion would love Satan in the first place? The video contains split-secondframes where Wayne is depicted as a horned entity in another blink-and-you-missit exercise in subliminals, designed to implant an image in the viewer'ssubconscious mind. As Black Sheep Magazine observed on the subject:\"If \"rapper,\" (we're told,) Lil' Wayne had emerged with his current style of\"music\" 15 to 20 years ago, he would have undergone mass ridicule, been laughedoff the scene and would never have been taken seriously in the business again.\"It's bad enough that Wayne's records are mind-numbingly vacuous and instantlydisposable – and that he and his fellow Young Money/ Cash Money freaks, bymanipulation, dominate what is laughingly passed off as a 'hip-hop' scene now.All this is before you get into the deeply sick nature of the lyrics and imageryemployed in his output, with most of his followers so brainwashed hat they'veprobably failed to even register it, and would laugh off explanations such asthis as paranoid and delusional, as they go back to having their sense ofnormality and world-view dictated to them by this demented trash.\"I guess they're not fans then. You can watch the video to 'Love Me' here: * https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=KY44zvhWhp4 [https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=KY44zvhWhp4]JUST THE TWO OF USThe concept of prominent artists having alter-egos has been slowly normalisedinto the culture in the past few years. Some years ago, Beyonce announced heralternate identity known as Sasha Fierce. The album, titled in no uncertainterms 'I Am . . . Sasha Fierce,' appeared in November 2008. It was a double-discset, with the first said to represent Beyonce's own character and consistingmainly of slow and mid-tempo ballads, while the second disc was said to be thedomain of her Sasha Fierce side, consisting of more uptempo and energetic songs.In comments that smack of covertly revealing the presence of a possessiveentity, Beyonce explained the juxtaposition of her character at the time as:\"I turn into Sasha. I wouldn't like Sasha if I met her off-stage. She's tooaggressive, too strong, too sassy, too sexy. I'm not like her in real life atall. I'm not flirtatious and super-confident and fearless like her.\"What I feel onstage I don't feel anywhere else. It's an out-of-body experience.I created my stage persona . . . so that when I go home, I don't have to thinkabout what it is I do. Sasha isn't me. The people around me know who I reallyam.\"(During the writing of this book, an interview with a New York singer namedGianna, who was being tipped for big things in the mainstream, came across myradar. In it, she talked of having an alter-ego named Lola Grey, of whom shesaid: \"it's just a different side of me that sometimes comes out when I write mymusic. She's more forward and a bit braver than me.\" Gianna's early publicitypictures featured her wearing polka-dot trousers, with one shot featuringmultiple representations of her face with one eye obscured. Why am I getting astrong sense of deja-vu?)Beyonce's performance at the 2013 Super Bowl half-time show came under scrutinyby many researchers who pointed out how, at a key point, her appearance startedto change. This, they suggested, was a key point at which she actually cameunder the possession of an outside entity. The photos of the moment in questionare certainly unflattering and a far cry from Beyonce's usuallycarefully-managed image. In fact, their sharing on social media brought aforceful request from Beyonce's management that they be taken down and no longerused.There were alternative headlines of a similar nature when Beyonce arrived withJay-Z to perform a show in New Zealand in October 2013. Part of their welcomeinvolved a group of local Maoris performing a traditional Haka in their honour –an ancestral war dance used to intimidate enemies before a battle. The ritualinvolves synchronised dancing along with purposeful grimacing and sticking-outof the tongue. Beyonce immediately got into the spirit of the dance, hercontorted facial expressions looking very similar to the ones that appearedduring the Sasha Fierce show, prompting some to question whether an element ofspiritual possession was going on here too, (and whether this, in fact, is whatis happening to the Maori warriors when they engage in their ritual.)Jay-Z has gone by various personas over the years, the most common being'Jiggaman' and 'Hove,' the latter being an abbreviated form of Jay Hova, a namewhich has been considered arrogantly blasphemous by some of a religiouspersuasion. The concept of rappers portraying themselves as 'gods' was continuedby Kanye West when he adopted his 'Yeezus' persona in 2013.The Atlanta rapper T.I. put out an album in 2007 titled 'T.I. Vs T.I.P.' Thesleeve designs showed a suited, business-orientated side of him, juxtaposed withhis street/ ghetto representation, with the content depicting the conflictbetween his two 'sides.'Nicki Minaj's Roman Zolanski alter-ego, which she publicly 'exorcised' at the2012 Grammys, and Lady Gaga's Jo Calderone character, were documented in theearlier chapter on mind control.ENTER THE RAIN MANThere is one fictional character from the world of movies which has appeared inmore hip-hop tracks of recent years than any other, inspiring several songtitles. Given rappers' enthusiasm for identifying with gangsters and streethustlers, you might expect this to be 'Scarface's Tony Montana, 'The Godfather'sDon Corleone, or someone of that ilk. So why does the honour go to adysfunctional, autistic savant played by Dustin Hoffman instead?Welcome to the strange and unsettling world of Rain Man.On the surface, Rain Man would appear to be a reference to Hoffman's characterin the 1988 Hollywood movie of the same name, also starring Tom Cruise. Atleast, this is the publicly-acceptable guise of the character that goes by thatname. As many have demonstrated, however, there seems to be a far more sinisteragenda at work. Rain Man is actually an other-worldly entity that seems to berevered by the sick occult practitioners manipulating the music industry, andwhich many artists appear to be channeling through themselves viacarefully-crafted rituals. The movie merely offers plausible deniability.US researcher Lenon Honor commented on the subject in my 'Good Vibrations'interview with him in 2013:\"I did a film entitled 'The Workings Of Evil Revisited,' and I have a wholebunch of references even going back 20, 30, 40 years where they were referringto this 'Rain Man' entity . . . And when you really get into it, you realisethat part of what goes on with the mind control of the masses, is toindoctrinate them into deifying particular beings that most people wouldconsider 'demonic.' So you have children singing these songs, and they'regetting these embedded images, subliminal messages, etc, where they're usingparticular symbols. They're using skulls, they're using this Rain Man entity,these lyrical references. People are steadily being indoctrinated into a levelof occultism that is quite dark and sinister. And I have to say, when I wentinto doing my analysis of all this at the beginning, I had no idea how sinisterit all gets.\"Lenon was first alerted to the infiltration of Rain Man by the video toRihanna's international smash 'Umbrella.' In a split-second frame that can onlybe properly analysed by pausing the video, Rihanna appears inside a pyramid,apparently striking an unusual pose. Close examination, however, shows this hasbeen digitally manipulated, and that Rihanna's body has been made to look likethe Baphomet entity, her arms representing outstretched horns, her head andshoulders digitally altered to form a snout and eye sockets, and her legsrepresenting the jaw structure. Lenon has speculated that this may be arepresentation of the Rain Man entity, however, particularly given some of thelyrical clues in the song. It starts with Jay-Z proclaiming \"Jay, Rain Man isback,\" also reminding us that Rihanna is the \"good girl gone bad.\" There arethen multiple references to the character narrating the song, offering shelter\"under my umbrella.\" An excellent article on the Rain Man entity in musicappeared on the Spiritsspeakstruths blogspot site, which analyses thesignificance of the umbrella imagery further:\"Umbrella in Latin also translates to 'shadow' . . . Umbra can also mean Phantomor Ghost. The name Umbra appears in the Necronomicon, which is a 'fictional'occult book of demonology by H.P. Lovecraft. In the book, Umbra is one of thethirteen globes of Yog Sothoth, a celestial body . . . Basically, Umbra is aDevil.\"In 'Umbrella', Jay sings “Rain Man is back, with little Miss Sunshine, Rihannawhere you at?” Notice 'Rain Man' and Jay are two separate people in thatlyric . . . The entity introduced itself as Rain Man, and Rihanna respondedsaying, ”you had my heart, and we will never be a world apart. You're part of myentity, here for infinity.\"\"This song is not about love for a man, but a spirit, (a fallen spirit namedRain Man.) Rihanna herself stated on the set of the 'Umbrella' video, that thissong “has a deeper meaning to it. You have to really listen to it.\" Is itpossible that Rain Man is a Devil?\"Jay-Z announced his Rain Man pseudonym around the time of his appearance on theRihanna track. Attempting to explain his ability to intuit lyrics when in thatmode, with no need to write anything down, he commented:\"I look at it like a puzzle. Like, I try to figure out what Imma say on there,figure out the emotion on the track, what it's saying . . . then I go through myRain Man. I can't explain it to y'all. It just comes out of the air for me. Youstart mumbling.\"In a separate interview with MTV News, he said:\"I started doing hidden messages into music to remove the technical, then itevolved from there . . . I guess I'm an idiot savant as well.\"Jay is far from the only corporate rapper to have, for some reason, demonstratedan affinity with Rain Man. Around the same time, Eminem recorded a track, itselfentitled 'Rain Man.' Introducing it on-stage alongside soon-to-be-slain fellowrapper Proof, he told the crowd:\"My name isn't going to be Slim Shady no more. No more Eminem either. I don'teven go by my government name Marshall Mathers . . . If I do come back, you knowwhat my new name gon' be? Rain Man.\"The track itself, performed for good measure alongside Dr. Dre, (who else?!),includes the lyrics:\"My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame,My soul is possessed by this Devil, my new name is . . . \"Eminem is no stranger to the subject of soul possession, a concept he hasexplored several times on record. 'My Darling,' an extra track from the'Relapse' album, is among his darkest and most disturbing of all – and that'ssaying something given the vast array of competition! It sees Eminem and hisalternate personality of Slim Shady arguing and taunting each other. It all putsme in mind of the movie 'Identity' starring John Cusack and Ray Liotta, in whicha disparate group of characters are brought together at a motel during a stormand die one-by-one . . . until the film reveals they were all creations in themind of a dangerous mental patient.Elsewhere, the pushing of the Rain Man character into the collectivesubconscious of hip-hop's audience was far from over. By the time Gucci Mane andLil' Wayne had both produced tracks entitled 'Rain Man,' (what are the odds ofthis being just 'by chance?') an alternative attempt at an explanation had beenoffered. Lil' Wayne's breakthrough track was 'Let It Rain' by Fat Joe,(released, appropriately enough, on Hallowe'en in 2006!) In hip-hop streetslang, 'let it rain' has come to refer to the throwing of wads of cash into theair at strip-clubs, causing the notes to flutter down individually as rathergenerous tips for the girls. Hence, recent references to it raining and anindividual being a 'rain man' have been passed off in this regard. The darkagenda has continued at an unseen level, however, with the seemingly plausiblecover story merely offering an excuse for puppeteered artists to continuepushing the same ideas.In his book 'Sacrifice: Magic Behind The Mic,' Isaac Weishaupt offers someinsight into why the music industry's controllers might be so set on havingtheir key artists invoke other-worldly entities through their performances:\"The reason why magic practitioners perform spirit evocations, (and internalinvocations,) is to pull energy or information from another realm. The artistcan pull knowledge, lyrics or energy through the ritual. Any energetic being canbe evoked, and that is why even fictional characters like H.P Lovecraft'sCthulhu are used in evocation. So long as you have a defined set ofcharacteristics, you can perform magic to have an energetic connection with themin order to gain their insight . . . \"It takes an incredible amount of energy and focus in order for these people toget in touch with this other realm of existence, so it drains them emotionallyand physically, perhaps explaining the overwhelming amount of drug abuse foundin the industry.\"THE WORLD IS A STAGEA key method of putting rituals right in the public's face – and gaining theirenergetic input to the possible evoking of supernatural entities – has come fromthe large-scale stage shows of recent years. Events such as the Grammys, the MTVand VMA Awards and the US Super Bowl half-time show, have been getting moreoccultic and esoteric with every passing year. These televised shows benefitfrom audiences numbering several million, allowing for a scale of participationfrom the unwitting audience never before seen in human history. Among the mostinfamous have been the 2014 Grammy Awards, which featured industrypuppet-of-choice Katy Perry apparently performing an actual witchcraft routineto her song 'Dark Horse.' Her 'act' is prefaced by a sinister voiceover saying;\"She cast spells from crystal balls. Invoking spirits. She put me in a trance.\"It's all there – horned and cloaked demonic figures, fire, esoteric sigils, asupernatural black horse with glowing red eyes reminiscent of the one in thedeeply sinister Denver International Airport. The imagery at these shows is nowso blatant – and so unconnected to the lyrical content of the songs – that it'seven starting to grab the attention of those not known for their acknowledgementof 'conspiracy'-type subjects. The Katy Perry Grammys show prompted a Tweet fromformer University of Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron, saying:\"Is it just me or are some of the Grammy performances so far (sic) seem to bereally demonic? Looks like there is a lot of evil in the world.\"No, it's not just you, mate. Even 'E! Online' mainstream entertainment newsTweeted:\"Um, did we just witness actual witchcraft during Katy Perry's Grammysperformance?\"Another classic was the 2012 Grammys, held in the wake of Whitney Houston'shighly suspicious death. This one hosted Nicki Minaj's apparent black mass andpublic 'exorcism' of her Roman Zolanski entity. She entered wearing a blood-redrobe, (representing one of the principal colours associated with Saturn,) andaccompanied by an actor portraying the Pope. The performance went on to mocktraditional Christian church services.As Isaac Weishaupt observes:\"That night she performed her song 'Roman Holiday,' in which she channels aspirit named Roman, one of the many spirits that she claims takes over her body.During the controversial performance, she conducted a Satanic ritual and wasdepicted receiving an exorcism.\"Only days before, Madonna had set tongues wagging with the over-the-top occulticnature of her act at the Super Bowl half-time show. She had presented somethingof a teaser for this when she had commented in a recent interview with CNN/CIA's Anderson Cooper that:\"The Super Bowl is kind of like the Holy of Holies in America. I’ll come outhalfway of the 'church experience,' and I’m gonna have to deliver a sermon.It’ll have to be very impactful.”Madonna has earned the unofficial nickname of 'Grand Priestess' of the musicindustry, in reflection of her faithfully serving her corporate masters for overthree decades, and this status certainly seemed to be exploited in the show,appearing as she did in full Babylonian goddess regalia, with rappers NickiMinaj and M.I.A. in subservient supportive roles to their Queen.While most of the ritual stage magick occurs at US shows, a British institutionwhich has grabbed the attention of occult researchers is the long-establishedGlastonbury Festival, held in the wake of the Summer Solstice each June. Of thegreat many UK music festivals that happen annually, this is the only one that isgiven hours and hours of live coverage by the BBC. Why would that be, I wonder?Its ritualistic relevance was explored in a fascinating and highly recommendedblog entitled 'The Illuminati, Satanism, Drugs & The Music Industry.' Not reallyone for the kids, then. The article observes:\"Glastonbury is famous for its Pyramid Stage. At night you can see the apexfully illuminated, and nowadays, they have a laser beam coming straight throughthe centre of the apex and up into the night sky . . . The structure was builtclose to the Glastonbury Abbey/ Stonehenge ley-lines, and over the site of ablind spring. The pyramid shape is a very powerful structure, the apex of whichdraws energy up and transmits it still further, while the energy from the starsand sun are attracted to it and drawn down. . . . This pyramid grew to symbolise the magic of Glastonbury Festival beforeit famously burned down in 1994, shortly before the Festival. In 2000, thephoenix rose from the ashes, and a glittering 100ft steel structure was erectedwith a massive footprint of 40m x 40m – four times larger than its previousincarnation. This current structure was designed and built by local Piltonvillager Bill Burroughs, and is based on the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt.It’s the most instantly-recognised festival stage in the world, and for 40years, those who have been going to Glastonbury and dancing and singing in frontof the Pyramid, are participating in an occult pagan ritual whether they know itor not.\"KALI CYRUSIn 2013, it was Miley Cyrus's performance at the MTV VMA Music Awards that cameunder scrutiny. Quite apart from the alternative media's interpretation of whatwas going on, this one caught the attention of the mainstream news, tabloids andgossip magazines, setting tongues wagging (pun intended) around water coolersacross the US and beyond. This show demonstrated the most blatant transitionfrom Cyrus' previous persona as the squeaky-clean, girl-next-door HannahMontana, (another creation of the Disney Corporation,) into the debased,sluttish, pornographic persona she has employed since.According to the outstanding US researcher and film-maker Freeman, Cyrus'continual extending of her tongue was no random thing. In fact, he claimed onhis Youtube video on the subject, she was invoking the spirit of the Hindugoddess Kali.\"Once you start to discover the esoteric roots of these rituals – and this isgoing back all the way to Ancient Greece, or the Egyptian stories . . . Theactors would always be the representations of the God forms, or even invokethese God forms into themselves to then give the performance. And this reallywas the purpose of an actor. So when I started to elaborate on thesehigh-profile rituals, one of the first was, of course, Britney Spears kissingwith Madonna. Madonna in a top hat coming down 13 steps to the song 'Hollywood,'which is based on a magician's wand, the holly wood, and then presenting Britneyto the world and giving her the kiss of death, if you will. Madonna is a classicexample of how this is all inter-worked into the system, because she is a HighPriestess within Kabbalah, even going out and performing ceremonies with theRabbi in Israel. She takes it to the ultimate. She's even removed the vowelsfrom her name, being MNDA now. This is to give her name a more Kabbalistic bedbecause Hebrew doesn't have these vowels.\"So each one of these celebrities has been brought to us as a God form or aGoddess form. So I have a depiction of Britney as Athena on my website, with abunch of the other celebrities and the different variations they've used withthese God forms. So when I saw Miley Cyrus coming out of that giant teddy bearat the VMAs, it was clear to me, with the amount of tongue gesturing she wasdoing, that she was to evoke Kali.\"Kali was frequently depicted as sticking her tongue out, in the same way thatNew Zealand Maori warriors do during their previously-mentioned Hakas. Aprotruding tongue is also a feature of the deity on the sun calendar of theAztecs. Kali's fearsomeness was enforced by the fact that she wore the heads ofvanquished enemies on a belt around her waist. She was always symbolised withlong, flowing hair, and as Freeman observed in his written article on the event,Miley appeared to be stroking an invisible mane of hair during her performance.\"Kali, consort of Shiva, symbolises the 'Time of Death;' 'The Black One.' OnceKali had destroyed all the demons in battle, she began a terrific dance out ofthe sheer joy of victory. The unleashed form of Kali often becomes wild anduncontrollable. Kali was so much involved in the killing spree that she gotcarried away and began destroying everything in sight. Kali is the fearful andferocious form of the mother Goddess.\"Freeman's view is that the Miley Cyrus act was a subtle, psychological way ofimplanting an idea into the minds of the viewing world public – that America hasbecome a completely debased and immoral society, a modern Babylon, inviting thescorn and contempt of the rest of the world, whilst at the same time,representing the sick, twisted values of the control system running it.Miley's tongue act continued long after the VMA event, as she would continuesticking it out spontaneously on TV and at live appearances. It certainly lendsweight to the idea that she had been programmed into doing it ahead of the VMAshow, and that the habit took some time to wear off. By late 2015, a publicityphotoshoot saw her appearing bare-breasted and wearing a strap-on cock. Manyobservers commented on the empty and soulless look in her eyes by this point.Whenever celebrities go off the rails like this, the first question that occursto members of the public is, 'where are the parents? What are they thinking of,letting this happen to their daughter?!' As we've discussed in a previouschapter, the entertainment world is nothing like the rest of human society whenit comes to family relationships. Many mind-controlled artists come fromgenerational bloodlines of such activity, with parents doubling as theirexploitative handlers. In Miley's case, her father is the country music artistBilly Ray Cyrus, best known for his hit 'Achy Breaky Heart.' Considering whatFritz Springmeier told me about the country scene being a hotbed of trauma-basedmind control, perhaps we shouldn't be too surprised at the path his daughter hastaken. (The Mormon Church operating out of Salt Lake City which spawned TheOsmonds, and the Church of Scientology with its celebrity endorsers like TomCruise and John Travolta, are also said to be strongly involved in the mindcontrol agenda. Hip-hop pioneer Doug E Fresh is said to be a member of theChurch of Scientology, as are Will Smith and Jada Pinkett, and Priscilla andLisa-Marie Presley. Charles Manson was a former member.)BONES, BOARDS AND SPELLSIn 2004, a multi-volume video series titled 'They Sold Their Souls for Rock 'n'Roll' appeared in the US. Although the heavy Christian bias delivered in theform of church sermons will prove offputting for many non-Christians, the seriesdid make a number of salient points about the demonic influences that had beensweeping the music industry for decades. The ministers involved were content toput this all down to 'the Devil's work,' of course, missing the point thatthere's far more to these dark, malevolent agendas than a singular entity. Amongthe acts scrutinised by the series was the rap crew Bone Thugs N Harmony, whowere signed by NWA's Eazy E to his new Ruthless Records label in 1993.From the start, the group displayed a fascination with witchcraft and the darkoccult. One of their earliest tracks, 'Hell Sent', has the then-teenage grouprapping about coming out of Hell to Earth 'to destroy all worshippers of peace.'Krayzie Bone states: \"Sold my soul to the Devil, but I changed my mind, now Iwant it back. But he won't co-operate, so now it's time to jack.\"The intro to their debut album, 'Creepin' On A Come Up,' features a demonicvoice at the end stating: \"Now, let's run through the doors backwards, myfriends, and play with the ouija board.\" This leads into a song entitled 'MrOuija,' where the group ask the board to predict their future, with constanttalk of 'a bloody murder' given in response.Working with the group appears to be bad luck for their collaborators. It hasbeen pointed out that 2Pac, The Notorious BIG, Eazy E, and Lil' Boo of TheGraveyard Shift, (Krayzie Bone's cousin,) all died in the same years as theircollaborations.'Tha Crossroads' was the Bone Thugs tribute to their mentor Eazy E after hedied, reportedly of AIDS, in 1995. The title alludes heavily to the legend ofbluesman Robert Johnson selling his soul to the Devil at a crossroads inexchange for great musical talent. Eazy E himself has been rumoured to have beena practitioner in the dark occult.The 'They Sold Their Souls' documentary chronicles a witchcraft spell includedon the sleeve to the Bone Thugs album \"E. 1999 Eternal.' It is written backwardsand can only be deciphered when held up to a mirror, working in much the sameway as the back-masking audio messages from our earlier chapter. The film statesthat this is the same tactic used by the witches involved in the Salem trials ofthe 17th century, who would send people a letter written backwards containing acurse, or hex. The dark energy behind the spell would supposedly be absorbedinto the person's soul once they had been tricked into reading it in a mirror.THREE SIXESA crew that has to raise eyebrows in a similar way to Bone Thugs, is the GrammyAward-winning collective known as Three 6 Mafia out of Memphis, Tennessee. Thegroup have explained away their choice of name by saying it represented the factthat there were originally three members, before three more were added to makesix. Placed into the overall context of the corporate entertainment industry,however, (they're signed to the Columbia Records imprint of Sony, after all!) itseems far more likely that the group name is to be taken to mean '666 Mafia' –especially as 'Triple Six Mafia' was one of their many early names. In separateinterviews, group member Juicy J, whose father is a Christian preacher andmother a librarian, has said that they chose the group name to be deliberatelycontroversial and get noticed.There's also the matter of their lyrical content, such as on the track 'Fuckin'Wit Dis Click:'\"I'm on a cross, Lucifer, please cut me free, (cut me free,)I'll draw your portrait if you pull these nails out my feet, (nails out myfeet,)My cross turns upside down\"\"No Lord could stop us now,Cause the demons reborn again\"\"Follow me into the trees,Watch me rob Adam,And watch me rape Eve\"And in the song 'Sleep:'\"Satanic in scent were wrote on the scent,It's so sacred, created by Lucifer slaves.\"Of very much the same ilk, (as highlighted in an article on hip-hop's Satanicagenda by the Canadian writer Henry Makow,) is the Kansas rapper Tech N9ne, whotook his name from the Tec-9 semi-automatic handgun. The Wikipedia entry on himincludes the intriguing sentence: \"He never met his father, and his mothersuffered from epilepsy and lupus when he was a child, which emotionally affectedhim and inspired him to 'search for God.' He would explore abandoned buildingswith his best friend, hoping to catch a ghost on film.\"In his article, Makow points out Tech N9ne's trademark ability to rap backwards,with the phrases only making sense when the recording is played in reverse. Thisputs us right back into realms of back-masking, of course, and AleisterCrowley's teaching of ''let him . . . listen to phonograph recordsreversed . . . \" It's claimed that a phrase in his track 'Demons,' whichfeatures the chorus \"There's a demon inside of me, can I kill it? Hell no! Can Ikill it? Hell no! Can I kill it? Hell no!,\" when reversed comes out as:\"Ahh . . . Slowly die . . . I don’t wanna,Ahh . . . Slowly die . . . I don’t wanna,Hell is coming! Onward . . . Hell is coming! Onward . . . Hell is gonna keep us enemies my friend . . . Onward!\"THE WORD OF TODDA shocking series of claims of what goes on behind closed doors at major recordlabels surfaced on the internet a few years ago. It was a recording of a lecturereportedly given some time in the 1970s by a man known as John Todd, who claimedto have been an employee at several of the big corporations of the time, and asthe manager of Zodiac Productions. This was described as 'the largest musicconglomerate in the world, owning RCA Records, Columbia Records, Motown Records,and almost all the concert-booking agencies in the United States.' In turn,Zodiac is said to have had ties to Chase Manhattan, Standard Oil and Lloyds ofLondon.In Todd's now-famous monologue, he tells of dark magic spells being cast onmaster recordings of popular music, and relates this to an encounter with DavidCrosby of Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, sometime after Todd says he exited theindustry.\"I saw David the day before Christmas last year and talked with him. I got himaway from this witch he was with. He told her to go shopping. We were in WestHollywood. We got talking. I said, 'David, I'd like to ask you a couple ofquestions.' I said, 'I already know the answers.' I said, 'I've been gone fiveyears. I need to know if certain things are still the way they were when I left.\"I said, 'do they still bring the master to the Temple Room?' Dave said, 'yeah'.I said, 'do they still have the coven conjure demons into the master?' He said,'of course.' I said, 'now I gotta know something. What's the main reason forrock music?' . . . He said, 'the same as when you were in. So that we can placespells on people that we couldn't cast spells upon.' I said, 'OK, one lastthing. I've been hearing that you must be an initiated witch now to get a recordcontract.' He said, 'that's right. Many of us that weren't total witches have tobe witches now in order to produce music.'Todd goes on to explain that a master recording of a song or album, whichprovides the content for every vinyl, CD or cassette copy that gets released tothe public, gets taken into the Temple Room that all the major record companieshave in their HQ, on a full moon. The master is placed on an altar in the Northof the room, he states, with a pentagram engraved in the floor. A coven ofthirteen hand-chosen witches and wizards then come in, and conjure up a demonicpower, then order it to tell the demons under it to follow every individual copycoming off the original master.\"Rock music is not just a song. It is supernatural music that witches carefullydesign by their spirit guides, in the form of spells. Much of the songs arewritten in what we call Witch Language. To give you an idea, many of you talk ona CB. Unless you know what a 'smokey' is, and a '10/4' and a 'front door/ backdoor rocking chair' and these type of things, you don't know what you're talkingabout. Same with witches. When you're in the first or second level, you have tolearn over 2,000 words that, said by anybody else, means something totallydifferent than when you say it.\"Todd cites The Eagles' 'Hotel California' as an example of a song which mostpeople have heard on the radio, but whose lyrics most would be at a loss toexplain on the surface:\"Stop and think how many songs are out there that you really like, but you don'thave any idea what the person was taking about? 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road? Howabout 'The Destroyer' by Kiss? . . . The Beatles song 'Helter Skelter,' in witchlanguage, nobody knew what it meant. Manson did because he belonged to theProcess. 'Helter Skelter' is a several-thousand-year-old word. Most of the musicis either about Helter Skelter or a place called The Night Winds, which is what'Hotel California' is about, and different doctors of witchcraft. Kiss openlybragged how they were gaining control of people through their music because thepeople played their music. They told how they didn't form their own group. Theirchurch – because they were ordained ministers of a Satanist church – placed themtogether. And that's how most of the music is done.\"The speech in question is available here – https://www.YouTube.com/v/Otti-82jEAc[https://www.YouTube.com/v/Otti-82jEAc]Inevitably, there have been claims that John Todd's testimony was some kind ofhoax, as well as doubt as to how reliable his revelations can be taken to begiven his questionable past. He has been known by other identities, includingJohn Todd Collins, and 'Lance.'Todd appears to have come from a long-running bloodline of witches using thefamily name Collins, who are said to have come to the US from England andbrought witchcraft to the Salem Mass. He was reportedly initiated as a witch atthe age of 13, becoming a High Priest at 18, then joining the military, (here wego again.) Later, he reportedly became a born-again Christian, and hisconversion is said to have prompted his defection. Following his becoming awhistleblower, he claimed that a $200,000 bounty had been put on his head by hisformer elite paymasters, and that he had been forced to go underground. It's notclear whether or not he is still alive.The transcript of a taped interview apparently made by John Todd Collins isavailable here – http://www.beyondweird.com/occult/jtc1.html[http://www.beyondweird.com/occult/jtc1.html]Whatever the case with Todd in particular, however, his is far from the onlyvoice that has come forward with such claims about the darker side of thecorporate music business, and the gist of what he said has been backed up byother industry insiders and whistleblowers. In particular, many have confirmedthe presence of temples within record company HQs.

'Least it came with a fewtoys, like a Happy Meal\"Kanye WestI swear I wanted to be, like, the Amy Grant of music, but it didn’t work out,And so I sold my soul to the Devil.”Katy Perry\"You sold your soul for material things,I give a fuck if people think that you're a lyrical king!Ain't it funny how they love it when a grown man brags,About the jewellery and money that none of his fans have?\"DISL Automatic: 'Here I Stand' (2013)THE FAUSTIAN PRINCIPLEThe German legend of Faust is one which has been seen for decades as having morethan a little allegorical relevance to the entertainment industry. Dating backalmost 500 years, it tells the story of a scholar who, bored by his life andcraving great knowledge and all manner of worldly pleasures, makes a pact withthe Devil. The price he pays for these gifts is nothing less than his eternalsoul. The term 'Faustian' now describes a situation where an individual hastraded their moral integrity in exchange for fame and success at the hands ofanother party.The music industry has long had its own re-telling of the legend, in the storysurrounding the blues musician Robert Johnson. 'The Crossroads' was the title ofhis fabled song in which he documents having made a deal with the Devil at acrossroads in exchange for great musical talent. It is widely assumed that thesong, far from being fictional, was a real-life account of Johnson'ssoul-selling experiences. According to Wikipedia: \"In folk magic and mythology,crossroads may represent a location 'between the worlds' and, as such, a sitewhere supernatural spirits can be contacted and paranormal events can takeplace.\" Johnson died in extremely strange circumstances in 1938, an early memberof The 27 Club.It becomes clear with only a little digging beneath the glossy surface, thatthis is the type of scenario that governs the corporate entertainment industry,and determines who gets to become its celebrities. The results lie in just howdesperate its initiates are for fame and fortune, and how far they are preparedto degrade their morals accordingly. An encounter with 'the Devil' may beassumed to be allegorical, but the concept is still the same. Multiple accountsfrom first-hand insiders demonstrate that real 'success' comes at a price higherthan most would imagine. An observer might be left with the notion that, as anaspiring musician, actor or any other kind of celebrity, the best thing that canever happen to you is not making it big in the ranks of the Illuminati-ownedindustry machine!Louis Farrakhan, long-standing Minister for the Nation Of Islam organisation,nailed it in a speech which was later sampled by rapper Cormega on his 2015track 'Industry,' when he said: \"Who do you think you are? To them you arenothing but a piece of meat. And you're only as valuable as your last hit song.And when you make no more hit songs, nobody cares for you no more!\"As Lenon Honor commented in one of his 'Good Vibrations' interviews:\"You have to sacrifice something if you want the entertainment industry to workon your behalf . . . So there's a trade-off. It's not that any particular artistis special, because there's plenty of other singers and rappers and musicproducers, both currently and in the past if you want to look at ithistorically, who were far more gifted musically than those that 'make it.'That's not the point. The point is; what are you willing to sacrifice, and howfar are you willing to let the industry push you in a certain direction?\" . . . It's not that Kanye, or Jay-Z or Rihanna or anyone else is special. It'sjust that they were willing to sign not only a physical contract, but also anethical contract that says; 'OK, I agree to being manipulated, I agree to beingmoved along a particular course.\"Nothing happens by accident, and the scenario governing the entertainmentindustry applies just as much to the worlds of politics and big business.Politicians and world leaders aren't there just because they worked really hard,stayed focus and had a bit of good luck. The notion that 'anyone can bePresident,' 'any rapper can be the next Jay-Z,' or that your little sister'sbusiness selling home-made lemonade during the Summer could be the newSchweppes, are there to make you believe that the world is a fair and just placewhere each individual is judged on their own merits, and where hard work bringssuccess. Individuals and corporations enjoy fame and mega-fortune becausethey're chosen for it. In some way, each of them is serving the overall agenda.If they weren't, they wouldn't be where they are. Plain and simple. The oldmaxim 'Presidents aren't elected, they're selected' can be applied to the popmusic world too.British researcher and activist Tony Kilvert, otherwise known as Tony Z, droppeda reminder that the same rules that apply to the entertainment game also governthe world of politics, on his 'Good Vibrations' interview in 2014:\"If you understand how the system works, you'll understand that the first thingthey do is to get control of you. They get you by the balls, basically. So theyuse Masons . . . and all sorts of other means to induct you into these dark,Satanic areas, whereby they've got the goods on you. They've got blackmail onyou. And it's only when you get to that level and you agree and you go alongwith it that you'll get in any position of power. It's the same with aristocracyand royalty and all the rest of it. Everybody is a slave to somebody else higherup the chain. And within this system of slavery, they use trickery, bribery,corruption, etc. But it's coming apart at the seams, because it's becoming soobvious to those that are looking at it. It's right there in front of yourface.\"Agreement came from Canadian writer and researcher Henry Makow in my 2015interview with him:\"Now, the people who become successful are the people who essentially agree topromote the Illuminati line in exchange for fame and fortune, in the same waythat politicians agree to promote the line in exchange for political success. Soin a sense they've made a contract. They've sold their soul. It can be comparedto when you join the Masons and you sign an oath that you're never going todivulge the secrets.\"It appears that the industry machine has always selected its favourites – thoseit wishes to elevate to the top of the game to the exclusion of all competitors.As British author John Hamer points out in his book 'The Falsification OfHistory':\"In the early eighteenth century, there is recorded to have been around 8,500composers of music in Europe alone, and yet around 8,400 of them, despite thefact that their music may have been brilliant or innovative, have never hadtheir music extensively published or played, other than in small, localisedconcert halls. And much of it is today now long-forgotten, lost or deliberatelyburied.\"Why should this be?\"Mainly because, as today, the music industry then had its favourites, andcertain personalities including the likes of Mozart, who, whilst feted as acelebrity of his time, probably did not compose much of the music attributed tohim then and since.\"The involvement of occultists in the creation of the ‘superstars’ of their day,such as Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn, cannot be ignored. Indeed, the occultinfluence in music has always been a factor, and today is absolutely rifethroughout the whole of the music industry.\"'EYES WIDE SHUT' AND THEN SOMEThe specifics of exactly what it is that celebrities are required to go throughfor the gift of engineered fame are not for the faint-hearted. The Illuminatiretains positions of power for its own kind, but is not beyond awarding suchperceived fame and fortune to 'outsiders' – those not of a generationalbloodline key to their ongoing plans, but who have shown themselves so hungryfor fame, and devoid of personal morals, that they will literally do anything inexchange for their idea of 'success.' Initiation of this nature is always at thediscretion of the demonic controllers, however – they choose you, you can'tchoose them. Chosen individuals are required to take an oath to The Brotherhood,(the myth about signing a contract in their own blood may not actually be asfar-fetched as it may seem,) to prove their loyalty. It's reasonable to assumethat the controllers harbour nothing but contempt for those who would debasethemselves in this way, such are the levels of humiliation that they mustendure.This is the realm of initiation rituals which mimic the sex magick practices ofAleister Crowley and his followers, where every deviant perversion imaginable isfair game, and no bodily excretion is excluded. It makes the orgy scenes inStanley Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' look like a girl guides' picnic. The ritualsare Satanic in nature, and the summoning-up of entities through dark occultpractices – including sodomy, paedophilia, group sex and bestiality – are saidto be a part of things, as is the occasional human sacrifice. Base sexualactivity rooted in the frequency realm of the lower chakras, are compatible withthe low-density energy zones in which non-human entities are said to reside, andallow for a connection.According to the insights, the higher a star's earnings and the morehigh-profile their persona, the more depraved and degraded the acts they willhave taken part in. Many insiders state that those members of the $20 millionclub and above will have had their morals corrupted beyond belief. The series ofYoutube videos from Black Child Productions listed in the Resources section atthe end of this chapter, come highly recommended for more on this whole area.Only for the headstrong.Public Enemy's Professor Griff has had much to say on such initiations. One hehas described is based on the ritual said to be employed within the Skull &Bones fraternity at Yale University which was attended by, among others, GeorgeHW and George W Bush, and Senator John Kerry. Reportedly, this involves theinitiate lying naked in a coffin and masturbating while recounting their sexualhistory, while his peers look on. There is one particularly high-profileproducer and artist within the hip-hop genre who Griff claims has undergone thisprocess in exchange for his colossal engineered 'success.'One of the most vocal celebrities to have exposed these practices in recenttimes, has been the American comedian, screenwriter, producer and actor DaveChappelle. There are many videos to be found on Youtube of his variousinterviews on the subject. Chappelle had been highly successful on the US TVcircuit, hosting three seasons of his own 'Chappelle's Show' on the ComedyCentral network.Like all A-listers, he reached a point where it was spelt out to him that thenext level of success came with certain requirements. To his great credit,unlike so many of his peers, he was so shocked and disgusted by what he hadfound out that he wanted no part in it, and was prepared to abandon his careerin order to escape. Chappelle famously took off to Africa for an extendedperiod, during which the mainstream media attempted to demonise him as havinggone 'a bit crazy' – a standard tactic with those that don't play ball.Chappelle has since given many interviews explaining his experience, anddocumenting the sick activities that go on beneath the glitzy surface ofHollywood and its music industry equivalent.In an interview with Oprah Winfrey upon his return from Africa, Chappelle raisedthe issue of the sheer number of black male celebrities who had been forced tocross-dress in order to further their careers – another aspect of the agenda tospecifically humiliate and degrade black people as discussed in our earlierchapter. You can view that interview here: * https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=gHhxnIEsSlw [https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=gHhxnIEsSlw]A fellow comedian to have undergone a similar wake-up call, and to have had thecourage to speak out about it, is Katt Williams. In recent years, Williams hasundergone financial problems, a string of altercations with law enforcement, andhas been portrayed as mentally unstable by the mainstream media – all strongindicators that you might have said something that somebody higher-up would havepreferred you hadn't. In an interview on the subject, Williams commented:\"Some of us are against the Illuminati, and we're against it at our owndetriment. When people are against the Illuminati then they get punched in theface all the time, the press hates them, and nobody likes them.\"Dave Chappelle has never been a part of the Illuminati. They don't want him orme or people like us. But now, it's not necessary for us to stir up thathornet's nest unless we intend to get stung a million times. I didn't understandthat. They had to sting me a million times. I'm still not going to join. But Irespect it a little more.\"A series of Youtube videos documenting the nature of 'elite' rituals andinitiation ceremonies has come from the US researcher Yash Qaraah. Several ofhis videos feature the voice of an anonymous industry insider, who claims to beblowing the whistle on what goes on. The following are extracts from his variousinsights:\"Just because it's looking good and they look like they're glamorous, it's notlike that. This shit is all about rituals, demons, Babylonian Gods, and screwinga man in his ass. Particularly in the music industry. They start taking you onthese crazy party trips . . . 'Gravy' is a Hollywood slogan for someone who justgot popped in their behind! 'Oh, so how's it all going? How's your careergoing?' 'Oh, I can tell you right now, baby, everything's gravy.'\" . . . and what they do, they video-tape that shit. Why would they want tovideo-tape it? To sell it later? Nah. To keep your mouth closed . . . Now a lotof times, what they'll do while they're doing this thing to you, the men won'tbe recognisable. They have either a mask on, or they just have their faceblacked out. Why do you think they do it? They put that shit in a special indexbox. Because if you get out of line, they're going to say that you were ahomosexual, you were a paedophile, you did things but never got caught, andthey're going to put this crazy-ass video out of you getting boned by men upyour ass . . . And they do the women worse than the men.\"You know why they're so bold with the truth? Because they know the majority ofpeople in society are so dumbfounded and so beat down on these jobs, thatthey'll take anything. And they do not have your best intentions . . . they haveto keep negativity, negative energy to make money. If everybody's happy, they'regoing to start thinking. And when people start thinking, then people startasking questions. And when they start asking questions, the questions can't beanswered. Now you got a society of people waking up. And they can't have that.\"Nobody need think the hip-hop game is any different to the situation withHollywood movies, television, or any other part of the music industry either,this apparent whistle-blower adds, also shedding some light on hip-hop'spenchant for 'industry friends' and large entourages.\"98 per cent of hip-hop is gay. There's no other way to say it. 98 per cent ofthem are gay. Two per cent of them got out. That's not many, because themajority of them love that lifestyle. All actors and actresses sleep with thesame sex for roles, contracts, commercials, sitcoms, and that's the truth. Theindustry does nothing for free, y'all.\"Once you're in, they prefer you not to hang around anyone you know. Why?Because people that's not in the industry can see BS. They can see demonicthings happening. They don't want you around folks like that because they caninfluence you to get out, or not participate. So usually, they pick yourgirlfriend, they pick your boyfriend. So when you get ready to date somebody,they prefer you to date somebody in the industry because they're wicked, andthey got to keep you wicked.\"Anyone still want to be rich and famous? Is it any wonder that artists such asTupac, Michael Jackson, Elvis and Jim Morrison are rumoured to have faked theirown deaths to escape the clutches of the industry? It becomes clear that onceyou sign on the dotted line, you're in for the rest of your days. You're doingwhat they say now and there's no way out.BIRDS OF A FEATHERIt turns out that a sordid personal history full of grubby little secrets is thebasis on which many politicians are promoted, because it offers the realcontrollers pulling their strings the capacity for blackmail or humiliatingpublic exposure should their lackeys fail to perform their duties on-script.It's been working this way for a very long time, and is a strategy employed inmost countries around the world. There is evidence to suggest that it's nodifferent with certain key artists in the music scene, too, whose personalbackgrounds may be rather different from the public image they've carefullycultivated.Another reason for dark energy just happening to permeate the upper levels ofthe music industry, is again down to the true nature of the energetic field inwhich we all live. Like attracts like, and artists existing in a very negativestate of low consciousness, will attract more low-density energy into theirexistence. Heavy drug use, sexual depravity, and dabblings in the dark occulthave never been conducive towards positive life experiences in the long run.Additionally – as is the case in so many other areas – a significant number ofmusicians appear to have been groomed for fame on the basis of their ancestry.The fact that royalty and aristocracy breed within their own circle, usuallymarrying cousins, is acknowledged even in the mainstream. But this is also thecase with 'celebrities,' whose bloodlines can be traced back many, manygenerations. How many realise, for example, that Madonna, Alanis Morisette,Celine Dion and Angelina Jolie are genetically linked to Hillary Clinton? Orthat Britney Spears is related to Laura Bush and Senator John McCain? This haseven been admitted to in the mainstream media. As a UK 'Daily Mail' articlenaively put it:\"Researchers at the New England Historic Genealogical Society found someremarkable family connections for the three presidential candidates.\"I'll bet they bloody have. For some reason these particular lineages are deemedimportant, with very precise records kept of where in the world the descendantsare located, so that new generations can be recruited and put to work inprominent public positions by the elites. It's no accident that Brad Pitt andAngelina Jolie ended up together, for instance, as they're reported to berelated as 21st cousins. It was always part of the plan for them to become acouple, presumably, with Billy Bob Thornton and Jennifer Aniston having beentemporary distractions. Pitt, according to research, is related to Barack Obama,as is George W Bush, and Pitt is also the ninth cousin twice-removed of theoutlaw Jesse James, and the twelfth cousin of both Prince William and the moviedirector Spike Lee. This would explain why Pitt gets so many Hollywood roles,and why Jolie has been given her extra-curricular job as a United Nationsambassador/ Eugenicist. Cherie Blair, wife of the war criminal Tony Blair, issaid to be a descendent of John Wilkes-Booth, the man accused of assassinatingUS president Abraham Lincoln. Woody Harrelson's father, Charles, was accused bya lawyer of being a contract killer who murdered his brother. The researcherFreeman added to this by claiming Harrelson was one of the three 'tramps'detained after the JFK assassination, and had been directly involved in theshooting! (In a neat piece of art imitating life, Woody himself portrayed aserial murderer in the movie 'Natural Born Killers.')The bloodline plot makes sense of the otherwise overwhelming 'coincidence' thatBritish Prime Minister David Cameron just happens to be a cousin of the Queen ofEngland, who herself, just happens to be a distant descendant of Vlad Dracul,aka Vlad The Impaler of Transylvania, and inspiration for the 'Dracula' stories.Cameron also just happens to be a cousin of London Mayor Boris Johnson, (and issaid to be distantly related to Kim Kardashian; now you know why she'sfamous-for-being-famous and never off TV or out of the gossip magazines!)Cameron, Johnson and UK chancellor George Osborne were all part of theBullingdon Boys' Club at Oxford University in the same year, a fraternity thatemploys its own sick and perverted rituals according to recent headlines. TheUni also counted Osama Bin Laden and Bill Clinton in its ranks in previousyears.In a neat piece of segueing that brings us full circle, meanwhile, it's alsowidely suggested that war criminal George W Bush's mother, Barbara, wife ofGeorge Bush Senior, is in fact the illegitimate daughter of Aleister Crowley.There's certainly a family resemblance when you compare photos. (Bush Junior'sfarcical appointment as President of the United States demonstrates thebloodline agenda perfectly. Does anyone on the planet truly believe that heearned the role through being the best man for the job, and that the appointmenthad absolutely nothing to do with who his Daddy was? Really?)In this regard, an interesting movie to absorb is 'Six Degrees Of Separation',released in 1993 and starring Will Smith. The film's narrative examines thetheory that anyone in the world is no more than six steps away from any otherindividual in terms of familial or social connections. Smith's character claimsto be the son of Hollywood actor Sidney Poitier, but is revealed later to be aconfidence trickster. This plotline, (heavy on homosexuality,) is particularlyintriguing given that Smith is often cited as being descended from along-running bloodline of particular interest to the Illuminati, which is howhis relationship with Jada Pinkett came about, and why his son Jaden anddaughter Willow have also been pushed into the celebrity limelight.As Max Spiers, a whistle-blower from a long-running bloodline of interest to theIlluminati commented in an interview on Miles Johnston's 'Bases Project:'\"With a lot of these high-level Kabbalistic celebrities . . . There are lists atthe highest levels, and they know where all the bloodlines have migrated to fromthe beginning. They know where they're all at. If you're connected to abloodline, you're being tracked. Project Oaktree was all about that, trackingbloodlines from the 1950s onward.(It's also said that this is what the National Health Service in Britain waspartly set up to do.)None of these people achieve their positions by accident, or even by merit ofwhatever talent they have. They're there because they've been placed there.EXTRA-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIESThe industry controllers clearly see their artists as owned possessions, to bedeployed in any way that suits. Celebrities are treated by their industryoverlords in the same way that members of the military are treated by theirsuperiors. The same assumed ownership would also appear to apply to theiroffspring, which is why so many musicians turn out to have fathers who wereemployed in military intelligence, as we've already discovered.The idea that no-one ever really leaves the military is well-known, and how manytimes have you watched a film where a grizzled old former Marine orsecret-service operative is supposed to have been retired but gets commissionedfor 'one more job,' complaining, 'just when I thought I was out, they pull meback in.' Military personnel are regarded as owned pets. They're often used asunwitting test subjects in biological experiments, it's a condition of theiremployment that they take certain vaccines, and plans are in place formicrochipping to be mandatory before long. There are parallels in theentertainment world, too, which is why A-list celebrities rarely get to retire.Hollywood actors and musicians continue to work into their 70s and 80s when theywould have earned enough money to have retired decades earlier. They'refulfilling their lifetime commitment to the hand that has fed them. Bob Dylanalluded to this in the now-infamous '60 Minutes' interview with Ed Bradley whenhe was asked what the key to his longevity had been. Dylan replied: \"I made abargain with . . . \" (at this point Dylan pauses before resuming) \" . . . a longtime ago and I'm holding up my end.\" Bradley asks, \"what was your bargain?\"Dylan replies, \"to get where I am now.\" He adds that he made the bargain with\"the chief commander . . . of this earth and then the world we can't see.\"Besides puppeteering them as required within their respective fields – whetherthat's as an actor, television presenter, musician, model or sports star –'celebs' are often called on for sideline assignments that serve the wideragenda in some way, too.In 2015, by that point a pathetic caricature of his former 'gangster' self,making records with the likes of Katy Perry and TV commercials forMoneysupermarket.com [http://Moneysupermarket.com], Snoop Dogg appeared on a TVinterview endorsing Hillary Clinton in her bid for the 2016 US presidency! Hestated: “I would love to see a woman in office, because I feel like we’re atthat stage in life to where we need perspective other than the males’ train ofthought.” Some of Snoop's previous tracks have included 'Bitches Ain't Shit,''For All My Niggaz & Bitches,' and 'Gz Up Hoes Down,' so maybe he's right? Heused an interesting turn of phrase for a separate 2015 interview with Sky News,stating: “I am more sensitive and more vulnerable writing-wise, and accepting awoman for being a beautiful person, as opposed to me saying she is a bitch or awhore, because that was how I was trained when I first started . . . \" At thestart of his career, such an idea would have been laughable, but the slow-dripeffect over time that is so skilfully employed, gets a celebrity so familiarwithin the public's mind-set, that they can later be used to steer people inwhatever direction has been laid out for them.In the wake of his smash hit 'Happy,' Pharrell Williams got in on the act withthe United Nations, announcing a 'Happy Party,' designed to get 'the whole worlddancing for a happy planet' – a loosely-coded reference to the plans for a OneWorld Government, gaining familiarity for the idea by making it 'fun' and'cool.'In late 2015, actor Ewan McGregor was wheeled out – not for the first time – tofront a TV appeal imploring the public to give money to help Syrian childrenaffected by airstrikes being conducted there by Western governments. This wasafter the same general public's tax money had already been used to help fund themassacres in the first place, of course. I wonder how much the Queen givespersonally to such appeals?British TV chef Jamie Oliver, who had previously claimed to be all about organicfood, gave a hint as to his true colours in early 2015 when he publicly voicedhis support for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, saying he was'super-excited' to be working with them, and talking about the need for 'a newfood system.' Could be have been alluding to Genetically Modified Crops of thetype peddled by Monsanto, which the Gates' are pushing as part of the UN'sAgenda 21 plans? Does anybody believe that these multi-millionaires genuinelygive a shit about regular people when they announce 'campaigns' such as this?How much of their fortunes do any of them personally give to the causes theyclaim to be passionate about?Gates himself has been a key figure in the Eugenics movement and the drivetowards massive world depopulation. In a 2003 interview with PBS' Bill Moyers,he admitted that his father, William H. Gates Sr., had been head of the PlannedParenthood organisation which had evolved out of the American Eugenics Society.Its founder, Mary Sanger, had publicly declared immigrants and poor people as\"human weeds,\" \"reckless breeders,\" and \"spawning . . . human beings who nevershould have been born.\"What if, coming from such a strategic bloodline, this was always the route thatGates was pre-determined to go down, and the Microsoft empire was gifted to himby much higher powers simply to get him famous, rather than being his ownpersonal invention? (And on that note, does anyone really believe dorky collegekid Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook in his Harvard dorm?! That one pales evenfurther into farce in the light of recent claims that Zuckerberg is actually thegrandson of David Rockefeller.)In 2013, an unbelievable TV commercial emerged for the Toilet Strike fresh waterproject, which was headlined by Hollywood actor Matt Damon, (though it wasalmost certainly not his own concept but one which he had been instructed tobecome the public face for.) As part of this, a ragtag bunch of control-systemassets consisting of Sir (say no more) Richard Branson, actress Olivia Wilde,and New World Order bagman Bono appeared on-screen, laughing, joking andgenerally taking the piss by making constant references to 'the Illuminati.' \"Iremember when Matt first brought up the idea. It was at a meeting of theIlluminati\", says Bono. \"Oi, Damon! Who let you into our secret Illuminatimeeting?\" mocks Olivia Wilde. \"Illuminati, assemble!\" adds Branson. Sohilarious. Bono adds: \"because this is one conspiracy we can all agree on.\" (Ican never hear Bono's name without thinking of a comment an Irish rapper friendof mine once said. I warned him that an article I was publishing did not paintBono in a favourable light. \"Ah, don't worry,\" he said. \"Everyone in Irelandknows Bono's a cunt.\")The aim was obviously to address the rumours of celebrity involvement bylaughing it off, conveying to the general public how ridiculous the claims are,and making those who continue to push them look a little foolish. For those witheyes to see, a mind to think, and the capacity to do independent research,however, the motives were obvious, and it was these three owned stooges wholooked more than a little sad and pathetic. The Toilet Strike project is alsoconnected to Agenda 21 which, in turn, ties into the elites' long-held plans formassive human population reduction, (see the Georgia Guidestones.) Bono and hismates were merely providing a friendly public face for a very sinister agenda.Along the same lines as the aforementioned ad., is the websiteilluminatiofficial.org [http://illuminatiofficial.org], (apparentlyilluminati.com [http://illuminati.com] was already taken,) which purports to bethe official site for that particular organisation, and includes such helpfultools as a guide to deciphering its commonly-used symbols, a link through totheir Facebook and Twitter, and a section titled 'Join the Illuminati,' whereyou can leave your e-mail address and sign up for regular newsletters andupdates. I wonder if they do Snapchat too?There are further connections between Agenda 21 and the myth of 'globalwarming,' which has now had to be re-named 'climate change' in the face of somuch scientific evidence to the contrary. In a desperate attempt to still sellthe notion that we everyday humans are to blame for the earth warming up,'Blackadder' co-writer and 'Four Weddings And A Funeral' director RichardCurtis, was called on to produce a TV commercial for a project known as 10:10 in2011. Imagine, one minute you're a producer of 'feel-good' comedy films in whichposh people hilariously say 'fuck' a lot. The next, you're called on to direct apiece of One World Government propaganda. Never a dull moment, eh? This oneseriously backfired when it produced the large-scale outrage it always shouldhave done. The ad. shows children in classrooms being asked what they are doingto help combat 'global warming.' When any children decline to commit, theteacher is seen pressing a button causing them to explode in a mass of blood andgore. The basic message, therefore, is: 'buy into the official lie about globalwarming, or you deserve to be murdered.' It remains utterly unfathomable howthis could ever have been deemed an acceptable stance, and how the mentally-illindividuals behind it ever thought they'd be able to pull it off.In Summer 2014, it was all about the Ice Bucket Challenge, where millionsworldwide poured buckets of icy water over their heads and posted the video onYoutube before nominating two others to do it, just because a bunch of pointlesscelebrities had been deployed to do the same. The stunt was supposedly in aid ofraising awareness for ALS, aka Lou Gehrig's Disease, but many members of thepublic showed themselves to be clueless as to this factor, the idea of emulatinga beloved superstar being far more of a motivating factor. The jury's still outon what the real reason was for deploying these celebrity pets in such a way,but there were theories concerning the ritual symbology of immersion in water assome kind of 'cleansing.' It's interesting to reflect that the controllers hatchplans such as this every now and again, just to test the degree of mind-controland celebrity worship that the general population is under, and to gauge howready they would be to adopt a particular stance just because it comes with acelebrity endorsement. The 'Kony 2012' video which went viral on the internet inthat year, (and was shown later to be an orchestrated hoax,) showed just howreadily something could be communicated around the world if it comes with an airof fashionability and a Twitter hashtag attached. The same happened whenmillions changed their Facebook profile picture to a French flag following theParis 'terror attacks' of November 2015.In the same year, the Smart Meter agenda got a new public face to endorse it inthe form of Sir (could he have been anything else?) Bob Geldof. Much scrutinyamong truthseeking researchers has gone towards the true nature of the Band Aidand Live Aid projects that Geldof helmed. Curiosity has been raised about manywell-known charities, and the fact that the bulk of public donations, made inwell-meaning spirit, actually go towards paying executive salaries and'administration costs,' with only a small fraction being put to use at groundlevel. Addressing the Geldof-helmed Live 8 concerts of 2005, LC Vincent, writingfor henrymakow.com [http://henrymakow.com], observed:\"Most casual observers might assume that the money generated by corporatesponsors, DVD sales, performance royalties, and direct contributions, would befunnelled into various charitable organisations aiding the poorest people ofdeveloping nations around the world. They would be wrong.\" . . . The money was instead used to pay off the corporate creditors ofindebted countries. In effect, the entire focus of the money generated by Live 8was to provide direct assistance to corporations owed money by theseimpoverished nations.A 2010 report from the BBC, no less, alleged that money given by the public tothe Band Aid/ Live Aid projects, was used to buy weapons for rebel groups ratherthan for famine relief. That story resides here –http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2010/03/ethiopia.html[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2010/03/ethiopia.html]In November 2008 it was reported that Geldof was paid $100,000 in Australia fora brief speech addressing Third World Poverty. You couldn't make it up.Geldof is generally thought of as a full-blooded Irishman. In fact, his paternalgrandmother, Amelia Falk, was an English Jew from London, while his paternalgrandfather was an immigrant from Belgium. 'Gelt' is the Yiddish word for money.Geldof achieved his 'honorary knighthood' from the Queen in 1986. In 2011, heaccepted an honorary doctorate from Israel's Ben Gurion University. In contrastto his claims that he came from 'a poor, Irish, not particularly well-educatedbackground,' those who knew him in his youth have stated that he enjoyed aprivileged upbringing in an affluent district of Dun Laoghaire, and that heattended a middle-class private school. One of his early jobs was as aslaughterman in an abattoir. He cares, you know.Geldof’s New World Order activities raise all kinds of interesting questionsabout whether his emerging as the lead singer of The Boomtown Rats was merely away of thrusting him into the public eye, (particularly given that he was suchan appalling singer!) so that later, once his familiarity had been established,he could start doing the real work for which he had been groomed.The same suspicion could be levelled at his aforementioned mate Bono, who hasfollowed a similar path in recent years, hobnobbing with world leaders andendorsing various NWO projects, (and proudly earning a knighthood for servicesrendered in the process.) Bono is certainly more of a convincing singer thanGeldof. Something else becomes interesting here, though. Many of U2's earlysongs had meaningful lyrical content, the likes of 'Sunday Bloody Sunday' and'Pride (In The Name Of Love)' standing as conscious protest songs of their day.Only later down the line did Bono start taking a different path. This is apattern we've seen with many different artists. They start out in what seems tobe a spirit of well-intentioned independence, making songs that carry some sortof message to the people. After winning over fans on this basis, at a strategicpoint, their music begins to conform more to corporate templates, and this oftencoincides with changes in their personal lives where they start to get with theEstablishment programme. Muse are another group that seem to have followed thispath in recent years. Their song 'Uprising' appeared to be a genuineanti-Establishment rant coming from the heart, but pretty soon afterwards, theyshowed signs of having been neutered back into corporate conformity. Singer MattBellamy, who had previously penned a track titled 'MK Ultra', named one of hisalbums 'HAARP', and had spoken critically of the incoming microchip agenda, hadclaimed in a 2006 interview that 9/11 was 'an inside job,' but by 2012, said hehad changed his stance and now accepted the official story. He added: “I stillread about political history, the influence of corporations and the military,but I make sure I’m reading from credible sources. I think my political viewsare a bit more nuanced now.”Along similar lines, Blur and Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn, who had previouslybeen outspoken and critical of the (second) Iraq War, went on to accept an OBEin the Queen's 2016 New Year's 'Honours.' The irony of an opponent ofwars-of-conquest receiving an award from the figurehead of the very regime thathas endlessly perpetuated such events, was not lost on many observers.Red flags, anyone?THE FALL FROM GRACE OF KANYE WESTWhen it comes to the engineered debasement of an artist and their values, therecan be no better example in the contemporary era than that of Kanye West.Studying the nature of his output from his entry point into the industry, towhat he stands for today, offers a masterclass in the corporate music industry'stried-and-tested tactics.Coming out of Chicago, Kanye first emerged as a producer, rising to prominencethrough his work within Jay-Z and Damon Dash's Roc A Fella Records empire. Hisearly productions, (on and off the label,) saw him making beats for artists suchas Memphis Bleek, Beanie Sigel, Ludacris, Rhymefest, The Game, Cam'ron, Twista,Brandy and Keyshia Cole, as well as several for Jay-Z himself.Kanye harboured ambitions to be a rapper himself, and in 2004, his debut artistalbum appeared, entitled 'The College Dropout.' With the degradation of thehip-hop genre that we addressed earlier already in place, this album was viewedas a breath of fresh air by pundits, owing to the sample-based, soulfulproduction on many of the tracks, and lyrical themes pursued, which steered awayfrom the stereotypical subject matter of the time. Tracks included 'JesusWalks,' in which Kanye spoke candidly of his struggle to stay true to Christianvalues in the wake of the temptations that lay all around, 'Through The Wire,'in which he documents the serious car accident that he felt blessed to havesurvived, and 'All Falls Down,' a devastating reflection on materialism insociety. It included the lyrics:\"The prettiest people do the ugliest things, on the road to riches and diamondrings.\"And:\"We shine because they hate us, floss ’cause they degrade us,We trying to buy back our 40 acres, and for that paper,Look how low we stoop,Even if you in a Benz, you still a nigga in a coop”The follow-up project, 'Late Registration,' appeared in 2005. This set wascommended for its more elaborate production and sampling methods, including manystring arrangements in conjunction with instrumentalist Jon Brion, giving thealbum a texture not normally associated with hip-hop product. Themes exploredincluded the blood diamond trade, the superficiality of society, the effects ofcrack cocaine on black communities, and the expression of love and appreciationto his mother Donda on 'Hey Mama.' It seemed as if the scene had a talented,thoughtful and creative new voice, doubling as a skilful producer, to representthe more meaningful side of the artform.It was all about to go very, very wrong.Kanye had become known for his philanthropic work outside of his music, and inSeptember 2005, appeared live on a US telethon in the wake of the HurricaneKatrina disaster that had devastated the city of New Orleans, and drawncriticism of the Bush Administration over its poor efforts in organising relief.Kanye was on-screen with 'Austin Powers' actor Mike Myers, and both were readingfrom prepared scripts. At one point, however, Kanye improvised and dropped thespontaneous phrase, 'George Bush doesn't care about black people' live ontelevision. As Myers stood shocked, the producers cut quickly away from thescene.It's always struck me that this incident stood as a turning point in Kanye'scareer, since from that moment forwardthe moral standards in his lyrics began to deteriorate, regressing further withevery passing year. At the same time, his music and production styles becamegradually darker, reaching an all-time low with the '808s & Heartbreak' albumdiscussed in the earlier chapter on Transhumanism. Clearly, his off-scriptcomment criticising Bush wouldn't have gone down well with the music industry'sultimate controllers, and you have to wonder whether this was chosen as thepoint to start debasing his output, as a form of 'punishment' for exercising hismaverick spirit. It's either this, or that the timing was coincidental, and theblueprint was already in place for the subsequent years.An artist that had started out lamenting the obsession with fashion brands on'All Falls Down,' had joined every other A-list rapper in worshipping those verybrands and lifestyle habits. Things had hit rock-bottom by the time of Kanye'scollaboration with label-mate and mentor Jay-Z on their duet 'Niggas In Paris':\"What's Gucci, my nigga?What's Louis, my killa?What's drugs, my deala?What's that jacket, Margiela?\"On 'Clique:'\"Break records at Louis,Ate breakfast at Gucci.\"On 'Power:'\"My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in,I embody every characteristic of the egotistic.\"In his guest verse on Keri Hilson's 'Knock You Down:'\"Keep rockin', and keep knockin'Whether you Louis Vuitton-ed up or Reebok-in\"And on the remix of Rihanna's 'Diamonds:'\"The Delorean parked in front of Armani Emporium,And parties at Richie is getting risky,Victoria's Secret show, they miss me.\"As if to puzzle and confuse, Kanye has come with the occasional meaningful andreflective lyrics in the midst of all the retarded garbage, such as on 'NewSlaves' from 2013's 'Yeezus.' On this, he was back to addressing societalslavery and subjugation of blacks, and sharply criticising the very materialobsessions he had embraced on his other recordings:\"My momma was raised in the era when,Clean water was only served to the fairer skin,Doin' clothes, you would have thought I had help,But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself,You see it's broke nigga racism,That's that \"Don't touch anything in the store,\"And it's rich nigga racism,That's that \"Come in, please buy more,\"\"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?All you blacks want all the same things.\"It gave the impression that there was still an element of humanity andconscience within his being, and that, for whatever reason, he'd been allowed toexpress it in this one solitary instance. All around it on 'Yeezus,' however,was the usual depraved toxicity that had become his trademark. Kanye's tendencytowards ego and arrogance in interviews, plus his constant appearance inpointless celebrity gossip magazines – particularly since his engagement tofamous-for-being-famous Kim Kardashian – earned him as many detractors andcritics as it did fans. Either way, it's tragic for those that have followed hiscareer from the beginning, to have seen him become just another manipulatedasset of the corporate machine, dancing to whatever tune his higher-ups havedictated, with almost all of his conscientious creative talents having beendumbed down beyond hope.It's also worth reflecting on Kanye's behaviours of recent times in this regard.He has famously been branded as 'difficult' in interviews, and this hasgenerally been put down to the eccentric nature of an individualistic artist.But behaviours such as lying down on the floor and refusing to answer anyinterview questions, as he did following a performance on the 'Jonathan RossShow' on the UK's ITV, hint at other possibilities, as anyone who read theearlier chapter on mind-control will doubtless recognise.THE FIASCO OF LUPEThere are echoes of Kanye's fall from grace in the story of another contemporaryUS rapper. Lupe Fiasco is a name who has generally steered clear of hip-hop'sA-list set. It's a safe bet that many young kids raised on a diet of moreheavily-marketed names such as Jay-Z, Lil' Wayne and Rick Ross won't even haveheard of him.For a while, Lupe stood as that rarest of entities – a rapper with a mainstreamdeal, (Atlantic Records,) who went against the grain, and unlike his mainstreampeers, actually maintained some integrity and resisted chatting about the sametired, vacuous subject matter. By the time of 2010's long-awaited 'Lasers'album, he had raised the bar by several notches. The obvious example was itsfirst single, 'Words I Never Said.' The homogenised electronic production andgrating Skylar Grey hook was unfortunate, but it was the lyrics that packed asobering punch. Who else in mainstream music was making statements like, \"GazaStrip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit?,\" \"9/11, Building 7, did theyreally pull it?,\" and, \"I really think the silence is worse than all theviolence, fear is such a weak emotion, that's why I despise it?\" This stuff wasthe closest that the contemporary mainstream had got to the likes of Marvin Gayeon 'What's Going On' or Prince on 'Sign O' The Times,' and there was moreanti-establishment rhetoric with the likes of 'State Run Radio,' 'I Don't WannaCare Right Now' and 'Out Of My Head.'You have to wonder whether 'Words I Never Said' was one that accidentallyslipped through the net, or whether it was deliberately allowed to be put out aspart of an agenda that was already in store for Lupe. It's hard to imagine hissuperiors at Atlantic, who would have had to have approved the album inlistening sessions before releasing it, just happening to miss a line like theone on Obama and Gaza. Is it possible he could have been 'allowed' to make astatement like this, only to be seen to atone for it shortly afterwards as a wayof the industry effectively saying, 'see what happens when artists try toexpress themselves?'Things were kind of patchy in the years following 'Lasers.' Tracks like'Lamborghini Angels' raised some intriguing, if slightly off-kilter subjectmatter, but lacked energetic punch. Other outings were confusing at best, blandand weak at worst. But in early 2014 came the crunch, with Lupe dropping thetoxic Satanic bile 'Thorns And Horns'. And so the alarm bells rang. You cancheck out the track on the link below: * https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=f0Vxw0ou_dQ [https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=f0Vxw0ou_dQ]What is clear is that Lupe's music of then and now cannot be perceived as anykind of artistic 'development.' The output smacks of two completely differentartists, and not one on a path of musical progression. A pattern is emerging.REGRESSION: THE NEW PROGRESSIONThe tactic employed with Kanye West – to start an artist off with a particularimage to gain a fanbase, then at a selected point to send them suddenly off in adifferent direction – is one that has been rolled out frequently in the pastdecade or more. In the face of her overtly sexual and aggressive image andlyrics espousing the usual – sex, materialism, partying, etc – it's easy toforget that Rihanna's entry on to the scene back in 2006 was marked by hersingle 'If It's Loving That You Want,' a bright and breezy piece ofCaribbean-flavoured pop from an album that offered more of the same, 'Island InThe Sun.' Similarly, Beyonce was first presented to the world as part of theteen group Destiny's Child, largely addressing standard relationship issuesbefore being sent down a similar path to Rihanna.These two and their contemporaries represent the strategy now routinely employedwith A-list pop stars. They start out as respectable, with family-friendlyimages and singing innocent pop songs, building a international fanbase ofchildren in the process, and putting potentially vigilant parents off theirguard. A year or two down the line, however, the switch occurs, and the star inquestion ditches the wholesome image in favour of an adult-orientated, sexuallyexplicit one more suited to soft porn or strip-club shows, than to a fan-base ofchildren. Because an affection for the artist has already been established, thefans that have grown to adore them naturally follow any direction they is seento take, and mimic the behaviours they see. We saw it with Britney Spears,Christina Aguilera, Katy Perry, Taylor Swift, and, most controversially of all,with Miley Cyrus.There's a time and a place for most things in life, and pornography is noexception. I would just suggest that pop videos and stage shows lapped up by theunder-tens are not among those times and places, and I suspect 99 per cent ofparents of children of that age would be with me on that one.THE MISREPRESENTATION OF LAURYN HILLIt would seem the overwhelming majority of celebrities either end up embracingdepraved lifestyle habits, or put up with them for fear of losing their careers,or worse. Occasionally, however, certain high-profile individuals do break theranks and come forward to expose what they've been a part of. What happens tothese people? Often there seems to be a reliance on such stories sounding sooutlandish to the general public that they're simply written off as being'impossible.' In other cases, however, the controllers have ways of picking-offindividuals and completely trashing their careers, whilst attempting todiscredit them in the eyes of the public. Dave Chappelle and Katt Williams havecertainly fallen foul of the industry controllers. Attempts have been made tosmear Chappelle as something of a loose cannon and a crackhead, while Williamshas been arrested and harassed by the police on assorted claims several timessince becoming outspoken. The rapper DMX, who showed signs of trying to breakaway from his corporate stranglehold a few years ago and dropped a devastatingtrack called 'Industry,' has similarly been in and out of jail on variouscharges. Coincidence?There's another artist whose life story over the past 15-plus years providessome of the answers, too.Lauryn Hill was formerly known as L-Boogie, the extremely talented singer/rapper member of the chart-topping Fugees in the mid-90s. After the group'sshort-lived heyday, she broke out with her highly-lauded solo album 'TheMiseducation of Lauryn Hill' in 1998. It included several remarkable lyricaloutings, such as on 'Everything Is Everything:'\"I wrote these words for everyone,Who struggles in their youth,Who won't accept deception,Instead of what is truth,It seems we lose the game,Before we even start to play,Who made these rules? We're so confused,Easily led astray.\"And on 'The Lost Ones' came an encapsulation of the eternal truth of UniversalLaw:\"Now don't you understand, man, Universal Law?What you throw out comes back to you, star,Never underestimate those who you scar,Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!\"All seemed to be going well, and the hip-hop scene had a high-profile, consciousartist expressing great truths through message music. Soon afterwards, however,Lauryn faded from the limelight in a period of what appeared to be self-imposedexile. She hinted at this with comments in later interviews, such as:\"For two or three years I was away from all social interaction. It was a veryintrospective time because I had to confront my fears and master every demonicthought about inferiority, about insecurity or the fear of being black, youngand gifted in this Western culture.\"No further music was being released, and the gossip rags started running storiesabout her going off the rails, acting erratically and being addicted to assortedsubstances. On the industry grapevine, meanwhile, came stories of Lauryndesperately trying to escape the grip of the Sony Corporation, through whichboth the Fugees' and her own solo material had been released. The rumoursimplied that she'd become disillusioned with the sinister, mind-controllingaspects of The Industry, and that she was keen to break free as it was affectingher sanity. Allegations of racist comments emerged, which in retrospect, wouldappear to be a standard tactic in character-smearing by an industry that doesn'tlike renegades trying to go their own way. Lauryn articulated the wholeexperience with the excellent acoustic track 'I Get Out,' with lyrics such as:\"No more compromises,I see past your disguises,Blindin' me through mind-control,Stealin' my eternal soul,Appealin' through material,To keep me as your slave.\"You can hear her live performance of the song here: * https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=28rNFm2ZtLE [https://www.Youtube.com/watch?v=28rNFm2ZtLE]Sadly, it seems there's a price to pay for an artist that a corporation likeSony considers its owned property, putting out a song such as this. Sure enough,in 2012, the story emerged that Lauryn was being pursued by the IRS for a totalof $968,000 in unpaid taxes, in an affair which smacks of being an orchestratedset-up. In her apparent defence, she mentioned that she had received deaththreats to herself and her family, (although it's difficult to see why thiswould have any connection with her failing to pay her taxes.) The tabloidsreported that Lauryn could be facing a long prison term if she was unable to payoff her debts by the given deadline. In the event, she served three months in2013. A solution then emerged; to pay her debts, she was set to sign a brand newmillion-dollar recording deal with Sony, the very corporation she'd spent theprevious 15 years trying to escape!ROBIN THICKE: NEW RECRUITA more recent example of an artist who started out with musical integrity, buthas been degraded into yet another corporate marionette, comes with the recenthistory of Robin Thicke. The same blueprint and tried-and-tested formula can beseen as with so many of his contemporaries.Robin's father, Alan Thicke, was himself an entertainer. He is best known as aUS quiz and talk show host, and as an actor. His mother, Gloria Loring, was alsoa singer and actress, and his maternal grandparents were a singer andtrumpet-player respectively. Robin was therefore well-groomed for a showbizcareer himself. Appropriately, his brother Brennan also became an actor, andRobin went on to marry the actress Paula Patton.Robin's own success seemed to be a long time coming. I interviewed him for'Blues & Soul' magazine in 2007 at the time of his album 'The Evolution Of RobinThicke.' He explained then how he had already been in the business for 14 yearstrying to make it. He had been mentored early on by the R&B singer BrianMcKnight, who had introduced him to Interscope Records supremo Jimmy Iovine.Thicke's 2002 album, known alternately as ‘Cherry Blue Skies’ and ‘BeautifulWorld,’ had been a critical success among his peers, attracting the attention ofPharrell Williams, who subsequently produced him on the track 'Wanna Love YouGirl' and signed him to his Star Trak label, but it had flopped commercially. Attimes, Thicke's lack of success had brought severe bouts of depression. “So Iwas borderline suicidal,\" he commented. \"I was drinking for breakfast, and theonly thing that kept me going was that piano in my house. I’d go over to it andwrite every day.\"Thicke's real breakthrough came with the 'Evolution' album, which showcased hisdistinctive and classy soulful style, heavy on the falsetto, and drawing onretro black music influences. “Producing the ‘Evolution’ album was a highlytherapeutic experience,\" he said. \"Even up to writing the last few songs, it wasall a part of still helping me to believe in myself. Everyone had pretty muchwritten me off and given up on me for the tenth time.\"His comments certainly imply a frustrated artist ready to do whatever it takesto emulate the success of his father. Wikipedia's entry on Robin observes:\"Thicke has noted that while his parents did not attempt to dissuade him fromhis desire to be in the music industry, their own experience with the nature ofthe entertainment business made them leery in the beginning.\"Things continued along the same musical path with the albums 'Something Else,''Sex Therapy' and 'Love After War.' As previously noted, with artists whoseentire personas switch, it's possible to pinpoint the moment where this upgradeis being announced to the watching public. We can only speculate on what hasoccurred behind the scenes, but an informed guess would be that the artist inquestion, allowed to go their own path for a while, has shown themselves to besomeone that could be of use in the controllers' ongoing agenda, and they'vebeen either invited or coerced into accessing new levels of success. Inevitably,the fast-tracking comes with its own price to pay. You're doing what they tellyou now.With Robin Thicke, a symbolic announcement to the world that he had beenrecruited as one of the Industry's chosen ones, came with his guest appearancealongside Miley Cyrus at the 2013 MTV VMA Awards. This event was announcingMiley Cyrus' new slutty makeover, as the audience saw the former Hannah Montanastar in porn=star mode, 'twerking' and flicking her tongue, as Thicke emerged ina black-and-white striped suit and began to grind against her to his song'Blurred Lines.' Cyrus said in a later interview that Thicke was very muchinvolved in the planning of the performance, and 'wanted me as naked aspossible,' even helping choose her rubber outfit.The performance attracted the scrutiny of 'Vigilant Citizen' who, in a thoroughdissection, stated that the design of Thicke's suit, besides evoking theblack-and-white/ dark-and-light/ good-and-evil imagery alluded to inFreemasonry, was also a mind-control programming trigger. This, VC observed,gave the impression of Thicke and Cyrus's relationship as that of a mind-controlsubject and her handler:\"Things got even stranger when Robin Thicke came out to perform 'Blurred Lines.'As its name somewhat stipulates, that song blurs the line between being flirtyand all-out creepy. Its video has a strange handler-slave vibe, where Robin,Pharrell and T.I. are all sharply dressed, while the women dancing around themare completely naked . . . and being sung lines such as “you’re an animal.”\" . . . Forcing slaves to be naked while the masters are dressed is a classicpsychological ploy to make slaves feel powerless, vulnerable and inferior.\"'Blurred Lines' marked the end of Thicke's previous mellow, soulful style,casting him in new light as a sleazy kind of pimp. The lewdness of the imagerywas further enhanced by the flashing of the slogan 'Robin Thicke's got a bigdick,' (thanks for the information,) on a balloon, and the lyric \"you wanna hugme . . . what rhymes with hug me?\" in a video frequently aired on shows watchedby children. The sexualisation of ever-earlier age groups continues on.Shortly after the VMA performance, Thicke's marriage to actress Paula Pattoncame to an end amidst claims of his infidelity. He was reported as being in anew relationship with 20-year-old April Love Geary, 16 years his junior.VC was back on the case with Thicke's follow-up song and video, 'Get Her Back,'observing:\"Get Her Back' appears to be about Robin Thicke trying to win his wife back bybeing nice and apologetic. However, when one adds the imagery of the video intothe mix, it becomes a creepy, disturbing tale of a stalker with violent andsuicidal tendencies pathetically harassing an ex-lover . . . all laced withone-eyed Illuminati symbolism, of course.\"Having cited soulful greats such as Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and SmokeyRobinson as his influences, by 2015, Thicke had begun collaborating with garbagepop artists like Flo Rida and Nicki Minaj, (who had previously guested onanother Thicke song, 'Shake It For Daddy.' No comment.) The signs that somethinghad happened to Robin Thicke, going way beyond what could be written off as anartist's 'natural progression,' could not be more blatant.THE STRANGE ENIGMA OF JAY ELECTRONICAWhen resolving to discover the true nature of an artist and what motivates theiractions, there are few examples full of more apparent contradictions andparadoxes than the case of Jay Electronica. His very persona has an air ofunexplained mystery about it, and those who have met him have talked of amagnetic aura that seems to draw in those around him.Born Timothy Thedford in New Orleans in 1976, official lore has it that he grewup in the city's Magnolia Projects, and that his early life was the ghettostruggle that is the case with the majority of rappers. He is said to have leftthe city at the age of 19 and taken up something of a Nomadic lifestyle, movingfrom place to place to pursue his craft before settling in Detroit, where he wasintroduced to producers J Dilla and Mr. Porter. He signed with Jay-Z's RocNation imprint in late 2010.It wasn't his music that first propelled him into the domain of the mainstreammedia, however, but rather his high-profile relationship with London-based KateRothschild, heiress to the Rothschild banking dynasty. This wasn't the firsttime a black musician had embarked upon an affair with a Rothschild; asmentioned in an earlier chapter, jazz musician Thelonious Monk had been involvedwith a Rothschild baroness in the late 1950s. 'Nica,' Monk's partner, was saidto have been an obsessive jazz fan. Kate, meanwhile, was a music producer amongher various activities, running her Round Table record label.Electronica is a stated Five Per Center – a radical pro-black faction of theNation Of Islam – and this would appear to be at odds with him dating a memberof the family that is so often cited as the ultimate representation of the whiteIlluminati power structure. It seems wonderfully ironic that the Nation OfIslam's teachings are frequently described as 'anti-Semitic,' and theRothschilds refer to themselves as Jewish. It's the type of story which, ifpresented as a work of fiction, would be dismissed as 'a bit far-fetched.'The Jay Electronica/ Kate Rothschild relationship began while she was stillmarried to Ben Goldsmith, son of the late billionaire financier Sir (there'sanother one) James Goldsmith. For a time, Ben and Jay went back and forth onTwitter, taunting each other. In June 2012, Ben was arrested on suspicion ofactual bodily harm against Kate, thought to be as a result of her affair. He waslater released without charge and subsequently filed for divorce on grounds ofadultery. They had three children together. Electronica already had a child withfellow enigmatic music-maker Erykah Badu.This unlikely union has drawn all manner of speculation from truth-seekers andhip-hop fans alike. Some have attested that, in striking up the relationship,Electronica had 'infiltrated the enemy,' and was working to expose the elitebloodlines from the inside. The opposing view, however, is that at the moment hefirst found fame and fortune, he went the same way as every other artist does interms of being owned, and that the relationship is likely to be an arranged one,in the way that all other high-profile celebrity couplings are. Could there beany significance to the lyric 'brunch with the Rothschilds, dinner with theCarters' on Jay's track 'Call Of Duty' in this regard?The Electronica/ Rothschild relationship was hitting headlines around the sametime as the one between Russell Brand and Jemima Goldsmith, daughter of SirJames Goldsmith, and brother to Ben. She married cricketer Imran Khan, takinghis name, divorcing before she embarked on her affair with Brand. This seemed anequally unlikely pairing that smacked of being set up, leading to exactly thesame kind of scrutiny among vigilant onlookers. By 2014, the relationshipbetween Electronica and Rothschild seemed to have fizzled out. The 'Daily Mail'reported in August of that year that Jay had moved back to America, while Katewas living in a cottage next door to the Georgian mansion of her formermother-in-law, Lady Annabel Goldsmith.Electronica's music has at times been particularly potent and touching, mostnotably on the stunning 'Better In Tune With The Infinite,' where he includeslines such as, \"the name on that birth certificate, that ain't the real me,\" andincluding an opening quote from long-time leader of the Nation of Islam, ElijahMohammed. At other times, however, his lyrics have been more in-keeping with thegeneral glut of mainstream rappers. There's also the apparent paradox of hisappearing in promo shots with one eye covered, and his working relationship withthe Grand Master of Illuminati Puppets, Jay-Z.Conspiro Media writer Matt Sergiou delved right into the Electronica enigma whenhe guested on my 'Good Vibrations' podcast in 2013, which threw forward somefurther interesting revelations. Among them was that Jay Electronica'sbackground was not necessarily as had been generally assumed.A UK 'Mail On Sunday' article centred around the claims of a man named Virgil C.Tiller, who claims he grew up with the young Timothy Thedford. Tiller claimedthat, although Electronica did indeed start out in the Magnolia Projects, whenhe was six, he and his mother moved to a two-bedroom flat in a Victorian housein an affluent district of New Orleans. Tiller also claimed that Thedfordreceived an education at St. Augustines, a private Catholic boys' school whichwould have cost, at the time, the equivalent of £3,500 per year in school fees.Matt went on to address another anomaly surrounding Electronica – the issue ofhis album, 'Act II: Patents Of Nobility' which, like Dr. Dre's mythological'Detox,' had been promised for years but was still showing no signs of release.A letter had appeared on-line from an individual giving his name as CarterWhitelow. As the initial release date for the album approached, Whitelowcommented that it would never come out. The reason, he claimed, is because thelyrics and stories contained were actually based on a book of poetry that he,Whitelow, had written years before when he was in high-school, and entitled 'ActII: The Life And Times of Carter Whitelow.' He had credited the works to hisalter-ego, Trademark Legacy, aka the Black Adam.Electronica had plagiarised the content, he claimed, through a mutual, wealthycollege acquaintance who had connections within the Def Jam/ Roc Nation empire.The unnamed friend, if Whitelow's story is true, had given the poetry manuscriptto someone within Def Jam, who had held on to it, then seen an opportunity touse it as the basis of Electronica's debut album. Whitelow claims to haverecognised his own lyrics when he heard Electronica's material on the radio, andthreatened to sue. Little else has been heard in the music media to supportWhitelow's claim, but then again, something has to account for the fact thatElectronica's album has still not appeared, despite reportedly being completedin 2012, and shows no sign of doing so any time soon.If Whitelow's story turns out to be true, it casts doubt on the authenticity ofany of Electronica's lyrical content, just as the claims about his schooling andhousing have to cast doubts upon the consistent claims of a ghetto upbringing.The net result is way more questions than answers when it comes to this mostperplexing of artists.IS NOTHING SACRED?People often say, \"Surely such-and-such an artist isn't corrupted andcompromised? I know all the others are, but surely not them?\" Sadly, from theevidence we can now see, it would appear that any artist who has achieved fame,fortune and great success has attained it at a price. In some cases, an artistcan flourish for years without any obvious signs of their ownership, but theseindicators are eventually put on public display.Kate Bush is an act who, from day one, was an original one-off. From the momentshe first appeared with the supernatural overtones of the ghostly 'WutheringHeights,' after reportedly being discovered by Pink Floyd's Dave Gilmour, shehas been feted for making wildly creative music that defies conventionalcategorisation. She has also explored esoteric themes, from addressing WilhelmReich's suppressed orgone technology in 'Cloudbusting,' to the weaponisation ofsound in 'Experiment IV,' to revering the language of the cosmos in 'Pi.' It wastherefore a great disappointment for many when she willingly accepted a CBE fromthe Queen late in her career in 2013, remarking jovially, \"now I've gotsomething really special to put on the Christmas tree.\"The following year, Kate played her first solo gig in 35 years at London'sHammersmith Apollo. Alert researchers were quick to spot much of the symbolismthat was being displayed, including the depiction of lizard-like reptilianentities, a guitarist sporting a creepy bird face-mask, and a model aeroplanebuzzing from one side of the stage to the other dispersing vapours veryreminiscent of Chemtrails. All unwelcome hints at Kate being yet anothermanipulated commodity of the Establishment, and being used to normalise certainagendas in the same way as so many of her lesser-established peers. What is itthat happens to all these artists?JUST DON'T MENTION THE R-WORD!Besides the Thelonious Monk/ Jay Electronica affairs, the Rothschilds havelargely managed to stay out of the music industry spotlight – just as theymanage to avoid the glare of the wider media. They are alluded to on the sleeveto a Rick Ross mixtape from 2012, however, titled 'The Black Bar Mitzvah,' thecover of which has the rapper luxuriating in a fur coat inside the symbol thatthe Rothschilds adopted as their family logo. It's known as the Seal Of Solomonand is the symbol on the flag of modern Israel, (which the Rothschilds founded,)representing a fusion of the blade and chalice symbols – a unity of the male andfemale principles inherent in nature. Why Ross chose this title and imageryremains unexplained. Maybe he plans to re-name himself Rick Rothschild?Around the same time, Boy George appeared showing off a new (temporary) tattooon the crown of his bald head. This was of a lotus flower and assorted otherdesigns, with the same Seal of Solomon/ House of Rothschild symbol emerging outof it. The significance of this is anyone's guess."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Fitzpatrick Informer: The Hollywood Kabbalah Cult Unmasked: * https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-hollywood-kabbalah-cult-unmasked-part-iii/ [https://fitzinfo.wordpress.com/2014/05/12/the-hollywood-kabbalah-cult-unmasked-part-iii/]Sherry Shriner on Sherry Talk Radio: * http://www.sherrytalkradio.com/transcribe/2012/01-16-12.htm [http://www.sherrytalkradio.com/transcribe/2012/01-16-12.htm]Professor Griff & Katt Williams Presents . . .

don't really know how,We're gonna change this,But we have to.\"Alais Clay: 'Wake 'Em Up' (2010)\"Freedom is directly linked to morality. As a society becomes more moral,freedom increases. As a society becomes less moral, freedom declines.\"Mark PassioTRUTH BOMBSDespite the validity of everything else you'll have read here, you've justreached the most important two chapters in the entire book. Although theinformation that follows is best read at the tail-end of everything else for thefull context, these can be taken in isolation and absorbed in their own right. Icertainly urge anyone to not stop reading here, or the true nature of everythingelse they've read will be lost, and if there's only one section they choose toshare with others, I would urge them to make this the one.Having spent the rest of this book looking at so many of the strange things thatgo on in the music industry and beyond, it's now time to start addressing thewhy. Any such story that ends without going there is like getting to thesumming-up of an Agatha Christie murder-mystery and finding the last few pageshave been ripped out.I'm going to spend the remaining pages sharing with you what I've come tounderstand. I'll be dispensing with phrases like 'I believe that . . . ' or'it's my opinion that . . . ' It'll be pretty clear that this is the case, andto state that every time would detract from the readability of the information.How anyone chooses to react is of course up to them. A significant part of thehuman suffering that's endured for so long has been as a result of certainindividuals telling everyone else what they must believe. The information willspeak for itself, anyway, and will resonate with those it's destined to resonatewith.As I mentioned at the very start of this book, it is impossible to trulyunderstand the manipulations of the music industry without putting them into thefull context of what's really going on in this world – and what this reality isin the first place. The understandable reaction of so many when they come togrudgingly accept the conspiracy is to ask, 'but what can we do about any ofthis?' It's only an understanding of what follows that offers the empowerment todo anything to counter it.The same could be said for any number of subjects within the truth/ conspiracyrealm. There are many full-time experts on 9/11, for instance, who have takenapart the official version bit-by-bit and could talk for hours about the manyanomalies. The case will be the same with the truth about vaccines, GM food,Chemtrails, institutionalised paedophilia, Satanic Ritual Abuse, trauma-basedmind control . . . the list goes on. Each of these may seem like an isolatedsubject area in its own right, but when you come to understand the biggerpicture, it becomes clear how they're all connected, and how each of them servesits own purpose within the system, in tandem with all the others. As music is mything, I've attempted to show with this book how the manipulations of the musicindustry are just one of these cogs in the wheel.Many feel overwhelmed by the dark nature of these subjects, reasoning that thecontrol system has been so deeply embedded into our reality for so long, thatdeconstructing it step-by-step seems impossible. Those of a New Age persuasion,meanwhile, will argue that paying any kind of attention to a dark or negativesubject only helps to keep it manifested in reality, due to the energeticconnection that individuals make when applying their conscious attention. Thisis ultimately a cop-out and an abdication of personal responsibility, since thefirst step towards resolving any problem has to be understanding the full natureof it as far as it's possible. Only then can any solution come. And attemptingto dismantle the hugely complex and multi-tiered control system brick-by-brick,clearly is impractical. The real solution lies elsewhere.There can surely be no-one of an appropriate thinking capacity in the world, whohasn't given at least the smallest amount of reflection to the big questions inlife: Who are we? Where do we come from? Why are we here? What, actually is'here?' What happens when we leave it? Although discussion of such subjects israrely heard around the water cooler at work or over the average family meal,they are enigmas which have puzzled and confounded humanity for millennia, andmust surely occupy the thoughts of all people on Earth at least occasionallyduring their solitary quiet time.For as long as I can remember, they've certainly plagued my mind, from the firstmentions of 'Jesus' and an undefined entity called 'God' in my primary schooldays, to my four years attending an Evangelical Christian church under thedelusion that this might bring answers to the strange feelings I started gettingat the age of 19 that the world wasn't quite what we'd been led to think it was,to my ultimate departure, disillusioned at not having found the answers butinstead a whole set of new questions. This set me on the path to many years ofbitter Atheism, genuinely believing that there is no divine plan, that humanlife is a cosmic accident, and that beyond death lies oblivion and nothingness.As I mentioned at the start, it was around 2008 that this belief system startedto crumble, in the face of new evidence that was coming my way as to the truenature of this world and the forces that currently have it in their grip.The activities of the dark occult priest-class are well-documented in the restof this book. The power that they've been able to exert over humanity has onlybeen possible through their deeply-studied understanding of the profound natureof reality. What it all comes down to is the fact that everything in creation –from the planets and stars, to black holes in deep space, to animals, plants,mountains and humans – is made up of the same universal energy, vibrating atdifferent frequencies. In its base form, everything is this energy. It's eachexpression's unique vibratory pattern that gives it its form in the apparentlyphysical realm. (I say 'apparently' physical, because what we understand to bethe solid world only appears that way because of how we, as consciously-awarebeings, interpret and decode the energetic patterns that we experience.)I'm under no illusion as to how bizarre or unfeasible that information soundswhen it's encountered for the first time, and I was in lasting denial of itmyself when I first came across it. But there are many, many researchers,authors and scholars, from many different ages and walks of life, and fromcivilisations in all corners of the world – and all corroborating each-other'sinformation – who can explain the whole phenomenon way better than my soundbiteversion can. This understanding is also the basis of many of the religions andbelief systems of cultures from all over the ancient world, before many of thesegreat truths got corrupted and deliberately occulted by the institutionalisedreligions that we see at work in the world today. It's not for nothing that theword 'religion' is derived from the Latin word 'ligare,' meaning 'to bind or tieback'.You can also see this great truth about the nature of our reality encoded intopopular movies in the form of allegory. The original 'Matrix' is one of the mostfrequently-quoted examples. Beneath its surface gloss and CGI action sequences,lies the revelation that what we think of as physical reality is actuallyelectrical and digital information waves, which get decoded into 'reality' byour minds acting as receivers/ transmitters. In other words, the world onlyexists this way because we perceive it to be so. Without observers in place todecode the information, everything would remain in its base form, as energeticinformation codes. It occurred to me a while back that this must be the originof the often-heard phrase, 'if a tree falls in the woods and there's no-onethere to hear it, does it make a sound?' These seemingly nonsensical phrasesdon't come about by accident.When I came to my ultimate acceptance of this great truth, it had the oppositeeffect of the previous belief systems that I'd embraced; it answered morequestions than it raised. Only the understanding that this apparent reality –and all others – are expressions of energy resonating to different frequencypatterns, can explain the concepts of timeless eternity, the survival ofspirit-souls after death, reincarnation, out-of-body and near-death experiences,remote viewing and astral projection, and even the relatively trivial phenomenonof premonitions and deja vu. The atheistic/ Darwinian view that the world isbasically a cold, heartless rock floating in space, and that we're merebiological entities that just happen to have mutated out of nothingness againstall the odds, is another cop-out. It's a belief system for habitual sceptics,and is there as an alternative to all the man-made, mind-controlling religionsof the world to keep humanity away from the real truth of our existence. If theycan't get you with rigid, superstitious dogma, they get you with the opposite –absolute denial of anything vaguely spiritual or esoteric.Imagine then, that a small section of the human population, back in the mists ofpre-history, had come to understand that the Universe works in this way, and,devoid of the normal characteristics that prevent most of us from acting in sucha way, (conscience,) had decided that they could gain a tactical advantage overthe rest of the population by putting their knowledge to work, whiledeliberately keeping the rest of humanity in complete ignorance through anassortment of malevolent efforts. If we assume these individuals to not havehumanity's best interests at heart, and to be ruled by a psychopathic mind-set,we can start to see how this is going to spell a pretty raw deal for everyoneelse. This, in fact, is the dynamic that has been at play in our world forthousands of years, and the conditions we find ourselves living in during thesetimes are as a direct, long-term consequence of this process.It's only a psychopathic approach to the world that could keep a control systemformed on this basis in place for as long as it has been. Most people whenthinking of psychopaths, have visions of the Norman Bates character in theHitchcock movie, or a knife-wielding frenzied serial killer from some teenslasher flick. But this is a caricature of the extreme end of psychopathy. Forthe most part, it's determined simply by a complete lack of empathy andcompassion towards other beings, and an inability to understand – or care –about the impact that your actions might have for the rest of creation. Apsychopath can quite happily give the order for a village-full of women andchildren in some far-off land to be slaughtered in a drone bomb attack, andsleep like a baby that very night without a single troubling thought. Theworld's governments are full of them, and not by accident. A very smallproportion of the human population – between one and five per-cent depending onwhich researcher you listen to – are reckoned to be primary psychopaths. They'reborn this way, with the section of the brain that gives rise to compassion andempathy broken and dysfunctional. It's a mental illness, and at its primarylevel, it cannot be cured.Secondary psychopathy, meanwhile, is a condition that can be programmed orcultivated into an individual, usually from early childhood. Growing up in afamily or social environment which is characterised by psychopathy – inconjunction with suffering personal abuse and trauma oneself – can bring about apsychopathic approach to the world. These are the methods that the controlling'elites' use on their own children to produce the type of mindset that will beneeded for a lifetime spent serving the system and oppressing the rest ofhumanity. Psychologists say that this level of psychopathy can actually bereversed and cured, however, if an individual is taken out of this type ofconditioning early enough, and if there is some level of personal will on theirpart to break free of it. There are examples of many who have done this.EXITING THE ASYLUMOver the years phrases such as 'conspiracy theorist' and 'tinfoil-hat-wearingnutjob' have been created to dismiss anyone questioning the official line as awide-eyed, unhinged lunatic. Exercising the ability to think for yourself andasserting your individuality have been made a social crime, and because themajority of people are constantly seeking the approval of others, and trying to'fit in' to a world that has been deliberately made insane, they play ball andact in line with 'normal' behaviour, not wishing to step out of the security andcomfort-zone of the box.It becomes clear then, that understanding great truths, then taking on theresponsibility to communicate what you've learned to others, can never bepossible for anyone still stuck in that systematic mindset. Anyone wishing toembark on a path towards true knowledge and understanding – and thereforefreedom – has to first let go of any concern of what others might think of themfor what they do, say or think. Most people are shackled by worries of what theblokes down the pub might think if they stopped talking about football andstarted speaking about the mysteries of life and reality, or what their Mum orDad or partner might think, or what their boss at work will say. Fear ofbecoming a social outcast is what keeps so many silent and inactive aboutinformation that needs to be put out there as widely as possible if humanity isever to break free of the slavery and servitude that's been imposed on us.Overcoming this is certainly a difficult process for most that come to truth. Iknow this from personal experience. Burning those first bridges is always themost difficult step. As you start to speak out, you realise that the paths backto your previous way of life are disappearing and that the only way now isforwards. It didn't take long until I reached the stage where I no longer gave ashit what anyone might think of me for what I was starting to say, however, andfor that which I instinctively knew to be true. I couldn't be writing this bookotherwise.A way of thinking which certainly helped me overcome any worry about how peoplemight perceive me, was to consider what anyone actually gets in exchange forworrying what their mate, or sister, or dad, or colleague, or some randomstranger might think of them. In each case, the value that you draw fromcensoring what you say, or modifying the way you act for fear of how it might godown with somebody else, is exactly the same. Absolutely nothing. No value orbenefit at all. Why then, do we do it?Another way I like to look at it all is: I've never appreciated being taken fora mug. And who really does? Who can honestly say they enjoy the idea of beingduped, of being treated by others as a chump, of someone else considering themso dumb and ignorant and stupid, that they can feed them a constant crock oflies, disinformation and deception, knowing they'll lap it all up like anunthinking moron? Not me, thanks.Yet this is what's going on in the world. Every day the bulk of humanity isspoon-fed lies by the corporate-controlled mainstream media, by the professionalpaid liars in government, and by those in other aspects of the Establishment.All these lies can be proven to be such by the application of critical thoughtand evidence-based research. Yet most choose to commit absolutely none of theirtime – through free-will choice – to looking into such matters, and remain tooafraid to talk about it to friends, family, neighbours and colleagues. \"Well,I'd like to let people know about human slavery and about how our thoughts andperceptions are not our own, and about how things are never going to get anybetter for any of us until there's a massive shift in awareness of these thingsand a huge change in human behaviour and thought as a result . . . but whateverwould the lads at the job think?\"Who, honestly, can look at the world we live in and think it to be 'normal' orsane? A world where human labour is exploited in the form of taxes, stolen by aninstitution called 'government' on the premise that it's needed to help maintainthe infrastructure of the land? (although the truth is that much of it iscovertly siphoned off to fund some overseas war or other.) A world where suchtaxation methods are only necessary in the first place because, instead ofprinting and circulating money themselves, the governments of the worldcommission cartels of private bankers operating under such names as the FederalReserve and Bank Of England, to loan the government money with debtautomatically attached, obliging the government to use the energy and the labourof the people as collateral against the loan?Then, when more money is needed to pay off the debts that come with each newtransaction, the banking cartels issue new money with yet more debt attached,meaning there's never enough money in circulation to pay off the accrued debts,and in turn, that there will always be those in society that will go bankruptand lose money, property and land. It's built into the very fabric of the systemthat this is the case, and yet people accept this with no fuss as 'normal.' Justthe way it is. And anyone suggesting that it might be in humanity's bestinterests if we found a new way to do things is written off as a 'nutter' or a'conspiracy theorist.' If this is 'sane,' I'm very happy to remain in 'nutter'territory, thanks all the same.How can anyone truly justify one family sitting on sickening, colossal levels ofwealth purely as a result of their genetics, and expecting the rest of thepopulation to be servile to them? How many question what 'Royal' even means inthe first place? What excuse can there be for hundreds of thousands in the veryland they claim to 'reign' over, living in shocking levels of poverty andhardship that could be eradicated overnight if the wealth were distributedfairly, in line with humanity, compassion, and straight common-sense, ratherthan being tied up in gold-plated carriages, pointless regalia, and othermindless expressions of pomp and grandeur that benefit no-one except thesoulless parasites that are permitted to use them? The Queen of England, (notthat there's anything English about the whole Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Battenbergbloodlines that pass themselves off under the stolen name of 'Windsor,' ofcourse,) is so obscenely rich that she's reckoned to 'own' what equates toaround a sixth of the planet, including the sea-beds that lie underneath oceans!How can any one human-being, (a status which is debated by some!) own a sea-bed,for fuck's sake!? Or any other natural resource on the planet for that matter,which in reality is freely and abundantly available to all who occupy the Earthfor the few decades that they're in their bodies, before it falls under thecustody of the next generation?Another expression of pure insanity when you really get down to the grass-rootsof it. And another which is not only tolerated, but is actively propped-up andallowed to continue by so many of the very people it exists to enslave andexploit so contemptuously! Witness the hordes of brainwashed morons waving theirplastic flags and queuing for hours to catch a glimpse of the figurehead of asystem that is enslaving them and their families. That's sane? I'll stay crazy,please.Who, outside of the realms of the propaganda and hyperbole that's peddled in itsfavour, can really offer any kind of moral justification for war? Who, apartfrom career military men, soulless bankers or psychopathic politicians with asalary to earn and an agenda to serve, have you ever met who wanted a war? Whothought that killing and mutilating other people and causing unending ripples ofhuman suffering, was a reasonable, sensible and justifiable way of resolving aconflict? And yet we're conditioned from the earliest age to meekly accept thatwar is an inevitable by-product of human nature, that we're tribal beings thatjust can't get along, and that we're inherently warlike and aggressive in ournature.We live in a society of double-standards where, if an everyday civilian pickedup a machine-gun and slaughtered a group of women and children in cold blood,they would, (quite rightly,) be branded a dangerous criminal and incarcerated/executed, depending on the state or country in question. Yet, when a militarysoldier, (or increasingly now, a cop,) does the same, this act of straightmurder can be written off as 'collateral damage' involving 'casualties of war,'and the perpetrator will not only escape justice, but is highly likely to bedecorated for 'bravery' or 'service in the line of duty!'We hear constantly of the 'War on Cancer,' as promoted by the many, manycharities in this field. \"One day we'll beat cancer,\" they say. But it alwayscomes with the proviso that to do so, they need money from the general public ona never-ending basis. Lots of it. When cancer charities have been working on'finding a cure' for well over 50 years, you have to ask yourself where exactlyall that money is going when the cure never seems to appear. The truth is thatthe majority of the funds go towards making the senior executives of thesecharities very, very rich. As difficult as it is for people to come to termswith, sadly, it turns out that many cancer charities are money-making scams,cynically manipulating the good nature of well-meaning people by dangling theever-present carrot of 'hope.' The last thing this organised racket wants is tofind a cure for cancer. This would put hundreds of thousands of employees out ofbusiness, and deprive the pharmaceutical industry of millions of customers everyyear, along with the huge profits they generate through conventional treatment.The truth is that natural cures for cancer have always existed. Nature providesthe remedies for all human ailments, usually in the form of the appropriateplant correctly administered. This is knowledge that has been understood formillennia by the shaman and priest-doctors of indigenous populations around theworld. You know, the very same shaman and priest-doctors that have beenmercilessly slaughtered by the colonialism that has ravaged so manycivilisations, destroying their culture and knowledge in their wake.Isn't it interesting, given that cannabis is cited as the principal alternativecure, that it's demonised in Western society as a dangerous 'narcotic' that'sillegal to cultivate, whereas pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines loaded withtoxic ingredients like mercury and formaldehyde, are absolutely fine? How couldthis be in a situation where governments 'care' about people and 'representtheir interests?'Can any world where this sort of thing happens be judged as 'sane'? Clearly not,I'd suggest. And yet it goes on being tolerated by most, without a secondthought towards the sheer injustice and madness of it all.The brainwashed state of low-level consciousness that we are manipulated intofrom birth – and which few ever take it upon themselves to break out of – wascommunicated with poetic brilliance in a 2015 Facebook post by Mats RickardLagnevall. It's hard to know how to express this great truth any moreeffectively than this:\"In a materialistic Westernised country of choice, a young boy cries out loud toexpress his great anguish because, for reasons beyond his comprehensive ability,he cannot have that big red toy located in a large Toys 'R' Us. His mother sayshe can have this yellow toy instead. But it's so small compared to that toy, andthusly, he displays his emotions in the most natural manner available to him.The tears of disapproval fall seemingly unending in quantity.\"To no avail does the mother tell the boy to be silent. She says that it is nota matter requiring tears. But why should he be silent? He is sad, and he musttherefore express it so that he can move beyond it. In herunconsciously-accepted shame, she angrily commands him to be silent! Althoughthis proves to be an equally futile act. His tears continue to fall.\"The boy simply cannot understand. After all, there are so many toys here, whycan't he have that red toy? Why are all these toys here if not to be playedwith? Why must he be silent when he is sad? Why is his mother now angry at him?His tears are starting to give way for shock and confusion.\"Strangers passing by the mother and her boy stop in their paths to whisper toeach other, whilst pointing their fingers – something that the mother almostinstinctively responds to by grasping the boys arm firmly and inflicting slightpain, as she threatens him with not receiving any toy at all unless he stops hiscrying and sobbing. And of course, at this outlook, the boy mentally musters upall the force he can in an effort to stop the tears. The only sound remaining tobreak the silence is intermittent snivelling as he assumes mental posture andlooks around at the people now quickly losing interest, as there's no longeranyone upsetting the status-quo.\"The boy records everything, yet in his conscious mind, he can understand noneof it.\"As the years go on and he grows older, he learns that displaying emotions islargely frowned-upon in this society, and during his years in school, he alsolearns that questioning authority is duly forbidden, as the authority willpunish you for such transgressions.\"In his teens, the boy is introduced to different ways of intoxicating himself.He habituates smoking, as it relieves his worries by granting slight sensorystimuli, blatantly disregarding all the long-term potential hazards outweighedby the instant gratification.\"He grows up to become a mediocre man, taught to keep most of his opinions tohimself and do what he's told. He eventually marries a woman who doesn't demandtoo much from him, and he drudges through the work weeks of the year only reallylooking forward to the next weekend and its subsequent pleasures of intoxicatinghimself to a sufficient degree as to forget his worries, and to numb theever-growing pain in the furthest reaches of his being.\"The boy is now a man, his life as inconspicuous and insignificant as any of hisfellow colleagues or friends. One week is merely replaced by another. The joythat used to arrive every weekend is now scarcely available but more than once ayear during the first few days of vacation. It is at this point that hecompletely loses all outlook on life. He succumbs to a deep and dark placewherein years of suppressed emotions haunt him in every waking moment. Thestrength of his mind is shattered under the sheer force of the emotionalre-emergence, and his life falls asunder.\"He seeks help from society in how to handle these emotions. But the moderninquisition under the guise of Psychology does not exist to alleviate the issuescreated by the societal norms in the first place. It's only meant to assure thatthe people are able to work another week, and thusly he receives no actualassistance. He is given one drug after another, all of which numb his mind, andessentially remove the sensations elicited from his suppressed emotions. But hecontinues taking them, because he's learnt not to disobey authority and to dowhat he's been told.\"At this point, the man is largely dead. He's still able to perform within hismonotonous work, but all of life has lost its colours, the taste across hispalate is bland, and he no longer has a mind with which to worry. His spinalcolumn is left to live out the remaining years of his so-called ordinary life.And one day, he is found dead in his favourite chair.\"Is this really what we want?\"And so, it becomes clear that a major change in the human mind-set – broughtabout by a radical shift in consciousness – is vital if this planet is to evercome close to being a just and moral place to live. Losing the fear of whatothers might think is the first change that has to happen on a major scale. Butan understanding of the moral laws of the Universe – on a scale that rivals theknowledge that's been hoarded by the dark occultists who have held humankind inslavery for so long – is also essential."},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Rick Simpson's site regarding natural cures for cancer: * www.cureyourowncancer.org/rick-simpson.html [http://www.cureyourowncancer.org/rick-simpson.html]John Assaraf: Why You Should Be aware Of Quantum Physics: * http://johnassaraf.com/law-of-attraction/why-you-should-be-aware-of-quantum-physics-2 [http://johnassaraf.com/law-of-attraction/why-you-should-be-aware-of-quantum-physics-2]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20IF NOT YOU, THEN WHO?IF NOT NOW, THEN WHEN?How the story ends is down to us.

In anyevent, it is the only way we can live.\"Edward Kennedy, eulogy to his brother Robert F Kennedy, 1968THE TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE – BUT FIRST IT WILL PISS YOU OFFThe outstanding activist, researcher and humanitarian, Santos Bonacci, had somewonderful words to say about seeking the path to truth when he guested on theVinny Eastwood Show in November 2014:\"I'm a researcher, and have been all my life. I've always studied and uncoveredtruths, facts, evidence, proof, because that's what I love doing. I love thetruth, I want the truth, I need to know the truth, and I speak the truth. It'sthe best way to go. When you start lying, you have to create more lies to coverthe original lie. And we know that lies create a lot of hurt among humanity. Wesee how politicians lie, lawyers lie – in fact, that's what being a lawyer isall about, lying – and we see businessmen lie and never coming up with thegoods. So it's a very hurtful thing to do. And the only thing you should neverdo in the Universe is never injure or harm another living thing. So to uncoverthe truth is a very beautiful thing, and I've always been a very zealoustruthseeker, and I've uncovered many, many lies that are happening.\"So because of this, and because of the presentations that I've put out onYoutube, I've come to the attention of both good people, and people who wouldlove to continue perpetuating the lies, because it does help their agenda andtheir money-making schemes. So when you start uncovering things that you knowyou should – because otherwise you would occasion those wrongs – this does hurtthe ones that are perpetrating the great lies.\"\"He who knows of a wrong but does not uncover it, occasions it.\"Just as truth is absolute, unwavering and eternal – regardless of whether anyone individual believes it or not – so there are laws set into place in theUniverse by whatever force it was that created it. The outstanding US researcherMark Passio refers to this as Natural Law, as do many others. The same dynamicgets expressed under other names, however. The concept is known variously asUniversal Law, Karmic Law, the Law of Cause and Effect, and through the notionsof 'what goes around comes around,' and 'every action has a reaction.' Parentsof young children will recognise the concept played out in the Choices andConsequences method of parenting, where kids are taught that the free-willchoices they make carry a resulting consequence, whether good or bad. I preferto use the Natural Law reference. Mark Passio has a wealth of information on thephenomenon – and so many subject areas related to it – in the many podcasts,videos and articles that are accessible via his hugely resourceful website atwww.whatonearthishappening.com [http://www.whatonearthishappening.com]My own understanding of how Natural Law works was summed up in just three wordsby the Australian researcher Max Igan, (whose equally outstanding work allresides at www.thecrowhouse.com [http://www.thecrowhouse.com],) offered by wayof a simplistic explanation – 'Do No Harm.' I'd always had it drummed into methat you should 'treat others the way you'd like to be treated yourself.' But onone of Max's podcasts I heard him point out the logical fallacy behind thatoften-heard statement. Supposing for argument's sake, Max suggested, you happento be a homosexual who enjoys bondage, and you happen to live next door to a manwho you find sexually attractive, but who doesn't share your preferences. Usingthe above statement's advice, presumably you would then be justified in forcingyourself and your preferences on that individual, on the grounds that you'dquite like it if one day he came over to your place and did the same to you.I feel the point was well-made.In fact, it's an apparent reversal of that statement which holds true to NaturalLaw, and which can be expressed as: \"Do not treat others in a way you would notwish to be treated yourself.\" The ultimate inherent human right is to be leftalone to live your life however you choose, so long as your chosen behaviours donot cause harm to another living being. This way of approaching life hasuniversal applications, and if observed by everyone on the planet, would involvea better way of life for all concerned, with no exceptions. At the most extreme,(except in unavoidable cases of self-defence,) no-one would kill or physicallyharm another being, on the grounds that no-one, (barring the odd mentally-illpsychopath,) would want that done to them by another.With characteristic vitriol, Mark Passio illustrated the point wonderfully on aradio interview with David Whitehead on the Truth Frequency Radio network in2014:\"The bottom line is, if you wouldn't want a person doing a certain behaviour toyou, don't do it to another person. The end. And people can't get that simplemessage. That's the golden rule in the apophatic sense. Do not do to others whatyou do not want done to you. State the golden rule like that, folks. It'sinfinitely more powerful than 'do unto others as you would have them do untoyou.' When you say it in the negative, in the apophatic sense, it's way morepowerful. Because everybody knows how they don't want to be treated.\"Let me pass the buck, let me say it's somebody else's fault. It's because ofthis reason, it's because I didn't know this, it's because this circumstance wasin place, it's because I had to pay this bill, it's because I was worried aboutwhat this person would think of me, it's because my wife might leave me, it'sbecause I have a kid to feed . . . \"None of that matters! Zero! I would look every single human being in the face,no matter what their circumstance was, and say it does not matter! And that'snot me being on some sort of moral high-horse. It's not me putting myself up ona pedestal. I can make mistakes. What I'm saying is, there is no justification.Everybody, ultimately at some level knows when you're harming someone else, andyou have no right to do that to another person. I don't care how much youthought you were allowed to do it, because someone told you, or you believed inthis law or that law or the other thing.\"And expanding on the principle on Episode 180 of his What On Earth Is Happeningpodcast:\"The solution is so simple. It always has been. Don't treat others the way youyourself wouldn't want to be treated. State it that way and it becomes realunambiguous, and so simple that a child could figure it out. You don't want tobe harmed, defrauded, stolen from, raped, have your rights taken away? Don't dothat to other people. Period. The end. It's so simple it's almost stupid, folks.It can't get any simpler than that, and yet humanity has proven we still can'tgrasp it, we still can't understand it and we want the associated suffering anddeath that's going to come with refusing to live by that basic rule.\"It would even trickle down to the most trivial aspects of human life. Mostpeople don't particularly like having a phone call ignored or being told a lieor an unconvincing excuse, for example. If each of us undertook not to do thisto others, therefore, the transformative effect would be profound. Imagine aworld where instead of people doing exactly what suits them, in their ownindividual circumstances, right there and then, their first thought would be 'isthere any way in which the action I'm about to take is likely to impactnegatively on others?' Only if the answer is 'no' does the action go ahead.The 'do no harm' dynamic can be extended by a further four words to: 'Do NoHarm, But Take No Shit.' Although apparently a wisecrack, (and probably not aphrase to teach the kids,) this actually contains everything you need to knowabout how to live life morally and in accordance with eternal truths, in justseven words. This phrase stands as an easily-digestible summing-up of the twocentral tenets of Natural Law. These are also expressions of the duality of themale and female principles that occur everywhere in nature.The first is frequently referred to as the Non-Aggression Principle. It is anexpression of the sacred feminine, and it represents the 'do no harm' and 'donot treat others in a way you would not wish to be treated yourself' dynamics.It means you respect the right of others to be left alone and to not havecoercion brought into their lives against their will, and you yourself canexpect the same rights to be afforded to you.If, however, any individual or institution breaks that principle, then thesecond key tenet comes into force. This is masculine in nature, and is the SelfDefence Principle. This essentially involves any individual doing whatever isnecessary to protect themselves, their family and their property against anythreat or incursion brought about by a violation of the Non-AggressionPrinciple. The very embodiment of 'take no shit,' if you prefer. Though I can'thelp observing that, if everyone were to live life according to the 'do noharm'/ Non-Aggression Principle, there would never actually be any need for theSelf Defence/ 'take no shit' Principle to be put to use!Right and wrong behaviours are absolute, and not open to interpretation,regardless of how repugnant that notion might be to the proud and arrogant humanego. The idea that what constitutes 'truth' is down to the individual, and thatone man's take on it is no more or less valuable than the next man's, is knownas Solipsism. Truth doesn't do interpretation. It just is.PERSONAL OBLIGATIONSNatural Law is the ultimate truth, and it dishes out karmic consequences tohumans based on the free-will choices that are made, both on an individual, anda collective basis.I realise how uncomfortable it will be for many to accept this as being thecase. I understand because it was deeply uncomfortable for me when I first cameto a realisation of it. But how any individual might feel about it is neitherhere nor there. Many may choose to reject what I'm putting forward here, inwhich case, that's their free-will choice and their karma. But everything I'vecome to discover can be verified and validated with research, and there is awealth of information available to do just that for anyone with enough of anenquiring mind and a free spirit.I also do find that an understanding of Natural Law and real truth does tend toanswer way more questions than it raises. And with the number of questions mymind has generated over the years, any path that answers a great many of themstrikes me as the right one to be on!Despite how it may at first sound, there's nothing arrogant in stating that youknow something to be the truth if it passes all the appropriate filters andmethods of discernment. Absolute statements are something that people have aproblem with, and some will point to them as being no different to religiousdogma, with an adherent of one man-made religion or another defiantly spoutingfrom a lectern that something is the truth because whatever holy book theirreligion instructs them to believe in tells them so. The real truth transcendsreligious belief systems, and knowing something through the gift of intuitionwith which humans are endowed, is a very different thing to believing it to bethe case. It is possible to know the truth if you choose to align yourself withit.Another thing that comes with an understanding of truth – and which tends to beequally unpopular with many – is that you also take on a personal responsibilityfor communicating that knowledge to other people, so they too have theopportunity to come to the same level of awareness. It's necessary for there tobe a period of assimilation when an individual first comes across thisinformation, so they can fully collate and process it. But there comes a pointwhere a personal obligation towards helping others to understand what you'velearned comes into force, and to absorb and hoard knowledge and spiritual truthsfor yourself, rather than pass it on to others, is a morally wrong behaviour.With truth comes responsibility. Think about the karmic implications that theelite priest-classes and secret-societies are bringing on themselves throughhaving suppressed information for so many millennia from those they deemunworthy, the 'goyim', and keeping it for the tactical benefit of just theprivileged few 'in the know.' The truth is a gift that is intended for everyone.It doesn't come with exclusivity rights.There are many ways in which truthful information can be communicated, and themost effective method will depend on the skill-sets and personalities of eachindividual. I'm not much of an in-your-face activist myself, so bellowingthrough a bullhorn outside some elitist gathering isn't really my thing. It wasrevelatory and humbling for me to realise that the reason I became a music fanso early in life, and went on to pursue work in DJing, radio and in writing, wasto place me right where I needed to be when I came to an eventual understandingof truth.Someone else may well lack these skills but have others. I'm a hopelesswrite-off when it comes to technology, but others will be able to use theirtechnical skills to design websites, write software programmes, create graphicsor make videos. Others will be brilliant at talking to people on an individualbasis and putting forward compelling information in a conversational fashion.The methods aren't important. The fact that you're participating in the processof getting real truth out there in whatever way works best for you, is.Mark Passio produced a wonderfully on-point podcast addressing this very subjecta while back, which I re-posted to my Soundcloud page. As well as theresponsibility for communicating truth, he went in acidically on what he callsthe AIs, (the appallingly ignorant) – those who avoid personal responsibilityfor truth despite the wide availability of information – and the SAAQs,(semi-aware armchair quarterbacks.) We all know these. These are individuals whodisplay a degree of understanding of what's really going on in the world, butwhose only contribution is to argue with others on chat forums and Facebookthreads, concealing their identity with a login name and avatar, and all fromthe safe comfort of their keyboard. Or they abuse and attack those that arecommunicating helpful information and who have had the balls to do it undertheir own name. These people are weak cowards, and far worse than those whoremain ignorant. One commenter on my page described it as 'the best podcast I'veever heard,' observing that 'nobody could put it better than this.' If I haven'tjust sold you the idea of taking a listen I don't know what more I can tell you!You'll find it here: * https://soundcloud.com/mark-devlin/mark-passio-vitriolic-rant [https://soundcloud.com/mark-devlin/mark-passio-vitriolic-rant]'OWNERSHIP' BY DECEPTIONAll humans are born into this 3D reality as free beings, and any claim ofownership over them by any individual or agency is a fiction. Despite thistruth, the dark priest-class have indeed duped most of the human population intoconsenting to their own 'ownership.' This is achieved by way of the so-called'legal' system that is in place in much of the Western world, and in many othercountries such as Australia and New Zealand. Anything that is claimed to be'legal,' as opposed to 'lawful,' is a fiction. True rights and laws can only begranted by the creative force behind the Universe. Any claim to legality by anyman is a fallacy. The system of so-called 'law' in place in most of thesecountries is derived from the system of Maritime, or Admiralty Law used inEngland during the seafaring days of Empire. Maritime Law has come to replaceCommon Law, or the 'law of the land,' which is a system more closely linked toNatural Law and the recognition of the inherent rights to freedom with which allhumans are born.Through clever use of language and the double-meaning of words, the controllershave tricked individuals into having corporate entities created in their name.These corporations remain the wholly-owned property of the Crown Corporation ofthe City of London, the head of which is the British Monarch. The City ofLondon, (rather like the relationship of the Vatican to Italy and Washington DCto the United States,) is an entirely autonomous State separate from England,with its own Mayor, its own police force, and its own set of 'laws.' When youstep into the 'square mile' you are no longer in England. Despite her positionas its figurehead, the Queen is required to request permission to enter itsterritory, and as part of the structure of hierarchy with which the elites seemso obsessed, is considered subservient to the Mayor for as long as she is in theterritory. (Readers can make up their own minds as to the symbolic relevance ofthe dragon statue which marks the entrance to the city's 'square mile,' which isbeyond the realms of this particular book!)This deception, which sees humans signed over as the property of the State andconsidered akin to seafaring vessels, is achieved ingeniously by way of oneparticular document . . . the birth certificate. Word-magic is at work here.'Birth' is phonetically identical to 'berth,' which is what a ship is said to bein when docked, and the meanings are taken to be interchangeable. When a humanis born, they are delivered via the 'birth canal,' in the same way that a shipis said to arrive. What well-meaning parents throughout the world have no ideaof – because they're not openly told – is that the birth (berth) certificateforms a bonding contract between the parents and the Crown Corporation, wherebythe child in question is represented as a corporate entity, separate to theflesh-and-blood sovereign individual. From the moment the contract is signed,that child is considered the property of the State, and bonds are issued andtraded on the stock market in his or her name. This is why the individual isthen required to apply for documents such as driving licences and passports, andbecomes liable to pay taxes. Because within the legal fiction that they haveunwittingly been entered into, they are owned property.This state of affairs can only exist in a fiction, because no individual cantruly be owned by any other individual or organisation. An indication of thefact that a corporate entity, rather than the flesh-and-blood being that itrepresents, is being addressed, is when official Government correspondencespells out the name in capital letters. More double-meaning wordplay here, thisstyle of lettering indicating that the subject is the 'capital,' or property, ofthe State. This is why communications from the Inland Revenue in particular –along with most other Government departments – always show the recipient's namein capital letters, while their address generally appears in both upper andlower-case.As far as the system sees it, a contract has been entered into by the parents,through their own free will, stating that their child is now the property of theState. And the use of capital letters is their 'fair warning,' (harking back tothe previous concepts of consent,) of what's going on. The fact that you didn'tunderstand is of no consequence to them in their warped mindset. They told youin their own way.(The issue of ambiguous contracts was the subject of a story which emerged in2010 when, for an April Fool's Day prank, the retailer Gamestation issued acontract whose Terms & Conditions stated that those signing it undertook to giveup their mortal souls. 84 per cent of those receiving the contract duly signedit without noticing what they had just agreed to. There are some clear parallelshere with what goes on in the 'real' world on a daily basis.)Information about this grand method of deception is now freely available on theinternet, and has led to huge numbers of individuals seeking to disassociatethemselves from their Government 'owners.' It has led to a move towards 'losingthe legal name,' in recognition that the identity on a birth certificate isfraudulent and is not truly representative of the individual using it. Thoseparticularly well-informed on how the Maritime Law set-up works, have evenstarted defending themselves in Courts of (fraudulent) Law, arguing that, byrenouncing their birth/ berth certificate, they no longer have any contractualties to the Crown, and are therefore not bound by any of its laws. It remains afact, however, that very few have been successful in challenging the system onthis basis without huge personal cost to themselves and their families. It wouldbe a different story, however, if vast numbers of people were to do so inunison, fully armed with the knowledge of how they have been deceived into acontract that has no legality under Natural Law, the only true and binding lawin the Universe. This whole subject area is a complicated minefield, loaded withword=magic, but it can be investigated fully on-line by any reader withsufficient curiosity and time to delve into it.CHOICES AND CONSEQUENCESFor a good couple of years I puzzled, like so many others, over why the 'elites'do some of the seemingly strange things that they do, such as apparentlypre-announcing their plans through popular culture, and leaving their symboliccalling-cards everywhere. At all levels of the control system, there aredisclaimers such as this, some more blatant than others. We find expressions ofit in the small-print at the bottom of financial contracts, in public noticesadvising you that you're being filmed by CCTV, in the 'side-effects' (so'effects' then!) documented with pharmaceutical drugs, and with the lists ofdouble-barrelled multi-syllabled chemicals on cans of fizzy drinks. Lessobviously, as readers will recall from the chapter on Predictive Programming, wefind highly-veiled announcements of the controllers' future false-flag eventsencoded into Hollywood movies, TV programmes, music videos and record sleeves.It was only after I came to understand how everything in creation is bound bythe workings of Natural Law, that the penny dropped. I realised that when thepowers-that-shouldn't-be do such things, it's their sick and twisted way ofobserving the laws of morality that are built into the construct of theUniverse. They feel that by announcing what they plan to do – or what the natureis of something they've already done – they are giving us, the people, theopportunity to raise our objection to it if we so choose. When no such objectionis given, the psychopaths feel that they are free, under Natural Law, to goright ahead with what they plan to do, and avoid karmic payback for it. In theirdiseased, distorted view of things, they take our non-objection to having theNon-Aggression Principle violated, to be our unspoken consent, or tacitapproval, for what they've told us they are doing.There are so many flaws to this way of thinking that it almost defies belief.But, given that we're dealing with a deeply psychopathic mind-set, anyexpectation of true logic, morality of expressions of humanity would be futile.First of all, to feel the need to cryptically encode any explanation is indirect contravention of the laws of morality. This is duplicity and deliberateobfuscation. With Predictive Programming it would take someone highly skilled inthe art of decoding symbols – not to mention with enough time on their hands toconstantly study such things – to be able to constantly call the manipulatorsout on what they feel they've adequately communicated.Even if their signs and notices were made abundantly clear, they would still bein violation of the Non-Aggression Principle, since any form of Government orauthority seeking to impose its will on any individual goes right against it.Human beings are born inherently sovereign and free, and have a right bestowedon them by the creative force behind the Universe to live out their lives thisway without incursion or coercion. To take someone's lack of disapproval for anaction you wish to take – whether you've announced it clearly or not – as agreen light for going ahead and violating their right to be left alone – meansyou've just flown in the face of the moral law of the Universe, and you can nowtake the karmic consequence for having done so.It's interesting that, despite their warped interpretation of what Natural Lawmeans for them, and their sheer arrogance in assuming they can cheat itsresults, the 'elites' still recognise its effects as something to which they atleast need to pay lip service. If they didn't, they would steam right ahead andstamp the boot of oppression down on humanity without a thought for needing tocheat the Universe and its methods. It's certainly why these rich old men employpolice and military foot-soldiers to do their bidding for them, rather thangetting their own hands dirty. While police and military types can often feelsuperior themselves through the status that their uniform or job title givesthem, the truth is that, by following the orders of their superiorsunquestioningly – without judging for themselves whether the actions they areabout to take are morally right or wrong – they are the ones bearing thepersonal karmic consequence for what ensues, not those that gave the orders.Ever noticed how it's never the sons of politicians and generals that are sentout to die on the frontlines of war zones? We'd be living in a very differentworld if the police and military would all wake up and understand how they'rebeing cynically manipulated by their superiors, and refuse to do their biddingany longer. There is hope, however, as more and more are leaving the police andmilitary by the week, having come to a difficult understanding of the truenature of what it is they are really a part of.The reason the controllers have to present apparently acceptable justificationsfor continually taking our nations to war, is that they know that to blatantlyannounce that they are going into some foreign nation or other to slaughter andsubjugate the population and steal the natural resources, is highly likely to bemet with disapproval and resistance from the general public. But portray thatforeign nation's leader as a tyrant or despot – particularly one who's 'killinghis own people' – to a public whose perceptions of the world are shaped only bywhat Government ministers and the mainstream media tell them, and thejustification for intervention is there. The masses will go along with the'something must be done' approach, and military action, in which it's clear manythousands will lose their lives, is written off as 'necessary.' Grudging publicconsent is there, and the manipulators take that as a green light to press aheadwith what they'd always planned to do.The same dynamic can be seen when it comes to paying taxes. The reality is thatno-one voluntarily pays tax. We have it extorted from us with the threat offines or imprisonment if we resist. The very notion of tax is a blatantviolation of the Non-Aggression Principle of Natural Law, because it representsthe State forcing its will upon individuals. It's made all the more immoral whenyou understand the true nature of money as debt, too.But this is another area in which the public gives its consent to an immoral actwhich goes against human decency and their own common interest. Because the myththat 'taxes are necessary' has been embedded into the public psyche, there's noco-ordinated resistance from people to having their money stolen from them, soagain the State takes this as consent and unspoken approval for this act.Centuries ago, there was a key maxim of Roman Law which stated: \"He who would bedeceived, let him be deceived.\" Exactly the same principle is at play here. Thestatement is saying that anyone ignorant enough not to realise that they are asovereign spiritual being and an expression of the divine – rather than acorporate entity, and therefore not answerable to any world-based authority –deserves their slavery. They have tacitly consented to their control, becausenot saying no is taken as having said yes.The same eternal truths regarding free-will choices and consenting wereunderstood in these past epochs, and were being used by the governmental systemsof the day in the same way they are today. Now, as then, so many situations onlytranspire because the masses are allowing it through their consent. Awithdrawing of this consent on a wide, collective basis, is the key to endingslavery and subjugation. When we all learn this lesson and apply it, our sharedexperiences will change, and not a day before.THE NUMBERS GAMEThat such a small number of individuals, when compared to the world population,have been able to successfully control the rest of humanity for so long, seemsalmost inconceivable. However, there is actually encouragement to be drawn fromthe fact that they've been able to do it – particularly when you realise thattheir greatest strength has been their unity of spirit and intent, and theirobservation of how the nature of reality works.It's their understanding that everything is made up of resonating light andsound energy that fuels the need to keep their targets – us – in a constantstate of low-vibrational fear. And so human society is structured in such a way,with manipulated wars, 'terrorist' events, social conflicts, financial crises,etc, all designed to generate fear and all its negative-energy derivatives –guilt, panic, regret, anxiety, worry, stress, hate, envy, resentment,selfishness, cowardice. And, as we've discovered along the way with this book,the music business plays its part in maintaining this constant low level ofconsciousness in humanity too. When you factor in the death and suffering thatoccurs in the non-human world – from the insane bloodbath brought about by therequirements of the food chain that sees millions of living things slaughteredevery day, to the trillions of animals meeting their terrifying and horrificends in slaughterhouses – you can imagine the colossal tidal wave of fear-basedlow vibrations that are going out into the energy field of this reality, 24/7.'Fear Is The Key', as the title of an Alastair MacLean novel rightly observed.So it's interesting to muse on what would happen if the elites were to stopperforming their Satanic rituals, with all the negativity that they entail. Addthat to the concept of a mass humanity awakening to its true nature, and raisingits consciousness to a higher level of resonance in its millions, breaking freeof the subliminal programming that's been imposed on it, and truly seeing theworld for what it is. With this process, we get to see the would-be controllersand their motives for what they really are, and the full potential that we – inour collective numbers – have for shaping the kind of reality that we wish toexperience with our positive thought and intent. Then, a very different type offuture to the nightmare worldwide concentration camp that's planned for us,starts to come into focus.A human society awakening in this way, is the route out of our ongoing sufferingas a species. If such a small number of 'elites' have been controlling 95-percent-plus of humanity for so long through pooling their negative intent toinfluence reality – how few of us would it really take to negate that power, andover-write it with a better version of reality? One that observes the tenets ofNatural Law – and specifically the Non-Aggression Principle – and spells abetter deal for all humanity? A scenario where 'do no harm' becomes so much ofan instinctive norm, that it doesn't even need to be stated? As so manyresearchers and commentators in this field have observed, and have been tryingto tell us for so long, this type of reality is a genuine possibility. It's onlya question of whether enough of us make the free-will conscious choice to bringit about, and change our thoughts and behaviours accordingly. This is howreality works – it's a blank canvas waiting to have written on it whatever typeof experience is desired by the participants.This great truth was summed-up brilliantly in an article by John Assaraf on thewakingtimes.com [http://wakingtimes.com] website:\"All of our interpretations are solely based on the ‘internal map’ of realitythat we have, and not the real truth. Our ‘map’ is a result of our personallife’s collective experiences. Our thoughts are linked to this invisible energyand they determine what the energy forms. Your thoughts literally shift theUniverse on a particle-by-particle basis to create your physical life.\"Look around you. Everything you see in our physical world started as an idea,an idea that grew as it was shared and expressed, until it grew enough into aphysical object through a number of steps.\"You literally become what you think about most. Your life becomes what you haveimagined and believed in most. The world is literally your mirror, enabling youto experience in the physical plane what you hold as your truth . . . until youchange it.\"When you're able to raise your consciousness above the confines of theprogramming, the old tricks just don't work any more. A Nicki Minaj record canbe seen for the toxic piece of mind-controlling garbage that it is, and thecynical lies of a moronic BBC newsreader spouting whatever propaganda theirbosses have instructed them to, can be seen for just that. In a society wherethe majority of the population is perceiving reality in this way – or even justenough of us to reach a critical-mass tipping point – the controllers' versionof reality no longer holds its power. This is where we need to be, and right nowoffers the best opportunity humanity has ever had to achieve it. Themanipulators recognise this, too. It's no accident that human society haschanged so radically in such a short period of time.A hallmark of the elite class through the generations has been their meticulousplanning and their incredible displays of patience. They plan their movesdecades, even centuries in advance, knowing in many cases that those of themdoing the planning won't be alive by the time their schemes come to fruition.That's the level of focus and dedication towards their cause that these enemiesof humanity have displayed. But the rapid reshaping of human society in the pasttwo decades is inconsistent with their calmly-calculated methods. The recent andcurrent unleashing of such a huge arsenal of human-control measures smacks of adesperate attempt to head off humanity's conscious awakeningWe have the power, and we can withdraw our consent for their methods any time wechoose to. Without our acquiescence and approval, they're finished, and we getthe type of future we always should have had in harmony with the moral laws ofthe Universe. Lenon Honor expressed this sentiment in one of his 'GoodVibrations' interviews in 2013\"Now, I recognise that of course there are secret-societies and there areindividuals who have agendas. But ultimately, these things would not exist ifenough people recognised that there was no need for these things, and so wouldnot participate. In other words, they would not comply. They would not purchase,they would not support these different expressions of these dark, sinisteroccultic forces. In other words, the power that these forces have is given tothem by people. It's not that these forces have power in and of themselves –they have no more power than the human species has. But if the human speciesultimately gives the power to it, then it will have the power. In other words,it is an aspect of the degree to which this human species has externalised itspower. That's where the real problem is.\"All of the degrees of manipulation and mind-control that's going on, you canput it all together, and it still has very little relevance to me in my life interms of, I am ultimately the power within my life, and ultimately, the creatorof my human experience here.\"So with some individuals, you could say, oh, that person is asleep, they don'tknow what's taking place and they're all caught up in this entertainmentindustry, externalising power to Jay-Z or Beyonce or Rihanna or whoever. But itcan also be applied to the individuals who get so accustomed to analysis as tothe dark, sinister occult forces. Because an individual is not focusing on whatcan they do individually to refine their internal condition so that they canultimately create something different.\"And on a later 'Alchemy Radio' podcast with host John Gibbons, Lenon expandedupon the internalisation-of-power dynamic. This, combined with the example of alife lived in line with truth and morality, is what's needed to arm the nextgeneration with the personal tools that will be necessary to overcome thetyranny that will be attempted against them. The solutions lie in our thoughts,emotions and actions, in balance, on a mass collective scale.\"You should be refining yourself day-by-day as a man or as a woman, working onthe thoughts that you keep, the words that you speak and the actions that youtake . . . In other words, if you have all these negative thoughts, you'reworried about The Illuminati, you're worried about reptilian shapeshifters,you're worried about global bankers, and on and on and on . . . it's going tohave an adverse effect on you, because you're always externalising power . . . \"So it's one thing to identify those things, yes, but what's the next step? Wellnow, you have to internalise to where you begin to take power of your owndestiny. And not only your own destiny, but for future generations, and that'swhy for positive relationships, that's key . . . \"It should always be about Truth. Speaking Truth. Living Truth. Living anethically and morally just lifestyle. And in a positive relationship, you havetwo people doing that. So into that situation, children are being born andraised into this dynamic now.\"In my 2014 interview with him, British activist Tony Z mused on the sheerresilience of the human spirit to still be able to access higher consciousnessin spite of the very best plans that have been laid to keep it locked down.\"Energy, as in the zero-point stuff, is actually consciousness. In other words,if we have access to free energy, we have access to coherence and consciousness,and when we get access to consciousness, nothing can be hidden. So everythingbecomes revealed. And that's the biggest thing that they're frightened of.\"So what they've needed to do has been to use fluoride, Aspartame, mobilephones, HAARP and all the other frequency-generation systems, to destroy anycoherence, to set up a situation whereby the fluoride, for instance, willinterfere with your pineal gland to stop it from accessing your higher-self, andexpanded consciousness. Because it's in that way that they destroy our abilityto understand what's going on. They lie to us, they change all the physics, theycome out with false histories, they programme you through television, they giveyou GMOs, vaccines, all these things to destroy coherence. And what we'veactually managed to do is come out the other end still retaining consciousnesseven after all of their efforts!\"It's sobering to reflect that the adults living in the world today, are thegeneration that will decide the future course of humanity. It's our actions andresponses that will determine the type of world our children and all futuregenerations will have to live in. Are we up to the job?In summing up, and expressing what needs to occur, I can't put it better thanthe brilliant Matt Hancock, writing for the Check The Evidence blog site,(www.checktheevidence.co.uk [http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk]):\"Collectively, we are inside a burning house, and rather than getting everybodyout and safe, we are voting for the next fire-starter. Collectively, we arewasting time and energy on trivia and authorised pastimes, like walking aroundwith our faces in our cellphones, (self-owns,) and Tweeting away like a bird ona wire. While the banksters continue to go unpunished for plundering the public,homelessness, (and increasingly, poverty in general,) is being criminalised. Itis madness. Collectively, our toleration of this inhuman control system isinsane.\"But the Universe will help those who work according to their life’s purpose, soit can and will help many more of us. It is my view that this process can onlyreally be interfered with if we allow somebody else to be the middle-man for us,to provide us with pre-packaged beliefs or world-views, or counterfeitsynchronicities in the form of Predictive Programming . . . or any other kind ofcunning deceit from the control system in general.\"The authorised controlled opposition (mis)leaders are there to derail us, tointerfere with our natural process of realising truth. They have chosen theirpath, but we are not obliged to give them any attention whatsoever. Theindividual mind is one of the greatest gifts imaginable, therefore one of thegreatest crimes is to steal the ability of that mind to perceive reality. But ina stroke of evil genius, we have been manipulated into giving away our abilityto perceive reality. We give it away willingly by listening to liars, believingthat they have our best interests at heart simply because, as normal humanbeings, we would never stoop so low. This is terminally naive and it has tostop.\"We are in a global war right now – an information war, a war on the mind, aspiritual war. Participation in this war is essential, in vast numbers. We needmillions upon millions of people to come together and put an end to thisinsanity, this psychopathic control system, this evil. It won’t happen overnight– that simply isn’t possible – but it can happen over time. The more peoplethere are speaking out, the more likely it is that new people will listen andstart to reject the control system they had never previously recognised, andthen start to speak out themselves.\"This is a recipe for exponential growth. The hardest part was always going tobe getting the immovable object moving. But that has already begun thanks to amultitude of brilliant and selfless human beings, many of whom are no longerwith us – at least not here in the realm where spirit meets matter. Thanks tothe integrity and the diligence of such people, there is a window of opportunityhere, now, like never before. We must take full advantage.\"The alternative is the assisted suicide of the entire human race.\"We can have a paradise over a prison-planet, human freedom over slavery andtyranny, any time we collectively choose. One man or woman can't change theworld, but they can be an essential component in the process that does. Imaginea person sat alone at home reflecting on how little difference theircontribution would make to changing anything. Now imagine 100,000 other peopleeach sitting alone at home thinking the exact same thought. Also, imagine theripple effect if each person coming to an understanding of great truths impartedthis knowledge to just one other person in an 'each one teach one' fashion, thenthat person imparted it to just one other, and so on . . . The fork in the road has never been more blatant. In one direction lies anightmare society ruled by tyranny, oppression and perpetual slavery. In theother, lies a future where humanity finally takes back the reins from the forceof evil that's been controlling it for thousands of years. We're hurtling evercloser to this final choice by the day – as a glance at any mainstream newsbulletin reminds us – and if the former is allowed to become reality, the futureit will bring can be barely be contemplated. How would we explain to ourchildren and grandchildren that we did nothing to prevent it? We still have thatopportunity to achieve the latter, however, and it's those of us here today thatwill decide. No-one else. As Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway To Heaven' puts it:'There’s still time to change the road you’re on.'Only one question remains, therefore: How much do we want it?"},{"pageContent":"RESOURCES:Mark Passio's hugely detailed website: * www.whatonearthishappening.com [http://www.whatonearthishappening.com]Max Igan's website: * www.thecrowhouse.com [http://www.thecrowhouse.com]Check The Evidence blog site: Everything But The Kitchen Synch:Part 1: * http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk/cms//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=399&Itemid=76 [http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk/cms//index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=399&Itemid=76]Part 2: * http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=400&Itemid=76 [http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=400&Itemid=76]Part 3: * http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=401&Itemid=76 [http://www.checktheevidence.co.uk/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=401&Itemid=76]"},{"pageContent":"THE SOUND OF FREEDOMTSOF is a free, fortnightly showcase of conscious music, old and new, compiledby Mark Devlin.
