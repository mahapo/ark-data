A golden age it was, when Man lived with his Creato r in the Garden of Eden—Man tending the wonderful orchard, God taking strolls in the afternoon breeze. \"And the Lord God caused to grow from the ground every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good f or eating; and the Tree of Life was in the orchard, and the Tree of Knowing go od and evil. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from ther e it was parted and became four principal streams: the name of the firs t is Pishon . . . and of the second Gihon . . . and of the third Tigris . . . an d the fourth river is the Euphrates.\" Of the fruit of every tree were Adam and Eve permit ted to eat—except of the fruit of the Tree of Knowing. But once they did (tempted by the Serpent)—the Lord God grew concerned over the matte r of Immortality: Then did the Lord Yahweh say: \"Behold, the Adam has become as one of us to know good and evil; And now might he not put forth his hand and partake also of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever?\" And the Lord Yahweh expelled the Adam from the Garden of Eden . . . And He placed at the east of the Garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the Flaming Sword which revolveth , to guard the way to the Tree of Life. So was Man cast out of the very place where eternal life was within his grasp. But though barred from it, he has never ceas ed to remember it, to yearn for it, and to try to reach it.

Th roughout the ages, the 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"2 The Stairway to Heaven Search for Paradise was the realm of the individual ; but earlier in this millennium, it was launched as the national enterpr ise of mighty kingdoms. The New World was discovered—so have we been led to believe—when explorers went seeking a new, maritime route to Ind ia and her wealth. True—but not the whole truth: for what Ferdinand an d Isabel, king and queen of Spain, had desired most to find was the Fo untain of Eternal Youth: a magical fountain whose waters rejuvenate the old and keep one young forever, for it springs from a well in Paradise. No sooner had Columbus and his men set foot in what they all thought were the islands off India (the \"West Indies\"), tha n they combined the exploration of the new lands with a search for the legendary Fountain whose waters \"made old men young again.\" Captured \"Indian s\" were questioned, even tortured, by the Spaniards, so that they would reveal the secret location of the Fountain. One who excelled in such investigations was Ponce d e Leon, a profes- sional soldier and adventurer, who rose through the ranks to become governor of the part of the island of Hispaniola no w called Haiti, and of Puerto Rico. In 1511, he witnessed the interrogatio n of some captured Indians, Describing their island, they spoke of its pearls and other riches. They also extolled the marvelous virtues of its wat ers. A spring there is, they said, of which an islander \"grievously oppress ed with old age\" had drunk. As a result, he \"brought home manly strength and has practiced all manly performances, having taken a wife again and b egotten children.\" Listening with mounting excitement, Ponce de Leon—h imself an aging man—was convinced that the Indians were describing the miraculous Fountain of the rejuvenating waters. Their postscri pt, that the old man who drank of the waters regained his manly strength, co uld resume practicing \"all manly performances,\" and even took again a you ng wife who bore him children—was the most conclusive aspect of their ta le. For in the court of Spain, as throughout Europe, there hung numerous pa intings by the greatest painters, and whenever they depicted love scenes or sexual allegories, they included in the scene a fountain. Perhaps the most famous of such paintings, Titian's Love Sacred and Love Pr ofane, was created at about the time the Spaniards were on their quest in the Indies. As everyone well knew, the Fountain in the paintings hinted at the ultimate lovemaking; the Fountain whose waters make possible \"all manly performances\" through Eternal Youth. Ponce de Leon's report to King Ferdinand is reflect ed in the records kept by the official court historian, Peter Martyr de An gleria. As stated in his Decade de Orbe Novo [Decades of the New World], the Indians who had come from the islands of Lucayos or the Bahamas, ha d revealed that \"there is an island ... in which there is a perennial spri ng of running water of such marvelous virtue, that the waters thereof being dru nk, perhaps with some diet, make old men young again.\" Many researches, s uch as Ponce de Leon's Fountain of Youth: History of a Geographical Myth by Leonardo"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In Search of Paradise 3 Olschki, have established that \"the Fountain of You th was the most popular and characteristic expression of the emotions and e xpectations which agitated the conquerors of the New World.\" Undoubte dly, Ferdinand the king of Spain was one of those so agitated, so expe ctant for the definitive news. So, when word came from Ponce de Leon, Ferdinand lo st little time. He at once granted Ponce de Leon a Patent of Discovery (dated February 23, 1512), authorizing an expedition from the island of Hispaniola northward. The admiralty was ordered to assist Ponce de Leon a nd make available to him the best ships and seamen, so that he might dis cover without delay the island of \"Beininy\" (Bimini). The king made one con dition explicit: \"that after having reached the island and learned what is in it, you shall send me a report of it.\" In March 1513, Ponce de Leon set out northward, to look for the island of Bimini. The public excuse for the expedition was a search for \"gold and other metals\"; the true aim was to find the Fountai n of Eternal Youth. This the seamen soon learnt as they came upon not one is land but hundreds of islands in the Bahamas. Anchoring at island after i sland, the landing parties were instructed to search not for gold but for some unusual fountain. The waters of each stream were tasted and drunk—but wit h no evident effects On Easter Sunday—Pasca de Flares by its Spanish nam e—a long coastline was sighted. Ponce de Leon called the \"island\" Flor ida. Sailing along the coast and landing again and again, he and his men s earched the jungled forests and drank the waters of endless springs. Bu t none seemed to work the expected miracle. The mission's failure appears to have hardly dampen ed the conviction that the Fountain was undoubtedly there: it only ha d to be discovered. More Indians were questioned. Some seemed unusually young for the old ages claimed by them. Others repeated legends that confirmed the existence of the Fountain. One such legend (as reco unted in Creation Myths of Primitive America by J. Curtin) relates th at when Olelbis, \"He Who Sits Above,\" was about to create Mankind, he se nt two emissaries to Earth to construct a ladder which would connect Ear th and Heaven. Halfway up the ladder, they were to set up a restin g place, with a pool of pure drinking waters. At the summit, they were to c reate two springs: one for drinking and the other for bathing. When a man or woman grows old, said Olelbis, let him or her climb up to this summi t, and drink and bathe; whereupon his youth shall be restored. The conviction that the Fountain existed somewhere on the islands was so strong that in 1514—the year after Ponce de Leon 's unfruitful mission— Peter Martyr (in his Second Decade) informed Pope L eo X as follows: At a distance of 325 leagues from Hispaniola, they tell, there is an island called Boyuca, alias Ananeo, which—accor ding to those who"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4 The Stairway to Heaven explored its interior—has such an extraordinary fou ntain that drinking of its waters rejuvenates the old. And let Your Holiness not think this to be said lig htly or rashly; for they have spread word of this as the truth througho ut the court, so formally that the whole people, not few of whom are from among those whom wisdom or fortune distinguished from the commo n people, hold it to be true. Ponce de Leon, undaunted, concluded after some addi tional research that what he had to look for was a spring in conjun ction with a river, the two possibly connected by a hidden underground tunnel. If the Fountain was on an island, was its source a river in Florida? In 1521, the Spanish Crown sent Ponce de Leon on a renewed search, this time focusing on Florida. There can be no doub t regarding the true purpose of his mission: writing only a few decades later, the Spanish historian Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas stated t hus in his Historia General de las Indias: \"He (Ponce de Leon) went see king that Sacred Fountain, so renowned among the Indians, as well as the river whose waters rejuvenated the aged.\" He was intent on find ing the spring of Bimini and the river in Florida, of which the Indians of C uba and Hispaniola \"affirmed that old persons bathing themselves in th em became young again.\" Instead of Eternal Youth, Ponce de Leon found death by an Indian arrow. And although the individual search for a pot ion or lotion that can postpone the Last Day may never end, the organized search, under a royal decree, did come to an end. Was the search futile to begin with? Were Ferdinand and Isabel and Ponce de Leon, and the men who sailed and died in search of the Fountain, all fools childishly believing in some primitive fairy tales? Not the way they saw it. The Holy Scriptures, pagan beliefs, and the documented tales of great travelers, all combined t o affirm that there was indeed a place whose waters (or fruits' nectars) co uld bestow Immortality by keeping one forever young. There were still current olden tales—left from the times when the Celts were in the peninsula—of a secret place, a secret f ountain, a secret fruit or herb whose finder shall be redeemed of death. There was the goddess Idunn, who lived by a sacred brook and who kept mag ical apples in her coffer. When the gods grew old, they would come to her to eat of the apples, whereupon they turned young again. Indeed, \"Idunn\" meant \"Again Young\"; and the apples that she guarded were called the \"Elixir of the Gods.\" Was this an echo of the legend of Herakles (Hercule s) and his twelve"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In Search of Paradise 5 labors? A priestess of the god Apollo, predicting h is travails in an oracle, had also assured him: \"When this shall be done, tho u shalt become one of the Immortals.\" To achieve this, the last but one l abor was to seize and bring back from the Hesperides the divine golden ap ples. The Hes- perides—\"Daughters of the Evening Land\"—resided at the Ends of Earth. Have not the Greeks, and then the Romans, left behi nd them tales of mortals immortalized? The god Apollo anointed the b ody of Sarpedon, so that he lived the life of several generations of me n. The goddess Aphrodite granted to Phaon a magic potion; anointing himself with it, he turned into a beautiful youth \"who wakened love in the hearts of all the women of Lesbos.\" And the child Demophon, anointed with ambr osia by the goddess Demeter, would surely have become immortal were not his mother— ignorant of Demeter's identity—to snatch him away f rom the goddess. There was the tale of Tantalus, who had become immo rtal by eating at the gods' table and stealing their nectar and ambro sia. But having killed his son to serve his flesh as food for the gods, he was punished by being banished to a land of luscious fruits and waters—et ernally out of his reach. (The god Hermes restored the butchered son to life. ) On the other hand, Odysseus, offered Immortality by the nymph Calypso if only he would stay with her forever, forsook Immortality for a chance to return to his home and wife. And was not there the tale of Glaukos, a mortal, an ordinary fisherman, who became a sea-god? One day he observed that a fi sh that he had caught, coming in touch with a herb, came back to life and leaped back into the water. Taking the herb into his mouth, Glaukos jump ed into the water at the exact same spot; whereupon the sea-gods Okeanos and Tethys admitted him to their circle and transformed him into a deit y. The year 1492, in which Columbus set sail from Spai n, was also the year in which the Muslim occupation of the Iberian Penin sula ended with the surrender of the Moors at Granada. Throughout the n early eight centuries of Muslim and Christian contention over the peninsu la, the interaction of the two cultures was immense; and the tale in the K oran (the Muslim holy book) of the Fish and the Fountain of Life was know n to Moor and Catholic alike. The fact that the tale was almost identical to the Greek legend of Glaukos the fisherman, was taken as confirmation of its authenticity. It was one of the reasons for seeking the legendary Founta in in India—the land which Columbus had set out to reach, and which he t hought he had reached. The segment in the Koran which contains the tale is the eighteenth Sura. It relates the exploration of various mysteries by Moses, the biblical hero of the Israelite Exodus from Egypt. While Moses was be ing groomed for his new calling as a Messenger of God, he was to be ins tructed in such knowledge as he still lacked by a mysterious \"Serva nt of God.\" Accom- panied by only one attendant, Moses was to go find this enigmatic teacher"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6 The Stairway to Heaven with the aid of a single clue: he was to take with him a dried fish; the place where the fish would jump and disappear would be th e place where he would meet the teacher. After much searching in vain, the attendant of Mose s suggested that they stop and give up the search. But Moses persisted, s aying that he would not give up until they reached \"the junction of the two streams.\" Unnoticed by them, it was there that the miracle happened: But when they reached the Junction, they forgot about their fish, which took its course through the stream, as in a tunnel. After journeying further, Moses said to his attenda nt: \"Bring us our early meal.\" But the attendant replied that the fish was gone: \"When we betook ourselves to the rock, sawest thou what had happened? I did indeed forget about the fish— Satan made me forget to tell you about it: It took its course through the stream, in a marvelous way. And Moses said: \"That was what we were seeking after.\" The tale in the Koran (Fig. 1) of the dried fish th at came to life and swam back to the sea through a tunnel, went beyond the p arallel Greek tale by relating itself not to a simple fisherman, but to t he venerated Moses. Also, it presented the incident not as a chance discovery , but as an occurrence premediated by the Lord, who knew of the location o f the Waters of Life— waters that could be recognized through the medium of the resurrection of a dead fish. As devout Christians, the king and queen of Spain m ust have accepted literally the vision described in the Book of Revel ation, \"of a pure river of Water of Life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God. ... In the midst of the street of it, and on either side o f the river, was there the Tree of Life, with twelve manner of fruit.\" They mu st have believed in the Book's promises: \"I will give unto him that is athi rst of the Fountain of the Water of Life\"—\"I will give to eat of the Tree of L ife which is the midst of the Paradise of God.\" And could they not be aware o f the words of the biblical Psalmist: Thou givest them to drink of thy Stream of Eternities; For with thee is the Fountain of Life."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"60.

The eighteenth Sura of the Koran seemed to offer so me important clues. It goes on to relate the three paradoxes of life th at Moses was shown once he located the Servant of God. Then the same sectio n of the Koran continues to describe three other episodes: first, about a visit to a land where the Sun sets; then to a land where the Sun ri ses—that is, in the east; and finally to a land beyond the second land, where the mythical people of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 The Stairway to Heaven Gog and Magog (the biblical contenders at the End o f Days) were causing untold mischief on Earth. To put an end to this tro uble, the hero of the tale, here named Du-al'karnain (\"Possessor of the Two Hor ns\"), filled up the pass between two steep mountains with blocks of iro n and poured over them molten lead, creating such an awesome barrier that even the mighty Gog and Magog were powerless to scale it. Separated , the two could cause no more hardship on Earth. The word Karnain, in Arabic as in Hebrew, means bot h Double Horns and Double Rays. The three additional episodes, fol lowing immediately after the tale of the Mysteries of Moses, thus appe ar to retain as their hero Moses, who could well have been nicknamed Du-al'kar nain because his face \"was with rays\"—radiated—after he had come down fro m Mount Sinai, where he had met the Lord face to face. Yet popular medieval beliefs attributed the epithet and the journeys to the thre e lands to Alexander the Great, the Macedonian king who in the fourth centur y B.C. conquered most of the ancient world, reaching as far as India. This popular belief, interchanging Moses and Alexan der, stemmed from traditions concerning the conquests and adventures of Alexander the Great. These included not only the feat in the land of Gog and Magog, but also an identical episode of a dry, dead fish that came bac k to life when Alexander and his cook had found the Fountain of Life! The reports concerning Alexander's adventures that were current in Europe and the Near East in medieval times were bas ed upon the supposed writings of the Greek historian Callisthenes of Oly nthus. He was appointed by Alexander to record the exploits, triumphs and a dventures of his Asiastic expedition; but he died in prison, having offended Alexander, and his writings have mysteriously perished. Centuries late r, however, there began to circulate in Europe a Latin text purporting to b e a translation of the lost original writings of Callisthenes. Scholars speak o f this text as \"pseudo- Callisthenes.\" For many centuries it was believed that the many tr anslations of the Exploits of Alexander that were current in Europe a nd the Middle East, all stemmed from this Latin pseudo-Callisthenes. But it was later discovered that other, parallel versions existed in many langu ages—including Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, Syriac, Armenian and Ethiopic—as w ell as at least three versions in Greek. The various versions, some traci ng their origins to Alexandria of the second century B.C., differ here and there; but by and large, their overwhelming similarities do indicate a common source— perhaps the writings of Callisthenes after all, or— as is sometimes claimed— copies of Alexander's letters to his mother Olympia s and to his teacher Aristotle. The miraculous adventures with which we are concern ed began after Alexander completed the conquest of Egypt. From the texts it is neither clear in which direction Alexander set his course, nor is it certain that the episodes are arranged in an accurate chronological or geographical order."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"In Search of Paradise 9 One of the very first episodes, however, may explai n the popular confusion between Alexander and Moses: apparently Alexander a ttempted to leave Egypt as Moses did, by parting the waters and getti ng his followers to cross the sea on foot. Reaching the sea, Alexander decided to part it by b uilding in its midst a wall of molten lead, and his masons \"continued to p our lead and molten matter into the water until the structure rose abov e its surface. Then he built upon it a tower and a pillar, upon which he c arved his own figure, having two horns upon his head.\" And he wrote upon the monument: \"Whosoever hath come into this place and would sail over the sea, let him know that I have shut it up.\" Having thus shut out the waters, Alexander and his men began to cross the sea. As a precaution, however, they sent ahead some prisoners. But as they reached the tower in the midst of the waters, \"the waves of the sea leapt up upon them (the prisoners) and the sea swal lowed them up and they all perished. . . . When the Two-Horned One saw thi s, he was afraid of the sea with a mighty fear,\" and gave up the attempt to emulate Moses. Eager, however, to discover the \"darkness\" on the o ther side of the sea, Alexander made several detours, during which he pur portedly visited the sources of the river Euphrates and of the river Tig ris, studying there \"the secrets of the heavens and the stars and the planet s.\" Leaving his troops behind, Alexander returned towar d the Land of Darkness, reaching a mountain named Mushas at the e dge of the desert. After several days of marching, he saw \"a straight path which had no wall, and it had no high and no low place in it.\" He left his few trusted companions and proceeded alone. After a journey of twelve days and twelve nights, \"he perceived the radiance of an angel\"; bu t as he drew nearer, the angel was \"a flaming fire.\" Alexander realized that he had reached \"the mountain from which the whole world is surrounded.\" The angel was no less puzzled than Alexander. \"Who art thou, and for what reason art thou here, O mortal?\" the angel ask ed, and wondered how Alexander had managed \"to penetrate into this darkn ess, which no other man hath been able to do.\" To which Alexander repli ed that God himself had guided him and gave him strength to \"have arriv ed in this place, which is Paradise.\" To convince the reader that Paradise, rather than H ell, was reachable through underground passages, the ancient author th en introduced a long discourse between the angel and Alexander on matter s of God and Man. The angel then urged Alexander to return to his fri ends; but Alexander persisted in seeking answers to the mysteries of He aven and Earth, God and Men. In the end Alexander said that he would le ave only if he were granted something that no man had ever obtained bef ore. Complying, \"the angel said unto him: I will tell thee something whe reby thou mayest live and not die.\" The Two-Horned said: 'Say on.' And th e angel said unto him:"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 The Stairway to Heaven In the land of Arabia, God hath set the blackness o f solid darkness, wherein is hidden a treasury of this knowledge. The re too is the fountain of water which is called \"The Water of Life\"; and w hosoever drinketh therefrom, if it be but a single drop, shall never die. The angel attributed other magical powers to these Waters of Life, such as \"the power of flying through the heavens, even a s the angels fly.\" Needing no further prompting, Alexander anxiously i nquired: \"In which quarter of the earth is this fountain of water situ ated?\" \"Ask those men who are heirs to the knowledge thereof,\" was the angel' s enigmatic answer. Then the angel gave Alexander a cluster of grapes w hereby to feed his troops. Returning to his companions, Alexander told his col leagues of his adventure and gave them each a grape. But \"as he pl ucked off from the cluster, another grew in its place.\" And so did one cluster feed all the soldiers and their beasts. Alexander then began to make inquiries of all the l earned men he could find. He asked the sages: \"Have you ever read in yo ur books that God hath a place of darkness of which knowledge is hidden, a nd that the Fountain which is called the 'Fountain of Life' is situated therein?\" The Greek versions have him search the Ends of Earth for the right savant; the Ethiopic versions suggest that the sage was right t here, among his troops. His name was Matun, and he knew the ancient writing s. The place, he said, \"lieth nigh unto the sun when it rises on the right side.\" Scarcely more informed by such riddles, Alexander p ut himself in the hands of his guide. They again went into a Place of Darkness. After journeying for a long time, Alexander got tired and sent Matun ahead by himself, to find the right path. To help him see in the darkness, Alexander gave him a stone which was given him earlier under miraculous circum- stances by an ancient king who was living among the gods—a stone which was brought out of Paradise by Adam when he left it , and which was heavier than any other substance on Earth. Matun, though careful to follow the path, eventuall y lost his way. He then produced the magical stone and put it down; wh en it touched the ground, it emitted light. By the light, Matun saw a well. He was not yet aware that he had chanced upon the Fountain of Life . The Ethiopic version describes what ensued: Now, he had with him a dried fish, and being exceed ingly hungry he went down with it to the water, that he might wash it therein and make it ready for cooking. . . . But behold, as soon as the fish touched the water, it swam away. \"When Matun saw this, he stripped his clothes and w ent down into the"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"In Search of Paradise 11 water after the fish, and found it to be alive in t he water.'' Realizing that this was the \"Well of the Water of Life,\" Matun washed h imself in the waters and drank thereof. When he had come up from the wel l, he was no longer hungry nor did he have any worldly care, for he had become El-Khidr— \"the Evergreen\"—the one who was Forever Young. Returning to the encampment, he said nothing of his discovery to Alexander (whom the Ethiopic version calls \"He of t he Two Horns\"). Then Alexander himself resumed the search, groping for t he right way in the darkness. Suddenly, he saw the stone (left behind b y Matun) \"shining in the darkness; (and) now it had two eyes, which sent for th rays of light.\" Realizing that he had found the right path, Alexand er rushed ahead, but was stopped by a voice which admonished him for his ever-increasing ambitions, and prophesied that instead of attaining eternal life he would soon bite the dust. Terrified. Alexander returned to his companions and his troops, giving up the search. According to some versions, it was a bird with huma n features who spoke to Alexander and made him turn back when he reached a place \"inlaid widi sapphires and emeralds and jacinths.\" In Alexander' s purported letter to his mother, there were two bird-men who blocked his way . In the Greek version of pseudo-Callisthenes, it was Andreas, the cook of Alexander, who took the dried fish to wash it in a fountain \"whose waters flashed with lightnings.\" As the fish touched the w ater, it became alive and slipped out of the cook's hands. Realizing what he had found, the cook drank of the waters and took some in a silver bowl— but told no one of his discovery. When Alexander (in this version, he was accompanied by 360 men) continued the search, they reached a place tha t shined though there were neither Sun nor Moon nor stars to be seen. The way was blocked by two birds with human features. \"Go back!\" one of them ordered Alexander, \"for the land on which you stand belongs to God alone. Go back, O wretched one , for in the Land of the Blessed you cannot set foot!\" Shuddering with f ear, Alexander and his men turned back; but before they left the place, th ey took as souvenirs some of its soil and stones. After several days' ma rching, they came out of the Land of Everlasting Night; and when they reache d light, they saw that the \"soil and stones\" they picked up were in fact p earls, precious stones and nuggets of gold. Only then did the cook tell Alexander of the fish t hat came to life, but still kept it a secret that he himself had drunk of the w aters and that he had kept some of it. Alexander was furious and hit him, and banished him from the camp. But the cook wished not to leave alone, for h e had fallen in love with a daughter of Alexander. So he revealed his secret to her, and gave her to drink of the waters. When Alexander found that out, he banished her too: \"You have become a godly being, having become immor tal,\" he told her; therefore, he said, you cannot live among men—go li ve in the Land of the"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 The Stairway to Heaven Blessed. And as for the cook—him Alexander threw in to the sea, with a stone around his neck. But instead of drowning, the cook became the sea- demon Andrentic. \"And thus,\" we are told, \"ends the tale of the Cook and the Maiden.\" To the learned advisers of Europe's medieval kings and queens, the various versions only served to confirm both the antiquity and the authenticity of the legend of Alexander and the Fountain of Life. B ut where, O where were these magical waters located? Were they indeed across the border of Egypt, in the Sinai peninsula— the arena of the activities of Moses? Were they clo se to the area where the Euphrates and Tigris rivers begin to flow, somewher e north of Syria? Did Alexander go to the Ends of Earth—India—to find the Fountain, or did he embark on those additional conquests after he was t urned back from it? As the medieval scholars strove to unravel the puzz le, new works on the subject from Christian sources began to shape a con sensus in favor of India. A Latin composition named Alexander Magni Inter Ad Paradisum, a Syriac Homilie of Alexander by Bishop Jakob of Sarug, the Recension of Josippon in Armenian—complete with the tale of the tunnel, t he man-like birds, the magical stone—placed the Land of Darkness or the Mo untains of Darkness at the Ends of Earth. There, some of these writings said, Alexander took a boat ride on the Ganges Biver, which was none other than the Pishon Biver of Paradise. There, in India (or on an island offsh ore), did Alexander reach the Gates of Paradise. As these conclusions were taking shape in Europe of the Middle Ages, new light was shed on the subject from a wholly une xpected source. In the year 1145, the German bishop Otto of Freising repor ted in his Chronicon a most astonishing episde. The Pope, he reported, had received a letter from a Christian ruler of India, whose existence had bee n totally unknown until then. And that king had affirmed in his letter that the Biver of Paradise was indeed located in his realm. Bishop Otto of Freising named as the intermediary, through whom the Pope had received the epistle, Bishop Hugh of Gebal , a town on the Mediterranean coast of Syria. The ruler, it was rep orted, was named John the Elder or, being a priest, Prester John. He was reputedly a lineal descendant of the Magi who had visited Christ the c hild. He defeated the Muslim kings of Persia, and formed a thriving Chris tian kingdom in the lands of the Ends of Earth. Nowadays, some scholars consider the whole affair t o have been a forgery for propaganda purposes. Others believe tbat the re ports which reached the Pope were distortions of events that were really ha ppening. The Christian world at the time, having launched the Crusades aga inst Muslim rule over the Near East (including the Holy Land) fifty years earlier, met with a crushing defeat at Edessa in 1144. But at the Ends of Earth Mongol rulers began to storm the gates of the Muslim empire, and in 1141 defeated the"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"14 The Stairway to Heaven carried the tale far and wide, the versions became increasingly specific on this point: not only the appearance, but also the m anhood and virility of the aged soldiers were restored to youthfulness. But how does one get to this Fountain, if the route to India is blocked by the heathen Muslims? On and off, the Popes attempted to communicate with the enigmatic Prester John, \"the illustrious and magnificent king of the Indies and beloved son of Christ.\" In 1245, Pope Innocent IV d ispatched the Friar Giovanni da Pian del Carpini, via southern Russia, to the Mongol ruler or Khan, believing the Mongols to be Nestorians (an of fshoot of the Eastern Orthodox Church) and the Khan to be Prester John. I n 1254, the Armenian ruler-priest Haithon traveled in disguise through e astern Turkey to the camp of the Mongol chieftain in southern Russia. Th e record of his adventurous travels mentioned that his way took him via the narrow pass on the shores of the Caspian Sea called The Iron Gates ; and the speculation that his route resembled that of Alexander the Grea t (who had poured molten iron to close a mountain pass) only served t o suggest that the Ends of Earth, the Gates of Paradise, could indeed be so reached. These and other papal and royal emissaries were soo n joined by private adventurers, such as the brothers Nicolo and Maffeo Polo and the former's son Marco Polo (1260-1295), and the German knight W illiam of Boldensele (1336)—all searching for the kingdom of Prester Joh n. While their travelogues kept up the interest of Chu rch and Courts, it was once again the fate of a popular literary work to r ekindle mass interest. Its author introduced himself as \"I, John Maundeville, Knight,\" born in the town of St. Albans in England who \"passed the sea i n the year of our Lord Jesus 1322.\" Writing at the end of his travels thir ty-four years later. Sir John explained that he had therein \"set down the wa y to the Holy Land, and to Hierusalem: as also to the lands of the Grea t Caan, and of Prester John: to Inde, and divers other countries: together with many and strange marvels therein.\" In the twenty-seventh chapter, captioned \"Of the Ro yal Estate of Prester John,\" the book (The Voyages and Travels of Sir Joh n Maundeville, Knight) states: This emperor, Prester John, possesses very extensiv e territory, and has many noble cities and good towns in his realm, and many great and large isles. For all the country of India is divided into isles, by the great floods that come from Paradise. . . . And this land is full good and rich. . . . In the lan d of Prester John are many divers things and many precious stones, so gre at and so large, that men make thereof plates, dishes, cups etc.... Sir John went on to describe the River of Paradise:"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"In Search of Paradise 15 In his country is the sea called the Gravelly Sea. . . . Three days from that sea are great mountains, out of which runs a g reat river which comes from Paradise, and it is full of precious stones, w ithout a drop of water, and it runs through the desert, on one side, so tha t it makes the Gravelly Sea where it ends. Beyond the River of Paradise, there was \"a great is le, long and broad, called Milsterak,\" that was a paradise on Earth. It had \"the fairest garden that might be imagined; and therein were trees bear ing all manner of fruits, all kinds of herbs of virtue and of good smell.\" Th is paradise, Sir John states, had marvelous pavilions and chambers, the p urpose of which was diverse sexual enjoyment, all the work of a rich an d devilish man. Having fired the imagination (and greed) of his rea ders with the tales of precious stones and other riches, Sir John now play ed on the men's sexual desires. The place, he wrote, was filled with \"the fairest damsels that might be found under the age of fifteen years, and the fa irest young striplings that men might get of that same age, and they were all c lothed richly in clothes of gold; and he said that they were angels.\" And th e devilish man— Had also caused to be made three fair and noble wel ls, all surrounded with stone of jasper and crystal, diapered with gol d, and set with precious stones and great Orient pearls. And he had made a c onduit under the earth, so that the three wells, at his will, should run one with milk, another with wine, and another with honey. And that place he called Paradise. To that place, the crafty man lured \"good knights, hardy and noble,\" and after entertaining them he persuaded them to go and kill his enemies; telling them that they should not fear being slain, for should they die, they would be resurrected and rejuvenated; After their death they should come to his Paradise, and they should be of the age of the damsels, and they should play with t hem. And after that he would put them in a fairer Paradise, where they sho uld see the God of Nature visibly, in his majesty and bliss. But that, said John Maundeville, was not the real P aradise of biblical renown. That one, he said in Chapter XXX, lay beyon d the isles and lands which Alexander the Great had journeyed through. Th e route to it led farther east, toward two isles rich in gold and sil ver mines \"where the Red Sea separates from the Ocean Sea\": And beyond that land and isles, and deserts of Pres ter John's lordship, in going straight toward the east, men find nothing bu t mountains and great"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"16 The Stairway to Heaven rocks; and there is the dark region, where no man c an see, neither by day nor night. . . . And that desert, and that place of darkness, lasts from this coast unto Terrestrial Paradise, where Adam, our fi rst father, and Eve were put. It was from there that the waters of Paradise flowe d: And in the highest place of Paradise, exactly in th e middle, is a well that casts out the four streams, which run by diverse la nds, of which the first is called Pison, or Ganges, that runs through India , or Emlak, in which river are many precious stones, and much lignum alo es, and much sand of gold. And the other river is called Nile, or Gyson, w hich goes through Ethiopia, and after through Egypt. And the other is called Tigris, which runs by Assyr ia, and by Armenia the Great. And the other is called Euphrates, which runs throu gh Media, Armenia and Persia. Confessing that he himself had not reached this bib lical Garden of Eden, John Maundeville explained: \"No mortal man may appr oach to that place without special grace of God; so that of that place I can tell you no more.\" In spite of this admission, the many versions in ma ny languages that flowed from the English original maintained that th e knight had stated \"I, John de Maundeville, saw that Fountain and drank th ree times of that water with my companion, and since I drank I feel well.\" The fact that in the English version, Maundeville complained that he was sick with rheumatic gout and near the end of his days, mattered not to the many who were thrilled by the marvelous tales. Nor did it matter then, that scholars nowadays believe that \"Sir John Maundeville, Knight \" may in fact have been a French doctor who had never traveled, but ve ry skillfully put together a travelogue from the writings of others w ho did take the risk and trouble of journeying far and away. Writing about the visions that had motivated the ex ploration that led to the discovery of America, Angel Rosenblat (La Prime ra Vision de America y Otros Estudios) summed up the evidence thus: \"Along with the belief in the earthly Paradise was associated another desire of a messianic (or Faustic) nature; to find the Fountain of Eternal Youth. All the Middle Ages had dreamed of it. In the new images of the Lost Paradi se, the Tree of Life was converted into the Fountain of Life, and then into a River or Spring of Youth.\" The motivation was the conviction that \"the Fountain of Life came from India ... a Fountain that cured all ills and a ssured immortality. The fantastic John Maundeville had actually encountered it on his trip to India . . . in the Christian Kingdom of Prester John.\" To reach India and the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"In Search of Paradise 17 waters that flow from Paradise became \"a symbol of the eternal human desire for pleasure, youth and happiness.\" With the land routes blocked by enemies, the Christ ian kingdoms of Europe sought a sea route to India. Under Henry the Navigator, the kingdom of Portugal emerged in the middle of the fi fteenth century as the leading power in the race to reach the Orient by sa iling around Africa. In 1445, the Portuguese navigator Dinas Dias reached t he mouth of the Senegal River, and mindful of the voyage's purpose reported that \"men say it comes from the Nile, being one of the most glori ous rivers of Earth, flowing from the Garden of Eden and the earthly Par adise.\" Others followed, pushing to and around the Cape at the tip of the African continent. In 1499, Vasco da Gama and his fleet cir cumnavigated Africa and reached the cherished target: India. Yet the Portuguese, who had launched the Age of Dis covery, failed to win the race. Diligently studying the ancient maps and all the writings of those who had ventured east, an Italian-born seaman named Cristobal Colon concluded that by sailing west, he could reac h India by a sea route much shorter than the Eastern Route sought by the P ortuguese. Seeking a sponsor, he arrived at the court of Ferdinand and I sabel. He had with him (and took on his first voyage) an annotated copy of the Latin version of Marco Polo's book. He could also point to the writi ngs of John Maundeville, who explained a century and a half before Columbus (Colon) that by going to the farthest east, one arrives at the west \"on a ccount of the roundness of the earth ... for our Lord God made the earth all a round.\" In January 1492, Ferdinand and Isabel defeated the Muslims and expelled them from the Iberian Peninsula. Was it no t a divine sign to Spain, that what the Crusaders could not achieve, Spain wo uld? On August 3 of the same year, Columbus sailed under the Spanish fl ag to find a western sea route to India. On October 12, he sighted land. Unt il his death in 1506, he was sure that he had reached the islands which made up a great part of the legendary domain of Prester John. Two decades later, Ferdinand issued to Ponce de Leo n the Patent of Discovery, instructing him to find without delay th e rejuvenating waters. The Spaniards had thought that they were emulating Alexander the Great. Little did they know that they were followin g footsteps of far greater antiquity."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"II The Immortal Ancestors The short life of Alexander the Macedonian—he died at age thirty-three in Babylon—was filled with conquest, adventure, explor ation; a burning desire to reach the Ends of Earth, to unravel divin e mysteries. It was not an aimless search. Son of Queen Olympias and presumably of her husband King Philip II, he was tutored by the p hilosopher Aristotle in all manner of ancient wisdom. Then he witnessed qua rreling and divorce between his parents, leading to the flight of his m other with the young Alexander. There was reconciliation, then murder; t he assassination of Philip led to the crowning of Alexander when twenty years old. His early military expeditions brought h i m to Delphi, seat of the renowned oracle. There he heard the first of several prophesies pred icting for him fame—but a very short life. Undaunted, Alexander set out—as the Spaniards did n early 1,800 years later—to find the Waters of Life. To do so, he had to open the way to the East. It was from there that the gods had come: the great Zeus, who swam across the Mediterranean, from the Phoenician city of Tyre to the island of Crete; Aphrodite who also came from across the Medi terranean, via the island of Cyprus; Poseidon, who brought with him th e horse from Asia Minor; Athena, who carried to Creece the olive tree from the lands of western Asia. There, too, according to the Greek hi storians, whose writings Alexander studied, were the Waters which kept one f orever young. There was the history of Cambyses, son of the Persi an king Cyrus, who went by way of Syria, Palestine and the Sinai to at tack Egypt. Defeating the Egyptians, he treated them cruelly, and defiled the temple of their god Amnion. Then he took into his heart to go south and attack \"the long-lived Ethiopians.\" Describing the events, Herodotus—writi ng a century before Alexander—said (History, Book III); His spies went to Ethiopia, under the pretense of c arrying presents to the king, but in reality to take note of all they saw, and especially to observe whether there was really what is called \"The Table of the Sun\" in Ethiopia. . . . 18"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"Fig. 2 The World of Alexander "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"20 The Stairway to Heaven Telling the Ethiopian king that \"eighty years was t he longest term of man's life among the Persians,\" the spies/emissarie s questioned him regarding the rumored long life of the Ethiopians. Confirming this, The king led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil. And a scent came from the spring like that of violets. Returning to Cambyses, the spies described the wate r as \"so weak, that nothing would float on it, neither wood nor any lig hter substance, but all went to the bottom.\" And Herodotus noted the follow ing conclusion: If the account of this fountain be true, it would b e their (the Ethiopians') constant use of the water from it, which makes them so long-lived. The tale of the Fountain of Youth in Ethiopia, and of the violation by the Persian Cambyses of the temple of Ammon, had direct bearing on the history of Alexander. This concerned the rumors tha t he was not really the son of Philip, but the offspring of a union between his mother Olympias and the Egyptian god Ammon (Fig. 3). The strained relat ions between Philip and Olympias only served to confirm the suspicions. As related in various versions of pseudo-Callisthen es, the court of Philip was visited by an Egyptian Pharaoh whom the Greeks called Nectanebus. He was a master magician, a diviner; and he secretl y seduced Olympias. Unbeknown to her at the time, it was in reality the god Ammon who had come to her, taking the guise of Nectanebus. And so it was that when she bore Alexander, she gave birth to a son of a god. I t was the very god whose temple the Persian Cambyses had desecrated. Defeating the Persian armies in Asia Minor, Alexand er turned toward Egypt. Expecting heavy resistance by the Persian vi ceroys who ruled Egypt, he was astonished to see that great land fal l into his hands without any resistance: an omen, no doubt. Losing no time, Alexander went to the Great Oasis, seat of the oracle of Ammon, There, th e god himself (so legends say) confirmed Alexander's true parentage. Thus affirmed, the Egyptian priests deified him as a Pharaoh; thereby, his desire to escape a mortal's fate became not a privilege, but a right. (Henceforth, Alexander was depicted on his coins as a horned Zeus-Ammon—Fi g. 4.) Alexander then went south to Karnak, the center of the worship of Ammon. There was more to the trip than met the eye. A venerated religious center since the third millenium B.C., Ka rnak was a conglomera- tion of temples, shrines and monuments to Ammon bui lt by generations of Pharaohs. One of the most impressive and colossal s tructures was the temple built by Queen Hatshepsut more than a thousa nd years before Alexander's time. And she too was said to have been a daughter of the god Ammon, conceived by a queen whom the god had visite d in disguise!"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":" Fig. 3 Fig. 4 Whatever actually transpired there, no one really k nows. The fact is that instead of leading his armies back east, toward the heartland of the Persian empire, Alexander selected a small escort and a few companions for an expedition even farther south. His puzzled companio ns were led to believe that he was going on a pleasure trip—the pleasures of lovemaking. The uncharacteristic interlude was as incomprehensi ble to the historians of those days as to the generals of Alexander. Tryi ng to rationalize, the recorders of Alexander's adventures described the w oman he was about to visit as a femme fatale, one \"whose beauty no livin g man could praise sufficiently.\" She was Candace, queen of a land to the south of Egypt (today's Sudan). Reversing the tale of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, in this instance it was the king who traveled to the q ueen's land. For, unbeknown to his companions, Alexander was really s eeking not love, but the secret of Immortality. After a pleasant stay, the queen agreed to reveal t o Alexander, as a parting gift, the secret of \"the wonderful cave whe re the gods congregate.\" Following her directions, Alexander found the sacre d place: "},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"22 The Stairway to Heaven He entered with a few soldiers, and saw a starlit h aze. And the rooftops were shining, as if lit by stars. The external form s of the gods were physically manifest; a crowd was serving (them) in silence. At first he (Alexander) was frightened and surprise d. But he stayed to see what would happen, for he saw some reclining fi gures whose eyes were shining like beams of light. The sight of the \"reclining figures,\" with eyes emi tting beams of light, made Alexander stop short. Were they too gods, or d eified mortals? He was then startled by a voice: one of the \"figures\" had spoken up: And there was one who said: \"Glad greetings, Alexan der. Do you know who I am?\" And he (Alexander) said: \"No, my lord.\" The other said: \"I am Sesonchusis, the world-conque ring king who has joined the ranks of the gods.\" Alexander was far from being surprised—as though he had encountered the very person he had searched for. His arrival ap parently expected, Alexander was invited in, to \"the Creator and Overs eer of the entire universe.\" He \"went within, and saw a fire-bright h aze; and, seated on a throne, the god whom he had once seen worshipped by men in Rokotide, the Lord Serapis.\" (In the Greek version, it was th e god Dionysus.) Alexander saw his chance to bring up the matter of his longevity. \"Lord god,\" he said, \"how many years shall I live?\" But there was no answer from the god. Then Sesonchu sis sought to console Alexander, for the god's silence spoke for itself. Though I myself have joined the ranks of the gods, Sesonchusis said , \"I was not as fortunate as you ... for although I have conquered the whole world and subjugated so many peoples, nobody remembers rny name; but you shall have great renown . . . you will have an immortal name even af ter death.\" In this manner, he consoled Alexander. \"You shall live upon dying, thus not dying\"—immortalized by a lasting reputation. Disappointed, Alexander left the caves and \"continu ed the journey to be made\"—to seek the advice of other sages, to find an escape from a mortal's fate, to emulate others who before him did succeed in joining the immortal gods. According to one version, among those whom Alexande r searched out and met was Enoch, the biblical patriarch from the days before the Deluge, who was the great-grandfather of Noah. It was a pla ce of mountains, \"where Paradise, which is the Land of the Living, is situa ted,\" the \"abode where the saints dwell.\" Atop a mountain there was a glit tering structure, from which there extended skyward a huge stairway, made of 2,500 golden slabs. In a vast hall or cavern Alexander saw \"golden figu res, each standing in its"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Immortal Ancestors 23 niche,\" a golden altar, and two huge \"candlesticks\" measuring some sixty feet in height. Upon a couch nearby reclined the form of a man who was draped in a coverlet inlaid with gold and precious stones, and above it, worked in gold, were branches of a vine, having its cluster o f grapes formed of jewels. The man suddenly spoke up, identifying himself as E noch. \"Do not pry into the mysteries of God,\" the voice warned Alexan der. Heeding the warning, Alexander left to rejoin his troops; but n ot before receiving as a parting gift a bunch of grapes that miraculously we re sufficient to feed his whole army. In yet another version, Alexander encountered not o ne but two men from the past: Enoch, and the Prophet Elijah—two who acc ording to biblical traditions have never died. It happened when Alexan der was traversing an uninhabited desert. Suddenly, his horse was seized by a \"spirit\" which carried horse and rider aloft, bringing Alexander t o a glittering tabernacle. Inside, he saw the two men. Their faces were bright , their teeth whiter than milk, their eyes shone brighter than the morni ng star; they were \"lofty of stature, of gracious look.\" Telling h i m who they were, they said that \"God hid them from death.\" They told him that the p lace was \"The Gity of the Storehouse of Life,\" from where the \"Bright Wat ers of Life\" emanated. But before Alexander could find out more, or drink of the \"Waters of Life,\" a \"chariot of fire\" snatched him away—and he found himself back with his troops. (According to Muslim tradition, the prophet Muhamme d was also carried heavenward, a thousand years later, riding his whit e horse.) Was the episode of the Gave of the Gods—as the othe r episodes in the histories of Alexander—pure fiction, mere myth, or perhaps embellished tales based on historical fact? Was there a Queen Gandace, a royal city named Shama r, a world- conqueror named Sesonchusis? In truth, the names me ant little to students of antiquity until relatively recently. If these we re names of Egyptian royal personages or of a mystical province of Egypt, they were as obscured by time as the monuments were obscured by the encroach ing sands; rising above the sands, the pyramids and the Sphinx only b roadened the enigma; the hieroglyphic picture-words, undecipherable, onl y confirmed that there were secrets not to be unlocked. The tales from ant iquity, passed on via the Greeks and Romans, dissolved into legends; eventual ly, they faded into obscurity. It was only when Napoleon conquered Egypt in 1798, that Europe began to rediscover Egypt. Accompanying Napoleon's troops were groups of serious scholars who began to remove the sands and raise the curtain of"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"24 The Stairway to Heaven forgetfulness. Then, near the village of Rosetta, a stone tablet was found bearing the same inscription in three languages. Th e key was found to unlock the language and inscriptions of ancient Egy pt: its records of Pharaonic feats, the glorification of its gods. In the 1820s European explorers penetrating southwa rd, into the Sudan, reported the existence of ancient monuments (includ ing sharp-angled pyramids) at a site on the Nile river called Meroe. A Royal Prussian expedition uncovered impressive archaeological rema ins during excavations in the years 1842-44. Between 1912 and 1914, others uncovered sacred sites; the hieroglyphic inscriptions indicated one of them was called the Sun Temple—perhaps the very place where the spies of Ca mbyses observed the \"Table of the Sun.\" Further excavations in this cen tury, the piecing together of archaeological finds, and the continued decipherment of the inscriptions, have established that there indeed ex isted in that land a Nubian kingdom in the first millennium B.C.; it was the biblical Land of Kush. There indeed was a Queen Candace. The hieroglyphic inscriptions revealed, that at the very beginning of the Nubian kingdom, it was ruled by a wise and benevolent queen. Her name was Candace ( Fig. 5). Thereafter, whenever a woman ascended the throne—which was not infrequent—she adopted the name as a symbol of great queenship. An d farther south of Meroe, within this kingdom's domain, there was a ci ty named Sennar— possibly the Shamar referred to in the Alexander ta le. And what about Sesonchusis? It is told in the Ethio pic version of pseudo- Callisthenes, that journeying to (or from) Egypt, A lexander and his men passed by a lake swarming with crocodiles. There, a n earlier ruler had built a way to cross the lake. \"And behold, there was a b uilding upon the shore of the lake, and above the building was a heathen alta r upon which was written: 'I am Kosh, the king of the world, the con queror who crossed this lake.\" Who was this world conqueror Kosh, namely the king who ruled over Kush or Nubia? In the Greek version of this tale, t he conqueror who had commemorated his crossing of the lake—described as part of the waters of the Red Sea—was named Sesonchusis; so Sesonchusis a nd Kosh were one and the same ruler—a Pharaoh who had ruled both Egy pt and Nubia. Nubian monuments depicted such a ruler as he receiv es from a \"Shiny God\" the Fruit of Life shaped like date palms (Fig. 6). Egyptian records do speak of a great Pharaoh who, e arly in the second millenium B.C., was indeed a world conqueror. His n ame was Senusert; and he, too, was a devotee of Ammon. Greek historia ns credited him with the conquest of Libya and Arabia, and significantly also of Ethiopia and all the islands of the Red Sea; of great parts of Asia— penetrating east even farther than the later Persians; and of invading Eu rope via Asia Minor. Herodotus described the great feats of this Pharaoh , whom he names Sesostris; stating that Sesostris erected memorial pillars wherever he went."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"The Immortal Ancestors 25 Fig. 5 Fig. 6 "},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"26 The Stairway to Heaven The pillars which he erected,\" Herodotus wrote, \"ar e still visible.\" Thus, when Alexander saw the pillar by the lake, it only confirmed what Herodotus had written a century earlier. Sesonchusis did indeed exist. His Egyptian name mea nt \"He whose births live.\" For, by virtue of being a Pharaoh of Egypt, he had every right to join the company of the gods, and live forever. In the search for the Waters of Life or of Eternal Youth, it was important to assert that the search was surely not futile, for o thers in days past had succeeded in the quest. Moreover, if the waters flo w from a Paradise Lost, would not finding those who had been there be a mea ns of learning from them how to get there? It was with that in mind, that Alexander sought to reach the Immortal Ancestors. Whether he indeed encountered them is no t too important: the important fact is that in the centuries preceding t he Christian era, Alexander or his historians (or both) believed that the Immortal Ancestors indeed existed—that in days that to them were ancie nt and olden, mortals could become immortal if the gods so wished. The authors or editors of the histories of Alexande r relate various incidents in which Alexander encountered Sesonchusi s; Elijah and Enoch; or just Enoch. The identity of Sesonchusis could on ly be guessed, and the manner of his translation to Immortality is not des cribed. Not so with Elijah—the companion of Enoch in the Shining Temple , according to one Alexander version. He was the biblical Prophet who was active in the K ingdom of Israel in the ninth century B.C., during the reign of kings A hab and Ahaziah. As his adopted name indicated (Eli-Yah—\"My God is Yahweh\") , he was inspired by and stood up for the Hebrew god Yahweh, whose fa ithful were finding themselves harassed by the followers of the Canaani te god Baal. After a period of seclusion at a secret place near the Jord an River, where he was apparently coached by the Lord, he was given \"a man tle of haircloth\" of magical powers, and was able to perform miracles. R esiding first near the Phoenician town of Sidon, his first reported miracl e (as related in I Kings Chapter 17) was the making of a little cooking oil and a spoonful of flour last a widow, who gave him shelter, the rest of her life time. Then he prevailed on the Lord to revive her son, after he had died of a violent illness. He could also summon the Fire of God from the skies, w hich came in handily in the ongoing struggle with the kings and priests who succumbed to pagan temptations. Of him, the Scriptures say, that he did not die on Earth, for he \"went up into Heaven in a whirlwind.\" According to Jewish tr aditions, Elijah is still immortal; and to this very day, tradition requires that he be invited to come into Jewish homes on Passover eve. His ascent is de scribed in the Old Testament in great detail. And as reported in II Ki ngs Chapter 2, the event"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"The Immortal Ancestors 27 was not a sudden or unexpected occurrence. On the c ontrary: it was a planned and pre-arranged operation, whose place and time were communi- cated to Elijah in advance. The designated place was in the Jordan Valley, on t he eastern side of the river—perhaps in the very area where Elijah was ord ained as \"a Man of God.\" As he began his last journey to Gilgal—a plac e commemorating an earlier miracle, as the Bible tells—he had a tough time shaking off his devoted chief disciple Elisha. Along the way, the t wo Prophets were repeatedly intercepted by disciples, \"Sons of Proph ets,\" who kept asking: Is it true that the Lord will take Elijah heavenward t oday? Let the biblical narrator tell the story in his own words: And it came to pass when the Lord would take up Elijah into Heaven by a Whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Cilgal. And Elijah said unto Elisha: \"Tarry here, I pray thee, for the Lord has sent me to Beth-El.\" And Elisha said unto him: \"As the Lord liveth, and by thy life, I will not leave thee.\" So they went down to Beth-El. And the Sons of the Prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him: \"Knowest thou that the Lord will, this day, take the master from above thee?\" And he said: \"Yea, I know it too; but keep silent.\" Now Elijah admitted to Elisha that his destination was Jericho, by the Jordan Biver; and he asked his colleague to stay be hind. But again Elisha refused and went along with the Prophet; \"and so th ey came to Jericho.\" And the Sons of the Prophets that were at Jericho approached Elisha and said unto him: \"Knowest thou that the Lord will, this day, take the master from above thee?\" And he said: \"Yea, I know it too; but keep silent.\" Foiled thus far in his attempt to proceed alone, El ijah then asked Elisha to stay behind in Jericho, and to let him proceed t o the river's bank unaccompanied. But Elisha refused, and would not pa rt from Elijah. Encouraged, \"fifty men of the Sons of the Prophets went along; but they stopped and stood apart as the two (Elijah and Elis ha) reached the Jordan.\""},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"28 The Stairway to Heaven And Elijah took his mantle and rolled it together, and struck the waters. And the waters parted hither and thither, and the two of them crossed over on dry ground. Once they were across, Elisha asked that Elijah imb ue him with the divine spirit; but before he could get an answer, As they continued to walk on and to talk, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and the two were separated. And Elijah went up into Heaven, in a Whirlwind. And Elisha saw, and he cried out: \"My father! My father! The Chariot of Israel and its horsemen!\" And he saw it no more. Distraught, Elisha sat stunned for a while. Then he saw that the mantle of Elijah was left behind. Was it by accident or on pu rpose? Determined to find out, Elisha took the mantle, and returned to t he banks of the Jordan, and called the name of Yahweh, and struck the water s. And lo and behold— \"the waters parted hither and thither, and Elisha c rossed.\" And the Sons of the Prophets, the disciples who stood back on the w estern side of the river in the plain of Jericho, \"saw this; and they said: 'the inspiration of Elijah doth rest upon Elisha'; and they came toward him, a nd prostrated themselves before him.\" Incredulous of what they had seen with their own ey es, the fifty disciples wondered whether Elijah was indeed taken heavenward for good. Perchance the Lord's wind had blown h i m only some d istance, and he was thrown upon a mountain or into some ravine? they as ked. Over the objections of Elisha, they searched for three days. And when they returned from the futile search, Elisha said: \"Did I not say unto you, 'Go not?'\" for he well knew the truth: that the Lord of Israel had ta ken Elijah up in a Chariot of Fire. The encounter with Enoch, which the histories of Al exander claimed for him, introduced into the Search for Immortality an \"Immortal Ancestor\" specifically mentioned in the Old and New Testament s alike, the legends of whose ascent to the heavens predated the Bible and were recorded in their own right. According to the Bible, Enoch was the seventh pre-D iluvial patriarch in the line of Adam through Seth (as distinct from the accursed line of Adam"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"The Immortal Ancestors 29 through Cain). He was the great-grandfather of Noah , the hero of the Deluge. The fifth chapter of the Book of Genesis li sts the genealogies of these patriarchs, the ages at which their rightful heirs were born, and the ages at which they died. But Enoch was an exception : no mention at all is made of his death. Explaining that \"he had walked w ith the Lord,\" the Book of Genesis states that at the actual or symbolic ag e of 365 (the number of days in a solar year), Enoch \"was gone\" from Earth, \"for the Lord had taken him.\" Enlarging on the cryptic biblical statement, Jewish commentators often quoted older sources which seemed to describe an ac tual ascent by Enoch to the heavens, where he was (by some versions) tra nslated into Metatron, the Lord's \"Prince of the Countenance\" who was stat ioned right behind the Lord's throne. According to these legends, as brought together by I. B. Lavner in his Kol Agadoth Israel [All the Legends of Israel], whe n Enoch was summoned to the Lord's abode, a fiery horse was sent for him from the heavens. Enoch was at the time preaching righteousness to the peop le. When the people saw the fiery horse descending from the skies, they asked Enoch for an explanation. And he told them: \"Know ye, that the t ime has come to leave ye and ascend to Heaven.\" But as he mounted the hor se, the people refused to let him leave, and followed him about fo r a whole week. \"And it was on the seventh day, that a fiery chariot drawn by fiery horses and angels came down, and raised Enoch skyward.\" While he was soaring up, the Angels of Heaven objected to the Lord: \"How comes a man born of a woman to ascend unto the Heavens?\" But the Lord poi nted out the piety and devotion of Enoch, and opened to him the Gates of Life and of Wisdom, and arrayed him in a magnificent garment an d a luminous crown. As in other instances, cryptic references in the Sc riptures often suggest that the ancient editor assumed that his reader was familiar with some other, more detailed writings on the subject at han d. There are even specific mentions of such writings—\"The Book of Rig hteousness,\" or \"The Book of the Wars of Yahweh\"—which must have existed , but were entirely lost. In the case of Enoch, the New Testament augme nts a cryptic statement that Enoch was \"translated\" by the Lord \" that he should not see death\" with a mention of a Testimony of Enoch, writ ten or dictated by him \"before his Translation\" to Immortality (Hebrews 11 :5). Jude 14, referring to the prophecies of Enoch, is also taken as referr ing to some actual writings by this patriarch. Various Christian writings throughout the centuries also contain similar hints or references; and as it turned out, there ha ve in fact circulated since the second century B.C. several versions of a Book of Enoch. When the manuscripts were studied in the nineteenth century, scholars concluded that there were basically two sources. The first, i dentified as I Enoch and called the Ethiopic Book of Enoch, is an Ethiopic t ranslation of a previous"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"30 The Stairway to Heaven Greek translation of an original work in Hebrew (or Aramaic). The other, identified as II Enoch, is a Slavonic translation f rom an original written in Greek whose full title was The Book of the Secrets of Enoch. Scholars who have studied these versions do not rul e out the possibility that both I Enoch and II Enoch stem from a much ear lier original work; and that there indeed could have existed in antiquity a Book of Enoch. The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament, which R. H. Charles began to publish in 1913, is still the major Englis h translation of the Books of Enoch and the other early writings which were ex cluded from the canonized Old and New Testaments. Written in the first person, The Book of the Secret s of Enoch starts with an exact place and time: On the first day of the first month of the 365th ye ar I was alone in my house and I rested on my bed and slept. . . . And t here appeared to me two men, very tall, such as I have never seen on Ea rth; and their faces shone like the sun, and their eyes were like burnin g lamps, and fire came forth from their lips. Their dress had the appearan ce of feathers, their feet were purple. Their wings were brighter than go ld; their hands whiter than snow. They stood at the head of my bed and called me by name. Because he was asleep when these strangers arrived, Enoch adds for the record that by then he was no longer sleeping; \"I s aw clearly these men, standing in front of me,\" he states. He made obeisa nce to them, and was overtaken by fear. But the two reassured him: Be of good cheer, Enoch, be not afraid; the Everlas ting God hath sent us to thee and lo, today thou shalt ascend with us int o heaven. They then told Enoch to wake up his family and serv ants, and order them not to seek him, \"till the Lord bring thee back to them.\" This Enoch did, using the opportunity to instruct his sons in the w ays of righteousness. Then the time came to depart: It came to pass when I had spoken to my sons, these men summoned me and took me on their wings and placed me on the clo uds; and lo, the clouds moved. . . . Going higher I saw the air and (going still) higher I saw the ether; and they placed me in the First Heav en; and they showed me a very great sea, greater than the earthly sea. Ascending thus unto the heavens upon \"clouds that m ove,\" Enoch was transported from the First Heaven—where \"two hundre d angels rule the stars\"—to the Second, gloomy Heaven; then to the Th ird Heaven. There he was shown"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"The Immortal Ancestors 31 a garden with a goodliness of its appearance; beaut iful and fragrant trees and fruits. In the midst therein there is a Tree of Life—in tha t place on which the God rests when he comes into Paradise. Stunned by the Tree's magnificence, Enoch manages t o describe the Tree of Life in the following words: \"It is beautif ul more than any created thing; on all sides in appearance it is like gold a nd crimson, transparent as fire.\" From its root go four streams which pour hon ey, milk, oil and wine, and they go down from this heavenly Paradise to the Paradise of Eden, making a revolution around Earth. This Third Heaven and its Tree of Life are guarded by three hundred \"very glorious\" angels . It is in this Third Heaven that the Place of the Righteous, and the Ter rible Place where the wicked are tortured, are situated. Going further up, to the Fourth Heaven, Enoch could see the Lumin- aries and various wondrous creatures, and the Host of the Lord. In the Fifth Heaven, he saw many \"hosts\"; in the Sixth, \"b ands of angels who study the revolutions of the stars.\" Then he reache d the Seventh Heaven, where the greatest angels hurried about and where h e saw the Lord—\"from afar\"—sitting on his throne. The two winged men and their moving cloud placed En och at the limits of the Seventh Heaven, and left; whereupon the Lord sent the archangel Gabriel to fetch Enoch into His Presence. For thirty-three days, Enoch was instructed in all the wisdoms and all the events of the past and the future; then he was retu rned to Earth by an awful angel who had a \"very cold appearance.\" In total, h e was absent from Earth sixty days. But his return to Earth was only so tha t he might instruct his sons in the laws and commandments; and thirty days later, he was taken up again unto the heavens—this time, for good. Written both as a personal testament and as a histo ric review, the Ethiopic Book of Enoch, whose earliest title was probably Th e Words of Enoch, describes his journeys to Heaven as well as to the four corners of Earth. As he traveled north, \"toward the north ends of Earth, \" he \"saw there a great and glorious device,\" the nature of which is not de scribed. And he saw there, as well as at the western ends of Earth, \"th ree portals of heaven open in the heaven\" in each place, through which hail an d snow, cold and frost blew in. \"And thence I went to the south to the ends of the Earth,\" and through the portals of Heaven there blow in the dew and rai n. And thence he went to see the eastern portals, through which the stars of Heaven pass and run their course. But the principal mysteries, and secrets of the pas t and the future, were shown to Enoch as he went to \"the middle of the Ear th,\" and to the east and to the west thereof. The \"middle of the Earth\" was the site of the future"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"32 The Stairway to Heaven Holy Temple in Jerusalem; on his journey east, Enoc h reached the Tree of Knowledge; and going west, he was shown the Tree of Life. On his eastward journey, Enoch passed mountains and deserts, saw water courses flowing from mountain peaks covered b y clouds, and snow and ice (\"water which flows not\"), and trees of div erse fragrances and balsams. Going farther and farther east, he found h imself back over mountains bordering the Erythraean Sea (the Sea of Arabia and the Red Sea). Continuing, he passed by Zotiel, the angel gu arding the entrance to Paradise, and he \"came unto the Garden of Righteous ness.\" There he saw among many wonderful trees the \"Tree of Knowledge.\" It was as high as a fir, its leaves were as of the carob, and its fruit like the clusters of a vine. And the angel who was with him confirmed that indee d it was the very tree whose fruit Adam and Eve had eaten before they were driven out of the Garden of Eden. On his journey west, Enoch arrived at a \"mountain r ange of fire, which burnt day and night.\" Beyond it he reached a place encircled by six mountains separated by \"deep, rough ravines.\" A sev enth mountain rose in their midst, \"resembling the seat of a throne; and fragrant trees encircled the throne. And amongst them was a tree such as I h ad never smelt. . . and its fruit resembles the dates of a palm.\" The angel who accompanied him explained that the mi ddle mountain was the throne \"on which the Holy Great One, the Lord o f Glory, the Eternal King will sit when He shall come to visit Earth.\" A nd as to the tree whose fruits were as the date palms, he said: As for this fragrant tree, no mortal is permitted t o touch it till the Great Judgment . . . Its fruit shall be for food for the elect . . . Its fragrance shall be in their bones, And they shall live a long life on Earth. It was during these journeys that Enoch \"saw in tho se days how long cords were given to those angels, and they took to themselves wings, and they went towards the north.\" And when Enoch asked what this was all about, the angel who guided him said; \"They have go ne off to measure . . . they shall bring the measures of the righteous to t he righteous, and the ropes of the righteous to the righteous . . all the se measures shall reveal the secrets of the earth.\" Having visited all the secret places on Earth, Enoc h's time had come to take the Journey to Heaven. And, like others after him, he was taken to a \"mountain whose summit reached to Heaven\" and to a Land of Darkness: And they (the angels) took me to a place in which t hose who were there were like flaming fire, and when they wished, they appeared as men. And they brought me to a place of darkness, and to a mountain the point of whose summit reached to heaven."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"The Immortal Ancestors 33 And I saw the chambers of the luminaries, and the t reasuries of the stars, and of the thunder, in the great depths, whe re were a fiery bow and arrows, and their quiver, and a fiery sword, an d all the lightnings. Whereas, at such a crucial stage, Immortality slipp ed out of Alexander's hands because he had searched for it contrary to hi s proclaimed destiny— Enoch, as the Pharaohs after him, was proceeding wi th divine blessing. Thus, at this crucial moment, he was deemed worthy of proceeding; so \"they (the angels) took me to the Waters of Life.\" Continuing, he arrived at the \"House of Fire\": And I went in till I drew nigh to a wall which is b uilt of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire; and it began to affr ight me. And I went into the tongues of fire and drew nigh t o a large house which was built of crystals; and the walls of the h ouse were like a tesselated floor of crystals, and its groundwork wa s of crystal.

But it is equally clear that, in the centuries preceding the Christian era, it was believed (by Alexander or by his historians or by b oth) that if one wished to attain Immortality, one had to emulate the Egyptian Pharaohs. Accordingly, Alexander's claim to semi-divine ances try was evolved from a complicated affair by an Egyptian deity, rather t han by simply claiming affinity to a local Greek god. It is an historical fact, not mere legend, that Alexander found it necessary, as soon as he broke t hrough the Persian lines in Asia Minor, not to pursue the Persian enemy, but to go to Egypt; there to seek the answer to his purported divine \"roots,\" and from there to begin the search for the Waters of Life. Whereas the Hebrews, the Greeks and other peoples i n antiquity recounted tales of a unique few who were able to es cape a mortal's fate by divine invitation, the ancient Egyptians developed the privilege into a right. Not a universal right, nor a right reserved to the singularly righteous; but a right attendant on the Egyptian king, the Pha raoh, by sole virtue of having sat on the throne of Egypt. The reason for t his, according to the traditions of ancient Egypt, was that the first rul ers of Egypt were not men but gods. Egyptian traditions held that in times immemorial \" Gods of Heaven\" came to Earth from the Celestial Disk (Fig. 7). Whe n Egypt was inundated by waters, \"a very great god who came forth (to Ear th) in the earliest times\" arrived in Egypt and literally raised it from under the waters and mud, by damming the waters of the Nile and undertaking exte nsive dyking and land reclamation works (it was therefore that Egypt was nicknamed \"The Raised Land\"). This olden god was named PTAH—'The Develope r.\" He was considered to have been a great scientist, a master engineer and architect, the Chief Craftsman of the gods, who even had a han d in creating and shaping Man. His staff was frequently depicted as a graduated stick—very much like the graduated rod which surveyors employ for field measuring nowadays (Fig. 7). 35"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 The Stairway to Heaven The Egyptians believed that Ptah eventually retired south, where he could continue to control the waters of the Nile wi th sluices he had installed in a secret cavern, located at the first cataract o f the Nile (the site of today's Aswan Dam). But before leaving Egypt, he built its first hallowed city and named it AN, in honor of the God of the Heavens (th e biblical On, whom the Greeks called Heliopolis). There, he installed as Egypt's first Divine Ruler his own son RA (so named in honor of the Cele stial Globe). Ra, a great \"God of Heaven and Earth,\" caused a spe cial shrine to be built at An; it housed the Ben-Ben—a \"secret object \" in which Ra had purportedly come down to Earth from the heavens. In time Ra divided the kingdom between the gods OSI RIS and SETH. But the sharing of the kingdom between the two divi ne brothers did not work. Seth kept seeking the overthrow and death of his brother Osiris. It took some doing, but finally Seth succeeded in tric king Osiris into entering a coffin, which Seth promptly set to seal and drown . ISIS, the sister and wife of Osiris, managed to find the coffin, which h ad floated ashore in what is nowadays Lebanon. She hid Osiris as she went to summon the help of other gods who could bring Osiris back to life; but Seth discovered the body and cut it to pieces, dispersing them all over the land. Helped by her sister NEPHTYS, Isis managed to retrieve the pieces (all e xcept for the phallus) and to put together the mutilated body of Osiris, t hereby resurrecting him. Thereafter, Osiris lived on, resurrected, in the Ot her World among the other celestial gods. Of him the sacred writings sa id: He entered the Secret Gates, The glory of the Lords of Eternity, In step with him who shines in the horizon, On the path of Ra. The place of Osiris on the throne of Egypt was take n over by his son HORUS. When he was born, his mother Isis hid him in the reeds of the river Nile (just as the mother of Moses did, accord ing to the Bible), to keep him out of the reach of Seth. But the boy was stung by a scorpion and died. Quickly, the goddess his mother appealed to THOTH, a god of magical powers, for help. Thoth, who was in the heavens, im mediately came down to Earth in Ra's \"Barge of Astronomical Years\" and helped restore Horus to life. Growing up, Horus challenged Seth for the throne. T he struggle ranged far and wide, the gods pursuing each other in the s kies. Horus attacked Seth from a Nar, a term which in the ancient Near E ast meant \"Fiery Pillar.\" Depictions from pre-dynastic times showed this celestial chariot as a long, cylindrical object with a funnel-like tail an d a bulkhead from which rays are spewed out, a kind of a celestial submarin e (Fig. 8).

Horns shot at Seth, from out of the Nar, a speciall y designed \"harpoon,\" and Seth was hurt, losing his testicles; this only made him madder. In the final battle, over the Sinai peninsula, Seth shot a beam of fire at Horus, and Horus lost an \"eye.\" The great gods called a truce and met in council. After some wavering and indecision, the Lord of Earth rul ed in favor of giving Egypt to Horus. declaring him the legitimate heir i n the Ra-Osiris line of succession. (Thereafter, Horus was usually depicted with the attributes of a falcon, while Seth was shown as an Asiatic deity, s ymbolized by the ass, the burden animal of the nomads; Fig. 7). The accession of Horus to the reunited throne of th e Two Lands (Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt) remained throughout Egyptian history the point at which kingship was given its perpetual divine co nnection; for every Pharaoh was deemed a successor of Horus and the occ upier of the throne of Osiris. For unexplained reasons, the rule of Horus was foll owed by a period of chaos and decline; how long this lasted, no one kno ws. Finally, circa 3200 B.C., a \"dynastic race\" arrived in Egypt and a man named Menes ascended the throne of a reunited Egypt. It was then that th e gods granted Egypt civilization and what we now call Religion. The kin gship that was begun by Menes continued through twenty-six dynasties of Pha raohs until the Persian domination in 525 B.C., and then through Gr eek and Roman times (when the famed Cleopatra reigned). When Menes, the first Pharaoh, established the unit ed kingdom, he chose a midpoint in the Nile, just south of Heliopo lis, as the place for the capital of the two Egypts. Emulating the works of P tah, he built Memphis on an artificial mound raised above the Nile's wate rs, and dedicated its temples to Ptah. Memphis remained the political-rel igious center of Egypt for more than a thousand years. Rut circa 2200 B . C . great upheavals befell Egypt, the nature of which i s not clear to scholars. Some think that Asiatic inva ders overran the country, enslaving the people and disrupting the worship of their gods. Whatever semblance of Egyptian independence remained, it was retained in Upper Egypt—the less accessible regions farther south.

Its god was called AMEN —\"The Hidden One\"—the very god Amnion whom Alexander had searched out as his true divine father. As supreme deity, he was worshipped as Amen-Ra, \"The Hidden Ra \"; and it is not clear whether he was the very same Ra but now somehow uns een or \"hidden,\" or another deity. The Greeks called Thebes Diospolis, \"The City of Ze us,\" for they equated Ammon with their supreme god Zeus. This fac t made it easier for Alexander to affiliate himself with Ammon; and it w as to Thebes that he rushed after he had received Amnion's favorable ora cle at the oasis of Siwa. There, at Thebes and its precincts (now known as Ka rnak, Luxor, Dier- el-Bahari), Alexander came upon the extensive shrin es and monuments to Ammon—impressive to this very day although they sta nd empty and in ruins. They were built mostly by Twelfth Dynasty Ph araohs, one of whom was probably the \"Sesonchusis\" who had searched for the Waters of Life 1,500 years before Alexander. One of the colossal t emples was built by Queen Hatshepshut, who was also said to have been a daughter of the god Ammon. Such tales of divine parentage were not unusual. Th e Pharaoh's claim to divine status, based on the mere fact of occupying the throne of Osiris, was sometimes augmented by assertions that the ruler wa s the son or the brother of this or that god or goddess. Scholars co nsider such statements to have only symbolic meaning; but some Egyptian Phara ohs, such as three kings of the Fifth Dynasty, maintained that they we re actually, physically, the sons of the god Ra, begotten by him when he imp regnated the wife of the high priest in his own temple. Other kings attributed their descent from Ra to mor e sophisticated means. It was claimed that Ra embodied himself in t he reigning Pharaoh, through which subterfuge he could then have interco urse with the queen. Thereby, the heir to the throne could claim direct descent of Ra. But apart from such specific claims to be of divine seed, eve ry Pharaoh was theologically deemed to be the incarnation of Horus and thus by extension the son of the god Osiris. Consequently, the Pharao h was entitled to eternal life in the very same manner experienced by Osiris: to resurrection after death, to an Afterlife. It was this circle, of gods and god-like Pharaohs, that Alexander longed to join. The belief was that Ra and the other immortal gods managed to live forever because he kept rejuvenating himself. Accordingly, the Pharaohs bore names meaning, for example, \"He Who Repeats Births\" and \"Repeater of Births.\" The gods rejuvenated themselves by partaki ng of divine food and"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 The Stairway to Heaven beverage at their abode. Therefore, the king's atta inment of an eternal Afterlife called for his joining the gods in their abode, so that he too could partake of their divine sustenances. The ancient incantations appealed to the gods to sh are with the deceased king their divine food: \"Take ye this king with you , that he may eat of that which ye eat, that he may drink of which ye drink, that he may live on that whereupon ye live.\" And more specifically, as in a text from the pyramid of King Pepi: Give thou sustenance to this King Pepi From thy eternal sustenance; Thy everlasting beverage. The departed Pharaoh hoped to draw his everlasting sustenance in the celestial realm of Ra, on the \"Imperishable Star.\" There, in a mystical \"Field of Offerings\" or \"Field of Life,\" there grew the \"Plant of Life.\" A text in the pyramid of Pepi I describes him as getting p ast guards with the appearance of \"plumed birds,\" to be met by the emis saries of Horus. With them He traveleth to the Great Lake, by which the Great Gods alight. These Great Ones of the Imperishable Star give unto Pepi the Plant of Life whereon they themselves do live, so that he may also live thereon. Egyptian depictions showed the deceased (sometimes with his wife) at this Celestial Paradise, sipping the Waters of Life out of which there grows the Tree of Life with its life-giving fruit, the da te palm (Fig. 9). The celestial destination was the birthplace of Ra, to which he had returned from Earth. There, Ra himself was constant ly rejuvenated or \"re- awakened\" by having the Goddess of the Four Jars po ur him a certain elixir periodically. It was thus the king's hope to have t he same goddess pour him too the elixir and \"therewith refresh his heart to life.\" It was in these waters, named \"Water of Youth,\" that Osiris rejuven ated himself; and so it was promised to the departed King Pepi that Horus s hall \"count for thee a second season of youth\"; that he shall \"renew thy y outh in the waters whose name is 'Water of Youth. \" Resurrected to Afterlife, even rejuvenated, the Pha raoh attained a paradisical life: \"His provision is among the gods; his water is wine, like that of Ra. When Ra eats, he gives to him; when Ra drink s, he gives to him.\" And in a touch of twentieth century psychotherapy, the text adds: \"He sleeps soundly every day ... he fares better today than yesterday.\" The Pharaoh seemed little bothered by the paradox t hat he had to die"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":" Fig. 9 first in order to attain Immortality. As supreme ru ler of the Two Lands of Egypt, he enjoyed the best possible life on Earth; and the resurrection among the gods was an even more attractive prospect . Besides, it was only his earthly body that was to be embalmed and entomb ed; for the Egyptians believed that every person possessed a Ba, akin to what we call \"soul,\" which rose heavenward like a bird after death; and a Ka—variably translated Double, Ancestral Spirit, Essence, Perso nality—through which form the Pharaoh was translated into his Afterlife. Samuel Mercer, in his introduction to the Pyramid Texts, concluded that t he Ka stood for the mortal's personification of a god. In other words, the concept implied the existence in Man of a divine element, a celestial o r godly Double who could resume life in the Afterlife. But if Afterlife was possible, it was not easily at tained. The departed king had to traverse a long and challenging road, and ha d to undergo elaborate ceremonial preparations before he could embark on h is journey. The deification of the Pharaoh began with his purif ication and included embalmment (mummification), so that the dead king w ould resemble Osiris with all his members tied together. The embalmed Ph araoh was then carried in a funerary procession to a structure top ped by a pyramid, in front of which there stood an oval-shaped pillar (Fig. 10 ). Within this funerary temple, priestly rites were co nducted with a view to achieving for the Pharaoh acceptance at journey's e nd. The ceremonies, called in the Egyptian funerary texts the \"Opening of the Mouth,\" were supervised by a Shem priest—always depicted wearing a leopard skin (Fig. 11). Scholars believe that the ritual was literally what its name implies: the priest, using a bent copper or iron tool, opened th e mouth of the mummy or of a statue representing the departed king. But it is clear that the The Pharaoh's Journey to the Afterlife 41"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":" Fig. 10 Fig. 11 ceremony was primarily symbolic, intended to open f or the deceased the \"mouth\" or Entranceway to the Heavens. The mummy, by then, was tied up tight in many layer s of material and was surmounted by the king's golden death mask. Thu s, the touching of its mouth (or that of the king's statue) could have bee n only symbolical. Indeed, the priest intoned not the deceased, but th e gods to \"open the mouth\" so that the Pharaoh could ascend toward eter nal life. Special appeals were made to the \"Eye\" of Horus, lost by hi m in the battle with Seth, to cause the \"opening of the mouth\" so that \" a path shall be opened for the king among the Shiny Ones, that he may be e stablished among them.\" The earthly (and thus by conjecture only temporary) tomb of the Pharaoh—according to the texts and actual archaeolo gical discoveries—had a false door on its eastern side, i.e. the masonry was built there to look like a doorway, but it was actually a solid wall. Purifi ed, with all limbs tied together, \"opened of mouth,\" the Pharaoh was then e nvisioned as raising himself, shaking off Earth's dust, and exiting by t he false door. According to a Pyramid Text which dealt with the resurrection pr ocess step by step, the Pharaoh could not pass through the stone wall by hi mself. \"Thou standest at "},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"The Pharaoh's Journey to the Afterlife 43 the doors which hold people back,\" the text said, u ntil \"he who is chief of the department\"—a divine messenger in charge of thi s task—\"comes out to thee. He lays hold on thy arm, and takes thee to he aven, to thy father.\" Aided thus by a divine messenger, the Pharaoh was o ut of his sealed tomb, through the false door. And the priests broke out in a chant: \"The king is on his way to Heaven! The king is on his wa y to Heaven!\" The king is on his way to Heaven The king is on his way to Heaven On the wind, on the wind. He is not hindered; There is no one by whom he is hindered. The king is on his own, son of the gods. His bread will come on high, with Ra; His offering will come out of the Heavens. The king is he \"Who Comes Again.\" But before the departed king could ascend to Heaven to eat and drink with the gods, he had to undertake an arduous and h azardous Journey. His goal was a land called Neter-Khert, \"The Land of th e Mountain Gods.\" It was sometimes written pictorially in hieroglyphic b y surmounting the symbol for god (Neter) u pon a ferry boat ; and indeed, to reach that land, the Pharaoh had to cross a long and wind ing Lake of Reeds. The marshy waters could be crossed with the aid of a Di vine Ferryman, but before he would ferry the Pharaoh over he questione d the king about his origins: What made him think he had the right to cr oss over? Was he a son of a god or a goddess? Beyond the lake, past a desert and a chain of mount ains, past various guardian gods, lay the Duat, a magical \"Abode for r ising to the Stars,\" whose location and name have baffled the scholars. Some view it as the Netherworld, the abode of the spirits, where the ki ng must go as Osiris did. Others believe it was an Underworld, and indeed muc h of its scenes were of a subterranean world of tunnels and caverns with unseen gods, pools of boiling waters, eerie lights, chambers guarded by b irds, doors that open by themselves. This magical land was divided into twel ve divisions, and was traversed in twelve hours. The Duat was further perplexing, because in spite o f its terrestrial nature (it was reached after crossing through a mountain p ass) or subterranean aspects, its name was written hieroglyphically with a star and a soaring falcon as its determinatives or simply with a star within a circle , denoting a celestial or heavenly association.

One text summed up this problem and it s solution in two sentences: \"Men are buried, the gods fly up. Cause this king to fly to Heaven, (to be) among his brothers the gods.\" A tex t inscribed in the pyramid of King Teti expressed the Pharaoh's hope a nd appeal to the gods in these words: Men fall, They have no Name. Seize thou king Teti by his arms, Take thou king Teti to the sky, That he die not on Earth among men. And so it was incumbent upon the king to reach the \"Hidden Place,\" and go through its subterranean labyrinths until he cou ld find there a god who carries the emblem of the Tree of Life, and a god w ho is the \"Herald of Heaven.\" They will open for him secret gates, and l ead him to the Eye of Horus, a Celestial Ladder into which he would step— an object which can change hues to blue and red as it is \"powered.\" And then, himself turned into the Falcon-god, he would soar skyward to the e ternal Afterlife on the Imperishable Star. There, Ra himself would welcome him: The Gates of Heaven are opened for thee; The doors of the Cool Place are opened for thee. Thou shalt find Ra standing, waiting for thee. He will take your hand, He will take thee to the Dual Shrine of Heaven; He will place thee on the throne of Osiris . . . Thou shalt stand supported, equipped as a god . . . Among the Eternals, on the Imperishable Star. Much of what is known today on the subject comes fr om the Pyramid Texts—thousands of verses combined into hundreds of Utterances, that were discovered embossed or painted (in the hierogl yphic writing of ancient Egypt) on the walls, passages and galleries of the pyramids of five Pharaohs (Unas, Teti, Pepi I, Merenra and Pepi II) who ruled Egypt from circa 2350 B.C. to 2180 B.C. These texts were sorte d out and numbered by Kurt Sethe in his masterful Die altaegyptischen Pyr amidentexte, which has remained the major reference source together with t he English counter- part, The Pyramid Texts by Samuel A. B. Mercer. The thousands of verses that make up the Pyramid Te xts seem to be just a collection of repetitious, unconnected incantations , appeals to the gods or exaltations of the king. To make some sense of the material, scholars have developed theories about shifting theologies in anc ient Egypt, a conflict and then a merger between a \"Solar Religion\" and a \"Sky Religion,\" a"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"The Pharaoh's Journey to the Afterlife 45 priesthood of Ra and one of Osiris, and so on, poin ting out that we deal with material that has been accumulated over millennia. To scholars who view the mass of verses as expressi ons of p r i m i t i v e mythologies, figments of the imagination of people who cowered in fear as the wind howled and the thunder roared and called t hese phenomena \"gods\"—the verses remain as puzzling and confusing as ever. But these verses, all scholars agree, were extracted by the a ncient scribes from older and apparently well-organized, cohesive and compreh ensible scriptures. Later inscriptions on sarcophagi and coffins, as we ll as on papyrus (the latter usually accompanied by illustrations) indeed show that the verses, Utterances and Chapters (bearing such names as \"Cha pter of those who ascend\") were copied from \"Books of the Dead,\" whic h bore such titles as \"That Which Is in the Duat,\" \"The Book of the Gates ,\" \"The Book of the Two Ways.\" Scholars believe that these \"books\" in t urn were versions of two earlier basic works: olden writings that dealt with the celestial journey of Ra, and a later source which stressed the blissf ul Afterlife of those who join Osiris resurrected: the food, the beverage, th e conjugal joys in a heavenly abode. (Verses of this version were even i nscribed on talismans, to achieve for their wearer \"union with women by day o r night\" and the \"desire of women\" at all times.) The scholarly theories, however, leave unexplained the magical aspects of the information offered by these texts. Baffling ly, an Eye of Horus is an object existing independently of him—an object into whose insides the king can enter, and which can change hues to blue and re d as it is \"powered.\" There exist self-propelled ferries, doors that open by themselves, unseen gods whose faces radiate a glow. In the Underworld, supposedly inhabited by spirits only, \"bridge girders\" and \"copper cable s\" are featured. And the most baffling aspect of all: Why, if the Pharaoh's transfiguration takes him to the Underworld, do the texts claim that \"the king i s on his way to Heaven\"? Throughout, the verses indicate that the king is fo llowing the route of the gods, that he is crossing a lake the way a god had crossed it before, that he uses a barque as the god Ra had done, that he ascen ds \"equipped as a god\" as Osiris was, and so on and on. And the question a rises: What if these texts were not primitive fantasies—mythology—but accounts of a simulated journey, wherein the deceased Pharaoh emulated what the gods had actually done? What if the texts, substituting the name of the king for that of a god, were copies of some much earlier scriptures that dealt not with the journeys of the Pharaohs, but with the journeys of the gods? One of the early leading Egyptologists, Gaston Masp ero (L'Archeologie egyptienne and other works), judging by grammatical form and other evidence, suggested that the Pyramid Texts originat ed at the very beginning of Egyptian civilization, perhaps even be fore they were written down hieroglyphic-ally. J. H. Breasted has more rec ently concluded (Development of Religion and Thought in Ancient Egy pt) that \"such older material existed, whether we possess it or not.\" He found in the texts"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"46 The Stairway to Heaven information on the conditions of civilization and e vents which enhances the veracity of the texts as conveyors of factual infor mation and not of fantasy. \"To one of quick imagination,\" he says, \"they aboun d in pictures from the long-vanished world of which they are a reflection. \" Taken together, the texts and later illustrations d escribe a journey to a realm that begins above ground, that leads undergro und, and that ends with an opening to the skies through which the gods —and the kings emulating them—were launched heavenward (Fig. 12). Thus the hiero- glyphic connotation combining a subterranean place with a celestial function. Have the Pharaohs, journeying from their tombs to t he Afterlife, actually taken this Route to Heaven? Even the ancient Egypti ans claimed the journey not for the mummified corpse, but for the K a (Double) of the departed king. But they have envisioned this Double as re-enacting actual progress through actual places. What, then, if the texts reflect a world which had indeed existed—what if the Pharaoh's Journey to Immortality, even if only by emulation, indeed followed step by step actual journeys undertaken in prehistoric times? Let us follow in these footsteps; let us take the R oute of the Gods. "},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"IV The Stairway to Heaven Let us imagine ourselves in the Pharaoh's magnifice nt funerary temple. Having mummified and prepared the Pharaoh for his J ourney, the Shem priests now intone the gods to open for the king a path and a gateway. The divine messenger has arrived on the other side of t he false door, ready to take the Pharaoh through the stone wall and launch him on his journey. Emerging through the false door on the eastern side of his tomb, the Pharaoh was instructed to set his course eastward. Lest he misunderstand, he was explicitly warned against going west: \"Those who go thither, they return not!\" His goal was the Duat, in the \"Land of the Mountain Gods.\" He was to enter there \"The Great House of Two . . . the House of Fire\"; where, during \"a night of computing years,\" he shal l be transformed into a Divine Being and ascend \"to the east side of Heaven .\" The first obstacle in the Pharaoh's course was the Lake of Reeds—a long body of marshy waters made up of a series of adjoin ing lakes. Symbolically, he had the blessing of his guardian god to cross th e lake by parting its waters (Fig. 13); physically, the crossing was poss ible because the lake was served by the Divine Ferryman, who ferried the gods across in a boat made by Khnum, the Divine Craftsman. But the Ferryman wa s stationed on the far side of the lake, and the Pharaoh had a hard ti me convincing him that he was entitled to be fetched and ferried over. "},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"48 The Stairway to Heaven The Ferryman questioned the Pharaoh about his origi ns. Was he the son of a god or goddess? Was he listed in the \"Register of the Two Great Gods\"? The Pharaoh explained his claims to being of \"divin e seed,\" and gave assurances of his righteousness. In some cases it w orked. In other instances the Pharaoh had to appeal to Ra or to Thoth to get him across; in which instances, the boat and its oars or rudder came ali ve with uncanny forces: the ferryboat began to move by itself, the steering -oar grasped by the king directed itself. All, in short, became self-propell ed. One way or another, the Pharaoh managed to cross the lake and be on his way toward \"The Two That Bring Closer the Heavens\": He descends into the boat, like Ra, on the shores of the Winding Watercourse. The king rows in the Hanbu-boat; He takes the helm toward the Plain of \"The Two That Bring Closer the Heavens,\" in the land beginning from the Lake of Reeds. The Lake of Reeds was situated at the eastern end o f the domain of Horus. Beyond lay the territories of his adversary Seth, the \"lands of Asia.\" As would be expected on such a sensitive boundary, the king discovers that the lake's eastern shore is patrolled by four \"Cros sing guards, the wearers of side locks.\" The way these guards wore their hair w as truly their most conspicuous feature. \"Black as coal,\" it was \"arran ged in curls on their foreheads, at their temples and at the back of thei r heads, with braids in the center of their heads.\" Combining diplomacy with firmness, the king again p roclaimed his divine origins, claiming he was summoned by \"my fat her Ra.\" One Pharaoh is reported to have used threats: \"Delay my crossin g, and I will pluck out your locks as lotus flowers are plucked in the lotu s pond!\" Another had some of the gods come to his assistance. One way or another, the Pharaoh managed to proceed. The king has now left the lands of Horus. The eastw ard place which he seeks to reach—though under the aegis of Ra—is \"in the region of Seth.\" His goal is a mountainous area, the Mountains of th e East (Fig. 14). His course is set toward a pass between two mountains, \"the two mountains which stand in awe of Seth.\" But first he has to tr averse an arid and barren area, a kind of no-god's land between the domains o f Horus and Seth. Just as the pace and urgency of the Utterances increase, for the king is getting closer to the Hidden Place where the Doors of Heave n are located, he is challenged again by guards. \"Where goest thou?\" the y demand to know. The king's sponsors answer for him: \"The king goes to Heaven, to possess life and joy; that the king may see his father, tha t the king may see Ra.\" As the guards contemplate the request, the king himsel f pleads with them: \"Open the frontier . . . incline its barrier ... le t me pass as the gods pass through!\""},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"The Stairway to Heaven 49 Having come from Egypt, from the domain of Horus, t he king and his sponsors recognize the need for prudence. Many Utte rances and verses are employed to present the king as neutral in the feud between the gods. The king is introduced both as \"born of Horus, he at wh ose name the Earth quakes,\" and as \"conceived by Seth, he at whose nam e Heaven trembles.\" The king stresses not only his affinity to Ra, but declares that he proceeds \"in the service of Ra\"; producing thereby a laissez -passer from higher authority. With shrewd evenhandedness, the texts po int out to the two gods their own self-interest in the king's continue d journey, for Ra would surely appreciate their aid to one who comes in his service. Finally, the guards of the Land of Seth let the kin g proceed toward a mountain pass. The king's sponsors make sure that h e realizes the import of the moment: Thou are now on the way to the high places In the land of Seth. In the land of Seth Thou will be set on the high places, On that high Tree of the Eastern Sky On which the gods sit. The king has arrived at the Duat. The Duat was conceived as a completely enclosed Cir cle of the Gods (see Fig. 15), at the head-point of which there was an o pening to the skies (symbolized by the goddess Nut) through which the I mperishable Star (symbolized by the Celestial Disk) could be reached . Other sources suggested in reality a more oblong or oval valley, enclosed by mountains. A river which divided into many streams flowed throug h this land, but it was hardly navigable and most of the time Ra's barge ha d to be towed, or moved by its own power as a \"boat of earth,\" as a sled. "},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 The Stairway to Heaven The Duat was divided into twelve divisions, variabl y described as fields, plains, walled circles, caverns or halls, beginning above ground and continuing underground. It took the departed king t welve hours to journey through this enchanted and awesome realm; this he c ould achieve, because Ra had put at his disposal his magical barge or sle d, in which the king traveled aided and protected by his sponsoring gods . There were seven gaps or passes in the mountains th at enclosed the Duat, and two of them were in the mountains on the east side of Egypt (i.e. in the mountains on the west of the Duat), wh ich were called \"The Horizon\" or \"The Horn\" of \"The Hidden Place.\" The pass through which Ra had traveled was 220 atru (some twenty-sev en miles) long, and followed the course of a stream; the stream, howeve r, ran dry and Ra's barge had to be towed. The pass was guarded and had fortifications \"whose doors were strong.\" The Pharaoh, as some papyri indicate, took the cour se leading through the second, shorter pass (only some fifteen miles l ong). The papyrus drawings show him upon the barge or sled of Ra, pas sing between two mountain peaks on each of which there is stationed a company of twelve guardian gods. The texts describe a \"Lake of Boilin g Waters\" nearby— waters which, despite their fiery nature are cool t o the touch. A fire burns below the ground. The place has a strong bituminous or \"natron\" stench which drives away the birds. Yet not too far away, there is depicted an oasis with shrubs or low trees around it. Once across the pass, the king encounters other com panies of gods. \"Come in peace,\" they say. He has arrived at the se cond division. It is called, after the stream that runs through it , Ur-nes (a name which some scholars equate with Uranus, the Greek god of the skies). Measuring some fifteen by thirty-nine miles, it is inhabited by people with long hair, who eat the flesh of their asses and depend on the gods for water and sustenance, for the place is arid and the streams a re mostly dry. Even Ra's barge turns here into a \"boat of earth.\" It is a do main associated with the Moon god, and with Hathor, the Goddess of Turquoise . Aided by the gods, the king passes safely through t he second division and in the Third Hour arrives at Net-Asar, \"The Stream of Osiris.\" Similar in size to the second division, this third division is inhabited by \"The Fighters.\" It is there that the four gods, who are in charge of the four cardinal points of the compass, are stationed. The pictorial depictions which accompanied the hier oglyphic texts surprisingly showed the Stream of Osiris as meander ing its way from an agricultural area, through a chain of mountains, to where the stream divided into tributaries. There, watched over by th e legendary Phoenix birds, the Stairway to Heaven was situated; there, the Celestial Boat of Ra was depicted as sitting atop a mountain, or rising heavenward upon streams of fire (Fig. 16). Here, the pace of prayers and Utterances increases again. The king"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":" Fig. 16 invokes the \"magical protectors,\" that \"this man of Earth may enter the Neter-Khert\" unmolested. The king is nearing the he art of the Duat; he is near the Atnen-Ta, the \"Hidden Place.\" It was there that Osiris himself had risen to the E ternal Afterlife. It was there that the \"Two That Bring Closer the Heaven\" s tood out \"yonder against the sky,\" as two magical trees. The king of fers a prayer to Osiris (the Chapter's title in the Book of the Dead is \"Chapter of Making His Name in the Neter-Khert Granted\"): May be given to me my Name in the Great House of Two; May in the House of Fire my Name be granted. In the night of computing years, and of telling the months, may I be a Divine Being, may I sit at the east side of Heaven."},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 The Stairway to Heaven Let the god advance me from behind; Everlasting is his Name. The king is within sight of the \"Mountain of Light. \" He has reached the STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN. The Pyramid Texts said of the place that it was \"th e stairway in order to reach the heights.\" Its stairs were described as \"t he stairs to the sky, which are laid out for the king, that he may ascend there on to the heavens.\" The hieroglyphic pictograph for the Stairway to Heaven was sometimes a single stairway (which was also cast in gold and worn as a charm), or more often a double stairway , as a step pyramid. This Stairway to Heaven was constructed by the gods of the city of An—the locat ion of the principal temple of Ra—so that they, the gods, could be \"unit ed with the Above.\" The king's goal is the Celestial Ladder, an Ascende r which would actually carry him aloft. But to reach it in the House of Fi re, the Great House of Two, he must enter the Amen-Ta, the Hidden Land of Seker, God of the Wilderness. It is a domain described as a fortified circle. It is the subterranean Land of Darkness, reachable by entering into a mountain and going down spiraling hidden paths protected by secret doors. I t is the fourth division of the Duat which the king must now enter; but the mou ntain entrance is protected by two walls and the passage between them is swept by flames and manned by guarding gods. When Ra himself had arrived at this entrance to the Hidden Place, \"he performed the designs\"—followed the procedures—\"of the gods who are therein by means of his voice, without seeing them. \" But can the king's voice alone achieve for him admission? The texts re mind the challenger that only \"he who knoweth the plan of the hidden shaftwa ys which are in the Land of Seker,\" shall have the ability to journey t hrough the Place of Underground Passages and eat the bread of the gods. Once again the king offers his credentials. \"I am t he Bull, a son of the ancestors of Osiris,\" he announces. Then the gods w ho sponsor him, pronounce in his behalf the crucial words for admis sion: Admittance is not refused thee At the gate of the Duat; The folding doors of the Mountain of Light Are opened to thee; The bolts open to thee of themselves. Thou treadest the Hall of the Two Truths; The god who is in it greets thee."},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Stairway to Heaven 53 The right formula or password having thus been pron ounced, a god named Sa uttered a command; at his word, the flames ceased, the guards withdrew, the doors opened automatically, and the P haraoh was admitted into the subterranean world. \"The mouth of the earth opens for thee, the eastern door of heaven is open for thee,\" the gods of the Duat announce to th e king. He is reassured that though he enters the mouth of the earth, it is indeed the Gateway to Heaven, the coveted eastern door. The journey in the fourth and following Hours leads the king through caverns and tunnels where gods of diverse functions are sometimes seen, sometimes only heard. There are underground canals, on which gods move about in soundless barques. There are eerie lights, phosphorous waters, torches that light the way. Mystified and terrified , the king moves on, toward \"the pillars that reach the Heaven.\" The gods seen along the way are mostly organized in groups of twelve, and bear such epithets as \"Gods of the Mountain,\" \" Gods of the Mountain of the Hidden Land,\" or \"The Holders of the Time of Life in the Hidden Land.\" The drawings that accompanied some of the an cient texts provide identification of these gods through the different scepters held by them, their particular headgear, or by depicting their an imal attributes—hawk- headed, jackal-headed, lion-headed. Serpents also m ake an appearance, representing subterranean guards or servants of the gods in the Hidden Land. The texts and the ancient illustrations suggest tha t the king has entered a circular underground complex, within which a vast t unnel first spirals down and then up. The depictions, presented in a cross-s ection fashion, show a gradually sloping tunnel some forty feet high, with a smooth ceiling and a smooth floor, both made of some solid material two to three feet thick. The tunnel is partitioned into three levels, and the ki ng moves within the middle level or corridor. The upper and lower level s are occupied by gods, serpents and structures of diverse functions. The king's sled, pulled by four gods, begins its jo urney by gliding silently along the middle corridor; only a beam emitted from the vehicle's bow lights the way. But soon the passage is blocked by a sharply slanting partition, and the king must get off and continue o n foot. The partition, as the cross-section depictions show , is one wall of a shaft that cuts across the three tunnel levels (which slo pe at about 15°) at a sharper angle of some 40°. It apparently begins abo ve the tunnel, perhaps at ground level or somewhere higher within the moun tain; it seems to end as it reaches the floor of the lowest, third level. It is called Re-Stau, \"The Path of the Hidden Doors\"; and at the first and sec ond levels, it is indeed provided with chambers that look like air-locks. Th ese chambers enable Seker and other \"hidden gods\" to pass through, thou gh \"the door has no leaves.\" The king, who has left his sled, mysteriou sly passes through this slanting wall simply by virtue of the command of so me god, whose voice"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"Fig. 17 had activated the air-lock. He is greeted on the ot her side by representa- tives of Horus and Thoth, and is passed along from god to god. (Fig. 17.) On his way down, the king sees \"faceless gods\"—gods whose faces cannot be seen. Offended or simply curious, he pleads with them: Uncover your faces, take off your head coverings, when ye meet me; For, behold, I [too] am a mighty god come to be among you. But they do not heed his plea to show their faces; and the texts explain that even they, \"these hidden beings, neither see n or look upon\" their own chief, the god Seker \"when he is in this form himse lf, when he is inside his abode in the earth.\" Spiraling his way down, the king passes through a d oor and finds himself on the third, lowest level. He enters an antechambe r which bears the emblem of the Celestial Disk, and is greeted by the god who is \"The Messenger of Heaven\" and a goddess who wears the fe athered emblem of Shu. \"He who rested the sky upon the Stairway to He aven\" (Fig. 18). As called for by the formula in the Book of the Dead, the king proclaims: Hail, two children of Shu! 54 The Stairway to Heaven"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Stairway to Heaven 55 Hail, children of the Place Of The Horizon . . . May I ascend? May I journey forth like Osiris? The answer must be positive, for the king is admitt ed by them, through a massive door, into the shafts which only the hidden gods use. In the Fifth Hour, the Pharaoh reaches the deepest subterranean parts which are the secret ways of Seker. Following shaft s that incline up, over and down, the Pharaoh cannot see Seker; but the cro ss-section drawings depict the god as a hawk-headed person, standing up on a serpent and holding two wings within a completely enclosed oval structure deep underground, guarded by two sphinxes. Though the ki ng cannot see this chamber, he hears coming from it \"a mighty noise, l ike that heard in the heights of the heavens when they are disturbed by a storm.\" From the sealed chamber there flows a subterranean pool whos e \"waters are like fire.\" Chamber and pool alike are in turn enclosed by a bunkerlike structure, with a compartmentalized air-lock on the left side and a huge door on the right side. As further protection, a mo und of soil is piled up atop the sealed chamber. The mound is topped by a g oddess, whose head only is seen, protruding into the descending corrid or.

The hieroglyphic text adjoining the beetle symbol state s: \"Behold Kheper who, immediately the (boat?) is towed to the top of this circle, connects himself with the ways of the Duat. When this god standeth o n the head of the goddess, he speaks words to Seker every day.\" The passage by the Pharaoh over the hidden chamber of Seker and by the setup through which Seker was informed of such pass age, was deemed a crucial phase in his progress. The Egyptians were n ot the only ones in antiquity who believed that each departed person fa ced a moment of judgment, a spot where their deeds or hearts would be weighed and evaluated and their soul or Double either condemned to the Fiery Waters of Hell, or blessed to enjoy the cool and lifegivin g waters of Paradise. By ancient accounts, here was such a Moment of Truth f or the Pharaoh. Speaking for the Lord of the Duat, the goddess whos e head only was seen announced to the Pharaoh the favorable decision: \"C ome in peace to the Duat . . . advance in thy boat on the road which is in the earth.\" Naming 56 The Stairway to Heaven"},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"The Stairway to Heaven 57 herself Ament (the female Hidden One), she added: \" Ament calls to thee, so that thou mayest go forward in the sky, as the G reat One who is in the Horizon.\" Passing the test, not dying a second time, the king was born again. The way now led by a row of gods whose task it was to p unish the condemned; but the king proceeds unharmed. He rejoins his boat or sled; it is accompanied by a procession of gods; one of them ho lds the emblem of the Tree of Life (Fig. 20). The king has been found worthy of Afterlife. Leaving the zone of Seker, the king enters the sixt h division, associated with Osiris. (In versions of the Book of the Gates, it was in this Sixth Hour that Osiris judged the departed.) Jackal-headed god s \"Who Open the Ways\" invite the king to take a refreshing dip in t he subterranean pool or Lake of Life, as the Great God himself had done whe n he passed here before. Other gods, \"humming as bees,\" reside in cu bicles whose doors fly open by themselves as the king moves by. As he prog resses, the epithets of the gods assume more technical aspects. There are t he twelve gods \"who hold the rope in the Duat,\" and the twelve \"who hol d the measuring cord.\" The sixth division is occupied by a series of chamb ers set close together. A curving path is called \"The Secret Path of the Hi dden Place.\" The king's boat is towed by gods clad in leopard skins, just a s the Shem priests who performed the Opening of the Mouth ceremonies were clad. Is the king nearing the Opening or Mouth of the Mou ntain?

As the king passes through a guarded gate into the seventh division, the gods and the surroundings lose their \"underworld\" a spects and begin to assume celestial affiliations. The king encounters the falcon-headed god Heru-Her-Khent, whose hieroglyphic name included th e stairway symbol and who wore on his head the Celestial Disk emblem. His task is \"to send the star-gods on their way and to make the constell ation-goddesses go on their way.\" These were a group of twelve gods and t welve goddesses who were depicted with star emblems. The incantations t o them were addressed to \"the starry gods\"— who are divine in flesh, whose magical powers have come into being . . . who are united into your stars, who rise up for Ra . . . Let your stars guide his two hands so that he may j ourney to the Hidden Place in peace. In this division, there are also present two compan ies of gods associated with the Ben-ben, the mysterious object of Ra that was kept at his temple in the city of An (Heliopolis). They \"are those who po ssess the mystery,\" guarding it inside the Het-Benben (The Ren-ben Hous e); and eight who guard outside but also \"enter unto the Hidden Objec t.\" Here there are also nine objects, set up in a row, representing the sym bol Shem which hieroglyphically meant \"Follower.\" The king has indeed arrived in parts of the Duat as sociated with An, after whom Heliopolis was named. In the Ninth Hour, he se es the resting place of the twelve \"Divine Rowers of the Boat of Ra,\" th ey who operate Ra's celestial \"Roat of Millions of Years.\" In the Tenth Hour, passing through a gate, the king enters a place astir with activity. The task of the gods there is to provide Flame and Fire to the boat of Ra. One of the gods is called \"Captain of the gods of the boat.\" Two others are t hose \"Who order the course of the stars.\" They and other gods are depic ted with one, two or three star symbols, as though showing some rank ass ociated with the heavens.

They are led or directed by a god with the emblem o f the Celestial Disk upon his head, who stands with outstretched arms be tween the wings of a serpent with four human legs. Against a starry back ground, the god and the serpent face another serpent which, though wingless , clearly flies as it carries aloft a seated Osiris. (Fig. 22). Having been properly equipped, the king is led to a n opening in the center of a semi-circular wall. He passes the hidde n door. Now he moves within a tunnel which is \"1300 cubits long\" called \"Dawn at the End.\" He reaches a vestibule; the emblems of the Winged Disk are seen everywhere.

It is now the twelfth division, the final Hour of t he king's subterranean journey. It is \"the uttermost limit of the thick da rkness.\" The point which he has reached is named \"Mountain of the Ascent of Ra.\" The king looks up and is startled: the celestial boat of Ra looms in front of his eyes, in all its awesome majesty. He has reached an object which is called \"The Ascen der to the Sky.\" Some texts suggest that Ra himself prepared the Asc ender for the king, \"that the king may ascend upon it to the heavens\"; other texts say that the Ascender was made or set up by several other gods. It is \"the Ascender which had carried Seth\" heavenward. Osiris could no t reach the Firmament of Heaven except by means of such an Ascender; thus the king too requires it in order to be translated, as Osiris, to eternal life. The Ascender or Divine Ladder was not a common ladd er. It was bound together by copper cables; \"its sinews (like those) of the Bull of Heaven.\" The \"uprights at its sides\" were covered over tight ly with a kind of \"skin\"; its rungs were \"Shesha-hewn\" (meaning unknown); and \"a great support (was) placed under it by He Who binds.\""},{"pageNumber":61,"pageContent":"60 The Stairway to Heaven Fig. 21 Fig. 22 "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"The Stairway to Heaven 61 Illustrations to the Book of the Dead showed such a Divine Ladder— sometimes with the Ankh (\"Life\") sign symbolically reaching toward the Celestial Disk in the heavens—in the shape of a hig h tower with a superstructure (Fig. 23a, b). In stylized form, th e tower by itself was written hieroglyphic-ally (\"Ded\") and meant \"Everlastingness.\" It was a symbol most closely associated with Osiris, for a p air of such pillars were said to have been erected in front of his prin cipal temple at Abydos, to commemorate the two objects which stood in the Land of Seker and made possible the ascent of Osiris heavenward.

A century or two ago, such a notion would not have even come about, for there was nothing in human experience or knowledge to trigger such fa ntasies. Yet, as we have just described, the Egyptians—5,000 years ago—could readily visualize all this happening to their Phara oh: he would journey to a launch site east of Egypt; he would enter a subterr anean complex of tunnels and chambers; he would safely pass by the installat ion's atomic plant and radiation chamber. He would don the suit and gear o f an astronaut, enter the cabin of an Ascender, and sit strapped between two gods. And then, as the double-doors would open, and the dawn skies wou ld be revealed, the jet engines would ignite and the Ascender would tur n into the Celestial Ladder by which the Pharaoh will reach the Abode of the Gods on their \"Planet of Millions of Years.\" On what TV screens had the Egyptians seen such thin gs happen, that they so firmly believed that all this was really po ssible? In the absence of television in their homes, the on ly alternative would have been to either go to the Spaceport and watch t he rocketships come and go, or visit a \"Smithsonian\" and see the craft on d isplay, accompanied by a knowing guide or viewing flight simulations.

As the Pyramid Texts make clear, the Pharaoh, in hi s Translation into an eternal Afterlife, embarked on a journey simulating the gods. Ra and Seth, Osiris and Horus and other gods had ascended to the heavens in this manner. But, the Egyptians also believed, it was by the same Celestial Boat that the Great Gods had come down to Earth in the f irst place. At the city of An (Heliopolis), Egypt's oldest center of worship, the god Ptah built a special structure—a \"Smithsonian Institution,\" if y ou will—wherein an actual space capsule could be viewed and revered by the people of Egypt! The secret object—the Ben-Ben—was enshrined in the Het Benben, the \"Temple of the Benben.\" We know from the hieroglyph ic depiction of the place's name that the structure looked like a massi ve launch tower from within which a pointed rocket was poised skyward (F ig. 28). The Ben-Ben was, according to the ancient Egyptians , a solid object that had actually come to Earth from the Celestial Disk. It was the \"Celestial Chamber\" in which the great god Ra himself had land ed on Earth; the term Ben (literally: \"That Which Flowed Out\") conveying the combined mean- ings of \"to shine\" and \"to shoot up in the sky.\" An inscription on the stela of the Pharaoh Pi-Ankhi (per Brugsch, Dictionnaire Geographique de l'Ancienne Egypte) sai d thus: The king Pi-Ankhi mounted the stairs toward the lar ge window, in order to view the god Ra within the Ben-Ben. The king per sonally, standing up and being all alone, pushed apart the bolt and open ed the two door- leaves. Then he saw his father Ra in the splendid s anctuary of Het- Benben. He saw the Maad, Ra's Barge; and he saw Sek tet, the Barge of the Aten.

There were those \"who are outsi de the Het-Benben\" but were allowed into the shrine's most sacred part s, for it was their task to receive the offerings from the pilgrims and bring t hem into the temple. The others were primarily guardians, not only of the Be n-Ben itself, but of all \"the secret things of Ra which are in Het-Benben.\" Much as tourists nowadays flock to the Smithsonian to view, admire a nd even touch the actual vehicles flown in space, so did the devout E gyptians make pil- grimages to Heliopolis, to revere and pray to the B en-Ben—probably with a religious fervor akin to that of the faithful Musli ms who make pilgrimages to Mecca, there to pray at the Qa'aba (a black stone b elieved to be a replica of God's \"Celestial Chamber\"). At the shrine, there was a fountain or well, whose waters acquired a reputation for their healing powers, especially in matters of virility and fertility. The term Ben and its hieroglyphic depict ion ∆ in time indeed acquired the connotations virility and reproduction ; and could well have been the source of the meaning \"male offspring'' th at Ben has in Hebrew. In addition to virility and reproduction, the shrin e also acquired the attributes of rejuvenation; this in turn gave rise to the legend of the Ben bird, which the Greeks who had visited Egypt called the Phoenix. As these legends had it. the Phoenix was an eagle with pluma ge partly red and partly golden; once every 500 years, as it was about to di e, it went to Heliopolis and in some manner rose again from the ashes of its elf (or of its father). Heliopolis and its healing waters remained venerate d until early Chris- tian times; local traditions claim that when Joseph and Mary escaped to Egypt with the child Jesus, they rested by the shri ne's well. The shrine at Heliopolis, Egyptian histories tell, was destroyed several times by enemy invaders. Nothing remains of it nowa days; the Ben-Ben is also gone. But it was depicted on Egyptian monument s as a conical chamber within which a god could be seen. Archaeolo gists have in fact found a stone scale-model of the Ben-Ben. showing a god at its open hatch- door in a gesture of welcome (Fig. 29). The true sh ape of the Celestial Chamber was probably accurately depicted in the tom b of Huy (Fig. 27); that modern command modules—the capsules housing th e astronauts atop rocketships at launching, and in which they splash down back to Earth— Fig. 30—look so similar to the Ben-Ben. is no doubt a result of similarity of purpose and function. In the absence of the Ben-Ben itself, is there any other physical piece of evidence—and not mere drawings or scale models—left from the He- liopolitan shrine?

Archaeologists may also have found a replica of one of these smaller objects. It is an oddly shaped circular object full of intricate curves and cutouts (Fig. 31a); it has baffled all scholars sin ce its discovery in 1936. It is important to realize that the object was found—amon g other \"unusual copper objects\"—in the tomb of the crown prince Sab u, son of King Adjib of the First Dynasty. It is, therefore, certain tha t the object was placed in the tomb circa 3100 B . C . It could have been older, but certainly not more recent, than that date. Reporting on the discoveries in northern Saqqara (j ust south of the great pyramids at Gizah), Walter B. Emery (Great Tombs of the First Dynasty) described the object as a \"bowl-like vessel of schi st,\" and remarked that \"No satisfactory explanation of the curious design of this object has been forthcoming.\" The object was carved from a solid bl ock of schist—a rock which is very brittle and which easily splits into thin, irregular layers. If it were put to any use, it would have quickly broken a part; so the particular stone was chosen because the very unusual and delic ate shape could best be carved out in such a material—a means to preserve t he shape, rather than to actually use it. This has led other scholars, su ch as Cyril Aldred (Egypt to the End of the Old Kingdom) to conclude that the st one object \"possibly imitates a form originally made in metal.\" But what metal could have been used in the fourth m illennium B.C. to produce the object, what process of precision grind ing, what s k i l l e d metallurgists were then available to create such a delicate and structurally complex design?

The round object, some twenty -four inches in diameter and less than four inches at its thickest part, was obviously made to fit over a shaft and rotate around an axle. Its three oddly cu rving cutouts suggest a possible immersion in a liquid during rotation. There was no further effort made after 1936 to unra vel the object's enigma. But its possible function suddenly sprang t o our mind in 1976 on reading in a technical magazine of some revolutiona ry designs of a flywheel being developed in California in connection with th e American space program. The flywheel, attached to a rotating shaft of a machine or an engine, has been in use for less than two centuries as a means of regulating the speed of machinery, as well as for accumulating energy for a single spurt, such as in a metal press (or more recently i n aviation). As a rule, flywheels have had heavy rims, for the e nergy' is stored in the wheel's circumference. But in the 1970s, engineers of the Lockheed Missile & Space Company came up with an opposite design—a l ight-rimmed wheel, claiming it is best suited for saving energy in mass transit trains or storing energy in electrically powered trolley-buse s. The research was continued by the Airesearch Manufacturing Company; the model they developed—but never finally perfected—was to be her metically sealed within a housing filled with lubricant. That their revolutionary flywheel (Fig. 32) looks like the 5,000-year-old object disc overed in Egypt is only less amazing than the fact that the perfected objec t from 3100 B.C. looks like a piece of equipment still in the development stage by space engineers in A .

Like so many ar tifacts whose existence in antiquity has been documented by the ancient people s beyond doubt, they have all disappeared—destroyed perhaps by natural c alamities or wars, perhaps dismantled and taken elsewhere—as war booty , or for safekeeping and hiding away in places long forgotten. Perhaps t hey were carried back to the heavens; perhaps they are still with us, unreco gnized for what they are in some museum basement. Or—as the legend of the Ph oenix which connects Heliopolis and Arabia might suggest—hidden under the sealed chamber of the Qa'aba in Mecca . . .

We k now that the shrines of Heliopolis were destroyed during the years of disor der; it was then, perhaps, that Ra left his temple at Heliopolis and became Amon—the \"Hidden God.\" When order was first restored in Upper Egypt under the Eleventh Dynasty, the capital was established at Thebes and the supreme god was called Amon (or Amen).

The dynasty's first Pharaoh, Amen-Em-Hat I, immediately undertook the rebuilding of the temples and shrines of Heliopolis ; but whether he could also restore the original artifacts enshrined there , or had to do with their stone simulations, no one can say for certain. His son, the Pharaoh Sen- Usert (Kheper-Ka-Ra)—the Sesostris or Sesonchusis o f Greek historians— erected in front of the temple two huge granite col umns (over sixty-six feet high).

Pictorially, then, the Egyptians affirmed from the very beginning that their gods had come to Egypt from elsewhere. This c onfirmed the tales of how Egypt began—that the god Ptah. having come from the south, and having found Egypt inundated, performed great works of dyking and land reclamation and made the land habitable. There was a place in Egyptian geography which they called Ta Neter—\"Place/Land of the Gods.\" It was the narrow straits at the southern end of the Red S ea which is now called Bab-el-Mandeb; it was through that strait that the ships bearing the ensign NTR and carrying the horned gods had come to Egypt. The Egyptian name for the Red Sea was the Sea of UR . The term Ta Ur meant the Foreign Land in the East. Henri Gauthier, who compiled the Dictionnaire des Noms Geographiques from all the pl ace names in the hieroglyphic texts, pointed out that the hieroglyph for Ta Ur \"was a symbol which designated a nautical element . . .

There are more clues. Ta Ur literally meant the Lan d of UR, and the name Ur was not unknown. It was the birthplace of A braham, the Hebrew patriarch. Descended of Shem, the elder son of Noah (the biblical hero of the Deluge), he was born to his father Terah at the city of Ur, in Chaldea; \"and Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of H aran, his son's son, and Sarah his daughter-in-law, the wife of Abram; and t hey went forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the Land of Canaan.\" When archaeologists and linguists began to unravel, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the history and written rec ords of Egypt, Ur was unknown from any other source except the Old Testam ent. Chaldea, however, was known: it was the name by which the Gr eeks had called Babylonia, Mesopotamia's ancient kingdom. The Greek historian Herodotus, who had visited Egyp t and Babylonia in the fifth century B.C., found many similarities in the customs of the Egyptians and the Chaldeans. Describing the sacred precinct of the supreme god Bel (whom he called Jupiter Belus) in t he city of Babylon, and its huge stage tower, he wrote that \"on the upmost tower there is a spacious temple, and inside the temple stands a couch of unu sual size, richly adorned, with a golden table by its side. There is no statue of any kind set up in the place, nor is the chamber occupied by nig hts by anyone but a native woman, who, as the Chaldeans, the priests of this god, affirm, is chosen for himself by the deity. . . . They also de clare . . . that the god comes down in person into this chamber, and sleeps upon the couch. This is like the story of the Egyptians of what takes place in their city Thebes, where the woman always passes the night in the temp le of the Theban Jupiter (Amon).\" The more nineteenth-century scholars learnt of Egyp t, and matched the emerging historic picture with the writings of Gree k and Roman historians, the more did two facts stand out: First, that Egypt ian civilization and greatness were not like an isolated flower blooming in a cultural desert, but part of overall developments throughout the ancient lands. And secondly, that the biblical tales of other lands and kingdoms , of fortified cit ies and trade routes, of wars and treaties, of migrations a nd settlements—were not only true, but also accurate. The Hittites, known for centuries only from brief m entions in the Bible, were discovered in Egyptian records as mighty adver saries of the Pharaohs. A totally unknown page of history—a pivotal battle between Egyptian armies and Hittite legions which came from Asia Min or, that had taken place at Kadesh in northern Canaan—was discovered n ot only in text, but also depicted pictorially on temple walls.

Greatest of all, however, appeared to ha ve been the veritable ancient empires of Assyria and Babylonia; but where were their magnificent temples, and other remains of their grandeur? And w here were their records? All that travelers had reported from the Land Betwe en The Two Rivers, the vast plain between the Euphrates and the Tigris , were mounds—tells in Arabic and Hebrew. In the absence of stone, even th e grandest structures of ancient Mesopotamia were built of mud bricks; wa rs, weather and time reduced them to heaps of soil. Instead of monumenta l structures, these lands yielded occasional finds of small artifacts; among them there often were tablets of baked clay inscribed with wedge-lik e markings. Back in 1686, a traveler named Engelbert Kampfer visited Pe rsepolis, the Old Persian capital of the kings whom Alexander had fou ght. From monuments there, he copied signs and symbols in such a wedge- shaped or cuneiform script, as on the royal seal of Darius (Fig. 37). B ut he thought that they were only decorations. When it was finally realized that these were inscriptions, no one knew what their language was a nd how they could be deciphered. As in the case of the Egyptian hieroglyphs, so it w as with the cuneiform writings: The key to the solution was a tri-lingual inscription. It was found carved on the rocks of forbidding mountains, at a p lace in Persia called Behistun. In 1835, a major in the British Army, Hen ry Rawlinson, managed to copy the inscription, and thereafter decipher th e script and its languages. As it turned out, the tri-lingual rock inscription was in Old Persian, Elamite and Akkadian. Akkadian was the mother-language of a ll the Semitic languages; and it was through the knowledge of Hebr ew that scholars were Fig. 37"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"The Gods Who Came to Planet Earth 81 able to read and understand the Mesopotamian inscri ptions of the Assyrians and the Babylonians. Spurred by such discoveries, a Paris-born Englishma n named Henry Austen Layard reached Mosul, a caravan junction in northeastern Iraq (then part of the Ottoman-Turkish Empire) in 1840. There he was the guest of William F. Ainsworth, whose Researches in Assyria, Babylonia and Chaldea (1838)—along with earlier reports and small finds by Claudius J. Rich (Memoir on the Ruins of Babylon)—not only fire d Layard's imagina- tion, but also led to scientific and monetary suppo rt from the British Museum and the Royal Geographical Society. Versed b oth in the pertinent biblical references and the Greek classical writing s, Layard kept recalling that an officer in Alexander's army reported seeing in the area \"a place of pyramids and remains of an ancient city\"—a city who se ruins were considered ancient even in Alexander's times! His local friends showed him the various tells in t he area, indicating that there were ancient cities buried beneath them. His excitement grew most when he reached a place called Birs Nimrud. \"I saw for the first time the great conical mound of Nimrud rising against the cl ear evening sky,\" he later wrote in his Autobiography. \"The impression t hat it made upon me was one never to be forgotten.\" Was it not the plac e of the buried pyramid seen by Alexander's officer? And surely was the pla ce associated with the biblical Nimrod, \"the mighty hunter by the grace of the Lord,\" who launched the kingdoms and royal cities of Mesopotam ia (Genesis X)— And the beginning of his kingdom: Babel and Erech a nd Akkad, all in the Land of Shin'ar, Out of that land there emanated As hur, where Nineveh was built—a city of wide streets; and Khalah, and R essen. With the support of Major Rawlinson, who by then wa s the British Resident and Consul in Baghdad, Layard returned in 1845 to Mosul to begin digging at his cherished Nimrud. But whatever he was to find—and find he did—the claim to be the first modern archae ologist in Mesopotamia was not to be his. Two years earlier, Paul-Emile Bo tta, the French Consul at Mosul (whom Layard had met and befriended) proce eded to excavate a mound somewhat north of Mosul, on the other side of the Tigris River. The natives called the place Khorsabad; the cuneiform i nscriptions uncovered there identified it as Dur-Sharru-Kin, the ancient capital of the biblical Sargon, king of Assyria. Commanding the vast city a nd its palaces and temples was indeed a pyramid constructed in seven s teps, the term for which is ziggurat (Fig. 38). Spurred by Botta's discoveries, Layard began to dig at his chosen mound, where he believed he would uncover Nineveh, the Ass yrian capital of biblical renown.

They included an obelisk set up by King Shal- maneser II, on which he listed among those paying h im tribute \"Jehu, son of Omri, king of Israel\" (Fig. 39). Assyrian finds now directly confirmed the historica l veracity of the Old Testament. Encouraged, Layard began to excavate in 1849 a moun d directly opposite Mosul, on the eastern banks of the Tigris. The plac e, locally named Kuyunjik, was indeed Nineveh— the capital establish ed by Sennacherib, the Assyrian king whose army was smitten by the Lor d's angel when he besieged Jerusalem (II Kings 18). After him, Nineve h served as the capital of Esarhaddon and Ashurbanipal. The art treasures c arted off from there to the British Museum still make up the most impressiv e portion of its Assyrian displays. As the pace of excavations gathered momentum, as ar chaeological teams from other nations joined the race, all the Assyria n and Babylonian cities named in the Bible (with one minor exception) were uncovered. But as the world's museums filled up with the ancient treasure s, the most important finds were the simple clay tablets—some small enoug h to be held in the palm of the scribe's hand—on which the Assyrians, B abylonians and other peoples of western Asia wrote down commercial contr acts, court rulings, marriage and inheritance records, geographical list s, mathematical informa- tion, medical formulas, laws and regulations, royal histories—indeed, every aspect of life by advanced and highly civilized soc ieties. Epic tales, Creation tales, proverbs, philosophical writings, love songs and the like made up a vast literary heritage. And there were matters cele stial—lists of stars and constellations, planetary information, astronomical tables; and lists of gods, their family relationships, their attributes, their tasks and functions—gods headed by twelve Great Gods, \"Gods of Heaven and Ea rth,\" with whom there were associated the twelve months, the twelve constellations of the Zodiac, and twelve members of our solar system. As the inscriptions themselves occasionally stated, their language stemmed from the Akkadian. This and other evidence confirme d the biblical narrative, that Assyria and Babylon (which appeared on the historical stage circa 1900 B.C.) were preceded by a kingdom named A kkad. It was founded by Sharru-Kin—\"the Righteous Ruler\"—whom we call Sa rgon I, circa 2400 B.C. Some of his inscriptions were also found; in t hem he boasted that by the grace of his god Enlil, his empire stretched fr om the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea. He called himself \"King of Akkad , King of Kish\"; and he claimed to have \"defeated Uruk, tore down its wa ll . . .

And the beginning of his kingdom: Babel and Erech and Akkad, All in the Land of Shin'ar. The royal city of Akkad was discovered southeast of Babylon; the ancient city of Kish was also discovered, southeast of Akka d. Indeed, the more archaeologists moved down in the plain between the two rivers, in a southeasterly direction, the greater was the antiqu ity of the places unearthed. At a place now called Warka, the city of Uruk, which Sargon I claimed to have defeated, the biblical Erech, was f ound. It took the archaeologists from the third millennium B.C. to th e fourth millennium B.C.! There, they found the first-ever pottery baked in a kiln; evidence of the first-ever use of a potters wheel; a pavement of li mestone blocks which is the oldest of its kind; the first-ever ziggurat (st ep pyramid); and the world's first written records: inscribed texts (Fig. 40) an d engraved cylinder seals (Fig. 41) which, when rolled on wet clay, left a pe rmanent imprint. Ur—birthplace of Abraham—was also found, farther so uth, where the coastline of the Persian Gulf had reached in antiqu ity. It was a great commercial center, site of a huge ziggurat, the sea t of many dynasties. Was then the southern, more ancient part of Mesopotamia , the biblical Land of Shin'ar—the place where the events of the Tower of Babel had taken place? One of the greatest discoveries in Mesopotamia was the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, which contained more than 25,000 tablets arranged by subject. A king of great culture, Ashur banipal collected every text he could lay his hands on, and in addition set his scribes to copy and translate texts otherwise unavailable. Many tablets were identified by the scribes as \"copies of olden texts.\" A group of twen ty-three tablets, for example, ended with the postscript: \"twenty-third t ablet; language of Shumer not changed.\" Ashurbanipal himself stated in an inscription: The god of scribes has bestowed on me the gift of t he knowledge of his art. I have been initiated into the secrets of writ ing. I can even read the intricate tablets in Shumerian. I understand the en igmatic words in the stone carvings from the days before the Deluge. In 1853, Henry Rawlinson suggested to the Royal Asi atic Society that there possibly was an unknown language that precede d Akkadian, pointing out that the Assyrian and Babylonian texts often us ed words borrowed from that unknown language, especially in scientific or religious texts. In 1869 Jules Oppert proposed at a meeting of the French So ciety of Numismatics and Archaeology that recognition be given to the ex istence of such an early language and of the people who spoke and wrote it.

It was, in fact, the biblical Land of Shin'ar. It w as the land whose name— Shunter—literally meant Land of the Watchers. It wa s indeed the Egyptian Ta Meter—Land of the Watchers, the land from which the gods had come to Egypt. As difficult as it was at the time, scholars have a ccepted, after the grandeur and antiquity of Egypt had been unearthed, that civ ilization (as known to the West) did not begin in Rome and Greece. Could i t now be, as the Egyptians themselves had suggested, that civilizati on and religion began not in Egypt, but in southern Mesopotamia? In the century that followed the first Mesopotamian discoveries, it has become evident beyond doubt that it was indeed in S umer (scholars find this spelling easier to pronounce) that modern Civi lization (with a capital 'C') began. It was there, soon after 4000 B.C.—near ly 6,000 years ago—that all the essential elements of a high civilization s uddenly blossomed out, as though from nowhere and for no apparent reason. The re is hardly any aspect of our present culture and civilization whos e roots and precursors cannot be found in Sumer: cities, high-rise buildin gs, streets, marketplaces, granaries, wharves, schools, temples; metallurgy, m edicine, surgery, textile making, gourmet foods, agriculture, irrigat ion; the use of bricks, the invention of the kiln; the first-ever wheel, carts; ships and navigation; international trade; weights and measures; kingship , laws, courts, juries; writing and recordkeeping; music, musical notes, mu sical instruments, dance and acrobatics; domestic animals and zoos; wa rfare, artisanship, prostitution. And above all: the knowledge and stud y of the heavens, and the gods \"who from the Heavens to Earth had come.\" Let it be clarified here that neither the Akkadians nor the Sumerians had called these visitors to Earth gods. It is through later paganism that the notion of divine beings or gods has filtered into o ur language and thinking. When we employ the term here, it is only because of its general acceptance and usage that we do so. The Akkadians called them Ilu—\"Lofty Ones\"—from whi ch the Hebrew, biblical El stems. The Canaanites and Phoenicians c alled them Ba'al— Lord. But at the very beginning of all these religi ons, the Sumerians called them DIN.GIR, \"the Righteous Ones of the Rocketship s.\" In the early pictographic writing of the Sumerians (which was la ter stylized into cuneiform wedge-writing), the terms DIN a nd GIR were written When the two are combined we can see that the cutter or GIR—shaped like a conical-pyramidical com mand module—fits perfectly into the nose of the DIN, pictured as a m ulti-stage rocket.

From the Sumerian cosmological tales and epic poems , from texts that served as autobiographies of these gods, from lists of their functions and relationships and cities, from chronologies and his tories called King Lists, and a wealth of other texts, inscriptions and drawi ngs, we have pieced together a cohesive drama of what had happened in p rehistoric times, and how it all began. Their story begins in primeval times, when our sola r system was still young. It was then that a large planet appeared fro m outer space and was drawn into the Solar System. The Sumerians called t he invader NIBIRU — \"Planet of the Crossing\"; the Babylonian name for i t was Marduk. As it passed by the outer planets, Marduk's course curved in, to a collision course with an old member of the Solar System —a pl anet named Tiamat. As the two came together, the satellites of Marduk spl it Tiamat in half. Its lower part was smashed into bits and pieces, creati ng the comets and the asteroid belt—the \"celestial bracelet\" of planetary debris that orbits between Jupiter and Mars. Tiamat's upper part, toge ther with its chief satellite, were thrown into a new orbit, to become Earth and the Moon.

It was thus that th e Solar System ended up with twelve members —the Sun, the Moon (which the S umerians consid- ered a celestial body in its own right), the nine p lanets we know of, and one more—the twelfth: Marduk. When Marduk invaded our solar system, it brought wi th it the seed of life. In the collision with Tiamat, some of the see d of life was transferred to its surviving part—Planet Earth. As life evolved on Earth, it emulated evolution on Marduk. And so it was that when on Ear th the human species just began to stir, on Marduk intelligent beings ha d already achieved high levels of civilization and technology. It was from that twelfth member of the Solar System , the Sumerians said, that astronauts had come to Earth —the \"Gods of Hea ven and Earth.\" It was from such Sumerian beliefs, that all the other anci ent peoples acquired their religions and gods. These gods, the Sumerians said, created Mankind and eventually gave it civilization—all knowledge, all sciences, including an incredible level of a sophisticated astronomy. This knowledge encompassed recognition of the Sun a s the central body of the Solar System, cognizance of all the planets we know of today—even the outer planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, which are relatively recent discoveries of modern astronomy—planets which could not have been observed and identified with the naked eye. And, in planetary texts and lists, as well as in pictorial depictions, the Sume rians insisted that there was one more planet—NIBIRU, Marduk— which, when nearest Earth, passed Fig. 44"},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":" Fig. 45 The sophistication in celestial knowledge—attribute d by the Sumerians to the astronauts who had come from Marduk—was not limited to familiarity with the Solar System. There was the en dless universe, full of stars. It was first-ever in Sumer—not centuries lat er in Greece, as has been thought—that the stars were identified, grouped tog ether into con- stellations, given names, and located in the heaven s. All the constellations we now recognize in the northern skies, and most of the constellations of the southern skies, are listed in Sumerian astronom ical tablets—in their correct order and by names which we have been using to this very day! Of the greatest importance were the constellations which appear to ring the plane or band in which the planets orbit the Su n. Called by the Sumerians UL.HE (\"The Shiny Herd\")—which the Greeks adopted as the zodiakos kyklos (\"Animal Circle\") and we still call the Zodiac—they were arranged in twelve groups, to form the twelve House s of the Zodiac. Not only the names by which these star groups were call ed by the Sumerians— Bull (Taurus), Twins (Gemini), The Pincer (Cancer), Lion (Leo) and so exactly on—but even their pictorial depictions have remained unchanged through the millenia (Fig. 46). The much later Egyp tian Zodiac representa- tions were almost identical to the Sumerian ones (F ig. 47). In addition to the concepts of a spherical astronom y that we employ to this very day (including the notions of a celestial axis, poles, ecliptic, equinoxes and the like) which were already perfecte d in Sumerian times, there was also the astounding familiarity with the phenomenon of Preces- sion. As we now know, there is an i l l u s i o n of a ret ardation in Earth's orbit as an observer from Earth pinpoints the Sun on a fixed date (such as the first 90 The Stairway to Heaven between Mars and Jupiter, as shown on this 4,500-ye ar-old cylinder seal (Fig. 45)."},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":" Fig. 46 clay of spring) against the Zodiac constellations t hat act as a backdrop in space. Caused by the fact that the Earth's axis is inclined relatively to its plane of orbit around the Sun, this retardation or Precession is infinitesimal in terms of human lifespans: in seventy-two years, the shift in the Zodiac backdrop is a mere 1° of the 360° Celestial Circle. Since the Zodiac circle surrounding the band in whi ch Earth (and other planets) orbits around the Sun was divided into an arbitrary twelve Houses, each takes up one-twelfth of the full circle, or a celestial space of 30°. It thus takes Earth 2,160 years (72 x 30) to retard through the full span of a Zodiac House. In other words, if an astronomer on Earth ha s been observing (as is now done) the spring day when the Sun began to rise against the constellation or House of Pisces, his descendants 2 ,160 years later would observe the event with the Sun against the backdrop of the adjacent constellation, the \"House\" of Aquarius. No single man, perhaps even no single nation, could have possibly observed, noted and understood the phenomenon in an tiquity. Yet the evidence is irrefutable: The Sumerians, who began t heir time-counting or calendar in the Age of Taurus (which began circa 44 00 B.C.), were aware of and recorded in their astronomical lists the previo us precessional shifts to Gemini (circa 6500 B.C.), Cancer (circa 8700 B.C.) and Leo (circa 10,900 B.C.)! Needless to say, it was duly recognized circ a 2200 B.C. that the first day of spring—New Year to the peoples of Mesopotami a—retarded a full 30° and shifted to the constellation or \"Age\" of Ar ies, the Ram (KU.MAL in Sumerian). It has been recognized by some of the earlier schol ars who combined The Gods Who Came to Planet Earth 91"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":" Fig. 47"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"The Gods Who Came to Planet Earth 93 their knowledge of Egyptology/Assyriology with astr onomy, that the textual and pictorial depictions employed the Zodiac Age as a grand celestial calendar, whereby events on Earth were related to t he grander scale of the heavens. The knowledge has been employed in more re cent times as a means of prehistoric and historic chronological aid in such studies as that by G. de Santillana and H. von Dechend (Hamlet's Mill) . There is no doubt, for example, that the Lion-like Sphinx south of Hel iopolis, or the Ram-like Sphinxes guarding the temples of Karnak, depicted t he Zodiac ages in which the events they stood for had occurred, or in which the gods or kings represented had been supreme. Central to this knowledge of astronomy, and in cons equence to all the religions, beliefs, events and depictions of the an cient world, was thus the conviction that there is one more planet in our sol ar system, a planet with the vastest orbit, a supreme planet or \"Celestial L ord\"—the one the Egyptians called the Imperishable Star, or the \"Pla net of Millions of Years\"—the celestial abode of the gods. The ancient peoples, without exception, paid homage to this planet, the one with the vastest, most majestic orbit. In Egypt, in Mesopotamia and elsewh ere, its ubiquitous emblem was that of the Winged Globe (Fig. 48). Recognizing that the Celestial Disk, in Egyptian de pictions, stood for the Celestial Abode of Ra, scholars have persisted in r eferring to Ra as a \"Sun God\" and to the Winged Disk as a \"Sun Disk.\" It sho uld now be clear that it was not the Sun, but the Twelfth Planet which was s o depicted. Indeed, Egyptian depictions clearly distinguished between t he Celestial Disk representing this planet, and the Sun. As can be se en (Fig. 49), both were shown in the heavens (represented by the arched for m of the goddess Nut); clearly, then, two celestial bodies and not a singl e one are involved. Clearly too, the Twelfth Planet is shown as a celestial glo be or disk—a planet; whereas the Sun is shown emitting its benevolent ra ys (in this instance, on the goddess Hat-Hor, \"Lady of the Mines\" of the Sin ai peninsula). Did the Egyptians then, as the Sumerians, know thou sands of years ago that the Sun was the center of the solar system, an d that the system consisted of twelve members? We know that it was so from actual celestial maps depicted on mummy coffins. A well-preserved one, discovered by H. K. Brugsch i n 1857 in a tomb at Thebes (Fig. 50), shows the goddess Nut (\"The Heave ns\") in the central panel (painted atop the coffin), surrounded by the twelve constellations of the Zodiac. On the sides of the coffin, the bottom rows depict the twelve hours of the night and of the day. Then the planets —the Celestial Gods— are shown traveling in their prescribed orbits, the Celestial Barques (the Sumerians called these orbits the \"destinies\" of th e planets). In the central position, we see the globe of the Su n, emitting rays. Near the Sun, by Nut's raised left hand, we see two plan ets: Mercury and Venus.

Then, in the left-hand pan el, we see Earth (accompanied by the emblem of Horus), the Moon, Mar s and Jupiter as Celestial Gods traveling in their Celestial Barques . We see four more Celestial Gods beyond Jupiter, on the right-hand panel. With orbits unknown to the Egyptians (and th us without Barques), we see Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. The time of mummification is marked by the Spearman pointing his spear into the midst of the Bull (Taurus). We thus encounter all the planets in their correct order, including the outer planets whom modern astronomers discovered on ly rather recently (Brugsch, as others of his time, was unaware of the existence of Pluto). Scholars who have studied the planetary knowledge i n antiquity assumed that the ancient peoples believed that five planets —the Sun being one of them—circled Earth. Any depiction or listing of mor e planets, these scholars held, was due to some \"confusion.\" But the re was no confusion; rather—impressive accuracy: that the Sun was in the system's center, that Earth was a planet, and that in addition to Earth a nd Moon and the other eight planets known to us today, there is one more large planet. It is depicted atop all others, above the head of Nut, as a major Celestial Lord with its own huge celestial orbit (\"Celestial Barqu e\").

Having murd ered Abel—there is a hint of homosexuality as the cause—Cain was expelle d farther east, to the \"Land of Migrations.\" There his wife bore him Enoch —a name meaning \"Foundation\"; and the Bible explains that Cain \"was building a city\" when Enoch was born, \"so he named the city Enoch,' as a namesake of his son Enoch.\" (The application of the same name to a pers on and the city associated with him was a custom that prevailed thr oughout the history of the ancient Near East.) The line of Cain continued through Irad, Mechuyah-e l, Metusha-el and Lamech. The first son of Lamech was Jabal—a name wh ich in the original Hebrew (Yuval) means \"The Lute Player.\" As the Book of Genesis explains, \"Jabal was the ancestor of all such as play the har p and the lyre.\" A second son of Cain, Tubal-Cain, could \"sharpen all cutters of copper and iron.\" What became of these capable people in the eastern Lands of Migration, we are no longer told; for the Old Testament, consider ing the line of Cain to be accursed, lost all interest in tracking further the ir genealogies and fate. Instead, the Book of Genesis (in Chapter V) turns b ack to Adam and to his third son Seth. Adam, we are told, was 130 year s old when Seth was born, and lived another 800 years for a total of 93 0 years. Seth, who fathered Enosh at age 105, lived to be 912. Enosh b egot Cainan at age 90, and died at age 905. Cainan lived to the ripe age o f 910; his son Mahalal-el was 895 years old when he died; and his son, Jared, passed on at age 962. For all these pre-Diluvial patriarchs, the Book of Genesis provides the bare biographical information: who was their father , when their male heir was born, and (after \"giving birth to other sons an d daughters\") when they died. But when the next patriarch is listed, he get s special treatment: And Jared lived a hundred and sixty-two years, and begot Enoch . . . And Enoch lived sixty-five years, and begot Methuse lah. And Enoch walked with the Lord, after he had begott en Methusaleh,"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"In the Days Before the Deluge 99 for three hundred years; and he begot (other) sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and si xty and five years. And here comes the explanation—an astounding explan ation—of why Enoch was singled out for so much attention and bio graphical detail: Enoch did not die! For Enoch had walked with the Lord, and was gone; f or the Lord had taken him away. Methusaleh lived the longest—969 years—and was succ eeded by Lamech. Lantech (who lived to be 777 years) begot N oah—the hero of the Deluge. Here too there is a brief biographical-hist orical note: Lamech had so named his son, we are informed, because Mankind was undergoing at that time great sufferings, and the earth was barre n and unproductive. In naming his son Noah (\"Respite\"), Lamech expressed t he hope that This one shall bring us respite of our toil and frustrat ions of the land which the Lord had cursed.\" And so, through ten generations of pre-Diluvial pat riarchs blessed with what scholars call \"legendary\" life spans, the bibl ical narrative reaches the momentous events of the Deluge. The Deluge is presented in the Book of Genesis as t he opportunity seized by the Lord \"to destroy the Man whom I had created from the face of the Earth.\" The ancient authors found it necessary to p rovide an explanation for such a far-reaching decision. It had to do, we are told, with Man's sexual perversions; specifically, with the sexual relation s between \"the daughters of Man\" and \"the sons of the gods.\" In spite of the monotheistic endeavors of the compi lers and editors of the Book of Genesis, struggling to proclaim faith in a sole deity in a world that in those days believed in many gods, there remain n umerous slip-ups where the biblical narrative speaks of gods in the plural. The very term for \"deity,\" (when the Lord is not specifically named a s Yahweh), is not the singular El but the plural Elohim. When the idea of creating Adam occurs, the narrative adopts the plural language: \"And Eloh im (= the deities) said: 'Let us make Man in our image and after our Likenes s. \" And when the incident with the Fruit of Knowing had occurred, El ohim again spoke in the plural to unnamed colleagues. Now, it transpires from four enigmatic verses of Ge nesis VI that set the stage for the Deluge, that not only were there deit ies in the plural, but that they even had sons (in the plural). These sons upse t the Lord by having sex with the daughters of Man, compounding their sins b y having children or demi-gods born from this illicit lovemaking. And it came to pass When the Earthlings began to multiply upon the Eart h, and daughters were born unto them—"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"100 The Stairway to Heaven That the sons of the gods saw the daughters of Adam , that they were good; And they took them for wives, of all which they cho se. And the Old Testament explains further: The Nefilim were upon the Earth in those days and t hereafter too; Those sons of the gods who cohabited with the daugh ters of the Adam, and they bore children unto them. They were the Mighty Ones of Eternity, the People o f the Shetn. Nefilim—traditionally translated \"giants\"—literally means \"Those Who Were Cast Upon\" the earth. They were the \"Sons of t he Gods\"—\"the people of the Shem,\" the People of the Rocketships. We are back to Sumer and the DIN.GIR, the \"Righteou s Ones of the Rocket Ships.\" Let us then pick up the Sumerian record where we le ft off—450,000 years ago. It was some 450,000 years ago, the Sumerian texts c laim, that astronauts from Marduk came to Earth in search of gold. Not fo r jewelry, but for some pressing need affecting survival on the Twelfth Pla net. The first landing party numbered fifty astronauts; they were called Anunnaki—\"Those of Heaven Who Are on Earth.\" They s plashed down in the Arabian Sea, and made their way to the head of the Persian Gulf, establishing there their first Earth Station E.RI.D U—\"Home in Faraway Built.\" Their commander was a brilliant scientist a nd engineer who loved to sail the seas, whose hobby was fishing. He was call ed E.A—\"He Whose House Is Water,\" and was depicted as the prototype Aquarius; but having led the landing on Earth, he was given the title EN .KI—\"Lord Earth.\" Like all the Sumerian gods, his distinguishing feat ure was the horned headdress (Fig. 51). The original plan, it appears, was to extract the g old from the seawaters; but the plan proved unsatisfactory. The only altern ative was to do it the hard way: to mine ores in southeastern Africa, haul them by ship to Mesopotamia, and there smelt and refine them. The r efined gold ingots were then sent aloft in Shuttlecraft, to an Earth-o rbiting craft. There they awaited the periodic arrival of the Mother Spaceshi p, which took the precious metal back home. To make this possible, more Anunnaki were landed on Earth, until their number reached 600; another 300 serviced the Shuttl ecraft and orbiting station. A Spaceport was built at Sippar (\"Bird Tow n\") in Mesopotamia, on a site aligned with the Near East's most conspicuou s landmark—the peaks of Ararat. Other settlements with various functions —such as the smelting and refining center of Bad-Tibira, a medical center named Shuruppak—"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"In the Days Before the Deluge 101 were laid out to form an arrow-like Landing Corrido r. In the exact center, NIBRU.KI—\"The Crossing Place on Earth\" (Nippur in A kkadian)—was established as the Mission Control Center. The commander of this expanded enterprise on Planet Earth was EN.LIL—\"Lord of the Command.\" In the early Sumerian pictographic writing, Enid's name and his Mission Control Center were depicted as a complex of structures with tall antennas and wide r adar screens (Fig. 52). Both Ea/Enki and Enlil were sons of the then ruler on the Twelfth Planet, AN (Akkadian Anu), whose name meant \"He of the Heavens\" and was written pictographically as a star Ea was the firstborn; but because Enlil was born to Anu by another wife who w as also his half-sister, Enlil and not Ea was the heir to the throne. Now En lil was sent to Earth, and took over the command from Ea, the so-called Lo rd Earth. Matters were further complicated by the despatch to Earth a s Chief Medical Officer of NIN.HUR.SAG (\"Lady of the Mountainpeak\"), a half -sister of both Ea and Enlil—enticing both brothers to seek her favors ; for by the same rules of succession, a son to one of them by her would in herit the throne. The lingering resentment on Ea's part, compounded by th e growing competi- tion between the brothers, eventually spilled off t o their offspring and was the underlying cause of many events that followed. Fig. 51 Fig. 52 "},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"102 The Stairway to Heaven As the millennia passed on Earth —though to the Anu nnaki each 3,600 years were but one year of their own life cycles —t hese rank-and-file astronauts began to grumble and complain. Was it in deed their task as spacemen to dig for ores deep inside dark, dusty, h ot mines? Ea—perhaps to avoid friction with his brother—spent more and m ore time in south- eastern Africa, away from Mesopotamia. The Anunnaki who toiled in the mines addressed their complaints to him; together t hey talked over their mutual dissatisfactions. Then, one day, as Enlil arrived in the mining area for a tour of inspection, the signal was given. A mutiny was declared. The An unnaki left the mines, put their tools on fire, marched on Enlil's residen ce and encircled it, shouting: \"No more!\" Enlil contacted Anu and offered to resign his comma nd and return to the home planet. Anu came down to Earth. A court-martia l was held. Enlil demanded that the instigator of the mutiny be put t o death. The Anunnaki, all as one, refused to divulge his identity. Hearin g the evidence, Anu concluded that the work was indeed too harsh. Was t he gold mining then to be discontinued? Ea then offered a solution. In southeastern Africa, he said, there roamed a being that could be trained to perform some of th e mining tasks—if only the \"mark of the Anunnaki\" could be implanted upon it. He was talking of the Apemen and Apewomen, who had evolved on Earth—b ut were still far behind the evolutionary level attained by the inhab itants of the Twelfth Planet. After much deliberation, Ea was given the g o-ahead: \"Create a Lulu,\" a \"primitive worker,\" he was told; \"let him bear the yoke of the Anunnaki.\" Ninhursag, the chief medical officer, was to assist him. There was much trial and error until the right procedure was perfe cted. Extracting the egg of Apewoman, Ea and Ninhursag fertilized it with the s perm of a young astronaut. Then they reimplanted the fertilized egg not in the womb of the Apewoman, but in the womb of a female astronaut. Fi nally, the \"Perfect Model\" was achieved, and Ninhursag shouted with joy . \"I have created— my hands have made it!\" She held up for all to see the first Homo sapiens (Fig. 53)—the Earth's first-ever test-tube baby. But like any hybrid, the Earthling could not procre ate on his own. To obtain more primitive workers, Apewomen eggs were e xtracted, fertilized, and reimplanted in the wombs of \"birth goddesses\"—f ourteen at a time: seven to be born males, seven females. As the Earth lings began to take over mining work in southeastern Africa, the Anunnaki wh o toiled in Meso- potamia grew jealous: they too clamored for primiti ve workers. Over the objections of Ea, forcibly, Enlil seized some of th e Earthlings and brought them to the E.DIN—the \"Abode Of The Righteous Ones\" in Mesopotamia. The event is recalled in the Bible. \"And the Lord t ook the Adam, and He placed him in the garden in Eden, to till it and te nd it.\""},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":" Fig, 53 All along, the astronauts who had come to Earth wer e preoccupied with the problem of longevity. Their biological clocks were set for their own planet: the time it took their planet to orbit the Sun once was to them but a single year of their life spans. But in such a single year , Earth orbited the Sun 3,600 times—a span of 3,600 years for Earth-origina ted life. To maintain their longer cycles on the quick-paced Earth, the a stronauts consumed a \"Food of Life\" and \"Water of Life\" which were provi ded from the home planet. At his biological laboratories in Eridu, wh ose emblem was the sign of the Entwined Serpents (Fig. 54), Ea tried to unr avel the secrets of life, reproduction, death. Why did the children born to t he astronauts on Earth age so much faster than their parents? Why did Apem en live such short lives? Why did the hybrid Homo sapiens live much lo nger than Apeman, but only brief lives compared to the visitors to Ea rth? Was it environment, or inherent genetic traits? Conducting further experiments in genetic manipulat ion on the hybrids, and using his own sperm, Ea came up with a new \"per fect model\" of Earthling. Adapa, as Ea had named him, had greater intelligence; he acquired the all-important ability to procreate, bu t not the longevity of the astronauts; Fig. 54 In the Days Before the Deluge 103"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"104 The Stairway to Heaven With wide understanding he had perfected him . . .

Thus were Adam and Eve of the Book of Genesis given the gift or fruit not only of Knowledge but also of Knowing—the bibli cal Hebrew term for intercourse for the purpose of having offspring. We find this \"biblical\" tale illustrated in an archaic Sumerian drawing (Fig. 55 ). Enlil was outraged on discovering what Ea had done. It was never intended that Man should be able to procreate like the gods. What next, he asked—would Ea also achieve for Man an everlasting life span? On the home planet, Anu too was perturbed. \"Rising from hi s throne, he ordered: 'Let them fetch Adapa hither!'\" Afraid that his perfected human would be destroyed at the Celestial Abode, Ea instructed him to avoid the food and wate r that would be offered to him, for they would contain poison; \"He gave him this advice: Adapa, Thou art going before Anu, the Ruler. The road to Heaven wilt thou take. When to Heaven thou hast gone up, and hast approached the gate of Anu, Tammuz and Gizzida at the gate will be standing . . . They will speak to Anu; Anus benign face they will cause to be shown thee. As thou standest before Anu, When they offer thee the Bread of Death, thou shalt not eat it.

The decision was to keep Adapa permanently on Mardu k. So that he could survive, \"the Bread of Life they brought him, \" and the Water of Life too. But forewarned by Ea, Adapa refused to eat or drink. When his erroneous reasons were discovered, it was too late; his chance to obtain everlasting life was missed. Adapa was returned to Earth—a trip during which Ada pa saw the \"awesomeness\" of space, \"from the horizon of Heaven to the zenith of Heaven.\" He was ordained as the High Priest of Erid u; he was promised by Anu that henceforth the Goddess of Healing would al so attend to the ailments of Mankind. But Mortal's ultimate goal—eve rlasting life—was no longer his. From then on, Mankind proliferated. The humans were no longer just slaves in the mines or serfs in the fields. They pe rformed all tasks, built \"houses\" for the gods—we call them \"temples\"—and qu ickly learned how to cook, dance and play music for them. It was not long before the young Anunnaki, short of female company of their own, too k to having sex with the daughters of Man. Since they were all of the sa me first Seed of Life, and Man was a hybrid created with the genetic \"essence\" of the Anunnaki, the male astronauts and the female Earthlings discovere d that they were biologically compatible; \"and children were born un to them.\" Enlil viewed these developments with rising apprehe nsion. The original purpose of coming to Earth, the sense of mission, t he dedication to the task—were dissipated and gone. The good life seemed to be the main concern of the Anunnaki—and with a race of hybrids to boot! Nature, as it were, offered Enlil a chance to put a halt to the deteriorating mores and ethics of the Anunnaki. Earth was enterin g a new ice age, and the pleasant climate was changing. As it got colder , it also became dryer. Rains became less frequent, the river waters sparse r. Crops failed, famine spread. Mankind began to undergo great sufferings; daughters hid food from their mothers, mothers ate their young. At the urging of Enlil, the gods refrained from helping Mankind: Let them starv e, let them be decimated, Enlil decreed. In the \"Great Below\"—in Antarctica—the Ice Age was also causing changes. From year to year, the ice cap covering th e continent at the South Pole grew thicker and thicker. Under the increasing pressure of its weight, friction and heat increased at its bottom. Soon the immense ice cap was floating on a slippery slush of mud. From the orbit ing shuttlecraft, an alarm was sounded: the ice cap was becoming unstable; if it should happen to slip off the continent into the ocean—an immense tidal w ave would engulf all of Earth!"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"106 The Stairway to Heaven It was not an idle danger. In the heavens, the Twel fth Planet was orbiting back to the Place of Crossing between Jupiter and M ars. As on previous occasions when it neared Earth, its gravitational p ull caused earthquakes and other disturbances upon Earth and in its celest ial motions. Now, it was calculated, this gravitational pull could well trig ger the slippage of the ice cap, and inundate Earth with a global deluge. From this catastrophe, the astronauts themselves could not be immune. As preparations were made to assemble all the Anunn aki near the Spaceport, and ready the craft to take them aloft b efore the tidal wave struck, ruses were employed to keep the approaching catastrophe a secret from Mankind. Fearing that the Spaceport would be m obbed, all the gods were made to swear to secrecy. And as to Mankind, E nlil said—Let them perish; let the seed of Earthling be wiped off the face of Earth. In Shuruppak, the city under the lordship of Ninhur sag, relations between Man and gods had gone the farthest. There, for the first time ever, a man was elevated to the status of king. As the su fferings of Mankind increased, ZI.U.SUD.RA (as the Sumerians called him ) pleaded for the help of Ea. From time to time, Ea and his seafarers clandestinely brought Ziusudra and his people a load of fish. But now the question involved the very destiny of Mankind. Shall all the handiwork of Ea and Ninhursag perish \"and turn to clay\" as Enlil wished—or should the Seed of Mankind be preserved? Acting on his own, but mindful of his oath, Ea saw in Ziusudra the chance to save Mankind. The next time Ziusudra came to pra y and plead in the temple, Ea began to whisper from behind a screen. P retending to talk to himself, Ea gave Ziusudra urgent instructions: Tear down the house, build a ship! Give up possessions, seek thou life! Foreswear belongings, keep soul alive! Aboard ship take thou the seed of all living things . That ship thou shalt build; Her dimensions shall be to measure. The ship was to be a submersible vessel, a \"submari ne\" that could withstand the avalanche of water. The Sumerian text s contain the dimen- sions and other structural instructions for the var ious decks and compart- ments in such detail that it is possible to draw th e ship, as was done by Paul Haupt (Fig. 56). Ea also provided Ziusudra with a n avigator, instructing him to direct the vessel toward the \"Mount of Salva tion,\" Mount Ararat; as the highest range in the Near East, its peaks would be the first to emerge from under the waters. The Deluge came as expected. \"Gathering speed as it blew\" from the south, \"submerging the mountains, overtaking the pe ople like a battle.\" Viewing the catastrophe from above, as they orbited Earth in their craft, the Anunnaki and their leaders realized how much th ey had fallen in love"},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":" Fig. 56 with Earth and with Mankind. \"Ninhursag wept . . . the gods wept with her for the land. . . . The Anunnaki, all humbled, sit and weep\" as they huddled, cold and hungry, in their Shuttlecraft. When the waters subsided and the Anunnaki began to land on Ararat, they were elated to discover that the Seed of Manki nd was saved. But as Enlil too arrived, he was furious to see that \"a li ving soul had escaped.\" It took the pleadings of the Anunnaki and the persuasi on of Ea, to bring him around to their point of view—that if Earth was to be resettled, the services of Man were indispensable. And so it was, that the sons of Ziusudra and their families were sent out to settle the mountain ranges flanking the plain of th e two rivers, to await the time when the plain was dry enough to inhabit. As t o Ziusudra, the Anunnaki Life like that of a god they gave him; Breath eternal, like a god, they granted him. This they achieved by exchanging his \"Breath of Ear th\" with the \"Breath of Heaven.\" Then they took Ziusudra, \"the preserver of the seed of Mankind,\" and his wife, to \"reside in the faraway p lace\"— In the Land of the Crossing, The Land Tilmun, The place where Utu rises, They caused him to dwell. It is evident by now that the Sumerian tales of the Gods of Heaven and Earth, of the Creation of Man and of the Deluge, we re the fountainhead from which the other nations of the ancient Near Ea st drew their knowledge, beliefs and \"myths.\" We have seen how th e Egyptian beliefs matched the Sumerian ones, how their first sacred c ity was named after An, how the Ben-Ben resembled the Sumerian GIR, and so on. In the Days Before the Deluge 107"},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"108 The Stairway to Heaven It is also generally accepted by now, that the bibl ical tales of the Creation and of the events leading to the Deluge are condens ed Hebrew versions of the Sumerian traditions. The biblical hero of the D eluge, Noah, was the equivalent of the Sumerian Ziusudra (who was called Utnapishtim in the Akkadian versions). But while the Sumerians asserte d that the hero of the Deluge was made immortal, no such claim is made in the Bible for Noah. The immortalization of Enoch is also given short sh rift, quite unlike the detailed Sumerian tale of Adapa or other texts deal ing with other Ascents. But this abrupt biblical attitude could not prevent the spread, over the millennia, of legends dealing with the biblical her oes and their sojourn in, or return to, Paradise. According to very ancient legends, which survived i n a number of versions stemming from a composition almost 2,000 y ears old called The Book of Adam and Eve, Adam fell sick after he was 9 30 years old. Seeing his father \"sick and in pain,\" his son Seth volunteered to go to \"the nearest gate of Paradise . . . and lament and make entreaty to G od; perchance He will hearken to me and send His angel to bring me the fr uit, for which thou hast longed\"—the fruit of the Tree of Life. But Adam, accepting his mortal's fate, only wished for the excruciating pains to be relieved. So he asked Eve his wife to t ake Seth, and together go \"to the neighborhood of Paradise\"; there to ask not for the Fruit of Life, but only for one drop of the \"oil of life\" which flowet h from the Tree, \"to anoint me with it, that I may have rest from these pains.\" Having done as Adam asked, Eve and Seth reached the gates of Paradise, and entreated with the Lord. Finally, the angel Mic hael appeared unto them—only to announce that their request would not be granted. \"The time of Adam's life is fulfilled,\" the angel said; his death was not to be averted or postponed. Six days later, Adam died. Even the historians of Alexander created a direct l ink between his miraculous adventures and Adam, the very first man who had dwelt in Paradise, and was proof of its existence and lifegi ving powers. The connecting link in the case of Alexander was the un ique stone which emitted light: it was said to have been brought out of the Garden of Eden by Adam, then handed down from generation to genera tion, until it reached the hands of an immortal Pharaoh, who in tu rn gave it to Alexander. The plot-of-parallels indeed thickens, as one reali zes that there exists an old Jewish legend, whereby the staff with which Mos es performed many miracles, including the parting of the waters of th e Lake of Reeds, was brought out of the Garden of Eden by Adam. Adam gav e it to Enoch; Enoch gave it to his great-grandson Noah, the hero of the Deluge. Then it was handed down through the line of Shem, son of No ah, from generation to generation, until it reached Abraham (the first Hebrew patriarch). Abraham's great-grandson Joseph brought it with him to Egypt, where he rose to highest rank in the Pharaoh's court. There the staff remained among"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"In the Days Before the Deluge 109 the treasures of the Egyptian kings; and thus it re ached the hands of Moses, who was raised as an Egyptian prince before he esca ped into the Sinai peninsula. In one version, the staff was carved out of a single stone; in another, it was made of a branch of the Tree of Lif e, which grew in the Garden of Eden. In these interwoven relationships, harkening back t o the earliest times, there were also tales linking Moses with Enoch, A J ewish legend, called \"The Ascent of Moses,\" relates that when the Lord s ummoned Moses at Mount Sinai and charged him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, Moses resisted the mission for various reasons, including his slow and non- eloquent speech. Determined to remove his meekness, the Lord decided to show him His throne and \"the angels of the Heave ns\" and the mysteries thereof. So \"God commanded Metatron, the Angel of t he Countenance, to conduct Moses to the celestial regions.\" Terrified, Moses asked Metatron: \"Who art thou?\" And the angel (literally: \"emissary \") of the Lord replied: \"I am Enoch, son of Jared, thy ancestor.\" (Accompanied by the angelic Enoch, Moses soared through the Seven Heavens, and saw Hel l and Paradise; then he was returned to Mount Sinai, and accepted his mi ssion.) Further light on the occurrences concerning Enoch, and his preoccupa- tion with the impending Deluge and its hero, his gr eat-grandson Noah, is shed by yet another ancient book, the Book of Jubil ees. It was also known in early times as the Apocalypse of Moses, for it alle gedly was written down by Moses at Mount Sinai as an angel dictated to him th e histories of days past. (Scholars, though, believe that the work was compos ed in the second century B.C.) It follows closely the biblical narratives of the B ook of Genesis; yet it provides more detail, such as the names of wives an d daughters of the pre- Diluvial patriarchs. It also enlarges upon the even ts experienced by Mankind in those prehistoric days. The Bible inform s us that the father of Enoch was Jared (\"Descent\"), but not why he was so named. The Book of Jubilees provides the missing information. It says that the parents of Jared so named him, For in his days the angels of the Lord descended up on Earth—those who are named The Watchers—that they should instruct th e children of men, that they should do judgment and uprightness upon E arth. Dividing the eras into \"jubilees,\" the Book of Jubi lees further narrates that \"in the eleventh jubilee Jared took to himself a wife; her name was Baraka (\"Lightning Bright\"), the daughter of Basuja l, a daughter of his father's brother . . . and she bare him a son and h e called his name Enoch. And he (Enoch) was the first among men that are bor n on Earth who learnt writing and knowledge and wisdom, and who wrote dow n the signs of heaven according to the order of their months in a book, that men might"},{"pageNumber":111,"pageContent":"110 The Stairway to Heaven know the seasons of the year according to the order of their separate months.'' In the twelfth juhilee. Enoch took as wife Edni (\"M y Eden\"), the daughter of Dan-el. She bare him a son whose name w as Methuselah. After that. Enoch \"was with the angels of God for six jub ilees of years, and they showed him everything which is on Earth and in the Heavens . . . and he wrote down everything.\" But by then, trouble was brewing. The Book of Genes is reports that it was before the Deluge, \"That the sons of the gods s aw the daughters of Man, that they were good, and they took them for wi ves of all which they chose . . . and it repented the Lord that He had ma de Man on Earth . . . and the Lord said: I will destroy the Man whom I ha d created from the face of the Earth.\" According to the Book of Jubilees, Enoch played som e role in this changed attitude by the Lord, for \"he testified abo ut the Watchers who had sinned with the daughters of men; he testified agai nst them all.\" And it was to protect him from the revenge of the sinning Ange ls of the Lord, that \"he was taken from amongst the children of men, and was conducted into the Garden of Eden.\" Specifically named as one of the f our places of God on Earth, it was in the Garden of Eden that Enoch was hidden, and where he wrote down his Testament. It was after that that Noah, the righteous man sing led out to survive the Deluge, was born. His birth, occurring at the troub led times when the \"sons of the gods\" were indulging in sex with morta l females, caused a marital crisis in the patriarchal family. As the Bo ok of Enoch tells it, Methuselah \"took a wife for his son Lamech, and she became pregnant by him and bore a son.\" But when the baby—Noah—was bor n, things were not as usual: His body was white as snow and red as the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his long locks were white as w ool, and his eyes were beautiful. And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whol e house like the sun, and the whole house was very bright. And thereupon he arose in the hands of the midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of Righteousness . Shocked, Lamech ran to his father Methuselah, and s aid: I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unl ike Man, and resembling the sons of the God of Heaven; and his n ature is different, and he is not like us . . . And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me bu t from the angels.

Making some inquiries, Enoch assured Methuselah that Noah was i ndeed a true son of Lamech; and that his unusual countenance was a sign of things to come: \"There shall be a Deluge and great destruction for one year,\" and only this son, who is to be named Noah (\"Respite\") and his fa mily shall be saved. These future things, Enoch told his son, \"I have re ad in the heavenly tablets.\" The term employed in these ancient, even if ex-bibl ical scriptures, to denote the \"sons of the gods\" involved in the pre-D iluvial shenanigans, is \"Watchers.\" It is the very term Neter (\"Watchers\") by which the Egyptians called the gods, and the exact meaning of the name Shumer, their landing place on Earth. The various ancient books which throw this extra li ght on the dramatic events in the days before the Deluge, have been pre served in several versions that are all only translations (direct and indirect) of lost Hebrew originals. Yet their authenticity was confirmed wit h the renowned discov- eries in recent decades of the Dead Sea Scrolls, fo r among the finds were fragments of scrolls which were undoubtedly parts o f the Hebrew originals of such \"memoirs of the Patriarchs.\" Of particular interest to us is a scroll fragment w hich deals with the unusual birth of Noah, and from which we can learn the original Hebrew term for what has been translated as \"Watchers\" or \"Giants,\" not only in the ancient versions, but even by modern scholars (as T . H. Gaster, The Dead Sea Scriptures and H. Dupont-Sommer, The Essene Wri tings from Qumran). According to these scholars, column II of the scroll fragment begins thus: Behold, I thought in my heart that the conception w as from one of the Watchers, one of the Holy Ones, and (that the child really belonged) to the Giants. And my heart was changed within me because of the c hild. Then I, Lamech, hastened and went to Bath-Enosh (my ) wife, and I said to Her: [I want you to take an oath] by the Most High, by t he Lord Supreme, the King of all the worlds, the ruler of the Sons of Heaven, that you will tell me in truth whether . . ."},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"112 The Stairway to Heaven But as we examine the Hebrew original (Fig. 57) we find that it does not say \"Watchers\"; it says Nefilim—the very term used in Genesis 6.

This places the Deluge at about 13,000 years ago. It is exactly the time when the last ice age ended abruptly, when agriculture began . It was followed 3,600 years later by the New Stone Age (as scholars call it), the age of pottery. Then, 3,600 years later, Civilization all at once b lossomed out—in the \"plain between the rivers,\" in Shumer. \"And the whole Earth was of one language and of one kind of things,\" the Book of Genesis says; but soon after the people had established themselves in the Land of Shin'ar (Sumer), and built dwellings of fired clay bricks, they conspired to \"build a city, and a Tower the top of which can reach unto Heaven.\" The Sumerian texts from which this biblical tale wa s extracted have not yet been found; but we do come across allusions to the event in various Sumerian tales. What emerges is an apparent effort on the part of Ea to enlist Mankind in gaining control over the space fa cilities of the Nefilim— one more incident in the continuing feud between Ea and Enlil, which by then had spilled over to their offspring. As a resu lt of the incident, the Bible tells us, the Lord and his unnamed colleagues decid ed to disperse Mankind and \"confuse\" its languages—give it diverse and sep arate civilizations.

The decision to establish on Earth four Regions was thus coupled with a decision to install intermediaries (priest-kings) b etween the gods and Mankind; so \"kingship was again lowered to Earth fr om Heaven.\" In an effort—which proved futile—to end or abate th e feud between the Enlil and Ea families, lots were drawn between the gods to determine who would have dominion over which of the Regions. As a result, Asia and Europe were assigned to Enlil and his offspring; to Ea, Africa was given. The First Region of civilization was Mesopotamia an d the lands bordering upon it. The mountain-lands where agriculture and s ettled life began, the lands that came to be known as Elam, Persia, Assyri a—were given to Enlil's son NIN.UR.TA, his rightful heir and \"Foremost Warr ior.\" Some Sumerian texts have been found dealing with Ninurta's heroic efforts to dam the mountain passes and assure the survival of his huma n subjects in the harsh times that had followed the Deluge. When the layers of mud that had covered the Plain b etween the Two Rivers dried up sufficiently to permit resettlement , Shumer and the lands that stretched therefrom westward to the Mediterran ean were put under the charge of Enlil's son NAN.NAR (Sin in Akkadian) . A benevolent god, he supervised the reconstruction of Sumer, rebuilding pre-Diluvial cities at their original sites and establishing new cities. A mong the latter was his favorite capital Ur, the birthplace of Abraham. His depictions included the crescent symbol of the Moon, which was his celestia l \"counterpart\" (Fig. 58). To Enlil's youngest son, ISH.KUR (whom the Akk adians called Adad), were given the northwestern lands, Asia Minor and t he Mediterranean islands from where civilization—\"Kingship\"—eventual ly spread to Greece. Like Zeus in later Greece, Adad was depicted riding a bull and holding a forked lightning. Ea too divided the Second Region, Africa, among his sons. It is known that a son named NER.GAL lorded over the southernmo st parts of Africa. A son named GI.BIL learned from his father the arts o f mining and metallurgy, and took over control of the African go ld mines. A third son— Ea's favorite—was named by him after the home plane t MARDUK, and was taught by Ea all knowledge of sciences and astronom y.

Because the script of the Indus Civilization is sti ll undeciphered, no one knows what the Harappans called their goddess, or w ho exactly she was. It is our conclusion, however, that she was the daught er of Sin, whom the Sumerians called IR.NI.NI (\"The Strong, Sweetsmelli ng Lady\") and the Akkadians called Ishtar. Sumerian texts tell of her dominion in a far land named Aratta—a land of grain crops and granaries as Harappa was— whereto she made flying trips, attired as a pilot. It was in need of a Spaceport that the Fourth Regio n was set aside by the Great Anunnaki—a Region not for Mankind, but for th eir own exclusive use. All their space facilities from the time they had landed on Earth—the Spaceport at Sippar, the Mission Control Center at Mippur—were wiped out by the Deluge. The low-lying Mesopotamian plain was still too muddy for millennia to enable the rebuilding there of the se vital installations. Another place —more elevated yet suitable, secluded but accessible —had to be found for the Spaceport and its auxiliary ins tallations. It was to be a \"sacred zone\"—a restricted area, accessible only by permission. It was called in Sumerian TIL.MUN—literally, \"Land of the Missiles.\" In charge of this post-Diluvial Spaceport they put the son of Sin (and thus a grandson of Enlil), a twin brother of Irnini/Isht ar. His name was UTU (\"The Bright One\")—Shamash in Akkadian. It was he w ho ably carried out Operation Deluge—the evacuation out of Sippar. He w as the chief of the Spacemen based on Earth, the \"Eagles\"; and he proud ly wore his Eagle- uniform on formal occasions (Fig. 59). In the days before the Deluge, traditions held, a f ew chosen mortals had been taken aloft from the Spaceport: Adapa, who mis sed his chance; and Enmeduranki, whom the gods Shamash and Adad transpo rted to the Celestial Abode, to be initiated in priestly secret s (and then returned to Earth). Then there was Ziusudra (\"His Life-Days Pro longed\"), hero of the Deluge, who was taken with his wife to live in Tilm un. In post-Diluvial times, Sumerian records stated, Et ana—an early ruler of Kish—was taken aloft in a Shem to the Abode of the Gods, there to be granted the Plant of Rejuvenation and Birthgiving ( but he was too frightened to complete the journey). And the Pharao h Thothmes III claimed in his inscriptions that the god Ra had tak en him aloft, given him a tour of the heavens, and returned him to Earth: He opened for me the doors of Heaven, He spread open for me the portals of its horizon.

They said of him that Secret things he has seen; What is hidden from Man, he found out. He even brought tidings of the time before the Deluge; He also took the distant journey, wearisome and under difficulties. He returned, and upon a stone column all his toil he engraved. Of that olden Sumerian tale, less than two hundred lines have remained. Yet we know it from its translations into the langu ages of the peoples who followed the Sumerians in the Near East; Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Hurrians. They all told and retold the tale; and th e clay tablets on which these later versions were written down—some intact, some damaged, many fragmented beyond legibility—have enabled many scho lars over the better part of a century to piece the tale together. At the core of our knowledge are twelve tablets in the Akkadian language; they were part of the library of Ashurbanipal in Ni neveh. They were first reported by George Smith, whose job at the British Museum in London was to sort out, match and categorize the tens of t housands of tablets and tablet fragments that arrived at the Museum from Me sopotamia. One day, his eye caught a fragmented text which appeared to relate the story of the Deluge. There was no mistaking: the cuneiform texts , from Assyria, were telling of a king who sought out the hero of the De luge, and heard from him a first-person account of the event! With understandable excitement, the Museum director s sent George Smith to the archaeological site to search for miss ing fragments.

In 1876, he conclusively s howed that this was, as his work was titled. The Chaldean Account of the Fl ood. From the language and style he concluded that it \"was composed in Bab ylon circa 2000 B.C.\" George Smith at first read the name of the king who searched for Noah Izdubur, and suggested that he was none other than the biblical hero-king Nimrod. For a time scholars believed that the tale indeed concerned the very first mighty king, and referred to the twelve- tablet text as the \"Nimrod Epos.\" More finds and much further research establi shed the Sumerian origin of the tale, and the true reading of the her o's name: GIL.GA.MESH. It has been confirmed from other historical texts—i ncluding the Sumerian King Lists—that he was a ruler of Uruk, the biblica l Erech, circa 2900 B.C. The Epic of Gilgamesh, as this ancient literary wor k is now called, thus takes us back nearly 5,000 years. One must understand the history of Uruk to grasp th e Epic's dramatic scope. Affirming the biblical statements, the Sumer ian historical records also reported that in the aftermath of the Deluge, kingship—royal dynasties—indeed began at Kish; it then was transfe rred to Uruk as a result of the ambitions of Irnini/Ishtar, who cherished no t at all her domain far away from Sumer. Uruk, initially, was only the location of a sacred precinct, where an Abode (temple) for An, the \"Lord of Heaven,\" was pe rched atop a vast ziggurat named E.AN.NA (\"House of An\"). On the rare occasion of An's visits to Earth, he took a liking to Irnini. He bes towed on her the title IN.AN.NA—\"Beloved of An\" (the ancient gossip sugges ted that she was beloved in more than platonic ways), and installed her in the Eanna, which otherwise stood unoccupied. But what good was a city without people, a lordship with no one to rule over? Not too far away to the south, on the shores of the Persian Gulf, Ea lived in Eridu in semi-isolation. There he kept tra ck of human affairs, dispensing knowledge and civilization to mankind. E nchanting and per- fumed, Inanna paid Ea (a great-uncle of hers) a vis it. Enamored and drunk. Ea granted her wish: to make Uruk the new center of Sumerian civilization, the seat of kingship in lieu of Kish. To carry out her grandiose plans, whose ultimate go al was to break into the Inner Circle of the Twelve Great Gods, Inanna-I shtar enlisted the support of her brother Utu/Shamash. Whereas in the days before the Deluge the intermarriage between the Nefilim and th e daughters of Man brought about the wrath of the gods, the practice w as no longer frowned upon in the aftermath of the Deluge. And so it was, that the high priest at the temple of An was at the time a son of Shamash b y a human female. Ishtar and Shamash anointed him as king of Uruk, st arting the world's first dynasty of priestly kings. According to the Sumeria n King Lists, he ruled for 324 years. His son, \"who built Uruk,\" ruled for 420 years.

An offspring of the great god Shamash on his father 's side, Gilgamesh was considered to be \"two-thirds god, one-third human\" by the further fact that his mother was the goddess NIN.SUN (Fig. 62). He wa s thus accorded the privilege of having his name written with the prefi x \"divine.\" Proud and self-assured, Gilgamesh began as a benevo lent and con- scientious king, engaged in the customary tasks of raising the city's ramparts or embellishing the temple precinct. But the more k nowledge he acquired of the histories of gods and men, the more he becam e philosophical and restless. In the midst of merriment, his thoughts t urned to death. Would he, by virtue of his divine two-thirds, live as lon g as his demi-god forefathers—or would his one-third prevail, and det ermine for him the life span of a mortal human?

Therefore, said Shamash, Let full be thy belly, Gilgamesh; Make thou merry by day and night! Of each day, make thou a feast of rejoicing; Day and night, dance thou and play! Let thy garments be sparkling fresh, thy head washed; bathe thou in water. Pay heed to the little one that holds thy hand, let thy spouse delight in thy bosom; for this is the fate of Mankind. But Gilgamesh refused to accept this fate. Was he n ot two-thirds divine, and only one-third human? Why then should the lesse r mortal part, rather than his greater godly element, determine his fate? Roving by daytime, restless at night, Gilgamesh sought to stay young b y intruding on newlywed couples and insisting on having intercourse with th e bride ahead of the bridegroom. Then, one night, he saw a vision which he felt was an omen. He rushed to his mother to tell her what he saw, so that she might interpret the omen for him: My mother, During the night, having become lusty, I wandered about. In the midst (of night) omens appeared. A star grew larger and larger in the sky. The handiwork of Anu descended towards me! \"The handiwork of Anu\" that descended from the skie s fell to Earth near him, Gilgamesh continued to relate: I sought to lift it; it was too heavy for me.

The ancient reader, appar ently, required no elaboration, having been familiar with the term (\"H andiwork of Anu\") or with its depiction, as possibly the one shown on an ancient cylinder seal (Fig. 63). The Gilgamesh text describes the lower part, which was grabbed by the heroes, by a term that may be translated \"legs.\" It had, however, other pronounced parts and could even be entered, as beco mes clear from the further description by Gilgamesh of the night's eve nts: I pressed strongly its upper part; I could neither remove its covering, nor raise its Ascender . . . With a destroying fire its top 1 (then) broke off, and moved into its depths. Its movable That Which Pulls Forward I lifted, and brought it to thee. Gilgamesh was certain that the appearance of the ob ject was an omen from the gods concerning his fate. But his mother, the goddess Ninsun, had to disappoint him. That which descended like a star from Heaven, she said, foretells the arrival of \"a stout comrade who rescu es; a friend is come to thee . . . he is the mightiest in the land . . . he w ill never forsake thee. This is the meaning of thy vision.\" She knew what she was talking about; for unbeknown to Gilgamesh, in response to pleas from the people of Uruk that some thing be done to divert the restless Gilgamesh, the gods arranged for a wil d man to come to Uruk and engage Gilgamesh in wrestling matches. He was c alled ENKI.DU—\"A Creature of Enki\"—a kind of Stone Age Man who had b een living in the wilderness among the animals and as one of them: \"T he milk of wild creatures he was wont to suck.\" He was depicted nak ed, bearded, with shaggy hair—often shown in the company of his anima l friends (Fig. 64). To tame him, the nobles of Uruk assigned a harlot. Enkidu, until then knowing only the company of animals, regained his h uman element as he made love to the woman, over and over again.

Only the gods, by going to the underground place of Shamash. Mankind's days are numbered; whatever they achieve is but the wind. Even thou art afraid of death, in spite of your heroic might. Therefore, Let me go ahead of thee, let thy mouth call to me: \"Advance, fear not!\" This, then, was the plan: by going to \"the undergro und place of Shamash\" in the Cedar Mountain, to be enabled to \"s cale heaven\" as the gods do.

But one which only encouraged Gilgamesh to proceed, for it confirmed that he in fact had reached the \"Landing Place.\" In the morning the comrades attempted to penetrate the forest, careful to avoid \"weapon-trees that kill.\" Enkidu found the ga te, of which he had spoken to Gilgamesh. But as he tried to open it, he was thrown back by an unseen force. For twelve days he lay paralyzed. When he was able to move and speak again, he pleade d with Gilgamesh: \"Let us not go down into the heart of the forest.\" But Gilgamesh had good news for his comrade: while the latter was recoveri ng from the shock, he— Gilgamesh—had found a tunnel. By the sounds heard f rom it, Gilgamesh was sure that it was connected to \"the enclosure fr om which words of command are issued.\" Come on, he urged Enkidu; \"do not stand by, my friend; let us go down together!\" Gilgamesh must have been right, for the Sumerian te xt states that Pressing on into the forest, the secret abode of the Anunnaki he opened up. The entrance to the tunnel was grown over with (or hidden by) trees and bushes and blocked by soil and rocks. \"While Gilgam esh cut down the trees, Enkidu dug up\" the soil and rocks. But just as they made enough of a clearance, terror struck: \"Huwawa heard the noise, and became angry.\" Now he appeared on the scene looking for the intrud ers. His appearance"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"128 The Stairway to Heaven was \"Mighty, his teeth as the teeth of a dragon; hi s face the face of a lion; his coming like the onrushing floodwaters.\" Most fearso me was his \"radiant beam.'' Emanating from his forehead, \"it devoured t rees and bushes.\" From its killing force, \"none could escape.\" A Sume rian cylinder seal depicted a god, Gilgamesh and Enkidu flanking a mec hanical robot, no doubt the epic's \"Monster with the Killing Beams\" ( Fig. 65). It appears from the fragmented texts that Huwawa co uld armor himself with \"seven cloaks,\" but when he arrived on the sce ne \"only one he had donned, six are still off.\" Seeing this as their op portunity, the two comrades attempted to ambush Huwawa. As the monster turned t o face his attackers, the Killing Beam from his forehead traced a path of destruction. In the nick of time, rescue appeared from the heave ns. Seeing their predicament, \"down from the skies spoke to them div ine Shamash.\" Do not try to escape, he advised them; instead, \"draw near Huwawa.\" Then Shamash raised a host of swirling winds, \"which bea t against the eyes of Huwawa\" and neutralized his beam. As Shamash had in tended, \"the radiant beams vanished, the brilliance became clouded.\" Soo n, Huwawa was immobilized: \"he is unable to move forward, nor is he able to move back.\" The two then attacked Huwawa: \"Enkidu struck the gu ardian, Huwawa, to the ground. For two leagues the cedars resounded,\" so immense was the monster's fall. Then Enkidu \"Huwawa put to death.\" Exhilarated by their victor)' but exhausted by the battle, the two stopped to rest by a stream. Gilgamesh undressed to wash hi mself. \"He cast off his soiled things, put on his clean ones; wrapped a fri nged cloak about him, fastened with a sash.\" There was no need to rush: t he way to the \"secret abode of the Anunnaki\" was no longer blocked. Little did he know that a female's lust would soon undo his victory. . . . The place, as stated earlier in the epic, was the \" Crossroads of Ishtar.\" The goddess herself was wont to come and go from th is \"Landing Place.\" She too, like Shamash, must have watched the battle —perhaps from her aerial (\"winged\") Sky Chamber, as depicted on a Hit tite seal (Fig. 66). Now, having seen Gilgamesh undress and bathe, \"glorious Ishtar raised an eye at the beauty of Gilgamesh.\" Approaching the hero, she minced no words about wha t was on her mind: Come, Gilgamesh, be thou my lover! Grant me the fruit of thy love. You be my man, I shall be your woman! Promising him golden chariots, a magnificent palace , lordship over other kings and princes, Ishtar was sure she had enticed Gilgamesh. But answering her, he pointed out that he had nothing h e could give her, a goddess, in return. And as to her \"love,\" how long would that last? Sooner or later, he said, she would rid herself of him as of \"a shoe which pinches"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":" Fig. 65 Fig. 66 the foot of its owner.\" Calling off the names of ot her men with whom she had been promiscuous, he turned her down. Enraged b y this insulting refusal, Ishtar asked Anu to let the \"Bull of Heave n\" smite Gilgamesh. Attacked by the Sky Monster, Gilgamesh and Enkidu f orgot all about their mission, and ran for their lives. Aiding thei r escape back to Uruk, Shamash enabled them \"the distance of a month and f ifteen days, in three days to traverse.\" But on the outskirst of Uruk, on the Euphrates River, the Bull of Heaven caught up with them. Gilgamesh manag ed to reach the city, to summon its warriors. Outside the city walls, Enk idu alone remained to hold off the Sky Monster. When the Bull of Heaven \" snorted,\" pits were opened in the earth, large enough to hold two hundr ed men each. As Enkidu fell into one of the pits, the Bull of Heave n turned around. Quickly Enkidu climbed out, and put the monster to death. What exactly the Bull of Heaven was, is not clear. The Sumerian term— GUD.AN.NA—could also mean \"Anu's attacker,\" his \"cr uise missile.\" Ancient artists, fascinated by the episode, frequen tly depicted Gilgamesh or Enkidu fighting with an actual bull, with the na ked Ishtar (and sometimes Adad) looking on (Fig. 67a). But from the Epic's text it is clear that this weapon of Anu was a mechanical contraptio n made of metal and equipped with two piercers (the \"horns\") which were \"cast from thirty minas of lapis, the coating on each being two finge rs thick.\" Some ancient depictions show such a mechanical \"bull,\" sweeping down from the skies (Fig. 67b).

Then, triumphant, he and Enkidu went to pay homage to Shamash. But \"Ishtar, in her abode, set up a wail.\" In the palace, Gilgamesh and Enkidu were resting fr om nightlong celebrations.

But Enlil said: 'Enkidu shall die, let Gilgam esh not die. \" Then Shamash interceded: it was done with his concurrenc e; why then should \"innocent Enkidu die?\" While the gods deliberated, Enkidu was afflicted wi th a coma. Distraught and worried, Gilgamesh \"paced back and forth before the couch\" on which Enkidu lay motionless. Bitter tears flowed down his cheeks. As sorry as he was for his comrade, his thoughts turned to his own permeating anxiety: will he too lie one day dying like Enkidu? Will he, after all the endeavors, end up dead as a mortal? In their assembly, the gods reached a compromise. T he death sentence of Enkidu was commuted to hard labor in the depths of the mines—there to spend the rest of his days. To carry out the senten ce and take him to his new home, Enkidu was told, two emissaries \"clothed like birds, with wings for garments\" shall appear unto him. One of them, \" a young man whose face is dark, who like a Bird-Man is his face,\" sha ll transport him to the Land of the Mines: He will be dressed like an Eagle; By the arm he will lead thee. \"Follow me,\" (he will say); he will lead you To the House of Darkness, the abode below the ground; The abode which none leave who have entered into it .

An ancient depiction on a cylinder seal illustrated the scene, showing a Winged Emissary (\"angel\") leading Enkidu by the arm (Fig. 68). Hearing the sentence passed on his comrade, Gilgame sh had an idea. Not far from the Land of Mines, he had learned, was the Land of the Living: the place whereto the gods had taken those humans w ho were granted eternal youth! It was \"the abode of the forefathers who by the gre at gods with the Purifying Waters were anointed.\" There, partaking o f the food and beverage of the gods, have been residing Princes born to the crown who had ruled the land in days of yore; Like Anu and Enlil, spiced meats they are served, From waterskins, cool water to them is poured.

The Land, it is in Utu's charge; The Land which with the cedars is aligned, it is the hero Utu's charge. Inform Utu! Thus forewarned and advised, Gilgamesh offered a sa crifice to Utu, and appealed for his consent and protection: O Utu, The Land I wish to enter; be thou my ally! The Land which with the cool cedars is aligned I wish to enter; be thou my ally! In the places where the Shems have been raised up, Let me set up my Shem! At first, Utu/Shamash doubted whether Gilgamesh cou ld qualify to enter the land. Then, yielding to more pleading and praye rs, he warned him that his journey would be through a desolate and arid ar ea: \"the dust of the crossroads shall be thy dwelling place, the desert shall be thy bed . . . thorn and bramble shall skin thy feet. . . thirst shall s mite thy cheeks.\" Unable to dissuade Gilgamesh, he told him that the \"place whe re the Shems have been raised\" is surrounded by seven mountains, and the passes guarded by fearsome \"Mighty Ones\" who can unleash \"a scorching fire\" or \"a lightning which cannot be turned back.\" But in the end, Utu g ave in: \"the tears of Gilgamesh he accepted as an offering; like one of m ercy, he showed him mercy.\" But \"the lord Gilgamesh acted frivolously.\" Rather than take the harsh overland road, he planned to cover most of the rout e by a comfortable sea voyage; after landing at the distant destination, E nkidu would go to the Land of Mines, and he (Gilgamesh) would proceed to the Land of the Living. He selected fifty young, unattached men to accompany him and Enkidu, and be rowers of the boat. Their first task was to cut and haul back to Uruk special woods, from which the MA.GAN boat—a \"ship of Egypt\"— was built. The smiths of Uruk fashioned strong weap ons. Then, when all was ready, they sailed away. They sailed, by all accounts, down the Persian Gulf , planning no doubt to circumnavigate the Arabian peninsula and then sail up the Red Sea toward Egypt.

How come, then, he was sailing with the j oyful Gilgamesh, with fifty armed men, in a royal ship? At dusk, Utu—who may have seen them off with great misgivings—\"with lifted head went away.\" The mountains along the dis tant coast \"became dark, shadows spread over them.\" Then, \"standing al ongside the moun- tain,\" there was someone who—like Huwawa—could emit rays \"from which none can escape.\" \"Like a bull he stood on the grea t Earth house\"—a watchtower, it seems. The fearsome watchman must ha ve challenged the ship and its passengers, for fear overcame Enkidu. Let us turn back to Uruk, he pleaded. But Gilgamesh would not hear of i t. Instead, he directed the ship toward the shore, determined to fight the watchman—\"that 'man,' if a man he be, or if a god he be.\" It was then that calamity struck. The \"three ply cl oth\"—the sail—tore apart. As if by an unseen hand, the boat capsized; and all in it sank down. Somehow, Gilgamesh managed to swim ashore; so did E nkidu. Back in the waters, they saw the sunken ship with its crew stil l at their posts, looking amazingly alive in their deaths: After it had sunk, in the sea had sunk, On the eve when the Magan-boat had sunk. After the boat, destined to Magan, had sunk— Inside it, as though still living creatures, were seated those who of a womb were born. They spent the night on the unknown shore, arguing which way to go. Gilgamesh was still determined to reach \"the land.\" Enkidu advised seeking a way back to \"the city,\" Uruk. Soon, howev er, weakness overcame Enkidu. With passionate comradeship, Gilgamesh exho rted Enkidu to hold on to life: \"My little weak friend,\" he fondly call ed him; \"to the land I will bring thee,\" he promised him. But \"Death, which kno ws no distinction,\" could not be held off. For seven days and seven nights Gilgamesh mourned E nkidu, \"until a worm fell out of his nose.\" At first he wandered ai mlessly: \"For his friend, Enkidu, Gilgamesh weeps bitterly as he ranges over the wilderness . . . with woe in his belly, fearing death, he roamed the wilderness.\" Again he was preoccupied with his own fate—\"fearing death\"—w ondering: \"When I die, shall I not be like Enkidu?\" Then his determination to ward off his fate took ho ld of him again. \"Must I lay my head inside the earth, and sleep through a ll the years?\" he demanded to know of Shamash. \"Let mine eyes behold the sun, let me have my fill of light!\" he begged of the god. Setting hi s course by the rising and setting Sun, \"To the Wild Cow, to Utnapishtim the s on of Ubar-Tutu, he took the road.\" He trod unbeaten paths, encounterin g no man, hunting for food. \"What mountains he had climbed, what streams he had crossed—no man can know,\" the ancient scribes sadly noted."},{"pageNumber":135,"pageContent":"134 The Stairway to Heaven At long last, as versions found at Nineveh and at H ittite sites relate, he neared habitations.

After Siduri let him rest, eat and drink, Gilgamesh was eager to continue. What is the best way to the Land of Living? he aske d Siduri. Must he circle the sea and wind his way through the desolate mount ains—or could he take a shortcut across the body of water? Now ale-woman, which is the way . . . What are its markers? Give me, O give me its markers! Suitably, by the sea I will go across; Otherwise, by the wilderness my course will be. The choice, it turned out, was not that simple; for the sea he saw was the \"Sea of Death\": The ale-woman said to him, to Gilgamesh: \"The sea, Gilgamesh, it is impossible to cross From days of long ago, no one arrived from across the sea. Valiant Shamash did cross the sea, but other than Shamash, who can cross it? Toilsome is the crossing, desolate is its way; Barren are the Waters of Death which it encloses How then, Gilgamesh, wouldst thou cross the sea? As Gilgamesh remained silent, Siduri spoke up again , revealing to him that there might be, after all, a way to cross the Sea of the Waters of Death: Gilgamesh, There is Urshanabi, boatman of Utnapishtim. With him are tilings that float, in the woods he picks the things that bind together . Go, let he thy face behold. If it be suitable, with thee he shall cross; If it be not suitable, draw thou back.

In three days, \"a run of a month and fifteen days\"—a forty-five day journey overland—\"th ey left behind.\" He arrived at TIL.MUN—\"The Land of the Living.\" Whereto shall he go now? Gilgamesh wondered. You ha ve to reach a mountain, Urshanabi answered; \"the name of the moun tain is Mashu.\" The instructions given by Urshanabi are available t o us from the Hittite version of the Epic, fragments of which were found in Boghazkoy and other Hittite sites. From those fragments (as put togethe r by Johannes Friedrich: Die hethitischen Bruchstukes des Gilgamesh-Epos), w e learn that Gilgamesh was told to reach and follow \"a regular w ay\" which leads toward \"the Great Sea, which is far away.\" He was to look for two stone columns or \"markers\" which, Urshanabi vouched, \"to the destina tion always bring me.\" There he had to turn and reach a town named It la, sacred to the god whom the Hittites called Ullu-Yah (\"He of the Peaks \"?). He had to obtain that god's blessing before he could go farther. Following the directions, Gilgamesh did arrive at I tla. In the distance, the Great Sea could apparently be seen. There, Gilg amesh ate and drank, washed and made himself once again presentable as b efits a king. There, Shamash once again came to his aid, advising him to make offerings to Ulluyah. Taking Gilgamesh before the Great God (Fig . 70), he urged Ulluyah: Accept his offerings, \"grant him life.\" Bu t Kumarbi, another god well known from Hittite tales, strongly objected: I mmortality cannot be granted to Gilgamesh, he said. Realizing, it appears, that he would not be granted a Shem, Gilgamesh settled for second-best: Could he, at least, meet h is forefather Utnapishtim? As the gods delayed their decision, Gilgamesh (with the connivance of Shamash?) left town and started to advance toward M ount Mashu, stopping each day to offer sacrifices to Ulluyah. After six days, he came unto the Mount; it was indeed the Place of the Shems: The name of the Mountain is Mashu.

There was a way to go inside the Mount; but the ent rance, the \"gate,\" was closely guarded: Rocket-men guard its gate. Their terror is awesome, their glance is death. Their dreaded spotlight sweeps the mountains. They watch over Shamash as he ascends and descends.

Allowed to approach, Gilgamesh was asked to identif y himself and account for his presence in the restricted area. De scribing his partly divine origins, he explained that he had come \"in search o f Life.\" He wished, he said, to meet his forefather Utnapishtim: On account of Utnapishtim, my forefather, have I come— He who the congregation of the gods had joined. About Death and Life I wish to ask him. \"Never was this achieved by a mortal,\" the two guar ds said. Undaunted, Gilgamesh invoked Shamash and explained that he was two-thirds god. What happened next is unknown, due to breaks in the tablet; but at last the Rocketmen informed Gilgamesh that permission was gr anted: \"The gate of the Mount is open to thee!\" (The \"Gateway to Heaven\" was a frequent motif on Ne ar Eastern cylinder seals, depicting it as a winged, ladder-li ke gateway leading to the Tree of Life. It was sometimes guarded by Serpents— Fig. 72). Gilgamesh went in, following the \"path taken by Sha mash.\" His journey lasted twelve beru (double-hours); through most of it \"he could see nothing ahead or behind\"; perhaps he was blindfolded, for t he text stresses that \"for him, light there was none.\" In the eighth double-ho ur, he screamed with fear; in the ninth, \"he felt a north wind fanning h is face.\" \"When eleven beru he attained, dawn was breaking.\" Finally, at t he end of the twelfth double-hour, \"in brightness he resided.\" He could see again, and what he saw was astounding.

In answer to this question, Utnapishtim said to Gil gamesh: \"I will reveal to thee, Gilgamesh, a hidden matter; a secret of th e gods I will tell thee.\" The secret was the Tale of the Deluge: How when he, Utnapishtim, was the Gilgamesh: The King Who Refused to Die 139"},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 The Stairway to Heaven ruler of Shuruppak and the gods resolved to let the Deluge annihilate Mankind, Enki secretly instructed him to build a sp ecial submersible vessel, and take aboard his family \"and the seed of all living things.\" A navigator provided by Enki directed the vessel to M ount Ararat. As the waters began to subside, he left the vessel to offe r sacrifices. The gods and goddesses—who circled Earth in their spacecraft whi le it was inundated— also landed on Mount Ararat, savoring the roasting meat. Finally, Enlil too landed, and broke into a rage when he realized that in spite of the oath taken by all the gods, Enki enabled Mankind to surv ive. But when his anger subsided, Enlil saw the merit of such survival; it was then, Utnapishtim continued to recount, that Enlil granted him everlasting life: Thereupon, Enlil went aboard the ship. Holding me by the hand, he took me aboard. He took my wife aboard, and made her kneel by my side. Standing between us, he touched our foreheads to bless us: \"Hitherto, Utnapishtim has been human; Henceforth, Utnapishtim and his wife like gods shall be unto us. Far away shall the man Utnapishtim reside, at the mouth of the water-streams.\" And so it came to pass, Utnapishtim concluded, that he was taken to the Faraway Abode, to live among the gods. But how coul d this be achieved for Gilgamesh? \"But now, who will for thy sake call the gods to Assembly, that the Life which thou seekest thou mayest find?\" On hearing the tale, and realizing that it is only the gods, in assembly, who can decree eternal life and that he, on his own , could not attain it— Gilgamesh fainted. For six days and seven nights he was totally knocked out. Sarcastically, Utnapishtim said to his wife: \" Behold this hero who seeks Life; from mere sleep as mist he dissolves!\" Throug hout his sleep, they attended to Gilgamesh, to keep him alive, \"that he may return safe on the way by which he came, that through the gate by whic h he entered he may return to his land.\" Urshanabi the boatman was called to take Gilgamesh back. But at the last moment, when Gilgamesh was ready to leave, Utnapish tim disclosed to Gilgamesh yet another secret. Though he could not a void death, he told him, there was a way to postpone it.

If thine hands obtain the plant, New Life thou wilt find.\" The plant, we learn from what followed, grew underw ater: No sooner had Gilgamesh heard this, than he opened the water-pipe. He tied heavy stones to his feet; They pulled him down into the deep; He saw then the plant. He took the plant, though it pricked his hands. He cut the heavy stones from his feet; The second cast him back where he came from. Going back with Urshanabi, Gilgamesh triumphantly s aid to him: Urshanabi, This plant is of all plants unique: By it a man can regain his full vigor!

The Gilgamesh drama reached its culmination in the Land of Tilmun, an Abode of the Gods and a place of the Shetns. It was there that he encountered an ancestor who had escaped mortality, and had found the secret plant of eternal youth. It was there that ot her divine encounters, as well as events affecting the course of human histor y, occurred in later millennia. It was there, we believe, that the Duat was —the Stairway to Heaven, But that was not the first destination of Gilgamesh , and we ought to follow in his footsteps in the same sequence by whi ch he himself had embarked on his journey: his first destination on t he road to Immortality was not Tilmun, but the \"Landing Place\" on the Ceda r Mountain, within the great Cedar Forest. Scholars (e.g. S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians) have te rmed as \"cryptic and still enigmatic\" Sumerian statements that Shamash c ould \"rise\" in the \"Cedar Land,\" and not only in Tilmun. The answer is that apart from the Spaceport at Tilmun, from which the farthest heaven s could be reached, there was also a \"Landing Place\" from which the god s \"could scale the 144"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"Riders of the Clouds 145 skies\" of Earth. This realization is supported by o ur conclusion, that the gods indeed had two types of craft: the GIRs, the R ocketships that were operated from Tilmun; and what the Sumerians called a MU, a \"Sky Chamber.\" It is a credit to the technology of the N efilim that the uppermost section of the GIR, the Command Module—what the Egy ptians called Ben- Ben—could be detached and fly in Earth's skies as a MU. The ancient peoples had seen the GIRs in their silo s (Fig. 27) or even in flight (Fig. 75). But they depicted more frequently the \"Sky Chambers\"— vehicles which we would nowadays classify as UFOs ( Unidentified Flying Objects). The one the patriarch Jacob had seen in h is vision might well have looked like the Sky Chamber of Ishtar (Fig. 66); th e Flying Wheel described by the prophet Ezekiel was akin to the As syrian depictions of their Flying God roaming the skies, at cloud level, within a spherical Sky Chamber (Fig. 76a). Depictions found at an ancient site across the Jordan from Jericho, suggest that for landing these spheri cal vehicles extended three legs (Fig. 76b); they could well have been th e fiery Whirlwinds in which the prophet Elijah was carried off heavenward s at that very same location.

Tilmun, then, was the location of the Spaceport. Th e Cedar Mountain was the location of the \"Landing Place,\" the \"Cross roads of Ishtar,\"—the Airport of the Gods. And it was to the latter that Gilgamesh had first set his course. While the identification of Tilmun and its location is no mean challenge, there is little problem in locating the Cedar Fores t. With the exception of subsidiary growths on the island of Cyprus, there i s only one such location throughout the Near East: the mountains of Lebanon. These majestic cedar trees, which can reach 150 feet in height, were rep eatedly extolled in the Bible and their uniqueness was known to the ancient peoples from the earliest times. As the biblical and other Near East ern texts attest, the Cedars of Lebanon were earmarked for the constructi on and decoration of temples (\"gods' houses\")—a practice described in de tail in I Kings, in the chapters dealing with the building of the Jerusalem Temple by Solomon (after the Lord Yahweh had complained \"Why build ye not me a House of cedar?\"). The biblical Lord appears to have been quite famili ar with the cedars, and frequently employed them in his allegories, com paring rulers or nations to cedars: \"Assyria was a cedar in Lebanon, with fair branches and a shadowing shroud and of high stature . . . waters n ourished it, subterra- nean streams gave it height\"—until the wrath of Yah weh toppled it and smashed its branches. Man, it appears, had never be en able to cultivate these cedars; and the Bible records an attempt that had completely failed. Attributing the attempt to the king of Babylon (fac tually or allegorically), it is stated that \"He came to Lebanon and took the ced ar's highest branch,\" selecting off it a choice seed. This seed \"he plant ed in a fruitful field, he placed it by great waters.\" But what grew up was no t a tall cedar—only a willow-like tree, \"a spreading vine of low stature. \" The biblical Lord, on the other hand, knew the secr et of cedar cultivation: Thus sayeth the Lord Yahweh: \"From the cedars crest, from its topmost branches a tender shoot I will take; and I will plant it upon a high and steep mou ntain . . . And it will put forth branches, and bear fruit, and become a mighty cedar.\" This knowledge apparently stemmed from the fact tha t the cedar grew in the \"Orchard of the gods.\" There, no other tree cou ld match it; \"it was the envy of all the trees that were in Eden, the garden of the gods.\" The Hebrew term Gan (orchard, garden), stemming as it d oes from the root gnn"},{"pageNumber":148,"pageContent":" Fig. 77 (protect, guard), conveys the sense of a guarded an d restricted area—the same sense as is imparted to the reader of the Gilg amesh narrative: a forest that extends \"for many leagues,\" watched over by a Fiery Warrior (\"a terror to mortals\"), accessible only through a gateway whi ch paralyzed the intruder who touched it. Inside, there was \"the sec ret abode of the Anunnaki\"; a tunnel led to \"the enclosure from whic h words of command are issued\"—\"the underground place of Shamash.\" Gilgamesh almost made it to the Landing Place, for he had the permission and help of Shamash. But the wrath of Is htar (when he turned down her advances) completely reversed the course o f events. Not so, according to the Old Testament, was the fate of ano ther mortal king.

As a result, \"a god I am,\" he said; \"in the Abode of the Deity I sat, i n the midst of the waters.\" For his haughtiness of heart, the prophet was to in form him, he was to die the death of a heathen by the hands of strangers. Both the Hebrews of biblical times, and their neigh bors to the north, were thus acquainted with the location and nature o f the Landing Place in the Cedar Mountain which Gilgamesh attempted to pen etrate in a previous millennium. It was, as we shall show, not a \"mythol ogical\" place, but a real one: not only texts, but also pictorial depictions exist from those ancient days, attesting to the existence and functions of t he place. In the tale of the king who tried to grow a cedar, the Old Testament reports that he \"carried off the twig to a land of commerce,\" and planted the seed \"in a city of merchants.\" Such a land and such cities-of-merchants need not have been looked-for far: along the coast of Le banon, from where Anatolia begins in the north to Palestine in the so uth, there were several Canaanite coastal cities whose wealth and power gre w with their interna- tional commerce. Best known from biblical narrative s were Tyre and Sidon; centers of trade and shipping for millennia, their fame reached its peak under their Phoenician rulers. In ruins and buried under a mount since its destruc tion by Assyrian invaders lay yet another city, perhaps the northern most outpost of the Canaanites at the borders of the Hittite empire. It s remains were accidentally uncovered in 1928 by a farmer who set out to plough a new field near the mount called Ras Shamra. The extensi ve excavations that followed uncovered the ancient city of Ugarit. The spectacular finds included a large palace, a temple to the god Ba'al (\"The Lord\"), and a variety of artifacts. But the real treasures were s cores of clay tablets inscribed in an alphabetic cuneiform script (Fig. 7 9), written in a \"Western- Semitic\" language akin to biblical Hebrew. The tabl ets, whose contents were first presented by Charles Virollaud over many years in the scientific periodical Syria, retrieved from relative obscurity the Canaanites, their life and customs, and their gods. At the head of the Canaanite pantheon was a supreme deity called El—a term which in biblical Hebrew was the generic term for \"deity,\" stemming as it did from the Akkadian word Ilu, which literal ly meant \"Lofty One.\" But in the Canaanite tales of gods and men, El was the personal name of an actual deity, who was the final authority in all af fairs be they divine or human. He was father of the gods, as well as Ab Ada m (\"father of men\"); his epithets were The Kindly, The Merciful. He was \"cre ator of things created\" and the \"one who alone could bestow kingship.\" A st ela found in Palestine (Fig. 80) depicts El seated on his throne and being served a beverage by a younger deity, probably one of his many sons.

In \"olden times,\" El was a principal deity of Heave n and Earth. But at the time at which the events related in the tablets had taken place, El lived in semi-retirement, aloof from daily affairs. His a bode was \"in the mountains,\" at \"the two headwaters.\" There he sat i n his pavilion, receiving emissaries, holding councils of the gods, and tryin g to resolve the recurring disputes among the younger gods. Many of these were his own children: some texts suggest that El may have had seventy off spring. Of them, thirty were by his official consort Asherah (Fig. 81); the others, by an assortment of concubines or even by human females. One poetic text tells how two females saw El naked as they were strolling on the beach; they were completely charmed by the size of his penis, and en ded up each bearing him a son. (This attribute of El is prominent in a depiction of him, as a winged god, on a Phoenician coin—Fig. 82). El's principal children, however, were three sons a nd one daughter: the gods Yam (\"Ocean, Sea\"), Ba'al (\"Lord\") and Mot (\"S miter, Annihilator\") and the goddess Anat (\"She Who Responded\"). In name s and relationships Fig. 81 "},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 The Stairway to Heaven they clearly paralleled the Greek gods Poseidon (Go d of the Seas), Zeus (Lord of the Gods) and Hades (God of the Lower Worl d). Ba'al, as Zeus, was always armed with a lightning-missile (Fig. 82) , the bull his cult symbol. When Zeus fought Typhon, it was his sister Athena, goddess of War and Love, who alone stood by him; and in Egypti an tales, Isis alone stood by her brother-husband Osiris. So it was when Ba'al fought his two brothers: his sister-lover Anat alone came to his h elp. Like Athena, she was on the one hand \"The Maiden,\" often flaunting her n aked beauty (Fig. 82); and on the other hand the Goddess of War, the lion a symbol of her bravery (Fig. 83). (The Old Testament called her Ashtoreth. ) The links to Egyptian prehistorical recollections a nd beliefs were no less obvious than to those of Greece. Osiris was resurre cted by Isis after she had found his remains at the Ganaanite city of Byblos. Likewise, Ba'al was brought back to life by Anat after he was smitten b y Mot. Seth, the adversary of Osiris, was sometimes called in Egypti an writings \"Seth of Saphon\"; Ba'al, as we shall see, acquired the title \"Lord of Zaphon.\" Egyptian monuments of the New Kingdom—paralleling t he Ganaanite period—often depicted the Ganaanite gods as Egyptia n deities, calling them Min, Reshef, Kadesh, Anthat (Fig. 84). We thus find the same tales applying to the same gods, but under different name s, throughout the ancient world. Scholars have pointed out that all these tales were echoes, if not actual versions, of the much earlier and original Sumerian tales: not only of Man's Search for Immortality, but also of love, death and resurrection among the gods. All along, the tales are replete with episode s, details, epithets, and teachings which also fill the Old Testament—attesti ng to a common locale (greater Canaan), common traditions and common orig inal versions. One such text is the tale of Danel (Dan-El—\"El's ju dge\"—Daniel in Hebrew), a righteous chieftain who could not beget a rightful heir. He appealed to the gods to give him one, so that when he died, the son could erect a stela in his memory at Kadesh. From this we surmise that the area of the tale's events was where southern Canaan (the Ne gev) merges into the Sinai peninsula, for it was there that Kadesh (\"The Sacred\" city) was located. Kadesh was encompassed in the territory of the bibl ical Patriarch Abraham; and the Canaanite tale of Danel is indeed replete with similarities to the biblical tale of the birth of Isaac to the a ging Abraham and Sarah. Much as in the Book of Genesis, we read in the Cana anite tale that Danel, getting on in years without a male heir, saw his ch ance to get divine help when two gods arrived at his habitat. \"Forthwith .. . he gives offering to the gods to eat, gives offering to drink to the Hol y Ones.\" The divine guests—who turn out to be El, \"The Dispenser of Hea ling,\" and Ba'al— stay with Danel a whole week, during which he overw helms them with his supplications. Finally Ba'al \"approaches El with his (Danel's) plea.\""},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"Fig. 83 Fig. 84 Riders of the Clouds 153 "},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"154 The Stairway to Heaven Yielding, El \"by the hand takes his servant\" and grants him \"Spirit\" whereby Danel's virility is restored: With life-breath Danel is quickened . , .

Mount your bed, he tells him, kiss your wife, embrace her . . . \"by concepti on and pregnancy she will bear a male child to Danel.\" And just as in th e biblical tale, the matriarch does bear a Rightful Heir, and the Succes sion is assured. They name him Aqhat, the gods nickname him Na'aman (\"The Pleasant One\"), As the boy grows to be a young man, the Craftsman o f the Gods presents him with a gift of a unique bow. This soon arouses the envy of Anat, who wishes to possess the magical bow. To get it, she p romises Aqhat anything he would like to have—silver, gold, even Immortalit y: Ask for Life, O Aqhat the youth— Ask for Life and I will grant it to thee; For Immortality (ask), and I will bestow it upon thee. With Baal I will make thee count the years; With the sons of El shalt thou count the months. Moreover—she promised—not only would he live as lon g as the gods, but he would be invited to join them for the Lifegi ving ceremony: And Baal, when he grants Life, a feast he gives; A banquet he holds for the One-Given-Life. He bids him a drink, sings and chants over him sweetly. But Aqhat does not believe that Man can escape his mortal fate, and does not wish to part with the bow: Lie not, O Maiden— to a hero thy lies are loathesome. How can a mortal an Afterlife acquire? How can a mortal Eternity obtain? . . . The death of all men will I die; Yea, I shall surely die. He also points out to Anat that the bow was made fo r warriors like himself and not for a female to use. Insulted, Anat \"traver ses the land\" to El's abode, to seek permission to smite Aqhat. El's enig matic response permits punishment only up to a point."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"Riders of the Clouds 155 Now Anat turns to cunning. \"Over a thousand fields, ten thousand acres\" she travels back to Aqhat. Pretending to be at peac e and in love with him, she laughs and giggles. Addressing him as \"Aqhat th e youth,\" she states: \"Thou are my brother, I am thy sister.\" She persuad es him to accompany her to the city of \"The Father of the gods; the Lor d of the Moon.\" There she asks Taphan to \"slay Aqhat for his bow\" but then \"m ake him live again\"—to put Aqhat to temporary death, only long enough for Anat to take away his bow. Taphan, following Anat's instructions, \"smites Aqhat twice on the skull, thrice above the ear,\" and Aqhat's \"soul esc apes like vapor.\" But before Aqhat can be revived—if Anat had ever so int ended—his body is ravaged by vultures. The terrible news is brought t o Danel as, \"sitting before the gate, under a mighty tree, he \"judges th e cause of the widow, adjucates the case of the orphan.\" With Baal's aid, a search is instituted for the dismembered Aqhat, but to no avail. In revenge, Aqhat's sister, in disguise, travels to the abode of Taphan and, getti ng him drunk, attempts to slay him. (A possible happy end, wherein Aqhat was resurrected after all. is missing.) The transfer of action from the mountains of Lebano n to the \"City of Lord Moon\" is also an element found in the Gilgamesh epi c. Throughout the ancient Near East, the deity associated with the Mo on was Sin (Nannar in the original Sumerian). His Ugaritic epithet was \"F ather of Gods\"; he indeed was the father of Ishtar and her brothers. T he first attempt of Gilgamesh to reach his goal via the Landing Place i n the Cedar Mountain was frustrated by Ishtar, who sought to have him ki lled by the Bull of Heaven after he rejected her advances. Undertaking the second journey toward the Land Tilmun, Gilgamesh too arrived at a walled city \"whose temple to Sin was dedicated.\" But whereas Gilgamesh arrived in the region of Sin after a long and hazardous trek, Anat—like Ishtar—could get around f rom place to place in no time—for she neither walked nor traveled on assb ack; instead, she flew from place to place. Many Mesopotamian texts referr ed to Ishtar s flying journeys and her ability to roam in Earth's skies, \"crossing heaven, crossing earth.\" A depiction of her in her temple in Ashur, an Assyrian capital, showed her wearing goggles, a tight-fitting helmet and extended \"ear- phones\" or panels (see Fig. 58). In the ruins of Ma ri on the Euphrates River, a life-sized statue of a goddess was found, equipped with a \"black box,\" a hose, a horned helmet with built-in earphon es and other attributes of an aeronaut (Fig. 85). This ability \"as a bird t o fly,\" also attributed to the Canaanite deities, features in all the epic tales d iscovered at Ugarit. One such tale, in which a goddess flies to the resc ue, is a text titled by scholars \"The Legend of King Keret\"—Keret being cap able of interpreta- tion as the king's personal name, or the name of hi s city (\"The Capital\"). The tale's main theme is the same as that of the Su merian epic of Gilgamesh: Man's striving for Immortality. But it b egins like the biblical tale of Job, and has other strong biblical similari ties."},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"156 The Stairway to Heaven Fig. 85 Job, according to the biblical tale, was a righteou s and \"pure\" man of great wealth and power who lived in the \"Land of Ut z\" (the \"Land of Advice\"), a land in the domain of the \"Children of the East.\" All went well until \"one day, when the sons of the gods came to p resent themselves to the Lord, Satan came also among them.\" Persuading the L ord to test Job, Satan was permitted to afflict him first with the loss of his children and all his wealth, and then with all manner of sickness. As Jo b sat mourning and suffering, three of his friends came to console him ; the Book of Job was composed as a record of their discussions concernin g matters of life and death and the mysteries of Heaven and Earth. Bewailing the turn of events, Job longed for the da ys of yore, when he was honored and respected: \"at the gates of Keret, in the public square, my seat was at the ready.\" In those days, Job reminisc ed, he believed that \"as the Phoenix shall be my days, with my Establisher s hall I die.\" But now, with nothing left and afflicted with illnesses, he felt like dying then and there. The friend who had come from the south reminded him that \"Man is born unto travail; only the son of Reshef can to the hei ghts fly up\"; Man was mortal after all, so why this extreme agitation? But Job answered enigmatically that it was not so s imple: \"The Lord's Essence is within me,\" he said; \"its radiance feeds my Spirit.\" Was he disclosing, in the hitherto uncomprehended verse, t hat he was of partly divine blood? That, therefore, like Gilgamesh, he h ad expected to live as long as the ever-rejuvenating Phoenix, to die only when his \"Establisher\" shall die. But now he realized that \"Eternally I sh all no longer live; like vapor are my days.\" The tale of Keret too depicts him at first as a pro sperous man who loses in quick succession his wife and children through sick ness and war. \"He sees his offspring ruined ... in its entirety a posterit y perishing,\" and realizes that it is the end of his dynasty: \"wholly undermin ed is his throne.\" His mourning and grief grow daily; \"his bed is soaked b y his weeping.\" Daily \"he enters the inner chamber\" in the temple and cri es to his gods. Finally,"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"Riders of the Clouds 157 El \"descends unto him\" to find out \"what ails Keret that he weeps.\" It is then that the texts disclose that Keret is partly d ivine, for it was El who had fathered him (by a human female). El advises his \"beloved lad\" to stop mourning, and to remarry, for he would be blessed with a new heir. He is told to was h and make himself presentable, and go seek the hand of the daughter o f the king of Udum (possibly the biblical Edom). Keret, accompanied by troops and laden with gifts, goes to Udum and does as El had instructed. But the king of Udum turns down all the silver and gold. Knowing that Ke ret \"is the flesh of the Father of Men\"—of divine origins—he asks for a uniq ue dowry: let the firstborn son that his daughter shall bear Keret al so be semi-divine! The decision is, of course, not up to Keret. El, wh o had given him the marriage counsel to begin with, is not available. K eret therefore sets his steps to the shrine of Asherah, and seeks her help. The next scene takes place at the abode of El, where the appeal of Asher ah is supported by the younger gods: Then came the companies of the gods. And puissant Ba'al spake up: \"Now come, O Kindly One, El benign: Will thou not bless Keret the pure blooded, nor please the beloved lad of El?\" Thus prodded, El consents and \"blesses Keret,\" prom ising him that he shall have seven sons and several daughters. The fi rstborn son, El announces, is to be named Yassib (\"Permanent\") for indeed he will be granted permanence. This will be achieved because w hen he is born, not his mother but rather the goddesses Asherah and Ana t will suckle him.

As it became clear that Keret was on the verge of death, his sons were astonished: How can this happen to Keret, \"a son of El, an offspring of the Kindly One, a holy being?\" In disbelief, the sons q uestion their father—for surely his failed claim to Immortality has a bearin g on their own lives as well: In thy Life, father, we rejoiced; We exalted in thy Not-dying . . . Wilt thou die then, father, like the mortals? Their father's silence speaks for itself, and now t he sons turn to the gods: How can it be said, \"A son of El is Keret, an offspring of the Kindly One and a holy being?\" Shall then a god die? An offspring of the Kindly One not live? Embarrassed, El asks the other gods: \"Who among the gods can remove the sickness, drive out the malady?\" Seven times El issued this appeal, but \"none among the gods answers him.\" In desperation, El appeals to the Craftsman of the Gods and his assistants, the Craft s-goddesses who know all magic.

Of greater importance to the understanding of ancie nt events are the several epic tales dealing with the gods themselves . In these, the ability of the gods to fly about is accepted as a matter of co urse; and their haven in the \"Crest of Zaphon\" is featured as the aeronauts' resting place. The central figures in these tales are Ba'al and Anat, the brother-sister who are also lovers. Ba'al's frequent epithet is \"The Rider of the Clouds\"—an epithet which the Old Testament has claimed for the Hebrew deity. Anat's own flying capabilities, which became apparent in t he tales dealing with the relations between gods and men, are even more highl ighted in the tales of the gods themselves."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"Riders of the Clouds 159 In one such text, Anat is told that Ba'al went to f ish \"in the meadow of Samakh\" (Fig. 87).

Ba'al is advised to present himself to El, and put the dispute before the \"Assembled Body\"—Council—of the gods. His sisters c ounsel him to be defiant: There now, be off on your way toward the Assembled Body, in the midst of Mount Lala. At the feet of El do not fall down, prostrate thyself not unto the Assembled Body; Proudly standing, say ye your speech. Learning of the ploy, Yam sends his own emissaries to the gathered gods, to demand that the rebellious Ba'al be surrendered to him. \"The gods were sitting to eat, the Holy Ones for dinner; Ba'al was attending upon El\" when the emissaries entered. In the hush that followed, they present Yam's demand. To indicate that they meant business, \"at E l's feet they do not fall down\"; they hold their weapons at the ready: \"Eyes that are like a whetted sword, flashing a consuming fire.\" The gods drop to the ground and take cover. El is willing to yield Ba'al. But Ba'al seiz es his own weapons and is about to jump the emissaries, when his mother restr ains him: an emissary bears immunity, she reminds him. As the emissaries return to Yam empty-handed, it is clear that there is no way but for the two gods to meet on the battlefield . A goddess—perhaps Anat—conspires with the Craftsman of the Gods to pr ovide Ba'al with two divine weapons, the \"chaser\" and the \"thrower\" whic h \"swoop like an eagle.\" Meeting in combat, Ba'al overwhelms Yam and is about to \"smash Yam,\" when the voice of Asherah reaches him: spare Yam! Yam is allowed to live, but is banished to his maritime domains. In return for sparing Yam, Ba'al asks Asherah to su pport his quest for supremacy over the Crest of Zaphon. Asherah is rest ing at a seaside resort, and it is quite reluctantly that she makes the jour ney to El's abode in a hot and dry place.

It turned out that Ba'al desire d a two-part structure, one an E-khal (a \"great house\") and the other a Behmtam , commonly translated \"house\" but which literally means \"a raised platfor m.\" There was some disagreement between the two regarding where a funn el-like window, which could open and close in some unusual manner, should be placed. \"Thou shalt heed my words, O Ba'al,\" Kothar-Hasis i nsisted. When the structure was completed, Ba'al was concerned that h is wives and children would be hurt. To allay his fears, Kothar-Hasis ord ered that trees of Lebanon, \"from Sirion its precious cedars,\" be pile d up within the structure—and started up a fire. For a full week th e fire burnt intensely; silver and gold within it melted down; but the stru cture itself was neither damaged nor destroyed. The underground silo and raised platform were ready ! Losing no time, Ba'al decided to test the facility; Ba'al opened the Funnel in the Baised Platform, the window within the Great House. In the clouds, Ba'al opened rifts. His godly sound Ba'al discharges. . . . His godly sound convulses the earth. The mountains quake. . . . A-tremble are the . . . In east and west, earth's mounts reel. As Ba'al soared skyward, the divine messengers Gapa n and Ugar joined him in flight: \"The winged ones, the twain, flock t he clouds\" behind Ba'al; \"bird-like the twain\" soared above the snow-covered peaks of Zaphon. But with the new facilities, the Crest of Zaphon was tu rned into the \"Fastness of Zaphon \"; and Mount Lebanon (\"The White One,\" after its snowy peaks) acquired the epithet Sirion—\"The Armored\" Mountain. Attaining mastery over the Fastness of Zaphon, Ba'a l also acquired the title Ba'al Zaphon. The title simply means \"Lord of Zaphon,\" of the Northern Place. But the original connotation of the term Zaphon was not geographical; it meant both \"the hidden-away,\" and \"the observation place.\" Undoubtedly, all these connotations played a role in naming Ba'al \"Lord of Zaphon.\" Now that he had attained these powers and prerogatives, Ba'al's"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"162 The Stairway to Heaven ambitions grew in scope. Inviting the \"sons of the gods\" to a banquet, he demanded fealty and vassalage; those who disagreed were set upon: \"Ba'al seizes the sons of Asherah; Rabbim he strikes in th e back, Dokyamm he strikes with a bludgeon.\" While some were slaughter ed, others escaped. Drunk with power, Ba'al mocked them: Baal's enemies take to the woods; His enemies hide in the side of the mountain. Puissant Ba'al shouts: \"O enemies of Ba'al why do you quake? Why do you run, why do you hide?\" The Eye of Ba'al splinters up; His stretched hand the cedar breaks; His right (hand) is mighty- Pursuing his quest for mastery, Ba'al—with the aid of Anat—battled and annihilated such male adversaries as \"Lothan, the s erpent,\" Shalyat, \"the seven-headed dragon,\" Atak \"the Bullock,\" as well a s the goddess Hashat, \"the Bitch.\" We know from the Old Testament that Ya hweh, the biblical Lord, was also a bitter adversary of Ba'al; and as Ba'al's influence grew among the Israelites when their king married a Cana anite princess, the prophet Elijah arranged a contest between Ba'al and Yahweh upon Mount Carmel. When Yahweh prevailed, the three hundred pr iests of Ba'al were promptly executed. In this adversity, it was for Ya hweh that the Old Testament claimed mastery over the Crest of Zaphon. Significantly, the claims were made in almost identical language, as P salm 29 and other verses make clear: Give unto Yahweh, O sons of the gods, Unto Yahweh give homage and supremacy. Give unto the Lord the homage of his Shem; Bow down unto Him in his Sacred Splendor. The sound of the Lord is upon the waters: The Lord of Glory thundereth, echoes upon the many waters. His sound is powerful, full of majesty. The sound of the Lord the cedars breaks; The cedars of Lebanon Yahweh splinters. He makes Lebanon skip as a calf, and Sirion like a young buffalo. His sound from amidst the fiery flames cuts through . . . . The Lord in his Great House is glorified. As Ba'al in the Canaanite texts, so was the Hebrew Deity \"Rider of the Clouds.\" The Prophet Isaiah envisioned Him flying s outh toward Egypt, \"riding swiftly upon a cloud, he shall descend upon Egypt; the gods of"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"Riders of the Clouds 163 Egypt shall quail before him.\" Isaiah also claimed to have personally seen the Lord and His winged attendants: In the year that king Uzziah died, I beheld and saw the Lord seated upon a high and raised up Throne; its Lifters filled up the Great House. The Fire-Attendants were stationed above it, six wings, six wings to each of them . . . The threshold beams were shaken by the s ound, and the House was filled with smoke. The Hebrews were forbidden to worship, and therefor e to make, statues or engraved images. But the Canaanites, who must ha ve known of Yahweh, as the Hebrews had known of Ba'al, left us a depict ion of Yahweh as conceived by them. A fourth century B.C. coin which bears the inscription Yahu (\"Yahweh\") depicts a bearded deity seated upon a throne shaped as a winged wheel (Fig. 88). It was thus universally assumed in the ancient Near East that lordship over Zaphon established the supremacy among the god s who could fly Fig. 88 about. This, no doubt, was what Ba'al had expected. But seven years after the Fastness of Zaphon was completed, Ba'al faced a challenge by Mot, Lord of the southern lands and the Lower World. As it turned out, the dispute was no longer about the mastery of Zaphon; rather, it had to do with \"who over the whole Earth dominion shall have.\" Word somehow reached Mot that Ba'al was engaged in suspicious activities. Unlawfully and clandestinely, he was \"p utting one lip to Earth and one lip to Heaven,\" and was attempting to \"stre tch his speech to the planets.\" Mot at first demanded the right to inspec t the goings-on within the Crest of Zaphon. Instead, Ba'al sent emissaries with messages of peace. Who needs war? he asked; let us \"pour peace and ami ty into the center of Earth.\" As Mot became more persistent, Ba'al conclu ded that the only way to prevent Mot from coming to Zaphon was for Ba'al to go to Mot's abode. So he journeyed to Mot's \"pit\" \"in the depths of Ea rth,\" professing obedience. Yet what he really had in mind was something mor e sinister—the"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"164 The Stairway to Heaven overthrow of Mot. For that, he needed the help of t he ever-faithful Anat. And so it was that while Ba'al had gone to Mot, his emissaries reached Anat at her own abode. The two emissaries were instructe d to repeat to Anat, word for word, an enigmatic message: I have a word of secret to tell thee, a message to whisper unto thee: It is a contraption that launches words, a Stone that whispers. Men its messages will not know; Earth's multitudes will not comprehend. \"Stones\" in the ancient languages, we must bear in mind, encompassed all quarried or mined substances and thus included all minerals and metals. Anat, therefore, readily understood what Ba'al was telling her: He was setting up upon the Crest of Zaphon some sophistica ted contraption that could send or intercept secret messages! The \"Stone of Splendor\" was further described in th e secret message: Heaven with Earth it makes converse, and the seas with the planets. It is a Stone of Splendor; To Heaven it is yet unknown. Let's you and I raise it within my cavern, on lofty Zaphon. So that was the secret: Ba'al, without the knowledg e of \"Heaven\"—the government of the home planet—was setting up a clan destine communica- tions center, from which he could converse with all the parts of Earth, as well as with the Spacecraft above Earth. It was a f irst step to \"over the whole Earth dominion to have.\" In that, he ran into direct conflict with Mot; for it was in Mot's territories that the offic ial \"Eye of Earth\" was located. Having received and understood the message, Anat re adily agreed to go to Baal's aid. The worried emissaries were promised that she would be there on time: \"You are slow, I am swift,\" she assu red them: The god's distant place I will penetrate, the distant Hollow of the sons of the gods. Two openings it (has) under the Eye of Earth, and three wide tunnels. Arriving at Mot's capital, she could not find Ba'al . Demanding to know his whereabouts, she threatened Mot with violence. Finally, she learnt the truth: the two gods had engaged in hand combat, and \"Ba'al was fallen.\" Enraged, she \"with a sword cleaved Mot.\" Then with the aid of Shepesh,"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"Riders of the Clouds 165 mistress of the Rephaim (the \"Healers\"), the lifele ss body of Ba'al was flown back to the peak of Zaphon, and placed in a cavern. Quickly, the two goddesses summoned the Craftsman o f the Gods, also referred to as El Kessem—\"The God of Magic.\" As Tho th had revived the snake-bitten Horus, so was Ba'al miraculously resur rected. But whether he was resurrected physically on Earth, or in a Celest ial Afterlife (as Osiris), one cannot be certain. When did the gods act out these events upon the Cre st of Zaphon, no one can say for sure. But we do know that Mankind was c ognizant of the existence and unique attributes of the \"Landing Pla ce\" almost from the beginning of recorded history. We have, to begin with, the journey of Gilgamesh to the Cedar Mountain, which his epic also calls \"Abode of the g ods, the Crossroads of Ishtar.\" There, \"pressing into the forest,\" he came upon a tunnel which led to \"the enclosure from which words of command are i ssued.\" Proceeding deeper into the mountain, \"the secret abode of the Anunnaki he opened up.\" It is as though Gilgamesh had penetrated the v ery installations which Ba'al had secretly constructed! Mystery-filled vers es in the epic now assume a thrilling meaningfulness: Secret things he has seen; What is hidden from Man, he knows. . . . This, we know, took place in the third millennium B .C.— circa 2900 B.C. The next link between the affairs of gods and men i s the tale of the aging and heirless Danel, who had resided somewhere near Kadesh. There is no time frame given for the tale's occurrences, but th e similarities with the biblical tale of the heirless Abraham—including the sudden appearance of \"men\" who turn out to be the Lord and his Emissarie s, and the locale not far from Kadesh—suggest the possibility that we are reading two versions of the same ancestral memory. If so, we have another d atemark: the beginning of the second millenium B.C. Zaphon was still there, a Fastness of the Gods, in the first millenium B.C. The prophet Isaiah (eighth century B.C.) castigated the Assyrian invader of Judea, Sennacherib, for having insulted the Lord by ascending with his many chariots \"to the mountain's height, unto the C rest of Zaphon.\" Stressing the antiquity of the place, the prophet t ransmitted to Sennacherib the Lord's admonition: Hast thou not heard it? Long ago have I made it, In days of old have I created it.

We have here not only confirmation of the existence of the place and its antiquity, but also a description of it: it include d a \"raised platform,\" from which one could ascend heavenward and become a \"Lof ty One\"—a god.

They encompass a grand temple to Jupiter—t he grandest built anywhere in antiquity to honor any one god. Many Ro man rulers, over a period of some four centuries, toiled to glorify th is remote and alien place and erect its monumental structures. Emperors and g enerals came to it in search of oracles, to find out their fate. Roman le gionnaires sought to be billeted near it; the devout and the curious went t o see it with their own eyes: it was one of the wonders of the ancient worl d. Daring European travelers, risking life and limb, r eported the existence of the ruins since the visit there by Martin Raumga rten in January 1508. In 1751, the traveler Robert Wood, accompanied by the artist James Dawkins, restored some of the place's ancient fame when they described it in words and sketches. \"When we compare the ruins . . . with those of many cities we visited in Italy, Greece, Egypt and other parts of Asia, we cannot help thinking them the remains of the boldest plan we ev er saw attempted in architecture\"—bolder in certain aspects than even t he great pyramids of Egypt, The view upon which Wood and his companion h ad come was a panorama in which the mountaintop, the temples and the skies blended into one (Fig. 90). The site is in the mountains of Lebanon, where they part to form a fertile, flat valley between the \"Lebanon\" range to the west and the \"Anti- Lebanon\" range to the east; where two rivers known from antiquity, the Litani and the Orontes, begin to flow into the Medi terranean Sea. The ruins were of imposing Roman temples that were erec ted upon a vast horizontal platform, artificially created at about 4,000 feet above sea level. The sacred precinct was surrounded by a wall, which served both as a retaining wall to hold the earthworks forming the f lat top, as well as a fence to protect and screen off the area. The enclosed sq uarish area, with some sides almost 2,500 feet long, measured over five mi llion square feet. Situated so as to command the flanking mountains an d the approaches to the valley from north and south, the sacred area ha d its northwestern corner deliberately cut off—as seen in this contemp orary bird's eye view (Fig. 91a). 168"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":" Fig. 90 The right-angled cutout created an oblong area, whi ch extended the platform's unimpeded northern view westward. It was at that specially conceived corner that the vastest-ever temple to Ju piter stood high, with some of the tallest (65 feet) and largest (7.5 feet in diameter) columns known in antiquity. These columns supported an elaboratel y decorated superstruc- ture (\"architrave\") 16 feet in height, atop which t here was a slanting roof, further raising the temple's pinnacle. The temple proper was only the westernmost (and old est) part of a four- part shrine to Jupiter, which the Romans are believ ed to have started to build soon after they occupied the place in 63 B.C. Arranged along a slightly slanted east-west axis (F ig. 91b) were, first, a monumental Gateway (\"A\"); it comprised a grand stai rcase and a raised portico supported by twelve columns, in which there were twelve niches to hold the twelve Olympian gods. The worshippers then entered a forecourt (\"B\") of an hexagonal design, unique in Roman archi tecture; and through it continued to a vast altar court (\"C\"), which was do minated by an altar of monumental proportions: it rose some 60 feet from a base of about 70 by 70 feet. At the western end of the court stood the god 's house proper (\"D\"). Measuring a colossal 300 by 175 feet, it stood upon a podium which was itself raised some 16 feet above the level of the c ourt—a total of 42 feet above the level of the base platform. It was from t hat extra height that the tall columns, the architrave and the roof made toge ther a real ancient skyscraper. From its monumental gateway staircase to its final western wall, the shrine extended for more than 1,000 feet in length.

A comparison with the renowned Acropolis of Athens will give one a good idea of the scale of this Lebanese platform and its temples. The Athens complex (Fig. 93) is situated upon a stepped ship-l ike terrace less than 1,000 feet at its longest and about 400 feet at its widest. The stunning Parthenon (temple of Athena) which still dominates the once sacred area and the whole plain of Athens is about 230 by 100 f eet—even smaller than the temple of Mercury/Bacchus at the Lebanese Site. Having visited the ruins, the archaeologist and arc hitect Sir Mortimer Wheeler wrote two decades ago: \"The temples . . . o we nothing of their quality to such new-fangled aids as concrete. They stand passively upon the largest known stones in the world, and some of thei r columns are the tallest from antiquity. . . . Here we have the last great m onument ... of the Hellenic world.\" Hellenic world indeed, for there is no reason that any historian or archaeologist could find for this gigantic effort b y the Romans, in an out-of- the-way place in an unimportant province, except fo r the fact that the place was hallowed by the Greeks who had preceded them. T he gods to whom the three temples were dedicated—Jupiter, Venus and Mercury (or Bacchus)—were the Greek gods Zeus, his sister Aphro dite and his son Hermes (or Dionysus). The Romans considered the site and its great temple as the ultimate attestations of the almightiness and supremacy of J upiter. Calling him love (echo of the Hebrew Yehovah?), they inscribed upon the temple and its main statue the divine initials I.O.M.H.—the legend standing for Iove Optimus Maximus Heliopolitanus: the Optimal and Max imal Jupiter the Heliopolitan. The latter title of Jupiter stemmed from the fact t hat though the great temple was dedicated to the Supreme God, the place itself was considered to have been a resting place of Helios, the Sun god who could traverse the skies in his swift chariot. The belief was transmit ted to the Romans by the Greeks, from whom they also adopted the name of the place: Heliopolis. How the Greeks had come to so name the place, no on e knows for sure; some suggest that it was so named by Alexander the Great. Yet Greek veneration of the place must have been ol der and deeper rooted, for it made the Romans glorify the place wi th the greatest of monuments, and seek there the oracle's word concern ing their fate. How else to explain the fact that, \"in terms of sheer a creage, weight of stone, dimensions of the individual blocks, and the amount of carving, this precinct can scarcely have had a rival in the Graec o-Roman world\" (John M.

Zeus (Jupiter to the Rom ans), it will be recalled, arrived in Crete from Phoenicia (today's Lebanon), swimming across the Mediterranean Sea after he had abducted the beautif ul daughter of the king of Tyre. Aphrodite too came to Greece from western Asia. And the wandering Dionysus, to whom the second temple (or p erhaps another) was dedicated, brought the vine and winemaking to Greec e from the same lands of western Asia. Aware of the worship's earlier roots, the Roman his torian Macrobius enlightened his countrymen in the following words ( Saturnalia I, Chapter 23): The Assyrians too worship the sun under the name of Jupiter, Zeus Helioupolites as they call him, with important rite s in the city of Heliopolis. . . . That this divinity is at once Jupiter and the Sun i s manifest both from the nature of its ritual and from its outward appea rance. . . . To prevent any argument from ranging through a whol e list of divinities, I will explain what the Assyrians belie ve concerning the power of the sun (god). They have given the name Adad to the god whom they venerate as highest and greatest. . . . The hold the place had over the beliefs and imagina tion of people throughout the millennia also manifested itself in the history of the place following its Roman veneration. When Macrobius wrot e the above, circa A . D . 400, Rome was already Christian and the site was al ready a target of zealous destruction. No sooner did Constantine the Great ( A . D . 306-337) convert to Christianity, than he stopped all additi onal work there and instead began the conversion of the place into a Ch ristian shrine. In the year 440, according to one chronicler, \"Theodosius destroyed the temples of the Greeks; he transformed into a Christian chur ch the temple of Heliopolis, that of Ba'al Helios, the great Sun-Baa l of the celebrated Trilithon.\" Justinian (525-565) apparently carried off some of the pillars of red granite to Constantinople, the Byzantine capita l, to build there the church of Hagia Sophia. These efforts to Christiani ze the place encountered repeated armed opposition by the local populace. When the Muslims gained the area in the year 637, t hey converted the Roman temples and Christian churches atop the huge platform into a Muhammedan enclave. Where Zeus and Jupiter had been worshiped, a mosque was built to worship Allah.

As a result, such scholars as Henry Seyrig (La Triade Heliopolitaine) and Rene Dussaud (Temples et Cultes Heliopolitaine) have concluded t hat a basic triad had been worshipped throughout the ages. It was headed by the God of the Thunderbolt and included the Warrior Maiden and the Celestial Charioteer. They and other scholars helped establis h the now generally accepted conclusion, that the Roman-Greek triad ste mmed from the earlier Semitic beliefs, which in turn were based upon the Sumerian pantheon. The earliest Triad was headed, it appears, by Adad, who was allotted by his father Enlil—the chief god of Sumer—\"the mountainla nds of the north.\" The female member of the Triad was Ishtar. After he visited the area, Alexander the Great struck a coin honoring Ishtar/A starte and Adad; the coin bears his name in Phoenician-Hebrew script (Fi g. 94). The third member of the Triad was the Celestial Charioteer, S hamash—commander of the prehistoric astronauts. The Greeks honored h im (as Helios) by erecting a colossal statue atop the main temple (se e Fig. 92), showing him Fig. 94 driving his chariot. To them, its swiftness was den oted by the four horses that pulled it; the authors of the Book of Enoch kn ew better: \"The chariot of Shamash,\" it says, \"was driven by the wind.\" Examining the Roman and Greek traditions and belief s, we have arrived back at Sumer; we have circled back to Gilgamesh an d his Search for Immortality in the Cedar Forest, at the \"crossroads of Ishtar.\" Though in the territory of Adad, he was told, the place was a lso within the jurisdiction of Shamash. And so we have the original Triad: Adad , Ishtar, Shamash. Have we come upon the Landing Place? That the Greeks were aware of the epic adventures o f Gilgamesh, few scholars nowadays doubt. In their \"investigation of the origins of human knowledge and its transmission through Myth,\" entit led Hamlet's Mill, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von Deschend point out that \"Alexander was a true replica of Gilgamesh.\" But even earlier, in the historic tales of Homer, the heroic Odysseus had already followed sim ilar footsteps.

Left alive alone, Odysseu s wandered about until he reached the \"Ogygian island\"—the secluded place from pre-Deluge times. There, the goddess Calypso, \"who kept him in a cave and fed him, wanted him to marry her; in which case she intended making him immortal, so that he should never grow old.\" But Odysseus ref used her advances— just as Gilgamesh had turned down Ishtar's offer of love. Henry Seyrig, who as Director of Antiquities of Syr ia devoted a lifetime to the study of the vast platform and its meaning, found that the Greeks used to conduct there \"rites of mystery, in which A fterlife was represented as human Immortality—an identification with the dei ty obtained by the ascent (heavenward) of the soul.\" The Greeks, he co ncluded, indeed associated this place with Man's efforts to attain Immortality. Was then this place the very place in the Cedar Mou ntains to which Gilgamesh had first gone with Enkidu, the Crest of Zaphon of Ba'al? To give a definite answer, let us look more closely at the physical features of the place. We will find that the Romans and Gree ks have built their temples upon a paved platform which existed from mu ch earlier times—a platform constructed of large, thick stone blocks s o tightly put together that no one—to this very day—has been able to penetrate it and study the chambers, tunnels, caverns and other substructures that lie hidden beneath it. That such subterranean structures undoubtedly exist is judged not only from the fact that other Greek temples had secret, subterranean cellars and grottoes beneath their apparent floors. Georg Ebers and Hermann Guthe (Palastina in Bild und Wort, the English version is titled Picturesque Palestine) reported a century ago that the local Ar abs entered the ruins \"at the southeast corner, through a long vaulted passag e like a railway tunnel under the great platform\" (Fig. 95). \"Two of these great vaults run parallel with each other, from east to west, and are connect ed by a third running at right angles to them from north to south.\" As soon as they entered the tunnel, they were caught in total darkness, broken here and there by eerie green lights from puzzling \"laced windows.\" Emergin g from the 460-feet- long tunnel, they found themselves under the north wall of the Sun Temple, \"which the Arabs call Dar-as-saadi—House of Supreme Blissful- ness.\" The German archaeologists also reported that the pl atform apparently rested upon gigantic vaults; but they concerned the mselves with mapping and reconstructing the superstructure. A French arc haeological mission, led by Andre Parrot in the 1920s, confirmed the exi stence of the subterranean maze, but was unable to penetrate its hidden parts. When the platform was pierced from above through its thick s tones, evidence was found of structures beneath it. The temples were erected upon a platform raised to thirty feet, depending on the terrain.

Constructed of layer upon layer of huge sto nes, the Podium rose twenty-six feet above the level of the Court in fro nt of it and forty-two feet above the ground on its exposed northern and wester n sides.

More massive by far were the stone blocks in the we stern side of the Podium. As shown in the schematic drawing of the no rthwestern corner prepared by the German archaeological team (Fig. 96 b), the protruding base and the top layers of the Podium were construc ted of \"cyclopian\" stone blocks some of which measure over thirty-one feet i n length, about thirteen feet in height and are twelve feet thick. Each such slab represents thus about 5,000 cubic feet of stone and weighs more tha n 500 tons. Large as these stones are—the largest ones in the G reat Pyramid of Egypt weigh 200 tons—they were not the largest slab s of granite employed by the ancient master builder in creating the Podiu m. The central layer—situated some twenty feet above t he base of the Podium—was incredibly made up of even larger stones . Modern surveyors have spoken of them as \"giant,\" \"colossal,\" \"huge.\" Ancient historians named them the Trilithon—the Marvel of the Three St ones. For there, exposed to view in the western side of the Podium, lie side by side three stone blocks, the likes of which cannot be seen any where else in the world. Precisely shaped and perfectly fitting, each of the three stones (Fig. 97) measures over sixty feet in length, with sides of f ourteen and twelve feet. Each slab thus represents more than 10,000 cubic fe et of granite and weighs well over 1,000 tons! The stones for the Platform and Podium were quarrie d locally; Wood and Dawkins include one of these quarries (Fig. 90) in their panoramic sketch, showing some of the large stone blocks strewn aroun d in the ancient quarry. But the gigantic blocks were hewn, cut and shaped a t another quarry, situated in the valley some three-quarters of a mil e southwest of the sacred precinct. It is there that one comes upon a sight e ven more incredible than that of the Trilithon. Partly buried in the ground, there lies yet another one of the colossal granite slabs—left in situ by whoever the grand qua rrier was.

Local traditions hold that the place had e xisted from the days of Adam and his sons, who resided in the area of the C edar Mountains after the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Ed en. Adam, these legends relate, inhabited the place which is now Da mascus, and died not far from there. It was Cain his son who built a refuge upon the Cedar Crest after he had killed Abel. The Maronite Patriarch of Lebanon related the follo wing tradition: \"The fastness on Mount Lebanon is the most ancient build ing in the world. Cain, the son of Adam, built it in the year 133 of Creati on, during a fit of raving madness. He gave it the name of his son Enoch, and peopled it with giants who were punished for their iniquities by the Flood .\" After the Deluge, the place was rebuilt by the biblical Nimrod, in his ef forts to scale the heavens. The Tower of Babel, according to these legends, was not in Babylon but upon the great platform in Lebanon. A seventeenth-century traveler named d Arvieux wrot e in his Memoires (Part II, Chapter 26) that local Jewish inhabitants , as well as Muslim residents, held that an ancient manuscript found at the site revealed that \"After the Flood, when Nimrod reigned over Lebanon, he sent giants to rebuild the Fortress of Baalbek, which is so named in honor of Ba'al, the god of the Moabites, worshippers of the Sun-god.\" The association of the god Ba'al with the place in post-Diluvial days strikes a bell. Indeed, no sooner were the Greeks a nd Romans gone than the local people abandoned the Hellenistic name Hel iopolis and resumed calling the place by its Semitic name. It is the na me by which it is still called to this day: Baalbek. There are differing opinions as to the precise mean ing of the name. Many believe that it means \"The Valley of Ba'al.\" But fr om the spelling and from Talmudic references, we surmise that it has meant \" The Weeping of Ba'al.\" We can hear again the closing verses of the Ugariti c epic, describing the fall of Ba'al in his struggle with Mot, the discove ry of his lifeless body, his entombment by Anat and Shepesh in a grotto upon the Crest of Zaphon: They came upon Baal, fallen on the ground; Puissant Baal is dead; The Prince, Lord of Earth, is perished. . . . Anat weeps her fill of weeping; In the valley she drinks tears like wine. Loudly she calls unto the Gods' Torch, Shepesh: \"Lift Puissant Baal, I pray, lift him onto me.\" Hearkening, the Gods' Torch Shepesh Picks up Puissant Baal, Sets him on Anat's shoulder."},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"182 The Stairway to Heaven Up to the Fastness of Zaphon she brings him; Bewails him, entombs him; Lays him in the hollows of the earth. All these local legends, which as all legends conta in a kernel of age-old recollections of actual events, agree that the plac e is of extreme antiquity. They ascribe its building to \"giants\" and connect i ts construction with the events of the Deluge. They connect it with Ba'al, i ts function being that of a \"Tower of Babel\"—a place from which to \"scale the h eavens.\" As we look at the vast Platform, its location and l ayout, and ponder the purpose of the immense Podium built to sustain mass ive weights, the depiction on the coin from Byblos (Fig. 89) keeps f lashing before our eyes: a great temple, a walled sacred area, a podium of ext ra-strong construction— and upon it the rocket-like Flying Chamber. The words and descriptions of the Hidden Place in t he Epic of Gilgamesh also keep echoing in our ears. The insurmountable w all, the gate which stuns whoever touches it, the tunnel to the \"enclos ure from which words of command are issued,\" the \"secret abode of the Anunn aki,\" the monstrous Guardian with his \"radiant beam.\" And there is no doubt left in our mind that in Baal bek we have found Ba'al's Crest of Zaphon, the target of the first jo urney of Gilgamesh. The designation of Baalbek as \"the Crossroads of Is htar\" implies that, as she roamed Earth's skies, she could come and go from th at \"Landing Place\" to other landing places upon Earth. Likewise, the atte mpt by Ba'al to install upon the Crest of Zaphon \"a contraption that launch es words, a 'stone that whispers, \"' implied the existence elsewhere of sim ilar communication units: \"Heaven with Earth it makes converse, and th e seas with the planets.\" Were there indeed such other places on Earth that c ould serve as Landing Places for the aircraft of the gods? Were t here, besides upon the Crest of Zaphon, other \"stones that whisper\"? The first obvious clue is the very name \"Heliopolis ,\" indicating the Greek belief that Baalbek was, somehow, a \"City of the su n god\" paralleling its namesake city in Egypt. The Old Testament too recog nized the existence of a northern Beth-Shemesh (\"House of Shamash\") and a southern Beth- Shemesh, On, the biblical name for the Egyptian Hel iopolis. It was, the prophet Jeremiah said, the place of the \"Houses of the gods of Egypt,\" the location of Egypt's obelisks. The northern Beth-Shemesh was in Lebanon, not far f rom Beth-Anath (\"House/Home of Anat\"); the prophet Amos identified it as the location of the \"palaces of Adad . . . the House of the one who saw El.\" During the reign of Solomon, his domains encompassed large par ts of Syria and Lebanon, and the list of places where he had built great structures included Baalat (\"The Place of Ba'al\") and Tamar (\"The Place of Palms\"); most"},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"The tending Place 183 scholars identify these places as Baalhek and Palmy ra (see map, Fig. 78). Greek and Roman historians made many references to the links that connected the two Heliopolises. Explaining the Egyp tian pantheon of twelve gods to his countrymen, the Greek historian Herodotus also wrote of an \"Immortal whom the Egyptians venerated as Hercul es.\" He traced the origins of the worship of this Immortal to Phoenici a, \"hearing that there was a temple of Hercules at that place, very highly ven erated.\" In the temple he saw two pillars. \"One was of pure gold; the othe r was of emerald, shining with great brilliancy at night.\" Such sacred \"Sun Pillars\"—\"Stones of the gods\"—were actually depicted on Phoenician coins following the area's conquest b y Alexander (Fig, 99). Herodotus provides us with the additional informati on that of the two connected stones, one was made of the metal which i s the best conductor of electricity (gold); and the other of a precious sto ne (emerald) as is now used for laser communications, giving off an eerie radia nce as it emits a high- powered beam. Was it not like the contraption set u p by Ba'al, which the Canaanite text described as \"stones of splendor?\" The Roman historian Macrobius, writing explicitly a bout the connection between the Phoenician Heliopolis (Baalbek) and its Egyptian counterpart, also mentions a sacred stone; according to him, \"an object\" venerating the Sun god Zeus Helioupolites was carried by Egyptian priests from the Egyptian Heliopolis to Heliopolis (Baalbek) in the north. \"The object,\" he added, \"is now worshipped with Assyrian rather than Egyptian rites.\" Other Roman historians also stressed that the \"sacr ed stones\" worshiped by the \"Assyrians\" and the Egyptians were of a coni cal shape. Quintus Curtius recorded that such an object was located at the temple of Ammon at the oasis of Siwa. \"The thing which is worshipped t here as a god,\" Quintus Curtius wrote, \"has not the shape that artificers h ave usually applied to the gods. Rather, its appearance is most like an umbili cus, and it is made of an emerald and gems cemented together.\" The information regarding the conical object worshi ped at Siwa was quoted by F. L. Griffith in connection with the ann ouncement, in The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology (1916), of the disc overy of a conical \"omphalos\" at the Nubian \"pyramid city\" of Napata. This \"unique Meroitic monument\" (Fig. 100) was found by George A. Reisner of Harvard University at the inner sanctum of the temple of Am mon there—the southernmost temple to this god of Egypt. The term omphalos in Greek or umbilicus in Latin me ans a \"navel\"—a conical stone which, for reasons that scholars do n ot understand, was deemed in antiquity to have marked a \"center of the Earth. The temple of Ammon at the oasis of Siwa, it will b e recalled, was the location of the oracle which Alexander rushed to co nsult on his arrival in Egypt.

Was it mere coincidence that, in his search for the secrets of longevity, the Persian king Cambyses (as Herodotus has reporte d) sent his men to Nubia, to the temple where the \"Table of the Sun\" w as enshrined? Early in the first millennium B.C. a Nubian queen —the Queen of Sheba —made a long journey to King Solomon in Jerusalem. The lege nds current at Baalbek relate that he embellished the site in Lebanon in h er honor. Did she then undertake the long and hazardous voyage merely to e njoy the wisdom of Solomon, or was her real purpose to consult the ora cle at Baalbek—the biblical \"House of Shemesh?\" There seem to be more than just coincidences here; and the question that comes to mind is this: if at all these oracle cente rs an omphalos was enshrined—was the omphalos itself the very source o f the oracles? The construction (or reconstruction) upon the Crest of Zaphon of a launching silo and a landing platform for Ba'al was not the cause of his fatal battle with Mot. Rather, it was his clandestine att empt to set up a \"Stone of Splendor.\" This device could communicate with the h eavens as well as with other places on Earth. But, in addition, it was A stone that whispers; Men its messages will not know, Earth's multitudes will not comprehend. As we ponder the apparent dual function of the Ston e of Splendor, the secret message of Ba'al to Anat all of a sudden bec omes clear: the same device which the gods used to communicate with each other was also the object from which there emanated the gods' oracular answers to the kings and heroes! "},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"The Landing Place 185 In a most thorough study on the subject, Wilhelm H. Roscher (Omphalos) showed that the Indo-European term for t hese oracle stones— navel in English, nabel in German, etc.—stem from t he Sanskrit nabh, which meant \"emanate forcefully.'' It is no coincid ence that in the Semitic languages naboh meant to foretell and nabih meant \" prophet.\" All these identical meanings undoubtedly harken back to the S umerian, in which NA.BA(R) meant \"bright-shiny stone that solves.\" A veritable network of such oracle sites emerges as we study ancient writings. Herodotus—who accurately reported (Book I I, 29) the existence of the Meroitic oracle of Jupiter-Ammon—added to th e links we have so far discussed by stating that the \"Phoenicians,\" who es tablished the oracle at Siwa, also established the oldest oracle center in Greece, the one at Dodona —a mountain site in northwestern Greece (near the p resent Albanian border). To that effect, he related a report he had heard wh en he visited Egypt, whereby \"two sacred women were once carried off fro m Thebes (in Egypt) by the Phoenicians . . . one of them was sold into Libya (western Egypt) and the other into Greece. These women were the fir st founders of the oracles in the two countries.\" This version, Herodo tus wrote, he heard from the Egyptian priests of Thebes. But at Dodona, the version was that \"two black doves flew away from the Egyptian Thebes,\" on e alighting at Dodona and the other at Siwa: whereupon an oracle of Jupit er was established at both places, the Greeks calling him Zeus at Dodona and the Egyptians Ammon at Siwa. The Roman historian Silicus Italicus (first century A . D .), relating that Hannibal consulted the oracle at Siwa regarding his wars against Rome, also credited the flight of the two doves from Thebes wi th the establishment of the oracles in the Libyan desert (Siwa) and in Gree k Chaonia (Dodona). Several centuries later, the Greek poet Nonnos, in his master work Dionysiaca, described the oracle shrines at Siwa an d Dodona as twin sites, and held that the two were in voice communication w ith each other: Behold the new-found answering voice of the Libyan Zeus! The thirsty sands an oracular sent forth to the dove at Chaonia [= Dodona]. As far as F. L. Griffith was concerned, the discove ry of the omphalos in Nubia brought to mind another oracle center in Gree ce. The conical shape of the Nubian omphalos, he wrote, \"was precisely th at of the omphalos at the oracle at Delphi.\" Delphi, the site of Greece's most famous oracle, wa s dedicated to Apollo (\"He of Stone\"); its ruins are still one of Greece' s leading tourist attractions. There too, as at Baalbek, the sacred precinct consi sted of a platform shaped upon a mountainside, also facing a valley that open s up as a funnel toward the Mediterranean Sea and the lands on its other sh ores."},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"186 The Stairway to Heaven Many records establish that an omphalos stone was D elphi's holiest object. It was set into a special base in the inner sanctum of the temple of Apollo, some say next to a golden statue of the god and some say it was enshrined all by itself. In a subterranean chamber, hidden from view by the oracle seekers, the oracle priestess, in trance-lik e oblivion, answered the questions of kings and heroes by uttering enigmatic answers—answers given by the god but emanating from the omphalos. The original sacred omphalos had mysteriously disap peared, perhaps during the several sacred wars or foreign invasions which affected the place. But a stone replica thereof, erected perhaps in Rom an times outside the temple, was discovered in archaeological excavation s and is now on display in the Delphi Museum (Fig. 101). Along the Sacred Way leading up to the temple, some one, at some unknown time, also set up a simple stone omphalos i n an effort to mark the place where oracles were first given at Delphi, bef ore the temple was built. Fig. 101 The coins of Delphi depicted Apollo seated on this omphalos (Fig. 102); and after Phoenicia fell to the Greeks, they likewise d epicted Apollo seated upon the \"Assyrian\" omphalos. But just as frequentl y, the oracle stones were depicted as twin cones connected to each other via a common base, as in Fig. 99. How was Delphi chosen as a sacred oracle place, and how did the omphalos stone come to be there? The traditions say that when Zeus wanted to find the center of the Earth, he released eagles from two opposite ends of the world. Flying toward each other, they m et at Delphi; whereupon the place was marked by erecting there a navel stone, an omphalos. According to the Greek historian Strabo, images of two such eagles were perched on top of the omphalos at Delph i. Depictions of the omphalos have been found in Greek art, showing the two birds atop or at the sides (Fig. 102) of the co nical object.

According to Greek legends, Zeus found refuge at De lphi during his aerial battles with Typhon, resting on the platform -like area upon which the temple to Apollo was eventually built. The shrine t o Ammon at Siwa contained not only subterranean corridors, mysterio us tunnels and secret passages inside the temple's thick walls, but also a restricted area of some 180 by 170 feet, surrounded by a massive wall. In i ts midst, there arose a solid stone platform. We find the same structural c omponents, including a raised platform, in all the sites associated with t he \"stones that whisper.\" Is one to conclude, then, that as the far larger Baalb ek was, they too were both a Landing Place and a Communications Center? Not surprisingly, we find the twin Sacred Stones, a ccompanied by the two eagles, also depicted in Egyptian sacred writin gs (Fig. 103); and many centuries before the Greeks even began to enshrine their oracle centers, an Egyptian Pharaoh depicted an omphalos with the two perched birds in his pyramids.

To ask where he went to reach Tilmun, is to ask where Alexander went, deeming himself a Pharaoh and a god's son. It is to ask: Where on Earth was the Duat? Because all these destinations, we must conclude, w ere one and the same. 189"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"190 The Stairway to Heaven And the land where they hoped to find the Stairway to Heaven, we shall conclusively show, was the peninsula of Sinai. Accepting the possibility that the details given in the Book of the Dead may indeed refer to actual Egyptian geography, some scholars have suggested that the Pharaoh's simulated journey was along the Nile, from the shrines in Upper Egypt to those in Lower Egypt. The ancient texts, however, clearly speak of a journey beyond the boun daries of Egypt. The Pharaoh's direction is eastward, not northward; and as he crosses the Lake of Reeds and the desert beyond it, he leaves behind not only Egypt but also Africa: much is made of the perils—real and \"politi cal\"—of coming from the domains of Horus into the \"Lands of Seth,\" to Asia. When the Pyramid Texts were inscribed by the Pharao hs of the Old Kingdom, their capital in Egypt was Memphis. The re ligious center of old was Heliopolis, a short distance to the northeast o f Memphis. From these centers, a course eastward in fact led to a chain o f lakes full of reeds and rushes. Beyond lay the desert, and the mountain pas s, and the Sinai peninsula—the area whose skies had served as the fi nal battlefield between Horus and Seth, between Zeus and Typhon. The suggestion that the Pharaoh's journey to the Af terlife had indeed taken him to the Sinai peninsula is supported by th e fact that Alexander had emulated not only the Pharaohs; there was also a de liberate effort to emulate the Israelite Exodus from Egypt under the l eadership of Moses. As in the biblical tale, the starting point was Egy pt. Next came the \"Red Sea\"—the watery barrier whose waters parted so that the Israelites could cross upon the dry bed. In the histories of Alexand er, the watery barrier was also encountered, and it was persistently calle d the Red Sea. As in the tale of Exodus, Alexander too attempted to lead his army across the waters on foot: in one version by building a causeway; in another \"Alexander lay it bare by his prayers.\" Whether he succeeded or not ( depending on the version), enemy soldiers were drowned by the onrush ing waters—just as the Egyptians pursuing the Israelites had been drow ned. The journeying Israelites encountered and battled an enemy named t he Amalekites: in a Christian version of the Alexander histories, the e nemy destroyed \"by means of collecting the waters of the Red Sea and p ouring the waters over them\" were called \"Amalekites.\" Once across the waters—the literal translation of t he biblical term Yam Suff is \"Sea/Lake of Reeds\"—there began a journey i n a desert, toward a sacred mountain. Significantly, the landmark mounta in which Alexander reached was named Mushas—the Mountain of Moses, who se Hebrew name was Moshe. It was there that Moses encountered an a ngel who spoke to him out of a fire (the burning bush); a similar inciden t is described in the tales of Alexander. The double and triple parallels multiply, as we rec all the tale in the Koran of Moses and the fish. The location of the Wa ters of Life in the Koran tale about Moses was \"the junction of the two strea ms.\" It was where the"},{"pageNumber":192,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 191 stream of Osiris divided into two tributaries that the Pharaohs reached the entrance to the subterranean realm. In the tales of Alexander, it was at the junction of two subterranean streams that the cruci al point was reached, where the \"Stone of Adam\" emitted light, where Alex ander was advised by divine beings to turn back. And there was the tradition, also recorded in the M uslim Koran, equating Alexander with Moses by calling him \"He of the Two Horns\"— recalling the biblical statement that, after Moses had visited with the Lord upon Mount Sinai, his face radiated and emitted \"ho rns\" (literally: rays) of light. The arena for the biblical Exodus was the peninsula of Sinai. The conclusion from all the similarities and footstep-f ollowing can only be that it was toward the Sinai peninsula that Alexander, Mose s and the Pharaohs set their course as they went east from Egypt. This, we will show, was also the destination of Gilgamesh. To reach Tilmun on his second and decisive journey, Gilgamesh set sail in a \"Ship of Magan,\" a Ship of Egypt. Starting from M esopotamia, his only course was to sail down the Persian Gulf. Then, rou nding the Arabian peninsula, he would have entered the Red Sea (which the Egyptians called the Sea of Ur). As the name of his ship indicates, he would have sailed up the Red Sea toward Egypt. But his destination was n ot Egypt; it was Tilmun. Was he then intending to land on the wester n shores of the Red Sea—in Nubia? On the eastern shore—in Arabia? Or st raight ahead, on the peninsula of Sinai? (See map, Fig. 2.) Fortunately for our investigation, Gilgamesh had me t with a misfortune. His ship was sunk by a guarding god soon after he b egan his voyage. He was not too far gone from Sumer, for Enkidu (whose pres ence on the ship caused its sinking) pleaded that they make their wa y back, on foot, to Uruk. Resolved to reach Tilmun, Gilgamesh trekked instead overland to his chosen destination. Were his goal on the shores of the Red Sea, he would have cut across the Arabian peninsula. But instead he set his course to the northwest. We know that for a fact, because—having crossed a desert and passed desolate mountains—his first glimpse of civi lization was a \"low-lying sea.\" There was a city nearby, and an inn on its ou tskirts. The \"ale-woman\" warned him that the sea he saw and wished to cross was the \"Sea of the Waters of Death.\" Just as the Cedars of Lebanon had served as a uniqu e landmark for determining the first destination of Gilgamesh, so does the \"Sea of the Waters of Death\" serve as a unique clue to the wher eabouts of Gilgamesh on his second journey. Throughout the Near East, in all the lands of the ancient world, there is only one such body of water . It is so called to this very day: the Dead Sea. It is, indeed, a \"low-lying sea,\" being the lowest body of water on the face of Earth (1,300 feet belo w sea level). Its waters are so saturated with salts and minerals that it is totally devoid of all marine and plant life."},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"192 The Stairway to Heaven The city that overlooked the Sea of the Waters of D eath was surrounded by a wall. Its temple was dedicated to Sin, the Moo n-god. Outside the city there was an inn. The hostess took Gilgamesh in, ex tending to him hospitality, giving him information. The uncanny similarities to a known biblical tale c annot be missed. When the Israelites' forty years of wandering in the Wil derness had come to an end, it was time to enter Canaan. Coming from the S inai peninsula, they circled the Dead Sea on its eastern side until they reached the place where the Jordan River flows into the Dead Sea. When Mose s stood upon a hill overlooking the plain, he could see—as Gilgamesh ha d seen—the shimmer- ing waters of the \"low-lying sea.\" In the plain, on the other side of the Jordan, stood a city: Jericho. It blocked the Israe lites' advance into Canaan, and they sent two spies to explore its defenses. A woman whose inn was at the city's walls extended to them hospitality, gave them information and guidance. The Hebrew name for Jericho is Yeriho. It literally means \"Moon City\"— the city dedicated to the Moon god, Sin. . . . It was, we suggest, the very city reached by Gilgam esh fifteen centuries before the Exodus. Was Jericho already in existence circa 2900 B.C., w hen Gilgamesh was engaged in his searches? Archaeologists are agreed that Jericho has been inhabited since before 7000 B.C., and served as a f lourishing urban center since about 3500 B.C.; it was certainly there when Gilgamesh arrived. Refreshed and back to strength, Gilgamesh planned h is continued journey. Finding himself at the northern end of the Dead Sea, he inquired of the ale-woman whether he could sail across its w aters, rather than circle it overland. Were he to take the overland route, he would have taken the route which the Israelites eventually took—but in r everse; for Gilgamesh wished to go where the Israelites eventually came f rom. When the boatman Urshanabi finally ferried him over, he stepped asho re, we believe, at the southern end of the Dead Sea—as close to the Sinai peninsula as the boatman could have taken him. From there he was to follow \"a regular way\"—a route in common use by caravans—\"toward the Great Sea, which is far away.\" Again, the geography is recognizable from biblical terminology, for the Great Sea was the biblical name for the Mediterranean Sea. Journeying in the N egev, the dry southern region of Canaan, Gilgamesh was to go west ward for a certain distance, looking for \"two stone markers.\" There, U rshanabi told him, he was to make a turn and reach the town named Itla; i t was located some distance from the Great Sea. Beyond Itla, in the Fo urth Region of the gods, lay the restricted area. Was Itla a \"City of the Gods\" or a City of Men? The events there, described in a fragmented Hittite version of the Gilgamesh Epic, indicate that it was a place for bo th. It was a \"sanctified city,\" with various gods coming and going through i t or within easy reach of"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 193 it. But men too could go there: the way to it was i ndicated by road markers. Gilgamesh not only rested there, and changed into f resh clothing: he also obtained there the sheep which he daily offered as sacrifices to the gods. Such a city is known to us from the Old Testament. It was located where the south of Canaan merges into the Sinai peninsula , a gateway into the peninsula's Central Plain. Its sanctity was denoted by its name: Kadesh (\"The Sanctified\"); it was distinguished from a nor thern namesake (situated, significantly, on the approaches to Baalbek) by bei ng called Kadesh-Barnea (which, stemming from the Sumerian, could have mean t \"Kadesh of the Shiny Stone Pillars\"). In the Age of the Patriarchs , it was included in the domain of Abraham, who \"journeyed to the Negev, and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur.\" The city, by name and by function, is also known to us from the Canaanite tales of gods, men and the craving for Im mortality. Danel, we recall, asked the god El for a rightful heir, so th at his son could erect for him a commemorative stela at Kadesh. In another Uga ritic text we are told that a son of El named Shibani (\"The Seventh\"),—the biblical town of Beer- Sheba (\"The Well of the Seventh\") might have been n amed after him—was told to \"raise a commemorating (Pillar) in the dese rt of Kadesh.\" Indeed, both Charles Virolleaud and Bene Dussaud, w ho in the periodical Syria pioneered the translation and unde rstanding of the Ugaritic texts, concluded that the locale of the many epic t ales \"was the region between the Bed Sea and the Mediterranean,\" the Sin ai peninsula. The god Ba'al, who loved to fish in Lake Sumkhi, went for h is hunting to the \"desert of Alosh,\" an area associated (as in Fig. 104) with the date palm. As both Virolleaud and Dussaud have pointed out, this is a geographical clue connecting the Ugaritic locale with the biblical re cord of the Exodus: the Israelites, according to Numbers 33, journeyed from Marah (the place of bitter waters) and Elim (the oasis of date palms) t o Alosh. More details, placing El and the younger gods in th e same arena as that of the Exodus, are found in a text entitled by the scholars \"The Birth of the Gracious and Beautiful Gods.\" Its very opening vers es locate the action in the \"Desert of Suffim\"—unmistakably a desert border ing on the Yam Suff (\"Sea of Beeds\") of the Exodus: Fig. 104"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"194 The Stairway to Heaven I call the gracious and beautiful gods, sons of the Prince.

By and large they refer to the pantheon's head as \"El\"—the supreme, t he loftiest—a generic title rather than a personal name. But in the above quoted text El identifies himself as Yerah and his spouse as Nikhal. \"Yerah\" is the Semitic for \"Moon\"—the god better known as Sin; and \"Nikhal\" is a Semitic rendition of NIN.GAL, the Sumerian name for the spouse of the Moon-god. Scholars have advanced many theories regarding the origin of the peninsula's name Sinai. For once, the obvious reaso n—that, as the name stated, it \"Belonged to Sin\"—has been among the pre ferred solutions. We can see (in Fig. 72) that the Moon's crescent wa s the emblem of the deity in whose land the Winged Gateway was located. We find that the main crossroads in the central Sinai, the well-wate red place Nakhl, still bears the name of Sin's spouse. And we can confidently conclude that the \"Land Tilm un\" was the Sinai peninsula. An examination of the geography, topography, geolog y, climate, flora and history of the Sinai peninsula will affirm our iden tification, and clarify the Sinai's role in the affairs of gods and men. The Mesopotamian texts described Tilmun as situated at the \"mouth\" of two bodies of water. The Sinai peninsula, shaped as an inverted triangle indeed begins where the Red Sea separates into two arms—the Gulf of Suez on the west, and the Gulf of Elat (Gulf of Aqaba) o n the east. Indeed, when Egyptian depictions of the Land of Seth, where the Duat was, are turned around, they show schematically a peninsula with th e Sinai's features (Fig. 105). The texts spoke of \"mountainous Tilmun.\" The Sinai peninsula is indeed made up of a high mountainous southern part, a moun tainous central plateau, and a northern plain (surrounded by mounta ins), which levels off via sandy hills to the Mediterranean coastline. The coastal strip constituted a \"land-bridge\" between Asia and Africa from time i mmemorial. Egyptian Pharaohs used it to invade Canaan and Phoenicia and to challenge the Hittites. Sargon of Akkad claimed that he reached a nd \"washed his weapons\" in the Mediterranean; \"the sea lands\"—the lands along the Mediterranean coast—\"three times I encircled; Tilmu n my hand captured.\" Sargon II, king of Assyria in the eighth century B. C., asserted that he had conquered the area stretching \"from Bit-Yahkin on t he shore of the Salt Sea as far as the border of Tilmun.\" The name \"Salt Sea \" has survived to this day as a Hebrew name for the Dead Sea—another confi rmation that Tilmun lay in proximity to the Dead Sea."},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":" Fig. 105 Several Assyrian kings mention the Brook of Egypt a s a geographic landmark on their expeditions to Egypt. Sargon II l ists the Brook after describing the conquest of Ashdod, the Philistine c ity on the Mediterranean coast. Esarhaddon, who ruled somewhat later, boaste d thus: \"I trod upon Arza at the Brook of Egypt; I put Asuhili, its king , in fetters. . . . Upon Qanayah, king of Tilmun, I imposed tribute.\" The na me \"Brook of Egypt\" is identical to the biblical name for the large and ex tensive Sinai wadi (shallow river that runs with water only during the rainy season) now called Wadi El-Arish. Ashurbanipal, who followed Esarhaddo n on the throne of Assyria, claimed that he \"laid his yoke of overlord ship from Tyre, which is in the Upper Sea (Mediterranean) as far as Tilmun w hich is in the Lower Sea\" (the Red Sea). In all instances, the geography and topography of T ilmun fully match the Sinai peninsula. Except for annual variations, the peninsula's clima te in historical times is believed to have been the same as nowadays: an irre gular rainy season lasting from October through May; the rest of the y ear is completely dry. The meager rainfall qualifies the whole of Sinai to be defined as a desert (less than ten inches of rainfall per annum).

Typical to most of the peninsula are the wadis. In the south, the waters of the swift and short rainfalls drain off either east ward (to the Gulf of Elat) or (mostly) westward, into the Gulf of Suez. It is the re that most of the picturesque deep canyon-like wadis with flourishing oases are found. But the bulk of the peninsula's rainwater is drained no rthward into the Mediterranean Sea, via the extensive Wadi El-Arish and its myriad tributaries, that look on a map as the blood vessel s of a giant heart. In this part of the Sinai, the depths of the wadis that mak e up this network may change from a few inches to a few feet; the width—f rom a few feet to a mile and more after a sizeable rain. Even in the rainy season the rainfall pattern is to tally erratic. Sudden downpours alternate with long dry spells. An assump tion of plentiful water during the season or in its immediate aftermath cou ld thus be very misleading. This must have happened to the Israelit es as they left Egypt in mid-April and entered the Sinai Wilderness a few we eks later. Finding themselves without the expected waters, it required the intervention of the Lord twice, to show Moses where to strike the rocks for water. The Bedouin (local nomads), as other seasoned trave lers in the Sinai, can duplicate the miracle, if the soil making up the wa dis bed is right. The secret is that in many places the rocky bed lies ab ove a layer of clay soil that captures the water as it quickly seeps through the rocks. With knowledge and luck, a little digging in a completely dry wadi bed uncovers water only a few feet below the surface. Was this nomad art the great miracle performed by t he Lord? Recent discoveries in the Sinai throw a new light on the s ubject. Israeli hydrologists (associated with the Weizmann Institut e of Science) have discovered that, like parts of the Sahara Desert an d some deserts in Nubia, there is \"fossil water\"—the remains of prehistoric lakes from another geological era—deep under the central Sinai. The va st underground reservoir, with enough water (they estimated) to su ffice for a population as large as Israel's for almost one hundred years, ext ends for some 6,000 square miles in a wide belt that begins near the Su ez Canal and reaches under Israel's arid Negev. Though lying on the average some 3,000 feet below t he rocky ground, the water is sub-artesian and rises by its own pres sure to about 1,000 feet below ground. Egyptian experimental drillings for o il in the center of the northern plain (at Nakhl), have struck instead this water reservoir. Other drillings confirmed this incredible fact: above gro und—an arid wilderness; below, within easy reach of modern drilling and pum ping equipment—a lake of pure, sparkling water! Could the Nefilim, with their space-age technology, have missed this knowledge? Was this, rather than a little water in a dry wadi bed, the water that gushed forth after Moses had struck the rock, as indicated by the Lord?"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 197 Take in thy hand the staff with which you performed the miracles in Egypt, the Lord told Moses; you will see me standing upon a certain rock; strike that rock with the staff, \"and there shall come out of it water, and the people shall drink\"—enough water for a multitude of people and their livestock. So that the greatness of Yahweh be known , Moses was to take with him to the site some witnesses; and the miracl e took place \"before the eyes of the elders of Israel.\" A Sumerian tale concerning Tilmun relates an almost identical event. It is a tale of bad times caused by a shortage of water. Crops withered, cattle were not fed, animals went thirsty, the people fell silent. Ninsikilla, spouse of Tilmun's ruler Enshag, complained to her father Enki: The city which thou hast given . . . Tilmun, the city thou hast given . . . Has not waters of the river . . . Unbathed is the maiden; No sparkling water is poured in the city. Studying the problem, Enki concluded that the only solution would be to bring up subterranean waters. The depths must have been greater than what could be attained by digging a usual well. So Enki conceived a plan whereby the layers of rocks would be penetrated by a missile fired from the skies! Father Enki answered Ninsikilla, his daughter: \"Let divine Utu position himself in the skies. A missile let him tightly affix to his 'breast' and from high direct it toward the earth . . . From the source whence issues Earth's waters, let him bring thee sweet water from the earth.\" So instructed, Utu/Shamash proceeded to bring up wa ter from the subterranean sources: Utu, positioning himself in the skies, a missile tightly tied to his \"breast,\" From high directed it toward the earth . . . He let go of his missile from high in the sky. Through the crystal stones he brought up water; From the source whence issues Earth's waters he brought her sweet water, from the earth. Could a missile shot from the skies pierce the eart h and cause potable water to come up? Anticipating the incredulity of h is readers, the ancient scribe affirmed at the tale's end: \"Verily, it was so.\" The miracle, the text went on, did work: Tilmun became a land \"of crop ra ising fields and farms"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"198 The Stairway to Heaven which bear grain\"; and Tilmun-City \"became port cit y of the Land, the site of quays and mooring piers.\" The parallels between Tilmun and Sinai are thus dou bly affirmed: first, the existence of the subterranean water reservoir, below the rocky surface; secondly, the presence of Utu/Shamash (the Spacepor t's commander) in the proximity. The Sinai peninsula can also account for all the pr oducts for which Tilmun was renowned. Tilmun was a source of gemstones akin to the bluish lapis lazuli which the Sumerians cherished. It is an established fact that the Pharaohs of Egypt obtained the blue-green gemstone turquoise as well as a blue-green mineral (malachite) from the southwestern parts of the Sina i. The earliest turquoise mining area is now called Wadi Magharah—the Wadi of Caves; there, tunnels were cut into the rocky sides of the wadi's canyon and miners went in to chisel out the turquoise. Later on, mining al so took place at a site now named Serabit-el-Khadim. Egyptian inscriptions dati ng back to the Third Dynasty (2700-2600 B.C.) have been found at Wadi Ma gharah, and it is believed that it was then that the Egyptians began to station garrisons and occupy the mines on a continuing basis. Archaeological discoveries, as well as depictions b y the first Pharaohs of defeated and captured \"Asiatic Nomads\" (Fig. 106), convince scholars that at first the Egyptians only raided mines developed earlier by Semitic tribesmen. Indeed, the Egyptian name for turquoise, mafka-t (after which they called the Sinai the \"Land of Mafkat\"), stems from the Semitic verb meaning \"to mine, to extract by cutting.\" These min ing areas were in the domain of the goddess Hathor, who was known both as \"Lady of Sinai\" and Fig. 106"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 199 \"Lady of Mafkat.\" A great goddess of olden times, o ne of the early sky gods of the Egyptians, she was nicknamed by them \"The Co w\" and was depicted with cow's horns (see Figs. 7 and 106). Her name, Hat-Hor, spelled hieroglyphically by drawing a falcon within an encl osure , has been interpreted by scholars to mean \"House of Horus\" (H orus having been depicted as a falcon). But it literally meant \"Falc on House,\" which affirms our conclusions regarding the location and function s of the Land of the Missiles. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, \"turquoi se was obtained from the Sinai peninsula before the fourth millenni um B.C. in one of the world's first important hard-rock mining operations .\" At that time, the Sumerian civilization was only beginning to stir, a nd the Egyptian one was almost a millennium away. Who then could have organ ized the mining activities? The Egyptians said it was Thoth, the go d of sciences. In this and in the assignment of the Sinai to Hatho r, the Egyptians emulated Sumerian traditions. According to Sumerian texts, the god who organized the mining operations of the Anunnaki was Enki, the God of Knowledge; and Tilmun, the texts attested, was allo tted in pre-Diluvial times to Ninhursag, sister of Enki and Enlil. In he r youth, she was a smashing beauty and the chief nurse of the Nefilim. But in her old age, she was nicknamed \"The Cow\" and, as the Goddess of the Date Palm, was depicted with cow's horns (Fig. 107). The similarit ies between her and Hathor, and the analogies between their domains, ar e too obvious to require elaboration. The Sinai was also a major source of copper, and th e evidence here is that the Egyptians relied mostly on raiding expeditions to obtain it. To do this, they had to penetrate deeper into the peninsula; a Pharaoh of the Twelfth Dynasty (the time of Abraham) left us these com ments of his deeds: Fig. 107"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"200 The Stairway to Heaven \"Reaching the boundaries of the foreign lands with his feet; exploring the mysterious valleys, reaching the limits of the unkn own.\" He boasted that his men lost not a single case of the seized booty. Recent explorations in the Sinai by Israeli scienti sts found ample evidence showing that \"during the times of the Earl y Kingdom of Egypt, in the third millenium B.C., Sinai was densely inhabit ed by Semitic copper- smelting and turquoise-mining tribes, who resisted the penetration of Pharaonic expeditions into their territory (Beno Ro thenberg, Sinai Explora- tions 1967-1972). \"We could establish the existence of a fairly large industrial metallurgical enterprise. . . . There ar e copper mines, miners' camps and copper smelting installations, spread fro m the western parts of southern Sinai to as far east as Elat at the head o f the Gulf of Aqaba.\" Elat, known in Old Testament times as Etzion-Gaber, was indeed a \"Pittsburgh of the Ancient World.\" Some twenty year s ago, Nelson Glueck uncovered at Timna, just north of Elat, King Solomo n's copper mines. The ores were taken to Etzion-Gaber, where they were sm elted and refined in \"one of the largest, if not the largest, of metallu rgical centers in existence\" in ancient times (Rivers in the Desert). The archaeological evidence once again ties in with biblical and Meso- potamian texts. Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, boaste d that \"upon Qanayah, king of Tilmun, I imposed tribute.\" The Qenites are mentioned in the Old Testament as inhabitants of the southern Sinai, and their name literally meant \"smiths, metallurgists.\" The tribe into which Moses married when he escaped from Egypt into the Sinai was that of th e Qenites. R. J. Forbes (The Evolution of the Smith) pointed out that the b iblical term Qain (\"smith \") stemmed from the Sumerian KIN (\"fashione r\"). Pharaoh Ramses III, who reigned in the century foll owing the Exodus, recorded his invasion of these coppersmiths' dwelli ngs and the plundering of the metallurgical center of Timna-Elat: I destroyed the people of Seir, of the Tribes of th e Shasu, I plundered their tents, their people's possessions, their catt le likewise, without number. They were pinioned and brought as captive, as tribute of Egypt. I gave them to the gods, as slaves into their templ es. I sent forth my men to the Ancient Country, to the great copper mines which are in that place. Their galleys carried them ; others on a land- journey were upon their asses. It has not been hear d before, since the reign of the Pharaohs began. The mines were found abounding in copper; it was lo aded by ten- thousands into the galleys. They were sent forward to Egypt and arrived safely. It was carried and made into a heap under t he palace balcony, in many bars of copper, a hundred thousand, being of t he color of gold of three refinings. I allowed all the people to see them, like wonders."},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 201 It was to spend the rest of his life in the mines o f Tilmun that the gods had sentenced Enkidu; and so it was that Gilgamesh conceived the plan to charter a \"Ship of Egypt\" and take his comrade alon g—since the Land of Mines and the \"Land of Missiles\" were both parts of the same land. Our identification matches the ancient data. Before we continue with our reconstruction of histo ric and prehistoric events, it is important to buttress our conclusion that Tilmun was the Sumerian name for the Sinai peninsula. This is not what scholars have held until now; and we should analyze their contrary vie ws, and show why they have been wrong. A persistent school of thought, one of whose early advocates was P. B. Cornwall (On the Location of Tilmun), identifies Ti lmun (sometimes transcribed \"Dilmun\") as the island of Bahrein in t he Persian Gulf. This view relies most heavily on the inscription by Sarg on II of Assyria, wherein he asserted that among the kings paying him tribute was \"Uperi, king of Dilmun, whose abode is situated like a fish, thirty double-hours away, in the midst of the sea where the sun rises.\" This sta tement is taken to mean that Tilmun was an island; and the scholars who hol d this view identify the \"Sea where the sun rises\" as the Persian Gulf. They then end up with Bahrein as the answer. There are several flaws in this interpretation. Fir st, it could well be that only the capital city of Tilmun was on an offshore island: the texts leave no doubt that there was a land Tilmun and a Tilmun-cit y. Secondly, other Assyrian inscriptions which describe cities as bein g \"in the midst of the sea\" apply to coastal cities on a bay or a promontory, b ut not on an island (as, for instance, Arvad on the Mediterranean coast). Then, if the \"sea where the sun rises\" indicates a sea east of Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf does not qualify, since it lies to the south, not to the eas t, of Mesopotamia. Also, Bahrein lies too close to Mesopotamia to account fo r thirty double-hours of sailing. It is situated some 300 miles south of the Mesopotamian Gulf ports; in sixty hours of sailing, even at a leisurely pace , a distance many times greater could be covered. Another major problem arising from a Bahrein-Tilmun identification concerns the products for which Tilmun was renowned . Even in the days of Gilgamesh, not all of the Land Tilmun was a restric ted area. There was a part, as we have seen, where sentenced men toiled i n dark and dusty mines, digging out the copper and gemstones for whi ch Tilmun was famous. Long associated with Sumer in culture and trade, Ti lmun supplied it with certain desired species of woods. And its agricultu ral areas—subject of the above-mentioned tale of Ninsikilla's plea for artes ian waters—provided the ancient world with highly prized onions and dates. Bahrein had none of these, except for some \"ordinar y dates.\" So, to circumvent the problem, the pro-Bahrein school has developed a complex"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"202 The Stairway to Heaven answer. Geoffrey Bibby (Looking for Dilmun) and oth ers of like mind suggest that Bahrein was a trans-shipment point. Th e products, they agree, indeed came from some other, more distant land. But the ships which carried these goods did not go all the way to Sumer . They stopped and unloaded their goods at Bahrein, where the famous m erchants of Sumer picked them up for the final haul into Sumerian por ts; so that, when the Sumerian scribes wrote down where the goods had com e from (so this theory goes), they wrote down \"Dilmun,\" meaning Bah rein. But why would ships that have sailed great distance s fail to sail the final short distance to the actual destination in Mesopot amia, and instead go to the extra trouble and cost of offloading at Bahrein ? Also, this theory stands in direct contradiction to specific statements by r ulers of Sumer and Akkad that the ships of Tilmun, among ships from other la nds, anchored at their port cities. Ur-Nanshe, a king of Lagash some two c enturies after Gilgamesh was king of neighboring Uruk, claimed tha t \"the ships of Tilmun . . . brought me wood as tribute.\" We recognize the name Tilmun in his inscription (Fig. 108) by the pictograph for \"missi le.\" Sargon, the first ruler of Akkad, boasted that \"at the wharf of Akkad he ma de moor ships from Meluhha, ships from Magan and ships from Tilmun.\" Fig. 108 Clearly, then, the ships brought the products of Ti lmun straight to the Mesopotamian ports proper, as logic and economics w ould dictate. Like- wise, the ancient texts speak of direct exports fro m Mesopotamia to Tilmun. One inscription records a shipment of wheat, cheese and shelled barley from Lagash to Tilmun (circa 2500 B.C.); no trans-s hipment at an island is ever mentioned. One of the leading opponents of the Bahrein theory, Samuel N. Kramer (Dilmun, the \"Land of the Living\") stressed the fac t that the Mesopotamian texts described it as \"a distant land,\" reachable n ot without risk and adventure. These descriptions do not match a close- by island, reachable after an easy sailing down the quiet waters of the Persian Gulf. He also attached great importance to the fact that the vari ous Mesopotamian texts placed Tilmun near two bodies of water, rather than near or in a single sea. The Akkadian texts located Tilmun ina pi narati—\"at the mouth of the two flowing waters\": where two bodies of water begin. Guided by yet another statement, which said that Ti lmun was the land \"where the Sun rises,\" Kramer concluded, first, tha t Tilmun was a land and not an island; and secondly, that it must have been located east of Sumer,"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 203 for it is in the east that the Sun rises. Searching in the east for a place where two bodies of water meet, he could come up only wit h a southeastern point, where the Persian Gulf meets the Indian Ocean. Balu chistan, or some- where near the Indus River, were his suggestions. Kramer's own hesitation stemmed from the well-known fact that numer- ous Sumerian and Akkadian texts listing countries a nd peoples do not mention Tilmun in association with such eastern lan ds as Elam or Aratta. Instead, they lump together as lands situated next to each other Meluhha (Nubia/Ethiopia), Magan (Egypt) and Tilmun. The pro ximity between Egypt (Magan) and Tilmun is spelled out at the end of the \"Enki and Ninhursag\" text, where the appointment of Nintulla as \"Lord of Magan\" and of Enshag as \"Lord of Tilmun\" obtains the bless ing of the two gods. It is also evident from a remarkable text, written as an autobiography of Enki, which describes his activities after the Deluge, as sisting Mankind to establish its civilizations; again, Tilmun is liste d next to Magan and Meluhha: The lands of Magan and Tilmun looked up at me. I, Enki, moored the Tilmun-boat at the coast, Loaded the Magan-boat sky high. The joyous boat of Meluhha transports gold and silver. In view of this proximity of Tilmun to Egypt, what about the statements that Tilmun was \"where the sun rises\"—meaning (scho lars say) east of Sumer, and not west of it (as the Sinai is)? The simple answer is that the texts do not make tha t statement at all. They do not say \"where the Sun rises\"; they state \" where Shamash ascends\"—and that makes all the difference. Tilmun was not at all in the east; but it certainly was the place where Utu/Sham ash (the god whose celestial symbol was the Sun, and not the Sun itsel f) ascended skyward in his rocketships. The words of the Gilgamesh epic ar e quite clear: At the Mountain of Mashu he arrived, Where by day the Shems he watched as they depart and come in . . . Rocket-men guard its gate . . . they watch over Shamash as he ascends and descends. That, indeed was the place whereto Ziusudra had bee n taken: In the Land of the Crossing in mountainous Tilmun— the place where Shamash ascends— they caused him to dwell."},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"204 The Stairway to Heaven And so it was that Gilgamesh—denied permission to m ount a Shem, and seeking therefore only to converse with his ancesto r Ziusudra—set his steps to Mount Mashu in Tilmun—the Mount of Moshe (Moses) in the Sinai peninsula. Modern botanists have been amazed by the variety of the peninsula's flora, finding more than a thousand species of plants, man y unique to the Sinai, varying from tall trees to tiny shrubs. Where there is water—as in oases, or below the surface in the coastal sand dunes, or in the beds of the wadis— these trees and shrubs grow with impressive persist ence, having adapted themselves to the particular climate and hydrograph y of the Sinai. The Sinai's northeastern parts could well have been the source of the craved-for onions. Our name for the variety with th e long green stem, scallion, bears evidence to the port from which thi s delicacy was shipped to Europe: Ascalon on the Mediterranean coast, just no rth of the Brook of Egypt. One of the trees that adapted itself to the Sinai's unique circumstances is the acacia, which accommodates its high transpirati on rate by growing only in the wadi beds, where it exploits the subsurface moisture down to many feet. As a result, the tree can live for almost ten years without rain. It is a tree whose timber is a prized wood; according to th e Old Testament, the Holy Ark and other components of the Tabernacle wer e made of this wood. It could have well served as the prized wood which the kings of Sumer imported for their temples. An ever-present sight in the Sinai are the tamarisk s—bush-like trees that trace the wadi courses year round, for their roots reach down to the subsurface moisture and they can grow even where th e water is saline and brackish. After especially rainy winters, the tamar isk groves fill up with a sweet, granular white substance which is the excret ion of small insects that live on the tamarisks. The Bedouin call it by its b iblical name, manna, to this very day. The tree with which Tilmun was mostly associated in antiquity, however, was the date palm. It is still the Sinai's most imp ortant tree economically. Needing minimal cultivation, it provides the Bedoui n with fruit (dates); its pulp and kernels are fed to camels and goats; the t runk is used for building and as fuel; the branches for roofing; the fibers f or rope and weaving. We know from Mesopotamian records that these dates were also exported from Tilmun in antiquity. The dates were s o large and tasty that recipes for the meals of the gods of Uruk (the city of Gilgamesh) specified that \"every day of the year, for the four daily mea ls, 108 measures of ordinary dates, and dates of the Land Tilmun, as al so figs and raisins . . . shall be offered to the deities.\" The nearest and m ost ancient town on the land route from Sinai to Mesopotamia was Jericho. I ts biblical epithet was \"Jericho, the city of dates.\""},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"Tilmun: Land of the Rocketships 205 The date palm, we find, has been adopted as a symbo l in Near Eastern religions, i.e., in ancient concepts of Man and his gods. The biblical Psalmist promised that \"the Righteous like a date p alm shall flourish.\" The Prophet Ezekiel, in his vision of the rebuilt templ e of Jerusalem, saw it decorated with alternating \"Cherubim and date palms ... so that a date palm was between a Cherub and a Cherub, and two (da te palms) flank each Cherub.\" Residing at the time among the exiles whom the Babylonians had forcefully brought over from Judea, Ezekiel was wel l acquainted with the Mesopotamian depictions of the Cherubim and date pa lm theme (Fig. 109). Fig. 109 Alongside the Winged Disk (the emblem of the Twelft h Planet), the symbol most widely depicted by all the ancient nati ons was the Tree of Life. Writing in Der Alte Orient, Felix von Luschau has s hown back in 1912 that the Greek Ionian column capitals (Fig. 110a) as wel l as Egyptian ones (Fig. 110b) were in fact stylizations of the Tree of Life in the shape of a date palm (Fig. 110c), and confirmed earlier suggestions that the Fruit of Life of legend and epic tales was some special species of t he date fruit. We find the theme of the date palm as the symbol of Life carrie d on even in Muslim Egypt, as in the decorations of Cairo's grand mosqu e (Fig. 110d). Many major studies, such as De Boom des Levens en S chrift en Historie by Henrik Bergema and The King and the Tree of Life in Ancient Near Eastern Religion by Geo. Widengren, show that the c oncept of such a tree, growing in an Abode of the Gods, has spread from th e Near East all over Earth and has become a tenet of all religions, ever ywhere. The source of all these depictions and beliefs were the Sumerian records of the Land of the Living, Tilmun, Where old woman says not \"I am an old woman,\" Where old man says not \"I am an old man.\" The Sumerians, masters of word-plays, called the La nd of the Missiles TIL.MUN; yet the term could also mean \"Land Of Livi ng,\" for TIL also meant \"Life.\" The Tree of Life in Sumerian was GISH .TIL; but GISH also"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":" Fig. 110 meant a man-made, a manufactured object; so that GI SH.TIL could also mean \"The Vehicle to Life\"—a rocketship. In art too , we find the Eagle- men sometimes saluting not the date palm, but a roc ket (Fig. 60). The binding knots tighten further, as we find that in Greek religious art, the omphalos was associated with the date palm. An ancient Greek depiction of Delphi shows that the omphalos replica that was erected outside Apollo's temple was set up next to a date p alm (Fig. 111). Since no such trees grow in Greece, it was an artificial tre e made (scholars believe) of bronze. The association of the omphalos with the da te palm must have been a matter of basic symbolism, for these depictions w ere repeated also in respect to other Greek oracle centers. We have found earlier that the omphalos served as a link between Greek, Egyptian, Nubian and Canaanite \"oracle centers\" and the Duat. Now we find this \"Stone of Splendor\" linked to the date pa lm—the Tree of the Land of Living.

We have also seen (Fig. 72) that the Sumerian Gateway to Heaven was marked by the date palm. And we have no more doubt that the target of the an cient Search for Immortality was a Spaceport—somewhere in the Sinai peninsula.

The modern pilgrim, as pilgrims have done fo r centuries past, sets his course to the monastery of Santa Katarina (Fig- 113), so named after the martyred Katherine of Egypt whose body angels carri ed to the nearby peak bearing her name. After an overnight stay, at daybr eak, the pilgrims begin the climb to Gebel Mussa (\"Mount Moses\" in Arabic). It is tbe southern peak of a two mile massif rising south of the monas tery—the \"traditional\" Mount Sinai with which the Theophany and the Lawgiv ing are associated (Fig. 114). The climb to that peak is long and difficult, invol ving an ascent of some 2,500 feet. One path is by way of some 4,000 steps laid out by the monks along the western slopes of the massif. An easier w ay that takes several hours longer begins in the valley between the massi f and a mountain appropriately named after Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, and rises gradually along the eastern slopes until it connect s with the last 750 steps of the first path. It was at that intersection, accord ing to the monk's tradition, that Elijah encountered the Lord. A Christian chapel and a Muslim shrine, both small and crudely built, mark the spot where the Tablets of the Law were giv en to Moses. A cave nearby is revered as the \"cleft in the rock\" wherei n the Lord placed Moses as He passed by him, as related in Exodus 33:22. A well along the descent route is identified as the well from which Moses wa tered the flock of his father-in-law.

From the peak of Gebel Mussa, one can see some of t he other peaks which make up the granite heartland, of which this mount is a member. Surprisingly, it appears to be lower than many of i ts neighbors!

Studying Arabic and Musli m customs, he put a turban on his head, dressed as an Arab and changed his name to Ibrahim Ibn Abd Allah—Abraham the Son of Allah's Servant. H e was thus able to travel in parts hitherto forbidden to the infidels, discovering ancient Egyptian temples at Abu Simbel and the Nabatean roc k city of Petra in Transjordan. On April 15, 1816, he set out on camelback from the town of Suez, at the head of the Gulf of Suez. His goal was to retrace t he route of the Exodus, and thereby to establish the true identity of Mount Sinai. Following the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"212 The Stairway to Heaven presumed route taken by the Israelites, he traveled south along the western coast of the peninsula. There the mountains begin s ome ten to twenty miles away from the coast, creating a desolate coastal pl ain cut here and there by wadis and a couple of hot springs, including one fa vored by the Pharaohs. As he went south, Burckhardt noted the geography, t opography, distances. He compared conditions and place names w ith the descriptions and names of the stations of the Exodus as mentione d in the Bible. Where the limestone plateau ends, nature has provided a s andy belt which separates the plateau from a belt of Nubian sandsto ne, serving as a cross- Sinai avenue. There Burckhardt turned inland, and a fter a while set his course southward into the granite heartland, reachi ng the Katherine monastery from the north (as today's air traveler d oes). Some of his observations are of a lingering interes t. The area, he found, produced excellent dates; the monks had a tradition of sending large boxes of them as an annual tribute to the sultan in Const antinople. Befriending the area's Bedouins, they invited him to the annual feast in honor of \"St. George\"; they called him \"El Khidher\"—The Evergreen ! Burckhardt ascended mounts Mussa and Katherine and toured the area extensively. He was especially fascinated by Mount Umm Shutnar—a mere 180 feet shorter than Mount St. Katherine—which ris es somewhat south- west of the Mussa-Katherine group. From a distance, its top dazzled in the sun \"with the most brilliant white color,\" due to a n unusual inclusion of particles of mica in the granite rocks, forming \"a striking contrast with the blackened surface of the slate and the red granite\" of the mountain's lower parts and the surrounding area. The peak also had t he distinction of offering an unobstructed view to both the Gulf of Suez (\"el- Tor was distinctly visible\") and the Gulf of Aqaba (Gulf of Elat). Bur ckhardt found it mentioned in the convent's records, that Umm Shumar used to be a principal location of monastic settlements. In the fifteenth century, \"caravans of asses laden with corn and other provis ions passed by this place regularly from the convent to el-Tor, for this is t he nearest road to that harbor.\" His way back was via Wadi Feiran and its oasis—the largest in Sinai. Where the wadi leaves the mountains and reaches the coastal strip, Burckhardt climbed up a magnificent mountain rising over 6,800 feet— Mount Serbal, one of the tallest in the peninsula. There he found remains of shrines and pilgrims' inscriptions. Additional r esearch established that the main monastic center in Sinai, through most of the centuries, was at Wadi Feiran, near Serbal—and not at St. Katherine. When Burckhardt published his findings (Travels in Syria and the Holy Land), his conclusions shook the scholarly and bibl ical world. The true Mount Sinai, he stated, was not Mount Mussa, but Mo unt Serbal! Inspired by Burckhardt's writings, the French Count Leon de Laborde toured the Sinai in 1826 and 1828; his main contrib ution to the knowledge of the area (Commentaire sur L'Exode) were his fine maps and drawings."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Elusive Mount 213 He was followed in 1839 by the Scottish artist Davi d Roberts; his magnificent drawings, wherein he embellished accura cy with some imag- inative flair, aroused great interest in an era bef ore photography. The next major journey to Sinai was undertaken by t he American Edward Robinson, together with Eli Smith. Like Burckhardt, they left Suez City on camelback, armed with his book and de Laborde's map s. It took them thirteen early spring days to reach St. Katherine. There, Robinson gave the monks' legends a thoroughgoing examination. He foun d out that at Feiran there indeed was a superior monastic community, som etimes led by full bishops, to which Katherine and several other monas tic communities in southern Sinai were subordinate; so that tradition must have placed greater emphasis on Feiran. In the tales and documents, he discovered that mounts Mussa and Katherine were of no Christian consequenc e in the early Christian centuries, and that Katherine's supremacy developed only in the seventeenth century, when the other unfortified mon astic communities fell prey to invaders and marauders. Checking local Arab traditions, he found that the biblical names \"Sinai\" and \"Horeb\" were to tally unknown to the local Bedouins; it was the Katherine monks who bega n to apply these names to certain mountains. Was Burckhardt, then, right? Robinson (Biblical Res earches in Palestine, Mount Sinai and Arabia Petraea) found a problem wit h the route by which Burckhardt had the Israelites reach Serbal, and the refore refrained from endorsing the new idea; but he shared the doubts re garding Mount Mussa, and pointed at another nearby mountain as a better choice. The possibility that the long-held tradition identi fying Mount Sinai with Mount Mussa was incorrect was a challenge that the great Egyptologist and founder of scientific archaeology, Karl Richard Lep sius, could not resist. He crossed the Gulf of Suez by boat, landing at el-Tor (\"The Bull\")—the harbor town where Christian pilgrims to St. Katherine and Mount Moses used to land even before the Muslims made it a major stopov er and decontamina- tion center on the sea route from Egypt to Mecca. N earby rose the majestic- Mount Umm-Shumar, which Lepsius on and off compared as a \"candidate\" with Mussa and Serbal. But after extensive research and area touring, he focused on the burning problem of that day: Mussa o r Serbal? His findings were published in Discoveries in Egypt , Ethiopia and the Peninsula of Sinai 1842-1845 and Letters from Egypt , Ethiopia and Sinai, the latter including (in translation from German), the full text of his reports to the king of Prussia, under whose patronage he tr aveled. Lepsius voiced doubts regarding Mount Mussa almost as soon as he r eached the area: \"The remoteness of that district, its distance from freq uented roads of communi- cation and its position in the lofty range,\" he wro te, \". . . rendered it peculiarly applicable for individual hermits; but f or the same reason inapplicable for a large people.\" He felt certain t hat the hundreds of thousands of Israelites could not have subsisted am ong the desolate granite peaks of Mount Mussa for the long (almost a year) I sraelite stay at Mount"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"214 The Stairway to Heaven Sinai. The monastic traditions, he confirmed, dated to the sixth century A . D . at the earliest; they could therefore serve as no g uide in this quest. Mount Sinai, he stressed, was in a desert plain; it was also called in the Scriptures Mount Horeb, the Mount of the Dryness. M ussa was amidst other mountains and not in a desert area. On the ot her hand, the coastal plain in front of Mount Serbal was such an area—lar ge enough to hold the Israelite multitudes as they viewed the Theophany; and the adjoining Wadi Feiran was the only place that could sustain them a nd their cattle for a year. Moreover, only possession of \"this unique fertile v alley\" could have justified the Amalekite attack (at Rephidim, a gate way place near Mount Sinai); there was no such fertile place, worth figh ting for, near Mount Mussa. Moses first came to the mount in search of g razing for his flock; this he could find at Feiran, but not at the desolate Mo unt Mussa. But if not Mount Mussa, why Mount Serbal? Besides i ts \"correct\" location at Wadi Feiran, Lepsius found some concret e evidence. Describ- ing the mount in glowing terms, he reported finding on its top \"A deep mountain hollow, around which the five summits of S erbal unite in a half circle and form a towering crown.\" In the middle of this hollow he found ruins of an old convent. It was at that hallowed sp ot, he suggested, that the \"Glory of the Lord\" had landed, in full view of the Israelites (who were gathered in the plain to the west). As to the fault that Robinson had found with Burckhardt's Exodus route to Serbal—Lepsius of fered an alternative detour which corrected the problem. When the conclusions of the prestigious Lepsius wer e published, they shook tradition in two ways: he emphatically denied the identification of Mount Sinai with Mount Mussa, voting for Serbal; an d he challenged the Exodus route previously taken for granted. The debate that followed raged for almost a quarter of a century and produced discourses by other researchers, notably C harles Foster (The Historical Geography of Arabia; Israel in the Wilde rness) and William H. Bartlett (Forty Days in the Desert on the Track of the Israelites). They added suggestions, confirmations and doubts. In 186 8 the British govern- ment joined the Palestine Exploration Fund in sendi ng a full-scale expedition to Sinai. Its mission, in addition to ex tensive geodesic and mapping work, was to establish once and for all the route of the Exodus and the location of Mount Sinai. The group was led by c aptains Charles W. Wilson and Henry Spencer Palmer of the Royal Engine ers; it included Professor Edward Henry Palmer, a noted Orientalist and Arabist. The expedition's official report (Ordnance Survey of th e Peninsula of Sinai) was enlarged upon by the two Palmers, in separate works . Previous researchers went to the Sinai for brief to urs mostly in springtime. The Wilson-Palmer expedition departed f rom Suez on Novem- ber 11, 1868, and returned to Egypt on April 24, 18 69—staying in the peninsula from the beginning of winter until the fo llowing spring. Thus, one of its first discoveries was that the mountaino us south gets very cold in"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Elusive Mount 215 winter and that it snows there, making passage diff icult, if not impossible. The higher peaks, such as Mussa and Katherine, rema in snowcovered for many winter months. The Israelites—who had never se en snow in Egypt— had stayed a year in this area. Yet there is no men tion at all in the Bible of either snow or even cold weather. While Captain Palmer (Sinai: Ancient History from t he Monuments) provided data on the archaeological and historical evidence uncovered (early habitations, Egyptian presence, inscriptions in the first known alphabet), it was the task of Professor E. H. Palme r (The Desert of the Exodus) to outline the group's conclusions regardin g the route and the mount. In spite of lingering doubts, the group vetoed Serb al and voted for the Mount Mussa location, but with a twist. Since in fr ont of Mount Mussa there was no valley wide enough where the Israelite s could encamp and see the Theophany, Palmer offered a solution: The corre ct Mount Sinai was not the southern peak of the massif (Gebel Mussa), but its northern peak, Ras- Sufsafeh, which faces \"the spacious plain of Er-Rah ah where no less than two million Israelites could encamp.\" In spite of t he long-held tradition, he concluded, \"we are compelled to reject\" Gebel Mussa as the Mount of the Lawgiving. The views of Professor Palmer were soon criticized, supported or modified by other scholars. Before long, there were several southern peaks that were offered as the true Mount Sinai, as well as several different routes to choose from. But was the southern Sinai the only place in which to search? Back in April 1860, the Journal of Sacred Literatur e published a revolutionary suggestion, that the Holy Mount was n ot in southern Sinai at all, but should be looked for in the central platea u. The anonymous contributor pointed out that its name, Badiyeth el- Tih, was very significant: it meant \"the Wilderness of the Wandering,\" and the local Bedouins explain that it was there that the Children of Isra el wandered. The article suggested a certain peak of the el-Tih as the prope r Mount Sinai. So, in 1873, a geographer and linguist named Charle s T. Beke (who explored and mapped the origins of the Nile) set ou t \"in search of the true Mount Sinai.\" His research established that Mount M ussa was so named after a fourth century monk Mussa who was famed for his piety and miracles, and not after the biblical Moses; and tha t the claims for Mount Mussa were begun only circa A . D . 550. He also pointed out that the Jewish historian Josephus Flavius (who recorded his people 's history for the Romans after the fall of Jerusalem in A . D . 70) described Mount Sinai as the highest in its area, which ruled out both Mussa and Serbal. Beke also asked, how could the Israelites have gone south at all, past the Egyptian garrisons in the mining areas? His questio n has remained one of the unanswered objections to a southern location of Mount Sinai. Charles Beke will not be remembered as the man who finally found the"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"216 The Stairway to Heaven true Mount Sinai: as the title of his work indicate d (Discoveries of Sinai in Arabia and Midian), he concluded that the mount was a volcano, somewhere southeast of the Dead Sea. But he raised many questions which cleared the desk for fresh and unfettered thinking regarding the location of the mount and the route of the Exodus. The search for Mount Sinai in the southern part of the peninsula was closely linked with the notion of the \"Southern Crossing\" a nd \"Southern Route\" of the Exodus. These held that the Children of Israel literally crossed the Red Sea (from west to east) at or through the head of t he Gulf of Suez. Once across, they were out of Egypt and on the western s hores of the Sinai peninsula. They then journeyed south along the coas tal strip, turned (somewhere) inland, and reached Mount Sinai (as, sa y, Burckhardt had done). The Southern Crossing was indeed a deep-rooted and plausible tradition, buttressed by several legends. According to Greek s ources, Alexander the Great was told that the Israelites had crossed the Red Sea at the head of the Gulf of Suez; it was there that he tried to emulate the Crossing. The next great conqueror known to have attempted th e feat was NaDoleon, in 1799. His engineers established that w here the head of the Gulf of Suez sends a \"tongue\" inland, south of wher e Suez City is located, there exists an underwater ridge, some 600 feet wid e, which extends from coast to coast. Daredevil natives cross there at eb b tide, with the waters up to their shoulders. And if a strong east wind blows , the seabed is almost cleared of all water. Napoleon's engineers worked out for their emperor t he right place and time for emulating the Children of Israel. But an u nexpected change in the wind's direction brought a sudden onrush of waters, covering the ridge with more than seven feet of water within minutes. The g reat Napoleon escaped witb his life in the nick of time. These experiences only served to convince nineteent h century scholars that it was indeed at that end of the Gulf of Suez that the miraculous Crossing had taken place: a wind could create a dry path, and a change in wind could indeed sink an army soon thereafter. On the opposite, Sinai, side of the Gulf, there was a place named Gebel Mur r (\"The Bitter Mountain\") and near it Bir Murr (\"The Bitter Well\") , invitingly fitting as Marah, the place of bitter waters, encountered by t he Israelites after the Crossing. Further south lay the oasis of Ayun Mussa —\"The Spring of Moses\"; now was not this the next station, Elim, re membered for its beautiful springs and numerous date palms? The Sout hern Crossing thus seemed to fit well with the Southern Route theory, no matter where the turn inland had taken place further on. The Southern Crossing also agreed with the then cur rent notions regarding Egypt in antiquity and the Israelite bond age therein. Egypt's historical heart was the Heliopolis-Memphis hub, an d it was assumed that"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Elusive Mount 217 the Israelites slaved in the construction of the ne arby pyramids of Gizeh. From there, a route led almost straight east, towar d the head of the Gulf of Suez and the Sinai peninsula beyond it. But as archaeological discoveries began to fill in the historical picture and provide an accurate chronology, it was established that the great pyramids were built some fifteen centuries before the Exodus —more than a thousand years before the Hebrews even came to Egypt. The Is raelites, more and more scholars agreed, must have toiled in the const ruction of a new capital which the Pharaoh Ramses II had built circa 1260 B. C. It was named Tanis and it was located in the northeastern part of the Delta. The Israelite abode—the land of Goshen—was consequently presumed to have been in the northeast rather near the center of Egypt. The construction of the Suez Canal (1859-1869), whi ch was accompanied by the accumulation of topographical, geological, c limatic and other data, confirmed the existence of a natural rift which in an earlier geological age may have joined the Mediterranean Sea in the north with the Gulf of Suez in the south. That link had shrunk for various reas ons, leaving behind a watery chain consisting of the marshy lagoons of La ke Manzaleh, the small lakes Ballah and Timsah, and the joined Great and L ittle Bitter Lakes. All these lakes may have been larger at the time of the Exodus, when the head of the Gulf of Suez probably extended farther inlan d. Archaeological work complementing the engineering d ata also estab- lished that there existed in antiquity two \"Suez Ca nals,\" one connecting Egypt's hub with the Mediterranean and the other to the Gulf of Suez. Following natural wadi beds or dried up branches of the Nile, they carried \"sweet\" water for drinking and irrigation and were navigable. The finds confirmed that in earlier times there was indeed an almost continuous water barrier which served as Egypt's eastern border. The engineers of the Suez Canal prepared in 1867 th e following diagram (Fig. 116) of a north-south section of the Isthmus, identifying four ridges of high ground which must have served in antiquity, as they still do, the gateways to and from Egypt through the watery barri er (Fig. 115): (A) Between the marshy lagoons of Manzaleh and Lake Bal lah—the modern crossing town of el-Qantara (\"The Span\"). (B) Between Lake Ballah and Lake Timsah—the modern cros sing point of Ismailiya. (C) Between Lake Timsah and the Great Bitter Lake—a rid ge known in Greek-Roman times as the Serapeum. (D) Between the Little Bitter Lake and the head of the Gulf of Suez—a \"land-bridge\" known as The Shalouf. Through these Gateways, a number of Routes connecte d Egypt with Asia via the Sinai peninsula.

DeLesseps, the Canal's master builder, voiced the o pinion that they used Gateway \"C,\" south of Lake Timsah. Others, like Oli vier Ritter (Histoire de l'Isthme de Suez), concluded from the exact same da ta that it was Gateway \"D.\" In 1874, the Egyptologist Heinrich Karl Rrugsc h, addressing the International Congress of Orientalists, identified the landmarks connected with the Israelite enslavement and Exodus in the no rtheastern corner of Egypt. Therefore, he said, the logical gateway was all the way north— Gateway \"A.\" As it turned out, such a theory of a Northern Cross ing was nearly a century old when Brugsch launched it, having been s uggested in Hamelneld's Biblical Geography back in 1796, and by various researchers thereafter. But Brugsch, as even his adversaries co nceded, presented the theory with a \"really brilliant and dazzling array of claimed corroboratory evidence from the Egyptian monuments.\" His paper wa s published the following year under the title L'Exode et les Monum ents Egyptiens. In 1883, Edouard H. Naville (The Store City of Pith om and the Route of the Exodus) identified Pithom, the Israelite slave- labor city, at a site west of Lake Timsah. This and other identifications and evi dence offered by others (such as by George Ebers in Durch Gosen zum Sinai) established that the Israelite abode extended from Lake Timsah westward, not northward. Goshen was not in the extreme northeast of Egypt, b ut adjoined the center of the watery barrier. H. Clay Trumbull (Kadesh Barnea) then offered what has since been generally accepted as the correct identification fo r Succoth, the starting point of the Exodus: it was a common caravan gather ing place west of Lake Timsah, and Gateway \"B\" was the nearest at hand. Bu t it was not taken, as stated in Exodus 13:17-18: \"And it came to pass, wh en Pharaoh let the people go, that the Lord did not lead them the Way of the Land of the Philistines, though it was near . . . and the Lord turned the people by the Way of the Desert Yam Suff.\" Thus, Trumbull suggest ed, the Israelites 218 The Stairway to Heaven"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Elusive Mount 219 ended up at Gateway \"D\"; pursued by the Pharaoh, th ey crossed through the waters of the head of the Gulf of Suez. As the nineteenth century drew to a close, scholars raced to give the final word on the subject. The views of the \"southerners\" were emphatically summed up by Samuel C. Bartlett (The Veracity of th e Hexateuch): the Crossing was in the south, the Route led south, Mou nt Sinai was in the south of the peninsula (Ras-Sufsafeh). With equal d ecisiveness, such scholars as Rudolf Kittel (Geschichte der Hebraer), Julius Wellhausen (Israel und Judah), and Anton Jerku (Geschichte des Volkes Israel) offered the opinion that the Northern Crossing meant a nort hern Mount Sinai. One of their strongest arguments (now generally acc epted by scholars) was that Kadesh-Barnea, where the Israelites sojour ned for most of their forty years in the peninsula, was not a chance stat ion but a premeditated target of the Exodus. It has been firmly identified as the fertile area of the Ain-Kadeis (\"Spring of Kadesh\") and Ain-Qudeirat oa ses in northeastern Sinai. According to Deuteronomy 1:2, Kadesh-Barnea was situated \"eleven days\" from Mount Sinai. Kittel, Jerku and others of like opinion therefore selected mountains in the vicinity of Kadesh-Barnea as the true Mount Sinai. In the last year of the nineteenth century, H. Holz inger (Exodus) offered a compromise: the Crossing was at \"C\"; the Route le d south. But the Israelites turned inland well before reaching the E gyptian-garrisoned mining areas. Their route led via the highland plat eau of the el-Tih, the \"Wilderness of the Wandering.\" They then circled no rthward through the flat Central Plain, toward a Mount Sinai in the nor th. As the twentieth century began, the focus of resear ch and debate shifted to the question: What was the route of the Exodus? The ancient coastal route, which the Romans called Via Maris—\"Way of the Sea\"—began at el-Qantara (\"A\" on map). Though i t led through shifting sand dunes, it was blessed with water wells all alo ng its course, and the date palms amazingly growing out of the barren sands pro vide sweet fruit in season and welcome shade all year round. The second route, beginning at Ismailiya (\"B\"), run s almost parallel to the coastal road but some twenty to thirty miles so uth of it, through undulating hills and occasional low mountains. The natural wells are sparse, and the subterranean water level lies deep below th e sand and sandstones: artificial wells must be dug several hundred feet t o reach water. A traveler—even nowadays, even by car (the paved high ways follow the ancient paths)—soon realizes that he is in a real d esert. From earliest times, the Way of the Sea was preferr ed by armies that had naval support; the more inland route—harsher though it was—was taken by those who sought to be safe from (or unseen by) the naval and coastal patrols. Gateway \"C\" could lead either to Route \"B,\" or to t he twin routes which"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"220 The Stairway to Heaven extended from Gateway \"D\" through a mountain chain into the Sinai's Central Plain. The hard, flat ground of the Central Plain does not allow deep wadi beds. During the winter rains, some wadis overfill and give the appearance of small lakes—lakes in the desert! The waters soon flow off, but some filter down through the gravel and clay that m ake up the wadi beds; it is there that digging can literally bring water out of the ground. The more northerly route extending from Gateway \"D\" led the traveler via the Giddi Pass, past the northern mountainous r im of the Central Plain, on to Beersheba, Hebron and Jerusalem. The more sou therly route, via the Mitla Pass, bears the Arabic name Darb el Hajj—\"Way of the Pilgrims.\" This route was the early way for Muslim pilgrims fr om Egypt to the holy city of Mecca in Arabia. Starting near Suez City, t hey crossed a desert strip and went through the mountains via the Mitla Pass; then journeyed across the Central Plain to the oasis of Nakhl (Fig. 117) where a fort, pilgrims' inns and water pools had been built. From there they con tinued southeast to reach Aqaba at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba, whenc e they moved along the Arabian coast to Mecca. Which of these four possible routes—the \"Ways\" of t he Bible—had the Israelites taken? In the aftermath of the Northern Crossing presentat ion by Brugsch, much was made of the biblical statement regarding t he \"Way of the Land of the Philistines\" which was not taken, \"though it wa s near.\" The Bible continued the statement with the following explanat ion: \"For the Lord said: 'Lest the people repent when they see war, and retu rn to Egypt.'\" It has been assumed that this \"Way of the Land of the Phil istines\" was the coastal route (which began at gateway \"A\"), the way the Pha raohs preferred for their military and trade expeditions, and which was strung with Egyptian forts and garrisons. At the turn of the century, A. E. Haynes, a captain in the Royal Engineers, studied Sinai's routes and water resourc es under the auspices of the Palestine Exploration Fund. In his published re port on \"The Route of the Exodus\" he revealed impressive familiarity not only with biblical scriptures, but also with the work of previous rese archers, including the Rev. F. W. Holland (who visited the Sinai five time s) and Major-General Sir C. Warren (who paid particular attention to wat er supplies in the \"Wilderness of the Wandering\" of the Central Plain) . Captain Haynes focused on the problem of the Route- That-Was-Not- Taken. Unless it was a handy and obvious way for re aching the Israelite's goals—why was it mentioned at all as a viable alter native? He pointed out that Kadesh-Barnea—by then accepted as a premeditat ed goal of the Exodus—indeed lay within easy reach of the coastal route. Therefore, he concluded, Mount Sinai, situated on the way to Kade sh, also had to be located within easy reach of the coastal route, whe ther or not this route was finally taken. Barred from the coastal Route \"A,\" Captain Haynes c oncluded, it was"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":" Fig. 117 \"the probable plan of Moses\" to lead the Israelites directly to Kadesh, with a stop at Mount Sinai, via Route \"B.\" But the Egypt ian pursuit and the Crossing of the Red Sea may have forced a detour vi a routes \"C\" or \"D.\" The Central Plain was indeed the \"Wilderness of Wan dering.\" Nakhl was an important station near Mount Sinai, before or af ter reaching it. The mount itself had to be located about 100 miles from Kadesh-Barnea, which equals (Captain Haynes estimated) the biblical dist ance of \"eleven days.\" His candidate was Mount Yiallaq, a limestone mounta in \"of most impres- sive dimensions, lying like a huge barnacle\" on the northern rim of the Central Plain—\"exactly halfway between Ismailiyah a nd Kadesh.\" Its name, which he spelled Yalek, \"approximates closely to th e ancient Amalek, the prefix Am meaning 'country of.'\" In the years that followed, the possibility of an I sraelite journey via the Central Plain gained supporters; some (as Raymond W eill, Le Sijour des Israelites au desert du Sinai) accepted the Mount-n ear-Kadesh theory; others (as Hugo Gressmann, Mose and seine Zeit) bel ieved that the Israelites turned from Nakhl not northeast but sout heast, toward Aqaba. Others—Black, Buhl, Cheyne, Dillmann, Gardiner, Gra tz, Guthe, Meyer, Musil, Petrie, Sayce, Stade—agreed or disagreed par tly or completely. As all the scriptural and geographical arguments were exhausted, it seemed that only an actual field test could resolve the is sue. But how does one duplicate the Exodus? World War I (1914-1918) was the answer, for the Sin ai soon became the arena of a major struggle between the British on th e one hand and the Turks and their German allies on the other hand. Th e prize of these campaigns was the Suez Canal. The Turks lost no time in crossing into the Sinai p eninsula, and the British quickly withdrew from their main administra tive-military centers at El-Arish and Nakhl. Unable to advance by the desira ble \"Way of the Sea,\" for the same old reason that the Mediterranean was controlled by the enemy's (British) navy, the Turks amassed a herd of 20,000 camels to carry water and supplies for an advance on the Canal via route \"B\" to Ismailiyah. In his memoirs, the Turkish Commander, Djemal Pasha (Memories of a"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"222 The Stairway to Heaven Turkish Statesman, 1913-1919) explained that \"the g reat problem, on which everything hangs in these difficult military operations in the desert of Sinai, is the question of water.

The German allies of the Turks then took matters in hand. For their motorized equipment, they preferred the hard, flat Central Plain for an advance on the Canal. With the aid of water enginee rs, they discovered the subterranean resources and dug a network of wells a ll along their lines of communication and advance. Their attack in 1916 als o failed. When the British took the offensive in 1917, they naturally advanced along the coastal route. They reached the old demarcation line at Raf ah in February 1917; within months they captured Jerusalem. The British memoirs on the Sinai fighting by Genera l A. P. Wavell (The Palestine Campaigns) has a bearing on our subject p rimarily by his admission that the British High Command estimated t hat their enemies could not find in the Central Plain water for more than 5,000 men and 2,500 camels. The German side of the Sinai campaigns is t old in Sinai by Theodor Wiegand and the commanding general, F. Kress von Kr essenstein. The military endeavor is described against the backgrou nd of terrain, climate, water sources and history, coupled with an impressi ve familiarity with all previous research. Not surprisingly, the conclusion s of the German military men parallel the conclusions of the British militar y men: no marching columns, no multitudes of men and beasts could be l ed through the southern granite mountains. Devoting a special chap ter to the question of the Exodus, Wiegand and von Kressenstein asserted t hat \"the region of Gebel Mussa cannot come into consideration for the biblical Mount Sinai.\" They were of the opinion that it was \"the monumenta l Gebel Yallek\"— echoing the conclusions of Captain Haynes. Or, they added, perhaps as Guthe and other German scholars have suggested, Geb el Maghara, which rises opposite Gebel Yallek, on the northern side o f Route \"B.\" One of Britain's own military men, who was governor of the Sinai after World War I, became acquainted with the peninsula d uring his long tenure there as perhaps no single person in modern times u ntil then. Writing in Yesterday and Today in Sinai, C. S. Jarvis too asse rted that there was no way the Israelite multitudes (even if their numbers were smaller than 600,000, as W.M.F. Petrie had suggested) and their livestock could have traveled through—much less sustained themselves for more than a year—in the \"tumbled mass of pure granite\" of the southern Sinai. To the known arguments, he added new ones. It had a lready been suggested that the manna which served in lieu of br ead was the edible, white, berry-like resinous deposit left by small in sects that feed on the tamarisk bushes. There are few tamarisks in souther n Sinai; they are plentiful in northern Sinai. Next fact concerned th e quails, which provided the meat to eat. These birds migrate from their nat ive southern Russia,"},{"pageNumber":224,"pageContent":"The Elusive Mount 223 Rumania and Hungary to winter in the Sudan (south o f Egypt); they return northward in the spring. To this day, the Bedouins easily catch the tired birds as they alight on the Mediterranean coast aft er long flights. The quails do not come to the southern Sinai; and if they did, they could not possibly fly over the high peaks of that area. The whole drama of the Exodus, Jarvis insisted, was played out in the northern Sinai. The \"Sea of Reeds\" was the Serbonic Sealet (Sebkhet el Bardawil in Arabic) from which the Israelites march ed south-southeast. Mount Sinai was Gebel Hallal—\"a most imposing limes tone massif over 2,000 feet high and standing in the midst of a vast alluvial plain all by itself.\" The mountain's Arabic name, he explained, meant \"Th e Lawful\"—as befits the Mount of the Lawgiving. In the years that followed, the most pertinent rese arch on the subject was conducted by scholars of the Hebrew University of J erusalem and other Hebrew institutions of higher learning in what was then Palestine. Combining their intimate knowledge of the Hebrew Bi ble and other scriptures with thorough on-site investigations in the peninsula, few found support for the southern location tradition. Haim Bar-Deroma (Hanagev and Vze Gvul Ha'aretz) acc epted a North- ern Passage but believed that the Route then took t he Israelites south, through the Central Plain, to a volcanic Mount Sina i in Transjordan. Three noted scholars—F. A. Theilhaber, J. Szapiro and Ben jamin Maisler (The Graphic Historical Atlas of Palestine: Israel in Bi blical Times)—accepted the Northern Passage via the shoal of the Serbonic Sea. El-Arish, they said, was the verdant oasis of Elim; Mount Hallal was Mou nt Sinai. Benjamin Mazar, in various writings and in Atlas Litkufat Ha tanach, adopted the same position. Zev Vilnay, a biblical scholar who h iked in Palestine and Sinai literally from end to end (Ha'aretz Bamikra), opted for the same route and mount. Yohanan Aharoni (The Land of Israel in B iblical Times), accepting the possibility of a Northern Passage, be lieved that the Israelites journeyed toward Nakhl in the Central Plain; but th en proceeded to a Mount Sinai in the south. As the debate continued to engross the scholarly an d biblical world, it became apparent that the basic unresolved issue was this: Insofar as the Crossing was concerned, the weight of the evidence negated a northern body of water; but insofar as Mount Sinai was conce rned, the weight of the evidence negated a southern location. The impasse f ocused the attention of scholars and explorers on the only remaining compro mise: the Central Plain of the Sinai peninsula. In the 1940s, M. D. Cassuto (Commentary on the Book of Exodus and other writings) facilitated acce ptance of the central route idea by showing that the Route-Not-Taken (\"Th e Way of the Land of the Philistines\") was not the long-held sea route, but the more inland route \"B.\" Therefore, a Crossing via Gateway \"C\" leading southeast to the Central Plain was in full accord with the biblical narrative—without requiring a continued journey to the south of the p eninsula."},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224 The Stairway to Heaven The long occupation of the Sinai by Israel, in the aftermath of the 1967 war with Egypt, opened up the peninsula to study an d research on an unprecedented scale. Archaeologists, historians, ge ographers, topogra- phers, geologists, engineers examined the peninsula from tip to toe. Of particular interest have been the explorations by t he teams of Beno Rothenberg (Sinai Explorations 1967-1972 and other reports), mostly under the auspices of Tel-Aviv University. In the n orthern coastal strip, many ancient sites reflected the \"bridge-like natur e of this area.\" In the Central Plain of north Sinai, no ancient sites of p ermanent abode were found, but only evidence of camping sites, attestin g that this was only a transit area. When the camping sites were plotted o n the map, they formed \"a clear line from the Negev toward Egypt, and this should be considered as the direction of prehistoric movements across th e 'Desert of the Wanderings' (the el-Tih).\" It was against this newly understood background of the ancient Sinai that a Hebrew University biblical geographer, Menashe Ha r-El, offered a new theory (Massa'ei Sinai). Reviewing all the argument s, he pointed out the submerged ridge (see Fig. 116) which rises between the Great and the Little Bitter Lakes. It is shallow enough to be cro ssed if a wind blows away the waters; it was there that the Crossing had take n place. Then the Israelites followed the traditional route south; pa ssing Marrah (Bir Murrah) and Elim (Ayun Mussa), they reached the shores of t he Red Sea and encamped there. Here Har-El offered his major innovation: having jo urneyed along the Gulf of Suez, the Israelites did not go all the way south. They proceeded only some twenty miles to the mouth of Wadi Sudr—an d followed the wadi's valley into the Central Plain, proceeding vi a Nakhl to Kadesh- Barnea. Har-El identified Mount Sinai with Mount Si nn-Bishr which rises some 1,900 feet at the entrance to the wadi, and su ggested that the battle with the Amalekites had actually taken place on the coast of the Gulf of Suez. This suggestion has been rejected by Israeli military experts familiar with the terrain and history of warfare in the Sina i. Where, then, was Mount Sinai? We must look again at the ancient evidence. The Pharaoh, in his Journey to the Afterlife, went eastward. Crossing the watery barrier, he set his course to a pass in the mountains. He then reached the Duat, which was an oval-shaped valley s urrounded by mountains. The \"Mountain of Light\" was situated whe re the Stream of Osiris divided into tributaries. The pictorial depictions (Fig. 16) showed the Strea m of Osiris meander- ing its way through an agricultural area, distingui shed by its ploughmen. We have found similar pictorial evidence from Assyr ia. The Assyrian kings, it should be remembered, arrived at the Sina i from the opposite direction to that of the Egyptian kings: from the n ortheast, via Canaan. One of them, Esarhaddon, engraved on a stela what amoun ts to a route map of"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"The Elusive Mount 225 his own quest for \"Life\" (Fig. 118). It shows the d ate palm—the code emblem for the Sinai; a farming area symbolized by the plough; and a \"Sacred Mount.\" In the upper register we see Esarha ddon at the shrine of the Supreme Deity, near the Tree of Life. It is fla nked by the sign of the bull—the very same image (the \"golden calf\") that t he Israelites had fashioned at the foot of Mount Sinai. All this does not bespeak the harsh, barren granite peaks of southern Sinai. Rather, it suggests northern Sinai and its d ominant Wadi El-Arish, whose very name means Stream of the Husbandman. It is among its tributaries, in a valley surrounded by mountains, t hat the Mount was located. There is only one such place in the whole of the Si nai peninsula. Geography, topography, historical texts, pictorial depictions—all point at the Central Plain in Sinai's northern half. Even E. H. Palmer, who went so far as to invent the Ras-Sufsafeh twist in order to uphold the southern identification, knew i n his heart that a desert that stretches as far as the eye can see, and not a peak in a sea of granite mountains, was the location of the Theophany and th e wanderings of the Israelites. \"The popular conception of Sinai,\" he wrote in The Desert of the Exodus, \"even in the present day, seems to be that a single isolated mountain which may be approached from any direction rises conspicu ously above a boundless plain of sand. The Bible itself, if we re ad it without the light of modern discovery, certainly favors this idea. . . . Mount Sinai is always Fig. 118"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226 The Stairway to Heaven alluded to in the Bible as though it stood alone an d unmistakable in the midst of a level desert plain.\" There indeed exists such a \"level desert plain\" in the Sinai peninsula, he admitted; but it is not covered with sand: \"Even in those parts [of the peninsula] which approach most nearly to our concep tion of what a desert ought to be—a solid ocean bounded only by the horiz on or by a barrier of distant hills—sand is the exception, and the soil r esembles rather a hard gravel path than a soft and yielding beach.\" He was describing the Central Plain. To him, the ab sence of sand marred the \"desert\" image; to us, its hard gravel top mean t that it was admirably suited for the Spaceport of the Nefilim. And if Mou nt Mashu marked the gateway to the Spaceport, it had to be located on t he outskirts of this facility. Have then generations of pilgrims gone south in vai n? Did the veneration of the southern peaks begin only with Christianity? Th e discovery by archaeologists atop these mounts of shrines, altars , and other evidence of worship from olden days attests differently; and th e many inscriptions and rock carvings (including the Jewish Candelabra embl em) by pilgrims from many faiths and over many millennia bespeak a vener ation going back to Man's earliest acquaintance with the area. As one almost wishes there were two \"Mounts Sinai\" to satisfy both tradition and facts, it turns out that such notions too are not new. Even before the last two centuries of concerted effort t o identify the Mount, biblical and theological scholars had wondered whet her the various biblical names for the Sacred Mount did not indicate that th ere originally were two sacred mountains, not one. These names included \"Mo unt Sinai\" (the Mountain of/in Sinai), which was the Mount of the L awgiving; \"Mount Horeb\" (the Mountain of/in the Dryness); \"Mount Par an,\" which was listed in Deuteronomy as the mount in Sinai from which Yah weh had appeared unto the Israelites; and \"the Mountain of the Gods, \" where the Lord first revealed himself unto Moses. The geographic location associated with two of the names is deciphera- ble. Paran was the wilderness adjoining Kadesh-Barn ea, possibly the biblical name for the Central Plain; so that \"Mount Paran\" had to be located there. It was to that Mount that the Israelites had gone. But the Mount where Moses had his first encounter with the Lord, \"the Mountain of the Gods,\" could not have been too far from the Land of Midian; for \"Moses was shepherding the flock of Jetro, his father-in-l aw, the priest of Midian; and he led the flock unto the wilderness, and came unto the Mountain of the Gods, unto Horeb.\" The abode of the Midianites was in southern Sinai, along the Gulf of Aqaba and astride the copper-work ing areas. \"The Mountain of the Gods\" must have been located somewh ere in an adjoining wilderness—in southern Sinai."},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":" Fig. 119 There have been found Sumerian cylinder seals depic ting the appearance of a deity unto a shepherd. They show the god appea ring from between two mountains (Fig. 119), with a rocket-like tree behin d him—perhaps the Sneh (\"Burning Bush\") of the biblical tale. The introduc tion of two peaks in the shepherd scene fits the frequent biblical reference to the Lord as El Shaddai—God of the Two Peaks. It thus raises yet an other distinction between the Mount of the Lawgiving and the Mountain of the Gods: the one was a solitary mount in a desert plain; the oth er seems to have been a combination of two sacred peaks. The Ugaritic texts too recognize a \"Mountain of the young gods\" in the environs of Kadesh, and two peaks of El and Asherah —Shad Elim, Shad Asherath u Rahim—in the south of the peninsula. It was to that area at mebokh naharam (\"Where the two bodies of water begi n\"), kerev apheq tehomtam (\"Near the cleft of the two seas\") that El had retired in his old age. The texts, we believe, describe the southern t ip of the Sinai peninsula. There was, we conclude, a Gateway Mount on the peri meter of the Spaceport in the Central Plain. And there were two peaks in the peninsula's southern tip that also played a role in the comings and goings of the Nefilim. They were the two peaks that measured up.

It shows him seated on a throne, under a canopy whose pillar is shaped as a date palm (Fig. 120). A king and his son are introduced to Shamash by another deity. In front of the seated go d there is mounted upon a pedestal a large emblem of a ray-emitting planet. The inscriptions invoke the gods Sin (father of Shamash), Shamash himself a nd his sister Ishtar. The theme of the scene—the introduction of kings or priests to a major deity—is a familiar one, and poses no problems. Wha t is unique and puzzling in this depiction are the two gods (almost superimposed upon one another) who, from somewhere outside of where the i ntroduction is taking place, hold (with two pairs of hands) two cords lea ding to the celestial emblem. Who are the two Divine Cordholders? What is their f unction? Are they identically situated, and if so, why do they hold o r pull two cords, and not just one? Where are they? What is their connection with Shamash? Sippar, scholars know, was the seat of the High Cou rt of Sumer; Shamash was consequently the ultimate lawgiver. Hammurabi, the Babylonian king famous for his law code, depicted himself receiving the laws from an enthroned Shamash. Was the scene with the two Divin e Cordholders also somehow connected with lawgiving? In spite of all t he speculation, no one has so far come up with an answer. The solution, we believe, has been available all al ong, in the very same British Museum—not among its \"Assyrian\" exhibits, h owever, but in its Egyptian Department. In a room separate from the mu mmies and the other remains of the dead and their tombs, there are exhi bited pages from the various papyri inscribed with the Book of the Dead. And the answer is right there, for all to see (Fig. 121). It is a page from the \"Papyrus of Queen Nejmet\" and the drawing illustrates the final stage of the Pharaoh's journe y in the Duat. The twelve gods who pulled his barge through the subterranean corridors have brought him to the last corridor, the Place of Ascending. T here, the \"Red Eye of Horus\" was waiting.

Gods standing in two groups pray for h is successful arrival at the Imperishable Star. And, unmistakably, there in the Egyptian depiction are two Divine Cordholders! Without the congestion of the depiction from Sippar , this one from the Book of the Dead shows the two Cordholders not crow ding out each other, but at two different ends of the scene. They are cl early located outside of the subterranean corridor. Moreover: each site mann ed by a Cordholder is marked by an omphalos resting upon a platform. And, as the action imparted by the drawing shows, the two divine aides are not simply holding the cords, but are engaged in measuring. The discovery should not surprise: have not the ver ses of the Book of the Dead described how the journeying Pharaoh encounter s the gods \"who hold the rope in the Duat,\" and the gods \"who hold the measuring cord\"? A clue in the Book of Enoch now comes to mind. Ther e, it will be recalled, it is related that as he was taken by an angel to visit the earthly paradise in the west, Enoch \"saw in those days how long cords were given to angels who took to themselves wings, and they we nt towards the north.\" In reply to Enoch's question, his guiding angel exp lained: \"They have gone off to measure . . . they shall bring the measures of the Righteous to the Righteous ... all these measures shall reveal the s ecrets of the Earth.\" Winged beings going north to measure. . . . Measure s that shall reveal the secrets of the Earth. ... All at once, the word s of the Prophet Habakuk thunder in our ears—the words describing the appear ance of the Lord from the south, going north: The Lord from South shall come, The Holy One from Mount Paran. Covered are the heavens with his halo, His splendor fills the Earth; His brilliance is like light. His rays shine forth from where his power is concealed. The Word goes before him, sparks emanate from below. He pauses to measure the Earth; He is seen, and the nations tremble. Was the measuring of Earth and its \"secrets\" tben r elated to the powered flight of the gods in Earth's skies? The Ugaritic t exts add a clue as they tell us that, from the peak of Zaphon, Ba'al \"a cord str ong and supple stretches out, heavenwards (and) to the Seat of Kadesh.\" Whenever these texts report a message from one god to another, the verse begins with the word Hut. Scholars assume tha t it was a kind of a"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"The Pyramids of Gods and Kings 231 calling prefix, a kind of \"Are you ready to hear me ?\" But the term could literally mean in the Semitic languages \"cord, rope .\" Significantly, the term Hut in Egyptian also means \"to extend, to stretch o ut.\" Heinrich Brugsch, commenting on an Egyptian text dealing with the bat tles of Horus (Die Sage von der geflugten Sonnenscheibe) pointed out t hat Hut was also a place name—the abode of the Winged Extenders, as well as the name of the mountain within which Horus was imprisoned by Seth. We find in the Egyptian depiction (Fig. 121) that t he conical \"oracle stones\" were located where the Divine Measurers wer e stationed. Baalbek too was the location of such an omphalos, a Stone o f Splendor that could perform the Hut functions. There was an oracle ston e at Heliopolis, the Egyptian twin-city of Baalbek. Baalbek was the gods ' Landing Platform; the Egyptian cords led to the Pharaoh's Place of Ascent in the Duat. The biblical Lord—called in Habakuk by a variant of El— measured Earth as he flew from south to north. Are these all just a seri es of coincidences—or parts of the same jigsaw puzzle? And then we have the depiction from Sippar. It is n ot puzzling if we recall that in pre-Diluvial times, when Sumer was t he Land of the Gods, Sippar was the Spaceport of the Anunnaki, and Shama sh its Commander. Thus viewed, the role of the Divine Measurers will become clear: their cords measured out the path to the Spaceport. It would help to recall how Sippar was established, how the site of the first Spaceport on Earth was determined, some 400,0 00 years ago. When Enlil and his sons were given the task of crea ting a Spaceport upon planet Earth, in the plain between the Two Rivers o f Mesopotamia, a master plan was drawn up; it involved the selection of a site for the Spaceport, the determination of a flight path, and the establishment of guidance and Mission Control facilities. Based on t he most conspicuous natural feature in the Near East—Mount Ararat—a nor th-south meridian was drawn through it. A flight path over the Persia n Gulf, well away from flanking mountain ranges, was marked out at the pre cise and easy angle of 45°. Where the two lines intersected, on the banks of the Euphrates River, Sippar—\"Bird City\"—was to be. Five settlements, equidistant from one another, wer e laid out along the diagonal 45° line. The central one—Nippur (\"The Pla ce of Crossing\")—was to serve as the Mission Control Center. Other settl ements marked out an arrow-like corridor; all the lines converged at Sip par (Fig. 122). All that, however, was wiped out by the Deluge. In its immediate aftermath—some 13,000 years ago—only the Landing Pl atform at Baalbek had remained. Until a replacement Spaceport could b e built, all landings and takeoffs of the Shuttlecraft had to be conducte d there.

It is the latter, much older and first-ever, pyramids, that are the most intriguing. Much grander, more solid, more accurate, more perfect than all those t hat followed them, they are also the most mysterious—for they contain not a clue to reveal the secret of their construction. Who built them, how w ere they built, why, even when—no one can really say; there are only the ories and educated guesses. The textbooks will tell us that the first of Egypt' s imposing pyramids was built by a king named Zoser, the second Pharaoh of the Third Dynasty (circa 2650 B.C. by most counts). Selecting a site west of Memphis, on the plateau that served as the necropolis (city of the dead) of that ancient capital, he instructed his brilliant scientist and architect named Imhotep to build him a tomb that would surpass all previous to mbs. Until then, the royal custom was to carve out a tomb in the rocky g round, bury the king, and then cover the grave with a giant horizontal to mbstone called a mastaba that in time grew to substantial dimensions. The in genious Imhotep, some scholars hold, covered the original mastaba over th e tomb of Zoser with layer upon layer of ever smaller mastabas, in two p hases (Fig. 125a), achieving a step pyramid. Beside it, within a large rectangular courtyard, a variety of functional and decorative buildings were erected—chapels, funerary temples, storehouses, attendants' quarters and so on; the whole area was then surrounded by a magnificent wall. The pyramid and the ruins of some of the adjoining buildings and the wall can still be seen (Fig. 125b) at Sakkara—a name believed to have honored Seker, t he \"hidden God.\" The kings who followed Zoser, the textbooks continu e to explain, liked what they saw and tried to emulate Zoser.

It never really got off t he ground, for reasons unknown (perhaps the missing ingredient was the eni gmatic genius of science and engineering, Imhotep). A third step pyr amid—or rather the mound containing its ruined beginnings—was discover ed about midway between Sakkara and Giza to the north. Smaller than the previous ones, it is logically attributed by some scholars to the next P haraoh on the throne, named Khaba. Some scholars believe that there were one or two additional attempts by unidentified kings of the Third Dynasty to build pyramids here and there, but without much success. We now have to go some thirty miles south of Sakkar a, to a place named Maidum, to view the pyramid deemed to have been the next one chronologically. In the absence of evidence, it is logically presumed that this pyramid was built by the next Pharaoh in line, named Huni. Through much circumstantial evidence, it is held however th at he only began the construction, and that the attempt to complete the pyramid was undertaken by his successor, Sneferu, who was the first king o f the Fourth Dynasty. It was commenced, as the previous ones, as a step p yramid. But for reasons which remain totally unknown and for which even theories are lacking, its builders decided to make it a \"true\" p yramid, namely to provide it with smooth sides. This meant that a smooth laye r of stones was to be fitted as an outer skin at a steep angle (Fig. 126a ). Again for reasons unknown, an angle of 52° was selected. But what, ac cording to the textbooks, was to be the first-ever true pyramid en ded as a dismal failure: the outer stone skin, the stone fillings and parts of the core itself collapsed under the sheer weight of the stones, all set one a top the other at a precarious angle. All that remains of that attempt is part of the solid core, with a large mound of debris all around it (Fig. 12 6b). Some scholars (as Kurt Mendelssohn, The Riddle of t he Pyramids) suggest that Sneferu was building at the same time another pyramid, somewhat north of Maidum, when the Maidum pyramid c ollapsed. The architects of Sneferu then hurriedly changed the py ramid's angle in mid- construction. The flatter angle (43°) assured great er stability and reduced the height and mass of the pyramid. It was a wise d ecision, as witness the fact that the pyramid—appropriately called the Bent Pyramid (Fig. 127)— still stands. Encouraged by his success, Sneferu ordered another true pyramid to be built near the first. It is referred to as the Red Pyramid, due to the hue of its stones. It is supposed to have represented the real ization of the impossible: a triangular shape rising from a square base; its s ides measuring about 656 feet each, its height a staggering 328 feet. The tr iumph, however, was not achieved without a little cheating: instead of the perfect inclination of 52°, the sides of this \"first classical pyramid\" rise at the much safer angle of under 44°. . . .

Though attributed to different rulers, the three (Fig. 128) obviously were planned and executed as a cohesive group, perf ectly aligned not only to the cardinal points of the compass but also with one another. Indeed, triangulations which begin with these three monumen ts can be extended to measure the whole of Egypt—the whole of Earth, for that matter. This was first realized in modern times by Napoleon's engine ers: they selected the apex of the Great Pyramid as the focal point from w hich they triangulated and mapped Lower Egypt. This was made even easier by the discovery that the site is located, for all intents and purposes, right on the thirtieth parall el (north). The whole Giza complex of massive monuments had been erected at th e eastern edge of the Libyan Plateau, which begins in Libya in the west a nd stretches to the very banks of the Nile. Though only some 150 feet above the river's valley below, the Giza site has a commanding and unobstruc ted view to the four horizons. The Great Pyramid stands at the extreme n ortheastern edge of a protrusion of the plateau; a few hundred feet to th e north and east, sands and mud begin, making such massive structures impos sible. One of the first scientists to have taken precise measurements, Char les Piazzi Smyth (Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid) established that the center of the Great Pyramid was at northern latitude 29° 58' 55\"—a mere one-sixtieth of a degree off from exactly at the thirtieth parallel. The center of the second large pyramid was only thirteen seconds (13/3600 of a degree) to the south of that. The alignment with the cardinal points of the compa ss; the inclination of the sides at the perfect angle of about 52° (at whi ch the height of the pyramid in relation to its circumference is the sam e as that of a radius of a circle to its circumference); the square bases, set on perfectly level platforms—all bespeak of a high degree of scientifi c knowledge of mathema- tics, astronomy, geometry, geography and of course building and architec- ture, as well as the administrative ability to mobi lize the necessary manpower, to plan and execute such massive and long -term projects. The wonderment only increases as one realizes the inter ior complexities and precision of the galleries, corridors, chambers, sh afts and openings that have been engineered within the pyramids, their hid den entrances (always on the north face), the locking and plugging system s—all unseen from the outside, all in perfect alignment with each other, all executed within these artificial mountains as they were being built layer after layer."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":" Fig. 128 Though the Second Pyramid (that of Chefra) is only slightly smaller than the First, \"Great Pyramid\" (heights: 470 and 480 fe et; sides at base 707 and 756 feet, respectively), it is the latter that has by and large captured the interest and imagination of scholars and laymen sin ce men ever set their eyes upon these monuments.

From a distance, the Great Pyramid and its two comp anions appear to be true pyramids; but when approached it is realized t hat they too are a kind of step pyramid, built layer upon layer (scholars call them courses) of stone, each layer smaller than the one below it. Modern st udies, in fact, suggest that the Great Pyramid is a step pyramid at its cor e, engineered to sustain great vertical stress (Fig. 129). What gave it the smooth, inclined sides were the casing stones with which its sides were covered . These have been removed in Arab times and used for the construction of nearby Cairo; but a few can still be seen in position near the top of t he Second Pyramid, and some were discovered at the base of the Great Pyram id (Fig. 130). It is these casing stones which determined the angle of t he pyramid's sides; they are the heaviest of all the stones used to build th e pyramid proper; the six faces that each stone has have been cut and polishe d to an accuracy of optical standards—they fitted not only the core sto nes which they covered, but also each other on all four sides, forming a pr ecision-made area of twenty-one acres of limestone blocks. The Giza pyramids are nowadays also minus their ape x or capstones, which were shaped as pyramidions and may have been either made of metal or covered with a shiny metal—as the similar pyrami dion-shaped tips of obelisks were. Who, when and why they were removed from their great heights, no one knows. It is known however that in later times these apex stones, resembling the Ben-Ben at Heliopolis, were made of special granite and bore appropriate inscriptions. The one from the pyramid of Amen-em- khet at Dahshur, which was found buried some distan ce away from the pyramid (Fig. 131), bore the emblem of the Winged G lobe and the inscription The face of king Amen-em-khet is opened, That he may behold the Lord of the Mountain of Ligh t When he sails across the sky. When Herodotus visited Giza in the fifth century, t he capstones are not mentioned, but the pyramids' sides were still cover ed with the smooth facings. As others before and after him, he wondere d how these monu- ments—counted among the Seven Wonders of the ancien t world—were ever built. Regarding the Great Pyramid, he was tol d by his guides that it took 100,000 men, replaced every three months by fr esh laborers, \"ten years of oppression of the people\" just to build th e causeway leading to the pyramid, so that the quarried stones could be broug ht to the site. \"The pyramid itself was twenty years in building.\" It wa s Herodotus who transmitted the information that the Pharaoh who or dered the pyramid"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"Fig. 129 built was Cheops (Khufu); why and what for, he does not say.

What prompted him was both a scientific quest and a lust for treasure; for he was apprised of ancient legends that the pyramid contai ned a secret chamber wherein celestial maps and terrestrial spheres, as well as \"weapons which do not rust\" and \"glass which can be bent without b reaking\" were hidden away in past ages. Blasting through the mass of stones by heating and cooling them until they cracked, by ramming and chiseling, Al Mamoon's men advanced into the pyramid inch by inch.

From the top of the A scending Passage, a horizontal passage led to a squarish room with a ga bled roof (Fig. 133) and an unusual niche in its east wall; it was bare and empty. This chamber has since been found to lie precisely in the middle of the north-south axis of the pyramid—a fact whose significance has not yet been deciphered. The chamber has come to be known as the \"Queen's Chambe r\"; but the name is based on romantic notions and not on any shred of e vidence. At the head of the Ascending Passage, there extende d for 150 feet and at the same rising angle of 26° a Grand Gallery of int ricate and precise construction (Fig. 134).

A short corridor, of a height and width similar to the former one, then led to a high-ceilinged room constructed of red polishe d granite—the so-called King's Chamber (Fig. 135).

Although scholars persist in referring to the stone coffer as a sarcophagus (its size could well hold a human body), the fact i s that there is nothing, absolutely nothing to support a claim that the Grea t Pyramid was a royal tomb. Indeed, the notion that the pyramids were built as Pharaonic tombs has remained unsupported by concrete evidence. The first pyramid, that of Zoser, contains what sch olars persist in calling two burial chambers, covered by the initial mastaba . When they were first penetrated by H. M. von Minutoli in 1821, he claime d that he found inside parts of a mummy as well as a few inscriptions bear ing the name of Zoser. These, it has been claimed, he sent to Europe but t hey were lost at sea.

A century later, archaeologists reported the discovery of a fragment of a skull and evidence that \"a wood sarco phagus may have stood inside the red granite chamber.\" In 1933, J. E. Qui bell and J. P. Lauer discovered beneath the pyramid additional undergrou nd galleries, in which there were two sarcophagi—empty.

He was buried, it seems, in a magnific ent tomb discovered in 1928 south of the pyramid. This \"Southern Tomb.\" as it came to be known, was reached via a gallery whose stone ceiling imita ted palm trees. It led to a simulated half-open door through which a great encl osure was entered. More galleries led to a subterranean room built of granite blocks; on one of its walls three false doors bore the carvings of th e image, name and titles of Zoser. Many eminent Egyptologists now believe that the pyr amid was only a symbolic burial place for Zoser, and that the king was buried in the richly decorated Southern Tomb, topped by a large rectangu lar superstructure with a concave room which also contained the impera tive chapel—just as depicted in some Egyptian drawings (Fig. 136). The step pyramid presumed to have been begun by Zos er's successor. Sekhemkhet, also contained a \"burial chamber.\" It h oused an alabaster \"sarcophagus,\" which was empty. Textbooks tell us t hat the archaeologist who discovered the chamber and the stone coffer (Za karia Goneim) concluded that the chamber had been penetrated by g rave robbers, who stole the mummy and all other contents of the tomb; but that is not entirely true. In fact, Mr. Goneim found the vertically slid ing door of the alabaster coffer shut and sealed with plaster, and the remain s of a dried-out wreath still rested on top of the coffin.

Archaeologists have identified in th e same vicinity the subterranean remains of yet another, unfinished pyr amid, believed to have been begun by Khaba's successor. Its granite substr ucture contained an unusual oval \"sarcophagus\" sunken into the stone fl oor (as an ultra-modern bathtub). Its lid was still in place, shut tight wi th cement. There was nothing inside. The remains of three other small pyramids, attribut ed to Third Dynasty rulers, were additionally found. In one, the substr ucture has not yet been explored. In the other, no burial chamber was found . In the third, the chamber contained no evidence of a burial at any ti me. Nothing was found in the \"burial chamber\" of the co llapsed pyramid of Maidum, not even a sarcophagus. Instead, Flinders P etrie found only fragments of a wooden coffin, which he announced as the remains of the coffin of Sneferu's mummy. Scholars now invariably believe that it represented the remains of a much later intrusive b urial. The Maidum pyramid is surrounded by numerous Third and Fourth Dynasty mastabas, in which members of the royal family and other VIP' s of that time were entombed. The pyramids enclosure was linked with a lower structure (a so- called funerary temple) which is now submerged by t he Nile's waters. It was perhaps there, surrounded and protected by the sacred river's waters, that the Pharaoh's body was laid to rest. The next two pyramids are even more embarrassing to the pyramids-as- tombs theory. The two pyramids at Dahshur (the Bent and the Red) were both built by Sneferu. The first has two \"burial ch ambers,\" the other three. All for Sneferu? If the pyramid was built by each P haraoh to serve as his tomb, why did Sneferu build two pyramids? Needless to say, the chambers were totally empty when discovered, devoid even of sarcophagi. After some more determined excavations by the Egyptian Antiqui ties Service in 1947 and again in 1953 (especially in the Red Pyramid), the report admitted that \"No trace of a royal tomb has been found there.\" The theory of \"a pyramid by each Pharaoh\" now holds that the next pyramid was built by Sneferu's son, Khufu; and we h ave the word of Herodotus (and Roman historians who relied on his w orks) that it was the Great Pyramid at Giza. Its chambers, even the unvio lated \"King's Chamber,\" were empty. This should not have come as a surprise, for Herodotus (History, vol. II, p. 127) wrote that \"th e Nile water, introduced through an artificial duct, surrounds an island whe re the body of Cheops is said to lie.\" Was then the Pharaoh's real tomb some where lower in the valley and closer to the Nile?

The Second Pyramid of Giza has two entrances on its northern side, instead of the customary single one (see Fig. 129). The first begins— another unusual feature—outside the pyramid and lea ds to an unfinished chamber. The other leads to a chamber aligned with the pyramid's apex. When it was entered in 1818 by Giovanni Belzoni, th e granite sarcophagus was found empty and its lid lying broken on the flo or. An inscription in Arabic recorded the penetration of the chamber cent uries earlier. What, if anything, the Arabs had found, is nowhere recorded. Giza's Third Pyramid, though much smaller than the other two, displays many unique or unusual features. Its core was built with the largest stone blocks of all three pyramids; its lower sixteen cou rses were cased not with white limestone but with formidable granite. It was built first as an even smaller true pyramid (Fig. 129), then doubled in si ze. As a result, it has two usable entrances; it also contains a third, perhaps a \"trial\" entrance not completed by its builders. Of its various chambers, the one deemed the main \"burial chamber\" was entered in 1837 by Howard Vyse and John Perring. They found inside the chamber a magnificen tly decorated basalt sarcophagus; it was, as usual, empty. But nearby Vy se and Perring found a fragment of a wood coffin with the royal name \"Men- ka-Ra\" written upon it, and the remains of a mummy, \"possibly of Menkaura\"— direct confirmation of the statement by Herodotus that the Third Pyrami d \"belonged\" to \"Mycerinus.\" Modern carbon-dating methods, however, established that the wooden coffin \"certainly dates from the Saitic period\"—not earlier than 660 B.C. (K. Michalowsky, Art of Ancient Egypt); th e mummy remains are from early Christian times. They did not belong to any original burial. There is some uncertainty whether Men-ka-Ra was the immediate successor of Chefra; but scholars are certain that his successor was one named Shepsekaf. Which of the various pyramids that were never finished (or whose construction was so inferior that nothing remains above ground) belonged to Shepsekaf, is still unclear. But it is certain that he was not buried within it: he was buried under a monumental mastaba (Fig, 137) whose burial chamber contained a black granite sarc ophagus. It had been penetrated by ancient grave robbers, who emptied to mb and sarcophagus of their contents. The Fifth Dynasty that followed began with Userkaf. He built his pyramid at Sakkara, near Zoser's pyramid complex. I t was violated by both grave robbers and intrusive burials. His successor (Sahura) built a pyramid north of Sakkara (today's Abusir). Though one of th e best preserved (Fig. 138), nothing was found in its rectangular \"burial chamber.\" But the magnificence of its temples, that stretched between it and the Nile Valley, and the fact that one of the lower temple rooms was decorated with stone columns simulating palm trees, may indicate that it was somewhere near the pyramid that Sahura's real tomb was."},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"250 The Stairway to Heaven Fig. 137 Fig. 138 Fig. 139"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"The Pyramids of Gods and Kings 251 Neferirkara, who followed on the throne of Egypt, b uilt his funerary complex not far from Sahura's.

The next ruler built his pyramid more with dried mud br icks and wood than with stone; only meager remains of the structure we re found.

Neuserra, however, is better known for his funerary temple, b uilt in the shape of a stubby, short obelisk upon a truncated pyramid (Fig . 139). The obelisk rose 118 feet; its apex was covered with gilded copper. The pyramid of the next Pharaoh has not been found; perhaps it has crumbled to a mound, covered by the desert's shifti ng sands. That of his successor was identified only in 1945. Its substruc ture contained the usual chamber, which was bare and empty. The pyramid of Unash—last of the Fifth Dynasty or, as some prefer, first of the Sixth—marked a major change of custom. It wa s there that Gaston Maspero discovered for the first time (in 1880) the Pyramid Texts, inscribed on the walls of the pyramid's chambers and corridor s.

When exposed, it may cause loss and shame. When sustained, it may change the records of history. This, we believe, has happened to the Great Pyramid and its presumed builder, the Pharaoh named Khufu. Systematic and disciplined archaeological re-examin ation of pyramid sites that were hurriedly excavated a century and a half ago (many times by treasure hunters), has raised numerous questions re garding some of the earlier conclusions. It has been held that the Pyra mid Age began with Zoser's step pyramid, and was marked by successive progression toward a true pyramid, which finally succeeded. But why was it so important to achieve a true pyramid? If the art of pyramid build ing was progressively improved, why were the many pyramids which followed the Giza pyramids inferior, rather than superior to those of Giza? Was Zoser's step pyramid the model for others, or w as it itself an emulation of an earlier model? Scholars now believe that the first, smaller step pyramid (Fig. 125) that Imhotep built over the mastaba \"was cased with beautiful, fine white limestone\" (Ahmed Fakhry , The Pyramids); \"before this casing was complete, however, he plann ed another altera- tion\"—the superimposition of an even larger pyramid . However, as new evidence suggests, even that final step pyramid was cased, to look like a true pyramid. The casing, uncovered by archaeologic al missions of Harvard University led by George Reisner, was primitively m ade of mud bricks, which of course crumbled soon enough—leaving the im pression that Zoser built a step pyramid. Moreover, these mud bricks, i t was found, were whitewashed to simulate a casing of white limestone . Whom then was Zoser trying to emulate? Where had Im hotep seen a true pyramid already up and complete, smooth sides and limestone casing and all? And another question: If, as the present t heory holds, the attempts at Maidum and Sakkara to build a smooth, 52° pyrami d had failed, and Sneferu had to \"cheat\" and build the presumed first true pyramid at an angle of only 43°—why did his son at once proceed t o build a much larger 253"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"254 The Stairway to Heaven pyramid at the precarious angle of 52°—and supposed ly managed to achieve that with no problem at all? If the pyramids of Giza were only \"usual\" pyramids in the successive chain of pyramid-per-Pharaoh—why did Khufu's son Ra dedef not build his pyramid next to his father's, at Giza? Remember—the other two Giza pyramids were supposedly not there yet, so Radedef had the whole site free to build as he pleased. And if his father's archite cts and engineers mastered the art of building the Great Pyramid, where were t hey to help Radedef build a similar imposing pyramid, rather than the i nferior and quickly crumbling one that bears his name? Was the reason that no other pyramid but the Great Pyramid possessed an Ascending Passage, that its unique Ascending Pas sage was successfully blocked and hidden until AD . 820—so that all who emulated this pyramid knew of a Descending Passage only? The absence of hieroglyphic inscriptions in the thr ee pyramids of Giza is also a reason for wondering, as James Bonwick did a century ago (Pyramid Facts and Fancies): \"Who can persuade himself that the Egyptians would have left such superb monuments without at least hi eroglyphical inscrip- tions—they who were profuse of hieroglyphics upon a ll the edifices of any consideration?\" The absence, one must surmise, stem s from the fact that the pyramids had either been built before the devel opment of hieroglyphic writing, or were not built by the Egyptians. These are some of the points that strengthen our be lief that when Zoser and his successors began the custom of pyramid buil ding, they set out to emulate the models that had already existed: the py ramids of Giza. They were not improvements on Zoser's earlier efforts; r ather, they were the prototypes which Zoser, and Pharaohs after him, att empted to emulate. Some scholars have suggested that the small satelli te pyramids at Giza were really scale models (about 1:5) that were used by the ancients exactly as today's architects use scale models for evaluati on and guidance; but it is now known that they were later augmentations. Howev er, we think that there was indeed such a scale model; the Third Pyra mid, with its obvious structural experiments. Then, we believe, the large r two were built as a pair of guiding beacons for the Anunnaki. But what about Menkara, Chefra and Khufu, who (we h ave been told by Herodotus) were the builders of these pyramids? Well indeed—what about them? The temples and causew ay attached to the Third Pyramid do bear evidence that their build er was Menkara— evidence that includes inscriptions bearing his nam e and several exquisite statues showing him embraced by Hathor and another goddess. But all that this attests to is that Menkara built these auxilia ry structures, associating himself with the pyramid—not that he built it. The Anunnaki, it is logical to assume, needed only the pyramids and would not have built temples to worship themselves; only a Pharaoh required a funer ary temple and a mortuary temple and the other structures associated with his journey to the gods."},{"pageNumber":256,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 255 Inside the Third Pyramid proper, not an inscription , not a statue, not a decorated wall have been found; just stark, austere precision. The only purported evidence proved to be a false pretense: t he fragments of the wooden coffin inscribed with the name of Menkara pr oved to be from a time some 2,000 years after his reign; and the mummy \"ma tching\" the coffin was from early Christian times. There is thus not a shr ed of evidence to support the notion that Menkara—or any Pharaoh for that mat ter—had anything to do with creating and building the pyramid itself. The Second Pyramid is likewise completely bare. Sta tues bearing the cartouche (oval frame within which the royal name i s inscribed) of Chefra were found only in the temples adjoining the pyrami d. But there is nothing at all to indicate that he had built it. What then, about Khufu? With one exception, which we will expose as a proba ble forgery, the only claim that he built the Great Pyramid is reported b y Herodotus (and, based on his writings, by a Roman historian). Herodotus d escribed him as a ruler who enslaved his people for thirty years to build t he causeway and the pyramid. Yet by every other account, Khufu reigned for only twenty-three years. If he were such a grandiose builder, blessed with the greatest of architects and masons, where are his other monument s, where are his bigger-than-life statues? There are none; and it would seem from the absence of such commem- orative remains that Khufu was a very poor builder, not a majestic one. But he had a bright idea: our guess is that having seen the crumbled mud-brick casings of the step pyramids, the collapsed pyramid at Maidum, the hurried bending of the first pyramid of Sneferu, the improp er inclination of Sneferu's second pyramid—Khufu hit upon a great ide a. Out there, at Giza, there stood perfect and unspoken of pyramids. Could he not ask the gods' permission to attach to one of them the funerary te mples which his Journey to the Afterlife required? There was no intrusion u pon the sanctity of the pyramid itself: all the temples, including the Vall ey Temple in which Khufu was probably buried, were on the outside: adjoining , but not even touching, the Great Pyramid. Thus had the Great Pyr amid become known as Khufu's. Khufu's successor, Radedef, shunned his father's id ea and preferred to raise his own pyramid, as Sneferu had done. But why had he gone to the north of Giza, rather than place his shrine next to his father's? The simple explanation is that the promontory of Giza was alre ady fully occupied—by three olden pyramids plus the satellite structures erected nearby by Khufu. . . . Witnessing Radedef's failure, the next Pharaoh—Chef ra—preferred Khufu's solution. When his time came to need a pyra mid, he saw no harm in appropriating for himself the ready-made second large pyramid, sur- rounding it with his own temples and satellites. Me nkara, his successor, then attached himself to the last available pyramid , the so-called Third Pyramid."},{"pageNumber":257,"pageContent":"256 The Stairway to Heaven With the ready-made pyramids thus taken, the Pharao hs who followed were forced to obtain pyramids the hard way: by try ing to build them. . . . As those who had tried this before (Zoser, Sneferu, Radedef), their own efforts too ended with inferior emulations of the t hree olden pyramids. At first blush, our suggestion that Khufu (as the o ther two) had nothing to do with building the pyramid associated with him ma y sound very farfetched. It is hardly so. In evidence, we call u pon Khufu himself. Whether Khufu had really built the Great Pyramid wa s a question that began to perplex serious Egyptologists more than a century and a quarter ago, when the only object mentioning Khufu and conn ecting him with the pyramid was discovered. Puzzlingly, it affirmed tha t he did not build it: it already existed when he reigned! The damning evidence is a limestone stela (Fig. 141 ) which was discovered by Auguste Mariette in the 1850s in the ruins of the temple of Isis, near the Great Pyramid. Its inscription ident ifies it as a self-laudatory monument by Khufu, erected to commemorate the resto ration by him of the temple of Isis and of images and emblems of the gods which Khufu found inside the crumbling temple. The opening vers es unmistakably identify Khufu by his cartouche: The common opening, invoking Horus and proclaiming long life for the king, then packs explosive statements: According to the inscription on this stela (which i s in the Cairo Museum), the Great Pyramid was already standing when Khufu a rrived on the scene."},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":"Fig. 141 Forging the Pharaoh's Name 257 "},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"258 The Stairway to Heaven Its mistress was the goddess Isis—it belonged to th is goddess, and not to Khufu. Furthermore, the Sphinx too—which has been a ttributed to Chefra, who presumably built it together with the Second Py ramid—was also already crouching at its present location. The cont inuation of the inscription pinpoints the position of the Sphinx accurately, an d records the fact that part of it was damaged by lightning—a damage percei vable to this very day. Khufu continues to state in his inscription that he built a pyramid for the Princess Henutsen \"beside the temple of the goddess .\" Archaeologists have found independent evidence that the southernmost of the three small pyramids flanking the Great Pyramid—the small pyram id nearest the temple of Isis—was in fact dedicated to Henutsen, a wife of Khufu. Everything in the inscription thus matches the know n facts; but the only pyramid-building claim made by Khufu is that he bui lt the small pyramid for the princess. The Great Pyramid, he states, was already there, as was the Sphinx (and, by inference, the other two pyrami ds as well). Such support for our theories is even further stren gthened, as we read in another portion of the inscription that the Great P yramid was also called \"The Western Mountain of Hathor\": Live Horus Mezdau; To King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Khufu, Life is given. For his mother Isis, the Divine Mother, Mistress of \"The Western Mountain of Hathor,\" he made (this) writing on a stela. He gave (her) a new sacred offering. He built (her) a House (temple) of stone, renewed the gods that were found in her temple. Hathor, we will recall, was the mistress of the Sin ai peninsula. If the highest peak of the peninsula was her Eastern Mount ain, the Great Pyramid was her Western Mountain—the two acting as the anchors for the Landing Corridor. This \"Inventory Stela,\" as it came to be called, be ars all the marks of authenticity. Yet scholars at the time of its disco very (and many ever since) have been unable to reconcile themselves to its una voidable conclusions. Unwilling to upset the whole structure of Pyramidol ogy, they proclaimed the Inventory Stela a forgery—an inscription made \" long after the death of Khufu\" (to quote Selim Hassan, Excavations at Giza) , but invoking his name \"to support some fictitious claim of the local priests.\" James H. Breasted, whose Ancient Records of Egypt i s the standard work on ancient Egyptian inscriptions, wrote in 1906 tha t \"the references to the Sphinx, and the so-called temple beside it in the t ime of Khufu, have made this monument from the first an object of great int erest. These references would be of the highest importance if the monument were contempo-"},{"pageNumber":260,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 259 raneous with Khufu; but the orthographic evidences of its late date are entirely conclusive.\" He disagreed with Gaston Masp ero, a leading Egyptologist of the time, who had earlier suggested that the stela, if indeed of late orthography, was a copy of an earlier and a uthentic original. In spite of the doubts, Breasted included the inscription am ong the records of the Fourth Dynasty. And Maspero, when he wrote his comp rehensive The Dawn of Civilization in 1920, accepted the contents of the Inventory Stela as factual data concerning the life and activities of Khufu. Why then the reluctance to call the artifact authen tic? The Inventory Stela was condemned as a forgery beca use only a decade or so earlier the identification of Khufu as the bu ilder of the Great Pyramid appeared to have been undisputably established. The seemingly conclusive evidence was markings in red paint, discovered in s ealed chambers above the King's Chamber, which could be interpreted as m asons' markings made in the eighteenth year of the reign of Khufu (Fig. 142). Since the chambers were not entered until discovered in 1837, the mark ings must have been authentic; and if the Inventory Stela offered contr adictory information, the Stela must have been a forgery. But as we probe the circumstances of the red-paint markings, and ascertain who the discoverers were—an inquiry someh ow never under- taken before—the conclusion that emerges is this: i f a forgery had taken place, it occurred not in ancient times but in the year A . D . 1837; and the forgers were not \"some local priests,\" but two (or three) unscrupulous Englishmen. . . . The story begins with the arrival in Egypt on Decem ber 29, 1835 of Colonel Richard Howard Vyse, a \"black sheep\" of an aristocratic English family. At that time, other officers of Her Majesty 's Army had become prominent in the ranks of \"antiquarians\" (as archae ologists were then called), reading papers before distinguished societ ies and receiving due public accolade. Whether or not Vyse had gone to Eg ypt with such notions in mind, the fact is that visiting the pyramids of Giza, he was at once caught by the fever of daily discoveries by scholars and l aymen alike. He was especially thrilled by the tales and theories of on e Giovanni Battista Caviglia, who had been searching for a hidden chamb er inside the Great Pyramid. Within days, Vyse offered to provide the funds for Caviglia's search, if he were accepted as a co-discoverer. Caviglia rejected the offer outright; and the offended Vyse sailed off to Beirut at the end o f February 1836, to visit Syria and Asia Minor. But the long trip did not cure the craving that was aroused within him. Instead of returning to England, he showed up back in Egypt in October 1836. On the earlier visit, he had befriended a cra fty go-between by the name of J. R. Hill, then a copper mill superintende nt. Now he was introduced to a \"Mr. Sloane,\" who whispered that th ere were ways to get a Firman—a concession decree—from the Egyptian go vernment to sole"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":" Fig. 142 excavation rights at Giza. Thus guided, Vyse went t o the British Consul, Col. Campbell, for the necessary documentation. To his great shock, the Firman named Campbell and Sloane as co-permitees, a nd designated Caviglia as the works' supervisor. On November 2, 1 836, the disappointed Vyse paid over to Caviglia *'my first subscription of 200 dollars\" and left in disgust on a sightseeing trip to Upper Egypt. As chronicled by Vyse in his Operations Carried on at the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837, he returned to Giza on January 24, 1 837, \"extremely anxious to see what progress had been made.\" But instead of searching for the hidden chamber, Caviglia and his workmen were busy digging up mum- mies from tombs around the pyramids. Vyse's fury su bsided only when Caviglia asserted that he had something important t o show him: writing by the pyramids' builders! The excavations at the tombs showed that the ancien t masons sometimes"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 261 marked the pre-cut stones with red paint. Such mark ings, Caviglia said, he found at the base of the Second Pyramid. But when e xamined with Vyse, the \"red paint\" turned out to be natural discolorat ions in the stone. What about the Great Pyramid? Caviglia, working the re to discover where the \"air channels\" were leading from the \"Kin g's Chamber,\" was more than ever convinced that there were secret cha mbers higher up. One such compartment, reachable via a crawlway, was dis covered by Nathaniel Davison in 1765 (Fig. 143). Vyse demanded that work be concentrated there; he was dismayed to find out that Caviglia an d Campbell were more interested in finding mummies, which every museum t hen desired. Caviglia had even gone so far as to name a large to mb he had found \"Campbell's Tomb.\" Determined to run his own show, Vyse moved from Cai ro to the site of the pyramids. \"I naturally wished to make some disc overies before 1 returned to England,\" he admitted in his journal on January 27, 1837. At great expense to his family, he was now gone for we ll over a year. In the following weeks, the rift with Caviglia wide ned as Vyse hurled at him various accusations. On February 11, the two ha d a violent argument. On the twelfth, Caviglia made major discoveries in Campbell's Tomb: a sarcophagus inscribed with hieroglyphs and masons' red-paint markings on the stone walls of the tomb. On the thirteenth, Vys e summarily discharged Caviglia and ordered him away from the site. Cavigl ia returned only once, on the fifteenth, to pick up his belongings; for ye ars thereafter, he made \"dishonorable accusations\" against Vyse, whose natu re Vyse's chronicles do not care to detail. Was the row a genuine disagreement, or did Vyse art ificially bring matters to a head in order to get Caviglia off the site? Fig. 143"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262 The Stairway to Heaven As it turned out, Vyse secretly entered the Great P yramid on the night of February 12, accompanied by one John Perring—an eng ineer with the Egyptian Public Works Department and a dabbler in E gyptology—whom Vyse met through the resourceful Mr. Hill. The two examined an intriguing crevice that had developed in a granite block above Davison's Chamber; when a reed was pushed in, it went through unbent; there was obviously some space beyond. What schemes did the two concoct during that secret night visit? We can only guess from future events. The facts are that V yse dismissed Caviglia the next morning and put Perring on his payroll. In his journal, Vyse confided: \"I am determined to carry on the excavati ons above the roof of (Davison's) Chamber, where I expect to find a sepul chral apartment.\" As Vyse threw more men and money behind this search, r oyalty and other dignitaries came to inspect the finds at Campbell's Tomb; there was little new that Vyse could show them inside the pyramid. I n frustration, Vyse ordered his men to bore into the shoulder of the Sp hinx, hoping to find its masons' markings. Unsuccessful, he refocused his at tention on the Hidden Chamber. By mid-March, Vyse faced a new problem: other proje cts were luring away his workmen. He doubled their pay, if only the y would work day and night: time, he realized, was running out. In despe ration, Vyse threw caution to the winds, and ordered the use of explos ives to blast his way through the stones that blocked his progress. By March 27, the workmen managed to cut a small hol e through the granite slabs. Illogically, Vyse thereupon discharg ed the foreman, one named Paulo. On the following day, Vyse wrote, \"I i nserted a candle at the end of a rod through a small hole that had been mad e in the chamber above Davison's, and I had the mortification of finding t hat it was a chamber of construction like that below it.\" He had found the Hidden Chamber! (Fig. 144.) Using gunpowder to enlarge the hole, Vyse entered t he newly dis- covered chamber on March 30—accompanied by Mr. Hill . They examined it thoroughly. It was hermetically sealed, with no opening whatsoever. Its floor consisted of the rough side of the large gran ite slabs that formed the ceiling of Davison's Chamber below. \"A black sedime nt was equally distributed all over the floor, showing each footst ep.\" (The nature of this black powder, which was \"accumulated to some depth, \" has never been ascertained.) \"The ceiling was beautifully polished and had the finest joints.\" The chamber, it was clear, had never been entered before; yet it contained neither sarcophagus nor treasure. It was bare—completely empty. Vyse ordered the hole enlarged, and sent a message to the British Consul announcing that he had named the new compartment \"W ellington's Chamber.\" In the evening, \"Mr. Perring and Mr. Mash having arrived, we"},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":" Fig. 144 went into Wellington's Chamber and took various mea surements, and in doing so we found the quarry marks.\" What a sudden stroke of luck! They were similar to the red-painted quarry marks f ound in tombs outside the pyramid. Somehow, Vyse and Hill missed them entirely when they thoroughly inspected the chamber by themselves . But joined by Mr. Perring and by Mr. Mash—a civil engineer who was pr esent at Perring's invitation—there were four witnesses to the unique discovery. The fact that Wellington's Chamber was almost ident ical to Davison's led Vyse to suspect that there was yet another chamber above it. For no given reason Vyse dismissed on April 4 the remaining fore man, one named Giachino. On April 14, the British Consul and the A ustrian Consul General visited the site. They requested that copies be mad e of the masons' markings. Vyse put Perring and Mash to work—but ins tructed them to copy first the earlier-discovered markings in Campb ell's tomb; the unique ones inside the Great Pyramid could somehow wait. With liberal use of gunpowder, the compartment abov e Wellington's (Vyse named it after Lord Nelson) was broken into o n April 25. It was as empty as the others, its floor also covered with th e mysterious black dust. Vyse reported that he found \"several quarry marks i nscribed in red upon the blocks, particularly on the west side.\" All alo ng, Mr. Hill was going in and out of the newly found chambers, ostensibly to inscribe in them (how?) the names of Wellington and Nelson. On the twenty-s eventh Mr. Hill—not Perring or Mash—copied the quarry marks. Vyse repro duced the ones from Nelson's Chamber (though not the ones from Wellingt on's) in his book (Fig. 145a). On May 7, the way was blasted through into one more chamber above"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"264 The Stairway to Heaven Nelson's, which Vyse named temporarily after Lady A rbuthnot. The journal entry makes no mention of any quarry marks, althoug h they were later on found there in profusion. What was striking about t he new markings was that they included cartouches—which could only mean royal names (Fig. 145b)—in profusion. Has Vyse come upon the actual w ritten name of the Pharaoh who had built the pyramid? On May 18, a Dr. Walni \"applied for copies of the c haracters found in the Great Pyramid, in order to send them to Mr. Roselli ni,\" an Egyptologist who had specialized in the decipherment of royal na mes. Vyse turned the request down outrightly. The next day, in the company of Lord Arbuthnot, a M r. Brethel and a Mr. Raven, Vyse entered Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber an d the four \"compared Mr. Hill's drawings with the quarry marks in the Great Pyramid; and we afterward signed an attestation to their accuracy.\" Soon thereafter, the final vaulted chamber was broken in to, and more mark- ings—including a royal cartouche—were found. Vyse t hen proceeded to Cairo and submitted the authenticated copies of the writings on the stones to the British Embassy, for official forwarding to London. His work was done: he found hitherto unknown chambe rs, and he proved the identity of the builder of the Great Pyramid; f or within the cartouches was written the royal name Kh-u-f-u To this discovery, every textbook has been attestin g to this very day. The impact of Vyse's discoveries was great, and the ir acceptance assured, after he managed to quickly obtain a confirmation f rom the experts of the British Museum in London. When the facsimiles made by Mr. Hill reached the Mu seum, and when exactly their analysis reached Vyse, is not clear; but he made the Museum's opinion (by the hand of its hieroglyphics expert Sa muel Birch) part of his chronicle of May 27, 1837. On the face of it, the l ong analysis confirmed Vyse's expectations: the names in the cartouches co uld be read as Khufu or variations thereof: just as Herodotus had written, Cheops was the builder of the Great Pyramid. But in the excitement which understandably followed , little attention was paid to the many if's and but's in the Museum's opi nion. It also contained the clue that tipped us off to the forgery: the for ger's clumsy mistake. To begin with, Mr. Birch was uneasy about the ortho graphy and script of the many markings. \"The symbols or hieroglpyhs trac ed in red by the sculptor, or mason, upon the stones in the chambers of the Great Pyramid are apparently quarry marks,\" he observed in his op ening paragraph; the qualification at once followed: \"Although not very legible, owing to their having been written in semi-hieratic or linear-hier oglyphic characters, they possess points of considerable interest. . . . \" What puzzled Mr. Birch was that markings p resumably from the"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Fig. 145 Forging the Pharaoh's Name 265 "},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266 The Stairway to Heaven beginning of the Fourth Dynasty were made in a scri pt that started to appear only centuries later. Originating as pictogr aphs—\"written pic- tures\"—the writing of hieroglyphic symbols required great skill and long training; so, in time, in commercial transactions, a more quickly written and simpler, more linear script referred to as hieratic came into use. The hieroglyphic symbols discovered by Vyse thus belong ed to another period. They were also very indistinct and Mr. Birch had gr eat difficulty in reading them: \"The meaning of the hieroglyphics following t he prenomen in the same linear hand as the cartouche, is not very obvi ous. . . . The symbols following the name are very indistinct.\" Many of th em looked to him \"written in characters very nearly hieratic\"—from a n even much later period than the semi-hieratic characters. Some of t he symbols were very unusual, never seen in any other inscription in Egy pt: \"The cartouche of Suphis\" (Cheops), he wrote, \"is followed by a hiero glyphic to which it would be difficult to find a parallel.\" Other symbo ls were \"equally difficult of solution.\" Mr. Birch was also puzzled by \"a curious sequence o f symbols\" in the upper-most, vaulted chamber (named by Vyse \"Campbel l's Chamber\"). There, the hieroglyphic symbol for \"good, gracious\" was used as a numeral—a usage never discovered before or since. T hose unusually written numerals were assumed to mean \"eighteenth y ear\" (of Khufu's reign). No less puzzling to him were the symbols which foll owed the royal cartouche and which were \"in the same linear hand a s the cartouche.\" He assumed that they spelled out a royal title, such a s \"Mighty in Upper and Lower Egypt.\" The only similarity that he could fin d to this row of symbols was that of \"a title that appears on the coffin of the queen of Amasis\" of the Saitic period. He saw no need to stress that the Ph araoh Amasis had reigned in the sixth century B.C.—more than 2,000 y ears after Khufu! Whoever daubed the red-paint markings reported by V yse had thus employed a writing method (linear), scripts (semi-h ieratic and hieratic) and titles from various periods—but none from the time of Khufu, and all from later periods. Their writer was also not too litera te: many of his hieroglyphs were either unclear, incomplete, out of place, erro neously employed or completely unknown. (Analyzing these inscriptions a year later, the lea ding German Egyptolo- gist of the time, Carl Bichard Lepsius, was likewis e puzzled by the fact that the inscriptions \"were traced with a brush in red p aint in a cursive manner, so much so that they resemble hieratic signs.\" Some of the hieroglyphs following the cartouches, he declared, were totally unknown, and \"I am unable to explain them.\") Turning to the main issue on which he was requested to give an opinion—the identity of the Pharaoh named in the in scriptions—Birch threw a bombshell: there were two, and not just one , royal names within the pyramid!"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 267 Was it possible that two kings had built the same p yramid? And if so, who were they? The two royal names appearing in the inscriptions, Samuel Birch reported, were not unknown: \"they had already been found in the tombs of functionaries employed by monarchs of that dynasty, \" namely the Fourth Dynasty to whose Pharaohs the pyramids of Giza were attributed. One cartouche (Fig. 146a) was then read Saufou or Shouf ou; the other (146b) included the ram symbol of the god Khnum and was th en read Senekhuf or Seneshoufou. Attempting to analyze the meaning of the name with the ram symbol, Birch noted that \"a cartouche, similar to that whic h first occurs in Wellington's Chamber, had been published by Mr. Wil kinson, mater. Hieroglyph, Plate of Unplaced Kings E; and also by Mr. Rosellini, torn. i. tav.1,3, who reads the phonetic elements of which i t is composed 'Seneshufo,' which name is supposed by Mr. Wilkinso n to mean 'the Brother of Suphis.'\" That one Pharaoh might have completed a pyramid beg un by his predecessor has been a theory accepted by Egyptolog ists (as in the case of the pyramid at Maidum). Could not this account for two royal names within the same pyramid? Perhaps—but certainly not in our case. The impossibility in the case of the Great Pyramid stems from the location of the various cartouches (Fig. 147). The cartouche that is presumed to have belonged in the pyramid, that of C heops/Khufu, was found only in the uppermost, vaulted chamber, the o ne named Campbell's Chamber. The several cartouches which spelled out t he second name (nowadays read Khnem-khuf) appeared in Wellington's Chamber and in Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber (no cartouches were inscri bed in Nelson's Chamber). In other words, the lower chambers bore t he name of a Pharaoh who lived and reigned after Cheops. As there was no way to build the pyramid except from its base upward, the location o f the cartouches meant that Cheops, who reigned before Chephren, completed a pyramid begun by a Pharaoh who succeeded him. That, of course, wa s not possible. Conceding that the two names could have stood for w hat the ancient King Lists had called Suphis I (Cheops) and Suphis II (C hephren), Birch tried to resolve the problem by wondering whether both names , somehow, belonged to Cheops alone—one as his actual name, th e other as his \"prenomen.\" But his final conclusion was that \"the presence of this (second) name, as a quarry-mark, in the Great Pyramid, is an additional embarrass- ment\" on top of the other embarrassing features of the inscriptions. The \"Problem of the Second Name\" was still unresolv ed when England's most noted Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie, spent mon ths measuring the pyramids a half century later. \"The most destructiv e theory about this king (Khnem-khuf) is that he is identical with Khufu,\" P etrie wrote in The Pyramids and Temples of Gizeh, giving the many reas ons voiced by then by other Egyptologists against such a theory. For any number of reasons,"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"268 The Stairway to Heaven Fig. 146"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Fig. 147 Forging the Pharaoh's Name 269 "},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"270 The Stairway to Heaven Petrie showed, the two names belonged to two separa te kings. Why then did both names appear within the Great Pyramid in t he locations in which they did? Petrie believed that the only plausible e xplanation would be that Cheops and Chephren were co-regents, reigning toget her. Since no evidence to support Petrie's theory has be en found, Gaston Maspero wrote almost a century after the discovery by Vyse that \"the existence of the two cartouches Khufui and Khnem-Kh ufui on the same monuments has caused much embarrassment to Egyptolo gists\" (The Dawn of Civilization). The problem, in spite of all sugg ested solutions, is still an embarrassing one. But a solution, we believe, can be offered—if we st op attributing the inscriptions to ancient masons, and begin to look a t the facts. The pyramids of Giza are unique, among other things , for the complete absence of any decoration or inscription within the m—with the outstanding exception of the inscriptions found by Vyse. Why th e exception? If the masons felt no qualms about daubing in red paint in scriptions upon the blocks of stones hidden away in the compartments ab ove the \"King's Chamber,\" why were there absolutely no such inscrip tions found in the first compartment, the one discovered by Davison in 1765— but only in the compartments found by Vyse? In addition to the inscriptions reported by Vyse, t here have been found in the various compartments true masons' markings—p ositioning lines and arrows. They are all drawn as one would expect, wit h the right side up; for when they were drawn, the compartment in which the masons worked was not yet roofed: they could stand up, move about and draw the markings without encumberment. But all the inscriptions—draw n over and around the masons' markings (Fig. 145)—are either upside d own or vertical, as though whoever drew them had to bend or crouch with in the low compartments (their height varied from one foot fou r inches to four feet five inches in Lady Arbuthnot's Chamber, from two feet t wo inches to three feet eight inches in Wellington's Chamber). The cartouches and royal titles daubed upon the wal ls of the compart- ments were imprecise, crude and extra large. Most c artouches were two and a half to three feet long and about a foot wide , sometimes occupying the better part of the face of the stone block on which they were painted—as though the inscriber had needed all the space he co uld get. They are in sharp contrast to the precision and delicacy and pe rfect sense of proportion of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, evident in the t rue masons' markings found in those same compartments. With the exception of a few markings on a corner of the eastern wall in Wellington's Chamber, no inscriptions were found on the eastern walls of any other chamber; nor were there any other symbols (other than the original masons' markings) found on any of these ot her eastern walls, except for a few meaningless lines and a partial outline o f a bird on the vaulted eastern end of Campbell's Chamber."},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 271 This is odd, especially if one realizes that it was from the eastern side that Vyse had tunneled to and broken into these compartm ents. Did the ancient masons anticipate that Vyse would break in through the eastern walls, and obliged by not putting inscriptions on them? Or doe s the absence of such inscriptions suggest that whoever daubed them prefe rred to write on the intact walls to the north, south and west, rather t han on the damaged east walls? In other words: cannot all the puzzles be solved, i f we assume that the inscriptions were not made in antiquity, when the p yramid was being built, but only after Vyse had blasted his way into the co mpartments? The atmosphere that surrounded Vyse's operations in those hectic days is well described by the Colonel himself. Major discov eries were being made all around the pyramids, but not within them. Campb ell's Tomb, dis- covered by the detested Caviglia, was yielding not only artifacts but also masons' markings and hieroglyphics in red paint. Vy se was becoming desperate to achieve his own discovery. Finally he broke through to hitherto unknown chambers; but they only duplicated one after the other a previously discovered chamber (Davison's) and were bare and empty. What could he show for all the effort and expenditure? F or what would he be honored, by what would he be remembered? We know from Vyse's chronicles that, by day, he had sent in Mr. Hill to inscribe the chambers with the names of the Duke of Wellington and Admiral Nelson, heroes of the victories over Napole on. By night, we suspect, Mr. Hill also entered the chambers—to \"chr isten\" the pyramid with the cartouches of its presumed ancient builder . \"The two royal names,\" Birch pointed out in his Opi nion, \"had already been found in the tombs of functionaries employed b y the monarchs of that dynasty under which these Pyramids were erected.\" T he Pharaoh's artisans surely knew the correct name of their king. But in the 1830s Egyptology was still in its infancy; and no one could yet tell for sure which was the correct hieroglyphic design of the king whom Herodo tus called \"Cheops.\" And so it was, we suspect, that Mr. Hill—probably a lone, certainly at night when all others were gone—had entered the new ly discovered chambers. Using the imperative red paint, by torchl ight, crouching and bending in the low compartments, he strained to cop y hieroglyphic symbols from some source; and he drew on the walls that wer e intact what seemed to him appropriate markings. He ended up inscribing , in Wellington's Chamber as in Lady Arbuthnot's, the wrong name. With inscriptions of royal names of the Fourth Dyna sty popping up in the tombs surrounding the pyramids of Giza, which were the right cartouches to be inscribed by Hill? Unschooled in hieroglyphic writing, he must have taken with him into the pyramid some source book fr om which to copy the intricate symbols. The one and only book repeatedly mentioned in Vyse's chronicles is (Sir) John Gardner Wilkinson's Materi a Hieroglyphica. As its title page declared, it aimed to update the read er on \"the Egyptian"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"272 The Stairway to Heaven Pantheon and the Succession of the Pharaohs from th e earliest times to the conquest of Alexander.\" Published in 1828—nine year s before Vyse's assault on the pyramids—it was a standard book for English Egyptologists. Birch had stated in his report, \"a cartouche, simil ar to that which first occurs in Wellington's Chamber, had been published by Mr. Wilkinson Mater. Hieroglyph.\" We thus have a clear indication of the probable source of the cartouche inscribed by Hill in the very firs t chamber (Wellington's) found by Vyse (Fig. 146b). Having looked up Wilkinson's Materia Hieroglyphica, we can sympathize with Vyse and Hill: its text and presentation are d isorganized, and its plates reproducing cartouches are small, ill-copied and ba dly printed. Wilkinson appears to have been uncertain not only regarding t he reading of royal names, but also regarding the correct manner by whi ch hieroglyphs carved or sculpted on stone should be transcribed in linea r writing. The problem was most acute concerning the disk sign, whi ch on such monuments appeared as either a solid disk or as a void sphere , and in linear (or brushed-on) writing as a circle with a dot in i ts center . In his works, he transcribed the royal cartouches in quest ion in some instances as a solid disk, and in others as a circle with a dot in its center. Hill had followed Wilkinson's guidance. But all of these cartouches were of the Khnum variety. Timewise, it means that by Ma y 7 only the \"ram\" cartouches were inscribed. Then on May 27, when Cam pbell's Chamber was broken into, the vital and conclusive cartouche spelling Kh-u-f-u was found. How did the miracle happen? A clue is hidden in a suspicious segment in Vyse's chronicles, in an entry devoted to the fact that the casing stones \"did not show the slightest trace of inscription or of sculpture, nor, indeed, was any t o be found upon any stone belonging to the pyramid, or near it (with the exce ption of the quarry-marks already described).\" Vyse noted that there was one other exception: \"part of a cartouche of Suphis, engraved on a brown stone, s ix inches long by four broad. This fragment was dug out of the mound at th e northern side on June 2.\" Vyse reproduced a sketch of the fragment ( Fig. 148a). How did Vyse know—even before the communication fro m the British Museum—that this was \"part of a cartouche of Suphis ?\" Vyse would like us to believe it was because a week earlier (on May 27 ) he had found the complete cartouche (Fig. 148b) in Campbell's Chambe r. But here is the suspicious aspect. Vyse claims in t he above-quoted entry that the stone with the partial Khufu cartouche was found on June 2. Yet his entry is dated May 9! Vyse's manipulation of dates would have us believe that the partial cartouche found outside the pyrami d corroborated the earlier find of the complete cartouche inside the p yramid. But the dates suggest that it was the other way around: Vyse had already realized on May 9—a full eighteen days before the discovery of Campbell's Chamber—"},{"pageNumber":274,"pageContent":" Fig. 148 what the crucial cartouche had to look like. Someho w, on May 9, Vyse and Hill had realized that they had missed out on the c orrect name of Cheops. This realization could explain the frantic, daily c ommuting by Vyse and Hill to Cairo right after the discovery of Lady Arb uthnot's Chamber. Why they had left when so badly needed at the pyramids, the Chronicles do not state. We believe that the \"bombshell\" that hit the m was yet another, new work by Wilkinson, the three-volume Manners and Cus toms of the Ancient Egyptians. Published in London earlier that year (1 837), it must have reached Cairo right during those dramatic and tense days. And, neatly and clearly printed for a change, it reproduced in a ch apter on early sculptures both the ram cartouche which Vyse-Hill had already copied—and a new cartouche, one which Wilkinson read \"Shufu or Suphi s\" (Fig. 149). Wilkinson's new presentation must have shocked Vyse and Hill, because he appeared to have changed his mind regarding the ram cartouche (No. 2 in his Plate). He now read it \"Numba-khufu or Chemb es\" rather than \"Sen- Suphis.\" These names, he wrote, were found inscribe d in tombs in the vicinity of the Great Pyramid; and it was in cartou che la that \"we perceive Suphis, or, as the hieroglyphics wrote it, Shufu or Khufu, a name easily converted into Suphis or Cheops.\" So that was the c orrect name that had to be inscribed! Forging the Pharaoh's Name 273 Fig. 149"},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"274 The Stairway to Heaven For whom, then, did the ram cartouche (his fig. 2) stand? Explaining the difficulties of identification, Wilkinson admitted that he could not decide \"whether the first two names here introduced are bo th of Suphis, or if the second one is of the founder of the other pyramid.\" With this unsettling news, what were Vyse and Hill to do? Wilkinson's narrative gave them a lead, which they hurried to f ollow. The two names, he wrote on, \"occur again at Mount Sinai.\" Somewhat inaccurately—a fault common in his work—Wi lkinson was referring to hieroglyphic inscriptions found not ac tually at Mount Sinai, but in the Sinai's area of the turquoise mines. The ins criptions became known in those years due to the magnificently illustrated Voyage de l'Arabie Petrie in which Leon de Laborde et Linat described the Sin ai peninsula. Published in 1832, its drawings included reproducti ons of monuments and inscriptions in the wadi leading to the mining area , Wadi Maghara. There, Pharaoh after Pharaoh carved on the rocks mementoes of their achieve- ments in holding the mines against marauding Asiati cs. One such depiction (Fig. 150) included the two cartouches of which Wil kinson wrote. Vyse and Hill should have had little difficulty in locating a copy of de Laborde's Voyage in French-speaking Cairo. The part icular drawing seemed to answer Wilkinson's doubt: the same Pharao h appeared to have two names, one with the ram symbol and the other th at spelt out Kh-u-f-u. Thus, by May 9, Vyse-Hill-Perring had learned that one more cartouche was needed, and what it had to look like. When Campbell's Chamber was broken into on May 27, the three must have asked themselves: what are we waiting for? And so it was that the final conclusive cartouche appeared on the uppermost wall (Fig. 146a). Fame, if not fortune, was assured for Vyse; Mr. Hill, on his part, did not come out of the adventure empty-handed. Fig. 150"},{"pageNumber":276,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 275 How sure can we be of our accusations, a century an d a half after the event? Sure enough. For, as most forgers, Mr. Hill made, o n top of all the other embarrassments, one grave mistake: a mistake that n o ancient scribe could have possibly committed. As it turned out, both source books by which Vyse-H ill were guided (Wilkinson's Materia Hieroglyphica and then de Labo rde's Voyage) con- tained spelling errors; the unsuspecting team embod ied the errors in the pyramid's inscriptions. Samuel Birch himself pointed out in his report that the hieroglyph for Kh (the first consonant in the name Kh-u-f-u), which i s (representing pictorially a sieve), \"appears in Mr. Wilkinson's w ork without distinction from the solar disk.\" The Kh hieroglyph had to be e mployed in all the cartouches (spelling Khnem-Kh-u-f) which were inscr ibed in the two lower chambers. But the correct sieve symbol was not empl oyed even once. Instead, the consonant Kh was represented by the sy mbol for the Solar Disk: whoever inscribed these cartouches made the s ame error as Wilkin- son had made. . . . When Vyse and Hill got hold of de Laborde's book, i ts sketch only deepened the error. The rock carvings depicted by h im included the cartouche Kh-u-f-u on the right, and Khnum-kh-u-f o n the left. In both instances, de Laborde—who admitted to ignorance of hieroglyphics and who made no attempt to read the symbols—rendered th e Kh sign as a void circle (see Fig. 150). (The Kh symbol was correctly spelled in the rock carvings, as has been verified by all s cholarly authorities—viz. Lepsius in Denkmaler, Kurt Sethe i n Urkunden des Alten Reich, and The Inscriptions of Sinai by A. H. Gardi ner and T. E, Peet. De Laborde made another fateful error: He depicted as one Pharaoh's inscription, with two royal names, what were in eff ect two adjoining inscriptions, in different script styles, by two di fferent Pharaohs—as is clearly seen in Fig. 151). His depiction thus served to enhance Vyse's and Hil l's notion that the crucial cartouche of Kh-u-f-u should be inscribed i n the uppermost chamber with the symbol for the Solar Disk (146a). But in d oing so, the inscriber had employed the hieroglyphic symbol and phonetic sound for RA, the supreme god of Egypt! He had unwittingly spelled out not Kh nem-Khuf, but Khnem- Rauf; not Khufu, but Raufu. He had used the name of the great god incorrectly and in vain; it was blasphemy in ancien t Egypt. It was also an error inconceivable for an Egyptian scribe of the times of the Pharaohs. As monument after monument and inscri ption after inscrip- tion make clear, the symbol for Ra and the symbol for"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"276 The Stairway to Heaven Kh were always correctly employed—not only in differen t inscrip- tions, but also in the same inscription by the same scribe. And, therefore, the substitution of Ra for Kh was a n error that could not have been committed in the time of Khufu, nor of an y other ancient Pharaoh. Only a stranger to hieroglyphics, a strang er to Khufu, and a stranger to the overpowering worship of Ra, could h ave committed such a grave error. Added to all the other puzzling or inexplicable asp ects of the discovery reported by Vyse, this final mistake establishes co nclusively, we believe, that Vyse and his aides, not the original builders of the Great Pyramid, caused the red-painted markings to be inscribed. But, one may ask, was there no risk that outside vi sitors—such as the British and Austrian consuls, or Lord and Lady Arbu thnot—would notice that the inscriptions were so much fresher-looking than the masons' true markings? The question was answered at the time by one of the men involved, Mr. Perring, in his own volume on the sub ject (The Pyramids of Gizeh). The paint used for the ancient inscriptions , he wrote, was a \"composition of red ochre called by the Arabs moghr ah (which) is still in use.\" Not only was the same red ochre paint availab le, Perring stated, but \"such is the state of preservation of the marks in the quarries, that it is Fig. 151"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 277 difficult to distinguish the mark of yesterday from one of three thousand years.\" The forgers, in other words, were sure of their ink . Were Vyse and Hill—possibly with the tacit connivan ce of Perring— morally capable of perpetrating such a forgery? The circumstances of Vyse launching into this adven ture of discovery, his treatment of Caviglia, the chronology of events, hi s determination to obtain a major find as time and money were running out—bes peak a character capable of such a deed. As to Mr. Hill—whom Vyse en dlessly thanks in his foreword—the fact is that having been a copper mill employee when he first met Vyse, he ended up owning the Cairo Hotel when V yse left Egypt. And as to Mr. Perring, a civil engineer turned Egyptolo gist—well, let subse- quent events speak for themselves. For, encouraged by the success of one forgery, the Vyse team attempted one and probably t wo more. . . . All along, as the discoveries were being made in th e Great Pyramid, Vyse half-heartedly continued Caviglia's work in and aro und the other two pyramids. Encouraged by his newly won fame by the G reat Pyramid discoveries, Vyse decided to postpone his return to England and instead engage in concerted efforts to uncover the secrets of the other two pyramids. With the exception of red-painted markings on stone s, which experts from Cairo determined were from tombs or structures outside the pyramids and not from within the pyramids, nothing of import ance was found in the Second Pyramid. But inside the Third Pyramid, Vyse' s efforts paid off. At the end of July, 1837—as we have briefly mentioned earlier—his workmen broke into its \"sepulchral chamber,\" finding there a beautifully decorated but empty stone \"sarcophagus\" (Fig. 152). Arabic in scriptions on the walls and other evidence suggested this pyramid \"to have been much fre- quented,\" the floor stones of its chambers and pass ages \"worn and glazed over by the constant passing and repassing of a con course of people.\" Yet in this much frequented pyramid, and in spite o f the empty stone coffer, Vyse managed to find proof of its builder—a feat equaling the discovery within the Great Pyramid. In another rectangular chamber which Vyse called \"t he large apartment.\" great piles of rubbish were found, along with the t elltale scrawled Arabic- graffiti. Vyse at once concluded that this chamber \"was probably intended for funeral ceremonies, like those at Abou Simbel, Thebes, etc.\" When the rubbish was cleared out, the greater part of the lid of the sarcophagus was found . . . and close to it, fragments of the top of a mummy-case (inscri bed with hiero- glyphics, and amongst them, with the cartouche of M enkahre) were discovered upon a block of stone, together with par t of a skeleton,"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"27ft The Stairway to Heaven "},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 279 consisting of ribs and vertebrae, and the bones of the legs and feet enveloped in coarse woollen cloth of a yellow color . . . More of the board and cloth were afterwards taken o ut of the rubbish. It would therefore seem that, as the sarcophagus co uld not be removed, the wooden case containing the body had be en brought into the large apartment for examination. This, then, was the scenario outlined by Vyse: Cent uries earlier, Arabs had broken in the sepulchral chamber. They found th e sarcophagus and removed its lid. Inside there was a mummy within a wooden coffin—the mummy of the pyramid's builder. The Arabs removed c offin and mummy to the large apartment to examine them, breaking them in the process. Now Vyse found all these remains; and a cartouche on a fragment of the mummy- case (Fig. 153) spelled out \"Men-ka-ra\"—the very My cerinus of Herodotus. He proved the identity of the builders of both pyra mids! The sarcophagus was lost at sea during its transpor tation to England. But the mummy-case and bones reached safely the British Museum, where Samuel Birch could examine the actual inscription, rather than work from facsimiles (as was the case of the inscriptions wit hin the chambers in the Great Pyramid). He soon voiced his doubts: \"the cof fin of Mycerinus,\" he said, \"manifests considerable difference of style\" from monuments of the Fourth Dynasty. Wilkinson, on the other hand, accep ted the mummy-case as authentic proof of the identity of the builder o f the Third Pyramid; but Fig. 153"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"280 The Stairway to Heaven had doubts regarding the mummy itself: its cloth wr appings did not look to him as being of the claimed antiquity. In 1883, Gas ton Maspero concurred \"that the wooden coffer-cover of king Menchere is n ot of the Fourth Dynasty times;\" he deemed it a restoration carried out in the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty. In 1892, Kurt Sethe summed up the majority opinion, that the coffin-cover \"could have been fashioned only after Twentieth Dynasty times.\" As is now well known, both mummy-case and bones wer e not the remains of an original burial. In the words of I.E. S. Edwards (The Pyramids of Egypt), \"In the original burial chamber, Col. Vy se had discovered some human bones and the lid of a wooden anthropoid coff in inscribed with the name of Mycerinus. This lid, which is now in the Br itish Museum, cannot have been made in the time of Mycerinus, for it is of a pattern not used before the Saite Period. Radiocarbon tests have sho wn that the bones date from early Christian times.\" The mere statement negating the authenticity of the find does not, however, go to the core of the matter. If the remai ns were not of an original burial, then they must have been of an intrusive bu rial; but in such a case, mummy and coffin would be of the same period. This was not the case: here, someone had put together a mummy unearthed in one place, a coffin from another place. The unavoidable conclusion is t hat the find represented a deliberate archaeological fraud. Could the mismatching have been a coincidence—the g enuine remains within the pyramid of two intrusive burials, from d ifferent times? This must be doubted, in view of the fact that the coffin fra gment bore the cartouche of Men-ka-ra. This cartouche has been found on stat ues and in inscriptions all around the Third Pyramid and its temples (but n ot inside it), and it is probable that the coffin bearing the cartouche was also found in those surroundings. The coffin's attribution to later tim es stems not only from its- pattern, but also from the wording of the inscripti on: it is a prayer to Osiris from the Book of the Dead; its appearance on a Four th Dynasty coffin has been termed remarkable even by the trusting (yet kn owledgeable) Samuel Birch (Ancient History from the Monuments). Yet it need not have been \"a restoration,\" as some scholars have suggested, from the Twenty-sixth Dynasty. We know from the King List of Seti I from Abydos that the eighth Pharaoh of the Sixth Dynasty was also called Men-ka -ra, and spelled his name in a similar manner. It is clear, then, that someone had first found, in the vicinity of the pyramid, the coffin. Its importance was surely real ized, for—as Vyse himself has reported—he had found just a month prev iously the name of Men-ka-ra (Mycerinus) written in red paint on the r oof of the burial chamber of the middle one of the three small pyrami ds, south of the Third Pyramid. It must have been this find that gave the team the idea of creating a discovery within the Third Pyramid itself. . . . The credit for the discovery has been claimed by Vy se and Perring. How"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"Forging the Pharaoh's Name 281 could they have perpetrated the fraud, with or with out the help of Mr. Hill? Once again, Vyse s own chronicles hint at the truth . \"Not being present when they (the relics) were found,\" Col. Vyse wrote , he \"requested Mr. Raven, when that gentleman was in England, to write an account of the discovery\" as an independent witness. Somehow invit ed to be present at the right moment, Mr. H. Raven, who addressed Col. Vyse as \"Sir\" and signed the Letter of Evidence \"your most obedient s ervant,\" attested as follows: In clearing the rubbish out of the large entrance-r oom, after the men had been employed there several days and had advanc ed some distance towards the south-eastern corner, some bones were f irst discovered at the bottom of the rubbish; and the remaining bones and parts of the coffin were immediately discovered altogether: no other pa rts of the coffin or bones could be found in the room. I therefore had the rubbish, which had been previou sly turned out of the same room, carefully re-examined, when several pieces of the coffin and of the mummy-cloth were found; but In no other part of the pyramid were any parts of i t to be discovered, although every place was most minutely examined to make the coffin as complete as possible. We now get a better grasp of what had happened. For several days, workmen were clearing rubbish from the Large Apartm ent, piling it up nearby. Though carefully examined, nothing was foun d. Then, on the last day, as only the southeastern corner of the room re mained to be cleared, some bones and fragments of a wooden coffin were di scovered. \"No other parts of the coffin or bones could be discovered in the room.\" It was then wisely suggested that the rubbish which had been tu rned out of the room— a three-foot-high pile—be \"carefully re-examined\"—n ot examined, but RE- examined; and—lo and behold—more bones, and coffin fragments with the all-important cartouche, were found! Where were the remaining parts of the skeleton and coffin? \"Although every place was minutely examined to make the coffi n as complete as possible,\" nothing was found in any other part of t he pyramid. So, unless we are to believe that bones and coffin fragments w ere hauled away as souvenirs in centuries past, we can only assume tha t whoever hauled in the discovered parts, brought in just enough fragments to create the discovery: a complete coffin and a complete mummy were either unavailable, or too cumbersome to be smuggled in. Hailed for this second major discovery—he was soon thereafter promoted to the rank of general—Col. Vyse and Perring procee ded to produce at the site of Zoser's step pyramid a stone bearing Zoser' s name—written in red paint, of course.

(While most Egyptologists have accepted without fur ther investigation the claim that Khufu's name was inscribed in the Gr eat Pyramid, the works of Sir Alan Gardiner suggest that he had doubts on the subject. In his Egypt of the Pharaohs, he reproduced royal cartouches wit h a clear distinction between the hieroglyphs for Ra and Kh. The cartouch e of Cheops, he wrote, \"is found in various quarries, in the tombs of his kinfolk and nobles, and in certain writing of later date.\" Conspicuous by its absence in this list is the inscription in the Great Pyramid . . .

There is nothing left to contradict our contention that these three pyramids were built by the \"gods.\" On the contrary: everything about them suggests that they were not conceived by men for me n's use. We shall now proceed to show how they were part of the Guidance Grid that served the Spaceport of the Nefilim."},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"XIV The Gaze of the Sphinx In time, the pyramids of Giza were made part of the Landing Grid which had the peaks of Ararat as its focal point, incorpo rated Jerusalem as a Mission Control Center, and guided the space vehicl es to the Spaceport in the Sinai peninsula. But at first, the pyramids themselves had to serve as guiding beacons, simply by virtue of their location, alignment and s hape. All pyramids, as we have seen, were at their core step pyramids—emulati ng the ziggurats of Mesopotamia. But when the \"gods who came from heave n\" experimented with their scale model at Giza (the Third Pyramid), they may have found that the silhouette of the ziggurat and the shadow it cast upon the undulating rocks and ever-shifting sands were too b lurred and inaccurate to serve as a reliable Pointer-of-the-Way. By casing t he stepped core to achieve a \"true\" pyramid, and using white (light-re flecting) limestone for the casing, a perfect play of light and shadow was achieved, providing clear orientation. In 1882, as Robert Ballard was watching the Giza py ramids from his train window, he realized that one could determine his lo cation and direction by the ever-changing alignment between the pyramids (F ig. 154). Enlarging on this observation in The Solution of the Pyramid Problem, he also showed that the pyramids were aligned with each other in t he basic Pythagorean right-angled triangles, whose sides were proportion ate to each other as 3:4:5. Pyramidologists have also noticed that the s hadows cast by the pyramids could serve as a giant sundial, the direct ion and length of the shadows indicating time of year and of day. Even more important, however, was how the silhouett es and shadows of the pyramids appeared to an observer from the skies . As this aerial photograph shows (Fig. 155), the true shape of the pyramids casts arrow- like shadows, which serve as unmistakable direction pointers. When all was ready to establish a proper Spaceport, it required a much longer Landing Corridor than the one which served B aalbek. For their previous Spaceport in Mesopotamia, the Anunnaki (th e biblical Nefilim) chose the most conspicuous mountain in the Near Eas t—Mount Ararat—as their focal point. It should not be surpris ing that out of the same 283"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"284 The Stairtvay to Heaven Fig. 154 Fig. 155"},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"The Gaze of the Sphinx 285 considerations they again selected it as the focal point of their new Spaceport. Just as more \"coincidences\" of triangulation and ge ometrical perfection have been discovered in the construction and alignm ent of the Giza pyramids the more they have been examined and studi ed, so do we find endless \"coincidences\" of triangulation and alignme nt as we uncover the Landing Grid laid out by the Anunnaki. If the peaks of Ararat served as the focal point of the new Landing Corridor, then not o nly the northwestern line of the Landing Corridor, but also its southeas tern outline had to be focused on Ararat. But where was its other, Sinai e nd, anchored on? Mount St. Katherine lies amidst a massive core of s imilar, though somewhat lower, granite peaks. When the British Ord nance Survey Mission headed by the Palmers set out to survey the Sinai peninsula, they found that St. Katherine, even if the highest peak, did not stand out sufficiently to serve as a geodesic landmark. Inste ad, the Mission selected Mount Umm Shumar (Fig. 156), which at 8,534 feet is almost a twin in height of Mount St. Katherine (indeed, until the Or dnance Survey, many believed that Umm Shumar was the higher peak). Unli ke Katherine, Umm Shumar stands by itself, distinct and unmistakable. Both gulfs can be seen from its peak; its view to the west, northwest, sou thwest and east is unobstructed. It was for these reasons that the Pal mers without hesitation selected Mount Umm Shumar as their geodesic landmar k, the focal point for surveying and measuring the peninsula. Mount Katherine may have been suitable for a short Landing Corridor focused on Baalbek; but for the distant focal point of Ararat, a much more distinct and unmistakable landmark was required. We believe that for the Fig. 156"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"286 The Stairway to Heaven same reasons as the Palmers', the Anunnaki selected Mount Umm Shumar as the anchor of the southeastern outline of the ne w Landing Corridor. Much about this mount and its location is intriguin g. To begin with, its name—puzzling or highly significant—means \"Mother o f Sumer.\" It is a tide which was applied at Ur to Ningal, spouse of S in. . . . Unlike Mount St. Katherine, which lies at the cente r of Sinai's core of high granite peaks and can therefore be reached onl y with great difficulty, Mount Umm Shumar is situated at the edge of the mas s of granite. The sandy beaches there, on the Gulf of Suez, have seve ral natural hot springs. Was it there that Asherah spent her winters, residi ng \"by the sea?\" From there, it is really only \"a she-ass' ride\" away to Mount Umm Shumar—a ride so vividly described in the Ugaritic texts whe n Asherah went calling on El at his Mount. Just a few miles down the coast from the Hot Spring s is the peninsula's most important port city on these coasts—the port c ity of el-Tor. The name—another coincidence?—means \"The Bull\"; it was, as we have seen, an epithet of El (\"Bull El,\" the Ugaritic texts cal led him). The place has served as Sinai's most important gulf port from ear liest times; and we wonder whether it was not the Tilmun-city (as disti nct from Tilmun-land) spoken of in Sumerian texts. It could well have bee n the port which Gilgamesh planned to reach by ship, from where his comrade Enkidu could go to the nearby mines (in which he was doomed to s lave for the rest of his life); while he (Gilgamesh) could proceed to the \"L anding Place, where the Shems are raised.\" The peaks of the peninsula's granite core which fac e the Gulf of Suez bear names that make one stop and wonder. One mount bear s the name \"Mount of the Blessed Mother\"; closer to Mount Umm Shumar, Mount Teman (\"The Southern\") raises its head. The name brings b ack the verses of Habakuk: \"El from Teman shall come. . . . Covered a re the heavens with his halo; His splendor fills the Earth. . . . The W ord goes before him, sparks emanate from below; He pauses to measure the Earth. . . .\" Was the prophet referring to the mount that still b ears that very name— Teman—the southern neighbor of Mount \"Mother of Sum er?\" Since there is no other mountain bearing such a name, the ident ification seems more than plausible. Does Mount Umm Shumar fit into the Landing Grid and the network of sacred sites developed by the Anunnaki? We suggest that this mount substituted for Mt. Kath erine when the final Landing Corridor was worked out, acting as the anch or for the southeastern line of the Corridor which was focused on Ararat. B ut if so, where was the complementary anchor for the northwestern line? It is no coincidence, we suggest, that Heliopolis w as built where it was. It lies on the original Ararat-Baalbek-Giza line.

As we unfold the amazing network of natural and art ificial peaks that have been incorporated into the landing and communicatio ns grid of the Anunnaki, one must ponder whether they served as gu iding beacons by height and shape alone. Were they not also equipped with some kind of guidance instruments? When the two pairs of narrow conduits from the cham bers of the Great Pyramid were first discovered, they were thought to have served to lower food to the Pharaoh's attendants who were presumed to have been sealed alive in his tomb. When Vyse's team cleared the nor thern conduit to the \"King's Chamber,\" it was at once filled with cool a ir; the conduits have since been called \"air shafts.\" This, surprisingly, was challenged by respected scholars in a highly regarded academic pu blication (Mitteilungen des Instituts fur Orientforschung der Deutschen Aka demie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin). Although the academic es tablishment has been loath to digress from the \"pyramids as tombs\" theor y, Virginia Trimble and Alexander Badawy concluded in the Bulletin's 1964 i ssues that the \"air shafts\" had astronomical functions, having been \"be yond doubt inclined within 1° toward the circumpolar stars.\" Without doubting that the direction and inclination of the shafts must Fig. 157"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"288 The Stairway to Heaven have been premeditated, we are no less intrigued by the finding that once air flowed into the \"King's Chamber\", the temperatu re within it remained at a constant 68° Fahrenheit no matter what the wea ther outside was. All these findings seem to confirm the conclusions of E . F. Jomard (a member of Napoleon's team of scientists), who suggested th at the \"King's Chamber\" and its \"sarcophagus\" were not intended for burial, but as a depository of weight and measurement standards, which even in mod ern times are kept in a stable environment of temperature and moisture . Jomard could not have possibly imagined—back in 182 4—delicate space- guidance instruments, rather than mundane units of a meter and a kilogram. But we, of course, can. Many who have pondered the purpose of the intricate superstructure of five low compartments above the \"King's Chamber,\" b elieve they were built to relieve the pressure of the chamber. But t his has been achieved in the \"Queen's Chamber \" with an even greater mass of stone upon it, without such a series of \"relieving compartments.\" When Vyse and his men were inside the compartments, they were astonished to hear clearly every word spoken in other parts of the pyramid. When Fli nders Petrie (The Pyramids and the Temple of Gizeh) minutely examined the \"King's Chamber\" and the stone \"coffer\" within it, he found that both were built in accord with the dimensions of perfect Pythagorian t riangles. To cut the coffer out of a solid stone block, he estimated, a saw was needed with nine- foot blades whose teeth were diamond-tipped. To hol low it out, diamond- tipped drills were needed, applied with a pressure of two tons. How all this was achieved was beyond him. And what was the purpo se? He lifted the coffer to see whether it hid some aperture (it did not); when the coffer was struck, it emitted a deep, bell-like sound that rev erberated throughout the pyramid. This bell-like quality of the coffer was r eported by earlier investigators. Were the \"King's Chamber\" and its \"c offer\" meant, then, to serve as sound-emitters or echo-chambers? Even nowadays, landing guidance equipment at airpor ts emits electronic signals which instruments in an approaching aircraf t translate into a pleasant buzz if on course; it changes into an alarming beep if the plane veers off course. We can safely assume that, as soon as possi ble after the Deluge, new guidance equipment was brought down to Earth. T he Egyptian depiction of the Divine Cordholders (Fig. 121) indi cates that \"Stones of Splendor\" were installed at both anchor-points of t he Landing Corridor; our guess is that the purpose of the various chambers w ithin the pyramid was to house such guidance and communications equipment.

The Ugaritic texts invariably employed the phrase \" penetrate the Shad of El\" when describing the coming of other gods unto t he presence of El \"within his seven chambers.\" This implied that thes e chambers were inside the mountain—as were the chambers inside the artifi cial mountain of the Great Pyramid."},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"The Gaze of the Sphinx 289 Historians of the first Christian centuries reporte d that the people who dwelt in the Sinai and its bordering areas of Pales tine and North Arabia worshipped the god Dushara (\"Lord of the Mountains' ) and his spouse Allat, \"Mother of the Gods.\" They were of course th e male El and the female Elat, his spouse Asherah. The sacred object of Dushara was, fortunately, depicted on a coin struck by the Roman governor of those provinces (Fig. 158). Curiously, it resembles the e nigmatic chambers within the Great Pyramid—an inclined stairway (\"Asc ending Gallery\") leading to a chamber between massive stones (\"The K ing's Chamber\"). Above it, a series of stones re-create the pyramid' s \"relieving chambers.\" Since the Ascending Passages of the Great Pyramid—w hich are unique to it—were plugged tight when Al Mamoon's men broke in to it, the question is: Who, in antiquity, did know, and emulated, the inner construction within the pyramid? The answer can only be: the arc hitects and builders of the Great Pyramid, who possessed such knowledge. On ly they could duplicate such construction elsewhere—at Baalbek or within the mountain of El.

They were the mountains that, by their sheer height and location, and by virtue of the instrumen ts installed within them, served as beacons for the \"Riders of the Clouds.\" When the first Spaceport was established in Mesopot amia, the flight path was along a center line, drawn precisely in the mid dle of the arrow-like landing corridor. While guiding beacons flickered t heir lights and emitted their signals along the two border lines, it was al ong the central flight path that Mission Control Center was located: the hub of all the communications and guidance equipment, the place where all the com puterized information regarding planetary and spacecraft orbits was store d.

Within this \"lofty house\" of Enlil, there was a hid den, mystery-filled chamber called the DIR.GA—literally meaning \"dark, crown-like cham- ber.\" Its descriptive name brings so much to mind t he hidden, mystifying \"King's Chamber\" in the Great Pyramid. In the DIR.G A, Enlil and his assistants kept the vital \"Tablets of Destinies\" on which orbital and space- flight information was stored.

As to w ho Shaletn might have been, scholars have offered various theories; some of them (per Benjamin Mazar in \"Jerusalem before the David Kingship\") nam e Enlil's grandson Shamash; others prefer Enlil's son Ninib. In all th eories, however, the association of Jerusalem's roots with the Mesopotam ian pantheon is undisputed. From its beginnings, Jerusalem encompassed three mo untain peaks; from north to south, they were Mount Zophim, Mount Moriah and Mount Zion. Their names bespoke their functions: The nort hernmost was the \"Mount of Observers\" (it is now called in English M ount Scopus); the middle one was the \"Mount of Directing\"; the southe rnmost was \"The Mount of the Signal.\" They are still so called in s pite of the passage of millenia. The valleys of Jerusalem too bear telltale names an d epithets. One of them is named in Isaiah the Valley of Hizzayon, the \"Valley of Vision.\" The Valley of Kidron was known as the \"Valley of Fire.\" In the Valley of Hinnom (the Gehenna of the Greek New Testament), according to millennia-old legends, there was an entrance to the subterranean world, marked by a column of smoke rising between two palm trees. And the Valley of Repha'im was named after the Divine Healers who, ac cording to the Ugaritic texts, were put in the charge of the godde ss Shepesh. Aramaic translations of the Old Testament called them \"Hero es\"; the Old Testa- ment's first translation into Greek called the plac e the Valley of the Titans. Of the three Mounts of Jerusalem, that of Moriah ha s been the most sacred. The Book of Genesis explicitly states that it was to one of the peaks of Moriah that the Lord directed Abraham with Isaac , when Abraham's fidelity was tested. Jewish legends relate that Abr aham recognized Mount Moriah from a distance, for he saw upon it \"a pilla r of fire reaching from the earth to heaven, and a heavy cloud in which the Glo ry of God was seen.\" This language is almost identical with the biblical description of the descent of the Lord upon Mount Sinai. The large horizontal platform atop Mount Moriah—rem iniscent in layout of the one at Baalbek, though much smaller—has been called \"The Temple Mount,\" for it had served as the site of the Jewish Temple of Jerusalem (Fig. 159). It is now occupied by several Muslim sh rines, the most renowned of which is the Dome of the Rock. The dome was carried off by the Caliph Abd al-Malik (seventh century A . D .) from Baalbek, where it adorned a Byzantine shrine; it was erected by the c aliph as a roofing over an eight-sided structure he had built to encompass the Sacred Rock: a huge rock to which divine and magical faculties have bee n attributed from time immemorial. Muslims believe that it was from the Sacred Rock th at their prophet Muhammed was taken aloft to visit Heaven. According to the Koran, Muhammed was taken by the angel Gabriel from Mecca to Jerusalem, with a stopover at Mount Sinai. Then he was taken aloft by the angel, ascending"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":" Fig. 159 heavenward via a \"Ladder of Light.\" Passing through the Seven Heavens, Muhammed at last stood in the presence of God. Afte r receiving divine instructions, he was brought back to Earth via the same beam of light, landing back at the Sacred Rock. He returned to Mec ca, again with a stopover at Mount Sinai, riding the angel's winged horse. Travelers in the Middle Ages suggested that the Sac red Rock was a huge artificially-cut cube-like rock whose corners faced precisely the four points of the compass. Nowadays, only the top outcropping of the rock can be seen; the presumption of its hidden great cube-like shape may have stemmed from the Muslim tradition that the hallowed Great Stone of Mecca, the Qa'aba, was fashioned (on divine instruc tions) after the Sacred Rock of Jerusalem. From the visible portion, it is evident that the Sa cred Rock had been cut out in various ways on its face and sides, bored th rough to provide two tube-like funnels, and hollowed out to create a sub terranean tunnel and secret chambers. No one knows the purpose of these works; no one knows who had masterminded them and carried them out. We do know, however, that the First Temple was buil t by King Solomon upon Mount Moriah at an exact spot and following pr ecise instructions provided by the Lord. The Holy-of-Holies was built upon the Sacred Rock; its innermost chamber, completely gilded, was taken up by two large Gherubim (winged Sphinx-like beings) also made of g old, their wings touching the walls and each other's; between them w as placed the Ark of the Testament, from within which the Lord addressed Moses in the desert. Completely insulated from the outside, the gold cov ered Holy-of-Holies was called in the Old Testament the Dvir—literally, \"The Speaker.\" The suggestion that Jerusalem was a \"divine\" commun ication center, a"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"The Gaze of the Sphinx 293 place where a \"Stone of Splendor\" was secreted, and from which the Word or Voice of the Lord was beamed far and wide, is no t as preposterous as it may sound. The notion of such communication was not at all alien to the Old Testament. In fact, the possession by the Lord of such a capability, and the selection of Jerusalem as the communications ce nter, were considered to be attestations of Yahweh's and Jerusalem's supr emacy. \"I shall answer the Heavens, and they shall respond to Earth,\" the Lord assured the Prophet Hosea. Amos prophesied that \"Ya hweh from Zion will roar; from Jerusalem His voice shall be uttered.\" A nd the Psalmist stated that when the Lord shall speak out of Zion, His pro nouncements will be heard from one end of Earth to another, and in Heav en too: Unto the gods Yahweh hath spoken, And the Earth He had called from the east to the west . . . The Heavens above He will call, and unto the Earth. Ba'al, the Lord of the facilities at Baalbek, had b oasted that his voice could be heard at Kadesh, the gateway city to the P recinct of the gods in the \"Wilderness\" of central Sinai. Psalm 29, listing so me of the places on Earth reachable by the Voice of the Lord of Zion, include d both Kadesh and \"the cedar place\" (Baalbek): The voice of the Lord is upon the waters . . . The voice of the Lord the cedars breaks . . . The voice of the Lord in the Wilderness shall reson ance: Yahweh the Wilderness of Kadesh shall make shudder. The capabilities acquired by Ba'al when he installe d the \"Stones of Splendor\" at Baalbek were described in the Ugaritic texts as the ability to put \"one lip to Earth, one lip to Heaven.\" The symb ol for these communication devices, as we have seen, were the do ves. Both symbolism and terminology are incorporated in the verses of P salm 68, which describe the flying arrival of the Lord: Sing unto the Lord, chant unto His Shem, Make way for the Rider of the Clouds . . . The Lord the Word will utter, the Oracles of an army vast.

The Jerusalem Stone of Splendor—a \"testament stone\" or \"probing stone\" in the words of the Prophets—was secreted in a subterranean chamber. This we learn from a lamentation over the desolation of Jerusalem, when the Lord was wroth with its people: The palace was abandoned by the townspeople; Forsaken is the peak of Mount Zion (and) the \"Prober Which Witnesses.\" The Cavern of Eternal Witnessing is the frolicking place of wild asses, a grazing place of flocks. With the restoration of the Temple in Jerusalem, th e Prophets promised, \"the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem shall issue.\" Je rusalem would be re- established as a world center, sought by all the na tions. Conveying the Lord's promise, Isaiah reassured the people that no t only the \"probing stone,\" but also the \"measuring\" functions would be restored: Behold, I shall firmly set a Stone in Zion, a Probing Stone, a rare and lofty Stone of Corners, its foundation (firmly) founded. He who hath faith, shall not remain unanswered. Justice shall be my Cord; Righteousness (shall be) my Measure. To have served as a Mission Control Center, Jerusal em—as Nippur—had to be located on the long central line bisecting th e Landing Corridor. Its hallowed traditions affirm such a position, and the evidence suggests that it was that sacred rock which marked the precise geode sic center. Jerusalem was held by Jewish traditions to have bee n the \"Navel of the Earth.\" The Prophet Ezekiel referred to the people of Israel as \"residing upon the Navel of the Earth\"; the Book of Judges re lated an incident when people were coming down the mountains from the dire ction of the \"Navel of the Earth.\" The term, as we have seen, meant tha t Jerusalem was a focal communications center, from which \"cords\" were draw n to other anchor points of the Landing Grid, It was thus no coincide nce that the Hebrew word for the sacred rock was Eben Sheti'yah—a term which Jewish sages held to have meant \"stone from which the world was woven.\" The term sheti is indeed a weaving term, standing for the l ong cord that runs"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"The Gaze of the Sphinx 295 lengthwise in a loom (the warp, which is crossed wi th the shorter weft).

The decisive answer is: Yes. Jerusalem lies precise ly on that line! As was the case with the pyramids of Giza, so do we uncover in the case of the Divine Grid more and more amazing alignments and triangulations. Jerusalem, we find, also lies precisely where the B aalbek-Katherine line intersects the flight path's central line based on Ararat. Heliopolis, we find, is precisely equidistant from Jerusalem as Mount Umm Shumar. And the diagonals drawn from Jerusalem to Heliopoli s and to Umm Shumar form an accurate 45° right angle (Fig. 160)!

Jerusalem, the Book of Jubilees held, was in fact o ne of four \"Places of the Lord\" on Earth: \"the Garden of Eternity\" in the Ced ar Mountain; \"the Mountain of the East\" which was Mount Ararat; Mount Sinai and Mount Zion. Three of them were in the \"lands of Shem,\" th e son of Noah from whom the biblical Patriarchs were descended; and th ey were intercon- nected: The Garden of Eternity, the most sacred, is the dwelling of the Lord; And Mount Sinai, in the center of the desert; And Mount Zion, the center of the Navel of the Eart h. These three were created as holy places, FACING EACH OTHER. Somewhere along the \"Line of Jerusalem,\" the centra l flight line that was anchored on Mount Ararat, the Spaceport itself had to be located. There, too, the final beacon had to be located: \"Mount Sin ai, in the center of the desert.\" It is here, we suggest, that the dividing line whic h we now call the Thirtieth Parallel (north) had come into play. We know from Sumerian astronomical texts that the s kies enveloping Earth were so divided as to separate the northern \" way\" (allotted to Enlil) from the southern \"way\" (allotted to Ea) with a wid e central band considered the \"Way of Anu.\" It is only natural to assume that a dividing line between the two rival brothers should also hav e been established after the Deluge, when the settled Earth was divided into the Four Regions; and that, as in pre-Diluvial times, the Thirtieth Paral lels (north and south) served as demarcation lines. Was it mere coincidence, or a deliberate compromise between the two brothers and their feuding descendants, that in eac h of the three regions given to Mankind, the sacred city was located on th e Thirtieth Parallel? The Sumerian texts state that \"When Kingship was lo wered from Heaven\" after the Deluge, \"Kingship was in Eridu.\" Eridu was situated astride the Thirtieth Parallel as close to it as th e marshy waters of the Persian Gulf had permitted. While the administrativ e-secular center of Sumer shifted from time to time, Eridu remained a s acred city for all time. In the Second Region (the Nile Civilization) the se cular capital also shifted from time to time. But Heliopolis forever r emained the sacred city.

The dual or paired shrines played a major role in t he Pharaonic succession. During the rites, conducted by the Shem priest, the crowning of the new king and his admission to the \"Place of the Guardians\" in Heliopolis coincided with the departure of the dece ased king's spirit, through the eastern False Door, to the \"Coming-fort h Place of Old.\" And Heliopolis was located astride the Thirtieth Pa rallel, as close to it as the Nile's delta permitted! When the Third Region, the Indus Valley Civilizatio n, followed, its secular center was on the shores of the Indian Ocea n; but its sacred city— Harappa—was hundreds of miles away to the north—rig ht on the Thirtieth Parallel. The imperative of the northern Thirtieth Parallel a ppears to have continued in the millennia that followed. Circa 600 B.C., the Persian kings augmented the royal capital with a city \"Sacred unt o all Nations.\" The place selected for its construction was a remote and unin habited site. There, literally in the middle of nowhere, a great horizon tal platform was laid out. Upon it, palaces with magnificent staircases and ma ny auxiliary shrines and structures were erected—all honoring the God of the Winged Globe (Fig. 161). The Greeks called the place Persepolis (\"City of the Persians\"). No people lived there: It was only to celebrate the Ne w Year on the day of the spring equinox that the king and his retinue came t here. Its remains still stagger the viewer. And it was located astride the Thirtieth Parallel. No one knows for sure when Lhasa in Tibet—the sacre d city of Buddhism—was founded. But it is a fact that Lhasa t oo—as Eridu, Heliopolis, Harappa and Persepolis were—was situate d on the same Thirtieth Parallel (Fig. 162). The sanctity of the Thirtieth Parallel must be trac ed back to the origins of the Sacred Grid, when the divine measurers determin ed the location of the pyramids of Giza also on the Thirtieth Parallel. Co uld the gods have given up this \"sanctity\" or neutrality of the Thirtieth P arallel when it came to their most vital installation—the Spaceport—in thei r own Fourth Region, in the Sinai peninsula? It is here that we ought to seek a final clue from the remaining enigma of Giza—its Great Sphinx. Its body is that of a crouch ing lion, its head of a man wearing the royal headdress (Fig. 163). When an d by whom was it erected? And to what purpose? Whose image does it b ear? And why is it where it is, alone, and nowhere else? The questions have been many, the answers very few.

An inscription by th e notorious emperor Nero called the Sphinx \"Armachis, Overseer and Savi or.\" Because the Great Sphinx is situated near the cause way leading to the Second Pyramid, the best idea scholars had to offer was that it was built by Chefra, the \"builder\" of the Second Pyramid; and th at it must therefore bear his image. This notion is devoid of any factua l basis; yet it has persisted in textbooks, although as far back as 1904 E. A, Wa llis Budge, then Keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the Bri tish Museum, concluded unequivocally (The Gods of the Egyptians) that \"thi s marvellous object was in existence in the days of Kha-f-ra, or Khephren; and it is probable that it is a very great deal older than his reign and that it dates from the end of the archaic period.\" As the \"Inventory Stela\" attests, the Sphinx had al ready stood at Giza in the time of Khufu, a predecessor of Chefra. Like se veral Pharaohs after him, so did Khufu take credit for removing the sand that encroached upon the Sphinx. From this it must be deduced that the S phinx was already an olden monument in Khufu's time. What earlier Pharao h, then, had erected it, implanting upon it his own image? The answer is that the image is not of any Pharaoh, but of a god; and that in all probability, the gods and not a mortal king had erected the Sphinx. Indeed, only by ignoring what the ancient inscripti ons had stated, could anyone assume otherwise. A Roman inscription, calli ng the Sphinx \"Sacred Guide,\" said of it: \"Thy formidable form is the wor k of the Immortal Gods.\" A Greek adolatory poem read in part: Thy formidable form, Here the Immortal Gods have shaped. . . . As a neighbor to the Pyramids they placed thee. . . . A heavenly monarch who his foes defies. . . . Sacred Guide in the Land of Egypt. In the Inventory Stela, Khufu called the Sphinx \"Gu ardian of the Aeter, who guides the Winds with his gaze.\" It was, as he clearly wrote, the image of a god: This figure of the god will exist to eternity; Always having its face watching towards the east. In his inscription, Khufu mentions that a very old sycamore tree that grew near the Sphinx was damaged \"When the Lord of Heaven descended upon the Place of Hor-em-Akhet,\" \"the Falcon-god of the Horizon.\" This, indeed was the most frequent name of the Sphinx in Pharaonic inscriptions;"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"302 The Stairway to Heaven his other epithets being Ruti (\"The Lion\") and Hul (meaning, perhaps, \"The Eternal\"). Nineteenth-century excavators of the site of the Sp hinx, records show, were prompted by local Arab lore that held that the re existed, under or within the Sphinx, secret chambers holding ancient treasures or magical objects, Caviglia, as we have seen, exerted himself within the Great Pyramid in search of a \"hidden chamber;\" it appears that he had switched to the pyramid having failed to find such a chamber at the site of the Sphinx. Perring too made the attempt, by cutting forcibly a deep hole in the back of the Sphinx. Even more responsible researchers, such as Auguste Mariette in 1853, shared the general opinion that there is a hidden c hamber concealed in or under the Sphinx. This belief was bolstered by the writings of the Roman historian Pliny, who reported that the Sphinx \"cont ained the tomb of a ruler named Harmakhis,\" and by the fact that nearly all a ncient depictions of the Sphinx show it crouching atop a stone structure. Th e searchers have surmised that if the Sphinx itself could have been almost hidden from sight by the encroaching sands, so much so could the sand s of desert and time completely hide any substructure. The most ancient inscriptions seem to suggest that there indeed existed not one, but two secret chambers under the Sphinx—p erhaps reachable through an entrance hidden under the paws of the mo nument. A hymn from the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty, moreover, reveals that the two \"caverns\" under the Sphinx enabled it to serve as a communications center! The god Amen, the inscription said, assuming the fu nctions of the heavenly Hor-Akhti, attained \"perception in his hea rt, command on his lips . . . when he enters the two caverns which are unde r his [the Sphinx's] feet.\" Then, A message is sent from heaven; It is heard in Heliopolis, and is repeated in Memphis by the Fair of Face.

In a long inscription on a stela (Fig. 166) erected between the paws of t he Sphinx by Thothmes IV (and dedicated to the emblem of the Winged Disk) , the king related that the Sphinx spoke to him and promised him a long and prosperous reign if only he would remove the sands that encroached upon his (the Sphinx's) limbs.

Indeed, the Pyramid Texts and the Book of the Dead refer to the Sphinx as \"The Great God who opens the Gates of Earth\"—a p hrase that may suggest that the Sphinx at Giza, which \"led the way ,\" had a counterpart near the Stairway to Heaven, who opened there \"the Gates of Earth.\" Such a possibility is perhaps the only explanation (in t he absence of any other to date) of a very archaic depiction of the Pharaoh's Journey to the Afterlife (Fig. 167).

There, Paraemheb had seen the King of the Gods ascend by day; the words are almost identical to those of Gilgamesh, arriving at Mount Mashu, \"where daily the Shems he watched, as they depart and come in . . . watched o ver Shamash as he ascends and descends.\" It was the Protected Place, the Place of Ascent. Th ose who were to reach it were guided there by the Sphinx; for its gaze le d eastward, exactly along the Thirtieth Parallel. It was where the two lines intersected, we suggest— where the Line of Jerusalem intersected the Thirtieth Parallel that t he Gates of Heaven and Earth were located: the Spaceport of the gods. The intersection is located within the Sinai's Cent ral Plain. As the Duat was depicted in the Book of the Dead, the Central P lain is indeed an oval plain encompassed by mountains. It is a vast valley whose surrounding mountains are separated by seven passes—as describe d in the Book of Enoch; a vast flat plain whose hard natural surface provided ready-made runways for the shuttlecraft of the Anunnaki."},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"306 The Stairway to Heaven Nippur, we have shown (see Fig. 122), was the focal point, the bulls-eye of concentric circles which measured off as equidis tant the Spaceport at Sippar and other vital installations and sites. The same, we find not without amazement, held true for Jerusalem (Fig. 168): • The Spaceport (SP) and the Landing Place at Baalbek (BK) lay on the perimeter of an inner circle, forming a vital team of installations that were equidistant from the Control Center in Jerusal em (JM); • The geodesic beacon of Umm Shumar (US) and the beac on of Heliopolis (HL) lay on the perimeter of an outer ci rcle, making them too a pair equidistant from Jerusalem. As we fill in our chart, the masterful Grid conceiv ed by the Anunnaki unfolds before our very eyes; and we are truly asto unded by its precision, simple beauty, and the artful combination of basic geometry with the landmarks provided by nature: • The Baalbek-Katherine line, and the Jerusalem-Helio polis line, inter- sected each other at the basic and precise angle of 45°; the central flight path bisected this angle into two precise angles of 22 1/2 0 each; the grand Flight Corridor was in turn precisely half that (11 1/4 0 ); • The Spaceport, situated at the intersection of the central flight path and the Thirtieth Parallel, was equidistant from Heliop olis and Umm Shumar. Was it only an accident of geography that Delphi (D L) was equidistant from Mission Control in Jerusalem and from the Spac eport in central Sinai? Mere coincidence that the angular width of the (Fli ght?) corridor so created was 11 1/4 0 ? That another Flight Corridor of 11 1/4 0 connected Delphi with Baalbek (BK)? Or only chance that the lines connecting Delphi wit h Jerusalem and the oasis of Siwa (SW)—the site of Amnion's oracle to w hich Alexander had rushed—formed once again the angle of 45° (Fig. 169 )? Were other sacred cities and oracle sites in Egypt, such as the great Thebes and Edfu, located where they were at a king' s whim, at an attractive bend of the Nile—or where alignments of the Grid ha d dictated? Indeed, were we to study all these sites, all of Ea rth would probably be encompassed. But was that not what Ba'al had alread y known when he established his clandestine facilities at Baalbek? For his aim. we recall, was to communicate with and dominate, not just the near by lands, but all of Earth. This the biblical Lord too must have known; for whe n Job sought to unravel the \"wonders of El,\" the Lord \"answered him from within the whirlpool,\" and countered questions with questions:"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":" Fig. 168 Let me ask thee, and answer thou me: Where wast thou, when the Earth's foundation I laid out?

All these acts of Earth measuring, the laying out of platforms, the setting up of the Stone of Corners were done, He said: When the morning stars rejoiced together And all the sons of the gods shouted for joy. Man, as wise as he might have been, had no hand in all that. Baalbek, the Pyramids, the Spaceport—all were meant for the gods alone. But Man, ever searching for Immortality, has never ceased to follow the gaze of the Sphinx.
