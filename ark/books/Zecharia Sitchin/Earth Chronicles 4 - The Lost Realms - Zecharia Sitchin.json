But little did the conquistadores realize that they wer e only replay- ing a search, on Earth and in these new lands, that had taken place eons earlier! Buried under the records and tales of avarice, plund er, and wanton destruction that the newly found riches had triggered, there is also evidence in the chronicles of that ti me of how be- wildered the Europeans had been to come upon civili zations that were so akin to those of the Old World: kingdo ms and royal courts, cities and sacred precincts, art and poetry , sky-high tem- ples, priests—and the symbol of the cross and a bel ief in a Cre- ator of All. Last but not least, there were the leg ends of white and bearded gods who had left but did promise to re turn. The mysteries and enigmas of the Maya, the Aztecs, the Incas, and their predecessors that puzzled the conq uistadores still baffle scholar and layman alike five centurie s later. How, when, and why did such great civilizations ari se in the New World, and is it mere coincidence that the more that is known about them, the more they appear to have been molded after the civilizations of the ancient Near East? It is our contention that the answers can be found only by accepting as fact, not as myth, the presence on Ear th of the Anunnaki, \"Those Who From Heaven to Earth Came.\" This book offers the evidence. 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1 EL DORADO Nowadays Toledo is a quiet provincial city situated about an hour's drive south of Madrid; yet hardly does a vis itor to Spain miss seeing it, for within its walls there have bee n preserved the monuments of diverse cultures and the lessons of hi story. Its beginnings, local legends tell, go back two mil lennia be- fore the Christian era and its foundation is attribu ted to the biblical descendants of Noah. Its name, many hold, comes from the Hebrew Toledoth (\"Generational Histories\"); its olden homes and magnificent houses of worship bear witnes s to the Christianization of Spain—the rise and fall of the M oors and their Moslem dominion and the uprooting of the sple ndid Jew- ish heritage. For Toledo, for Spain, and for all other lands, 149 2 was a pivotal year, for a triple history was made therein . All three events took place in Spain, a land geographically k nown as \"Iberia\"—a name for which the only explanation can be found in the term Ibri (\"Hebrew\") by which its earliest s ettlers might have been known. Having lost the greater part of Ib eria to the Moslems, the warring splintered kingdoms in the pen insula saw their first major union when Ferdinand of Aragon an d Isabella of Castile married in 1469. Within ten years of the union they launched a military campaign to roll back the Moors and bring Spain under the banner of Catholicism; in January 14 92 the Moors were decisively defeated with the fall of Gra nada, and Spain was made a Christian land. In March of that sa me year, the king and queen signed an edict for the expulsio n from Spain, by July 31 of that year, of all Jews who wou ld not convert to Christianity by that time. And on August 3 of tha t same year, Christopher Columbus—Cristobal Colon to the Spaniards— sailed under the Spanish flag to find a western rou te to India. He sighted land on October 12, 1492. He returned to Spain in January 1493. As proof of his success he brought back four 3"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"4 THE LOST REALMS \"Indians\"; as corroboration of his contention that a larger, sec- ond expedition under his command was justified, he brought with him a collection of golden trinkets obtained f rom the na- tives and tales of a city, a golden city, where the people wore golden bracelets on their arms and legs and-adorned their necks and ears and noses with gold, all this gold coming from a fabu- lous mine near that city. Of the first gold thus brought to Spain from the ne w lands, Isabella—so pious that they called her \"The Catholic \"—or- dered that an elaborate Custody be fashioned, and pr esented it to the Cathedral of Toledo, traditional seat of Spai n's Catholic hierarchy. And so it is that nowadays, when a visit or to the cathedral is taken to see its Treasury—a room prote cted by heavy grillwork and filled with the precious object s donated to the Church over the centuries—one can see, though no t touch, the very first gold brought back by Columbus. It is now recognized that there had been much more to the voyage than a search for a new route to India. Stro ng evidence suggests that Columbus was a Jew forced into convers ion; his financial backers, likewise converted, could have s een in the enterprise an avenue of escape to freer lands. Ferd inand and Isabella had visions of the discovery of the rivers of Paradise and everlasting youth. And Columbus himself had sec ret ambi- tions, only some of which he expressed in his perso nal diaries. He saw himself as the fulfiller of ancient prophesi es regarding a new age that shall begin with the discovery of new lands \"at the extremity of the Earth.\" But he was realistic enough to recognize that of all the infor- mation he had brought back from the first voyage, t he mention of gold was the attention-getter. Asserting that \"t he Lord would show him\" the enigmatic place \"where gold is born,\" he suc- ceeded in persuading Ferdinand and Isabella to prov ide him with a much larger fleet for a second voyage, then a third. By then, however, the monarchs sent along various admi nistrators and men known for less vision but more action, who supervised and interfered with the admiral's operations and de cisions. The inevitable conflicts culminated in the return of Col umbus to Spain in chains, on the pretext that he had mistrea ted some of his men. Although the king and queen at once releas ed him and offered him monetary compensation, they agreed with the view that Columbus was a good admiral but a bad governor— and clearly one who could not force out of the Indians the true loca- tion of the City of Gold."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"El Dorado 5 Columbus countered all that with yet more reliance o n an- cient prophecies and biblical quotes. He collected all the texts into a book, The Book of Prophecies, which he presen ted to the king and queen. It was meant to convince them that Spain was destined to reign over Jerusalem, and that Columbus was the one chosen to achieve that by being the first to fi nd the place where gold is born. Themselves believers in the Scriptures, Ferdinand a nd Isa- bella agreed to let Columbus sail once more, convinc ed espe- cially by his argument that the mouth of the river (now called the \"Orinoco\") that he had discovered was that of o ne of the four rivers of Paradise; and as the Scriptures had stated, one of those rivers encompassed the land of Havila. \"whenc e the gold came.\" This last voyage encountered more hardships and heart- breaks than any of the previous three. Crippled with arthritis, a ghost of his old self, Col umbus re- turned to Spain on November 7, 1504. Before the mont h was out, Queen Isabella died; and although King Ferdina nd still had a soft spot for Columbus, he decided to let others a ct on the last memorandum prepared by Columbus, in which he compile d the evidence for the presence of a major gold source in the new lands. \"Hispaniola will furnish your invincible majesties with all the needed gold,\" Columbus assured his royal sponsors re garding the island that is nowadays shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic. There, Spanish settlers using local Indian s as slave labor, indeed succeeded in mining gold in fabulous quantities: in less than two decades the Spanish treasury received from Hi- spaniola gold equivalent to 500,000 ducats. As it turned out, the Spanish experience in Hispani ola was to repeat itself over and over again across an immense continent. Within those two short decades, as the natives died out or fled and the gold veins were exhausted, the Spaniards' e uphoria turned to disappointment and despair, and they grew ever more audacious in landing on ever more unknown coasts in search of riches. One of the early destinations was the penin sula of Yuca- tan. The very first Spaniards there, in 1511, were survivors of a shipwreck; but in 1517 a purposeful convoy of three ships under Francisco Hernandez de Cordoba sailed to Yucatan fr om Cuba for the purpose of procuring slave labor. To their amazement they came upon stone buildings, temples, and idols of god- desses; to the misfortune of the local inhabitants (whom the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"6 THE LOST REALMS Spaniards understood to have called themselves \"May a\") the Spaniards also \"found certain objects of gold, whic h they took.\" The record of the Spanish arrival at and the conque st of Yu- catan is primarily based on the report titled Relaci on de las cosas de Yucatan written by Friar Diego de Landa in 1566 (the English translation by William Gates is titled Yuca tan, Before and After the Conquest). Hernandez and his men, Dieg o de Landa reported, saw on this expedition a large step -pyramid, idols and statues of animals, and a large inland ci ty. However, the Indians they tried to capture put up a fierce f ight, un- daunted even by the cannon fire from the ships. The heavy ca- sualties—Hernandez himself was badly wounded—forced a retreat. Yet, on his return to Cuba, Hernandez recom mended further expeditions, for \"that land was good and ri ch, because of its gold.\" A year later another expedition left Cuba for Yucata n. They landed on the island of Cozumel and discovered New S pain, Panuco and the province of Tabasco (having thus nam ed the new places). Armed with a variety of goods for bart er and not only with weapons, the Spaniards this time met both hostile and friendly Indians. They saw more stone edifices and monuments, felt the sting of arrows and spears tipped with sha rp obsidian stone, and examined artfully made objects. Many wer e made of stone, common or semiprecious; others shined as gol d, but on close examination proved to be of copper. There wer e, contrary to expectations, very few gold objects; and there w ere abso- lutely no mines or other sources for gold, or any o ther metals, in the land. Where then had the gold, as little as there was, co me from? They obtain it by trading, the Mayas said. It comes from the northwest: there, in the land of the Aztecs, it is plentiful and abundant. The discovery and conquest of the realm of the Azte cs, in the highland heartland of Mexico, is linked histori cally with the name of Hernando Cortes. In 1519 he sailed from Cuba in com- mand of a veritable armada of eleven ships, some si x hundred men, and a large number of highly prized, scarce ho rses. Stop- ping, landing and re-embarking, he slowly proceeded along Yu- catan's gulf coast. In the area where Maya influenc e waned and Aztec domination began he established a base camp a nd called it Veracruz (by which name the place is still calle d). It was there that to the Spaniards' great astonishm ent emis- saries of the Aztec ruler appeared offering greetin gs and bear-"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"El Dorado 7 ing exquisite gifts. According to an eyewitness, Ber nal Diaz del Castillo (Historia verdadera de la conquista de la N ueva Espana, English translation by A. P. Maudslay), the gifts i ncluded \"a wheel like the sun, as big as a cartwheel, with man y sorts of pictures on it, the whole of fine gold and a wonder ful thing to behold, which those who afterwards weighed it said it was worth more than ten thousand dollars.\" Then another, even larger wheel, \"made of silver of great brilliancy in imita tion of the moon.\" Also a helmet filled to the brim with grains of gold; and a headdress made of the plumes of the rare quetzal bird (a relic still kept at Vienna's Museum fur Volkerkunde). These were gifts, the emissaries explained, of thei r ruler Moctezuma to the divine Quetzal Coatl, the \"Plumed S erpent\" god of the Aztecs; a great benefactor who was force d long ago by the God of War to leave the land of the Aztecs. With a band of followers he went to Yucatan, and then sailed of f eastward, vowing to return on the day of his birth in the yea r \"1 Reed.\" In the Aztec calendar, the cycle of years completed it self every fifty-two years, and therefore the year of the prom ised return, \"1 Reed,\" could occur once in fifty-two years. In th e Christian calendar these were the years 1363, 1415, 1467—and 1519, pre- cisely the year in which Cortes appeared from the wa ters on the east at the gateway of the Aztec domain. Bearded and helmeted as Quetzalcoatl was (some also held that the god wa s fair skinned), Cortes seemed to fulfill the prophecies. The gifts offered by the Aztec ruler were not casua lly se- lected. Rather, they were rich with symbolism. The h eap of gold grains was offered because gold was a divine metal belonging to the gods. The silver disk representing the moon was included because some legends held that Quetzalcoatl sailed off to return to the heavens, making the moon his abode. The plum ed head- dress and the richly adorned garments were for the returning god to wear. And the golden disk was a sacred calen dar depict- ing the cycle of fifty-two years and indicating the Year of Re- turn. We know that it was such a calendar because o thers like it. made however of stone rather than pure gold, have s ince been discovered (Fig. 1). Whether the Spaniards had grasped the symbolism or not is not recorded. If they did, they did not respect it. To them the objects represented one thing: proof of the vast ri ches that awaited them in the Aztec realm.

The golden hoard included in addition to the symbolic gifts go lden figurines of ducks, dogs, tigers, lions, and monkeys; and a g olden bow and arrows. But overwhelming them all was the \"sun disk,\" seventy-nine inches in diameter and thick as four r eal coins. The great painter and artist Albrecht Durer, who saw th e treasure that arrived from \"the New Golden Land,\" wrote that \"these things were all so precious that they were valued a t 100,000 gulden.

Indeed I cannot say enough abo ut the things which were there before me.\" But whatever unique artistic, religious, cultural, or historical value \"these things\" had, to the king they represen ted first and last gold—gold with which he could finance his stru ggles against internal insurrections and external wars.

Advancing slowly and overcoming whatever resistance was encountered by force of superior arms or by diploma cy and treachery, the Spaniards arrived at the Aztec capit al Tenochtitlan—today's Mexico City—in November 1519. T he city, situated in the midst of a lake, could be rea ched only via causeways that could be easily defended. Yet, still awed by the prophecy of the Returning God, Moctezuma and all th e nobles came out to greet Cortes and his entourage. Only Moc tezuma wore sandals; all the others were barefoot, humblin g themselves before the white god. He made the Spaniards welcome in his magnificent palace; there was gold everywhere, even the table- ware was made of gold; and they were shown a storag e room filled with golden artifacts. Using a ruse, the Spa niards seized Moctezuma and held him in their quarters; for his r elease they demanded a ransom in gold. The nobles thereupon sen t out runners throughout the kingdom to collect the ranso m; the golden objects that were handed over were enough to fill a ship that sailed back to Spain. (It was, however, seized by the French, causing war to break out.) Obtaining gold through cunning and weakening the Az tecs by sowing dissent among them, Cortes was planning to release Moctezuma and leave him on the throne as a puppet r uler. But his second-in-command lost patience and ordered a m assacre of the Aztec noblemen and commanders. In the turmoil t hat fol- lowed Moctezuma was killed and the Spaniards had a full- fledged battle on their hands. With heavy losses Cor tes retreated from the city; he reentered it, heavily r einforced from Cuba and after prolonged battles, only in August of 1521. By the time Spanish rule was irrevocably imposed on th e crushed Aztecs, gold weighing some 600,000 pesos was forced out, plun- dered, and melted down into ingots. Mexico, while being conquered, was indeed a New Gol den Land; but once the gold artifacts created and accum ulated over centuries, if not millennia, were hauled off, it wa s becoming apparent that Mexico was not the biblical land of H avila, and Tenochtitlan not the legendary City of Gold. And so the search for gold, which neither adventurers nor kings were prepared to give up, turned to other parts of the New World. The Spaniards had by then established a base, Panam a, on the Pacific coast of America, and from there they w ere sending out expeditions and agents into Central and South Am erica. It was there that they heard the alluring legend of El Dorado— short for el hombre dorado, the Gilded Man.

In the evening he di pped in the lake and washed off the gold and oil. only to repea t the rite the next day. He reigned in a city that was in the cent er of a lake, situated on an island of gold. According to the chronicle titled Elejias de Varone s Ilustres de Indias, the first concrete report of El Dorado w as brought to Francisco Pizarro in Panama by one of his captains in the fol- lowing version: It was said that an Indian from Colo mbia heard of \"a country rich in emeralds and gold. Among the things in which they engaged was this: their king disrobed, a nd went aboard a raft to the midst of a lake to make oblati ons to the gods. His regal form was overspread with fragrant o il, on which was laid a coat of powdered gold, from sole of foot unto his highest brow, making him resplendent as the beaming of the sun.\" To view the ritual many pilgrims had been com ing, mak- ing \"rich votive offerings of golden trinkets and e meralds rare, and diverse other of their ornaments,\" by throwing them into the sacred lake. Another version, suggesting that the sacred lake wa s some- where in northern Colombia, had the gilded king carr ying the \"great quantity of gold and emeralds\" into the cent er of the lake. There, acting as emissary of the multitudes t hat stood shouting and playing musical instruments all around the lake, he threw the treasure into the lake as an offering to its god. Still another version gave the name of the golden city as Manoa and said it was in the land of Biru—Peru to the Spaniard s. Word of El Dorado spread among the Europeans in the New World like wildfire, and in time back in Europe its elf. The word of mouth was soon put in writing; pamphlets and boo ks began to circulate in Europe describing the land and the lake and the city and the king whom no one had yet seen, and eve n the actual ritual of gilding the king each morning (Fig . 2). While some, like Cortes who went to California or oth ers who went to Venezuela, had searched in directions o f their own choosing, Francisco Pizarro and his lieutenants rel ied entirely on the Indian reports. Some went indeed to Colombia and searched the waters of Lake Guatavita—a search that contin- ued on and off for four centuries, yielded golden v otive objects and left ensuing generations of treasure hunters co nvinced that if only the lake could be completely drained, the g olden riches would be raised from its bottom.

After obtaining a royal charter for the purpos e and the titles Captain General and Governor (of the province yet to be con- quered), Pizarro sailed to Peru at the head of two hundred men. The year was 1530. Figure 2 How did he expect to take over with such a small fo rce a large country protected by thousands of warriors fi ercely loyal to their lord, the Inca, whom they considered to be the personi- fication of a god? Pizarro's plan was to repeat the strategy suc- cessfully employed by Cortes: to lure the ruler, sei ze him. obtain gold as ransom, then release him to be a Spa nish puppet. The fact that the Incas, as the people themselves c ame to be called, were engaged in a civil war when the Spania rds landed was an unexpected boon. They found out that upon th e death of the Lord Inca. his firstborn son by a \"secondary wi fe\" chal- lenged the legitimacy of the succession by a son bo rn to the Inca's principal wife.

They suggested that the two leaders meet in the city square, unarmed and without military escort, as a s how of goodwill. Atahualpa agreed. But when he reached the square, the Spaniards attacked his escort and held the Inca captive.

Atahualpa understood that to mean fill- ing up the room with golden objects, and agreed. On his orders golden utensils were brought out of temples and pal aces—gob- lets, ewers, salvers, vases of all shapes and sizes —ornaments that included imitations of animals and plants, and plates that lined the walls of public buildings. For weeks the treasures were being brought to fill up the room. But then the Span iards claimed that the deal was to fill the room with sol id gold, not the space-filling artifacts; and for over a month, Inca goldsmiths were engaged in melting down all the artful objects into ingots. As if history insisted on repeating itself, the fat e of Ata- hualpa was exactly the same as that which befell Mo ctezuma. Pizarro intended to release him to rule as a puppet king; but zealous lieutenants and Church representatives, at a mock trial, sentenced Atahualpa to death for the crime of idola try and the murder of his half brother, his rival for the thron e. The ransom obtained for the Inca lord, according to one of the chronicles of that time, was the equivalent of 1,326,539 pesos de oro (\"weights of gold\")—about 200,000 ounc es—a wealth that was quickly divided among Pizarro and h is men after setting aside the required fifth for the king . But as much as what each man received was beyond his fanciest drea ms, it was nothing compared to what was yet to come. When the conquistadores entered the capital, Cuzco, they saw temples and palaces literally covered and fille d with gold. In the royal palace there were three chambers filled w ith gold fur- nishings and five with silver, and a hoard of 100,0 00 gold ingots weighing about five pounds each, a reserve of the p recious metal waiting to be fashioned into artful objects. The golden throne, outfitted with a golden stool, designed to convert into a litter on which the king could recline, weighed 25, 000 pesos (about 4,000 ounces); even the carrying poles were overlaid with gold. Everywhere there were chapels and burial chambers honoring ancestors, filled with statuettes and imag es of birds, fish, and small animals, ear spools, breastplates. In the great temple (which the Spaniards named Temple of the Sun ) the walls were covered with heavy gold plates. Its gard en was an artificial garden where everything—trees, shrubs, f lowers, birds, a fountain—was fashioned of gold. In the cou rtyard there was a field of maize (the local corn) where every s talk was made of silver and the ears of gold; it was a field that covered an area of 300 by 600 feet—180,000 square feet of golden co rn!

To the Incas, as to the Aztecs, gold was a gift or the property of the gods, not a means of exchange. They never used it as a commodity, as money. To the Spaniards, gold was a means to acquire whatever their hearts desired. Flu sh with gold but short of homegrown luxuries or even daily neces sities, the Spaniards were soon paying sixty golden pesos for a bottle of wine, 100 for a cloak, 10,000 for a horse. But back in Europe, the inflow of gold, silver, and precious stones raised the gold fever and encouraged more sp eculation about El Dorado. No matter how much treasure was co ming in, the conviction persisted that El Dorado had not yet been found, that with persistence and luck and the correct read ing of Indian clues and enigmatic maps someone was going to find it. German explorers were certain that the golden city would b e found at the headwaters of the Orinoco river in Venezuela, o r perhaps in Colombia. Others concluded that the river to be foll owed was another one, even the Amazon in Brazil. Perhaps the most ro- mantic of all of them, on account of his background and his royal sponsor, was Sir Walter Raleigh, who sailed fr om Plym- outh in 1595 to find the legendary Manoa and add it s golden glory to Queen Elizabeth's crown. In his vision he saw Manoa as Imperial El Dorado, roofed with gold! Shadows to which — Despite of all shocks of change, all onset of capricious accident— Men clung with yearning hope which would not die. He, like others before and after him, still saw El Dorado— the king, the city, the land—as a dream yet to be f ulfilled, \"a yearning hope which would not die.\" In that, all wh o went in quest of El Dorado were a link in a chain that bega n before the pharaohs and continues with our wedding rings and n ational hoards. Yet it was those dreamers, those adventurers, who i n their lust for gold revealed to Western man the unknown p eoples and civilizations of the Americas.

The continued and intensified search c an be attri- buted mostly to the conviction that the source of a ll those riches had yet to be found. The Spaniards extensively questioned the natives ab out the fountainhead of the amassed treasures and tirelessl y followed every clue. It soon became clear to them that the Ca ribbean and Yucatan were not primary sources at all: the Maya i n fact indi- cated that they had obtained gold mostly by trading with their neighbors to the south and the west, and explained that they bad learned the arts of goldsmithing from earlier s ettlers (whom scholars nowadays identify by the name Toltecs). Ye s, the Span- iards said, but where do the others obtain the gold from? From the gods, the Maya answered. In the local tongues, gold was called teocuitlatl, literally meaning \"the gods' ex cretion,\" their perspiration and their tears. In the Aztec capital the Spaniards learned that gol d was in- deed deemed to be the gods' metal, the stealing of which was a capital offense. The Aztecs too pointed to the Tolt ecs as their teachers of the art of goldsmithing. And who had ta ught the Toltecs? The great god Quetzalcoatl, the Aztecs rep lied. Cortes, in his reports to the Spanish king, wrote that he h ad questioned the Aztec king Moctezuma extensively about the sour ce of the gold. Moctezuma revealed that the gold came from th ree prov- inces of his kingdom, one on the Pacific coast, one on the gulf coast, and one inland in the southwest where the mi nes were. Cortes sent men to investigate the three indicated s ources. In all three they found that the Indians were actually obt aining the gold in riverbeds or collecting nuggets that were l ying on the surface where rains had washed the gold down. In th e province where mines did exist, they appeared to have been m ined only in the past; the Indians encountered by the Spaniar ds were not working in the mines at all. \"There were no active mines,\" Cortes wrote in his report. \"Nuggets were found on t he surface; the principal source was the sand of the riverbeds. The gold was kept in the form of dust in small cane tubes or qui lts, or was melted in small pots and cast in bars.\" Once ready, it was sent on to the capital, returned to the gods to whom the gold had always belonged.

The conquering Spaniards, and raini ng engi- neers in following centuries, persistently spoke of prehistoric gold mines found at various Mexican sites. Since it seems incon- ceivable that earlier settlers of Mexico, such as t he Toltecs, whose beginnings are traced to a few centuries befo re the Chris- tian era, would have possessed a higher mining tech nology than the later (and thus presumably more advanced) Aztec s, the pur- ported \"prehistoric mines\" have been dismissed by r esearchers as old shafts begun and abandoned by the conquering Span- iards. Expressing the current views at the beginnin g of this cen- tury. Alexander Del Mar (A History of the Precious Metals) stated that, \"With regard to Prehistoric mining it must be pre- mised that the Aztecs had no knowledge of iron, and therefore, that subterranean mining... is practically out of t he question. It is true that modern prospectors have found in Mexic o old shafts and remains of mining works which appeared to them to have been the scene of prehistoric mining.\" Although suc h reports had even found their way into official publications , Del Mar believed that the sites were \"ancient workings coup led with vol- canic upheavals, or else with deposits of lava or t arp, both of which were regarded as evidence of vast antiquity.\" \"This infer- ence,\" he concluded, \"is hardly warranted.\" This, however, is not what the Aztecs themselves ha d re- ported. They attributed to their predecessors, the Toltecs, not just the craftsmanship but also the knowledge of th e hidden place of gold and the ability to mine it out of the rocky moun- tains. The Aztec manuscript known as Codice Matriten se de la Real Academia (vol. VIII), in a translation by Migue l Leon- Portilla (Aztec Thought and Culture) describes the T oltecs thus: \"The Toltecs were skillful people; all of their wor ks were good, all were exact, all well made and admirable.. . Painters, sculptors, carvers of precious stones, feather arti sts, potters, spinners, weavers, skillful in all they made. They discovered the precious green stones, the turquoise; they knew the turquoise and its mines. They found its mines and they found the moun- tains hiding silver and gold, copper and tin and th e metal of the moon.\" The Toltecs, most historians agree, had come to the central highland of Mexico in the centuries preceding the Ch ristian era —at least a thousand years, perhaps fifteen hundred years, be- fore the Aztecs appeared on the scene.

And who was it who had taught the Tolt ecs the secrets of mining? The answer, as we have seen, was Quetzalcoatl, the Feath- ered Serpent god. The mystery of the accumulated gold treasures on th e one hand and the limited ability of the Aztecs to obtai n it, repeated itself in the land of the Incas. In Peru, as in Mexico, the natives did obtain gold by collect- ing grains and nuggets washed down from the mountai ns into the riverbeds. But the annual production through the se methods could in no way account for the immense treasures o f gold found in Inca hands. The immensity of the hoards is obvious from the Spanish records kept at Seville, the offic ial port of entry into Spain of the New World's riches. The Arc hives of the Indies—still available—recorded the receipt in the five years 1521-1525 of 134,000 pesos de oro. In the next five years (the loot from Mexico!) the quantity was 1,038,000 pesos . From 1531 to 1535, when the shipments from Peru began to augm ent those from Mexico, the quantity increased to 1,650,000 pe sos. During 1536-1540, when Peru was the main source, the gold received weighed 3,937,000 pesos; and in the decade of the 1 550s the receipts totaled almost 11,000,000 pesos. One of the leading chroniclers of that time, Pedro de Cieza de Leon (Chronicles of Peru), reported that in the y ears follow- ing the conquest the Spaniards \"extracted\" from the Inca em- pire annually 15,000 arrobas of gold and 50,000 of silver; this is equivalent to over 6,000,000 ounces of gold and ove r 20,000,000 ounces of silver annually! Though Cieza de Leon does not men- tion over how many years such fabulous quantities h ad been \"extracted,\" his numbers give us an idea of the qua ntities of precious metals that the Spaniards were able to plu nder in the Inca lands. The chronicles relate that after the initial great ransom ob- tained from the Inca lord, the plunder of the riche s of Cuzco, and the tearing apart of a sacred temple at Pachaca mac on the coast, the Spaniards became expert in \"extracting\" gold from the provinces in equally vast quantities. Throughou t the Inca empire, provincial palaces and temples were richly decorated with gold. Another source was burial sites containi ng golden objects. The Spaniards learned that the Inca custom was to seal the residences of deceased noblemen and rulers, lea ving there their mummified bodies surrounded by all the precio us objects they had possessed in life. The Spaniards also susp ected, cor- rectly, that the Indians had carried off to hiding places various"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"El Dorado 17 gold treasures; some were stashed away in caves, so me were buried, others were thrown into lakes. And there we re the huacas, venerated places set aside for worship or f or divine use, where gold was piled up and kept at the disposal of its true owners, the gods. Tales of treasure finds, as frequently as not obtai ned by tor- turing Indians to reveal the hidden places, permeat e the records of the fifty years following the conquest, and even into the sev- enteenth and eighteenth centuries. In this manner G onzalo Pi- zarro found the hidden treasure of an Inca lord who reigned a century earlier. One Garcia Gutierrez de Toledo fou nd a series of mounds covering sacred treasures from which over a million pesos worth of gold was extracted between 1566 and 1592. As late as 1602, Escobar Corchuelo secured from the hua ca La Tosca objects valued at 60,000 pesos. And when the waters of the river Moche were diverted, a treasure worth som e 600,000 pesos was found; it included, the chroniclers repor ted, \"a large golden idol.\" Writing a century and a half ago, and thus much clo ser to the events than can be done nowadays, two explorers (M. A. Ri- bero and J. J. von Tschudi, Peruvian Antiquities) d escribed the situation thus: \"In the second half of the sixteent h century, in the short space of twenty-five years, the Spaniards exported from Peru to the mother country more than four hund red mil- lion ducats of gold and silver, and we may well be assured that nine-tenths of this quantity composed the mere boot y taken by the conquerors; in this computation we leave out of view the immense masses of precious metals buried by the nat ives to hide from the avarice of the foreign invaders; as also t he celebrated chain of gold which the Inca Huayna Capac commanded to be made in honor of the birth of his firstborn son, In ti Cusi Hua- Ilapa Huascar, and which they say was thrown into t he lake of Urcos.\" (The chain was said to be seven hundred fee t long and thick as a man's wrist.) \"Also not included are the eleven thou- sand llamas loaded with gold dust in precious vases of this metal, with which the unfortunate Atahualpa wished to pur- chase his life and liberty, and which the conductor s interred in the Puna as soon as they heard of the new punishmen t to which their adored monarch had been treacherously condemn ed.\" That these immense quantities were the result of th e plunder of accumulated riches and not of ongoing production is known not only from the chronicles but is also confirmed by the numbers. Within decades, after the visible and hidd en treasures had been exhausted, the gold receipts in Seville dw indled to a mere 6,000-7,000 pounds of gold a year. It was then that the"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"18 THE LOST REALMS Spaniards, using their iron tools, began to conscri pt the natives for work in the mines. The toil was so harsh, that by the end of the century the land was almost depopulated and the Spanish Court imposed restrictions on the exploitation of na tive labor. Great silver lodes were discovered and worked, such as at Po- tosi; but the quantity of gold obtained never match ed, nor does it explain, the vast treasures amassed before the S panish arrival. Seeking an answer to the puzzle, Ribero and von Tsch udi wrote, \"The gold, although it was the Peruvians' mo st esteemed metal, they possessed in a quantity greater than th at of any other. Upon comparing its abundance, in the time of the Incas, with the quantity which, in the space of four centu ries, the Spaniards have been able to extract from the mines and rivers, it becomes certain that the Indians had a knowledge of veins of this precious material which the conquerors and the ir descen- dants never succeeded in discovering.\" (They also p redicted that \"the day will come when Peru will withdraw fro m her bosom the veil which now covers more wonderful rich es than those which are offered at the present day in Califo rnia.\" And when the gold rushes of the late nineteenth century gripped Europe with a new gold fever, many mining experts c ame to believe that the so-called \"mother lode,\" the ultim ate source of all gold on Earth, would be found in Peru.) As in Mexico, the generally accepted notion regardi ng the Lands of the Andes has been (in the words of Del Ma r) that \"the precious metals obtained by the Peruvians prev ious to the Spanish conquest consisted nearly altogether of gol d secured by washing the river gravels. No native shafts were fo und. A few excavations had been made into the sides of hills w ith outcrops of native gold or silver.\" That is true insofar as the Incas of the Andes (and the Aztecs of Mexico) were concerned; bu t in the Andean lands, as in Mexico, the question of prehist oric mining —the hewing of the metal out of vein-rich rocks—has not been settled. The possibility that at a time long before the Inca s someone had access to gold at its vein sources (at places t he Incas did not disclose or even did not know about), remains a pla usible expla- nation for the accumulated treasures. Indeed, accor ding to one of the best contemporary studies on the subject (S. K.

The chroniclers, and contemporary scholars after ce nturies of studies, agree that those peoples had no practic al use for gold, except to adorn with it the temples of the go ds and those who ruled over the people in the name of the gods. The Aztecs literally poured their gold at the Spaniards' feet, believing that they represented the returning deity. The Incas, wh o at first also saw in the arriving Spaniards the fulfillment of th eir deity's promise to return from across the seas, later on co uld not un- derstand why the Spaniards had come so far and beha ved so ill for a metal for which Man had no practical use. All scholars are agreed that the Incas and the Aztecs did not use go ld for mone- tary purposes, nor did they attach to it a commerci al value. Yet they extracted from their subject nations a tribute of gold. Why? In the ruins of a pre-Inca culture at Chimu, on the Peruvian coast, the great nineteenth-century explorer Alexan der von Humboldt (a mining engineer by profession) discover ed a mass of gold buried alongside the dead in tombs. The dis covery of the metal made him wonder why would gold, being deemed of no practical use, be buried with the dead? Was it that somehow it was believed that they would need it in an afterlif e—or that in joining their ancestors, they could use the gold th e way their ancestors had once done? Who was it who had brought about such customs and b eliefs, and when? Who had caused gold to be so valued, and perhaps go ne after it at its sources? The only answer the Spaniards were given was \"the g ods.\" It was of the gods' tears that gold was formed, the Incas said. And in so pointing to the gods, they unknowingly ec hoed the statement of the biblical Lord through the prophet Haggai: The silver is mine and the gold is mine, So sayeth the Lord of Hosts. It is this statement, we believe, that holds the ke y to unravel- ing the mysteries, enigmas, and secrets of gods, me n, and an- cient civilizations in the Americas."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"2 THE LOST REALM OF CAIN? The Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan, was an impressive metropolis when the Spaniards arrived. Their reports describe it as large, if not larger, than most European cities of the time, well laid out and administered. Situated on an island in Lake Tex coco, in the highlands' central valley, it was surrounded by wat er and inter- sected by canals—a Venice of the New World. The lon g and wide causeways that connected the city to the mainl and made a great impression upon the Spaniards; so did the num erous canoes sailing the canals, the streets teeming with people, the marketplaces filled with merchants and merchandise from all over the realm. The royal palace was many-roomed, f illed with riches and surrounded by gardens that included an a viary and a zoo. A great plaza, humming with activity, was the setting for festivities and military parades. But the heart of the city and the empire was the vas t reli- gious center—an immense rectangle of more than a mi llion square feet, surrounded by a wall fashioned to rese mble writh- ing serpents. There were scores of edifices within this sacred precinct; the most outstanding of them were the Gre at Temple with its two towers, and the partly circular temple of Quetzal- coatl. Nowadays Mexico City's great plaza and the c athedral occupy parts of the ancient sacred precinct, as do many adjoin- ing streets and buildings. Following a chance excav ation in 1978, important portions of the Great Temple can be now seen and visited, and enough has become known in the pas t decade to make possible a scale-model reconstruction of th e precinct as it was in its times of glory. The Great Temple had the shape of a step-pyramid, r ising in stages to a height of some 160 feet; its base measu red about 150 by 150 feet. It represented the culmination of seve ral phases of construction: Like a Russian doll, the outer struct ure was built over a previous smaller one, and that one enclosed an even earlier structure.

Representing a curious dual worship, the tower on th e northern side was a shrine dedicated to Tlaloc, god of storms and earthquakes (Fig. 3a). The southern tower was d edicated to the Aztec tribal deity Huitzilopochtli, their war g od. He was usually depicted holding the magical weapon called Fire Serpent (Fig. 3b) with which he had defeated four hundred l esser gods. Two monumental stairways led up to the pyramid's to p on its western side, one for each tower-shrine.

The latter two flanked the temple o f Quetzal- coatl. It had the unusual shape of a regular step-p yramid in front but a circular stepped structure in the back, where it spi- raled up to become a circular tower with a conical dome (Fig. 4).

This wa s possible only because the planners of the sacred precinct er ected the temples along an architectural axis aligned not pre cisely with the cardinal points, but one that shifted to the so utheast by 7 1/2 degrees; this compensated exactly for the geographi cal position of Tenochtitlan (north of the equator), enabling th e viewing of 22 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"Figure 4 the Sun on the crucial dates rising between the two towers. Although the Spaniards may have been unaware of thi s so- phisticated feature of the sacred precinct, the rec ords they left bespeak their amazement at encountering not merely a cultured people, but also a civilization so similar to the S paniards' own. Here, across what had been a forbidding ocean, for all intents and purposes isolated from the civilized world, was a state headed by a king—just as in Europe. Noblemen, funct ionaries, courtesans filled the royal court. Emissaries came and went. Tribute was extracted from vassal tribes, taxes wer e paid by loyal citizens. Royal archives kept written records of tribal his- tories, dynasties, wealth. There was an army with a n hierarchi- cal command and perfected weapons. There were arts and crafts, music and dancing. There were festivals con nected with the seasons and holy days prescribed by religion—a state reli- gion, just as in Europe. And there was the sacred p recinct with its temples and chapels and residences, surrounded by a wall— just as the Vatican in Rome—run by a hierarchy of pr iests who, just as in Europe of the time, were not only keeper s of the faith and interpreters of divine will, but also guardians of the secrets of scientific knowledge. Of that, astrology, astron omy, and the mysteries of the calendar were paramount. Some Spanish chroniclers of the time, aiming to cou nteract the embarrassingly positive impressions of what sho uld have been Indian savages, attributed to Cortes a repriman d to Moc- tezuma for worshiping \"idols that are not gods, but evilly named demons,\" an evil influence Cortes supposedly offered to coun- teract by constructing atop the pyramid a shrine wi th a cross \"and the image of our Lady\" (Bernal Diaz del Castill o, Historia verdadera).

You are everywhere, everlasting. You are beseeched, you are entreated. Your glory is eminent. Yet with all the baffling similarities, there was a troubling difference about Aztec civilization. It was not jus t the \"idola- try,\" of which the flocking friars and padres made a casus belli; not even the barbaric customs of cutting out the he arts of pris- oners and offering the pulsating hearts in sacrific e to Huitzilo- pochtli (a practice, incidentally, apparently intro duced only in 1486 by the king preceding Moctezuma). It was, rath er, the whole gamut of this civilization, as though it was the result of a progress that had been arrested in its course, or a n imported higher culture covering, as a thin veneer, a coarse r understruc- ture.

Textiles were wo ven on a most rudimentary loom; cotton was spun on clay spin dles the likes of which have been found in the Old World, in the ruins of Troy (second millennium B.C.) and sites in Palestine (third mil- lennium B.C.). In their tools and weapons the Aztecs were in a stone age, unaccountably devoid of metal tools and weapons although they possessed the craft of goldsmithing. For cutting they used chips of the glasslike obsidian stone (an d one of the prevalent objects from Aztec times was the obsidian knife used to cut out prisoners' hearts...). Because other peoples in the Americas have been held to have had no writing, the Aztecs seemed more advance d at least on this score because they did have a system of wri ting. But the writing was neither alphabetical nor phonetic; it w as a series of pictures, like cartoons in a comic strip (Fig. 6a). By compari- son, in the ancient Near East where writing began c irca 3800 B.C. (in Sumer) in the form of pictographs, it quickl y changed through stylization to a cuneiform script, advanced to a pho- netic script where signs stood for syllables, and, by the end of the second millennium B.C., to a complete alphabet. P ictorial writing appeared in Egypt at the beginning of kings hip there, circa 3100 B.C., and quickly evolved into a system of hiero- glyphic writing. Expert studies, as that by Amelia Hertz (Revue de Sy nthese Historique, vol. 35), have concluded that Aztec pic ture-writing in A . D . 1500 was similar to the earliest Egyptian writing, as that on the stone tablet of king Narmer (Fig. 6b) whom s ome con- sider to have been the first dynastic king in Egypt —four and a half millennia earlier. A. Hertz found another curi ous analogy between Aztec Mexico and early dynastic Egypt: In b oth, while copper metallurgy was yet to develop, goldsmithing was so ad- vanced that the craftsmen could inlay golden object s with tur- quoise (a semiprecious stone cherished in both land s).

The sources for this information are not only verbal traditions, but the various books called cod ices. These, such as the Codex Boturini, relate that the ancestral home of the Aztec tribe was called Azt-lan (\"White Place\"). It was the abode of the first patriarchal couple, Itzac-mixcoa tl (\"White Cloud Serpent\") and his spouse Ilan-cue (\"Old Woman\" ); they gave birth to sons from whom the Nahuatl-speaking t ribes, among them the Aztecs, had come forth. The Toltecs too were descended of Itzac-mixcoatl, but their mother was a nother woman; they were thus only half brothers of the Azt ecs. Where Aztlan was located, no one can say for certai n. Of the numerous studies dealing with the matter (which inc lude theories that it was the legendary Atlantis), one o f the best is Eduard Seler's Wo lag Aztlan, die Heimat der Azteke n? It was a place apparently associated with the number seven, having been sometimes called Aztlan of the Seven Caves. It was a lso de- picted in the codices as a place recognizable by it s seven tem- ples: a central large step-pyramid surrounded by si x lesser shrines. In his elaborate Historia de las cosas de la Nueva Espana, the Friar Bernardino de Sahagun, using the original text s in the native Nahuatl language written after the Conquest, deals with the multitribal migration from Aztlan. There were s even tribes in all. They left Aztlan by boats. The pictorial bo oks show them passing by a landmark whose pictograph remains an e nigma. Sahagun provides various names for the way stations , calling the place of landfall \"Panotlan\"; it simply means \"Plac e of Arrival by Sea,\" but from various clues scholars conclude t hat it was what is nowadays Guatemala. The arriving tribes had with them four Wise Men to guide and lead them, because they had carried with them r itual manu- scripts and also knew the secrets of the calendar. From there the tribes went in the direction of the Place of the Clo ud-Serpent, apparently dispersing as they did so. At long last some, includ- ing the Aztecs and the Toltecs, reached a place cal led Teotihua- can, where two pyramids were built, one to the Sun and the other to the Moon. Kings reigned at Teotihuacan and were buried there, for to be buried in Teotihuacan was to join the gods in an afterlife.

The signal for the last migration was given to the Aztecs/ Mexica by their god Huitzilopochtli, who promised t hem a land where there are \"houses with gold and silver, multi colored cot- ton and cacao of many hues.\" They were to keep on g oing in the indicated direction until they would see an eagle p erched on a cactus growing from a rock surrounded by water. The y were to settle there and call themselves \"Mexica.\" for they were a cho- sen people destined to rule over the other tribes. Thus it was that the Aztecs arrived—according to th ese leg- ends, for the second time—in the Valley of Mexico. They reached Tollan, also known as \"The Middle Place.\" A lthough the inhabitants were their own ancestral kinfolk, t hey did not make the Aztecs welcome. For nearly two centuries t he Aztecs lived on the central lake's marshy edges. Gaining s trength and knowledge, they finally established their own city, Tenochtitlan. The name meant \"City of Tenoch.\" Some think it was s o called because the Aztec leader at the time, the ac tual builder of the city, was named Tenoch. But since it is known th at the Aztecs considered themselves at the time to have be en Teno- chas—descendants of Tenoch—others believed that Ten och was the name of a tribal ancestor, a legendary pate rnal figure from way, way back. Scholars now generally hold that the Mexica or Teno chas arrived in the valley circa A . D . 1140 and established Tenochtitlan in A . D . 1325. They then gained influence through a series o f alliances with some tribes and warfare with others. Some re- searchers doubt whether the Aztecs dominated a true empire. The face is that when the Spaniards arrived, they w ere the dom- inant power in central Mexico, lording over allies and subjugat- ing enemies. The latter served as a source of capti ves for sacrifices; the Spanish conquest was facilitated by their insurrec- tions against the Aztec oppressors.

Tribal beliefs, prevalent from the southwestern Uni ted States in the north to today's Nicaragua in the south—Meso america— held that at the very beginning there was an Olden God, Cre- ator of All Things, of the Heaven and of the Earth, whose abode was in the highest heaven, the twelfth heaven . Sahagun's sources attributed the origin of this knowledge to the Toltecs: And the Toltecs knew that many are the heavens. They said there are twelve superimposed divisions; There dwells the true god and his consort. He is the Celestial God, Lord of Duality; His consort is Lady of Duality, Celestial Lady. This is what it means: He is king, he is Lord, above the twelve heavens. This amazingly sounds like a rendering of Mesopotam ian ce- lestial-religious beliefs, according to which the h ead of the pan- theon was called Anu (\"Lord of Heaven\") and who, wi th his consort Antu (\"Lady of Heaven\") resided on the oute rmost planet, the twelfth member of our Solar System. The Sumerians depicted it as a radiating planet whose symbol was the cross (Fig. 7a). The symbol was thereafter adopted by all the peoples of the ancient world and evolved to the ubiquitous emblem of the Winged Disk (Fig. 7b,c). Quetzalcoatl's shield (Fig. 7d) and symbols depicted on early Mexican monuments (Fig. 7 e) are uncannily similar. The Olden Gods of whom the Nahuatl texts related le gend- ary tales were depicted as bearded men (Fig. 8), as befits ances- tors of the bearded Quetzalcoatl.

Were the gods of the Mexicans original conceptions, or were they memories of beliefs and tales that had their r oots in the ancient Near East? The answer will emerge as we exa mine ad- ditional aspects of Nahuatl tales of creation and p rehistory. We find the Creator of All Things, to continue the c ompari- sons, to have been a god who \"gives life and death, good and evil fortune.\" The chronicler Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas (Historia general) wrote that the Indians \"call to him in their tribulations, gazing toward the sky where they beli eve him to be.\" This god first created the Heaven and the Eart h; then he fashioned a man and a woman out of clay, but they d id not last. After additional endeavors, a human pair was create d of cinders and metals and from them the world was peopled. But all these men and women were destroyed in a flood, save for a certain priest and his wife who, with seeds and animals, fl oated in a hollowed-out log.

Each of the previous four Suns had come to an end t hrough some catastrophe, sometimes a natural one (such as a deluge) and sometimes a calamity triggered by wars between the gods. The great Aztec Calendar Stone (it was discovered wi thin the area of the sacred precinct) is believed to be a record in stone of the five ages. The symbols encircling the central panel and the central depiction itself have been the subj ect of numer- ous studies. The first inner ring clearly depicts t he twenty signs for the twenty days of the Aztec month. The four re ctangular panels surrounding the central face are recognized as the glyphs representing the past four eras and the calamity th at ended each of them—Water, Wind, Quakes & Storms, and Jaguar. The tales of the four ages are valuable for their i nformation regarding the lengths of the eras and their princip al events. Though versions vary, suggesting a long verbal trad ition preced- ing the written records, they all agree that the fi rst age came to an end by a deluge, a great flood that engulfed the Earth. Man- kind survived because one couple, Nene and his wife Tata, managed to save themselves in a hollowed-out log. Either this first age or the second one was the age of the White Haired Giants. The Second Sun was recalled as \"Tzon- cuztique,\" \"Golden Age\"; it was brought to an end b y the Wind Serpent. The Third Sun was presided over by the Fir e Serpent; it was the age of the Red Haired People. According t o the chronicler Ixtlilxochitl, they were survivors of th e second age who had come by ship from the east to the New World , settling in the area he called Botonchan; they encountered th ere giants who also survived the second age, and became enslav ed by them. The Fourth Sun was the era of the Black Headed Peopl e. It was during that era that Quetzalcoatl appeared in M exico—tall of stature, bright of countenance, bearded, and wea ring a long tunic. His staff, shaped like a serpent, was painte d black, white, and red; it was inlaid with precious stones and ado rned with six stars. (Not by coincidence, perhaps, the staff of Bi shop Zuma- rraga, the first bishop of Mexico, was fashioned to look like the staff of Quetzalcoatl). It was during this era that Tollan, the Toltec capital, was built. Quetzalcoatl, master of wisdom and knowledge, introduced learning, crafts, laws, and t ime reckon- ing according to the fifty-two-year cycle.

Five years later the Chichimec tribes, alias the Aztecs, arrived; and the Fifth Sun, the Aztec era, began. Why were the eras called \"Suns\" and how long did th ey last? The reason is unclear and the length of the various eras is either unstated or differs according to the version. One t hat appears orderly and, as we shall show, astoundingly plausib le, is the Codex Vaticano-Latino 3738. It relates that the firs t Sun lasted 4,008 years, the second 4,010, the third 4,081. The fourth Sun \"began 5,042 years ago,\" leaving unstated the time of its ending. Be it as it may, we have here a tale of events going back 17,141 years from the time the tales have been recorded. This is quite a time span for supposedly backward p eople to recall, and scholars, while agreeing that the event s of the Fourth Sun contain historical elements, tend to dismiss th e earlier eras as sheer myth. How then explain the tales of Adam a nd Eve, a global deluge, the survival of one couple—episodes (in the words of H. B. Alexander, Latin-American Mythology) \"strik- ingly reminiscent of the creation-narrative in Gene sis 2 and of the similar Babylonian cosmogony\"? Some scholars sug gest that Nahuatl texts reflect in some way what the Indians had already heard from the Bible-spouting Spaniards. But since no t all co- dices are post-Conquest, the biblical-Mesopotamian s imilarities can only be explained by admitting that the Mexican tribes had some ancestral ties to Mesopotamia. Moreover, the Mexica-Nahuatl timetable correlates e vents and times with a scientific and historical accuracy that ought to make everyone stop and wonder. It dates the deluge, at the end of the First Sun, to 13,133 years before the time o f writing the codex; i.e., to about 11,600 B.C. Now, in our book Th e 12th Planet we have concluded that a global deluge had i ndeed en- gulfed the Earth circa 11,000 B.C.; such a correspond ence not only of the tale itself but also of its approximate time suggests that there is more than myth to Aztec tales. We are equally intrigued by the tales' statement th at the fourth era was the time of the \"black-headed people \" (the ear- lier ones having been deemed eras of white-haired g iants, then red-haired people). This is precisely the term by w hich the Su- merians were called in their texts. Do the Aztec ta les then deem the Fourth Sun to have been the time when the Sumer ians ap- peared on the human scene? Sumerian civilization be gan circa 3800 B.C.; we should not, it would seem by now, be s urprised to find that by dating the beginning of the Fourth Age to 5,026 years before their own time, the Aztecs in effect d ate it to circa 3500 B.C.—amazingly correct for the start of the age of the \"black-headed people.\""},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"34 THE LOST REALMS The feedback explanation (that the Aztecs told the Spaniards what they had heard from the Spaniards to begin wit h) certainly does not hold water where the Sumerians are concern ed; the Western world uncovered the remains and legacy of t he great Sumerian civilization only four centuries after the Conquest. The Genesis-like tales, one must conclude, had to b e known to the Nahuatl tribes from their own ancestral sour ces. But how? The question had already baffled the Spaniards them selves. Astounded to discover not just a civilization in th e New World, and one so akin to Europe's, but also \"the great nu mber of people there.\" they were doubly puzzled by the bibl ical threads in the Aztec yarns. Trying to find an explanation, the answer seemed to be a simple one: these were descendants o f the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel who were exiled by the Assyri ans in 722 B.C. and then vanished without a trace (the remaining kingdom of Judea was retained by the two tribes Judah and Be njamin). If not the originator, then the one who expounded i t first in a detailed manuscript, was the Dominican Friar Diego Duran, who was brought to New Spain in 1542 at the age of five. His two books, one known by the English title Book of th e Gods and Rites and the Ancient Calendar and Historia de la s Indias de Nueva Espana, have been translated into English by D. Heyden and F. Horcasitas. It is in the second book that Du ran, citing the many similarities, stated emphatically his conclusi on regarding the natives \"of the Indies and the mainland of this new world\": that \"they are Jews and Hebrew people.\" His theory was con- firmed, he wrote, \"by their nature: These natives a re part of the ten tribes of Israel which Shalmaneser, King of the Assyrians, captured and took to Assyria.\" His reports of conversations with old Indians elici ted tribal traditions of a time when there had been \"men of mo nstrous stature who appeared and took possession of the cou ntry.... And these giants, not having found a way to reach t he Sun, decided to build a tower so high that its summit wo uld reach unto Heaven.\" Such an episode paralleling the bibli cal tale of the Tower of Babel matched in significance another t ale, of an Exodus-like migration. No wonder then that as such reports increased, the theory of the Ten Lost Tribes became the favorite one of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the assumption being tha t, some-"},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Lost Realm of Cain? 35 how, wandering eastward through the Assyrian domain s and beyond, the Israelites reached America. The notion of the Ten Lost Tribes, at its height sp onsored by Europe's royal courts, came to be ridiculed by late r scholars. Current theories hold that Man initially arrived in the New World from Asia across an icy land bridge to Alaska some 20,000-30,000 years ago, spreading gradually southw ard. Con- siderable evidence consisting of artifacts, languag e and ethno- logical and anthropological evaluations indicates i nfluences from across the Pacific—Hindu, Southeast Asian, Chin ese, Jap- anese, Polynesian. Scholars explain them by periodi c arrival of such people in the Americas; out they are emphatic in stating that these occurred during the Christian era, just c enturies be- fore the conquest and not at any time B.C. While established scholars continue to downplay all evidence for transatlantic contacts between the Old and New World, they employ the concession to relatively recent transpac ific contacts as the explanation for the currency of Genesis-like tales in the Americas. Indeed, legends of a global deluge and of the cre- ation of Man out of clay or similar materials have been themes of mythologies all over the world, and one possible route to the Americas from the Near East (where the tales had or iginated) could have been Southeast Asia and the Pacific isla nds. But there are elements in the Nahuatl versions that point to a very early source, rather than to relatively recent pre-Conquest centuries. One is the fact that the Nahuatl tales o f the creation of Man follow a very ancient Mesopotamian version t hat did not even find its way into the Book of Genesis! The Bible, in fact, has not one but two versions of the cre- ation of Man; both draw on earlier Mesopotamian ver sions. But both ignore a third version, and probably the oldes t one, in which Mankind was fashioned not of clay but out of the blood of a god. In the Sumerian text on which this version i s based, the god Ea, collaborating with the goddess Ninti, \"prep ared a puri- fying bath.\" \"Let one god be bled into it,\" he orde red; \"from his flesh and blood, let Ninti mix the clay.\" From this mixture, men and women were created. We find it highly significant that it is this versi on—which is not in the Bible—that is repeated in \"an Aztec myth. The text is known as Manuscript of 1558; it relates that after the calamitous end of the Fourth Sun the gods assembled in Teotihu acan. As soon as the gods came together, they said: \"Who shall inhabit the Earth?"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"36 THE LOST REALMS The sky has already been established and the Earth has been established; but who, oh gods, shall live on Earth?\" The gathered gods \"were grieved.\" But Quetzalcoatl, a god of wisdom and science, had an idea. He went to Mict lan, the Land of the Dead, and announced to the divine coupl e in charge of it: \"I have come for the precious bones w hich you keep here.\" Overcoming objections and trickery, Que tzalcoatl managed to get hold of the \"precious bones\": He gathered the precious bones; The bones of man were put together on one side, the bones of woman were put together on the other s ide. Quetzalcoatl took them and made a bundle. He carried the dry bones to Tamoanchan, \"Place of O ur Ori- gin\" or \"Place From Which We Arc Descended.\" There he gave the bones to the goddess Cihuacoatl (\"Serpent Woman\" ), a god- dess of magic. She ground up the bones and put them in a fine earthen tub. Quetzalcoatl bled his male organ on them. As the other gods looked on, she mixed the ground b ones with the god's blood; from the claylike mixture, th e Macehuales were fashioned. Mankind was re-created! In the Sumerian tales, the fashioners of Man were t he god Ea (\"Whose Home Is Water\"), also known as Enki (\"Lo rd Earth\") whose epithets and symbols often implied hi s being crafty, a metallurgist—all words that found their l inguistic equivalent in the term \"Serpent.\" His companion in the feat, Ninti (\"She Who Gives Life\") was the goddess of med icine—a craft whose symbol from antiquity has been the entw ined ser- pent. Sumerian depictions on cylinder seals showed the two dei- ties in a laboratorylike setting, flasks and all (F ig. 9a). It is truly amazing to find all these elements in t he Nahuatl tales—a god of knowledge known as the Plumed Serpen t, a goddess of magical powers called Serpent Woman; a b athtub of loam in which earthly elements are mixed with a god 's essence (blood); and the fashioning of Man, male and female , out of the mixture. Even more astounding is the fact that the myth has been pictorially depicted in a Nahuatl codex found in the area of the Mixtec tribe. It shows a god and a goddess mixi ng an ele-"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"Figure 9 ment that flows into a huge flask or vat with the b lood of a god that drips into the flask; out of the mixture, a ma n emerges (Fig. 9b). Coupled with the other Sumerian-related data and ter minol- ogy, contacts at a very early time are indicated. T he evidence, it appears, also challenges the current theories about Man's first migrations to the Americas. By that we do not mean simply the suggestions (made earlier this century at the Inter national Con- gresses of Americanists) that the migration was not from Asia via the Bering Strait in the north but from Australi a/New Zea- land via Antarctica to South America—an idea revive d recently after the discovery in northern Chile, near the bord er with Peru, of buried human mummies 9,000 years old. The trouble we have with both arrival theories is t hat they require the trekking by men, women, and children ov er thou- sands of miles of frozen terrain. We wonder how thi s could have been done 20,000 or 30,000 years ago; moreover, we wonder why such a journey would have been undertaken. Why would men, women, and children journey for thousands of m iles over frozen terrain, seemingly achieving nothing except the experi- ence of more ice—unless they were aware that there was a Promised Land beyond the ice? But how could they know what was beyond the endless ice if The Lost Realm or Cain? 37"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"38 THE LOST REALMS they had not been there yet, nor anyone else before them—for, by definition, they were the first men to cross ove r to the Americas? In the biblical tale of the Exodus from Egypt, the Lord de- scribes the Promised Land as \"a land of wheat and b arley and of the vine and of the fig-tree and of the pomegranate , a land of the olive-tree and of honey... A land whose stones are iron and of whose mountains thou canst hew copper.\" The Azte c god described their Promised Land to them as one of \"ho uses with gold and silver, multicolored cotton and cacao of m any hues.\" Would the early migrants to America have undertaken their im- possible trek had not someone—their god—told them t o go and described to them what to expect? And if that d eity was not a mere theological entity, but a being physically p resent on Earth, could he have helped the migrants overcome t he hard- ships of the journey, just as the biblical Lord had done for the Israelites? It is with such thoughts, of why and how an impossi ble jour- ney would have been undertaken, that we have read a nd reread the Nahuatl tales of migrations and the Four Ages. Since the First Sun had ended with the Deluge, that era had t o be the final phase of the last Ice Age, for we have conclu ded in The 12th Planet that the Deluge was caused by the slipp age of the Antarctic ice sheet into the oceans, thereby bringi ng the last Ice Age to an abrupt end circa 11,000 B.C. Was the legendary original home of the NahuatI trib es called Aztlan, \"The White Place,\" for the simple reason th at that is what it was—a snow-covered land? Is this why the Fi rst Sun was deemed the time of the \"white-haired giants?\" D o Aztec historical recollections, by harking back to the be ginning of the First Sun 17,141 years earlier, in fact speak of a migration into America circa 15,000 B.C., when the ice formed a land -bridge with the Old World? Moreover, could it be that the crossing was not at all across the ice sheet, but by boats acros s the Pacific Ocean, as the NahuatI legends relate? Legends of prehistoric arrival by sea and landings on the Pacific coast are not confined to the Mexican peopl es. Farther south the Andean peoples retained memories of a sim ilar na- ture, told as legends. One, the Legend of Naymlap. may relate to the very first settlement on those coasts by peo ple from else- where. It tells of the arrival of a great fleet of balsa-reed boats (of the kind used by Thor Heyerdahl to simulate Sum erian sea- faring in reed boats).

Some versions of the legend of the green idol pinpo inted Cape Santa Helena in Ecuador as the landing site; th ere the South American continent projects westward into the Pacific. Several of the chroniclers, among them Juan de Vela sco, related native traditions that the first settlers in the eq uatorial regions were giants. The human settlers who followed there worshiped a pantheon of twelve gods, headed by the Sun and th e Moon. Where Ecuador's capital is situated, Velasco wrote, the settlers built two temples facing each other. The temple ded icated to the Sun had in front of its gateway two stone columns, and in its forecourt a circle of twelve stone pillars. The time then came when the leader, Naymlap, his mi ssion accomplished, had to depart. Unlike his successors, he did not die: he was given wings and flew away, never to be seen again —taken heavenward by the god of the speaking stone In believing that divine instructions could be rece ived through a Speaking Stone, the American Indians were in good company: all the ancient peoples of the Old World d escribed and believed in oracle stones, and the Ark that the Israelites had carried during the Exodus was topped by the Dvi r—liter- ally, \"Speaker\"—a portable device through which Mos es could hear the Lord's instructions. The detail concerning the depar- ture of Naymlap by being taken heavenward also has a biblical parallel. We read in Chapter 5 of Genesis that in th e seventh generation of Adam's line through Sheth, the patria rch was Enoch; after he had reached the age of 365 years \"h e was gone\" from the Earth, for the Lord had taken him heavenwa rd. Scholars have a problem with a crossing of the ocea ns by boats 15,000 or 20,000 years ago: Man, they hold, w as too prim- itive then to have oceangoing vessels and navigate the high seas. Not until the Sumerian civilization, at the beginni ng of the fourth millennium B.C., did Mankind begin to attain t he land (wheeled craft) and water (boats) means of long-ran ge transpor- tation. But that, according to the Sumerians themselves, was the course of events after the Deluge. There had been, they stated and restated, a high civilization upon Earth before the Deluge —a civilization begun on Earth by those who had com e from the planet of Anu and continued through a line of l ong-living \"demigods,\" the offspring of intermarriage between the Extra- terrestrials (the biblical Nefilim) and the \"daught ers of Man.\" Egyptian chronicles, such as the writings of the pr iest Manetho. followed the same concept. So of course did the Bibl e, which"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"40 THE LOST REALMS describes both rural life (farming, sheepherding) a nd urban civi- lization (cities, metallurgy) before the Deluge. Al l that, how- ever—according to all those ancient sources—was wip ed off the face of the Earth by the Deluge, and everything had to be restarted from scratch. The Book of Genesis begins with creation tales that are con- cise versions of much more detailed Sumerian texts. In these it consistently speaks of \"the Adam,\" literally \"the E arthling.\" But then it switches to the genealogy of a specific ancestor named Adam: \"This is the book of the generations of Adam\" (Genesis 5:1). He had two sons at first, Cain and Ab el. After Cain killed his brother, he was banished by Yahweh. \"And Adam knew his wife again and she bore a son and. ca lled his name Sheth.\" It is this line, the line of Sheth, th at the Bible follows through a genealogy of patriarchs to Noah, the hero of the Deluge story. The tale then focuses on the Asia n-African- European peoples. But whatever happened to Cain and his line? All we ha ve in the Bible are a dozen verses. Yahweh punished Cain to become a nomad, \"a fugitive and a vagabond on the Earth.\" And Cain went away from the presence of Yahweh and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden. And Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bore En och; And he built a city and called the name of the city by his son's name, Enoch. Several generations later, Lamech was born. He had two wives. Of one Jabal was born; \"he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle.\" Of the other, two sons were born. One, Jubal, \"was the father of all such as pl ay the lyre and pipe.\" The other son, Tubal-Kain, was \"an artificer of gold and copper and iron.\" This meagre biblical information is somewhat augmen ted by the pseudepigraphical Book of Jubilees, believed to have been composed in the second century B.C. from earlier sour ces. Re- lating events to the passage of Jubilees, it states that \"Cain took Awan his sister to be his wife and she bare him Eno ch at the close of the fourth jubilee. And in the first year of the first week of the fifth jubilee, houses were built on Earth, a nd Cain built a city and called its name after the name of his son, Enoch.\" Biblical scholars have long been puzzled by the nami ng of both a descendant of Adam through Sheth and through Cain \"Enoch\" (meaning \"Founding,\" \"Foundation\"), as well as other"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Lost Realm of Cain? 41 similarities in descendants' names. Whatever the re ason, it is evident that the sources on which the Bible's editor s had relied attributed to both Enochs—who were perhaps one preh istoric person—extraordinary deeds. The Book of Jubilees sta tes that Enoch \"was the first among men that were born on Ea rth who learnt writing and knowledge and wisdom and who wro te down the signs of heaven according to their months in a book.\" Ac- cording to the Book of Enoch, this patriarch was tau ght mathe- matics and knowledge of the planets and the calenda r during his heavenly journey, and was shown the location of the \"Seven Metal Mountains\" on Earth, \"in the west.\" The pre-biblical Sumerian texts known as King Lists also relate the story of a pre-Deluvial ruler who was ta ught by the gods all manner of knowledge. His epithet-name was EN.ME.DUR.AN.KI—\"Lord of the Knowledge of the Foun- dations of Heaven and Earth\"—and a very probable pr ototype of the biblical Enochs. The Nahuatl tales of wandering, arrival at a final destination, settling marked by the building of a city; of a pat riarch with two wives and sons of whom tribal nations have evolved; of one that became renowned for being a craftsman in metals—do they not read almost as the biblical tales? Even the Nahuatl stressing of the number seven is reflected in the biblical tales , for the sev- enth descendant through the line of Cain, Lamech, en igmati- cally proclaimed that \"Seven-fold shall Cain be aven ged, and Lamech seventy and seven.\" Are we, then, encountering in the traditions of the seven Nahuatl tribes echoes—olden memories—of the banishe d line of Cain and his son Enoch? The Aztecs called their capital Tenochtitlan, the Ci ty of Ten- och, so naming it after their ancestor. Considering that in their dialect the Aztecs had prefixed many words with the sound T, Tenoch could have originally been Enoch if the pref ixed T is dropped. A Babylonian text based in the opinion of scholars o n an earlier Sumerian text from the third millennium B.C. enigmati- cally relates a conflict, ending in murder, between an earth-till- ing and a shepherding brother, just as the biblical Cain and Abel were. Doomed to \"roam in sorrow,\" the offendin g leader, called Ka'in, migrated to the land of Dunnu and the re \"he built a city with twin towers.\" Twin towers atop the temple-pyramids were a hallmar k of Aztec architecture. Did this commemorate the buildi ng of a \"city with twin towers\" by Ka'in? And was Tenochtit lan, the"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"42 THE LOST REALMS 'City of Tenoch.\" so named and built because Cain, m illennia earlier, \"built a city and called the city by his s on's name, Enoch\"? Have we found in Mesoamerica the lost realm of Cain, the city named after Enoch? The possibility certainly o ffers plausi- ble answers to the enigma of Man's beginnings in th ese do- mains. It may also shed light on two other enigmas—that of the \"Mark of Cain\" and the hereditary trait common to a ll the Amerindians: the absence of facial hair. According to the biblical tale, after the Lord had banished Cain from the settled lands and decreed that he bec ome a wan- derer in the East, Cain was concerned about being s lain by ven- geance seekers. So the Lord, to indicate that Cain w as wandering under the Lord's protection, \"set a sign unto Cain, that any one finding him should not smite him.\" Alt hough no one knows what this distinguishing \"sign\" had been, it has been generally assumed that it was some kind of a tattoo on Cain's forehead. But from the ensuing biblical narrative i t appears that the matter of vengeance and the protection against it continued into the seventh generation and beyond. A tattoo on the fore- head could not last that long nor be transmittable from genera- tion to generation. Only a genetic trait, transmitt ed hereditarily, can fit the biblical data. And, in view of the particular genetic trait of the Amerin- dians—the absence of facial hair—one wonders whethe r it was this genetic change that was the \"mark of Cain\" and his descen- dants. If our guess is right, then Mesoamerica, as a focal point from which Amerindians spread north and south in th e New World, was indeed the Lost Realm of Cain."},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"3 REALM OF THE SERPENT GODS When Tenochtitlan attained its greatness, the Tolte c capital of Tula had already been recalled as the legendary Tol lan. And when the Toltecs had built their city, Teotihuacan was already enshrined in myth. Its name has meant \"Place of the Gods\"; and that, according to recorded tales, was exactly what it had been. It is told that there was a time when calamities be fell the Earth and the Earth fell into darkness, for the sun failed to appear. Only at Teotihuacan there was light, for a divine flame remained burning there. The concerned gods gathered at Teoti- huacan, wondering what should be done. \"Who shall g overn and direct the world,\" they asked each other, unles s they could make the sun reappear?. They asked for a volunteer among the gods to jump i nto the divine flame and, by his sacrifice, bring back the sun. The god Tecuciztecatl volunteered. Putting on his glitterin g attire he stepped forward toward the flame; but each time he neared the fire he stepped back, losing courage. Then the god Nanauatzin volunteered and unhesitatingly jumped into the fire . Thus shamed, Tecuciztecatl followed suit; but he landed only at the flame's edge. As the gods were consumed, the Sun an d Moon reappeared in the skies. But though they could now be seen, the two luminarie s re- mained motionless in the sky.

After the Sun had resumed its motion, the Moon too began to move; and so was the cycle of day and night resumed and the Earth was saved.

Whatever the legend, the fact is that the Pyramid o f the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon still rise majestically to this very day.

T his would certainly conform to the Aztec legends that s poke of this Place of the Gods as existing in the Fourth Sun. Th en, when the Day of Darkness happened circa 1400 B.C., the two gr eat pyra- mids were raised to their monumental sizes. The Pyramid of the Moon rises at the northern end o f this ceremonial center, flanked by smaller auxiliary str uctures and fronted by a great plaza. From there a wide avenue runs south- ward as far as the eye can see; it is flanked by lo w-profile shrines, temples, and other structures that were be lieved to have been tombs; consequently the avenue was given the name Avenue of the Dead. Some 2,000 feet to the south th e Avenue of the Dead reaches the Pyramid of the Sun that ris es on the eastern side of the avenue (Fig. 11) beyond a plaza and a series of shrines and other structures. Past the Pyramid of the Sun, and another 3,000 feet south- ward, one reaches the Ciudadela, a quadrangle that c ontains at its eastern side the third pyramid of Teotihuacan, called the Quetzalcoatl Pyramid. It is now known that facing t he Ciuda- dela, across the Avenue of the Dead, there existed a similar quadrangle that served mostly as a lay administrati ve-commer- cial center. The avenue then continues further sout h; the Teoti- huacan Mapping Project led by Rend Millon in the 196 0s established that this north-south avenue extended f or nearly five miles—longer than the longest runways at moder n airports. In spite of this remarkable length, the wide avenue runs straight as an arrow—quite a technological feat at any time. An east-west axis, perpendicular to the north-south ave- nue, extended eastward from the Ciudadela and westwa rd from the administrative quadrangle. Members of the Teoti huacan Mapping Project found south of the Pyramid of the S un a marker chiseled into the rocks in the shape of a cr oss within two concentric circles; a similar marker was found abou t two miles to the west, on a mountainside. A sight line connec ting the two markers precisely indicates the direction of the ea st-west axis, and the other arms of the crosses match the orienta tion of the north-south axis. The researchers concluded that th ey had found markers used by the city's original planners; they did not offer a theory to explain what means were used in a ntiquity to draw a headline between two such distant spots. That the ceremonial center had been oriented and la id out deliberately is evident from several other facts. T he first one is that the San Juan river that flows in the Teotihuac an valley has"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Figure 11 been deliberately diverted where it crosses the cer emonial center: artificial channels divert the river to flo w at the Ciuda- dela and along the quadrangle facing it exactly par allel to the east-west axis, then after two precise right-angle turns along the west-leading avenue. The second fact indicating a deliberate orientation is that the two axes are not pointing to the cardinal points, b ut are tilted to the southeast by 15 1/2 degrees (Fig. 11). Studies show that this was not an accident or a miscalculation by the anci ent planners. A. F. Aveni (Astronomy in Ancient Mesoamerica), cal ling this a \"sacred orientation,\" points out that later ceremon ial centers (such as Tula and ones even farther away) adhered t o this orien- 46 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"Realm of the Serpent Gods 47 tation although it made no sense at their locations and when they were built. The conclusion of his researches w as that, at Teotihuacan and at the time of its construction, th e orientation was devised to enable celestial observations on cer tain key dates of the calendar. Zelia Nuttal, in a paper delivered to the twenty-se cond Inter- national Congress of Americanists (Rome, 1926) sugg ested that the orientation was keyed to the passage of the Sun at the ob- server's zenith, which occurs twice a year as the S un appears to move from north to south and back. If such celestia l observa- tions were the purpose of the pyramids, their ultim ate shape— step pyramids equipped with staircases, leading to presumed viewing-temples on the topmost platform—would make sense. However, because strong evidence suggests that what we now see are the latest outer layers of the two major py ramids (and as arbitrarily resurfaced by archaeologists, to boot), one cannot state for certain that these pyramids' original pur pose was not a different one. The possibility, even probability, t hat the stair- ways were a late addition is suggested to us by the fact that the first stage of the grand stairway of the Sun Pyrami d is tilted and improperly aligned with the pyramid's orientation ( Fig. 12).

One amazing similarity: although the Seco nd Pyra- mid at Giza is shorter than the Great Pyramid, thei r peaks are at the same height above sea level because the Seco nd Pyramid is built on correspondingly higher ground; the same holds true at Teotihuacan, where the smaller Pyramid of the Mo on is built on ground some thirty feet higher than that of the Pyramid of the Sun, giving their peaks equal height above sea level. The similarities are especially obvious between the two greater pyramids. Both are built on artificial plat forms. Their sides measure almost the same: about 7S4 feet in Gi za, about 745 feet at Teotihuacan, and the latter would fit n eatly into the former (Fig. 14). Figure 14 While such similarities and correspondences bespeak a hid- den link between the two sets of pyramids, one need not ignore the existence of certain and considerable differenc es. The Great Pyramid of Giza is built of large stone blocks, car efully shaped and matched and held together without mortar, weigh ing an aggregate 7,000,000 tons with a mass of 93,000,000 cubic feet. The Sun Pyramid was built of mud bricks, adobe, peb bles, and gravel, held together by a sheath of crude stones a nd stucco, with an aggregate mass of only 10,000,000 cubic fee t. The Giza pyramid contains an inner complex of corridors, gal leries, and chambers of intricate and precise construction; the Teotihuacan pyramid does not appear to have such inner structur es. The one at Giza rises to a height of 480 feet, the Sun Pyra mid (including the erstwhile uppermost temple) to a mere 250. The Great Pyra- mid has four triangular sides that rise at the tric ky angle of 52 degrees; the two at Teotihuacan consist of stages t hat rest one atop the other, with sides that slope inward for st ability, begin- ning with a slope of 43 1/2 degrees. These are significant differences that reflect the different"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"50 THE LOST REALMS times and purposes of each set of pyramids. But in the very last difference lies, hitherto unnoticed to all previous researchers, a key to the solution of some puzzles. The rather steep angle of 52 degrees has been attai ned in Egypt only in the Giza pyramids, which were built n either by Cheops or any other Pharaoh (as proven in previous b ooks of The Earth Chronicles) but by the gods of the ancien t Near East, as beacons for landing at their spaceport in the Si nai peninsula. All the other Egyptian pyramids—lesser, smaller, de cayed, or collapsed—were indeed built by Pharaohs, millennia later, in emulation of the gods' \"stairways to heaven.\" But no ne suc- ceeded in attaining the perfect angle of 52 degrees and when- ever this was attempted, the attempt ended in colla pse. The lesson was learned when the Pharaoh Sneferu (ci rca 2650 B.C.) embarked on his grasp for monumental glo ry. In a brilliant analysis of the ancient events, K. Mendel ssohn (The Riddle of the Pyramids) suggested that Sneferu's ar chitects were building his second one at Dahshur when his first o ne. built at Maidum at the 52 degree angle, collapsed. The archi tects then hurriedly changed the angle of the Dahshur pyramid to the safer 43 1/2 degrees in midconstruction, giving that pyra mid the shape and thus the name The Bent Pyramid (Fig. 15a). Still deter- mined to leave behind a true pyramid, Sneferu then proceeded to build a third one nearby; it is called the Red P yramid for the color of its stones, and it rises at the safe angle of 43 1/2 degrees (Fig. 15b). But in this retreat to the safety of 43 1/2 degrees , Sneferu's architects in fact fell back to a choice made more than a century earlier, circa 2700 B.C. by the Pharaoh Zoser. His pyramid, the earliest pharaonic one that still stands (at Sakkar a), was a step pyramid that rose in six stages (Fig. 15c) conformi ng to the shallower angle of 43 1/2 degrees. Figure 15"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"Realm of the Serpen! Gods 51 Is it only a coincidence that the Pyramid of the Su n and the Great Pyramid of Giza have the same base measuremen ts? Per- haps. Is it by mere chance that the precise 43 1/2 degree angle adopted by the Pharaoh Zoser and perfected in his s tep-pyra- mid was followed at Teotihuacan? We doubt it. Where as a shal- lower angle, say 45 degrees, could have been attain ed by an unsophisticated architect simply by diving in two a right angle (90 degrees), the 43 1/2 degree angle resulted in E gypt from a sophisticated adaptation of the factor Pi (about 3. 14), which is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diamet er. The 52 degree angle of the Giza pyramids required f amiliar- ity with this factor; it was attained by giving the pyramid a height (H) equal to half the side (S) divided by Pi and multi- plied by four (754/2 = 377/3.14 = 120 x 4 = 480 fee t in height). The angle of 43 1/2 degrees was attained b y reducing the height from a final multiple of four to a multiple of three. In both instances, knowledge of pi was required; and t here is abso- lutely nothing to indicate such knowledge among the peoples of Mesoamerica. How then did the 43 1/2 degree angle a ppear in the structures of the two unique (to Mesoamerica) pyram ids of Teo- tihuacan, if not through someone familiar with the constructions of the Egyptian pyramids? Except for the unique Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypti an pyr- amids were equipped only with a lower passageway (s ee Figs. 15) that usually began at or near the edge of the p yramid's base and continued under it. Should one ascribe to mere coincidence the existence of such a passageway under the Pyrami d of the Sun? The accidental discovery was made in 1971, after he avy rain- falls. Just in front of the pyramid's central stair way, a subterra- nean cavity was unearthed. It contained ancient ste ps that led some twenty feet down to an entrance into a horizon tal passage- way. The excavators concluded it was a natural cave that had been artificially enlarged and improved, running un der the bed- rock on which the pyramid was built. That the origi nal cave was converted to some purpose intentionally is evidence d by the fact that the ceiling is made of heavy stone blocks and that the tun- nel's walls are smoothed with plaster. At various p oints along this subterranean passageway adobe walls divert its course at sharp angles. About 150 feet from the ancient stairway, the tunne l sprouts two elongated side chambers, like spread wings; it is a spot ex- actly under the first stage of the step-pyramid. Fr om there the subterranean passageway, generally about seven feet high, con- tinues for almost another 200 feet; in this inner p ortion the con-"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"52 THE LOST REALMS struction becomes more complex, using a variety of materials; the floors, laid in segments, were man-made; draina ge pipes were provided for now unknown purposes (perhaps con nected to an underground watercourse now extinct). Finally , the tunnel ends below the fourth stage of the pyramid in a hol lowed-out area that resembles a cloverleaf, supported by adob e columns and basalt slabs. What was the purpose of the complex subterranean st ruc- ture? Since the segmenting walls had been breached before the discovery in modern times, it is not possible to sa y whether the remains of clay vessels, obsidian blades and charco al ashes be- long to the earliest phase of the tunnel's use. But the question of what, besides celestial observation, was going on a t Teotihua- can, has been compounded by other discoveries. The Avenue of the Dead seems to stretch as a wide, smooth runway from the plaza of the Pyramid of the Moon to the southern horizon; but in fact its smooth flow is in terrupted in a section situated between the Pyramid of the Sun and the San Juan river. The overall slope from the Pyramid of t he Moon to the Pyramid of the Sun is even more accentuated in this section of the Avenue, and the on-site examination clearly indicates that the slope was achieved by deliberate cutting i nto the native rock; overall, the drop from the Pyramid of the Moo n to a point past the Ciudadela is some ninety feet. Here six seg ments have been created by the erection of a series of double walls perpen- dicularly to the course of the Avenue. The Avenue's cavity is further lined with walls and low structures, result ing in six se- misubterranean compartments open to the sky. The pe rpendicu- lar walls are fitted with sluices at their floor le vel. The impression is that the whole complex served to chan nel water that flowed down the Avenue. The flow may have begu n at the Pyramid of the Moon (where a subterranean tunnel wa s found encircling it), and been linked in some manner to t he subterra- nean tunnel of the Pyramid of the Sun. The series o f compart- ments then retained and eventually let out the wate r from one to the other, until ultimately the water reached th e diverting channel of the San Juan river. Could these artificially flowing and cascading water s have been the reason for decorating the facade of the Qu etzalcoatl Pyramid with wavy waters—at an inland site, hundred s of miles away from any sea? The association of this inland site with water is f urther sug- gested by the discovery of a huge stone statue of Ch alchiuhtli- cue, the goddess of water and the spouse of Tlaloc, the rain god. The statue (Fig. 16), now on exhibit at the Nationa l Museum of"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"Figure 16 Anthropology in Mexico City, was found standing in t he center of the plaza in front of the Pyramid of the Moon. I n her picto- rial depictions, the goddess, whose name means \"Lad y of Waters,\" was usually shown wearing a jade skirt dec orated with conch shells. Her adornments were turquoise earring s and a necklace of jade or other blue-green stones from wh ich there hung a gold medallion. The statue repeats these dre ss and deco- rative elements, and it appears that it was also ad orned with an actual golden pendant, embedded in an appropriate c avity, which has been removed by robbers. Her pictorial de pictions often showed her wearing a crown of serpents or oth erwise adorned with them, indicating her being one of the serpent gods of the Mexicans. Was Teotihuacan laid out and constructed as some ki nd of a waterworks, employing water for some technological processes? Before we answer the question, let us mention anothe r puzzling discovery there. Alongside the third segment down from the Pyramid o f the Sun, excavations of a series of interconnected subt erranean chambers revealed that some of the floors were cove red with layers of thick sheets of mica. This is a silicone whose special properties make it resistant to water, heat, and el ectrical cur- rents. It has therefore been used as an insulator i n various chemical processes and electrical and electronic ap plications, and in recent times in nuclear and space technologi es. The particular properties of mica depend to some ex tent on its content of other trace minerals, and thus on it s geographic source. According to expert opinions, the mica foun d at Teoti- huacan is of a type that is found only in faraway Br azil. Traces of this mica were also found on remains removed fro m the Pyra- Realm of the Serpent Gods 53"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"54 THE LOST REALMS mid of the Sun's stages when it was being uncovered early in this century. What was the use to which this insulating material was put at Teotihuacan? Our own impression is that the presence of the Lord and Lady of Water alongside the principal deity, Quetza tcoatl; the sloping avenue; the series of structures, subterran ean chambers, tunnels; the diverted river; the semisubterranean s ections with their sluices; and the underground compartments lin ed with mica—were all components of a scientifically concei ved plant for the separation, refining or purification of min eral sub- stances. Whether in the middle of the first millennium B.C., o r more probably in the middle of the second millennium B.C., someone familiar with the secrets of pyramid building had c ome to this valley; and equally knowledgeable in the physical s ciences, cre- ated from locally available materials a sophisticat ed processing plant. Was this someone in search of gold, as the p endant of the Lady of Water would suggest, or of some other, even rarer min- eral? And if it was not Man—was it his gods, just as the legends concerning Teotihuacan and its very name have sugge sted all along? Who, besides the gods, were the original dwellers o f Teoti- huacan? Who had carried the stones and mortar to ra ise its first pyramids? Who had channeled the waters and operated the sluices? Those who assume that Teotihuacan is no older than a few centuries B.C. have a simple answer: the Toltecs. Tho se who now lean toward a much earlier beginning have start ed to point to the Olmecs, an enigmatic people who emerged on t he Me- soamerican scene in the middle of the second millen nium B.C. But the Olmecs themselves pose many puzzles, for the y appear to have been black Africans; and that too is anathe ma to those who simply cannot accept transatlantic crossings mi llennia ago. Even if the origin of Teotihuacan and its builders is shrouded in mystery, it is almost certain that in the centur ies preceding the Christian era Toltec tribesmen began to drift in . At first performing manual chores, they gradually learned th e city's crafts and adopted the culture of its masters, incl uding picture- writing, the secrets of goldsmithing, knowledge of astronomy and the calendar, and the worship of the gods. Circa 200 B.C. whoever had lorded over Teotihuacan picked up and l eft, and the place became a Toltec city. For centuries it wa s renowned for its tools, weapons, and artifacts made of obsid ian stone, and"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"Realm of the Serpent Gods 55 its cultural and religious influence extended widel y. Then, a thousand years after they had drifted in, the Tolte cs too packed up and left. No one knows why; but the departure wa s total and Teotihuacan became a desolate place, living only in memories of a golden past. Some believe that the event coincided with the esta blishment of Tollan as the Toltecs' new capital, circa AD . 700. A place of human settlement for millennia on the banks of the Tula river, it was built up by the Toltecs as a mini-Teotihuacan. Codices and lore described Tollan as a legendary city, a center of arts and crafts, resplendent in its palaces and temples, gli ttering with gold and precious stones. But for a long time schola rs ques- tioned its very existence... Now it is known beyond doubt that Tollan did indeed exist, at a site nowadays called Tula, some fifty miles northwest of Mexico City. The rediscovery of Tollan began toward the end of t he nine- teenth century and the beginning of the process is mainly asso- ciated with the French traveller Desire Charnay (Les anciennes villes du nouveau monde). Serious excavation work b egan only in the 1940s under the leadership of the Mexican ar chaeologist Jorge R. Acosta. This work of excavation and restora tion fo- cused on the principal ceremonial compound referred to as Tula Grande; later work, as that by teams from the Unive rsity of Mississippi, expanded the area of unearthing the pa st. The discoveries confirmed not only the city's exist ence but also its history as told in various codices, especi ally the one known as Anales de Cuauhtitlan. It is now known that Tollan was ruled by a dynasty of priest-kings who claimed to have been descendants of the god Quetzalcoatl and therefore, in addition to their given name, also bore the god's name as a patronym—a custom that was prevalent among the Egyptian pharao hs. Some of these priest-kings were warriors, bent on expand ing Toltec rule; others were more concerned with the faith. In the second half of the tenth century A . D . the ruler was Ce Acatl Topiltzin- Quetzalcoatl; his name and time are certain because a portrait of his, accompanied by a date equivalent to A . D . 968, can still be seen carved on a rock overlooking the site of the c ity. It was in his time that a religious, conflict broke out among the Toltecs; it seems that it concerned the demand by part of the priesthood to introduce human sacrifices in order t o pacify the War God. In A . D . 987 Topiltzin-Quetzalcoatl and his followers left Tollan and migrated eastward, emulating the ea rlier legend- ary departure of the divine Quetzalcoatl. They sett led in Yuca- tan. Two centuries later natural calamities and onslaugh ts by"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"56 THE LOST REALMS other tribesmen brought the Toltecs to their knees. The calami- ties were deemed signs of divine wrath, foretelling the city's doom. The chronicler Sahagun recorded that in the e nd the ruler, who many think was called Huemac but who als o bore the patronym Quetzalcoatl, convinced the Toltecs that T ollan must be abandoned. \"And so they left by his command, alt hough they had lived there many years and had built beaut iful and large houses and their temples and their palaces... At last they had to depart, leaving their houses, their lands, t heir city and their riches, and since they could not take all the ir wealth with them, they buried many things, and even today some of them are brought up from under the ground and not withou t admira- tion for their beauty and workmanship.\" Thus it was that in AD . 1168 or thereabouts Tollan became a desolate city, left to decay and disintegrate. It i s told that when the first Aztec chieftain laid eyes on the city's r emains, he cried bitterly. The destructive forces of nature were aid ed by in- vaders, marauders, and robbers who desecrated the t emples, toppled monuments, and wrecked whatever was left st anding. And so Tollan, flattened and forgotten, became only a legend. What is known about Tollan eight centuries later at tests to the appropriateness of its name, which means \"Place of many neighborhoods\"; for it appears to have consisted of many neigh- borhoods and precincts that occupied as much as sev en square miles. As at Teotihuacan (which its planners tried to emulate), Tollan's heart was a sacred precinct that extended along a mile- long north-south axis; it was flanked by ceremonial groups built with an east-west orientation perpendicular t o the north- south axis. As we have already noted, the orientati ons were given the \"sacred tilt\" of Teotihuacan, although at the period and geographic location of Tollan it no longer made astronomi- cal sense. At what might have been the northern limit of the s acred precinct there were found the remains of an unusual structure. In front it was built like a regular step-pyramid w ith its stair- case; but in the back the structure is circular and was probably surmounted by a tower. The building might have serv ed as an observatory; it certainly could have been a model f or the later Aztec temple of Quetzalcoatl in Tenochtitlan and fo r other cir- cular observatory pyramids elsewhere in Mexico. The principal ceremonial compound, about a mile awa y to the south, was laid out around a large central squa re in the midst of which stood the Great Altar. The main temp le stood atop a large five-stage pyramid on the square's eas tern side.

Elongated buildings or vestibules whose roofs rested on rows of pillars co nnected the two pyramids and also lined the square's southern s ide. A ball- court for the sacred tlachtli rubber-ball game comp leted the square on the west (Fig. 17, an artist's reconstruc tion suggested by the archaeologist P. Salazar Ortegon). Between this principal compound of Tula Grande and t he northern edge of the sacred precinct, various struc tures and groups of buildings evidently existed; another ball court was ex- cavated. In the particular compounds and throughout the pre- cinct, relatively many stone statues have been foun d. These include not only those of animals, such as a famili ar coyote and an unfamiliar tiger, but also of a reclining demigo d called Chac- mool (Fig. 18). The Toltecs also sculpted statues o f their chief- tains, depicting them mostly as men of short statur e.

When methodical and sustained archaeological work b egan in the 1940s under Jorge R. Acosta, attention was di rected at the Great Pyramid, which, facing the Great Altar, p rovided an obvious astronomical purpose. At the time the archa eologists wondered why the local Indians referred to the deso late mound as El Tesoro, The Treasure; but when several artifa cts of gold were found after excavations began, the workmen ins isted that the pyramid rose atop a \"field of gold\" and refused to continue work. \"Be it reality or superstition,\" Acosta wrote , \"the result was that work stopped and was never resumed.\" Work then focused on the smaller pyramid that has v ariably been referred to (at first) as Pyramid of the Moon, then as Pyra- mid \"B,\" and lately as the Quetzalcoatl Pyramid. Th e designa- tion stems primarily from the long native name for the mound that means \"Lord of the Morning Star,\" presumably o ne of the epithets of Quetzalcoatl, and from the remains of c olored plas- terwork and low reliefs that adorned the pyramid's stages, evi- dencing that its rich decorations were dominated by the Feathered Serpent motif. Archaeologists also believ e that two 58 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"Realm of the Serpent Gods 59 round stone columns, several of whose sections have been found, were carved with the Feathered Serpent image and stood as gateway pillars at the entrance to the temple at op this pyra- mid. The greatest archaeological treasure trove was foun d when the Acosta teams realized that the northern side of this pyramid was disturbed in pre-Hispanic times. A ramplike agg regate seemed to run down the middle of this side, replaci ng the stepped incline. Excavating there, the archaeologis ts found that a trench had been cut through this side of the pyra mid, reaching well into its interior; and the trench, which was a s high as the pyramid, was used to bury in it a great number of s tone sculp- tures. When these were taken out, stood up and fitt ed together, it became clear that these were sections of the two round gate- way columns, four square columns that are believed to have held up the roof of the pyramid's temple, and four colossal hu- manlike statues, more than fifteen feet high, that came to be known as the Atlanles (Fig. 20). Believed to have al so served as caryatids (sculptures used as pilasters to uphold a roof or its beams), they were re-erected by the archaeologists atop the pyr- amid when the restoration work was completed. Each one of the Atlantes (as illustrated in Fig. 21 ) consists of four sections that were carved to fit together. The topmost sec- tion forms the statue's head, showing the giants we aring a head- dress of feathers held together by a band decorated with star symbols; two elongated objects cover the ears. The facial fea- tures are not readily identifiable and so far have defied compari- son with any known racial group; but although the f our faces hold the same remote expression, a close examinatio n shows them to be slightly different and individual. The torso is made up of two sections. The upper or breast section's main feature is a thick breastplate whose shape has been compared to a butterfly. The lower part of the torso has its main feature on the back; it is a disk with a human face in its center, surrounded by undeciphered symbols and, in the opin- ion of some, a \"wreath\" of two entwined serpents. T he bottom section provides the giant's thighs, legs, and sand aled feet. Rib- bons hold these accoutrements in place; armbands, a nklets, and a loincloth are included in the elaborate attire (s ee Fig. 21). Whom do these giant statues represent? Their first discov- erers called them \"idols,\" certain that they repres ented deities. Popular writers nicknamed them Atlantes, which impl ied both that they might have been offspring of the Goddess Atlatona, \"She Who Shines in the Water,\" and also that they m ight have come from the legendary Atlantis.

At the same tim e, the weapon held in the right hand (Fig. 22a) is not cur ved as the atl-atl must be; what is it, then? The instrument looks rather like a pistol in its ho lster, held by two fingers. An interesting theory suggesting th at it was not a weapon but a tool, a \"plasma pistol,\" was advanced by Gerardo Level (Mision Fatal). He discovered that one of the square pi- lasters depicting Toltec chieftains has, engraved i n an upper- left-hand corner (Fig. 22b), the image of a person wearing a backpack and holding the tool in question; he uses it as a flamethrower to shape a stone (Fig. 22c). The tool is unques- "},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"Figure 21 tionably the same instrument held by the giants\" ri ght hands. Levet suggests that it was a high-energy \"pistol\" t hat was used to cut and carve stones, and he points out that suc h Thermo-Jet torches were used in modern time to carve the giant monument of Georgia's Stone Mountain. The significance of Levet's discovery may go beyond his own theory. Since stone Stellas and carvings have been found throughout Mesoamerica, the product of its native a rtists, one need not search for high-tech tools to explain the stone carvings. On the other hand, the depicted tool may serve to e xplain an- other enigmatic aspect of Tollan. As they examined the depths of the pyramid after th ey had removed the ramp's soil, the archaeologists discove red that the external and visible pyramid was built over and hid an earlier pyramid whose stepped stages lay some eight feet aw ay on each side. They also discovered remains of vertical wall s that sug- gested the existence of inner chambers and passages within the earlier pyramid (but have not pursued these leads). They did come upon an extraordinary feature—a stone pipe mad e of perfectly fitting tubular sections (Fig. 23) with a n inner diame- ter of about eighteen inches. The long pipe was ins talled inside the pyramid at the same angle as its original incli ne and ran through its whole height. Acosta and his team presumed that the pipe had serv ed to drain rainwater; but this could have been achieved without such an elaborate internal installation, and with simple clay pipes rather than by precision-sculpted stone sections. T he position and incline of the unusual, if not unique, tubular contraption was obviously part of the original plan of the pyra mid and inte- Realm of the Serpent Gods 61"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"gral to the structure's purpose.

What comes to our mind is this: Was the enigmatic t ool a tool not to engrave stones, but to break up stones for their ores? Was it, in other words, a sophisticated mining tool ?

It was reported by several Spa nish chron- iclers, particularly Friar Ramon Ordonez y Aguiar an d Bishop Nunez de la Vega. It was later collected from its v arious sources by the Abbe E. C. Brasseur de Bourbourg (Histoire de n ations civilisees du mexique). The legend relates the arri val in Yucatan, circa 1000 B.C. by the chroniclers' calculations, of \"the first man whom God had sent to this region to people and parc el out the land that is now called America.\" His name was Vota n (mean- ing unknown); his emblem was the Serpent. \"He was a descen- dant of the Guardians, of the race of Can. His plac e of origin was a land called Chivim.\" He made a total of four v oyages. The first time he landed he established a settlemen t near the coast. After some time he advanced inland and \"at t he tributary of a great river built a city which was the cradle of this civiliza- tion.\" He called the city Nachan, \"which means Plac e of Ser- pents.\" On his second visit he surveyed the newfoun d land, examining its subterranean zones and underground pa ssages; one such passage was said to have gone right throug h a moun- tain near Nachan.

Except for a few cities that were walled, Maya cities were in reality open-ended ceremonial centers surrounded by a population of administrator s, artisans, and merchants, and supported by an extensive rural population. In these centers each successive ruler added new st ructures or enlarged older ones by building bigger edifices ove r the pre- vious ones, like adding a new layer of skin over an onion. And then, five centuries before the Spanish arrival , for rea- sons unknown, the Maya abandoned their sacred citie s and let the jungle take them over. Palenque, one of the earliest Maya cities, is situa ted near the Mexican-Guatemalan border and is reachable from the modern city Villahermosa. In the seventh century A .

Several years o f excavation and removal of the soil and debris that filled and hid the inner structure yielded in the end a most exciting discov ery: a burial chamber (Fig. 27).

When this stone lid was moved, there cam e into view the skeletal remains of a tall man, still bedecked with pearls and jade jewelry. His face was covered with a mosaic ja de mask; a small jade pendant bearing the image of a deity lay among the beads that once were a jade collar. The discovery was astounding, for until then no oth er pyra- mid or temple in Mexico had been found to have serv ed as a tomb.

Others, prompted to revised interpretations by the fact tha t tne depic- tion is framed by a Sky Band, a chain of glyphs tha t represent celestial bodies and the zodiac constellations, reg ard the scene as showing the king being carried by the Celestial S erpent to the celestial realm of the gods.

Buried some twenty feet below the ground w as found the skeleton of an unusually tall man. His body was placed on a platform of stone masonry, he was bedecked with jad e jewelry, and was surrounded (as at Palenque) by pearls, jade objects, and pottery. Also, depictions of persons carried in the jaws of fiery serpents (whom scholars call Sky Gods) are kn own from various Maya sites, such as this one (Fig. 29) from Chichen Itza. All considered, scholars have admitted that \"one ca nnot avoid an implicit comparison to the crypts of the E gyptian pha- raohs.

S. G. Morley, The Ancient Maya) believed that Tikal wa s not only the largest Maya city but also the earliest. Situat ed in the north- eastern part of Guatamela's province of Peten, Tika l still raises its tall pyramids high above the jungle's sea of gr een. It is so large that its boundaries seem to be constantly exp anding as more remains are found. Its main ceremonial center alone covers more than a square mile; the space for it wa s not only hacked out of the rain forest; it was physically cr eated atop a mountain ridge that was laboriously flattened out. The flanking ravines were converted into water reservoirs linked by a series of causeways. Tikal's pyramids, tightly grouped together in sever al sec- tions, are a marvel of construction. Tall and narro w, they are true skyscrapers, rising steeply to heights nearing and even ex- ceeding 200 feet. Rising in sheer stages, the pyrami ds served as raised platforms for the temples that stood atop th em.

There were as a rule five exterior and seven interior doorways, a total of twelve—a sy mbolism whose meaning has not attracted, so far, particular attention. The construction of an airstrip near Tikal's ruins speeded up its exploration after 1950 and extensive archaeolog ical work has been conducted there especially by teams from The U niversity Museum, University of Pennsylvania.

The Maya had, indeed, not one but three calendars; but one —the most significant one in our opinion—had nothin g to do with astronomy. It is the so-called Long Count. It s tated a date by counting the number of days that had passed from a certain starting day to the day of the event recorded by th e Maya on the stela or monument. That enigmatic Day One. most Sch olars now agree, was August 13, 3113 B.C. according to the current Christian calendar—a time and an event that clearly preceded the emergence of the Maya civilization. The Long Count, like the two other time-reckoning sy stems, was based on the vigesimal (\"times twenty\") mathema tical sys- tem of the Maya, and—as in ancient Sumer—employed t he \"place\" concept, whereby 1 in the first column woul d be one. in the next column twenty, then four hundred, and so o n. The Maya Long Count dating system, using vertical column s where values were lowest at the bottom, named these vario us multi- ples and identified them with glyphs (Fig. 33).

But, as stated, in their actual calendrical dating o n their monuments, the Maya went back not to the age of the dinosaurs but to a specific day, an event as crucial to them as the date of Christ's birth is to the followers of the Christian c alendar.

This Calen- dar Round of 52 years was sacred to all the peoples of ancient Mesoamerica and they related to it events both past and future —such as the messianic expectation of the return of Quetzal- coatl.

The other is cyclical, geared to a peculiar period of 260 days; scholars are still trying to guess what, if a nything, hap- pened or still happens once every 260 days. Some believe that this cycle is purely mathematical : since five cycles of 52 years is 260 years, somehow a sho rter count of 260 days was adopted. But such an explanation of 260 only shifts the problem to a need to explain 52: where, then, is the origin and reason for 52? Others suggest that the period of 260 days had to d o with agriculture, such as the iength of the rainy season or the dry intervals. In view of the Mayan propensity for astr onomy, others attempt to somehow calculate a relationship between 260 days and the motions of Venus or Mars. One must won der why a solution offered by Zelia Nuttal at the twenty-se cond Interna- tional Congress of Americanists (Rome, 1926) did not gain the full recognition it deserves. She pointed out that the easiest way for the people of the New World to apply seasonal m ovements of the Sun to their own locality was to determine Z enith Days, when the Sun passed precisely overhead at midday. T his hap- pens twice a year as the Sun appears to travel nort hward, then southward, passing overhead twice. The Indians, she suggested, measured the interval between the two Zenith Days a nd the resulting number of days became the basis for the Ca lendar Round. This interval is half a solar year at the equator; it lengthens as one moves away, northward or southward. At 15 de grees north, for example, it is 263 days (from August 12 to the follow- ing May 1). This is the rainy season and to this da y the descen- dants of the Maya begin planting on May 3 (convenie ntly also the Mexican Day of the Holy Cross).

It was commemorated by a square monument known as Altar Q on which the sixteen astronomers that to ok part in the conclave were portrayed, four to a side (Fig. 3 5). It will be noted that the \"teardrop\" glyph in front of their n oses—as was done on the Pacal depiction—identifies them as Skyw atchers. The date carved on this monument appears on monumen ts at other Maya sites, suggesting that the decisions rea ched at Copan were applied throughout the realm. Figure 35 The reputation of the Maya as accomplished astronom ers has been enhanced by the fact that their various codice s contain astronomical sections dealing with solar and lunar eclipses and the planet Venus. Closer study of the data revealed, however, that these were not records of observations by the Maya astron- omers. Rather, they were almanacs copied from some e arlier sources that provided the Maya with ready-made data against which they were to look for phenomena applicable to the 260- day cycle. As stated by E. Hadingham (Early Man and the"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":" Figure 36 Cosmos), these almanacs displayed \"a curious blend o f long- term exactness and short-term inaccuracy.\" The main task of the local astronomers, it appears, was to keep verifying or adjusting the 260-day sacred year against data from earlier times that dealt with the movements of celestial bodies. Indeed, the most renowned and still standin g observa- tory in Yucatan, the Caracol in Chichen Itza (Fig. 36), has frus- trated successive researchers who had tried, in vai n, to find in its orientation and aperture viewlines to the solst ices or equi- noxes. Some viewlines, however, do seem to be relat ed to the Tzolkin (260-day) cycle. But why the number 260? Just because it happened to equal the number of days between Zeniths at Copan? Why not , say, the easier number 300 if a site near latitude 20° n orth would have been chosen, such as Teotihuacan? The number 260 appears to have been an arbitrary, d eliber- ate choice; the explanation that it results from mu ltiplying a natural number, 20 (the number of fingers and toes) , by 13 only shifts the problem to the question, Why and Where f rom 13?

The Haab calendar also considers 360 as its basic l ength, divid- ing this number into 18 \"months\" of 20 days; it rou nds off the year by the addition of 5 \"bad days\" to complete th e solar cycle of 365. All three calendars thus are based on numbers that are not natural, numbers deliberately selected. We will sho w that both 260 and 360 reached Mesoamerica from Mesopotamia—vi a Egypt. We are all familiar with the number 360: it is the number of degrees in a circle. But few know that we owe the nu mber to the Sumerians, and that it stems from their sexagesimal (\"Base 60\") mathematical system. The first known calendar was t he Nippur Calendar of the Sumerians; it was devised by dividin g the circle of 360 into 12 parts, twelve being the sacred celes tial number from which followed the twelve months of the year, the twelve houses of the zodiac, the twelve Olympian gods, and so on. The problem of the shortfall of 5 1/4 days was solved b y intercalation —the addition of a thirteenth month after the passa ge of a number of years. Although the Egyptian arithmetical system was not s exagesi- mal, they adopted the Sumerian system of 12 x 30 = 360. But unable to pursue the very complex calculations invo lved in in- tercalation, they simplified matters by rounding of f each year by having a short \"month\" of five days at year's end. It was this very system that was adopted in Mesoamerica. The Ha ab calen- dar was not just similar to the Egyptian one, it wa s identical to it. Moreover, just as the Mesoamericans had a ritua l year along- side the solar one, so did the Egyptians have a rit ual year relat- ing to the rising of the star Sirius and the rising at the same time of the waters of the Nile. The Sumerian imprint on the Egyptian and hence Meso - american calendars was not limited to the sexagesim al number 360. Various studies, principally by B. P. Reko, in t he early issues of El Mexico Antiguo, leave little doubt tha t the thirteen months of the Tzolkin calendar were in fact a refle ction of the 12-month system of the Sumerians plus the thirteent h interca- lary month, except that in Egypt (and hence in Meso america) the thirteenth month had shrunk to an annual 5 days . The term tun for 360 meant in the Maya language \"celestial,\" a star or planet within the zodiacal band. Interestingly, a \" heap of stars\" —a constellation—was called Mool, virtually the sam e term MUL that the Sumerians had used to mean \"celestial body.\""},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"82 THE LOST REALMS The association of the Mesoamerican calendar with t he Old World will become additionally evident as we look a t the most sacred number, 52. to which all the great Mesoameri can events were geared. The many attempts to explain it (like the state- ment that it is 13 times 4) ignore its most obvious source: the 52 weeks of the Near Eastern calendar (and thereafter the Euro- pean one). This number of weeks, however, is arrive d at only if a week of 7 days is adopted. This was not always th e case The origin of the 7-day week has been a subject of stud y for almost two centuries and the best theory is that it derive d from the four phases of the Moon. What is certain is that it emer ged as a divinely decreed time period in biblical times, whe n God com- manded the Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt to observe the seventh day as the Sabbath. Was then 52 the most sacred cycle because it happen ed to be the common denominator of the Mesoamerican calendar s—or was the sacred cycle of 260 adopted because it (rat her than, say, 300) was a multiple of 52 (52 x 5 = 260)? Although a deity whose epithet was \"Seven\" was a pr incipal Sumerian god, he was honored with theophonic place (e.g., Beer-Sheba, The Well of Seven) or personal names (El isheva, My God is Seven) principally in the land of Canaan. The number 7 as a revered number appears in the tales o f the He- brew patriarchs only after Abraham went to Egypt an d stayed at the pharaoh's court. The number 7 permeates the bib lical tale of Joseph, the pharaoh's dream and the ensuing events in Egypt. And, to the extent that 52 stemmed from the conside ration of 7 as a basic calendrical unit, we will show that this most sacred cycle of Mesoamerica was of Egyptian origin. More specifically: 52 was a magical number that was asso- ciated with the Egyptian god Thoth, the god of scie nce, writing, mathematics, and the calendar. An ancient Egyptian tale known as \"The Adventures o f Satni-Khamois with the Mummies\"—a tale of magic, my stery, and adventure that can match any modern thriller—em ploys the association of the magical number 52 with Thoth and with the secrets of the calendar for the key scene in th e plot. It was written on a papyrus (Cairo 30646) that was discover ed in a tomb in Thebes dating to the third century B.C. Fragm ents of other papyri with the same tale have also been foun d, indicating that it was an established book in ancient Egyptian literature, belonging to the cycle of tales of gods and men.

The tomb was that of Nenoferkheptah, son of a forme r pha- raoh (who, scholars believe, had reigned circa 1250 B.C.). When Satni, as expected, became very interested and aske d for the location of the tomb, the old man warned him that a lthough mummified, Nenoferkheptah was not dead and could st rike down anyone who dared take away the book that was l odged at his feet. Undaunted, Satni went in search of the to mb. It could not be found for it was below the ground. But having reached the right spot Satni \"recited a formula over it and a gap opened in the ground and Satni went down to the place wher e the book was.\" Inside the tomb Satni saw the mummies of Nenoferkhe ptah. of his sister-wife, and of their son. The book that was indeed at Nenoferkheptah's feet \"gave off a light as if the s un shone there.\" As Satni stepped toward it, the wife's mumm y spoke up, warning him to advance no farther. She told Satni o f the adven- tures of Nenoferkheptah when he had attempted to ob tain the book, for Thoth had hidden it in a secret place, in side a golden box that was inside a silver box that was inside a series of other boxes, the last and outer ones being of bronze and iron. Ignor- ing all warnings and overcoming all obstacles, Neno ferkheptah found and obtained the book; whereupon they were co ndemned by Thoth to suspended animation: though alive, they were bur- ied, and though mummified they could see, hear, and speak. She warned Satni that Thoth's curse would be upon h im if he touched the book. But having gone so far Satni was determined to get t he book.

And he would lose it even if he tried to find out the secrets by opening up the protective layers of Earth's minerals and metals. It is our belief that it was the same Thoth, alias Quetzalcoatl, who had bestowed the Calendar of Fifty-Two, and all other knowledge, upon the peoples of Mesoamerica.

At first temples were lofted atop step pyramids to worship the Serpent God, and the skies were observed to watch for the key celestial cycles . But there came a time when the god—or all the celestial gods— had left. Seen no more, they were presumed to have been swall owed by the ruler of the night, the jaguar; and the image o f the great god was henceforth covered by the jaguar's mask (Fig. 3 7) through which the serpents, his erstwhile symbol, still eme rge.

D . 987, disgusted by the religious abominations and seeking a place where they could worship as in the olden days, they went to Yucatan. Surely they could have found a new home closer by, a less arduous journey, a passage t hrough less hostile tribes. Yet they chose to trek almost a tho usand miles, to a land different in all respects—flat, riverless, t ropical—from their own. They did not stop until they had reached Chichen Itza. Why? What was the imperative in reaching the sacred city that the Maya had already abandoned? We can only se arch the ruins for an answer. Easily reached from Merida, Yucatan's administrativ e capi- tal, Chichen Itza has been compared to Pompeii in It aly, where after removal of the volcanic ash under which it ha d been bur- ied, a Roman city with its streets and houses and mu rals, graffiti and all, has been brought to light. Here it was the jungle canopy that had to be removed, rewarding the visitor with a double treat: a visit to an \"Old Empire\" Maya city, and to a mirror- image of Tollan as its emigrants had last seen it; for when the Toltecs arrived, they rebuilt and built over Chichen Itza in the image of their erstwhile capital. Archaeologists believe that the site was an importa nt settle- ment even in the first millennium B.C. The Chronicles of Chilam Balam attest that by A . D . 450 it was the principal sacred city of Yucatan. It was then called Chichin, \"The Well's Mo uth,\" for its most sacred features was a cenote or sacred wel l to which pilgrims came from near and far. Most of the visibl e remains from that era of Maya dominion are located in the s outhern or \"Old Chichen\" part of the site. It is there that the edifices de- scribed and drawn by Stephens and Catherwood are mos tly lo- cated, bearing such romantic names as Akab-Dzib (\"P lace of 86"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"Figure 38 Occult Writing\"), the Nunnery, Temple of the Thresh olds, and so on. Last to occupy (or rather, reoccupy) Chichen Itza be fore the arrival of the Toltecs were the Itzas, a tribe that some believe were kinsmen of the Toltecs and others see as migra nts from the south. It is they who gave the place its current na me, meaning \"The Well Mouth of the Itzas.\" They built their own ceremonial center north of the Maya ruins; the site's most ren owned edi- fices, the great central pyramid (\"El Castillo\") and the observa- tory (the Caracol) were built by them—only to be tak en over and built over by the Toltecs when they re-created Tollan at Chichen Itza. A chance discovery of an entranceway enables today' s visitor to enter the space between the Itza pyramid and the Toltec pyr- amid that envelops it, and to climb up the earlier stairway to the Itza sanctum, where the Toltecs had installed an im age of Chac- mool and of a jaguar. From the outside one can only see the Toltec structure—a pyramid that rises in nine stage s (Fig. 38) to a height of some 185 feet.

The severe end suggests that there was more than pl ay and entertainment to this ball game. At Chichen Itza, as at Tula, there were several ball courts, perhaps for trainin g or lesser matches. The main ball court was unique in its size and splen- dor, and the importance of what took place in it wa s under- scored by the fact that it was provided with three temples that were richly decorated with scenes of warriors, myth ological en- counters, the Tree of Life, and a winged and bearde d deity with two horns (Fig. 40). Figure 40 All this, and the diversity and regalia of the ball players, suggest to us an intertribal, if not international, aspect of an event of great political-religious significance. Th e number of players (seven), the decapitation of the losers' le ader, and the use of a rubber ball seem to mimic a mythological t ale in the Popol Vuh of a combat between the gods conducted as a contest with a rubber ball. It pitched the gods Seven-Macaw and his two sons against various Sky Gods, including the Sun. M oon, and Venus. The defeated son Seven-Huanaphu was executed : \"His head was cut off from his body and rolled away, his heart was cut out from his chest.\" But being a god, he was res urrected and became a planet. Such a reenactment of godly events would have made the Toltec custom akin to religious plays in the ancien t Near East. In Egypt, the dismemberment and resurrection of Osi ris was reenacted annually in a mystery play in which actor s, including the pharaoh, played the roles of various gods; and in Assyria, a complex play, also performed annually, reenacted a battle be- tween two gods in which the loser was executed, onl y to be pardoned and resurrected by the God of Heaven. In Ba bylon, Enuma elish, the epic describing the creation of th e solar sys- tem, was read annually as part of the New Year cele brations; it depicted the celestial collision that led to the cr eation of Earth (the Seventh Planet) as the cleaving and decapitati ng of the monstrous Tiamat by the supreme Babylonian god Marou k."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"Figure 41 The Maya myth and its reenactment, in echoing Near East- ern \"myths\" and their reenactments, appear to have retained the celestial elements of the tale and the symbolis m of the number seven as it relates to the planet Earth.

That this was a celestial symbol and not just a chance emblem is confirmed, in our opinion, by the fact that elsewhere in Chichen I tza a four- pointed star was repeatedly depicted in combination with the \"eight\" symbol for the planet Venus (Fig. 42a) and that at other sites in northwestern Yucatan temple walls were dec orated with symbols of six-pointed stars (Fig. 42b). The depiction of planets as pointed stars is so com mon that we tend to forget how this custom had arisen: As so much else, it began in Sumer. Based on what they had learned fr om the Nefilim, the Sumerians counted the planets not as w e do, from the Sun outward, but from the outside in. Thus, Plu to was the first planet, Neptune the second, Uranus the third, Saturn the fourth, Jupiter the fifth. Mars accordingly was the sixth, Earth the seventh, and Venus the eighth. The usual explan ation by scholars why the Maya/Toltecs considered Venus the eighth is that it takes eight Earth years (8 x 365 = 2,920 da ys) to repeat a synodic alignment with Venus after five orbits of Venus (5 x 584 = 2,920 days). But if so, Venus should have been \"Five\" and Earth \"Eight.\" 90 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"Strangers from across the Seas 91 We find the Sumerian method much more elegant and a ccu- rate, and suggest that the Maya/Toltec depictions f ollowed the Near Eastern iconography; for, as one can see, the symbols found at Chichen Itza and elsewhere in Yucatan are a lmost identical to those by which the various planets had been de- picted in Mesopotamia (Fig. 42c). Indeed, the employment of pointed-star symbols in t he Near Eastern manner becomes more prevalent the more one moves toward the northwestern corner of Yucatan and its c oast. A most remarkable sculpture has been found there, at a site called Tzekelna; it is now on exhibit at the Merida museum . Carved out of a large stone block to which the statue's ba ck is still at- tached, it depicts a man of strong facial features, possibly wear- ing a helmet.

An engimatic circular device is held by belts to his belly; scholars believe that it somehow identified its bearers as Water Gods. Large sculptures of deities forming part of massive stone blocks were discovered at a nearby site called Oxki ntok; they are presumed by archaeologists to have served as st ructural sup- porting columns in temples. One of them (Fig. 44) l ooks like a female counterpart of the above-described male one.

The island had served as a hallowed necropolis because according to legends it was the final resti ng place of Itzamna, the god of the Itzas—a great olden god who had waded there ashore from the sea, and whose name mea nt \"He Whose Home Is Water.\" Texts, legends, and religious beliefs have thus com bined to point to the gulf shore of Yucatan as the place whe re a divine or deified being had come ashore, to begin settlement and civiliza- zation in these lands. This powerful combination, t hese collec- tive recollections, must have been the reason for t he Toltec trek to this corner of Yucatan, and specifically to Chich en Itza, when they migrated in search of the revival and purity o f their original beliefs; a return to the spot where it all began, a nd where the Returning God would land again, coming from across t he sea. The focal point of the worship of Itzamna and Quetz alcoatl, and perhaps also of the memories of Votan, was the Sacred Cenote of Chichen Itza—a huge well that gave Chichen I tza its name. Situated directly north of the main pyramid and con nected to the ceremonial plaza by a long paved processional a venue, the well is nowadays about seventy feet deep from the s urface to the water level, with another one hundred feet or so of water and silt farther down. The well mouth, oval in shape, m easures about 250 feet in length and about 170 feet in widt h. There is evidence that the well had been artificially enlarg ed and that a stairway had once led down.

In an area of marshy coasts where stone is rare, they created and left behind stone monuments that amaze to this very day; of these, the most baffling are the ones that portray the Olmecs themselves. Unique in all respects are giant stone heads sculpt ed with incredible skill and unknown tools to portray Olmec leaders. The first to see such a gigantic head was J. M. Mel gar y Serrano at Tres Zapotes in the state of Veracruz. He descri bed it in the Bulletin of the Mexican Geographical and Statistical Society (in 1869) as \"a work of art... a magnificent sculpture that most amazingly represents an Ethiopian.\" Accompanying dr awings faithfully reproduced the head's negroid features ( Fig. 52). 98 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"Strangers from across the Seas 99 Figure 51 It was not until 1925 that the existence of such co lossal stone heads was confirmed by Western scholars, when an ar chaeologi- cal team from Tulane University headed by Frans Blom found \"the upper part of a colossal head which has sunk d eep into the ground\" at La Venta, a site near the gulf coast in the state of Tabasco. When the head was fully unearthed (Fig. 53 ) it mea- sured about eight feet in height, twenty-one in cir cumference, and weighed about twenty-four tons. It depicts with out question a negroid African wearing a distinct helmet.

Five similar colossal heads were found in the 1940s at San Lorenzo, an Olmec site some sixty miles southwest o f La Venta, by archaeological expeditions headed by Matthew Sti rling and Philip Drucker. Yale University teams that followed , led by Mi- chael D. Coe, discovered more heads. They took radi ocarbon readings that gave dates circa 1200 B.C. This means that organic matter (mostly charcoal) found at the site is that old; but the site itself and its monuments could well be older. Indee d, the Mexi- can archaeologist Ignacio Bernal, who found another head at Tres Zapotes, dates these colossal sculptures to 15 00 B.C. By now sixteen such colossal heads have been found. They range in height from about five to ten feet and wei gh as much as twenty-five tons. Whoever sculpted them was about t o sculpt more, for a great deal of \"raw material\"—large ston es that had been quarried and rounded to a ball-like shape—has been found in addition to the finished heads. The basalt stones, fin- ished and unfinished, had been hauled from their so urce to the stoneless sites over distances of sixty miles or mo re, through jungle and swamps. How such colossal stone blocks w ere quar- ried, transported, and finally sculpted and erected at their desti- nation remains a mystery. Clearly, however, the Olm ecs deemed it very important to commemorate their leaders in t his manner. That these were individuals, all of the same Africa n negroid stock but with their own personalities and diverse headgear, can be readily seen from a portrait gallery of some of these heads (Fig. 54). 100 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"Strangers from across the Seas 101 Figure 54 Encounter scenes carved on stone stelae (Fig. 55a) and other monuments (Fig. 55b) clearly depict the Olmecs as t all, heavily built with muscular bodies—\"giants\" in stature, no doubt, in the eyes of the indigenous Indian population.

The sites at which the colossal heads and other Olm ec depic- tions have been found are no less intriguing; their size, magni- tude, and structures reveal the work of organized s ettlers, not just of a few shipwrecked visitors. La Venta was ac tually a small island in the swampy coastal area that has been art ificially shaped, landfilled and built up according to a prec onceived plan. Major edifices, including an unusual conical \"pyramid,\" elongated and circular mounds, structures, paved co urts, altars, stelae, and other man-made features have been laid out with great geometric precision along a north-south axis extending for about three miles. In a place devoid of stones, an amazing variety of stones—each chosen for it special qualit y—was used in the structures, monuments, and stelae, although all of them required hauling over great distances. The conical pyramid 102 THE LOST REALMS Figure 57"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"Strangers from across the Seas 103 alone necessitated the bringing and piling up of a million cubic feet of soil. It all called for a tremendous physic al effort. It also required a high level of architectural and stonewor king exper- tise for which there had been no precedent in Mesoa merica; the art was obviously acquired elsewhere. The extraordinary finds at La Venta included a rect angular enclosure that was surrounded or fenced off by colu mns of ba- salt stone (the same material of which the colossal heads were sculpted). The enclosure protected a stone sarcopha gus and a rectangular burial chamber that was also roofed and walled with basalt columns. Inside, several skeletons lay on a low platform. All in all, this unique find, with its stone sarcop hagus, appears to have been the model for the equally unusual cryp t of Pacal in Palenque. At any rate, the insistence on the employ ment of great blocks of stone, even if it had to be brought from afar, for monuments, commemorative sculptures, and burials mu st serve as a clue to the enigmatic origin of the Olmecs. No less puzzling was the discovery at La Venta of h undreds of artistically carved objects of the rare jade, in cluding unusual axes made of this semiprecious stone that is not lo cally avail- able. Then, to add to the mystery, they were all de liberately buried in long, deep trenches. The trenches, in tur n, were filled with layers of clay, each layer of a different kind and color of clay—thousands of tons of soil brought over from di verse dis- tant places. Incredibly, the trenches were paved at the very bot- tom with thousands of tiles of serpentine, another green-blue semiprecious stone. It has been generally assumed t hat the trenches were dug to bury in them the precious jade objects; but the floors of serpentine could also suggest that th e trenches were constructed earlier, for another purpose altog ether; but were used to bury highly valued objects, such as ra re axes, once the need for them (and for the trenches) ceased. Th ere is indeed no doubt that the Olmec sites were abandoned by the m around the beginning of the Christian era and that the Olme cs even attempted to bury some of the colossal heads. Whoev er gained access to their sites afterward, did so with a veng eance: some of the heads were clearly toppled off their bases and rolled down- hill into the swamps; others bear marks of attempte d mutila- tion. As another enigma from La Venta, let us note the di scovery in the trenches of concave mirrors of crystallized iron ores (magnetite and hematite), shaped and polished to pe rfection.

The final enigma at La Venta is the site itself, fo r it is pre- cisely oriented on a north-south axis that is tilte d 8 degrees west of true north. Various studies have shown that this was an intentional orientation, intended to permit astonom ical sight- ings, perhaps from atop the conical \"pyramid\" whose prominent ridges may have served as directional indicators. A special study by M. Popenoe-Hatch. (Papers on Olmec and Maya Arch aeol- ogy No. 13, University of California) concluded that \"the pat- tern of observation being made at La Venta at 1000 B.C. indicates that it must date back to a body of knowl edge learned a millennium earlier... The La Venta site and its a rt of 1000 B.C. seem to reflect a tradition based in large part on the merid- ian transits of stars occuring on the solstices and equinoxes around 2000 B.C.\" A beginning at 2000 B.C. would make La Venta the earl iest \"sacred center\" in Mesoamerica, preceding Teotihuac an except for the legendary time when gods alone were there. It still may not be the true time of the Olmecs' arrival from ac ross the seas, for their Long Count begins at 3113 B.C.; but it does clearly indicate how far ahead of the renowned civilization s of the Maya and the Aztecs the Olmecs had been. At Tres Zapotes, whose early phase is attributed by archaeologists to the three centuries 1500-1200 B.C., stone con- structions (although stone is rare there), terraces , stairways, and mounds that might have been pyramids are scattered about the site. At least another eight sites have been locate d within a radius of fifteen miles of Tres Zapotes, indicating it was a great center surrounded by satellites. Besides the heads a nd other sculpted monuments, a number of stelae were unearth ed there; one (\"Stela C\") bears the Long Count date 7.16.6.16.1 8, which is equivalent to 31 B.C., attesting to the Olmec pre sence at the site at such time. At San Lorenzo the Olmec remains consisted of struc tures, mounds, and embankments, interspersed with artifici al ponds. The central part of the site was built upon a man-m ade platform of about one square mile that was raised some 185 f eet above the surrounding terrain—an earthworks project that dwarfs many modern enterprises. The archaeologists discove red that the ponds were interconnected by a system of subter ranean conduits \"whose meanings or function is not yet und erstood.\" The description of Olmec sites can go on and on—by now, some forty have been uncovered. Everywhere, besides monu-"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"mental art and edifices of stone, there are mounds by the dozens and other evidence of deliberate, planned ea rthworks. The stoneworks, earthworks, trenches, ponds, condui ts, mir- rors must, however, have some meaningful purpose ev en if modern scholars cannot fathom it. So, clearly, must the very presence of the Olmecs in Mesoamerica—unless one su bscribes to the shipwrecked-survivors theory, which we do no t. Aztec historians described the people they nicknamed Olme ca as rem- nants of an ancient non-Nahuatl-speaking people—not a few individuals—who had created the oldest civilization in Mexico. The archaeological evidence supports that and shows that from a base or \"metropolitan area\" abutting the Gulf of Mexico, where La Venta, Tres Zapotes, and San Lorenzo forme d the pivotal triangle, the area of Olmec settlement and influence cut southward toward the Pacific coast of Mexico and Gu atemala. Experts in earthworks, masters of stoneworking, dig gers of trenches, channelers of water, users of mirrors—wha t, thus en- dowed, were the Olmecs doing in Mesoamerica? Stelae show them emerging from \"altars\" that represent entrance s into the depths of the earth (Fig. 58), or inside caves hold ing a puzzling array of tools, as on this stela from La Venta (Fig . 59) in which it is possible to discern the enigmatic mirrors bei ng attached to the toolholder's helmets. All in all, the capabilities, the scenes, the tools appear to us to lead to one conclusion: the Olmecs were miners, come to the New World to extract some precious metals—probably gold, perhaps other rare minerals too. The legends of Votan, which speak of tunneling thro ugh mountains, support this conclusion. So does the fac t that among the Olden Gods whose worship was adopted from the O lmecs by the Nahautl people were the god Tepeyolloti, mea ning \"Heart of the Mountain.\" He was a bearded God of Cav es; his temple had to be of stone, preferably built inside a mountain.

It clearly depicts a person inside a confined area, using the flamethrower against the wall in front of him (Fig. 60b). The \"d iamond\" sym- bol on the wall probably signifies a mineral, but i ts meaning has not yet been deciphered. As so many depictions attest, the puzzle of the Afr ican \"Olmecs\" is entwined with the enigma of the Bearded Ones from the eastern Mediteranean. They were depicted o n monu- ments throughout the Olmec sites, in individual por traits or in encounter scenes. Significantly, some encounters ar e shown to have taken place inside caverns; one, from Tres Zap otes (Fig. 61), even includes an attendant carrying a lighting device (at a time when, supposedly, only torches were used).

Scholars have wondered why there is, at many Olmec sites, evidence of deliberate destruction—the defacing of monuments (including colossal heads), the smashing of artifac ts, the top- pling of monuments—all with a vehemence and a venge ance. The destruction does not appear to have taken place all at once; Olmec sites seem to have been abandoned gradually, first in the older 'metropolitan center\" near the Gulf, circa 30 0 B.C., then later on at more southern sites. We have seen the e vidence of the date equivalent to 31 B.C. at Tres Zapotes; it s uggests that the process of the abandonment of Olmec centers, fo llowed by revengeful destruction, may have lasted several cen turies, as the Olmecs gave up sites and retreated southward. 108 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"Strangers from across the Seas 109 The depictions from that turbulent period and from that southern zone of Olmec domains show them more and m ore as warriors, wearing frightening masks of eagles or ja guars.

The coastal peoples could recall traditions of gods who had guided their forebears to the promised lands and of giants who despoiled their crops and raped their women. The hi ghland peo- ples, of whom the Incas were the dominant at the ti me of the Spanish conquest, acknowledged divine guidance in a ll manner of activity and craft, the raising of crops, the bu ilding of cities. They recounted Tales of Beginning—tales of creation, of days of upheaval, of an engulfing deluge. And they attri buted the beginning of their kingship and the establishment o f their capi- tal to the magic of a golden wand. Spanish chroniclers, as well as native ones who had learned Spanish, had established that the father of the two Inca kings at the time of the conquest, Huayna Capac, was the twel fth Inca (a title meaning lord, sovereign) of a dynasty that be gan in Cuzco, the capital, circa AD . 1020.

The coastal areas that lie between the western rang e of the Andes and the Pacific Ocean are climatically rainle ss areas. Habitation and civilization was able to flourish th ere because the waters flowing off the high mountains into the ocean do so in the form of rivers large and small that transect the coastal plains every fifty to one hundred miles or so. Thes e rivers create fertile and verdant areas that separate one desertl ike stretch from the other. Settlements therefore arose on the banks and at the mouths of these rivers; and the archaeological evidence shows that the Chimus augmented these water sources with sup- plies brought from the mountains via aqueducts. The y also con- nected the successive fertile and settled areas by a road that on the average was fifteen feet wide—the precursor of the famed Highway of the Sun of the Incas. At the edge of the built-up area, where the verdant valley ends and the arid desert begins, great pyramids ris e from the desert floor, facing each other across the Moche ri ver. They were built of sun-dried mud bricks, reminding explo rers such as V. W. von Hagen (Highway of the Sun and other books ) of the high-rise temple towers (ziggurats) of Mesopotamia, which were also built of mud bricks and, like the ones on the banks of the Moche river, of a slightly convex shape. The four centuries of Chimu flourishing, from about AD . 1000 to A . D . 1400, was also a time when goldsmithing was mas- tered to an extent never attained by the subsequent Incas. Spanish conquistadores described the golden riches of what were in fact Chimu centers (even under Inca rule) in superla- tives; the golden enclosure of a town called Tumbes , where plants and animals were mimicked in gold, appears t o have been the model after which the Incas fashioned the golde n enclosure of the principal shrine in Cuzco. The environs of a nother city, Tucume, have yielded the greater part of the gold o bjects that have been found in Peru in the centuries following the conquest (objects buried in tombs with the dead). Indeed, th e amount of gold the Chimus possessed astounded the Incas when t hey over- ran the coast lands. Those legendary quantities, an d the actual finds thereafter, still puzzle scholars; for the go ld sources of Peru are not in the arid coastlands, but in the hig hlands. The Chimu culture-state was in turn the successor to pre- vious cultures or organized societies. As in the ca se of Chimu, no one knows what those peoples called themselves; the names that are nowadays applied to them are actually the names of archaeological sites or rivers at which these socie ties and their"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"114 THE LOST REALMS recognizable cultures were centered. On the north-c entral coastal area, the one called Mochica rolls back the fog of history to about 400 B.C. They are known for their artful po ttery and graceful textiles; but how and when these arts were acquired remains a mystery. The decorations on their ceramic vessels are replete with illustrations of winged gods and menac ing giants, and suggest a religion with a pantheon headed by th e Moon God whose symbol was the Crescent and name was Si or Si-An. The Mochica artifacts clearly show that, centuries before the Chimu. they had mastered the art of casting gold, of building with mud bricks, and of laying out temple compounds replete with ziggurats. At a site called Pacatnamu, a burie d sacred city with no less than thirty-one pyramids was excavated in the 1930s by a German archaeological team (H. Ubbelohde-Doeri ng, Auf den Koenigsstrassen der Inka). They determined that the many smaller pyramids were about a thousand years older than the several much larger pyramids that had sides of two hundred feet and were some forty feet high. The southern border of the Chimu empire was the rive r Rimac, from which name the Spaniards corrupted Lima as the name of their capital. Beyond this boundary the coas tal zones were inhabited, in pre-Inca times, by Chincha tribes men; the highlands were occupied by Aymara-speaking peoples. It is now known that the Incas had obtained their notions of a pantheon from the former, and the tales of Creation and Beginn ing from the latter. The Rimac region was a focal point in antiquity as i t is now- adays. It was there, just south of Lima, that the l argest temple to a Peruvian deity had stood. Its ruins from the t ime it was rebuilt and enlarged by the Incas can still be seen . It was dedi- cated to Pacha-Camac, meaning \"Creator of the World,\" a god who headed a pantheon that included the divine coup les Vis and Mama-Pacha (\"Lord Earth\" and \"Lady Earth\") and Ni a nd Mama-Cocha (\"Lord Water\" and \"Lady Water\"), the Moon God Si, the Sun God Illa-Ra, and the Hero God Kon or Con who was also known as Ira-Ya—names that evoke a hos t of Near Eastern divine epithets. The temple of Pachacamac was a \"Mecca\" for the anci ent people of the southern coasts. Pilgrims came to it from far and near. The act of pilgrimage was so esteemed that ev en when tribes were at war, enemy pilgrims were granted saf e passage.

But the whole temple precinct was so revere d that pil- grims had to take off their sandals to enter it—jus t as Moses was commanded to do in the Sinai and as Moslems sti ll do as they enter a mosque. The gold that had accumulated at the temple was too fabu- lous to escape the attention of the conquering Span iards. Fran- cisco Pizarro sent his brother Hernandez to loot it . He found some gold, silver, and precious stones, but not the main riches, for the priests had hidden the treasures. No amount of threat or torture could make the priests reveal the hiding pl ace (which is still rumored to be somewhere between Lima and Luri n). Her- nandez then smashed the god's golden statue for its metal and pulled out of the walls the silver nails that had h eld the gold and silver plates that had lined the temple's walls. Th e nails alone weighed 32,000 ounces! Local legends attribute the establishment of this t emple to the \"giants.\" What is known for certain is that the Incas, adopt- ing the veneration of Pachacamac from the tribes th ey had overrun, enlarged and embellished the temple. Stand ing on a mountainside, the Pacific Ocean breaking almost at its feet, the temple rose atop four platforms that supported a te rrace five hundred feet above ground level; the four platforms were cre- ated by the erection of retaining walls built of im mense stone blocks. The topmost terrace extended over several a cres. The final structures of the temple complex, aided by su nken plazas, afforded an unimpended view from the main sanctuary toward the vast ocean. Not only the living came to pray and to worship her e. The dead too were brought to the Rimac valley and the co astal plains to its south, to spend their afterlife in th e shadow of the oracle gods; perhaps even for an eventual resurrect ion, for there was a belief that Rimac could resurrect the de ad.

They do agree that the nearby mountain ranges were dedi- cated exclusively to Rimac. His name meant \"The Thu nderer,\" and thus in meaning and phonetically is akin to the nickname Raman by which Adad was known to the Semitic people s—an epithet stemming from the verb meaning \"to thunder. \" According to the chronicler Garcilaso, it was in th ese moun- tains that \"an idol, in the shape of a man,\" had st ood in a shrine dedicated to Rimac.

From these and other chronicles it is evident that various versions were memorized by the Andean peoples. They recalled a creative Beginning at Lake Titicaca, and the star t of kingship at a place of a sacred cave and a royal window; and as the Incas had it, the events were concurrent and formed the b asis of their dynasty. Other versions, however, separated the eve nts and the periods. One of the versions regarding the Beginning was that the great god. Creator of All, Viracocha, arranged for f our brothers and four sisters to roam the land and bring civiliz ation to its primitive peoples; and one of these brother-sister/ husband-wife couples began kingship in Cuzco. The other version w as that the Great God, at his base in Lake Titicaca, created th is first royal couple as his children and gave them an object made of gold. He told them to go north and build a city where the golden object would sink into the earth; the place where t he miracle had happened was Cuzco. And that is why the Inca kin gs—pro- viding they had been born of a succession of brothe r-sister royal couples—could claim direct descent of the Sun God. Recollections of the Deluge featured in almost all v ersions of Beginning. According to Father Molina (Relation de la s fabulas y ritos de los Yngas) it was already \"in the time o f Manco Capac, who was the first Ynca and from whom they beg an to be called Children of the Sun ... that they had a full account of the Deluge. They say that all people and all created th ings perished in it, the waters having risen above all the highes t mountains in the world. No living thing survived except a man an d a woman who remained in a box; and when the waters subsided , the wind carried them to Huanaco, which will be over seventy leagues from Cuzco, a little more or less. The Creator of All Things commanded them to remain there as Mitimas, and ther e in Tia- huanaco the Creator began to raise up the people and nations"},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Realm of the Golden Wand 119 that are in that region.\" The repopulation of the E arth began by the Creator first fashioning out of clay the image o f one person of each nation; \"then he gave life and a soul to ea ch one. men as well as women, and directed them to their designate d places on Earth.\" Those who failed to obey the commandments r egarding worship and behavior were turned into stones. The Creator also had with him on the island of Titic aca the Moon and the Sun. whence they had come on his order s. When all that was needed to replenish the Earth was done , the Moon and the Sun rose up to heaven. The two divine assistants of the Creator of All are presented in another version as his two sons. \"Having created the tribes and nations, and assigned dresses and languages to them.\" Fa- ther Molina wrote, \"the Creator ordered his two sons to go in different directions and introduce civilization.\" T he old son. Ymaymana Viracocha (meaning \"in whose power all thi ngs are placed\"), went to give civilization to the mountain peoples; the younger son, Topaco Viracocha (\"maker of things\"), was or- dered to go by way of the coastal plains. When the two brothers completed their work they met at the seashore, \"whe nce they ascended to heaven.\" Garcilaso de la Vega, who was born in Cuzco to a Spa nish father and an Inca mother soon after the conquest, recorded two legends. According to one the Great God came do wn from the heavens to Earth to instruct mankind, giving it laws and precepts. He \"placed his two children at lake Titic aca,\" gave them a \"wedge of gold,\" and instructed them to sett le where it would sink into the ground, which was at Cuzco. The other legend related that \"after the waters of the deluge had subsided, a certain man appeared in the country of Tiahuanacu , which is to the south of Cuzco. This man was so powerful that he divided the world into four parts, and gave them to four me n whom he honored with the title of king.\" One of them, whose epithet- name was Manco Capac (\"king and lord\" in the Quechua lan- guage of the Incas), began kingship in Cuzco. The various versions speak of two phases of creatio n by Vi- racocha. Juan de Betanzos (Suma y Narration de los I ncas) re- corded a Quechua tale wherein the Creator god, \"on t he first occasion, made the heavens and the earth\"; he also created peo- ple—Mankind. But \"this people did some sort of wrong to Vir- acocha, and he was angered by it... and those first people and their chief he converted into stones in punishment. \" Then, after a period of darkness, he made at Tiahuanacu new men and women, out of stones. He gave them tasks and abilit ies and told them where to go. Remaining with only two aides, he sent one"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"120 THE LOST REALMS southward and one northward, while he himself went in the direction of Cuzco. There he caused a chief to come forth; and having thus established kingship at Cuzco, Viracocha continued tan journey \"as far as the coast of Ecuador, where his two com- panions joined him. There they all began to walk to gether on the waters of the sea, and disappeared.\" Some of the tales of the highland peoples focused o n how there had come to be a settlement at Cuzco, and how Cuzco had been divinely ordained to become the capital. Accor ding to one version what Manco Capac was given (in order to find the site for the city) was a staff or wand made of pure gold ; it was called Tupac-yauri, meaning \"splenderous scepter.\" He went in search of the designated place in the company of brothers and sisters. Reaching a certain stone, his companions were struck with a feebleness. When Manco Capac struck the stone with t he magi- cal staff, it spoke up and told him of his selectio n as ruler of a kingdom. A descendent of an Indian chief who had co nverted to Christianity after the Spaniards had landed claimed in his mem- oirs that the Indians were showing that sacred rock to this very day. \"The Ynca Manco Capac married one of his own si sters, named Mama Ocllo... and they began to enact good la ws for the government of their people.\" This tale, sometimes called the legend of the four Ayar brothers, relates as all other versions of the foun ding of Cuzco do, that the magical object whereby the monarch and the capital were designated was made of solid gold. It is a clu e that we consider vital and central to the unraveling of the enigmas of all American civilizations. When the Spaniards entered Cuzco, the Inca capital, they found a metropolis with some 100,000 dwelling house s, sur- rounding a royal-religious center of magnificent te mples, pal- aces, gardens, plazas, and marketplaces. Situated b etween two streams (the Tullumayo and the Rodadero) at an eleva tion of some 11,500 feet, Cuzco begins at the foot of the pr omontory of Sacsahuaman. The city was divided into twelve wards —a number that puzzled the Spaniards—arranged in an ov al. The first and oldest ward, appropriately called the Kne eling Terrace, was located on the promontory's slope in the northw est. There the first Incas (and presumably also the legendary Manco Capac) had built their palaces. All the wards bore p icturesque names (the Speaking Place, Terrace of Flowers, Sacr ed Gate, and the like) that in reality described their princ ipal feature. One of this century's leading scholars on the subje ct of Cuzco, Stansbury Hagar (Cuzco, the Celestial City) str essed the"},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Realm of the Golden Wand 121 belief that Cuzco was established and laid out in ac cordance with a plan drawn for Manco Capac at the prehistoric sacred place where the migration of the Founders had begu n, at Tia- huanacu on Lake Titicaca. In its name. \"Navel of th e Earth.\" and in its division to four parts simulating the fo ur corners of the Earth, he (and others too) saw an expression of ter restrial con- cepts. In other features of the city's plan, howeve r, he saw aspects of celestial knowledge (hence the title of his book). The streams that flanked the city's center were made to flow through artificial channels that emulated the serpentine Mi lky Way: and the twelve wards emulated the division of the heave ns into twelve houses of the zodiac. Significantly for our own studies of events on Earth and their timing. Hagar concluded t hat the first and earliest ward represented Aries. Squier and other nineteenth-century explorers descr ibed a Cuzco that was partly all-Hispanic and partly built over the re- mains of the earlier Inca City. So, for a descriptio n of Cuzco as the conquering Spaniards had found it, and for a gl impse as it had been in even earlier times, one must read the w ords of the early chroniclers. Pedro de Cieza de Leon (Chronicles of Peru in the English translation) described the Inca capi tal, its edifices and squares and bridges in most glowing words, \"a n obly adorned city\" from whose center four royal roads le d to the farthest parts of the empire, and ascribed its rich es not only to the custom of keeping intact the palaces of the dec eased kings, but also to the law that required gold and silver t o be brought into the city in homage and offerings but prohibite d to take any out on pain of death. \"Cuzco,\" he wrote in its prais e, \"was grand and stately, and must have been founded by a people of great intelligence. It had fine streets, except tha t they were nar- row, and the houses were built of solid stones, bea utifully joined. These stones were very large and well cut. The other parts of the houses were of wood and straw; there a re no re- mains of tiles, bricks, or lime amongst them.\" Garcilaso de la Vega (who bore his Spanish father's name but also the royal title \"Inca,\" for his mother was of the royal Inca dynasty) after describing the twelve wards, related that except for the palace of the first Inca in the First Ward, on the slope of Sacsahuaman, the other Inca palaces were clustered around the city's center near the great temple. Still extant i n his time were the palaces of the second, sixth, ninth, tenth, ele venth and twelfth Incas. Some of them flanked the main square of the capital, called Huacay-Pata. There the ruling Inca, seated on a grand dais, his family, court hierarchy, and priest s witnessed and conducted the festivals and religious ceremonies, f our of which "},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"122 THE LOST REALMS were connected with the winter and summer solstices and the spring and autumn equinoxes. As the early chroniclers attest, the most famous an d superb structure of pre-Hispanic Cuzco was the Cori-Cancha (\" Golden Enclosure\"), the city's and the empire's most impor tant temple. The Spaniards called it Temple of the Sun, having b elieved that the Sun was the supreme deity of the Incas. Those w ho had seen the temple before it was vandalized, demolished, an d built over by the Spaniards, reported that it was made up of s everal parts. The main temple was dedicated to Viracocha; adjoini ng or aux- iliary chapels were devoted to the Moon (Quilla), V enus (Cha- sca), a mysterious star called Coyllor, and to Illa- pa, the god of Thunder and Lightning. There was also a shrine devo ted to the Rainbow, it was there, at the Coricancha, that the Sp aniards had plundered the golden riches. Adjoining the Coricancha was the enclosure that was called Aclla-Huasi—\"The Chosen Women's House.\" Consisting of dwellings surrounding gardens and orchards as well as work- shops for spinning, weaving, and sewing the royal a nd priestly garments, it was a secluded enclave where virgins d edicated to the Great God lived; one of their tasks was to pres erve the Eternal Fire attributed to the god. The conquering Spaniards, having plundered the city 's riches, set out to appropriate to themselves the ci ty itself, divid- ing among themselves by drawing lots its various ed ifices. Most were dismantled for their masonry; here and there a gateway or part of a wall was incorporated into new Spanish bu ildings. Major shrines were used as sites for churches and m onasteries. The Dominicans, first on the scene, took over the T emple of the Sun, demolishing its outer structure but incorporat ing the an- cient layout and some wall portions into their chur ch-monastery. One of the most interesting sections thus used and therefore still intact is a semicircular outer wall of what used to be the enclo- sure of the Inca temple's High Altar (Fig. 67). It was there that the Spaniards found a great golden disk representin g (they as- sumed) the Sun; it fell by lot to the conquistador Leguizano, who gambled it away the following night. The winner had the venerated object melted and cast into ingots. After the Dominicans came the Franciscans, the Augu stines, the Mercedarios, the Jesuits; they all built their shrines, includ- ing Cuzco's great cathedral, where Inca shrines had stood. After the priests came the nuns; not surprisingly, their convent stands upon the Inca's convent of the House of the Chosen Women. Governors and Spanish dignitaries followed suit, bu ilding their edifices and homes upon and with parts of Inca ston e houses."},{"pageNumber":124,"pageContent":"Figure 67 Some believe that Cuzco, meaning \"Navel, Omphalus.\" was so named because it was the capital, a place chosen for a com- mand post. Another theory held by many is that the name means \"Place of Raised Stones.\" If so, the name suit s Cuzco's main attraction—its astounding megalithic stones. While most of Cuzco's Inca dwellings were built of u ndressed fieldstones held together with mortar, or stones ro ughly cut to simulate bricks or ashlars, some of the older edifi ces were built of perfectly cut, dressed, and shaped stones (\"ashl ars\") as those found in the remaining semicircular wall of the Cori cancha. The beauty and craftsmanship of this wall and some othe rs contem- porary with it have amazed and thrrlled countless t ravelers.

To compound the mystery , all these stones are tightly held together without mortar, wi thstanding not only human destructiveness but also the frequen t earth- quakes in the area. All are agreed by now that while the beautiful ashl ars repre- sent a \"classical\" Inca phase, the cyclopean walls belong to an earlier time. For want of clearer answers, scholars simply call it the Megalithic Age. It is a puzzle that still seeks a solution. It is a lso a mystery that only deepens as one ascends the promontory of Sacsahua- man. There, what is assumed to have been an Inca fo rtress thrusts an even greater enigma at the visitor. The promontory's name means Falcon's Place. Shaped like a triangle with its base to the northwest, its peak r ises some eight hundred feet above the city below. Its sides are fo rmed by gorges that separate it from the mountain chain to which it be- longs and which it rejoins at its base. The promontory can be divided into three parts. Its wide base is dominated by huge rock outcroppings that so meone cut and shaped into giant steps or platforms and perfor ated with tunnels, niches, and grooves. The promontory's midd le is taken up by a flattened-out area hundreds of feet wide an d long. And the narrower edge, elevated above the rest of the p romontory, contains evidence of circular and rectangular struc tures under which there run passages, tunnels, and other openin gs in a be- wildering maze cut into the natural rock. Separating or protecting this \"developed\" area from the rest of the promontory are three massive walls that run parallel to each other in a zigzag (Fig. 69). The three lines of zigzagging walls are constructed of massive stones and rise one behind the other, each one some what higher than the one in front of it, to a combined height o f about sixty feet. Earth-fills behind each wall have created ter races that, it is presumed, were meant to serve the. promontory's def enders as parapets. Of the three, especially the lowest (firs t) wall is built of colossal boulders, weighing between ten to twent y tons. In one instance a boulder twenty-seven feet high weigh s over 300 tons (Fig. 70). Many stones are fifteen feet high a nd are from ten to fourteen feet in width and thickness.

Everywhere the stones are of a polygonal shape, the odd sides and angles fitting without mortar into the odd and matching shapes of the adjoining stone blocks. The style and the period are clearly of the same cyclopean construction as t hat of the Megalithic Age remains in Cuzco, but here they are s ubstan- tially more massive. All over the flattened areas between the walls ther e are re- mains of structures that were built of the regularl y fashioned \"Inca style'\" stones.

How and by whom—and why? Chroniclers from Spanish conquest times, travelers i n recent centuries, and contemporary researchers all arrive at the same conclusion: not the Incas, but enigmatic predecesso rs with some supernatural powers.... But no one even has a theory Why. Garcilaso de la Vega wrote of these fortifications that one had no choice but to believe that they were \"erecte d by magic, by demons and not by men. because of the number and size of the stones placed in the three walls... which it is impossible to believe were cut out of quarries, since the Indians had neither iron nor steel wherewith to extract and shape them.

Nor were there level roa ds over which to transport them; on the contrary, steep mou ntains and abrupt declivities to overcome. \"Many of the stones,\" Garcilaso wrote, \"were brough t from ten to fifteen leagues, and especially the stone or rather the rock called Saycusa or the Tired Stone, because it never reached the structure, and which, it is known, was brought a di stance of fifteen leagues from beyond the river of Yucay... T he stones obtained the nearest were from Muyna, five leagues from Cuzco. It defies imagination to conceive how so many and so great stones could be so accurately fitted together as scarcely to admit the insertion of a point of a knife between t hem. Many are indeed so well fitted that the joint can hardly be discovered. And all this is the more wonderous as they had no s quares or levels to place on the stones and ascertain if they would fit together... Nor had they cranes or pulleys or other machinery whatever.\" He then went on to quote a number of Cath olic priests who had suggested that \"one cannot conceive how such stones were cut, carried and set in their places... unless by dia- bolic art.\" Squier, who said of the stones composing the three walls that they represented \"without doubt the grandest specim en of the style called Cyclopean extant in America.\" was enth ralled and puzzled by many other features of these stone colos si and of the other rock faces in the area. One such feature was the three gateways through the rows of walls, one of which wa s called the Gate of Viracocha. This gateway was a marvel of eng ineering sophistication: at about the center of the front wa ll the stone blocks were so placed as to form a rectangular area that led to an opening of about four feet in the wall. Steps th en led to a terrace between the first and second walls, from wh ich an intri- cate passage opened against a transverse wall at a right angle, leading to a second terrace. There, two entrances p laced at an angle to each other led to and through the third wa ll. All chroniclers related that this central gateway, like the other two at the walls' extremes, could be blocked by lowering large, specially fitted stone blocks into the openi ngs. These stone blockers and the mechanisms for their raising and lower- ing (to open and block the gateways) were removed a t some ancient time, but the channels and grooves for them can still be discerned.

Underground passages in a labyrinth- ine pattern begin and end abruptly. One leads to a cavern forty feet deep; others end in rock faces cut and dressed to resemble steps that do not seem to lead anywhere. Facing the cyclopean walls across the wide open fla t area are rock outcroppings that bear descriptive names: the Rodadero (\"Slide\") whose back side is used by children as a slide: the Piedra Lisa (\"Smooth Stone\"), which Squier had desc ribed to be \"grooved as if the rock had been squeezed up in a plastic state\"—like playing clay—\"then hardened into shape, with a smooth and glossy surface\"; and near them the Chinga na (\"Lab- yrinth\"), a cliff whose natural fissures have been artificially en- larged into passages, low corridors, small chambers , niches, and other hollowed-out spaces. Indeed, rocks dressed an d shaped into horizontal, vertical, and inclined faces, open ings, grooves, niches—all cut in precise angles and geometrical sh apes—are found everywhere behind these cliffs. The modern visitor cannot describe the scene any be tter than Squier did last century: \"The rocks all over the pl ateau back of the fortress, chiefly limestone, are cut and carved in a thousand forms. Here is a niche, or a series of them; anon a broad seat like a sofa, or a series of small seats; next a fli ght of steps; then a cluster of square or round or octagonal basins; l ong lines of grooves; occasional holes drilled down... fissures in the rock widened artificially into a chamber—and all these c ut with the accuracy and finish of the most skilful worker.\" That the Incas used the promontory for a last stand against the Spaniards is a matter of historical record. Tha t they had put up structures atop it is also evident from the rema ining masonry. But that they were not the original builders at the site is further evidenced by their recorded inability to transport even one me- galithic stone. The attempt-that-failed is reported by Garcilaso in regard to the Tired Stone. According to him. one of the Inca master- masons who wished to enhance his fame decided to ha ul up the stone from where the original builders had dropped it and use it in his defensive structure. \"More than 20.000 India ns brought this stone up. dragging it with great cables. Their progress was very slow, for the road up which they came is rough and has many steep slopes to climb and descend.... On one o f these slopes, as a result of carelessness on the part of the bearers who failed to pull evenly, the weight of the rock prove d too much for the strength of those controlling it. and it rolled over down the slope and killed three or four thousand Indians.\" According to this tale, then, the only time the Inc as at-"},{"pageNumber":132,"pageContent":"Realm of the Golden Wand 131 tempted to haul up and lift into place a cyclopean stone—they failed. Obviously, then, they were not the ones who had brought up, cut and shaped and lifted into place, with a mo rtarless fit- ting, the hundreds of the other cyclopean stones. It is no wonder that Erich von Daniken, who has pop ularized the theory of Ancient Astronauts, wrote after his v isit to the site in 1980 (Reise Nach Kiribati, or Pathways to the God s in the English translation) that neither \"mother nature\" n or the Incas —but only ancient astronauts—could have been respon sible for these monumental structures and odd-shaped cliffs. An earlier traveler. W. Bryford Jones (Four Faces of Peru, 1967 ), stated in amazement of the massive stone blocks: \"They could only have been moved, I felt, by a race of giants from anothe r world.\" And writing several years before that, Hans Helfrit z (Die alien Kulturen der Neuen Welt) said of the incredible cyc lopean walls of Sacsahuaman: \"The impression is created that the y have stood there from the very beginning of the world.\" Long before them Hiram Bingham (Across South America ) recorded one of the native speculations regarding t he manner in which these incredible rock sculptures and walls ha d been cre- ated. \"One of the favorite stories,\" he wrote, \"is that the Incas knew of a plant whose juices rendered the surface o f a block so soft that the marvellous fitting was accomplished b y rubbing the stones together for a few moments with this magical plant juice.\" But who was it that could lift and hold up s uch cyclopean stones to rub them against each other? Obviously, Bingham did not accept the natives' expla nation and the enigma continued to nag him. \"I have visite d Sacsahua- man repeatedly,\" he wrote in Inca Land. \"Each time it invari- ably overwhelms and astounds. To a superstitious In dian who sees these walls for the first time, they must seem to have been built by the gods.\" Why did Bingham make this statem ent, if not to express a \"superstition\" harbored within his own heart? And so we come full circle back to the Andean legen ds; only they explain the megalithic builders by claiming th at there had been gods and giants in these lands, and an Old Emp ire, and kingship that began with a divine golden wand."},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"7 THE DAY THE SUN STOOD STILL The initial Spanish avarice for gold and treasure o bscured their amazement at encountering in Peru, this unknown lan d at the world's end, an advanced civilization with cities a nd roads, pal- aces and temples, kings and priests—and religions.

Local clergymen, such as Father Blas Valera (son of a Span iard and an Indian woman), were encouraged to write down what t hey knew and heard. Before the sixteenth century was ove r, a con- certed effort sponsored by the Bishop of Quito was m ade to compile the local histories, evaluate all known anc ient sites, and assemble in one library all the relevant manuscript s. Much that has been learned since is based on what was learned then. Intrigued by the theories and availing himself of t he assem- bled manuscripts, a Spaniard by name of Fernando Mo ntesinos arrived in Peru in 1628 and devoted the rest of his life to the compilation of a comprehensive and chronological hi story and prehistory of the Peruvians. Some twenty years late r he com- pleted a master work titled Memories Antiguas Histo riales del Peru and deposited it in the library of the convent of San Jose de Sevilla.

He reported that the ti me of for- giveness had come, but the people must adhere to ce rtain com- mandments: royal succession would go to a son born to the king by a half sister, even if not the firstborn; and wr iting was not to be resumed. The people agreed and returned to Cuzco , with Rocca as the new king; he was given the title Inca—s overeign. By giving this first Inca the name Manco Capac, Inca histo- rians likened him to the legendary founder of Cuzco. Manco Capac of the four Ayar brothers. Montesinos correctl y sepa- rated and distanced the Spaniards' contemporary Inc a dynasty (which began to reign only in the eleventh century AD .) from its predecessors. His conclusion, that the Inca dynasty consisted of fourteen kings, including Huayna Capac who had died when the Spaniards arrived and his two warring sons, has sin ce been con- firmed by all scholars. He concluded that indeed Cuzco had been abandoned b efore that Inca dynasty had reinstated kingship in the ca pital. During the abandonment of Cuzco, he wrote, twenty-eight kin gs reigned from a hidden mountain refuge called Tampu- Tocco. And before that there had indeed been an ancient em pire with Cuzco as its capital. There, sixty-two kings sat on the throne; of"},{"pageNumber":136,"pageContent":"The Day the Sun Stood Still 135 them, forty-six were priest-kings and sixteen were semidivine rulers who were Sons of the Sun God. And. before al l that, the gods themselves lorded over the land. It is believed that Montesinos had found a copy of the Blas Valera manuscript in La Paz, and was allowed by the Jesuit priests there to copy from it. He also relied heavi ly on the writ- ings of Father Miguel Cabello de Balboa, whose versio n related that the first sovereign, Manco Capac, had come to Cu zco not directly from Lake Titicaca but by way of a hidden place called \"Tampo-Toco\" (\"Restplace of the Windows\"). It was t here that Manco Capac \"abused his sister Mama Occllo\" and bego t a son by her. Montesinos, having confirmed this by all his other available sources, accepted this information as factual. He t hus began the chronicles of kingship in Peru with the journey of the four Ayar brothers and their four sisters who were sent to fi nd Cuzco with the aid of the golden object. But he recorded a ver sion whereby the first to be chosen as a leader was a brother th at bore the name of the ancestor who had led the people to the Andes. Pirua Manco (and thus the name Peru). It was he who . having arrived at the chosen site, announced that he had d ecided to build there a city. He came there accompanied by wi ves and sisters (or sister-wives); one of them bore him a s on who was called Manco Capac. It was this son who built in Cuz co the Temple to the Great God, Viracocha; and therefore i t is from that time that the establishment of the ancient emp ire is counted and the chronicles of the dynasties begin. Manco Cap ac was acclaimed as Son of the Sun, and was the first of s ixteen rulers so deemed. In his time other deities were venerated , one of whom was Mother Earth and another a god whose name meant Fire; he was represented by a stone that spoke orac les. The principal science at that time. Montesinos wrot e, was that of astrology; and the art of writing, on proce ssed leaves of the plantain tree and on stones, was known. The fif th Capac \"renewed the computation of time\" and began to reco rd the passage of time and the reigns of his ancestors. It was he who introduced the count of a thousand years as a Great Period, and of centuries and periods of fifty years, equivalent to the biblical Jubilee.

After a time they began to go into the mountains; fortunately, they p rovoked the wrath of the Great God and he destroyed them with a heavenly fire. Relieved of the dangers, the people forgot the comma nd- ments and the rites of worship. \"Good laws and cust oms\" were abandoned, and this did not go unnoticed by the Crea tor. In punishment, he hid the sun from the land; \"there wa s no dawn for twenty hours.\" There was a great outcry among t he people and prayers and sacrifices were offered at the temp le, until (after twenty hours) the sun reappeared. The king i mmediately thereafter reintroduced laws of conduct and rites o f worship. The fortieth Capac on the throne of Cuzco established an academy for the study of astronomy and astrology an d deter- mined the equinoxes. The fifth year of his reign, M ontesinos calculated, was the twenty-five hundredth year from Point Zero which, he assumed, was the Deluge. It was also the two thou- sandth year since kingship had begun at Cuzco; in c elebration whereof the king was granted a new title, Pachacuti (Re- former). His successors also promoted the study of astronomy; one of them introduced a leap year of one extra day every four years and one extra year every four hundred years. In the reign of the fifty-eighth monarch, \"when the Fourth Sun was completed,\" the count was 2,900 years since the \"Del- uge.\" It was, Montesinos calculated, the year in wh ich Jesus Christ was born. That first Cuzco empire, begun by the Sons of the Su n and continued by priest-kings, came to a bitter end in the reign of the sixty-second monarch. In his time there occurre d \"marvels and portents.\" The earth shook with endless earthqu akes, the skies were filled with comets, omens of a coming de struction. Tribes and peoples began to rush to and fro, clashi ng with their neighbors. Invaders came from the coast, even from across the Andes. Great battles ensued; in one of them the kin g was felled by an arrow and his army fled in panic; only five h undred war- riors survived the battles. \"Thus was the government of the Peruvian monarchy l ost and destroyed,\" Montesinos wrote, \"and the knowledg e of let- ters was lost.\" The few remaining followers left Cuzco, leaving behi nd only a handful of priests to take care of the temple.

In the reign of the seve nty-eighth monarch, when the milestone of 3.500 years since th e Beginning was reached, a certain person began to revive the a rt of writing It was then that the king received a warning from t he priests concerning the invention of letters. It was the kno wledge of writing, their message explained, that was the caus e of the pes- tilences and accursations that had brought kingship in Cuzco to an end. The god's wish was \"that no one ought to us e the letters or resuscicate them, for from their employment grea t harm would come [again].\" Therefore the king commanded \" by law. under the pain of death, that no one should traffic in quilcas, which were the parchments and leaves of trees on wh ich they used to write, nor should use any sort of letters.\" Instead, he introduced the use of quipos, the strands of colore d cords that had served since then for chronological purposes. In the reign of the ninetieth monarch, the fourth m illennium from Point Zero was completed. By then the monarchy at Tampu-Tocco was weak and ineffective. The tribes lo yal to it were subject to raids and invasions by neighbors. T ribal chiefs ceased paying homage to the central authority. Custo ms were corrupted, abominations proliferated. In such circu mstances a princess of the original blood of the Sons of the S un. one Mama Ciboca, rose to the occasion. She announced that her young son. who was so handsome that his admirers nickname d him Inca, was destined to regain the throne at the old capital. Cuzco. In a miraculous way he disappeared and return ed clothed in golden robes, claiming that the Sun God had taken him aloft, instructed him in secret knowledge, and told him to lead the people back to Cuzco.

I ndeed, all the Old World civilizations had recollections of pa st ages, of eras when the gods reigned alone, followed by demig ods and heroes, and then just mortals. Sumerian texts calle d King Lists recorded a line of divine lords followed by demigod s who reigned a total of 432,000 years before the Deluge, then listed the kings that reigned thereafter through times tha t are by now considered historical and whose data has been verif ied and found accurate. The Egyptian king lists, as compose d by the priest-historian Manetho, listed a dynasty of twelv e gods that began some 10,000 years before the Deluge; it was f ollowed by gods and demigods until, circa 3100 B.C., the pharaoh s ascended the throne of Egypt. Again, where his data could be verified against historical records, it was found to be accu rate. Montesinos found such notions in the Peruvian colle ctive lore, confirming the reports of other chroniclers t hat the Incas believed that theirs was the Fifth Age or Sun. The First Age was that of Viracochas. gods who were white and bearded . The Sec- ond age was that of the giants; some of them were n ot benevo- lent, and there had been conflicts between the gods and the giants. Then followed the Age of Primitive Man, of uncultured human beings. The Fourth Age was the age of heroes, men who were demigods. And then there was the Fifth Age, th e age of human kings, of whom the Incas were last in line. Montesinos also placed the Andean chronology in the Euro- pean frame by relating it to a certain Point Zero ( he thought it had to be the Deluge) and—most clearly—to the birth of Christ. The two lime sequences, he wrote, coincided in the reign of the fifty-eighth monarch: the twenty-nine hundredth year from Point Zero was the \"first year of Jesus Ch rist.\" The Peruvian monarchies, he wrote, began 500 years afte r Point Zero. i.e.. in 2400 B.C. The problem scholars have with the history and chro nology of Montesinos is thus not lack of clarity, but its conclusion that kingship and urban civilization began—at Cuzco—almos t 3,500 years before the Incas. That civilization, accordin g to the infor- mation amassed by Montesinos and those on whose wor k he had relied, possessed writing, included astronomy a mong its sciences, and had a calendar long enough to require its periodic reform.

Impossible—if th ere had been no contacts between the Old and New Worlds. Po ssible, if the same grantors of all knowledge, the gods, were the same and were present all over the Earth. Incredible as our conclusion must sound, happily it can be proven. The first test of the veracity of the events and ch ronologies compiled by Montesinos had already taken place. A key element in the Montesinos presentation is the exis- tence of an ancient empire, of a line of kings at Cu zco who were finally forced to leave the capital and seek refuge in a secluded mountain place called Tampu-Tocco. The interregnum lasted a thousand years; finally a young man of noble birth was chosen to lead the people back to Cuzco and establish the I nca dynasty. Was there a Tampu-Tocco. and was it a place identif iable by the landmarks given by Montesinos? The question int rigued many. In 1911, searching for lost Inca cities. Hira m Bingham of Yale University found the place; it is now called M achu Picchu. Bingham was not looking for Tampu-Tocco when he set out on his first expedition; but after repeatedly going back and ex- haustive excavations over more than two decades, he concluded that Machu Picchu was indeed the lost interim capit al of the Old Empire. His descriptions of the place, still the mo st comprehen- sive, are in his books Machu Picchu, a Citadel of th e Incas and The Lost City of the Incas. The principal reason for believing that Machu Picch u is the legendary Tampu-Tocco is the clue of the Three Wind ows. Montesinos recorded that \"at the place of his birth Inca Rocca ordered works to be executed, consisting of a mason ry wall with three windows, which were the emblem of the house o f his fa- thers, of whom he descended.\" The name of the place to which the royal house had gone from the stricken capital Cuzco meant \"Haven of the Three Windows.\" That a place should become known for its windows sh ould not be surprising, since no house in Cuzco. from th e humblest to the grandest, had windows. That a place should b ecome known for a specific number of windows—three—could only be the result of the uniqueness, antiquity, or sanc tity of the ac- tual existence of such a structure. This was true o f Tampu- Tocco, where according to the legends a structure w ith three windows played a role in the emergence of tribes an d the an- cient empire in Peru's beginning, a structure that had therefore become \"the emblem of the house of his fathers of w hom [Inca Rocca] had descended.\""},{"pageNumber":141,"pageContent":"140 THE LOST REALMS The legend, and the legendary place, featured in th e tale of the Ayar brothers.

Manco Capac, carried wit h him a sacred emblem in the image of a falcon, and also bo re a golden rod that the god had given him with which to locate the right place for the future capital. Cuzco. The journey of the four brother-sister couples began peacefully; but soon j ealousies de- veloped. On the pretext that certain treasures were left behind in a cave in Tampu-Tocco, the second brother, Ayar Cachi, was sent back to retrieve them. This however was only a ruse by the three brothers to imprison him in the cave, where h e was turned into a stone. According to these tales, then, Tampu-Tocco dates f rom the very early times; \"the myth of the Ayars,\" H. B. Ale xander wrote in Latin American Mythology, \"hearkens back t o the Megalithic Age and to the cosmogonies associated wi th Titi- caca.\" When the exiles left Cuzco. they went to a pl ace already in existence, a place where a structure with three windows had already played a role in even earlier events. It is with this un- derstanding that we can now proceed to visit Machu Picchu, for a structure whose wall has three windows has indeed been found there, and nowhere else. \"Machu Picchu, or Great Picchu, is the Quichua name of a sharp peak which rises ten thousand feet above the sea and four thousand feet above the roaring rapids of the Uruba mba River near the bridge of San Miguel, two hard days' journ ey north of Cuzco,\" Bingham wrote. \"Northwest of Machu Picchu is an- other beautiful peak surrounded by magnificent prec ipices, called Huayna Picchu, or Lesser Picchu. On the narr ow ridge between the two peaks are the ruins of an Inca city whose name has been lost in the shadows of the past... It is p ossible that they represent two ancient sites, Tampu-Tocco, the birthplace of the first Inca, and Vilcabamba Viejo.\" Nowadays the journey from Cuzco to Machu Picchu, a dis- tance of some seventy-five miles as the crow flies, does not re- quire the two days' hard journey described by Bingha m just to get there.

The dwell- ing houses are built mostly of fieldstones held tog ether with mortar. The royal residences are built of ashlars l aid in courses, as finely cut and dressed as any in Cuzco. Then ther e is one structure where the workmanship is so perfect as to be un- matched; and there are the polygonal megalithic sto ne blocks. In many instances, the remains from the earlier Meg alithic Age and Ancient Empire times have remained as was; in o thers, later construction atop earlier courses is obvious. While the eastern wards occupied every available sq uare foot of mountaintop and extended from the city*s wall in the south as far north as the terrain permitted and eastward int o the agricul- tural and burial terraces, the western group of war ds, that also began at the wall, extended northward only to the b order of a Sacred Plaza—as though an unseen line marked off ha llowed ground that could not be encroached upon. Beyond that unseen demarcation line, and facing the great terraced plaza to the east, stand the remains of wh at Bingham has identified as the Sacred Plaza, mainly \"because on two sides of it are the largest temples,\" one of them with th e crucial three windows. It is here, in the construction of what Bin gham had named the Temple of the Three Windows and. adjoinin g it in the Sacred Plaza, the Principal Temple, that cyclop ean polyg- onal stone blocks have been used at the site. The m anner in which they were cut, shaped, dressed, and fitted to gether with- out mortar puts them in a class with the cyclopean stone blocks and megalithic structures of Sacsahuaman; and, surp assing the polygonality of anything seen in Cuzco, one of the s tone blocks here has thirty-two angles. The Temple of the Three Windows stands at the easte rn edge of the Sacred Plaza; the cyclopean stone blocks of its eastern wall raise it well above the terraced level to its west (Fig. 73), affording an unimpeded eastward view through the th ree win- dows (Fig. 74). Trapezoid in shape, their sills are cut out of the cyclopean stones that form the wall itself. As at S acsahuaman and Cuzco, this cutting, shaping, and angling of the hard granite stones was done as though they were soft putty; her e too, the white granite stone blocks had to be brought from g reat dis- tances, through rough terrain and rivers, down vall eys and up mountains.

A passage in L'Origin de los Indios del Nuevo Mundo (Valencia, 1610), page 91, leaves no doubt in this re- gard.\" After speaking of the Mexican hieroglyphs, F ather Gar- cia adds: \"at the start of the conquest, the Indian s of Peru confessed themselves by painting characters that li sted the Ten Commandments and the transgressions committed agains t them.\" It is possible to conclude that the Peruvian s possessed the use of a picture script, but that their symbols were coarser than the Mexican heiroglyphs. and that generally th e people availed themselves of the quippus. Humboldt also reported that when he was in Lima, he heard of a missionary named Narcisse Gilbar who had found , among the Panos Indians of the Ucayale river north of Lim a, a book of folded leaves, similar to such as had been used by the Aztecs in Mexico; but no one in Lima could read it.\"It was sa id that the Indians told the Missionary that the book recorded ancient wars and voyages.\" Writing in 1855, Ribero and von Tschudi reported va rious other discoveries and concluded that there had inde ed been an- other method of writing in Peru besides the quipos.

It was in the third year of his reign, when \"good customs were fo rgotten and people were given to all manner of vice,\" that \"the re was no dawn for twenty hours.\" In other words, the night d id not end when it usually does and sunrise was delayed for tw enty hours. After a great outcry, confessions of sins, sacrific es, and prayers, the sun finally rose. This could not have been an eclipse: it was not tha t the shin- ing sun was obscured by a shadow. Besides, no eclips e lasts so long, and the Peruvians were cognizant of such peri odic events. The tale does not say that the sun disappeared; it says that it did not rise—\"there was no dawn\"—for twenty hours. It was as though the sun, wherever it was hiding, s uddenly stood still."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"152 THE LOST REALMS If the Andean recollection is true, then somewhere else—on the opposite side of the world—the DAY had to last just as long, not ending when it should have ended but lasting so me twenty hours longer. Incredibly, such an event is recorded, and in no be tter place than in the Bible itself. It was as the Israelites, under the leader- ship of Joshua, had crossed the Jordan River into th eir Prom- ised Land and had successfully taken the fortified cities of Jericho and Ai. It was then that all the Amorite ki ngs formed an alliance to put up a combined force against the Isr aelites. A great battle unsued in the valley of Ajalon. near t he city of Gibeon. It began with an Israelite night attack tha t put the Ca- naanites into flight. By sunrise, as the Canaanite fo rces re- grouped near Beth-Horon, the Lord God \"cast down gre at stones from heaven upon them... and they died; ther e were more of them who had died from the hailstones than those whom the Israelites slew with the sword.\" Then Joshua spoke unto Yahweh, on the day when Yahweh delivered the Amorites unto the Children of Israel, saying: \"In the sight of the Israelites, let the Sun stand still in Gibeon and the Moon in the valley of Ajalon.\" And the Sun stood still, and the Moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves of the enem ies. Indeed it is all written in the Book of Jashar: The Sun stood still in the midst of the skies and it hastened not to go down about a whole day. Scholars have struggled for generations with this t ale in Chapter 10 of the Book of Joshua. Some discount it as mere fiction; others see in it echoes of a myth; still o thers seek to explain it in terms of an unusually prolonged eclip se of the sun. But not only are such long eclipses unknown; the tal e does not speak of the disappearance of the sun. On the contr ary, it re- lates to an event when the sun continued to be seen , to hang on in the skies, for \"about a whole day\"—say, twenty h ours?

In Canaan the sun did not set fo r some twenty hours; in the Andes, the sun did not rise fo r the same length of time. Do not the two tales, then, describe the same event , and by coming from different sides of the Earth attest to its factuality? What the occurrence was is still a puzzle. The only biblical clue is the mention of the great stones falling fro m the skies. Since we know that the tales describe not a standst ill by the sun (and moon) but a disruption of Earth's rotation on its axis, a possible explanation is that a comet had come too c lose to Earth, disintegrating in the process. Since some co mets orbit the sun in a clockwise direction that is opposite t o the orbital direction of the Earth and the other planets, such a kinetic force could have conceivably counteracted temporarily the Earth's rotation and slowed it down. Whatever the precise cause of the phenomenon, what we are concerned with here is its timing. The generally ac cepted date for the Exodus has been the thirteenth century B.C. ( circa 1230 B.C.), and scholars who argued for a date earlier by some two centuries found themselves in a minority. Still, we have con- cluded in our previous writings (see The Wars of Go ds and Men) that a date of 1433 B.C. would fit the event, as well as the bibli- cal tales of the Hebrew patriarchs, perfectly into known con- temporary events and chronologies of Mesopotamia an d Egypt. Subsquent to the publication of our conclusions (in 1985), two eminent biblical scholars and archaeologists, John J. Bimson and David Livingston, reached after an exhaustive s tudy (Bibli- cal Archaeology Review, September/October 1987) the conclu- sion that the Exodus took place about 1460 B.C. Apart from their own archaeological findings and an analysis o f the Bronze Age periods in the ancient Near East, the biblical data and cal- culation process that they have employed was the ve ry same process we had used two years earlier. (We had also explained then why we had chosen to reconcile two lines of bi blical data by dating the Exodus in 1433 B.C. rather than 1460 B. C.). Since the Israelites wandered in the deserts of Sin ai for forty years, the entry into Canaan took place in 1393 B . C .; the occur- rence observed by Joshua happened soon thereafter. The question now is: did the opposite phenomenon, t he pro- longed night, occur in the Andes at the same time?

When did the fifteenth monarch reign? The available data suggests that the nine kings that separated the fou rth and fif- teenth monarch reigned a total of about 500 years, placing Titu Yupanqui Pachacuti II at about 1400 B.C.

A f armer tilling the land year after year can judge the change of se asons and the coming of rains better than an astronomer, and has the ground- hog to tell him a thing or two. The fact is that wh erever pockets of primitive societies (subsisting on agriculture) have been found in remote parts of the world, they have lived and fed themselves for generations without astronomers and a precise calendar. It is also an established fact that the c alendar was de- vised in antiquity by an urban, not an agricultural , society. A simple sun clock, a gnomon, can provide enough da ily and seasonal information if one could not have survived without it. Yet ancient man studied the heavens and aligned his temples toward stars and planets, and linked his calendar a nd festivals not to the ground upon which he stood but to the wa ys of heaven. Why? Because the calendar was devised not fo r agricul- tural but for religious purposes. Not to benefit ma nkind, but to venerate the gods. And the gods, according to the f irst-ever religion and the people who gave us the calendar, c ame from the heavens. One ought to read and reread the Pslamist's verses to realize that the observation of the wonders of the celestia l phenomena had nothing to do with tilling the land or herding the cattle: it had to do with the veneration of the Lord of All. A nd there is no way to understand that better than to go back to Sumer; for it was there, some 6,000 years ago, that astronomy, the calen- dar, and a religion linking Earth with the Heavens had their beginning. It was knowledge, the Sumerians asserted , that was given them by the Anunnaki (\"Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came\") who had come to Earth from their planet . Ni- biru.

This, we believe, is why Man became an astronomer. This is why. as time passed and Nibiru itself could no long er be ob- served, Man sought signs and omens in the phenomena that could be seen, and astronomy bred astrology. And if the astro- nomical orientations and alignments and celestial d ivisions that began in Sumer could also be found in the Andes, an irrefutable link would be proven. Some time early in the fourth millennium B.C., accord ing to Sumerian texts, the ruler of Nibiru, Anu, and his s pouse Antu paid a visit to Earth. A brand-new sacred precinct with a tem- ple-tower was built in their honor at a place that later came to be known as Uruk (the biblical Erech). A text has b een pre- served on clay tablets describing their night there . In the eve- ning a ceremonial meal began with a ritual washing of the hands on a celestial signal—the appearance of Jupiter. Ve nus, Mer- cury, Saturn. Mars, and the Moon. Then the first pa rt of the meal was served, followed by a pause. While a group of priests began to chant the hymn Kakkab Anu Elellu Shamame ( \"The Planet of Anu Rises in the Skies\"), an astronomer-pr iest, at the \"topmost stage of the tower of the temple\" watched for the appearance of the Planet of Anu, Nibiru. When the p lanet was sighted, the priests broke out in singing the compo sition \"To the One Who Grows Bright, the Heavenly Planet of the Lor d Anu.\" and the psalm \"The Creator's Image Has Arisen. \" A bonfire was lit to signal the moment and to pass th e news to neighboring towns. Before the night was over the who le land was ablaze with bonfires; and in the morning, praye rs of thanks- giving were recited. The care and great astronomical knowledge that were re- quired for building temples in Sumer are evident fr om the in- scriptions of the Sumerian King Gudea (circa 2200 B. C.). First there appeared to him \"a man who shone like the hea ven,\" who was standing beside a \"divine bird.\" This being. Gu dea wrote, \"who by the crown on his head was obviously a god.\" turned out to have been the god Ningirsu. He was accompanied b y a god- dess who \"held the tablet of her favorable star of the heavens.\" In her other hand she held \"a holy stylus\" with whi ch she pointed out to the king \"the favorable planet.\" A t hird human- looking god held in his hands a tablet made of prec ious stone, on which the plan of the temple was drawn.

And it was. th e text indi- cates, not a Solar but a Start + Planet Temple. The sophisticated astronomical knowledge displayed by the Sumerians was not limited to the building of temple s. As we have brought out in our previous volumes and as is now gener- ally acknowledged, it was in Sumer that all the con cepts and principles of modern spherical astronomy were laid out. The list can begin with the division of a circle into 360 de grees, the de- vising of zenith, horizon, and other astronomical c oncepts and terminologies, and end with the grouping of stars i nto constella- tions, the devising, naming, and pictorial depictio n of the zodiac and its twelve houses, and the recognition of the p henomenon of Precession—the retardation, by about one degree every sev- enty-two years, of Earth's motion around the sun. Whereas the Planet of the Gods, Nibiru, appeared an d dis- appeared in the course of its 3.600 Earth-years orb it. Mankind on Earth could count the passage of time only in te rms of its own orbit around the Sun. After the phenomenon of d ay and night the easiest to recognize are the seasons. As the simplest and abundant stone circles attest, it was easy to e stablish markers delineating the four points in the Earth/Su n relation- ship: the Sun's apparent rising higher in the skies and lingering longer as winter gives way to spring; a point when day and night appear equal; then the gradual distancing of the Su n as days grow shorter and the temperature begins to drop. As cold and darkness increase and it seems that the Sun may van ish alto- gether, it hesitates, stops, and begins to come bac k; and the whole cycle is repeated—a new year has begun. Thus were the four occurrences in the Earth/Sun cycle establi shed: the summer and winter solstices (\"solar standstills') w hen the Sun reaches its outermost positions north and south, an d the spring and autumn equinoxes (when day and night are equal) . To relate this apparent movement of the sun in rela tion to Earth when it is actually Earth that orbits around the Sun—a fact known to and depicted by the Sumerians—it was necessary to provide the observer on Earth with a celestial p oint of refer- ence. This was achieved by dividing the heavens, th e great circle formed by the Earth around the Sun. into twelve par ts—the twelve houses of the Zodiac, each with its own grou p of discern- ible stars (the constellations). A point was chosen —the spring equinox—and the zodiac house in which the Sun was s een at that moment was declared the first day of the first month of the new year. This, all research of the earliest record s show, was in the zodiac house or Age of Taurus."},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"The Ways of Heaven 159 But then came Precession to spoil the arrangement. Be cause Earth's axis is inclined in relation to its orbital plane around the Sun (23.5 degrees nowadays) and it spins as a top, the axis points to a shifting celestial spot, forming a grea t imaginary cir- cle in the heavens that takes 25.920 years to compl ete. That means that the selected \"fixed point.\" shifting one degree every 72 years, shifts completely from one zodiac house t o another every 2,160 years. Some two millennia after the cal endar was begun in Sumer, it was necessary to order a reform of the calen- dar and select as the fixed point the House of Arie s. Our astrol- ogers still chart their horoscopes based on the Fir st Point of Aries, although our astronomers know that we have b een al- most two thousand years in the Age of Pisces (and a re about to enter the Age of Aquarius). The division of the grand celestial circle into twe lve parts, in honor of the twelve members of the solar system and the matching pantheon of twelve \"Olympian\" gods, also b rought the solar year into a close correlation with the pe riodicity of the Moon. But. since the lunar month falls short of fil ling the solar year exactly twelve times, complex intercalary meth ods were devised by which to add days once in a while so as to bring the twelve lunar months into alignment with the solar y ear. By Babylonian times, in the second millennium B.C.. te mples required a triple alignment: to the new zodiac (Ari es), to the matching four solar points (the most important of w hich, in Babylon, was the spring equinox), and to the lunar p eriod. The principal temple of Babylon honoring its national g od Marduk. the remains of which have been found in relatively good preser- vation, exemplifies all these astronomical principl es. Texts have also been found that describe in architectural term s its twelve gates and seven stages, enabling scholars to recons truct its serviceability as a sophisticated solar, lunar, pla netary, and stel- lar observatory (Fig. 81). That astronomy, combined with archaeology, can help date monuments, explain historical events, and define th e celestial origins of religious beliefs, has been recongized f ully only in recent years. It took almost a century for this rea lization to reach the level of a discipline called archaeoastro nomy, for it was in 1894 that Sir Norman Lockyer (The Dawn of As tronomy) showed convincingly that at all times and almost ev erywhere— from the earliest shrines to the greatest cathedral s—the temples have been oriented astronomically. It is noteworthy that the idea had occurred to him due to \"a remarkable thing : in Baby- lon, from the beginning of things, the sign for God was a star\"; likewise, in Egypt, \"in the hieroglyphic texts, thr ee stars repre-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"Figure 81 sented the plural 'gods.'\" He also noted that in th e Hindu pan- theon, the most venerated temple gods were Indra (\" The Day Brought by the Sun\") and Ushas (\"Dawn\"), gods relate d to the rising of the Sun. Focusing on Egypt, where ancient temples still stan d and their architecture and orientation can be studied i n detail, Lockyer recognized that temples in antiquity were e ither Sun Temples or Star Temples. The former were temples wh ose axis and ritual or calendric functions aligned them with either the solstices of the equinoxes; the latter were temples not connected with any of the four Sun points, but designed to ob serve and venerate the appearance of a certain star on a cert ain day at a certain point on the horizon. Lockyer found it amaz ing that the older the temples were, the more sophisticated thei r astronomy had been. Thus, at the beginning of their civilizat ion, the Egyp- tians were able to combine a stellar aspect (the br ightest star then, Sirius) with a solar event (the summer solsti ce) and with the annual rising of the Nile. Lockyer calculated t hat the triple coincidence could happen only once in about 1,460 y ears, and that the Egyptian Point Zero, when their calendrica l count began, was circa 3200 B.C. But Lockyer's principal contribution to what (after almost a century!) had evolved into archaeoastronomy was the realiza- tion that the orientation of ancient temples could be a clue to the exact time of their construction. His major exa mple was the complex of temples at Thebes in Upper Egypt (Karnak ). There the older, more sophisticated orientation of the ea rliest sacred cities (to the equinoxes) had given way to the easi er orientation toward the solstices.

The orientation was such that at solstice time a beam of sunlight w ould travel the whole length of a corridor (some five hundred f eet long), passing from one part of the temple to the other be tween two obelisks. And. for a couple of minutes, the sunbeam would strike the Holy of Holies with a flash of light at the far end of the corridor, thereby signaling the moment when the first day of the first month began the new year. But that precise moment was not constant; it kept sh ifting, resulting in the construction of subsequent temples with modi- fied orientations. When the orientation was based o n the equi- noxes, the shifting was the varying stellar backgro und against which the Sun was seen—the shift in zodiacal \"ages\" due to precession. But there appeared to be another and mor e pro- found shift affecting the solstices: the angle betw een the ex- tremes to which the sun seemed to wander kept dimin ishing!

The Eart h's wob- ble changes this tilt by about 1 degree over 7,000 years or so, decreasing to perhaps 21 degrees before it starts t o increase again to well over 24 degrees. Rolf Muller, who appl ied this fact to Andean archaeology (Der Himmel uber dem Menschen der Steinzeit and other studies) calculated that if arc haeological re- mains were oriented to a tilt of 24 degrees, it mea ns they were built at least 4,000 years ago. The application of this sophisticated and independe nt dating method is as important as the innovation of radioca rbon dating —perhaps even more so, since radiocarbon tests can be made only on organic materials (such as wood or charcoal ) found in or near buildings, which does not preclude an unknown earlier age for the building; but archaeoastronomy can date the building itself and even the times when different parts were constructed. Professor Muller, whose work we shall examine more closely, concluded that the perfect ashlar structures at Mac hu Picchu and Cuzco (as distant from the polygonal megalithic ones) are over 4,000 years old, thereby confirming the chrono logy of Montesinos. Such application of archaeoastronomy to Andean remains, as we shall see, has upset even more notio ns regarding the antiquity of civilization in the Americas. Modern astronomers were slow to come to Machu Picch u, but eventually they did. It was in the 1930s that Ro lf Muller, a professor of astronomy at the University of Potsdam , published his first studies dealing with the astronomical asp ects of the ruins of Tiahuanacu, Cuzco. and Machu Picchu. His co nclu- sions, establishing the great antiquity of these re mains, and especially of the monuments of Tiahuanacu. nearly r uined his career. At Machu Picchu Muller focused his attention on the Inti- huatana atop the hill in the city's northwest and o n the structure atop the sacred rock, for in both places he saw pre cise features that enabled him to figure out their purposes and u se (Die Inti- watana (Sonnenwarten) im Allen Peru and other writi ngs). The Intihuatana. he realized, was placed atop the h ighest point of the city. It could command a view of the h orizon in all directions; but walls of megalithic ashlars confine d the view to only certain directions, ones that were in the mind of the builders.

Muller determined that the various inclined surfaces and angled sides were so de- vised as to enable the determination of sunset at t he summer solstice, sunrise at the winter solstice, and of th e spring and autumn equinoxes. Before his investigations at Machu Picchu Miiller ha d re- searched at length the archaeoastronomical aspects of Tiahuan- acu and at Cuzco. An old Spanish woodcut (Fig. 83a) suggested to him that the great Temple of the Sun at Cuzco wa s so con- structed as to allow the sun's rays to shine direct ly into the Holy of Holies at the moment of sunrise on the day of th e winter solstice. Applying the theories of Lockyer to the Co ricancha, Miiller was able to calculate and show how the pre- Columbian walls together with the circular Holy of Holies wer e able to serve the same purpose as the temples of Egypt (Fig . 83b).

After establishing that the straight walls of this structure were orie nted by its ar- chitects according to the geographic location and e levation above sea level of the site, he determined that the two trapezoid windows in the circular portion (Fig. 84) enabled a n observer to see through them sunrise at the summer and winter s olstices— 4.000 years ago!

They confirmed the a stronomi- cal orientations of the Intihuatana and the two win dows in the Torreon (where the viewing takes place from the pro truding sacred rock along its grooves and edges). They did not join, however, in Muller's discussion of the structure's age. Neither they nor Muller attempted to trace back, to millenn ia ago. the lines of observation through the most ancient megal ithic struc- ture, the legendary Three Windows. There, we believ e, the re- sults would have been even more astounding. Muller did, however, study the orientation of the m egalithic walls in Cuzco.

In other words. Muller concluded that the structures from the pre-Inca period stretc h over two zodiac ages: the megalithic ones belonging to the A ge of Taurus, the ones from the time of the Ancient Empir e and the hiatus at Tampu-Tocco being from the Age of Aries. In the ancient Near East the shift caused by preces sion re- quired periodic reform of the original Sumerian cal endar. A major change, accompanied by major religious upheav als, took place circa 2000 B.C. with the transition from the zo diac of the Bull to that of the Ram. To others' (but not our own) amaze- ment, such changeovers and reforms are also evidenc ed in the Andes. That the ancient Andean people had a calendar shoul d have been a foregone conclusion from the writings of Mon tesinos and other chroniclers who referred to repeated reforms of the calen- dar by various monarchs. It took however several st udies, be- ginning in the 1930s, to confirm that these people not only had a calendar but also recorded it (though they were sup posed to have no writing). A pioneer in the field, Fritz Buck (Inscrip- ciones Calendarias del Peru Preincaico and other wri tings) pro- duced archaeological evidence to support such concl usions, such as a mace that was a time-reckoning instrument and a vase, found in the ruins of the temple of Pachacamac, tha t denoted four periods of twelve with the aid of line and dot markings akin to those of the Maya and Olmecs. According to Father Molina, the Incas \"commenced to count the year in the middle of May. a few days more or l ess, on the first of the moon. They went to the Coricancha in th e morning, at noon, and at night, bringing the sheep that were to be sacri- ficed that day.\" During the sacrifices, the priests chanted hymns, saying \"O Creator, O Sun, O Thunder, be forev er young and do not grow old; let all things be at pea ce; let the people multiply and their food and all things conti nue to be abundant.\" Because the Gregorian calendar was introduced in Cuz co only after Molina's time, the day of the New Year r elated by him corresponds to May 25 or thereabouts. Observati on towers that had been described by Garcilaso have been disc overed in recent years by astronomers from the universities o f Texas and Illinois; they found that the sighting lines were p roper for May 25.

The Intihuatana at Machu Picchu, as we have mention ed, served to determine not only the solstices but also the equinoxes (when daylight and nighttime are equal when the Sun is over the Equator, in March and September). Both the chronicle rs and modern researchers (such as L. E. Valcarel, The And ean Calen- dar) report that the Incas went to great lengths to determine the precise days of the equinoxes and venerated them. T his custom must have also stemmed from earlier times, for we r ead in the early reports that the monarchs of the Ancient Empi re were preoccupied with the need to determine the equinoxe s. Montesinos informs us that the fortieth monarch of the An- cient Empire established an academy for the study o f astronomy and astrology and determined the equinoxes. The fac t that he was given the title Pachacutec indicates that the c alendar was at that time so much out of synchronization with the c elestial phe- nomena that its reform became imperative. This is a most inter- esting bit of information that has been totally neg lected. According to Montesinos, it was in the fifth year o f this monarch's reign that 2500 years from Point Zero had been comp leted—and 2,000 years from the beginning of the ancient empir e. What was happening circa 400 B.C. that required a ref orm of the calendar? The length of the time span, 2000 yea rs, parallels the time spans of zodiacal shifts due to precession . In the an- cient Near East, when the calendar was begun at Nip pur circa 4000 B.C., the spring equinox occurred in the House o r Age of Taurus. It retarded to that of Aries circa 2000 B.C. and to Pisces by Christ's time. The Andean reform circa 400 B.C. confirms that the an cient empire and its calendar indeed began circa 2500 B.C. It also suggests that those monarchs were familiar with the zodiac; but the zodiac was a purely artificial and arbitrary di vision of the celestial band around the Sun into twelve parts; a Sumerian invention that had been adopted in the Old World by all the peoples who had succeeded them (to this very day). Was this possible? The answer is yes. One of the pioneers in the field, S. Hagar, in a le cture deliv- ered to the fourteenth Congress of Americanists in 1904, titled \"The Peruvian Asterisms and their Relation to the Rit ual,\" showed that the Incas not only were familiar with t he zodiac houses (and their parallel months) but also had dis tinct names for them.

Cuzco itself was a testimonial in stone both to the familiarity with the twelve-house zodiac and the an tiquity of that knowledge. We have already mentioned the divis ion of Cuzco into twelve wards and their association with t he zodiac houses. It is significant that he first ward, on th e slopes of Sac- sahuaman. was associated with Aries. For Aries to h ave been associated with the spring equinox, as we have show n, we have to turn the clock back more than 4.000 years. One must wonder whether the knowledge required for such astronomical information and calendar reforms could have been retained and passed along over so many millennia wi thout some kind of record-keeping, without being written down in some form. The Maya codices contained, as we have seen, astronomi- cal data copied and obtained from earlier sources. Archaeolo- gists have determined that oblong bars held by Maya rulers (as depicted on their stelae) were actually \"sky bars\" that spelled out the glyphs for certain constellations of the zo diac (as was the series of glyphs framing the image of Pacal on the lid of his coffin, at Palenque). Were these artful depictions from the clas- sic period copied from earlier, perhaps less artist ically refined, calendrical records? This is suggested by a round s tone found at Tikal (Fig. 85a) on which the image of the Sun God (with beard and tongue out) is surrounded by celestial glyphs.

In spite of the treatment meted out by the Sp aniards to anything connected with the \"idols.\" and especially if the object was made of gold (which was quickly melted down, as had hap- pened to the Image of the sun from the Coricancha). at least one such relic remains.

It was early in 1533 that a small band of soldiers from Pi- zarro's landing party had entered Cuzco, the Inca ca pital. The main body of Pizarro's force was still at Cajamarca. where they held the pretender. Atahualpa, prisoner; and the mi ssion of the band sent to Cuzco was to get the capital's contribu tion to the golden ransom demanded by the Spaniards in exchange for Atahualpa's freedom. In Cuzco, Atahualpa's general Quizquiz allowed them to enter and examine several important buildings, incl uding the Temple of the Sun; the Incas, as we have mentioned, called it the Coricancha, the Golden Enclosure, for its walls were cov- ered with golden plates and within the walls there had been wondrous artifacts of gold, silver, and precious st ones. The few Spaniards who had entered Cuzco removed seven hundre d gold plates and helped themselves to other treasure and returned to Cajamarca. The main Spanish force entered Cuzco at the end of t hat year; and we have already described the fate that b efell the city, its edifices, and its shrines, including the desecr ation of the Holy of Holies and the looting, then melting down, of th e Golden Emblem of the sun that hung above the Great Altar. But the physical destruction could not eradicate wha t the Incas retained in their memories. The Coricancha was built, the Incas recalled, by the very first monarch; it began as a hut with a thatched roof. Later monarchs enlarged and enhanc ed it. until it assumed the final dimensions and shape as seen b y the Span- iards. In the Holy of Holies, they related, the wal ls were cov- ered from floor to ceiling with plates of gold. \"Ov er what was called the High Altar.\" Garcilaso wrote, \"was the i mage of the Sun on a gold plate twice the thickness of the rest of the wall plates. The image showed it with a round face and b eams and flames of fire, all in one piece.\" That indeed was the golden object that the Spaniard s had seen and removed.

The account was included in his Relation (English transl ation by Sir Clemens Markham) in which he set out to glorify the royal Inca dynasty in the eyes of the Spanish. It was the firs t king of the Inca dynasty, Salcamayhua stated, who had \"ordered the smiths to make a flat plate of gold which signified that t here was a creator of heaven and earth.\" Salcamayhua illustrat ed his text with a drawing: it was the unusual and rare shape o f an oval. That first image was replaced by a round plate when a cer- tain monarch later declared the Sun supreme. It was changed back to an oval image by a subsequent Inca. \"a grea t enemy of idols; he ordered his people not to pay honors to t he Sun and Moon\": rather, to the celestial body represented by the oval shape; it was he who had \"caused images to be put a round the plate.\" Referring to the oval shape as \"The Creator,\" Salcamay- hua made it clear that it did not mean the Sun, for the images of the sun and the Moon had flanked the oval. To illus trate what he meant. Salcamayhua drew a large oval flanked by two smaller circles. The centerpiece stayed that way. with the oval as t he supe- rior image, until the time of the Inca Huascar, one of the two half brothers involved in the struggle for the thro ne when the Spaniards arrived. He removed the oval image and re placed it \"with a round plate, like the Sun with rays.\" \"Huas car Inca had placed an image of the Sun in the place where the Cr eator had been.\" Thereby, the alternating religious tenets ch anged back to a pantheon in which the Sun, not Viracocha, was sup reme.

Scholars have both agreed and disagreed regarding t he inter- pretation of the individual symbols, but not about the overall meaning of the sacred wall. Markham saw in the uppe r part \"a stellar chart which is a veritable key to the symbo lical cosmo- gony and astronomy of ancient Peru,\" and was certai n that the gabled triangular tip was a hieroglyph for \"sky.\" S .

The celestial assembly of images clearly depicts th e Sun and the Moon flanking the golden oval plate, and groups of heav- enly bodies above and below the oval. That the two flanking star symbols stand for the Sun and Moon is clarifie d by the conventional faces drawn above them plus the notati ons in the native tongue, Inti (Sun) and Quilla (Moon).

The tales describe how t his symbol alternated with the Sun in being worshiped and vene rated in Inca times. Its identity is clearly explained by a notation that reads. \"Ilia Ticci Uuiracocha, Pachac Acachi. Quier e decir ima- gen del Hacedor del cielo y de la tierra.\" Translat ed, it means \"Illa Ticci Viracocha, Maker of All; that is to say , image of the Creator of Heaven and Earth.\" But why was Viracocha depicted as an oval? One of the principal researchers of the subject, R. Leh- mann-Nitsche (Coricancha—El Templo del Sol en el Cuzc o y las Imageries de su Altar Mayor) developed the thesis t hat the oval shape represented the \"Cosmic Egg,\" a theogonic idea that is echoed in Greek legends, in Hindu religions, \"even in Genesis.\" It is \"the oldest theogony whose details have not b een grasped by white authors.\" It had been represented in the s anctuaries of the Indo-European deity Mithra as an egg surrounded by the constellations of the zodiac. \"Perhaps one day Indi anologists will see the similarities in the details and cult o f Viracocha, Brahma with the seven eyes, and the Israelite Yahweh ... In the classic antiquity and in the Orphic cult there were sacred images of the Mystic Egg; why shouldn't the same happen in the great sanctuary of Cuzco?\" Lehmann-Nitsche thought of a Cosmic Egg as the only expla- nation for the unusual use of an oval shape, for ap art from its similarity to the outline of an egg, the elliptical shape (which is difficult to draw or fashion accurately) is not fou nd naturally on the face of the Earth. But he and others seemed to ignore the fact that the elliptical shape has superimposed on it (at the bot- tom) a star symbol. If, as it seems, the elliptical or oval shape applies to one more celestial body (besides the fiv e above and four below), it spells to us the \"oval\" that is fou nd in nature— not on Earth, but in the heavens: it is the natural curve of a planet's orbit around its sun. It is, we suggest, t he orbital path of a planet in our Solar System. What the sacred wall depicted, we must conclude, wa s not distant or mysterious constellations, but our own S olar System, with the Sun, the Moon, and ten planets, adding up to a total of twelve. We see the planets of our Solar System divi ded into two groups. In our view, these are the five outer plane ts on the dis- tant side—Pluto, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupite r (count- ing from the outside inward). The lower or nearer g roup represents the four inner planets—Mars, Earth, Venu s, Mer- cury.

To the Inca s, it repre- sented the celestial Viracocha. Should we be surprised to find that this was exactl y the Su- merian view of our Solar System? As the depictions descend from the heavens toward E arth, a starry sky is shown on the wall's right and clouds on the left. Scholars agree with the original notations, \"summer \" (bright starry skies) and \"winter clouds.\" In considering t he seasons part of the creative act, the Inca depiction again follows the Near Eastern pattern. The earth's tilt (causing the seasons) was attributed in Sumer to Nibiru and in Babylon to Mard uk. The concept was echoed when the Psalmist sang of the bi blical Lord, \"Thou hast made summer and winter.\" Below \"summer\" there appears a star symbol; a fierce ani- mal is shown below \"winter.\" It is generally agreed that these images represent the constellations associated (in the southern hemisphere) with these seasons, the one for winter representing Leo (the Lion). This is amazing in more than one wa y. First, because there are no lions in South America. Second , because when the calendar was begun in Sumer in the fourth millennium B.C. the summer solstice there occurred when the Sun was seen in the zodiac constellation of the Lion (UR.GULA in Sumer- ian). But in the southern hemisphere that time of ye ar would have been winter. So that the Inca depiction borrow ed not only the idea of twelve zodiac constellations, but also their seasonal order in Mesopotamia! We now arrive at the symbols that—as in the Enuma E lish and in the Book of Genesis—transfer the tales of cre ation from the heavens to Earth: the first Man and Woman, Eden , a large river, a serpent, mountains, a sacred lake. An Inca n \"panorama of the world,\" in the words of Lehmann-Nitsche. It would be more accurate to say, the Pictorial Bible of the And es. The analogy is actual, not just figurative. The ele ments in this part of the pictorial composition could well s erve to illus- trate the Mesopotamian-biblical tales of Adam and E ve in the Garden of Eden, complete with the serpent (on the w all's right) and the Tree of Life (on the wall's left). The Sume rian E.DIN (from which Eden stems) was the valley of the great river Euphrates, emanating from the high mountains in the north. This geography is clearly depicted on the wall's ri ght, where a globe representing Earth bears the notation \"Pacha Mama\"— Mother Earth. Even the Rainbow, which featured in th e Near Eastern tales of the Deluge, is shown here.

Adhering to the erroneou s notion that the ancients conceived of the Pleiades as numb ering seven stars, some have suggested that the symbol represen ts that por- tion of the constellation Taurus. But if so, the sym bol belongs in the upper, celestial portion of the panel, not at i ts bottom. Leh- mann-Nitsche and others interpreted the seven-symbo l as \"the seven eyes of the supreme god.\" But we have already shown that the seven dots, the number seven, was the desi gnation of Earth itself in the Sumerian enumeration of the pla nets. The symbol \"seven\" is thus exactly where it belongs, as a caption for the globe of the Earth.

One possible answer is that the Incas had possessed this knowledge from time immemorial, bringing it with th em to the Andes. The other possibility is that they had heard it from others whom they met in these lands. In the absence of written records as one finds in t he ancient Near East, the choice of an answer depends to some extent on how one answers another question: Who, indeed, were the Incas?

The chroniclers related that an \"idol\" was carried during some celebrations, but it was the image of Manco Cap ac, not of a god. They also relate that on a certain holy day a priest would go to a distant mountain upon which there stood a l arge idol of a god, and would sacrifice there a llama. But the mo untain and its idol were from pre-Inca times, and the referenc e could well be to the temple of Pachacamac on the coast (regard ing which we have already written). Interestingly, the two customs are in line with bib lical com- mandments from the time of the Exodus. The prohibit ion against making and worshiping idols was included in the Ten Commandments. And on the eve of the Day of Atonement , a priest had to sacrifice a \"sin-goat\" in the desert. No one has ever pointed out that the quipos used by the Incas to re call events— strings of different colors that had to be of wool, with knots at different positions—were in make and purpose akin t o the tzit- zit, \"fringes on the corner of a blue thread,\" that the Israelites were commanded to attach to their garments as a way to re- member the Lord's commandments.

They may have adva nced overland, for they certainly left traces of their p resence at inland sites. In all probability they journeyed southward the easier way, by boats. The legends in the equatorial and northern parts of the Andes recalled not only the arrival by sea of their own ancestors (such as Naymlap), but also two separate ones by \"g iants.\" One had occurred in ancient empire times, the other in Mochica times. Cieza de Leon described the latter thus: \"The re arrived on the coast, in boats made of reeds as big as larg e ships, a party of men of such size that, from the knee downward th eir height was as great as the entire height of an ordinary ma n.\" They had metal tools with which they dug wells in the Iving rock, but for food they raided the natives' provisions. They also violated the natives' women, for there were no women among the l anding giants.

Not for ornamentation or because of vanity, but as a way to save the atmosphere of Nibiru by suspending gold dust in that planet's stratosphere. As recorded in the Sume rian texts (and related by us in The 12th Planet and subsequen t books of The Earth Chronicles), Enlil was sent to Earth to ta ke over the command when the initial extraction methods used by Enki proved unsatisfactory. This laid the groundwork for an ongoing feud between the two half brothers and their descen dants, a feud that led to Wars of the Gods; it ended with a peace treaty worked out by their sister Ninti (thereafter rename d Ninhar- sag). The inhabited Earth was divided between the w arring clans. The three sons of Enlil—Ninurta, Sin, Adad—t ogether with Sin's twin children. Shamash (the Sun) and Ish tar (Venus), were given the lands of Shem and Japhet, the lands of the Sem- ites and Indo-Europeans: Sin (the Moon) lowland Mes opota- mia; Ninurta, (\"Enlil's Warrior.\" Mars) the highlan ds of Elam and Assyria; Adad (\"The Thunderer,\" Mercury) Asia M inor (the land of the Hittites) and Lebanon. Ishtar was granted do- minion as the goddess of the Indus Valley civilizat ion; Shamash was given command of the spaceport in the Sinai pen insula. This division, which did not go uncontested, gave E nki and his sons the lands of Ham—the brown/black people—of Africa: the civilization of the Nile Valley and the gold mines of southern and western Africa—a vital and cherished p rize. A great scientist and metallurgist, Enki's Egyptian n ame was Ptah (\"The Developer\"; a title that translated into Heph aestus by the Greeks and Vulcan by the Romans). He shared the con tinent with his sons; among them was the firstborn MAR.DUK (\"Son of the Bright Mound\") whom the Egyptians called Ra, and NIN.GISH.ZI.DA (\"Lord of the Tree of Life\") whom th e Egyptians called Thoth (Hermes to the Greeks)—a god of se- cret knowledge including astronomy, mathematics, an d the building of pyramids.

One of its first explorers. Julio C.

Encompassing a vast area whose dimensions are const antly expanded as new finds are made, the Chavin Culture a ppeared to have been centered at a site called Chavin de Hua ntar. near the village of Chavin (and hence the culture's name) . It is situ- ated at an elevation of 10.000 feet in the Cordiller a Blanca range of the northwestern Andes. There, in a mounta in valley where tributaries of the Maranon river form a trian gle, an area of some 300,000 square feet was flattened and terra ced and made suitable for the construction of complex struc tures, care- fully and precisely laid out according to a preconc eived plan that took into consideration the contours and features o f the site (Fig. 91a). Not only do the buildings and plazas fo rm precise rectangulars and squares; they have also been preci sely aligned with the cardinal points, with east-west as the maj or axis. The three main buildings stood upon terraces that eleva ted them and leaned against the outer western wall that ran for some 500 feet. The wall that apparently encompassed the complex on three sides, leaving it open to the river that flowed on the east, rose to about forty feet. The largest building was at the southwest corner, m easured about 240 by 250 feet, and consisted of at least th ree floors (see an artist's bird's-eye-view reconstruction, Fig. 91 b). It was built of masonry stone blocks, well shaped but not dresse d, laid out in regular and level courses. As some remaining sla bs indicate, the walls were faced outside with smooth, marblelik e stone slabs; some still retain their incised decorations. From a terrace on the east a monumental stairway led through an im posing gate up toward the main building; the gate was flanked b y two cylin- drical columns—a most unusual feature in South Amer ica— that together with adjoining vertical stone blocks supported a thirty-foot horizontal lintel made of a single mono lith. Farther up, a double monumental stairway led to the buildin g's top. This stairway was built of perfectly cut and shaped stones that remind one of the great Egyptian pyramids.

The only plaus ible purpose that its discoverers could see was that of a religious center, a kind of ancient \"Mecca.\" This notion was strengthened by the three fascinating and most enigmatic relics found at the site. One that baffles by its complex imagery was d iscovered by Tello in the main building and is called the Tello Obelisk (Fig. 92a,b shows the front and back).

While the deity's body a nd limbs are essentially though not entirely anthropomorphic , the face is not. This face has puzzled scholars because it does not represent or stylize a local creature (such as a jaguar); rat her, it appears to be the artist's conception of what scholars conveni ently called \"a mythological animal,\" namely one of which the artis t had heard but had not actually seen. To our eyes, however, the deity's face is that of a bull—an animal completely absent in South America but one t hat fea- tured considerably in the lore and iconography of t he ancient Near East.

The image on this monolith has been the subject of much speculation; to our eyes, again, it seems to de- pict an anthropomorphized face of a bull. Does it m ean, then, that whoever erected this monument—obviously before the building was constructed, for the latter was built to accommo- date the statue—worshiped the Bull God? It was by and large the high artistic level of the artifacts rather than the complex and unusual structures that so im- pressed scholars and led them to consider Chavin th e \"matrix culture\" of north-central Peru, and to believe that the site was a religious center. But that the purpose was not reli gious but rather u t i l i t a ri a n seems to be indicated by recent finds at Chavin de Huantar. These latest excavations revealed a net work of sub- terranean tunnels hewed out of the native rock; the y honey- combed the whole site, both under built as well as unbuilt parts, and served to connect several series of underground compart- ments arranged in a chainlike manner (Fig. 95). 188 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"Cities Lost and Found 189 Figure 95 The openings of the tunnels perplexed their discove rers, for they seemed to connect the two river tributaries th at flank the site, one (due to the mountainous terrain) above it and the other in the valley below it. Some explorers have s uggested that these tunnels were so built for flood control purpo ses, to chan- nel the onrushing water from the mountains as the s nows melt and let it flow under instead of through the buildi ngs. But if there was a danger of such flooding (after heavy ra ins rather than from melting snows), why did the otherwise ing enious builders place their structures at such a vulnerabl e spot? They did so, we hold, on purpose. They ingeniously used the two levels of the tributaries to create a powerful, controlled flow of water needed for the processes that were carried out at Cha- vin de Huantar. For there, as at many other sites, such devices of flowing water were used in the panning of gold.

The artisti c skills and stone-sculpting styles are surprisingly reminis cent of the Olmec art of Mexico. The enchanting objects include a jaguar- cat receptacle, a feline-bull, an eagle-condor, a t urtle basin; a large number of vases and other objects decorated w ith glyphs created of entwined fangs—a motif decorating wall s labs as well as artifacts (Fig. 97a). There were, however, also stone slabs covered with Egyptian motifs—serpents, pyramids, th e sacred Eye of Ra (Fig. 97b).

The deities wearing the conical headdresses have fa cial fea- tures that have an \"African\" look, and having been carved on bones may represent the earliest art depictions at the site.

At all these sites carved stones by the dozens bear depictions of those people; in most instances they are shown holding some kind of tool; in many instances, the \"engi- neer\" is depicted as associated with a symbol for w aterworks (Fig. 98). At coastal sites that lead to the Chavin sites in th e moun- tains, archaeologists have found sculpted heads of clay, not stone, that must have represented Semitic visitors (Fig. 99); one was so strikingly similar to Assyrian sculptures th at the discov- erer, H.

The age of Chavin suggests that the first wave of t hese Old World, both Olmec and Semitic migrants, had arrived there circa 1500 B.C.

These events had taken place abo ut a cen- tury before the standstill of the Sun that had occu rred circa 1400 B.C.—i.e. circa 1500 B.C., the very time at which C havin de Huantar's waterworks were built.

Indeed, it was at that time, as we have already seen, that the two commingled groups of Olmecs and Semites wer e fleeing Mesoamerica. Their fate, however, was no different in the northern Andes. Besides the grotesque Semitic stone heads found at Chavin de Huantar, depictions of mutilated negroid bodies are found in the whole area, and especially at Sechin. Thus it was, after some 1,000 years in the northern Andes and almost 2,000 years in Mesoamerica, that the Afr ican-Se- mitic presence had come to a tragic end. Although some of the Africans may have gone farther south, as finds at Tiahuanacu attest, the African-Semitic extension into the Andes from Mesoamerica appears to have not gone beyond the Chavin-culture area. The tales of the giants st ricken by di- vine hand may hold more than a kernel of fact; for it is quite possible that there, in the northern Andes, two rea lms of two gods had met, with an unseen boundary between juris dictions and human subordinates. We say this because, in that very zone, other white men had been present.

Is it possible that people from those distant lands had crossed the Pacific and come to the Andes in prehistoric ti mes? The link that evidently existed is confirmed by depictions i llustrating the feats of an ancient Near Eastern hero whose tales w ere told and retold. He was Gilgamesh, ruler of Uruk (the biblic al Erech) who had reigned circa 2900 B.C.; he went in search of the hero of the Deluge story whom the gods had granted (acco rding to the Mesopotamian version) immortality.

The traditional landing site for that arrival has been the peninsula of Santa El ena (now Ecuador) which, with its nearby La Plata island, ju ts out into the Pacific. Archaeological excavations have confir med early settlements there, beginning with what is called a Valdivian Phase circa 2500 B.C. Among the finds reported by the re- nowned Ecuadorian archaeologist Emilio Estrada (Ult imas Ci- vilizaciones Pre-Historicas) were stone statuettes with the same straight-nose features (Fig. 102a) as well as a sym bol on pottery (Fig. 102b) that was the Hittite hieroglyph for \"go ds\" (Fig. 102c).

Pa rdo has pointed out in a study devoted to the site (Los Gra ndes Mono- litos de Sayhuiti) the name means in the native ton gue \"Trun- cated Pyramid.\" The site is known for its several monoliths and esp ecially one called the Great Monolith. The name is appropriate since this huge rock, which from a distance appears as an imme nse bright egg resting on the hillside, measures about fourtee n by ten by nine feet. While its bottom part has been carefully shaped as half an ovoid, the upper part has been carved out t o represent in all probability a scale model of some unknown area. Discernible are miniature walls, platforms, stairways, channels , tunnels, rivers, canals; diverse structures, some representi ng edifices with niches and steps between them; images of vario us animals indigenous to Peru; and human figures of what look like war- riors and, some say, gods. Some see in this scale model a religious artifact, honoring the deities that they discern upon it. Others believe i t represents a section of Peru that encompasses three districts, e xtending to the south to Lake Titicaca (which they identify wit h a lake carved on the stone) and the very ancient site of T iahuanaco. Was this, then, a map carved in stone—or perhaps a scale model of a grand artificer who planned the layout a nd structures to be erected? The answer may lie in the fact that, winding throug h this scale model, are grooves, an inch to two inches wid e. They all originate in a \"dish\" located at the monolith's hig hest point and slope down, winding and zigzagging, to the lowest e dge of the sculptured model, reaching there round discharge ho les.

There are more of these sites around Cuzco-Sacsahua man, all along the Sacred Valley and reaching to the sou theast, where a lake bears the name Golden Lake. A site named Tor ontoy includes among its precisely cut, megalithic stone blocks one that has thirty-two angles. Some fifty miles from Cu zco, near Torontoy, an artificial waterflow was made to casca de between two walls and over fifty-four \"steps,\" all cut out of the living rock; significantly, the site is called Cori-Huairac hina, \"Where Gold is Purified.\" Cuzco meant \"The Navel\" and indeed Sacsahuaman appea rs to have been the largest, most colossal and central of all these sites. One aspect of this centrality may be evidenc ed by a place called Pampa de Anta, some ten miles west of Sacsah uaman. There, the sheer rock has been carved into a series of steps that form a large crescent (hence the rock's name Quilla rumi, \"Moon Stone\"). Since there is nothing to view from there ex- cept the eastern skies, Rolf Muller (Sonne, Mond und Steiner uber dem Reich der Inka) concluded that it was some kind of observatory, situated so as to reflect astronomical data to the promontory at Sacsahuaman. But what was Sacsahuaman itself, now that the notion of its having been built by the Incas as a fortress is com pletely dis- credited? The perplexing labyrinthine channels and other seem- ingly haphazard cutouts into which the natural rock s were shaped begin to make sense as a result of new archa eological excavations begun several years ago. Though far fro m uncover- ing more than a small part of the extensive stone s tructures in the plateau that extends behind the smooth Rodadero rock, they have already revealed two major aspects of the site. One is the fact that walls, conduits, receptacles, channel s, and the like have been created both out of the living rock and w ith the aid of perfectly shaped large ashlars, many of the polygon al kind of the Megalithic Age, to form a series of water-chann eling struc- tures one above the other; rain or spring waters co uld thus be made to flow in a regulated manner from level to le vel. The other aspect is the uncovering of a huge circul ar area enclosed by megalithic ashlars, that by all opinion s served as a reservoir. Also uncovered was a sluice-chamber buil t of mega- lithic ashlars, that lies underground at a level pe rmitting the running off of the water from the circular reservoi r.

The water was finally flowed off through the sluice -chamber. and out and away through the labyrinth. In the ston e vats, what remained was gold. What then did the megalithic, colossal zigzagging w alls, at the edge of the promontory, protect or support? To this question there is still no clear answer, except to surmise t hat some kind of massive platform was required for the vehicles—airb orne, we must presume—that were used to haul in the ores and take away the nuggets. One site that may have served, or was intended to s erve, a similar transportation function, located some sixty miles north- west of Sacsahuaman, is Ollantaytambu. The archaeol ogical re- mains are atop a steep mountain spur; they overlook an opening between the mountains that rise where the Urubamba- Vilca- nota and Patcancha rivers meet. A village that gave its name to the ruins is situated at the bottom of the mountain ; the name, meaning \"Restplace of Ollantay,\" stems from the time an Inca hero prepared there a stand against the Spaniards. Several hundred stone steps of crude construction c onnect a series of terraces of Inca make and lead to the pri ncipal ruins on the summit. There, in what has been presumed to hav e served as a fortress, there are indeed remains of Inca-wal led structures built of fieldstones.

One must therefore wonder how scholars can continue to attribute these remains to the Incas, who did not p ossess any metal except gold, which is too soft and thus total ly unsuitable to hold together colossal stone blocks shaken by an earthquake.

And all that, with out iron tools? More serious is the explanation for the row of six monoliths that they were part of a planned retaining wall, pr obably to support a large platform atop the mountain. If so, the size and the massivity of the stone blocks bring to mind the colossal stone blocks used to construct the unique platform at Baalbek, in the Lebanon mountains. In The Stairway to Heaven we de- scribed and examined at length that megalithic plat form, and concluded that it was the \"landing place\" that had been the first destination of Gilgamesh—a landing place for the \"a erial ships\" of the Anunnaki. The many similarities we find between Ollantaytambu and Baalbek include the origin of the megaliths. The col ossal stone blocks of Baalbek were quarried miles away in a vall ey, then incredibly lifted, transported, and put in place to fit with other stones of the platform. At Ollantaytambu too the gi ant stone blocks were quarried on the mountainside on the opp osite side of the valley. The heavy blocks of red granite, aft er they had been quarried, hewed, and shaped, were then transpo rted from the mountainside, across two streams, and up the OU antay- tambu site; then carefully raised, put precisely in place, and finally fused together. Whose handiwork was Ollantaytambu? Garcilaso de la Vega wrote that it was \"from the very first epoch, befor e the Incas.\" Blas Valera stated, \"from an era that anteceded the epoch of the Incas... the era of the pantheon of the gods of pre -Inca times.\" It is time that modern scholars agree. It is also time to realize that these gods were the same deities to whom the construction of Baalbek has been attribu ted by Near Eastern legends. Was OUantaytambu intended to be a stronghold, as Sa csa- huaman might have been, or a landing place, as Baalb ek had been? In our previous books we have shown that, in determ ining the site of their spaceport and \"landing places,\" t he Anunnaki first anchored a landing corridor on some outstandi ng geograph- ical feature (such as Mount Ararat). The flight pat h within this corridor was then inclined at a precise 45 degrees to the equa- tor. In postdiluvial times, when the spaceport was in the Sinai peninsula and the landing place for airborne craft at Baalbek, the grid followed the same pattern.

If one draws on a map of the region a line connecting the legend- ary stops made by Viracocha from the Island of the Sun in Lake Titicaca, the line will pass Cuzco and continue to O llantay- tambu—precisely at a 45 degree angle to the equator ! A series of studies and lectures by Maria Schulten de D'Eb- neth, summed up in her book La Ruta de Wirakocha, sh owed that the 45 degree line on which Machu Picchu is lo cated fits a grid pattern along the sides of a square tilted at 45 degrees (so that the corners, not the sides, point toward the c ardinal points).

If this be fiction, then it is supported by fact; for it is on the shores of Lake Titicaca that the first and greatest city i n all of the Americas had stood. Its scope, the size of its monoliths, the intricate carvings upon its monuments and its statues have amazed all who have seen Tiahuanacu (as the place has been called) ever since the first chronicler described it for Europeans. Everyo ne equally wondered who had built this unique city and how, an d puzzled over its untold antiquity. Yet the greatest puzzle of all is the location itself: a barren, almost lifeless place so me 13,000 feet —four kilometers!—up among the highest Andean peaks that are permanently snow-covered. Why would anyone expe nd in- credible effort to erect colossal edifices out of s tone that had to be quarried and brought over from many miles away i n this treeless, windswept desolate place? The thought struck Ephraim George Squier when he re ached the lake a century ago. \"The islands and promontori es of Lake Titicaca,\" he wrote (Peru Illustrated) \"are for the most part bar- ren. The waters hide a variety of strange fishes, w hich contrib- ute to support a population necessarily scanty in a region where barley will not ripen except under very favorable c ircumstances, and where maize, in its most dimunitive size, has i ts most pre- carious development; where the potato, shrunk to it s smallest proportions, is bitter; where the only grain is the quinoa; and where the only indigenous animals fit for food are the biscacha, the llama, and the vicuna.\" Yet in this treeless wo rld, he added, \"if tradition be our guide, were developed the germ s of Inca 206"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"\"Baalbek of the New World\" 207 civilization\" from an earlier, \"original civilizati on which carved its memorials in massive stones, and left them on t he plain of Tiahuanaco, and of which no tradition remains excep t that they are the work of the giants of old, who reared them in a single night.\" A different thought, however, struck him as he clim bed up a promontory overlooking the lake and the ancient sit e. Was it perhaps because of the isolation, because of the su rrounding peaks, because of the vista between the peaks, that the place had been chosen? From a ridge at the southwestern e dge of the plain in which the lake is situated, near where its waters flow out southward through the Desaguadero river, he cou ld see not only the lake with its southern peninsulas and isla nds, but also the snowy peaks to the east. \"Here,\" he wrote with words accompanying a sketch h e had made, \"the great snowy chain of the Andes burst on our sight in all its majesty. Dominating the lake is the massive bulk of Illampu, or So rata, the crown of the continent, th e highest mountain of America, rivaling, if not equaling in h eight, the monarchs of the Himalayas; observers vary in their estimates and calculations of its altitude from 25,000 to 27, 000 feet.\" Southward from this outstanding landmark the uninte rrupted chain of mountains and peaks \"terminates in the gre at mountain of Illimani, 24,500 feet in altitude.\" Between the w estern ridge at whose edge Squier had stood and the gigantic mou ntains to the east, lay the flat depression that was occupied by the lake and its southern shores. \"Nowhere else in the world , perhaps,'\" Squier went on, \"can a panorama so diversified and grand be obtained from a single point of view. The whole gre at tableland of Peru and Bolivia, at its widest part, with its ow n system of waters, its own rivers and lakes, its own plains an d mountains, all framed in by the ranges of the Cordilleras and t he Andes, is presented like a map\" (Fig. 109). Were these geographical and topographical features the very reason for the selection of the site—at the edge of a great plain basin, with two peaks that stand out not only from the ground but also from the skies—just as the twin peaks of A rarat (17,000 and 13,000 feet) and the two pyramids of Gi za had served to mark the landing paths of the Anunnaki? Unbeknown to Squier, he had raised the analogy, for he had titled the chapter describing the ancient ruins \"Ti ahuanaco, the Baalbec of the New World\"; for that was the only com parison he could think of—a comparison with a place that we have identified as the landing place of the Anunnaki to which Gilga- mesh had set his steps five thousand years ago."},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"Figure 109 The greatest explorer of Tiahuanacu and its ruins t his cen- tury has been, without doubt, Arthur Posnansky, a E uropean engineer who moved to Bolivia and devoted his lifet ime to un- raveling the mysteries of these ruins.

Yet, the little that remained—mos tly because 208 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"\"Baalbek of the New World\" 209 it was too massive to move—impressed him that these were remains of a civilization that disappeared before t hat of the Incas began, a civilization contemporary with that of Egypt and the Near East. The remains indicate that the struct ures and the monuments were the work of a people who were capabl e of a unique, perfect, and harmonious architecture—yet on e that \"had no infancy and passed through no period of gro wth.\" No wonder, then, that the wondering Indians had told t he Span- iards that these artifacts were raised overnight by giants- Pedro de Cieza de Leon, who traveled throughout what is now Peru and Bolivia in the years 1532-1550. reporte d in his Chronicles that, without doubt, the ruins of Tiahuan acu were \"the most ancient place of any that I have yet desc ribed.\" Among the edifices that amazed him was a \"hill made by the hands of men, on a great foundation of stone\" that measured more than 900 feet by 400 feet at its base and rose some 120 feet. Beyond it he saw \"two stone idols, of the huma n shape and figure, the features very skillfully carved, so tha t they appear to have been done by the hand of some great master. Th ey are so large that they seem like small giants, and it is c lear that they have the sort of clothing different from those now worn by the natives of these parts; they seem to have some orna ment on their heads.\" Nearby he saw the remains of another building, and of a wall \"very well built.\" It all looked very ancient and w orn. In an- other part of the ruins he saw \"stones of such enor mous size that it causes wonder to think of them, and to reflect h ow human force can have sufficed to move them to the place w here we see them, being so large. Many of these stones are carv ed in differ- ent ways, some of them having the shape of a human body, which must have been their idols.\" He noticed near the wall and the large stone blocks \"many holes and hollow places in the ground,\" which puzzl ed him. More to the west he saw other ancient remains, \"amo ng them many doorways, with their jambs, lintels and thresh olds all in one stone.\" He wondered most particularly that \"fro m these great doorways there came out still larger stones u pon which the doorways were formed, some of them-thirty feet broa d, fifteen or more long and six in thickness. The whole of thi s,\" he re- ported with utter amazement—the doorway and its jam bs and lintel—\"were one single stone.\" He added that \"the work is one of grandeur and magnificence, when all considered,\" and that \"for myself I fail to understand with what instrume nts or tools it can have been done, for it is very certain that bef ore these great stones could be brought to perfection and left as w e see them."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Figure 110 the tools must have been much better than those now used by the Indians.\" Of all the artifacts seen by the first Spaniards to arrive on the scene, so sincerely described by Cieza de Leon, thes e colossal one-piece gateways still lie where they had fallen.

These stone blocks, some measuring twelve by ten feet and almost two fe et thick, are covered with indentations, grooves, precise ang les and sur- faces that have varying levels. At certain points t he blocks have indentations (Fig. 112) that were certainly intende d to hold metal clamps, to attach each vertical section to th ose adjoining it—a technical \"gimmick\" that we had seen at Ollant aytambu. But whereas there the suggestion was that the clamps were made of gold (the only metal known to the Incas)—an unten- able suggestion because of the softness of gold—her e the clamps were made of bronze. That this was so is kno wn because some of these bronze clamps have actually been foun d. This is certainly a discovery of immense significance, for bronze is a most difficult alloy to produce, requiring the comb ination of a certain proportion of copper (about 85-90 percent) with tin; and whereas copper can be found in its natural stat e, tin must be extracted by difficult metallurgical processes from the ores in which it is contained. How was this bronze obtained, and was its availabil ity not only part of the puzzle but also a clue to the answ ers?

But this leaves open and even reinforces the question, what was goi ng on at Puma-Punku? What did it import and what products di d it ship out at this barren altitude? Ongoing excavations at Puma-Punku have uncovered a series of semisubterranean enclosures constructed o f perfectly shaped stone blocks. They remind one of the sunken plazas of Chavin de Huantar, and raise the possibility that th ese were elements—reservoirs, pools, sluice-chambers—of a si milar wa- terworks system. More answers may lie in the most puzzling (if that is still possible) finds at the site: blocks of stone, compl ete by them- selves or undoubtedly broken off from larger blocks , that have been shaped, angled, cut, and grooved in an astonis hing way with an astounding precision and with tools that ar e hard to find even today. The best way to describe these technolo gical mira- cles is to show some of them (Fig. 113). There is absolutely no plausible explanation for th ese arti- facts except to suggest—based on our own present te chnology —that these were matrixes, dies for the casting of intricate metal parts; parts for some complex and sophisticat ed equip- ment that Man in the Andes, or for that matter anyw here else, was absolutely incapable of possessing in pre-Inca times. Various archaeologists and researchers had come to Tia- huanacu since the 1930s for brief or sustained work —Wendell C. Bennett, Thor Heyerdahl, and Carlos Ponce Sangines are names best recognized; but by and large, they only used, built upon, accepted, or argued with the conclusions of A rthur Pos- nansky, who first presented his extraordinary work and insights in the 1914 extensive volumes of Una Metropoli Preh istorica en la America del Sur and, after another three decades of devoted research, in the four-volumed Tihuanacu—Cuna del Hom bre de las Americas, combined with an English translation (in 1945). This edition was honored with an official forword b y the Bolivian government (the site ended up in the Bolivia n part of the lake after its partition from Peru), and celebr ated \"the 12.000th year of Tiahuanacu.\" For this, when all was said and done, was the most astound- ing (and controversial) conclusion of Posnansky: Th at Tiahua-"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"Figure 113 nacu was millennia old; that its first phase was bu ilt when the level of the lake was about one hundred feet higher and before the whole area had been engulfed by an avalanche of water— perhaps the famous Great Flood, thousands of years before the Christian era. Combining the archaeological discove ries with geological studies, study of flora and fauna, measu rements of skulls found in tombs and portrayed in stone heads, and bring- ing to bear every facet of his engineering and tech nological ex- pertise, Posnansky concluded that there had been th ree phases in the history of Tiahuanacu; that it was settled b y two races— first the Mongoloid people, then Middle Eastern Cau casians— and at no time by the negroid people; and that the place had undergone two catastrophes, first a natural one by an avalanche of water, and then another sudden upheaval of unkno wn na- ture.

While some of the sections he pointed to as potentially holding addit ional remains and artifacts were indeed excavated and profitably so, the main interest was and remains on three major components of the site. The one at the southeastern part of the ruins is a hill known as the Akapana. It was probably given originally th e shape of a stage-pyramid, and is presumed to have acted as the fortress guarding the site; the principal reason for that as sumption being the fact that at the top of this pyramid-hill the c enter was exca- vated to form an oval, lined with ashlars, that act ed as a water reservoir. The presumption was that it was intended to collect rainwater and provide the defenders with water as t hey fell back to this stronghold. Rumors however persisted that it was a place where gold was hidden, and in the eighteenth centur y a Span- iard named Oyaldeburo was given a mining concession for the Akapana. He cut through the eastern side of the hil l to drain off the water, searched the bottom of the reservoir, to re down structures of beautiful ashlars, and dug deep into the hill wher- ever he found channels and conduits. The destruction nevertheless revealed that the Akap ana was not a natural hill but a very complex structure.

The complex inner workings of the Akapana wer e so built as to lead the water from one level inside the Akap ana to an- other lower one in alternating vertical and horizon tal sections, a vertical height of fifty feet but, because of the z igzagging, cover- ing a far larger distance. In the end. some feet be low the bottom of the Akapana. the water flowed through a stone ou tlet into the artificial canal (or moat), some 100 feet wide, that encircled the whole site. It led from there to wharfs at the site's north and thence to the lake. Now, if the purpose were just t o drain off excess water to prevent overflow after heavy downpo urs, a sim- ple straight inclined pipe (as was found at Tula) w ould have sufficed. But here we have angled channels, built wi th dressed stones fitted with great ingenuity to regulate the water's flow from one inner level to another. And this indicates to us a pro- cessing technique—the use of flowing water for wash ing ores, perhaps? That some processing might have taken place in the Aka- pana is further suggested by the discovery on the s urface and in the soil removed from the \"reservoir\" of large quan tities of dark-green rounded \"pebbles\" that range in size fro m three- fourths of an inch to two inches. Posnansky determi ned that they are crystalline, but neither he nor others (to our knowl- edge) conducted further tests to determine the natu re and origin of these globular objects. A structure more to the center of the site (\"K\" on Pos- nansky's map) had so many subterranean and semisubt erranean features that Posnansky thought it might represent a section set aside for tombs. All around there were sections of stone blocks cut to act as water conduits: they were in a state of disarray that Posnansky blamed not only on treasure hunters but a lso on a previous team of explorers, under Count Crequi de Mon tfort, who during their excavations in 1903 wantonly dug u p remains, broke whatever stood in their way (according to Pos nansky), and carried off many artifacts. The report on the d iscoveries and conclusions of this French expedition was given in a book by George Courty and in a lecture to the 1908 Internati onal Con- gress of Americanists by Manuel Gonzales de la Rosa. The es- sence of their findings was that \"there were two Ti ahuanacos,\" one the visible ruins, the other subterranean and i nvisible.

This,\" he noted, \"is the first and only time that we find the use of lime in a prehistoric American construct ion.\" What went on in these subterranean chambers and why they were so specifically built, he could not tell. Perh aps they held treasure, but that, he pointed out, would have long disappeared by the hand of treasure seekers. Indeed, no sooner had he un- covered some of these chambers than \"the place was stripped and robbed by the iconoclastic half-breeds of moder n Tihua- nacu.\" Apart from what he excavated or saw strewn a bout at the site, large quantities of stone conduits—pieces of all shapes, sizes and diameters—could be seen in the nearby chu rch and in the bridges and culverts of the modern railroad and even in use in La Paz. The indications were of extensive ground and under- ground waterworks at Tiahuanacu; and Posnansky devo ted to them a whole chapter in his ultimate work, titled H ydraulic Works in Tihuanacu. Recent excavations have uncovere d more stone conduits and water channels, confirming the c onclusions of Posnansky. The second outstanding edifice at Tiahuanacu needed the least excavating, for it stands there majestically for all to see—a colossal stone gateway that rises above the flatnes s of the site like an Arc de Triomphe with no one to parade throu gh it, no one to watch and cheer (Fig. 116, front and back).

There is general agreement that the central and dom inant figure is that of Viracocha, holding a scepter or w eapon in the right hand and a forked lightning in the other (Fig . 118). This image appears on vases, textiles, and artifacts in southern Peru and adjoining lands, indicating the extent to which what scholars call the Tiahuanacu culture had spread. Fl anking this god are winged attendants, arranged in three horizo ntal rows, eight to a row on each side of the central figure. Posnansky pointed out that only the first five on each side i n each row are carved in the same pronounced relief as the deity; the others on the extremes are carved faintly, as an afterthought . He drew the central figure, the meander under it, a nd the fifteen original spaces on each side (Fig. 119) and concluded that this was a calendar of a twelve-month year, be ginning at the spring equinox (September in the southern hemispher e); and that the central large figure, showing the deity in full body, rep- resented that month and its equinox. Since the \"equ inox\" de- notes that time of the year when day and night are equal, he surmised that the segment right under the central f igure, which is in the center of the meandering row, stands for the other 218 THE LOST REALMS"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"Figure 118 equinox month, March. He then assigned the remainin g months in succession to the other segments within the mean der. Point- ing out that the two end segments show a bugler tog ether with the deity's head, he suggested that these were the two extreme months when the Sun moves farthest away, the solsti ce months of June and December, when the priests would sound the bugle to call the sun back. The Gate of the Sun, in other words, was a calendar in stone. The calendar, Posnansky surmised, was a solar calen dar. Not only was it geared to the spring equinox when it be gan, but it also marked the other equinox and the solstices. It was a calen- dar of eleven months of thirty days each (the numbe r of winged attendants above the meander) plus a \"great month\" of thirty- five days, the Month of Viracocha, making up a sola r year of 365 days. He should have mentioned that a twelve-month solar year beginning at the spring equinox was a Near Eastern calendar begun in Sumer, at Nippur, circa 3800 B.C.

He determined that circles and ovals depicted in a variety of ways and colors represented the Sun, Moon, planets, comets, and other celestial objects (Fig. 120a), that the b ond between Earth and Heaven (Fig. 120b) was frequently express ed, and that the dominant symbols were the cross and the st airway signs (Fig. 120c, d). He saw in the latter, the Stairway, the \"trade- mark\" of Tiahuanacu, its monuments and its ultimate civiliza- tion—the source from which this symbol, he believed , spread throughout the Americas. He acknowledged that it wa s a glyph based on the Mesopotamian ziggurats, but noted that he did not think therefore that there had been Sumerians at Ti ahuanacu. All that reinforced his growing sense that the Gate of the Sun was part of a larger structural complex at Tiah uanacu whose purpose and function was to serve as an obser vatory; and this guided him in his most important and. as it tu rned out, most controversial work and conclusions. Official records of the Commission for the Destructi on and Expiation of Idolatry, established by the Spaniards for that clear purpose (although some suspect it was also a cover for treasure hunting), attest that the commission's men arrived in Tiahua- nacu in 1625. A 1621 report by Father Joseph de Arr iaga listed over 5.000 \"objects of idolatry\" that were oblitera ted by break-"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"Baalbek of the New World\" 221 ing, melting, or burning. What they did at Tiahuana cu is not known. The Gate of the Sun, as early photographs sh ow, was found in the nineteenth century standing broken in two at the top, with the right-hand part leaning dangerously a gainst the other half. When and by whom it was straightened out and put ba ck together is a mystery. How it was broken in two is also un- known. Posnansky did not think it was the handiwork of the Commission; rather, he thinks that this gate escaped their wrath because it had fallen and was covered by soil and t hus hidden from sight when the Commission's zealots arrived. Si nce it was apparently reerected, some have wondered whether it was put back in its original place; the reason being the re alization that the gate was not, originally, a solitary edifice st anding alone in the large plain, but was part of the huge structure just east of it. The shape and size of that structure, called the Ka lasasaya, was delineated by a series of vertical stone pillars (w hich is what the name meant, \"The Standing Pillars\"), revealing a so mewhat rectangular enclosure measuring about 450 by 400 fe et. Since the axis of this structure appeared to be east-west , some won- dered whether the gate should not have stood in the center rather than in the northern edge of the enclosure's western wall (as it now does). Whereas before only the great weight of the monolit hic gate argued against notions of its having been moved alm ost two hundred feet, it is now clear from archaeological e vidence that it probably stands where it belonged, for the center o f the western wall was taken up by a terrace whose own center was aligned with the east-west axis of the Kalasasaya. Posnansk y found along this axis various stones especially carved to permit astro- nomical observations; and his conclusion that the K alasasaya was an ingenious celestial observatory is now accep ted as a mat- ter of fact. The most obvious archaeological remains of the Kala sasaya have been the standing pillars that formed a slight ly rectangular enclosure. Though not all of the pillars that once had acted as anchors for a continuous wall are still there, thei r count hints at an association with the number of days in a solar y ear and in a lunar month. Of particular interest to Posnansky we re eleven pillars (Fig. 121) erected alongside the terrace pr otruding from the center of the western wall.

The p rincipal monumental stairway was in the center of the easter n wall, the principal observation points were in the centers of the two wider terraces that completed the \"pyramid\" on the west ( Fig. 122). It was on this point that Posnansky made his most s tartling discovery with the explosive ramifications. By measu ring the distance and angles between the two solstice points , he realized that the obliquity of the Earth against the Sun on which the astronomical aspects of the Kalasasaya were based d id not con- form to the 23.5 degrees of our present era.

Based on the formulas determi ned by as- tronomers at the International Conference of Ephemer ides in Paris in 1911, which takes into account the geograp hical position and elevation of the site, this meant that the Kala sasaya was built circa 15,000 B.C.!

The latter changes the stellar background (constell ation of stars) against which the Sun rises or acts at a certain ti me, such as the spring equinox; the change, though small, adds up t o 1 degree in seventy-two years and to 30 degrees (a full zodi ac house) in \"Baalbek of the New World\" 223"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":"224 THE LOST REALMS 2,160 years. The obliquity changes result from the almost im- perceptible roll of the Earth as that of a ship, ra ising and lower- ing the horizon. This change in the angle at which the Earth is inclined against the Sun may amount to 1 degree in about 7,000 years. Intrigued by the findings of Posnansky, the German Astro- nomical Commission sent an expedition to Peru and Bol ivia; its members were Professor Dr. Hans Ludendorff, Directo r of the Astronomical and Astrophysical Observatory at Potsd am, Pro- fessor Dr. Arnold Kohlschutter, Director of the Ast ronomical Observatory in Bonn and the honorary astronomer of t he Vati- can, and Dr. Rolf Muller, an astronomer from the Pot sdam ob- servatory. They made measurements and observations at Tiahuanacu between November 1926 and June 1928. Their investigations, measurements, and visual obse rvations confirmed, first of all, that the Kalasasaya was in deed an astro- nomical-calendrical observatory. They found, for ex ample, that the western terrace with the eleven pillars along i t, due to the width of the pillars, the distances between them, a nd their posi- tions, enabled precise measurements of the Sun's se asonal movements that had taken into account the slightly different number of days from solstice to equinox to solstice and back. Their studies, moreover, confirmed that on the most contro- versial point Posnansky was essentially correct: th e obliquity on which the astronomical features of the Kalasasaya w ere based did indeed differ substantially from the obliquity' s angle in our time. Based on data that presumably throws light on the obli- quity observed in ancient China and Greece, astronom ers are confident about the applicable curve of the up-and- down mo- tion only to a few thousand years back. The astrono mical team concluded that the results could indeed indicate a date circa 15,000 B.C., but also one of 9300 B . C . depending on the curve used. Needless to say. even the latter date was simply un acceptable to the scientific community. Yielding to the critic ism. Rolf Muller conducted further studies in Peru and Bolivia , teaming up with Posnansky at Tiahuanacu. They found that re sults would change if certain variants were considered. F irst, if the observation of the solstice points were to be not f rom where Posnansky had assumed but from a different possible point, the angle between the solstice extremities (and thus th e obliquity) would be slightly different: also, one could not sa y with any knowledge whether the ancient astronomers fixed the moment of solstice when the Sun was above the horizon line , in its midst or had just sunk below it. With all these variants, Muller pub-"},{"pageNumber":226,"pageContent":"\"Baalbek of the New World\" 225 lished a definite report in the leading scientific journal Baesseler Archiv (vol. 14) in which he stated all the alterna tives and con- cluded that if the angle of 24° 6' is to be accepte d as the most accurate, the obliquity curve would cross this read ing at either 10,000 B.C. or 4000 B.C. Posnansky was invited to address the Twenty-Third I nterna- tional Congress of Americanists on the subject. He accepted the correct angle of obliquity to be 24° 6' 52.8\", whic h left a choice between 10,150 B . C . and 4050 B.C. Conceding that this was \"thorny material,\" he left the matter hanging by ag reeing that it needs further study. Such studies have indeed been conducted, even if no t di- rectly at Tiahuanacu. We have already mentioned tha t the cal- endar of the Incas indicated a Beginning in the Age of the Bull, not of Aries (the Ram). Muller himself, as we mentio ned ear- lier, arrived at 4000 B.C. as the approximate age of the mega- l i t h i c remains in Cuzco and Machu Picchu. And we hav e also referred to the research, along totally different l ines of investi- gation, by Maria Schulten de D'Ebneth which led her to con- clude that the Grid of Viracocha conformed to an ob liquity of 24° 8' and thus to the date 3172 B . C . (by her calculations). As the artifacts bearing the image of Viracocha—on textiles, on mummy wrappings, on pottery—were increasingly di scov- ered all over southern Peru and even farther north and south, comparisons with other non-Tiahuanacu data could be made. Based on that, even such stubborn archaeologists as Wendell C. Bennett kept pushing the age of Tiahuanacu back, fro m the middle of the first millennium AD . to almost the beginning of the first millennium B.C. Radiocarbon datings, however, take the generally acc epted dates farther and farther back. Beginning in the 196 0s CIAT, the Bolivian Centro de Investigaciones Arqueologicas en T iwan- aku, has conducted systematic excavations and prese rvation work at the site. Its first major undertaking was t he complete excavation and restoration of the sunken \"small tem ple\" east of the Kalasasaya, where a number of stone statues and stone heads were found. It uncovered a semisubterrenean c ourtyard, perhaps for ritual offerings, that was surrounded b y a stone wall in which stone heads were stuck—in the manner of Cha vin de Huantar. The official 1981 report by Carlos Ponce Sa ngines, Director of Bolivia's National Archaeological Instit ute (De- scription Sumaria del Templete Semisubterraneo de T iwanaku), states that samples of organic matter found at this location gave radiocarbon readings of 1580 B . C ; as a result, Ponce Sangines, in his comprehensive study Panorama de la Arqueolog ia Boli-"},{"pageNumber":227,"pageContent":"226 THE LOST REALMS viana, considered that time as the beginning of the Old Phase of Tiahuanacu. Such radiocarbon dates indicate the age of the orga nic re- mains found at sites, but do not preclude an older age for the stone structures making up the site. Indeed, Ponce Sangines himself revealed in a subsequent study (Tiwanaku: S pace, Time and Culture) that new dating techniques called Obsid ian Hydra- tion gave the earlier date 2134 B . C . for obsidian objects found at the Kalasasaya. In this connection it is intriguing to read in the writings of Juan de Betanzos (Suma y Narration de los Incas, 155 1) that when Tiahuanacu was first settled under the chief c alled Con- Tici Viracocha, \"he had with him a certain number o f people ... And after he had come out of the lagoon he went to a place near it. where today stands a village called Tiagua naco. They say,\" Betanzos continued, \"that once, when the peopl e of Con- Tici Viracocha were already settled there, there wa s darkness in the land.\" But Viracocha \"ordered the Sun to move in the course in which it now moves; abruptly, he made the Sun begin the day.\" The darkness resulting from the Sun's standstill an d the \"be- ginning of the day\" when the motion resumed is undo ubtedly a recollection of the same event that we had placed, on both sides of the Earth, circa 1400 B.C. Gods and men, accordin g to Be- tanzos's record of local lore, were already at Tiah uanacu from earlier times—perhaps as early as the archaeoastron omical data indicates? But why was Tiahuanacu established, at this site, at that early time? In recent years archaeologists have found similar a rchitec- tural features between Teotihuacan in Mexico and Ti ahuanacu in Bolivia. Jose de Mesa and Teresa Gisbert (Akapana , la Pira- mide de Tiwanacu) have pointed out that the Akapana had a ground plan (square with protruding accessway) like the Pyra- mid of the Moon in Teotihuacan, about the same base measure- ments as this pyramid, and the same height (about f ifty feet) as the first state of the Pyramid of the Sun and its h eight-to-width ratio. In view of our own conclusions that the orig inal (and practical) purpose of Teotihuacan and its edifices was expressed by the site's waterworks, within and alongside the two pyra- mids, the water channels inside the Akapana and thr oughout Tiahuanacu assume a central role. Was Tiahuanacu es tablished where it was as a processing facility? And if so, o f what?

At the edge of the lake, where Kiss had envisioned a quay, they see archaeological evidence for massive retaining walls that, built in a meander, created actual deep-water piers at which boats laden with cargo could tie up. But if so, what did Tiahua nacu import and what did it export? Ibarra Grasso reported the discovery of the \"small green pebbles\" that Posnansky had found on the Akapana, e lsewhere in Tiahuanacu: in the ruins of a small Akapana-like pyramid to the south, where the boulders that served to retain it had turned green; in the area of the subterranean structures w est of the Kalasasaya; and in very large quantities among the ruins of Puma-Punku. Significantly, the boulders in the retaining walls in the piers of Puma-Punku have also turned green. That can mean only one thing: exposure to copper, for it is oxidized coppe r that gives stone and soil their greenish color (just as the pr esence of oxi- dized iron lends a red-brown hue). Was copper, then, processed at Tiahuanacu? Probably , but then, this could have been done more reasonably at some less forbidding place and closer to copper sources. Coppe r, it would appear, was brought to Tiahuanacu, not carried away from it. What Tiahuanacu was the source of should have been clear from the very meaning of the name of its location: Titicaca. The name of the lake comes from that of one of two isla nds that lie just off the Copacabana peninsula. It was there, on the island called Titicaca, the legends tell, that the rays of the Sun had struck Titikalla, the sacred rock, as soon as the S un appeared after the Deluge. (It is therefore also known as Is land of the Sun.) It was there, at the sacred rock, that Viraco cha granted the divine wand to Manco Capac. And what do all these names mean? Titi in the Aymar a lan- guage was the name of a metal—either lead or tin, a ccording to linguists. Titikalla, we suggest, meant the \"Rock of Tin.\" Titi caca meant \"Stone of Tin.\" And Lake Titicaca was the lak e that was the source of tin.

All three, thus, had come fr om lands associated with mining. In asking these detailed questions Job (or the auth or of the Book of Job) displayed considerable knowledge of min eralogy, mining, and metallurgical processes. His time is ce rtainly long after Man's first use of copper by hammering lumps of native copper into useful shapes and well into the period when metals were obtained by mining ores that had to be smelted , refined. and cast. In Classical Greece of the first millenniu m B.C. the art of mining and metals was also considered a matter f or uncover- ing the secrets of nature; the very word metal come s from the Greek metallao, which meant \"to search, to find hid den things.\" Greek poets and philosophers, followed by Roman ones , perpetuated Plato's division of human history accor ding to four metal ages of Gold, Silver, Bronze (copper), and Iro n, in which gold represented the ideal age when Man had been cl osest to his gods. A biblical division included in the vision of Daniel begins with clay before the list of metals and is a more a ccurate version of Man's progress. After a long Old Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age began in the Near East circa 11,000 B.C.—ri ght after the Deluge. Some 3,600 years later Near Eastern man stepped off the mountain ranges into the fertile valleys, b eginning agri- culture, animal domestication, and the use of nativ e metals (metals found in riverbeds as nuggets, requiring ne ither mining nor refining). Scholars have called this the Neolit hic (New- Stone) Age, but it was really the age when clay—for pottery and many other uses—replaced stone, just as the seq uence in the Book of Daniel holds. The early use of copper was therefore of copper-sto nes, and for that reason many scholars prefer to call the tr ansition from the stone ages to the metal ages not a Copper Age bu t a Chal- colithic, Copper-Stone Age. This copper was processe d by ham- mering it into the desired shape, or by a process c alled annealing if the copperstone was first softened by fire. Believed to have begun in the highlands surrounding the Fert ile Crescent of the Near East, this metalworking of copper (and eventually"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"A Land of Which the Ingots Come 231 of gold) was possible due to the circumstances part icular to them. Gold and copper are found in nature in their \"natur al state,\" not only as veins deep within the rocks inside the earth, but also in the form of nuggets and lumps (even dust in the case of gold) that the forces of nature—storms, floods, or the pe rsistent flow of streams and rivers—have shaken loose out of the rocks as they became exposed. Such natural lumps of these me tals would then be found near and in riverbeds; the metal woul d be sepa- rated from the mud and gravel by washing with water (\"pan- ning\") or sifting through sieves. Although this doe s not involve cutting shafts and tunnels, the method is called pl acer mining. Most authorities believe that such mining was pract iced in the highlands surrounding the Fertile Crescent of Mesopo tamia and the Mediterranean eastern coasts as early as the fi fth millen- nium B.C.. and certainly before 4000 B.C. (This is a process that has been used throughout th e ages; few people realize that the \"gold miners\" of the re nowned nine- teenth-century gold rushes were not really miners w ho cut deep into the depths of the earth in search of gold, as is the case. say. of gold mining in southern Africa. They in fact eng aged in placer mining, sifting the gravel washed down into riverbeds for nuggets or gold dust. During the Yukon gold rush in Canada, for example, \"miners\" using a backhoe, a sluice and a pan re- ported the collection of more than a million ounces of gold each year during the peak times a century ago; the real production was probably twice as much. It is interesting that even nowadays such placer miners continue to find in the beds of the Yukon and Klondike rivers and their tributaries hundreds of thousands of ounces of gold a year.) It is noteworthy that although both gold and copper were thus available in their natural state, and gold was even more suitable for use because unlike copper it does not oxidize. Near Eastern man of those early millennia did not utiliz e gold but limited his use to copper. The phenomenon usually g oes without explanation; but it is our opinion that the explana tion is to be found in the notions familiar from the New World—th at gold was a metal belonging to the gods. When gold came i nto use. at the beginning of the third millennium B.C. or several centuries earlier, it was for enhancing the temples (literall y, \"God's House\") and for making golden vessels for the servi ce of the gods therein.

Reviewing the stages in man's use of metals, L. Aitchi- son (A History of Metals) noted with astonishment t hat by 3700 B.C. \"every culture in Mesopotamia was based on metal work- ing\"; he concluded with obvious admiration that the metallurgi- cal heights then reached \"must inevitably be attrib uted to the technical genius of the Sumerians.\" Not only copper and gold, that could be obtained fr om na- tive nuggets, but also other metals that clearly re quired extract- ing from veins inside rocks (as is the case with si lver) or smelting and then refining their ores (as, for example, lead ) were ob- tained, processed, and used. The art of alloying—th e combin- ing chemically in a furnace of two or more metals—w as developed. Primitive hammering gave way to the art of casting; and the very complex process known as Cire perdue (\" lost wax\"), which enabled the casting and making of beau tiful and useful objects (such as statuettes of gods or anima ls or temple utensils) was invented—in Sumer. The progress made there spread worldwide. In the words of Studies in Ancien t Technol- ogy by R. J. Forbes, \"by 3500 B.C. metallurgy had been ab- sorbed by the civilization in Mesopotamia\" (which b egan circa 3800 B.C.). \"This stage is reached in Egypt some thre e hundred years later and by 2500 B.C. the entire region betwe en the Nile cataracts and the Indus is metal minded.

After the Deluge the great Tigris-Euphrates plain w here the Edin had been was buried under impenetrable mud; it took nearly seven millennia for the plain to become dry enough for people to resettle there and launch the Sumerian ci vilization. Though in this plain of dry mud there were neither stone re- sources nor minerals, tradition required that Sumer ian civiliza- tion and its urban centers follow \"the olden plan.\" and the Sumerian metallurgical center was established where Bad-Tibira had once been. The fact that other people in the an cient Near East employed not only Sumerian technologies but al so Sumer- ian terminologies attests to the centrality of Sume r in ancient metallurgy. In no other ancient language have there been found so numerous and precise terms concerning metallurgy . There have been found in Sumerian texts no less than thir ty terms for varieties of copper (URU.DU). be it processed or unp rocessed. There were numerous terms prefixed by ZAG (sometime s shortened to ZA) to denote the metals' shine, and K U for the purity of the metal or its ores. There were terms f or varieties and alloys of gold, silver, and copper—even for iro n (which supposedly came into use only a millennium or so af ter Sumer's primacy); called AN.BAR, it too had more than a doze n terms depending on its and its ores' quality. Some Sumeri an texts were virtual lexicons listing terms for \"white stones.\" colored min- erals, salts that were obtained by mining, and bitu minous sub- stances. It is known from records and finds that Su merian traders reached out to very distant sources for met als, offering in exchange not only Sumer's staples—grains and woo llen gar- ments—but also finished metal products. While all that could be attributed to Sumerian know -how and acumen, what needs explaining is the fact that theirs was also the terminology and written symbols (initially pictographs) connected with mining—an activity conducted in dist ant lands and not in Sumer. Thus, the perils of mine working in Africa were mentioned in a text called \"Inanna's Descent t o the Lower World\"; and the ordeal of those punished to work in the mines of the Sinai Peninsula was detailed in the Epic of Gilgamesh when his companion, Enkidu, was sentenced by the go ds to end his days there.

The Sumerian rule-of-thumb for the alloy w as 1:6, i.e., about 85 percent copper and 15 percent tin, which i s indeed an excellent ratio. Bronze, however, was a technologica l achieve- ment in other ways too. It could be shaped only by casting, not hammering or annealing; and the tin for it must be obtained from its ores through a process called smelting and recovery, for it is very rarely found in nature in its native sta te. It must be recovered from an ore called cassiterite. This ore is generally found in alluvial deposits that resulted from the w ashing out of vein or lode tin from its rocks by natural forces s uch as heavy rains, floods, and avalanches. The tin is recovered from the cas- siterite by smelting, usually in combination with l imestone in the first phase of recovery. Even this oversimplifi ed description of the metallurgical processes involved will suffic e to make clear that bronze was a metal that required advanced meta llurgical know-how at every stage of its processing. To add to the problems, it was also a metal difficu lt to find. Whatever sources may have been available—which is n ot cer- tain—near Sumer, were quickly exhausted. Some Sumer ian texts mention two \"tin mountains\" in a far land who se identity is unclear; some (e.g., B. Landsberger in the Journal o f Near Eastern Studies, vol. xxi) do not shun such faraway places as the tin belt of the Far East (Burma, Thailand, and Malay sia) that is now a major source of tin. It has been ascertained that in their search for this vital metal Sumerian traders, via i ntermediaries in Asia Minor, reached out to tin-ore sources along the Danube, especially in the provinces known nowadays as Bohemi a and Saxony (where the ores have been long exhausted). F orbes has observed that \"the finds in the Royal Cemetery of Ur (2500 B.C.) show that the Ur smiths... understood the metal lurgy of bronze and copper perfectly. Where the tin ore they used came from, is still a mystery.\" The mystery, indeed, sti ll persists. Not only Gudea and other Sumerian kings in whose in scrip- tions tin is mentioned had to go to great lengths t o obtain it (probably already in its recovered state). Even a g oddess, the famous Ishtar, had to transverse mountains to find its place. In a text known as Inanna and Ebih (Inanna being Ishtar' s Sumerian name and Ebih being the name of a distant, unidenti fied moun- tain range), Inanna sought permission of the superi or gods by saying, Let me set out on the road to the tin ores, Let me learn about their mines."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"236 THE LOST REALMS For all these reasons, and perhaps because the gods —the Anunnaki—had to teach ancient man how to recover th e tin from its ore through smelting, the metal was consid ered by the Sumerians to be a \"divine\" metal. Their word for it was AN.NA, literally \"Heavenly Stone.\" (Likewise, when iron that required ore smelting came into use, it was called AN.BAR, \"Heavenly Metal.\") Bronze, the alloy of copper and t in, was called ZA.BAR, \"Gleaming Double Metal.\" The term for tin, Anna, was borrowed by the Hittite s with- out much change. But in the Akkadian language, the l anguage of the Babylonians and Assyrians and the other Semit ic-speak- ing peoples, the term underwent a slight change to Anaku. The term is usually taken to mean \"pure tin\" (Anak-ku); but we wonder whether the change may have reflected a clos er, more intimate association of the metal with the Anunnaki gods, for it has also been found spelled Annakum, meaning that w hich be- longs to or comes from the Anunnaki. The term appears in the Bible several times. Ending with a soft kh, it meant a tin-plumbline, as in the prophe cy of Amos envisioning the Lord holding an Anakh to illustrate his promise not to deviate anymore from his people Israel. As A nak the term meant \"necklace,\" reflecting the high value pu t on this bright metal as its rarity increased and it became as precious as silver. And it also meant \"giant\"—a Hebrew renderin g (as we have suggested in a previous volume) of the Mesopot amian \"Anunnaki.\" It is a rendering that raises intriguin g associations with the legends of both the Old World and the New World attributing this or that feat to the \"giants.\" All these associations of tin with the Anunnaki may have stemmed from their original role in granting mankin d this metal and the know-how it required. In fact, the slight b ut significant modification from the Sumerian AN.NA to the Akkadia n Anaku suggests a certain time frame. It is well doc umented, from archaeological discoveries as well as texts, t hat the great surge into the Bronze Age slowed down circa 2500 B.C. The founder of the Akkadian dynasty. Sargon of Akkad, v alued the metal so much that he chose it rather than gold or silver for commemorating himself (Fig. 124), circa 2300 B.C. Metallurgical historians find confirmation of the d windling supplies of tin in the fact that the percentage of tin in bronze kept being lowered, and in the discovery from texts that most of the new bronze objects were made from old bronze, b y melting down earlier objects and mixing the molten alloy wi th more copper, sometimes reducing the tin content to as li ttle as 2 per- cent. Then, for unexplained reasons, the situation changed"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"Figure 124 abruptly. \"Only from the Middle Bronze Age onwards, say from 2200 B.C.,\" Forbes wrote, \"are true bronze forms used and higher percentages of tin appear more regularly, an d not only for intricate forms as in the earlier period.\" Having given mankind bronze with which to launch th e great civilizations of the fourth millennium B.C., the Anun naki seemed to come to the rescue again over a millenniu m later. But while the unknown sources of tin in the first insta nce may have been Old World ones, the source in the second insta nce is a complete mystery. Here, then, is our daring thought: The new source w as the New World. If, as we believe, New World tin had reached the Ol d World's civilization centers, it could have come from one a nd only one place: Lake Titicaca. This not because the name, as we have shown, signif ies lake of \"the tin stones\"; but because this part of Bolivi a is still, mil- lennia later, a major source of the world's tin. Ti n, though not rare, is considered a scarce mineral, found only at a few places in commercial quantities. Nowadays 50 percent of th e world production comes from Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia , Bolivia, Congo-Brazzaville, Nigeria, and China (in descending o rder). Some earlier sources, in the Near East or in Europe , have been exhausted. Everywhere, the source of tin is alluvia l cassiterite, the oxidized tin ore washed by the forces of nature out of its lodes. In only two places has tin ore been found in its original lodes: Cornwall and Bolivia.

These rich but difficult mining sources, at elevati ons exceed- ing 12,000 feet, are concentrated primarily southea st of La Paz, the Bolivian capital, and east of Lake Poopo. The mu ch easier to attain alluvial cassiterite in riverbeds has com e from the east- ern coastal area of Lake Titicaca. There it was tha t ancient man collected the ores for their highly prized content, and where this kind of production continues today. Some of the most reliable research concerning Bolivi an-Titi- caca tin mining in antiquity was done by David Forb es (Re- searches on the Mineralogy of South America); condu cted more than a century ago, it was able to provide a pictur e as close to that found in Conquest times as possible, before the large-scale, mechanized operations of the twentieth century chan ged the landscape and obscured the ancient evidence. Since pure tin is extremely rare in nature, he was surprised to be sh own a sample of pure tin encasing a rock—not encased within the rock, but encasing the rock within the sample. An investigati on ascer- tained that this sample did not come from inside a mine in Oruro, but from rich cassiterite alluvial deposits. He totally re- jected the offered explanation that the metallic ti n was the re- sult of forest fires caused by lightning \"smelting\" the cassiterite ore, because the process of recovery of tin from th e ore involves more than the mere heating of the ore: a combinatio n first with carbon (to convert the ore, SnO 2 + C to CO 2 + Sn) and as often as not again with limestone to purify the sla g. Forbes was then shown specimens of metallic tin fro m gold washings on the banks of Tipuani, a tributary of th e Beni river flowing eastward from the mountain ranges near the lake. To his astonishment—his own words—he found the source to b e rich with gold nuggets, cassiterite, and nuggets and bea ds of metallic tin; this meant, convincingly, that whoever worked that area for its gold also knew how to process the tin-ore for i ts tin. Explor- ing the area just east of Lake Titicaca he was amaz ed—his words—by the large proportion of reduced (i.e., rec overed) and melted tin. He stated that the \"mystery\" of the occurrence of metallic tin in these areas \"cannot be explained by purely natural causes.\" Near Sorata he found a bronze mace head which on analysis showed the alloy to be over 88 pe rcent copper and just over 11 percent tin, \"which is quite ident ical with many of the ancient bronzes\" of Europe and the Near East .

In fact, the Spanish chronicler Barba (1640) stated that the Spaniards had found both tin and copper mines worked by the I ndians; the tin mines were \"near Lake Titicaca.\" Posnansky foun d such pre-Inca mines six miles from Tiahuanacu. He and ot hers after him confirmed the overwhelming presence of bronze a rtifacts at Tiahuanacu and its environs. He argued convincingly that the back of the Gate of the Sun's niches had been fitte d with golden panels that could swivel on protruding hinges or \"t urning prongs\" which had to be of bronze to support the we ight. He found at Tiahuanacu stone blocks bearing niches tha t served to hold bronze bolts, as at Puma Punku. At Puma Punku he had seen a piece of metal, undoubtedly bronze, that \"wi th its denti- form prongs looked like a tackle or device for lift ing weights.\" This piece was seen and sketched by him in 1905, bu t was car- ried off and gone by his next visit. In view of the systematic plundering of Tiahuanacu, in Inca as well as in mod ern times, the bronze tools found on the sacred islands of Tit icaca and Coati provide a measure of what must have once exist ed at Tia- huanacu itself. These finds included bronze bars, l evers, chisels, knives, and axes—all tools that could have served i n construc- tion work, but as likely as not also in mining oper ations. Indeed, Posnansky began his four-volume treatise wi th an introduction dealing with mining in prehistoric tim es in the Bo- livian highland plateau in general and in the envir ons of Lake Titicaca in particular. \"In the mountain range of t he Altiplano\"—highland plateau—\"are found tunnels or c averns, opened by ancient inhabitants with the object of pr oviding themselves with useful metals. These caves are to b e distin- guished from those opened by the Spaniards in searc h of pre- cious metals, in that the remains of ancient metall urgical labors long antedate those of the Spaniards... in most rem ote periods an intelligent and enterprising race ... provided t hemselves from the depths of this mountain range with useful, if not pre- cious, metals. \"What sort of metal was the prehistoric man of the Andes seeking in the depths of the mountains in so remote a period?\" Posnansky asked. \"Was it gold or silver? Certainly not! A metal of much more use caused him to ascend to the highes t peaks of the Andean mountain range: it was tin.\" And the tin , he ex- plained, was needed to alloy with copper to create \"the noble bronze.\" That this was the purpose of man at Tiahua nacu, he stated, was confirmed by the discovery, within a ra dius of thirty leagues from Tiahuanacu, of many tin mines."},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"240 THE LOST REALMS But did Andean man require this tin to make his own bronze tools? Apparently not. A major study by the leading metallur- gist Erland Nordenskidld (The Copper and Bronze Ages in South America) established that neither age had tak en place there: There had been in South America no trace of a devel- oped bronze or even a copper age, and the reluctant conclusion was that whatever bronze tools had been found, were in fact based on Old World shapes and Old World technologie s. \"Ex- amining all our material of weapons and tools of br onze and copper from S. America,\" Nordenskidld wrote, \"we mu st con- fess that there is not much that is entirely origin al, and that to the majority of fundamental types there is somethin g to corre- spond to the Old World.\" Still voicing his reluctan ce to sub- scribe to this conclusion, he went on to admit agai n that \"it must be confessed that there is considerable similarity between the metal technique of the New World and that of the Ol d during the Bronze Age.\" Significantly, some of the tools i ncluded in his examples had handles shaped as the head of the Sume rian god- dess Ninti with her symbol of the twin umbilical cu tters, later the Mistress of the Sinai mines. The history of bronze in the New World is thus link ed to the Old World, and the story of tin in the Andes, where New World bronze originated, is inexorably linked to Lake Tit icaca. In that, Tiahuanacu had a central role, tied to the minerals surrounding it; otherwise, why was it built there at all? The three civilization centers of the Old World aro se in fer- tile river valleys: the Sumerian in the plain betwe en the Tigris and Euphrates, the Egyptian-African along the Nile, that of India along the Indus river. Their base was agricul ture; trade, made possible by the rivers, provided the industria l raw mate- rials and enabled the export of grains and finished products. Cities sprung up along the rivers, commerce require d written records, trade nourished when society was organized and inter- national relations developed. Tiahuanacu does not fit that pattern. It gives the appearance of being, as the popular saying goes, \"all dressed up with no- where to go.\" A great metropolis whose culture and art forms influenced almost the whole Andean region—built in the mid- dle of nowhere, on the shores of an inhospitable la ke at the top of the world. And even if for the minerals, why the re? Geogra- phy may provide an answer. It is customary to begin every description of Lake Titicaca by stating that it is the highest navigable body of wa ter in the world, at an altitude of 13,861 feet. It is a rathe r large lake, with"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"A Land of Which the Ingots Come 241 a surface area of 3,210 square miles. Its depth var ies from a thousand feet to a hundred. Elongated in shape, it has a maxi- mum length of 120 miles and a maximal width of 44 m iles. Its ragged shoreline, the product of the mountains that surround it, forms numerous peninsulas, capes, isthmuses, and st raits, and the lake has more than two score islands. The north west - southeast layout of the lake (Fig. 109) is dictated by the moun- tain chains that skirt it. On the east runs the gre at range of the Cordillera Real of the Bolivian Andes, which includ es the tow- ering twin-peaked Mount Iliampu in the Sorata group and the imposing Illimani just southeast of La Paz. Except for several small rivers that flow from this range into the lak e, most flow eastward, down to the vast Brazilian plain and into the Atlantic Ocean some 2,000 miles away. It is here on the lake 's eastern shores and the beds of rivers and streams that flow both ways that great deposits of cassiterite have been found. No less imposing mountains skirt the lake on the no rth. There the runoff rainwaters flow mostly northward, feeding rivers, such as the Vilcanota, which some consider the true source of the Amazon; for, gathering tributaries an d merging into the Urubamba, they all flow down north and the n northeast into the great Amazon basin. It is there, between t he mountains bordering the lake and Cuzco, that most of the gold available to the Incas had been found. The western shore of Lake Titicaca, though bleak an d dreary, is the most populated. There, among the mou ntains and the bays, on the coasts and in the peninsulas, pres ent-day vil- lages and towns share locations with ancient sites— as does Puno, the largest lakeside town and port, with the nearby enig- matic ruins of Sillustani. At that point, as modern railroad engi- neers have found out, a road or rail line can lead not only north but also through one of the few gaps in the Andes t oward the coastal plains and the Pacific Ocean, a bare two hu ndred miles away. The maritime and terrestrial geography and topograp hy change considerably as one views the lake's souther n portion (which, like most of the lake's eastern shore, belo ngs not to Peru but to Bolivia).

It is at the southern shore of the lake that the wa ter-filled cavity between all these mountain ranges continues as dry land, creating the valley or plateau on which Tiahuanacu is situated.

The orig inal name, we suggest, was TI.ANAKU: the place of Titi and Ana ku—TIN CITY. Our suggestion that Anaku in the place's name stems from the Mesopotamian term which meant tin as the metal granted by the Anunnaki invokes a direct link between Tiahu anacu and Lake Titicaca and the ancient Near East. There is e vidence to support such a suggestion. Bronze accompanied the sprouting of the Near Eastern civili- zations and came into full metallurgical utilizatio n there by 3500 B.C. But by 2600 B.C. or so, the supplies of tin dwindle d and almost petered out. Then, suddenly, fresh supplies appeared circa 2200 B.C.; the Anunnaki, somehow, had stepped i n to end the tin crisis and save the very civilizations they had given Man- kind. How was that achieved? Let us look at some known facts. Circa 2200 B.C., when tin supplies in the Near East im proved so abruptly, an enigmatic people appeared on the Ne ar Eastern scene.

He stated that it was esteemed by the Greeks since the Trojan war (and is indeed mentioned by Homer by the term cassiteros). The Trojan war had taken place in the thirteenth century B.C. at the western edge of Asia Minor, whe re the early Mediterranean Greeks came into contact with the Hit tites (or were, perhaps, Indo-European cousins of theirs). \"T he legends say that men seek this cassiteros in the isles of t he Atlantic,\" Pliny wrote in his Historia Naturalis, \"and that it is transported in boats made of osier\"—a twiggy plant, like a will ow—\"cov- ered with hides stitched together.\" The islands tha t the Greeks call Cassiterites, \"in consequence of their abundan ce of tin,\" he wrote, are out in the Atlantic facing the cape call ed the End of Earth; \"they are the six Islands of the Gods, which some people have designated as the Isles of Bliss.\" It is an in triguing state- ment, for if the Hittites from whom the Greeks had teamed all that spoke of the gods as being the Anunnaki, we ha ve here a term with all the connotations of Anaku.

One of the few academicians who ha s stuck his neck out in this direction is Professor Cyrus H. Gordon (Be- fore Columbus and Riddles in History). Reminding his r eaders of earlier mention of the identity of the name Brazi l with the Semitic term Barzel for iron, he gave considerable c redence to the so-called Paraiba Inscription that turned up in that north Brazilian site in 1872.

But Gordon, with gr eat scholarship, argued for accepting as authentic the inscription that it was a message left by the captain of a Phoe nician ship, separated by a storm from its sister ships, that ha d sailed from the Near East circa 534 B.C. What is common to all these studies is, first, that the \"discov- ery\" of America was accidental, a result of a shipw reck or an off-course diversion by ocean currents; and second, that its time was in the first millennium B.C. and most probably in the second half of that millennium. But we are discussing a much earlier time, almost t wo thou- sand years earlier; and we are claiming that the ex change of goods and people between the Old and New World was not accidental, but the result of the deliberate interv ention of the \"gods,\" the Anunnaki. It is certain that the Cassites were not Britishers in disguise. Near Eastern records place them to the east of Sume r, in what is nowadays Iran. They were related to the Hittites of Asia Minor as well as to the Hurrians (the biblical Horites, \"Peo ple of the Shafts\") who acted as a geographical and cultural l ink between Sumer in southern Mesopotamia and the Indo-European peoples to the north.

Abandoning centuries of petrified ge ographic dogma based on the works of Ptolemy of Alexandria ( second century AD ), Toscanelli picked up the ideas of pre-Christian Greek scholars such as Hipparchus and Eudoxus that the Earth was a sphere, and its measurements and size from Gr eek sa- vants of earlier centuries. He found confirmation f or these ideas in the Bible itself, such as in the prophetic book Esdras II that was part of the Bible in its first Latin translatio n, which clearly spoke of a \"round world.\" Toscanelli accepted all t hat but mis- calculated the width of the Atlantic; he also belie ved that the land lying some 3,900 miles west of the Canary Isla nds was the tip of Asia. This was where Columbus encountered lan d, the islands he believed were the \"West Indies\"—a misnom er that has remained to this day. Modern researchers are convinced that the King of P ortugal even possessed maps that delineated the Atlantic co ast of South America, jutting more than a thousand miles eastwar d than the islands discovered by Columbus.

Hapgood, in one of the best studies on the Piri Re'is map and it s antecedents (Maps of the Ancient Sea Kings), has concluded that \"the evi- dence presented by the ancient maps appears to sugg est the existence in remote times... of a true civilization of an ad- vanced kind\"; more advanced than Greece or Rome, and in nautical sciences ahead of eighteenth-century Europ e. He rec- ognized that before them all was the Mesopotamian c ivilization, extending back at least 6,000 years; but certain fe atures on the maps, such as Antarctica, made him wonder who had p receded the Mesopotamians. While most studies of these maps concentrate on the ir At- lantic features, the studies by Hapgood and his tea m established that the Piri Re'is map also depicts correctly the A ndean moun- tains, the rivers including the Amazon that flow fr om them east- ward, and the South American Pacific coast from abo ut 4 degrees south to about 40 degrees south—i.e., from Ecuador through Peru to midway in Chile. Amazingly, the tea m found that \"the drawing of the mountains indicates that t hey were ob- served from the sea, from coastwise shipping, and n ot imag- ined.\" The coasts were drawn in such detail that th e Paracas Peninsula could be discerned. Stuart Piggott (Aux portes de l'histoire) was one o f the first to note that that stretch of Pacific coast of South Am erica also appeared on the European copies of Ptolemy's Map of the World. It was shown, however, not as a continent be yond a vast ocean, but as a Tierra Mitica, mythical land, exten ding from the tip of southern China beyond a peninsula called Que rsoneso de Oro, the Peninsula of Gold, all the way southward t o a conti- nent we now call Antarctica. This observation prompted the noted South American ar- chaeologist D. E. Ibarra Grasso to launch an extens ive study of ancient maps; his conclusions were published in his La Repre- sentation de America en mapas Romanes de tiempos de Cristo.

At Tiahuanacu and the southern Andes, this g od was depicted armed with a lightning bolt and holding a metal wand —an image carved on stone, depicted on ceramics and on tex- tiles.

The Sumerians, where the Old World pantheons origin ated, called this god Adad or ISH.KUR (\"He of the Far Moun tains\"), and depicted him with the metal tool and forked lig htning (Fig. 129b). One of their epithets for him was ZABAR DIB.BA —\"He who bronze obtains and divides\"— an illuminating cl ue. Was he not Rimac of the southern coasts of Peru, Vir acocha of the Andean highlands, whose image with the metal tool and forked lightning appeared all over, whose symbol of a lightning appeared by itself on many monuments? He may have e ven been shown standing upon a bull in a stone carving, found southwest of Lake Titicaca by Ribero and von Tschudi (Fig. 129c). Scholars who have studied the name Viracocha in its di- verse variants agree that its components mean \"Lord /Supreme\" who of \"Rain/Storm/Lightning\" is \"Maker/Creator.\" An Inca hymn described him as the god \"who comes in the thu nder and in the storm clouds.\" This is almost word for word the way this Figure 130"},{"pageNumber":253,"pageContent":"252 THE LOST REALMS deity, the God of Storms, was lauded in Mesopotamia ; and the golden disk from Cuzco (Fig. 85b) depicts a deity w ith the tell- tale symbol of the forked lightning.

It was not the first time he had made the arduous s pace jour- ney. Some 440,000 Earth-years earlier—a mere 122 ye ars in terms of Nibiru—his firstborn son, Enki, had led th e first group of fifty Anunnaki to Earth to obtain the gold with which this seventh planet was blessed. On Nibiru, nature and t echnological usages had combined to thin out and damage the plan et's atmo- sphere, an atmosphere needed not only for breathing but that also had acted to envelop the planet into a greenho use, pre- venting its inner-generated heat from dissipating. And only by suspending gold particles high above Nibiru, its sc ientists con- cluded, could Nibiru be saved from becoming a froze n and life- less globe. Enki, the brilliant scientist that he was, splashed down in the Persian Gulf and established his base, Eridu. on it s shores. His plan was to obtain the gold by extracting it from t he gulf's waters; but not enough was attained that way, and t he crisis on Nibiru deepened. Tired of Enki's assurances that he would make the project a success, Anu came to Earth to se e things for himself. He had with him his heir apparent, Enlil: though not the firstborn, Enlil was entitled to the succession because his mother, Antu, was a half sister of Anu. He lacked t he scientific brilliance of Enki, but was an excellent administra tor; not fasci- nated with the mysteries of nature, but one believi ng in taking charge and getting things done. And the thing to do , all the studies indicated, was to get the gold by mining it where it was abundant: in southern Africa. Bitter arguments broke out not only regarding the pr oject itself, but also between the rival half brothers. A nu even thought of staying on Earth and letting one of his sons act as regent on Nibiru; but the idea only caused more dis cord. Finally 253"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"254 THE LOST REALMS they drew lots. Enki was to go to Africa and organi ze the min- ing; Enlil was to stay in the E.DIN (Mesopotamia), build the necessary facilities for refining the ores and for shipping the gold back to Nibiru. And Anu returned to the planet of the Anunnaki. That was the first visit. And then there was the second visit, brought about by an- other emergency. Forty Nibiru-years after the first landing, the Anunnaki who were assigned to work in the gold mine s muti- nied. How much was really caused by their arduous t oil in the deep mines and how much reflected the envy and fric tion be- tween the two half brothers and their contingents, one can only guess. The fact was that the Anunnaki supervised by Enki in southern Africa mutinied, refused to continue minin g, and held Enlil hostage after he was there to defuse the cris is. All those events were recorded; they were, millenni a later, told to the Earthlings that they might know how it all began. A Council of the Gods was convened. Enlil insisted tha t Anu come to Earth and preside, to pass judgment against Enki. In the presence of the gathered leaders Enlil describe d the chain of events, accused Enki of leading the mutiny. But when the muti- neers told their story, Anu sympathized with them. They were spacemen, not miners; and their toil had indeed bec ome un- bearable. But did not the job need doing? How would life on Ni biru survive without this mined gold? Enki had a solutio n: we will create Primitive Workers, he said, who will take ov er the hard toil! To the astounded gathering he related that he had been conducting experiments, with the aid of the chief m edical of- ficer, Ninti/Ninharsag. There already exists on Ear th, in East Africa, a primitive being—an Apeman. This being mus t have evolved on Earth from Nibiru's own Seed of Life, pa ssed from Nibiru to Earth during the primeval celestial colli sion with Tia- mat. There is genetic compatibility; what is needed is to up- grade this being, by giving it some of the Anunnaki 's own genes. It will then be a creature in the likeness and in t he image of the Anunnaki, able to hold tools, intelligent enough to carry out orders. And so it was that LULU AMELU, the \"Mixtured Worker .\" was created, out of genetic manipulation and the fe rtilization of an Apewoman's egg in a laboratory flask. The hybrid s could not procreate; female Anunnaki had to act each time as birth-god- desses. But Enki and Ninharsag perfected them throug h trial and error until the perfect model was achieved.

Some, over the obj ections of Enlil, took the Daughters of Man as wives, even had children by them. For the Anunnaki, obtaining the gold was now a task without tears; but to Enlil it all began to look li ke a mission perverted. It all came to an end with the Deluge. For a long t ime the scientific observations had warned that the ice cap that was building up on the Antarctic continent became unsta ble; the next time Nibiru passed in Earth's vicinity, betwee n Mars and Jupiter, its gravitational pull might cause this tr emendous ice mass to slip off its continent, creating a worldwid e tidal wave, abruptly changing the oceans' and Earth's temperatu res, causing unparalleled storms. Consulting Anu, Enlil gave the order: pre- pare the spacecraft, be ready to abandon Earth! But what about Mankind, its creators, Enki and Ninha rsag, asked. Let Mankind perish, Enlil said. He made all the Anun- naki swear to secrecy, lest the desperate Earthling s interfere with the Anunnaki's departure preparations. Enki, r eluctant, swore too; but pretending to speak to a wall, he in structed his faithful follower Ziusudra to build a Tibatu, a sub mersible ship. in which he and his family and enough animals could survive the avalanche of water, so that life on Earth should no t perish. And he provided Ziusudra with a navigator to bring the ship to Mount Ararat, the Near East's most conspicuous doub le-peaked mountain. The Creation and Deluge texts dictated by the Anunna ki to the Sumerians relate tales much more detailed and s pecific than the familiar biblical concise and edited versions. By the time the catastrophe occurred, there had been on Earth not o nly demi- gods. Some of the principal deities, members of the sacred circle of Twelve, were themselves in a way Earthlings: Nan nar/Sin and Ishkur/Adad, Enlil's younger sons, were born on Earth; so were of course Sin's twin children, Utu/Shamash and Inanna/ I s h t a r . Enki and Ninharsag (with whom he may have s hared his secret \"Operation Noah\") joined the others in sugge sting that the Anunnaki not leave Earth for good, but remain i n Earth orbit for a while to see what would happen. And ind eed, after the immense tidal wave had come and gone and the rains had stopped, the peaks of Earth began to show and the Sun's rays, shining through the clouds, painted rai nbows in the skies.

In antediluvial times the spaceport, for the coming and going of the Anunnaki and their supplies and for shipping out the gold, was in Mesopotamia, at Sippar. But that whole fertile val- ley between the Euphrates and Tigris was now covere d with billions of tons of mud. Still using the twin-peake d Ararat as the focal point on which to anchor the apex of the Land ing Corri- dor, they erected twin artificial mountains at the thirtieth paral- lel on the bank of the Nile—the two great pyramids of Giza, to serve as landing beacons for a postdiluvial spacepo rt in the Sinai peninsula. It was as near, even somewhat nearer, to the African gold sources as the spaceport in Mesopotamia had be en. So that the Hart tilings could survive, multiply, a nd be helpful to the Anunnaki, Mankind was granted civilization i n three states. Seeds for vital crops were brought over fro m Nibiru, wild strains of grains and animals were domesticated, cl ay and metal technologies taught. The latter was of great import ance, for it touched on the Anunnaki's own success in resuming t he supply of gold, now that the old mines were clogged with m ud and water. Since the Deluge, Nibiru had come once again near E arth, and vital materials had been received from it; but little of value was sent back. In the olden gold sources it was now necessary to locate hidden lodes, tunnel into mountainsides, cut shafts into the earth, blast the rocks. Mankind had to be provi ded with tools—hard tools—to be able to extract what the Anu nnaki could locate and blast with their ray guns. Fortuna tely, the ava- lanche of water had also done some good, for it had exposed lodes, washed them out, filled riverbeds with golde n nuggets mixed with mud and gravel. Getting hold of this gol d could open up new sources—easier to work but more difficu lt to reach and transport; for the place where this kind of nugget gold was plentiful was on the other side of Earth: there , along moun- tain chains that face the great ocean, untold golde n riches had been exposed. It was just there for the taking—if t he Anunnaki would go there, if a way could be found to ship tha t gold. And now that Nibiru had neared Earth again, the gre at Anu with his spouse Antu had come to Earth for a state visit, to see for himself where matters stood.

Ar- chaeology has indeed confirmed the preeminent antiq uity of that Sumerian city. Of its twenty-three rulers, one bore a name- epithet that can be understood to mean that he was a metal- lurgist; it is clearly stated that the twenty-secon d ruler, Enmenbaragsi, was the \"one who carried away as spoi l the cast weapon of Elam.\" Elam, in the highlands east and so utheast of Sumer, was indeed one of the places where metallurg y had begun; and the mention of the prize booty, a cast w eapon, con- firms the archaeological evidence of a fully develo ped metal- lurgy in the ancient Near East soon after 4000 B.C. But \"Kish was smitten with weapons,\" perhaps by the very same Elamites whose land had been invaded; and King ship, the capital, was transferred to a brand-new city called Uruk (the biblical Erech). Of its twelve kings the best known has been Gilgamesh, of heroic fame. His name meant \"to Gibil , god of Smelting/Casting [dedicated].\" Metalworking, it appe ars, was important to the rulers of Uruk. One of them had th e word smith describe that for which he was renowned. The very first ruler, whose reign began when Uruk was no more than a sacred precinct, had the prefix MES—\"Casting Master\"—as par t of his name. Of him the inscription was unusually long: Mes-kiag-gasher, son of divine Utu, became high priest of Eanna as well as king... Meskiaggasher went into the Western Sea and came forth toward the Mountains. This is, by the very fact that it is a lengthy stat ement where usually only the king's name and the length of his reign are listed, very important information, recording a ren owned feat. Which sea Meskiaggasher, the Casting Master, crossed and at what mountain range he arrived, we shall never know for sure; but the wording does suggest the other side of the world. We can understand the urgency of bringing metallurg y at Uruk to perfection: it had to do with Anu's forthco ming state visit.

At the center of the s acred pre- cinct a many-staged temple was built, its corners m ade of cast metal. Its name, E.ANNA, is generally taken to mean \"House of Anu\"; but it could also mean \"House of Tin.\" The detailed texts that recorded the protocol and program of the royal visit to Uruk reveal a place lavished with gold. Tablets found in the archieves of Uruk that, accord ing to their scribe's notation were copies of earlier Sume rian texts, are legible only from a midpoint. Anu and Antu are alre ady seated in the temple's courtyard, reviewing a procession o f gods carry- ing in the golden scepter. Meanwhile, goddesses pre pare the visitors' sleeping quarters in the E.NIR—\"House of Bright- ness\"—that was covered with the \"handiwork of Lower World gold.\" As the skies darkened, a priest ascended the ziggurat's topmost stage to observe the expected appearance of Nibiru, \"Great Planet of Anu of Heaven.\" After appropriate hymns were recited, the visitors washed their hands from golden basins and were served an evening meal from seven golden t rays; beer and wine were poured from golden vessels. After mor e hymns hailing \"the Creator's Planet, the Planet that is He aven's Hero\" had been recited, the visitors were led by a proces sion of torch- carrying gods to their \"golden enclosure\" for the n ight. In the morning, golden censers were filled by pries ts during sacrifices as the gods were awakened for an elabora te breakfast served from golden dishes. When it was time to depa rt, the visiting deities were led in a procession of gods, accompanied by hymn-singing priests, to the quay where their boat was moored. They left the city through the Exalted Gate, procee ded down the Avenue of the Gods, and arrived at \"The Holy Qu ay, the Dike of the Ship of Anu\" that was to take them on \" The Path of the Gods.\" At a chapel called House of Akitu, Anu a nd Antu joined the Gods of Earth in prayers, reciting bless ings seven times.

And, as at Uruk, we would expect to find an observatory for determining the moment of the appea rance of Nibiru in the evening skies, followed by the rising of the other planets. Only such a parallelism, we feel, can explain the n eed for the observatory that the Kalasasaya had been, for i ts precision, and for its date: circa 4000 B.C. Only such a state visit, we sug- gest, can explain the elaborate architecture of Pum a-Punku. its royallike piers, and, yes, its gold-plated enclosur e. For that is precisely what archaeologists had found at Puma- Punku: incontrovertible evidence that gold plates covered not only por- tions of gates (as were the back panels of the Gate of the Sun at Tiahuanacu), but that whole walls, entrances and co rnices were plated with gold. Posnansky found and photographed rows of small round holes in many polished and dressed ston e blocks that \"served to support golden plates which covered them by means of nails, also of gold.\" When he delivered a lecture on the subject to the Geographic Society in April 1943 , he pre- sented one of these blocks with five golden nails s till sticking in it (the other nails having been pulled out by gold seekers when they removed the golden plates). The possibility that at Puma-Punku there had been e rected, at the earliest time, an edifice whose walls, ceili ng, and cornices were covered with gold just as the E.NIR had been in Uruk becomes even more significant when we find that the bas-reliefs decorating the ceremonial gates at Puma-Punku, as w ell as some of the gigantic statues of the Great God at Ti ahuanacu. were inlaid with gold. Posnansky discovered and pho tographed the attachment holes, \"some two millimeters in diam eter, round about the reliefs.\" A principal gate at Puma-Punku that he named Gate of the Moon had its relief of Viracocha as well as the god's face in the meander under it \"inlaid with gold... which made the principal hieroglyphs stand out with great bril- liance.\" No less significant was the discovery of Posnansky that where these figures depicted the god's eyes, the gold inl ay and nails \"secured into the slits of the eyes small round pla tes of tur- quoise. We have found,\" Posnansky reported, \"many o f these pieces of turquoise perforated in the center, in th e cultural strata of Tiahuanacu\"—a fact that led him to believ e that not only the reliefs on the gates, but also the giganti c stone statues of gods that have been found at Tiahuanacu, were in laid with gold on their faces and their eyes inlaid with turq uoise."},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"Figure 131 This discovery is most remarkable, for there is no turquoise —a semiprecious blue-green stone—anywhere in South Amer- ica.

This belief may have been sustained by the inlaying of the god's tears with gold, a practice that may explain why the An- dean people (like the Aztecs) called gold nuggets \" tears of the gods.\" Since all these statues depicted the same de ity as on the Gate of the Sun, where he is also shown shedding te ars, he has come to be called \"The Weeping God.\" In view of our evidence, we feel justified calling him \"God of the Golden Te ars.\" A gi- gantic carved monolith found at a satellite site (W ancai) depicts the deity with a conical and horned headdress—the t ypical headdress of Mesopotamian gods—and with lightning b olts in- stead of tears (Fig. 132), clearly identifying him as the Storm God.

That gold was available and plentiful at Tiahuanacu and its satellites is evident not only from legends, tales, or place names, but also from archaeological remains. Many golden o bjects clas- sified by scholars as Classical Tiahuanacu because of their shape or decorations (stylized images of the God of the G olden Tears,"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"262 THE LOST REALMS staircases, crosses) have been found at nearby land sites as well as islands in the course of excavations in the 1930 s, 1940s, and 1950s. Especially noteworthy were the archaeologica l missions sponsored by the American Museum of Natural History (under William C. Bennett), the Peabody Museum of American A r- chaeology and Ethnology (under Alfred Kidder II), a nd the Ethnological Museum of Sweden (under Stig Ryden, to gether with Max Portugal, then curator of the Archaeologic al Museum in La Paz.) The objects included cups, vases, disks, tubes, and pins (one of the latter, some six inches long, had a head in the shape of a three-branched plume). Golden objects found during earlier ex- cavations on the two sacred islands, Titicaca (Isla nd of the Sun) and Coati (Island of the Moon), were described by Po snansky in his Guia General to Tiahuanacu and its environs, an d even more so by A. E Bandelier (The Islands of Titicaca and Ko ati). The finds on Titicaca have been mostly in unidentifiabl e ruins in the vicinity of the Sacred Rock and its cavern; scholars cannot agree whether the artifacts belong to the early periods o f Tiahuanacu, or (as some hold) stem from Inca times, for it is k nown that the Incas came to this island to worship and to erect s hrines in the reign of Mayta Capac, the fourth Inca ruler. The finds at and around Tiahuanacu of golden and br onze artifacts leave no doubt that gold preceded bronze (i.e., tin) in that area. Posnansky was emphatic in relegating bro nze to the third period of Tiahuanacu, and showed incidences w here bronze clamps were used to repair structures from t he golden era. Since the mines in the nearby mountains show c lear evi- dence that tin ores and gold were obtained at the s ame sites, it was probably the discovery of gold followed by its placer mining in the Titicaca region that brought out the existen ce of cassiter- ite: the two are found intermingled in the same riv erbeds and streams. At the Tipuani river and at the river that flows from Mount Illampu. an official Bolivian report (titled B olivia and the Opening of the Panama Canal, 1912) stated that i n addition to the tin ores, \"both rivers are famous for the pr esence of gravels containing immense quantities of gold\"; at depths of 300 feet, rock bottom could not be found. Remarkably, \"t he pro- portion of gold increases with the depth of the gra vel.\" The report pointed out that Tipuani river gold was 22-2 3 1/2 carat fine—almost purest gold. The list of Bolivian sites of placer gold is almost inexhaustible, even after all the ce nturies of exploitation since the Conquest.

The minera l resources certainly knew no political borders, and we have al ready de- scribed in earlier chapters the riches in gold, sil ver, and copper that the Spaniards encountered in Peru proper and t he Euro- pean belief that the \"mother lode\" of all gold in t he western Americas, north and south, lay within the Peruvian Andes. A look at a map of South America mineral resources pro- vides a clear picture. Three bands of varying width s of gold, silver, and copper lodes snake their way along the Andean ranges in the northwestern-southeastern slant, all the way from Colombia in the north to Chile and Argentina in the south. Dotted along the way are some of the world's most r enowned sources for these metals, some regarded as almost p ure moun- tains of the minerals. The slow forces of nature, a nd no doubt the immense avalanche of water of the Deluge, have forced the metals and their ores out of their rock-embedded lo des—ex- posing them, washing them down mountainsides and in to river- beds. Since most of the mightiest rivers of South A merica flow off the Andean ranges eastward, through the vast pl ains of Bra- zil to the Atlantic Ocean, it is no wonder that gol d and copper have also been plentiful on this side of the contin ent. But it is the lodes within the Andean ranges that ar e the ultimate source of all the placer and mined metals; and as one looks at these interwined bands of lodes, different ly colored on a map for identification, the image bears a resembl ance to color drawings of the double-helix structure of DNA, entw ined within itself and with its counterpart RNA, the genetic cha ins of life and heredity of everything that lives on Earth.

But the true metallurgi- cal technology including that of casting, of high-r ise construc- tion, of building according to architectural plans, and following stellar orientations, was in the hands of the Sumer ians.

Why was it tha t in their incantations the Inca priests invoked Heaven by utt ering the magical words Zi-Ana and Earth by the words Zi-ki-a —totally meaningless terms in either Quechua or Aymara (acco rding to S. A. Lafone Quevado, Ensayo Mitologico)—but words that in Sumerian mean \"Heavenly Life\" (ZI.ANA) and \"Life of Earth and Water\" (ZI.KI.A). And why did the Incas retain from an- cient empire times the term Anta for metals in gene ral and cop- per in particular—a term that is Sumerian, as AN.TA , would have been of a class with AN.NA (tin) and AN.BAR (iro n)? These relics of Sumerian metallurgical terms (which were borrowed by their successors) are augmented by the discovery of Sumerian mining pictographs. German archaeologis ts led by A. Bastian have found such symbols incised on rocks on the banks of the Manizales river in Colombia's central gold region (Fig. 134a); and a French governmental mission unde r E.

Add to all that the possibility that some of the Su merians brought over to Lake Titicaca may have survived to present times. Nowadays only a few hundred of them are left ; they live on some islands in the lake, sailing upon it in ree d boats. The Aymara and Kholla tribesmen that now make up most o f the area's inhabitants consider them remnants of the ar ea's earliest dwellers, aliens from another land, whom they call Uru. The name is taken to mean \"the Olden Ones\"; but have th ey been so called because they came from the Sumerian capital Ur?"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"266 THE LOST REALMS According to Posnansky, the Urus named five deities or Samptni: Pacani-Malku, meaning Olden or Great Lord; Malku, meaning Lord; and the gods of the Earth, the Waters , and the Sun. The term malku is of obvious Near Eastern orig in, where it meant (as it still does in Hebrew and Arabic) \"king .\" One of the few studies on the Urus, by W. La Barre (American An thropol- ogist vol. 43), reports that Uru \"myths\" relate tha t \"we, the people of the lake, are the oldest on this Earth. A long time we are here, from before the time when the Sun was hid den... Before the Sun hid himself we were already a long ti me in this place. Then the Kollas came... They used our bodies for sacri- fices when they laid the foundations for their temp les... Tiahuanaco was built before the time of the darknes s.\" We have already established that the Day of Darknes s, \"when the Sun was hidden,\" occurred circa 1400 B.C. I t was. we have shown, a global event that left its mark in th e writings and recollections of people on both sides of the Earth. This Uru legend, or collective memory, affirms that Tiahuana cu was built before that event, and that the Urus had been there also for a long time before. To this very day, the lake's Aymara tribesmen sail upon it in reed boats that, they say, they had learned to make from the Urus. The remarkable similarity of these boats to t he reed boats of the Sumerians prompted Thor Heyerdahl to replica te the boat and embark on the Kon-Tiki (an epithet of Vira cocha) voyages, to prove that the ancient Sumerians could have crossed the oceans. The extent of Sumerian/Uru-rian presence in the And es can be gleaned by such other imprints as the fact that uru means \"day\" in all the Andean languages, both in Aymara a nd Que- chua, the same meaning (\"daylight\") that it had in Mesopota- mia. Such other Andean terms as uma/mayu for water, khun for red, kap for hand, enulienu for eye, makai for blow are so clearly of Mesopotamian origin that Pablo Patron (N ouvelles etudes sur les langues americaines) concluded that \"it is clearly demonstrated that the Quechua and Aymara languages of indig- enous Peru had a Sumerian-Assyrian origin.\" The term uru appears as a component of many geograp hical names in Bolivia and Peru, such as the important min ing center Oruru, the Sacred Valley of the Incas Urubamba (\"Pl ain/valley of the Uru\") and its famed river, and many many mor e.

There are other apparent links between the civiliza tion of Mesopotamia and that of the Andes. How explain, for example, the fact that, as in the case of Tiahuanacu, the Su merian capital Ur was surrounded by a canal with a northern harbor and a southwestern one (leading to the Euphrates river an d beyond)? And how explain the Golden Enclosure of the main te mple of Cuzco. where the walls were covered with gold plates —just as the ones at Puma-Punku and Uruk? And the \"Bible in P ictures\" in the Coricancha, depicting Nibiru and its orbit? There were the many customs that led the arriving S paniards to see in the Indians descendants of the Ten Tribes of Israel. There were the coastal cities and their temples tha t brought to explorers' minds the sacred precincts and ziggurats of Sumer. And how account for the incredibly ornate textiles of the coastal people near Tiahuanacu, unique in the Americas, exc ept by comparison with the Sumerian textiles, especially t hose of Ur, that were renowned in antiquity for their exquisite designs and colors? Why the portrayal of gods with conical head dresses, and a goddess with the Umbilical Cutter of Ninti? Why a calendar as in Mesopotamia, and a zodiac as in Sumer, with Prec ession and twelve houses? Without rehashing all the evidence that has filled the pre- vious chapters, it seems to us that all the pieces of the puzzle of Andean beginnings fall into place if we acknowledge the hand of the Anunnaki and the presence of Sumerians (alon e or with their neighbors) in this region circa 4000 B.C. The l egends of the ascent heavenward of the Creator and his two sons, t he Moon and the Sun, from the sacred rock on the Island of the Sun (Titicaca Island) may well be recollections of the departure of Anu. his son Sin and his grandson Shamash: having m ade a short trip by boat from Puma-Punku to a waiting air borne-craft of the Anunnaki. On that memorable night at Uruk, as soon as Nibiru had been sighted, the priests lit torches that were a s ignal to nearby villages. There bonfires were lit, as signals to th e neighboring settlements; and soon the whole land of Sumer was a glow, cele- brating the presence of Anu and Antu and the sighti ng of the Planet of the Gods.

But no sooner (in Anunnaki terms) had Anu and Antu r e- turned to Nibiru than the peaceful division of Eart h among the Anunnaki clans was disturbed. It was circa 3450 B.C. , according to our calculations, when the incident of the Tower of Babel took place: an attempt by Marduk/Ra to obtain primac y for his city Babylon in Mesopotamia. Though frustrated by En lil and Ninurta, the attempt to involve Mankind in building a launch tower brought about the decision of the gods to dis perse Man- kind and confuse its languages. The sole civilizati on and its lan- guage were now to be split up; and after a chaotic period that lasted some 350 years, the civilization of the Nile , with its own language and rudimentary writing, was formed. It ha ppened, Egyptologists tell us, circa 3100 B.C. Frustrated in his effort to assume supremacy in civ ilized Sumer, Marduk/Ra seized upon the granting of civiliz ation to the Egyptians to return to that land and reclaim it s lordship from his brother Thoth. Now Thoth found himself a g od with- out a people; and it is our suggestion that accompa nied by some of his faithful followers he chose an abode in the New Realms —in Mesoamerica. And we further suggest that it happened not just \"c irca 3100 B.C.\" but exactly in 3113 B.C.—the time, the year, and even the day from which the Mesoamericans began their Long Co unt. Counting the passage of time by anchoring the calend ar to a major event is not unusual at all. The Western Chris tian calen- dar counts the years from the birth of Christ. The M oslem cal- endar begins with the Hegira, the migration of Moha mmed from Mecca to Medina. Skipping over the many exampl es from various preceding lands and monarchies, we shall me ntion the Jewish Calendar, which is in effect the ancient (and first-ever) Calendar of Nippur, the Sumerian city dedicated to E nlil. Con- trary to the common assumption that the Jewish coun t of years (5,748 in 1988) is from the \"beginning of the world ,\" it is actu- ally from the beginning of the Nippurian calendar i n 3760 B.C.— the time, we assume, of Anu's state visit to Earth. Why not then accept our suggestion that the arrival of Quet- zalcoatl, i.e., the Winged Serpent, in his new real m was the occasion for starting the Long Count of the Mesoamer ican cal- endar—especially since it was this very god who had introduced the calendar to these lands?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"Figure 135 Having been overthrown by his own brother, Thoth (k nown in Sumerian texts as Ningishzidda—Lord of the Tree of Life) was a natural ally of his brother's adversaries, th e Enlilite gods and their Chief Warrior, Ninurta.

As a friend of the Enlili tes. he had to be friendly with Ishkur/Adad and the Andean realm t hat was put under his control in the Titicaca region; he wa s probably even a welcome guest there. Indeed, we can discern evidence that a Serpent God and his African followers probably lent a hand in developin g some of the satellite metal-processing sites around Tiahuan acu.

It was at that time, and probably as a consequence of the instability in the Old Realms, that the concerned go ds decided to create a new civilization away from it all—in th e Andes.

C .—just as Montesinos had con- cluded—that Manco Capac was given the golden wand at Titi- caca and sent to the gold region of Cuzco. What was the shape and purpose of this magical wand ? One of the most thorough studies on the subject is Coron a Incaica by Juan Larrea. Analyzing artifacts, legends, and pict orial depic- tions of Inca rulers, he concluded that it was an a xe, an object called Yuari that when first given to Manco Capac wa s named Tupa-Yuari, Royal Axe (Fig. 137a). But was it a weap on or a tool? To find an answer, we go to ancient Egypt. The Egyp tian term for \"gods, divine\" was Neteru, \"Guardians.\" Th at however was exactly the term by which Sumer (actually, Shum er) was called—\"Land of the Guardians\"; and in early transl ations of biblical and pseudo-biblical texts into Greek, the term Nefilim (alias Anunnaki) was rendered \"Guardians.\" The hier oglyph for this term was an axe (Fig. 137b); E. A. Wallis Budge (The Gods of the Egyptians) in a special chapter titled \"The Axe As a Symbol of God\" concluded that it was made of metal. He men- tioned that the symbol (as the term Neter) was prob ably bor- rowed from the Sumerians. That it was indeed so can be gleaned from Fig. 133. Thus was Andean civilization launched: by giving An dean Man an axe with which to mine the gods' gold. The tales of Manco Capac and the Ayar brothers in al l prob- ability also mark the end of the Mesopotamian and g old phases of Tiahuanacu.

T here could be and probably was a route via the Ancient Empire and the Urubamba river, as suggested by the megalithic site s and the discovery of a lump of pure tin at Machu Picchu. Th is route led to the Amazon and the northeastern tip of South Ame rica, thence across the Atlantic to West Africa and the M editerra- nean. And then, once Mesoamerica attained a modicum of ci vi- lized settlements, a third and quicker alternative was offered by its narrow neck that provided a virtual land-bridge between the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic via the Caribbean Sea —a route essentially followed, in reverse, by the conquistad ores. This third route, that of the Olmec civilization, m ust have become the preferred route after 2000 B.C., as evid enced by the presence of Mediterraneans; for, in 2024 B.C. the A nunnaki led by Ninurta, fearing that the spaceport in the Sinai would be overrun by followers of Marduk, destroyed it with n uclear weapons. Unstoppable, the deadly nuclear cloud drifted eastw ard to- ward southern Mesopotamia, devastating Sumer and it s last capital. Ur. As though fate had decreed it, the clo ud drifted southward, sparing Babylon; and losing no time, Mard uk marched in with an army of Canaanite and Amorite fo llowers, declaring kingship in Babylon. It was then, we believe, that the decision was made to grant the African followers of Thoth/Quetzalcoatl civiliz ation in his Mesoamerican realm. One of the rare academic studies admitting that the Olmecs were negroid Africans was Africa and the Discovery of America by Leo Wiener, professor of Slavic and other langua ges at Har- vard University. Based on racial features and other considera- tions but mostly on linguistic analysis, he conclud ed that the Olmec tongue belonged to the Mande group of languag es that originated in West Africa, between the Niger and Co ngo river. But writing in 1920, before the true age of Olmec r emains be- came known, he attributed their presence in Mesoame rica to Arab seafarers and slave traders in the Middle Ages . More than half a century had to pass before another major academic study, Unexpected Faces in Ancient America by Alex- ander von Wuthenau, tackled the problem head on.

Ivan van Sertima, whose study They Came Before Columbus set out to bridge the half-century gap between the two previous academic works, tended toward the Kushite solution: it was when the black kings of Kush ascen ded the throne of Egypt as its twenty-fifth dynasty in the eighth century B.C., trading in silver and bronze, that they—proba bly as a re- sult of shipwrecks—also held sway in Mesoamerica. This conclusion was prompted by the notion that the giant Olmec heads were from about that time; but now we k now that Olmec beginnings go back to circa 2000 B.C. Who, th en, were these Africans? We hold that Leo Wiener's linguistic studies have b een cor- rect, but not so his time frame.

Nigeria has been renowned for its bronze figurines— cast in the telltale Lost Wax process—for millennia ; recent re- search has carbon-dated some of the sites, in which the most ancient ones have been found to date to about 2100 B.C.

In time, as we have shown, these operations and the miners, the Olmecs, moved south, first to Mexico's Pacific shores, then across the isthmus into northern South America. The ir ultimate destination was the Chavin area; there they met the gold miners of Adad, the people of the golden wand. The golden age of the New Realms did not last foreve r.
