The human experience of Divine Encounters as record ed in scriptures and texts from the ancient Near East is a most amazing and fascinating saga. It is a powerful dram a that spans Heaven and Earth, involving worship and devot ion, eternity and morality on the one hand, and love and sex, jealousy and murder on the other; ascents unto spac e and journeys to the Netherworld. A stage on which the a ctors are gods and goddesses, angels and demigods, Earthlings and androids; a drama expressed in prophecies and visio ns, in dreams and omens and oracles and revelations. It is a story of Man, separated from his Creator, seeking to rest ore a pri- meval umbilical cord and, by so doing, reach for th e stars. Divine Encounters are the ultimate human experience per- haps because they were also the very first human ex perience; for when God created Man, Man met God at the very m oment of being created. We read in Genesis, the first boo k of the Hebrew Bible, how the first human, \"The Adam,\" was brought into being: And God said: Let us make Man in our image, after our likeness ... 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"2 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS And God created the Adam in His image, in the image of Elohim created He him. We can only surmise that the newborn, at the moment of being brought forth, was hardly aware of the nat ure and significance of that first Divine Encounter. Nor, i t appears, was The Adam fully aware of an ensuing crucial enco unter, when the Lord God (in the creation version attribut ed to Yahweh) decided to create a female mate for The Ada m: And Yahweh Elohim caused a deep sleep to fall upon the Adam, and he slept. And he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead of it. And Yahweh Elohim formed the rib which He had taken from the Adam into a woman. The first man was thus deeply anesthetized during t he pro- ceedings, and therefore oblivious to this crucial D ivine En- counter in which the Lord Yahweh displayed his surg ical talents. But The Adam was soon informed of what had hap- pened, for the Lord God \"brought the woman unto the man\" and introduced her to him. The Bible then offers a few words of commentary on why men and women become \"one fles h'' as they marry and ends the tale with the observatio n that both the man and his wife \"were naked, but were not ashamed.\" While the situation seemed not to bother the First Matchmaker, why does the Bible imply otherwise? If the other creatures roaming in the Garden of Eden, \"the beasts of the field and the fowl of the skies,\" were unclo thed, what on Earth should have caused (but did not) Adam and Eve to be ashamed of being naked? Was it because the ones in whose image the Adam was created were wearing cloth ing? It is a point to be kept in mind—a clue, an inadver tent clue provided by the Bible, regarding the identity of th e Elohim. No one after Adam and Eve could attain the experien ce of being the first humans on Earth, with the attendant first Di- vine Encounters. But what has ensued in the Garden of Eden"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The First Encounters 3 has endured as part of human yearning unto our own days. Even chosen Prophets must have longed to be so priv ileged, for it was there, in the Garden of Eden, that God s poke direcdy to the first human beings, instructing them regarding their nourishment: They can eat of all the garden's fruits, except the fruit of the Tree of Knowing. The chain of events leading to the Expulsion from P aradise raises a lasting question: How did Adam and Eve hea r God— how does God communicate with humans at such, or an y, Divine Encounters? Can the humans see the divine sp eaker, or just hear the message? And how is the message co n- veyed—face-to-face? Telepathically? In a holographi c vision? Through the medium of dreams? We shall examine the ancient evidence for the answe rs. But as far as the events in the Garden of Eden are concerned, the biblical text suggests a physical divine presen ce. The place was not a human habitat; rather, it was a div ine abode, an orchard deliberately planted \"in Eden, in the ea st,\" where God \"put the Adam whom He had fashioned\" to serve a s a gardener, \"to till it and to keep it.\" It is in this garden that Adam and Eve, through the inter- vention of the Divine Serpent, discover their sexua lity after eating of the fruit of the Tree of Knowing that \"ma kes one wise.\" Having eaten the forbidden fruit, \"they knew that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.\" Now the Lord God—Yahweh Elohim in the Hebrew Bible—enters the stage: And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day; And Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. God is physically present in the Garden of Eden, an d the sound of his strolling about the garden can be hear d by the humans. Can they see the deity? The biblical narrat ive is silent on the issue; it makes clear, however, that God can see them—or, in this instance, was expecting to see the m but"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS could not because they were hiding. So God used his voice to reach them: \"And the Lord God called unto the Ad am, and said unto him: Where art thou?\" A dialogue (or more correctly a trialogue) ensues. The tale raises many issues of great import. It suggests tha t The Adam could talk from the very beginning; it brings up th e question of how—in what tongue—did God and Man converse. For the moment let us just pursue the biblical tale: Ad am's expla- nation, that he hid on hearing God's approach \"beca use I am naked\" leads to the questioning of the human pair b y the deity. In the full-scale conversation that follows the truth comes out and the sin of eating the forbidden fruit is admitted (though only after Adam and Eve blame the Serpent f or the deed). The Lord God then declares the punishment: m e woman shall bear children in pain, The Adam shall h ave to toil for his food and earn his bread by the sweat o f his brow. By this time the encounter is clearly face-to-face, for now the Lord God not only makes skin-coats for Adam and his wife, but also clothes them with the coats. Althoug h the tale undoubtedly is intended to impress upon the reader the sig- nificance of being clothed as a \"divine\" or major d ividing element between humans and beasts, the biblical pas sage can- not be treated as only symbolical. It clearly lets us know that in the beginning, when The Adam was in the Garden o f Eden, humans encountered their Creator face-to-face . Now, unexpectedly, God gets worried. Speaking again to unnamed colleagues, Yahweh Elohim expresses his con cern that \"now that the Adam has become as one of us, to know good and evil, what if he shall put forth his hand and also take of the Tree of Life, and eat, and live forever ?\" The shift of focus is so sudden that its significan ce has been easily lost. Dealing with Man—his creation, pr ocreation, abode, and transgression—the Bible abruptly echoes the con- cerns of the Lord. In the process, the almost-divin e nature of Man is highlighted once more. The decision to creat e The Adam stems from a suggestion to fashion him \"in the image and after the likeness\" of the divine creators. The resulting being, the handiwork of the Elohim, is brought fort h \"in the image of Elohim.\" And now, having eaten the fruit o f Know- ing, Man has become godlike in one more crucial res pect."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The First Encounters 5 Looking at it from the viewpoint of the deity, \"the Adam has become as one of us\" except for Immortality. An d so the other unnamed colleagues of Yahweh concur in th e deci- sion to expel Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, plac- ing Cherubim with a \"revolving flaming sword\" to bl ock the humans' way back if they ever tried. Thus did Man's very Creator decree Man's mortality. But Man, undaunted, has searched for immortality ever s ince through the medium of Divine Encounters. Is this yearning for Encounters based on a recollec tion of real happenings, or an illusionary search based on mere myths? How much of the biblical tales is fact, how much fiction? The diverse versions relating the creation of the f irst hu- mans, and the alternating between a plural Elohim ( deities) and a single Yahweh as the creator(s), have been ju st one of the indications that the editors or redactors of th e Hebrew Bible had in front of them some earlier texts deali ng with the subject. Indeed, chapter 5 of Genesis begins by stating that its brief record of the generations that follo wed Adam is based on \"the Book of the Generations of Adam\" (sta rting from \"the day Elohim had created Adam in the likene ss of Elohim\"). Verse 14 in Numbers 21 refers to the Book of the Wars of Yahweh. Joshua 10:13 refers the reader for more details of miraculous events to the Book of Jashar, which is also listed as a known source text in II Samuel 1:1 8. These are but passing references to what must have been a much more extensive trove of earlier texts. The veracity of the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament)—be it its tales of Creation, of the Deluge and Noah's Ark , of the Patriarchs, of the Exodus—has come into doubting cr iticism in the nineteenth century. Much of that skepticism and disbe- lief has been muted and countered by archaeological discov- eries that increasingly validated me biblical recor d and data in an ever-receding order—from the near past to the earlier times, carrying the corroboration farther and farth er back through historical times to prehistorical ones.

How ever, unencumberd by the monotheistic constraints of the Hebrew Bible, the writings of Israel's neighbors in the an cient Near East spelled out the identities and names of the \"u s\" of the biblical Elohim. In doing so, such writings paint a panorama of prehistoric times and raise the curtain on a fas cinating record of gods and humans in a series of varied Div ine Encounters. Until the start of purposeful archaeological excava tions in Mesopotamia, \"The Land Between the Rivers\" (the Tig ris and Euphrates) some 150 years ago, the Old Testamen t was the sole source of information on the Assyrian and Babylo- nian empires, their great cities and haughty kings. As earlier scholars pondered the veracity of the biblical data concerning the existence of such empires three thousand years ago, their credulity was stretched even more by the biblical a ssertion that Kingship began even earlier, with a \"mighty hu nter by the grace of Yaweh\" called Nimrod, and that there h ad been royal capitals (and thus an advanced civilization) in the dis- tant past in \"the Land of Shine'ar.\" This assertion was linked to me even more incredible tale of the Tower of Bab el (Gene- sis chapter 11) when Mankind, using clay bricks, em barked on the erection of a ' 'tower whose head can reach the heav- ens.\" The place was a plain in the \"Land of Shine'a r.\" That \"mythical\" land has been found, its cities une arthed by archaeologists, its language and texts deciphere d thanks to the knowledge of Hebrew and thus of its parent t ongue, Akkadian, its monuments and sculptures and artworks treas- ured in major world museums.

It is to ancient Sumer that we have to go t o under- stand the biblical tale of Creation and the ancient Near Eastern record of Divine Encounters; for it is ther e, in Sumer, that the recording of those events began. Sumer (the biblical Shine'ar) was the land where th e first known and fully documented civilization sprang up a fter the Deluge, appearing suddenly and all at once some six thousand years ago. It gave Humankind almost every \"first\" i n all that matters as integral components of a high civilizati on—not just the first brickmaking (as mentioned above) and the first kilns, but also the first high-rise temples and pal aces, the first priests and kings; the first wheel, the first kiln, the first medi- cine and pharmacology; the first musicians and danc ers, arti- sans and craftsmen, merchants and caravaneers, law codes and judges, weights and measures. The first astrono mers and observatories were there, and the first mathematici ans. And perhaps most important of all: it was there, as ear ly as 3800 B.C., that writing began, making Sumer the land of the first scribes who wrote down on clay tablets in the wedge like script (\"cuneiform\") the most astounding tales of g ods and humans (as this \"Creation of Man\" tablet, Fig. 1). Scholars regard these ancient texts as myths. We, however, c onsider them to be records of events that have essentially happened. The archaelogists' spades not only verified the exi stence of Shine'ar/Sumer. The finds also brought to light ancient texts from Mesopotamia that paralleled the biblical tales of Creation and the Deluge. In 1876 George Smith of th e British Museum, piecing together broken tablets found in th e royal library of Nineveh (the Assyrian capital), publishe d The Chal- dean Genesis and showed beyond doubt that the bibli cal tale of Creation was first written down in Mesopotamia m illennia of years earlier. In 1902 L.W. King, also of the British Museum, in h is book The Seven Tablets of Creation, published a ful ler text, in the Old Babylonian language, that required seven clay tablets—so long and detailed it was. Known as the E pic of Creation or as Enuma elish by its opening words, it s first six tablets describe the creation of the heavens and th e Earth and all upon Earth, including Man, paralleling the six \"days\" of"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Figure I creation in the Bible.

History, as t he great scholar Samuel N. Kramer has so excellently expound ed in his 1959 book of that title, Begins at Sumer. It all began, we learn from the various texts, a ve ry long time ago, with the splashing down in the waters of the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea of a group of fifty ANUNNAK I— a term literally meaning \"Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came.\" They waded ashore under the leadership of E.

As the expedition expande d and the operations were set in motion, Ea acquired the addi tional title or epithet EN.KI—\"Lord of Earth.\" But all did not go well. The home planet (called NI BIRU) was not receiving the required gold. A change of pl ans was soon decided, calling for the obtainment of the gol d the hard way, by mining it in the AB.ZU—southeastern Africa. More Anunnaki arrived on Earth (in the end they numbered 600); another group, the IGI.GI (\"Those Who Observe and S ee\") remained skyborne, operating shuttlecraft and space craft and space stations (they numbered, Sumerian texts asser t, 300 in all). To make sure there were no failures this time , ANU (\"The Heavenly One\"), ruler of Nibiru, sent to Eart h a half brother of Enki/Ea, EN.LIL (\"Lord of the Command\"). He was a strict disciplinarian and a firm administrato r; and while Enki was sent to oversee the mining of gold ores in the Abzu, Enlil took over command of the seven Cities of the Gods in the E.DIN (\"Home of the Righteous Ones\"), the place where more than 400,000 years later the Sumerian civiliza tion blo- soomed out. Each such city was assigned specialized func- tions: a Mission Control Center, a Spaceport, a cen ter for metallurgy; even a medical center under the supervi sion of NIN.MAH (\"Great Lady\"), a half sister of both Enki and Enlil. The evidence, presented and analyzed by us in books I-V of The Earth Chronicles series and the companion bo ok Gen- esis Revisited, indicated a vast elliptical orbit f or Nibiru that lasts 3,600 Earth-years, a period called SAR in Sum erian. Sumerian records of prehistoric times, called King Lists, mea- sured the passage of time as applied to the Anunnak i in Sars.

Therein, in the Sars, lies the secret to the appare nt immor- tality of the ancient \"gods.\" A year, by definition , is the time it takes the planet one lives on to complete o ne orbit around the Sun. The orbit of Nibiru lasts 3,600 Ear th-years; but for those who live on Nibiru, that amounts to o nly one of their years. The Sumerian and other Near Eastern texts speak of both the birth and the death of those \"god s\"; except that, in the eyes of the Earthlings (for that, lite rally, is what Adam—\"He of Earth\"—meant in Hebrew), the life cycle s of the Anunnaki were such that, in human terms, the y were immortal for all practical purposes. The Anunnaki arrived on Earth 120 Sars before the D el- uge—432,000 Earth-years before that avalanche of wa ter that was a watershed event in more than physical ways. M an, The Adam, was not yet on Earth when the Anunnaki arrive d. For forty Sars the Anunnaki who were sent to the Abzu t oiled mining the gold; but then they mutinied. A text in Akkadian (the mother tongue of Babylonian, Assyrian, and Heb rew) called Atra Hasis describes the mutiny and the reas ons for it in vivid detail. Enlil called for disciplinary meas ures to force the Anunnaki to continue toiling and to punish the mutiny's instigators. Enki was for leniency. Anu was consult ed; he sympathized with the mutineers. How was the impasse to be resolved? Enki, the scientist, had a solution. Let us create a Primitive Worker, he said, that will take over the backbreaki ng toil. The other leaders of the Anunnaki present wondered: How can it be done, how can an Adamu be created? To whi ch Enki gave this answer: The creature whose name you uttered, it exists!

The assembled gods—the Anunnaki leaders—agreed en- thusiastically. On Enki's suggestion they summoned Ninmah, the Chief Medical Officer, to assist in the task. \" You are the midwife of the gods,\" they said to her—\"Create Mank ind! Create a Mixed One that he may bear the yoke, let h im bear the yoke assigned by Enlil, let the Primitive Worke r toil for the gods!\" In Chapter 1 of Genesis the discussion that led to this decision is summed up in one verse: \"And Elohim sai d: Let us make the Adam in our image, after our likeness.\" And, with the implied consent of the assembled \"us,\" the task was carried out: \"And Elohim created the Adam in His im age; in the image of Elohim created He him.\" The term image—the element or process by which the existing \"creature\" could be raised to the level de sired by the Anunnaki, akin to them except for Knowing and L ongev- ity—can best be understood by realizing who or what the existing \"creature\" was. As other texts (e.g. one t hat scholars title The Myth of Cattle and Grain) explain, When Mankind was first created They knew not the eating of bread, knew not the wearing of garments. They ate plants with their mouths, like sheep; They drank water from the ditch. This is a fitting description of hominids roaming w ildly as, and with, other beasts. Sumerian depictions, engrav ed on stone cylinders (so-called \"cylinder seals\") show s uch homi- nids mingling with animals but standing erect on tw o feet— an illustration (regrettably ignored by modern scie ntists) of a Homo erectus (Fig. 2). It was upon that Being, that already existed, that Enki had suggested to \"bind upon it t he image of the gods,\" and create through genetic engineerin g an Earth ling, Homo sapiens.

It was a creative process not without frustrating tria ls and errors until the procedure was perfected and the desired r esult was attained by Enki and Ninmah (whom some texts, in ho nor of her memorable role, granted her the epithet NIN.TI— \"Lady of Life\"). Working in a laboratory called Bit Shimti—\"House wh ere the wind of life is breathed in\"—the \"essence\" of t he blood of a young Anunnaki male was mixed with the egg of a female hominid. The fertilized egg was then inserte d into the womb of a female Anunnaki. When, after a tense wait ing period, a \"Model Man\" was born, Ninmah held the new born baby up and shouted: \"I have created! My hands have made it!\" Sumerian artists depicted on a cylinder seal that b reathtak- ing final moment, when Ninmah/Ninti held up the new Being for all to see (Fig. 3). Thus, captured in an engra ving on a small stone cylinder, is a pictorial record of the first Divine Encounter! In ancient Egypt, where the gods were called Neteru (\"Guardians\") and identified by the hieroglyphic sy mbol of a mining axe, the act of creating the first Man out of clay was attributed to the ram-headed god Khnemu (\"He wh o 12 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The First Encounters 13 Figure 4 joins\"), of whom the texts said that he was \"the ma ker of men . . . the father who was in the beginning.\" Egy ptian artists too, as the Sumerians before them, depicted pictorially the moment of the First Encounter (Fig. 4); it show ed Khnemu holding up the newly created being, assisted by his son Thoth (the god of science and medicine).

Preparing more mix- tures of TI.IT—\"That which is with life,\" the bibli cal \"clay\"—genetically engineered to produce Primitive Work- ers of both sexes, Ninmah placed seven lumps of the \"clay\" in a \"male mould\" and seven in a \"female mould.\" Th e fertilized eggs were then implanted in the wombs of female Anunnaki \"birth goddesses.\" It was to this process of bring- ing forth seven male and seven female \"Mixed Ones\" at each shift that the \"Elohist Version\" (as scholars call it) in Genesis referred when it stated that when Humankind was created by Elohim, \"male and female created He them .\" But, like any hybrid (such as a mule, the result of the mating of a horse and a she-ass), the \"Mixed Ones\" could not procreate. The biblical tale of how the new bei ng acquired \"Knowing,\" the ability to procreate in biblical ter minology, covers with an allegorical veneer the second act of genetic engineering. The principal actor in the dramatic de velopment is neither Yahweh-Elohim nor the created Adam and E ve, but the Serpent, the instigator of the crucial biol ogical change. The Hebrew word for \"serpent\" in Genesis is Nahash. The term, however, had two additional meanings. It could mean \"He who knows or solves secrets\"; it could als o mean \"He of the copper.\" The last two meanings appear to have stemmed from the Sumerian epithel for Enki, BUZUR, which meant both \"He who solves secrets\" and \"He of the m etal mines.\" Indeed, the frequent Sumerian symbol for En ki was that of a serpent. In an earlier work (Genesis Revi sited) we have suggested that the associated symbol of Entwin ed Ser- pents (Fig. 5a), from which the symbol for healing has re- mained to this day, was inspired—already in ancient Sumer!—by the double helix DNA (Fig. 5b) and thus o f genetic engineering. As we shall show later on, Enk i's use of genetic engineering in the Garden of Eden also l ed to the double helix motif in Tree of life depictions. Enki bequeathed this knowledge and its symbol to his son Ningishzid da (Fig. 5c), whom we have identified as the Egyptian god Th oth; the Greeks called him Hermes; his staff bore the emblem of the Entwined Serpents (Fig. 5d).

It is nothing short of mind-boggling to realize tha t this second Divine Encounter, when Humankind was given t he ability to procreate, was also captured for us by a ncient \"pho- tographers\"—artists who carved the scene in reverse on the small stone cylinders, images that were seen in pos itive after the seal was rolled on wet clay. But such depiction s too, in addition to the ones depicting the creation of The Adam, have been found. One shows \"Adam\" and \"Eve\" seated, flan king a tree, and the serpent behind Eve (Fig. 6a).

Ask anyone where Adam was created, and the answer w ill in all probability be: In the Garden of Eden. But i t is not there where the story of Humankind begins. The Mesopotamian tale, first recorded by the Sumeri ans, places the first phase at a location \"above the Abz u\"—far- ther north than where the gold mines were. As sever al groups of \"Mixed Ones\" were brought forth and pressed into service for the purpose for which they were created—to take over the toil in the mines—the Anunnaki from the seven settl ements in the E.DIN clamored for such helpers too. As those i n south- eastern Africa resisted, a fight broke out. A text which schol- ars call The Myth of the Pickax describes how, led by Enlil, the Anunnaki from the E.DIN forcefully seized some of \"the Created Ones\" and brought them over to Eden, to ser ve the Anunnaki there. The text called The Myth of Cattle and Grain explicitly states that \"when from the heights of He aven to Earth Anu had caused the Anunnaki to come,\" grains that vegetate, lambs and kids were not yet brought forth . Even after the Anunnaki in their \"creation chamber\" had fashioned food for themselves, they were not satiated. It was only After Anu, Enlil, Enki and Ninmah had fashioned the black-headed people, Vegetation that is fruitful they multiplied in the land . . . In the Edin they placed them. The Bible, contrary to general assumptions, relates the same tale. As in the Enuma elish, the biblical sequ ence (chap- ter 2 of Genesis) is, first, the forming of the Hea vens and of Earth; next, the creation of The Adam (the Bible do es not state where). The Elohim then \"planted a garden in Eden, eastward\" (of where the Adam was created); and only there- after did the Elohim \"put there\" (in the Garden of Eden) \"the Adam whom he had fashioned.\" And Yahweh Elohim took the Adam, and placed him in the Garden of Eden to till it and to keep it."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"18 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS An interesting light is shed on the \"Geography of C re- ation\" (to coin a term) and, consequently on the in itial Divine Encounters, by the Book of Jubilees.

The name B ook of Jubilees, applied to the work by its Greek trans lators, stems from the chronological structure of the book, which is based on a count of the years by \"jubilees\" whose years a re called \"days\" and \"weeks.\" Obviously drawing on sources that were available at the time (in addition to the canonical Genesis), such a s the books that the Bible mentions and other texts that Mesopo tamian libraries cataloged but which are yet to be found, the Book of Jubilees, using the enigmatic count of \"days,\" s tates that Adam was brought by the angels into the Garden of E den only \"after Adam had completed forty days in the la nd where he had been created\"; and \"his wife they brought in on the eightieth day.\" Adam and Eve, in other words, were brought into being elsewhere. The Book of Jubilees, dealing with the expulsion fr om Eden later on, provides another morsel of valuable informa- tion. It informs us that \"Adam and his wife went fo rth from the Garden of Eden, and they dwelt in the Land of N ativity, the land of their creation.\" In other words, from t he Edin they went back to the Abzu, in southeastern Africa. Only there, in the second Jubilee, did Adam \"know\" his w ife Eve and \"in the third week in the second jubilee she ga ve birth to Cain, and in the fourth she gave birth to Abel, and in the fifth she gave birth to a daughter, Awan.\" (The Bib le states that Adam and Eve had thereafter other sons and dau ghters; noncanonical books say that they numbered sixty-thr ee in all.)

Not only finds of fossil remains of the earliest hominids, but also genetic evidence concerning the final line of Homo sapiens, confirms southeast Africa as the place where Humankind originated. And as to Homo sapiens, anthropological and genetic researche rs have placed an \"Eve\"—a single female of whom all of pres ent day humans stem—in the same area at about 250,000 y ears ago. (This finding, at first based on DNA that is p assed only by the mother, has been corroborated in 1994 by gen etic research based on Nuclear DNA that is passed from b oth parents and expanded in 1995 to include an \"Adam\" c irca 270,000 years ago.) It was from there that the vari ous branches of Homo sapiens (Neanderthals, Cro-Magnons ) later arrived in Asia and Europe. That the biblical Eden was one and the same place s ettled by the Anunnaki and the one to which they brought o ver Primitive Workers from the Abzu, is almost self-evi dent lin- guistically. The name Eden, hardly anyone now doubt s, stemmed from the Sumerian E.DIN via the intermediar y of the Edinnu in Akkadian (the mother tongue of Assyri an, Bab- ylonian, and Hebrew). Moreover, in describing the p rofusion of waters in that Paradise (an impressive aspect fo r readers in a part of the Near East wholly dependent on rain s in a short winter season), the Bible offered several geo graphical indicators that also pointed to Mesopotamia; it sta ted that the Garden of Eden was located at the head of a body of water mat served as the confluence of four rivers: And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; And from there it was parted and became four principal streams.

And the name of the third river is Hiddekel, the one that flows east of Assyria. And the fourth is the Prath. Clearly, two of the Rivers of Paradise, the Hiddeke l and the Prath, are the two major rivers of Mesopotamia (that gave the land its name, which means \"The Land Between th e Rivers\"), the Tigris and Euphrates as they are call ed in English. There is complete agreement between all sc holars that the biblical names for these two rivers stem f rom their Sumerian names (via the intermediary Akkadian): Idi lbat and Purannu. Though the two rivers take separate courses, at som e points almost coming together, at others separating substa ntially, they both originate in the mountains of Anatolia, n orth of Mesopotamia; and since this is where the headwaters are as riverine science holds, scholars have been searchin g for the other two rivers at that \"headpoint.\" But no suitab le candi- dates for the Gihon and Pishon as two more rivers f lowing from that mountain range and meeting the other qual ifications have been found. The search, therefore, spread to m ore distant lands. Kush has been taken to mean Ethiopia or Nubi a in Africa, and the Gihon (\"The Gusher\") to be the Nile River with its several cataracts. A favorable guess for P ishon (possi- bly \"The one who had come to rest\") has been the In dus River, equating therefore Havilah with the Indian s ubconti- nent, or even with landlocked Luristan. The problem with such suggestions is that neither the Nile nor the I ndus con- fluates with the Tigris and Euphrates of Mesopotami a. The names Kush and Havilah are found in the Bible m ore than once, both as geographical terms and as names of nation- states. In the Table of Nations (Genesis chapter 10 ) Havilah is listed together with Seba, Sabtha, Raamah, Sabte cha, Sheba, and Dedan. They were all nation-lands which various biblical passages linked with the tribes of Ishmael , the son of Abraham by the handmaiden Hagar, and there is no doubt that their domains were in Arabia. These traditions have been"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The First Encounters 21 corroborated by modern researchers that have identi fied the tribal locations throughout Arabia. Even the name H agar was found to be the name of an ancient city in eastern Arabia. An updated study by E.A. Knauf (Ismael, 1985) concl usively deciphered the name Havilah as the Hebrew for \"Sand Land,\" and identified it as the geographic name for south- ern Arabia. The problem with such convincing conclusions has be en that no river in Arabia could qualify as the biblic al river Pishon, if for no other reason than the simple fact that the whole of Arabia is arid, a huge desert land. Could the Bible be so wrong? Could the whole tale o f the Garden of Eden, and thus of the events and Divine E ncoun- ters in it, be just a myth? Starting with a firm belief in the veracity of the Bible, the following question came to our mind: Why does the b iblical narrative go to relatively great lengths to describ e the geogra- phy and mineralogy of the land (Havilah) where the Pishon was; list the land and describe the circular course of the Gihon River; merely identify the location (\"east of Assyria\") of the Hiddekel; and just name the fourth river, Pr ath, without any additional identifying landmarks? Why this desc ending order of information? The answer that had occurred to us was that while t here was no need whatsoever to tell the reader of Genesi s where the Euphrates was, and a mere mention of Assyria wa s enough to identify the Tigris (Hiddekel) River, it was neces- sary to explain that the Gihon—evidently, a lesser- known river by then—was the river that encompassed the la nd of Kush; and that the apparently totally unknown river Pishon was in a land called Havilah, which, devoid of land marks, was identified by the products that came from it. These thoughts began to make sense when, in the lat e 1980s, it was announced that scanning of the Sahara desert (in North Africa, in western Egypt) with soil-penet rating radar from Earth-orbiting satellites and with other instruments aboard the space shuttle Columbia, revealed under l ayers of desert sand dry beds of rivers that once flowed in this region. Subsequent research on the ground established that the area was well watered, with major rivers and many tribut aries,"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"22 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS since perhaps 200,000 years ago and until about 4,0 00 years ago, when the climate changed. The discovery in the Sahara desert made us wonder: Could the same have happened in the Arabian desert? Could it be that when the version in chapter 2 of Genesis was w ritten— obviously at a time when Assyria was already known— the Pishon River had entirely vanished under the sands as the climate changed in past millennia? Confirmation of the validity of this line of reason ing took place quite dramatically in March 1993. It was an a nnounce- ment by Farouk El-Baz, director of the Center for R emote Sensing at Boston University, concerning the discov ery of a lost river under the sands of the Arabian peninsula —a river that flowed for more than 530 miles from the mounta ins of western Arabia all the way eastward to the Persian Gulf. There it formed a delta that covered much of today' s Kuwait and reached as far as the present-day city of Basra , merg- ing—\"confluing\"—there with the Tigris and Euphrates riv- ers. It was a river that was about fifty feet deep throughout its entire length and more than three miles wide at som e points. After the last Ice Age, between 11,000 and 6,000 ye ars ago, the Boston University study concluded, the Ara bian cli- mate was wet and rainy enough to support such a riv er. But some 5,000 years ago the river dried up because of climatic changes that resulted in the aridity and desertlike conditions in the peninsula. In time, wind-driven sand dunes c overed the river's channel, obliterating all evidence of t he once- mighty river. High-resolution imaging by Landsat sa tellites, however, revealed that the dune patterns changed as the sand crossed a line that extended for hundreds of miles, a line that ended in mystifying deposits of gravel in Kuwait an d near Basra—gravel of rocks that came from the Hijaz Moun tains in western Arabia. Ground-level inspections then co nfirmed the existence of the ancient river (Fig. 7). Dr. El-Baz has given the lost river the name Kuwait River. We suggest that it was called Pishon in antiquity, cutting across the Arabian peninsula that indeed was an anc ient source of gold and precious stones.

The Mesopotamian Kush was in all probability east of Sumer, the area of the Zagros M ountains. It was the homeland of the Kushshu people, the Akka dian name for the Kassites, who in the second millennium B . C . swept down from the Zagros Mountains and occupied B aby- lon. The ancient name was retained as Kushan for th e district of Susa (the \"Shushan\" of the biblical Book of Esth er) well into Persian and even Roman times. There are several noteworthy rivers in that part of the Zagros Mountains, but they have not caught the atte ntion of scholars because none of them share headwaters with the Tigris and Euphrates (which begin hundreds of miles to the northeast). Here, however, another thought came int o play: Could the ancients have spoken of rivers that join together not at their headwaters, but at their confluence in to the Per- sian Gulf? If so, the Gihon—the fourth river of Ede n—would have been a river that joins the Tigris, the Euphra tes, and the newly discovered \"Kuwait River\" at the head of the Persian Gulf!

It is the Karun River, wh ich is indeed the major river of the ancient land of Kushs hu. Some five hundred miles in length, it forms an unusual l oop, start- ing its tortuous flow in the Zardeh-Kuh range in wh at is now southwestern Iran. Instead of flowing down south to the Per- sian Gulf, it flows \"upward\" (as one looks at a mod ern map) in a northwesterly direction, through deep gorges. Then it makes a loop and begins to flow southward in a zigz agging course as it leaves the high mountains of the Zagro s range and starts a descent toward the gulf. Finally, in i ts last hun- dred miles or so, it mellows and meanders gently to ward a confluence with none other than the Tigris and Euph rates in the marshy delta they form at the head of the Persi an Gulf (the so-called Shatt-el-Arab, nowadays contested be tween Iran and Iraq). The location, the circular course, the gushing, the conflu- ence with the other three rivers at the head of the Persian Gulf, all suggest to us that the Karun River could well be the biblical river Gihon that circled the land of K ush. Such an identification, combined with the space-age disc overies of the major river in Arabia, by so delineating and id entifying the location of the Garden of Eden in southern Meso potamia, confirm the physical existence of such a place and form a sound foundation of fact, not myth, under the relat ed tales of Divine Encounters. Confirmation of southern Mesopotamia, ancient Sumer , as the E.DIN, the original biblical Eden, does more th an create a geographic congruency between the Sumerian texts and the biblical narrative. It also identifies the group wi th whom Hu- mankind had Divine Encounters. The E.DIN was the ab ode (\"E\") of the DIN (\"The Righteous/Divine Ones\"). The ir full title was DIN.GIR, meaning \"The Righteous Ones of the Rocketships,\" and was written pictographically as a two- stage rocket whose command module could separate fo r land- ing (Fig. 8a).

Instead, the Expulsion was only the start of a new phase in that relations hip that can be characterized as hide-and-seek, in which direct encounters become rare and visions or dreams become divine dev ices. The beginning of this post-Paradise relationship wa s far from auspicious; it was, in fact, a most tragic one . Uninten- tionally it brought about the emergence of new huma ns, Homo sapiens sapiens.

It was about Divine Enco un- ters ...

And Abel became a shepherd of flocks and Cain a tiller of the land. Thus, in just two verses, does the Bible introduce the reader to the entirely new phase of human experienc e and sets the stage for the next Divine Encounter. In sp ite of the seeming break between God and Man, Yahweh is still watch- ing over Humankind. Somehow—the Bible does not elab orate how—grains and cattle have been domesticated, with Cain becoming a farmer and Abel a shepherd. The brothers ' first act is to offer the first fruits and yearlings to Y ahweh in gratitude. The act implies a recognition that it wa s thanks to the deity that the two ways of obtaining food becam e feasible. The privilege of a Divine Encounter was expected; b ut— Yahweh paid heed unto Abel and his offering; unto Cain and his offering He paid no heed. So Cain was very resentful and his countenance was sullen. Perhaps alarmed by this development, the deity spea ks, directly, to Cain, trying to dissipate his anger an d disappoint- ment. But to no avail; when the two brothers were a lone in the field, \"Cain came upon his brother Abel and kil led him.\" Yahweh was soon demanding an accounting from Cain. \"What hast thou done?\" the Lord cried out in anger and despair; \"the voice of thy brother's blood cries un to me from the ground!\" Cain is punished to become a wanderer upon the Earth; but the Earth too is accursed, to cease its fertility. Recog- nizing the magnitude of his crime, Cain is afraid o f being killed by unnamed avengers. \"So Yahweh put a mark on Cain, so that whoever shall find him should not smite him.\" What was this \"mark of Cain\"? The Bible does not sa y, and countless guesses are just that—guesses. Our ow n guess (in The Lost Realms) was that the mark might have b een a genetic change, such as depriving the line of Cain of facial hair—a mark that would be immediately obvious to wh oever shall find them. Since this is a mark of recognitio n of Amer- indians, we have suggested that since Cain \"went aw ay from"},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"When Paradise Was Lost 31 the presence of Yahweh and resided in the Land of N od, east of Eden,\" his wanderings took him and his offspring farther into Asia and the Far East, in time crossing the Pa cific to settle in Mesoamerica. When his wanderings ended, C ain had a son whom he named Enoch and built a city \"called by the name of his son.\" We have pointed out that Aztec le gends called their capital Tenochtitlan, \"City of Tenoch, \" in honor of ancestors who came from the Pacific. Since they prefixed many names by the sound \"T,\" the city could have re ally been named after Enoch. Whatever the destination of Cain or the nature of t he mark were, it is clear that this final act in the Cain-A bel drama required a direct Divine Encounter, a close contact between the deity and Cain so that the \"mark\" could be empl aced. This, as the unfolding record of the relationship b etween Man and God will show, was a rare occurrence after the Expulsion from Paradise. According to Genesis it wa s not until the seventh pre-Diluvial Patriarch (in a line that began with Adam and ended with Noah) that the Elohim enga ged in a direct Divine Encounter; it had to do with Eno ch, who at age 365 (a number of years paralleling the numbe r of days in a year) \"walked with the Elohim\" and then was go ne \"for the Elohim had taken him\" to join them in thei r abode. But if God so rarely revealed himself, yet Humankin d— according to the Bible—continued to \"hear\" him, wha t were the channels of indirect encounters? To find answers regarding those early times, we hav e to fish for information in the extra-biblical books, o f which the Book of Jubilees is one. Called by scholars Pseudep jgrapha of the Old Testament, they include the Book of Adam and Eve that survived in several translated versions rangin g from Arme- nian and Slavonic to Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic ( but not the original Hebrew). According to this source, the sla ying of Abel by Cain was foretold to Eve in a dream in which she saw \"the blood of Abel being poured into the mouth of Cain h is brother.\" To prevent the dream from coming true, it was decid ed to \"make for each of them separate dwellings, and they made Cain an husbandman and Abel they made a shepherd.\" But the separation was to no avail.

And so it was that when Adam fell sick and wa s close to death, he revealed to Seth \"what I heard and saw after your mother and 1 had been driven out of paradise:\" There came to me Michael the archangel, an emissary of God. And I saw a chariot like the wind, and its wheels were as on fire. And I was carried up unto the Paradise of the Righteous Ones and I saw the Lord sitting; But his face was a flaming fire that could not be endured. Though he could not face the awesome sight, he coul d hear God's voice telling him that because he had tr ansgressed in the Garden of Eden, he was fated to die. Then th e archan- gel Michael took Adam away from the vision of Parad ise and brought him back to whence he had come. Conclud ing the account, Adam admonished Seth to avoid sin and to be righteous and to follow God's commandments and stat utes that will be delivered to Seth and his descendants when \"the Lord shall appear in a flame of fire.\" Since the death of Adam was the first natural passi ng of a mortal, Eve and Seth knew not what to do. They to ok the dying Adam and carried him to the \"region of Paradi se,\" and there sat at the Gates of Paradise until Adam's soul departed from his body. They sat bewildered, mourni ng and crying.

There is a wealth of pertinent information in this tale. It establishes prophetic dreams as a channel for divin e revela- tions, a Divine Encounter through telepathic or oth er subcon- scious means. It introduces into the realm of Divin e Encounters an intermediary: an \"angel,\" a term know n from the Hebrew Bible whose literal meaning was \"emissar y, mes- senger.\" And it also brings into play yet another f orm of Divine Encounter, that of \"visions\" in which the \"C hariot of the Lord\" is seen—an \"awesome sight\" of a \"chari ot like the wind,\" whose \"wheels were as on fire\" when seen by Adam and as a \"chariot of light, borne by four b right eagles,\" when seen by Eve. Since the Book of Adam and Eve, as the other Pseude pi- graphic books, was written in the last centuries be fore the Christian era, one could of course argue that its i nformation regarding dreams and visions could have been based on knowledge or beliefs from a much closer time to the writers than the pre-Diluvial events.

Such \"decorated caves\" as scholars call them have been found especially in the southwest of France an d the north of Spain. More than seventy such decorated ca ves have been found (one, whose entrance is now under the wa ters of the Mediterranean sea, as recently as 1993); there. Stone Age artists used the cave walls as giant canvases, some times tal- entedly using the natural contours and protrusions of the walls to attain tridimensional effects. Sometimes using s harp stones to engrave the images, sometimes clay to mold and s hape, but mostly a limited assortment of pigments—black, red, yel- low, and a dull brown—they created astoundingly bea utiful works of art. Occasionally depicting humans as hunt ers, and sometimes their hunting weapons (arrows, lances), t he depic- tions by and large are those of Ice Age animals: bi son, rein- deer, ibexes, horses, oxen, cows, felines, and here and there also fish and birds (Fig. 9).

In many instances the more complex, more vividly co lored, more lifelike depictions are in the deeper parts of the caves, which were, of course, also the darkest parts.

That she was revered already some 30,000 years ago is no won der— for the Anunnaki had been on Earth for far longer, with Ninmah/Mammi among them.

Reading the biblical and extra-biblical records in the light of Sumerian sources will add greatly to our underst anding of those prehistoric events. We have already examined such sources in respect to the tale of the creation of T he Adam and of Eve and the Garden of Eden. Let us now exami ne the Cain-Abel tragedy. Why did the two feel obliged to offer the first fruits or yearlings to Yahweh, why did he pay heed only to the offering of Abel, the shepherd, and why did the Lord then rush to appease Cain by promising him that he, Cain, would rule over Abel? The answers lie in a realization that, as in the ta le of creation, the biblical version compresses more than one Sum- erian deity into a single, monotheistic one. Sumerian texts include two that deal with disputes and conflicts between farming and shepherding. They bot h hold the key to an understanding of what had happened by going back to a time before the domestication of either g rains or cattle, a \"time when grains had not yet been brough t forth, had not yet vegetated . . . when a lamb had not yet been dropped, there was no she-goat.\" But the \"black-hea ded peo- ple\" had already been fashioned and placed in the E din; so the Anunnaki decided to give to NAM.LU.GAL.LU—\"civi - lized Mankind\"—the knowledge of and tools for \"the tilling of the land\" and the \"keeping of sheep\"; not, howev er, for the sake of Mankind but \"for the sake of the gods,\" to assure their satiation. The task of bringing forth the two forms of domesti cation fell to Enki and Enlil. They went to the DU.KU, the \"purifi- cation place,\" the \"creation chamber of the gods,\" and brought forth Lahar (\"woolly cattle\") and Anshan (\"grains\"). \"For Lahar they set up a sheepfold ... to Anshan a plough and yoke they presented.\" Sumerian cylinde r seals depicted the presentation of the first-ever plough to Mankind (Fig. 13a)—presumably by Enlil who had created Ansh an, the farmer (although a presentation by Enid's son N inurta, who was nicknamed \"the ploughman,\" should not be ru led"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"When Paradise Was Los! 39 out); and a ploughing scene in which the plough is pulled by a bull (Fig. 13b). After an initial idyllic period, Lahar and Anshan b egan to quarrel. A text named by scholars The Myth of Cattl e and Grain reveals that in spite of the effort to separa te the two by \"establishing a house,\" a settled way of life, f or Anshan (the farmer) and putting up sheepfolds in the grazi ng lands for Lahar (the shepherd), and in spite of the abund ant crops and bountiful sheepfolds, the two began to quarrel. The quar- rel began as the two offered those abundances to th e \"store- house of the gods.\" At first each just extolled his own achievements and belittled those of the other. But the argu- ment became so volatile, that both Enlil and Enki h ad to intervene. According to the Sumerian text, they dec lared An- shan—the farmer—the more surpassing. More explicit in its choice between the two food pr oducers and two ways of life is a text known as The Dispute Between Emesh an Enten, in which the two come to Enlil for a deci- sion as to who of them is the more important. Emesh is the one who \"made wide stalls and sheepfolds\"; Enten, w ho dug canals to water the lands, asserts that he is the \" farmer of the gods.\" Bringing their offerings to Enlil, each seeks to be granted primacy. Enten boasts how he made \"farm tou ch farm,\" his irrigation canals \"brought water in abun dance,\" Figures 13a and 13b"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS how he \"made grain increase in the furrows\" and be \"heaped high in the granaries.\" Emesh points out th at he \"made the ewe give birth to the lamb, the goat to g ive birth to the kid, cow and calf to multiply, fat and milk to in- crease,\" and also how he obtained eggs from nests m ade for the birds and caught fish from the sea. But Enlil rejects the pleas of Emesh, even repriman ds him: \"How could you compare yourself to your brother Ent en!\" he tells him, for it is Enten \"who is in charge of the life- producing waters of all the lands.\" And water spell s life, growth, abundance. Emesh accepts the decision, The exalted word of Enlil, whose meaning is profound; A verdict that is unalterable, no one dares transgress it! And so, \"in the dispute between Emesh and Enten, En ten, the faithful farmer of the gods, having proved hims elf the winner, Emesh his knee bent before Enten, offered h im a prayer,\" and gave him many presents. It is noteworthy that in the above-quoted lines Enl il calls Emesh a brother of Enten—the same relationship as t hat be- tween Cain and Abel. This and other similarities be tween the Sumerian and biblical tales indicate that the forme r were the inspiration for the latter. The preference of the f armer over the shepherd by Enlil can be traced to the fact tha t he was the one to introduce farming while Enki accounted f or the domestication of livestock. Scholars tend to transl ate the Sumerian names as \"winter\" for Enten and \"summer\" f or Emesh. Strictly speaking EN.TEN meant \"Lord of Rest ing,\" the time after the harvests and thus the winter sea son, without a clear affinity to a specific deity. E.MESH (\"Hous e of Mesh\"), on the other hand, is clearly associated wi th Enki, one of whose epithets was MESH (\"Proliferation\"); h e was thus the god of shepherding. All in all, there can be little doubt that the Cain -Abel rivalry reflected a rivalry between the two divine brothers. It flared up from time to time, as when Enlil arrived on Earth to take over command from Enki (who was relegated t o the"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"When Paradise Was Lost 41 Abzu), and on subsequent occasions. Its roots, howe ver, went back to Nibiru, their home planet. Both were the so ns of Anu, Nibiru's ruler. Enki was the firstborn, and th us the natu- ral heir to the throne. But Enlil, though born late r, was born by the official spouse of Anu (and presumably a hal f sister of his)—a fact that made Enlil the legal heir to th e throne. Birthright clashed with succession rules; and thoug h Enki accepted the outcome, the rivalry and anger often b urst into the open. A question rarely asked is, where did Cain obtain t he very notion of killing? In the Garden of Eden Adam and E ve were vegetarians, eating only fruits of the trees. No an imal was slaughtered by them. Away from the Garden there wer e only four humans, none of whom has yet died (and certain ly not as a result of foul play). In such circumstances, w hat made Cain \"come upon his brother Abel and kill him\"? The answer, it seems, lies not among men but among the gods. Just as the rivalry between the human brother s reflected a rivalry between the divine brothers, so did the k illing of one human by another emulate the killing of one \"go d\" by another. Not of Enki by Enlil or vice versa—their r ivalry never reached such vehemence—but still the killing of one leader of the Anunnaki by another. The tale is well documented in Sumerian literature. Schol- ars called it The Myth of Zu. It relates events that took place after the rearrangement of the command on Earth, wi th an ample production of gold ores in the Abzu under Enk i's di- rection and their processing, smelting, and refinin g in the Edin under Enid's supervision. Six hundred Anunnaki are engaged in all of these operations on Earth; anothe r three hundred (the IGI.GI, \"Those Who Observe and See\") s tay aloft, manning the shuttlecraft and spacecraft that transport the purified gold to Nibiru. Mission Control Center is in En- Id's headquarters in Nippur; it is called DUR.AN.KI , \"The Bond Heaven-Earth.\" There, atop a raised platform, the vital instruments, celestial charts and orbital-data pane ls (\"Tablets of Destinies\") are kept in the DIR.GA, a restricted innermost holy-of-holies. The Igigi, complaining that they get no respite fro m their orbital duties, send an emissary to Enlil. He is an AN.ZU,"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Figure 14 \"One Who Knows the Heavens,\" and is called ZU for s hort. Admitted into the Dirga, he finds out that the Tabl ets of Destinies are the key to the whole mission. Soon he begins to think evil thoughts, \"to plot aggression:\" to st eal the Tab- lets of Destinies and \"govern the decrees of the go ds.\" At first opportunity he carried out his scheme, and \"in his Bird\" took off to hide in the \"Mountain of Skychamb ers.\" In the Duranki, everything came to a standstill; th e contact with Nibiru was disrupted, all operations were thro wn into havoc. As one effort after another to recapture the tablets fails, Ninurta, Enid's Foremost Son and warrior, un dertakes the dangerous mission. Aerial battles with weapons that emit brilliant rays ensue. Finally, Ninurta managed to p enetrate Zu's protective force-field shields and shot Zu's \" Bird\" down. Zu was captured and put on trial before the \" seven Anunnaki who judge.\" He was found guilty and was se n- tenced to death. His vanquisher, Ninurta, carried o ut the sentence. The execution of Zu has been depicted on an archaic sculpted relief found in central Mesopotamia (Fig. 14). It all happened long before Mankind was created; but as th ese texts show, the tale was recorded and known in ensuing mi llennia. If that is where Cain obtained the notion of killin g, Yahweh's anger was understandable, for Zu was killed after a trial; Abel was just murdered.

One more aspect of the human experience thus far can be explained by the divine records. The sin s of Adam/ Eve and of Cain are punished by nothing more severe than Expulsion. That too appears to be an application of an Anun- naki form of punishment to the created humans. It w as once meted out to Enlil himself, who \"date-raped\" a youn g Anun- naki nurse (who in the end became his wife). By combining the biblical and Sumerian data, we are now in a position to put the record of Mankind's beginn ings in a time frame supported by modern science. According to the Sumerian King Lists, 120 Sars (\"Di vine Years\" or orbits of Nibiru), equaling 432,000 Earth -years, passed from the arrival of the Anunnaki on Earth un til the Deluge. In chapter 6 of Genesis, in the preamble to the tale of Noah and the Deluge, the number \"one hundred and twenty years\" is also given. It has been generally held that it refers to the limit God had put on the extent of a man's life; but as we have pointed out in The 12th Planet , the Patriarchs lived after the Deluge much longer—Shem, the son of Noah, 600 years; his son Arpakhshad 438, his son Shelach 433, and so on through Terah, Abraham's fat her, who lived to be 205. A careful reading of the bibli cal Hebrew verse, we have suggested, actually spoke of the dei ty's years completing 120 by then—a count of Divine Years, not those of Earthlings. Out of those 432,000 Earth-years, the Anunnaki were alone on Earth for forty Sars, when the mutiny occurred. Then, some 288,000 Earth-years before the Deluge, i.e. ab out 300,000 years ago, they created the Primitive Worke r. After an interval whose length is not stated in those sou rces, they gave the new being the ability to procreate, and re turned the First Couple to southeast Africa. A point that is usually ignored, but which we find highly significant, is that all through the narratives con cerning Man's creation, the Garden of Eden episode, and—most intr iguing— in the story of the birth of Cain and Abel, the Bib le refers to the human as THE Adam, a generic term defining a certain species. Only in chapter 5 of Genesis, that begins with the words \"This is the book of the genealogies of Adam, \" does"},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"44 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS the Bible drop the \"the.\" It is only then that it s tarts to deal with a specific forefather of the human genera tions; but significantly, this listing omits Cain and Abel and proceeds from the person called Adam straight on to his son Seth, the father of Enosh. And it is only for Seth's son Enos h that the Hebrew term meaning \"human being\" is employed; for that is what Enosh meant: \"He who is human.\" To this day the Hebrew word for \"Humankind\" is Enoshut, \"that which is like, that which stems from, Enosh.\" The link between the biblical narrative and its Sum erian origins emerges most interestingly in this name of the son of Adam, Enosh, whom the Bible considers the real prog enitor of Humankind as it came to be in the ancient Near E ast. A list of months and the gods associated with them (k nown as IV R 33), which begins with Nisan as the month asso ciated with Anu and Enlil (the first month of the Assyrian -Babylo- nian year), lists next the month Ayar with the nota tion \"sha Ea bel tinishti\"—\"That of Ea, lord of Mankind.\" The Ak- kadian term tinishti has the same meaning as the En oshut in Hebrew (which derived from the Akkadian). The Akkad ian term, in turn, was paralleled in the Sumerian by th e term AZA.LU.LU which can best be translated as \"the peop le who serve\"; and once again, this conveys—and explai ns— the biblical statement that expounds on Enosh, the meaning of his name, and his time. It is in respect to Enosh that the Bible states (Ge nesis 4:26) that it was in his time that Humankind \"began to ca ll upon the name of Yahweh.\" It must have been an important devel- opment, a new phase in Humankind's history, for the Book of Jubilees states in almost identical words that i t was Enosh \"who began to call on the name of the Lord on Earth .\" Man has discovered God! Who was this new human, \"Enosh-man,\" from a scienti fic point of view? Was he the progenitor of what we cal l Nean- derthal Man, the first true Homo sapiens? Or was he already the ancestor of Cro-Magnon Man, the first true Homo sapiens sapiens that still walks the Earth as the current h uman beings? Cro-Magnon Man (so named after the site in France w here his skeletal remains were found) appeared in Europe some 35,000 years ago, replacing there the Neanderthal M an (so"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"When Paradise Was Lost 45 named after the discovery site in Germany) who can be traced there to 100,000 years ago. But, as skeletal remain s discov- ered in recent years in caves in Israel reveal, Nea nderthals were migrating through the Near East at least some 115,000 years ago, and Cro-Magnons had dwelt in the area al ready 92,000 years ago. Where do The Adam and Eve, the fi rst created humans, and Adam and Eve, the progenitors o f Seth and Enosh, fit into all that? What light do the Sum erian King Lists and the Bible shed on the issue, and how does it all correlate to modern scientific discoveries? While fossil remains discovered in Africa, Asia, an d Eu- rope suggest that hominids first appeared in southe astern Af- rica and then branched out to the other continents possibly half a million years ago, the true predecessors of today's humanity made their appearance in southeastern Afri ca some- what later. The genetic markers for Homo sapiens, f irst stud- ied through the Mitochondrial DNA that is passed by the female alone, and then through studies of Nuclear D NA that is inherited from both parents (reports at the Apri l 1994 an- nual meeting of the American Association of Physica l An- thropologists) indicate that we all stem from a sin gle \"Eve\" that had lived in southeast Africa between 200,000 and 250,000 years ago. Studies released in May 1995 of the Y chromosome indicate a single \"Adam\" ancestor some 270,000 years ago. The Sumerian data, we have concluded, places the cr eation of The Adam at about 290,000 years ago—well within the time scales for the two progenitors that modern sci ence now suggests. How long the stay at the Garden of Eden, the attain- ment of the ability to procreate, the expulsion bac k to south- east Africa, and the Cain-Abel birth had taken plac e, the ancient texts do not state. Fifty thousand years? O ne hundred thousand years? Whatever the exact time lapse, it s eems evi- dent that the \"Eve\" who was back in southeast Afric a, bear- ing offspring to The Adam, fits well chronologicall y with the current scientific data. With those early humans gone from the stage, the ti me came for the specific Adam and his line to appear.

More than a century ago, for example, Julius Oppert (in a study titled Die Daten der Genesis) showed that the two numbers share a factor of 72 (432,000 : 72 = 6,000 and 1656 : 72 = 23) and then engaged in mathematical ac robatics to arrive at a common source for the two. About a c entury later the \"mythologist\" Joseph Campbell (The Masks of God) noted with fascination that 72 represented the numb er of years Earth, in its orbit around the Sun, retards b y 1° (the phenomenon called Precession) and thus saw a connec tion to the zodiacal houses of 2,160 years each (72 x 30° = 2,160). These and other ingenious solutions fail to recogni ze the error in comparing 432,000 with 1,656 because of treatmen t of all the ancient texts as just \"myth.\" If the ancient re cords would be treated as reliable data, it should be noted tha t the Primi- tive Worker (still only THE Adam) was brought forth not 120 Sars before the Deluge but only 80 Sars before the wa- tery ordeal, i.e. only 288,000 Earth-years before t he Deluge. Moreover, as we have shown earlier in this chapter, THE Adam and the person Adam were not one and the same. First there was the interlude in the Garden of Eden , then the"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"When Paradise Was Lost 47 Expulsion. How long that interlude lasted, the Bibl e does not say. Since, as we have shown, the biblical narrative is based on Sumerian sources, the simplest solution to the p roblem is also the most plausible. In the Sumerian sexagesima l (\"base 60\") mathematical system, the cuneiform sign for \"1 \" could mean one or could mean sixty, depending on the posi tion of the sign, just as \"I\" could mean one or ten or one hundred depending on the digit's position in the decimal sy stem (ex- cept that we make distinction easy by the use of \"0 \" to indicate position, writing 1, 10, 100 etc.). Could it not then be that the redactors of the Hebrew Bible, seeing i n the Sum- erian sources the sign \"1\", took it to mean One rat her than Sixty? Based on such an assumption, the numbers 1,656 (the birth of Adam), 1,526 (the birth of Seth) and 1,421 (the birth of Enosh) are converted to 99,360, 91,560 and 85,260 r espec- tively. To determine how long ago that was, we have to add the 13,000 years since the Deluge; the numbers then become Adam born 112,360 years ago Seth born 104,560 years ago Enosh born 98,260 years ago The solution offered here by us leads to astounding results. It places the Adam-Seth-Enosh line right i n the time slot when Neanderthals and then Cro-Magnons passed through the Lands of the Bible as they sprea d toward Asia and Europe. It means that the individua l (not the generic) Adam was the biblical Man whom we term Neanderthal, and that Enosh, whose name meant \"Human,\" was the biblical term for what we call Cro - Magnon—the first Homo sapiens sapiens, indeed the f ore- father of Enoshut, today's humanity. It was then, the Bible asserts, that humanity \"bega n to call upon the name of Yahweh.\" Man was ready for renewed Divine Encounters; and some that then occurred were truly astounding."},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"T HE F IRST A MERICANS The long-held notion that America was settled by hu nters who had crossed over a frozen Bering Strait during the last Ice Age had seemed implausible to us all along, for it re- quired familiarity with an ice-free, warmer hunting continent thousands of miles away by people who, by definitio n, had not known of \"America.\" If they did know of such a land, others must have preceded them! This notion, according to which the First Americans came down the Pacific coast and established their first settlement at a North American site called Clovis is now compl etely discredited, primarily owing to the discovery of mu ch earlier settlements in the eastern parts of North America, and even more so of settlements dating back 20,000, 25,000 a nd even 30,000 years in South America, both near the P acific and the Atlantic coasts.

According to local lore, the arrivals were by sea. The latest estimate, of some 30,000 years ago from Asia via th e Pacific Ocean, requires seafaring knowledge at such an earl y date. This is no longer deemed outlandish by scientists, since it has been established by now that the first settlers in Austra- lia arrived there—by boat—some 37,000 years ago.

As a matter of fact, some of the images painted or drawn by the cave artists depict inexpli cable struc- tures or objects (Fig. 15). They become meaningful if one accepts the possibility that Cro-Magnons had seen ( or perhaps even traveled by) masted seagoing vessels—a possibi lity that could explain how Man crossed the two oceans 20,000 or even 30,000 years ago to reach America from the Old World. (Native American legends of prehistoric arrivals by sea across the Pacific include the tale of Naymlap, the leader of a small armada of balsamwood boats, who carried in his lead boat a green stone through which he could hear the divine instruc- tions for navigation and the point of landfall). Indeed, the Sumerian tales of the two chosen indivi duals who ascended to Heaven pertain to the origins of hu man civilization and explain how it came about (before the Del- uge).

When they see you, they will ask you: \"an, on account of whom do you look thus, for whom so you wear mourning garb?\" To this question, Ea instructed Adapa, you must giv e the following answer: \"Two gods have vanished from our land, that is why I am thus.\" When they question you who the two gods were, Ea continued, you must say, \"Dumuzi and Gizzida they are.\" And, since the two gods whose na mes you tell as being the vanished gods for whom you mo urn will be the very same two who guard the gate of Anu , Ea explained, \"They will glance at each other, and lau gh a lot, and will speak to Anu a good word about you.\" This strategy, Ea explained, will get Adapa past th e gate and \"cause Anu to show you his benign face.\" But on ce inside, Ea warned, Adapa's true test will come: As you stand before Anu, they will offer you bread; it is Death, do not eat!

Hearing that, Anu's a nger to Adapa subsided, but grew instead at Ea. \"It was he who did it!\" A nagging aspect of the tale thus far is the lack o f clarity regarding the true circumstances of the sea voyage. Was the arrival in a distant land the result of an accident al blowing off course, or somehow deliberate? The damaged line s that deal with that portion of the events make a determi nation impossible; but a feeling that the whole excuse of a \"broken wing\" of the South Wind was a cover for some delibe rate plan by Ea comes to us as we read and reread the an cient text.

One, whose title is damaged at its start , was on a shelf next to a text of \"Writings from Before the Flood,\" and its second line reads \"... which Adapa wrote at his dictation.\" The suggestion that Adapa had written d own knowledge dictated to him by a deity is enhanced by the title of another work attributed to Adapa by Sumerian sou rces.

Mesopotamian astrono mical texts referred to Mars as the planet \"where the rig ht course is set,\" where a turn is made as the drawing on the segment indicates. In Genesis Revisited we have presented c onsider- able ancient and modern evidence in support of a co nclusion that an ancient space base had existed on Mars. The missing texts or the damaged portions of the Ad apa Legend might have shed light on a puzzling aspect o f the tale: If Ea foresaw all that would happen at the he avenly abode, what was the purpose of scheming to send Ada pa aloft if, in the end, he was to be deprived of Eter nal Life? Tales from post-Diluvial times (such as that of Gil gamesh) indicate that offspring of a human and a god (or go ddess) deemed themselves worthy of Immortality, and went t o great lengths to join the gods to attain that. Was Adapa such a \"demigod,\" and did he nag Ea to endow him with Immo rtal- ity? The reference to Adapa as \"offspring of Ea\" is trans- lated by some literally as \"son of Ea,\" born to Enk i by a human female. This would explain Ea's scheme to pre tend that Adapa's wish is being granted, while in fact h e maneu- vered for the opposite result. Adapa, without doubt, also bore the title \"Son of E ridu\" (Enki's center). It was an honorific title that sig nified intelli- gence and education by schooling in Eridu's renowne d acade- mies. In Sumerian times the \"Sages of Eridu\" were a class unto themselves, ancient savants of blessed memory. Their names and specialties were listed and recorded with great respect and reverence in countless texts. According to those sources, the Sages of Eridu were seven in number. In her study of Assyrian sources, Rykle Borger (\"Die Beschwerungsserie Bit Meshri und die Himmelfa hrt Henochs\" in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies) wa s in- trigued by the fact that in respect to the seventh one, the text stated (in addition to the name and main call on fa me, as for all those listed) that it was he \"who to heaven asc ended.\" The Assyrian text calls him Utu-Abzu; Professor Bor ger con- cluded that he was the Assyrian \"Enoch,\" because ac cording"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Three Who to Heaven Ascended 59 to the biblical record, it was the seventh pre-Dilu vial Patri- arch, whom the Bible calls Enoch, who was taken by God to the heavenly abode.

And Enoch walked with God after he had begotten Methuselah three hundred years, and begot sons and daughters. And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty five years. for Enoch walked with God and was gone, for God had taken him. Even this short biblical report has more to it than meets the eye in translation because in the original Hebr ew it is stated that \"Enoch walked with the Elohim,\" and was taken aloft \"by Elohim.\" The Hebrew term, as we have show n, stood for DIN.GIR in the Sumerian sources of Genesi s.

The second journey was one way only: Enoch did not retu rn from it, and thus the biblical statement that Enoch was gone, for the Elohim had taken him. In the Book of Enoch it i s a cadre of angels that perform the divinely ordained tasks. The Bible states that Enoch \"walked with the Elohim \" well before he was taken aloft; the Book of Enoch e nlarges on that pre-ascent period. It describes Enoch as a scribe with prophetic powers. \"Before these things Enoch was hi dden, and no one of the Children of Adam knew where he wa s hidden, and where he abode . . . his days were with t he Holy Ones.\" His Divine Encounters began with dreams and vi- sions. \"I saw in my sleep what I will now say with my tongue of flesh,\" he said of the start of his invol vement with the Divine Ones. It was more than a dream, it was a vision: And the vision was shown to me thus: In the vision, clouds invited me and a mist summoned me; the course of the stars and lightnings sped and hastened me; the winds in the vision caused me to fly and lifted me upwards, and bore me unto heaven. Arriving in Heaven, he reached a wall \"which is bui lt of crystals and surrounded by tongues of fire.\" He bra ved the fire and came upon a house built of crystals whose ceiling emulated the starry sky and showed the paths of the stars. In his vision he then saw a second house, larger and m ore mag- nificent than the first. Braving the fires that enf lamed it, he saw inside a throne of crystal resting upon streams of fire; \"its appearance was crystal and the wheels thereof as a shin- ing sun.\" Seated on the throne was the Great Glory, but not even the angels could approach and behold His face because of the brilliance and magnificence of His glory.

Tt was after that dream-vision that Enoch's journey s actu- ally took place. They started one night, ninety day s before his 365th birthday. As Enoch told it later to his s ons, I was alone in the house. I was in great trouble, weeping with my eyes, and was resting, and fell asleep in my couch. And there appeared to me two men, exceedingly big, such as I have never seen on Earth. Their faces shone like the Sun, their eyes were like a burning light, and fire was coming out of their mouths. Their clothing, purple in appearance, was different from each other; and their arms were like golden wi ngs. They stood at the head of my couch, and called upon me by my name. Thus awakened from his sleep, Enoch continued, \"I s aw clearly those two men standing in front of me.\" Unl ike the first dream-vision, this was more than just a dream like vision; this time it was for real! \"I stood up beside my couch, and bowed down to them ,\" Enoch went on, \"and was seized with fear, and [ cov ered my face from terror.\" Then the two emissaries spoke up, saying, \"Have courage, Enoch, do not fear, for the Eternal Lord hath sent us to thee. Behold, today thou shalt go up with us to the heavens.\" They instructed Enoch to prepare himself for the ce lestial journey by telling his sons and servants all that t hey should do in the house while he was gone, and that no one should seek him, \"until the Lord return thee to them.\" Sum moning his two oldest sons, Metushelah and Regim, Enoch to ld them, \"I know not whither I go nor what will befall me.\" There- fore, he instructed them to be righteous and just a nd keep the faith of one Almighty God. He was still speakin g to his sons when \"the two angels took him on their wings a nd bore him up unto the First Heaven.\" It was a cloudy plac e, and he saw mere \"a very great sea, greater than the ear thly sea.\" In that first stop Enoch was shown the secrets of m eteorology,"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"The Three Who to Heaven Ascended 63 after which he was \"carried up\" to the Second Heave n, where he saw prisoners tormented, their sin having been \"not obeying the Lord's commands.\" In the Third Heaven, whence the two angels then took him, he saw Paradis e with the Tree of Life. The Fourth Heaven was the place o f the longest stop, where Enoch was shown the secrets of the Sun and Moon, of stars and zodiacal constellations, and of the calendar. The Fifth Heaven was the \"end of Heaven a nd Earth\" and the banishment place of \"the angels who have connected themselves with women.\" It was a \"chaotic and horrible place,\" from which \"seven stars of heaven\" could be seen \"bound together.\" It was there that the fir st part of the celestial journey was completed. On the second leg of the journey Enoch encountered the various classes of angels in an ascending order: Ch erubim and Seraphim and great Archangels, seven ranks of a ngels in all. Passing through me Sixth Heaven and the Sevent h Heaven, Enoch reached the Eighth Heaven; there the stars that make up the constellations could already be se en; and as Enoch ascended yet higher, he could see from the Ninth Heaven \"the heavenly homes of me twelve signs of me zo- diac.\" Finally he reached me Tenth Heaven, where he was \"brought before the Lord's face,\" a sight too aweso me, Enoch later said, to be described. Terrified, Enoch \"fell prone and bowed down to the Lord.\" And then he heard the Lord say, \"arise Enoch , have no fear, arise and stand before my face and gain et ernity.\" And the Lord commanded the archangel Michael to cha nge Enoch's earthly garments, clothe him in divine garm ents, and anoint him. Then the Lord told the archangel Pravue l to \"bring out the books from the holy storehouse, and a reed for quickwriting, and give it to Enoch so that he w ould write down all that the archangel will read to him, all t he com- mandments and teachings.\" For thirty days and thirt y nights Pravuel was dictating and Enoch was writing down al l the secrets of \"the works of heaven, earth and sea, and all the elements, their passages and goings, and me thunder ings of the thunder; and the Sun and Moon, the goings and c hanges of the stars, the seasons, years, days and hours\" a nd \"all"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"64 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS human things, the tongue of every human song . . . and all things fitting to learn.\" The writings filled up 36 0 books. Then the Lord himself, letting Enoch sit on His lef t beside the archangel Gabriel, told Enoch how Heaven and Ea rth and all upon it were created. Then the Lord told Enoch that he would be returned to Earth so that he could relate all that he had learned to his sons, and give them the handwrit ten books, to pass the books from generation to generation. Bu t his stay on Earth would be for a term of thirty days only, \" and after thirty days I shall send my angel for thee, and he will take thee from Earth and from thy sons, to me.\" And so it was, at the end of the celestial stay, th at the two angels returned Enoch to his home, bringing him bac k to his couch at night. Summoning his sons and all in his h ousehold, Enoch related to them his experiences and described to them the contents of the books: the measurements and des criptions of the stars, the length of the Sun's circle, the c hanges of the seasons due to the solstices and equinoxes, and oth er secrets regarding the calendar. Then he instructed his sons to be patient and gentle, to give alms to the poor, to be righteous and faithful, and to keep all of the Lord's command ments. Enoch kept talking and instructing until the last m oment, by which time word of his celestial visit and teach ings had spread in town and a crowd of two thousand people h ad assembled to hear him. So the Lord sent a darkness upon the Earth, and the darkness engulfed the crowd and all who were near Enoch. In the darkness, the angels swiftly lif ted Enoch and carried him off \"to the highest heaven.\" And all the people saw, but could not understand, how Enoch had been taken. And they went back to their homes, those who had seen such a thing, and glorified God.

Two angels, paralleling the gods Dumuzi and Giz- zida in the Adapa legend, bring the Earthling \"befo re the face of the Lord.\" The visitor's garments are chang ed from earthly ones to divine ones. He is anointed. And fi nally, he is given great knowledge that he writes down in \"bo oks.\" In both instances, the visitor writes what is being dictated to him. These details appear within a framework that w ithout doubt establishes the Sumerian origins of the Enoch \"legend.\" We have already pointed out that by ascribing Enoch 's Divine Encounters to \"the Elohim,\" the biblical nar rative divulged its Sumerian source. The Sumerian sexagesi mal sys- tem reveals itself by some key numbers in the Enoch tale, such as in the sixty days of the first heavenly soj ourn and the 360 \"books\" (tablets) dictated to Enoch. Most i ntriguing, however, is the assertion that the Divine Abode, si te of the supreme Divine Encounter, was the Tenth Heaven. Thi s goes against all the notions of seven divine heavens, wi th the sev- enth most supreme, a notion based on the assumption that the ancient peoples knew only of seven celestial bo dies (Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn) that c ould be observed in the skies surrounding the Earth. The Su merians, so much earlier than the Greeks or Romans, knew, ho wever, of the complete makeup of the Solar System, a famil y they said of twelve members: Sun and Moon; Mercury, Venu s, EARTH, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Plut o (we are using the modern names); and a tenth planet, Ni biru, the planet that was the abode of Anu, the \"king\" or \"lo rd\" of all the Anunnaki \"gods.\" (It is noteworthy that in Jewish medieval mysticism known as the Kaballah, the abode of God the Almighty is i n the tenth Sefira, a \"brilliance\" or heavenly place, a T enth Heaven.

Beyond it stretches the Ein Soff— i nfinity, infinite space.) These are all definite links to the Sumerian source s. But whether it was the tale of Adapa that is reflected in the Enoch record is uncertain, for one can find more similari ties between Enoch and a second pre-Diluvial Sumerian individual , EN.- ME.DUR.ANNA (\"Master of the Divine Tables of the He av- enly Bond\"), also known as EN.ME.DUR.AN.KI (\"Master of the Divine Tablets of the Bond Heaven-Earth\"). Like the biblical reign-list of ten pre-Diluvian Pa triarchs, so does the earlier Sumerian King List name ten pre -Diluvial rulers. In the biblical list, Enoch was the seventh . In the Sumerian list, Enmeduranki was the seventh. And, as in the case of Enoch, Enmeduranki was taken by two divine chaper- ons heavenward, to be taught a variety of sciences. Whereas in the case of Adapa the possibility (mentioned abo ve) that he was a seventh (sage) is not absolute (some Mesop otamian sources list him as the first of Eridu's seven sage s), the sev- enth position of Enmeduranki is certain; hence the scholarly opinion that it was he who was the Sumerian equival ent of the biblical Enoch. He came from Sippar, where in p re-Dilu- vial times the Spaceport of the Anunnaki was locate d, with Utu (\"Shamash\" in later times), a grandson of Enlil , as its commander."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"The Three Who to Heaven Ascended 67 The Sumerian King Lists record a \"reign\" of 21,600 years (six Sars) for Enmeduranki in Sippar—a detail of mu ch sig- nificance. First, it reveals that at a certain poin t in time the Anunnaki deemed selected humans qualified to act as the EN—\"Chief\"—of one of the pre-Diluvial settlements ( in this case, Sippar)—an aspect of the phenomenon of demigo ds. Secondly, in line with our suggestion for reconcili ng the Sumerian and biblical pre-Diluvial patriarchal life spans, it ought to be noted that 21,600 reduced by a factor o f 60 results in 360. Although the Bible assigns to Enoch an earthly presence of 365 years, the Book of Enoch gives 360 as the number of books written by Enoch in which he record ed the knowledge given him. These details not only highlig ht the similarities between Enoch and Enmeduranki, but als o sup- port our solution for the Sumerian/biblical treatme nt of pre- Diluvial time spans.

Lambert (\"Enmeduranki and Re lated Material\" in the Journal of Cuneiform Studies). The basic source is the record of pre-Diluvial events inscrib ed on clay tablets by a Babylonian king in support of his clai m to the throne because he was a \"distant scion of kingship, seed preserved from before the Flood, offspring of Enmed uranki who ruled in Sippar.\" Having thus asserted his impr essive ancestral link to a pre-Diluvial ruler, the Babylon ian king went on to tell the story of Enmeduranki: Enmeduranki was a prince in Sippar, beloved of Anu, Enlil and Ea. Shamash in the Bright Temple appointed him as priest. Shamash and Adad [took him] to the assembly [of the gods]. Shamash, as mentioned, was a grandson of Enlil and com- mander of the Spaceport in Sippar in pre-Diluvial t imes and of the one of the Sinai peninsula thereafter.

The Catholic Church, which condemned Copernicus for that heresy, officially acknowledged its mistake only 45 0 years later, in 1993. The first new celestial objects discovered after th e inven- tion of telescopes were the four large moons of Jup iter—by Galileo, in 1610.

The Deluge wa s indeed a story of major proportions as newscasters would say nowadays, a global event, a watershed both figurati vely and literally in human and divine affairs. But hidden b ehind the tale of the Deluge is an episode of Divine Encounte rs of a totally new kind—an episode without which me Deluge tale itself would lose its biblical rationale. The biblical tale of the Deluge, the great Flood, b egins in chapter 6 of Genesis with eight enigmatic verses. T heir pre- sumed purpose was to explain to future generation h ow was it—how could it have happened?—that the very Creato r of Humankind turned against it, vowing to wipe Man off the face of the Earth. The fifth verse is supposed to o ffer both explanation and justification: \"And Yahweh saw that the wickedness of Man was great on the Earth, and that every imagination of his heart's thoughts was evil.\" Ther efore (verse six) \"Yahweh repented that He had made Man u pon the Earth, and it grieved Him at His heart.\" But this explanation by the Bible, pointing the acc using finger at humanity, only increases the puzzle of th e chapter's first four verses, whose subject is not at all huma nity but the deities themselves, and whose focus is the inte rmarriage 72"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"The Nefilim: Sex and Demigods 73 between \"the sons of God\" and \"the daughters of the Adam.\" And if one wonders, What has all that got to do wit h the excuse for the Deluge as a punishment of Mankind, t he an- swer can be given in one word: SEX . . . Not human sex, but Divine Sex. Divine Encounters for the purpose o f sex- ual intercourse. The opening verses of the Deluge tale in the Bible, echoing ancient sins and calamitous purgatory, have been a preacher's delight: That was a time that set an example, the t ime when \"there were giants upon the Earth, in those days an d also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the d aughters of men and they bare children to them.\" The above quote follows the common English translat ion. But that is not what the Bible says. It speaks not of \"giants\" but of the Nefilim, literally meaning \"Those who ha d de- scended,\" \"sons of the Elohim\" (not \"sons of God\") who had come down to Earth from the heavens. And the fo ur initial incomprehensible verses, a remnant (as all scholars agree) of some longer original source, become compr ehensi- ble once it is realized that the subject of these v erses is not Mankind, but the gods themselves. Properly translat ed, this is how the Bible describes the circumstances that p receded and led to the Deluge: And it came to pass, When the Earthlings began to increase in number upon the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of the Elohim saw the daughters of the Earthlings, that they were compatible. And they took unto themselves wives of whichever they chose. The Nefilim were upon the Earth in those days, and thereafter too, when the sons of the Elohim cohabited with the daughters of the Adam and they bore children to them."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"74 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS The biblical term Nefilim, the sons of the Elohim w ho were then upon the Earth, parallels the Sumerian Anunnak i (\"Those Who from Heaven to Earth Came\"); the Bible itself (Numbers 13:33) explains that by pointing out that the Nefi- lim were \"sons of Anak\" (Hebrew rendering of Anunna ki). The time preceding the Deluge was thus a time when the young Anunnaki males began to have sex with young h uman females; and being compatible, had children by them —off- spring part mortal and part \"divine\": demigods. That such demigods were present on Earth is amply a t- tested in Near Eastern texts, be it in regard to in dividuals (such as the Sumerian Gilgamesh) or long dynasties (such as the reported dynasty of thirty demigods in Egypt th at pre- ceded the Pharaohs); both instances, however, perta in to post- Diluvial times. But in the biblical preamble to the Deluge tale we have an assertion that the \"taking of wives \" from among the human females by the \"sons of the Elohim\" — sons of the DIN.GIR—had already begun well before t he Deluge. The Sumerian sources that deal with pre-Diluvial ti mes and the origins of Humankind and civilization include t he tale of Adapa, and we have already touched upon the questio n whether having been called \"offspring of Ea\" simply meant that he was a human descended of The Adam whom Ea h ad helped create, or more literally (as many scholars hold) an actual son born to Ea by intercourse with a human f emale, which would make Adapa a demigod. If that would hav e required Ea/Enki to have sex with a female other th an his official spouse, the goddess Ninki, no eyebrows sho uld be raised: several Sumerian texts detail the sexual pr owess of Enki. In one instance he was after Inanna/Ishtar, t he grand- daughter of his half brother Enlil. Among other esc apades was his determination to attain a son by his half s ister Nin- mah; but when only a daughter was born, he continue d the sexual relationship with the next and next and next genera- tions of goddesses. Was Enmeduranki, by all accounts, the seventh and n ot the last (tenth) ruler of a City of the Gods well b efore the Deluge, such a demigod? The point is not clarified by the Sumerian texts, but we suspect that he was (in whic h case"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"The Nefilim: Sex and Demigods 75 his lather was Utu/Shamash). Otherwise, why would a City of the Gods (in this case, Sippar) be put under his charge, in a succession in which all the previous six listed r ulers were Anunnaki leaders? And how could he reign in Sippar 21,600 years were he not a genetic beneficiary of the rela tive \"Im- mortality\" of the Anunnaki? Although the Bible itself does not say when the int ermar- riage began, except to state that it \"came to pass when the Earthlings began to increase in number\" and to spre ad upon the Earth, the Pseudepigraphic books reveal that th e sexual involvement of young gods with human females became a major issue in the time of Enoch—well before the De luge (since Enoch was the seventh Patriarch of the ten p re-Diluvial ones). According to the Book of Jubilees one of the matters regarding which Enoch had \"testified\" concerned \"an gels of the Lord who had descended to Earth and who had sin ned with the daughters of men, those who had begun to u nite themselves, and thus be defiled, with the daughters of men.\" According to this source, this was a major sin comm itted by the \"angels of the Lord,\" a \"fornication\" \"wherein, against the law of their ordinance, they went whoring after the daugh- ters of men, and took themselves wives of all which they chose, thus causing the beginning of uncleanliness. \" The Book of Enoch throws more light on what had happened: And it came to pass when the children of men had multiplied, that in those days were born unto them beautiful and comely daughters. And the angels, the Children of Heaven, saw and lusted after them, and said to one another: ' 'Come, let us choose wives from among the children of men, and beget us children.\" According to this source, this was not a developmen t re- sulting from individual acts, from a young Anunnaki here and another one there getting overcome by lust. The re is a hint that the sexual urge was augmented by a desire to have offspring; and that the choosing of human wives was . a delib-"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"76 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS erate decision by a group of Anunnaki acting in con cert. Indeed, as we peruse the text further, we read that after the idea had germinated, Semjaza, who was their leader, said unto them: \"I fear ye will not agree to do this deed, and I alone shall have to pay the penalty for a great sin .'' And they all answered and said: \"Let us all swear an oath, and all bind ourselves by mutual imprecations, not to abandon this plan but to do this thing.\" So they all gathered together and bound themselves by an oath \"to do this thing\" although it was a violation of \"the law of their ordinance.\" The scheming angels, we le arn as we read on, descended upon Mount Hermon (\"Mount of Oath\"), at the southern edge of the mountains of Le banon. \"Their number was two hundred, those who in the day s of Jared came down upon the summit of Mount Hermon.\" T he two hundred divided themselves into subgroups of te n; the Book of Enoch provides the names of the group leade rs, \"the chiefs of Ten.\" The whole affair was thus a well-or ganized effort by sex-deprived and childless \"sons of the E lohim\" to remedy the situation. It is obvious that in the Pseudepigraphic books the sexual involvement of divine beings with the human females was no more than lust, fornication, defilement—a sin of th e \"fallen angels.\" The prevalent notion is that that is the v iewpoint of the Bible itself; but in fact this is not so. The o nes to be blamed and, therefore, to be wiped out are the Chil dren of Adam, not the sons of the Elohim. The latter are, i n fact, fondly remembered: verse 4 recalls them as \"the mig hty ones of Olam, the people of the Shem\"—the people of the rocketships. An insight into the motivation, calculations, and s entiments that brought about the intermarriage and how it was to be judged, might be gleaned from a somewhat similar oc currence related in the Bible (Judges chapter 21). On accoun t of the sexual abuse of a traveler's woman by men from the tribe of Benjamin, the other Israelite tribes made war on th e Benja-"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"The Nefilim: Sex and Demigods 77 minites. Decimated and with few childbearing female s re- maining, the tribe faced extinction. The option of marrying females from other tribes was also blocked, for all the other tribes took an oath not to give their daughters to the Benja- minites. So the Benjaminite men, on the occasion of a na- tional festival, hid themselves along a road leadin g to the town of Shiloh; and when the daughters of Shiloh ca me out dancing down the road, they \"caught every man his w ife\" and carried them off to the Benjaminite domain. Sur prisingly, they were not punished for these abductions; for in truth, the whole incident was a scheme concocted by the elders of Israel, a way to help the tribe of Benjamin survive in spite of the boycott oath. Was such a \"do what you have to do while I look awa y\" ploy behind the oath-taking ceremony atop Mount Her mon? Was it at least one principal leader, an elder of t he Anunnaki (Enki?) who looked away, while another (perhaps Enl il?) was so upset? A little-known Sumerian text may have a bearing on the question. Regarded as a \"mythical tablet\" by E. Chi era (in Sumerian Religious Texts), it tells the story of a young god named Martu who complained about his spouseless lif e; and we learn from it that intermarriage with human fema les was both common and not a sin—providing it was done by per- mission and not without the young woman's consent: In my city I have friends, they have taken wives. I have companions, they have taken wives. In my city, unlike my friends, I have not taken a wife; I have no wife, I have no children. The city about which Martu was speaking was called Nin- ab, a \"city in the settled great land.\" The time, t he Sumerian text explains, was in the distant past when \"the ci ty of Nin- ab existed, Shed-tab did not exist; the holy tiara existed, the holy crown did not exist.\" In other words, priestho od existed,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"78 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Figure 19 but not Kingship as yet. But it was a time when \"co habitation there was ... bringing forth of children there was. \" The city's High Priest, the text informs us, was an accom- plished musician; he had a wife and a daughter. As the people gathered for a festival, offering the gods the roas ted meat of the sacrifices, Martu saw the priest's daughter and desired her. Evidently, taking her as a wife required special pe rmission, for it was an act—to use the words of the Book of J ubilees— \"against the law of their ordinances.\" The above-qu oted complaint by Martu was addressed to his mother, an unnamed goddess. She wanted to know whether the maiden whom he desired \"appreciated his gaze.\" When it was so dete rmined, the gods gave Martu the needed permission. The rest of the text describes how the other young gods prepared a marriage feast, and how the residents of Nin-ab were summone d by the beat of a copper drum to witness the ceremony. If we read the available texts as versions of the s ame pre- historic record, we can envision the predicament of the young Anunnaki males and the unwelcome solution. There we re six hundred Anunnaki who had come to Earth and another three hundred who operated the shuttlecraft, spacecraft, and other facilities such as a space station. Females were fe w among them. There was Ninmah, the daughter of Anu and a h alf sister of both Enki and Enlil (all three from diffe rent mothers) who was the Chief Medical Officer, and with her the re came a group of female Anunnaki nurses (a depiction on a Sumer- ian cylinder seal portrays the group—Fig. 19).

An insight into the sexual habits on Nibiru itself can be gleaned from the records, in various God Lists that the Sum- erians and subsequent nations had kept, concerning Anu him- self. He had fourteen sons and daughters from his o fficial spouse Antu; but in addition he had six concubines, whose (presumably numerous) offspring by Anu were not lis ted. Enlil, on Nibiru, fathered a son by his half sister Ninmah (also known as Ninti in the Creation of Man tales a nd as Ninharsag later on); his name was Ninurta. But, tho ugh a grandson of Anu, his spouse Bau (also given the epi thet GULA, \"The Great One\") was one of the daughers of A nu, which amonts to Ninurta marrying one of his aunts. On Earth Enlil, once having espoused Ninlil, was strictly mo nogamous. They had a total of six children, four daughters an d two sons; the youngest, Ishkur in Sumerian and Adad in Akkadi an, was also called in some God Lists Martu—indicating that Shala, his official consort, might well have been an Earth ling, the daughter of the High Priest, as the tale of Martu's marriage reported. Enki's spouse was called NIN.KI (\"Lady of Earth\") a nd was also known as DAM.KI.NA (\"Spouse who to Earth came\"). Back on Nibiru she bore him a son, Marduk; mother and son joined Enki on Earth on subsequent trips. B ut while he was on Earth without her, Enki did not deprive h imself ... A text called by scholars \"Enki and Ninharsag: A Para- dise Myth\" describes how Enki stalked his half sist er and, seeking a son by her, \"poured the semen into her wo mb.\" But she bore him only daughters, whom Enki also fou nd worthy of conjugation. Finally Ninharsag put a curs e on Enki that paralyzed him, and forced him to concur in a q uick assignment of husbands to the young female goddesse s. This did not stop Enki, on another occasion, from forcef ully \"car- rying off as a prize\" a granddaughter of Enlil, Ere shkigal, by boat to his domain in southern Africa. All these instances serve to illustrate the dire sh ortage of females among the Anunnaki who had come to Earth. A fter the Deluge, as the Sumerian God Lists attest, with second"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"80 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS and third generations of Anunnaki around, a better male- female balance was attained. But the shortage of fe males was obviously acute in the long pre-Diluvian times. There was absolutely no intention on the part of th e Anun- naki leadership, when the decision to create Primit ive Work- ers was taken, to also create sexmates for the Anun naki males. But, in the words of the Bible, \"when the Ea rthlings began to increase in number upon the face of the Ea rth, and daughters were born unto them,\" the young Anunn aki discovered that the series of genetic manipulations have made these females compatible, and that cohabiting with them would result in children. The planetary intermarriage required strict permiss ion. With the behavioral code of the Anunnaki viewing ra pe as a serious offense (even Enlil, the supreme commander, was sentenced to exile when he date-raped the young nur se; he was forgiven after he married her), the new form of Divine Encounters was strictly regulated and required perm ission which, we learn from the Sumerian text, was given o nly if the human female \"appreciated the gaze\" of the youn g god. So two hundred of the young ones took matters into their own hands, swore an oath to do it all together and face the results as a group, and swooped down among the Daughters of Men to pick out wives. The outcome—totally unanticipated when T he Adam was created—was a new breed of people: Demigods. Enki, who himself may have fathered demigods, viewe d the development more leniently than Enlil; so, evid ently, did Enki's cocreator of The Adam, Ninmah, for it was in her city, the medical center called Shuruppak, that the Sumcrian hero of the Deluge resided. The fact that he was li sted in the Sumerian King Lists as the tenth pre-Diluvial ruler indicates that it was to demigods that key roles as intermedi aries be- tween the gods and the people were assigned: kings and priests. The practice resumed after the Deluge; kin gs espe- cially boasted that they were \"seed\" of this or tha t god (and some made the claim even if they were not, just to legitimize their assumption of the throne). The new kind of Divine Encounters, resulting in a n ew (though limited) breed of humans, created problems not only"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"The Nefilim: Sex and Demigods 81 for the leadership of the Anunnaki, but also for Ma nkind. The Bible recognizes the sexual intercourse between Anunnaki and humans as the most significant aspect of the ev ents preced- ing and leading to the Deluge, doing so by the enig matic prefac- ing of the tale of the flood with the verses that r ecord the intermarriage phenomenon. The development is presen ted as a problem for Yahweh, a cause for grief and being sor ry for creating the Earthlings. But as the more detailed p seudepigraphi- cal sources relate, the new kind of Divine Encounte rs created problems also for the sex partners and their famili es. The first reported instance concerns the very hero of the Deluge and his family—Noah and his parents. The rep ort also raises the question whether the hero of the De luge (called Ziusudra in the Sumerian texts and Utnapishtim in t he Akkad- ian version) was in fact a demigod. Scholars have long believed that among the sources for the Book of Enoch there was a lost text that had been c alled the Book of Noah. Its existence was guessed from variou s early writings; but what had only been surmised became a certain and verified fact when fragments of such a Book of Noah were found among the Dead Sea scrolls in caves in t he Qumran area, not far from Jericho. According to the relevant sections of the book, whe n Bath- Enosh, the wife of Lamech, gave birth to Noah, the baby boy was so unusual that he aroused tormenting suspicion s in the mind of Lamech: His body was white as snow and red as the blooming of a rose, and the hair of his head and his locks were white as wool, and his eyes were fair. And when he opened his eyes, he lighted up the whol e house like the sun, and the whole house was very br ight. And thereupon he arose in the hands of the midwife, opened his mouth, and conversed with the Lord of Righteousness. Shocked, Lamech ran to his father Metushelah and sa id: I have begotten a strange son, diverse from and unlike Man, and resembling the sons of the God"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"82 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS of Heaven; and his nature is different, and he is not like us . . . And it seems to me that he is not sprung from me hut from the angels. In other words, Lamech suspected that his wife's pr eg- nancy was induced not by him but by one of the \"son s of the God of Heaven,\" one of the \"Watchers\"! The distraught Lamech came to his father Metushelah not only to share the problem with him but also to requ est spe- cific assistance. We learn at this point that Enoch , who was taken by the Elohim to be with them, was still aliv e and well, residing in a \"dwelling place among the angels\"—not in the distant heavens, but \"at the ends of the Earth.\" So Lamech asked his father to reach there his father Enoch, a nd ask him to investigate whether any of the Watchers had mate d with Lamech's wife. Reaching the place but prohibited fr om enter- ing it, Metushelah called out for Enoch, and after a while Enoch, hearing the call, responded. Thereupon Metus helah related the unusual birth to Enoch, and Lamech's do ubts about the true identity of Noah's father. Confirmin g that inter- marriage resulting in demigod children had indeed b egun in the time of Jared, Enoch nevertheless assured his s on that Noah is a son of Lamech and that his unusual counte nance and brilliant mind are omens that \"there shall come a Deluge and great destruction for one year,\" but Noah and h is family are destined to be saved. All that, Enoch said, he knows because \"the Lord has showed me and informed me, an d I have read it in the heavenly tablets.\" According to the Hebrew-Aramaic fragment of the Boo k of Noah that was discovered among the Dead Sea scro lls, the first reaction by Lamech on seeing his highly unusu al son was to question his wife Bath-Enosh (\"Daughter/offs pring of Enosh\"). As translated by T.H. Gaster (The Dead Sea Scrip- tures) and H. Dupont-Sommer (The Essene Writings fr om Qumran) column II of the scroll fragment begins wit h La- mech confessing that, as soon as he saw the baby No ah, I thought in my heart that the conception was from one of the Watchers, one of the Holy Ones . . ."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"The Nefilim: Sex and Demigods 83 And my heart was changed within me because of the child. Then I, Lamech, hastened and went to Bath-Enosh, my wife, and I said to her: I want you to take an o ath by the Most High, the Lord Supreme, the King of all the worlds, the ruler of the Sons of Heaven, that you will tell me the truth whether . . . But if one examines the original Hebrew-Aramaic tex t of the scroll, one finds that where the modern transla tors use the term Watchers—as translators have done—the orig inal text (Fig. 20) actually says Nefilim (author's ital ics). (The mistranslation of the word as \"Watchers\" befor e the Hebrew-Aramaic text was discovered resulted from re liance on the Greek versions, which were the product of Gr eek- Egyptian translators in Alexandria who took the ter m to mean the same as the Egyptian one for \"god,\" NeTeR, lite rally meaning \"Guardian.\" The term is not without a link to an- cient Sumer, or more correctly Shumer, which meant Land of the Guardians). Lamech, then, suspected that the child was not his. Asking his wife to tell him the truth under oath, she resp onded by imploring that he \"remember my delicate feelings\" a lthough \"the occasion is indeed alarming.\" Hearing this amb iguous, even evasive answer, Lamech grew even more \"excited and perturbed at heart.\" Again he implored his wife for the truth \"and not with lies.\" So, she said, \"ignoring my del icate feelings, I swear to you by the Holy and Great One, the Lord of Heaven and Earth, that this seed came from you, this conception was by you, and this fruit was planted b y you Column II Figure 20"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"84 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS and not by some stranger or by any of the Watchers, the heavenly beings.\" As we know from the rest of the story, Lamech remai ned doubting in spite of these reassurances. Perhaps he wondered what Bath-Enosh was talking about when she said tha t \"her delicate feelings\" should be taken into considerati on. Was she covering up the truth after all? As we have already described, Lamech then rushed to his father Metushelah and sou ght through him Enoch's help in getting to the bottom of the pu zzle. The pseudepigraphical sources conclude the tale wit h the reassurances about Noah's parentage and the explana tion that his unusual features and intelligence were just sig ns of his forthcoming role as the savior of the human seed. A s for us, we must remain wondering, since according to the Su merian sources of the tale the hero of the Deluge was, in all probabil- ity, a demigod. The sex-oriented Divine Encounters began, according to the sources quoted above, at the time of Jared, the fat her of Enoch. Indeed, his very name is explained in those sources as stemming from the root Yrd which in Hebrew means \"to descend ,\" recall- ing the descent of the plotting sons of the gods up on Mount Hermon. Using the chronological formula that we had earlier adopted, we could calculate when it had happened.

Except for an account of the Deluge written in Gree k by the Chaldean priest Berossus in the third century B . C ., known to scholars from fragmentary mentions in the writin gs of Greek historians, the only record of that momentous event was in the Hebrew Bible. But in 1872 the British So ciety of Biblical Archaeology was told in a lecture by Georg e Smith that among the tablets of the Epic of Gilgamesh dis covered by Henry Layard in the royal library of Nineveh, th e ancient Assyrian capital, some (Fig. 21) contained a Deluge tale simi- lar to that in the Bible. By 1910 parts of other re censions (as scholars call versions in other ancient Near Easter n lan- guages) have been found. They helped reconstruct an other major Mesopotamian text, the Epic of Atra-hasis, th at told the story of Mankind from its creation until its ne ar-annihila- tion by the Deluge.

It fills out the details of what \"walking with the Elohim\" had really entailed. Among the man y de- tails that the Mesopotamian texts provide, the role played by dreams as an important form of Divine Encounter bec omes evident. There is also a precedent for a deity's re fusal to show his face to a beseeching mortal—God is heard b ut is not seen. And there is a vivid, first person report of a Divine Encounter unique in all the annals of the ancient N ear East— the blessing of humans by the deity by the physical touching of the forehead. In the biblical version it is the same deity who re solves to wipe Mankind off the face of the Earth and, contrad ictorily, acts to prevent the demise of Mankind by devising a way to save the hero of the tale and his family. In the Su merian original text and its subsequent Mesopotamian recen sions, more than one deity is involved; and as in other in stances, Enlil and Enki emerge as the chief protagonists: th e stricter Enlil, upset by the intermarriages with the daughte rs of Man, calling for putting an end to Mankind; but the leni ent Enki, Figure 21"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"The Deluge 89 deeming Mankind as his \"Created Ones,\" schemes to s ave it through a chosen family. The Deluge, furthermore, was not a universal calami ty brought about by an angry god, but a natural calami ty seized by an upset Enlil to attain the desired goal. It wa s preceded by a long period of a worsening climate, increasing cold, reduced precipitation, and failing crops—conditions that we have identified in The 12th Planet as the last Ice Age that began circa 75,000 years ago and ended abruptly som e 13,000 years ago. We have suggested that the accumulating mass of ice atop Antarctica, causing by its sheer weight so me of the bottom layers to melt, was nearing a point where th e whole mass could slip off the continent; this would have caused an immense tidal wave that, surging from the south, co uld engulf the land masses to the north. With their IGI.G1 (\"T hose Who Observe and See\") orbiting the Earth and with a sci entific station at the tip of Africa, the Anunnaki were wel l aware of the danger. And as the next orbital proximity of Ni biru to Earth was due, they well realized that the heighten ed gravita- tional pull on this passage could well trigger the calamity. Throughout the mounting human suffering as the Ice Age became more severe, Enlil forbade the other gods fr om help- ing Mankind; it is evident from the details in the Epic of Atra-hasis that his intention was to have Mankind p erish by starvation. But Mankind somehow survived, for in th e ab- sence of rains crops still grew by dint of a mornin g mist and a nighttime dew. In time, however, \"the fertile fie lds became white, vegetation did not sprout.\" \"People walked h unched in the streets, their faces looked green.\" The star vation led to fraternal strife, even cannibalism. But Enki, de fying Enid's command, found ways of helping Mankind sustain itse lf, mainly by ingenious catches of fishes. He was espec ially helpful to his faithful follower Atra-hasis (\"He wh o is most wise\"), a demigod charged with acting as the go-bet ween to the Anunnaki and their human servants in the settle ment of Shuruppak—a city under the patronage of Ninmah/Ninh arsag.

Previously he explained th e need to annihilate Mankind because \"its conjugations depriv e me of sleep.\" Now, he said, \"the noise of Mankind has bec ome too annoying; their uproar deprives me of sleep.\" A nd so he made the other leaders swear that what is about to happen— the avalanche of water—would be kept a secret from the Earthlings, so that they would perish: Enlil opened his mouth to speak and addressed the assembly of all the gods: \"Come, all of us, and take an oath regarding the killing Flood!\" That the Anunnaki themselves were preparing to aban don Earth in their shuttlecraft was another part of the secret that the gods swore to keep from Mankind. But as all the others took the oath, Enki resisted. \"Why will you bind me with an oath?\" he asked, \"Am I to raise my hand against my own humans?\" A bitter argument ensued, but in the e nd Enki too was made to swear not to reveal \"the secret.\" It was after that fatal oath-taking ceremony that A tra-hasis, staying day and night at the temple, received the f ollowing message in a dream: The gods commanded total destruction. Enlil imposed an evil deed on the humans. It was a message, an oracle, that Atra-hasis could not un- derstand. \"Atra-hasis opened his mouth and addresse d his god: 'Teach me the meaning of the dream, so that I may understand its meaning.' \" But how could Enki be more explicit without breakin g his oath?

For seven years, Atra-hasis said, \"I have seen your face.\" Now, all of a sudden, he could not see his lord-god . Appeal- ing to the unseen god, \"Atra-hasis made his voice h eard and spoke to his lord,\" asking for the meaning, the por tent of his dream, that he may know what to do. Thereupon Enki \"opened his mouth to speak, and ad- dressed the reed wall.\" Still not seeing his god, A tra-hasis heard the deity's voice coming from behind the reed wall in the temple; his lord-god was giving instructions to the wall: Wall, listen to me! Reed wall, observe my words! Discard your house, build a boat! Spurn property, save life! Instructions for the construction of the boat then followed. It had to be roofed over so that the Sun should not be seen from inside it, pitched all over with tar \"above an d below.\" Then Enki \"opened the water clock and filled it; He an- nounced to him the coming of a killing flood on the seventh night.\" A depiction on a Sumerian cylinder seal app ears to have illustrated the scene, showing the reed wall ( in the shape of a water clock?) held by a priest, Enki as a serp ent-god, and the hero of the Deluge getting instructions (Fi g. 22). The construction of the boat, obviously, could not have been hidden from the other people; so how could it be done without alerting them, too, to the coming catastrop he?

Since I reverence Enki, I cannot remain in the land of Enlil. I have been expelled from my house. The conflict between Enki and Enlil, that earlier h ad to be surmised from their actions, has thus broken into t he open— sufficiently to serve as a believable reason for th e banishment of Atra-hasis. The city where the events were takin g place was Shuruppak, a settlement under the lordship of N inmah/ Ninharsag. There, for the first time, a demigod was elevated to the status of \"king.\" According to the Sumerian text, his name was Ubar-Tutu; his son and successor was the h ero of the Deluge. (The Sumerians called him Ziusudra; in the Epic of Gilgamesh he was called Utnapishtim; in Old Baby lonian his epithet-name was Atra-hasis; and the Bible call ed him Noah). As one of the settlements of the Anunnaki in the Edin, it was in the domain of Enlil; to Enki the Ab zu, in southern Africa, was allotted. It was that land of Enki beyond the seas, Atra-hasis was to say, that he expected t o reach with his boat. Eager to get rid of the banished man, the elders of the city made the whole town help build the boat. \"The carpe nter Figure 22"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"The Deluge 93 brought his axe, the workers brought the tar stones , the young ones carried the pitch, the binders provided the re st.\" When the boat was finished, according to the Atra-hasis text, the townspeople helped him load it with food and water (kept in watertight compartments), as well as \"with clean an imals ... fat animals .. . wild creatures . . . cattle . .. w inged birds of the sky.*' The list is akin to the one in Genesis, according to which the Lord's instructions to Noah were to br ing into the ark two of each species, male and female, \"of e very living thing of flesh ... of the fowls after their kind and of the cattle after their kind.\" The embarkation of pairs of animals has been a favo rite subject of countless artists, be it master painters or illustrators of children's books. It has also been one of the ey ebrow raisers of the tale, deemed a virtual impossibility and thus more of an allegorical way to explain how animal li fe contin- ued even after the Deluge. Indirectly, such doubt r egarding an important detail is bound to cast incredulity on the factu- ality of the whole Deluge story. It is therefore noteworthy that the Deluge recensio n in the Epic of Gilgamesh offers a totally different detail regarding the preservation of animal life: It was not the liv ing animals that were taken aboard—it was their seed that was p reserved! The text (tablet XI, lines 21-28) quotes Enki speak ing thus to the wall: Reed hut, reed hut! Wall, wall! Reed hut, hearken! Wall, reflect! Man of Shuruppak, son of Ubar-Tutu: Abandon your house, build a ship! Give up possessions, seek thou life! Forswear goods, the life keep! Aboard the ship take thou the seed of all living things. We learn from line 83 in the tablet that Utnapishti m (as \"Noah\" was called in this Old Babylonian recension) had indeed brought on board \"whatever 1 had of the seed of living beings.\" Clearly, this is a reference not to plant seeds, but to that of animals."},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"94 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS The term for \"seed\" in the Old Babylonian and Assyr ian recensions is the Akkadian word zeru (Zera in Hebre w) which stands for that from which living things spro ut and grow. That these recensions stem from Sumerian orig inals has been clearly established; indeed, in some of th e Akkadian versions the technical term for \"seed\" has been ret ained by its original Sumerian NUMUN, which was used to sign ify that by which a man had offspring. Taking on board \"the seed of living beings\" rather than the animals themselves not only reduced the sp ace requirements to manageable proportions. It also imp lies the application of sophisticated biotechnology to p reserve varied species—a technique being developed nowadays by learning the genetic secrets of DNA. This was feasi ble since Enki was involved; for he was the master of g enetic engineering, symbolized in this capacity by the Ent wined Serpents that emulated the double-helixed DNA (see Fig. 5). The assigning by the Sumerian/Mesopotamian texts of the role of Mankind's savior to Enki makes much sense. He was the creator of The Adam and of Homo sapiens, and th us he understandably called the doomed Earthlings \"my hum ans.\" As chief scientist of the Anunnaki he could select, obtain, and provide \"the seed of all living things\" for pre servation, and possessed the knowledge of resurrecting those a nimals from their \"seed\" DNA. He was also best suited for the role of the designer of Noah's ark—a vessel of a special design that could survive the avalanche of water. All the versions agree that it was built according to exact specific ations pro- vided by the deity. Built so that two-thirds of its great size would be below the waterline, it was given considerable stability. Its wooden structure was made waterproof with bitumen tar both inside and outside, so that when the tidal wave engulfed i t even the upper decks would hold off the waters. The flat top had only one small jutting cubicle, whose hatch was also clo sed and sealed with bitumen when the time came to face the Deluge. Of the many suggestions for the shape of Noah's Ark , the one by Paul Haupt (\"The Ship of the Babylonian Noah \" in"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"Figure 23 Beitrage zur Assyriologie—Fig. 23) appears to us th e most plausible. It also bears a striking resemblance to a modern submarine, with a conning tower whose hatch is clos ed tight when diving. No wonder, perhaps, that this specially designed ve ssel was described in the Babylonian and Assyrian recensions as a tzulili—a term which even nowadays (in modern Hebre w, Tzolelet) denotes a submersible boat, a submarine. The Sum- erian term for Ziusudra's boat was MA.GUR.GUR, mean ing \"a boat that can turn and tumble.\" According to the biblical version it was built of g opher wood and reeds, with only one hatch, and was covere d with tar-pitch \"within and without.\" The Hebrew term in Genesis for the complete boat was Teba, which denotes somet hing closed on all sides, a \"box\" rather than the common ly trans- lated \"ark.\" Stemming from the Akkadian Tebitu, it is con- sidered by some scholars to signify a \"goods vessel ,\" a cargo ship. But the term, with a hard \"T,\" means \"to sink .\" The boat was thus a \"sinkable\" boat, hermetically seale d, so that even if submerged under the tidal wave of the Delug e, it could survive the watery ordeal and resurface. That it was Enki who had designed the boat also mak es sense. It will be recalled that his epithet-name be fore he was given the title EN.KI (\"Lord of Earth\") was E.A—\"He Whose Home/Abode is Water.\" Indeed, as texts dealin g with the earliest times state, Ea liked to sail the Edin 's waters, alone or with mariners whose sea songs he liked. Su merian depictions (Fig. 24a,b) showed him with streams of water— the prototype of Aquarius (which, as a constellatio n, was the zodiacal House honoring him).

A seasoned s ailor and an expert shipbuilder, it was he, more than any other one of the Anunnaki, who could devise and design the in genious boat that could withstand the Deluge. Noah's Ark and its construction are key components of the Deluge tale, for without such a boat Mankind would have perished as Enlil had wished.

In another detail from the Mesopotami an texts we also learn that the group also included an exper t navigator, Puzur-Amurri by name, whom Enki provided and who wa s instructed where to veer the boat once the tidal wa ve subsided. Even though the loading and boarding were completed , Atra-hasis/Utnapishtim himself could not sit still inside and he was entering and leaving the boat constantly, ne rvously waiting for the signal that Enki had told him to wa tch for: When Shamash, ordering a trembling at dusk, will shower a rain of eruptions— board thou the ship, batten up the entrance! The signal was to be the launching of spacecraft at Sippar, the site of the Spaceport of the Anunnaki some one hundred miles north of Shuruppak. For it was the plan of th e Anun- naki to gather in Sippar and from there ascend into Earth orbit. Atra-hasis/Utnapishtim was told to watch the skies for such a \"shower of eruptions,\" the thunder and flame s of the launched spacecraft that made the ground tremble. \" Sha- mash\"—then the \"Eagleman\" in charge of the Spacepor t— \"had set a stated time,\" Enki told his faithful Ear thling.

The source of the waters were the \"fountains of the Great Deep\"—a term that referred to the great and deep oceanic waters beyond Africa. The av alanche of water \"submerged the dams of the dry land\"—the c oastal continental barriers. As the ice over Antarctica sl ipped into the Indian Ocean it caused an immense tidal wave. G ushing forth across the ocean northward, the wall of water over- whelmed the continental coastline of Arabia and rus hed up the Persian Gulf. Then it reached the funnel of The Land Between the Rivers, engulfing all the lands (Fig. 2 6.) How global was the Deluge? Was every place upon our globe actually inundated? The human recollection is almost global and suggests an almost-global event. What is certain is that with the eventual melting of the slipped ic e, and the rise in global temperatures following the initial c ooling, the Ice Age that had held Earth in its grip for the pre vious 62,000 years abruptly ended. It happened about 13,000 year s ago. One result of the catastrophe was that Antarctica, for the first time in so many thousands of years, was freed of its ice cover.

It deals with the events, millennia late r, when a deadly dispute arose between the Anunnaki concernin g the supremacy on Earth. As the zodiacal age of the Bull (Taurus) was giving way to that of the Ram (Aries), Marduk, the Firstborn son of Enki, asserted that his time had c ome to take over the supremacy from Enlil and his legal he ir. When instruments located at sacred precincts in Sumer in dicated that the new age of the Ram had not yet arrived, Ma rduk complained that they reflected changes that had occ urred be- cause \"the Erakallum quaked and its covering was di min- ished, and the measures could no longer be taken.\" Erakallum is a term whose precise meaning escapes t he scholars; it used to be translated \"Lower World\" bu t is now left in scholarly studies untranslated. In When Tim e Began we have suggested that the term denotes the land at th e bottom of the world—Antarctica, and that the \"covering\" th at had diminished was the ice cover that had slipped circa 13,000 years ago but grew back to some extent by 4,000 yea rs ago.

The unexpected encounter was full of surprising asp ects; their bearing on the human search for Immortality l ingered for ten thousand years, and beyond.

The sequence of events is retained—the cessation of the tidal wave, the falling level of water, the sending out of birds to scout t he terrain, the arrival at Ararat, the stepping out of the ark, the building of an altar, and the offering of burnt sacrifices; followed by the recanting triggered by the sweet savory smell o f the roasted meat, and the blessing of Noah and his sons . As Utnapishtim recalled it when he told \"the secret of the gods\" to Gilgamesh, after he had come out of the bo at, he \"offered a sacrifice and poured out a libation on t he moun- taintop, set up seven and seven cult vessels, heape d upon their pot-stands cane, cedarwood and myrtle.\" The g ods, emerging from their spacecraft as they too landed o n the mountain, \"smelled the sweet savor, crowded like fl ies about the sacrificer.\""},{"pageNumber":108,"pageContent":"104 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Soon Ninmah arrived and realized what had happened.

It was an unheard-of ceremony, a unique Divine Encounter i n which the deity had physically taken the chosen humans by the hand and, standing between them, physically touched their foreheads to convey a divine attribute.

The feared catastrophic results from Earth's warmin g focus presently on the possible melting of Antarctica's i ce. The smaller accumulation is in the west, where the ice cap part ly rises over water. A warming of only 2° can cause the melting o f this ice cap to raise the level of all the world's oceans by 20 feet. More calamitous would be the slippage of the eastern ice cap (see Fig. 26) as a result of a water-mud \"lubricant\" forming at its bottom from sheer pressure or volcanic activity; that woul d raise all sea levels by 200 feet (Scientific American, March 1993 ). If instead of melting gradually the Antarctic ice c ap would slip into the surrounding oceans all at once, the tidal wave would be immense, for it would pour all this water in one sp ill.

Evidence for \"the Earth's greatest flood at the end of the last ice age\" has been reported in Science (15 Janu ary 1993). It was a \"cataclysmic flood\" whose waters, rushing at the rate of 650 million cubic feet per second (sic!) broke t hrough the ice dams northwest of the Caspian Sea and streamed through the barrier of the Altay Mountains in a 1,500-foot- high wave.

Lest Enlil become unhappy ag ain with humanity, the choice of a king was his prerogative; and in Sumerian what we call \"Kingship\" was called \"Enlils hip.\" We read in the texts that the decision to create Ki ngship came only after great turmoil and warfare among the Anun- naki themselves—conflicts that we have termed Pyram id Wars in our book The Wars of Gods and Men.

The Bible recalls Enid's change of heart and blessi ng of the remnants by stating that \"Elohim blessed Noah a nd his sons and said unto them: Be fruitful and multiply a nd replen- ish the Earth.\" The Bible then, in what is called t he Table of Nations (Genesis chapter 10), proceeds to list t he tribal nations that have descended of the three sons of No ah— Shem, Ham, and Japhet—the three major groupings tha t we still recognize as the Semitic peoples of the Near East, the Hamitic peoples of Africa, and the Indo-Europeans o f Ana- tolia and the Caucasus who had spread to Europe and India.

They all em anated from Sumer, the biblical Shine'ar. The Sumerian \"fi rst\" in Kingship is further evidenced by the biblical use o f the term \"Mighty Man\" to describe the first king, for this i s a literal rendering of the Sumerian word for king, LU.GAL—\"Gr eat/ Mighty Man.\" There have been many attempts to identify \"Nimrod.\" Since according to Sumerian \"myths\" it was Ninurta, the Foremost Son of Enlil, who was given the task of in stituting \"Enlilship\" in Kish, Nimrod might have been the Heb rew name for Ninurta. If it is a man's name, no one kno ws what it was in Sumerian because the clay tablet is damag ed there.

One has to do with Etana, cle arly a beloved king known for a major benevolent achieveme nt (the \"consolidation of all countries\"), who was deprived of a son and natural successor because of his wife's malady; and the only remedy was the Plant of Birth, which could be obtained only in the Heavens. The story thus leads to Etana' s dramatic attempts to reach the Gates of Heaven, borne aloft on the wings of an eagle (a part of the tale that was depi cted on cylinder seals from the twenty-fourth century B . C .—Fig. 30). The other story line deals with the Eagle, its frie ndship at first and then quarrel with a Serpent, resulting in the Eagle's imprisonment in a pit from which it is saved by Eta na in a mutually beneficial deal: Etana rescues the Eagle a nd repairs its wings in exchange for the Eagle's acting as a s paceship that takes Etana to distant heavens. Several Sumerian texts convey historical data in th e form of an allegorical disputation (some of which we had already mentioned), and scholars are uncertain where in the Eagle- Serpent segment allegory ends and a historical reco rd begins.

All of this spells actuality, a record of facts. The unusual presence of the Igigi in a city on land , the fact that Utu/Shamash was commander of the Spacepor t (by then in the Fourth Region), and the designation of the pilot- cum-spacecraft of Etana as an Eagle, suggest that t he conflict echoed in the Etana tale had to do with space fligh t.

They were the Igigi, wh o came down to Earth, occupied the city, barred its seven gates against the opposing forces, and patrolled the plac e until order was restored under a new chosen king capable of \"co nsol- idating the lands.\" That new ruler was Etana. His n ame can best be translated as \"Strongman,\" and must have be en a favorite name for boys in the ancient Near East for it is encountered several times as a personal name in the Hebrew Bible (as Ethan). Not unlike executive searches in our times, he too was selected after \"Ishtar was looking for a shepherd and searching high and low for a king.\" After Ishta r had come up with Etana as a candidate for the throne, E nlil looked him over and approved: \"A king is hereby aff irmed for the land,\" he announced; and \"in Kish a throne- dais for Etana he established.\" With this done, \"the Igigi t urned away from the city\" and presumably returned to their spa ce stations. And Etana, having \"consolidated the land,\" turned h is mind to the need for a male heir. The tragedy of a childless spouse, unable to bear a succes- sor for her husband, is a theme encountered in the Bible beginning with the Patriarchal tales. Sarah, the wi fe of Abra- ham, was unable to bear children until a Divine Enc ounter at age ninety; in the meantime, her handmaiden Haga r bore Abraham a son (Ishmael) and the stage was set for a succes- sion conflict between the Firstborn and the younger Legal Heir (Isaac). Isaac in turn had to \"entreat Yahweh in behalf of his wife, because she was barren.\" She was able to con- ceive only after Yahweh had \"let himself be entreat ed.\" Throughout the biblical narratives the belief persi sts that it is from the Lord that the ability to conceive is gr anted, and in turn withheld. When Abimelech the king of Gerar took Sarah away from Abraham, \"Yahweh closed up every wo mb in the house of Abimelech\" and the affliction was r emoved only after an appeal by Abraham.

She was af- flicted with a LA.BU disease which prevented her br inging to full term the children that she did conceive. In his despera- tion, Etana envisioned dire forebodings. In a dream \"he saw the city of Kish sobbing; in the city, the people w ere mourn- ing; there was a song of lamentation.\" Was it for h im, be- cause \"Etana cannot have an heir,\" or for his wife— an omen of death? Thereafter, \"his wife said to Etana: the god showed me a dream. Like Etana my husband, I have had a dream.\" In the dream she saw a man. He held a plant in his hand; i t was a shammu sha aladi, a Plant of Birth. He kept pouring cold water on it so that it might \"become established in his house.\" He brought the plant to his city and into h is house. From the plant there blossomed a flower; then the p lant with- ered away. Etana was certain that the dream was a divine omen. \"Who would not reverence such a dream!\" he said. \"The co mmand of the gods has gone forth!\" he exclaimed; the reme dy to the malady \"has come upon us.\" Where was this plant, Etana asked his wife. But, sh e said, in her dream \"I could not see where it was growing. \" Con- vinced however that the dream was an omen that must come true, Etana went in search of it. He crossed rivers and moun- tain streams, he rode to and fro. But he could not find the plant. Frustrated, Etana sought divine guidance. \"E very day Etana prayed repeatedly to Shamash.\" Coupling appea ls with remonstration, \"O Shamash, you have enjoyed the bes t cuts of my sheep,\" he said. \"The soil has absorbed the b lood of my lambs. I have honored the gods!\" \"The interprete rs of dreams,\" he continued, \"have made full use of my in cense.\" Now it was up to the deities themselves, those \"who have made full use of my slaughtered lambs,\" to interpre t the dream for him.

But ap par- ently it was not a face-to-face encounter, for we r ead next that \"Shamash made his voice heard and spoke to Eta na.\" And this was what the divine voice said: Go along the road, cross the mountain. Find a pit and look carefully at what is inside it. An Eagle is abandoned down there. He will obtain for you the Plant of Birth. Following the god's instructions Etana found the pi t and the Eagle inside it. Demanding to know why Etana ha d come hither, me Eagle was told of Etana's problem, and t old Etana his sad story. Soon a deal was struck: Etana would help raise the Eagle out of the pit and help him fly again; in exchange the Eagle would find for Etana the Plant of Birth. With the aid of a six-runged ladder Etana brought the Eagle up; with copper he repaired his wings. Fit to fly, the Eagle began to search for the magical plant in the mountains. \"But the Plant of Birth was not found there.\" As despair and disappointment engulfed Etana, he ha d an- other dream.

Ra was followed on the divine throne of Egypt by fo ur brother-sister couples: first his own children Shu (\"Dryness\") and Tefnut (\"Moisture\"), and then by their children Geb (\"Who Piles Up the Earth\") and Nut (\"The Stretched- out Firmament of the Sky\"). Geb and Nut then had four c hildren: Asar (\"The All-Seeing\") whom the Greeks called Osir is, who married his sister Ast, whom we know as Isis; a nd Seth (\"The Southerner\") who married his sister Nebt-hat, alias Nephtys. To keep the peace, Egypt was divided betwe en Osiris (who was given Lower Egypt in the north) and Seth (who was assigned Upper Egypt in the south). But Se th deemed himself entitled to all of Egypt, and never accepted the division. Using subterfuge, he managed to seize Osiris, cut up his body into fourteen pieces, and dispersed the pieces all over Egypt. But Isis managed to retrieve the pi eces (all except for the phallus) and put together the mutila ted body, thereby resurrecting the dead Osiris to life in the Other World. Of him the sacred writings said: He entered the secret gates, the glory of the Lord of Eternity, in step with him who shines in the horizon, on the path of Ra.

The journey to this ultimate Divine Encounter was a simu- lated one; but to simulate one has to emulate a rea l, actual precedent—a journey that the gods themselves, and s pecifi- cally so the resurrected Osiris, had actually taken from the shores of the Nile to Neter-Khert, \"The Gods' Moun- tainland,\" where an Ascender would take them aloft in the Duat, a magical \"Abode for rising to the stars.\" Much of what we know of those simulated journeys co mes from the Pyramid Texts, texts whose origin is lost in the mists of time that are known from their repeated qu oting inside Pharaonic pyramids (especially those of Unas , Teti, Pepi I, Merenra, and Pepi II who had reigned betwee n 2350 and 2180 B.C.). Exiting his burial tomb (which was never inside a pyramid) through a false door, the king ex pected to be met by a divine herald who would \"take hold of t he king by the arm and take him to heaven.\" As the Pharaoh thus began his Journey to the Afterlife, the priests bro ke out in a chant: \"The king is on his way to Heaven! The king is on his way to Heaven!\" The journey—so realistic and geographically precise that one forgets it was supposed to be simulated—began, as stated, by passing through the false door that face d east; the destination of the Pharaoh was thus eastward, away from Egypt and toward the Sinai peninsula. The first obs tacle was a Lake of Reeds; the term is almost identical to th at of the biblical Sea of Reeds that the Israelites managed t o cross when its waters miraculously parted, and undoubtedl y refers in both instances to the chain of lakes that still run almost the whole length of the border between Egypt and th e Sinai, from north to south. In the case of the Pharaoh, it was a Divine Ferryma n who, after some tough questioning regarding the Pharaoh' s quali- fications, decided to let the king cross. The Divin e Ferryman brought the magical boat over from the lake's far s ide, but it was the Pharaoh who had to recite magical formul as to"},{"pageNumber":127,"pageContent":"The Gates of Heaven 123 make the boat sail back. Once the formulas were rec ited, the ferryboat began to move by itself and the steering oar directed itself. In every respect, the boat was self-propell ed! Beyond the lake there stretched a desert, and beyon d it the Pharaoh could see in the distance the Mountains of the East. But no sooner had the Pharaoh alighted from the boa t, than he was stopped by four Divine Guards, who were cons picu- ous by their black hair that was arranged in curls on their foreheads, at their temples, and at the back of the ir heads, with braids in the center of their heads. They, too , questioned the Pharaoh, but finally let him pass. A text (known only from its quotes) titled The Book of Two Ways described the alternatives that now faced the Pha- raoh, for he could see two passes that led through the moun- tain range beyond which the Duat was. Such two pass es, nowadays called the Giddi and Mitla passes, offered since time immemorial unto the most recent wars the only viable way into the center of the peninsula, be it for arm ies or nomads or pilgrims. Pronouncing the required Uttera nces, the Pharaoh is shown the correct pass. Ahead lies an ar id and barren land, and Divine Guards pop up unexpectedly. \"Where goest thou?\" they demand to know of the mort al who appears in the gods' region. The Divine Herald, alter- nately seen and unseen, speaks up: \"The king goes t o Heaven, to possess life and joy,\" he says. As the g uards hesitate, the king himself pleads with them: ' 'Ope n the fron- tier .. . incline its barrier ... let me pass as th e gods pass through!\" In the end the Divine Guards let the king through, and he has finally reached the Duat. The Duat was conceived as an enclosed Circle of the Gods, at the headpoint of which the sky (represented by t he goddess Nut) opened so that the Imperishable Star (represen ted by the Celestial Disc) could be reached (Fig. 35); geograp hically it was an oval valley, enclosed by mountains, through which shallow streams flowed. The streams were so shallow , or sometimes even so dry, that the Barge of Ra had to be towed or, otherwise, moved by its own power as a sled.

Let us descend and confou nd there their tongue so that they may not understand each o ther's speech.\" It happened, by our calculations, circa 34 50 B . C . This tradition reflects Sumerian assertions that \"o nce upon a time,\" in an idyllic past when \"man had no rivals \" and all the lands \"rested in security,\" \"the people in unis on to Enlil in one tongue gave speech.\" Those idyllic times are recalled in a Sumerian text known as Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta that deals with a p ower struggle and a test of wills between Enmerkar, a ruler of Ur uk (the biblical Erech), and the king of Aratta (in the Indus Valley ) circa 2850 B .

Viewing the expansion of Enlilite control unfavorab ly, Enki sought to inflame the War of Words between the two rulers by confusing their language.

But to embark on the journey that would trans late them to an Everlastingness, they had first to die. Gilgamesh sought to achieve Immortality by refusing to die . .. The result was an adventure-filled search for Immor- tality whose tale became one of the most famous epi cs of the ancient world, known to us primarily from an Ak kadian recension written on twelve clay tablets.

There a semidivine dynasty began with Meskiaggasher, \"the son of the god Utu,\" who was the high priest of the Eanna temple and became king as well. He was followed on the roy al throne by his son Enmerkar (\"He who built Uruk,\" th e great city beside the sacred precinct) and his grandson L ugal- banda—both rulers of whom heroic tales were written down.

Man, the tallest, cannot stretch to heaven; Man, the widest, cannot cover the earth. \"I peered over the wall, saw the dead bodies,\" Gilg amesh said to Shamash, referring perhaps to a cemetery. \" Will I too 'peer over the wall,' will I too be fated thus? \" But his godfather's answer was not reassuring. \"When the go ds cre- ated Mankind,\" Shamash responded, \"death for Mankin d they allotted; life they retained in their own keep ing.\" There- fore, Shamash advised, live day by day, enjoy life while you can—\"Let full be thy belly, make thou merry day and night! On each day make thou a feast of rejoicing, day and night dance thou and play!\" Though the god's admonition concluded with the advi ce that Gilgamesh let his spouse \"delight in thy bosom ,\" Gil- gamesh read into the words of Shamash a different m eaning. \"Make merry day and night,\" he was told in reply to his concerns about aging and looming death; and he took it as a hint that \"joyful sex\" would keep him young. He thu s made it a habit of roaming the streets of Uruk by night, and when he came upon a just-married couple, he demanded the right to have the first sex with the bride.

No sooner was this planned than Gilgamesh did have a dream. He went to his mother, \"beloved and wise Nin sun who is versed in all knowledge,\" and told her of hi s dream: My mother, I saw a dream last night. There appeared stars in the heavens.

Accepting the omens, Gilgamesh said: \"Let it fall t hen, according to the will of Enlil.\" And then, one night, as Gilgamesh went out to have his sexual joys, Enkidu barred his way and would not al low Gilgamesh to enter the house where newlyweds were a bout to go to bed. A struggle ensued; \"they grappled eac h other, holding fast like bulls.\" Walls shook, doorposts sh attered as the two wrestled.

This time Gilgamesh awoke with a start. \"Did you ar ouse me?\" he asked Enkidu, \"Did you touch me, did you ca ll my name?\" No, said Enkidu. Then perhaps it was a god w ho had passed by, Gilgamesh said, for in his second dr eam he"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"In Search of Immortality 139 again saw a mountain topple; \"it laid me low, trapp ed my feet.\" There was an overpowering glare and a man ap peared; \"the fairest in the land was he. From under the top pled ground he pulled me out; he gave me water to drink, my heart quieted; on the ground he set my feet.\" Again Enkidu reassured Gilgamesh. The \"mountain\" th at toppled was the slain Huwawa, he explained. \"Your d ream is favorable!\" he said to Gilgamesh, urging him to go back to sleep. As they both fell asleep, the tranquility of the ni ght was shattered by a thunderous noise and a blinding ligh t, and Gilgamesh was not sure whether he was dreaming or s eeing a true vision. This is how the text quotes Gilgames h: The vision that I saw was wholly awesome! The heavens shrieked, the earth boomed! Though daylight was dawning, darkness came. Lightning flashed, a flame shot up. The clouds swelled, it rained death! Then the glow vanished; the fire went out. And all that had fallen was turned to ashes. Did Gilgamesh realize, right then and there, that h e had witnessed the launching of a Shem, a skyrocket—the shaking of the ground as the engines ignited and roared, th e clouds of smoke and \"raining death,\" darkening the dawn sk y; the brilliance of the engine's flames seen through the thick cloud, as the skyrocket rose up; and then the vanishing gl ow, and the burnt ashes falling back to Earth as the only f inal evidence of the rocket's launch. Did Gilgamesh realize that he had indeed arrived at the \"Landing Place,\" where he cou ld find the Shem that would make him immortal? Apparently h e did, for in spite of cautionary words by Enkidu, he was certain that it was all a good omen, a signal from Shamash that he ought to press on. But before the Cedar Forest could be penetrated and the Landing Place be reached, the terrifying guardian, Huwawa, had to be overcome. Enkidu knew where a gate was, a nd in the morning the comrades made their way toward it, careful to avoid \"weapon-trees that kill.\" Reaching the gat e, Enkidu"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"140 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS tried to open it. An unseen force threw him back, a nd for twelve days he lay paralyzed. The narrative reveals that En- kidu rubbed himself with plants, creating a \"double mantle of radiance\" mat made \"paralysis leave the arms, im potence leave the loins.\" While Enkidu was lying immobilized, Gilgamesh made a discovery: he found a tunnel that led into the fore st. Its en- trance was overgrown with trees and bushes and it w as blocked by rocks and soil. \"While Gilgamesh cut dow n the trees, Enkidu dug up\" the rocks and soil. After a w hile they found themselves inside the forest, and saw ahead a path—the path \"where Huwawa made tracks as he went to and fr o.\" For a while the comrades stood awestruck. Motionles s \"they beheld the Cedar Mountain, the dwelling place of the gods, shrine-place of Inanna.\" They \"gazed and gaze d at the height of the cedars, gazed and gazed at the pathwa y into the forest.

In a scene that b rings to mind the much later encounter between the boy David and the giant Goliath, when the latter felt insulted by the uneven match and threatened to \"give thy flesh unto the fo wls of the air and to the beasts of the field,\" so did Huw awa belittle and threaten the twosome: \"You are so very small th at I regard you as a turtle and a tortoise,\" his voice a nnounced; \"were I to swallow you, I would not satisfy my stom ach .. . So I shall bite your windpipe and neck, Gilgamesh, and leave your body for the birds of the forest and for the r oaring beasts.\" Seized with fear, the comrades now saw the monster ap- pear. He was \"mighty, his teeth as the teeth of a d ragon, his face the face of a lion, his coming like the on rushing floodwaters.\" From his forehead there emanated a \"r adiant beam; it devoured trees and bushes.\" From this weap on's \"killing force, none could escape.\" A Sumerian cyli nder seal"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"In Search of Immortality 141 Figure 41 which depicts a mechanical monster (Fig. 41) might have had Huwawa in mind.

Hu- wawa, the deity explained, usually protects himself with \"seven cloaks,\" but now \"only one he had donned, si x are still off.\" They could therefore slay Huwawa with t he weap- ons they had, if only they could approach him close ly enough; and to make that possible, Shamash said, he would create a whirlwind that \"would beat against the eye s of Hu- wawa\" and neutralize his death-beam.

But, to her surprise, Gilgamesh turned down her invitation. Listing only the few worldly possession s that he could offer her, he foresaw her quick tiring of him and his lovemaking. Sooner or later, he said, she would get rid of him as of \"a shoe that pinches the foot of its owne r.\" I will obtain for you eternal life, Ishtar announce d. But that, too, could not convince Gilgamesh. Listing al l her known lovers, whom she used and discarded, \"which o f your lovers lasted forever?\" Gilgamesh asked, \"which of your masterful paramours went to heaven?\" And, he conclu ded, \"if you will love me, you shall treat me just like them.\" \"When Ishtar heard this, Ishtar was enraged, and to the skies flew off.'\" In her fury at being rejected, sh e appealed to Anu to punish Gilgamesh, who \"had disgraced me.\" She asked Anu for the Bull of Heaven so that it might s mite Gilgamesh. At first Anu refused, but in the end he yielded to the pleas and threats of Ishtar, and \"put the re ins of the Bull of Heaven in her hands.\" (GUD.ANNA, the Sumerian term employed in the ancien t texts, is commonly translated \"Bull of Heaven,\" but it could also be understood to more literally mean the \"Bull of Anu.\" The term was also the Sumerian name for the celesti al con- stellation of the Bull (Taurus), which was associat ed with Enlil. The \"Bull of Heaven\" that was kept in the Ce dar Forest guarded by Enlil's monster could have been a specially selected bull, or the \"prototype\" bull seeded from Nibiru to create bulls on Earth. Its counterpart in Egypt was the sacred Apis Bull.) Attacked by the Bull of Heaven, the comrades forgot all about the Landing Place and the search for Immortal ity, and fled for their lives. Aided by Shamash, the \"distan ce of a month and fifteen days in three days they traversed .\" Arriv- ing in Uruk, Gilgamesh sought protection behind its ramparts while Enkidu waited outside, to face the attacker.

In this first-ever recorded bullfight, \"Enkidu seiz ed the Bull of Heaven by its thick tail and spun it around . Then Gilgames, like a butcher, between neck and horns th rust his sword.

Hallucinating, he envisioned being sentence d to death. But the final decision was to commute his de ath sen- tence to hard labor in the \"Land of Mines,\" a place where copper and turquoise were obtained by backbreaking toil in dark tunnels. Here the saga, already filled with more dramatic an d unex- pected twists and turns than the best of thrillers, took yet another unforeseen turn. The \"Land of Mines\" was lo cated in the Fourth Region, the Sinai peninsula; and it d awned on Gilgamesh that here was a second chance for him to join the gods and attain immortality, for the \"Land of Livin g\"—the Spaceport where the Shem rocketships were based, co m- manded by Shamash—was also there, in the Fourth Reg ion. So, if Shamash could arrange for him to accompany E n- kidu, he (Gilgamesh) would reach the Land of Living ! Seeing this unique opportunity, Gilgamesh appealed to Sham ash: O Shamash, The Land I wish to enter; he thou my ally! The Land which with the cool cedars is aligned, 1 wish to enter; be thou my ally! In the places where the Shems have been raised, Let me set up my Shem! When Shamash responded by describing to Gilgamesh t he hazards and difficulties of the land route, Gilgame sh had a bright idea: He and Enkidu would sail there by boat ! A Magan boat—a \"ship of Egypt\"—was outfitted. And, ac - companied by fifty heroes as sailors and protectors , the two comrades sailed away. The route, by all indications , was down the Persian Gulf, around we Arabian peninsula, and up the Red Sea until the Sinai coast was to be reached . But the planned voyage was not to be. When Enlil demanded that \"Enkidu shall die,\" and th e death sentence was commuted to hard labor in the La nd of"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"146 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Figures 44a and 44b Mines, it was decreed by the gods that two emissari es, \"clothed like birds, with wings for garments,\" shal l take Enkidu by the hand and carry him thereto (Fig. 44a) . The sea voyage contradicted that, and the wrath of Enli l was yet to come. Now, as the ship sailed close to the Arabi an coast and me sun was setting, those on board could see so meone— \"if a man he be, or a god he be\"—standing on a moun d \"like a bull,\" equipped with a ray-emitting device (Fig. 44b). As if by an unseen hand, the \"three ply cloth\" that was the ship's sail suddenly tore apart. Next, the ship its elf was thrust on its side and capsized. It sank fast, like a ston e in water, and all aboard with it, except Gilgamesh and Enkidu . As Gilgamesh swam out of the ship and up, dragging Enk idu along, he could see the others seated where they we re, \"as though living creatures.\" In the sudden death, they just froze in whatever position they were. The two sole survivors reached the shore and spent the night on an unknown coast discussing what to do. Gi lgamesh was undeterred in his desire to reach the Land of L iving; Enkidu advised that they seek the way back to Uruk. But the die was already cast for Enkidu; his limbs became n umb, his insides were disintegrating. Gilgamesh exhorted his comrade to hold on to life, but to no avail. For six days and seven nights Gilgamesh mourned Enk idu; then he walked away, roaming the wilderness aimless ly, won- dering not when but how he too shall die: \"When I d ie, shall I not be like Enkidu?\" Little did he know that after all the previous adve ntures, after the diverse Divine Encounters, after the drea ms and"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"In Search of Immortality 147 visions, the real and the imagined, the fights and the flights, and now all alone—that only now his most memorable saga was about to begin. How long Gilgamesh roamed aimlessly in the wilderne ss, the ancient epic does not tell. He trod unbeaten pa ths encoun- tering no man, hunting for food. \"What mountains he had climbed, what streams he had crossed, no man can kn ow,\" the ancient scribes noted. Finally he took hold of himself. \"Must I lay my head inside the earth and sleep thro ugh all the years?\" he asked himself, and join his comrade in death, or would the gods \"let mine eyes behold the sun?\" A gain he was filled with determination to avoid a mortal' s fate by reaching the Land of Living. Guided by the rising and setting sun—the celestial counter- part of Shamash—Gilgamesh trekked in a purposeful m anner. As day followed day, the terrain began to change: t he flat desert wilderness, home of lizards and scorpions, w as ending and he could see mountains in the distance. The wil dlife was also changing. \"When at night he arrived at the mou ntain pass, Gilgamesh saw lions and grew afraid.\" He lifted his head to Sin and prayed: \"To the place where the gods rejuvenate my steps are directed ... Preserve thou me!\" The change from Shamash to Sin (the father of Shama sh) as the protecting deity to whom the prayer is addre ssed is made in the text without pause or comment; and we a re left to presume that somehow Gilgamesh had realized that he had reached a region dedicated to Sin. Gilgamesh \"went to sleep and awoke from a dream,\" i n which he saw himself \"rejoice with life.\" He took i t as a favorable omen from Sin, that he would manage to cr oss the mountain pass despite the lions roaming there. Gath ering his weapons, \"Gilgamesh like an arrow descended among t he lions,\" striking the beasts with all his strength: \"He smote them, he hacked away at them.\" But by midday his we apons shattered and Gilgamesh threw them away. Two lions were"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"still left facing him; and Gilgamesh now had to fig ht them with his bare hands. The fight with the lions, in which Gilgamesh was th e vic- tor, was commemorated by artists throughout the anc ient Near East, and not only in Mesopotamia (Fig. 45a). It was depicted by the Hittites (Fig. 45b) to the north, t he Cassites in Luristan to the east (Fig. 45c), even in ancient Egypt (Fig. 45d). In later times such a feat—vanquishing lions with bare hands—was attributed in the Bible only to Samson, h e of the god-given superhuman power (Judges 14:5-6). Clad in the skin of one of the lions, Gilgamesh tra versed the mountain pass. In the distance he saw a body of water, like a vast lake. In the plain beyond the inland se a he could see a city \"closed-up about,\" a city surrounded by a fortified wall. It was, the epic text explains, a city where \"the temple to Sin was dedicated.\" Outside the city, \"down by t he low- lying sea,\" Gilgamesh could see an inn. As he appro ached the inn, he could see inside \"Siduri, the ale-woman .\" There were vat stands, fermentation vats, inside; and the ale-woman, Siduri, was holding a jug of ale and a bowl of yell ow por- ridge. Gilgamesh paced around, seeking a way to ent er; but Siduri, seeing an unkempt man wearing a lion's skin , \"his belly shrunk, his face like that of a wayfarer from afar,\" was frightened and bolted the door.

His destination, he explained , was the Land of Living; Immortality could be attained there , for Ut- napishtim of Deluge fame was still living mere. Wha t is the way to the Land of Living? Gilgamesh asked Siduri. Must he go the long and hazardous way around me sea, or could he sail across it? \"Now, ale-woman, which is the wa y to Utnapishtim? Give me the directions!\" Crossing the sea, the ale-woman answered, was not p ossi- ble, for its waters are \"the Waters of Death:\" Never, Gilgamesh, has there been a crossing; From days of long ago, no one arrived from across the sea. Valiant Shamash did cross the sea, but other than Shamash, who can cross it? As Gilgamesh fell silent, Siduri revealed to him th at mere could be a way, after all, to cross the Waters of D eath: Utnap- ishtim has a boatman; his name is Urshanabi. Urshan abi can cross the Waters of Death because \"with him are the Stone Things.\" He comes across to pick up Urnu (meaning u nclear) in the woods. Go and wait for him, Siduri said to G ilgamesh, \"let him see your face.\" If it suits him, he will t ake you across. So advised, Gilgamesh went to the shore to await the boatman Urshanabi. When Urshanabi saw him, he wondered who Gilgamesh was, and Gilgamesh told him the long story. Convinc ed of the true identity of Gilgamesh and his legitimate w ish to reach the Land of Living, Urshanabi took Gilgamesh aboard. But no sooner than this was done, Urshanabi accused Gil- gamesh of smashing the \"Stone Things\" required for the crossing. Reprimanding Gilgamesh, Urshanabi told hi m to go back to the forest, cut to shape 120 poles; and use up the poles in groups of twelve as they sailed across. Af ter three days, they reached the other side. Where shall I go now? Gilgamesh asked Urshanabi. Ur sha- nabi told him to go straight ahead until he reached \"a regular"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"150 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS way\" that leads toward \"the Great Sea.\" He was to f ollow that road until he reached two stone columns that s erve as markers. Turning there, he would come to a town nam ed (in the Hittite recension of the epic) Itla, sacred to the god Ullu- Yah. That god's permission was needed in order to c ross into the Forbidden Region where Mount Mashu was; th at, Urshanabi said, is your destination. Itla proved a mixed blessing for Gilgamesh. Arrivin g there he ate and drank, washed and changed to proper atti re. On the advice of Shamash, he offered sacrifices to Ull u-Yah (meaning, perhaps, \"He of the Peaks\"). But the Grea t God, learning of the king's wish for a Shem, vetoed the idea. Seek- ing the intercession of Shamash, Gilgamesh then ple aded with the gods for an alternative: \"Let me take the road to Utnapishtim, the son of Ubar-Tutu!\" And that, after some deliberation, was permitted. After a journey of six days, Gilgamesh could see th e sacred mountain of which Urshanabi the boatman had spoken: The name of the mountain is Mashu. At the mountain of Mashu he arrived, where daily the Shems he watched as they depart and come in. On high, to the Celestial Band it is connected; below, to the Lower World it is hound. There was a way to go inside the mountain, but the en- trance was guarded by awesome \"Rocket-men:\" Rocket-men guard its gate. Their terror is awesome, their glance is death.

However, recogni zing that he was not a mere mortal, they let him through. \"Th e gate of the Mount is open to thee!\" they announced. The \"inaccessible tract\" was a subterranean \"path o f Sha- mash.\" The passage through it lasted twelve double- hours. \"The darkness was dense, there was no light.\" Gilga mesh could not see \"ahead or behind.\" In the eighth doub le-hour something made him scream with fear. In the ninth d ouble- hour \"he felt a north wind fanning his face\"—he was nearing an opening to the sky. In the eleventh double-hour he could see dawn breaking. Finally, in the twelfth double-h our, \"it had grown bright; he came out in front of the sun.\" Out of the subterranean passage through the sacred moun- tain, in sunlight, Gilgamesh came upon an incredibl e sight. He saw \"an enclosure of the gods\" wherein there was a garden; but the \"garden\" was made up entirely of a r t i f i c i a l l y carved precious stones: \"All kinds of thorny Prickl y Bushes Figure 46"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"152 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS were visible, blooming with gemstones; Carnelian bo re fruit hanging in clusters, its vines too beautiful to beh old.

Pure water ran through the garden, and i n its midst he saw \"like a Tree of Life and a Tree of ... that of An-gug stones were made.\" Enthralled and amazed, Gilgamesh walked about the g arden. Clearly, he found himself in a simulated Garden of Eden! Unbeknown to him, he was being watched by Utnapisht im. \"Utnapishtim was looking from a distance, pondered and spoke to himself, took counsel with himself:\" who i s this man and how did he show up here? he wondered; \"he w ho comes here is not one of my men\"—no one who has bee n with him on the ark ... As he approached Gilgamesh, Gilgamesh was astounded : the hero of the Deluge from thousands of years ago was not at all older than he, Gilgamesh, was! \"He said to h im, to Utnapishtim, the Far-Distant: As I look upon thee, Utnapish- tim, thou art no different at all; even as I art th ou!\" But who are you, why and how did you get here? Utnapishtim wanted to know. And, as he had done wit h Si- duri and the boatman, Gilgamesh related the whole s tory of his Kingship, ancestry, comradeship with Enkidu, an d the adventures in search of Immortality, including the latest ones. \"So I thought of going to see Utnapishtim, the Far- Distant, of whom people speak,\" Gilgamesh concluded. Now, he told Utnapishtim, tell me the secret of your Immortality ! Tell me \"how you came to join the congregation of the gods, and attained eternal life?\" Utnapishtim spoke to him, to Gilgamesh: I will reveal to thee, Gilgamesh, a hidden matter, a secret of the gods I will tell thee.

Hitherto Utnapishtim has been mortal (Enlil said), henceforth Utnapishtim and his wife shall be as we gods are; U tnapishtim shall reside far away, at the mouth of the rivers. Thus they took me and made me reside far away, at the mouth of the rivers.\" That, Unapishtim concluded, is the whole truth abou t his escaping a mortal's fate. \"But now, who will for th y sake call the gods to Assembly, that the Life which thou seekest thou mayest find?\" Realizing that only a decree of the gods meeting in Assem- bly could give him Immortality, and not his own sea rches, Gilgamesh passed out; for a week he lay unconscious . When he came to, Utnapishtim called upon Urshanabi the b oatman to take Gilgamesh back, \"that he may return safe on the way by which he came.\" But as Gilgamesh was ready to de part, Utnapishtim, pitying him, decided to disclose to hi m yet an- other secret: Everlasting life is attained not by b eing immor- tal—it is attained by staying forever young! Utnapishtim said to him, to Gilgamesh: Thou hast come hither, toiling and straining. What shall I give thee to take back to your land? Let me disclose, Gilgamesh, a closely-guarded hidden matter— a secret of the gods I will tell thee: A plant there is, like a prickly berrybush is its root. Its thorns are like a brier-vine's; thine hands the thorns will prick. [But] if with thine own hands the plant you could obtain, Rejuvenation you will find. The plant grew underwater, perhaps in the well or s pring in the splendid garden. Some kind of a pipe led to the source or depths of these Waters of Life. No sooner did Gi lgamesh hear the secret, than he \"opened the water-pipe, ti ed heavy"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"154 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS stones to his feet; they dragged him down to the ab yss.\" And there he saw the plant. He took the plant himself though it pricked his hands. He cut the heavy stones from his feet; the second one cast him back to where he had come from. Urshanabi, who had been summoned by Utnapishtim, wa s waiting for him. Triumphant and exhilarated, Gilgam esh showed him the Plant of Rejuvenation. Overcome with excite- ment, he said to the boatman: Urshanabi, This plant of all plants is unique: By it a man can regain the breath of life! I will take it to ramparted Uruk, there the plant to cut and eat. Let its name be called \"Man becomes young in old age.\" Of this plant I shall eat and to my youthful state shall I return. With these high hopes for rejuvenation the two star ted on the way back. \"At thirty leagues they stopped for t he night. Gilgamesh saw a well whose water was cool. He went down into it to bathe in the water. A snake smelt the fr agrance of the plant; it came up silently and carried off the plant. As it took it away, the snake shed its scaly skin.\" It wa s indeed a rejuvenating plant; but it was the snake, not Gil gamesh, who ended up rejuvenated ... Thereupon Gilgamesh sits down and weeps, his tears running down his face. He took the hand of Urshanabi the boatman. \"For whom\" (he asked) \"have my hands toiled? For whom is spent the blood of my heart? For myself I have not obtained a boon; For a snake the boon I affected.''"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"In Search of Immortality 155 Brooding over his misfortune, Gilgamesh recalled an inci- dent during his dive for the plant \"which must have been an omen.\" \"While I was opening the pipe, arranging the gear,\" he told Urshanabi, \"I found a door seal; it must ha ve been placed as an omen for me—a sign to withdraw, to giv e up.\" Now Gilgamesh realized that he was not fated to obt ain the Plant of Rejuvenation; and having plucked it out of its waters, he was fated to lose it. When he finally returned to ramparted Uruk, Gilgame sh sat down and had the scribes write down his odyssey . \"Let me make known to the country him who the Tunnel had seen; of him who knows the waters let me the full s tory tell.\" And it was with those introductory words tha t the Epic of Gilgamesh was recorded, to be read, translated, rewritten, illustrated, and read again for generations thereaf ter—for all to know that Man, even if two-thirds divine, cannot change his fate. The Epic of Gilgamesh is replete with geographical mark- ers that enhance its authenticity and identify the targets of that ancient search for Immortality. The first destination was the Landing Place in the Cedar Forest, in the Cedar Mountains. There was only one such place in the whole of the ancient Near East, renown ed for its unique cedars: Lebanon (whose national emblem, to t his very day, is the cedar tree). Lebanon is specifically me ntioned by name as the land the two comrades reached after the journey of seventeen days from Uruk. In another verse, desc ribing how the earth shook as the skyrocket was launched, the fac- ing peaks \"Sirara and Lebanon\" are described as \"sp litting apart.\" In the Bible (Psalms 27) the majestic Voice of the Lord is described as \"breaking the cedars of Lebano n\" and making \"Lebanon and Sirion skip like a calf.\" There is no doubt that Sirion is Hebrew for Sirara in the Mesop ota- mian text.

The most telling geographical detail in the second journey of Gilgamesh is the body of water he had reached af ter cross- ing the wilderness.

Having crossed the Sea of Death, Gilgamesh followed a way that led \"toward the Great Sea.\" This term too is found in the Bible (e.g. Numbers. 34, Joshua 1) and undis putably referred to the Mediterranean Sea. Giigamesh, howev er, stopped short of going all the way and instead stop ped at the town called Itla in the Hittite recension. Based on archaeolog- ical discoveries and the biblical narrative of the Exodus, Itla was the same place that the bible called Kadesh-Bar nea; it was an ancient caravan town situated at the border of the restricted Fourth Region in the Sinai peninsula. One can only speculate whether the mountain to whic h Giigamesh was directed, Mount Mashu, bore a name th at is almost identical to the Hebrew name of Moses, Moshe . The subterranean journey of Giigamesh inside this sacre d moun- tain, lasting twelve double-hours, is clearly paral leled by the description in the Egyptian Book of the Dead of the Pharaoh's subterranean journey through twelve hour-zones. The Pha- raohs, like Giigamesh, asked for a Shem—a rocketshi p—with which to ascend heavenward and join the gods in an eternal abode. Like Giigamesh before them, the Pharaohs had to cross a body of water and be assisted by a Divine B oatman. There is no doubt that both the Sumerian king's and Egyptian Pharaoh's destination was one and the same, except that they went there from opposite starting points. The desti nation was the Spaceport in the Sinai peninsula, where the She ms, in their underground silos (see Fig. 31) were.

In his case, too, the claim to Immor- tality was based on being partly divine. The eviden ce suggests that Alexander, through his teacher Aristotle, was aware of the earlier searches; but what he probably did not know was that the root of his specific claim to divine paren tage lay in Uruk's GIPAR (\"Nighttime House\") and its inner sanc tum, the GIGUNU. Soon after Alexander was crowned king of Macedonia in lieu of the assassinated Philip II, he went to Delp hi in Greece to consult its famed Oracle. Only twenty years old at the time, he was shocked to hear the first of several p rophecies predicting for him fame, but a very short life. The prophecies served to increase his belief in rumors that had be en circulat- ing in the Macedonian court, according to which Phi lip II was not really his father; but that he was really t he son of an Egyptian Pharaoh by name of Nectanebus who had v isited the Macedonian court and secretly seduced Olympias, Alex- ander's mother. And Nectanebus—a master magician an d di- viner—so the whispering went, was in fact the Egypt ian god Amon, who disguised himself as a man in order to si re the future conqueror of the world. No sooner did Alexander reach Egypt (in 332 B .

There (so the histori ans who 161"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"162 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS had accompanied him reported) the great god himself con- firmed Alexander's divine parentage.

His searches took him to subterran ean places filled with magic and angels in the Sinai peninsula , then (on orders of a Winged Man) to Babylon. In the end, as the Delphic Oracle prophesied, he died famous but young. In his search for immortality Alexander, leaving hi s troops behind, went toward the Land of Darkness, to find t here a mountain called Mushas. At the edge of the desert h e left his few trusted companions and proceeded alone. He saw and followed \"a straight path that had no wail, and it had no high or low place in it.\" He walked therein twelve days and twelve nights, at which point \"he perceived the rad iance of an angel.\" As he drew nearer the radiance became \"a flaming fire,\" and Alexander realized that he was at the \"m ountain from which the whole world is surrounded.\" Speaking to Alexander from the flaming fire, the an gel questioned him, \"Who art thou, and for what reason art thou here, O mortal?\" and wondered how Alexander had man aged \"to penetrate into this darkness, which no other mo rtal hath been able to do.\" Alexander explained that God hims elf had guided him and gave him strength to arrive at this place, \"which is Paradise.\" But the angel told him that th e Water of Life was somewhere else; \"and whosoever drinketh there- from, if it be but a single drop, shall never die.\" To find the \"Well of the Water of Life\" Alexander n eeded a savant who knew such secrets, and after much sear ching such a man was found.

The numerous details of the Alexander search that a re vir- tually identical to those of Gilgamesh—the location , the name of the mountain, the twelve periods of the subterra nean jour- ney, the winged Birdmen, the questioning by the gua rds, the immersion in the well of the Waters of Life—indicat e a fa- miliarity with the Epic of Gilgamesh; not only with the liter- ary work (which continued to survive to our times), but also with the raison d'etre for the search—the partial d ivinity, the divine parentage, of Gilgamesh. Indeed, even the claims by Egyptian Pharaohs that t hey were fathered by gods or, in the very least, nourished w ith mother's milk by a goddess, can be traced to the time and pl ace of Gilgamesh; for it was in Uruk that the custom and t radition began with the dynasty to which Gilgamesh belonged. The Kingship began in Uruk, it will be recalled, wh en the future city consisted almost entirely only of the s acred pre- cinct. There, according to the Sumerian King Lists, \"Mes- kiag-gasher, the son of the god Utu, became high pr iest as well as king.\" Then, after reigns by Enmerkar and L ugal- banda and an intermediate reign by the divine Dumuz i, Gil- gamesh ascended the throne; and he, as stated, was the son of the goddess Ninsun. These are astounding revelations, especially in lig ht of the episode of the taking of human wives by the Nefilim that caused Enlil to seek the annihilation of Mankind. I t took Mankind, the Anunnaki, and the Earth itself millenn ia to re- cover from the trauma of the Deluge. It took millen nia for the Anunnaki to gradually, and step by careful step , grant Mankind knowledge, technology, domestication, and, finally, full-fledged civilizations. It took the better part of a millen- nium to develop, in Kish, the institution of Kingsh ip. And then, so unexpectedly, boom!

Her own genealogy and the reco rd of her offspring are illustrative of the mixing of gen erations that was taking place among the Anunnaki—perhaps as a re sult of the fact that some retained the longevities acqu ired on Nibiru (and counted in Sars), others (the first gen eration on Earth) partly affected by Earth's shorter cycles, a nd yet others (third and fourth generations) more Earthlike than Nibiruan. 164 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Figure 51"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"Encounters in the GIGUNU 165 Figure 53 Anu, who besides his official spouse Antu had numer ous concubines and (at least in one instance) ventured even far- ther afield, had as a result a great number of offi cial and unofficial offspring; we have met so far Enki, Enli l, and Nin- mah, all three half brothers and half sister of eac h other (i.e. born of different mothers). It turns out that Anu h ad yet another, younger daughter, named Bau, who became th e wife of Ninurta, Enlil's son by his half sister Ninmah. As far as one can judge from the texts, Ninurta and Bau (Fig. 53) led an immaculate marriage, unmarred by any infidelitie s. It was a marriage blessed by two sons and seven daughters, of whom Ninsun (\"Lady Wild Cow\") was the best-known one. Th is genealogy made her at one and the same time a grand daugh- ter of Anu as well as a granddaughter of Anu's son Enlil. (Enlil, it ought to be mentioned here, begot Ninurt a on Nib- iru; after Enlil had espoused Ninlil on Earth, he w as scrupu- lously monogamous). No less confusing was the makeup of Ninsun's offspr ing. On the one hand she was the mother of Gilgamesh. Th e Sumerian King Lists state that his father was the H igh Priest of the sacred precinct of Uruk; the Epic of Gilgame sh and other narrative texts concerning him assert that hi s father was Lugalbanda, the third ruler of Uruk. Since the firs t such ruler, Meskiaggasher, was both High Priest and king, the a ssump- tion is that Lugalbanda, too, held both posts. The upshot is that Ninsun, whether officially espoused to the mor tal Lugal- banda or not, had sexual relations with him and bor e him a son."},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"166 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS But on the other hand Ninsun was also having sex wi th gods, or at least one god. According to the Sumeria n King Lists the young god Dumuzi reigned briefly in Uruk, between Lugalbanda and Gilgamesh. The Lists recognize the f ull di- vinity of Dumuzi, for he was a son of Enki. What th e Lists do not mention, but what is attested by considerabl e literary texts dealing with the life, loves, and death of Du muzi, is mat his mother was the goddess Ninsun—the very same god- dess who was the mother of Gilgamesh. Ninsun thus had sexual liaisons with both gods (Enk i) and men (Lugalbanda). In this new phase of Divine Encou nters, she was emulating not only Utu/Shamash (whose spous e was the goddess Aia, yet had a son by a mortal female), but also Inanna/Ishtar, the twin sister of Utu/Shamash. The fact that all these encounters in one way or another involved Uruk was no accident; for it was in Uruk that the GIGUNU —the \"Chamber of Nighttime Pleasures\"—was first establis hed in the Gipar. Unlike Utu/Shamash and Ninsun, Inanna/Ishtar is not men- tioned in the Sumerian King Lists in connection wit h Uruk; but in the Epic of Gilgamesh she joins the two as a featured divine actor in the saga. In a way she belonged in the tale perhaps more than they, for she was the patron-godd ess of Uruk and it was due to her that what was only a sac red precinct became a major great city. How she achieve d that was described in a text known as \"Enki and Inanna\" that we shall soon examine; but first one should explain how Inanna became associated with Uruk—indeed, how she came to be called \"Inanna\" to begin with. When Kingship was transferred from Kish to Uruk at the beginning of the third millennium B . C ., Uruk consisted only of a sacred precinct, the Kullab. That sacred preci nct had existed by then for almost a thousand years, for it was origi- nally built mainly to accommodate Anu and Antu on t heir state visit to Earth.

The two of them, however, do not seem to have shared th e same hedroom. Once the banquet and other ceremonies were complete d and the meal of the night was served, the two divin e visitors were led through the main courtyard to two separate courts. Antu was escorted to the \"House of the Golden Bed,\" and \"the Divine Daughters of Anu and the Divine Daughte rs of Uruk\" kept watch outside till daybreak. Anu was esc orted by male gods to his own quarters, a house known as the Gipar; we know from a number of Sumerian and Akkadi an texts that it was a \"taboo\" place, a harem if you w ill (for that, \"taboo,\" is the meaning of the Arabic word \"harim\")—the place where the Entu, a chosen virgin, was awaiting the god. In later times the Entu was a daughter of the king, and her role as a Hierodule, a \"sacred maiden,\" was deemed a great honor. In the case of Anu and his visit to the Kull ab, how- ever, it was not a mortal female who was chosen to await him in the Gipar; it was his great-granddaughter Ir ninni. They spent the night in the closed-off chamber inside th e Gipar, the Gigunu (\"Chamber of Nighttime Pleasures\"). And after that Irninni was renamed IN.ANNA—\"Anu's Beloved.\" While we may view the encounter as an abhorrent cas e of incest, it was not so deemed at the time. Sumerian hymns extolled the fact that Inanna was Anu's beloved, hi s beautiful Hierodule. A Hymn to Ishtar written on a tablet fro m Uruk (tablet AO .4479 in the Louvre Museum) described Ishtar \"clothed with love, feathered with seduction, a god dess of joy,\" \"with Anu together occupying the closed-off G igunu, the Chamber of Joy, as the other gods stand in fron t.\" Indeed, another text ( AO .6458) reveals that the very idea of selecting Irninni for the honor of sleeping with Anu was not at all Anu's idea—but that of Ishtar herself. It was throu gh the other gods that she was introduced to Anu, and it w as they who persuaded Anu to agree ...

But a sacred precinct was not a city, and the Sumer ian King Lists record that it was only the son of the f irst priest- king, Enmerkar, \"who built Uruk.\" It was then that Inanna decided that if Uruk was her cult center, it ought to be a full-fledged center of urban civilization. To achie ve that she needed the ME's. The ME's were portable objects which held all the k nowl- edge and other aspects of a high civilization. In t he current state of modern technology, one can envision them a s some kind of computer disks or memory chips which, in sp ite of their minute size, hold vast amounts of information . In a few decades, with more advanced technology, one might c ompare them to some other marvelous store of information ( yet to be invented).

As Inanna worked her char ms on her aging host, Enki made to her a second presen tation; this time he gave her the ME's needed for \"the exal ted scep- ter and staff, the exalted shrine, and righteous Ru lership.\" And \"bright Inanna took them too.\" As the feasting and drinking went on, Enki parted with another seven ME 's that provided for the functions and attributes of a Divi ne Lady— the status of a Great Goddess: a temple and its rit uals, priests and attendants; justice and courts; music and arts; masonry and woodworking; metalworking, leatherwork and weav ing; scribeship and mathematics; and last but not least, weapons and the art of warfare. Holding in her hands all these essentials for a hig h civiliza- tion, Inanna slipped away and took off in her Boat of Heaven back to Uruk.

Whether Enki actually managed to seduce Inanna is n ot clear (an assumption that he did could help resolve the enigma of who the mother of Enki's son Ningishzidda was). It does seem certain that as a result of her experi ences with Anu and Enki, Inanna's femininity was aroused. As A nu's Beloved, she was made the patron-goddess of the cit y of Aratta in the Third Region (the Indus Valley civili zation). One purpose of seeking the ME-tablets for Uruk was to make Uruk a major center so that Inanna could reign wher e it really mattered, not in faraway Aratta. Several texts have been found dealing with the contest of wills between the new king of Uruk, Enmerkar (\"He who built Uruk\") and the kin g of Aratta; the prize was not simply where Inanna would spend her time—but also where she would engage in lovemak ing with the king. In one passage in the text called Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta the latter, sure of being the favorite of Inanna, taunted Enmerkar thus: He will live with Inanna [separated] by a wall; I will live with Inanna in the lapis-lazuli house in Aratta. He will gaze upon Inanna only in a dream; I will lie with her sweetly on an ornate bed. It appears that these liaisons were frowned upon by Inan- na's parents and, even more so, by her brother Utu/ Shamash.

If there had been a hidden agenda to the proposed union, Utu did not belabor it; instead he extolled the merits of having a shepherd as a husband: \"His cream is go od, his milk is bright.\" But Inanna was thinking of a farme r-god as a husband: \"I, the maiden, a farmer will marry,\" sh e an- nounced; \"the farmer grows many plants, the farmer grows much grain.\" In the end, genealogy and the peace dividend prevai led, and Inanna and Dumuzi were engaged. The poetic texts dealing with the courtship, love, and mar- riage of Inanna and Dumuzi—texts of which quite a c ollec- tion has been unearthed—read as the best love songs of all time, explicit yet tender. When, after the parental approval was given on both sides, the marriage was proclaime d, Inanna awaited the consummation of the marriage in the Gip ar in Uruk.

Almost two thousand years after the event the Prophet Ezek iel was abhorred to see the women of Israel sitting and \"we eping for Tammuz\" (the Hebrew rendering of Dumuzi). It took Inanna a long time to get over her grief; a nd in her search for consolation, she turned to the Gipar and its Gigunu chamber as the place where she could forget her lost love. There she perfected the rites of sex to a new form of Divine Encounter. It came to be known as the rite o f the Sacred Marriage.

The river bore me up, it carried me to Akki the irrigator. Ak ki the irrigator lifted me up when he drew water. Akki the irrigator as a son made me and reared me.

The hierodule approached weary, fell asleep. I saw her from the edge of my garden; I kissed her and copulated with her. Inanna, instead of being angry, found Sargon to be a man to her liking. Sumer, its civilization a millennium and a half old by then, needed a strong hand at the helm of it s King- ship—a Kingship that, after the glorious one in Uru k, kept changing capitals; the changes led to conflicts amo ng the cities and eventually between their patron-gods. Se eing in Sargon a man of action and resolve, Inanna recommen ded him as the next king over all of \"Sumer and Akkad.\" He also became her constant lover. As Sargon stated in another text known as the Sargon Chronicle, \"When I was a g ar- dener, Ishtar granted me her love, and for four and fifty years I exercised Kingship.\" It was in the reign of the successors of Sargon as kings of Sumer and Akkad that Inanna/Ishtar incorporated the conjugations with the king into the ceremonies of t he New Year Festival, formalizing them into the rite o f the Sacred Marriage. In earlier times it was the gods who gathered to re live and retell, on the occasion of the New Year, the epic o f Creation and the odyssey of the Anunnaki in coming to and st aying on Earth; the festival was called A.KI.TI—\"On Earth build Life.\" After Kingship was introduced, and after Ina nna began to invite the king to her Gigunu, a reenactment of the death of her sex partner—and then his replacement by the king— was incorporated into the festival's proceedings.

For the first four days of the festival, the gods a lone participated in the reenactments. On the fifth day the king came on the scene, leading the elders and other dig nitaries in a procession through a special Way of Ishtar (in Babylon the processional way assumed monumental proportions and architectural grandeur that inspire awe to this day ; it has been reconstructed in the Vorderasiatisches Museum in Be rlin). Arriving at the main temple, the king was met by th e High Priest, who took away the king's insignia and place d them before the deity in the Holy of Holies. Then, retur ning to the dethroned king, the High Priest struck him in the f ace and made him kneel down for a ceremony of Atonement in which the king had to recite a list of sins and seek divi ne forgive- ness. Priests then led the king out of town to a pi t of symbolic death; the king stayed there imprisoned while above the gods debated his Destiny. On the ninth day he reemerged, was given back his insignia and royal robes, and led ba ck the procession to the city. There, at evetime, washed a nd scented, he was led to the Gipar in the sacred precinct. At the entrance to the Gigunu he was met by Inanna' s personal attendant, who made the following appeal t o the goddess in behalf of the king: The sun has gone to sleep, the day has passed.

The Sacred Marriage had taken p lace; the king could reign on for another year; the land and people were granted prosperity. \"The Sacred Marriage Rite was celebrated joyously a nd rapturously all over the ancient Near East for some two thou- sand years,\" the great Sumerologist Samuel N. Krame r wrote in The Sacred Marriage Rite. Indeed, long after the days of Dumuzi and Gilgamesh, Sumerian kings described poet ically the ecstasy of such memorable nights with Ishtar. T he biblical Song of Songs described the pleasures of love in th e Ta'an- nugim and several of the Prophets foresaw the demis e of the \"House of Annugim\" (House of Pleasures) of the \"Dau ghter of Babylon\" (Ishtar); and it is apparent to us that the Hebrew term stemmed from the Sumerian Gigunu, indicating f amiliar- ity with the Chamber of Pleasures and the rite of t he Sacred Marriage well into the middle of the first millenni um B . C . In the olden days the Gipar was the separate struct ure to which the god and his official spouse retired for t he night. The gods who stayed monogamous—Enlil, Ninurta—have kept it that way. Ishtar, in her city Uruk, met her betrothed Dumuzi there but turned the inner chamber, the Gigu nu, to a place of one-night stands. The changes introduced by Ish- tar—the use of the Gipar for a new form of Divine E ncoun- ter—gave ideas to some of the male deities of that time. Some of the best-preserved records in this regard c oncern Nannar/Sin (the father of Inanna/Ishtar) and the Gi par in his sacred precinct in Ur. The role played by the male king in Ishtar's rites was played by an Entu, a \"God's Lady ,\" (NIN.- DINGIR in Sumerian). Excavations there unearthed th e quar- ters of the Entu in the southeastern part of the sa cred precinct, not too far from the ziggurat of Sin and clearly aw ay from the temple-abode of his spouse Ningal. Near the Gig unu of the Entu the archaeologists found a cemetery where genera- tions of Entus were buried. The cemetery, and the u ncovered structures, confirmed that the practice of having a \"God's Lady\" besides the official spouse extended from the early Dynastic Period well into Neo-Babylonian times—a sp an of time exceeding two millennia."},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"Encounters in the GIGUNU 177 Herodotus, the fifth century B.C. Greek historian a nd trav- eler, described in his writings (History, Book I, 1 78-182) the sacred precinct of Babylon and the temple-ziggurat of Mar- duk (whom he called \"Jupiter Bellus\")—quite accurat ely, as modern archaeology has shown. According to his test imony, On the topmost tower there is a spacious temple, an d inside the temple stands a couch of unusual size, r ichly adorned, with a golden table by its side. There is no statue of any kind set up in the place, nor is the cham- ber occupied of nights by any one but a single nati ve woman, who, as the Chaldeans, the priests of this g od affirm, is chosen for himself by the deity out of a ll the women of the land. They also declare—but I for my part do not credit i t— that the god comes down in person into this chamber , and sleeps upon the couch. This is like the story t old by the Egyptians of what takes place in their city of Thebes, where a woman always passes the night in th e temple of the Theban Jupiter. In each case the woma n is said to be debarred all intercourse with men. It is also like the custom of Patara, in Lycia, where the priestess who delivers the oracles, during the time that she is so employed ... is shut up in the temple eve ry night. Although the statements by Herodotus give the impre ssion that any maiden in the lands could have qualified f or this widespread practice, it was not really so. One of the inscriptions found in the ruins of the G ipar at Ur was by an Entu named Enannedu, who has been iden tified as the daughter of Kudur-Mabuk, a king of the Sumer ian city Larsa circa 1900 B.C. \"I am magnificently suited to be a Gipar-woman, the house which in a pure place for th e Entu is built,\" she wrote. Interestingly, votive objects found in the Ningal temple bore inscriptions identifying them as gifts from Enannedu, suggesting to some scholars (e.g. Penelop e Wea- dock, The Giparu at Ur) that while serving as the h uman consort of the god Nannar, the Entu also had to be on good"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"178 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS terms with the official spouse, \"providing for the comfort and adornment of the goddess Ningal.\" Other instances where kings sought the Entu office for their daughters abound. The reason that emerges fro m the inscriptions is that by having such intimate access to the god, the Entu could plead the case and cause of the king for \"long days of life and good health\"—the very requests mad e by the male king on the occasion of the Sacred Marriag e with Ishtar. With such a direct access to the city god t hrough the \"God's Lady,\" no wonder that successive kings all o ver the ancient Near East built and rebuilt the Gipars in t heir cities, making sure that their daughters, and no one else, would be the Entu. This high and unique office was totally d ifferent from that of a variety of priestesses who served in the temples as \"holy prostitutes,\" referred to by the general t erm Qad- ishtu—an occupation frequently mentioned derogative ly in the Bible (and specifically prohibited for the Daug hters of Israel: Deuteronomy 23:18). The Entu was different from the concubines that gods (and kings, or Patriarchs) had , in that the Entu did not and apparently could not (through unknown procedures) bear children, while the concubines cou ld and did. These rules and customs meant that kings seeking or claim- ing divine parentage had to find other ways than de scent from an Entu (who could not bear children) or a concubin e (whose offspring lost out to those of the official spouse) . It is thus no wonder that during the last glorious era of Sume r, the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur, some of its kings, emulating Gilgamesh, claimed that they were mothered by the g oddess Ninsun. The Assyrian king Sennacherib, unable to ma ke such a claim, asserted instead in one of his inscription s that \"the Mistress of the gods, the goddess of procreation, l ooked upon me with favor (while I was still) in the womb of th e mother who bore me and watched over my conception; Ea prov ided a spacious womb, and granted me keen understanding, the equal of the master Adapa.\" In other instances Meso potamian kings asserted that this or that goddess raised the m or breast- fed them.

But as the view er and the hero are certain that all had faded into its no nreality, the hero finds the object in his pocket or on his finge r—a reality left over from the unreality. And thus, Rod Serling has shown us, between reality and nonreality, between the rat ional and the irrational, we were passing through a Twilight Zone. Four thousand years earlier, a Sumerian king found himself in such a Twilight Zone, and recorded his experienc e on two clay cylinders (that are now on display in the Louv re Museum in Paris). The king's name was Gudea and he reigned in the Sum er- ian city Lagash circa 2100 B . C . Lagash was the \"cult center\" of Ninurta, the Foremost Son of Enlil, and he dwelt with his spouse Bau in the city's sacred precinct called the Girsu— hence his local epithet NIN.GIRSU, \"Lord of the Gir su.\" At about that time, owing to an intensification of the struggle for supremacy on Earth that pitted primarily Enki's Firstborn Marduk against Enid's clan, Ninurta/Ningirsu obtain ed the permission of his father Enlil to build a new templ e in the Girsu—a temple so magnificent that it would express the rights of Ninurta to the supremacy. As it turned ou t, Ninurta's plan was to build in Mesopotamia a most unusual tem ple, one that would emulate the Great Pyramid of Giza on the one hand and that, upon its vast platform, would ho ld stone circles that could serve as sophisticated astronomi cal observa- tories. The need to find a reliable and faithful wo rshiper to carry out the grandiose plans and to follow intelli gently the designs of the Divine Architects served as the back ground for the ensuing events recorded by Gudea. The series of events began with a dream that Gudea had one night; it was a vision of Divine Encounters. An d it was so vivid that it transported the king into a Twilig ht Zone; for when Gudea awoke, an object that he had seen only i n his dream was now physically on his lap. Somehow, the b ound- ary between unreality and reality had been crossed.

As the \"woman\" was consulting the star tablet, a th ird divine being appeared (we follow column V, verses 2 -10, Fig. 59b); he was a male: A second man appeared, he had the look of a hero, endowed with strength.

Repeating the details of the dream-vision one by on e in the manner reported by Gudea, the oracle goddess pr oceeded to tell the king what it meant. The first god to ap pear, she said, was Ninurta/Ningirsu, announcing to Gudea tha t he was chosen to build the new temple: \"For thee to build his temple he commanded.\" Its name was to be E.NINNU—\"House of Fifty\"—to signify that Ninurta has the claim to Eni d's rank of fifty and thus the only one below Anu, whose ran k was sixty. The sighting of the heliacal rising of Jupiter \"is the god Ningishzidda,\" meant to show the king the exact poi nt in the skies to which the temple's observatories should be oriented, indicating precisely where the Sun will rise on the day of the New Year. The female who appeared in the vision, ca rrying on her head the image of a temple-structure, was th e goddess Nisaba; with her stylus that she grasped in one han d and the celestial map that she held in the other hand, \"to build the temple in accordance with the Holy Planet she instr ucted thee.\" And the second male, Nanshe explained, was t he god Nindub; \"to thee the plan of the temple he gave.\" She also explained to Gudea the meaning of the othe r objects that he had seen. The carrying basket signi fied Gu- dea's role in the construction; the mold and \"desti ny brick\" indicated the size and shape of the bricks to be us ed, molded of clay; the Tibu bird that \"brilliantly shines day and night\" meant that, throughout the construction, \"no good s leep shall come to thee.\" If that did not mar Gudea's joy at b eing selected for the sacred task, the interpretation of the freight- Ass symbolism should have: it meant that, like a be ast of burden, Gudea shall toil in the temple's building . . . Back in Lagash Gudea contemplated the words of the ora- cle goddess and studied the divine tablet that had materialized on his lap. The more he thought about the varied in structions, the more he was baffled, especially so regarding th e astro- nomical orientation and timing.

In wha t scholars call Gudea's second dream, the position of the king and the encountered deity seem to be crucial. The t ext (col- umn IX, verses 5-6) states that \"for the second tim e, by the prostrate one, by the prostrate one, the god took h is stand.\" The Sumerian term used, NAD.A, conveys more than th e \"lying flat, lying stretched out\" that the English term \"pros- trate\" conveys. It implies an element of not-seeing by lying facedown. Gudea, in other words, had to lie down in a man- ner assuring that he would not see the deity. The g od, on his part, had to position himself at the head of Gudea. If Gudea was asleep, or in a trance, did the god actually sp eak to him—or was the position near the king's head intend ed to facilitate some other, metaphysical method of commu nica- tion? The text does not make this point clear; it d oes relate that Gudea was given promises of constant divine he lp, espe- cially by the god Ningishzidda. The help of this de ity, whom we have identified as the Egyptian deity Thoth, see med espe- cially important to Ninurta/Ningirsu, as was the ex pected homage that Magan (Egypt) and Meluhha (Nubia) would pay to Ninurta once his new temple would proclaim his r ank of Fifty, \"the fifty names of Lordship that by Anu wer e or- dained.\" This, he explained to Gudea, was why the t emple was to be called E.NINNU—\"House of Fifty.\" He promi sed Gudea that the new temple will not only glorify the deity; it will also bring fame and prosperity to all of Sumer and to Lagash in particular. The deity then explained to Gudea various details o f the temple's architecture, including the design of the special en- closures for the Divine Black Bird and the Supreme Weapon; the Gigunu for the divine couple; an oracle chamber , and a place for the assembly of the gods. Details of uten sils and furnishings were also given.

He amas sed building materials from near and far and organized a labor force. As Nanshe had foreseen, he toiled like a Fre ight-Ass and \"good sleep did not come to him.\" With everything ready, it was time to start making the bricks. They had to be made from clay according to the mold and sample that appeared to Gudea in his first visi on-dream. We read in column XIX, verse 19, that Gudea \"brough t the brick, placed it in the temple.\" It follows from th is statement that Gudea had the brick (and by inference the requ ired mold) in his physical possession; the brick and mold were thus two more objects (in addition to the lapis lazuli table t) that crossed the boundary in a Twilight Zone. Now Gudea contemplated \"the sketched ground plan of the temple.\" But \"unlike the goddess Nisaba who alw ays understands the meaning of dimensions,\" Gudea was s ty- mied. Again he needed additional divine guidance; a nd again he resorted to the method that had worked before—bu t only after obtaining, through divination, a \"go-ahead.\" The method he used for divination involved the \"passing of quiet waters over seeds\" and determining the course of ac tion by"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Visions from the Twilight Zone 193 the appearance of the wet seeds. \"Gudea exa mined the omens, and his omens were favorable.\" So Gudea laid down his head, prostrated himself. The command-vision emerged: \"The building of thy Lord's House, the Eninnu, thou shall complete— from its foundation below to its top that rises skyward.'' Though scholars consider this episode \"Gudea's thir d dream,\" the text's terminology is significantly dif ferent. Even on the previous occasions the term translated \"drea m,\" MA- MUZU, is more akin to the Hebrew/Semitic Mahazeh wh ich better translates as \"a vision.\" Here, on the third time, the term employed is DUG MUNATAE—a \"command-vision that emerges.\" On this time around, in this \"comman d-vi- sion\" by request, Gudea was shown how to start the building of his Lord's temple. In front of his very eyes the process of the completion of the Eninnu, \"from its foundation below to its top that rises skyward,\" was taking shape. The vision of a simulated demonstration of the whole process, fro m the bottom up, \"engaged his attention.\" What was to be done finally became clear; and \"with joy he took up the task.\" How the work then proceeded, how Gudea was helped b y a team of Divine Architects and gods and goddesses of as- tronomy to orient the temple and erect its observat ories, how and when calendrical requirements were met, and the ceremo- nies that inaugurated the new temple, are all told in the bal- ance of Cylinder \"A\" and in Cylinder \"B\" of the Sum erian king.

The ancient records include additional instances th at belong in the Twilight Zone, where objects—or actions—that are part of the dream-vision dimension appear in the en suing awakened reality. Though they lack the clear-cut pi ctorial evidence available in the case of the tablet with t he temple's plan, the other reports suggest that the phenomenon , though rare, was not unique to Gudea. Even there, though G udea himself does not hold them up for posterity to see, we know from the text that at least two additional objects— me mold and the Brick of Destiny—also materialized into the ratio- nal dimension. Physical objects and actions that transcend the bou ndary are also encountered in the dreams of Gilgamesh.

And finally there was the dream-vision of the launched rock- etship—a \"dream\" in which Gilgamesh sees an object the likes of which he had never seen before, a launchin g the likes of which no one in Uruk had seen (for it was neithe r a Spaceport nor a Landing Place). He did not end up h olding the object in his hand once the vision had dissipat ed; but we could still see it depicted in the Byblos coin (Fig . 49). The dream-visions of Daniel, a Jewish captive in th e court of Nebuchadnezzar (king of Babylon in the sixth cen tury B.C.), contain even more direct parallels to the ph ysical as- pects of the Twilight Zone encounters of Gilgamesh and Gudea. Describing one of his Divine Encounters at t he banks of the Tigris River (the Book of Daniel, chapter 10 ), he wrote: I lifted up mine eyes, and behold, I saw a sole man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with Ophir gold. His body gleamed like topaz, his face shone like lightning, his eyes flamed like torches, his arms and feet were the color of bronze, and his voice was a booming one. \"I alone could see the apparition,\" Daniel wrote; b ut though the other people who were with him could not see it, they felt an awesome presence and ran away to hide. He, too, felt suddenly immobilized, able to only hear t he divine voice; but As soon as I heard the voice of his words I fell asleep face down, my face touching the ground.

The divine person then revealed to Daniel that he w as to be shown the future. Overwhelmed, with his face sti ll down, Daniel was speechless. But then the person—\"of the appear- ance of the sons of Man\"—touched the lips of Daniel , and Daniel was able to speak. When he apologized for hi s weak- ness, the divine person touched him again, and Dani el \"re- gained his strength.\" All that had taken place whil e Daniel was seized by a trancelike sleep. More memorable than the dream-visions of Daniel is the Twilight Zone incident of the Handwriting-on-the-Wa ll. It took place in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar's success or as regent in Babylon, Bel-shar-utzur (\"Lord, the Princ e pre- serve\") whom the bible calls Belshazzar, circa 540 B.C. As related in chapter 5 of the Book of Daniel, Belshaz zar made a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and wa s feasting and drinking wine—a scene known from several Babylo nian and Assyrian depictions of royal banquets (Fig. 62) . Drunk with too much wine, he gave orders to fetch the gol d and silver vessels that Nebuchadnezzar had seized from the Tem- ple in Jerusalem, so that \"he and his nobles, his c oncubines and his courtesans might drink from them.

The sight of a human hand—disembodied, floating by itself unconnected to an arm and a body—was disconcerting; the suddenness of the appearance only added to the sens e of foreboding. \"The king's mind was filled with terror , his countenance turned pale, every limb of his became l imp, his knees knocked together.\" He must have realized that the desecration of the vessels from the Temple of Yahwe h had triggered an ominous Divine Encounter with some unk nown dire consequences. He shouted for the seers and diviners of Babylon to be rushed in. Addressing the \"wise men of Babylon\" he an- nounced that whoever could read the writing and int erpret the meaning of the apparition shall be rewarded and elevated to the third highest rank in the kingdom. But none could interpret the vision nor understand the written mes sage. And \"Belshazzar sat pale and utterly scared and his nob les all perplexed.\" Upon this scene of fear and desperation in walked t he queen; and when she heard what had happened, she po inted out that the wise man Daniel had been known for his ability to understand and interpret dreams and divine messa ges.

By then the writing hand must have vanished , but the writing on the wall remained. Confirming that the b ad omen was the result of the desecration of the Temple's v essels that were consecrated to the God Most High, the Lord of Heaven, Daniel explained the writing and its meaning: This is why by Him the hand was sent, and why this writing was inscribed. These are the words of the writing: Mene, mene, tekel u Pharsin. And here is the words' interpretation: Mene: God hath numbered the days of thy kingdom, and it is finished. Tekel: Thou are weighed in the balance, and found wanting. U Pharsin: Thy kingdom shall be divided, to the Medes and Persians it shall be given. Belshazzar kept his promise, and ordered that Danie l be robed in purple and honored with a chain of gold ar ound his neck, and proclaimed third in rank in the kingdom. But \"that very night, Belshazzar king of the Chaldeans was sl ain, and Darius of the Medes took the kingdom\" (Daniel 5:30- 31). The message from the Twilight Zone was promptly ful filled.

After making Jerusalem his capital, it was the hope and ambition of King David to build there the sacred Temple in whose Holy of Holies the Ark of the Coven ant could finally come to rest at a spot held sacred fr om time immemorial. But divine communications—principally t hrough dreams—had willed otherwise. As the biblical record tells it, David shared his i ntention to build the temple with the Prophet Nathan, who ga ve it his blessing. But \"it came to pass that very night, tha t the word of Yahweh came to Nathan, instructing him to tell K ing David that because he had been involved in wars and the shedding of blood, it would be his son, rather than David himself, who would build the temple.\" How the Prophet Nathan had received the divine comm uni- cation \"that very night\" is explained at the end of the tale (II Samuel 7:17): \"And Nathan related to David all these words, the whole of this vision.\" It was thus not j ust a dream, but an epiphany; not a Chalom (\"dream\") but a Hizza yon (\"envisioning\"), in which not only were the words h eard but the speaker was also \"envisioned,\" as had been expl ained by Yahweh to the brother and sister of Moses in the Sinai encampment. So King David went \"and sat before Yahweh,\" in fron t of the Ark of the Covenant. He accepted the Lord's decision, but wished to make sure of both its parts—that he w ould not build the Temple, and that his son will. Thus sitti ng before the Ark of the Covenant by means of which Moses had com- municated with the Lord, David repeated the Prophet 's words. The Bible does not report the Lord's answer; but in that \"sitting before Yahweh\" may lie a key to understand ing a puzzle—the mystery of the origin of the Temple's pl ans. For we read in I Chronicles chapter 28 that as David ne ared the end of his days he called together the leaders and elders of Israel and told them of Yahweh's decision regarding the building of the Temple.

It was a physical model that apparently was small enough to be handed over by David to Solomon— something that nowadays would be spoken of as a \"sc ale model.\" As archaeological finds in Mesopotamia and Egypt at test, scale models were not unknown in the ancient Near E ast; we can illustrate the fact by showing some of the obje cts discov- ered in Mesopotamia (Fig. 63a), as well as some of the nu- merous Egyptian ones (Fig. 63b).

After listing a variety of materials neede d for the construction—to be obtained from the Israelites as voluntary contributions, not as imposed taxation as Gudea had done— Yahweh showed Moses a Tavnit of the Residence and a Tav- nit of the instruments thereof, saying (Exodus 25:8 -9): And they shall make me a sanctuary, and I will reside in the midst of them.

The term retains some am biguity as to the nature of the \"vision\"—the actual seeing of a scene, or an induced mental image that is created, somehow , in the mind's eye only.

He calls what he sees an \"apparition,\" the being th at he sees is only a likeness of a man.

And the spirit carried me between the earth and the heaven, and brought me to Jerusalem— in Elohim visions— to the door of the inner gate that faces north.

Within that long record of dreams and visions, some, as we have seen , stand out by crossing into the Twilight Zone, where the u nreal becomes real, a metaphysical object assumes a physi cal exis- tence, an unspoken word becomes a voice actually he ard. The Bible is replete with records of dreams as a ma jor form of Divine Encounter, as channels for conveying the deity's decision or advice, benevolent promise or s trict ver- dict. Indeed, in Numbers 12:6, Yahweh is quoted as explicitly 212"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 213 stating (to the brother and sister of Moses) that \" if there be a prophet among you\"—a person chosen to convey God' s word—\"I the Lord will make myself known to him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream.\" The sig nificance of the statement is enhanced by the precision of th e wording: In a vision Yahweh makes himself known, recognizabl e, visi- ble; in a dream he makes himself heard, granting or acles. Informative in this regard is the tale in I Samuel chapter 28. Saul, the Israelite king, faced a crucial battl e with the Philistines. The Prophet Samuel, who on Yahweh's co mmand had anointed Saul king and had provided him with th e Lord's word, has died. The apprehensive Saul is trying to obtain divine guidance on his own; but although he had \"in quired of Yahweh\" \"both by dreams and by omens and by prophet s,\" Yahweh did not respond. In this instance, dreams ar e listed as the first or foremost method of divine communica tion; omens—celestial signs or unusual terrestrial occurr ences— and oracles, divine words through prophets, follow. The manner in which Samuel himself had been chosen to become a Prophet of Yahweh also hinges on the use o f dream for divine communication. It was a sequence of thre e \"the- ophany dreams\" in which scholars, such as Robert K. Gnuse (The Dream Theophany of Samuel), find remarkable pa rallels to the three dreams-cum-awakenings of Gilgamesh. We have already mentioned how Samuel's mother, unab le to bear children, promised to dedicate the child to Yahweh if she be blessed with a son. Keeping her vow, the mother brought the boy to Shiloh, where the Ark of the Cov enant was kept in a temporary shrine under the supervisio n of Eli the Priest. But since Eli's sons were lewd and prom iscuous, Yahweh decided to choose the pious Samuel as succes sor to Eli. It was a time, we read in I Samuel 3:1, when \" the word of Yahweh was seldom heard and a vision was not fre quent.\" And it came to pass on that day that Eli was lying in his usual place, and his eyes began to wax dim and he could not see. The lamp of Elohim did not yet go out; and Samuel was lying in the sanctuary"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":" Figure 70 of Yahweh, where the Ark of Elohim was. And Yahweh called out to Samuel; and Samuel answered \"Here I am,\" and ran to Eli, saying: \"Here I am, for thou hast called me.'' But Eli said no, he had not called Samuel, and told the boy to go back to sleep. Once again Yahweh called S amuel, and once again Samuel went to Eli only to be told t hat the priest did not call him. But when that happened the third time, \"Eli understood that it was Yahweh calling th e boy.\" So he instructed him to answer, if it ever happens again, \"Speak O Yahweh, for thy servant listens.\" And ther eafter \"Yahweh came, and stood upright, and called 'Samuel , Sam- uel' from time to time; and each time Samuel answer ed 'speak, for thy servant listens'.\" An artist in thi rteenth cen- tury A . D . France did his best to depict the first dream theop h- any and the final Divine Encounter of Samuel with Y ahweh in a medieval illustrated Bible (Fig. 70). It will be recalled that the Divine Spirit that pro vided King David with the Tavnit and written instructions for the Jerusa- lem Temple came upon him as he sat himself before t he Ark of the Covenant. The call upon Samuel also occurred as \"he was lying in the sanctuary of Yahweh, where the Ark of 214 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 215 Figure 71 Elohim was.\" The Ark, made of acacia wood and inlai d with gold inside and out, was intended to safekeep the t wo Tablets of the Law. But its main purpose, as stated in the Book of Exodus, was to serve as a Dvir—literally, a \"Speake r.\" The Ark was to be topped by the two Cherubim made of so lid gold, with their wings touching (the two possibilit ies of this detail are illustrated in Fig. 71). \"It is there th at I shall keep appointments with you,\" Yahweh told Moses, \"and 1 w ill speak to you from above the cover, from between the two Cherubim which shall be upon the Ark\" (Exodus 25:22 ). The innermost part of the sanctuary, the Holy of Holies , was separated from the forepart by a veil that could no t be parted except by Moses and then by his brother Aaron, who was appointed by Yahweh to serve as High Priest, and th e three sons of Aaron, who were anointed as priests. And th ey were to enter the sacred place only after performing cer tain rites and wearing special clothing. Furthermore, when the se conse- crated priests would enter the Holy of Holies, they had to bum incense (whose composition was also strictly pr escribed"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"216 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS by the Lord) so that a cloud would engulf the Ark; for, Yahweh told Moses, \"it is in the cloud that 1 shall appear, above the Ark's cover.\" But when two of Aaron's son s \"brought near before the Lord a strange fire,\" one that (pre- sumably) failed to create the proper cloud, \"a fire went out from before Yahweh and consumed them.\" Such \"supernatural\" forces, bringing to pass the dr eam- oracle of Samuel and the dream-vision of David, con tinued to permeate the Tabernacle even after the Ark itsel f was moved out, as evidenced by the dream-oracle of Solo mon. Ready to commence the building of the Temple, he we nt to Gibeon, the latest resting place of the Tent of App ointment (the part of the Residence where the Holy of Holies was). The Ark itself had already been moved to Jerusalem by D avid, in anticipation of placing it in its permanent locatio n within the future Temple; but the Tent of Appointment remained in Gib- eon, and Solomon went there—perhaps just to worship , per- haps to see for himself some details of the constru ction. He offered sacrifices to Yahweh and went to sleep; and then— And it was in Gibeon that Yahweh appeared unto Solomon in a nighttime dream. And Elohim said: \"Ask what I shall give thee.'' The epiphany developed into a two-way conversation in which Solomon asked to be granted \"an understanding heart to judge my people, that I may discern between good and bad.\" Yahweh liked the answer, for Solomon had aske d nei- ther for riches nor for long life, nor for the deat h of his enemies. Therefore, said Yahweh, he would grant him ex- traordinary Wisdom and Understanding, as well as ri ches and long life. And Solomon awoke, and lo—it was a dream!

In a verse that indicates familiarity with the Mesopot amia and Egyptian civilizations at that time, the Bible adde d that \"the wisdom of Solomon was greater than the wisdom of al l the Sons of the East and of all of the wisdom of Egypt. \" Whereas in the Sinai it was Yahweh who selected and instructed two artisans to carry out the intricate and artful architectural details, \"filling up with the Spirit of Elohim, with wisdom and understanding and knowledge\" Bezale l of the tribe of Judah and \"putting wide wisdom in the heart\" of Aholiab of the tribe of Dan, Solomon relied on t he artisans of the Phoenician king of Tyre for the required exp erts. And when the Temple was completed, Solomon prayed to th e Lord Yahweh that He accept the House as an eternal abode and as a place from which the prayers of Israel wou ld be heard. It was then that Solomon had his second drea m epiph- any: \"Yahweh appeared unto Solomon for the second t ime, in the manner seen to him in Gibeon.\" Although the Temple in Jerusalem was literally call ed a \"house\" for the Lord, echoing the Sumerian term \"E\" for the temple-house, it is evident from the prayer of Solomon that he did not share the Mesopotamian view of temp les as actual divine dwelling places, but rather as a sacr ed place for divine communication, a place where Man and God can hear each other, a permanent substitute for the desert T ent of Ap- pointment for the Divine Presence. No sooner had the priests brought the Ark of the Co venant into its place in the Holy of Holies, \"the Dvir sec tion of the Temple\" and put it \"under the wings of the Cherubim ,\" than they had to leave hurriedly \"on account of the cloud of Yahweh's Glory that filled the House.\" It was then that Solo- mon began his prayer, addressing \"Yahweh, who would dwell in the dark cloud.\" \"The heavens are thy dwel ling place,\" Solomon said; \"would Elohim then come to dw ell on Earth? If the heaven and the highest heaven cann ot contain thee, would this House that I have built?\" Realizin g that,"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"218 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Solomon asked only for the Lord to hear the prayers that emanate from the temple; \"hear in your dwelling pla ce, in the heavens, the prayers and supplications, and jud ge the peo- ple accordingly.\" It was then \"that Yahweh appeared unto Solomon for a second time, in the manner that he was seen to him in Gib- eon. And Yahweh said to him: I have heard thy praye r and thy supplications that thou hast made before me, an d have sanctified this House that thou hast built, to plac e my Shem in it forever, so that my eyes and my heart shall b e there in perpetuity.\" The term Shem is traditionally translated \"name,\" t hat by which someone is known or remembered. But as we hav e shown in The 12th Planet, quoting biblical, Mesopot amian, and Egyptian sources, the term paralleled the Sumer ian MU that, though in time it came to mean \"that by which one is remembered,\" originally referred to the Skychambers or fly- ing machines of the Mesopotamian gods. Thus, when t he people of Babylon (Bab-Ili, \"Gateway of the Gods\") set out to build the tower so as to make a Shem for themsel ves, they were building a launch tower not for a \"name\" but for skyborne vehicles. In Mesopotamia, it was upon the temple platforms th at special enclosures—some depicted as designed to wit hstand heavy impacts—were built specifically to serve the coming and going of these skychambers. Gudea had to provid e in the sacred precinct such a special enclosure for the Di vine Black Bird of Ninurta, and when the construction was done ex- pressed the hope that the new temple's \"MU shall hu g the lands from horizon to horizon.\" A hymn to Adad/lshk ur ex- tolled his \"ray-emitting MU that can attain the hea ven's ze- nith,\" and a hymn to Inanna/lshtar described how, a fter putting on the pilot's garb (see Fig. 33), \"over al l the peopled lands she flies in her MU.\" In all these instances the usual translation is \"name\" for MU, reading for Adad a \"n ame\" that hugs the lands and attains the highest heavens , for In- anna/lshtar that \"over all the peopled lands she fl ies in her name.\" In fact, however, the reference was to the g ods' flying machines and their landing pads within the sacred p recincts.

The language employed in the Bible to describe the unex- pected realization by Solomon, suddenly awakened, t hat the experienced sight and sound were just a dream, dupl icated an earlier instance of such a sudden realization—th at of a Pharaoh: And Pharaoh awoke, and lo—it was a dream! It was the dream series, described in chapter 41 of Genesis, that began with the Pharaoh's dream of seven cows—s ome translations prefer the more archaic-sounding \"kine \"—\"of good appearance and fat-fleshed,\" that came up out of the Nile River to pasture. They were followed by seven \"ill- favored and lean of flesh\" cows; and the latter ate up the former. In a following dream the Pharaoh saw seven ears of corn, \"rank and good,\" grow on one stalk, followed by seven thin and wind-withered ears of corn; and the latter swallowed the former. \"And the Pharaoh awakened, and lo—it wa s a dream.\" The envisioned double scene was so real tha t the awakened Pharaoh was astonished to realize that it was just a dream. Troubled by the reality of the dream, he s ummoned the sages and magicians of Egypt to tell him the me aning of the dream; but none could offer an interpretation. Thus began the rise to prominence in Egypt of the H ebrew youth Joseph, who, wrongfully imprisoned, interpret ed cor- rectly the dreams that two of the Pharaoh's ministe rs, also in prison, had. Now one of them, the Chief Wine Stewar d who was reinstated to his position, told that to the Ph araoh and suggested that Joseph be summoned to help solve the Pha- raoh's two dreams. And Joseph said to the Pharaoh: The two dreams are but one single dream; \"that which the El ohim will be doing to the Pharaoh has been told.\" It was , in other words, an omen-dream, a divine revelation of what w ill hap- pen in the future by God's design.

Although the Bible does not identify the Pharaoh of Jo- seph's time by name, other biblical data and chrono logies have enabled us to identify him as Amenemhet III of the Twelfth Dynasty, who reigned over Egypt from 1850 t o 1800 B.C.

Expecting an epiphany, he had one: And as I slept, with life and satisfaction, 1 discovered the god standing over against me!

Concerning me, with friendly face, these words he declared: \"I am Khnum, thy fashioner.'' The god announced that he would heed the king's pra yers if the king would undertake to \"rebuild temples, to restore what is ruined, and to hew out new shrines\" for the deity. For that, the god said, he will be giving the king new stones as well as \"hard stones which have existed from the begin- ning of time.\" Then the god promised that in exchange he would ope n the sluices in two caverns that are beneath his roc k chamber and that as a result the waters of the Nile will be gin to flow again. Within a year, he said, the river's banks wi ll be green again, plants will grow, starvation will disappear. And when the god finished speaking, and his image vanished, Zoser \"awoke refreshed, my heart relieved of weariness,\" and de- creed permanent rites of offerings to Khnum in eter nal gratitude. The god Ptah and a vision of him is the central the me of two other Egyptian dream epiphanies; one of them br ings to mind the biblical tales of the woman who cannot bea r a male heir. The first, describing how a Divine Encounter turned the tide of warfare, is contained in a long inscription by the Pharaoh Merenptah (circa 1230 B . C .) on the fourth pylon in the great temple in Karnak. Though the son of the w arring Pharaoh Ramses II, Merenptah found it beyond his ca pabili- ties to protect Egypt from a rising tide of invader s, both by land (Libyans from the west) and by sea (\"pirates\" from across the Mediterranean). The warfare reached its culmina- tion when Libyan forces reinforced by the \"pirates\" were poised to seize Memphis, the olden capital of Egypt . Merenp- tah, desponded, was ill prepared to face the attack ers. Then, in the night before the decisive battle, he had a d ream. In the dream the god Ptah appeared; promising the king victory, the god said: \"Take this now!\" and with those words handed to Merenptah a sword, saying further: \"and banish f rom yourself your troubled heart.\""},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"226 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS The hieroglyphic text is partly damaged at mis poin t, mak- ing it unclear what happened next; but the inferenc e is that as Merenptah awoke, he found the divine sword physi cally in his hand. Reassured by the god's words and the d ivine sword, Merenptah led his troops to battle; it resul ted in a complete victory for the Egyptians. In the other instance wherein Ptah appears, it was in a dream by a princess (Taimhotep) who was the wife of the High Priest. She bore three daughters but no male h eir, wherefor she \"prayed to the majesty of this august god, great of wonders and able to give a son to one who has no ne.\" One night, as the High Priest was asleep, Ptah \"cam e to him in a revelation\" and said to the High Priest that i n exchange for carrying out certain construction works, \"I sha ll make you in return for it a male child.\" On this the high priest awoke and kissed the ground of this august god. He commissioned the prophets, the chiefs of mysteries, the priests, and the sculptors of the House of Gold, to carry out at once the beneficent work. The construction work was carried out in accordance with the wishes of Ptah; and after that, the princess st ates in the inscription, she became pregnant and did bear a mal e child. Though not in its details but in its essential them e, the Egyptian tale (from Ptolmeic times) bears a resembl ance to the much earlier biblical record of the appearance of the Lord, accompanied by two other divine beings, to Abraham and predicting that his aging and childless wife Sarah will bear a male heir. Among other instances of royal oracle dreams found in Egyptian records, the most famous is that by the pr ince who later ascended the throne to be crowned as Thothmes IV. His dream is well-known because he describes it on a st ela that he had erected between the paws of the great Sphinx in Giza—where it still stands for all to see. As recorded on the stela (Fig. 77), the prince \"use d to occupy himself with sport on the desert highland of Mem-"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 227 phis.\" One day he lay to rest near the necropolis o f Gizah, next to \"the divine way of the gods to the horizon ... the holy place of primeval times.\" That, the inscriptio n says, was where \"the very great statue of the Sphinx rests, g reat of fame, majestic of awe.\" It was noontime, the sun wa s strong; so the prince chose to lie down in the shadow of th e Sphinx, and he fell asleep. As he was sleeping, he heard the Sphinx speak \"with his own mouth, saying:\" Look at me, my son, Thothmose ... Behold, my state is that of one in need, my whole body is going to pieces. The sands of the desert above which I had stood have encroached upon me . . . What the Sphinx was saying to the sleeping prince w as a request that the desert sands that had engulfed the Sphinx and covered most of it—a situation not unlike that found by Napoleon's men in the nineteenth century (Fig. 78)— be re- moved so that the Sphinx could be seen in its full majesty. Figure 77"},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"228 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS In exchange, the Sphinx—representing the god Harmak his— promised him that he would be the successor on Egyp t's throne. \"When the Sphinx finished these words,\" the inscrip- tion continues, \"the king's son awoke.\" Though it w as a dream, its contents and meaning were crystal clear to the prince. \"He understood the speech of this god.\" At first opportunity he carried out the divine request, to c lear the Sphinx of the sands that buried it almost completel y; and indeed, in 1421 B.C., the prince ascended Egypt's t hrone to become Thothmes IV. Such a divine nomination to Kingship was not unique in Egyptian annals. In fact, it has been recorded in c onnection with a predecessor, Thothmes III. The tale of mirac ulous happenings and a vision of the \"Glory of the Lord\" has been inscribed by this king on the temple walls in Karna k. In this case the god did not speak out; rather, he indicate d his choice of a future monarch through the \"working of miracle s.\" As Thothmes himself related it, when he was still a youth training as a priest, he was standing in the colonn aded part of the temple. Suddenly, the god Amon-Ra appeared i n his glory from the horizon. \"He made heaven and Earth f estive with his beauty; then he began to perform a great m arvel: he Figure 78"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 229 directed his rays into the eyes of Horus-of-the-Hor izon\" (the Sphinx). The king offered the arriving god incense, sacrifices, and oblations, and led the god into the temple in a procession. As the god walked by the young prince, Thothmes rep orted, He really recognized me and he halted. I touched the ground; I bowed myself down in his presence. He stood me up, set me before the king. Then, as an indication that this prince was the div inely chosen one for the succession, the god \"worked a ma rvel\" over the prince. What ensued, Thothmes III wrote, a s incredi- ble as it sounds, as mysterious these things are, r eally happened: He opened for me the doors of Heaven; He spread open for me the portals of its horizon. I flew up to the sky as a Divine Falcon, able to see his mysterious form which is in Heaven, that I might adore his majesty. [And] I saw the being-form of the Horizon God in his mysterious Ways of Heaven. On this heavenly flight, Thothmes III wrote in his annals, he \"was made full with the Understanding of the god s.\" The experience, and its claims, surely bring to mind th e heavenly ascents of Enmeduranki and Enoch, and the \"Glory of Yah- weh\" seen by the Prophet Ezekiel. The conviction that dreams were divine oracles, for etelling things to come, was a firmly held belief throughout the an- cient Near East. Ethiopian kings also believed in t he power of dreams as guidelines for actions to be taken (or avoided) and of events about to happen. One instance, recorded on a stela by the Ethiopian king Tanutamun, relates that in the first year of his re ign \"his majesty saw a dream in the night.\" In the dream the king"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"230 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS saw \"two serpents, one on his right, one on his lef t.\" The vision was so real that when the king awoke, he was aston- ished not to find the serpents actually beside him. He called the priests and seers to interpret the dream, and t hey said that the two serpents represented two goddesses, re presenting Upper and Lower Egypt. The dream, they said, meant that he could conquer the whole of Egypt \"in its length and in its breadth; there is no other to share it with you .\" So the king \"went forth, and a hundred thousand followed h im,\" and he conquered Egypt. So, he wrote on the stela comme morating the dream and its aftermath, \"true indeed was the d ream.\" A divine oracle given by the god Amon, though in br oad daylight rather than in a dream, is reported in an inscription on a stela found in Upper Egypt near the Nubian bor der. It relates that when an Ethiopian king was leading his army into Egypt, he suddenly died. His commanders were \" like a herd without a herdsman.\" They knew that the next k ing had to be chosen from among the king's brothers, but wh ich one? So they went to the Temple of Amon to obtain an ora cle. After the \"prophets and major priests\" performed th e re- quired rites, the commanders presented one of the k ing's brothers to the god, but there was silence. They th en pre- sented the second brother, born to the king's siste r. This time the god spoke up, saying: \"He is your king ... He i s your ruler.\" So the commanders crowned this brother, who as- sumed the Kingship after the deity assured him of d ivine support. This tale of the selection of a successor to the Et hiopian king includes a detail that usually goes unnoticed— the fact that the divinely chosen successor was the son born to the king by his sister. We find a parallel in the bibli cal tale of Abraham and his beautiful wife Sarah, whom Abimelec h, the Philistine king of Gerar, fancied. Once before, whe n they visited the Pharaoh's court in Egypt, when the Phar aoh wished to take Sarah away from Abraham, Abraham ask ed her to say that she was his sister (not his wife) s o that his life would be spared. Wisened by the experience, Ab raham again asked Sarah to say that she was only a sister of Abra- ham. But when Abimelech proceeded with his plan, th e Lord intervened:"},{"pageNumber":235,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 231 And Elohim came to Abimelech in a nighttime dream, saying to him: \"Indeed thou shalt die on account of the woman whom thou hast taken, for she is a man's wife. \"And Abimelech did not come near her,\" explaining t o the Lord that he was innocent, for Abraham \"did say to me, 'She is my sister' and she too hath said, 'He is my brother'.\" So \"Elohim said to him, in the dream,\" mat if so he would not be punished as long as he returned Sarah to Abr aham untouched. Afterward, when Abimelech demanded an ex pla- nation from Abraham, Abraham explained that fearing for his life he did tell the truth but not the whole truth: \"Indeed she is my sister, the daughter of my lather but not the daughter of my mother, so she could become my wife.\" By bein g his half sister Sarah assured that her son (Isaac), eve n if not the Firstborn, would be the successor. These rules of s uccession, emulating the customs of the Anunnaki themselves, p revailed throughout the ancient Near East (and were even cop ied by the Incas in Peru). The Philistines called their principal deity Dagon, a name or epithet that can be translated as \"He of the Fis hes\"—the god of Pisces, an attribute of Ea/Enki. This i d e n t i f i c a t i o n . however, is not so clear-cut and certain, because w hen this deity appears elsewhere in the ancient Near East, h is name is spelled Dagan, which could mean \"He of the Grain s\"— a god of farming. Whatever his true identity, this god featured in several omen-dreams reported in the state archiv es of the kingdom of Mari, a city-state that flourished at th e beginning of the second millennium B . C . until its destruction by the Babylonian king Hammurabi in 1759 B . C . One report from Mari pertains to a dream whose cont ents were deemed so significant that it was at once brou ght by messenger to the attention of Zimri-Lim, the last k ing of Mari. In the dream the man saw himself journeying w ith others. Arriving at a place called Terqa, he entere d the temple to Dagan and prostrated himself. At that moment the god \"opened his mouth\" and asked the traveler whether a truce had been declared between the forces of Zimri-Lim a nd those"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"232 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS of the Yaminites. When the traveler answered in the negative, the god complained why he had not been kept abreast of developments and instructed the dreamer to take a m essage to the king, demanding that he send messengers to u pdate the god on the situation. \"This is what this man sa w in his dream,\" the urgent report to the king stated, addin g that \"this man is trustworthy.\" Another dream concerning Dagan and the wars in whic h Zimri-Lim was engaged was reported by a temple prie stess. In the dream, she stated, \"I entered the temple of the goddess Belet-ekallim (\"Mistress of Temples\") but she was n ot in residence nor did I see the statues presented to he r. As I saw this I began to weep.\" Then I heard \"an eery voice crying, saying over and over again: 'Come back, O Dagan, co me back, O Dagan!' This it was crying over and over.\" Then the voice became more ecstatic, filling the temple of the god- dess with the voice, saying: \"O Zimri-Lim, do not g o on an expedition, stay in Mari, and then I alone will tak e responsi- bility.\" The goddess who spoke out in this dream, offering t o do the fighting for the beleaguered king, is named in the report Annunitum, a Semitic rendering of Inanna, i.e. Isht ar. Her reported willingness to so act for Zimri-Lim makes historical sense, for she was the one who anointed Zimri-Lim t o be king of Mari—a divine act that was commemorated in the magnificent murals found in the palace of Mari (Fig . 79) when it was unearthed by French archaeologists. The priestess who had reported the dream as related , Addu-duri by name, was an oracle priestess. In her report she pointed out that while her oracles were based i n the past on \"signs,\" this was the first time she had had an oracle dream. Her name is mentioned in another dream repor t, but this time of a dream by a male priest in which he s aw the Goddess of Oracles speak to him about the king's \"n egli- gence in guarding himself.\" (In other instances ora cle priest- esses reported to the king divine messages obtained while they were in a self-induced trance, rather than sle eping and dreaming).

(A longer route but through the F ertile Crescent led via Harran on the Upper Euphrates). No wonder, then, that the Canaanites of the coastal lands, as their neigh- bors the Philistines, believed in (and reported) dr eams as a form of Divine Encounter. Though their writings (of which we know primarily from finds in Ras Shamra, the anc ient Ugarit, on the Mediterranean coast in Syria) dealt mostly with legends or \"myths\" of the god Baal, his companion t he goddess Anat, and their father the aging god El, th ey do mention oracle dreams by patriarchal heroes. Thus, in the Tale of Aqhat, a patriarch by name of Danel who is without a male heir is told by El in a dream-omen that he w ould have a son within a year—just as Abraham was told b y Yah- weh regarding the birth of Isaac. (When the boy, Aq hat, grows up, Anat lusts for him and, as she had done w ith Gilgamesh, promises him longevity if he would becom e her lover. When he refuses, she causes him to be slain) . Dreams as a venerated form of divine communication were also recorded in the lands on the Upper Euphrates a nd all the way into Asia Minor.

Egyptian records of royal omen-dreams include a tex t known to scholars as the Legend of the Possessed Pr incess— one of the oldest records, inter alia, of exorcism. Written on a stela that is now in the Louvre Museum in Paris, it tells how the Prince of Bekhten (the land Bactria on the Upper Euphrates), who had married an Egyptian princess, s ought the help of the Pharaoh Ramses II to cure the princ ess of the \"spirits that possessed her.\" The Pharaoh sent over one of his magicians, but to no avail. So the Prince of Be khten asked that an Egyptian god \"be brought to contend w ith this spirit.\" Receiving the petition in his capital Thebes during a reli- gious festival, the Pharaoh went to the temple of t he god Khensu, described as a son of Ra and usually depict ed with a falcon's head on which the Moon rests in its cres cent. There the king related to the god, \"the great god who exp els dis- ease-demons,\" what the problem was, and requested d ivine help. As he spoke, \"there was much nodding of the h ead of Khensu,\" indicating a favorable hearing. So the kin g put together a great caravan that went to Bekhten accom panying the god (or his \"prophet, the carrier of the plans, \" or the god's statue—as some scholars suggest). And using t he di- vine magical powers, the \"evil spirit\" was exorcise d. Witnessing the magical powers of Khensu, the Prince of Bekhten \"then schemed in his heart, saying: 'I will cause this god to stay here in Bekhten.' \" But having cau sed a delay in the god's return to Egypt, while \"the Prin ce of Bekhten was sleeping in his bed,\" he had a dream. I n the dream he saw \"this god coming to him outside the sh rine. He was a falcon of gold, and he flew to the sky and off to Egypt.\" The prince \"awoke with panic,\" and realized that the dream was a divine omen, instructing him to let the god return to Egypt. So the prince \"let this god procee d to Egypt, after he had given him much tribute of every good t hing.\" Farther north of Bactria, in the Land of the Hittit es in Asia Minor, the conviction that royal dreams were d ivine revelations was also firmly held.

C . As confirmed by historical records, a plague had afflicted the land decimating the popula tion; and Mursilis could not figure out what had angered the gods. He himself had been pious and deeply religious, \"celeb rated all the festivals, never preferred one temple for anoth er.\" So what was wrong? In desperation, he included the fol lowing words in his prayer: Hearken to me, ye gods, my lords! Drive ye forth the plague from the Hittite land! Let the reason for which the people are dying be established—either by an omen, or let me see it in a dream, or let a prophet declare it. It should be noted that the three methods of obtain ing divine guidance—an oracle dream, an omen, or a comm unica- tion through a prophet—are exactly the very same th ree meth- ods listed by King Saul when he had attempted to ob tain Yahweh's guidance. But, exactly as in the case of t he Israelite king who received no response, so to the appeals of the Hit- tite king \"the gods did not hearken; the plague did not get better; the Land of the Hittites continued to be cr uelly afflicted.\" \"Matters were becoming too much for me,\" Mursilis wrote in this annal, and he redoubled his pious app eals to the god Teshub (\"The Windblower\" or \"Storm God,\" whom the Sumerians called Ishkur and the Semitic pe oples Adad, Fig. 80). Finally he managed to receive an or acle; since it was neither an omen nor a prophecy, it mus t have been a dream-oracle, the third method of divine com munica- tion with the king. It was thus that Mursilis learn ed that his father Shuppiliumas, in whose time the plague began , did transgress in two ways: he discontinued certain off erings to the gods, and he broke his oath in a treaty with th e Egyptians to keep the peace, and took Egyptian captives back to Hatti- land; and it was with them that the plague came to nest among the Hittites."},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"236 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS If that was so, the king told Teshub in his supplic ations, he would offer restitution, \"acknowledge his father 's sins,\" and accept full responsibility. If more repentance or restitu- tion was required, he asked the god again to \"let m e see it in a dream, or let it be found by an omen, or let a prophet declare it to me.\" He thus listed again the three accepted or expected methods of divine communication. Since the text, when found , ends here, one must assume that with that the wrath of T eshub had ended and so did the plague. Other Hittite inscriptions recording Divine Encount ers through dreams and visions have been found. Some of them concern the goddess Ishtar, the Sumerian Inanna, wh ose rise to prominence continued well after Sumerian times. In one such inscription, the Hittite prince who was heir to the throne stated that the goddess appeared to his father in a dream, telling him that the young prince had only a few years to live; but that if he be dedicated as a priest to Ishtar, \"then he shall stay alive.\" When the king followed the or acle dream, the prince lived on and his brother (Muwatal lis) inher- ited the throne in his stead.

Be not afraid!' And with the help of the goddess I was acquitted; because the go ddess, my Lady, held me by the hand; she never abandoned me t o a hostile deity or an evil judgment.\" According to the various Hittite royal annals from that time, the goddess Ishtar announced her support of H attusilis III in his struggle for the throne with his brother Mutawallis in several oracle dreams. In one report the claim w as made that the goddess promised the Hittite throne to Hat tusilis in a dream by his wife—a wife, according to another dr eam- record, espoused by him \"upon the command of the go ddess Ishtar; the goddess entrusted her to me in a dream. \" In a third dream report, Ishtar is said to have appeared to Urhi- Teshub, the heir appointed by Mutawallis to succeed him, and told him in a dream that all his efforts to thw art Hattusilis were in vain: \"Aimlessly you have tired yourselves out, for I, Ishtar, all the lands of the Hittites to Hattusi lis have turned over.\" Hittite dream reports, at least to the extent that they have been found, reflect the importance that was attache d there to the proper observance of the rites and requirements of wor- ship. In one discovered text \"a dream of his majest y the king\" is reported thus: In the dream, the Lady Heba t Who Judges (the spouse of Teshub) said again and again to his majesty, 'When the Storm God comes from heaven, he should not find you to be stingy.' While dreaming, the kin g re- sponded that he had made a golden ritual object for the god. But the goddess said, \"It is not enough!\" Then anou ier king, the king of Hakmish, entered the dream-conversation , saying to his majesty: \"Why have you not given the Huhupal -instru- ments and the lapis-lazuli stones which you have pr omised to Teshub?\" When the Hittite king awoke from this trialogued dr eam, he reported it to the priestess Hebatsum.

On e such record, that begins with the introductory statement \"A dream of the queen,\" states that \"the queen has made a vo w in a dream to the goddess Hebat.\" In that dream-vow, the queen said to the goddess: \"If you, my Lady, Divine Hebat , will make the king well and not give him over to the Evi l, I shall make for Divine Hebat a golden statue and a rosette of gold, and for your breast I shall also make a golden pect oral.\" In yet another instance, the recorded event was the appear- ance of an unidentified god to the queen in a dream —perhaps the same queen who sought Hebat's intervention to c ure her sick royal spouse. In the dream this god told the q ueen \"re- garding the matter which weighs heavily on your hea rt con- cerning your husband: He will live; I shall give hi m 100 years.\" Hearing that, \"the queen made a vow in her dream as follows: 'If you do thus for me and my husband r emains alive, I shall give to the gods three Harshialli-co ntainers, one with oil, one with honey and one with fruits.' \" The king's illness must have indeed weighed heavily on this queen's heart, for in a third dream record the queen reported that someone whom she could not see said a gain and again to her in the dream: \"Make a vow to the g oddess Ningal\" (the spouse of Nannar/Sin), promising the g oddess ritual objects of gold decorated with lapis lazuli if the king recovers. Here the sickness is described as \"fire o f the feet.\" In another part of Asia Minor, in Lydia where Greek cities prospered, a king named Gyges had—according to his adver- sary the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal—a dream-vision. In it the sleeping king was shown an inscription that spe lled out the name of Ashurbanipal. The divine message said: \"Bow before the feet of Ashurbanipal, the King of Assyri a; then you will conquer your enemies just by mentioning this n ame.\" According to the Assyrian king's inscription in his annals, King Gyges, \"the very same day that he had this dre am, sent a horseman to wish me well and report the dream to me; and from the day he bowed before my royal feet, he conq uered"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Figure 81 the Cimmerians who had been harassing the inhabitan ts of his country.\" The Assyrian king's interest in, and recording of, the dream of a foreign king was but a reflection of the exten t of Assyr- ian beliefs in the power of dreams as a form of Div ine En- counter. The epiphanies and oracles conveyed by roy al dreams were a phenomenon eagerly sought after, and re- ported, by the kings of Assyria; the same held true for the kings of their neighbor and rival Babylonia. Ashurbanipal himself (686-626 B.C.), who kept exten sive annals on baked clay prisms (as this one now in the Louvre Museum—Fig. 81), recorded several dream experiences ; often they were by others rather than himself, just as was the case with King Gyges. In one instance it was a record of a priest who wen t to sleep and in the middle of the night \"had a dream a s follows: There was writing upon the pedestal of the god Sin; the god Nabu, scribe of the world, was reading the inscript ion again and again: 'Upon those who plot evil against Ashurb anipal, king of Assyria, and resort to hostilities, I shall bring misera- ble death, I shall put an end to their lives with a quick iron Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 239"},{"pageNumber":244,"pageContent":"240 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS dagger, conflagration, hunger and disease.' \" A pos tscript by Ashurbanipal to this report of a dream stated: \"Thi s dream I heard and put my trust in the word of my Lord Sin .\" In another instance it was asserted that one and th e same dream—vision might be a better term—was experienced by a whole army. In the relevant record Ashurbanipal e xplains that when his army reached the river Idide it was a raging torrent and the soldiers were afraid to try a cross ing. \"But the goddess Ishtar who dwells in Arbela let my army have a dream in the middle of the night.\" In this mass d ream or vision Ishtar was heard to say, \"I shall go in f ront of Ashurbanipal, the king whom I have myself made.\" Th e army, Ashurbanipal added as a postscript, \"relied u pon this dream and crossed the river Idide safely.\" (Hi storical data confirm a crossing of this river by Ashurbanip al's army circa 648 B . C .) In the introduction to another dream concerning his reign Ashurbanipal claimed that the dream, by a priest of the god- dess Ishtar, resulted from a prior auditory communi cation from the goddess directly to the king himself. \"The goddess Ishtar heard my anxious sighs and said to me, 'Fear not ... inasmuch as you have lifted your hands in prayer an d your eyes are filled with tears, I have mercy upon you.' \" It was during that very same night of the above epi phany that \"a seer-priest went to bed and saw a dream; wh en he awoke with a start, Ishtar made him see a night-vis ion.\" As reported by the priest to Ashurbanipal, what he saw in the nocturnal vision was this: \"The goddess Ishtar who dwells in Arbela came in; quivers were hanging at her righ t and her left; she held the bow in her hand; her sharp sword was drawn for battle. You were standing before her and she spoke to you like a real mother.\" Then, the priest report ed, he heard in the night-vision Ishtar say to the king: \"Wait w ith the attack; wherever you go, I shall go ahead of you .. . Stay here, eat, drink wine and make merry and praise my divinity, while I shall go ahead and accomplish the task that you have asked for.\" Then, the priest continued to describe the vision: The goddess embraced the king and wrapped him in he r pro- tective aura; \"her countenance shone like fire, and she left the room.\" The vision, the seer-priest told the kin g, meant"},{"pageNumber":245,"pageContent":" Figure 83 that Ishtar will be at his side when he marches aga inst his enemy. The vision of Ishtar armed and as a warlike goddess emitting rays has been recorded in various ancient depictions (Fig. 82). The annals of Ashurbanipal, who claimed that among his great knowledge was the ability to interpret dreams , are re- plete with references to oracles—probably through d reams, though this is not specified—given him by this or t hat of the \"great gods, my lords\" in connection with his m ilitary campaigns. His interest in dreams and their interpr etation led him also to have state archives examined for record s of past oracle dreams. Thus we learn that an archivist by t he name of Marduk-shum-usur reported to Ashurbanipal that h is grandfather Sennacherib had a dream in which the go d Ashur (Fig. 83), Assyria's national god, appeared to him and said, \"O wise one, king, king of kings: You are the offsp ring of Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 241 Figure 82"},{"pageNumber":246,"pageContent":"242 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS wise Adapa; you surpass all men in the knowledge of Apsu (Enki's domain).\" In the same report the archivist, evidently trained as an omen-priest, also reported to Ashurbanipal the circ umstances that made his father, Esarhaddon, invade Egypt. It was when \"thy father Esarhaddon was in the region of Harran that he saw mere a temple of cedarwood, and he went in, and saw inside the god Sin leaning on a staff, holding two crowns.\" The god Nusku, the Divine Messenger of the gods, \"w as standing there before him; when the father of the k ing en- tered, the god placed a crown upon his head, saying , 'You will go to countries, therein you will conquer.' Yo ur father departed and conquered Egypt.\" Though the text does not say so explicitly, it is p resumed that the incident at the temple in Harran was also a dream, a vision-dream seen by Esarhaddon. Indeed, both his torical and religious texts from that time indicate that Na nnar/Sin had left Mesopotamia after Sumer had been desolated and Marduk returned to Babylon to claim supremacy \"on E arth and in Heaven\" (in 2024 B . C . by our calculations). Harran, where Esarhaddon received the permissive oracle fro m the absent god, had been a twin cult center of Nannar/S in, emulating that of Nannar/Sin's principal center in Sumer— the city of Ur. It was to Harran that Abraham's fat her, the priest Terah, took his family when they left Ur. An d, as we shall see, Harran came again into prominence whe n dream-omens and real events once again changed the course of history. As prophesied by the biblical Prophets, mighty Assy ria, the scourge of nations, lay prostrate before Achaemenid (Persian) invaders, who overran Nineveh in 612 B . C . In Babylon Nebu- chadnezzar, freed of Assyrian constraints, rushed i nto the void, capturing lands near and far, destroying the Temple in Jerusalem. But the days of Babylon were also number ed, and the end was foretold to the haughty king in a serie s of dreams. As recorded in the Bible (Daniel chapter 2) Nebu- chadnezzar had a troubling dream. He called in \"the magi- cians, seers, sorcerers and Chaldeans\" (i.e. astrol ogers) and asked them to interpret the dream—however, without telling them what the dream was. Unable to do so, he ordere d their"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 243 execution. But then Daniel was brought before the k ing, and invoked the powers of the \"God in heaven who reveal s mys- teries.\" As the executioner of the others was told to halt, Daniel first guessed the dream and then solved its meaning. \"In your vision,\" he told the king, \"you saw a very large statue, exceedingly bright, terrifying in appearanc e, standing before thee.\" The statue's head was made of gold, i ts chest and arms of silver, its belly and thighs of bronze, the legs of iron, the feet part iron and part clay. Then a ston e that no hand held appeared and smote the statue to pieces; the pieces turned to chaff that was carried by a wind into obl ivion; and the stone turned into a great mountain. \"This is the dream,\" Daniel said, and here is its m eaning: The statue represents the great Babylon; the golden head is Nebuchadnezzar; after him there shall be three less er kings; and in the end it will all be swept away like chaff , and a new king from elsewhere shall rise to greatness. Nebuchadnezzar then had a second dream. He called i n the seers, including Daniel. In \"visions as he lay in bed,\" the king said, he saw a tall tree that kept growing until it reached the heavens; it was a fruitful and shade-gi ving tree. Suddenly, In the vision, at the head of my bed, a Watcher, a Holy One, came down from heaven. He cried out aloud, saying: \"Cut down the tree and lop off its branches, strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit, let the beasts flee its shade and the birds its bra nches; but leave in the ground its stump and roots.\" And Daniel told the king that the tree was he, Nebu chad- nezzar; and the vision was an oracle of things to c ome—the end of Nebuchadnezzar, doomed to lose his mind and roam the fields like windblown leaves and eat like the b easts. Tradi- tion holds that Nebuchadnezzar indeed went mad, dyi ng seven years after that oracle dream (in 562 B.C.).

It was as a result that the last effective king of Babylon and his dre ams linked the end of Mesopotamian civilizations to Harran. Th e time was 555 B . C . In order for a non-Babylonian and a follower of Sin to rule in Babylon, the approval of Marduk, and a rapp roche- ment between this son of Enki and the son (Sin) of Enlil were required. The double blessing and the rapproch ement were confirmed—perhaps achieved—by means of several dreams by Nabuna'id. They were so important that he re- corded them on stelas, for all to know. The omen-dreams of Nabuna'id had some unusual featu res. In at least two of them planets representing deitie s made an appearance. In another, the apparition of a dead ki ng took part in the goings-on, and it was divided into two parts as a way to relate a dream within a dream. In the first of those recorded dreams, Nabuna'id sa w \"the planet Venus, the planet Saturn, the planet Ab-Hal, the Shin- ing Planet, and the Great Star, the great witnesses who dwell in heaven.\" He (in the dream) set up altars to them and prayed for lasting life, enduring rule, and a favor able response to his prayers by Marduk. He then—in the same dream or in a sequel thereto—\"lay down and beheld in a nightly vision the Great Goddess who restores health and bestows l ife on the dead.\" He prayed to her, too, for lasting life \"and asked that she might turn her face toward me\"; and She actually did turn, and looked steadily upon me with her shining face, thus indicating her mercy. In the preamble to the report of another dream Nabu na'id states that he ' 'became apprehensive in regard to the conjunc- tion of the Great Star and the Moon,\" the celestial counter- parts of Marduk and Nannar/Sin. Then he went on to tell the dream:"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"Royal Dreams, Fateful Oracles 245 In the dream, a man's apparition suddenly stood be- side me. He said to me: \"There are no evil portents in the conjunction.\" In the same dream Nubuchadnezzar, my royal prede- cessor, appeared to me. He was standing on a chario t with one attendant. The attendant said to Nebuchadn ez- zar: \"Do speak to Nabunaid so that he would report to you the dream he just had!\" Nebuchadnezzar listened to him and said to me: \"Tell me what good omens you have seen.\" I answered him, saying, \"In my dream I saw with joy the Great Star and the Moon. And the planet of Marduk, high up in the sky, called me by my name.\" The conjunction of the celestial counterparts of Ma rduk and Sin signified, thus, the agreement of both to t he ascent of Nabuna'id to the throne; the inquiring departed Nebuchad- nezzar and the satisfactory answer given him signif ied that he, too, in a kind of retrospect, approved mis succ ession. The third dream carried the rapprochement between M ar- duk and Sin even farther. In it \"the great gods\" Ma rduk and Sin were seen standing together, and Marduk reprima nded the king for not yet beginning the rebuilding of Si n's temple in Harran. In the two-way conversation, Nabuna'id e xplained that he could not do that because the Medians were laying siege to the city.

And he reached a certain place and went to sleep there, for the sun had set. And he took of th e stones of that place and put them to rest his head on, and he lay down in that place. And he dreamed, and beheld a ladder set up on the ground with its top reaching up to the sky. And beh old, angels of Elohim were going up and coming down on i t. And behold, there was Yahweh standing upon it, and he spoke, saying: \"I am Yahweh, the Elohim of Abra- ham thy ancestor and the Elohim of Isaac. The land upon which thou liest, to thee I will give it and t o thy seed. And thy seed shall be spread as dust on the ground, spreading west and east and northward and southward; and in thee and in thy seed shall all th e communities of the Earth be blessed. Behold, I am w ith thee; I will protect thee wherever thou goest, and I shall bring thee back to this land.

The wording is akin to that applied to Bab ylon (Bab-Ili, \"Gateway of the Elohim''') where the inci dent of the launch tower \"whose head shall reach to heaven\" had taken place. The commander identified himself to Jacob as \"Yahwe h, the Elohim\"—the DIN.GIR—\"of Abraham thy forefather and the Elohim of Isaac.\" The operators of the \"lad der\" are identified as \"Angels of Elohim,\" not simply as ang els; and Jacob, realizing that he had unknowingly stumbled u pon a site used by these divine aeronauts, named the plac e Beth-El (\"The House of El\"), El being the singular of Elohi m. A few words on etymology and thus on the identity o f these \"angels\" are required. The Bible is careful to identify the subordinates o f the deity as \"Angels of Elohim\" and not simply as \"ange ls,\" because the Hebrew term Mal'akhim does not mean \"an gels\" at all; it literally means \"emissaries\"; and the te rm is em- ployed in the Bible for regular, flesh-and-blood hu man emis- saries who carried royal rather than divine message s. King Saul sent Mal'akhim (commonly translated \"messenger s\") to summon David (I Samuel 16:19); David sent Mal'akhim (also translated \"messengers\") to the people of Jabesh Gi lead to inform them that he had been anointed king (II Samu el 2:5); King Ahaz of Judaea sent Mal'akhim (\"emissaries\") t o the Assyrian king Tiglat-Pileser for help to ward off e nemy at- tacks (II Kings 16:7), and so on. Etymologically, t he term stems from the same root as Mela'kha which has been vari- ably translated as \"work,\" \"craft,\" \"workmanship.\" The Bible employs the term in this derivation in connec tion with the \"Wisdom and Understanding\" that Yahweh gave Bez alel to be able to carry out the Melakha required for bu ilding the Tabernacle and the Ark of the Covenant in the Sinai wilder- ness, so a Mal'akh (the singular of Mal'akhim) sign ified not a mere messenger but a special emissary, trained an d qualified for the task and with some powers of discretion (as an ambas- sador would have).

Meeting Rachel at the water well in the grazing fie lds of Harran and discovering that she was the daughter of his uncle Laban, Jacob asked Laban's permission to marry her. The uncle agreed if Jacob would in exchange serve Laban seven years; but when he did, Laban made him marry first his older daughter Leah, demanding that he serve another seve n years to have Rachel as a second wife. Upon the insistenc e of Laban, Jacob, his wives, the children they bore him , and the flocks that he managed to amass, stayed on and on—f or twenty years. Then one night Jacob had a dream. In the dream he saw \"rams leaping upon the flocks, and they were streaked, and speckled, and grizzled.\" Puzzled by w hat he was seeing, Jacob then received a divine oracle in the second part of the dream in which an \"Angel of the Elohim\" ap- peared and called out his name. \"And Jacob said, He re I am. And the angel said, Lift up thy eyes and see thou a ll of the rams that leap upon the flocks; they are streaked a nd speckled and grizzled because I have seen all that Laban had done to thee.

When the news reached Laban, he was furious. \"But E lohim came unto Laban the Aramean in a nighttime dream, s aying to him: Take thou heed! Speak neither threats nor s weettalk Jacob.\" Thus admonished, Laban in the end consented to Jacob's departure, and the two set up a stone to se rve as a boundary between them, not to be crossed by either one of them in anger. In witness of the treaty's vows the Elohim were invoked as guarantors. The placing of such a boundary stone conformed to t he customs of the day.

The biblical data suggests that the favored route o f the Patriarchs between the Negev (the southern part of Canaan bordering on the Sinai peninsula), of which Beershe ba was (and still is) the principal city, involved a cross ing of the Jordan River; this indicates that The King's Highwa y east of the river was used (rather than the coastal Way of the Sea— see Map).

The event is recorded here in just two verses, sign ificantly constituting a separate section in the formal enscr ibing of the Bible. In the following verses the subsequent, but unrelated, tale of Jacob's meeting with his brother Esau is to ld. The manner in which the ancient editors of the Scriptur es treated these two verses brings to mind the manner in which the segment on the Nefilim has been told in chapter 6 o f Genesis (preceding the tale of Noah and the ark), where the segment is clearly a retained remnant of a longer text. So must have been this reference to the encounter with an actual group or troup of Divine Emissaries—two verses remaining out of a much longer and detailed record. The ancient editors of Genesis must have retained t he brief mention because of the subsequent episode, that had to be included because it explains why Jacob's name was c hanged to \"Israel.\" Reaching the Crossing of Yabbok, and uncertain what his brother Esau's attitude would be to see his rival f or the suc- cession return, Jacob adopted a strategy of sending forth his retinue a little at a time. Finally only he and his two wives and two handmaidens and his eleven children remaine d in his encampment for the night; so, under the cover o f dark- ness, Jacob \"took them and had them cross the strea m, bring- ing over all that had remained.\" Then the unexpected Divine Encounter happened: And Jacob was left alone; And there wrestled with him a man until daybreak at dawn. And seeing that he could not prevail against him, he struck against the hollow of his (Jacob's) thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was put out of joint as he was wrestling with him.

(Isra-El is a play on the words meaning \"strive, co ntest\" with El, a deity). And Jacob asked him, saying: \"Do tell me your name!\" And he said: \"Wherefor dost thou ask for my name?\" And he blessed him there. And Jacob named the place Peni-El (the Face of El) For I have seen Elohim face to face and my life was preserved. And it was sunrise when he crossed at Peniel, limping on his thigh. The first reference in the Bible to an Angel of the Lord, in chapter 16 of Genesis, relates an event in the t ime of Jacob's grandfather Abraham. Abraham and his wife S arah were getting old—he in his mid eighties, she ten ye ars younger; and still they had no offspring. Abraham h ad just fulfilled the mission for which he had been ordered to Ca- naan—to ward off attacks on the Spaceport in the Si nai: the War of the Kings (described in chapter 14 of Genesi s). The grateful Lord Yahweh Appeared to Abram in a vision, saying: \"Fear not Abram; I am thy shield; thy reward shall be exceedingly great.''

And he brought him out, and said: \"Look now up to the heavens, and count the stars, if thou be able to number them; that many shall be thy seed.'' \"It was on that day that Yahweh had made a Covenant with Abram, saying: Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the Brook of Egypt until the great river, the River Euphrates.\" But, the biblical tale continues, in spite of that promise of countless descendants, Sarah still did not bear a c hild to Abra- ham. So Sarah said to Abraham that perhaps it was t he Lord's intention that Abraham's offspring should not depen d on her ability to bear children, and suggested that he \"co me unto\" Hagar, her Egyptian handmaiden. And \"Hagar became p reg- nant,\" and began to belittle her mistress. Although it was her own suggestion, Sarah was now f uri- ous, \"and dealt harshly with Hagar,\" and Hagar ran away. And an angel of Yahweh found her by a spring in the desert, the spring which is on the Way of Shur. And he said to Hagar, Sarah's handmaiden, \"Whence comest thou and whither goest thou?\" Explaining that she was running away from her mistr ess Sarah, the angel told her to go back, for she would have a son and by him numerous offspring. \"And thou shalt call his name Ishma-El\"—'God Has Heard'—for Yahweh hath hear d thy plight.\" So Hagar went back and gave birth to I shmael; \"and Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ish- mael to Abram.\" It was not before another thirteen years had passed that Yahweh once again \"appeared unto Abram\" and, reaffirming the Covenant with Abraham and his offsp ring,"},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"258 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS took steps to provide Abraham with legitimate succe ssion through a son by his half sister (Sarah). As part o f the legiti- mization, Abraham and all his male household had to be circumcised; and as part of inheriting Canaan and s evering the remaining ties to the Old Country, Sumer, the H ebrew Patriarch and his wife had to shed their Sumerian n ames (Abram and Sarai) and adopt Semitic versions thereo f, Abra- ham and Sarah.

And Abraham was ninety-nine years old at the time. The details of these divine instructions, coupled w ith the foretelling of the birth of Isaac by Sarah, are giv en in chapter 17 of Genesis. The circumstances—the Theophany lead ing to the upheavaling of Sodom and Gomorrah—are described in the following chapter, \"when Yahweh showed himself\" to Abraham. The aging Patriarch was sitting at the ent rance to his tent; it was midday, the hottest time of the da y. Suddenly, three strangers appeared to Abraham as if from nowh ere: And he lifted up his eyes and lo, he beheld three persons standing above him.

And one of them, inquiring about Sarah, said: \"In a year's time, when I return to thee, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.\" Overhearing that in the tent, Sarah laughed , for how could she and Abraham, too old by now, have a son? Then Yahweh said unto Abraham: \"Wherefore did Sarah laugh, thinking: Would I really bear a child when I have waxed old? Is anything too wondrous for Yahweh? At the appointed time I will return unto thee, at the same time next year, and Sarah will then have a son. And it would be through Isaac and his seed that the Cove- nant with Abraham shall be everlasting, Yahweh said . As the tale continues, we read that \"the persons ro se up from there to survey over upon Sodom; and Abraham w ent with them to see them off.\" But while the narrative continues to describe the three sudden visitors as Anashim—\"p er- sons\"—the oracle regarding the coming birth of Isaa c (whose Hebrew name, Itz'hak, was a play on words on the \"l augh- ing\" by Sarah) has let us know that one of the thre e was none other than Yahweh himself. It was a most remar kable Theophany in which the Hebrew Patriarch was privile ged to have the Lord Yahweh as his guest! Arriving at a promontory from which Sodom could be seen down in the valley of the Sea of Salt, Yahweh decid ed to tell Abraham what was the reason for the visit. Because the outcry regarding Sodom and Gomorrah has been great, and the accusations against them being grievous, [I said:] Let me come down and verify: If it is as the outcry reaching me, they will destroy completely; and if not, I wish to know."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"260 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS This then was the mission of the other two \"persons \" who were with Yahweh—to verify the truth about, or exte nt of, the \"sinning\" of the two cities in the Jordan valle y near what is now the Dead Sea, so that the Lord could de termine their fate. \"And the persons turned from there and went to Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before Yahweh, \" we read in Genesis 18:22; but when the arrival of t he two \"persons\" at Sodom is reported next (Genesis 19:1), it be- comes clear who the two were: \"And the two angels c ame to Sodom in the evening.\" The three visitors who ha d ap- peared to Abraham were, thus, Yahweh and two of his emissaries. Before the Bible focuses on the angels' visit to So dom and Gomorrah and the ensuing destruction of the \"evil c ities,\" the Bible reports a most unusual discourse between Abraham and Yahweh. Approaching the Lord, Abraham took on t he role of an intercessor, a defense lawyer, for Sodom (where his nephew Lot and his family have been residing). \"Perhaps there be fifty Righteous Ones inside the city,\" he said to Yahweh, \"wilt thou destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty? Surely, far be it from thee, to slay the Righteous with the wicked?\" Reminding Yahweh that he was \"Judge of all the Eart h,\" one who would always do justice, Abraham placed the Lord in a dilemma. So the Lord Yahweh answered that if t here be fifty Righteous Ones in Sodom, he would spare the w hole city. But no sooner had the Lord consented thus, th an Abra- ham—asking forgiveness for his audacity in \"taking leave to speak to my Lord\"—posed another question: What if t he number, fifty, shall fall short by five? \"And He sa id, 1 will not destroy if I find there forty-five.\" Seizing th e offensive, Abraham then bargained on, reducing the number of R igh- teous Ones on account of whom the whole city would be spared all the way down to ten. And with that, \"Elo him went up from over Abraham,\" rising skyward from whence H e had appeared earlier in the day. \"And Abraham retur ned to his place.\" \"And the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, a nd Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. And Lot, seei ng them, rose up toward them and bowed himself with the face to the"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 261 ground. And he said, If it please my lords, do turn unto thy servant's house for the night, and wash your feet; and in the morning, arising early, continue on your way.\" As t he two stayed in Lot's house, \"the people of the city, the people of Sodom, young and old, closed in on the house; and t hey called out unto Lot: 'Where are the men who had com e to thee tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may k now them.' \" And when the people persisted, even attemp ting to break down the door to Lot's house, the angels \"smo te the people at the door, young and old, with a blindness , and they gave up finding the door.\" Did the angels use some magical wand, a beam emitte r, with whose powerful ray the people who were trying to break down the door were smitten with blindness? In the a nswer to this question lies the answer to a greater puzzl e. In describ- ing the arrival of the visitors to Abraham and then to Lot, the visitors are called Anashim—\"people\" (not neces sarily \"men\" as the term is often translated). Yet in both instances the hosts at once recognize something that made the m look different, something \"divine\" about them. The hosts call them right away \"lords,\" bow to them. If, as it is described, the visitors were fully anthropomorphic, what was n everthe- less so different and distinguishing about them? The answer that comes instantly to mind will no dou bt be, Why—of course—their wings! But that, as we shall sh ow, is not necessarily so. The popular notion of angels, an image sustained an d bol- stered by centuries of religious art, is that of fu lly anthropo- morphic, humanlike beings who, unlike people, are e quipped with wings. Indeed, were they to be stripped of the ir wings, they would be indistinguishable from humans. Brough t over to Western iconography by early Christianity, the u ndoubted origin of such a representation of angels was the a ncient Near East. We found them in Sumerian art—the winged emis sary who led Enkidu away, the guardians with the deadly beams. We find them in the religious art of Assyria and Eg ypt, Ca- naan and Phoenicia (Fig. 87).

Cherub (t he sin- gular of Cherubim) derives from the Akkadian Karabu —to \"bless, consecrate.\" A Karibu (male) was \"a blessed /conse- crated one\" and a female Kuribi meant a Protective Goddess. As such the biblical Cherubim were assigned (Genesi s 3:24) to guard \"the way to the Tree of Life\" lest the exp elled Adam and Eve return to the Garden of Eden; to prote ct with their wings the Ark of the Covenant; and to serve a s bearers of the Lord, be it as supporters of the Divine Thro ne in the Ezekiel vision or by simply carrying Yahweh aloft: \"He rode upon a Cherub and flew away,\" we read in II Samuel 22:11 and Psalms 18:11 (another parallel to the tale of E tana). Ac- cording to the Bible, then, the winged Cherubim had specific and limited functions; not so the Mal'akhim, the Em issaries who had come and gone on assigned missions and, as plenipotentiary ambassadors, had considerable discr etionary powers. This is made clear from the events at Sodom. Having seen for themselves the viciousness of the people of Sod om, the two Mai 'akhim instructed Lot and his family to lea ve at once, Figure 90"},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 265 \"for Yahweh will destroy this city.\" But Lot tarrie d, and kept asking the \"angels\" to delay the upheavaling o f the city until he, his wife, and two daughters could reach t he safety of the mountains that were not so near. And the emi ssaries granted him the request, promising that they will p ostpone the city's upheavaling to give him and his family time to escape. In both instances (the sudden appearance to Abraham , the arrival at Sodom's gate) the \"angels\" are called \"p eople,\" manlike in appearance; if not winged, what then mad e them recognizable as Divine Emissaries? We find a clue in the representation of the Hittite pantheon, carved in a rock sanctuary at a site called Yazilik aya in Tur- key, not far from the imposing ruins of the Hittite capital. The deities are arranged in two processions, male o nes marching in from the left and female ones marching from the right. Each procession is led by the great gods (Teshub leading the males, Hebat leading the females), foll owed by their offspring, aides, and companies of lesser god s. In the male procession the last to march are twelve \"emiss aries\" whose divinity or role and status are recognized by their headgear and the curved weapon they are holding (Fi g. 91a); ahead of them marches a somewhat more important gro up of twelve, again identified by the headgear and the in strument— a rod with a loop or disc on top—they are holding ( Fig. 91b). This wand is also held by the two principal male de ities (Fig. 91c). The twelve-man companies of these lesser gods in th e Hit- tite depiction bring unavoidably to mind the troop of Mal'ak- him that Jacob encountered on his way back from Har ran— in today's Turkey—to Canaan. What comes to mind, th en, is that the possession of a handheld device was what m ade the angels recognizable for what they were (along with, at least sometimes, their unique headgear). Miraculous deeds performed by Mal'akhim abound in t he Bible, the blinding of the unruly crowd at Sodom be ing just one of them; a similar incident of magical blinding is reported in connection with the activities and prophecies of Elisha, the disciple and successor of the Prophet Elijah. In an other in- stance Elijah himself, escaping for his life after having hun- dreds of the priests of Ba'al killed, was saved by an \"Angel"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"266 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS of Yahweh\" as he became exhausted without food and water in the Negev desert—in the very same area where the Angel saved the wandering, thirsty, and hungry Hagar.

He ate and drank a little and fell aslee p—only to be touched again by the Angel, telling him to consu me all the food and the water because there is a long way ahead (the destination was \"the Mount of the Elohim,\" Mount Si nai, in the Wilderness). Though the narrative (I Kings 19:5 -7) does not state how the Angel touched Elijah, one can saf ely as- sume that it was not with his hand but with the div ine wand or staff.

When the Angel appeared a second time to make sure the instructions for conceiving and for r aising the boy were being followed, Mano'ah sought to verify t he speaker's identity, for he looked like \"a man.\" So he asked the emissary, \"What is thy name?\" Instead of revealing his identity, the \"angel did a wonder\": And the angel of Yahweh said to him: \"Why askest thou for my name, which is a secret?\" So Manoah took the kid of sacrifice and placed it on the rock"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 269 as an offering to Yahweh. And the angel did a wonder, as Manoah and his wife looked on: As the flame rose up from the altar, the angel of Yahweh ascended skyward within the flame. And Manoah and his wife were witnessing this; and they fell on their faces to the ground. After that the angel of Yahweh did not appear anymore to Manoah and his wife. But Manoah then knew that an angel of Yahweh it was. A more renowned instance of using fire magically in order to convince the observer that he is indeed being gi ven a divine message is the incident of the Burning Bush. It was when Yahweh had chosen Moses, a Hebrew raised as an Egyptian prince, to lead the Israelites out of bond age in Egypt. Having escaped the wrath of the Pharaoh to t he Wil- derness of Sinai, Moses was shepherding the flock o f his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, \"and he came t o the mountain of the Elohim in Horeb,\" where a miraculou s sight drew his attention: And an angel of Yahweh appeared unto him in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a thorn-bush. And he looked and, behold— the thorn-bush was burning with fire, but the thorn-bush was not consumed.

Ancient depictions suggest that there was probably, at least in some instances, another distinctive feature by w hich the \"persons\" or \"men\" were recognized as Divine Emissa ries: the special \"goggles\" that they wore, usually as pa rt of their headgear. In this regard the Hittite pictograph tha t expressed the term \"divine\" (Fig. 92a) is instructive, for it represents the \"Eye\" symbols that proliferated in the upper Eu phrates region as idols (Fig. 92b) placed atop altars or pe destals. The latter were clearly emulating depictions of dei ties whose outstanding feature (beside their divine helmet) we re the gog- gled eyes (Fig. 92c). In one instance the statuette, depicting a helmeted and gog- gled godlike \"man\" holding a bent instrument (Fig. 93), may well have represented the way in which the biblical angels had appeared to Abraham and to Lot."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 271 (If, in those instances, the wand-weapon was used t o blind with its beam, the goggles might have been required to pro- tect the \"angel\" from the blinding effects—a possib ility sug- gested by recent developments (by the United States and several other countries) of blinding weapons as one kind of \"nonlethal\" weapons. Called Cobra Laser Rifles, the se weap- ons employ a technique derived from both the surgic al laser and the lasers that guide missiles. The soldiers us ing them must wear protective goggles, lest they be blinded by their own weapons). As a comparison of the above depictions with the he lmeted and goggled Ishtar as a pilot (Fig. 33) suggests, t he attire and weaponry of the Mal'akhim only emulated those of th e Great Gods themselves. The great Enlil could \"raise the b eams that search the heart of all the lands\" from his ziggura t in Nippur, and had there \"eyes that could scan all the lands,\" as well as a \"net\" that could ensnare unauthorized encroach ers.

The one whom scholars refer to as \"the vizier of th e great gods\" was Papsukkal; his epithet-name meant \"Father /Ancestor of the Emissaries.\" He carried out missions on beha lf of Anu, conveying Anu's decisions or advice to the Anunnaki leaders on Earth; as often as not, he displayed considerabl e diplomatic skills. The texts suggest that at times, perhaps wh en Anu was away from Earth, Papsukkal served as an emissary of Ninurta (although, during the battle with Zu, Ninurta emplo yed his main weapon-bearer Sharur as a Divine Emissary). Enid's principal Sukkal or emissary was called Nusk u; he is mentioned in a variety of roles in most of the \" myths\" concerning Enlil. When the Anunnaki toiling in the mines of the Abzu (southeastern Africa) mutinied and surroun ded the house where Enlil stayed, it was Nusku who blocked their way with his weapons; it was also he who acted as a go- between to diffuse the confrontation. In Sumerian t imes he was the emissary who brought the \"word of Ekur\" (En id's ziggurat in Nippur) to those—both gods and people—w hose fate Enlil had decreed. A Hymn to Enlil, the All-Be neficent stated that \"only to his exalted vizier, the chambe rlain (Suk- kal) Nusku, does he (Enlil) the command, the word t hat is in his heart, make known.\" We have mentioned earlie r an instance in which Nusku, standing in the Harran tem ple with Sin, informed the Assyrian king Esarhaddon of the d ivine permission to invade Egypt. Ashurbanipal, in his annals, asserted that it was \" Nusku, the faithful emissary,\" who conveyed the divine dec ision to make him king of Assyria; then, on the gods' comman d, Nusku accompanied Ashurbanipal on a military campai gn to assure victory. Nusku, Ashurbanipal wrote, \"took th e lead of my army and threw down my foes with the divine weap on.\" The assertion brings to mind the reverse incident r eported in the Bible, when the Angel of Yahweh smote the army of Assyria besieging Jerusalem: And it came to pass that night that the Angel of Yahweh"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 273 went out and smote the camp of the Assyrians, an hundred and fourscore and five thousand. And when they (the people of Jerusalem) arose early in the morning, lo and behold: they (the Assyrians) were all dead corpses. (II Kings 19:35) Enki's chief emissary, named Isimud in the Sumerian texts and Usmu in the Akkadian versions, inevitably playe d a role in the sexual shenanigans of his master. In the \"my th\" of Enki and Ninharsag, in which Enki's efforts to obta in a male successor by his half sister were related, Isimud/U smu first acted as a confidant and later as the provider of a variety of fruits with which Enki attempted to cure himself of the paral- ysis with which Ninharsag had afflicted him. When I nanna/ Ishtar came to Eridu to obtain the ME's, it was Isi mud/Usmu who made the arrangements for the visit. Later on, when the sobered-up Enki realized that he was tricked out of important ME's, it was his faithful Sukkal who was ordered to pursue Inanna (who had fled in her \"Boat of Heaven\") to re trieve the ME's. Isimud/Usmu was sometimes referred to in the texts as \"two faced.\" This curious description, it turns out , was a factual one; for in both statues and on cylinder se als he was indeed shown with two faces (Fig. 94). Was he defor med at birth, a genetic aberration, or was there some prof ound reason for depicting him so? While no one seems to know, i t occurs to us that this two-facedness might have reflected this emis- sary's celestial association (see box at the end of this chapter). There was something unusual also about the Sukkal o f Inanna /Ishtar, whose name was Ninshubur. The enigm a was that Ninshubur sometimes appeared to be masculine, at which times the scholars translate his title as \"chamberl ain, vizier\"; and at other times Ninshubur appears to be feminine , at which times she is called \"chambermaid.\" The question is, was Ninshubur bisexual or asexual? An androgynous, a eu nuch, or what? Ninshubur acts as the confidante of Inanna/Ishtar d uring her courtship with Dumuzi, in which role she is tre ated (or assumed to be) female; Thorkild Jacobsen, in The Tr easures"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"274 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS of Darkness, translates her title as \"Handmaiden.\" But in the tale of Inanna/Ishtar's escape with the ME's th at she had tricked out of Enki, Ninshubur is a match for the m ale Isi- mud/Usmu and is called by the goddess \"my warrior w ho fights by my side\"—patently a male role. The diplom atic talents of this emissary were employed to the full when In- anna/Ishtar decided to visit her sister Ereshkigal in the Lower World, in defiance of a prohibition; in this instan ce the great Sumerologist Samuel N. Kramer (Inanna's Descent to the Nether World) referred to Ninshubur as a \"he\"; so d id A. Leo Oppenheim (Mesopotamian Mythology). The enigmatic bisexuality or asexuality of\" Ninshub ur is reflected by her/his contesting with other beings—m ostly hut not only the creations of Enki—that seem to be neit her male nor female as well as neither divine nor human, a k ind of android—automatons in human form. The existence of such enigmatic emissaries, and the ir baf- fling characteristics, come to light in the above-m entioned text that deals with lnanna's unauthorized visit to the domain of her older sister Ereshkigal in the Lower World ( southern Figure 94"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"Figures 95a and 95b Africa). For the trip Inanna put on her attire of a n aeronaut; the seven items listed in the texts match her depic tion on a life-size statue that was unearthed in Mari (Fig. 9 5a, b). As an admission fee to the restricted zone Inanna had to give up her possessions, one at a time, as she passed th rough the domain's seven gates; then, \"naked and bowed low, I nanna entered the throne room.\" No sooner had the two sis ters set eyes on each other than both flew into a rage; and Ereshkigal ordered her Sukkal Namtar to seize Inanna and affli ct her from head to toe. \"Inanna was turned into a corpse, hung from a stake.\" Foreseeing trouble, Inanna had instructed her emiss ary Nin- shubur, before she had left on the risky journey, t o raise an outcry for her if she does not return within three days. Realiz- ing that Inanna was in trouble, Ninshubur rushed fr om god to god to seek help; but none except Enki could cou nteract the death-dealing Namtar. His name meant \"Terminato r;\" the Assyrians and Babylonians nicknamed him Memittu — \"The Killer,\" an Angel of Death. Unlike the deities or hu- mans, \"he has no hands, he has no feet; he drinks n o water, Angels and Other Emissaries 275"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"276 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS eats no food.\" So, to save Inanna, Enki contrived t o fashion similar androids who could go to the \"Land of No Re turn\" and perform their mission safely. In the Sumerian version of the \"myth\" we read that Enki fashioned two clay androids, and activated them by giving one the Food of Life and the other the Water of Lif e. The text calls one Kurgarru and the other Kalaturru, te rms that scholars leave untranslated because of their comple xity; refer- ring to the beings' \"private parts,\" the terms sugg est peculiar sexual organs: literally translated, one whose \"ope ning\" is \"locked,\" and the other whose \"penetrator\" is \"sick .\" Seeing them appear in her throne room, Ereshkigal w on- dered who they were: \"Are you gods? Are you mortals ?\" she asked. \"What is it that you wish?\" They asked f or the lifeless body of Inanna, and getting it, \"upon the corpse they directed the Pulser and the Emitter,\"; then sprinkl ed her body with the Water of Life and gave her the Plant of Li fe, ' 'and Inanna arose.\" Commenting on the description of the two emissaries , A. Leo Oppenheim (Mesopotamian Mythology) saw the main attributes that qualified them to penetrate the dom ain of Ereshkigal and save Inanna as having been (a) that they were neither male nor female, and (b) that they were not created in a womb. Moreover, he found a reference to the ab ility of the gods to create \"robots\" in the Enuma elish, the Babylo- nian version of the Creation Epic, in which the cel estial battle with Tiamat and the wondrous creations that ensued were all attributed to Marduk—including the idea of creating Man. In this reading of the Babylonian text, it was Mard uk, \"while listening to the words of the gods, conceive d the idea of creating a clever device to help them.\" Revealin g his idea to his father Ea/Enki, Marduk said: \"I shall bring into exis- tence a robot; his name shall be 'Man' ... He shall be charged with the service of the gods and thus they will be relieved.\" But \"Ea answered him by making him anoth er proposition, in order to change his mind regarding the |idea] of relieving the gods;\" it was, as we have earlier related, to \"put the mark\" of the gods—their genetic imprint—on \"a being that already exists\" (and thus bringing about Homo sapiens)."},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 277 Figures 96a and 96b In an updated translation of the Sumerian version D iane Wolkstein (Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth) expla ins the nature of the two emissaries as \"creatures neither male nor female.\" A more precise explanation is provided, ho wever, by the Akkadian version, in which Enki/Ea created o nly one being to save Ishtar. As rendered by E.A. Speiser ( Descent of Ishtar to the Nether World) the relevant verses read: Ea in his wise heart conceived an image and created Ashushunamir, a eunuch. The Akkadian term that is loosely translated \"eunuc h\" is assinnu, literally meaning \"penis-vagina\"—a bisexua l being rather than a castrated male (which is what \"eunuch \" means). That this was the true nature of the creatu re or crea- tures that baffled Ereshkigal is evident from actua l depictions of them in the form of statuettes that have been di scovered by archaeologists (Fig. 96a); they appear to posses s both male and female organs and thus, by implication, are of no real sex. Holding a wand or a weapon, these androids belonged to a class of emissaries called Gallu—usually translat ed \"demons\"—whom we have already encountered in the st ory of the death of Dumuzi, when Marduk had sent the \"s her-"},{"pageNumber":282,"pageContent":"278 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS iffs\"—the Gallu—to seize him. In a tale dealing wit h how a son of Enki, Nergal, had come to espouse Ereshkig al, it is related that to safeguard his son on his visit to t he dangerous domain, Enki created fourteen Gallu to accompany an d pro- tect Nergal. In the tale of Inanna/Ishtar's descent to that do- main, it is told that Namtar tried to prevent the e scape of the revived goddess by sending Gallu to block her ascen t. All these texts point out that although the Gallu h ad neither the face nor the body of the divine Sukkals that se rved as emissaries between the gods themselves, they did \"h old a staff in their hands, carried a weapon on their loi ns.\" Not flesh and blood, they were described as beings \"who have no mother, who have no father, neither sister or br other, nor wife or child; they know not food, know not water. They flutter in the skies over Earth like wardens.\" Have these Androids of ancient lore come back in re cent times'/ The question is pertinent because of the way in whi ch the occupants of UFOs have been described by people who claim to have encountered them (or even abducted by them) : of undetermined sex, a plastic skin, conical heads, ov al eyes— humanlike in shape but definitely nonhuman, behavin g like androids. That their depictions (Fig. 96b) by those who claim to have seen them seem so similar to the ancient de pictions of the Gallu is probably no accident. There was yet another class of Divine Emissaries—de - monic beings. Some were in the service of Enki, som e in the service of Enlil. Some were considered the descenda nts of the evildoer Zu, \"evil spirits\" that bode no good, bearers of disease and pestilences; demons who as often as not had birdlike features. In the \"myth\" of Inanna and Enki it is told that wh en Enki ordered Isimud to retrieve the ME's taken by I nanna, he sent along with him a succession of freakish emi ssaries capable of seizing the Boat of Heaven: Uru giants, Lahama monsters, \"sound-piercing Kugalgal, and the Enunun \"sky giants.\" They were all, apparently, the class of cr eatures called Enkum—\"part human, part animal\" according to an interpretation by Margaret Whitney Green (Eridu in Sumerian"},{"pageNumber":283,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 279 Figure 97 Literature)—looking, perhaps, like the fearsome \"gr iffins\" (Fig. 97) that were created to guard temple treasur es. An encounter with a whole troop of such beings is r eported in a text known as The Legend of Naram-Sin; he was the grandson of Sargon I (the founder of the Akkadian d ynasty) and engaged in several military campaigns—on orders of the Enlilite gods, according to his annals. But at leas t in one instance, when the divine oracles discouraged furth er warfare, he took matters into his own hands. It was then tha t a host of \"spirits\" were sent against him, apparently upon a deci- sion or order of Shamash. They were Warriors with bodies of cave birds, a race with raven's faces. The great gods created them; in the plain the gods built them a city. Bewildered by their appearance and nature, Naram-Si n in- structed one of his officers to sneak up on these b eings and prick one of them with his lance. \"If blood comes o ut, they are men like us,\" the king said; \"If blood does not come"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"280 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Figure 98 out, they are demons, devils created by Enlil.\" (Th e officer's report was that he did see blood, whereupon Naram-S in or- dered an attack; none of his soldiers returned aliv e.) Of particular prominence among the part-anthropomor phic, part-birdlike demons was the female Lilith (Fig. 98 ). Her name meant both \"She of the night\" and \"The Howler, \" and she specialized, according to beliefs (or, as s ome prefer, superstitions) that endured for millennia, in entic ing men to their deaths and snatching newborn babies from thei r moth- ers. Although in some post-biblical Jewish legends she was considered to have been the intended bride of Adam (hating men because she had been rejected in favor of Eve), it is more plausible that she was the erstwhile consort o f the evil Zu (or AN.ZU, \"The celestial Zu\"); in the Sumerian tale known as Inanna and the Huluppu Tree, the unusual t ree was home to both the evil, birdlike Anzu and to \"the da rk maid\" Lilith. When the tree was cut down to make furnishi ngs for Inanna and Shamash, Anzu flew away and Lilith \"fled to wild, uninhabited places.\" With the passage of time, and as the gods themselve s be- came more distant and less visible, the \"demons\" we re held"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"Angels and Other Emissaries 281 Figure 99 responsible for every malady, mishap, or misfortune .

On the other hand, in post-biblical times and the H ellenistic Age that followed the conquests of Alexander, Angel s as we think of them nowadays came to dominate popular and reli- gious beliefs. In the Hebrew Bible, only Gabriel an d Michael are mentioned, in the Book of Daniel, out of the se ven arch- angels that were listed in post-biblical times. The angelic tales in the Rook of Enoch and other books of the A pocrypha were just the foundation of a whole array of Angels inhab- iting the various heavens and carrying out divine c ommand- ments—components of a wide-ranging Angelology that has captivated human imagination and yearnings ever sin ce.

Now Nibiru/ Marduk, beholden to the planet that \"begot\" him in the first place—Nudimmud/Ea (the one we call Neptune)—present ed the roving small planet as a \"gift\" to Ea's spouse Damkina: \"To Damkina, his mother, he offered him as a joyous gift; as Usmu he brought him to her in an unknown place, en- trusting to him the chancellorship of the Deep.\" The Sumerian name of this planetary god, Isimud, me ant \"at the tip, at the very end.\" The Akkadian name Us mu meant \"Two Faced.\" This, indeed, is a perfect description of the odd orbit of the outermost planet (excluding Nibiru ). Not only is the orbit unusual in that it is inclined to the common orbital plane of the planets in our Solar System—it is also such that it takes Pluto outward, beyond Neptune, f or the better part of its 248-249 year (Earth-years, that is) orbit- but brings it inside the orbit of Neptune for the r est of the time (see following illustration).

Two years before, in 2042 B . C . by our calculations, Abram returned to his outpost in the Negev; he was now in command of a retinue of cavalrymen (probably fast camel rid ers). He returned in time to deflect an attempt, by a coalit ion of \"Kings of the East,\" to invade the Mediterranean la nds and reach the Spaceport in the Sinai.

To leave no doubt in the mind of Abram that no matt er what this Promise would come to pass, the deity spe aking to Abram revealed his identity to the childless Abram. Until this point we had to take the word of the biblical narra tive that it was Yahweh who had spoken or appeared to Abram. Now, for the first time, the Lord identified himself by name: \"I am Yahweh who had brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land, to inherit it.'' And Abram said: \"My Lord Yahweh, By what shall I know that I shall inherit it?\" Thereupon, to convince the doubting Abram, Yahweh ' 'cut a covenant with Abram that day, to wit: To thy seed have I given this land, from the Brook of Egypt to the Riv er Euphra- tes, the great river.\" The \"cutting of the covenant\" between Yahweh—\"God Supreme, Possessor of Heaven and Earth\"—and the ble ssed Patriarch involved a magical ritual whose likes are not men- tioned anywhere else in the Bible, either before or afterward.

At age eighty-six Abram did obtain a son, by the ha nd- maiden Hagar but not by his wife Sarai (as she was still called, by her Sumerian name). It was thirteen year s later, on the eve of momentous events concerning the affairs of gods and men, that Yahweh \"appeared unto Abram\" and prep ared him for the new era: the change of names from the S umerian Abram and Sarai to the Semitic Abraham and Sarah, a nd the circumcising of all the males as a sign of the ever lasting Covenant. It was in 2024 B.C., by our calculations (based on synchro- nizations with Sumerian and Egyptian chronologies), that Abraham had witnessed the upheavaling of Sodom and Go- morrah following the visit by Yahweh and the two An gels. The destruction, we have shown in The Wars of Gods and Men, was just a sideshow to the main \"event\"—the va poriz- ing with nuclear weapons of the Spaceport in the ce nter of the Sinai peninsula by Ninurta and Nergal in order to deprive Marduk of the space facility. The unintentional res ult of the nuclear holocaust was the blowing of a deathly nucl ear cloud eastward; it caused death (but no destruction) in S umer, bringing to a bitter end that great civilization. Now it was only Ahram/Abraham and his seed—his desc en- dants—that remained to carry on the ancient traditi ons, to \"call on the name of Yahweh,\" to retain a sacred li nk to the beginning of time. To be safe from the nuclear poison, Abraham was ord ered out of the Negev (the arid district bordering on th e Sinai) and to find haven near the Mediterranean coast, in the district of the Philistines. A year after the event Isaac wa s born to"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"The Greatest Theophany 289 Abraham by his wife and half sister Sarah, as Yahwe h had foretold. Thirty-seven years later Sarah died, and the old Pa triarch Abraham was concerned about the succession. Fearing that he would die before seeing his son Isaac married, h e made his head-servant swear \"by Yahweh, the God of Heave n and the God of Earth,\" that on no account would he arra nge for Isaac to marry a local Canaanite. To be sure, he sent him to get for Isaac a bride fr om among the daughters of the relatives who had stayed behind in Harran on the Upper Euphrates. At age forty, Isa ac married his imported bride Rebecca; and she bore him two so ns, the twins Esau and Jacob, twenty years later. The year, by our calculations, was 1963 B . C . Some time later, when the boys grew up, \"there was a famine in the land, other than the first famine tha t occurred in the time of Abraham.\" Isaac thought of emulating his father by going to Egypt, whose agriculture did not depend on rains (but on the annual rise of the Nile's wate rs). But to do that he had to cross the Sinai, and that apparen tly was still dangerous even decades after the nuclear blas t. So \"Yah- weh was seen to him\" and instructed him not to go t o Egypt; instead he was to move in Canaan to a district wher e wells could be dug for water. There Isaac and his family remained for many years, long enough for Esau to marry local ly and for Jacob to go to Harran, where he married Leah an d Rachel. In time Jacob had twelve sons: six by Leah, four by concu- bines, and two by Rachel: Joseph, and the youngest, Benja- min (at whose birth Rachel died). Of them all Josep h was his favorite; and it was therefore that the older b rothers, envi- ous of Joseph, sold him to caravaners going to Egyp t. And thus the Divine Prophecy, of a sojourn of Abraham's descen- dants in a foreign land, began to be fulfilled. Through a series of successful dream-solving, Josep h be- came Overseer of Egypt, charged with the task of pr eparing the land during seven plentiful years for a predict ed seven- year famine thereafter. (It is our belief that in h is ingenuity Joseph used a natural depression to create an artif icial lake, and fill it up with water when the Nile was still r ising high annually; then use the stored water to irrigate the parched"},{"pageNumber":294,"pageContent":"290 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Figure 100 land. The shrunken lake still waters Egypt's most f ertile area, called Elfayum; the canal linking the lake to the N ile is still called The Waterway of Joseph). When the famine became too harsh to bear, Jacob sen t his other sons (except Benjamin) to Egypt to obtain foo d—only to discover, after several dramatic encounters with the Over- seer, that he was none other than their younger bro ther Jo- seph. Telling them that the famine would last anoth er five years, Joseph told them to go back and bring over t o Egypt their father and remaining brother and all the rest of Jacob's household. The year, by our calculations, was 1833 B . C . and the reigning Pharaoh was Amenemhet III of the twelf th dynasty. (A depiction found in a royal tomb from that time s hows a group of men, women, and children with some of th eir livestock arriving in Egypt. The immigrants are dep icted as, and identified in the accompanying inscription, as \"Asiatics\" (Fig. 100); their colorful robes, vividly painted i n the tomb mural, are exactly of the kind of multicolored stri ped robe that Joseph had worn while in Canaan.

It is with the death and burial of Jacob, and the subsequent death and mummification o f Jo- seph, that the Book of Genesis ends. The Book of Exodus picks up the story centuries lat er, \"when there arose a new king over Egypt who knew no t Joseph.\" In the intervening centuries much had happ ened in Egypt. There were civil wars, the capital shifted b ack and forth, the era of the Middle Kingdom passed, the so -called Second Intermediary Period of chaos took place. In 1650 B . C . the New Kingdom began with the seventeenth dynasty, and in 1570 B . C . the renowned eighteenth dynasty ascended the Pharaonic throne in Thebes, in Upper (southern) Egy pt, leav- ing behind its magnificent monuments, temples, and statues in Karnak and Luxor and its splendid tombs hidden i nside the mountains, in the Valley of the Kings. Many of the throne names chosen by the Pharaohs of those new dynasties were epithets by which they asserted their sta- tus as demigods; such was the name Ra-Ms-S (Ramesse s or Ramses in English) which meant \"From the god Ra ema - nated.\" The founder of the seventeenth dynasty call ed him- self Ah-Ms-S (Ah-Mose) (Fig. 102a) meaning \"From th e god"},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"292 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Ah emanated\" (Ah being a name of the Moon god). Thi s new dynasty started the New Kingdom that, we have s ug- gested, had forgotten all about Joseph after the pa ssage of some three centuries. Accordingly, a successor of A hmose called Tehuti-Ms-S (Fig 102b) (Thothmose or Tutmosi s I)— \"From the god Thoth emanated\"—was, we have conclude d, the ruler in whose time the story of Moses and the events of the Exodus began. It was this Pharaoh who, using the might of a unifi ed and invigorated Egypt, sent his armies northward as far as the Upper Euphrates—the region where the relatives of A braham had stayed and flourished. He reigned from 1525 to 1512 B . C . and it was he, we have suggested in The Wars of God s and Men, who feared that the Children of Israel would j oin the warfare in support of their Euphratean relatives. S o he im- posed harsh work on the Israelites, and ordered tha t any new born Israelite male should be killed at birth. It was in 1513 B.C. that a Levite Hebrew and his Le vite wife had a son born to them. And fearing that he wo uld be killed, the mother put him in a waterproofed box of bulrushes of the Nile and placed the box in the river. And it so hap- pened that the stream carried the box to where the Pharaoh's Daughter was bathing; she ended up adopting the boy as a son, \"and she called him Moses\"—Moshe in Hebrew. Th e Bible explains that she called him so for he was \"f rom the waters extracted.\" But, we have no doubt, what the Pharaoh's Daughter did was to give the boy the epithet common in her dynasty with the component Mss (Mose, Mosis), prefi xed, we believe, by a deity's name that the Bible preferred to omit. The chronology suggested by us, placing the birth o f Moses in 1513 B.C., meshes the biblical tale with Egyptia n chronol- ogy and a web of intrigues and power struggles in t he Egyp- tian court. Having been born to Thothmes I by his half sister w ife, their only daughter, called Hatshepsut, indeed bore the exclu- sive title The Pharaoh's Daughter. When Thothmes I died in 1512, the only male heir was a son born by a harem girl.

So when he died, the son—the future Thothmes III—was just a boy, too young to be a Pha- raoh. Hatshepsut was appointed Regent, and after a number of years crowned herself Queen—a female Pharaoh (who e ven ordered that her carved images show her with a fals e beard). As can be imagined, it was in such circumstances th at the envy and enmity between the king's son and the quee n's adopted son grew and intensified. Finally, in 1482 B.C., Hatshepsut died (or was murd ered), and the concubine's son assumed the throne as Thoth mes III. He lost no time in renewing the foreign conquests ( some scholars refer to him as the \"Napoleon of ancient E gypt\") and the oppression of the Israelites. \"And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went o ut unto his brethren and saw their sufferings.\" Killing an Egyptian slavemaster, he gave the king the excuse to order h is death. \"So Moses fled from the Pharaoh, and tarried in the land of the Midianites,\" in the Sinai peninsula. He ended u p mar- rying the daughter of the Midianite priest. \"And it came to pass, after a long time, that the k ing of Egypt died; and the Children of Israel, bemoaning t heir bond- age, cried out unto the Elohim. And Elohim heard th eir la- ments, and Elohim recalled his covenant with Abraha m and with Isaac and with Jacob; and Elohim beheld the Ch ildren of Israel, and Elohim found out.\" Almost four hundred years had passed since the Lord had last spoken to Jacob \"in a nighttime vision,\" until he has now come to take a look at the Children of Jacob/Is rael crying out of their bondage. That the Elohim intend ed here was Yahweh becomes clear in the subsequent narrativ e. Where was He during those long four centuries? The Bible does not say; but it is a question to be pondered. Be that as it may, the time was propitious for dras tic action. As the biblical narrative makes clear, this chain o f new devel- opments was triggered by the death of the Pharaoh \" after a long time\" of reign.

It was then that Yahweh called out to Moses from in side the Burning Bush, t e l l i n g him that He had decided t o \"come down and save\" the Israelites from their bondage in Egypt and lead them back to the Promised Land, and tellin g Moses that he was selected to be the God's ambassador to gain this freedom from the Pharaoh and to lead the Israelites on their Exodus from Egypt. It happened, we are told in Exodus chapter 3, when Moses was shepherding the flock of his father in law, \"le ading the flock beyond the desert, and he came to the Mount o f the Elohim, in Horeb,\" and saw there the thornbush burn ing without being consumed; so he went closer to take a look at the incredible sight. The biblical narrative refers to the \"Mount of the Elohim\" as though it was a well-known landmark; the unusual charac- ter of the event was not that Moses had led his flo ck there, nor that there were bushes there. The exceptional a spect was that the bush was burning without being consumed! It was only the first of a series of amazing magica l acts and miracles that the Lord had to employ in order t o convince Moses, the Israelites, and the Pharaoh of the authe nticity of the mission and the divine determination motivating it. To that purpose Yahwch empowered Moses with three magi cal acts: his staff could turn into a snake, and back i nto a staff; his hand could be made leprous and again healthy; a nd he could pour some Nile water on the ground and the gr ound would stay dry. \"The people who had sought thy deat h are all dead,\" Yahweh told Moses; fear no more; face th e new Pharaoh and perform the magics that I granted thee, and tell him that the Israelites must be let go to be free t o worship their God in the desert. As an assistant, Yahweh ap pointed Aaron, the brother of Moses, to accompany him. In the first encounter with the Pharaoh, the king w as not responsive. \"Who is this Yahweh whom I should heed to let the Israelites go?\" he said, \"I know not Yahweh and the Israelites I will not let go.\" Instead of releasing the Israelites. the Pharaoh doubled and trebled their quotas of bri ckmaking.

Ten in all, they range d from the turning of the Nile's water red as blood for a week, through the swarming of the river and lakes with fr ogs; the afflicting of the people with lice and the cattle w ith pesti- lences; devastation by hailstones and brimstones an d locusts; and a darkness that lasted three days. And when all that did not attain the Israelites' freedom, when all the \"w onders of Yahweh\" failed, the last and decisive blow came: Al l the firstborn of Egypt, be it men or cattle, were stric ken to death \"as Yahweh passed through the land of Egypt.\" But t he Israelite homes, marked with blood on their doorpos ts, were \"passed over\" and spared. That very same night, the Pharaoh let them go out of Egypt; and therefore is the even t celebrated to this very day by the Jewish people as the holida y of the Passover. It happened on the night of the fourteent h day of the month Nissan, when Moses was eighty years old—i n 1433 B.C. by our calculations. The Exodus from Egypt was on—but it was not yet the end of the troubles with the Pharaoh. As the Israel ites reached the edge of the desert, where the chain of lakes fo rmed a watery barrier beyond the Egyptian forts, the Phara oh con- cluded that the escapees were trapped and sent his fast chari- ots to recapture them. It was then that Yahweh sent an Angel, \"the angel of the Elohim who had gone in front of t he Israe- lite host,\" to station himself and a pillar of dark clouds be- tween the Israelites and the pursuing Egyptians, to separate the camps. And during that night \"Yahweh drove back the sea with a strong east wind, and dried up the sea, and the waters were divided, and the Children of Israel wen t into the sea upon the dried ground.\" By early morning the dazed Egyptians tried to follo w the Israelites through the parted waters; but no sooner had they tried that, than the wall of water engulfed them an d they perished.

Water and food shortages, miraculously averted, and a war with an unexpected Amalek- ite enemy, still were in store for them. Finally, \" in the third month,\" they arrived in the Wilderness of Sinai \"an d en- camped opposite the Mount.\" They had arrived at their predetermined destination : the \"Mountain of the Elohim.\" The greatest Theophany ev er was about to begin. There were preparations and stages in that memorabl e and unique Divine Encounter, and a price to pay by its chosen witnesses. It began with \"Moses going up toward the Elohim,\" upon the Mount, as \"Yahweh called out to h im from the Mount,\" to hear the precondition for the T heophany and its consequences. Moses was told to repeat to t he Chil- dren of Israel the Lord's exact words: If you will listen to me and keep my covenant, then— out of all the nations— a treasured possession to me you shall be, for the whole Earth is mine; You shall be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation. Earlier, when Moses was given his embassy at this v ery same mount, Yahweh stated his intention to \"adopt t he children of Israel as his people,\" and in turn \"to be an Elo him unto them.\" Now the Lord spelled out the \"deal\" involved in the Theophany. With the Covenant came commandments and laws and restrictions; they were the price to be paid fo r qualifying for the Theophany—a unique event by which the Israe lites will become a Treasured People, consecrated unto God. \"And Moses came and summoned the elders of the peop le, and laid before them all these words as Yahweh had com- manded. And all the people answered, all together, saying:"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"The Greatest Theophany 297 'All that Yahweh hath spoken we will do.' And Moses brought the people's words unto Yahweh.\" Having received this acceptance, \"Yahweh said unto Moses: Behold, I shall be coming unto thee in a thi ck cloud, enabling the people to hear when I speak with thee, so that in thee too they shall have faith.\" And the Lord or dered Moses to have the people consecrate themselves and be ready for three days hence, informing them that \"on the t hird day shall Yahweh come down upon Mount Sinai, in full si ght of all the people.\" The landing, Yahweh indicated to Moses, would creat e a danger for anyone coming too near. \"Thou shall set bounds round about\" the Mount, Moses was told, to keep the people at a distance, telling them to dare not try to go u p or even touch the Mount's edge, \"for whosoever toucheth it shall surely be put to death.\" As these instructions were followed, \"it was on the third day, when it was morning,\" that the promised Landin g of Yahweh upon the Mount of Elohim began. It was a fie ry descent and a noisy one: \"There were thundering sou nds and flashes of lightning, and a dense cloud [was] upon the Mount, and a Shofar sound, exceedingly strong; and all the people in the encampment were terrified.\" As the descent of the Lord Yahweh began, \"Moses brought forth the people from the encampment toward the Elohim, and they stationed themselves at the foot o f the Mount,\" at the boundary that Moses had marked out a ll around the Mount. And Mount Sinai was completely engulfed by smoke, for Yahweh had descended upon it in a fire. And the smoke thereof rose up like that of a furnac e, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And the sound of the Shofar continued to wax louder ; As Moses spoke, the Elohim answered him in a loud voice.

Thus did Yahweh, in full view of all the people—all 600,000 of them—\"descend upon Mount Sinai, on the t op of it; and Yahweh called Moses up to the top of the Mount, and Moses went up.\" It was then, from atop the mount, from within the t hick cloud, that \"Elohim spoke the following words,\" pro - nouncing the Ten Commandments—the essentials of the He- brew Faith, the guidelines for social justice and h uman morality; a summary of the Covenant between Man and God, all of the Divine Teachings succinctly expressed. The first three Commandments established monotheism , proclaimed Yahweh as the Elohim of Israel, the sole God, and prohibited the making of idols and their worshi p: I I am Yahweh thy Elohim who hath brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. II Thou shalt have no other Elohim beside me; thou shalt not make for thyself any sculptured imag e of likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth. Thou shalt not bow to them nor worship them . . . III Thou shalt not utter the name of Yahweh thy Elo him in vain. Next came a Commandment intended to express the san c- tity of the People of Israel and their subjection t o a higher standard of daily life, by setting aside one day a week to be the Sabbath—a day devoted to contemplation and rest , applying equally to all people, to humans as well a s to their livestock: IV Remember to keep the day of the Sabbath and sanc tify it."},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"The Greatest Theophany 299 Six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of Yahweh, thy Elohim: On it thou shalt not do any work— neither thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter; neithe r thy servant nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle; As also the stranger who is within thy gates. The fifth affirmative Commandment established the f amily as the human unit, headed by the patriarch and the matriarch: V Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be prolonged upon the land which Yahweh thy Elohim giveth thee. And then came the five No's that established the mo ral and social code between Man and Man rather than, as at the beginning, between Man and God: VI Thou shalt not murder. VII Thou shalt not commit adultery. VIII Thou shalt not steal IX Thou shall not bear false witness against thy ne ighbor.

Indeed, we r ead that as \"all the people perceived the thundering an d flashes and the Shofar's sound and the mountain engulfed in smoke, they were seized with fear and moved away and stood at a distance. And they said unto Moses: 'Speak thou wit h us and we will listen, but let not the Elohim himself spea k to us, lest we die'.\" And having asked Moses to be the con veyor of the divine words rather than hearing them direct ly, \"the people stood farther away; and Moses went toward th e thick fog where the Elohim was,\" for the Lord had summone d him: And Yahweh said unto Moses: Come up to me, on the Mount, and remain there; And I will give thee the stone tablets with the law and the commandment which I have written, to be taught to them. This (in Exodus chapter 24) is the first mention of the Tablets of the Law and the assertion that they were inscribed by Yahweh himself. This is restated in chapter 31, where the number of Tablets is stated to be two, \"made of sto ne, in- scribed by the finger of Elohim\"; and again in chap ter 32: \"Tablets inscribed on both of their sides—on the on e side and on the other side were they inscribed; and the Tablets were the craftwork of Elohim and the writing was th e script of Elohim, engraved upon the Tablets.\" (This is rea sserted in Deuteronomy).

The Breas tplate was also to hold in place—precisely against the priest' s heart— the Urim and Tumim. Though the exact meaning of the terms has eluded scholars, it is clear from other biblica l references (e.g. Numbers 27:21) that they served as an oracula r panel for obtaining a Yes or No answer from the Lord in r esponse to a question. The inquiring person's question was put before the Lord by the priest, \"to ask for the Decision of the Urim before Yahweh, and in accordance thereof to act.\" W hen King Saul (I Samuel 28:6) sought Yahweh's guidance whether to engage in war with the Philistines, he \" inquired of Yahweh in dreams, by the Urim, and through proph ets.\" While Moses was in the presence of the Lord, back i n the encampment his long absence was interpreted as bad news, and his failure to show up after several weeks as a n indication that he might have perished by seeing God; \"for is there any any flesh\"—any mortal human—\"who hath heard the voi ce of a living Elohim speaking from inside the fire, a nd stayed alive?\" It was thus that \"the people, seeing that M oses was not coming down from the Mount, gathered by Aaron a nd said to him: 'Come, make for us an Elohim who could lead us, for this man Moses, who hath brought us out of Egypt— we know not what is become of him.\" So Aaron, seeki ng to invoke Yahweh, built an altar to Yahweh and placed before it the sculpture of a calf inlaid with gold. Alerted by Yahweh, \"Moses turned and went down from the Mount, with the two Tablets of the Testimony in his hand.\" And when he neared the camp and saw the gold en calf, Moses was furious \"and he threw the tablets o ut of his hand, and broke them at the foot of the Mount; and he took the calf which they had made and burnt it by fire, and [its gold] he ground into a powder, and strewed the dust upon the waters.\" Seeking out the instigators of the abo mination and having them put to the sword, Moses beseeched t he Lord not to abandon the Children of Israel.

But then a miracle happened; Yahweh's compassion be - came manifest: And it came to pass, when Moses was entering the tent, that the pillared cloud descended, and stood at the entrance of the tent, and a voice spoke to Moses. And when the people, all of them, saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent, the whole people rose up and prostrated themselves, each at his tent's entrance. And Yahweh spoke unto Moses face to face, as a man would speak unto his friend. When the Lord spoke to Moses from inside the Burnin g Bush, \"Moses covered his face, for he was afraid to look at the Elohim.'' The Elders and nobles who had accompa nied Moses up the Mount, went up only halfway and were e nabled to see only the Lord's footrest—and even then it wa s a won- der that they were not smitten. At the end of the f orty years of wandering, as the Israelites were ready to enter Canaan, Moses in his testamental review of the Exodus and t he great Theophany made a point of stressing that \"on the da y Yah-"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"304 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS weh hath spoken unto you in Horeb, out of the midst of the fire, ye saw no visage of any kind:\" Ye came near and stood at the foot of the Mount, and the Mount was engulfed with fire reaching unto the midst of heaven, and [there was] a dark cloud and thick fog. And Yahweh spoke unto you from inside the fire; ye heard the sound of the words, but the likeness of a visage ye saw not— only a voice was heard. (Deuteronomy 4:11-15) This, obviously, was an essential element in the do 's and don'ts of close encounters with Yahweh. But now tha t the relenting God was talking to Moses \"face to face\"—b ut still from within the cloud-pillar—Moses seized the momen t to seek a reaffirmation of his role as the leader chos en by the Lord. \"Show me thy face!\" he begged of the Lord. Answering enigmatically, Yahweh said: \"Thou canst n ot see my face, for no Man can see Me and live.\" So Moses pleaded again: \"Please, show me thy glory! \" And Yahweh said: \"Behold, there is a place by me; g o and stand there upon the rock. And when my glory sh all pass by there, I will put thee in the cleft of the rock, and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by; and I will then remove my hand, and you shall see my back; but my face shall not be seen.\" The Hebrew word that has been rendered \"glory\" in E n- glish translations, in all the above quoted instanc es, is Kabod; it stems from the root KBD whose seminal meaning is \"weighty, heavy.\" Literally then, Kabod would mean \"the heaviness, the weighty thing.\" That a \"thing,\" a ph ysical object and not an abstract \"glory\" is meant when ap plied to Yahweh is clear from its first mention in the Bible , when the Israelites \"beheld the Kabod of Yahweh,\" enveloped by the ubiquitous cloud, after the Lord supplied them mira culously with Manna as their daily food.

In all instances, called the \"Kabod of Yahweh,\" it was something concrete that t he people could see—but always engulfed by a cloud, as though within a dark fog. The term is repeatedly employed by the Prophet Ezek iel in his descriptions of the Divine Chariot (where th e footstool is described almost identically as in the verses re garding what the Elders of Israel had seen halfway up Mount Sina i). The Chariot, Ezekiel reported, was engulfed with a brig ht radi- ance; this, he said, was \"the appearance of the Kab od of Yahweh.\" On his first prophetic mission to the exil es dwell- ing at the River Khabur, he was addressed by the Lo rd in a valley where \"the Kabod of Yahweh was stationed, a Kabod like the one seen before.\" When he was carried alof t and taken to see Jerusalem \"in divine visions,\" he agai n \"saw the Kabod of the God of Israel, as the one I had se en in the valley.\" And when the envisioned visit was complete d, the \"Kabod of Yahweh\" stationed itself upon the Cherubi m, and the Cherubim raised their wings and \"lifted off the earth,\" carrying the Kabod aloft. The Kabod, Ezekiel wrote (10:4) had a luminosity th at shone through the cloud that shrouded it, a kind of a radiance. This detail provides an insight into a facet of a C lose Encoun- ter by Moses with the Lord Yahweh and his Kabod. It was after Yahweh had relented of his anger, and told Mo ses to fashion two new stone tablets, similar to the first two tablets that Moses had broken, and come up again to the top of Mount Sinai to receive again the Ten Commandments a nd other ordinances. This time, however, the words wer e dictated to Moses by the Lord.

And Aaron and all of the Children of Israel, seeing Moses, saw that the skin of his face radiate d; and they were afraid to come nigh unto him. So \"Moses put a covering-mask upon his face. But wh en Moses was coming before Yahweh to speak with him, h e would take off the covering mask until he left and came out to speak to the Children of Israel whatever he was instructed; but when the Children of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of his face was radiating, Moses woul d put back the covering-mask, until the next time that he woul d go to speak\" to the Lord. It is evident from this that Moses, when he had bee n in the proximity of the Kahod, was subjected to some k ind of radiation that affected his skin. What exactly the source mate- rial of that radiation was we do not know, but we d o know that the Anunnaki could (and did) employ radiation for a variety of purposes. We read of that in the tale of Inanna 's Descent to the Nether World, when she was revived w ith a pulsating radiance (perhaps not unlike that depicte d on a clay plaque from Mesopotamia, in which the patient, prot ected by a mask, is treated with radiation—Fig. 103).

In this regard it will be helpful to trace the Akka dian and Sumerian roots from which the Hebrew term had deriv ed. While the Akkadian Kabbuttu meant \"heavy, weighty,\" the simil ar-sounding Kabdu (paralleling the Hebrew Kabod) meant \"Wing-ho lder\" - something to which wings are attached, or perhaps i nto which wings can retract.

Indeed it is all written in the Book of Jashar: The Sun stood still in the midst of the skies and it hastened not to go down, about a whole day. What could have caused the Earth's rotation to stop , so that the Sun rising in the east and the Moon settin g in the west seemed to stand still, for the better part (\"a bout a whole\") of a day (of twenty-four hours)? To those w ho take the Bible on faith, it is just one more divine inte rvention in behalf of God's Chosen People. At the other extreme there are those who discount the whole tale as mere ficti on, a myth. In between are those who, as for the ten plagues th at befell Egypt and the parting of the waters of the Sea of R eeds (associating the events with the volcanic explosion on the Mediterranean island of Thera/Santorini), seek a na tural phe- nomenon or calamity as the cause. Some have suggest ed an extraordinarily long eclipse; but the Bible states that the Sun was seen, and there was daylight for a prolonged da ytime, not that the Sun was obscured. Because the long day began with \"great stones\" falling from the skies, some ha ve sug- gested as an explanation the close passage of a lar ge comet (Immanuel Velikovsky, in Worlds of Collision, postu lated that such a comet was caught into a solar orbit and beca me the planet Venus).

But when, in July 1994 , comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 broke up into twenty-one pie ces that impacted Jupiter in quick succession—in full v iew of observers from Earth—the Mesopotamian texts assume an impressive reality. Had a comet broken up into seven pieces and caused havoc- in our celestial vicinity, impacting Earth and brea king its rotation? Or, as Alfred Jeremias (The Old Testament in the Light of the Ancient Near East), reproducing what h e called \"an important astral-mythological text,\" treated it as possibly an unusual alignment of seven planets that, with th e resulting immense gravitational pull, affected the Sun and Mo on from the perspective of Earth—making the Sun and Moon ap pear to stand still because in reality it was the Earth whose rotation was temporarily halted. Whatever the explanation, there is corroboration fo r the occurrence itself from the other side of the world. In both Mesoamerica and South America, \"legends\"—collective memories—have persisted of a long night of about tw enty hours during which the Sun failed to rise. Our inve stigations (fully reported in The Lost Realms) concluded that this long night occurred in the Americas circa 1400 B.C.—the same time when me Sun did not set in Canaan for a simila r period.

He that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male througho ut your generations . . . This shall be a covenant in your flesh, an everlasting covenant\" (Genesis 17:11-14). Failure to do so would have excluded the offender from the people of Israel. Circumcision was thus intended to serve as a unique \"sign in the flesh\" distinguishing the descendants of Abr aham from their neighbors. Some researchers believe that circum- cision was practiced among royalty in Egypt, as evi denced by an ancient illustration (see p. 312)—though the depiction might be that of a puberty rite rather than a relig ious circumcision. With or without a precedent, what was the symbolism implied by the requirement to Mul (translated \"circ umcise\") the Hebrew males? No one really knows. Unexplained, too, has been the origin of the term; linguists seeking parallels in Akkadian or later Semitic languages have come up empty-handed. We suggest that the answer to the puzzle lies in Ab raham's Sumerian origin. Searching for the meaning there, t he term assumes a striking significance, for MUL was the Su merian term for \"celestial body,\" a star or a planet!

It also revealed a key aspect of the Deity—that of an Unseen God. \"No one can see my face and live,\" He stated; and even approaching too closely to where the Kabod res ted was a peril. Yet if He were to be followed and worshiped, how co uld He be sought, found, and heard? How would Divine En coun- ters with Yahweh take place? The immediate answer, in the Wilderness of Sinai, w as the Tabernacle, the portable Mishkan (literally: Reside nce) with its Tent of Appointment. On the first day of the first month of the second y ear of the Exodus the Tabernacle was completed in accordan ce with the most detailed and exact specification dictated by the Lord to Moses, including the Tent of Appointment with it s Holy of Holies; therein, separated from the other areas by a heavy screen, was placed the Ark of the Covenant that con tained the two Tablets and above which the two golden Cher ubim touched their wings. There, where the wings touched , was the Dvir—literally, the Speaker—by which Yahweh con - versed with Moses. And when Moses had completed \"all this work, as Yah - weh had commanded,\" on the prescribed day, a thick cloud landed and engulfed the Tent of Appointment. \"The C loud 313"},{"pageNumber":318,"pageContent":"314 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS of Yahweh,\" the last verse of the Book of Exodus st ates, \"was upon the Residence by day and a fire was in it by night, before the very eyes of the whole house of I srael, throughout their journeys.\" It was only when the di vine cloud lifted that they moved on; but when the cloud did n ot rise off the Residence, they stayed put where encamped u ntil the cloud would rise. It was during those resting periods (as the first v erse in the next book of the Pentateuch, Leviticus, states) that \"Yah- weh called Moses, and spoke to him from inside the Tent of Appointment.\" The instructions covered the appointm ent of the House of Aaron as the priestly line, and the pr ecise details of the priestly clothing, consecration, and the rit uals of the sacred service of Yahweh. Even then, in the immediate aftermath of the landin g on the Mount and within the consecrated confines of th e Taber- nacle, it was from inside the thick cloud of a fogl ike darkness, from behind the screened-off portion, from between the Cher- ubim, that Yahweh's voice could be heard—the words of the Unseen God. With all those precautions and obscurin g veil- ings, even the High Priest had to raise an addition al opaque haze by burning a specific combination of incenses before he could approach the screen that veiled the Ark of th e Cove- nant; and when two sons of Aaron burned the wrong i ncense, creating a \"strange fire,\" a beam of fire \"emanatin g from Yahweh\" struck them dead. It was during those resting periods that Moses was in- structed regarding a long list of other rules and r egulations— for all manner of sacrifices and the paying of homa ge to the Lord by the common people, who were all to be consi dered \"a nation of priests\"; for the proper relations bet ween mem- bers of the family and between one person and anoth er, pre- scribing equal treatment of the citizen, the serf, and the strangers. There were instructions for what foods w ere proper or improper, and in the diagnosing and treatment of various ailments. Throughout and repeatedly, there were str ict prohi- bitions of the customs of \"other nations\" that were associ- ated with the worship of \"other gods\"—such as the s having of the head or beards, the incising of tattoos, or the sacrificing of children as burnt offerings. Forbidden was the \" turning to"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"Prophets of an Unseen God 315 conjurers and seers,\" and emphatically prohibited w as the \"making of idols and graven images, and the erectio n of statues, or of a carved stone to bow upon it.\" \"By these shall the Children of Israel be distingui shed from the others—a holy nation, consecrated unto Yah weh,\" Moses was told. As the ensuing biblical books of Judges, Samuel, Ki ngs, and Prophets reveal, it was the last prohibition th at was the most difficult to maintain. For all around them the people could see the gods they were worshiping—sometimes i n fact, otherwise (and most of the time) through their grav en images. But Yahweh had asserted that no one could see his f ace and live, and now the Israelites were required to obser ve strictly a myriad of commandments and keep faith with a sole deity that could not even be represented by its statue—to worship an Unseen God! That it was a total departure from the practices ev erywhere else was readily admitted by Yahweh himself. \"After the customs of the Land of Egypt, wherein ye have dwelt , and after the customs of the Land of Canaan whither I a m bring- ing you, ye shalt not do, and their precepts ye sha ll not follow,\" Yahweh decreed; and He knew well what he w as talking about. Egypt, whence the Children of Israel had come out—a s ancient depictions and archaeological finds amply a ttest—was awash with images and statues of the gods of Egypt. Ptah, the patriarch of the pantheon (whom we have identif ied with Enki), Ra his son, head of the pantheon (whom we ha ve identified with Marduk), and their offspring who ha d reigned over Egypt before the Pharaohs and who were worship ed thereafter, sometimes appeared to the kings in pers on in vari- ous Divine Encounters, some other times (and more f re- quently so) were represented by their images (Fig. 105). The more distant the gods became over time, the more di d king and people turn to priests and magicians, seers and diviners to obtain and interpret the divine will.

And, one must assume, in instances when a god had a human spouse or during divine encounters of the Sacred Ma rriage kind, the god or goddess was not unseen. (That, too, increased the Israelites' consternation , for no- where throughout the Hebrew Bible is there mention of Yah- weh as having a spouse, be it divine or human. This , biblical scholars believe, was why in spite of all admonitio ns the Israelites digressed toward veneration of Asherah, the princi- pal goddess of the Canaanite pantheon). Even in Sumer, where the presence of the Anunnaki g ods in their ziggurats was an accepted fact, the Divine Word was conveyed to the people through the intermediary of oracle priests. Indeed, the name Terah of Abraham's father suggests that he was a Tirhu, an oracle priest; and the fami ly's clan designation, Ibri (\"Hebrew\"), we believe, indicates that the family stemmed from Nippur (Enid's cult center), wh ose Sumerian name was NI.IBRU—\"Beautiful dwelling place of crossing.\" After the demise of Sumer and the rise o f Babylon DIVINE ENCOUNTERS"},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"Prophets of an Unseen God 319 (with Marduk as head of the pantheon) and later of Assyria (with Ashur as head of the pantheon), a complex ple thora of oracle and omen priests, astrologers, dream inte rpreters, diviners, seers, conjurers, voayers and fortune-tel lers filled temples, palaces, and humbler abodes—all claiming t o be expert in conveying the Divine Word or being able t o guess the Divine Will—\"fortune\"—from the examination of a ni- mal livers, or how oil spreads on water, or celesti al conjunctions. In this respect, too, the Israelites were required to act dif- ferently. \"Ye shall not practice divination or soot hsaying,\" was the commandment in Leviticus 19:26. \"Seek neith er seers of spirits nor fortune tellers,\" admonished L eviticus 19:31. In direct contrast to the inclusion of such \"profession- als\" within the ranks of the priests of other natio ns in antiq- uity, the Israelite priests and the Levites selecte d to serve in the temple were qualified to \"stand before Yahweh\" by (among other restrictions) never becoming \"a magici an, a diviner, a wizard or an enchanter, nor one who is a charmer or a seer of spirits, a fortune teller, or one who conjures up the dead; for all of them are an abomination to Yah weh—it is because of those abominations that Yahweh thy El ohim doth drive them out before thee.\" (Deuteronomy 18:1 0-12). Practices that were—certainly by the time of the Ex odus, in the fifteenth century B . C .—part and parcel of the religious practices throughout the ancient world and the wors hip of \"other gods,\" were thus strictly forbidden by Yahwe h in the religion and worship of Israel. How then could the Children of Israel, once in their Promised Land, receive the Divine Word and know the Divine Will? The answers were given by Yahweh himself. First, there will be the Angels, the Divine Emissar ies, who would convey the Lord's will and guidance and act i n His behalf. \"I am sending a Mal'akh to be in front of t hee, to guard thee on the way to bring thee unto the place which I have prepared,\" the Lord said to the Children of Is rael through Moses; \"beware of him and obey him, be not rebel- lious against him, for he will not forgive your tra nsgressions; my Shem is in him\" (Exodus 23:20-21).

As reported in Numbers chapter 12. And Miriam and Aaron said: \"Hath Yahweh spoken only through Moses? Hath he not also spoken through us?\" And Yahweh heard it. Then, suddenly, Yahweh spoke unto Moses and Aaron and Miriam, saying: \"Come out ye three unto the Tent of Appointment.\" And the three of them came forth. And Yahweh descended in a pillar of cloud, coming to rest at the door of the Tent. And He called Aaron and Miriam, and the two of them stepped forward. Thus getting their attention, and bringing them as close as possible to the \"column of cloud\" that had descende d and positioned itself in front of the Tent, Yahweh said to them: \"Hear now my words: If there be a prophet of Yahweh among you, in a vision will I make myself known to him, in a dream will I speak to him. Not so is it with my servant Moses, faithful in all mine house.

So there it was, clearly stated: It will be through the Proph- ets of Yahweh, appearing to them in a vision or in a dream, that the Lord will communicate with the people. The usual concept of a \"prophet\" is that of one who engages in prophecies—predictions of the future (in this in- stance under divine guidance or inspiration). But t he diction- ary correctly defines \"prophet\" as \"a person who sp eaks for God\" in divine matters, or just \"a spokesman for so me cause, group or government.\" The prediction aspect is pres- ent or assumed; but the key function is that of a s pokesman. And indeed, that is what the Hebrew term, Nabih, me ans: a spokesman. A \"Nabih of Yahweh,\" commonly translated (and so quoted above) \"a prophet of Yahweh,\" litera lly meant \"a spokesman of Yahweh,\" someone (as explaine d in Numbers chapter 11) \"upon whom the spirit of God wa s bestowed,\" qualifying him (or her!) to be a Nabih, a spokes- person for the Lord. The term appears for the first time in the Bible in chapter 20 of Genesis, which deals with the transgression o f Abime- lech, the Philistine king of Gerar, who was about t o take Sarah into his harem not knowing that she was marri ed to Abraham. \"And Elohim came unto Abimclech in a night time dream\" to warn him off. When Abimelech pleaded inno - cence, the Lord told him to return Sarah unmolested to her husband, and ask him to pray for forgiveness. \"A Na bih he is,\" the Lord said of Abraham, \"and pray he will fo r thee.\" Next the term is used (in Exodus chapter 6) in its rudimen- tary sense. When the mission to the Pharaoh was imp osed on Moses, he complained that his was a \"halting spe aking,\" which would not be heeded by the Pharaoh. So Yahweh said to him: \"Behold, as an Elohim I will make thee befo re Pha- raoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy Nabih\"—you r spokesman.

And Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him; And bestowed from the spirit that was upon him on the seventy elders; And when the spirit rested upon them, they became Nabih 's (spokesmen)— then, but not thereafter. But two of the elders, the narrative reports, conti nued to be under the spell of the Divine Spirit, and were a cting as Nabih's in the encampment. It was expected that the y would be punished; but Moses saw it differently: \"I wish the whole people would be Nabihs, that Yahweh would bestow Hi s spirit upon them,\" he said to his faithful servant Joshua. The matter of the Nabih as a true spokesman for Yah weh must have needed further elucidation—witness the ad ditional statements in Deuteronomy. Unlike other peoples who \"listen to diviners and magicians,\" the Lord said, to the p eople of Israel He will provide a Nabih, one from their own brethren who \"My words shall be in his mouth, who shall spea k to them as I will command.\" Recognizing that some migh t lay claim to be speaking for God without it being so, Y ahweh warned that such a false prophet shall surely die. But how would the people know the difference? \"If there ari se in the midst of thee a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, an d he giveth thee a sign or a wonder,\" but it was only to induce you to \"follow other Elohim, unknown to thee, and w orship them—do not hearken to the words of such a Nabih,'' Yah- weh explained through Moses.

Before dying, the Lord made him go up Mount Nebo that was on the eastern side of the Jordan facing Jericho, to s ee from there the Promised Land. Significantly or ironically, the mount chosen for t hat final act. Mount Nebo, was named after Nabu, the son of M arduk. Il Nabium, the \"God who is a spokesman,\" Babylonian in- scriptions called him; for as historical records sh ow, it was he who, while his father Marduk was in exile, roame d the lands bordering on the Mediterranean, converting th e people to the worship of Marduk in preparation for the sei zing of the supremacy by Marduk at the time of Abraham. The function, the mission of the Prophets of Yahweh winds its way through the era of the Judges, finds expres sion in the biblical books of Samuel and Kings, and reaches its high ground, moral and religious message and its prophet ic visions for humanity in the books of the Prophets. Guidance , rage, and solace; teaching, reprimanding, and reassuring, the words and symbolic deeds of these \"spokesmen\" of Yahweh g radu- ally fashion, as the years and the events march by, an image of Yahweh and His role in the past and in the futur e of Earth and its inhabitants. \"It was after the death of Moses the servant of Yah weh, that Yahweh spoke unto Joshua the son of Nun, the m inister of Moses, saying: Moses my servant died; now theref ore arise and cross the Jordan, thou and all this people, unt o the land which I do give to them, the Children of Israel ... as I was with Moses so will I be with thee; I will not fail thee nor"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"324 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS forsake thee ... Only be thou strong and steadfast in observ- ing to act according to all the teachings which Mos es my servant commanded thee—turn not to the right or to the left.\" Thus begins the Book of Joshua, with a reiteration of the Divine Promise on the one hand and of the required absolute adherence to Yahweh's commandments on the other han d. And right away Joshua, recognizing that the former depended on the latter, realized that it would be the latter that would be the problem. As in the time of Moses, divine assistance in the f orm of miracles was provided the new leader to make the do uble point: Though unseen, Yahweh was omnipresent as wel l as omnipotent. The very first obstacle facing the Isra elites who had journeyed up the east side of the Jordan was ho w to cross the river westward; the time was soon after t he rainy season and the river's waters were high and overflo wing. Reassuring the people that \"Yahweh will show you wo n- ders,\" he told them to sanctify themselves and be r eady for the crossing, for Yahweh had directed him to have t he priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant step into the rive r; and lo and behold, the moment the priests' feet touched th e waters, the Jordan's waters flowing down from the north fro ze and were held back as a wall, and the Israelites crosse d over on the river's dried bed. And when the priests carryin g the Ark crossed over as well, the piled-up waters collapsed and the river was filled again with water. \"By this shall ye know that a living God is among y ou,\" Joshua announced—proof that though unseen, He is pr esent, He is powerful, He can perform miracles. The miracl es in- deed did not cease; the one of the Jordan's crossin g was soon followed by the appearance of the Angel of Yahweh w ith the instructions for the toppling of the walls of Jeric ho, and the use of Joshua's lance the way the staff of Moses wa s held— this time for the miraculous defeat of the mountain fortress of Ai. Next came the miraculous defeat of an allian ce of Canaanite kings in the Valley of Ajalon, when the s un stood still and did not set for some twenty hours. \"And it came to pass after a long time, after Yahwe h had given rest unto Israel from all their surrounding e nemies, that Joshua waxed old and aged\"; thus begins the end of the"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"Prophets of an Unseen God 325 Book of Joshua and the record of the events of the conquest and settlement of Canaan under his leadership. It e nds, how- ever, as it began: with the need to reaffirm the ex istence and presence of Yahweh; for, as the Bible explains, not only Joshua but all the elders who could recall the Exod us and the Lord's miracles were passing from the scene. So Joshua assembled the tribal leaders at Shechem, to re- view before them the history of the Hebrews from th eir an- cestral beginnings until the present. On the other side of the Euphrates River did your ancestors live, he said—Te rah and his sons Abraham and Nahor—\"and they worshipped oth er Elohim.'' The migration of Abraham, the story of hi s descen- dants, the enslavement in Egypt and the events of t he Exodus under the leadership of Moses were then briefly rev iewed, as well as the crossing of the Jordan and the settleme nt under Joshua's leadership. Now, as I and my generation ar e passing on, Joshua said, you are free to make a choice: you can remain committed to Yahweh—or you can worship other gods: Would'st ye hold Yahweh in awe, and worship Him in sincerity and in truth— then remove the Elohim whom your forefathers had worshipped across the river [Euphrates] and in Egypt, and worship [only] Yahweh. But if it does not please you to serve Yahweh— choose here and now whom ye shall worship: whether the Elohim which your forefathers had served on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Westerners in whose land ye dwel l; and I and my family shall worship Yahweh.

But no admonitions and witnessed covenants could pr e- serve the reality of an Israelite monotheistic encl ave within an overwhelming multitude of polytheistic peoples. As pointed out in the writings of the Jewish theologia n and bibli- cal scholar Yehezkel Kaufmann (The Religion of Isra el), the \"Basic Problem\" facing the Israelites was that the Bible was \"dedicated to fighting idolatry\"—the worship of ido ls, of statues made of wood and stone, or gold and silver— but recognized that other peoples worshiped \"other gods .\" \"Is- raelite religion and paganism are historically rela ted,\" he wrote; \"both are stages in the religious evolution of Man. Israelite religion arose at a certain period in his tory, and it goes without saying that its rise did not take plac e in a vacuum.\" Among the difficulties inherent in the Religion of Yahweh were the absence of a genealogy and of a primordial realm whence the gods had come. The gods who had been wor - shiped by the parents and forefathers of Abraham \"a cross the river\"—the first set of \"other gods\" listed by Joshua— included Enlil and Enki, the sons of the Anu, the b rothers of Ninharsag. Anu himself had named parents. All of th em had spouses, offspring—Ninurta, Nannar, Adad, Marduk, a nd so on. There was even a third generation—Shamash, Isht ar, Nabu. There had been an original homeland—a place c alled Nibiru, another world (i.e. planet) whence they had come to Earth. Then there were the \"other gods\" of Egypt; Yahweh h ad shown His might against them when Egypt was afflict ed to let the Children of Israel go, but they continued t o be vener- ated and worshiped not only in Egypt but also where ver Egypt's might had reached. They were headed by Ptah , and the great Ra was his son—traveling in Celestial Boa ts be- tween Earth and the \"Planet of Millions of Years,\" the pri- mordial abode. Thoth, Seth, Osiris, Horus, Isis, Ne pthys were related by simple genealogies in which brothers mar ried half sisters. When the Israelites, fearing that Moses ha d perished"},{"pageNumber":331,"pageContent":"Prophets of an Unseen God 327 on Mount Sinai, asked Aaron to reinvoke the deity, he fash- ioned a golden calf—the image of the Apis Bull—to r epresent the Bull of Heaven. And when a plague afflicted the Israel- ites, Moses made a copper serpent—the symbol of Enk i/ Ptah—to stop the plague. No wonder that the gods of Egypt, too, were fresh in the Israelites' mind. And then there were the \"other gods of the Westerne rs in whose lands you dwell\"—the gods of the Canaanites ( West- ern Asiatics) whose pantheon was headed by the reti red olden god El (a proper name or epithet being the singular of the plural Elohim) and his spouse Asherah; the active B a'ul (sim- ply meaning \"Lord\"), their son; his favorite female compan- ions Anal and Shepesh and Ashtoret, and his adversa ries Mot and Yam. Their playgrounds and battlegrounds were t he lands that stretched from the border of Egypt to the bord ers of Mesopotamia; every nation in that area worshiped th em, sometimes under locally adjusted names; and the Chi ldren of Israel were now dwelling in their midst ... To compound the \"Basic Problem\" of the missing ingr edi- ents of a genealogy and a primordial abode, was add ed the greater difficulty for the Israelites: an Unseen Go d who could not even be represented by a graven image. And so it was that, on and off, \"the Children of Is rael did wrong in the eyes of Yahweh, and worshiped the Ba'a l gods; they forsook Yahweh, the Elohim of their forefather s who hath brought them out of Egypt, and followed other Elohim from among the gods of the nations that surrounded them ... and paid homage to Ba'al and to Ashtoreth gods\" (Ju dges 2:11-13). And again and again leaders—designated Ju dges— arose to return the Israelites to their true faith and thereby remove Yahweh's wrath. One of those Judges, the female Deborah, is fondly recalled by the Bible as Nebi'ah—a Prophetess. Inspired by Y ahweh, she chose the right commander and tactics for the d efeat of Israel's northern enemies; the Bible records her vi ctory song—a poem considered by scholars a unique ancient liter- ary masterpiece. David Ben-Gurion (the first prime minister of the modern State of Israel), in The Jews in Thei r Land, wrote that \"that religio-national awakening was mov ingly ex- pressed in the Song of Deborah with its reference t o the great"},{"pageNumber":332,"pageContent":"328 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS and invisible God.\" In fact the victory hymnal song did more than that: It referred to the celestial nature of Y ahweh, as- serting that the victory was made possible because Yahweh, whose appearance \"makes the Earth tremble, the heav ens quake and the mountains melt,\" caused the \"planets, in their orbits,\" to fight the enemy. Such a celestial aspect of Yahweh, as we shall see, was to become highly significant in the prophetic utteranc es of the great Prophets of the Bible. Chronologically the term Nabih and its holder come into play again in the Books of Samuel, the boy who grew to be a combination prophet-priest-judge of his people. W e have already described the series of dream-encounters by which he had been called to Yahweh's embassy; \"and the bo y Sam- uel grew up and Yahweh was with him, and none of hi s words went unfulfilled; from Dan to Beersheba did t he whole of Israel know that Samuel was confirmed as a Nabih of Yahweh. And Yahweh continued to appear in Shiloh, f or it was in Shiloh that Yahweh revealed himself there to Samuel, when Yahweh hath spoken.\" Samuel's ministry coincided with the rise of a new and powerful enemy of Israel, the Philistines, who comm anded the coastal plain of Canaan from five strongholds. The con- flict, or when-push-comes-to-shove relationship, ha d flared up earlier in the time of Samson, and in another incid ent when the Philistines even captured the Ark of the Covena nt and brought it into the temple of their god Dagon (whos e statue, the Bible relates, kept falling down before the Ark ). It was thereafter that leaders of the twelve tribes assemb led before Samuel and asked that he choose a king for them—a s ystem of government \"akin to that of all the nations.\" It was thus that Saul the son of Kish was anointed the first ki ng of the Children of Israel. After a troubled reign, the mon archy passed to David, the son of Jesse, who had come int o promi- nence after he slew the giant Goliath. And after he was anointed by Samuel, \"the spirit of Yahweh was upon him, from that time on.\" Both Saul and David, the Bible states, \"inquired of Yah- weh,\" seeking oracles to guide their actions by.

David, we read in I Samuel 30:7, \"inquired of Yahweh\" by putting on the priestly garment of the H igh Priest with its oracular breastplate. But thereafte r he was given the \"word of Yahweh\" through prophets—first o ne named Gad and then another named Nathan. The Bible (II Samuel 24:11) calls the former \"Gad the Nabih, the Seer of David,\" through whom the \"word of Yahweh\" was made known to the king. Nathan was the prophet through w hom Yahweh had told David that not he, but his son, wou ld build the Temple in Jerusalem (II Samuel 7:2-17)—\"all the words in accordance with the vision did Nathan say unto D avid.\" The function of the Nabih as teacher and upholder o f moral laws and social justice, and not only as a conduit for divine messages, emerges from the deeds of even such an ea rly Prophet as the enigmatic \"Nathan\" (\"He who was granted\"). It happened when David, having seen Bath sheba naked as she washed herself on her home's roof, ord ered his general to expose Bathsheba's husband to the most d angerous battlefield spot, so that the king could take Baths heba as a wife once she was widowed. It was then that Nathan the prophet came to the king and told him a fable of a rich man who had many sheep but nevertheless coveted the onl y sheep that a poor man had. And when David exclaimed, \"suc h a man must be punished by death!\" the prophet told hi m: \"Thou art the man!\" Recognizing his sin and going out of his way to ato ne for it, David spent ever more time in pious meditation and soli- tary prayer; many of the king's reflections on God and Man found expression in the Psalms of David; in them th e celestial aspects of Yahweh echo, and expand upon, the words in the Song of Deborah. \"These are the words of the song D avid sang to Yahweh\" (II Samuel 22 and Psalm 18): Yahweh is my rock and my fortress; He is my deliverer ...

Some of them relayed the direct Word of God, others were guided by an Angel of Yahweh; some had to prove that they were \"true prophets\" by performing miracles which the \"f alse prophets\"—those whose utterances were meant to alwa ys please the king—could not duplicate; all were invol ved in the struggle against paganism and in efforts to see that the throne was occupied by a king who did \"that which w as righteous in the eyes of Yahweh.\" One whose ministry and record stood out in his time and left an indelible messianic expectation for generat ions thereaf- ter was the Prophet Elijah (Eli-yahu in Hebrew, mea ning \"Yahweh is my God\"). He was called to prophecy in t he reign of Ahab (circa 870 B . C ), the king of Israel who suc- cumbed completely to the religious influences of hi s Sidonite wife, the infamous Jezebel. He \"proceeded to worshi p Ba'al and bow to him;\" he built a temple to Ba'al in Sama ria and set up an altar to Asherah. Of him the Bible (I Kin gs 16:31-33) states that \"he angered Yahweh the God of Israel more than any other kings of Israel who had reigned before him.\" It was then that the Lord called upon Elijah to bec ome a Spokesman, taking care to assure his authority and authentic- ity through a series of miracles. The first recorded miracle was when Elijah came to stay with a poor widow; when she told him she was runnin g out of food, he assured her that the little flour and o il she had would last and last for days. And indeed, as they a te of it, the food miraculously never diminished. While staying with the woman, her son became grievo usly ill \"until at last his breathing ceased.\" Asking Ya hweh to spare the boy, Elijah took the child upstairs and l aid his body on the bed, and stretched himself upon the boy thre e times, crying out to the Lord each time; \"and the soul of the child"},{"pageNumber":336,"pageContent":"332 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS came back into him, and he revived.\" \"And the woman said unto Elijah: Now by this I know that thou art a Man of God, and that the word of Yahweh in thy mouth is truth.\" As time went on, Jezebel had no less than 450 \"prop hets of Ba'al\" assembled in her palace, with Elijah alon e re- maining a \"prophet of Yahweh.\" Told by Elijah to ar range a final showdown, the king assembled the people and the prophets of Ba'al on Mount Carmel. Two bullocks wer e brought and prepared for sacrifice on two altars, b ut no fire was lit on the altars: Each side was to cry out and pray to their god for a fire to strike the altar from the h eavens. The whole day went by without anything happening on the altar to Ba'al; but when it was the turn of Elijah to see k divine intervention, \"a fire from Yahweh fell down and con sumed the sacrifice\" and the altar itself. \"And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said: Yahweh i s the Elohim!\" And Elijah told them to kill all the proph ets of Ba'al, letting not one escape. When the news reached Jezebel, she ordered Elijah k illed; but he escaped southward, toward the wilderness of Sinai. Hungry and thirsty he lay exhausted, ready to die; it was then that the Angel of Yahweh miraculously provided him with food and water and showed him the way to a cav e on Mount Sinai, the \"Mount of the Elohim.\" There the L ord, speaking to him out of the stillness, instructed hi m to go back north and anoint a new king in Damascus, the Aramea n capi- tal, and a new king over Israel; and to \"anoint Eli sha son of Shaphat to be a prophet after thee.\" This was more than a hint of things to come—the inv olve- ment of the Prophets of Yahweh in affairs of state— pre- dicting the downfall of kings and anointing their s uccessors; and not only in Israel or Judaea, but also in forei gn capitals! Several more times the prophetic activity of Elijah is stated to have taken place after the \"Angel of Yahweh\" had given him instructions, and it appears that this was the manner in which Yahweh's word was communicated to him.

H is fame and miracles were not limited to the Israelite domain, and foreign dignitaries sought his healing powers; after one su ch magical treatment, the Aramean leader acknowledged that \"in deed mere is no Elohim on Earth except the one in Israel .\" As Elijah before him, Elisha was also involved in r oyal successions that were divinely ordered; by the time he died, the King of Israel (Joash, circa 800 B . C .) was the fifth succes- sor to Ahab; and as Prophets after him, Elisha was the Divine Spokesman in matters of war and peace. II Kings cha pter 3 relates the rebellion by Mesha, the king of the Moa bites, against Israelite dominance after the death of Ahab , when Elisha was consulted for Yahweh's ruling whether to fight the Moabites.

Indeed, \"all the inhabitants of the world and the dwellers on Earth\" shall be judged by Yahweh, for they have all gone a stray. At center stage were the three longtime powers: Egy pt, Assyria, Babylon; of them, Egypt—and its gods—were treated with the least respect. In spite of close a nd sometimes friendly relationships between the Hebrew kingdoms and Egypt (Solomon married a Pharaoh's daughter and was pro- vided by the Egyptians with horses and chariots), E gypt was considered to be treacherous and unreliable. Its ki ng Shesh- onq—the biblical Shishak (I Kings 11 and 14)—ransac ked the Temple in Jerusalem, and Necho II, on his way t o ward off Mesopotamian armies, killed the Judaean king Jo siah who came out to greet him (II Kings 23). Both Isaiah an d Jeremiah spoke out at length against Egypt and its gods, pro phesying the demise of both. Isaiah (chapter 19), in an \"Oracle on Egypt,\" envis ioned Yahweh arriving in Egypt airborne on the day when H e would judge and punish Egypt and the Egyptians: Behold Yahweh, riding upon a swift cloud, coming unto Egypt. The idols of Egypt shall tremble before Him, the heart of Egypt shall melt as He comes near. Predicting—correctly—the coming of internal strife and civil war in Egypt, the Prophet envisioned the Phar aoh fu- tilely seeking the counsel of his seers and wizards to find out Yahweh's intentions.

T he Assyrian imperial expansion, at first directed to the north and northeast, targeted the lands of western Asia by the time of S halmaneser III (858-824 B . C ). On one of his commemorative obelisks he recorded the sacking of Damascus, the execution of its king Hazael, and the receipt of tribute from Hazael 's neighbor Jehu, the king of Israel (Samaria). Accompanying th e inscrip- tion was a depiction showing Jehu bowing to Shalman eser under the emblem of the Winged Disc of the god Ashu r (Fig. 109). A century later, when Menahem the son of Gadi was t he king in Israel, \"Pul the king of Assyria came again st the land, and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of si lver that his hand might be with him to retain the kingship.\" This biblical record in II Kings 15:19 reveals the impre ssive famil- iarity with politics and royal affairs in distant M esopotamia. The name of the Assyrian king who again invaded the Medi- terranean lands was Tiglat-Pileser (745-727 B.C.); yet the Bible was right to call him Pul because this king a lso as- sumed the Babylonian throne and renamed himself the re Pulu—a fact confirmed by the discovery of a tablet (\"Baby-"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Prophets of an Unseen God 341 Ionian King List B\") that is now in the British Mus eum. A few years later Ahaz, the king of Judaea, resorted to the same tactic, \"talcing the silver and the gold that were in the Temple of Yahweh and in the king's treasury and sending th em to the king of Assyria as a bribe.\" These subservient gestures, it appears in retrospec t, only whetted the appetite of the Assyrian kings. The sam e Tiglal- Pileser returned and seized parts of the Israelite kingdom and exiled their inhabitants. In 722 B.C. his successor , Shal- maneser V, overran the rest of the Israelite kingdo m and dispersed its people throughout the Assyrian empire ; the whereabouts of those Ten Lost Tribes of Israel and their descendants are a lingering enigma. The exile, according to the Prophets, was willed by Yah- weh himself because of Israel's transgressions, \"th ey heeded not the words of Yahweh their Elohim and transgress ed His Covenant and all that Moses the servant of Yahweh c om- manded.\" The Prophet Hosea, in words and symbolic d eeds, foresaw those events as punishment for Israel's \"wh oring\" after other gods, but made it known that \"a quarrel hath Yahweh with the inhabitants of Earth, for mere is n either truth nor justice, nor understanding of Elohim upon the Earth.\" Isaiah's prophecies specified that Assyria would be the Lord's instrument for punishment: \"I the Lord s hall bring upon you the king of Assyria and all his hosts,\" he said as Yahweh's spokesman. But that, Isaiah said, was only the beginning. In t he \"Ora- cle on Assyria,\" in which that power was called \"th e rod of God's wrath\" (10:5), Yahweh also expressed his ange r at Assyria's excesses, taking it into its haughty hear t to annihi- late whole nations with unparalleled brutality, whe reas Yah- weh's intent was only to chastise through punishmen t, to always leave a remnant that would be redeemed.

The Assyrians exhibited this failure when, ha ving ex- iled the people of Israel, they resettled the land with foreign- ers exiled from their lands, letting each group con tinue to worship their gods. The list, one may note, counts among the idols that were thus set up that of Marduk by the B abylo- nians, of Nergal by the Cutheans, and of Adad by th e Palmyrians. The newcomers to Samaria were devastate d, however, by wild lions and saw this as a sign of an ger by the \"local god,\" Yahweh. The Assyrian solution was to send back to Samaria one of the exiled priests of Yahweh , to teach the newcomers \"the customs of the local god.** So, while an Israelite priest was teaching them \"how to worship Yah- weh,\" it was only an addition of one more god to th e poly- theistic worship ... That Yahweh was different and that Assyria was subj ect to His will was demonstrated when Sennacherib (704- 681 B.C.) invaded Judaea and, ignoring its tribute, sen t his general Rabshakeh and a large army to capture Jerusalem. Su r- rounding the city, Rabshakeh sought its surrender b y sug- gesting that the Assyrian king was only carrying ou t Yahweh's wish: \"Is it without the will of Yahweh th at I have come hither to destroy this place?

Listing the many nations that Assyria conquered, \"hath any of t he gods of those nations, each one in his country, saved it from the king of Assyria?\" he asked rhetorically; \"so who is Yahweh that he would save Jerusalem from me?\" The comparison of Yahweh to the pagan gods was such blasphemy that the king, Hezekiah, tore his clothes and put on sackcloth in mourning. Joining the priests in th e Temple, he sent word to Isaiah, asking him to seek the help of Yah- weh \"in this day of distress, of reviling and disgr ace,\" a day on which an emissary of the king of Assyria reviled \"a Liv- ing God,\" comparing Him to the gods of other nation s \"who are not Elohim but man-made of wood and stone.\""},{"pageNumber":347,"pageContent":"Prophets of an Unseen God 343 And Isaiah the Prophet sent back to Hezekiah the \"w ord of Yahweh\" against the haughtiness of Sennacherib, who dared \"raise his voice to revile the God of Israel, He who is enthroned upon the Cherubim.\" Therefore, the Pro phet declared, Jerusalem shall be spared and Sennacherib shall be punished. \"And it came to pass that night that the Angel of t he Lord came and smote the camp of the Assyrians, all one h undred and eighty five thousand of them ...

This reprieve of Jerusalem was only temporary. The divine plan for a global catharsis still was in effect; ex cept that now the chastising had to continue with Assyria itself. The pro- cess, as we have mentioned, began in 626 B.C.; and the divine rod to achieve that, Babylon, attained its own impe rial reach under the king Nebuchadnezzar II (605-562 B . C ). Their wayward ways—the social injustices, the insin cere sacrifices, the worship of idols—would bring upon t hem due punishment, the Prophets forewarned the kings and p eople of Judaea. It would bring upon them Yahweh's wrath in the form of a \"great and ferocious nation, coming from the north.\" It was in the very first year of Nebuchadne zzar, king of Babylon, that Jeremiah made explicit the oracle of punish- ment against the nation of Judah, the dwellers of J erusalem, and all the neighboring nations: So sayeth Yahweh, Lord of Hosts: Because ye have not hearkened to my words, I will send for and fetch all the tribes of the north; The word of Yahweh [shall be] to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, my servant.

And it shall come to pass, when seventy years shall be completed —this is the word of Yahweh— I will call to account the king of Babylon and the land and the people of Chaldea, and will put them to everlasting desolation.

As the master biologist, Enki's emblem was that of the Entwined Serpents, representing the double-helixed DNA— the genetic code that enabled Enki to perform the g enetic mixing that brought about The Adam; and then (which is the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden) to aga in genetically manipulate the new hybrids and enable t hem to procreate. One of Enki's Sumerian epithets was BUZU R; it meant both \"He who solves secrets\" and \"He of the m ines,\" for the knowledge of mineralogy was considered know ledge of Earth's secrets, the secrets of its dark depths. The biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden— the tale of the second genetic manipulation—assigns to the serpent the role of triggering their acquisition of \"knowing\" (the biblical term for sexual procreation). The Heb rew term for serpent is Nahash; and interestingly, the same word also means soothsayer, \"He who solves secrets\"—the very same second meaning of Enki's epithet.

The combination of biology with mineralogy and with the ability to solve secrets reflected Enki's status as the god of knowledge and sciences, of the Earth's hidden metal s; he was the one who set up the mining operations in southea stern Africa. All these aspects were attributes of Yahweh . \"It is Yahweh who giveth wisdom, out of His mouth cometh knowledge and understanding,\" Proverbs asserted (2: 6), and it was He who granted wisdom beyond comparison to S olo- mon, as Enki had given the Wise Adapa. \"The gold is mine and the silver is mine,\" Yahweh announced (Haggai 2 :8); \"I shall give thee the treasures of the darkness and t he hidden riches of the secret places,\" Yahweh promised Cyrus (Isaiah 45:3). The clearest congruence between the Mesopotamian an d biblical narratives is found in the story of the De luge. In the Mesopotamian versions it is Enki who goes out of hi s way to warn his faithful follower Ziusudra/Utnapishtim of the coming catastrophe, instructs him to build the wate rtight ark, gives him its specifications and dimensions, and di rects him to save the seed of animal life. In the Bible, all that is done by Yahweh. The case for identifying Yahweh with Enki can be bo l- stered by examining the references to Enki's domain s. After Earth was divided between the Enlilites and the Enk i'ites (according to the Mesopotamian texts), Enki was gra nted do- minion over Africa. Its regions included the Apsu ( stemming from AB.ZU in Sumerian), the gold-mining region, wh ere Enki had his principal abode (in addition to his \"c ult center\" Eridu in Sumer). The term Apsu, we believe, explain s the biblical term Apsei-eretz, usually translated \"the ends of earth,\" the land at the continent's edge—southern A frica, as we understand it. In the Bible, this distant place, Apsei-eretz, is where \"Yahweh shall judge\" (I Samuel 2:10), wher e He shall rule when Israel is restored (Micah 5:3).

According to the Mesopotamian sources, when Enki di - vided the African continent among his sons, he gran ted the Apsu to his son Nergal. The polytheistic gloss (of asking the name of the Apsu's ruler and that of his son) can b e explained only by an editorial inadvertent retention of a pas sage from the Sumerian original texts—the same gloss as had o ccurred in the use of \"us\" in \"let us make the Adam\" and in \"let us come down\" in the story of the Tower of Babel.

In the biblical version (chapter 6 of Genesis), it is Yahweh who voices his unhappiness with Mankin d and makes the decision to wipe Mankind off the face of the Earth. In the tale's conclusion, as Ziusudra/Utnapishtim o ffers sacri- fices on Mount Ararat, it is Enlil who is attracted by the pleasant smell of roasting meat and (with some pers uasion) accepts the survival of Mankind, forgives Enki, and blesses Ziusudra and his wife. In Genesis, it is to Yahweh that Noah builds an altar and sacrifices animals on it, and i t was Yah- weh \"who smelled the pleasant aroma.\" So was Yahweh Enlil, after all? A strong case can be made for such an identificatio n. If there had been a \"first among equals\" as far as the two half brothers, sons of Anu, were concerned, the first wa s Enlil.

(Enki, interchangeably called in the Mesopotamian t exts E.A.—\"Whose home is water\"—was thus the prototype o f the sea god Poseidon of Greek mythology, the brothe r of Zeus who was head of the pantheon). After Anu, the ruler on Nibiru, returned to Nibiru after visiting Earth, it was Enlil who summoned and presi ded over the council of the Great Anunnaki whenever major de cisions had to be made. At various times of crucial decisio ns—such as to create The Adam, to divide the Earth into fou r regions, to institute Kingship as both buffer and liaison be tween the Anunnaki gods and Mankind, as well as in times of c risis between the Anunnaki themselves, when their rivalri es erupted into wars and even use of nuclear weapons—\" The Anunnaki who decree the fates sat exchanging their coun- sels.\" Typical was the manner in which one discussi on is described in part: \"Enki addressed to Enlil words o f lauding: 'O one who is foremost among the brothers, Bull of Heaven, who the fate of Mankind holds.' \" Except for the ti mes when the debate got too heated and became a shouting mat ch, the procedure was orderly, with Enlil turning to each m ember of the Council to let him or her have a say.

As far as personal characters were concerned, Enki, the fashioner of Mankind, was more forebearing, less st ringent with both gods and mortals. Enlil was stricter, a \" law and order\" type, uncompromising, unhesitant to mete out punish- ments when punishment was due. Perhaps it was becau se while Enki managed to get away with sexual promiscu ities, Enlil, transgressing just once (when he date-raped a young nurse, in what turned out to be his seduction by he r), was sentenced to exile (his banishment was lifted when he married her as his consort Ninlil). He viewed adversely the intermar- riage between Nefilim and the \"daughters of Man.\" W hen the evils of Mankind became overbearing, he was wil ling to see it perish by the Deluge. His strictness with ot her Anun- naki, even his own offspring, was illustrated when his son Nannar (the Moon god Sin) lamented the imminent des olation of his city Ur by the deathly nuclear cloud wafting from the Sinai. Harshly Enlil told him: \"Ur was indeed grant ed King- ship; but an everlasting reign it was not granted.\" Enlil's character had at the same time another side , a re- warding one.

The accursat ion of Cain was to last through seven times seven generations; Jericho was to be circled seven times so that its walls wou ld fall down; many of the priestly rites were required to b e repeated seven times, or to last seven days. Of a more lasti ng com- mandment, the New Year Festival was deliberately sh ifted from the first month Nisan to the seventh month Tis hrei and the principal holidays were to last seven days. The number fifty was the principal numerical feature in the co nstruction and equipping of the Ark of the Covenant and the Ta bernacle and an important element in the future Temple envis ioned by Ezekiel. It was a calendrical count of days in prie stly rites; Abraham persuaded the Lord to spare Sodom if fifty just men would be found there. More important, a major socia l and"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Endpaper 355 economic concept of a Jubilee Year in which slaves would be set free, real property would revert to its sell ers and so on, was instituted. It was to be the fiftieth year: \"Ye shall hallow the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom throu ghout the land,\" was the commandment in Leviticus chapter 25. Both numbers, seven and fifty, were associated in M esopo- tamia with Enlil. He was \"the god who is seven\" bec ause, as the highest-ranking Anunnaki leader on Earth, he was in command of the planet which was the seventh planet. And in the numerical hierarchy of the Anunnaki, in whic h Anu held the highest numeral 60, Enlil (as his intended successor on Nibiru) held the numerical rank of fifty (Enki's numerical rank was forty). Significantly, when Marduk took ov er the supremacy on Earth circa 2000 B.C., one of the meas ures taken to signify his ascendancy was to grant him fi fty names, signifying his assumption of the Rank of Fifty. The similarities between Yahweh and Enlil extend to other aspects. Though he might have been depicted on cyli nder seals (which is not certain, since the representati on might have been of his son Ninurta), he was by and large an unseen god, ensconced in the innermost chambers of his zig gurat or altogether away from Sumer. In a telltale passage i n the Hymn to Enlil, the All-Beneficent it is thus said o f him: When in his awesomeness he decrees the fates, no god dares look at him; Only to his exalted emissary, Nusku, the command, the word that is in his heart, does he make known. No man can see me and live, Yahweh told Moses in a similar vein; and His words and commandments were k nown through Emissaries and Prophets. While all these reasons for equating Yahweh with En lil are fresh in the reader's mind, let us hasten to of fer the contrary evidence that points to other, different i dentifica- tions. One of the most powerful biblical epithets for Yahw eh is El Shaddai. Of an uncertain etymology, it assumed a n aura"},{"pageNumber":360,"pageContent":"356 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS of mystery and by medieval times became a code word for kabbalistic mysticism. Early Greek and Latin transl ators of the Hebrew Bible rendered Shaddai as \"omnipotent,\" leading to the rendering of El Shaddai in the King James tr anslation as \"God Almighty\" when the epithet appears in the t ales of the Patriarchs (e.g. \"And Yahweh appeared unto Abra m and said to him: '1 am El Shaddai; walk before me and b e thou perfect',\" in Genesis 17:1), or in Ezekiel, in Psal ms, or sev- eral times in other books of the Bible. Advances in the study of Akkadian in recent years s uggest that the Hebrew word is related to shaddu, which me ans \"mountain\" in Akkadian; so that El Shaddai simply m eans \"God of mountains.\" That this is a correct understa nding of the biblical term is indicated by an incident repor ted in I Kings chapter 20. The Arameans, who were defeated i n an attempt to invade Israel (Samaria), recouped their losses and a year later planned a second attack. To win this t ime, the Aramaean king's generals suggested that a ruse be u sed to lure the Israelites out of their mountain stronghol ds to a bat- tlefield in the coastal plains. \"Their god is a god of moun- tains,\" the generals told the king, \"and that is wh y they prevailed over us; but if we shall fight them in a plain, we shall be the stronger ones.\" Now, there is no way that Enlil could have been cal led, or reputed to be, a \"god of mountains,\" for there a re no mountains in the great plain that was (and still is ) Mesopota- mia. In the Enlilite domains the land that was call ed \"Moun- tainland\" was Asia Minor to the north, beginning wi th the Taurus (\"Bull\") mountains; and that was the region of Adad, Enid's youngest son. His Sumerian name was ISH.KUR (and his \"cult animal\" was the bull), which meant \"He of the mountainland.\" The Sumerian ISH was rendered shaddu in Akkadian; so that Il Shaddu became the biblical El Shaddai. Scholars speak of Adad, whom the Hittites called Te shub (see Fig. 80) as a \"storm god,\" always depicted wit h a light- ning, thundering, and windblowing, and thus the god of rains. The Bible credited Yahweh with similar attributes. \"When Yahweh uttereth His voice,\" Jeremiah said (10:13), \"there is a rumbling of waters in the skies and storms com e from the ends of the earth; He maketh lightnings with th e rain,"},{"pageNumber":361,"pageContent":"Endpaper 357 and blows a wind from its sources.\" The Psalms (135 :7), the Book of Job, and other Prophets reaffirmed Yahweh's role as giver or withholder of rains, a role initially e xpounded to the Children of Israel during the Exodus. While these attributes tarnish the similarities bet ween Yah- weh and Enlil, they should not carry us away to ass ume that, if so, Yahweh was the mirror image of Adad. The Bib le recognized the existence of Hadad (as his name was spelled in Hebrew) as one of the \"other gods\" of other nati ons, not of Israel, and mentions various kings and princes ( in the Aramean Damascus and other neighboring capitals) wh o were called Ben-Hadad (\"Son of Adad\"). In Palmyra (the b iblical Tadmor), capital of eastern Syria, Adad's epithet w as Ba'al Shamin, \"Lord of Heaven,\" causing the Prophets to c ount him as just one of the Ba'al gods of neighboring na tions who were an abomination in the eyes of Yahweh. There is no way, therefore, that Yahweh could have been one and the same as Adad. The comparability between Yahweh and Enlil is furth er diminished by another important attribute of Yahweh , that of a warrior. \"Yahweh goes forth like a warrior, like a hero He whips up His rage; He shall roar and cry out and ov er His enemies He shall prevail,\" Isaiah (42:13) stated, e choing the verse in the Song of Miriam that stated, \"A Warrior is Yah- weh\" (Numbers chapter 15). Continuously, the Bible refers to and describes Yahweh as the \"Lord of hosts,\" \"Ya hweh, the Lord of hosts, a warring army commands,\" Isaiah (13:4) declared. And Numbers 21:14 refers to a Book of the Wars of Yahweh in which the divine wars were recorded. There is nothing in the Mesopotamian records that w ould suggest such an image for Enlil. The warrior par ex cellence was his son, Ninurta, who fought and defeated Zu, e ngaged in the Pyramid Wars with the Enki'ites, and fought and im- prisoned Marduk in the Great Pyramid. His frequent epithets were \"the warrior\" and \"the hero\" and hymns to him hailed him as \"Ninurta, Foremost Son, possessor of divine powers . .. Hero who in his hand the divine brilliant weap on carries.\" His feats as a warrior were described in an epic te xt whose Sumerian title was Lugal-e Ud Melam-bi that scholar s have called The Book of The Feats and Exploits of Ninurt a. Was"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"358 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS it, one wonders, the enigmatic Book of the Wars of Yahweh of which the Bible spoke? In other words, could Yahweh have been Ninurta? As Foremost Son and heir apparent of Enlil, Ninurta too bore the numerical rank of fifty, and could thus qu alify no less than Enlil to have been the Lord who decreed t he fifty- year Jubilee and other fifty-related aspects mentio ned in the Bible. He possessed a notorious Divine Black Bird t hat he used both for combat and on humanitarian missions; it could have been the Kabod flying vehicle that Yahweh poss essed. He was active in the Zagros Mountains to the east o f Mesopo- tamia, the lands of Elam, and was revered there as Ninshushi- nak, \"Lord of Shushan city\" (the Elamite capital). At one time he performed great dyking works in the Zagros moun- tains; at another, he diked and diverted mountain r ain chan- nels in the Sinai peninsula to make its mountainous part cultivable for his mother Ninharsag; in a way he, t oo, was \"'god of mountains.\" His association with the Sinai peninsula and the channeling of its rainwaters, that come in winter bursts only, into an irrigation system is still rec alled to this day: the largest Wadi (a river that fills up in win ter and dries up in summer) in the peninsula is still called Wadi El-Arish, the wadi of the Urash—the Ploughman—a nickname of N i- nurta from way back. An association with the Sinai peninsula, through his waterworks and his mother's residence t here, also offers links to a Yahweh identification. Another interesting aspect of Ninurta that invokes a simi- larity to the Biblical Lord comes to light in an in scription by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal, who at one time inv aded Elam. In it the king called him, \"The mysterious go d who lingers in a secret place where no one can see what his divine being is about.\" An unseen god! But Ninurta, as far as the earlier Sumerians were c on- cerned, was not a god in hiding, and graphic depict ions of him, as we have shown, were not even rare. Then, in conflict with a Yahweh-Ninurta identification, we come acros s a major ancient text, dealing with a major and unforg ettable event, whose specifics seem to tell us that Ninurta was not Yahweh. One of the most decisive actions attributed in the Bible to"},{"pageNumber":363,"pageContent":"Endpaper 359 Yahweh, with lasting effects and indelible memories , was the upheavaling of Sodom and Gomorrah. The event, as we have shown in great detail in The Wars of Gods and Men, was described and recalled in Mesopotamian texts, makin g possi- ble a comparison of the deities involved. In the biblical version Sodom (where Abram's nephew and his family lived) and Gomorrah, cities in the verda nt plain south of the Sea of Salt, were sinful. Yahweh \"come s down\" and, accompanied by two Angels, visits Abram and hi s wife Sarai in their encampment near Hebron. After Yahweh pre- dicts that the aged couple would have a son, the tw o Angels depart for Sodom to verify the extent of the cities ' \"sinning.\" Yahweh then reveais to Abram that if the sins would be confirmed, the cities and their residents would be destroyed. Abram pleads with Yahweh to spare Sodom if fifty ju st men be found there, and Yahweh agrees (the number was b ar- gained by Abram down to ten) and departs. The Angel s, having verified the cities' evil, warn Lot to take his family and escape. He asks for time to reach the mountains , and they agree to delay the destruction. Finally, the c ities' doom begins as \"Yahweh rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah su lfu- rous fire, coming from Yahweh from the skies; and H e uphea- valed those cities and the whole plain and all the inhabitants thereof, and all that which grew upon the ground . . . And Abraham went early in the morning to the place wher e he had stood before Yahweh, and gazed in the direction of Sodom and Gomorrah, toward the land of the Plain, a nd he beheld vapor arising from the earth as the smoke of a fur- nace\" (Genesis chapter 19). The same event is well documented in Mesopotamian a n- nals as the culmination of Marduk's struggle to att ain suprem- acy on Earth. Living in exile, Marduk gave his son Nabu the assignment of converting people in western Asia to become followers of Marduk. After a series of skirmishes, Nabu's forces were strong enough to invade Mesopotamia and enable Marduk to return to Babylon, where he declared his intention to make it the Gateway of the Gods (what its name, Bab- Ili, implied). Alarmed, the Council of the Anunnaki met in emergency sessions chaired by Enlil. Ninurta, and a n alien- ated son of Enki called Nergal (from the south Afri can do-"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"360 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS main), recommended drastic action to stop Marduk. E nki vehemently objected. Ishtar pointed out that while they were debating, Marduk was seizing city after city. \"Sher iffs\" were sent to seize Nabu, but he escaped and was hiding a mong his followers in one of the \"sinning cities.\" Final ly, Ninurta and Nergal were authorized to retrieve from a hidin g place awesome nuclear weapons, and to use them to destroy the Spaceport in the Sinai (lest it fall into Mardukian hands) as well as the area where Nabu was hiding. The unfolding drama, the heated discussions, the ac cusa- tions, and the final drastic action—the use of nucl ear weapons in 2024 B . C .—are described in great detail in a text that scho l- ars call the Erra Epic. In this document Nergal is referred to as Erra (\"Ho wler\") and Ninurta is called Ishum (\"Scorcher\"). Once they were given the go-ahead they retrieved \"the awesome seve n weap- ons, without parallel\" and went to the Spaceport ne ar the \"Mount Most Supreme.\" The destruction of the Spacep ort was carried out by Ninurta/Ishum: \"He raised his ha nd; the Mount was smashed; the plain by the Mount Most Supr eme he then obliterated; in its forests not a tree-stem was left standing.\" Now it was the turn of the sinning cities to be uph eavaled, and the task was carried out by Nergal/Erra. He wen t there by following the King's Highway that connected the Sinai and the Red Sea with Mesopotamia: Then, emulating Ishum, Erra the King's Highway followed. The cities he finished off, to desolation he overturned them. The use of nuclear weapons there broke open the san d barrier that still partly exists in the shape of a tongue (called El Lissan), and the waters of the Salt Sea poured s outh, inundating the low-lying plain. The ancient text re cords that Erra/Nergal \"dug through the sea, its wholeness he divided.\" And the nuclear weapons turned the Salt Sea to the body of water now called the Dead Sea: \"That which lives in it he made wither,\" and what used to be a thriving and ve rdant"},{"pageNumber":365,"pageContent":"Endpaper 361 plain, \"as with fire he scorched the animals, burne d its grains to become as dust.\" As was the clear-cut case of the divine actors in t he Deluge tale, so we find in this one concerning the upheava ling of Sodom, Gomorrah, and the other cities of that plain astride the Sinai peninsula, whom does and whom does not Ya hweh match when the biblical and Sumerian texts are comp ared. The Mesopotamian text clearly associates Nergal and not Ni- nurta as the one who had upheavaled the sinning cit ies. Since the Bible asserts that it was not the two Angels wh o had gone to verify the situation, but Yahweh himself wh o had rained destruction on the cities, Yahweh could not have been Ninurta. (The reference in Genesis chapter 10 to Nimrod as t he one credited with starting Kingship in Mesopotamia, whi ch we have discussed earlier, is interpreted by some as a reference not to a human king but to a god, and thus to Ninur ta to whom the task of setting up the first Kingships was assigned. If so, the biblical statement that Nimrod \"was a mi ghty hunter before Yahweh\" also nullifies the possibilit y that Ni- nurta/Nimrod could have been Yahweh). But Nergal too was not Yahweh. He is mentioned by n ame as the deity of the Cutheans who were among the for eigners brought over by the Assyrians to replace the Israel ites who were exiled. He is listed among the \"other gods\" th at the newcomers worshiped and for whom they set up idols. He could not have been \"Yahweh\" and Yahweh's abominati on at one and the same time. If Enlil and two of his sons, Adad and Ninurta, are not finalists in the lineup to identify Yahweh, what ab out Enlil's third son, Nannar/Sin (the \"Moon god\")? His \"cult center\" (as scholars call it) in Sumer wa s Ur, the very city from which the migration of Terah and his family began. From Ur, where Terah performed priest ly ser- vices, they went to Harran on the Upper Euphrates—a city that was a duplicate (even if on a smaller scale) o f Ur as a cult center of Nannar. The migration at that partic ular time was connected, we believe, with religious and royal changes that might have affected the worship of Nannar. Was he then"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"362 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS the deity who had instructed Abram the Sumerian to pick up and leave? Having brought peace and prosperity to Sumer when U r was its capital, he was venerated in Ur's great zig gurat (whose remains rise awesomely to this day) with his beloved wife NIN.GAL (\"Great Lady\"). At the time of the new moon, the hymns sung to this divine couple expresse d the people's gratitude to them; and the dark of the moo n was considered a time of \"the mystery of the great gods , a time of Nannar's oracle,\" when he would send \"Zaqar, the god of dreams during the night\" to give commands as wel l as to forgive sins. He was described in the hymns as \"dec ider of destinies in Heaven and on Earth, leader of living creatures ... who causes truth and justice to be.\" It all sounds not unlike some of the praises of Yah weh sung by the Psalmist ... The Akkadian/Semitic name for Nannar was Sin, and t here can be no doubt that it was in honor of Nannar as S in that the part of the Sinai peninsula called in the Bible the \"Wil- derness of Sin\" and, for that matter, the whole pen insula, were so named. It was in that part of the world tha t Yahweh appeared to Moses for the first time, where the \"Mo unt of the gods\" was located, where the greatest Theophany ever had taken place. Furthermore, the principal habitat in the Sinai's central plain, in the vicinity of what we b elieve is the true Mount Sinai, is still called Nakhl in Arabic a fter the goddess Ningal whose Semitic name was pronounced Ni kal. Was it all indicative of a Yahweh = Nannar/Sin iden tifica- tion? The discovery several decades ago of extensive Cana anite literature (\"myths\" to scholars) dealing with their pantheon revealed that while a god they called Ba'al (the ge neric word for \"Lord\" used as a personal name) was running thi ngs, he was in fact not entirely independent of his father El (a generic term meaning \"god\" used as a personal name). In the se texts El is depicted as a retired god, living with his sp ouse Asherah away from the populated areas, at a quiet place whe re \"the two waters meet\"—a place that we have identified in The Stairway To Heaven as the southern tip of the Sinai penin- sula, where the two gulfs extending from the Red Se a meet."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Endpaper 363 This fact and other considerations have led us to t he conclu- sion that the Canaanite El was the retired Nannar/S in; in- cluded in the reasons upon which we had expounded i s the fact that a \"cult center\" to Nannar/Sin has existed at a vital crossroads in the ancient Near East and even nowada ys, the city known to us as Jericho but whose biblical/Semi tic name is Yeriho, meaning \"City of the Moon God\"; and the adop- tion by tribes to the south thereof of Allah—\"El\" i n Ara- bic—as the God of Islam represented by the Moon's c rescent. Described in the Canaanite texts as a retired deity , El as Nannar/Sin would indeed have been forced into retir ement: Sumerian texts dealing with the effects of the nucl ear cloud as it wafted eastward and reached Sumer and its cap ital Ur, reveal that Nannar/Sin—refusing to leave his belove d city— was afflicted by the deathly cloud and was partly p aralyzed. The image of Yahweh, especially in the period of th e Exo- dus and the settlement of Canaan, i.e. after—not pr ior to— the demise of Ur, does not sound right for a retire d, afflicted, and tired deity as Nannar/Sin had become by then. T he Bible paints a picture of an active deity, insistent and persistent, fully in command, defying the gods of Egypt, inflic ting plagues, dispatching Angels, roaming the skies; omn ipresent, performing wonders, a magical healer, a Divine Arch itect. We find none of that in the descriptions of Nannar/ Sin. Both his veneration and fear of him stemmed from hi s association with his celestial counterpart, the Moo n; and this celestial aspect serves as a decisive argument agai nst identi- fying him with Yahweh: In the biblical divine order , it was Yahweh who ordered the Sun and the Moon to serve as luminaries; \"the Sun and the Moon praise Yahweh,\" t he Psalmist (148:3) declared. And on Earth, the crumbl ing of the walls of Jericho before the trumpeters of Yahwe h symbol- ized the supremacy of Yahweh over the Moon god Sin. There was also the matter of Ba'al, the Canaanite d eity whose worship was a constant thorn in the side of Y ahweh's faithful. The discovered texts reveal that Ba'al wa s a son of El. His abode in the mountains of Lebanon is still known as Baalbek, \"The valley of Ba'al\"—the place that was t he first destination of Gilgamesh in his search for immortal ity. The biblical name for it was Beit-Shemesh—the \"House/ab ode of"},{"pageNumber":368,"pageContent":"364 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Shamash;\" and Shamash, we may recall, was a son of Nan- nar/Sin. The Canaanite \"myths\" devote much clay tab let space to the shenanigans between Ba'al and his sist er Anat; the Bible lists in the area of Beit-Shemesh a place called Beit Anat; and we are as good as certain that the Semiti c name Anat was a rendering of Anunitu (\"Ami's beloved\")—a nick- name of Inanna/Ishtar, the twin sister of Utu/Shama sh. All that suggests that in the Canaanite trio El-Ba' al-Anat we see the Mesopotamian triad of Nannar/Sin-Utu/Sha mash- Inanna/Ishtar—the gods associated with the Moon, th e Sun, and Venus. And none of them could have been Yahweh, for the Bible is replete with admonitions against the w orship of these celestial bodies and their emblems. If neither Enlil nor any one of his sons (or even g randchil- dren) fully qualify as Yahweh, the search must turn else- where, to the sons of Enki, where some of the quali fications also point. The instructions given to Moses during the sojourn at Mount Sinai were, to a great extent, of a medical n ature. Five whole chapters in Leviticus and many passages in Nu mbers are devoted to medical procedures, diagnosis and tr eatment. \"Heal me, O Yahweh, and I shall be healed,\" Jeremia h (17:14) cried out: \"My soul blesses Yahweh . . . wh o heals all my ailments,\" the Psalmist sang (103:1-3). Beca use of his piety, King Hezekiah was not only cured on Yahw eh's say-so of a fatal disease, but was also granted by Yahweh fifteen more years to live (II Kings chapter 19). Y ahweh could not only heal and extend life, he could also (through his Angels and Prophets) revive the dead; an extrem e exam- ple was provided by Ezekiel's vision of the scatter ed dry bones that came back alive, their dead resurrected by Yah- weh's will. The biological-medical knowledge underlying such ca pa- bilities was possessed by Enki, and he passed such knowledge to two of his sons: Marduk (known as Ra in Egypt), and Thoth (whom the Egyptians called Tehuti and the Sum erians NIN.GISH.ZIDDA—\"Lord of the Tree of Life\"). As for Marduk, many Babylonian texts refer to his healing abilities; but—as his own complaint to his father reveals—he w as"},{"pageNumber":369,"pageContent":"Endpaper 365 given knowledge of healing but not that of reviving the dead. On the other hand, Thoth did possess such knowledge , em- ploying it on one occasion to revive Horus, the son of the god Osiris and his sister-wife Isis. According to t he hiero- glyphic text dealing with this incident, Horus was bitten by a poisonous scorpion and died. As his mother appeal ed to the \"god of magical things,\" Thoth, for help, he ca me down to Earth from the heavens in a sky boat, and restor ed the boy back to life. When it came to the construction and equipping of t he Tabernacle in the Sinai wilderness and later on of the Temple in Jerusalem, Yahweh displayed an impressive knowle dge of architecture, sacred alignments, decorative details , use of ma- terials, and construction procedures—even to the po int of showing the Earthlings involved scale models of wha t He had designed or wanted. Marduk has not been credite d with such an all-embracing knowledge; but Thoth/Ningishz idda was. In Egypt he was deemed the keeper of the secre ts of pyramid building, and as Ningishzidda he was invite d to La- gash to help orientate, design, and choose material s for the temple that was built for Ninurta. Another point of major congruence between Yahweh an d Thoth was the matter of the calendar. It is to Thot h that the first Egyptian calendar was attributed, and when he was ex- pelled from Egypt by Ra/Marduk and went (according to our findings) to Mesoamerica, where he was called \"The Winged Serpent\" (Quetzalcoatl), he devised the Aztec and M ayan calendars there. As the biblical books of Exodus, L eviticus, and Numbers make clear, Yahweh not only shifted the New Year to the \"seventh month,\" but also instituted th e week, the Sabbath, and a series of holidays. Healer; reviver of the dead who came down in a sky boat; a Divine Architect; a great astronomer and designer of calen- dars. The attributes common to Thoth and Yahweh see m overwhelming. So was Thoth Yahweh? Though known in Sumer, he was not considered there one of the Great Gods, and thus not fitting at all the epithet \"the God Most High\" that both Abraham and Melchizedek, p riest of Jerusalem, used at their encounter. Above all, h e was a"},{"pageNumber":370,"pageContent":"366 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS god of Egypt, and (unless excluded by the argument that he was Yahweh), he was one of those upon whom Yahweh s et out to make judgments. Renowned in ancient Egypt, t here could be no Pharaoh ignorant of this deity. Yet, wh en Moses and Aaron came before Pharaoh and told him, \"So say eth Yahweh, the God of Israel: Let My people go that th ey may worship Me in the desert,\" Pharaoh said: \"Who is th is Yah- weh that I should obey his words? I know not Yahweh , and the Israelites I shall not let go.\" If Yahweh where Thoth, not only would the Pharaoh n ot answer thus, but the task of Moses and Aaron would have been made easy and attainable were they just to say , Why— \"Yahweh\" is just another name for Thoth .. . And Mo ses, having been raised in the Egyptian court, would hav e had no difficulty knowing that—if that were so. If Thoth was not Yahweh, the process of elimination alone appears to leave one more candidate: Marduk. That he was a \"god most high\" is well established; the Firstborn of Enki who believed that his father was unjustly deprived of the supremacy on Earth—a supremacy to w hich he, Marduk, rather than Enid's son Ninurta, was the rightful successor. His attributes included a great many—alm ost all— the attributes of Yahweh. He possessed a Shem, a sk y- chamber, as Yahweh did; when the Babylonian king Ne bu- chadnezzar II rebuilt the sacred precinct of Babylo n, he built there an especially strengthened enclosure for the \"chariot of Marduk, the Supreme Traveler between Heaven and Ear th.\" When Marduk finally attained the supremacy on Earth , he did not discredit the other gods. On the contrary, he invited them all to reside in individual pavilions within t he sacred precinct of Babylon. There was only one catch: thei r specific powers and attributes were to pass to him—just as t he \"Fifty Names\" (i.e. rank) of Enlil had to.

Even so, Marduk did not r eign su- preme for long; soon after the institution of Mardu k as na- tional god by the Babylonians, it was matched by th eir Assyrian rivals by the institution of Ashur as \"lor d of all the gods.\" Apart from the arguments that we have mentioned in the cases of Thoth that negate an identification with a ny major Egyptian deity (and Marduk was the great Egyptian g od Ra after all), the Bible itself specifically rules out any equating of Yahweh with Marduk. Not only is Yahweh, in secti ons dealing with Babylon, portrayed as greater, mightie r, and su- preme over the gods of the Babylonians—it explicitl y fore- tells their demise by naming them. Both Isaiah (46: 1) and Jeremiah (50:2) foresaw Marduk (also known as Bel b y his Babylonian epitheht) and his son Nabu fallen and co llapsed before Yahweh on the Day of Judgment. Those prophetic words depict the two Babylonian god s as antagonists and enemies of Yahweh; Marduk (and for that matter, Nabu) could not have been Yahweh.

The cuneiform sign for Anu (AN in Sumerian) was a s tar; it had the multiple meanings of \"god, divine,\" \"hea ven,\" and this god's personal name.

Though Anu did visit Earth several times, he was re siding on Nibiru; and as the god whose abode was in Heaven , he was truly an unseen god: among the countless depict ions of deities on cylinder seals, statues and statuettes, carvings, wall paintings, amulets—his image does not appear even o nce!"},{"pageNumber":373,"pageContent":"Endpaper 369 Since Yahweh, too, was unseen and unrepresented pic tori- ally, residing in \"Heaven,\" the inevitable question that arises is, Where was the abode of Yahweh?

The Rabbi replied: \"The soul which God had planted within you; pray tell me where exactly is it?\" It was a chastened man that shook his head negatively. It was now the Rabbi's turn to be amazed and amused. \"If you do not know where your own soul is located, how can you expect to know the precise hab ita- tion of One who fills the whole world with His glor y?\" Let us note carefully what Rabbi Gamliel's answer w as: according to Jewish tradition, he said, the exact s pot in the"},{"pageNumber":374,"pageContent":"370 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS heavens where God has a dwelling is so distant that it would require a journey of 3,500 years ... How much closer can one get to the 3,600 years that it takes Nibiru to complete one orbit around the Sun? Although there are no specific texts dealing with o r de- scribing Anu's abode on Nibiru, some idea thereof c an be gained indirectly from such texts as the tale of Ad apa, occa- sional references in various texts, and even from A ssyrian depictions. It was a place—let us think of it as a royal pal- ace—that was entered through imposing gates, flanke d by towers. A pair of gods (Ningishzidda and Dumuzi are men- tioned in one instance) stood guard at the gates. I nside, Anu was seated on a throne; when Enlil and Enki were on Nibiru, or when Anu had visited Earth, they flanked the thr one, hold- ing up celestial emblems. (The Pyramid Texts of ancient Egypt, describing the After- life ascent of the Pharaoh to the celestial abode, carried aloft by an \"Ascender,\" announced for the departing king: \"The double gates of heaven are opened for thee, the dou ble gates of the sky are opened for thee\" and envisioned four scepter- holding gods announcing his arrival on the \"Imperis hable Star\"). In the Bible, too, Yahweh was described as seated o n a throne, flanked by Angels. While Ezekiel described seeing the Lord's image, shimmering like electrum, seated on a throne inside a Flying Vehicle, \"the throne of Yahw eh is in Heaven,\" the Psalms (11:4) asserted; and the Prophe ts de- scribed seeing Yahweh seated on a throne in the Hea vens. The Prophet Michaiah (\"Who is like Yahweh?\"), a con tem- porary of Elijah, told the king of Judaea who had s ought a divine oracle (I Kings chapter 22): I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and the host of heaven were standing by Him, on His right and on His left. The Prophet Isaiah recorded (chapter 6) a vision se en by him \"in the year in which king Uzziah died\" in whic h he saw God seated on His throne, attended by fiery Ang els:"},{"pageNumber":375,"pageContent":"Endpaper 371 I beheld my Lord seated on a high and lofty throne, and the train of His robe filled the great hall. Seraphs stood in attendance on Him, each one of them having six wings: with twain each covered his face, with twain each covered his legs, and with twain each one would fly. And one would call out to the other: Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts! Biblical references to Yahweh's throne went farther : they actually stated its location, in a place called Ola m. \"Thy throne is established forever, from Olam art Thou,\" the Psalms (93:2) declared; \"Thou, Yahweh, are enthrone d in Olam, enduring through the ages,\" states the Book o f Lamen- tations (5:19). Now, this is not the way these verses, and others l ike them, have been usually translated. In the King James Ver sion, for example, the quoted verse from Psalms is translated \"Thy throne is established of old, thou art from everlas ting,'' and the verse in Lamentations is rendered \"Thou, O Lord , re- mainest for ever: thy throne from generation to gen eration.\" Modern translations likewise render Olam as \"everla sting\" and \"forever\" (The New American Bible) or as \"etern ity\" and \"for ever\" (The New English Bible), revealing a n indeci- sion whether to treat the term as an adjective or a s a noun. Recognizing, however, that Olam is clearly a noun, the most recent translation by the Jewish Publication Societ y adopted \"eternity,\" an abstract noun, as a solution. The Hebrew Bible, strict in the precision of its te rminol- ogy, has other terms for stating the state of \"last ing forever.\" One is Netzah, as in Psalm 89:47 that asked, \"How l ong, Yahweh, wilt Thou hide Thyself—forever?\" Another te rm that means more precisely \"perpetuity\" is Ad, which is also usually translated \"for ever,\" as in \"his seed I wi ll make endure for ever\" in Psalm 89:30. There was no need for a third term to express the same thing.

The Psalms, in statements reminiscent of the references to the gates of Anu's abode (in Sumerian texts) and to the Gates of Heaven (in ancient Egyptian texts), also spoke o f the \"Gates of Olam\" that should open and welcome the Lo rd Yahweh as He arrives there upon His Kabod, His Cele stial Boat (24:7-10): Lift up your heads, O gates of Olam so that the King of Kabod may come in! Who is the King of Kabod? Yahweh, strong and valiant, a mighty warrior! Lift up your heads, O gates of Olam, and the King of Kabod shall come in! Who is the King of Kabod?

This, as we have pointed out, comes as close to the 3,600 (Earth) years' orbit of Nibiru as one could expect; and whi le Earth to someone arriving from space would have been the seventh planet, Nibiru to someone on Earth would indeed be seven celestial spaces away when it disappears to its apo gee. Such a disappearing—the root meaning of Olam—create s of course the \"year\" of Nibiru—an awesomely long ti me in human terms. The Prophets similarly, in numerous pa ssages, spoke of the \"Years of Olam\" as a measure of a very long time. A clear sense of periodicity, as would result from the periodic appearance and disappearance of a planet, was con- veyed by the frequent use of \"from Olam to Olam\" as a definite (though extremely long) measure of time: \" I had given you this land from Olam to Olam,\" the Lord wa s quoted as saying by Jeremiah (7:7 and 25:5). And a possible clincher for identifying Olam with Nibiru was the s tatement in Genesis 6:4 that the Nefilim, the young Anunnaki who had come to Earth from Nibiru, were the \"people of the Shem\" (the people of the rocketships), \"those who w ere from Olam.\" With the obvious familiarity of the Bible's editors , Proph- ets, and Psalmists with Mesopotamian \"myths\" and as tron- omy, it would have been peculiar not to find knowle dge of the important planet Nibiru in the Bible. It is our suggestion that yes, the Bible was keenly aware of Nibiru—and called it Olam, the ' 'disappearing planet.'' Does all that mean that therefore Anu was Yahweh? N ot necessarily ...

Moreover, the Bible recognized a g od, other than Yahweh, a \"god of other nations\" called An; hi s wor- ship is noted in the listing (II Kings 17:31) of go ds of the foreigners whom the Assyrians had resettled in Sama ria, where he is referred to as An-melekh (\"Anu the king \"). A personal name Anani, honoring Anu, and a place call ed Ana- tot, are also listed in the Bible. And the Bible ha d nothing for Yahweh that paralleled the genealogy of Anu (pa rents, spouse, children), his lifestyle (scores of concubi nes) or his fondness for his granddaughter Inanna (whose worshi p as the \"Queen of Heaven\"-Venus was deemed an abomination i n the eyes of Yahweh). And so, in spite of the similarities, there are als o too many essential differences between Anu and Yahweh for th e two to have been one and the same. Moreover, in the biblical view Yahweh was more than \"king, lord\" of Olam, as Anu was king on Nibiru. He was more than once hailed as El Olam, the God of Olam ( Genesis 21:33) and El Elohim, the God of the Elohim (Joshua 22:22, Psalms 50:1 and Psalms 136:2). The biblical suggestion that the Elohim—the \"gods,\" the Anunnaki—had a God, seems totally incredible at first, but quite logical on reflection. At the very conclusion of our first book in The Ear th Chronicles series (The 12th Planet), having told th e story of the planet Nibiru and how the Anunnaki (the biblica l Nefilim) who had come to Earth from it \"created\" Mankind, we posed the following question: And if the Nefilim were the \"gods\" who \"created\" Man on Earth, did evolution alone, on the Twelfth Planet, create the Nefilim?

Who created the Nefilim, the Anunnaki, on their pla net? The Bible itself provides the answer. Yahweh, it st ates, was not just \"a great God, a great king over all of the Elohim\" (Psalms 95:3); He was there, on Nibiru, before they had come to be on it: \"Before the Elohim upon Olam He sat,\" Psalm 61:8 explained. Just as the Anunnaki had been on Ea rth be- fore The Adam, so was Yahweh on Nibiru/Olam before the Anunnaki. The creator preceded the created. We have already explained that the seeming immortal ity of the Anunnaki \"gods\" was merely their extreme lon gevity, resulting from the fact that one Nibiru-year equale d 3,600 Earth-years; and that in fact they were born, grew old, and could (and did) die. A time measure applicable to O lam (\"days of Olam\" and \"years of Olam\") was recognized by the Prophets and Psalmist; what is more impressive is their realization that the various Elohim (the Sumerian D IN.GIR, the Akkadian Ilu) were in fact not immortal—but Yah weh, God, was. Thus, Psalm 82 envisions God passing judg ment on the Elohim and reminding them that they—the Eloh im!— are also mortal: \"God stands in the divine assembly , among the Elohim He judges,\" and tells them thus: I have said, ye are Elohim, all of you sons of the Most High; But ye shall die as men do, like any prince ye shall fall. We believe that such statements, suggesting that th e Lord Yahweh created not only the Heaven and the Earth bu t also the Elohim, the Anunnaki \"gods,\" have a bearing on a puzzle that has baffled generations of biblical scholars. It is the ques- tion why the Bible's very first verse that deals wi th the very Beginning, does not begin with the first letter of the alphabet, but rather with the second one. The significance an d symbol- ism of beginning the Beginning with the proper begi nning must have been obvious to the Bible's compilers; ye t, this is what they chose to transmit to us:"},{"pageNumber":380,"pageContent":"376 DIVINE ENCOUNTERS Breshit bara Elohim et Ha'Shamaim v'et Ha'Aretz which is commonly translated, \"In the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth.\" Since the Hebrew letters have numerical values, the first letter, Aleph (from which the Greek alpha comes) ha s the numerical value \"one, the first\"—the beginning. Why then, scholars and theologians have wondered, does the Cr eation start with the second letter, Beth, whose value is \"two, second\"? While the reason remains unknown, the result of sta rting the first verse in the first book of the Bible with an Aleph would be astounding, for it would make the sentence read thus: Ab-reshit bara Elohim, et Ha'Shamaim v'et Ha'Aretz The Father-of-Beginning created the Elohim, the Heavens, and the Earth. By this slight change, by just starting the beginni ng with the letter that begins it all, an omnipotent, omnip resent Cre- ator of All emerges from the primeval chaos: Ab-Res hit, \"the Father of Beginning.\" The best modern scientific mi nds have come up with the Big Bang theory of the beginning o f the universe—but have yet to explain who caused the Big Bang to happen. Were Genesis to begin as it should have, the Bible—which offers a precise tale of Evolution and adheres to the most sensible cosmogony—would have also give n us the answer: the Creator who was there to create it all. And all at once Science and Religion, Physics and M eta- physics, converge into one single answer that confo rms to the credo of Jewish monotheism: \"I am Yahweh, there is none beside me!\" It is a credo that carried the Pro phets, and us with them, from the arena of gods to the God who embraces the universe. One can only speculate why the Bible's editors, who schol- ars believe canonized the Torah (the first five boo ks of the"},{"pageNumber":381,"pageContent":"Endpaper 377 Bible) during the Babylonian exile, omitted the Ale ph. Was it in order to avoid offending their Babylonian exi lers (be- cause a claim that Yahweh had created the Anunnaki- gods would have not excluded Marduk)? But what is, we be lieve, not to be doubted is that at one time the first wor d in the first verse in the Bible did begin with the first l etter of the alphabet. This certainty is based on the statements in the Book of Revelation (\"The Apocalypse of St. John\" in the New Testament), in which God announces thus: I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last. The statement, repeated three times (1:8, 21:6, 22: 13), ap- plies the first letter of the alphabet (by its Gree k name) to the Beginning, to the divine First, and the last le tter of the (Greek) alphabet to me End, to God being the Last o f all as He has been the First of All. That this had been the case at the beginning of Gen esis is confirmed, we believe, by the certainty that the st atements in Revelation harken back to the Hebrew scriptures fro m which the parallel verses in Isaiah (41:6, 42:8, 44:6) we re taken, the verses in which Yahweh proclaims His absoluteness a nd uniqueness: I, Yahweh, was the First And the Last I will also be! I am the First and I am the Last; There are no Elohim without Me! I am He, 1 am the First, I am the Last as well.

And God said further to Moses: Thus shalt say unto the Children of Israel: Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you; This is my name unto Olam, this is my appellation unto all generations. (Exodus 3:13-15) The statement, Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh, has been the subj ect of discussion, analysis, and interpretation by gene rations of theologians, biblical scholars, and linguists. The King James Version translates it \"I am that I am ... I am hath sent me to you.\" Other more modern translations adopt \"I am , that is who I am ... I am has sent you.\" The most recent transla- tion by the Jewish Publication Society prefers to l eave the Hebrew intact, providing the footnote, \"meaning of the He- brew uncertain.\" The key to understanding the answer given during th is Divine Encounter are the grammatical tenses employe d here. Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh is not given in the present but i n the future tense. In simple parlance it states: \"Whoeve r I shall be, I shall be.\" And the Divine Name that is reveal ed to a mortal for the first time (in the conversation Mose s is told that the sacred name, the Tetragrammaton YHWH, had not been revealed even to Abraham) combines the three t enses from the root meaning \"To Be\"—the One who was, who is,"},{"pageNumber":383,"pageContent":"Endpaper 379 and who shall be. It is an answer and a name that b efit the biblical concept of Yahweh as eternally existing—On e who was, who is, and who shall continue to be. A frequent form of stating this everlasting nature of the biblical God is the expression \"Thou art from Olam to Olam.\" It is usually translated, \"Thou art everlast ing;\" this conveys undoubtedly the sense of the statement, but not its precise meaning. Literally taken it suggests that t he existence and reign of Yahweh extended from one Olam to anoth er— that He was \"king, lord\" not only of the one Olam t hat was the equivalent of the Mesopotamian Nibiru—but o f other Olams, of other worlds! No less than eleven times, the Bible refers to Yahw eh's abode, domain, and \"kingdom\" using the term Olamim. the plural of Olam—a domain, an abode, a kingdom that e ncom- passes many worlds. It is an expansion of Yahweh's Lordship beyond the notion of a \"national god\" to that of a Judge of all the nations; beyond the Earth and beyond Nibiru , to the \"Heavens of Heaven\" (Deuteronomy 10:14, I Kings 8:2 7, II Chronicles 2:5 and 6:18) that encompass not only th e Solar System but even the distant stars (Deuteronomy 4:19 , Ecclesi- astes 12:2).

All else—the celestial planetary \"gods,\" Nibiru tha t re- made our Solar System and remakes the Earth on its near passages, the Anunnaki \"Elohim,\" Mankind, nations, kings—all are His manifestations and His instrument s, car- rying out a divine and universal everlasting plan. In a way we are all His Angels, and when the time comes for Ear thlings to travel in space and emulate the Anunnaki, on some o ther world, we too shall only be carrying out a destined future. It is an image of a universal Lord that is best sum med up in the hymnal prayer Adon Olam that is recited as a majestic song in Jewish synagogue services on festivals, on the Sab- bath, and on each and every day of the year: Lord of the universe, who has reigned Ere all that exists had yet been created.
