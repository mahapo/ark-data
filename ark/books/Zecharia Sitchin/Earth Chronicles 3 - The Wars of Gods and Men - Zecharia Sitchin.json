Those and other scrolls found in the area in subsequent y ears—collec- tively spoken of as the Dead Sea Scrolls—had lain u ndisturbed for nearly two thousand years, carefully wrapped and hi dden away during the turbulent years when Judea challenged th e might of the Roman empire. Was this part of the official library of Jerusalem, carted away to safety before the city and its temple fell in A . D . 70, or—as most scholars assume—a library of the Essenes, a sect of hermits with messianic preoccupations? The opinions are divided, for the li- brary contained both traditional biblical texts as well as writings dealing with the sect's customs, organization, and beliefs. One of the longest and most complete scrolls, and p erhaps the most dramatic, deals with a future war, a kind of F inal War. Titled by scholars The War of the Sons of Light Against th e Sons of Dark- ness, it envisages spreading warfare—local battles that will first in- volve Judea's immediate neighbors, which shall incr ease in feroc- ity and scope until the whole ancient world would b e engulfed: \"The first engagement of the Sons of Light against the Sons of Darkness, that is against the army of Belial, shall be an attack upon the troops of Edom, Moab, the Ammonites and the Phi listine area; then upon that of the Kittians of Assyria: and upon those violators of the Covenant who give them aid. . . .\" And after those battles, \"they shall advance upon the Kittians of Egypt\" and \"in due time . . . against the kings of the north.\" In this War of Men, the scroll prophesied, the God of Israel shall take an active role: On the day the Kittians fall, there shall be mighty combat and carnage, in the presence of the God of Israel; For that is the day which He appointed of old for t he final bat- tle against the Sons of Darkness. 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"2 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The Prophet Ezekiel had already prophesied the Last Battle, \"in the latter days,\" involving Gog and Magog, in which the Lord himself shall \" s mi te thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thine right hand.\" But the Dead Sea scroll went further, foreseeing the actual particip ation of many gods in the battles, engaged in combat side by side with mortal men: On that day, the Company of the Divine and the Cong regation of the Mortals shall engage side by side in combat and carnage. The Sons of Light shall battle against the Sons of Darkness with a show of godlike might, amid uproarious tumul t, amid the war cries of gods and men. Though Crusaders. Saracens, and countless others in historical times have gone to war \"in the name of God,\" the be lief that in a war to come the Lord himself shall be actually pres ent on the bat- tlefield, and that gods and men would fight side by side, sounds as fantasy, to be treated allegorically at best. Yet i t is not as extraordi- nary a notion as it may appear to be, for in earlie r times, it was in- deed believed that the Wars of Men were not only de creed by the gods but were also fought with the gods' active par ticipation. One of the most romanticized wars, when \"love had l aunched a thousand ships,\" was the War of Troy, between the A chaean Greeks and the Trojans, ft was, know we not, launch ed by the Greeks to force the Trojans to return the beautiful Helen to her law- ful spouse. Yet an epic Greek tale, the Kypria, rep resented the war as a premeditated scheme by the great god Zeus: There was a time when thousands upon thousands of m en en- cumbered the broad bosom of the Earth. And having p ity on them, Zeus in his great wisdom resolved to lighten Earth's bur- den. So he caused the strife at Ilion (Troy) to that end ; that through death he might make a void in the race of men. Homer, the Greek storyteller who related the war's events in the Iliad, blamed the whim of the gods for instigating the conflict and for turning and twisting it to its ultimate major p roportions. Acting directly and indirectly, sometimes seen and sometim es unseen, the various gods nudged the principal actors of this hu man drama to their fates. And behind it all was Jove (Jupiter/Ze us): \"While the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 3 other gods and the armed warriors on the plain slep t soundly, Jove was wakeful, for he was thinking how to do honor to Achilles and destroy much people at the ships of the Achaeans.\" Even before the battle was joined, the god Apollo b egan the hos- tilities: \"He sat himself down away from the ships with a face as dark as night, and his silver bow rang death as he shot his arrow in the midst of them [the Achaeans] . . . For nine who le days he shot his arrows among the people. . . . And all day long , the pyres of the dead were burning.\" When the contending sides a greed to postpone hostilities so that their leaders might de cide the issue in hand-to-hand combat, the unhappy gods instructed th e goddess Minerva: \"Go at once into the Trojan and Achaean ho sts, and con- trive that the Trojans shall be the first to break their oaths and set upon the Achaeans.\" Eager for the mission, Minerva \"shot through the sky as some brilliant meteor ... a fier y train of light followed in her wake.\" Later on, lest the raging wa rfare cease for the night, Minerva turned night into day by lightin g up the battle- field: She \"lifted the thick veil of darkness from their eyes, and much light fell upon them, both on the side of the ships and on where the fight was raging; and the Achaeans could see Hector and all his men.\" As the battles raged on and on, sometimes pitching one hero against another, the gods, too, kept a watchful eye over individual warriors, swooping down to snatch away a beleaguere d hero or to steady a driverless chariot. But when the gods and goddesses, find- ing themselves on opposing sides, began to hurt eac h other, Zeus called a halt, ordering them to keep out of the mor tals' fighting. The respite did not last long, for many of the lead ing combatants were sons of gods or goddesses (by human mates). Es pecially an- gered was Mars, when his son Ascalaphus was pierced to death by one of the Achaeans. \"Do not blame me, ye gods that dwell in heaven, if I go to the ships of the Achaeans and av enge the death of my son,\" Mars announced to the other Immortals, \"ev en if in the end I shall be struck by Jove's lightning and shall lie in blood and dust among the corpses.\" \"So long as the gods held themselves aloof from the mortal war- riors,\" wrote Homer, \"the Achaeans were triumphant, for Achil- les who has long refused to fight was now with them .\" But in view of the mounting anger among the gods, and the help the Achaeans were now getting from the demigod Achilles, Jove ch anged his mind:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"4 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN \"For my own part, I shall stay here. seated on Mount Olympus, and look on in peace. But you others, do go among the Trojans and Achaean s, and help either side as you might be disposed.\" Thus spake Jove, and gave the word for war; Whereon the gods took their several sides and went into battle. The Battle of Troy, indeed Troy itself, were long t hought of as just part of the fascinating but incredible Greek l egends, which scholars have tolerantly called mythology. Troy and the events pertaining to it were still considered to be purely mythological when Charles McLaren suggested, back in 1822, that a certain mound in eastern Turkey, called Hissarlik. was the site of the Ho- meric Troy. It was only when a businessman named He inrich Schliemann, risking his own money, came up with spe ctacular dis- coveries as he dug up the mound in 1870, that schol ars began to acknowledge the existence of Troy. It is now accept ed that the Bat- tle of Troy had actually taken place in the thirtee nth century B.C. It was then, according to the Greek sources, that gods and men had fought side by side: in such beliefs the Greeks wer e not alone. In those days, though the tip of Asia Minor facing Europe and the Aegean Sea were dotted with what were essential ly Greek set- tlements, Asia Minor proper was dominated by the Hi ttites. Known at first to modem scholars only from biblical references, then from Egyptian inscriptions, the Hittites and t heir kingdom— Hatti—also came to life as archaeologists began to uncover their ancient cities. The decipherment of the Hittite script and their In do-European language made it possible to trace their origins to the second millennium B.C., when Aryan tribes began to migrate from the Caucasus area—some southeast to India, others south west to Asia Minor. The Hittite kingdom nourished circa 1750 B.C . and began to decline five hundred years later. It was then th at the Hittites were harassed by incursions from across the Aegean Sea. The Hit- tiles spoke of the invaders as the people of Achiya wa; many schol- ars believe that they were the very same people who m Homer called Achioi—the Achaeans, whose attack upon the w estern tip of Asia Minor he immortalized in the Iliad. For centuries prior to the war of Troy, the Hittite s expanded their kingdom to imperial proportions, claiming to have done so upon the orders of their supreme god TESHUB (\"The S tormer\")."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 5 His olden title was \"Storm God Whose Strength Makes Dead.\" and Hittite kings sometimes claimed that the god ha d actually taken a hand in the battle: \"The mighty Stormgod, my Lord ,\" [wrote the king Murshilis]. \"showed his divine power and shot a thunder- bolt\" at the enemy, helping to defeat it. Also aidi ng the Hittites in battle was the goddess ISHTAR, whose epithet was \"L ady of the battlefield.\" It was to her \"Divine Power\" that man y a victory was attributed, as she \"came down [from the skies] to smile the hostile countries.\" Hittite influence, as many references in the Old Te stament indi- cate, extended south into Canaan; but they were the re as settlers, not as conquerors. While they treated Canaan as a n eutral zone, laying to it no claim, this was not the attitude of the Egyptians. Re- peatedly the Pharaohs sought to extend their rule n orthward to Ca- naan and the Cedar Land (Lebanon); they succeeded i n doing so. circa 1470 B.C.. when they defeated a coalition of Canaanite kings at Megiddo. The Old Testament, and inscriptions left by the H i t t i t e s ' foes, pictured the Hittites as expert warriors who perfec ted the use of the chariot in the ancient Near East. But the Hittites' own inscriptions suggest that they went to war only when the gods ga ve the word, that the enemy was offered a chance to surrender pe acefully before hostilities began, and that once a war was won, the Hittites were satisfied to receive tribute and take captives: the cities were not sacked; the populace was not massacred. But Thothmes III. the Pharaoh who was victorious at the battle of Megiddo. was proud to say in his inscriptions: \" Now his maj- esty went north, plundering towns and laying encamp ments waste.\" Of a vanquished king the Pharaoh wrote: \"I desolated his towns, set fire to his encampments, made mounds of them; t h e i r resettlement can never take place. All the people I captured. I made prisoners; their countless cattle I carried off, an d their goods as well. I took away every resource of life; I cut dow n their grain and felled all their groves and all their pleasant tree s. I totally destroyed it.\" It was all done, the Pharaoh wrote, on the say -so of AMON- RA, his god. The vicious nature of Egyptian warfare and the piti less destruc- tiveness they inflicted upon a vanquished foe were subjects of boastful inscriptions. The Pharaoh Pepi I, for exam ple, commemo- rated his victory over the Asiatic \"sand-dwellers\" in a poem which hailed the army which \"hacked up the land of the sa nd-dwellers . . . cut down its fig trees and vines . . . ca st fire into all its dwell-"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"6 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN ings. killed its people by many tens of thousands.\" The commem- orative inscriptions were accompanied by vivid depi ctions of the battle scenes (Fig. 1). Adhering to this wanton tradition, the Pharaoh Pi-A nkhy, who sent troops from Upper Egypt to subdue the rebellio us Lower Egypt, was enraged by his generals' suggestion that adversaries who survived the battle be spared. Vowing \"destruct ion forever,\" the Pharaoh announced that he would conic to the ca ptured city \"to ruin that which had remained.\" For this, he stated, \"My father Amon praises me.\" The god Amon, to whose battle orders the Egyptians attributed their viciousness, found his match in the God of Is rael. In the words of the Prophet Jeremiah, \"Thus sayeth the Lor d of Hosts, the God of Israel: 'I will punish Amon, god of Theb es, and those who trust in him, and shall bring retribution upon Egypt and its gods, its Pharaoh and its kings.' \" This, we learn from the Bible, was an ongoing confrontation; nearly a thousand yea rs earlier, in the days of the Exodus, Yahweh, the God of Israel, smote Egypt with a scries of afflictions intended not only to s often the heart of its ruler but also as \"judgments against all the go ds of Egypt.\" The miraculous departure of the Israelites out of b ondage in Egypt to the Promised Land was attributed in the bi blical tale of Exodus to the direct intervention of Yahweh in thos e momentous events:"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 7 And they journeyed from Succoth and encamped at Etham, at the edge of the desert. And Yahweh went forth before them, by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light . There then ensued a sea battle of which the Pharaoh preferred to leave no inscriptions; we know of it from the Book of Exodus: And the heart of the Pharaoh and his servants was changed with respect to the people. . . . And the Egyptians pursued after them, and they overtook them encamped by the sea. . . . And Yahweh drove back the sea with a strong east wi nd all that night, and dried up the waters; and the waters separated. And the Children of Israel went into the midst of t he sea upon dry ground. . . . At daybreak, when the Egyptians realized what had h appened, the Pharaoh ordered his chariots after the Israelit es. But: It came to pass at the time of the morning watch that Yahweh surveyed the camp of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and cloud; And he stunned the Egyptian camp and loosened the wheels of their chariots, making their driving difficult. And the Egyptians said: \"Let us flee from the Israelites, for Yahweh fighteth for them against Egypt.\" But the Egyptian ruler pursuing the Israelites orde red his chariots to press on with the attack. The result was calamit ous for the Egyptians: And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of the Pharaoh that was following them; not one of them remained. . . . And Israel beheld the great power which Yahweh had shown upon the Egyptians."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"8 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The biblical language is almost identical to the wo rds of a later Pharaoh, Ramses II, used by h i m to describe the mir aculous ap- pearance of\" Amon-Ra at his side during a decisive battle fought with the Hittites in 1286 B.C. Taking place at the fortress of Kadesh in Lebanon, the battle pit- ted four divisions of the Pharaoh Ramses II against forces mobi- lized by the Hittite king Muwatallis from all parts of his empire. It ended with an Egyptian retreat, cutting short Egypt 's northward thrust toward Syria and Mesopotamia. It also draine d H i t t i t e re- sources and left them weakened and exposed. The Hittite victory might have been more decisive, for they had almost captured the Pharaoh himself. Only partial H ittite inscrip- tions dealing with the battle have been found; but Ramses, on his return to Egypt, saw fit to describe in detail the miracle of his es- cape. Fig. 2 His inscriptions on temple walls, accompanied by de tailed illus- trations (Fig. 2), relate how the Egyptian armies h ad reached Ka- desh and encamped south of it. readying themselves for the battle. Surprisingly the Hittite enemy did not step forward to do battle. Ramses then ordered two of his divisions to advance toward the fortress. It was then that the Hittite chariots app eared as if from no- where, attacking the advancing divisions from behin d and causing havoc in the encampments of the two others. As the Egyptian troops began to flee in panic. Rams es suddenly realized that \"His Majesty was a l l alone with his b odyguard\": and \"when the king looked behind him, he saw that he wa s blocked off by 2,500 chariots\"—not his own but of the Hittites. Abandoned by"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 9 his officers, charioteers, and infantry, Ramses tur ned to his god, reminding him that he finds himself in this predica ment only be- cause he had followed the god's orders: And His Majesty said: \"What now, my Father Amon? Has a father forgotten his son? Have I ever done anything without you? Whatever I did or did not do, was it not in accordance with your commands?\" Reminding the Egyptian god that the enemy was behol den to other gods, Ramses went on to ask: \"What are these Asiatics to you. O Amon? These wretches who know nothing of the e, O God?\" As Ramses went on pleading with his god Amon to sav e him, for the god's powers were greater than those of \"millio ns of foot sol- diers, of hundreds of thousands of chariot-soldiers ,\" a miracle happened: the god showed up on the battlefield! Amon heard when I called him. He held out his hand to me, and I rejoiced. He stood behind me and called out: \"Forward! Forward! Ramses, beloved of Amon, I am with thee!\" Following the command of his god, Ramses tore into the enemy troops. Under the influence of the god the Hittites were inexplica- bly enfeebled: \"their hands dropped to their sides, they were un- able to shoot their arrows nor raise their spears.\" And they called unto one another: \"This is no mortal who is among u s: this is a mighty god; his deeds are not the deeds of a man; a god is in his limbs.\" Thus unopposed, slaying the enemy left and right, Ramses managed to escape. After the death of Muwatallis, Egypt and the Hittit e kingdom signed a peace treaty, and the reigning Pharaoh too k a Hittite prin- cess to be his principal wife. The peace was needed because not only the Hittites but also the Egyptians were incre asingly coming under attack by \"Peoples of the Sea\"—invaders from Crete and other Greek islands. They gained a foothold on the Mediterranean coast of Canaan to become the biblical Philistines; but their attacks on Egypt proper were beaten back by the Pharaoh Ram ses III, who"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"10 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN commemorated the battle scenes on temple walls (Fig . 3). He at- tributed his victories to his strict adherence to \" the plans of the All- Lord, my august divine father, the Lord of the Gods .\" It was to his god Amon-Ra, Ramses wrote, that the credit for the victories was due: for it was \"Amon-Ra who was after them, destro ying them.\" Fig. 3 The bloody trail of man's war against his fellow me n in behalf of the gods now takes us back to Mesopotamia—the Land Between the Rivers (Euphrates and Tigris)—the biblical Land of Shin'ar. There, as is related in Genesis 11, the first-ever cities arose, with buildings made with bricks and towers that scraped the skies. It was there that recorded history began; it was there that prehistory began with the settlements of the Olden Gods. It is a tale of long ago, which we will soon unfold . But right now let us return to a thousand years before the dramat ic times of Ram- ses II in Egypt. Then, in faraway Mesopotamia, king ship was taken over by an ambitious young man. He was called Sharru- Kin—\"Righteous Ruler\": our textbooks call him Sargo n the First. He built a new capital city, calling it Agade, and established the kingdom of Akkad. The Akkadian language, written in a wedge- like (cuneiform) script, was the mother tongue of a ll the Semitic languages, of which Hebrew and Arabic are still in use. Reigning for the better part of the twenty-fourth c entury B.C., Sargon attributed his long reign (fifty-four years) to the special sta- tus granted him by the Great Gods, who made him \"Ov erseer of Ishtar. Anointed Priest of ANU. Great Righteous She pherd of ENLIL.\" It was Enlil, Sargon wrote, \"who did not le t anybody oppose Sargon\" and who gave Sargon \"the region from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea\" (from the Mediterranean to th e Persian"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 11 Gulf). It was therefore to \"the gate of the House o f Enlil\" that Sar- gon brought the captive kings, ropes tied to the do g collars around their necks. In one of his campaigns across the Zagros mountains , Sargon experienced the same godly feat that the combatants at Troy had witnessed. As he '\"was moving into the land of Wara hshi . . . when he pressed forward in the darkness . . . Ishta r made a light to shine for him.\" Thus was Sargon able to \"penetrate the gloom\" of darkness as he led his troops through the mountain passes of to- day's Luristan. The Akkadian dynasty begun by Sargon reached its pe ak under his grandson Naram-Sin (\"Whom the god Sin loves\"). His con- quests, Naram-Sin wrote on his monuments, were poss ible be- cause his god had armed him with a unique weapon, t he \"Weapon of the God,\" and because the other gods granted him their explicit consent—or even invited him—to enter their regions. Naram-Sin's principal thrust was to the northwest, and his con- quests included the city-state of Ebla, whose recen tly discovered archive of clay tablets has caused great scientific interest: \"Al- though since the time of the separation of mankind none of the kings has ever destroyed Annan and Ibla, the god Ne rgal did open up the path for the mighty Naram-Sin and gave him A nnan and Ibla. He also gave him as a present Amanus, the Ced ar Mountain, to the Upper Sea.\" Just as Naram-Sin could attribute his successful ca mpaigns to his heeding the commands of his gods, so was his downfa ll attributed to his going to war against the word of the gods. S cholars have put together from fragments of several versions a text that has been ti- tled The Legend of Naram-Sin. Speaking in the first person. Naram- Sin explains in this talc of woe that his troubles began when the goddess Ishtar \"changed her plan\" and the gods gave their blessing to \"seven kings, brothers, glorious and noble; their t roops numbered 360,000.\" Coming from what is now Iran, they invade d the mountain lands of Gutium and Elam to the east of Mesopotamia and were threat- ening Akkad itself. Naram-Sin asked the gods what t o do and was told to put aside his weapons and, instead of going to b attle, to go sleep with his wife (but, for some deep reason, avoid mak ing love): The gods reply to him: \"O Naram-Sin, this is our word: This army against you . . . Bind your weapons, in a corner place them!"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"12 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Hold back your boldness, stay at home! Together with your wife, in bed go sleep. but with her you must not . . . Out of your land, unto the enemy, you must not go.\" But Naram-Sin. announcing that he would rely on his own weap- ons, decided to attack the enemy in spite of the go ds' advice. \"When the first year arrived, I sent out 120,000 tr oops, but none of them returned alive,\" Naram-Sin confessed in his in scription. More troops were annihilated in the second and thir d years, and Akkad was succumbing to death and hunger. On the fo urth anni- versary of the unauthorized war, Naram-Sin appealed to the great god Ea to overrule Ishtar and put his case before t he other gods. They advised him to desist from further fighting, p romising that \"in days to come, Enlil will summon perdition upon the Sons of Evil,\" and Akkad would have respite. The promised era of peace lasted about three centur ies, during which the olden part of Mesopotamia. Sumer, reemerg ed as the center of kingship, and the oldest urban centers of the ancient world —Ur, Nippur, Lagash, Isin, Larsa—flourished again. Sumer, un- der the kings of Ur, was the center of an empire th at encompassed the whole of the ancient Near East. But toward the end of the third millennium B.C., the land became the arena for cont ending loyalties and opposing armies; and then that great civilizati on—man's first known civilization—succumbed to a major catastrophe of unprece- dented proportions. It was a fateful event which, we believe, was echoe d in biblical tales. It was an event whose memory lingered on for a long time, commemorated and bewailed in numerous lamentation p oems; they gave a very graphic description of the havoc a nd desolation that befell that great heartland of ancient civiliz ation. It was, those Mesopotamian texts stated, a catastrophe that befel l Sumer as a re- sult of a decision of the great gods sitting in cou ncil. It took southern Mesopotamia almost a century to be resettled and another century to fully recover from the divin e annihilation. By then, the center of Mesopotamian power had shift ed northward, to Babylon. There, a new empire was to rise, procla iming an ambi- tious god. MARDUK, as its supreme deity. Circa 1800 B.C.. Hammurabi, the king renowned for h is law code, ascended the throne in Babylon and began to e xtend its boundaries. According to his inscriptions the gods not only told"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 13 him if and when to launch his military campaigns bu t were literally leading his armies: Through the power of the great gods the king, beloved of the god Marduk. reestablished the foundations of Sumer and Akkad. Upon the command of Anu. and with Enlil advancing in front of his army, with the mighty powers which the great gods gave hi m. he was no match for the army of Emutbal and its king Rim-Sin. . . . To defeat more enemies the god Marduk granted Hammu rabi a \"powerful weapon\" called \"Great Power of Marduk\": With the Powerful Weapon with which Marduk proclaimed his triumphs, the hero [Hammurabi] overthrew in battle the armies of Eshnuna, Subartu and Gutium. . . . With the \"Great Power of Marduk\" he overthrew the armies of Sutium, Turukku, Kamu. . . . With the Mighty Power which Anu and Enlil had given him he defeated all his enemies as far as the country of Subartu. But before long Babylon had to share its might with a new rival to its north—Assyria, where not Marduk but the bear ded god ASHUR (\"The All-Seeing\") was proclaimed supreme. Wh ile Babylon tangled with the lands to its south and eas t, the Assyrians extended their rule northward and westward, as far as \"the country of Lebanon, on the shores of the Great Sea.\" These were lands in the domains of the gods NINURTA and ADAD, and the A ssyrian kings carefully noted that they launched their camp aigns on the ex- plicit commands of these great gods. Thus, Tiglat-P ileser I com- memorated his wars, in the twelfth century B.C., in the following words: Tiglat-Pileser. the legitimate king, king of the wo rld, king of Assyria, king of all the four regions of the earth; The courageous hero who is guided by the trust-insp iring commands given by Ashur and Ninurta, the great gods , his lords, thus overthrowing his enemies. . . ."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"14 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN At the command of my lord Ashur, my hand conquered from be- yond the lower Zab River to the Upper Sea which is in the west.

Upon the command of Anu and Adad, the great gods, m y lords, I went to the Lebanon mountains; I cut cedar beams for the temples of Anu and Adad. In assuming the title \"king of the world, king of t he four regions of the Earth,\" the Assyrian kings directly challeng ed Babylon, for Babylon encompassed the ancient region of Sumerand Akkad. To legitimize their claim the Assyrian kings had to ta ke control of those olden cities where the Great Gods had their h omes in olden times; but the way to these sites was blocked by Ba bylon. The feat was achieved in the ninth century B . C . by Shalmaneser III; he said thus in his inscriptions: I marched against Akkad to avenge . . . and inflict ed de- feat. ... I entered Kutha, Babylon and Borsippa. I offered sacrifices to the gods of the sacred citi es of Akkad.

Thus I reduced h is country.\" The siege of Jerusalem offers several interesting a spects. It had no direct cause but only an indirect one: the force d holding there of the loyal king of Ekron. The \"awe-inspiring Bril liance, the weapon of Ashur,\" which was employed to \"overwhelm the strong cities\" of Phoenicia and Philistia, was not used against Je- rusalem. And the customary inscriptional ending—\"I fought with them and inflicted defeat upon them\"—is missing in the case of Je- rusalem; Sennacherib merely reduced the size of Jud ea by giving its outlying areas to neighboring kings. Moreover, the usual claim that a land or a city was attacked upon the \"trustworthy orders\" of the god Ashur was also absent in the case of Jerusalem; one wonders whether all this mea nt that the at- tack on the city was an unauthorized attack—a whim of Sennach- erib himself but not the wish of his god? This intriguing possibility becomes a convincing pr obability as we read the other side of the story—for such an oth er side docs exist in the Old Testament. While Sennacherib glossed over his failure to captu re Jerusalem, the tale in II Kings, chapters 18 and 19, offers th e full story. We learn from the biblical report that \"in the fourtee nth year of king Hezekiah Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, came upo n all the walled cities of Judea and captured them.\" He then sent two of his generals with a large army to Jerusalem, the capita l. But instead of storming the city, the Assyrian general Rab-Shakeh began a verbal exchange with the city's leaders—an exchange he ins isted on con-"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 17 ducting in Hebrew so that the whole populace might understand him. What did he have to say that the populace ought to have known? As the biblical text makes clear, the verbal exchan ges concerned the question of whether the Assyrian invasion of Ju dea was autho- rized by the Lord Yahweh! \"And Rab-Shakeh said unto them: Speak ye now to Hez ekiah: Thus sayeth the great king, the king of Assyria: Wh at confidence is it wherein thou trusteth?\" If ye say unto me: \"We trust in Yahweh, our God\" . . . Now then. Am I come against this place to destroy it without Yahweh? Yahweh did say unto me: \"Go up against this land, and destroy it!\" The more the ministers of king Hezekiah. standing u pon the city's walls, pleaded with Rab-Shakeh to cease sayi ng these untrue things in Hebrew and to deliver his message in the then language of diplomacy, Aramaic, the more did Rab-Shakeh approac h the walls to shout his words in Hebrew for a l l to hear. Soon he began to use foul language against Hezekiah's emissaries; then h e started to de- grade the king himself. Carried away by his own ora tory. Rab- Shakeh abandoned his claim to have had Yahweh's per mission to attack Jerusalem and went on to belittle the God hi mself. When Hezekiah was told of the blasphemy, \"he rent h is clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth and went into th e House of Yahweh. . . . And he sent word to the Prophet Isaia h, saying: 'This is a day of trouble, of rebuke, of blasphemy. . . . May Yah- weh thy Lord hear all the words of Rab-Shakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria hath sent to scorn the Living G od.' And the word of the Lord Yahweh came back through his Proph et Isaiah: 'Concerning the king of Assyria . . . the way that he came, he shall return; and unto this city he shall not come in . . . for I shall defend this city to save it.' \" And it came to pass that night, that the angel of Yahweh went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand;"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"18 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN and at sunrise, lo and behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria. departed, and journeyed back and dwelt in Nineveh. According to the Old Testament, after Sennacherib h ad returned to Nineveh, \"it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, that Adrammelech and Sharezzer his sons smote him with a sword; and they escaped unto the l and of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.\" Ass yrian records confirm the biblical statement: Sennacherib was ind eed so assas- sinated, and his younger son Esarhaddon did ascend the throne af- ter him. An inscription of Esarhaddon known as Prism B descr ibes the circumstances more fully. On the command of the gre at gods, Sennacherib had publicly proclaimed his younger son as successor. \"He called together the people of Assyria, young an d old, and he made my brothers, the male offspring of my father, take a solemn oath in the presence of the gods of Assyria ... in order to secure my succession.\" The brothers then broke their oath, k i l l i n g Sennacherib and seeking to kill Esarhaddon. But the gods snatched him away \"and made me stay in a hiding place . . . preserving me for kingship.\" After a period of turmoil Esarhaddon received \"a tr ustworthy command from the gods: 'Go, do not delay! We will m arch with you!' \" The deity who was delegated to accompany Esarhaddon was Ishtar. As his brothers' forces came out of Nineveh to beat off his attack on the capital, \"Ishtar, the Lady of Battle, who wished me to be her high priest, stood at my side. She broke their bows, scat- tered their orderly battle array.\" Once the Ninevit e troops were disorganized, Ishtar addressed them in behalf of Es arhaddon. \"Upon her lofty command, they went over in masses t o me and rallied behind me,\" Esarhaddon wrote, \"and recogniz ed me as their king.\" Both Esarhaddon and his son and successor Ashurbani pal at- tempted to advance against Egypt, and both employed Weapons of Brilliance in the battles. \"The terror-inspiring Brilliance of Ashur,\" Ashurbanipal wrote, \"blinded the Pharaoh so that he be- came a madman.\" Other inscriptions of Ashurbanipal suggest that thi s weapon, which emitted an intense, blinding brightness, was worn by the"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 19 gods as part of their headgear. In one instance an enemy \"was blinded by the brightness from the god-head.\" In an other, \"Ishtar. who dwells in Arbela, clad in Divine Fire and sport ing the Radiant Headwear, rained flames upon Arabia.\" The Old Testament, too, refers to such a Weapon of Brilliance that could blind. When the Angels (literally, emiss aries) of the Lord came to Sodom prior to its destruction, the po pulace at- tempted to break down the door of the house in whic h they were resting. So the Angels \"smote the people at the ent rance of the house with blindness . . . and they were unable to find the door- way.\" As Assyria rose to supremacy, even extending its ru le over Lower Egypt, its kings, in the words of the Lord th rough his prophet Isaiah, forgot that they were only an instr ument of the Lord: \"Ho Assyria, the whip of mine anger! My wrath is the rod in their hands; against impious nations I send them; u pon people who have crossed me I charge them.\" But the Assyrian ki ngs went be- yond mere punishment; \"rather, it is in its heart t o annihilate and wipe out nations not few.\" This went beyond the int ention of the God; therefore, the Lord Yahweh announced, \"I shall hold to ac- count the king of Assyria, on account of the fruits of the growing haughtiness of his heart.\" The biblical prophecies predicting the downfall of Assyria in- deed came true: As invaders from the north and cast were joined by rebellious Babylonians from the south, Ashur, the r eligious capi- tal, fell in 614 B.C., and Nineveh, the royal capit al, was captured and sacked two years later. The great Assyria was n o more. The disintegration of the Assyrian empire was seize d by vassal kings in Egypt and Babylonia as an opportunity to a ttempt the res- toration of their own hegemonies. The lands between them were once again the cherished prize, and the Egyptians, under the Pha- raoh Necho, were quicker in invading these territor ies. In Babylonia, Nebuchadnezzar II—as recorded in his inscrip- tions—was ordered by the god Marduk to march his ar my west- ward. The expedition was made possible because \"ano ther god,\" the one who held the original sovereignty over the area, \"has not desired the cedar land\" anymore; and now \"a foreign enemy was ruling and robbing it.\" In Jerusalem the word of the Lord Yahweh through hi s prophet Jeremiah was to side with Babylon, for the Lord Yah weh—calling"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"20 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Nebuchadnezzar \"'my servant\"—had decided to make th e Babylo- nian king the instrument of His wrath against the g ods of Egypt: Thus sayeth Yahweh, Lord of Hosts, the God of Israe l: \"Indeed will I send for and fetch Nebuchadnezzar, m y ser- vant. . . .

And he will break the obelisks of Heliopolis, the one which is in the land of Egypt; The houses of the gods of Egypt shall he bum with f ire.\" In the course of this campaign the Lord Yahweh anno unced that Jerusalem, too. shall be punished on account of its people's sins, having taken up the worship of the \"Queen of Heaven \" and of the gods of Egypt: \"Mine anger and my fury shall be pou red upon this place. . . and it shall burn and shall not be quenc hed. . . .

The king who was to fulfill this promise and enable the re- building of the Temple of Jerusalem was Cyrus. His ancestors, speaking an Indo-European language, are believed to have mi- grated south from the Caspian Sea area to the provi nce of Anshan along the eastern coast of the Persian Gulf. There Hakham-Anish (\"Wise Man\"), the leader of the migrants, began a d ynasty we call Achaemenid; his descendants—Cyrus, Darius. Xerxes—m ade his- tory as rulers of what was to be the Persian empire . When Cyrus ascended the throne of Anshan in 549 B.C ., his land was a distant province of Elam and Media. In B abylon, then the center of power, the kingship was held by Nabun aid, who be- came king under most unusual circumstances: not by the custom- ary choice by the god Marduk. but as a result of a unique pact between a High Priestess (the mother of Nabunaid) a nd the god"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"The Wars of Man 21 Sin.

He con- founded the rites and upset the ordinances.\" While Cyrus was busy fighting the Greeks of Asia Mi nor, Mar- duk—seeking to restore his position as the national god of Baby- lon—\"scanned and looked throughout the countries, s earching for a righteous ruler willing to be led.

Four year s later his son and successor, Cambyses, led his troops along the M editerranean coast of the Sinai peninsula and defeated the Egypt ians at Pelu- sium; a few months later he entered Memphis, the Eg yptian royal capital, and proclaimed himself a Pharaoh.

It was in Upper Egypt that the first battle, above reported, had taken place between Horus and \"the enemies.\" Heinri ch Brugsch, who first published the text of the inscription bac k in 1870 (Die Sage von der geflugten Sonnenscheibe), suggested th at the \"Land of Khenn\" was Nubia, and that Horus had spotted the enemies at Syene (today's Aswan). More recent studies, such as Egypt in Nu- bia by Walter B. Emery, agree that Ta-Khenn was Nub ia and that Ua-Ua was the name of its northern part, the area b etween the Nile's first and second cataracts. (The southern pa rt of Nubia was called Kush.) These identifications seem valid, sin ce the city of Behutet. which was granted to Horus as a prize for his first victory, was the very city of Edfu, which has been dedicated to Horus ever since. Traditions held that Edfu was where Horus establish ed a divine metal foundry, at which unique weapons made of \"div ine iron\" were forged. It was there, too. that Horus trained an army of mesniu—\"Metal People.\" They were depicted on the wa lls of the temple of Edfu as men with shaven heads, wearing a short tunic and a deep collar, carrying weapons in each hand. A depiction of an unidentified, harpoonlike weapon was included in the hi- eroglyphic words for \"divine iron\" and \"metal peopl e.\" The mesniu were, according to Egyptian traditions, the first men ever to have been armed by the gods with weapons ma de of metal. They also were, as we shall soon gather from the un folding tale, the first men to have been enlisted by a god to fig ht in the wars be- tween the gods. The area between Aswan and Edfu now firmly secured, and men-warriors armed and trained, the gods were ready to advance northward, toward the heartland of Egypt. The initi al victories ap- parently also strengthened the alliance of the gods , for we are told that the Asiatic goddess Ishtar (the Egyptian text calls her by her Canaanite name, Ashtoreth) had joined the group.

Since the enemies on the land were hidden from sigh t, Ra had an idea: \"And Ra said unto the gods accompanying him: 'Let us guide our vessel toward the water, for the enemy li es in the land.' And they called the waters 'The Travelled Waters' f rom that day on.\" While Ra could utilize the amphibious capabili ties of his ve- hicle, Horus was in need of a waterborne vessel. So they gave him a boat, \"and called it Mak-A (Great Protector) unto this day.\" It was then that the first battle involving mortal men ensued: But the enemies too went into the waters, making th emselves as crocodiles and hippopotami, and they were striki ng at the boat of Ra, the Falcon of the Horizon. . . . It was then that Horus, the Winged Measurer, came a long with his helpers, those who served as warriors, eac h one called by name, with the Divine Iron and a chain in their hands, and they beat off the crocodiles and the hippopotami. And they hauled up 651 enemies to that place; they were killed in sight of the city. And Ra. the Falcon of the Horizon, said unto Horus, the Winged Measurer: \"Let this place be known as the pl ace where thine victory in the southlands has been establishe d.\" Having vanquished their enemies from the skies, on land, and in the waters, the victory of Horus seemed complete; a nd Thoth called for a celebration: Then said Thoth unto the other gods: \"O Gods of Hea ven, let your hearts rejoice! O Gods of Earth, let your hear ts rejoice! The young Horus has brought peace, having performed ext raordi- nary feats in this campaign.\" It was then that the Winged Disk was adopted as the emblem of Horus victorious: It is from that day that the metal emblems of Horus have existed.

In spite of the proclamation of Horus by Thoth as a bringer of peace, peace was not yet in hand. As the company of the gods kept advancing northward, \"they glimpsed two brightnesse s on a plain southeast of Thebes. And Ra said to Thoth: \"This is the enemy; let Horus slaughter them. ...\" And Horus made a gre at massacre among them.\" Once again, with the aid of the army of men he had trained and armed, Horus was victorious; and Thoth kept naming the locations after the successful battles. While the first aerial battle broke through the def enses separat- ing Egypt from Nubia at Syene (Aswan), the ensuing battles on land and water secured for Horus the bend of the Ni le, from Thebes to Dendera. There great temples and royal sites pro liferated in days to come. Now the way was open into the heartland of Egypt.

But the god smote their hearts [with fear), and whe n they reached the middle of the waters as they fled, they directe d themselves from the western lake to the waters which connect w ith the lakes of the district Mer, in order to join themselves there with the enemies who were the Land of Seth.\" These verses provide not only geographical informat ion; they also identify \"the enemies\" for the first time. The conflict had shifted to the chain of lakes that in antiquity, mu ch more than now- adays, physically separated Egypt proper from the S inai peninsula. To the east, beyond this watery barrier, lay the do main of Seth— the erstwhile adversary and slayer of Osiris, the f ather of Horns. Seth, we now learn, was the enemy against whose for ces Horus had been advancing from the south. And now Horus re ached the line dividing Egypt from the Land of Seth. For a while there was a lull in the fighting, durin g which Horus brought up to the front line his armed Metal People , and Ra reached the scene in his boat. The enemies, too, re grouped and crossed back the waters, and a major battle followe d. This time, 381 of the enemy were captured and executed (no cas ualty figures on the side of Horus are ever given in the text); a nd Horus. in hot pursuit, crossed the waters into the territory of S eth. It was then, according to the inscription in the gr eat temple of Edfu, that Seth was so enraged that he faced Hor us for a series of battles—on the ground and in the air—for god-to-god combat. Of this combat there have been found several versions, as we shall see. What is interesting at this point is the fact brought out by E. A. Wallis Budge in The Gods of the Egyptians: that in the first in- volvement of men in the Wars of the Gods, it was th e arming of mankind with the Divine Iron that brought victory t o Horus: \"It is pretty clear that he owed his success chiefly to th e superiority of the weapons with which he and his men were armed, and t o the mate- rial of which they were made.\" Thus, according to Egyptian writings, did man learn to lift sword against man.

In time they outgrew their purely military role and attained the title Shamsu-Hor (\"Attendants of Horus\"), serving as his human aides and emissar- ies. The inscription on the temple walls at Edfu. it has been estab- lished, was a copy of a text that was known to the Egyptian scribes from earlier sources; but when and by whom the orig inal text had been composed, no one can really tell. Scholars who have studied the inscription have concluded that the accurate ge ographical and other data in the text indicate (in the words of E. A. Wallis Budge) \"that we are not dealing entirely with mythological events; and it is nearly certain that the triumphant progress ascr ibed to Hor- Behutet (Horus of Edfu) is based upon the exploits of some victori- ous invader who established himself at Edfu in very early times.\" As with all Egyptian historical texts, this one, to o, begins with a date: \"In the year 363.\" Such dates always indicate the year in the reign of the Pharaoh to whom the event pertains: ea ch Pharaoh had his first year, second year, and so on. The text in question, how- ever, deals not with the affairs of kings but with divine matters—a war among the gods. The text thus relates events th at had happened in the \"year 363\" in the reign of certain gods and takes us back to the early times when gods, not men, ruled over Egyp t. That there indeed had been such a time, Egyptian tr aditions left no doubt. The Greek historian Herodotus (fifth cent ury B.C.), on his extensive visit to Egypt, was given by the prie sts details of the Pharaonic dynasties and reigns. \"The priests,\" he w rote, \"said that Men was the first king of Egypt, and that it w as he who raised the dyke which protects Memphis from the inundation s of the Nile,\" diverted the river, and proceeded to build M emphis on the reclaimed land. \"Besides these works he also, the p riests said, built the temple of Vulcan, which stands within the city, a vast edi- fice, very worthy of mention. \"Next they read me from a papyrus the names of 330 monarchs who were his successors upon the throne. In this nu mber of succes- sors there were eighteen Ethiopian kings, and one q ueen who was a native: all the rest were kings and Egyptians.\""},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"The Contending of Horus and Seth 33 The priests then showed Herodotus rows of statues r epresenting the successive Pharaohs and related to him various details per- taining to some of these kings and their claims to divine ancestry. \"The beings represented by these images were very f ar indeed from being gods,\" Herodotus commented; \"however,\" h e went on to say: In times preceding them it was otherwise: Then Egyp t had gods for its rulers, who dwelt upon the Earth with men, one of them being always supreme above the rest. The last of these was Horus, the son of Osiris, who m the Greeks called Apollo. He deposed Typhon, and ruled over Egypt as its last god-king. In his book Against Apion, the first-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus quoted as one of his sources on th e history of Egypt the writings of an Egyptian priest named Mane tho. Such writings were never found; but any doubt regarding the existence of such a historian was dispelled when it was reali zed that his writ- ings formed the basis for several works by later Gr eek historians. It is now established with certainty that Manetho (his hieroglyphic name meant \"Gift of Thoth\"), indeed a high priest a nd great scholar, compiled the history of Egypt in several v olumes at the command of king Ptolemy Philadelphus circa 270 B.C. The origi- nal manuscript was deposited in the great library o f Alexandria, only to perish there together with numerous other i nvaluable docu- ments when the building and its contents were set o n fire by Muslim conquerors in A . D . 642. Manetho was the first known historian to have divid ed the Egyp- tian rulers into dynasties—a practice continued to this day. His King List—names, lengths of reign, order of success ion, and some other pertinent information—has been mainly preserv ed through the writings of Julius Africanus and Eusebius of Ca esarea (in the third and fourth centuries A . D .). These and other versions based on Manetho agree that he listed as the first ruler of the first dy- nasty of Pharaohs the king Men (Menes in Greek)—the very same king that Herodotus reported, based on his own investi- gations in Egypt. This fact has since been confirmed by modem discove ries, such as the Tablet of Abydos (Fig. 7) in which the Phara oh Seti I, ac- companied by his son, Ramses II, listed the names o f seventy-five of his predecessors.

Manetho. we find, had agreed with Herodotus also on that mat- ter. The dynasties of the Pharaohs, he wrote, were preceded by four other dynasties—two of gods, one of demigods, and a transi- tional dynasty. At first, he wrote, seven great god s reigned over Egypt for a total of 12,300 years: Ptah ruled 9,000 years Ra ruled 1,000 years Shu ruled 700 years Geb ruled 500 years Osiris ruled 450 years Scth ruled 350 years Horns ruled 300 years Seven gods ruled 12,300 years The second dynasty of gods, Manetho wrote, consiste d of twelve divine rulers, the first of whom was the god Thoth; they reigned for 1,570 years. In all, he said, nineteen gods ruled for 13,870 years. Then there followed a dynasty of thir ty demigods, who reigned for 3,650 years; in a l l , there were for ty-nine divine and semidivine rulers over Egypt, reigning a total of 17,520 years. Then, for 350 years, there was no ruler over the wh ole of Egypt; it was a chaotic time, during which ten human rulers c ontinued the kingship at This. Only thereafter did Men establish the first human dynasty of Pharaohs and built a new capital dedicat ed to the god Ptah—the \"Vulcan\" of Herodotus. A century and a half of archaeological discoveries and the deci- phering of the hieroglyphic writing have convinced scholars that the Pharaonic dynasties probably began in Egypt cir ca 3100 B.C.; indeed, under a ruler whose hieroglyph reads Men.

Petrie suggeste d that this group, which preceded the First Dynasty, be called \"Dynast y O.\" A major archaeological document dealing with Egypti an kingship, the so-called Turin Papyrus, begins with a dynasty of gods that lists Ra, Geb, Osiris, Seth, and Horns, then Thoth, Maat, and others, and assigns to Horus—just as Manetho did—a reign of 300 years. This papyrus, which dates from the time of Ramses II, li sts after the divine rulers thirty-eight semidivine rulers: \"Nineteen Ch iefs of the White Wall and nineteen Venerables of the North.\" Between them and Menes, the Turin Papyrus states, there ruled human kings under the patronage of Horus; their epithet was Shamsu-Hor! Addressing the Royal Society of Literature in Londo n in 1843, the curator of Egyptian Antiquities at the British Museum, Dr. Samuel Birch, announced that he had counted on the papyrus and its fragments a total of 330 names—a number that \"coinc ided with the 330 kings mentioned by Herodotus.\" Even if they disagree among themselves on details, Egyptolo- gists now agree that the archaeological discoveries sustain the information provided by the ancient historians conc erning the dy- nasties begun by Menes, following a chaotic period of about ten rulers in a disunited Egypt; and that there had bee n a prior period when Egypt was united under rulers whose names coul d have been none other than Horus, Osiris, and so on. However, scholars who find it difficult to accept that these rulers were \"gods\" suggest that they were only \"deified\" human beings. To throw more light on the subject, we can start wi th the very place chosen by Menes for the capital of the reunified Eg ypt. The location of Memphis, we find, was not a matter of chance; it was related to cer- tain events pertaining to the gods. Nor was the man ner in which Memphis was built unsymbolic: Menes built the city on an artificial mound, created through the diversion of the Nile at that spot and other extensive damming, dyking, and land-reclamation wor ks. This he did in emulation of the manner in which Egypt itself ha d been created. The Egyptians believed that \"a very great god who c ame forth in the earliest times\" arrived in the land and found i t lying under water and mud.

Ptah and the other gods were called, in Egyptian, N tr—\"Guard- ian, Watcher.\" They had come to Egypt, the Egyptian s wrote, from Ta-Ur, the \"Far/Foreign Land,\" whose name Ur m eant \"olden\" but could have also been the actual place n ame—a place well known from Mesopotamian and biblical records: the ancient city of Ur in southern Mesopotamia. And the straits of the Red Sea, which connected Mesopotamia and Egypt, were called Ta-Neter, the \"Place of the Gods,\" the passage by which they had come to Egypt. That the earliest gods did come from the bib lical lands of Shem is additionally borne out by the puzzling fact that the names of these olden gods were of \"Semitic\" (Akkadian) de rivation. Thus Ptah, which had no meaning in Egyptian, meant \"he who fashioned things by carving and opening up\" in the Semitic tongues. In time—after 9,000 years, according to Manetho—Ra, a son of Ptah, became the ruler over Egypt. His name, too, h ad no meaning in Egyptian, but because Ra was associated with a b right celestial body, scholars assume that Ra meant \"bright.\" We do know with greater certainty that one of his nicknames, Tem, h ad the Semitic connotation \"the Complete, the Pure One.\" It was believed by the Egyptians that Ra, too, had come to Earth from the \"Planet of Millions of Years\" in a Celesti al Barge, the conical upper part of which, called Ben-Ben (\"Pyram idion Bird\"), was later on preserved in a specially built shrine in the sacred city Anu (the biblical On, which is better known by its Greek name He- liopolis). In dynastic times Egyptians made pilgrim ages to this shrine to view the Ben-Ben and other relics associa ted with Ra and the celestial travels of the gods. It was to Ra as Tern that the Israel- ites were forced to build the city called in the Bi ble Pi-Torn— \"The Gateway of Tern.\" It was the Heliopolitan priests who first recorded the traditions of the gods of Egypt and who related that the first \"company\" of the gods headed by Ra consisted of nine \"Guardians\" —Ra and"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"The Contending of Horus and Seth 39 lour divine couples who followed him. The first div ine couple to rule when Ra tired of staying in Egypt were his own children, the male Shu (\"Dryness\"') and the female Tefnut (\"Moist ure\"): their main task, according to Egyptian talcs, was to help Ra control the skies over the Earth. Shu and Tefnut set the example for mortal Pharaohs in later times: the king selected his own half-sister as his royal spouse. They were followed on the divine throne—as both leg ends and Manetho inform us—by their children, again a brothe r-sister cou- ple: Geb (\"Who Piles Up the Earth\") and Nut (\"The S tretched-out Firmament\"). The purely mythological approach to the Egyptian ta les of the gods—that of primitive people watching Nature and s eeing \"gods\" in its phenomena—has led scholars to assume that Ge b represented the Earth deified, and Nut the Heavens: and that by calling Geb and Nut Father and Mother of the gods who thereafte r reigned over Egypt, the Egyptians believed that the gods were bo rn of the union of Earth and Heaven. But if the legends and v erses in the Pyramid Texts and The Book of the Dead are to be ta ken more literally, it appears that Geb and Nut were so name d on account of activities related to the periodic appearance of the Bennu bird, from which the Greeks obtained the legend of the Phoe- nix: an eagle whose feathers were red and gold, whi ch died and reappeared at intervals lasting several millennia. It was for that bird—whose name was the same as that of the contrap tion in which Ra landed on Earth—that Geb engaged in great earth- works and Nut \"stretched out the firmament of the s ky.\" These feats, it appears, were carried out by the gods in the \"Land of the Lions\"; it was there that Geb \"hath opened up t he earth\" for the great spherical object that came from the \" stretched-out skies\" and appeared on the horizon. In the aftermath of the above-described feats, Geb and Nut turned over the direct rule of Egypt to their four children: Asar (\"The All-Seeing\"), whom the Greeks called Osiris, and his sister- wife Ast, better known as Isis; and Seth and his wi fe Nephtys (Nebt-Hat, \"Lady of the House\"), the sister of Isis . It was with these gods, who were truly gods of Egypt, that the Egyptian tales most concerned themselves; but in depicting them (F ig. 9) Seth was never shown without his animal disguise: his fa ce was never seen, and the meaning of his name still defies Egyp tologists, even if it is identical to the name given in the Bible t o Adam and Eve's third son."},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"40 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN With two brothers who married their own two sisters , the gods confronted a serious problem of succession. The onl y plausible so- lution was to divide the kingdom: Osiris was given the northern lowlands (Lower Egypt), and Seth was given the sout hern, moun- tainous part (Upper Egypt). How long this arrangeme nt lasted we can only guess from Manetho's chronicles: but it is certain that Seth was not satisfied with the division of soverei gnty and resorted to various schemes to gain control over the whole o f Egypt. Scholars have assumed that the sole motive of Seth was a crav- ing for power. But once one grasps what the gods' r ules of succes- sion were, it becomes possible to understand the pr ofound effect these rules had upon the affairs of the gods (and t hen of human kings). Since the gods (and then men) could have, i n addition to the official spouse, one or more concubines, as well as beget children through illicit love affairs, the first rule of suc cession was this: the son first born to the official spouse was the heir to the throne. If the official spouse bore no son, the son first born to any of the concu- bines became the heir. However, if at any time, eve n after the birth of the Firstborn heir, a son was born to the ruler by his own half- sister, this son superseded the Firstborn and becam e the Legal Heir. It was this custom that was the cause of much rival ry and strife among the Gods of Heaven and Earth and—we suggest—e xplains the basic motivation of Seth.

The Egyptian sources on which he relied were believed at the time to have been writi ngs of the god Thoth himself, who. as the Scribe of the Gods, reco rded for all times their histories and deeds upon this Earth. \"Now the story of Isis and Osiris, its most signifi cant [retained] and superfluous parts omitted, is thus briefly rela ted,\" wrote Plu- tarch in his opening sentence and went on to tell t hat Nut (whom the Greeks compared with their goddess Rhea) had mo thered three sons: the firstborn was Osiris, the last Seth. She also gave birth to two daughters, Isis and Nephtys. But not all of the se children were really fathered by Geb: only Seth and Nephtys were. Osiris and his second brother were in truth fathered by the god Ra , who came unto his granddaughter Nut in stealth; and Isis was fathered by Thoth (the Greek god Hermes) who, \"being likewise i n love with the same goddess,\" reciprocated in various ways \"in recompense for the favours which he had received from her.\" The setting, then, was this: the firstborn was Osir is, and. though not by Geb. his claim to the succession was even gr eater, having been fathered by the great Ra himself. But the legi timate heir was Seth, having been born to the ruling Geb by his hal f-sister Nut. As if this were not enough, matters were further compl icated by the race between the two brothers to assure that their son would be the next legitimate successor. To achieve that Seth cou ld have fathered a son only by his half-sister Isis, whereas Osiris could achieve this by fathering a son by either Isis or Nephtys (both being only half- sisters to him). But Osiris deliberately blocked Se th's chances to have his descendants rale over Egypt by taking Isis as his spouse. Seth then married Nephtys; but as she was his full sister, none of their offspring could qualify. So was the stage set for Seth's increasingly violen t rage against Osiris, who deprived him both of the throne and of the succession. The occasion for Seth's revenge, according to Pluta rch, was the visit to Egypt of \"a certain queen of Ethiopia name d Aso. \"In con- spiracy with his supporters Seth held a banquet in her honor, to which all the gods were invited. For his scheme Set h had a magnif- icent chest constructed, large enough to hold Osiri s: \"This chest he brought into the banqueting room; where, after it h ad been much admired by all who were present, Seth—as though in jest- promised to give it to any one of them whose body i t would fit.

Dressed in mourning apparel and cutting off a lock of her hair as a sign of grief. Isis went in search of the chest, \"At length she re- ceived more particular news of the chest, that it h ad been carried by the waves of the sea to the coast of Byblos\" (in wh at is now Lebanon). Isis retrieved the chest holding the body of Osiris and hid it in a deserted place until she could figure o ut how to resurrect Osiris. But Seth somehow found all that out, seized the chest, and cut up the body of Osiris into fourteen pieces, whi ch he dispersed all over Egypt. Once again Isis went in search of the scattered lim bs of her brother-husband. Some versions say that she buried the pans where she found them, starting the worship of Osiris at t hose places: others say she bound together the parts she found, starting the cus- tom of mummification. All agree that she found all parts except one—the phallus of Osiris. Nevertheless, before finally disposing of the body, she managed to extract from the body of Osiris its \"essence,\" a nd self-insemi- nated herself with his seed, thus conceiving and gi ving birth to the boy Horus. She hid him from Seth in the papyrus swa mps of the Nile delta. Many legends have been found concerning the events that fol- lowed: legends copied and recopied on papyri, formi ng chapters of The Book of the Dead, or used as verses in the Pyra mid texts. Put together they reveal a major drama that involved le gal maneuver- ing, kidnapping for purposes of state, a magical re turn from the dead, homosexuality, and finally a great war—a dram a in which the stake was the Divine Throne of the gods. Since all seemed to believe that Osiris had perishe d without leaving an heir, Seth saw this as hi s chance to obt ain a legitimate heir by forcing Isis to espouse him. He kidnapped h er and held her prisoner until she consented, but with the aid of t he god Thoth, Isis managed to escape. A version recorded on the so-cal led Metternich Stela, composed as a tale by Isis in her own words, describes her escape in the night and her adventures until she re ached the swamps where Horus was hidden.

Then, one day, he appeared before the Council of the Gods to claim the throne of Osiris. Of the many gods who were surprised by his appearan ce, none was more so than Seth. All seemed to wonder: Did Os iris indeed father this son? As described in a text known as th e Chester Beatly Papyrus No. 1, Seth suggested that the gods' delibe rations be re- cessed so as to give him a chance to discuss the pr oblem peacefully with his newly appeared nephew. He invited Horus to \"come, let us pass a happy day in my house,\" and Horus agreed.

Now it was the turn of Horus to surprise the gods. When Seth poured out his semen, \"I caught the seed between my hands,\" Ho- rus said. In the morning he showed it to his mother , telling her what had happened. Isis then made Horus erect his m ember and pour his semen into a cup. Then she went to the gar den of Seth and poured the semen of Horus on the lettuce that Seth then unknow- ingly ate. So, announced Horus, \"Not only is Seth's seed not in me, but my seed is in him! It is Seth who has been disqualified!\" Baffled, the gods called upon Thoth to resolve the issue. He checked the semen that Horus had given his mother, which Isis kept in a pot; it was found to be indeed the semen of Seth. He then scanned the body of Seth and confirmed that it cont ained the semen of Horus. . . . Enraged, Seth did not wait for the discussions to c ontinue.

Mercer summed up the scholarly opinion s on the sub- ject with these emphatic words: \"The story of the c onflict between Horus and Seth represents a historical event.\" According to the Edfu temple inscription, the first face-to-face battle between Horus and Seth took place at the \"La ke of the Gods,\" thereafter known as the \"Lake of Battle.\" Ho rus managed to hit Seth with his Divine Lance; when Seth fell d own, Horus cap- tured him and brought him before Ra. \"His spear was in his (Seth's] neck, and the legs of the evil one were ch ained, and his mouth had been closed by a blow from the club of th e god [Ho- rus].\" Ra decided that Isis and Horus could do with Seth and the other captured \"conspirators\" as they pleased. But as Horus began to slay the captives by cutting off their heads, Isis had pity on her brother Seth, and set h im free. There are several versions of what ensued, including one know n as the Fourth Sallier Papyrus; and, according to most, the release of Seth so infuriated Horus that he beheaded his own mother , Isis; but the god Thoth put her severed head back in place and re surrected her.

The nickname (\"Weapon of Thirty\") s uggests that the missiles were what we nowadays call Multiple Wa rhead Mis- siles, each missile holding ten warheads. Through sheer coincidence, but probably because sim ilar cir- cumstances result in similar connotations, the McDo nnell Douglas Corporation of St. Louis, Missouri, has named its n ewly devel- oped naval guided missile \"The Harpoon\" (Fig. 12b).

The Council, at first, redivided Egypt between Horu s and Seth along the lines of the division at the time of Osir is, but Geb had second thoughts and upset the decision, for he was concerned with the question of continuity: Who would \"open the bod y\" to succes- sive generations? Seth, having lost his testicles, could no longer have offspring. . . . And so Geb, \"Lord Earth, gave as a heritage to Horus\" the whole of Egypt. To Seth a dominion aw ay from Egypt was to be given; henceforth, he was deemed by the Egyp- tians to have become an Asiatic deity. The Council of the Gods adopted the recommendations unani- mously.

His conviction of the Egyptian origin of Greek theo logy stemmed not only from comparable attributes and mea nings of the gods' names, but also (and mostly) from similaritie s in the tales concerning them. Of these, one uncanny parallel cer tainly must have struck him as no mere coincidence: it was the tale of the cas- tration of one god by another in a struggle for sup remacy. The Greek sources from which Herodotus could have d rawn are. fortunately, still available: various literary work s, such as Homer's Iliad; the Odes of Pindar of Thebes, written and we ll known just before Herodotus' time; and first and foremost, the Theogony (\"Divine Genealogy\") by Hesiod, a native of Askara in central Greece who composed this work and another (Works an d Days) in the eighth century B .

First of th e \"monsters\" to be born were the three Cyclopes, Brontes (\"The T hunderer\"), Steropes (\"The Maker of Lightning\"), and Arges (\"Wh o Makes Radiation\"); \"in all else they were like the gods, but one eye only was set in the midst of their foreheads: and they w ere named 'Orb- eyed' (Cyclopes) because one orbed eye was set in t heir fore- heads.\" \"And again three more sons were born of Gaea and Ur anus, great and valiant beyond telling: Cottus and Briare os and Gyes, au- dacious children.\" Of giant size, the three were ca lled Hekaton- cheires (\"The Hundred-Armed\"): \"From their shoulder s sprang"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"The Missiles of Zeus and India 51 an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders.\" \"And Cronos hated his lusty sire,\" Hesiod wrote; bu t \"Uranus rejoiced in his evil doing.\" It was then that Gaea \"shaped a great sickle and to ld her plan to her dear sons,\" whereby their \"sinful father\" would be punished for his \"vile outrages\": to cut off the genitals of Uranus and put an end to his sexual drives. But \"fear seized them all \"; and only \"great Cronos, the wily, took courage.\" And so it was that Gaea gave Cronos the sickle she had made of gray Hint and hid him \"in an ambush\" in her quarter s, which were by the Mediterranean Sea. And Uranus came at nighttime, longing for love; and he lay about Gaea, spreading himself upon her. Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand to grasp; and in his right hand he held the great long sickle with jagged teeth. Swiftly, he cut off his own father's genitals, and cast them away, to fall behind him . . . into the surging sea. The deed was done, but the castration of Uranus did not com- pletely terminate his line of offspring. As his blo od gushed forth, some of the blood drops impregnated Gaea, and she c onceived and bore \"the strong Erinyes\" (female Furies of vengean ce) \"and the great Gigantes with gleaming armor, holding long sp ears in their hands; and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae ['the N ymphs of the ash tree'].\" Of the castrated genitals, leaving a t rail of foam as the surging sea carried them to the island of Cyprus, \" there came forth an awful and lovely goddess . . . gods and men call her Aphrodite ['She of the Foam'].\" The incapacitated Uranus called out to the monster- gods for ven- geance. His own children, he cried out, had become Titans, Strain- ers who had \"strained and did presumptuously the dr eadful deed\"; now the other gods had to make sure \"that vengeance for it would afterwards come.\" The frightened Cronos then impris oned the Cy- clopes and the other monstrous giants far away, so that none would answer the call of Uranus.

The call of Uranus has been answered: fighting, battles, and war came to be among the god s. It was into this dangerous world that the Titans we re bringing forth the third generation of the gods. Fearful of retribution, they kept closely to each other, five of the six brother s espousing five of their own six sisters. Of these divine brother-sist er couples, most important was that of Cronos and Rhea, for it was C ronos, by rea- son of his bold deed, who had assumed the leadershi p among the gods. Of this union, Rhea gave birth to three daugh ters and three sons: Hestia, Demeter, and Hera: and Hades, Poseido n, and Zeus. No sooner had one of these children been bom than \" the great Cronos swallowed each . . . intent that no other of the proud Sons of Heaven should hold kingly office among the death less gods.\" The reason for eliminating his own offspring by swa llowing them was a prophecy he had learned of, that \"strong thou gh he was, he was destined to be overcome by his own son\": Fate w as to repeat unto Cronos that which he had done unto his father. But Fate could not be evaded. Wisened to the tricks of Cronos, Rhea hid her last-born son Zeus on the island of Cr ete. To Cronos she gave instead of the baby \"a great stone wrapped in swaddling clothes.\" Not realizing the deception, Cronos swall owed the stone, thinking it was the baby Zeus. Soon thereaft er he began vomiting, disgorging one by one all the children he had previously swallowed. \"As the years rolled on, the strength and glorious limbs of the prince [Zeus] increased quickly.\" For a while, as a worthy grand- son of the lusty Uranus, Zeus chased lovely goddess es, often get- ting into trouble with their companion gods. But th en he turned his mind to affairs of state. For ten years a war had b een raging be- tween the older Titans, \"the lordly Titans from hig h Mount Othyres\" (which was their abode), and the younger g ods \"whom rich-haired Rhea bare in union with Cronos\" and who settled on the opposite Mount Olympus. \"With bitter wrath they were fight-"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"The Missiles of Zeus and I n d i a 53 ing continually with one another at that time for t en full years, and the hard strife had no close or end for either side , and the issue of war hung evenly balanced.\" Was this fighting merely the culmination of deterio rating rela- tions between neighboring godly colonies, an outbre ak of rivalry between intermingled and unfaithful gods and goddes ses (where mothers slept with their sons, and uncles impregnat ed their nieces), or the first instance of the everlasting rebellion of the young against the old regime? The Theogony does not provide a cle ar answer, but later Greek legends and plays suggest that all thes e motives com- bined to create a prolonged and \"stubborn war\" betw een the young- er and the older gods. It was this ongoing war that was seen by Zeus as hi s chance to seize the lordship over the gods and thereby—knowin gly or unknowingly—fulfill the destiny to which his father Cronos had been fated, by deposing him. As his first step Zeus \"set free from their deadly bonds the brothers of his father, sons of Uranus, whom his fa ther in his fool- ishness had bound.\" In gratitude, the three Cyclope s gave him the divine weapons Gaea had hidden away from Uranus: \"T he Thun- der, and the Radiating Thunderbolt and the Lightnin g.\" They also gave Hades a magic helmet, which made its wearer in visible; and Poseidon received a magical trident, which could ma ke the earth and sea shake. To refresh the Hekatoncheires after their long capt ivity and re- turn their vigor to them, Zeus provided the trio wi th \"nectar and ambrosia, the same that the gods cat\": then he addr essed them and said: Hear me, O bright children of Uranus and Gaea, that I may say what my heart within bids me.

From the deep sound of the gods' feet, and the fearful onset of their hard missiles, the heavy quaking reached even far Tartarus. In a verse reminiscent of the Dead Sea Scroll text, the Theogony recalled the war cries of the battling gods: Thus, then, they launched their grievous bolts at one another; And the cry of both armies as they shouted reached to the starry heaven as they clashed with a great battle-cry. Zeus himself was fighting with all his might, using his Divine Weapons to the utmost. \"From the skies, opposite Mo unt Olympus, he came forthwith, hurling his lightning. The bolts flew thick and fast from his strong hand, Thunder a nd Light- ning together, whirling as an awesome flame. The fe rtile earth crashed around in burning, and the vast wood crackl ed aloud with fire all about.

All this did the Thunder-Stone of great Zeus bring about. And when the two contending camps heard and saw what ha d hap- pened, \"an horrible uproar of terrible strife arose ; mighty deeds were shown; and the battle inclined.\" The fighting was abating; for the gods had the upper hand over the Titans. \"Insatiated for war.\" the three Cyclopes set upon t he Titans, overpowering them with hand-held missiles. \"They bo und them in bitter chains.\" and hurled them into captivity to f ar Tartarus. \"There, by the counsel of Zeus who rides the clouds , the Titan gods are hidden under misty gloom, in a dank place at the ends of huge Earth.\" The three Cyclopes stayed there, too, as \"trusty warders of Zeus,\" to watch over the imprisoned Tita ns. As Zeus was about to claim \"the aegis.\" the suzerai nty over all the gods, a sudden challenger appeared on the scene . For, \"when Zeus had driven the Titans from heaven, great Gaea bare her youngest child Typhoeus of the love of Tartarus, wi th the aid of golden Aphrodite.\" Typhoeus (\"Typhon\") was a real m onster: \"Strength was with his hands in all that he did, an d the feet of the strong god were untiring. From his shoulders grew a n hundred heads of a snake, a fearful dragon, with dark, flic kering tongues.

(Acco rding to Pindar and Aeschylus, Typhon was gigantic in height, \"and his head reached to the stars.\") \"Truly a thing past help would have happened on tha t day,\" the Muses revealed to Hesiod; it was almost inevitable that Typhoeus \"would have come to reign over mortals and immortal s.\" But Zeus was quick to perceive the danger and lost no t ime in attacking him."},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"The Missiles of Zeus and India 57 The series of battles that ensued were no less awes ome than the fighting between the gods and the Titans, for the S nake-God Ty- phon was equipped with wings and could fly about ju st as Zeus (Fig. 14). \"Zeus thundered hard and mightily, and t he earth around resounded terribly, as did the wide heaven a bove and the sea and the watery streams, even the nether parts o f the Earth.\" Di- vine Weapons were again employed—by both combatants : Fig, 14 Through the two of them, through the thunder and lightning. heat engulfed the dark-blue seas; And through the fire from the Monster, and the scorching winds and blazing Thunderbolt, the whole Earth seethed, and sky and sea.

In spite of the crash and the tremendous impact of Typhon's ve- hicle, the god himself remained alive. According to the Theogony, Zeus cast him, too, \"into wide Tartarus.\" With this victory his reign was secure; and he turned to the important bu siness of pro- creation, bringing forth progeny by wives and concu bines alike. Though the Theogony described only one battle betwe en Zeus and Typhon, the other Greek writings assert that th at was the final battle, preceded by several others in which Zeus wa s the first one to be hurt. Initally Zeus fought with Typhon at clo se quarters, using the special sickle his mother had given him f or the \"evil deed,\" for it was his purpose also to castrate Typh on. But Typhon enmeshed Zeus in his net. wrested his sickle away, and with it cut out the sinews of Zeus' hands and feet. He then dep osited the help- less Zeus, his sinews, and his weapons in a cave. But the gods Aegipan and Hermes found the cave, res urrected Zeus by restoring his sinews, and returned his weap ons to him. Zeus then escaped and flew back \"in a Winged Chario t\" to Olym- pus, where he acquired a new supply of bolts for hi s Thunderer. With these Zeus renewed the attack on Typhon, drivi ng him to Mount Nyssa, where the Fates tricked Typhon into ea ting the food of mortal men; whereupon he was weakened instead of being strengthened.

Aeg ipan stood for the African Ram God of Egypt, and Hermes parall eled the god Thoth. Hesiod himself reported that when Zeus came unto the mor- tal beauty Alcmena so that she might bear him the h eroic Heracles, he slipped at night from Mount Olympus an d went to the land of Typhaonion, resting there atop the Phikion (The Sphinx Mountain). \"The deadly Sphinx that destroyed the Ca dmeans\" (\"The Ancients\"), which featured in the doings of H era, the offi- cial spouse of Zeus, was also connected in these le gends with Ty- phon and his domain. And Apollodorus reported that when Typhon was born and grew to an incredible size, the gods rushed to Egypt to take a look at the awesome monster. Most scholars have held that Mount Casius, the site of the final battle between Zeus and Typhon, was located near th e mouth of the Orontes river in today's Syria. But as Otto Eis sfeldt has shown in a major study (Baal Zaphon, Zeus Kasios und der Durchgang der Israelilen durches Meer), there was another mou nt called by that name in antiquity—a promontory on the Serbonic Sealet that juts out of the Sinai peninsula into the Mediterran ean Sea. He sug- gested that that was the mount referred to in the l egends. Once again, all one had to do was to trust the info rmation given to Herodotus in Egypt. Describing the land route fr om Phoenicia to Egypt via Philistia (History, Book III, 5), he wrot e that the Asian lands ' 'extend to Lake Serbonis, near the place wh ere Mount Casius juts out into the sea.

Central to this literature were the Vedas, sacred s criptures be- lieved by Hindu tradition to be \"not of human origi n,\" having been composed by the gods themselves in a previous age. They were brought to the Indian subcontinent by the Arya n migrants sometime in the second millennium B.C., as oral tra ditions. But as time went on, more and more of the original 100,000 verses were lost; so, circa 200 B.C., a sage wrote down the rem aining verses, dividing them into four parts: the Rig-Veda (the \"V eda of Verses\"), which is made up of ten books; the Sama-V eda (the \"Chanted Vedas\"); the Yajur-Veda (mostly sacrificia l prayers); and the Atharva-Veda (spells and incantations). In time, the various components of the Vedas and th e auxiliary literature that stemmed from them (the Mantras, Bra hmanas, Aranyakas, Upanishads) were augmented by the non-Ve dic Pura- nas (\"Ancient Writings\"). Together with the great e pic tales of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, they make up the sour ces of the Aryan and Hindu tales of Heaven and Earth, gods and heroes. Because of the long oral interval, the length and p rofusion of texts finally written down over many centuries, the many names, generic terms, and epithets employed for the deitie s interchange- ably—and the fact that many of these original names and terms were non-Aryan after all—consistency and precision are not hall- marks of this Sanskrit literature. Yet some facts a nd events emerge as basic tenets of the Aryan-Hindu legacy. In the beginning, these sources relate, there were only the celes- tial bodies, \"The Primeval Ones Who Flow.\" There wa s an up- heaval in the heavens, and \"The Dragon\" was split i n two by the \"Flowing One of Storms.'' Calling the two parts by names of non- Aryan origin, the tales assert that Rehu, the upper part of the de- stroyed planet, unceasingly traverses the heavens i n search of vengeance; the lower part, Ketu (\"The Cut-off One\") , has joined the \"Primeval Ones\" in their \"flowing\" (orbits). Ma ny Ages then passed, and a dynasty of Gods of Heaven and Earth m ade its ap- pearance. The heavenly Mar-Ishi, who headed them, h ad seven (or ten) children by his consort Prit-Hivi (\"The Broad One\"), who personified the Earth. One of them, Kas-Yapa (\"He o f the Throne\"), made himself chief of the Devas (\"The Shi ny Ones\"), seizing the title Dyaus-Pitar (\"Sky Father\")—the un doubted source of the Greek title-name Zeus (\"Dyaus\") and i ts Roman parallel Jupiter (\"Dyauspiter\")."},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"The Missiles of Zeus and Indra 61 Quite prolific, Kasyapa begot many gods, giants, an d monstrous offspring by diverse wives and concubines.

Numbering seven at first, they were Vishnu, Varuna, Mi- tra, Rudra, Pushan, Tvashtri, and Indra.

India's Vimana (aerial car) had lights shining at its sides and mo ved \"swifter than thought,\" traversing rapidly vast distances. Its un seen steeds were \"Sun-eyed,\" emitting a reddish hue, but also changi ng colors. In other instances the aerial cars of the gods were de scribed as multitiered; sometimes they could not only fly in t he air, but also travel under water. In the epic tale of the Mahabha rata, the arrival of the gods for a wedding feast in a fleet of aeria l cars is described thus (we follow the translation of R. Dutt in Mahab harata, The Epic of Ancient India): The gods, in cloud-borne chariots, came to view the scene so fair: Bright Adityas in their splendor, Maruts in the moving air; Winged Suparnas, scaly Nagas, Deva Rishies pure and high, For their music famed, Gandharvas; (and) fair Apsaras of the sky. . . . Bright celestial cars in concourse sailed upon the cloudless sky.

Their vehi- cles, which sometimes appeared in groups, were gold en-made, \"bright and radiant . . . with easy seat and lightl y rolling.\" They were constructed on a triple principle, having thre e levels, three seats, three supporting poles, and three rotating w heels. \"That chariot of yours,\" Hymn 22 of Book VIII of the Rig- Veda said in praise of the Ashvins, \"hath a triple seat and rein s of gold—the famous car that traverses Heaven and Earth.\" The ro tating wheels, it appears, served diverse functions: one to raise the craft, another to give it direction, the third to speed it along: \"One of your chari- ot's wheels is moving swiftly around; one speeds fo r you its on- ward course.\" As in the Greek tales, so did the gods of the Vedas display little morality or restraint in sexual matters—sometimes g etting away with it, sometimes not, as when the indignant Adity as selected Rudra (\"The Three-Eyed\") to kill their grandfather Dyaus for"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"The Missiles of Zeus and Indra 63 having violated their sister Ushas.

In these instances the aerial vehicles of the gods played roles even great er than their weapons. Thus, when one hero drowned, the Ashvins a ppeared in a fleet of three aerial chariots, \"self-activated w atertight ships which traverse the air,\" dived into the ocean, retr ieved the hero from the watery depths, and \"conveyed him over land , beyond the liquid ocean.\" And then there was the tale of Yayat i, a king who married the daughter of a god.

There ensued \"a terrible battle, destructive of gods and demons, on account of Tara.\" In spite of t heir awesome weapons, the gods were bested and had to seek refug e with \"the Prime Deity.\" Thereupon the grandfather of the gods himself came to Earth, and put an end to the fighting by re turning Tara to her husband. Then Tara gave birth to a son \"whose b eauty over- clouded the celestials .... Filled with suspicion, the gods de- manded to know who the true father was: the lawful husband or the abductor-god.\" She proclaimed that the boy was the son of Soma, \"Celestial Immortality\"; and she named him Budah. But all that was in times yet to come; in the olden days the gods battled among themselves for more important causes: supremacy and rule over the Earth and its resources. With so many offspring of Kasyapa by diverse wives and concubines, as well as the de- scendants of the other olden gods, conflict soon be came inevitable. The dominance of the Adityas was especially resente d by the Asu- ras, elder gods whose mothers bore them to Kasyapa before the Adityas were born. Bearing a non-Aryan name of a cl ear Near Eastern origin (being akin to names of the supreme gods of As- syria.

The gods, the texts reveal, sustained their immortality by drinking Soma, an am brosiac that was brought down to Earth from the Celestial Abode by an eagle and was drunk mixed with milk. The \"kine\" (\"cow-cat tle\") of the gods also provided the gods' favored \"sacrifices\" o f roasted meat. But a time came when all these necessities became s carcer and scarcer.

Hearing this, the defeated Adityas went to plead fo r a share in Earth's resources: When they heard this, the gods said: \"The Asuras ar e actually dividing this Earth! Come, let us go where the Asur as are divid- ing it; for what would become of us if we were to g et no share of Earth?\" Placing Vishnu at their head, they went to the Asur as. Haughtily the Asuras offered to give the Adityas on ly as much of Earth as Vishnu could lie upon. . . . But the gods used a subter- fuge and placed Vishnu in an \"enclosure\" that could \"walk in three directions.\" thereby regaining three of the E arth's four re- gions. The outsmarted Asuras then attacked from the south; and the gods asked Agni \"how they could vanquish the Asuras forever.\" Agni suggested a pincer maneuver: while the gods at tack from their regions, \"I will go round to the northern sid e, and you will shut them in from here; and whilst shutting them in , we will put them down.\" Having so vanquished the Asuras, the Sa tapatha Brahmana records, \"the gods were anxious as to how they might replenish the sacrifices\"; accordingly, many of the battle segments of the ancient Hindu writings deal with the recaptu re of the kine and the resupply of the Soma beverage. These wars were fought on land, in the air, and ben eath the seas. The Asuras, according to the Mahabharata, made for themselves three metal fortresses in the skies, from which the y attacked the three regions of the Earth. Their allies in the war with the gods could become invisible and used invisible weapons; and others fought from a city beneath the sea, which they had captured from the gods.

But when the fighting was over, Indra, having contributed so much to the vict ory, claimed the supremacy. As in the Greek Theogony, one of his fir st acts to es- tablish his claim was to slay his own father. The R ig-Veda (Book iv: 18, 12) asks Indra rhetorically: \"Indra, who ma de thy mothera widow?\" The answer follows also as a question: \"Wha t god was present in the fray, when thou didst slay thy fathe r, seizing him by the foot?\" For this crime Indra was excluded by the gods from the drinking of the Soma, thereby endangering his continued immo rtality. They \"ascended up to Heaven,\" leaving Indra with the kin e he had re- trieved. But \"he went up after them, with the raise d Thunder- weapon,\" ascending from the northern place of the g ods. Fearing his weapon, the gods shouted: \"Do not hurl!\" and ag reed to let In- dra share once again in the divine nourishments. Indra's seizing of the leadership of the gods, howe ver, did not go unchallenged. The challenge came from Tvashtri, to whom oblique references are made in the Hymns as \"the Fi rstborn\"—a fact that may explain his own claim to the succession. I ndra smote him quickly with the Thunder-Weapon, the very weapon th at Tvashtri had fashioned for him. But then the struggle was ta ken over by Vritra (\"The Obstructor\"), whom some texts call the firstborn of Tvashtri but whom some scholars interpret as having been an artifi- cial monster, because he quickly grew to an immense size. At first Indra was bested, and he fled to a far corner of Ea rth. When all the gods then abandoned him, only the twenty-one Maruts stood by his side. They were a group of gods who manned the fast est aerial cars, who \"loud roaring as the winds make the mount ains rock and reel\" as they \"lift themselves aloft\": These verily wondrous, red of hue, Speed on their course with a roar over the ridges of the sky . . . And spread themselves with beams of light . . . Bright, celestial, with lightning in their hands and helmets of gold upon their heads. With the aid of the Maruts, Indra returned to battl e Vritra.

The longest texts discovered dealt, as could be exp ected, with the Hittite supreme deity Teshub: his genealogy; hi s rightful as- sumption of dominion over Earth's upper regions; an d the battles launched against him by the god KUMARBI and his off spring. As in the Greek and Egyptian tales, the Avenger of Kumarbi was hidden with the aid of allied gods until he grew up somewhere in a \"dark-hued\" part of Earth. The final battles raged in the skies and in the seas; in one battle Teshub was supported by seventy gods riding in their chariots. At first defeated an d either hiding or exiled, Teshub finally faced his challenger in god- to-god combat. Armed with the \"Thunder-stormer which scatters the rocks for ninety furlongs\" and \"'the Lightning which flashes frightfully,\" he ascended skyward in his chariot, pulled by two g old-plated Bulls of Heaven, and \"from the skies he set his fac e\" toward his enemy. Though the fragmented tablets lack the tale' s ending, it is evident that Teshub was finally victorious. Who were these ancient gods, who fought each other for su- premacy and sought dominion over Earth by pitting n ation against nation? Fittingly, perhaps, treaties that had ended some of the very wars launched by men for their gods provide important cl ues. When the Egyptians and the Hittites made peace afte r more than two centuries of warfare, it was sealed by the marr iage of the daughter of the Hittite king Hattusilish III to the Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II. The Pharaoh recorded the event on commemorative ste lae which he placed at Kamak, at Elephantine near Aswan, and at Abu Simbel. Describing the journey and the arrival of the princ ess in Egypt, the inscription relates that when \"His Majesty saw that she was as beautiful of face as a goddess,\" he at once fell in love with her and 70"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"The Earth Chronicles 71 deemed her to be \"something lovely granted him by t he god Ptah\" and a sign of Hittite acknowledgment of his \"victor y.\" What all this diplomatic maneuvering had entailed was clarif ied by other parts of the inscription: thirteen years earlier, H attusilish had sent to the Pharaoh the text of a Peace Treaty; but Rams es II, still brooding over his near-fatal experience in the batt le of Kadesh, ig- nored it. \"The great Chief of Hatti then wrote appe asingly to His Majesty year after year; but the King Ramses paid n o attention.\" Finally, the King of Hatti, instead of sending mess ages inscribed on tablets, \"sent his eldest daughter, preceded by precious tribute\" and accompanied by Hittite nobles. Wondering what a ll these gifts meant, Ramses sent an Egyptian escort to meet and a ccompany the Hittites. And, as related above, he succumbed to th e beauty of the Hittite princess, made her a queen, and named her M aat-Neferu-Ra (\"The Beauty Which Ra Sees\"). Our knowledge of history and antiquity has also pro fited by that love at first sight, for the Pharaoh then accepted the lingering Peace Treaty, and proceeded to inscribe it, too, at Kamak , not far from where the tale of the Battle of Kadesh and the Tale of the Beautiful Hittite Princess had been commemorated. Two copies, one almost complete, the other fragmentary, have been discover ed, deciphered, and translated by Egyptologists. As a result we not only have the full text of the Treaty but also know that the Hittite k ing wrote down the treaty in the Akkadian language, which was then (as French was a century and two ago) the common language of interna tional relations. To the Pharaoh he sent a copy of the Akkadian origi nal written on a silver tablet, which the Egyptian inscription at Karnak de- scribed thus: What is in the middle of the tablet of silver, on t he front side: Figures consisting of an image of Seth, embracing a n image of the Great Prince of Hatti, surrounded by a borde r with the words \"the seal of Seth, ruler of the sky; the seal of the regula- tion which Hattusilish made\" . . . What is within that which surrounds the image of th e seal of Seth on the other side: Figures consisting of a female image of the goddess of Hatti embracing a female image of the Princess of Hatti, surrounded by a border with the words \"the seal of the Ra of t he town of Arinna, the lord of the land\" . . .

Against all odds, the original treaty itself, inscr ibed on two tablets in the Akkadian language, was also found in these a rchives. But the Hittite texts called their chief deity Teshub, not \"Seth of Hatt i. \" Since Teshub meant \"Windy Storm.\" and Seth (to judge by his Greek name Typhon) meant \"Fierce Wind,\" it a ppeared that the Egyptians and Hittites were matching their pantheons ac- cording to the epithet-names of their gods. In line with that, Teshub's spouse HEBAT was called \"Lady of the Skies \" to paral- lel the goddess by that title in the Egyptian versi on of the treaty; Ra (\"The Bright One\") was paralleled by a Hittite \"Lor d of the Sky\" whom the Akkadian version called SHAMASH (\"The Brig ht One\"), and so on. The Egyptians and the Hittites, it became evident, were match- ing separate, but parallel, pantheons; and scholars began to wonder what other ancient treaties would reveal. One that provided surpris- "},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"The Earth Chronicles 73 ing information was the treaty made circa 1350 B.C. between the Hittite king Shuppilulima and Mattiwaza, king of th e Human king- dom of Mitanni, which was situated on the Euphrates river midway between the Land of the Hittites and the ancient la nds of Sumer and Akkad. Executed as usual in two copies, the treaty's origi nal was depos- ited in the shrine of the god Teshub in the Human c ity Kahat—a place and a tablet lost in the sands of time. But t he duplicate tablet, deposited in the Hittite holy city of Arinna \"in fr ont of the goddess of the Rising Disc,\" was discovered by archaeologis ts some 3,300 years after it was written! As did all treaties in those days, the one between the H i t t i t e and Mitannian kings ended with a call upon \"the god s of the con- tracting parties to be present, to listen and to se rve as witnesses,\" so that adherence to the treaty shall bring divine bliss, and its viola- tion the wrath of the gods. These \"gods of the cont racting parties\" were then listed, beginning with Teshub and his con sort Hebat as the supreme reigning gods of both kingdoms, the god s \"who regu- late kingship and queenship\" in Hatti and Mitanni a nd in whose shrines the copies of the treaty were deposited. Th en, a number of younger deities, both male and female, offspring of the two reigning gods, were listed by the provincial capita ls where they acted as governing deities, representing their pare nts. Here, then, was a listing of the very same gods in the very same hi- erarchical positions; unlike the Egyptian instance, when different pantheons were being matched. As other discovered t exts proved, the Hittite pantheon was in fact borrowed from (or thro ugh) the Humans. But this particular treaty held a special surprise: toward the end of the tablet, among the divine witnesses, there were also listed Mitra-ash. Uruwana, Indar, and the Nashatiyanu gods—the very M itra, Varuna, Indra, and the Nasatya gods of the Hindu pantheon! Which of the three—Hittite, Hindu, Human—was then t he com- mon source? The answer was provided in the same Hit tite- Mitannian treaty: none of them; for those so-called \"Aryan\" gods were listed in the treaty together with their paren ts and grandpar- ents, the \"Olden Gods\": the couples Anu and Antu, E nlil and his spouse Ninlil, Ea and his wife Damkina; as well as \"the divine Sin, lord of the oath . . . Nergal of Kutha ... the warrior god Ninurta ... the warlike Ishtar.\" These are familiar names; they had been invoked in earlier days by Sargon of Akkad, who had claimed that he was \"Ov erseer of Ishtar, anointed priest of Anu, great righteous she pherd of Enlil.\""},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"74 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN His grandson Naram-Sin (\"Whom the god Sin loves\") c ould at- tack the Cedar Mountain when the god Nergal \"opened the path\" for him.

No less illuminating was the discovery that the Hit tites and the Hurrians. though they pronounced the deities' names in their own language, wrote the names employing Sumerian script ; even the \"divine\" determinative used was the Sumerian DIN.GI R, literally meaning \"The Righteous Ones\" (DIN) \"Of the Rocketsh ip\" (GIR).

All the others were offshoots of tha t first-known civilization. And it is by now established beyond doubt that it w as in Sumer that the tales of gods and men were first recorded. It was there that numerous texts—more numerous than can be imagined, more de- tailed than could be expected—were first inscribed. It was there that the written records of history and prehistory on our planet Earth had originated. We call them THE EARTH CHRONICLES . The discovery and understanding of the ancient civi lizations has been a process of continuous astonishment, of incre dible realiza- tions. The monuments of antiquity—pyramids, ziggura ts, vast platforms, columned ruins, carved stones—would have remained enigmas, mute evidence to bygone events, were it no t for the Writ- ten Word. Were it not for that, the ancient monumen ts would have remained puzzles: their age uncertain; their creato rs obscure; their purpose unclear. We owe what we know to the ancient scribes—a prolif ic and me- ticulous lot, who used monuments, artifacts, founda tion stones, bricks, utensils, weapons of any conceivable materi al, as inviting slates on which to write down names and record even ts. Above all there were the clay tablets: flattened pieces of we t clay, some small enough to be held in the palm of the hand, on which the scribe deftly embossed with a stylus the symbols that form ed syllables, words, and sentences. Then the tablet would be left to dry (or be kiln-dried), and a permanent record had been create d—a record that has survived millennia of natural erosion and human destruc- tiveness. In place after place—in centers of commerce or of a dministra- tion, in temples and palaces, in all parts of the a ncient Near East— there were both state and private archives full of such tablets; and there were also actual libraries where the tablets, tens of thousands of them, were neatly arranged by subject, their con tents entitled, their scribe named, their sequel numbered.

It was only with the discovery of the records conce rning Sargon of Agade that modern scholars were able to convince themselves that a great kingdom, the Kingdom of Akkad, had ind eed arisen in Mesopotamia half a millennium before Assyria and Ba bylonia were to flourish. It was with the greatest amazement tha t scholars read in these records that Sargon \"defeated Uruk and tore d own its wall. . . . Sargon, king of Agade, was victorious o ver the inhab- itants of Ur. ... He defeated E-Nimmar and tore dow n its wall and defeated its territory from Lagash as far as th e sea. His weap- ons he washed in the sea. In the battle with the in habitants of Umma he was victorious. . . .\" The scholars were incredulous: Could there have bee n urban centers, walled cities, even before Sargon of Agade . even before 2500 B.C.? As is now known, indeed there were. These were the cities and urban centers of Sumer, the \"Sumer\" in the title \"k ing of Sumer and Akkad.\" It was, as a century of archaeological discoveries and scholarly research has established, the land where Civilization began nearly six thousand years ago; where suddenly and inexpli- cably, as though out of nowhere, there appeared a w ritten language and literature; kings and priests; schools and temp les; doctors and astronomers; high-rise buildings, canals, docks, an d ships; an in- tensive agriculture; an advanced metallurgy; a text ile industry; trade and commerce; laws and concepts of justice an d morality; cosmological theories; and tales and records of his tory and prehis- tory. In all these writings, be it long epic tales or two -line proverbs, in inscriptions mundane or divine, the same facts e merge as an unshakable tenet of the Sumerians and the peoples t hat followed them: in bygone days, the DIN.GIR—\"The Righteous On es of the Rocketships,\" the beings the Greeks began to call \" gods\"—had come to Earth from their own planet. They chose sou thern Meso- potamia to be their home away from home. They calle d the land KI.EN.GIR—\"Land of the Lord of the Rockets\" (the Ak kadian name, Shumer, meant \"Land of the Guardians\"); and t hey estab- lished there the first settlements on Earth.

The Sumerians consider ed it a twelfth member of our Solar System—a system made up of the Sun in the center, the Moon, all the nine planets we know of t oday, and one more large planet whose orbit lasts a Sar, 3,600 Ea rth-years. This orbit, they wrote, takes the planet to a \"station\" in the distant heavens, then brings it back to Earth's vicinity, c rossing between Mars and Jupiter. It was in that position—as depict ed in a 4,500-year-old Sumerian drawing (Fig. 19) that the planet ob- tained its name NIBIRU (\"Crossing\") and its symbol, the Cross. The leader of the astronauts who had come to Earth from Nibiru, we know from numerous ancient texts, was called E. A (\"Whose House Is Water\"); after he had landed and establish ed Eridu, the first Earth Station, he assumed the title EN.KI (\"L ord of Earth\"). A text that was discovered in the ruins of Sumer re cords his landing on Earth as a first-person report: When I approached Earth there was much flooding. When I approached its green meadows, heaps and mounds were piled up at my command. I built my house in a pure place . . . My house—its shade stretches over the Snake Marsh."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"78 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The text then proceeds to describe Ea's efforts to build extraor- dinary waterworks in the marshlands at the head of the Persian Gulf: He surveyed the marshlands, cut canals for dr ainage and water control, built dykes, dug ditches, and built structures of bricks molded from the local clays. He joined the T igris and Euphrates rivers by canals; and at the edge of the marshlands he built his Water House, with a wharf and other facil ities. It all had a reason. On his planet gold was needed. Not for jew- elry or another frivolous use, for at no time durin g the millennia that followed were these visitors to Earth ever shown we aring golden jewelry. Gold was. no doubt, required for the space programs of the Nibiruans, as is evident from the Hindu texts' references to the celestial chariots being covered with gold; indeed, gold is vital to many aspects of the space instruments and vehicles of our own times. But that alone could not have been the reaso n for the inten- sity of the Nibiruans' search for gold on Earth and their immense efforts to obtain it here and transfer it in large quantities to their own planet. The metal, with its unique properties, was needed back home for a vital need, affecting the very surv ival of life on that planet; as best as we can make out, this vital need could have been for suspending the gold particles in Nibiru's waning atmo- sphere and thus shield it from critical dissipation . A son of Nibiru's ruler, Ea was well chosen for the mission. He was a brilliant scientist and engineer whose nic kname was NU.DIM.MUD, \"He Who Fashions Things.\" The plan, as his epithet-name E.A. indicated, was to extract the gol d from the waters of the quiet Persian Gulf and the adjoining shallow marsh- lands that extended from the gulf into Mesopotamia. Sumerian de- pictions showed Ea as lord of the flowing waters, s itting in a laboratory and surrounded by interconnected flasks (Fig. 20). But the unfolding tale suggests that all was not go ing well with this scheme. The gold production was far below expe ctations, and to speed it up, more astronauts—the rank and file w ere called Anunnaki (\"Those Who From Heaven to Earth Came\")—la nded on Earth. They came in groups of fifty, and one of the texts reveals that one of these groups was led by Enki's firstbor n son MAR.DUK. The text records Marduk's urgent message t o his fa- ther describing a near-calamity on the flight to Ea rth, as the space- ship passed by one of the Solar System's large plan ets (probably Jupiter) and almost collided with one of that plane t's satellites.

Back on the home planet, where Enki's father AN (An u in Akka- dian) was the ruler, the progress of the landing pa rties was fol- lowed with anxiety and expectation. These must have turned to im- patience at the slow progress, and then to disappoi ntment. Evidently the scheme to extract gold from seawaters by laboratorylike processes did not work as expected. But the gold was still badly needed; and the Anunna ki faced a"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":" tough decision: to abandon the project—which was ou t of the question—or to try to obtain the gold in a new way: mining. For gold, the Anunnaki knew by then, was naturally avai lable in abun- dance in the AB.ZU (\"The Primeval Source\") on the c ontinent of Africa. (In the Semitic languages that had evolved from the Sume- rian. Za-ab—Abzu in reverse—has remained the word f or gold to this very day). There was, however, one major problem. The African gold had to be extracted from the depths of the earth th rough mining; and the far-reaching decision to change from the so phisticated water-treatment process to a backbreaking toil belo w the sur- face of the earth was not lightly taken. Clearly th e new enter- prise required more Anunnaki. a mining colony in \"t he place of the shining lodes,\" expanded facilities in Mesopota mia, and a fleet of ore vessels (MA.GUR UR.NU AB.ZU— \"Ships fo r Ores of the Abzu\") to connect the two. Could Enki h andle it all by himself? Anu felt that he could not; and eight Nibiru years after Enki's landing—28,800 Earth-years—he came to Earth to see things for himself. He came down accompanied by the Heir Appar ent EN.LIL (\"Lord of the Command\")—a son who, Anu must have felt, could take charge of Earth mission and organi ze the gold de- liveries to Nibiru. The choice of Enlil for the mission might have been a necessary one, but it must have been an agonizing one as well ; for it only sharpened the rivalry and jealousy between the two half-brothers. For Enki was the firstborn son of Anu by Id, one of his six concu- bines, and could have expected to follow Anu on Nib iru's throne. 80 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"The Earth Chronicles 81 But then—as in the biblical tale of Abraham, his co ncubine Hagar, and his half-sister wife Sarah—Anu's half-sister wi fe Antum bore him a son, Enlil. And by the Nibiruan rules of succ ession—so faithfully adopted by the biblical patriarch—Enlil became the legal heir instead of Enki. And now this rival, this robb er of Enki's birthright, came to Earth to take over the command! One cannot stress enough the importance of lineage and geneal- ogy in the Wars of the Gods; the struggles for succ ession and su- premacy, on Nibiru as on Earth later on. Indeed, as we unravel the puzzling persistence and ferocity of the wars of the gods, trying to fit them into the f ramework of his- tory and prehistory—a task never undertaken before— it becomes clear that they stemmed from a code of sexual behav ior based not on morality but on considerations of genetic purity . At the core of these wars lay an intricate genealogy that determin ed hierarchy and succession; and sexual acts were judged not by thei r tenderness or violence but by their purpose and outcome. There is a Sumerian tale of how Enlil, commander-in -chief of the Anunnaki, took a fancy to a young nurse whom he saw swim- ming naked in the river. He persuaded her to go sai ling with him and made love to her against her protestations (\"my vulva is small, it knows not intercourse\"). In spite of his rank En lil was arrested by the \"fifty senior gods\" as he returned to his city Nippur and was found by \"the seven Anunnaki who judge\" to have com mitted the crime of rape; they sentenced him to exile in the A bzu. (He was pardoned only when he married the young goddess, wh o had fol- lowed him into exile.) Many songs celebrated the love affair between Inann a and a young god named Dumuzi, in which their \"sleep-outs\" were de- scribed with touching tenderness: O that they put his hand in my hand for me. O that they put his heart next to my heart for me. Not only is it sweet to sleep hand in hand with him . Sweetest of sweet is also the loveliness of joining heart to heart with him. We can understand the approving tone of the verse b ecause Dumuzi was the intended bridegroom of Inanna, chose n by her with the approval of her brother Utu/Shamash. But h ow to explain a text in which Inanna describes passionate lovemak ing with her own brother?"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"82 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN My beloved met me, took his pleasure of me. rejoiced together with me.

This can only be understood if we bear in mind that the code pro- hibited marriage, but not lovemaking, between full brother and sis- ter. On the other hand, marriage with a half-sister was allowed; male progeny by a half-sister even had precedence i n the hierar- chical order. And while rape was condemned, sex—eve n irregular and violent—was condoned if done for the sake of su ccession to the throne. A long tale relates how Enki. seeking a mal e son by his (and Enlil's) half-sister Sud, forced his attention s on her when she was alone and \"poured the semen in the womb.\" When she gave birth to a daughter (rather than to a son), Enki lo st no time making love to the girl as soon as she became \"young and f air ...

When Enki engaged in these sexual efforts, he was a lready es- poused to Ninki, which illustrates that the same co de which con- demned rape did not prohibit extramarital affairs p er se. We also know that the gods were allowed any number of wives and concu- bines (a text catalogued as CT-24 listed six of Anu 's concubines), but, if married, they had to select one as their of ficial spouse- preferring, as we have mentioned, a half-sister for this role. If the god, apart from his given name and many epit hets, was also bestowed with a title-name, his official conso rt was also hon- ored with the feminine form of such title. Thus whe n AN received his title-name (\"The Heavenly\"), his consort was ca lled ANTU, Anu and Antum in Akkadian. The nurse who had marrie d Enlil (\"Lord of Command\") received the title-name Ninlil (\"Lady of Command\"); Enki's spouse Damkina was called Ninki, and soon. Because of the importance of the family relationshi ps between these great Anunnaki, many so-called God Lists prep ared by an- cient scribes were genealogical in nature. In one s uch major list, titled by the ancient scribes the \"AN : ilu Anum'' series, there are"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"The Earth Chronicles 83 listed the \"forty-two foreparents of Enlil,\" clearl y arranged as twenty-one divine couples. This must have been a ma rk of great royal lineage, for two similar documents for Anu al so list his twenty-one ancestral couples on Nibiru. We learn th at the parents of Anu were AN.SHAR.GAL (\"Great Prince of Heaven\") and KI.SHAR.GAL (\"Great Princess of Firm Ground\"). As t heir names indicate, they were not the reigning couple o n Nibiru: rather, the father was the Great Prince, meaning th e heir apparent; and his spouse was a great princess, the firstborn daughter of the ruler (by a different wife) and thus a half-sister of Anshargal. In these genealogical facts lies the key to the und erstanding of the events on Nibiru before the landing on Earth, a nd on Earth thereafter. Sending Ea to Earth for gold implies that the Nibir uans had al- ready been aware of the metal's availability on Ear th well before the landing was launched. How? One could offer several answers: They could have pr obed Earth with unmanned satellites, as we have been doing to other planets in our Solar System. They could have surveyed Earth by landing on it, as we have done on our Moon. Indeed, their land ing on Mars cannot be ruled out as we read texts dealing with t he space voyages from Nibiru to Earth. Whether and when such manned premeditated landings on Earth had taken place, we do not know. But there does exi st an ancient chronicle dealing with an earlier landing in dramat ic circum- stances: when the deposed ruler of Nibiru escaped t o Earth in his spacecraft! The event must have happened before Ea was sent to Earth by his father, for it was through that event that Anu became Nibiru's ruler. Indeed the event was the usurpation of the t hrone on Nibiru by Anu. The information is contained in a text whose Hittit e version has been titled by scholars Kingship in Heaven. It thro ws light on life at the royal court of Nibiru and tells a tale of betra yal and usurpation worthy of a Shakespearean plot. It reveals that whe n the time for succession arrived on Nibiru—through natural death or other- wise—it was not Anshargal, Anu's father and the hei r apparent, who had ascended the throne. Instead a relative nam ed Alalu (Alalush in the Hittite text) became the ruler.

The Sumerian King Lists report that the first administr ator of Eridu was called Alulim—a name that could have been yet anoth er epithet for Ea/Enki, or the Sumerian rendering of Alalu's name; the possibil- ity thus comes to mind that, though deposed, Alalu was suffi- ciently concerned about Nibiru's fate to advise his deposer that he had found gold in Earth's waters. That this is inde ed what had hap- pened might be indicated by the fact that a reconci liation between deposed and deposer did ensue; for Anu went ahead a nd appointed Kumarbi, a grandson of Alalu, to be his royal cup-b earer. But the gesture of reconciliation only caused histo ry on Nibiru to repeat itself. In spite of all the bestowed honors, the young Kum- arbi could not forget that Anu had usurped the thro ne from his grandfather; and as time went on, Kumarbi's enmity toward Anu was becoming more and more obvious, and Anu \"could not with- stand the gaze of Kumarbi's eyes.\" And so it was that, having decided to leave Nibiru for Earth and even take the Heir Apparent (Enlil) with him, Anu d eemed it safer also to take along the young Kumarbi. Both decision s—to take En- lil with him and to take Kumarbi along—ended up mak ing the visit one marred by strife and—for Anu—also filled with p ersonal ag- ony. The decision to bring Enlil to Earth and put him in charge led to heated arguments with Enki—arguments echoed in the texts so far discovered. The angry Enki threatened to leave Eart h and return to Nibiru: but could he be trusted not to usurp the th rone there? If. as a compromise. Anu himself were to stay on Earth, ap pointing Enlil as surrogate ruler on Nibiru, could Enlil be truste d to step down when Anu returned? Finally it was decided to draw l ots: let chance determine how it shall be. The division of authorit y that ensued is repeatedly mentioned in Sumerian and Akkadian texts . One of the longest of the Earth Chronicles, a text called The Atra-Hasis Epic, records the drawing of lots and its outcome: The gods clasped hands together, then cast lots and divided: Anu to heaven went up; To Enlil the Earth was made subject; That which the sea as a loop encloses,"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"86 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN they gave to the prince Enki.

Believing that he had managed to separate the rival brothers, \"Anu to Heaven went up.\" But in the skies above Ear th, an unex- pected turn of events awaited him. Perhaps as a pre caution, Kum- arbi was left on the space platform orbiting Earth; when Anu returned to it, ready to take off on the long voyag e back to Nibiru, he was confronted by an angry Kumarbi. Harsh words soon gave way to a scuffle: \"Anu gave battle to Kumarbi, Kuma rbi gave bat- tle to Anu.\" As Kumarbi bested Anu in the wrestling , \"Anu strug- gled free from the hands of Kumarbi.\" But Kumarbi m anaged to grab Anu by his feet, and \"bit between his knees,\" hurting Anu in his \"manhood.\" Ancient depictions were found of the event (Fig. 23a), as well as of the habit of wrestling Anunnaki (Fig. 23b) to hurt one another in the genitals.

And, as in the Greek ta les, this episode set the stage for the wars between the gods and the Titans. After Anu had left, Earth Mission was launched in e arnest. As more Anunnaki landed on Earth—their number rose in time to 600—some were assigned to the Lower World to hel p Enki mine the gold; others manned the ore ships; and the rest stayed with En- lil in Mesopotamia. There, additional settlements w ere established in accordance with a master plan l a i d out by Enlil, as part of a com- plete organizational plan of action and clear-cut p rocedures: He perfected the procedures, the divine ordinances; Established five cities in perfect places, Called them by name, Laid them out as centers. The first of these cities, Eridu, He granted to Nudimmud, the pioneer. Each of these pre-Diluvial settlements in Mesopotam ia had a specific function, revealed by its name. First was E.RI.DU— \"House in Faraway Built\"—the gold-extracting facili ty by the waters' edge, which for all time remained Ea's Meso potamian abode. Next came BAD.TIBIRA—\"Bright Place Where the Ores Are Made Final\"—the metallurgical center for smelti ng and refin- ing. Next LA.RA.AK—\"Seeing the Bright Glow\"—was a beacon-city to guide the landing shuttlecraft. SIPP AR—\"Bird City\"—was the Landing Place; and SHU.RUP.PAK-\"The P lace of Utmost Well-Being\"—was equipped as a medical cen ter; it was put in the charge of SUD (\"She Who Resuscitates\"), a half-sister of both Enki and Enlil. Another beacon-city. LA.AR.SA (\"Seeing the Red Ligh t\"), was also built, for the complex operation depended on c lose coordina- tion between the Anunnaki who had landed on Earth a nd 300 as- tronauts, called IGI.GI (\"Those Who See and Observe \"), who remained in constant Earth orbit. Acting as interme diaries between Earth and Nibiru, the Igigi stayed in Earth's skies on orbiting plat- forms, to which the processed ores were delivered f rom Earth by shuttlecraft, thereafter to be transferred to prope r spaceships, which could ferry the gold to the Home Planet as it periodically neared Earth in its vast elliptical orbit.

But first there were the lingering and bitter strug gles between the House of Anu and the House of Alalu, an enmity that burst out on Earth into the War of the Titans. It was a war that pitted \"the gods who are in heaven\" against the \"gods who are upon d ark-hued Earth\"; it was. in its last climactic phase, an upr ising of the Igigi!

Ea suggested that Kumarbi \"ascend to heaven\" and se ek the help of Lama, who was \"mother of the two gods\" and thus, appar- ently, an ancestral matriarch of the two contesting dynasties. With some self-interest, Ea offered to transport Kumarbi to the Celestial Abode in his MAR.GID.DA (celestial chariot), which the Akka- dians called Ti-ia-ri-ta, \"the flying vehicle.\" But the goddess, having found out that Ea was coming without the per mission of the Assembly of the Gods, sent \"lightning winds\" agains t Ea's space- craft, forcing him and Kumarbi to return to Earth.

By combining portions of Old Babylonian and Assyria n versions of the Sumerian text, a good deal of the tale has been restored. But dam- aged portions still held the secret of Zu's true id entity, as well as an explanation of how he had gained access to the Dirg a. Only in 1979 did two scholars (W. W. Hallo and W. L. Moran) come up with the answer by using a tablet found in the Babylonian Co llection of Yale University to reconstruct the beginning of the anci ent tale. In Sumerian the name ZU meant \"He Who Knows.\" one e xpert in certain knowledge. Several references to the evi l hero of this tale as AN.ZU—\"He Who Knows the Heavens\"—suggest a conne c- tion with the space program that had linked Earth w ith Nibiru; and the now-restored beginning of the chronicle indeed relates how Zu. an orphan, was adopted by the astronauts who manned the shuttlecraft and orbiting platforms, the Igigi—lear ning from them the secrets of the heavens and of space travel. The action begins as the Igigi, \"being gathered fro m all parts,\" decided to make an appeal to Enlil. Their complaint was that \"until that time for the Igigi a break-taking place had no t yet been built.\" In other words, there simply was no facility on Ear th for the rest and recreation of the Igigi, where they could relax from the rigors of space and its weightlessness. To voice their com plaint they se- lected Zu to be their spokesman, sending him to Enl il's center in Nippur. Enlil, \"the father of the gods, in the Dur-An-Ki, s aw him, and thought of what they [the Igigi] said.\" As \"in his mind he pon- dered\" the request, \"he studied the heavenly Zu clo sely.\" Who, after all, was this emissary, not one of the astron auts and yet wear- ing their uniform? As his suspicions grew, Ea—aware of Zu's true ancestry—spoke up; he suggested to Enlil that a dec ision on the re- quest of the Igigi could be postponed if Zu were de layed at Enlil's headquarters. \"Your service let him enter,\" Ea said to Enlil; \"in the sanctuary, to the innermost seat, let him be th e one to block the way.\" To the words that Ea spoke to him the god [Enlil] consented.

Ninurta in his \"Whirlwind Bird.\" he said, should then come as close as possib le to the Bird of Zu, until they are \"wing to wing.\" Then he should a im the missile at the \"pinions\" of Zu's Whirlbird. and \"let the missi le fly like a light- ning; when the Fiery Brilliance will engulf the pin ions, his wings will vibrate like butterflies; then will Zu be vanquishe d.\" The final battle scenes are missing from all the ta blets, but we know that more than one \"Whirlbird\" participated in the combat. Fragments of duplicates, found in the ruins of a Hi ttite archive at a site now called Sultan-Tepe, tell us that Ninurta a rrayed \"seven whirlwinds which stir up the dust,\" armed his chari ot with the"},{"pageNumber":102,"pageContent":"The Wars of the Olden Gods 99 \"111 Winds\" weapons, and attacked Zu as suggested b y his fa- ther. \"The earth shook . . . the [illegible] became dark, the skies became black ... the pinions of Zu were overcome.\" Zu was captured and brought back before Enlil in Nippur; t he Tablet of Destinies was reinstalled where it belonged: \"Lords hip again en- tered the Ekur; the Divine Formulas were returned.\" The captured Zu was put on trial before a court-mar tial consist- ing of the Seven Great Anunnaki; he was found guilt y and sen- tenced to death; Ninurta, his vanquisher, \"cut his throat.\" Many depictions were found showing the trial scene, in w hich Zu, on ac- count of his association with the Igigi astronauts, was dressed up as a bird. An archaic relief found in central Mesopota mia illustrated the actual execution of Zu. This one shows Zu—who b elonged to those \"Who Observe and See\"—as a demonic cock with an extra eye in the forehead (Fig. 26).

Perhaps because of the assumptio n that the spirit of Zu—representing betrayal, duplicity, and all evi l in general- persists in causing ill and suffering, the trial an d execution of Zu were transmitted to mankind's generations in the fo rm of an elabo- rate ritual. In this annual commemoration a bull wa s chosen to stand for Zu and atone for his evil deed. Long instructions for the ritual have been found in both Babylo- nian and Assyrian versions, all indicating their ea rlier Sumerian source. After extensive preparations, a \"great bull , strong bull who treads upon clean pastures\" was brought into th e temple and purified on the first day of a certain month. It wa s then whispered into the bull's left ear through a reed tube: \"Bull , the guilty Zu are you\"; and into the right ear: \"Bull, you have been chosen for the rite and the ceremonies.\" On the fifteenth day the bull was brought before the images of \"the Seven Gods Who Judge\" and the sym- bols of the twelve celestial bodies of the Solar Sy stem. The trial of Zu was then reenacted. The bull was pu t down be- fore Enlil, \"the Great Shepherd.\" The accusing prie st recited rhe- torical accusational questions, as though addressed to Enlil: How could you have given \"the stored treasure\" to the e nemy? How could you have let him come and dwell in the \"pure place\"? How could he gain access to your quarters? Then the playacting called for Ea and other gods to beseech Enlil to ca lm himself, for Ninurta had stepped forward and asked his father: \" Point my hands in the right direction! Give me the right words of command!\" Following this recital of the evidence given at the trial, judgment was passed. As the bull was being slaughtered in ac cordance with detailed instructions, the priests recited the bull 's verdict: His liver was to be boiled in a sacrifical kettle; his skin a nd muscles were to be burned inside the temple; but his \"evil tongue s hall remain out- side.\" Then the priests, playing the roles of the other go ds, broke out in a hymn of praise to Ninurta: Wash your hands, wash your hands! You are now as Enlil, wash your hands! You are as Enlil [upon] the Earth; May all the gods rejoice in you! When the gods looked for a volunteer to fight Zu, t hey promised the vanquisher of Zu:"},{"pageNumber":104,"pageContent":"The Wars of the Olden Gods 101 Thy name shall be the greatest in the Assembly of the Great Gods; Among the gods, thy brothers, thou shall have no equal; Glorified before the gods and potent shall be thy name! After Ninurta's victory the promise had to be kept. Bui therein was the rub and the seed of future fights among the gods: Ninurta was indeed Enlil's Legal Heir but on Nibiru, not on Earth. Now, as the commemorative temple ritual makes clear, he was made \"as Enlil—upon Earth.\" We know from other texts dealing with the gods of Sumer and Akkad that their hierarchical ord er was also ex- pressed numerically. Anu was given the highest numb er of the Su- merian sexagesimal system, 60. His Legal Heir, Enli l, had the rank of 50; the firstborn son (and heir in the even t of Enlil's demise), Ea, was 40. Now, as the enigmatic statemen t that Ninurta has become \"as Enlil\" attests, he, too, was given t he rank of 50. The partly mutilated ending of the temple ritual te xt contains the following legible verses: \"O Marduk, for your king speak the words: 'I release!' O Adad, for your king speak the words: 'I re- lease!' \" We can safely guess that the mutilated li nes also included a similar release by Sin of his claim to kingship a mong the gods and recognition of Ninurta's Enlilship. We know tha t thereafter, Sin —Enlil's firstborn on Earth—held the rank of 30, hi s son Shamash 20, and his daughter Ishtar 15, and Ishkur (Adad in Akkadian) the rank of 10. (There is no record of Marduk's numeric al rank.) The conspiracy of Zu and his evil plotting remained also in man- kind's memory, evolving into a fear of birdlike dem ons who can cause affliction and pestilence (Fig. 27). Some of these demons were called Lillu, a term that played on the double meaning \"to howl\" and \"of the night\"; their female leader, Lill itu—Lilith— was depicted as a naked, winged goddess with birdli ke feet (Fig. 28). The many shurpu (\"purification by burning\") te xts that have been found were formulas for incantations against t hese evil spirits—forerunners of the sorcery and witchcraft t hat had lasted throughout the millennia. In spite of the solemn vows taken after the defeat of Zu to honor and respect Enlil's supremacy and Ninurta's positio n as second-in- command, the basic factors causing rivalry and cont ention had remained—breaking into the open from time to time i n the ensuing"},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":" Fig. 27 millennia. Realizing that this would be so, Anu and Enlil provided Ninurta with new, marvelous weapons. Anu gave him t he SHAR.UR (\"Supreme Hunter\") and the SHAR.GAZ (\"Supreme Smite r\"); Enlil gave him several weapons, of which the unique IB—a weapon with \"fifty killing heads\"—was the most awes ome, lead- ing to references in the chronicles to Ninurta as \" The Lord of the Ib.\" Thus armed, Ninurta became the \"Foremost Warri or of En- lil,\" ready to fight off all challenges to the Enli lship. The next such challenge came in the shape of a muti ny of the Anunnaki who were working in the gold mines of the Abzu. The mutiny, and the events that had led to it and follo wed it, are fully described in a text called by scholars The Atra-Has is Epic—a full- fledged Earth Chronicle which, inter alia, records the events that had led to the creation of Homo sapiens—Man as we k now him. The text informs us that after Anu had gone back to Nibiru and Earth was divided between Enlil and Enki, the Anunn aki toiled in the mines of the Abzu for \"forty counted periods\"—f orty orbits of their planet, or 144,000 Earth-years.

It was then that Enlil decided to go to the Abzu and personally evaluate t he situation. The discontended Anunnaki seized the opportunity to mutiny! The Alra-Hasis chronicle, in language as vivid as t hat of a mod- ern reporter, in more than 150 lines of text, unamb iguously de- scribes the events that followed: How the rebelliou s Anunnaki put their tools on fire and, in the middle of the night , marched on En- lil's dwelling; how some shouted \"Let us kill him . .. Let us break the yoke!\"; how an unnamed leader reminded th em that En- lil was the \"Chief Officer of Old Time,\" and advise d negotiations; and how Enlil, enraged, took up his weapons, but he , too, was re- minded by his chamberlain: \"My lord, these are your sons. . . .\" As Enlil remained a prisoner in his own quarters, h e sent a mes- sage to Anu and asked that he come to Earth. When A nu arrived, the Great Anunnaki assembled for a court-martial. \" Enki, Ruler of the Abzu. was also present.\" Enlil demanded to know who the in- stigator of the mutiny was, calling for a death pen alty. Not getting the support of Anu, Enlil offered his resignation: \"Noble one,\" he said to Anu, \"take away the office, take away the p ower; to Heaven will I ascend with you.\" But Anu, calming En lil, also ex- pressed understanding of the miners' hardships. Encouraged, Enki \"opened his mouth and addressed th e gods.\" Repeating Anu*s summation, he had a solution to off er: While the Chief Medical Officer, their sister Sud, was here i n the Abzu with them: Let her create a Primitive Worker; And let him bear the yoke . . . Let the Worker carry the toil of the gods, Let him bear the yoke! In the following one hundred lines of the Alra-Hasi s text, and in several other \"Creation of Man\" texts that have bee n discovered in various states of preservation, the tale of the gen etic engineering of Homo sapiens has been told in amazing detail.

The fertilized egg was then implanted in the womb of a female Anunnaki, for the required period of preg- nancy. When the \"mixed creature\" was bom, Sud lifte d him up and shouted: \"I have created! My hands have made it!\" The \"Primitive Worker\"— Homo sapiens—had come into be- ing. It happened some 300,000 years ago: it came ab out through a feat of genetic engineering and embryo-implant tech niques which mankind itself is beginning to employ. There has un doubtedly been a long process of evolution; but then the Anun naki had taken a hand in the process and jumped the gun on evoluti on, \"creating\" us sooner than we might have evolved on our own. Sc holars have been searching for a long time for the \"missing lin k\" in man's ev- olution. The Sumerian texts reveal that the \"missin g link\" was a feat of genetic manipulation performed in a laborat ory. . . . It was not a feat over and done with in an instant. The te xts make clear that it had taken the Anunnaki considerable trial a nd error to achieve the desired \"perfect model\" of the Primitiv e Worker, but once achieved, a mass-production process was launch ed: fourteen \"birth goddesses\" at a time were implanted with the genetically manipulated Apewomen eggs: seven to bear male and s even to bear female Workers. As soon as they grew up, the W orkers were put to work in the mines; and as their numbers grew , they assumed more and more of the physical chores in the Abzu. The armed clash between Enlil and Enki that was soo n to take place, however, was over these same slave laborers. . . . The more the production of ores improved in the Abz u, the greater was the work load on the Anunnaki that had remained to operate the facilities in Mesopotamia. The climate was milder, rains were more plentiful, and the rivers of Mesopo tamia were con- stantly overflowing. Increasingly the Mesopotamian Anunnaki \"were digging the river,\" raising dikes and deepeni ng the canals. Soon they too began to clamor for the slave workers , the \"crea- tures of bright countenance\" but with thick black h air: The Anunnaki stepped up to Enlil . . .

The Anunnaki in the Abzu assembled the Primitive Wo rkers in a central compound, strengthening its walls against t he coming at- tack.

Unbeknownst to Enlil, and with the connivance of Sud, Enki cont rived to give the new creature one more genetic twist: granting to th e hybrid beings—incapable of procreating, as all hybrids are —the ability to have offspring, the sexual \"Knowing\" for having chi ldren. The event is echoed in the biblical tale of Adam and Ev e in the Garden of Eden, and although the original Sumerian text of the tale has not yet been found, a number of Sumerian depictions of the event were indeed discovered.

W. King's The Seven Tablets o f Creation, scholars and theologians alike have come to recogni ze that the Cre- ation Tales of the Old Testamant (Genesis Chapters 1 through 3) are condensed and edited versions of original Sumer ian texts. A century later, in our work, The 12th Planet (1976), we have shown that these texts were no primitive myths, but depos itories of ad- vanced scientific knowledge with which modern schol ars are only now beginning to catch up. The unmanned space probes of Jupiter and Saturn con firmed many \"incredible\" facets of the Sumerian knowledge regarding our Solar System, such as that the outer planets ha ve numerous sat- ellites and that water is present on some of them. Those distant planets, and some of their principal satellites, we re found to have active cores that generate internal heat; some radi ate out more heat than they can ever receive from the distant Sun. Vo lcanic activity provided those celestial bodies with their own atmo spheres. All the basic requirements for the development of life exis t out there, just as the Sumerians had said 6,000 years ago. What, then, of the existence of a twelfth member of our Solar System—a tenth planet beyond Pluto, the Sumerian Ni biru (and Babylonian Marduk)—a planet whose existence was a b asic and far-reaching conclusion in The 12th Planet? In 1978, astronomers at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Wash- ington determined that Pluto—being smaller than for merly be- lieved—could not by itself account for perturbation s in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune; they postulated the existence o f yet another celestial body beyond Pluto. In 1982 the U.S. Natio nal Aeronau- tics and Space Administration (NASA) announced its conclusion that there indeed exists such a body; whether or no t it is another large planet, it planned to determine by deploying in a certain man- ner its two Pioneer spacecraft that had been hurtli ng into space be- yond Saturn. 109"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"110 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN And at the close of 1983, astronomers at the Jet Pr opulsion Lab- oratory in California announced that IRAS—the infra red telescope mounted on a spacecraft and launched under NASA's a uspices with the cooperation of other nations—had discovere d beyond Pluto a very distant '\"mystery celestial body\" abou t four times the size of Earth and moving toward Earth. They have no t yet called it a planet; but our Earth Chronicles leave the ultima te finding in no doubt. In 1983, rocks were found in Antarctica and elsewhe re which are undoubtedly fragments of the Moon and Mars; and the scien- tists are totally baffled as to how that could have happened. The Sumerian tale of the Creation of the Solar System, the collision be- tween Nibiru's satellites and Tiamat, and the rest of the cosmogony in the celebrated Epic of Creation offer a comprehe nsive explana- tion. And what about the texts describing how Man was cre ated through genetic manipulation: in vitro fertilizatio n and reimplanta- tion? Recent advances in genetic sciences and technologie s have af- firmed the Sumerian concept of gradual evolution on the one hand, and on the other hand, the (otherwise inexplicable) appearance of the biologically advanced Homo sapiens through gene tic engineer- ing by the Anunnaki. Even the very recent method of test tube procreation—extracting a female egg, impregnating i t with purified male semen, and reimplanting the fertilized egg in a woman's womb—is the very same procedure described in the Su merian texts from millennia ago. If the two principal events—the creation of Earth a nd the cre- ation of Man—are correctly reported in the Bible, o ught we not to accept the veracity of the biblical tale regarding the emergence of mankind on Earth? And if the biblical tales are but a condensed versi on of more de- tailed, earlier Sumerian chronicles, could not the latter be used to enhance and complete the biblical record of those e arliest times? Since one is the reflection of the other, let us ho ld up a mirror to that ancient flame of memories. . . . Let us contin ue the unrav- eling of the wondrous tale. After relating how \"The Adam\" (literally, \"the Eart hling\") was granted the ability to procreate, the Book of G enesis moves from recounting the general events on Earth to the saga of a spe- cific branch of mankind: the person named Adam and his descen- dants."},{"pageNumber":114,"pageContent":"Mankind Emerges 111 \"This is the Book of the Generations of Adam,\" the Old Testa- ment informs us. Such a book, we can safely assume, had surely existed. The evidence strongly suggests that the pe rson whom the Bible called Adam was the one whom the Sumerians ca lled Adapa, an Earthling \"perfected\" by Enki and deemed to have been genet- ically related to him. \"Wide understanding Enki per fected for him, to disclose the designs of the Earth; to him he gav e Knowing; but immortality he did not give him.\" Portions of the \"Tale of Adapa\" have been found; th e complete text might well have been the \"Book of the Generati ons of Adam\" to which the Old Testament refers. Assyrian kings p robably had access to such a record, for many of them claimed t o have retained one or another of Adapa's virtues. Sargon and Senna cherib held that they had inherited the wisdom that Enki had gr anted Adapa; Sinsharishkun and Esarhaddon boasted that they were bom \"in the image of the wise Adapa\"; according to an inscripti on of Esarhaddon. he had erected in the temple of Ashura statue with the image of Adapa; and Ashurbanipal asserted that he h ad learned \"the secret of tablet-writing from before the Delug e\" as Adapa had known. The Sumerian sources hold that there had been both rural cultures—cultivation and shepherding—as well as urb an settle- ments before the Deluge had swept all off the face of the Earth. The Book of Genesis relates that the first son of A dam and Eve, Cain, \"was a tiller of the earth,\" and his brother Abel \"was a herder of sheep.\" Then, after Cain was exiled \"away from the presence of the Lord\" for having killed Abel, urban settlements- Cities of Man—were established: in the land of Nud, east of Eden, Cain had a son whom he named Enoch and built a city called like- wise, the name meaning \"Foundation.\" The Old Testam ent, hav- ing no particular interest in the line of Cain, ski ps quickly to the fourth generation after Enoch, when Lamech was born : And Lamech took unto himself two wives: The name of one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of such as dwell in tents and have cattle. And his brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all such as play lyre and pipe. And Zillah also bore Tubal-Cain, an artificer of gold and copper and iron."},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"112 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The pseudepigraphical Book of Jubilees, believed to have been composed in the second century B.C. from earlier ma terial, adds the in- formation that Cain espoused his own sister Awan an d she bore him Enoch \"at the close of the fourth Jubilee. And in t he first year of the first week of the fifth Jubilee, houses were built on the earth, and Cain built a city and called its name Foundation, after the name of his son.\" Where did this additional information come from? It has long been held that this part of the Genesis tale stands alone, without corroboration or parallel in the Mes opotamian texts. But we have found that it is just not so. First, we have come upon a Babylonian tablet in the British Mu- seum (No. 74329, Fig. 31), catalogued as \"containin g an other- wise unknown myth.\" Yet it may in fact be a Babylon ian/Assyrian version from circa 2000 B . C . of a missing Sumerian record of the Line of Cain! As copied by A. R. Millard and translated by W. G. Lambert (Kadmos, vol. VI), it speaks of the beginnings of a group of people who were ploughmen, which corresponds to the biblic al \"tiller of the land.\" They are called Amakandu—\"People Who In Sorrow Roam\"; it parallels the condemnation of Cain: \"Bann ed be thou from the soil which hath received thy brother's blo od ... a rest- less nomad shaft thou be upon the earth.\" And, most remarkably, the Mesopotamian chief of these exiled people was c alled Ka'in! Also, just as in the biblical tale: He built in Dunnu a city with twin towers. Ka'in dedicated to himself the lordship over the city. The name of this place is intriguing. Because the o rder of sylla- bles could be reversed in Sumerian without changing the meaning, the name could also be spelled NU.DUN, paralleling the biblical name Nud as the place of Cain's exile. The Sumerian name meant \"the excavated resting place\"—very much similar to the biblical interpretation of the name as meaning \"Foundation.\" After the death (or murder) of Ka'in, \"he was laid to rest in the city of Dunnu, which he loved.\" As in the biblical tale, the Meso- potamian text records the history of four following generations: brothers married their sisters and murdered their p arents, taking over the rulership in Dunnu as well as settling in new places, the last of which was named Shupat (\"Judgment\")."},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":"Mankind Emerges 113 Fig. 31"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"114 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN A second source indicating Mesopotamian chronicles for the biblical tale of Adam and his son Cain are Assyrian texts. We find, for example, that an archaic Assyrian King List sta tes that in the earliest times, when their forefathers were tent-dw ellers—a term duplicated in the Bible regarding the line of Cain— the patriarch of their people was named Adamu, the biblical Adam. We also find among traditional Assyrian eponyms of royal names the combination Ashur-bel-Ka'ini (\"Ashur, lor d of the Ka'- inites\"); and the Assyrian scribes paralleled this with the Sumerian ASHUR-EN.DUNI (\"Ashur is lord of Duni\"), implying t hat the Ka'ini (\"The people of Kain\") and the Duni (\"The pe ople of Dun\") were one and the same; and thus reaffirming t he biblical Cain and Land of Nud or Dun. Having dealt briefly with the line of Cain, the Old Testament turned its full attention to a new line descended o f Adam: \"And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and c alled his name Seth, for [she said] the Lord hath granted me anoth er offspring in- stead of Abel, whom Cain had slain.\" The Book of Ge nesis then adds: \"One hundred and thirty years did Adam live w hen he begot a son in his likeness and after his image, and call ed his name Seth. \"And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth we re eight hundred years, and he begot [other) sons and daught ers; and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty y ears, and he died. And Seth lived a hundred and five years and b egot Enosh; and after he begot Enosh Seth lived eight hundred a nd seven years, and he begot [other] sons and daughters; and all th e days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.\" The name of Seth's son and the next pre-Diluvial pa triarch in which the Bible was interested was Enosh; it has co me to mean in Hebrew \"Human, Mortal,\" and it is clear that the Ol d Testament considered him the progenitor of the human lineage at the core of the ancient chronicles. It states in respect to him , that \"It was then that the name of Yahweh began to be called,\" that w orship and priesthood began. There are a number of Sumerian texts that shed more light on this intriguing aspect. The available portions of t he Adapa text state that he was \"perfected\" and treated as a son by Enki in Enki's city Eridu. It is likely then, as William Ha llo (Antediluvian Cities) had suggested, that the great-grandson of E nosh was named Yared to mean \"He of Eridu.\" Here, then, is the ans wer: While the Bible loses interest in the banished descendant s of Adam, it fo-"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"Mankind Emerges 115 cuses its attention on the patriarchs from Adam's l ine who had stayed in Eden—southern Mesopotamia—and were the fi rst to be called to priesthood. In the fourth generation after Enosh the firstborn son was named Enoch; scholars believe that here the name's meanin g stemmed from a variant of the Hebrew root, connoting \"to tr ain, to edu- cate.\" Of him the Old Testament briefly states that he \"had walked with the Deity\" and did not die on Earth, \"f or the Deity had taken him.\" The sole verse in Genesis 5:24 is s ubstantially en- larged upon in the extra-biblical Books of Enoch.

The Sumerian King List records the priestly reign o f Enmedu- ranki in Sippar, then the location of the Spaceport under the com- mand of Utu/Shamash. His name, \"Priestly lord of th e Dur-an-ki,\" indicates that he had been trained in Nippur. A lit tle-known tablet, reported by W. G.

T he Book of Genesis only hints at the situation by stating that when Noah (\"Respite\") was born, he was so named by his father in the hope that his birth shall signal a respite \"from th e work and toil that cometh from the Earth which the Lord hath curs ed.\" The biblical version tells us little about Noah, apart from the fact that he was \"righteous and of pure genealogy.\" The Mesopo- tamian texts inform us that the hero of the Deluge lived in Shuruppak, the medical center run by Sud. The Sumerian texts relate that as mankind's hardshi ps were in- creasing, Enki suggested, and Enlil vehemently oppo sed, the tak- ing of measures to alleviate the suffering. What up set Enlil no end was the increasing sexual relationships between the young male Anunnaki and the Daughters of Man. The Book of Gene sis de- scribes the \"taking of wives\" by the Nefilim in the following words: And it came to pass, When the Earthlings began to increase in number upon the face of the Earth, and daughters were born unto them— That the sons of the gods saw the daughters of the Earthlings that they were compatible; And they took unto themselves wives of whichever they chose. A \"mythical tablet\" (CBS-14061) reported by E. Chie ra (Su- merian Religious Texts) tells the story of those ea rly days and of a young god named Martu, who complained that he, too, should be permitted to espouse a human wife. It happened, the text begins, when The city of Nin-ab existed, Shid-tab did not exist; The holy tiara existed, the holy crown did not exis t . . . Cohabitation there was . . . Bringing forth [of children] there was."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"Mankind Emerges 117 \"Nin-ab,\" the text continues, \"was a city in the se ttled Great Land.\" Its high priest, an accomplished musician, h ad a wife and a daughter. As the people gathered to offer the gods the roasted meat of the sacrifices, Martu, who was single, saw the p riest's daughter. Desiring her, he went to his mother and complained: In my city I have friends, they have taken wives. I have companions, they have taken wives. In my city, unlike my friends, I have not taken a w ife; I have no wife, I have no children. Asking whether the maiden whom he desired \"apprecia ted his gaze,\" the goddess gave her consent. The other youn g gods then prepared a feast; as the marriage was announced, \"i n the city of Nin-ab, the people by the sound of the copper drum were called; the seven tambourines were sounded.\" This growing togetherness between the young astrona uts and the descendants of the Primitive Worker was not to Enid 's liking. The Sumerian texts tell us that \"as the Land extended a nd the people multiplied,\" Enlil became increasingly \"disturbed b y Mankind's pronouncements\" and its infatuation with sex and lu st. The get- togethers between the Anunnaki and the daughters of Man caused him to lose sleep. \"And the Lord said: 'I will dest roy the Earthling whom I have created off the face of the Earth.' The texts inform us that when it was decided to dev elop the deep mines in the Abzu, the Anunnaki also proceeded to e stablish a sci- entific monitoring station at the tip of Africa. It was put in charge of Ereshkigal, a granddaughter of Enlil. A Sumerian epic tale re- corded the hazardous voyage of Enki and Ereshkigal from Meso- potamia to that far-off mountainland (Kur)—a text t hat implies that Ereshkigal was either abducted or in some other man ner coerced by Enki on that voyage, having been \"carried off to Ku r as a prize.\" (Ereshkigal, we know from other epics, was later on attacked at her station by Nergal, one of Enki's sons, as a res ult of an insult involving Ereshkigal's emissary. At the last moment , Ereshkigal saved her life by offering Nergal to marry her and control together with her the station's \"Tablets of Wisdom.\") Enlil now saw his chance to get rid of the Earthlin gs when this scientific station at the tip of Africa began to re port a dangerous sit- uation: the growing ice cap over Antarctica had bec ome unstable, resting upon a layer of slippery slush. The problem was that this instability had developed just as Nibiru was about to make its ap-"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"118 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN proach to Earth's vicinity; and Nibiru's gravitatio nal pull could up- set the ice cap's balance and cause it to slip into the Antarctic Ocean. The immense tidal waves that this would caus e could engulf the whole globe. When the Igigi orbiting Earth confirmed the certain ty of such a catastrophe, the Anunnaki began to assemble in Sipp ar. the spaceport. Enlil, however, insisted that mankind be kept unaware of the coming Deluge; and at a special session of t he Assembly of the Gods, he made all of them, and especially Enki, swear to keep the secret. The last part of the Atra-Hasis text, a major part of the Epic of Gilgamesh, and other Mesopotamian texts describe at length the events that followed—how the catastrophe of the Del uge was used by Enlil to achieve the annihilation of mankind; an d how Enki, op- posed to the decision which Enlil forced upon the A ssembly of the Gods, contrived to save his faithful follower Ziusu dra (\"Noah\") by designing for him a submersible vessel that coul d withstand the avalanche of water. The Anunnaki themselves, on a signal, \"lifted up\" i n their Rukub ilani (\"chariots of the gods\"), the fired-up rocket ships \"setting the land ablaze with their glare.\" Orbitin g the Earth in their shuttlecraft, they watched in horror the onsl aught of the tidal waves below. All that was upon the Earth was swept off in one co- lossal avalanche of water: A.MA.RU BA.UR RA.TA—\"The Flood swept thereover.\" Sud, who had created Man wi th Enki. \"saw and wept. . . . Ishtar cried out like a woman in travail . . . the gods, the Anunnaki. weep with her.\" Rolling bac k and forth, the tidal waves swept the soil away, leaving behind vast deposits of mud: \"All that had been created, turned back to cla y.\" In The 12th Planet we have presented the evidence f or our con- clusion that the Deluge, bringing about an abrupt e nd to the last Ice Age, had occurred some 13,000 years ago. As the waters of the Deluge \"went back from off the land\" and started to subside, the Anunnaki began to land on M ount Nisir (\"Mount of Salvation\")—Mount Ararat. There Ziusudra /Noah also arrived, his vessel guided by a navigator prov ided by Enki. Enlil was outraged to discover that the \"seed of Ma nkind\" was saved; but Enki persuaded him to relent: The gods, he argued, could no longer exist on Earth without the help of man. \"And the Lord blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the Earth.' \""},{"pageNumber":122,"pageContent":"Mankind Emerges 119 The Old Testament, focusing its interest on the lin e of Noah alone, lists no other passengers in the rescue ship . But the more de- tailed Mesopotamian Deluge texts also mention the A rk's naviga- tor and disclose that at the last moment friends or helpers of Ziusudra (and their families) also came on board. G reek versions of the account by Berossus state that after the Del uge, Ziusudra, his family, and the pilot were taken by the gods to stay with them; the other people were given directions to find thei r way back to Mesopotamia by themselves. The immediate problem facing all that were rescued was food. To Noah and his sons the Lord said: \"All the animal s that are upon the earth, and all that flies in the skies, and all that creepeth on the ground, and all the fishes of the sea, into your ha nds are given; all that teemeth and that liveth, shall be yours for fo od.\" And then came a significant addition: \"As grassy vegetation all manner of grain have I given you.\" This little-noticed statement (Genesis 9:3), which touches on the origins of agriculture, is substantially enlarged u pon in the Sumerian texts. Scholars are agreed that agriculture began i n the Mesopotamia- SyriaTsraei crescent but are at a loss to explain w hy it did not begin in the plains (where cultivation is easy) but rather i n the highlands. They are agreed that it began with the harvesting of \"wi ld ancestors\" of wheat and barley some 12,000 years ago but are baff led by the genetic uniformity of those early grain grasses; and they a re totally at a loss to explain the botano-genetic feat whereby—within a me re 2,000 years- such wild emmers doubled, trebled, and quadrupled t heir chromo- some pairs to become the cultivable wheat and barle y of outstanding nutritional value with the incredible ability to gr ow almost any- where and with the unusual twice-a-year crops. Coupled with these puzzles was the equal suddenness with which every manner of fruit and vegetable began to appear from the same nuclear area at almost the same time, and the simulta- neous \"domestication\" of animals, starling with she ep and goats that provided meat, milk, and wool. How did it all come about when it did? Modern scien ce has yet to find the answer; but the Sumerian texts had alre ady provided it millennia ago. Like the Bible, they relate how agri culture began af- ter the Deluge, when (in the words of Genesis) \"Noa h began as a husbandman\"; but like the Bible, which records that there had been t i l l i n g of the land (by Cain) and shepherding (by Abel) long before the Deluge, so do the Sumerian chronicles te ll of the devel- opment of crop-growing and cattle-rearing in prehis toric times."},{"pageNumber":123,"pageContent":"120 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN When the Anunnaki had landed on Earth, a text title d by schol- ars The Myth of Cattle and Grain states, none of th e domesticated grains or cattle had yet been in existence: When from the heights of Heaven to Earth Anu had caused the Anunnaki to come forth.

After the Deluge had swept all off the face of the Earth, the first problem facing the Anunnaki was where to get the se eds needed for renewed cultivation. Fortunately specimens of the d omesticated cereals had been sent to Nibiru; and now \"Anu provi ded them, from Heaven, to Enlil.\" Enlil then looked for a saf e place where the seeds could be sown to restart agriculture.

We read this description in a Sumerian text: Famine was severe, nothing was produced. The small rivers were not cleaned, the mud was not carried off . . . In all the lands there were no crops, only weeds grew. The two great rivers of Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and Tigris, were also not functioning: \"The Euphrates was not b ound to- gether, there was misery; the Tigris was confounded , jolted and in- jured.\" The one who rose to the task of building da ms in the mountains, digging new channels for the rivers, and draining off the excess water was Ninurta: \"Thereon the lord set s his lofty mind; Ninurta, the son of Enlil, brings great thing s into being\": To protect the land, a mighty wall he raised.

A long text, gradually pieced together by scholars, The Feats and Exploits of Ninurta, adds a tragic note to Ninu rta's efforts to bring back order to the Earth on which he was super ior. To cover all the problem spots at once, Ninurta rushed from place to place in the mountains in his airship; but \"His Winged Bird on the summit was smashed; its pinions crashed down to the earth. \" (An unclear verse suggests that he was rescued by Adad.) We know from the Sumerian texts that first to be cu ltivated on the mountain slopes were fruit trees and bushes and most certainly grapes.

Fig. 33 While Enlil and Ninurta were credited with granting agriculture to mankind, the credit for the introduction of dome sticated herds was given to Enki. It was after the first grains we re already in culti- vation but not yet \"the grain that multiplies,\" the grains with the doubled, tripled, and quadrupled chromosomes; these were created by Enki artificially, with Enlil's consent: At that time Enki spoke to Enlil: \"Father Enlil, flocks and grains have made joyful the Holy Mound, have greatly multiplied in the Holy Mound. Let us, Enki and Enlil, command: The woolly-creature and grain-that-multiplies let us cause to come out of the Holy Mound.\" Enlil agreed, and abundance followed: The woolly-creature they placed in a sheepfold.

The revolutionary agricultural tool—a simple, but i ngeniously designed, wooden implement—the plow, was at first p ulled, as the above text states, by putting a yoke on the farm wo rkers. But then Enki \"brought into existence the larger living crea tures\"—domes- ticated cattle—and bulls replaced people as pullers of the plow (Fig. 34). Thus, the texts conclude, did the gods \" increase the fer- t i l i t y of the land.\" Fig. 34 While Ninurta was busy damming the mountains flanki ng Meso- potamia and draining its plains.

Just as in"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"126 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Mesopotamia \"abundance\" was based on riverine culti vation, so it had to be in Africa; and he turned his attention , planning, and knowledge to the recovery of the Valley of the Nile . The Egyptians, we have seen, held that their great gods had come to Egypt from Ur (meaning \"the olden place\"). According to Manetho, the reign of Ptah over the lands of the Nile began 17,900 years before Menes; i.e., circa 21,000 B . C . Nine thousand years later Ptah handed over the Egyptian domain to his son Ra; but the latter's reign was abruptly interrupted aft er a brief 1,000 years, i.e., circa 11,000 B . C ; it was then, by our reckoning, that the Deluge had occurred. Then, the Egyptians believed, Ptah returned to Egyp t to engage in great works of reclamation and to literally rais e it from under the inundating waters. We find Sumerian texts that like wise attest that Enki went to the lands of Mcluhha (Ethiopia/Nubia) and Magan (Egypt) to make them habitable for man and beast: He proceeds to the Land Meluhha; Enki, lord of the Abzu, decrees its fate: Black land, may your trees be large trees, may they be the Highland trees. May thrones fill your royal palaces. May your reeds be large reeds, may they be the Highland reeds . . . May your bulls be large bulls, may they be the Highland bulls . . . May your silver be as gold. May your copper be tin and bronze . . . May your people multiply; May your hero go forth as a bull . . . These Sumerian records, linking Enki with the Afric an lands of the Nile, assume a double significance: they corrob orate the Egyp- tian tales with Mesopotamian tales and link Sumeria n gods— especially the Enki-gods—with the gods of Egypt; fo r Ptah, we believe, was none other than Enki. After the lands were made habitable again, Enki div ided the length of the African continent between his six son s (Fig. 35). The southernmost domain was regranted to NER.GAL (\"Grea t Watch- er\") and his spouse Ereshkigal.

Farther north, in the grazing plateau of the Sudan, the you ngest son, DUMU.ZI (\"Son Who Is Life\"), whose nickname was \"Th e Herder,\" was given reign. Fig. 35 The identity of yet another son is in dispute among the scholars (we shall offer our own solution later on). But the re is no doubt who the sixth son—actually Enki's firstborn and leg al heir—was: He was MAR.DUK (\"Son of the Pure Mound\"). Because o ne of his fifty epithets was ASAR, which sounds so much l ike the Egyp- tian As-Sar (\"Osiris\" in Greek), some scholars have speculated that Marduk and Osiris were one and the same. But t hese epithets (as \"All-Powerful\" or \"Awesome\") were applied to di verse dei- ties, and Asar meaning \"All-Seeing\" was also the ep ithet-name of the Assyrian god Ashur. In fact, we find more similarities between the Baby lonian Mar- duk and the Egyptian god Ra: the former was the son of Enki, the latter of Ptah, the two, Enki-Ptah, being in our vi ew one and the same; whereas Osiris was the great-grandson of Ra a nd thus of a much later generation than either Ra or Marduk. In fact, there is found in Sumerian texts scattered, but persistent, evidence sup- porting our belief that the god called Ra by the Eg yptians and Mar- duk by the Mesopotamians was one and the same deity . Thus, a self-laudatory hymn to Marduk (tablet Ashur/4125) d eclares that one of his epithets was \"The god IM.KUR.GAR RA\"-\"Ra Who Beside the Mountainland Abides.\" Moreover, there is textual evidence that the Sumeri ans were aware of the deity's Egyptian name, Ra.

But the Great God of Egypt, Marduk/Ra, yearned to rule the whole Earth, and to do so from the olden \"Navel of the Earth\" in Mesopotamia.

It is a docu- ment that holds a wealth of reliable historical, ge ographical, and political information concerning the rise of mankin d's remnants from the mud and desolation following the Deluge, t o the heights of civilizations and empires. Leaving the all-important line of Shem to the last, the Table of Nations begins with the descendants of Japhet (\"The Fair One\"): \"And the sons of Japhet: Gomer and Magog and Madai, Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras. And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphat and Togarmah; and the sons of Javan: Eli shah and Tar- shish, the Kittim and the Dodanim. From them branch ed out the is- land nations.\" While the later generations had thus spread to coastal areas and islands, the unnoticed fact was t hat all the first seven nation/sons corresponded to the highlands of Asia Minor, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea areas—highlands t hat were hab- itable soon after the Deluge, unlike the lower lyin g coastal areas and islands that could become habitable only much l ater. The descendants of Ham (\"He Who is Hot\" and also \"T he Dark-Hued One\"), first \"Cush and Mizra'im and Put a nd Ca- naan\" and thereafter a host of other nation-states, correspond to the African nation-lands of Nubia, Ethiopia, Egypt, and Libya as the core nations of African resettlement, again beg inning with the topographically higher areas, then spreading to the lowlands. \"And Shem, the father of all who descended of Eber, also had offspring; he was the elder brother of Japhet.'' Th e first nation-sons of Shem were \"Elam and Ashur, Arpakhshad and Lud and A ram,\" nation-states that encompassed the highlands archin g from the Persian 129"},{"pageNumber":133,"pageContent":"130 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Gulf\" in the south to the Mediterranean Sea in the northwest and bor- dering the great Land-Between-the-Rivers, which was as yet not habit- able. Those were the lands one could call the Space port Lands: Mes- opotamia, where the pre-Diluvial spaceport had been ; the Cedar Mountain, where the Landing Place remained function ing; the Land of Shalem, where the post-Diluvial Mission Control Center was to be established; and the adjoining Sinai peninsula, sit e of the future spaceport. The name of the forefather of all these nations, Shem— meaning \"Sky Chamber\"—was thus quite appropriate. The broad division of mankind into three branches, as related in the Bible, followed not only the geography and topo graphy of the areas to which man had spread, it also followed the division of the Earth between the descendants of Enlil and the desc endants of Enki. Shem and Japhet are depicted in the Bible as good brothers, whereas the attitude toward the line of Ham—and esp ecially Ca- naan—is one of bitter memories. In this there lie t ales yet to be told—tales of gods and men. and their wars. . . . The tradition of the division of the ancient settle d world into three branches is also in accord with what we know of the rise of civilizations. Scholars have recognized an abrupt change in human culture about 11,000 B.C.—the time of the Deluge, according to ou r findings—and have named that era of domestication Mesolithic (Mi ddle Stone Age). Circa 7400 B.C.—exactly 3,600 years later—another a brupt advance- ment has been recognized. Scholars have named it Ne olithic (\"New Stone Age\"); but its principal feature was the swit ch from stone to clay and the appearance of pottery. And then, \"sudd enly and inex- plicably\"—but exactly 3,600 years later—there bloss omed out (circa 3800 B . C .) in the plain between the Euphrates and Tigris river s the high civilization of Sumer. It was followed, circa 3100 B.C., by the civilization of the Nile River; and circa 2800 B . C ., the third civiliza- tion of antiquity, that of the Indus River, made it s appearance. These were the three regions allotted to mankind; of them evolved the na- tions of the Near East, Africa, and Indo-Europe—a d ivision faith- fully recorded in the Old Testament's Table of Nati ons. All that, Sumerian chronicles held, was the result of deliberate decisions by the Anunnaki: The Anunnaki who decree the fates sat exchanging their counsels regarding the Earth. The four regions they created."},{"pageNumber":134,"pageContent":"When Earth Was Divided 131 With these simple words, echoed in several Sumerian texts, the post-Diluvial fate of Earth and its inhabitants was decided. Three regions were allotted to mankind's three civilizati ons; the fourth was retained by the Anunnaki for their own use. It was given the name TIL.MUN, \"Land of the Missiles.\" In The Stairw ay to Heaven we provided the evidence identifying Tilmun with the Sinai peninsula. Although as far as human habitation was concerned, it was the descendants of Shem—\"Sand Dwellers\" in Egyptian scrip- tures—who could reside in the unrestricted areas of the peninsu- la, when it came to allotting the territory among t he Anunnaki, profound differences arose. Control of the site of the post- Diluvial spaceport was tantamount to control of the links be- tween Earth and Nibiru, as the experiences with Kum arbi and Zu had so clearly shown. In the rekindled rivalry betw een the clans of Enlil and Enki, a neutral authority over the Lan d of the Mis- siles was called for. The solution was ingenious. Of equal lineage with t hem was their sister Sud. As a daughter of Anu, she bore th e title NIN.MAH (\"Great Lady\"). She was one of the original group o f Great Anun- naki who were pioneers on Earth, a member of the Pa ntheon of Twelve. She bore a son to Enlil, a daughter to Enki , and was lov- ingly called Mammi (\"Mother of the Gods\"). She help ed create Man. With her medical skills she saved many a life and was also known as NIN.TI (\"Lady Life\"). But she never had he r own do- minions. To make Tilmun her domain was an idea that no one op- posed. The Sinai peninsula is a barren place, occupied by high granite peaks in the south, a mountainous plateau in the ce nter, and a hard- soiled plain in its northern third, surrounded by c hains of low mountains and hills. Then there is a strip of sand dunes, sliding to the Mediterranean coast. But where water can be ret ained, as in several oases or in riverbeds that fill up during b rief winter rains and keep the moisture below the surface, luxuriant date palms, fruits, and vegetables grow, and herds of sheep and goats can graze. The region must have been as forbidding millennia a go as it is now.

We read of these deeds in Tablet IX of the \"Feats and Exploits of Ninurta,\" as he addre sses his mother: Since you, noble lady, alone to the Land of Landing had gone. Since to the Land of Casting Down unafraid you went— A dam I shall heap up for you, so that the Land may have a mistress. Completing his irrigation works, and bringing over people to perform the required tasks, Ninurta assured his mot her that she would have an abundance of vegetation, wood product s, and min- erals in her mountain abode: Its valleys shall be verdant with vegetation.

This is indeed a befitting description of the Sinai peninsula: a land of mines, a major source in antiquity of coppe r, turquoise, and other minerals; a source of the acacia wood, which was used for temple furnishings; a verdant place wherever water was available; a place where flocks could graze. Is it an accident that the principal winter-river of the peninsula is still called el Ar ish—\"The Hus- bandman\"—the very nickname (Urash) of Ninurta? Making a home for his mother in the Sinai's souther n region of high granite peaks, Ninurta bestowed on her a ne w title: NIN.HAR.SAG (\"Lady of the Head Mountain\"); it was t he title by which Sud was to be called ever since. The term \"head mountain\" indicates that it was the highest peak in the area. This is the mountain nowadays known as Mount St. Katherine, a peak revered from antiquity, millennia before the nearby monastery was built. Rising nearby is the sl ightly lower peak called by the monks Mount Moses, suggesting th at it is the Mount Sinai of the Exodus. Though this is doubtful, the fact re- mains that the twin peaks have been deemed to be sa cred from an- tiquity. We believe that this was so because they p layed a pivotal role in the planning of the post-Diluvial spaceport and the Landing Corridor leading to it. These new plans adopted the old principles; and to understand the grand post-Diluvial design, we must first revie w the manner in which the pre-Diluvial spaceport and its Landing Co rridor were de- veloped. At that time the Anunnaki first selected a s their focal point the twin-peaked Mount Ararat, the highest pea k in Western Asia and thus the natural landmark most visible fro m the skies. The next natural and visible features were the Euphrate s River and the Persian Gulf. Drawing an imaginary north-south line from Ararat, the Anunnaki determined that the spaceport shall be where the line intersected the river. Then, diagonally to it from the direction of the Persian Gulf—at a precise angle of forty-five d egrees—they drew the Landing Path. They then laid out their fir st settlements so as to mark out a Landing Corridor on both sides of the Landing Path. In the center point, Nippur was established as a Mi ssion Control Cen- ter; all the other settlements were equidistant fro m it (Fig. 25). The post-Diluvial space facilities were planned on the same principles. The twin-peaked Mount Ararat served as the major fo-"},{"pageNumber":137,"pageContent":"134 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN cal point; a line at forty-five degrees marked the Landing Path, and a combination of natural and artificial landmarks o utlined an arrowlike Landing Corridor. The difference was, how ever, that this time the Anunnaki had at their disposal the re ady-made Plat- form in the Cedar Mountain (Baalbek), and they inco rporated it into the new Landing Grid. As before the Deluge, the twin-peaked Mount Ararat was to serve again as the northern landmark, anchoring the Landing Cor- ridor and the Landing Path in the center of the Cor ridor (Fig. 37).

The northern line of the Landing Corridor was a lin e extending from Ararat through the Landing Platform of Baalbek and con- tinuing into Egypt. There the terrain is too flat t o offer natural landmarks, and it was thus, we are certain, that th e Anunnaki pro- ceeded to build the artificial twin peaks of the tw o great pyra- mids of Giza. But where was this anchor to be erected? Here came into play an east-west imaginary line, ar bitrarily con- ceived by the Anunnaki in their space sciences. The y arbitrarily divided the skies enveloping Earth into three bands or '\"ways.\" The northern one was the \"Way of Enlil,\" the southe rn one the \"Way of Enki,\" and the central one the \"Way of Anu. \" Separat- ing them were the lines known to us as the 30th par allel north and the 30th parallel south. The 30th parallel north appears to have been of par ticular— \"sacred\"—significance. Holy cities from antiquity o n, from Egypt to Tibet, have been located on it. It was cho sen to be the line on which (at the intersection of the Ararat-Baalbek line) the great pyramids were to be built; and also the line which would indicate, in the Sinai's central plain, the site of the Space port (SP). A line in the precise middle of the Landing Corridor, the Lan ding Path, was to lead to the exact location of the Spaceport on t he 30th parallel. This, we believe, is how the Landing Grid was laid out, how the site of the Spaceport was marked off, and how the g reat pyramids of Giza had come into being. By suggesting that the great pyramids of Giza were built not by Pharaohs but by the Anunnaki millennia earlier, we of course con- tradict long-held theories concerning these pyramid s. The theory of nineteenth-century Egyptologists, tha t the Egyptian pyramids, including the unique three at Giza, were erected by a suc- cession of Pharaohs as grandiose tombs for themselv es, has long been disproven: not one of them was found to contain the body of the Pha- raoh who was their known or presumed builder. Accor dingly, the Great Pyramid of Giza was supposed to have been bui lt by Khufu (Cheops), its twin by a successor named Chefra (Che phren), and the third, small one by a third successor, Menkara (Myc erinus)—all kings of the sixth dynasty. The Sphinx, the same Egyptolo gists presume,"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"136 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN must have been built by Chephren, because it is sit uated next to a causeway leading to the Second Pyramid. For a while it was believed that proof had been fou nd in the smallest one of the three pyramids of Giza and the identity of the Pharaoh who had built it established. The credit fo r this was claimed by a Colonel Howard Vyse and his two assist ants, who claimed to have discovered within the pyramid the c offin and mummified remains of the Pharaoh Menkara. The fact, however— known to scholars for some time now but for some re ason still hardly publicized—is that neither the wooden coffin nor the skele- tal remains were authentic. Someone—undoubtedly tha t Colonel Vyse and his cronies—had brought into the pyramid a coffin dating from about 2.000 years after Menkara had lived, and bones from the even much later Christian times, and put the tw o together in an unabashed archaeological fraud. The current theories regarding the pyramids' builde rs are an- chored to an even greater extent on the discovery o f the name Khufu inscribed in hieroglyphics within a long-seal ed compart- ment within the Great Pyramid and thus apparently e stablishing the identity of its builder. Unnoticed has gone the fac t that the discov- erer of that inscription was the same Colonel Vyse and his assis- tants (the year was 1837). In The Stairway to Heave n we have put together substantial evidence to show that the insc ription was a forg- ery, perpetrated by its •\"discoverers.\" At the end of 1983, a reader of that book came forward to provide us with family records showing that his great-grandfather, a master mason named Hum- phries Brewer, who was engaged by Vyse to help use gunpowder to blast his way inside the pyramid, was an eyewitn ess to the forg- ery and, having objected to the deed, was expelled from the site and forced to leave Egypt altogether! In The Stairway to Heaven we have shown that Khufu could not have been the builder of the Great Pyramid because he had already referred to it as existing in his time in a stela h e had erected near the pyramids; even the Sphinx, supposedly erected by th e next-after successor of Khufu, is mentioned in that inscriptio n. Now we find that pictorial evidence from the time o f the Pha- raohs of the very first dynasty—long before Khufu a nd his succes- sors—conclusively shows that these early kings had already witnessed the Giza marvels. We can clearly see the Sphinx both in depictions of the king's journey to the Afterlife ( Fig. 38a) and in a scene of his investiture by \"Ancient Ones\" arriving in Egypt by boat (Fig. 38b). We also submit in evidence the wel l-known vic-"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"When Earth Was Divided 137 Fig. 38 tory tablet of the very first Pharaoh, Menes, which depicts his forceful unification of Egypt. On one side he is sh own wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt, defeating its chieftain s and con- quering their cities. On the other side the tablet shows him (Fig. 39a) wearing the red crown of Lower Egypt, marching through its districts and beheading its chieftains. To the righ t of his head the artist spelled out the epithet \"Nar-Mer\" acquired b y the king; to the left the tablet depicts the most important stru cture in the newly acquired districts—the pyramid (Fig. 39b). All scholars agree that the tablet depicts realisti cally the places, fortifications, and enemies encountered by Menes in his campaign to unify Upper and Lower Egypt; yet the pyramid sym bol is the only one that appears to have escaped the otherwise careful inter- pretation. We hold that this symbol, as all others on the tablet, was drawn and included so prominently in the Lower Egyp t side be- cause such a structure had actually existed there. The whole Giza complex—pyramids and Sphinx—had thus already existed when kingship began in Egypt; its b uilders were not and could not have been the Pharaohs of th e sixth dy- nasty. The other pyramids of Egypt—smaller, primitive by c ompari- son, some fallen even before completion, all crumbl ing—had indeed been built by various Pharaohs; not as tombs , nor as ceno- taphs (monumental symbolic tombs), but in emulation of the gods.

Then, in keeping with the preference for twin-peaked focal points, t he two large pyra- mids were erected. Although the Second Pyramid is s maller than the Great Pyramid, it appears to be of the same height; this is because it is built on somewhat higher ground, so that to achieve the same height, it need not have been as tall as the first one. Apart from its incomparable size, the Great Pyramid is also unique in that, in addition to the descending passa ge that is found in all the other pyramids, it has a unique Ascendin g Passage, a level Corridor, two Upper Chambers, and a series of narrow com- partments (Fig. 40). The uppermost chamber is reach ed via an in- credibly elaborate Grand Gallery and an Antechamber that could be sealed with one pull of a cord. The uppermost ch amber contained—still does—an unusual hollowed-out stone block whose fashioning required amazing technology and which ra ng out as a bell; above the chamber are the narrow series of lo w and rugged spaces, offering extreme resonance.

We have found many similarities between these uniqu e features of the Great Pyramid and the pre-Diluvial E.KUR (\"H ouse Which Is Like a Mountain\") of Enlil, his ziggurat in Nipp ur. Like the Great Pyramid, it rose high to dominate the surroun ding plain. In pre-Diluvial times the Ekur of Nippur housed the DU R.AN.KI— \"Link Heaven-Earth\"—and served as Mission Control C enter, equipped with the Tablets of Destinies, the orbital data panels. It also contained the DIR.GA, a mysterious \"Dark Chamb er\" whose \"radiance\" guided the shuttlecraft to a landing at Sippar. But all that—the many mysteries and functions of th e Ekur de- scribed in the tale of Zu—was before the Deluge. Wh en Mesopota- mia was reinhabited and Nippur was reestablished, t he abode of Enlil and Ninlil there was a large temple surrounde d by courtyards, with gates through which the worshipers could enter . It was no longer forbidden territory; the space-related funct ions, as the Spaceport itself, had shifted elsewhere. As a new, mysterious, and awesome Ekur, the Sumeria n texts de- scribed a \"House Which Is Like a Mountain\" in a dis tant place, under the aegis of Ninharsag, not of Enlil. Thus, the epi c tale of an early post-Diluvial Sumerian king named Etana, who was ta ken aloft toward the Celestial Abode of the Anunnaki, states that hi s ascent began not far from the new Ekur, at the \"Place of the Eagles\" —not far, that is, from the Spaceport. An Akkadian \"Book of Job\" title d Ludlul Bel Nimeqi (\"I Praise the Lord of Deepness\") refers to the \"irresistible demon that has exited from the Ekur\" in a land \"acr oss the horizon, in the Lower World [Africa].\" Not recognizing the immense antiquity of the Giza p yramids or the identity of their true builders, scholars have also been puzzled by this apparent reference to an Ekur far from Sumer. Indee d, if one is to fol- low accepted interpretations of Mesopotamian texts, no one in Meso- potamia was ever aware of the existence of the Egyp tian pyramids. None of the Mesopotamian kings who invaded Egypt, n one of the merchants who traded with her, none of the emissari es who had visited mere—not one of them had noticed these colossal mon uments . . .

Both the pyr amid and the Sphinx near it are located by a river, as the Giza complex is indeed located by the Nile. And beyond all that is the bod y of water on which the horned gods are sailing, just as the Egyp tians had said that their gods had from the south, via the Red Sea .

The inevitable conclusion, then, is that the Great Pyramid was known in Mesopotamia, if for no other reason than b ecause it was built by the same Anunnaki who had built the origin al Ekur in Nippur; and likewise and quite logically, it, too, was called by them E.KUR—\"House Which Is Like a Mountain.\" Like i ts pre- decessor, the Great Pyramid of Giza was built with mysterious dark chambers and was equipped with instruments for guiding the shuttlecraft to the post-Diluvial Spaceport in the Sinai.

This, indee d, is the case; except that to the Egyptians she was known as Hat-H or. Textbooks will tell us that the name means \"House of Horus\"; but that is only superficially correct.

Ni nurta proved himself capable of damming and irrigation works; Ut u/Sha- mash knew how to command and operate the landing an d take- off facilities; but only Enki, the master engineer and scientist who had been through all this before, had the requi red know- how and experience for planning the massive constru ction works and supervising their execution. There is not even a hint in Sumerian texts that des cribe the achievements of Ninurta and Utu that either one of them had planned or engaged in space-related construction wo rks. When Ninurta, in later times, called upon a Sumerian kin g to build him a ziggurat with a special enclosure for his Divine Bi rd, it was another god, accompanying Ninurta. who gave the king the ar chitectural plans and building instructions. On the other hand, several texts re- ported that Enki had passed to his son Marduk the s cientific knowl- edge he had possessed. The texts report a conversat ion between father and son. after Marduk had approached his fat her with a diffi- cult question: Enki answered his son Marduk: \"My son. what is it you do not know?

Whatever I know, you know!\" Since the similarities between Ptah and Enki as the father, and Marduk and Ra as son, are so strong, we should not be surprised at all to find that Egyptian texts did connect Ra with space facilities and with related construction works. In this he was assisted by Shu and Tefnut, Geb and Nut, and Thoth, the god of magi cal things. The Sphinx, the \"divine guide\" that showed the way eastward ex- actly along the 30th parallel, bore the features of Hor-Akhti (\"Fal- con of the Horizon\")—the epithet for Ra. A stela er ected near the Sphinx in Pharaonic times bore an inscription that directly named Ra as the engineer (\"Extender of the Cord\") who bui lt the \"Pro- tected Place\" in the \"Sacred Desert.\" from which he could \"as- cend beautifully\" and \"traverse the skies\":"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"150 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Thou extendest the cords for the plan, thou didst give form to the lands . . .

An Egyptian tale concerning the Pharaoh Khufu and h is three sons reveals that in those days the secret plans of the Great Pyramid were in the custody of the god whom the Egyptians c alled Thoth, the god of astronomy, mathematics, geometry, and la nd survey- ing. It will be recalled that a unique feature of t he Great Pyramid was its upper chambers and passages. However, becau se these passages were sealed off—we shall show how, when, a nd why- just where they branch off from the descending pass age, all the Pharaohs who attempted to emulate the Giza pyramids built theirs with lower chambers only, being either unable to em ulate the upper chambers for lack of precise architectural knowledg e, or (in time) simply unaware of their existence. But Khufu, it se ems, was aware of the existence of these two secret chambers withi n the Great Pyr- amid, and at one point was on the verge of discover ing the plans of their construction, for he was told where the god T hoth had hidden them. Written on the so-called Westcar Papyrus and titled \"Tales of the Magicians,\" the tale relates that \"one day, when ki ng Khufu reigned over all the land,\" he called in his three sons and asked them to tell him tales of the \"deeds of the magicians\" of olden times.

Then the royal son B au-ef-Ra told of a miracle in the days of Khufu's earlier forefather, when a magician parted the waters of a lake, so that a jewel could be retrieved from its bottom; \"and then the magician spake and used his m agic speech and he brought the water of all the lake again to its p lace.\" Somewhat cynical, the third son Hor-De-Def arose an d spoke, saying: \"We have heard about the magicians of the p ast and their doings, the truth of which we cannot verify.

So he ordered that the sage Dedi be found and fetched from his abode, an island off the tip of the Sinai peninsula. When Dedi was brought before the Pharaoh, Khufu fir st tested his magical powers, such as bringing back to life a goose, a bird, and an ox, whose heads were cut off. Then Khufu ask ed: \"Is it true what is said, that thou knowest the Pdut numbers fo r the Iput of Thoth?\" And Dedi answered: \"I know not the numbers, O king, but I know the place the Pdut are in.\" Egyptologists are by and large agreed that Iput con veyed the meaning \"secret chambers of the primeval sanctuary\" and Pdut meant \"designs, plans with numbers.\" Answering Khufu, the magician (his age was given as one hun- dred and ten years) said: \"I know not the informati on in the designs, O king, but I know where the plans-with-numbers wer e hidden by Thoth.\" In answer to further questioning he said: \" There is a box of whetstone in the sacred chamber called the Chart Ro om in Heliop- olis; they are in that box.\" Excited, Khufu ordered Dedi to go and find the box for him. But Dedi answered that it was neither he nor Khufu who could obtain the box; it was destined to be found by a future de scendant of Khufu. This, he said, was decreed by Ra.

He was accompanied by his warriors, for the enemies had conspired against t h e i r lord. . . . Horus, the Winged Measurer, came to the boat of Ra. He said to his fo refather: 'O Falcon of the Horizon, I have seen the enemy conspi re against thy Lordship, to take the Luminous Crown unto thems elves.' . . . Then Ra, the holy one, the Falcon of the Hori zon, said unto Horus, the Winged Measurer: 'Lofty issue of Ra , my be- gotten: Go quickly, knock down the enemy whom you h ave seen.' Thus began the tale inscribed on the temple walls i n the ancient Egyptian city of Edfu. It is the tale, we believe, of what could only be called the First Pyramid War—a war that had its roots in the never-ending struggle for control over Earth and it s space facilities and in the shenanigans of the Great Anunnaki, espec ially En- ki/Ptah and his son Ra/Marduk. According to Manetho, Ptah turned over the dominion over Egypt after a reign of 9,000 years; but the reign o f Ra was cut short after 1,000 years—by the Deluge, we have concluded. Then there followed a reign of 700 years by Shu, who helped Ra \"control the skies over Earth,\" and the 500-year reign of Geb (\" Who Piles Up the Earth\"). It was at that time, circa 10,000 B.C. , that the space facilities—the Spaceport in the Sinai and the Giza pyramids—were built. Although the Sinai peninsula, where the Spaceport w as estab- lished, and the Giza pyramids were supposed to rema in neutral under the aegis of Ninharsag, it is doubtful whethe r the builders of these facilities—Enki and his descendants—had re ally any intention of relinquishing control over these insta llations. A Sumerian text, which begins with an idyllic descrip tion, has been named by scholars a \"Paradise Myth.\" Its ancie nt name was Enki and Ninharsag, and it is, in fact, a recor d of the polit- ically motivated lovemaking between the two, a tale of a deal 153"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"154 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN between Enki and his half-sister Ninharsag pertaini ng to the control of Egypt and the Sinai peninsula—of the pyr amids and the Spaceport. The tale's time is after Earth was apportioned betw een the An- unnaki, with Tilmun (the Sinai peninsula) granted t o Ninharsag and Egypt to Enki's clan. It was then, the Sumerian tale relates, that Enki crossed the marshy lakes that separated E gypt and the Sinai peninsula and came unto the lonely Ninharsag for an orgy of lovemaking: To the one who is alone. To the Lady of Life, mistress of the land. Enki came unto the wise Lady of Life. He causes his phallus to water the dikes; He causes his phallus to submerge the reeds . . . He poured his semen into the great lady of the Anun naki, poured the semen in the womb of Ninharsag; She took the semen into the womb, the semen of Enki . Enki's real intention was to obtain a son by his ha lf-sister; but the offspring was a daughter. Enki then made love t o the daughter as soon as she became \"young and fair,\" and then to his grand- daughter. As a result of these sexual activities, a total of eight gods—six female and two male—were born. Angered by the in- cest, Ninharsag used her medical skills to sicken E nki. The Anun- naki who were with him pleaded for his life, but Ni nharsag was determined: \"Until he is dead, I shall not look upo n him with the 'Eye of Life'!\" Satisfied that Enki had indeed been finally stopped . Ninurta— who went to Tilmun for inspection—returned to Mesop otamia to report the developments at a meeting attended by En lil, Nan- na/Sin, Utu/Shamash and Inanna/Ishtar. Unsatisfied, Enlil ordered Ninurta to return to Tilmun and bring back Ninharsa g with him. But in the interim, Ninharsag had pity on her broth er and changed her mind. \"Ninharsag seated Enki by her vulva and a sked: 'My brother, what hurts thee?' \" After she cured his bo dy part by part, Enki proposed that the two of them as masters of Eg ypt and the Sinai assign tasks, spouses, and territories to the eight young gods: Let Abu be the master of the plants; Let Nintulla be the lord of Magan; Let Ninsutu marry Ninazu;"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"The Pyramid Wars 155 Let Ninkashi be she who sates the thirsts; Let Nazi marry Nindara; Let Azimua many Ningishzida; Let Nintu be the queen of the months; Let Enshag be the lord of Tilmun! Egyptian theological texts from Memphis likewise he ld that \"there came into being\" eight gods from the heart, tongue, teeth, lips, and other parts of the body of Ptah. In this text, too, as in the Mesopotamian one. Ptah followed up the bringing for th of these gods by assigning abodes and territories to them: \" After he had formed the gods, he made cities, established distri cts, put the gods in their sacred abodes; he built their shrines and established their offerings.\" All that he did \"to make rejoice the he art of the Mis- tress of Life.\" If, as it appears, these tales had a basis in fact, then the rivalries that such confused parentages brought about could o nly be aggra- vated by the sexual shenanigans attributed to Ra as well. The most significant among these was the assertion that Osir is was truly the son of Ra and not of Geb, conceived when Ra had com e by stealth unto his own granddaughter. This, as we have earlie r related, lay at the core of the Osiris-Seth conflict. Why had Seth, to whom Upper Egypt had been allotted by Geb, coveted Lower Egypt, which was granted to Osir is? Egyptologists have offered explanations in terms of geography, the land's fertility, etc. But as we have shown, th ere was one more factor—one that, from the gods' point of view, was more important than how many crops a region could grow; the Great Pyramid and its companions at Giza; whoever control led them shared in the control of the space activities, of t he comings and goings of the gods, of the vital supply link to and from the Twelfth Planet. For a while Seth succeeded in his ambition, having outwitted Osiris. But \"in the year 363\" following the disappe arance of Osi- ris, the young Horus became the avenger of his fath er and launched a war against Seth—the First Pyramid War. It was, a s we have seen, also the first war in which the gods involved men in their struggles. Supported by other Enki-gods reigning in Africa, th e avenger Horus began the hostilities in Upper Egypt. Aided b y the Winged Disk that Thoth had fashioned for him.

After peacemaking efforts by other gods had failed. Seth and Horns engaged in personal combat in and ov er the Sinai peninsula. In the course of one battle, Seth hid in \"secret tunnels\" somewhere in the peninsula; in another battle, he l ost his testicles. So the Council of the Gods gave the whole of Egypt \"as heritage . . . to Horus.\" And what had become of Seth, one of the eight gods descended from Ptah? He was banished from Egypt and took up abode in Asi atic lands to the east, including a place that enabled him \"to speak out from the sky.\" Was he the god called Enshag in the Sumer ian tale of Enki and Ninharsag, the one to whom Tilmun (the Sin ai peninsula) was allotted by the two lovemakers? If so, then he was the Egyp- tian (Hamitic) god who had extended his domain over the land of Shem later known as Canaan. It was in this outcome of the First Pyramid War tha t there lies an understanding of biblical tales. Therein also lay t he causes of the Second Pyramid War. In addition to the Spaceport and the guidance facil ities, there was also a need after the Deluge for a new Mission Control Center, to replace the one that had existed before in Nippu r. We have shown (in The Stairway to Heaven) that the need to equidistance this center from the other space-related facilities dictated its locating on Mount Moriah (\"The Mount of Directing\") , the site of the future city of Jerusalem. That site, by both Mesopotamian and biblical accoun ts, was lo- cated in the lands of Shem—a dominion of the Enlili tes. Yet it ended up under an illegal occupation by the line of Enki, the Ham- itic gods, and by the descendants of the Hamitic Ca naan. The Old Testament refers to the land of which Jerus alem in time became the capital as Canaan, after the fourth and youngest son of Ham. It also singled out Canaan for special rebuke and consigned his descendants to be subservient to the descendant s of Shem. The improbable excuse for this treatment was that Ham—n ot his son Canaan—had inadvertently seen the naked genitals of his father Noah; therefore, the Lord had put a curse upon Cana an: \"Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto h is brethren . . .

Why was Canaan accursed if it was his fath er who had accidentally transgressed? Why was his punishment t o be a slave of Shem and to the god of Shem? And how were the gods involved in the crime and its punishment? As one re ads the sup- plemental information in the ex-biblical Book of Ju bilees, it be- comes clear that the real offense was the illegal o ccupation of Shem's territory. After mankind was dispersed and its various clans a llotted their lands, the Book of Jubilees relates, '\"Ham and his sons went to the land which he was to occupy, [the land] which he ac quired as his portion in the country of the south.\" But then, jou rneying from where Noah had been saved to his allotted land in A frica, \"Canaan saw the land of Lebanon [all the way down] to the r iver of Egypt, that it was very good.\" And so he changed his mind: \"He went not into the land of his inheritance to the west of the sea [west of the Red Sea); he dwelt [instead] in the land of Lebanon , eastward and westward of the Jordan.\" His father and his brothers tried to dissuade Canaa n from such an illegal act: \"And Ham his father, and Cush and Mizr a'im his brothers, said unto him: \"Thou hast settled in a la nd which is not thine, and which did not fall to us by lot; do not do so; for if thou dost do so, thou and thy sons will be fallen in the land and be ac- cursed through sedition; for by sedition ye have se ttled, and by se- dition will thy children fall, and thou shall be ro oted out forever. Dwell not in the dwelling of Shem; for to Shem and his sons did it come by their lot.' \" Were he to illegally occupy the territory assigned to Shem, they pointed out, \"Cursed art thou and cursed shalt thou be beyond the sons of Noah, by the curse which we bound ourselves by an oath in the presence of the Holy Judge and in the presence of Noah our fa- ther. . . . \"But Canaan did not hearken unto them, and dwelt in the land of Lebanon from Hamath to the entering of Egyp t, he and his sons until this day. For this reason is that la nd named Ca- naan.\" Behind the biblical and pseudoepigraphical tale of a territo- rial usurpation by a descendant of Ham must lie a t ale of a simi- lar usurpation by a descendant of the God of Egypt. We must bear in mind that at the time the allotment of land s and territo- ries was not among the peoples but among the gods; the gods, not the people, were the landlords. A people could only settle a territory allotted to their god and could occupy an other's terri-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"158 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN tory only if their god had extended his or her domi nion to that territory, by agreement or by force. The illegal se izure of the area between the Spaceport in the Sinai and the Lan ding Place in Baalbek by a descendant of Ham could have occurr ed only if that area had been usurped by a descendant of the H amitic dei- ties, by a younger god of Egypt. And that, as we have shown, was indeed the result o f the First Pyramid War. Seth's trespass into Canaan meant that all the spac e-related sites—Giza, the Sinai peninsula, Jerusalem—came und er the con- trol of the Enki gods. It was a development in whic h the Enlilites could not acquiesce. And so. soon thereafter—300 ye ars later, we believe—they deliberately launched a war to dislodg e the illegal occupiers from the vital space facilities. This Sec ond Pyramid War is described in several texts, some found in the or iginal Sumerian, others in Akkadian and Assyrian renderings. Scholar s refer to these texts as the \"Myths of Kur\"—'\"myths\" of the Mountai n Lands; they are. in fact, poetically rendered chronicles o f the war to con- trol the space-related peaks—Mount Moriah; the Hars ag (Mount St. Katherine) in the Sinai; and the artificial mou nt, the Ekur (the Great Pyramid) in Egypt. It is clear from the texts that the E n l i l i t e forces were led and commanded by Ninurta, \"Enlil's foremost warrior,\" a nd that the first encounters were in the Sinai peninsula. T he Hamitic gods were beaten there; but they retreated to conti nue the war from the mountain lands of Africa. Ninurta rose to the chal- lenge, and in the second phase of the war carried t he battle to the strongholds of his foes; that phase entailed vi cious and ferocious battles. Then, in its final phase, the wa r was fought at the Great Pyramid, the last and impregnable strongh old of Ninurta's opponents; there the Hamitic gods were be sieged un- til they ran out of food and water. This war, which we call the Second Pyramid War, was com- memorated extensively in Sumerian records—both writ ten chroni- cles and pictorial depictions. Hymns to Ninurta contain numerous references to his feats and heroic deeds in this war; a great part of the psalm \"Like Anu Art Thou Made\" is devoted to a record of the struggle a nd the final victory. But the principal and most direct chronicl e of the war is the epic text Lugal-e Ud Melam-bi, best collated and ed ited by Samuel"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"The Pyramid Wars 159 Geller in Altorientalische Texte und Untersuchungen . Like all Mesopotamian texts, it is so titled after its openi ng line: King, the glory of thy day is lordly; Ninurta, Foremost, possessor of the Divine Powers, who into the throes of the Mountainlands stepped fo rth. Like a flood which cannot be stopped, the Enemyland as with a girdle you tightly bound. Foremost one, who in battle vehemently enters; Hero, who in his hand the Divine Brilliant Weapon c arries; Lord: the Mountainland you subdued as your creature . Ninurta, royal son, whose father to him had given m ight; Hero: in fear of thee, the city has surrendered . . . O mighty one— the Great Serpent, the heroic god, you tore away from all the mountains. Thus extolling Ninurta, his feats, and his Brillian t Weapon, the poem also describes the location of the conflic t (\"the Mountainlands\") and his principal enemy: \"The Great Ser- pent,\" leader of the Egyptian deities. The Sumerian poem identifies this adversary several times as Azag and once refers to him as Ashar, both well-known epithets for Mardu k, thereby establishing the two principal sons of Enlil and En ki—Ninurta and Marduk—as the leaders of the opposing camps in the Sec- ond Pyramid War. The second tablet (one of thirteen on which the lon g poem was inscribed) describes the first battle. Ninurta's up per hand is as- cribed to both his godly weapons and a new airship that he built for himself after his original one had been destroyed i n an accident. It was called IM.DU.GUD, usually translated \"Divine St orm Bird\" but which literally means \"That Which Like Heroic S torm Runs\"; we know from various texts that its wingspan was ab out seventy- five feet. Archaic drawings depicted it as a mechanically cons tructed \"bird,\" with two wing surfaces supported by cross b eams (Fig. 47a); an undercarriage reveals a series of round op enings, perhaps air intakes for jetlike engines. This aircraft, fro m millennia ago. bears a remarkable resemblance not only to the earl y biplanes of the modem air age, but also an incredible likeness to the sketch made in 1497 by Leonardo da Vinci, depicting his co ncept of a man-powered flying machine (Fig. 47b)."},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":" The Imdugud was the inspiration for Ninurta's emble m—a he- roic lion-headed bird resting on two lions (Fig. 48 ) or sometimes on two bulls.

He soared so high that his companions lost sight of him. Then, the texts relate, \"in his Winged Bird, agains t the walled abode\" he swooped down. \"As his Bird neared the gro und, the summit [of the enemy's stronghold] he smashed.\" Chased out of his strongholds, the Enemy began to r etreat.

The q uestion was clearly also addressed to Ishtar, for she is me ntioned by name: \"In the clash of weapons, in the feats of her oship, Ishtar her arm did not hold back.\" As the two gods saw her , they shouted encouragingly to her: \"Advance hither witho ut stop- ping! Put your foot down firmly on the Earth!

The partial verses suggest that after th e intensified attack with Ishtar's assistance, there arose a great cry a nd lamentation in the Enemyland. \"Fear of Ninurta's Brilliance encomp assed the land,\" and its residents had to use substitutes ins tead of wheat and barley \"to grind and mill as flour.\" Under this onslaught the Enemy forces kept retreati ng south.

They scorched the earth and made the rivers run red with the blood of the innocent bystanders—the men, women, and children of the Abzu. The verses describing this aspect of the war are da maged on the tablets of the main text; its details are, however, available from various other fragmented tablets that deal with the \"overwhelming of the land\" by Ninurta, \"a feat whereby he earned the title \"Van- quisher of Meslam.\" In these battles the attackers resorted to chemical warfare. We read that Ninurta rained on th e city poison- bearing missiles, which \"he catapulted into it; the poison, by it- self, destroyed the city.\" Those who survived the attack on the city escaped t o the sur- rounding mountains. But Ninurta \"with the Weapon Th at Smites threw fire upon the mountains; the godly Weapon of the Gods, whose Tooth is bitter, smote down the people.\" Here , too, some kind of chemical warfare is indicated: The Weapon Which Tears Apart robbed the senses: The Tooth skinned them off.

Azag called on his followers to show no resistance: \"The arisen Enemy to his wife and child called; against the lord Ninurta he raise d not his ami. The weapons of Kur with soil were covered\" (i.e.. hidde n away); \"Azag them did not raise.\" Ninurta took the lack of resistance as a sign of vi ctory. A text reported by F. Hrozny (\"Mythen von dem Gotte Ninib\" ) relates how. after Ninurta killed the opponents occupying t he land of the Harsag (Sinai) and went on \"like a Bird\" to attack the gods who \"behind their walls retreated\" in Kur, he defeated them in the mountains. He then burst out in a song of victory: My fearsome Brilliance like Anu's is mighty; Against it, who can rise?

The capital city was indeed de- stroyed, but not so the leaders of the Enemy. Sober ly, the text Lugal-e observed: \"The scorpion of Kur Ninurta did not annihi- late.\" Instead, the Enemy gods retreated into the G reat Pryamid, where \"the Wise Craftsman\"—Enki? Thoth?—raised up a protec- tive wall \"which the Brilliance could not match.\" a shield through which the death rays could not penetrate. Our knowledge of this final and most dramatic phase of the Sec- ond Pyramid War is augmented by texts from \"the oth er side.\" Just as Ninurta's followers composed hymns to him, so did the fol- lowers of Nergal. Some of the latter, which have al so been discov- ered by archaeologists, were put together in Gebete und Hymnen an Nergal by J. Bollenrucher. Recalling the heroic feats of Nergal in this war, t he texts relate how, as the other gods found themselves hemmed in w ithin the Giza complex, Nergal—\"Lofty Dragon Beloved of Ekur\" —\"at night stole out\" and, carrying awesome weapons and accompanied by his lieutenants, broke through the encirclement to reach the Great Pyramid (the Ekur). Reaching it at night, he entered through \"the locked doors which by themselves can open.\" A roar of wel- come greeted him as he entered: Divine Nergal, Lord who by night stole out, had come to the battle! He cracks his whip, his weapons clank . . . He who is welcome, his might is immense: Like a dream at the doorstep he appeared. Divine Nergal, the One Who Is Welcome: Fight the enemy of Ekur, lay hold on the Wild One from Nippur! But the high hopes of the besieged gods were soon d ashed. We learn more of the last phases of this Pyramid War f rom yet another text, first pieced together by George A. Barton (Mi scellaneous Babylonian Texts) from fragments of an inscribed cl ay cylinder found in the ruins of Enlil's temple in Nippur. As Nergal joined the defenders of the Great Pyramid (\"the For- midable House Which Is Raised Up Like a Heap\"), he strength- ened its defenses through the various ray-emitting crystals (mineral \"stones\") positioned within the pyramid:"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"164 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The Water-Stone, the Apex-Stone, the . . . -Stone, the .. . ... the lord Nergal increased its strength. The door for protection he . . . To heaven its Eye he raised, Dug deep that which gives life . . . ... in the House he fed them food. With the pyramid's defenses thus enhanced, Ninurta resorted to another tactic. He called upon Utu/Shamash to cut o ff the pyra- mid's water supply by tampering with the \"watery st ream\" that ran near its foundations. The text here is too muti lated to enable a reading of the details; but the tactic apparently a chieved its pur- pose. Huddled in their last stronghold, cut off from food and water, the besieged gods did their best to ward off their attackers. Until then, in spite of the ferocity of the battles, no m ajor god had fallen a casualty to the fighting. But now one of the youn ger gods— Horus, we believe—trying to sneak out of the Great Pyramid disguised as a ram, was struck by Ninurta's Brillia nt Weapon and lost the sight of his eyes. An Olden God then cried out to Ninhar- sag—reputed for her medical wonders—to save the you ng god's life: At that time the Killing Brightness came; The House's platform withstood the lord. Unto Ninharsag there was an outcry: \". . .the weapon ... my offspring with death is accursed. . . . \" Other Sumerian texts call t h i s young god \"offspring who did not know his father,\" an epithet befitting Horus, w ho was born after his father's death. In Egyptian lore the Lege nd of the Ram reports the injuries to the eyes of Horus when a go d \"blew fire\" at him. It was then, responding to the \"outcry.\" that Ninha rsag decided to intervene to stop the fighting. The ninth tablet of the Lugal-e text begins with th e statement of Ninharsag, her address to the Enlilite commander, h er own son Ninurta, \"the son of Enlil . . . the Legitimate Heir whom the"},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"The Pyramid Wars 165 sister-wife had brought forth.\" In telltale verses she announced her decision to cross the battle lines and bring an end to the hostilities: To the House Where Cord-Measuring begins. Where Asar his eyes to Anu raised, I shall go. The cord I will cut off, for the sake of the warring gods. Her destination was the \"House Where Cord-Measuring be- gins,\" the Great Pyramid! Ninurta was at first astounded by her decision to \" enter alone the Enemyland\"; but since her mind was made up, he provided her with \"clothes which should make her unafraid\" (of t he radiation left by the beams?). As she neared the pyramid, she addressed Enki: \"She shouts to him . . . she beseeches him.\" The ex- changes are lost by the breaks in the tablet; but E nki agreed to sur- render the pyramid to her: The House that is like a heap, that which I have as a pile raised up— its mistress you may be. There was, however, a condition: The surrender was subject to a final resolution of the conflict until \"the destiny -determining time\" shall come. Promising to relay Enki's conditi ons, Ninharsag went to address Enlil. The events that followed are recorded in part in th e Lugal-e epic and in other fragmentary texts. But they are most d ramatically de- scribed in a text titled I Sing the Song of the Mot her of the Gods. Surviving in great length because it was copied and recopied throughout the ancient Near East, the text was firs t reported by P. Dhorme in his study La Souveraine des Dieux. It is a poetic text in praise of Ninmah (the \"Great Lady\") and her role as Mammi (\"Mother of the Gods\") on both sides of the battle lines. Opening with a call upon \"the comrades in arms and the com- batants\" to listen, the poem briefly describes the warfare and its participants, as well as its nearly global extent. On the one side were \"the firstborn of Ninmah\" (Ninurta) and Adad, soon joined by Sin and later on by Inanna/Ishtar. On the opposi ng side are listed Nergal, a god referred to as \"Mighty, Lofty One\"— Ra/Marduk—and the \"God of the two Great Houses\" (th e two"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"166 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN great pyramids of Giza) who had tried to escape cam ouflaged in a ram's skin: Horus. Asserting that she was acting with the approval of Anu, Ninhar- sag took the surrender offer of Enki to Enlil. She met him in the presence of Adad (while Ninurta remained at the bat tlefield). \"O hear my prayers!\" she begged the two gods as she ex plained her ideas. Adad was at first adamant: Presenting himself there, to the Mother, Adad thus said: \"We are expecting victory. The enemy forces are beaten. The trembling of the land he could not withstand.\" If she wants to bring about a cessation of hostilit ies, Adad said, let her call discussions on the basis that the Enli lites are about to win: \"Get up and go—talk to the enemy. Let him attend the discussions so that the attack be withdrawn.\" Enlil, in less forceful language, supported the sug gestion: Enlil opened his mouth; In the assembly of the gods he said: \"Whereas Anu at the mountain the gods assembled, warfare to discourage, peace to bring, and has dispatched the Mother of the Gods to entreat with me— Let the Mother of the Gods be an emissary.\" Turning to his sister, he said in a conciliatory ve in: \"Go, appease my brother! Raise unto him a hand for Life; From his barred doorway, let him come out!\" Doing as suggested, Ninharsag \"his brother went to fetch, put her prayers before the god.\" She informed him that his safety, and that of his sons, was assured: \"by the stars she ga ve a sign.\""},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"The Pyramid Wars 167 As Enki hesitated she said to h i m tenderly: \"Come, let me lead you out.\" And as he did, he gave her his hand. . . .

Conceived by Enki/Ptah. planned by Ra/Mar- duk, built by Geb, equipped by Thoth, defended by N ergal, what mysteries of space guidance, what secrets of impreg nable defense did it hold? In the smooth and seemingly solid north face of the pyramid, a swivel stone swung open to reveal the entranceway, protected by the massive diagonal stone blocks, just as the text lauding Ninhar- sag had described. A straight Descending Passage le d to the lower service chambers where Ninurta could see a shaft du g by the de- fenders in search for subterranean water. But his i nterest focused on the upper passages and chambers; there, the magi cal \"stones\" were arrayed—minerals and crystals, some earthly, s ome heav- enly, some the likes of which he had never seen. Fr om them there were emitted the beamed pulsations for the guidance of the astro- nauts and the radiations for the defense of the str ucture. Escorted by the Chief Mineralmaster, Ninurta inspec ted the ar- ray of \"stones\" and instruments. As he stopped by e ach one of them, he determined its destiny—to be smashed up an d destroyed, to be taken away for display, or to be installed as instruments else- where. We know of these \"destinies,\" and of the ord er in which Ninurta had stopped by the stones, from the text in scribed on tab- lets 10-13 of the epic poem Lugal-e.

Going up the Ascending Passage. Ninurta reached its junction with the imposing Grand Gallery and a Horizontal Pa ssage. Ninurta followed the Horizontal Passage first, reac hing a large chamber with a corbeled roof. Called the '\"vulva\" i n the Ninharsag poem, this chamber's axis lay exactly on the east-w est center line of the pyramid. Its emission (\"an outpouring which is like a lion whom no one dares attack\") came from a stone fitted into a niche that was hollowed out in the east wall (Fig. 49). I t was the SHAM (\"Destiny\") Stone. Emitting a red radiance which Ni nurta \"saw in the darkness,\" it was the pulsating heart of the pyramid. But it was anathema to Ninurta, for during the battle, whe n he was aloft, this stone's \"strong power\" was used \"to grab to ki ll me, with a tracking which kills to seize me.\" He ordered it \"p ulled out . . . be taken apart . . . and to obliteration be destroy ed.\" "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"The Pyramid Wars 169 Returning to the junction of the passages, Ninurta looked around him in the Grand Gallery (Fig. 45). As ingenious an d complex as the whole pyramid was. this gallery was breathtakin g and a most unusual sight. Compared to the low and narrow passa ges, it rose high (some twenty-eight feet) in seven overlapping stages, its walls closing in ever more at each stage. The ceiling was also built in slanting sections, each one angled into the massive walls so as not to exert any pressure on the segment below it. Wher eas in the nar- row passages only \"a dim green light glowed.\" the G allery glit- tered in multicolored lights—\"its vault is like a r ainbow, the darkness ends there.\" The many-hued glows were emit ted by twenty-seven pairs of diverse crystal stones that w ere evenly spaced along the whole length of each side of the G allery (Fig. 50a). These glowing stones were placed in cavities that were pre- cisely cut into the ramps that ran the length of th e Gallery on both sides of its floor. Firmly held in place by an elab orate niche in the wall (Fig. 50b), each crystal stone emitted a diffe rent radiance, giving the place its rainbow effect. For the moment Ninurta passed by them on his way up; his priority was the uppermo st Grand Chamber and its pulsating stone. Atop the Grand Gallery, Ninurta reached a great ste p which led through a low passage to an Antechamber of unique d esign (Fig. 46). There three portcullises—\"the bolt, the bar an d the lock\" of the Sumerian poem—elaborately fitted into grooves i n the walls and floor, hermetically sealed off the uppermost Gr eat Chamber: \"to foe it is not opened; only to Them Who Live, fo r them it is opened.\" But now, by pulling some cords, the portcu llises were raised, and Ninurta passed through. He was now in the pyramid's most restricted (\"sacre d\") cham- ber, from which the guiding \"Net\" (radar?) was \"'sp read out\" to \"survey Heaven and Earth.\" The delicate mechanism w as housed in a hollowed-out stone chest; placed precisely on the north-south axis of the pyramid, it responded to vibrations wit h bell-like reso- nance. The heart of the guidance unit was the GUG ( \"Direction Determining\") Stone; its emissions, amplified by fi ve hollow compartments constructed above the chamber, were be amed out and up through two sloping channels leading to the north and south faces of the pyramid. Ninurta ordered this stone de stroyed: \"Then, by the fate-determining Ninurta, on that day was th e Gug stone from its hollow taken out and smashed.\" To make sure no one would ever attempt to restore t he \"Direc- tion Determining\" functions of the pyramid.

As he w alked down Ninurta stopped by each one of them to declare its fate. Were it not for breaks in the clay tablets on which the tex t was written, we would have had the names of all twenty-seven of them; as it is. only twenty-two names are legible. Several of t hem Ninurta ordered to be crushed or pulverized; others, which could be used in the new Mission Control Center, were ordere d given to Shamash; and the rest were carried off to Mesopotam ia, to be displayed in Ninurta's temple, in Nippur, and elsew here as constant evidence of the great victory of the Enlil ites over the Enki-gods. All this, Ninurta announced, he was doing not only for his sake but for future generations, too: \"Let the fear of t hee\"—the Great Pyramid—\"be removed from my descendants; let their peace be ordained.\" Finally there was the Apex Stone of the Pyramid, th e UL (\"High As The Sky\") Stone: \"Let the mother's offspring see it no more.\" he ordered. And, as the stone was sent crashing dow n, \"let every- one distance himself,\" he shouted. The \"Stones,\" wh ich were \"anathema\" to Ninurta, were no more.

They ended as great wars have ended in historic tim es: with a peace conference; with the gathering of the combata nts, as at the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), which redrew the ma p of Europe after the Napoleonic Wars, or the Paris Peac e Conference that ended World War I (1914-1918) with the Treaty of Versailles. The first inkling that the warring Anunnaki had con vened in a similar manner some ten thousand years ago comes fr om the text which George A. Barton found inscribed on a broken clay cylinder. It was an Akkadian version of a much earlier Sumeri an text; and Barton concluded that the clay cylinder was deposit ed by the ruler Naram-Sin circa 2300 B.C. when this Akkadian king r epaired the platform of Enlil's temple in Nippur. Comparing the Mesopota- mian text with texts inscribed at about the same ti me by Egyptian Pharaohs, Barton noted that the Egyptian texts \"cen tered around the king and are interested in his fortunes as he e nters among the gods\"; the Mesopotamian text, on the other hand, \"c oncerned it- self with the community of the gods\"; its subject w as not the aspi- rations of the king but the affairs of the gods the mselves. In spite of damage to the text, especially at the b eginning, it is clear that the leading gods gathered in the afterma th of a great and bitter war. We learn that they convened at the Hars ag, Ninharsag's mountain abode in the Sinai, and that she played th e role of peace- maker. Yet she is not treated by the text's author as a really neu- tral personage: he repeatedly refers to her by the epithet Tsir (\"Snake\"), which stamped her as an Egyptian/Enkite goddess and conveyed a derogatory connotation. The text's opening verses, as we have already state d, briefly de- scribed the last phases of the war and the conditio ns within the be- sieged pyramid that led to the defenders' \"outcry,\" leading to Ninharsag's decision to intervene. We learn from the continuing ancient chronicle that Ninharsag first went with her idea of stopping the fighting a nd convening a peace conference to Enlil's camp. 173"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"174 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The Enlilites' first reaction to Ninharsag's bold i nitiative was to ac- cuse her of giving aid and comfort to the \"demons.\" Ninharsag denied the accusation: \"My House is pure.\" she answered. B ut a god whose identity is unclear challenged her sarcastically: \" Is the House which is loftier and brightest of all\"—the Great Pyramid—als o \"pure\"? \"Of that I cannot speak.\" Ninharsag answered; \"its brilliance Gibil is soldiering.\" After the first accusations and explanations wore o ff some of the bitterness, a symbolic ceremony of forgiveness was performed. It involved two jars holding waters of the Tigris and Euphrates riv- ers, a ceremony of symbolic baptism making Ninharsa g welcome again in Mesopotamia. Enlil touched her with his \"b right scep- ter.\" and the \"power of her was not overthrown.\" The objections of Adad to a peace conference rather than uncon- ditional surrender were already reported by us in t he previous chap- ter. But then Enlil agreed, saying to her: \"Go, app ease my brother.\" We have already read in another text how Ninharsag crossed the battle lines to arrange the cease-fire. Having brought out Enki and his sons, Ninharsag took them to her a bode in the Harsag. The Enlilite gods were already there, waiti ng. Announcing that she was acting in behalf of \"the gr eat lord Anu . . . Anu the Arbiter,\" Ninharsag performed a symbo lic cere- mony of her own. She lighted seven fires, one each for the gathered gods: Enki and his two sons: Enlil and his three so ns (Ninurta, Adad. and Sin). She uttered an incantation as she l it each fire: \"A fiery offering to Enlil of Nippur. . . to Ninurta . . . to Adad. . . to Enki coming from the Abzu ... to Nergal coming f rom Meslam.\" By nightfall the place was ablaze: \"as sun light was the great light set off by the goddess.\" Ninharsag then appealed to the wisdom of the gods a nd extolled the virtues of peace: \"Mighty are the fruits of the wise god; the great divine river to his vegetation shall come . . . its overflowing will make [the land) like a garden of god.\" The abundanc e of plants and animals, of wheat and other grains, of vines and fr uits, and the bene- fits of a \"triple-sprouting mankind\" planting, buil ding, and serving the gods—all to follow peace—were then outlined by her. After Ninharsag had finished her oracle of peace, E nlil was the first one to speak. \"Removed is the affliction from the face of the Earth,\" Enlil declared to Enki: \"the Great Weapon i s lifted up.\" He agreed to let Enki regain his abode in Sumer: \"T he E.DIN shall be a place for thy Holy House,\" with enough land ar ound to bear fruit for the temple and to have seeded fields."},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"Peace on Earth 175 On hearing this Ninurta objected. \"Let it not come! \" the \"prince of Enlil\" shouted. Again Ninharsag took the floor. She reminded Ninurt a how he had toiled, \"day and night with might,\" to enable c ultivation and cattle herding in the land, how he \"raised the foun dations, filled [the earth], raised [the dykes].\" Then the afflicti on of war de- stroyed it all, \"all, in its entirety.\" \"Lord of li fe, god of fruit,\" she appealed to him, \"let the good beer pour in dou ble measure! Make abundant the wool!\"—agree to the peace terms! Overcome by her plea, Ninurta relented: \"O my mothe r, brilliant one! Proceed; the flour I will not withhold ... in the kingdom the garden will be restored . . . To end affliction, I [too] earnestly pray.\" Now the peace negotiations could proceed; and we pi ck up the tale of the unprecedented encounter between the two warring gods from the text I Sing the Song of the Mother of the Gods. First to address the assembled Anunnaki was Enki: Enki addressed to Enlil words of lauding: \"O one who is foremost among the brothers. Bull of Heaven, who the fate of Mankind holds: In my lands, desolation is widespread; All the dwellings are filled with sorrow by your attacks.\" The first item on the agenda was thus the cessation of hostilities- peace on Earth—and Enlil readily agreed, on conditi on that the territo- rial disputes be brought to an end and the lands ri ghtfully belonging to the Enlilites and the people of the line of Shem be vacated by the Enkites. Enki agreed to cede forever these territor ies: \"I will grant thee the ruler's position in the gods' Restricted Zone; The Radiant Place, in thy hand I will entrust!\" In so ceding the Restricted Zone (the Sinai peninsu la with its Spaceport) and the Radiant Place (the site of Missi on Control Cen- ter, the future Jerusalem) Enki had a firm conditio n. In return for granting Enlil and his offspring eternal rights to those lands and vi- tal sites, the sovereignty of Enki and his descenda nts over the Giza complex had to be recognized for all time. Enlil agreed but not without a condition: The sons of Enki who had brought about the war and used the Great Pyrami d for combat"},{"pageNumber":179,"pageContent":"176 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN purposes should be barred from ruling over Giza, or over the whole of Lower Egypt, for that matter. Pondering the condition over, Enki agreed. He then and there announced his decision. The lord of Giza and Lower Egypt, he said, will be a young son of his, espoused to one o f the female dei- ties born when Enki had made love to Ninharsag: \"Fo r the formi- dable House Which Is Raised Like a Heap, he appoint ed the prince whose brilliant wife from the cohabitation w ith Tsir [Nin- harsag] was brought forth. The strong prince who is like a full- grown ibex—him he appointed, and commanded him to g uard the Place of Life.\" He then granted the young god the e xalted title NIN.GISH.ZI.DA (\"Lord of the Artifact of Life\"). Who was Ningishzidda? Scholars find the information concerning him meager and confusing. He is mentioned in Mesopo tamian texts in association with Enki, Dumuzi, and Ninhars ag; in the Great God List he is included among the gods of Afr ica following Nergal and Ereshkigal. The Sumerians depicted him w ith Enki's emblem of the entwined serpents and with the Egypti an Ankh sign (Fig. 52 a,b). Yet they viewed Ningishzidda favorab ly; Ninurta be- friended him and invited him to Sumer.

As s uch, he was acceptable to both sides as guardian of the secrets of the pyramids. A hymn which Ake W. Sjoberg and E. Bergmann ('\"The Collec- tion of the Sumerian Temple Hymns\") believe was com posed by the daughter of Sargon of Akkad in the third millennium B.C. exalted the pyramid-house of Ningishzidda and confirmed its Egy ptian location: Enduring place, light-hued mountain which in an artful fashion was founded. Its dark hidden chamber is an awe-inspiring place; in a Field of Supervision it lies. Awesome, its ways no one can fathom. In the Land of the Shield your pedestal is closely knit as a fine-mesh net . . . At night you face the heavens, your ancient measurements are surpassing. Your interior knows the place where Utu rises, the measure of its width is far reaching. Your prince is the prince whose pure hand is outstr etched, whose luxuriant and abundant hair flows down on his back— the lord Ningishzida. The concluding verses of the hymn twice restate the location of this unique structure: the \"Land of the Shield.\" It is a term equivalent to the Akkadian meaning of the Mesopotamian name for E gypt: the Land Magan, \"The Land of the Shield.\" And another h ymn copied and translated by Sjoberg (tablet UET 6/1) called N ingishzidda \"the falcon among the gods,\" a designation commonly appl ied in Egyptian texts to Egyptian gods and found in Sumerian texts only one other time, applied to Ninurta, conqueror of the pyramids . What did the Egyptians call this son of Enki/Ptah? Their \"god of the cord who measures the Earth\" was Thoth; he was (as the Tales of the Magicians related) the one appointed to be guar dian of the secrets of the Giza pyramids. It was Thoth, according to Ma netho, who re- placed Horus on the throne of Egypt; it happened ci rca 8670 B.C. —just at the time when the Second Pyramid War had e nded. Having thus settled the disputes between them, the great Anun- naki turned to the affairs of mankind. As one reads the ancient words it becomes clear tha t this peace conference dealt not only with the cessation of hos tilities and the drawing of binding territorial lines; it also laid the plans for the"},{"pageNumber":181,"pageContent":"178 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN manner in which the lands would be settled by manki nd! We read that Enki \"before the feet of the adversary [Enlil] laid the cities that were allotted him\"; Enlil, in turn, \"before th e feet of his ad- versary [Enki] the land Sumer he laid out.\" We can envision the two brothers facing each other, Enki—as always—the more concerned of the two about mankind and its fate. Having dealt with the disputes among the Anunnaki t hemselves, he now turns to the future of mankind. In the aftermat h of the Deluge, it was given farming and domesticated animals; now it was the chance to look and plan ahead, and he seized the op portunity. The ancient text may well describe a spontaneous act; E nki drawing on the ground, \"before the feet of Enlil,\" a plan for the establishment of human settlement centers in his lands; agreeing, Enlil responds by drawing \"before the feet of Enki\" the plan for t he restoration of the pre-Diluvial cities of southern Mesopotamia (Su mer). If the olden pre-Diluvial cities of Mesopotamia wer e to be re- stored, Enki had a condition: He and his sons were to be allowed to come freely to Mesopotamia; and he, Enki, was to be given back the site of Eridu, the hallowed place of his first Earth Station. Ac- cepting the condition, Enlil said: \"In my land, let your abode be- come everlasting; from the day that you shall come into my presence, the laden table shall exhale delicious sm elis for thee.\" Enlil expressed the hope that in return for this ho spitality, Enki would help bring prosperity also to Mesopotamia: \"P our abun- dance on the Land, each year increase its fortunes. \" And with all these matters settled, Enki and his so ns departed for their African domains. After Enki and his sons had departed, Enlil and his sons contem- plated the future of their territories, born old an d new. The first chroni- cle, the one reported by Barton, relates that in or der to reaffirm the status of Ninurta as second to Enlil and superior o ver his brothers, En- lil put him in charge of the Olden Land. The territ ories of Adad in the northwest were extended by a thin \"finger\" (Lebanon ) to include the Landing Place at Baalbek. The territory that was in contention—we can describe it as Greater Canaan, from the border of Egypt in the south to the border of Adad in the north, with mode m Syria includ- ed—was put under the aegis of Nannar and his offspr ing. To that effect \"a decree was established,\" sealed, and cele brated with a meal offering shared by all me Enlilite gods. A more dramatic version of these final proceedings is found in the I Sing the Song of the Mother of the Gods text. We learn"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"Peace on Earth 179 that at that crucial moment, the rivalry between Ni nurta—the legal heir, being the son of Enlil by his half-sister—and Nannar, the firstborn of Enlil by his official spouse Ninlil. h ad broken out in full force. Enlil. we are told, contemplated favora bly the attributes of Nannar: '\"A firstborn . . . of beautiful counten ance, perfect of limbs, wise without compare.\" Enlil \"him loved\" bec ause he gave him the two all-important grandchildren, the twins Utu/Shamash and Inanna/Ishtar; he called Nannar SU.EN—\"Multiplying Lord\"—an endearing epithet from which there stemmed the Akka dian/Semitic name for Nannar: Sin. But as much as Enlil had favo red Nannar, the fact was that it was Ninurta who was the legal heir ; he was \"Enlil's foremost warrior,\" and he led the Enlilites to vict ory. As Enlil wavered between Sin and Ninurta. Sin enlis ted the help of his wife Ningal, who appealed to Enlil as well a s to his spouse Ninlil, the mother of Sin: To the place of decision he called Ningal, Suen invited her to approach. A favorable decision she asked of the father . . . Enlil weighed [her words] . . . Before the mother she [pleaded] . . . \"Remember the childhood,\" she said [to Ninlil] . . .

Could one ever imagine, in those far-reaching decis ions that were to affect the fate of gods and men for millenn ia to come, that the female spouses had played such a decisive role? We read of Ningal coming to the aid of her husband; we see Nin lil being en- listed in persuading the wavering Enlil. But then t here entered the scene yet another great goddess—and by her words ac hieved an unintended decision. . . . As Enlil was urged by Ninlil to \"follow your heart\" rather than his mind, to prefer the firstborn over the leg al heir. \"Ninurta opened his mouth and said ...\" His words o f oppo- sition are lost by a damage to the verses; but, as the tale is con- tinued, we learn that Ninharsag threw in her weight behind her son Ninurta: She cried out and lamented to her brother; Like a pregnant woman she was agitated, [saying:] \"Inside the Ekur I call to my brother,"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"180 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN my brother who an infant made me carry; upon my brother I call!\" But Ninharsag's appeal was ill-worded. She meant to appeal as Enlil's sister in behalf of the child (Ninurta) she bore him; but her call sounded like an appeal to Enki. Enraged, Enlil shouted at her: \"Who is this brother of yours that you call? This b rother, who an infant made you carry?\" And he made a decision favo ring the line of Sin. Ever since then, and to this very day, the Land of the Spaceport has been known as Sin's land—the Sinai pe ninsula. As his final act Enlil appointed Sin's son as the c ommander of the Mission Control Center: He called in Shamash the grandchild of Ninlil. He took him [by the hand]; In Shulim he placed him. Jerusalem— Ur-Shulim, the \"City of Shulim\"—was give n to Shamash to command. Its name, SHU.LIM, meant \"The S upreme Place of the Four Regions,\" and the Sumerian emblem of the \"Four Regions\" (Fig. 53a) applied to it, possibly t he forerunner of the Jewish emblem called the Star of David (Fig. 53 b). Replacing the pre-Diluvial Nippur as the post-Diluv ial Mission Control Center, Jerusalem also acquired Nippur's fo rmer title of being the Navel of the Earth—the central point in t he Divine Grid that made the comings and goings between Earth and Nibiru possi- Fig. 53 "},{"pageNumber":184,"pageContent":"Peace on Earth 181 ble.

The two anchors of the Landing Corridor also had to be equidis- "},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"182 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN tant from Mission Control Center (JM); but here the re was a need to make a change in the original plans, for th e previous artifi- cially constructed \"House Which Is Like a Mountain\" —the Great Pyramid—was stripped of its crystals and equipment and was ren- dered useless by Ninurta. The solution was to erect , still precisely on the northwestern corridor line but north of Giza , a new Beacon City. The Egyptians called it the City of Annu; its hieroglyphic symbol depicted it as a high sloping tower (Fig. 55 ) with an even taller superstructure pointing skyward as an arrow. The Greeks, many millennia later, called the place Heliopolis ( \"City of He- lios,\" the Sun god)—the same name they applied to B aalbek. In both instances it was a translation of earlier name s relating the two places to Shamash, \"Who Is Bright as the Sun\"; Baal bek, in fact, was called in the Bible Beth-Shemesh, House of Sham ash, or Heli- opolis in Greek. Fig. 55 The shifting of the beacon site at the northwestern anchor of the Landing Corridor from Giza (GZ) to Heliopolis (HL) also required a shift in the southeastern anchor, to keep the two anchors equidis- tant from Mount Moriah. A mount only slightly lower than Mount St. Katherine, but still precisely on the Corridor line, was found and adapted to the task. It is called Mount Vmm-Shu mar (Mount of Sumer's Mother—US on our map). Sumerian geographica l lists called the two adjoining mountains in Tilmun KA HAR SAG (\"The Gateway Peak\") and HARSAG ZALA.ZALAG (\"Peak Which Emits the Brilliance\"). The construction, manning, and operation of the aer ospace facil- ities in Tilmun and Canaan required new supply rout es and protec- tive outposts.

It also led. we believe, to the establishment of the world's oldest town: Jeric ho, which was dedicated to Sin (Yeriho in Hebrew) and his celesti al symbol, the Moon. The age of Jericho has been an enigma that has cont inuously baf- fled the scholars. They broadly divide man's advanc ement (which spread from the Near East) into the Mesolithic (\"Mi ddle Stone\") Age, which saw the introduction of agriculture and animal domes- tication circa 11,000 B.C.; a Neolithic (\"New Stone \") Age 3,600 years later, bringing with it villages and pottery: and then, finally. Sumer's urban civilization, again 3,600 years later . Yet here was Jericho: an urban site occupied and built by unknow ns sometime circa 8500 B.C.. when man had not yet learned to le ad even a vil- lage life. . . . The puzzles posed by Jericho pertain not only to it s age, but also to what the archaeologists have found there: houses , built on stone foundations, had doors equipped with wooden jambs: the walls were carefully plastered and painted red, pink, and other colors— sometimes even covered with murals. Neat hearths an d basins were sunk in whitewashed plaster floors, floors tha t were often decorated with patterns. Below the floors the dead were sometimes buried—buried but not forgotten: at least ten skull s were found which were filled with plaster to recreate the feat ures of the de- ceased (Fig. 56). The features they reveal were by all opinions more advanced and finer than those of the usual Med iterranean dwellers of the time. All this was protected by a m assive wall that surrounded the town (millennia before Joshua!). It was raised in the middle of a ditch nearly thirty feet wide and s even feet deep, dug out of the rock \"without the help of picks and hoes\" (James Mellaart. Earliest Civilizations of the Near East). It was \"an explosive development ... a spectacular development whose causes.\" Mellaart says, \"are still unknown to us.\" The enigma of prehistoric Jericho is compounded by the evi- dence of its round grain silos, one of which was fo und still partly standing. In a hot depression near the Dead Sea. 82 5 feet below sea level, in an inhospitable place unsuitable for grai n cultivation, there was found evidence of ample supplies and cont inued storage of wheat and barley. Who could have built this adva nced town that early, who had come to live in such a place, and wh om did it serve as a fortified store city? The solution to this enigma lies, in our opinion, i n the chronol- ogy of the \"gods,\" not of men.

From there the trav- eler had the choice of either to continue south dow n the Mediterra- nean coast—the road later called by the Romans Via Maris (\"The Sea Way\")—or to proceed on the east side of the Jor dan, along the equally famous King's Highway. The former was the s hortest route to Egypt; the latter could lead to the Gulf o f Eilat, the Red Sea, Arabia, and Africa, as well as into the Sinai peninsula; it could also lead to the western side of the Jordan v ia several suitable crossing points. It was the route over which the Af rican gold was brought. The most vital of these, the one that led directly to Mission Con- trol Center in Jerusalem, was the crossing point at Jericho. It was there that the Israelites crossed the Jordan into t he Promised Land. It was there, we suggest, that millennia earlier th e Anunnaki estab- lished a town to guard the crossing point and to su pply the travelers with provisions for the continued journey. Until ma n made Jericho his home, it was an outpost of the gods. Would the Anunnaki have built a settlement only on the west side of the Jordan, leaving the more vital eastern side, where the King's Highway ran, unprotected? It stands to reaso n that a settle- ment should have existed on the opposite, eastern s ide of the Jor- dan, too. Though little known outside of archaeolog ical circles, such a place has indeed been found; and what was di scovered there is even more astounding than what had been uncovere d at Jericho. The puzzling place with astounding remains was firs t unearthed in 1929 by an archaeological mission organized by t he Vatican's Pontifical Biblical Institute. The archaeologists, led by Alexis Mallon, were surprised by the high level of civiliz ation found there. Even the oldest level of habitation (circa 7 500 B.C.) was paved with bricks, and though the period of settlem ent stretched from the end of the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, th e archaeolo- gists were amazed to find that the same civilizatio n revealed itself at all levels. The place is named after the mound where it was fou nd—Tell Ghassul; its ancient name is not known. Together wi th several sat- ellite settlements, it clearly controlled the vital crossover point and the road leading to it—a road still followed to thi s day to a crossing point nowadays called the Allenby Bridge (Fig. 57). The strategic location of Tell Ghassul had been noted by the arch aeologists when they began to dig up its remains: \"From atop the mo und, one has an interesting all-around view: the Jordan on the w est as a dark"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"186 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN line; to the northwest, the hillock of ancient Jeri cho; and beyond it, the mountains of Judea, including Beth-El and the M ount of Olives of Jerusalem.

Of the three hillocks that together formed the larg e mound, two appear to have been used as abodes and one as a wor k area. The latter was found to have been subdivided into recta ngularlike seg- ments, within which there were built circular \"pits ,\" frequently in pairs. That they were not hearths for food preparat ion is suggested not only by their pairing and profusion (why would six or eight of them be required in one compartment?), but also by the fact that some of them were cylindrical and went quite deep i nto the ground. Combined with them were enigmatic \"bands of ashes\" (Fig. 58), the remains of some combustible material, which wer e covered with fine sand and then with regular soil, only to form the founda- tion of yet another layer of such \"band of ashes.\" Fig. 58 On the surface, the ground was strewn with pebbles, the remains of rocks broken up by some force that also blackene d them. Among the artifacts found was a small, circular obj ect made of fired clay (Fig. 59), shaped with precision for som e unknown tech- nical purpose. The mystery only deepened by the discoveries in the residential areas.

In one instance a cagelike mesh sho wn over the ob- ject created on the wall a three-dimensional illusi on. In one house every wall appeared to have been painted with some scene; in an- other a recessed divan was so built that it enabled the dweller, while reclining, to view a mural that covered the w hole opposite wall. It depicted a row of people—the first two of whom were seated on thrones—facing toward (or greeting) anoth er person who had apparently stepped out of an object emitting ra ys. The archaeologists who had discovered these murals during the 1931-32 and 1932-33 excavations theorized that the rayed object might have been similar to a most unusual rayed \"st ar\" found painted in another building. It was an eight-pointe d \"star\" within a larger eight-pointed \"star,\" culminating in a burst of eight rays (Fig. 60). The precise design, employing a variety of geometric shapes, was artistically executed in black, red, wh ite, gray, and combinations thereof; a chemical analysis of the pa ints used showed that they were not natural substances but so phisticated compounds of twelve to eighteen minerals. The mural's discoverers assumed that the eight-raye d \"star\" had some \"religious significance,\" pointing out tha t the eight- pointed star, standing for the planet Venus, was th e celestial sym- bol of Ishtar. However, the fact is that no evidenc e of any religious worship whatsoever, no \"cult objects,\" statuettes o f gods, etc., had been found at Tell Ghassul, yet another anomaly of the place. This, we suggest, indicates that it was inhabited n ot by worshipers but by those who were the subject of worshiping: th e \"gods\" of antiquity, the Anunnaki.

It was this, we believe, that th e design's ancient painters, too, had in mind: to indicate their, and the place's, asso- ciation with the four regions of the Earth. That the rayed \"star\" had no sacred significance is further at- tested by the disrespect with which it was surround ed by graffiti.

The Tell Ghassul/Jericho crossing point played impo rtant and miraculous roles in several biblical events, a fact that may have en- hanced the Vatican's interest in the site.

The crossing itself, under the leadership of Joshua , entailed the miraculous backing up of the Jordan's waters, under the influence of the Holy Ark and its contents. It was then, \"whe n Joshua was by Jericho, that he raised his eyes and lo and beho ld, there stood a man opposite him and his drawn sword in his hand; a nd Joshua went unto him and said unto him: \"Art thou with us or with our ene- mies'?' and he said: 'Neither; a captain of the hos t of the Lord am I.'

Then the captain of the troops of Yahweh divulged t o him the Lord's plan for the conquest of Jericho. Do not att empt to storm its walls by force, he said. Instead, carry the Ark of the Covenant around its walls seven times. And on the seventh day the p riests sounded the trumpets, and the people let out a great cry, as th ey were commanded. \"And the walls of Jericho came tumbling down.\" Jacob, too, crossing the Jordan at night on his ret urn to Canaan from Harran, ran into \"a man\" and the two wrestled till dawn: only then did Jacob realize that his opponent was a deity; \"and Ja- cob called the place Peni-El (\"The Face of God') fo r I had seen a god face to face and have survived.\" Indeed, the Old Testament clearly states that there had been in earlier times settlements of the Anunnaki at the vi tal approaches to the Sinai peninsula and Jerusalem. Hebron, the city guarding the route between Jerusalem and the Sinai, \"was called earlier Kiryat Arba (\"Stronghold of Arba\"); a Great Man (\"king\") a mong the Anakim he was\" (Joshua, 14:15). The descendants of the Anakim, we are further told, were still residing in the are a during the Isra- elite conquest of Canaan; and there are numerous ot her biblical ref- erences to abodes of the Anakim on the east side of the Jordan. Who were these Anakim? The term is commonly transla ted \"giants,\" just as the biblical term Nefilim had bee n translated. But we have already shown conclusively that by Nefilim (\"Those Who Had Come Down\") the Old Testament had referred to the \"People of the Rocketships.\" The Anakim, we suggest, were none other than the An unnaki. No one had hitherto paid any particular attention t o the count of 3,650 years which Manetho assigned to the reign of the \"demi-"},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"192 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN gods\" who belonged to the dynasty of Thoth. We, how ever, find the figure highly significant, for it differs but b y 50 years from the 3.600-year orbit of Nibiru. the home planet of the Anunnaki. It was no accident, we have maintained, that mankin d's ad- vancement from the Stone Age to the high civilizati on of Sumer oc- curred in 3,600-year intervals—circa 11,000, 7400, and 3800 B . C . It was as though \"a mysterious hand\" had each time \"picked Man out of his decline and raised him to an even hi gher level of culture, knowledge and civilization.\" we wrote in T he 12th Planet: each instance, we hold, coincided with the recurrence of the time when the Anunnaki could come and go bet ween Earth and Nibiru. These advances spread from the Mesopotamian nucleus through- out the ancient world; and the Egyptian \"Age of the demigods\" (offspring of the cohabitation of gods and humans)— from circa 7100 B . C . to 3450 B.C. per Manetho—unquestionably coincides with the Neolithic period in Egypt. We can assume that at each of these intervals the f ate of man- kind and the gods' relations with it were discussed by the Great An- unnaki, the \"seven who decree.\" We know for sure th at such a de- liberation had taken place prior to the sudden and otherwise inexplicable blooming of the Sumerian civilization, for the Sume- rians have left us records of such discussions! When the reconstruction of Sumer began, first to ha ve been re- built on its soil were the Olden Cities but no long er as exclusive Cities of the Gods; for mankind was now allowed int o these urban centers to tend the surrounding fields, orchards, a nd cattlefolds in behalf of the gods, and to be in the service of the gods in all con- ceivable manners: not only as cooks and bakers, art isans and cloth- iers, but also as priests, musicians, entertainers, and temple prosti- tutes. First to be reestablished was Eridu. Having been En ki's first set- tlement on Earth, it was given to him anew in perpe tuity. His initial shrine there (Fig. 62)—a marvel of architecture in those early days—was in time raised and expanded to a magnifice nt temple- abode, the E.EN.GUR.RA (\"House of the Lord Whose Re turn Is Triumphant\"), adorned with gold, silver, and precio us metals from the Lower World and protected by the \"Bull of Heaven.\" For Enlil and Ninlil Nippur was reestablished; there th ey raised a new Ekur (\"Mountain House\"—Fig. 63), this time equipped not as Mission Control Center but with awesome weapons: \"t he Lifted Eye which scans the land\"; and \"the Lifted Beam,\" w hich pene-"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"Peace on Earth 193 Fig. 62 trates all. Their sacred area also housed Enlil's \" fast-stepping Bird\" whose \"grasp no one could escape.\" A \"Hymn to Eridu\" edited and translated by A. Falke nstein (Sumer, vol. VII) describes how Enki traveled to at tend a gathering of all the great gods; the occasion was a visit by Anu to Earth, for one of those deliberations that determined the fate of gods and men on Earth every 3.600 years. After some celebrating, when \"the gods the intoxicating beverage had drunk, the wine prepared by men,\" it was time for solemn decisions. \"Anu sat on the seat of honor; near him sat Enlil; Ninharsag sat on an arm chair.\" Anu called the meeting to order, \"and to the Anunna ki thus said\": Great gods who had hither come, Annuna-gods, who to the Court of Assembly had come! My son had for himself a House built; The lord Enki Eridu like the mountain on Earth he raised; His House, in a beautiful place he built. To the place, Eridu, no one uninvited can enter . . .

As the di vine couple reached the new town—later to be known as Uruk (the biblical Erech)—the gods accompanied them in a procession to the tem- ple's courtyard. While a sumptuous evening meal was prepared. Anu, seated on a throne, chatted with the male gods ; Antu, accom- panied by the female goddesses, changed her clothes in the tem- ple's section called \"House of the Golden Bed.\" Priests and other temple attendants served \"wine an d good oil\" and slaughtered in sacrifice \"a bull and a ram for Anu, Antu and all the gods.\" But the banquet was delayed until it was dark enough to see the planets: \"Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Mars and the Moon—as soon as they shall appear.\" With this, and after a cere- monial washing of the hands, the first part of the meal was served: \"Bull meat, ram meat, fowl . . . as well as prime b eer and pressed wine.\" A pause was then made for the highlight of the even ing. While one group of priests began to chant the hymn \"Kakka b Anu etellu shamame, \" \"The Planet of Anu Rises in the Skies,\" a priest went up to the \"topmost stage of the tower of the temple \" to watch the skies for the appearance of the Planet of Anu, Nibi ru. At the ex- pected moment and in the predetermined spot in the heavens, the planet was sighted. Thereupon the priests broke out in sing- ing the compositions \"To the One Who Grows Bright, the Heavenly Planet of the Lord Anu\" and \"The Creator's Image Has Arisen.\" A bonfire was lit in signal, and as th e news spread from one observation post to another, bonfir es were lit in one place after another. Before the night was over, the whole land was alight. In the morning, prayers of thanksgiving were offere d in the tem- ple's chapel, and in a sequence filled with ceremon y and symbol- ism, the celestial visitors began their departure. \"Anu is leaving,\" the priests chanted; \"Anu, great king of Heaven and Earth, we ask for your blessing,\" they intoned. After Anu gave th e asked-for blessings, the procession wound its way down the \"S treet of the Gods\" to the \"Place of the barque of Anu.\" There we re more prayers and hymn singing at a chapel called \"Build Life on Earth.\" Now it was time for those remaining behind to bless the departing couple, and the following verses were rec ited:"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"196 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Great Anu, may Heaven and Earth bless you!

It was the sev- enteenth day of their visit to Earth, a tablet foun d in the archives of Uruk states. The momentous visit was over. Its decisions opened the way for the establishment of new cities besides the Olden Ones. First and foremost among th em was Kish. It was put under the control of Ninurta. \"Enlil's F oremost Son\"; he turned it into Sumer's first administrative capi tal. For Nan- nar/Sin, \"Enlil's Firstborn,\" the new urban center of Ur (\"The City\") was established—a place that was to become S umer's eco- nomic heart. There were additional decisions concerning the new era in man- kind's advancement and its relations with the Anunn aki. We read in the Sumerian texts, concerning the crucial concl ave that launched Sumer's great civilization, that \"the grea t Anunnaki who decree the fate\" decided that the gods \"were too lo fty for Man- kind.\" The term used—elu in Akkadian—means exactly that: \"Lofty Ones\"; from it comes the Babylonian, Assyria n, Hebrew, and Ugaritic El— the term to which the Greeks gave the connotation \"god.\" There was a need, the Anunnaki decided, to give man kind \"Kingship\" as an intermediary between themselves an d the human citizenry. All the Sumerian records attest that thi s major decision was taken during Anu's visit, at a Council of the G reat Gods. One Akkadian text (the Fable of the Tamarisk and the Da tepalm) de- scribes thus the meeting that had taken place \"in l ong ago days, in far off times\": The gods of the land, Anu, Enlil and Enki, convened an assembly. Enlil and the gods took counsel; Among them was seated Shamash; Among them was seated Ninmah."},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"Peace on Earth 197 At that time \"there was not yet kingship in the lan d; the rule was held by the gods.\" But the Great Council resolved t o change that and to grant kingship to mankind. All the Sumerian sources agree that the first royal city was Kish. The men who wer e appointed by Enlil to be kings were called LU.GAL. \"Mighty Man.\" We find the same record in the Old Testament (Genesis chapt er 10): when mankind was establishing its kingdoms: Kish begot Nimrod; He was the first to be a Mighty Man in the Land . . . And the beginning of his kingship: Babel and Erech and Akkad, all in the land of Shin'ar [Sumer]. While the biblical text names the first three capit als as Kish, Babylon, and Erech, the Sumerian King Lists assert that Kingship moved from Kish to Erech and then to Ur, omitting a ny mention of Babylon. The apparent discrepancy has a reason: We believe it has to do with the incident of the Towerof Babel (Babyl on), which the Old Testament records in no small detail. It was an incident, we believe, that had to do with Marduk's insistence th at he, rather than Nannar, should possess Sumer's next capital. The ti me was clearly during the resettlement of the plain of Sumer(the b iblical Shin'ar), when new urban centers were being built: And as they travelled from the east, they found a valley in the Land of Shin'ar and settled there. And they said unto one another: \"Let us make bricks, and burn them by fire\"; and the brick served them as stone, and the bitumen served them as mortar. It was then that the scheme which caused the incide nt was sug- gested by an unnamed instigator: \"Come, let us buil d us a city, and a tower whose head shall reach the heavens.\" \"And Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower which the humans were building\"; and he said to unnamed c olleagues: \"This is just the beginning of their undertakings; from now on. any- thing that they shall scheme to do shall no longer be impossible for them.\" And Yahweh said to his colleagues: \"Come, le t us go down and confuse their language, so that they would not understand each"},{"pageNumber":201,"pageContent":"198 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN other's speech.\" Then the Lord \"scattered them from there all over the face of the Earth, and they ceased to build the city.\" That there was initially a time when mankind \"spoke in unison\" is a tenet of Sumerian historical recollections. Th ese also assert that the confusion of languages, accompanying the d ispersion of mankind, was a deliberate act of the gods. Like the Old Testament, the writings of Berossus reported that \"the gods in troduced a diver- sity of tongues among men, who until that time had all spoken the same language.\" Like the biblical tale, the histori es of Berossus connect the diversification of languages and the di spersion of man- kind to the incident of the Tower of Babel: \"When a ll men for- merly spoke the same language, some among them unde rtook to erect a large and lofty tower, that they might clim b up to heaven. But the Lord, sending forth a whirlwind, confounded their design, and gave to each tribe a particular language of its own.\" The conformity of the tales suggests the existence of a common, older source from which both the compilers of the O ld Testament and Berossus had obtained their information. Althou gh it is gener- ally assumed that such an original text has not yet been found, the fact is that George Smith, in his very first public ation in 1876, re- ported discovering at Ashurbanipal's library in Nin eveh \"a muti- lated account of part of the story of the Tower.'' The tale, he con- cluded, was originally written on two tablets; on t he one he had found (K-3657), there had been six columns of cunei form text; but he could piece together only fragments of four colu mns. It is un- doubtedly an Akkadian version of the Sumerian tale of the Tower of Babel; and it is clear from it that the incident was brought about not by mankind but by the gods themselves. Mankind was only a pawn in the struggle. As pieced together by George Smith, and retranslate d by W. S. C. Boscawen in the Transactions of the Society of Bibl ical Archae- ology (vol. V), the tale began with the identificat ion of the instiga- tor; damage to the lines, however, obliterated the name. \"The thoughts\" of this god's heart \"were evil; against t he Father of the Gods [Enlil] he was wicked.\" To achieve his evil pu rpose \"the people of Babylon he corrupted to sin,\" inducing \"s mall and great to mingle on the mound.\" As the sinful work came to the attention of \"the lo rd of the Pure Mound\"—already identified as Enlil in the Cattle an d Grain tale— Enlil \"to Heaven and on Earth spoke. ...

But D amkina stood by his side: \"With my son I rise . . . \" she said. The in complete verse that follows has her stating that \"his number\"—his numerical rank-status?—was at issue. The legible portion of column III then deals with E nid's efforts to talk the rebellious group out of their plans. Ta king himself up in a Whirlwind, \"Nunamnir [Enlil] from the heaven to e arth spoke; [but] by his path they did not go; violently they f ronted against him.\" When Enlil \"saw this, to earth he descended.\" But even his very presence on the site did not make a difference . We read in the last column that \"when a stop he did not make of th e gods,\" he had no choice but to resort to force: To their stronghold tower, in the night, a complete end he made. In his anger, a command he also poured out: To scatter abroad was his decision. He gave a command their counsels to confuse. . . . their course he stopped. The ancient Mesopotamian scribe ended the tale of t he Tower of Babel with a bitter memory: Because they \"against t he gods re- volted with violence, violently they wept for Babyl on; very much they wept.\" The biblical version also names Babel (Hebrew for B abylon) as the place where the incident had occurred. The name is significant, for in its original Akkadian—Bab-IIi—it meant \"Gate way of the Gods,\" the place by which the gods were to enter an d leave Sumer. It was there, the biblical narrative states, that t he perpetrators planned to construct \"a tower whose head shall reac h unto the heav- ens.\" The words are identical to the actual name of the ziggurat (seven-stage pyramid) which was the dominant featur e of ancient Bab- ylon (Fig. 64): E.SAG.ILA, \"House Whose Head is Lof ty.\" The biblical and the Mesopotamian texts—undoubtedly based on an original Sumerian chronicle—thus relate the s ame incident: Marduk's frustrated attempt to prevent the transfer of kingship from Kish to Erech and Ur—cities destined to be pow er centers of Nannar/Sin and his children—and to seize suzerainty for his own city, Babylon. By this attempt, however, Marduk started a chain of events re- plete with tragedies."},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"200 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Fig. 64"},{"pageNumber":204,"pageContent":"Peace on Earth 201 "},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"10 THE PRISONER IN THE PYRAMID The incident of the Tower of Babel brought to an un expected end the longest era of Peace on Earth that Man can reca ll.

To resolve them we shall offer our own theory of how this unique st ructure had been planned and constructed, then plugged and broken in to. To the many enigmas pertaining to the construction and purpose of the Great Pyramid at Giza, two more were added a fter its com- pletion. All theories concerning them, having been based on the as- sumption of a royal burial as the pyramid's purpose , have been found flawed and wanting. We believe that the answe rs lie not in the tales of the Pharaohs, but in the tales of the gods. Several references to the Great Pyramid in writings of classical Greek and Roman chroniclers attest to familiarity i n their times with the swivel-stone entrance into the pyramid, th e Descending Passage and the Subterranean Pit. There was no know ledge of the whole upper system of passages, galleries, and cham bers, because the Ascending Passage was plugged tight with three large granite blocks and further camouflaged with a triangular st one, so that no one going down the Descending Passage ever suspecte d that there existed a junction with an upper passage (Fig. 65). Over the many centuries that followed, even the kno wledge of the original entrance was forgotten; and when (in A . D . 820) the Ca- liph Al Mamoon decided to enter the pyramid, his me n forced an entry by tunneling aimlessly through the masonry. O nly when they heard a stone fall somewhere inside the pyramid did they tunnel in the direction of the sound, reaching the Descending Passage. The stone that had fallen was the triangular stone hidi ng the junction with the Ascending Passage; its fall revealed the g ranite plug.

Clearing the Ascending Passage of debris—pieces ofl imestone that had somehow slid down the passage to the grani te plugs—they crawled up to the upper end of this passage. Coming out of its squarelike tunnel, they could stand up, for they ha d reached the junction of the Ascending Passage with a Horizontal Passage and with the Grand Gallery (Fig. 66). They followed the Horizontal Passage, reaching the vaulted chamber at its end (w hich later ex- plorers named the \"Queen's Chamber\"); it was bare, and so was its enigmatic niche (see Fig. 49). Returning to the junction of the passages, they clambered up the Grand Gallery (Fig. 45); its pre- cisely cut grooves, now empty holes and nooks, help ed the climb up—a task made slippery by a layer of white dust th at covered the Gallery's floor and ramps. They climbed over the Gr eat Step, which rose from the upper end of the Gallery to bec ome flush with the floor of the Antechamber; entering it, they fou nd its blocking portcullises gone (Fig. 67).

Fig. 68"},{"pageNumber":209,"pageContent":"206 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The first and most persistent theory fitted the two puzzles into one answer. Holding that the pyramid was built by t he Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops) to be his tomb, the theory suggested that after his mummified body was placed in the \"Coffer\" in the \"K ing's Chamber,\" workmen slid the three granite plug block s from the Grand Gallery down the slope of the Ascending Passa ge, in order to seal off the tomb. This entrapped these workmen alive in the Grand Gallery. Outwitting the priests, the workmen removed the end stone in the ramp, dug out the Well Shaft, reac hed the De- scending Passage, and saved themselves by climbing up it to the pyramid's entrance/exit. But this theory does not stand up to critical scrut iny. The Well Shaft is made up of seven distinct segment s (Fig. 66). It begins with the upper horizontal segment (A) lea ding from the Grand Gallery to a vertical segment (B), which conn ects via a twisting segment C with a lower vertical segment D. A long, straight, but sharply inclined segment E then follo ws, leading into a shorter segment F inclined at a different angle. At the end of F, a segment intended to be horizontal but, in fact, sli ghtly slanting (G) then connects the Well Shaft with the Descending Pa ssage. Apart from the connecting, horizontal segments A and G, t he Well Shaft proper (segments B, C, D, E, and F), in spite of it s changing of courses when viewed on a north-south plane, lies pr ecisely on an east-west plane parallel to the pyramid's plane of passages and chambers: the separating distance of about six feet is bridged at the top by segment A and at the bottom by segment G. While the three upper segments of the Well Shaft tr averse some sixty feet through the pyramid's limestone masonry, the lower seg- ments were cut through some 150 feet of solid rock. The few work- men left behind to slide down the granite plugs (ac cording to the above-mentioned theory) could not have been able to cut through the rock. Also, if the digging was from above, wher e is all the debris, which they could have only brought up as th ey dug down? With the Well Shaft's twenty-eight-inch bore throug h most of its segments, the more than one thousand cubic feet of debris would have piled up in the upper passages and chambers. In view of these improbabilities, new theories were advanced based on an assumption that the Well Shaft was dug from the bot- tom up (the debris was then removed via the Descend ing Passage to outside the pyramid). But why? The answer is: an accident. As the Pharaoh was being entombed, an earthquake shook the pyra- mid, loosening prematurely the granite plugs. As a result, not mere"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 207 laborers, but members of the royal family and high priests, were trapped alive. With the pyramid's plans still avail able, rescue teams tunneled their way up, reached the Grand Gall ery, and saved the dignitaries. This theory (as well as a long-discarded one about grave robbers digging their way up) falters, among other points, on the matter of precision. With the exception of segment C, which w as tunneled through the masonry in a rough and irregular manner , and section G, two of whose squarish sides were left rough and not quite hori- zontal, all the other segments are straight, precis e, carefully fin- ished, and uniformly angled throughout their length s. Why would rescue workers (or grave robbers) waste time to ach ieve perfection and precision? Why would they bother to smooth the sides, when such smoothness made climbing the shaft much more d ifficult? As the evidence mounted that no Pharaoh had ever be en buried or enshrined within the Great Pyramid, a new theory gained adher- ents: The Well Shaft was cut to enable an examinati on of fissures that had developed in the rock as a result of an ea rthquake. The most articulate proponents of such a theory were th e brothers John and Morton Edgar (The Great Pyramid Passages and Ch ambers), who, motivated by a religious zeal which saw in the pyramid an ex- pression in stone of biblical prophecies, visited, cleared, exam- ined, measured, and photographed every known part o f the pyramid. They showed conclusively that the upper sh ort horizontal passage to the Well Shaft (A), as well as the upper most vertical sec- tion (B), were part and parcel of the original cons truction of the pyramid (Fig. 69). They also found that the lower v ertical section (D) was carefully built with masonry blocks as it p assed through a cavity (nicknamed The Grotto) in the bedrock (Fig. 70); it could have been so constructed only when the rock face wa s still ex- posed, before the Grotto was covered up with the ma sonry of the pyramid. In other words, this section, too, had to be part—a very early part—of the original construction of the pyra mid. As the pyramid was rising above its base—so the Edg ars theo- rized—a massive earthquake fissured the bedrock in several places. Needing to know the extent of the damage to determi ne whether the pyramid could still rise above the cracked bedrock, the builders cut through the rock segments E and F as Inspection Sha fts. Finding the damage not too serious, the pyramid's construction continued; but to allow periodic inspection, a short (about six-foot) passage (G) was tunneled from the Descending Passage to connect wit h section F, al- lowing entry into the Inspection Shafts from below."},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"208 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Fig. 69"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 209 Fig. 70 Though the theories of the Edgars (further expounde d by Adam Rutherford in Pyramidology) have been adopted by al l such pyra- midologists as well as by some Egyptologists, they still fall short of solving the enigmas.

When and why was the irregular, twisting sec tion C forced through the masonry? And what about the granite plu gs: Why were they needed if there had been no funeral and no bur ial? To these questions there has been no satisfactory answer, ne ither by pyra- midologists nor by Egyptologists. Yet the arduous and zealous measuring and remeasuri ng by both groups hold the key to the answers: the essential s egments of the Well Shaft, we believe, were indeed executed by the original builders, but neither as an afterthought nor in res ponse to an emer- gency. They were, rather, the fruit of forethought: features in- tended to serve as architectural guidelines in the construction of the pyramid. Much has already been written over the centuries of the Great Pyramid's wonderful proportions and remarkable geom etric ratios. However, because all other pyramids have only lower inner pas- sages and chambers, the tendency has persisted to v iew the whole upper system as a later-phase development. As a res ult, little atten- tion was paid to certain alignments between upper a nd lower fea- tures of the pyramid, which can be accounted for on ly if the upper and lower parts were planned and executed at one an d the same time. Thus, for example, the point at the Grand Gal lery where the floor rises abruptly to form the Great Step Up (U). the central axis of the \"Queen's Chamber\" (Q), and a Recess (R) at t he lowest short horizontal passage—are all placed exactly on one line, the pyramid's center line. Also, an enigmatic Down Step (5) in the up- per Horizontal Passage is aligned with the point ma rking the end (P) of the Descending Passage. And there are more s uch puzzling alignments, as our next diagram will show. Were all these alignments coincidences, architectur al freaks—or the result of careful planning and layout? As we sh all now show, these and other hitherto unrecognized alignments fl owed from the ingenious, yet simple, planning of the pyramid. And we will also prove that the original segments of the Well Shaft were integral ele- ments not only in the execution but also in the ver y planning of the pyramid. Let us begin with segment D, because we believe tha t it was the very first one. It is now generally agreed that the rocky knoll on which the pyramid was erected was flattened out in a stepped man- ner. The lowest face of the rock (which can be seen outside) formed the Base Line; the uppermost face of the roc k is at the Grotto level; there, the bottom layer (\"course\") of the pyramid's masonry can be seen. Since segment D lies below thi s masonry, it"},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 211 had to be cut and fashioned through the Grotto and the bedrock be- fore anything above it was constructed; i.e., befor e the Well Shaft segments A, B, and C. Because the only way to tunne l through the rock is from its exposed face downward, segment E, which begins its downward slope precisely from the end of D, cou ld have been cut only after segment D was completed; F had to fo llow E, and G came last. In other words, D must have been constructed with g reat preci- sion (see Fig. 70), through the Grotto and the rock , before all the other segments of the Well Shaft. But why was it lo cated where it is; why is it precisely vertical; why did it not co ntinue all the way up but was made of the length of which it is? Why, for that matter—a fact that has gone completel y unno- ticed—is segment E inclined to D and to the Base Li ne at the pre- cise angle of 45 o ? And why, if E was meant to serve as a connecting shaft, did it not simply continue until it reached the De- scending Passage but instead turned at an angle to become segment F? And why is this segment, F— another unnoticed fe ature- inclined to the Ascending Passage at the precise ri ght angle of 90°? To answer these questions we have asked ourselves: How did the pyramid's architects design and achieve these s ymmetries, per- fect alignments, and remarkable geometric congruati ons? The so- lution we have come up with can best be illustrated by a drawing (Fig. 71); it is a layout plan of the pyramid's ins ides, prepared by us—we believe—as it might have been drawn by the py ramid's own builders: a simple, yet ingenious, architectura l plan that achieves the impressive symmetry, alignments, and p erfection with the aid of a few lines and three circles! The construction of the pyramid began with the leve ling of the rocky knoll on which it was to rise. To give the st ructure greater stability the rock was cut to the Base Level only n ear the pyramid's circumference; at its core the face of the rock was higher, rising in stages. It was then, we believe, that the Grotto—a natural deform- ity in the rock or perhaps an artificial cavity—was selected as the point where the structure's alignments were to begi n. There, the first of the shafts, D, was placed verti cally through the Grotto—partly cut through the rock and partly b uilt with ma- sonry blocks (see Fig. 70). Its height (see Fig. 71 ) delineates pre- cisely the distance from the Base Level to the leve l where the rock ends and the masonry begins at the pyramid's core. It has been long recognized that the value pi —the factor governing the ratios between a circle or a sphere, its linear elements and its"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"212 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Fig. 71"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 213 area projections—has been employed in determining t he circumfer- ence, sides, and height of the pyramid. As our draw ing clearly shows, not only the pyramid's envelope but also eve rything inside it was determined with the aid of three equal circl es. Theodolitic equipment placed within shaft D beamed upward a key vertical line whose function we shall soon desc ribe. But first this equipment beamed out the horizontal rock/mason ry line, on which the centers of the three circles were placed. The first of these (Point 1) was at D; Points 2 and 3, where its circl e intersected the line, served as centers for the other two, overlapp ing circles. To draw these circles the pyramid's architects, of course, had to decide on the proper radius. Researchers of the Gre at Pyramid have been long frustrated by the inability to apply to i ts perfect propor- tions any of the ancient Egyptian units of measurem ent—neither the common cubit of 24 fingers nor the Royal cubit of 28 fingers (20.63\" or 525 millimeters). Some three centuries a go Sir Isaac Newton concluded that an enigmatic \"Sacred Cubit\" o f some 25.2\" was used not only in the construction of the pyramid but also in the construction of Noah's Ark and the temple in Jerusalem. Both Egyptologists and pyramidologists now accept t his conclu- sion as far as the pyramid is concerned. Our own ca lculations show that the radius adopted for the three circles envis ioned by us was equal to 60 such Sacred Cubits; the number 60 being , not acciden- tally, the base number of the Sumerian sexagesimal mathematical system. This measure of 60 Sacred Cubits is dominan t in the lengths and heights of the pyramid's inner structur e as well as in the dimensions of its base. Having selected the radius, the three circles were drawn; and now the pyramid began to take shape: where the seco nd circle in- tersected the Base Level (Point 4), the pyramid's s ide was to rise at the angle of 52°—a perfect angle because it is the only one which incorporates the pi ratios into the pyramid. From the bottom of shaft D, shaft E was then tunnel ed down, precisely inclined at 45° to D. The theodolite-beam projected from E upward, intersecting circle 2 at Point 5, provide d the sloping line for the pyramid's side and also marked off the half -area Level, on which the King's Chamber and the Antechamber were t o be placed (the 5-U-K line) and the Grand Gallery was to end. Projected downwards, the E slope determined point P at which the Descend- ing Passage was to end. and the vertical line from P determined the Down Step S in the upper Horizontal Passage. Turning to the third circle, we see that its center (Point 3)"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"214 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN marked the vertical center line of the pyramid. Whe re it intersected the half-area Line, the Great Up Step (U) was place d, marking the end of the Grand Gallery and the beginning of the K ing's Chamber floor. It also determined the position of the Queen 's Chamber (Q), which was placed exactly on the center line. By con necting Point 2 with Point U, the floor line of the Ascending Passa ge and the Grand Gallery was obtained. Shaft F was then tunneled from the end of the shaft E, precisely so that its beam intersected the ascending floor li ne 2-U at a right angle (90°). From its intersection with the first c ircle (Point 6), a line was drawn through Point 2, all the way up to t he side of the pyramid (Point 7). This delineated the Descending P assage, its junction with the Ascending Passage (at Point 2), a nd the entrance to the pyramid. The shafts D, E, and F and the three circles have t hus made possible most of the essential features of the Grea t Pyramid. Still undetermined, however, were the points at whi ch the As- cending Passage would end and the Grand Gallery beg in and, accordingly, where the level of the Horizontal Pass age to the Queen's Chamber would be. Here was, we believe, whe re shaft B came into play. No one has so far pointed out the fact that its length is precisely equal to that of D and that it marks off ex- actly the distance between the Entrance Level and t he level of the Horizontal Passage. B was placed where the Asce nding Line intersected circle 2 (Point 8). Its vertical e xtension marks the beginning of the rising wall of the Grand Galle ry; the dis- tance from Point 8 to Point 9, where the beam from D intersects the horizontal line from 8, is the place of the gra ndiose intersec- tion depicted in Fig. 68. Segment B, connected at Point 8 to the passages thr ough the short level segment A, thus enabled the pyramid's b uilders to com- plete it inside. When that was done, there was no l onger any archi- tectural or functional use for these segments, and the entrance to them was covered by placing there a well-fitting, w edge-shaped ramp stone (Fig. 72). Segments D, E, and F have also disappeared from vie w as the pyramid's masonry rose over the rocky base. It was then, perhaps, the function of the less precisely built segment G to enable the withdrawal of the beaming-theodolites from the D-E- F segments, or to make last-minute checks. Finally, where the D escending Pas- sage connected with this segment G, the opening was covered with"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 215 a well-fitting stone block; and these lower segment s, too, disap- peared from view. The pyramid stood complete, with all the segments o f the Well Shaft in their hidden places; all, that is, except one, which as we have shown had absolutely no function or purpose in the pyramid's planning and construction. The exception is the irregular and uncharacteristic segment C. unevenly twisting through the masonry, rudely, crud ely, and forc- ibly cut through the limestone courses in a manner that left many stone blocks broken and protruding. When, why. and how did this enigmatic section, C, come into being? That section, we believe, was not yet in existence when the pyr- amid was completed by its constructors. It was, we will show, hur- riedly forced through later on, when Marduk was imp risoned alive in the Great Pyramid. That Marduk was imprisoned alive in the \"Mountain T omb,\" there is no doubt; texts that have been found and a uthoritatively translated attest to that. Other Mesopotamian texts throw light on"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"216 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN the nature of his offense. All together they enable us to arrive at a plausible reconstruction of the events. Evicted from Babylon and Mesopotamia, Marduk return ed to Egypt. He promptly established himself in Heliopoli s, enhancing its role as his \"cult center\" by assembling his cel estial memora- bilia in a special shrine, to which Egyptians made pilgrimages for a long time thereafter. But seeking to reestablish his hegemony over Egypt, Marduk found that things had changed since he left Egypt t o attempt his coup d'etat in Mesopotamia. Though Thoth, we gather , did not put up a struggle for supremacy, and Nergal and Gibil w ere far from the center of power, a new rival had emerged in the interim: Dumu- zi. That younger son of Enki, his domain bordering Upper Egypt, was emerging as a pretender to the throne of Egypt. And behind his ambitions was none other than his br ide Inanna/Ishtar—another cause for Marduk's suspicions and dis- like. The tale of Dumuzi and Inanna—he a son of Enki. she a grand- daughter of Enlil—reads like an ancient tale of Rom eo and Juliet. Like Shakespeare's drama, it, too, ended in tragedy , death, and re- venge. The first presence of Inanna/Ishtar in Egypt is men tioned in the Edfu text dealing with the First Pyramid War. Calle d there Ashto- reth (her Canaanite name), she is said to have appe ared on the bat- tlefield among the advancing forces of Horus. The r eason for this inexplicable presence in Egypt might have been to v isit her bridegroom Dumuzi. through whose district the fight ing force was passing. That Inanna had gone to visit Dumuzi (\"The Herder\") in his faraway rural district, we know from a Sumerian text. It tells us how Dumuzi stood awaiting her arrival and echoes hi s reassuring words to a bride baffled by a future in a foreign l and: The young lad stood waiting; Dumuzi pushed open the door. Like a moonbeam she came forth to him . . . He looked at her, rejoiced in her. Took her in his arms and kissed her. The Herder put his arm around the maiden; \"I have not carried you off into slavery,\" [he said ]; \"Your table will be a splendid table. the splendid table where I myself eat . . .\""},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 217 At that time Inanna/Ishtar had the blessing of her parents, Nannar/Sin and Ningal, as well as of her brother Ut u/Shamash, to the Romeo-and-JuIiet love match between a granddaug hter of Enlil and a son of Enki. Some brothers of Dumuzi, and pro bably Enki himself, also gave their consent. They presented In anna with a gift of lapis lazuli, the blue-hued precious stone she c herished. As a surprise they hid beads and squares of the stone un der a heap of her favorite fruit: dates. In the bedroom she found \"a bed of gold, adorned with lapis lazuli, which Gibil had refined for her in the abode of Nergal.\" And then the fighting broke out, and brother fought brother. As long as the fighting was only between the descendan ts of Enki, no one saw any particular problem in having a granddau ghter of Enlil around. But after the victory of Horus, when Seth o ccupied lands not his, the situation changed completely: The Seco nd Pyramid War pitched the sons and grandchildren of Enlil aga inst the de- scendants of Enki. \"Juliet\" had to be separated fro m her \"Ro- meo.\" When the lovers were reunited after that war, and t heir marriage consummated, they spent many days and nights in bli ss and ecstasy—the subject of numerous Sumerian love songs . But even as they were making love Inanna was whispering prov oking words to Dumuzi: As sweet as your mouth are your parts. they befit a princely status! Subdue the rebellious country, let the nation multi ply: I will direct the country rightly! Another time she confessed to him her vision: I had a vision of a great nation choosing Dumuzi as God of its country . . . For I have made Dumuzi's name exalted, I gave him status. With all that it was not a happy union, for it did not produce an heir—an essential requirement, it appears, for carr ying out the di- vine ambitions. Thus it came to pass that in an att empt to have a male heir, Dumuzi resorted to a tactic adopted way back by his own father: he tried to seduce and have intercourse with his own sister. But whereas in bygone days Ninharsag agreed to Enki's ad-"},{"pageNumber":221,"pageContent":"218 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN vances, Dumuzi's sister Geshtinanna refused. In his desperation Dumuzi violated a sexual taboo: he raped his own si ster. The tragic tale is recorded on a tablet catalogued by scholars as CT. 15.28-29. The text relates how Dumuzi bade Inan na good-bye as he announced his plan to go to the desert-plain where his flocks were. By prearrangement his sister, \"the song-knowi ng sister, was sitting there.\" She thought she was invited for a p icnic. As they were \"eating the pure food, dripping with honey and butter, as they were drinking the fragrant divine beer,\" and \" were spending the time in a happy mood . . . Dumuzi took the sole mn decision to do it.\" To prepare his sister for what he had in mi nd, Dumuzi took a lamb and copulated it with its mother, then had a kid copulate with its sister lamb. As the animals were committin g incest, Dum- uzi was touching his sister in emulation, \"but his sister still did not understand.\" As Dumuzi's actions became more and mo re obvi- ous, Geshtinanna \"screamed and screamed in protest\" ; but \"he mounted her ... his seed was flowing into her vulva . . . .\" \"Halt!\" she shouted, \"it is a disgrace!\" But he did not stop. Having done his deed, \"the Shepherd, being fearless , being shameless, spoke to his sister.\" What he said is un fortunately lost to us due to breaks in the tablet. But we suspect t hat he had— \"fearlessly, shamelessly\" as the text had stated—go ne on to explain to Geshtinanna the reasons for his deed. Th at it was pre- meditated is clear from the text; it is also stated that Inanna was in on the plan: Dumuzi, prior to leaving, \"spoke to he r of planning and advice\" and Inanna \"to her spouse answered abou t the plan, to him she gave her advice.\" Rape, under the moral codes of the Anunnaki, was a serious sex- ual transgression. In the earliest times, when the first teams of as- tronauts had landed on Earth, a court-martial sente nced their supreme commander Enlil to exile for having raped a young nurse (whom he later married). Dumuzi had surely known al l this; so he either expected his sister to engage in the interco urse willingly or else had compelling reasons for his deed which over rode the prohi- bition. Inanna's prior consent brings to mind the b iblical tale of Abraham and his sonless wife Sarah, who offered him her maid- servant so that he might have a male heir. Aware that he had done a horrible deed, Dumuzi was soon there- after seized with a premonition that he was to pay for his deed with his life, as told in the Sumerian text SHA.GA.NE. I R IM.SHI— \"His Heart Was Filled With Tears.\" Composed in the form of a self-fulfilling dream, the text relates how Dumuzi fell asleep and"},{"pageNumber":222,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 219 dreamed that all his attributes of status and prope rty were being taken away from him one by one, by the \"Princely Bi rd'* and a fal- con. The nightmare ended with Dumuzi seeing himself lying dead in the midst of his sheepfolds. Waking up, he asked his sister Geshtinanna to tell him the mean- ing of the dream. \"My brother.\" she said, \"your dre am is not fa- vorable, it is very clear to me.\" It foretold \"band its rising against you from ambush . . . your hands will be bound in h andcuffs, your amis will be bound in fetters.\" No sooner had Geshtinanna finished talking than the evil ones appeared beyond the hill and caught Dumuzi. Bound in handcuffs and fetters. Dumuzi cried out an appeal to Utu/Shamash: \"O Utu. you are my brother-in-law, I a m your sis- ter's husband. . . . Change my hands into a gazelle 's hands, change my feet into a gazelle's feet, let me escape the evil ones!\" Hearing his appeal. Utu enabled Dumuzi to escape. A lter some ad- ventures Dumuzi sought a hiding place in the house of Old Belili—a questionable character playing a double ro le. Dumuzi was captured again and again escaped. In the end he found himself hiding once again in the sheepfolds. A strong wind was blowing, the drinking cups were overturned; the evil ones cl osed in on him— all as he had seen in his dream. And in the end: The drinking cups lay on their side; Dumuzi was dead. The sheepfold was thrown into the wind. The arena of these events, in this text, is a deser tlike plain neara river. The geography is enlarged upon in another ve rsion of the events, a text titled \"The Most Bitter Cry.\" Compos ed as a lament by Inanna, it tells how seven deputies of Kur enter ed the sheepfold and aroused Dumuzi from his sleep. Unlike the previ ous version, which simply referred to the seizure of Dumuzi by \" evil ones,\" this text makes it clear that they had come on high er authority: \"My master has sent us for you,\" the chief deputy a nnounced to the awakened god. They proceed to strip Dumuzi of h is divine at- tributes: Take the divine headdress off your head, get up bareheaded; Take the royal robe off your body, get up naked;"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"220 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Lay aside the divine staff which is in your hand, get up empty-handed; Take the holy sandals off your feet, get up barefooted! The seized Dumuzi manages to escape and reaches the river \"at the great dike in the desert of E.MUSH (\"Home of th e snakes\"). There was only one such place in Egypt, where deser t and river met at a great dike: at the first Nile Cataract, th e place where nowa- days the great dam of Aswan is located. But the swirling waters did not let Dumuzi reach th e other riverbank where his mother and Inanna were standing by to offer him protection. Instead \"there did the boat-wreckin g waters carry the lad towards Kur; to Kur did the boat-wrecking w aters carry the espoused of Inanna.\" This and other parallel texts reveal that those who had come to seize Dumuzi were in fact arresting him in accordan ce with the or- ders given by a higher god, the Master of Kur, who \"a sentence did pass upon him.\" But it could not have been a senten ce passed by the full Assembly of the gods: Enlilite gods, such as Utu/Shamash and Inanna, were helping Dumuzi escape. The sentenc e, then, was one-sided, passed only by the authority of the mast er of the arrest- ing deputies. He was none other than Marduk, the el der brother of both Dumuzi and Geshtinanna. His identity comes through in the text named by sch olars \"The Myths of Inanna and Bilulu.\" In it the shady Old Be lili turns out to have been a male, the Lord B i l u l u (EN.BILULU) in di sguise, and the very deity who directed the punitive action aga inst Dumuzi. Akkadian texts dealing with divine epithets explain ed that En- Bilulu was il Marduk sha hattati, \"the god Marduk w ho had sinned,\" and \"The Sorrower of Inanna.\" Having disapproved of the Dumuzi-Inanna love match from the beginning, Marduk no doubt was even more opposed to the union after the Pyramid Wars. The rape of Geshtinanna by Dumuzi— politically motivated—was thus an opportunity for M arduk to block the designs Inanna had on Egypt, by seizing a nd punishing Dumuzi. Did Marduk intend to put Dumuzi to death? P robably not; solitary exile was the customary punishment. T he death of Dumuzi, in a manner that has remained unclear, was probably ac- cidental.

Kramer (Sum erian Mythol- ogy) named \"'Inanna and Ebih.\" He considered it as belonging to the cycle of \"'slaying-of-the-dragon myths,\" for it deals with Inan- na's struggle against an evil god hiding inside \"Th e Mountain.\" The available fragments relate how Inanna armed her self with an array of weapons to attack the god in his hiding pl ace. Though the other gods tried to dissuade her. she confidently a pproached The Mountain, which she called E.BIH (\"Abode of Sorrowf ul Call- ing\"). Haughtily she proclaimed: Mountain, thou art so high, thou art elevated above all others . . . Thou touchest the sky with thy tip . . . Yet I shall destroy thee. To the ground 1 shall fell thee . . . Inside thine heart pain I will cause. That The Mountain was the Great Pyramid, that the c onfronta- tion was at Giza in Egypt, is evident not only from the texts, but also from a depiction on a Sumerian cylinder seal ( Fig. 73). Inan- na—shown in her familiar enticing, half-naked pose— is seen con- fronting a god based upon three pyramids. The pyram ids are depicted exactly as they appear to view in Giza: th e Egyptian ankh sign, the priest in an Egyptian headdress, and the entwined ser- pents add up to one locale: Egypt. As Inanna continued to challenge Marduk, now hiding inside the mighty structure, her fury rose as he ignored her t hreats. \"For the second time, infuriated by his pride, Inanna approa ched [the pyra- mid] again and proclaimed: 'My grandfather Enlil ha s permitted me to enter inside The Mountain!' \" Flaunting her w eapons, she haughtily announced: \"Into the heart of The Mountai n I shall penetrate. . . Inside The Mountain, my victory I sh all establish!\" Getting no response, she began her attack:"},{"pageNumber":225,"pageContent":" Fig. 73 She ceased not striking the sides of E-Bih and all its corners, even its multitude of raised stones.

His hiding place is also clearly identified as \"the E.KUR, whose walls aweso mely reach the skies\"—the Great Pyramid. The record of the trial and sentencing of Marduk is available from a fragmentary text published by the Babylonian Section of the Museum of the University of Pennsylvania. The extan t lines begin where the gods had surrounded the pyramid, and a go d chosen to be a spokesman addressed Marduk \"in his enclosure\"; \"the one who was evil he implored.\" Marduk was moved by the message: \"Despite the anger of his heart, clear tears came i nto his eyes\"; and he agreed to come out and stand trial.

But was it premeditated or accidental? Mardu k deserved a death sentence, but what if his crime was not delib erate? Standing there, in sight of the pyramids, with Mard uk fresh out of his hiding place, the solution dawned on Inanna, and she pro- ceeded to address the gods: On this day, the Lady herself, She who speaks truth. The accuser of Azag. the great princess. An awesome judgment uttered. There was a way to sentence Marduk to death without actually executing him, she said: Let him be buried alive wi thin the Great Pyramid!

T he Ashur text suggests that it had served as a script for a New Y ear's mystery play in Babylon that reenacted the god's suffering and reprieve. But neither the original Babylonian version, nor th e Sumerian his- torical text on which the script was based, have so far been found. Heinrich Zimmem, who transcribed and translated the Ashur text from clay tablets in the Berlin Museum, create d quite a stir in theological circles when he announced its interpret ation at a lecture in September 1921. The reason was that he interpret ed it as a pre- Christian Mysterium dealing with the death and resu rrection of a god, and thus an earlier Christ tale. When Stephen Langdon in- cluded an English translation in his 1923 volume on the Mesopota- mian New Year Mystery Texts, he titled the text The Death and Resurrection of Bel-Marduk and highlighted its para llels to the New Testament tale of the death and resurrection of Jesus. But, as the text relates, Marduk or Bel (\"The Lord\" ) did not die; he was indeed incarcerated inside The Mountain as in a tomb; but he was entombed alive. The ancient \"script\" begins with an introduction of the actors. The first one \"is Bel, who was confined in The Moun tain.\" Then there is a messenger who brings the news of the imp risonment to Marduk's son Nabu. Shocked by the news, Nabu hasten s to The Mountain in his chariot. He arrives at a structure and the script ex- plains: \"that is the house at the edge of The Mount ain wherein they question him.\" In reply to the guards' questions, t hey are told that the agitated god is \"Nabu who from Borsippa comes; it is he who comes to seek after the welfare of his father who i s imprisoned.\" Actors then come out and rush about on the stage: \" they are the people who in the streets hasten; they seek Bel, sa ying: 'Where is he held captive?'\" We learn from the text that \"aft er Bel had gone into The Mountain, the city fell into tumult\" and \" because of him fighting within it broke out.\" A goddess appears; s he is Sarpanit. the sister-wife of Marduk. She is confronted by a m essenger \"who weeps before her, saying: 'Unto The Mountain they h ave taken him.' ' He shows her the garments of Marduk (possib ly blood- stained): \"these are his raiment, which they took o ff him,\" he says; instead of these, he reports, Marduk \"with a Garment-of- Sentence was clothed.\" What the audience is shown a re shrouds: \"That means: in a coffin he is.\" Marduk has been bu ried!"},{"pageNumber":228,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 225 Sarpanit goes to a structure that symbolizes Marduk 's tomb. She sees a group of mourners. The script explains: These are those who make lament after the gods had locked him up, separating him from among the living. Into the House of Captivity, away from the sun and light, they put him in prison. The drama has reached its ominous peak: Marduk is d ead. . . . But wait—all hope is not lost! Sarpanit recites an appeal to the two gods who can approach Inanna regarding Marduk's incarcera- tion, her father Sin and her brother Utu/Shamash: \" She prays to Sin and Shamash, saying: 'Give life to Bel!' \" Priests, a stargazer, and messengers now appear in procession, reciting prayers and incantations. Offerings are ma de to Ishtar, \"that she may show her mercy.\" The high priest appe als to the su- preme god, to Sin and to Shamash: \"Restore Bel to l ife!\" Now the drama takes a new turn. Suddenly the actor who repre- sents Marduk, clothed with shrouds which \"with bloo d are dyed,\" speaks out: \"I am not a sinner! I shall not be smit ten!\" He an- nounces that the supreme god has reviewed his case and found him not guilty. Who, then, was the murderer? The attention of the a udience is diverted to a doorpost; \"it is the doorpost of Sarp anit in Babylon.\" The audience learns that the real guilty god has be en captured. They see his head through the doorway: \"That is the head of the evildoer, whom they shall smite and slay.\" Nabu, who had returned to Borsippa, \"comes back fro m Borsippa; he comes and stands over the evildoer and regards him.\" We do not learn the identity of The Evildoer, excep t to be told that Nabu had seen him before in Marduk's company. \"This is the sinner,\" he says, and thereby seals the captive's f ate. The priests grab The Evildoer; he is slain: \"The on e whose sin it was\" is carried away in a coffin. The murderer of D umuzi has paid with his life. But is the sin of Marduk—as the indirect cause of D umuzi's death—atoned? Sarpanit reappears, wearing the Garme nts-of- Atonement. Symbolically she wipes away the blood th at has been spilled.

Again, ap- peals are directed to the supreme god. The supremac y of Ninurta, which had once been proclaimed when Ninurta vanquis hed Zu, is reasserted, apparently to allay any fear that a rel eased Marduk might become a challenger for supremacy among the g ods. The ap- peals succeed, and the supreme god sends the divine messenger Nusku to \"announce the [good] tidings to all the go ds.\" As a gesture of good will, Gula (the spouse of Ninu rta) sends to Sarpanit new clothing and sandals for Marduk; Mardu k's driver- less chariot also appears. But Sarpanit is dumbfoun ded: she cannot understand how Marduk can be free again if he had b een impris- oned in a tomb that cannot be unsealed: \"How can th ey let him free, the one who cannot come out?\" Nusku. the divine messenger, tells her that Marduk shall pass through SA.BAD, the \"chiseled upper opening.\" He ex plains that it is Dalat biri sha iqabuni ilani A doorway-shaft which the gods will bore; Shunu itasrushu ina biti etarba Its vortex they will lift off. his abode they shall reenter.

This description of how Marduk shall be released ha s remained meaningless to scholars; but the verses are explosi vely meaningful to us. As we have explained, the irregular and twis ting segment C of the Well Shaft had not existed when the pyramid was completed and when Marduk was imprisoned within it; it was, i nstead, the very \"doorway-shaft which the gods will bore\" to re scue Marduk. Still familiar with the pyramid's inner layout, the Anunnaki real- ized that the shortest and quickest way to reach th e starved Marduk"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"The Prisoner in the Pyramid 227 was to tunnel a connecting shaft between the existi ng segments B and D—a tunneling of a mere thirty-two feet through the relatively soft limestone blocks; it was a task that could be achieved not in days but in hours. Removing the stone that covered the Well Shaft's en trance from the Descending Passage to G, the rescuers quickly c limbed up in- clined segments Fand E. Where E connected with vert ical segment D, a granite stone covered the entrance in the Grot to: it was pushed aside—and still lies there, in the Grotto—as we hav e shown in Fig. 70. Now the rescuers climbed the short distance up segment D, and faced the first course of the pyramid's masonry. Thirty-two feet above but to the side lay the botto m of vertical segment B and the way into the Grand Gallery. But w ho could have known how to bore a twisting connecting shaft—C—exc ept those who had built the pyramid, knew of its inner sealed -off upper sec- tions, and had the plans to locate them? It was the rescuers of Marduk, we suggest, who used their tools to break through the limestone blocks, the link bet ween D and B: \"a hollowing into its insides they shall twistingly bore,\" in the words of the ancient text. Achieving the linkup with B, they clambered to the short, hori- zontal passage, A. There, any stranger would have s topped short even if he had gone that far up, for all he would h ave seen would be a stone wall—solid masonry. Again we suggest that o nly the Anun- naki, who had the pyramid's plan, could have known that beyond the stone facing them there lay the immense cavity of the Grand Gallery, the Queen's Chamber, and all the other upp er chambers and passages of the pyramid. To gain access to those chambers and passages it wa s necessary to remove the wedgelike ramp stone (Fig. 72). But i t was wedged too tightly and could not be moved. If the stone would have been moved away, it would h ave still been lying there, in the Grand Gallery. Instead, th ere is a gaping hole (Fig. 68), and those who have examined it have invariably used the words blown up and blown open to describe what it looks like; and it was done not from the Gallery but from inside the Shaft: \"the hollow has the appearance of having bee n burst open by tremendous force from within\" the Shaft (Rutherf ord. Pyramid- ology). Again the Mesopotamian record offers a solution. Th e stone was indeed removed from within the horizontal passagewa y, because it was from there that the rescuers had arrived. And i t was indeed"},{"pageNumber":231,"pageContent":"228 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN \"burst open by a tremendous force\"; in the words of the ancient text, \"Getting near, into its midst they will break through.\" The fragments of the limestone block slid down the Asce nding Pas- sage, down all the way to the granite plugs; that i s where Al Mamoon's men found them. The explosion also covered the Grand Gallery with the fine, white dust the Arabs had fou nd covering the floor of the Grand Gallery—mute evidence of the anc ient explosion and the gaping hole it had left. Having broken through into the Grand Gallery, the r escuers led Marduk back the way they came. The entry from the D escending Passage was sealed up again, to be discovered by Al Mamoon's men. The granite plugs remained in place with the t riangular junc- tion stone hiding the plugs and the Ascending Passa ge for millen- nia. And, inside the pyramid, the original upper an d lower parts of the Well Shaft were now for all future days connect ed by a twisting, harshly tunneled segment. And what of the rescued Prisoner of the pyramid? Mesopotamian texts relate that he went into exile; in Egypt Ra acquired the epithet Amen, \"The Hidden One.\" Circa 2000 B.C., he reappeared to claim again supre macy; for that, mankind ended up paying a most bitter price."},{"pageNumber":232,"pageContent":"11 \"A QUEEN AM I!\" The tale of Inanna/Ishtar is a tale of a \"self-made goddess.\" Nei- ther one of the Olden Gods, the original group of a stronauts from the Twelfth Planet, nor even a firstborn daughter o f one of them, she nevertheless propelled herself to the highest r anks and ended up a member of the Pantheon of Twelve. To achieve t hat she com- bined her cunning and her beauty with ruthlessness— a goddess of war and a goddess of love, who counted among her lo vers both gods and men. And it was she of whom there had been a true case of death and resurrection. Inasmuch as the death of Dumuzi was brought about b y Inanna's desire to become a queen on Earth, the imprisonment and exile of Marduk did little to satisfy her ambitions. Now, ha ving challenged and prevailed over a major god, she felt she could no longer be de- prived of a domain of her own. But where? The funeral of Dumuzi, one gathers from such texts as Inanna 's Descent to the Lower World, was held in the Land of Mines in southern Africa. It was the domain of Inanna's sist er Ereshkigal and her spouse Nergal. Enlil and Nannar, even Enki, advised Inanna not to go there; but she made up her mind: \" From the Great Above she set her mind toward the Great Below\"; and when she arrived at the gate of her sister's capital city, s he said to the gatekeeper: \"Tell my elder sister, Ereshkigal,\" tha t she had come \"to witness the funeral rites.\" One would expect the meeting between the sisters to have been heartwarming, filled with sympathy for the bereaved Inanna. We learn instead that Inanna, who came uninvited, was received with unrestrained suspicion. As she was let through the seven gates of the city leading to Ereshkigal's palace, she was ma de to give up her emblems and regalia of divine status. When Inanna f inally came into the presence of her sister, she found her sitt ing on her throne surrounded by seven Anunnaki with a judicial capaci ty. \"They fastened their eyes upon her, the eyes of death.\" T hey said angry things to her, \"words which torture the spirit.\" In stead of being welcomed, Inanna was sentenced to be hung as a corp se from a 229"},{"pageNumber":233,"pageContent":"230 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN stake. ... It was only through the intervention of Enki that she was saved and revived. The texts do not explain the reasons for the harsh treatment meted out to Inanna. nor quote the \"torturing words \" her accusers cast at her. But we learn from the beginning of the text that at the same time that she went on her trip, Inanna sent he r messenger to \"fill heaven with complaints for me, in the assembl y [of the gods] cry out for me.\" Attending a funeral was thus a mer e pretext; what she had in mind was to force the gods to satisfy a complaint that she wished to dramatize. From the moment of her arrival at the first gate. I nanna threat- ened violence if she would not be let in. When the news of her ar- rival was brought to Ereshkigal, ' 'her face turned pale . . . her lips turned dark\" and she wondered out loud what the rea l purpose of the visit was. When the two came face-to-face, \"Ere shkigal saw her and burst out at her presence; Ishtar. unflinch ing, flew at her.\" Somehow Inanna's intentions spelled danger for Eres hkigal! We have already found that many of the biblical mar ital and suc- cession laws were akin to such laws that governed t he behavior of the Anunnaki; the rules regarding a half-sister are but one example. The clue to Inanna's intentions, we believe, can be found in the book of Deuteronomy, the fifth book of Moses, in wh ich the He- brew code of personal behavior was spelled out. Cha pter 25 (verses 5-10) deals with the instance when a married man di es without having had a son. If the man had a brother, the wid ow could not remarry a stranger: it was the duty of the brother— even a married one—to marry his widowed sister-in-law and have chi ldren by her; and the firstborn boy was to bear the name of the d eceased brother, \"so that his name shall not be blotted out.\" This, we believe, is what had also been Inanna's re ason for her risky journey. For Ereshkigal was married to Nergal , a brother of Dumuzi: Inanna had come to put the Rule into play. . . . The cus- tom, we know, put the onus on the eldest brother, w ho was, in the case of the sons of Enki, Marduk. But Marduk was fo und guilty of indirectly causing the death of Dumuzi, and was pun ished and ex- iled. Had Inanna then the right to demand that the next in line, Nergal, take her as his second wife so that she cou ld have a male heir? The personal and succession problems that Inanna's intentions would have caused Ereshkigal can well be imagined. Would Inanna be satisfied to be a second wife, or would s he connive and scheme to usurp the queenship over the African doma in? Obvi-"},{"pageNumber":234,"pageContent":"\"A Queen Am I!\" 231 ously Ereshkigal was not willing to take chances. A nd so it was, we believe, that after harsh words between the sist ers, Inanna was hauled before a hastily convened court of \"seven An unnaki who judge,\" was found in violation of the rules, and wa s summarily hung on a stake to die a slow death. She survived o nly because her father-in-law, Enki, on hearing the terrible news, rushed two emis- saries to save her. \"Upon the corpse they directed that which pul- sates and that which radiates\"; they administered t o her the \"water of life\" and the \"food of life,\" and \"Inanna arose. \" Back in Sumer the revived Inanna, heartbroken and l onely, spent her time on the banks of the Euphrates River, tendi ng a wild- growing tree and voicing her sorrows: When at last shall I have a holy throne. that I may sit on it? When at last shall I have a holy bed, that I may lie on it? Concerning this Inanna spoke . . . She who let her hair down is ill at heart; The pure Inanna. Oh how she weeps! One who had taken pity on—and a liking to—Inanna wa s her great-grandfather, Anu. It is known from Sumerian t exts that Inanna, who was born on Earth, \"went up to Heaven\" at least once; it is also known that Anu had visited Earth o n several occa- sions. When and where exactly did Anu embrace Inann a as his Anunitum (\"Beloved of Anu\") is not clear, but it wa s more than mere Sumerian gossip when texts hinted that the lov e between Anu and his great-granddaughter was more than platonic. Assured thus of sympathy at the highest level, Inan na raised the issue of a dominion, a \"land,\" to rule over. But wh ere? The treatment meted out to Inanna, whatever its rea sons, made it clear that she could not expect to attain a dominio n in Africa. Her spouse Dumuzi was dead, and with him died her claim s to queen- ship in the lands of Enki's descendants. If her suf fering and pre- vailing over a major god entitled her to a dominion of her own, it had to be elsewhere. But Mesopotamia, too, and the lands bor- dering on Mesopotamia were all spoken for. Where co uld Inanna be given dominion? Casting their eyes about, the go ds came up with an answer.

This suggests that those events had taken place after the Sumerian urban civilization had already b egun circa 3800 B.C. On the other hand, the Egyptian background of the tales makes no reference to urban settlements and describ es a pastoral environment, suggesting a time prior to 3100 B.C.. when urban civ- ilization in Egypt began. In the writings of Maneth o a chaotic pe- riod of 350 years is said to have preceded the urba n kingship of Menes. That period between 3450 and 3100 B . C . appears to have been the time of the troubles and tribulations trig gered by Marduk: the Tower of Babel incident; and the Dumuzi affair, when a god of Egypt was captured and killed, when the Great God o f Egypt was imprisoned and exiled. It was then, we believe, that the Anunnaki turned t heir attention to the Third Region of the Indus Valley, where civi lization began soon thereafter. Unlike the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations that lasted for millennia and continued, to this very day, thro ugh offspring civilizations, the one in the Third Region lasted o nly a millennium. Soon thereafter it began to decline, and by 1600 B . C . it was totally gone—its cities in ruins, its people dispersed. Hum an plunder and the ravages of nature gradually obliterated the civ ilization's re- mains; in time it was totally forgotten. It was onl y in the 1920s that archaeologists, led by Sir Mortimer Wheeler, began to unearth two principal centers and several sites in between, str etching over more than four hundred miles from the Indian Ocean coast northward, along the Indus River and its tributaries. Both sites—Mohenjo-Daro to the south and Harappa in the north—show that they were cities of substance, some three miles in circumference. High walls ran around and within the cities; these walls, as well as the public and private buildings, were all con- structed of bricks made of clay or mud. Originally there were so many of these bricks that in spite of constant rans acking by subse- quent home-builders both in ancient times as well a s more recently for such purposes as ballast for the Lahore-Multan railroad, enough still remains standing to reveal the site of the cities and the fact that they were laid out in accordance with pre conceived city building plans. At both sites the city was dominated by an acropoli s—a raised area of citadels and temples. In both instances the se structures were of the same measurements and similarly oriented exa ctly on a north-south axis—proving that their builders follow ed strict rules when it came to erecting the temples. In both citie s the second larg-"},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"\"A Queen Am I!\" 233 esi feature was immense granaries—grain silos of a vast size and impressive functionality, situated near the riverba nk. This suggests that grains were not only the chief crop, but also the chief export product of the Indus civilization. The cities and the few artifacts that were still fo und in their remains—furnaces, urns, pottery, bronze tools, copp er beads, some silver vessels, and ornaments—all attest to a high civilization that was suddenly transplanted from elsewhere. Thus the two earli- est brick buildings at Mohenjo-Daro (a huge granary and a fort tower) were reinforced with timbers—a construction method to- tally unsuitable to the Indus climate. This method, however, was soon abandoned, and all subsequent construction avo ided timber- reinforcing. Scholars have concluded from this that the initial builders were foreigners accustomed to their own cl imatic needs. Seeking the fountainhead of the Indus civilization, scholars con- cluded that it could not have arisen independently of the Sumerian civilization, which preceded it by almost a thousan d years. In spite of notable differentiations (such as the yet undeci phered picto- graphic script), the analogies to Mesopotamia are e verywhere. The use of dried mud or clay bricks for construction; t he layout of city streets; the drainage system; the chemical methods used for etch- ing, for glazing, and for bead-making; the shapes a nd design of metal daggers and jars—all bear striking similarity to what had been uncovered at Ur or Kish or other Mesopotamian sites. Even the designs and symbols on pottery, seals, or other clay objects are virtual duplicates of those of Mesopotamia. Signifi cantly the Mes- opotamian sign of the cross—the symbol of Nibiru, t he Home Planet of the Anunnaki—was also prevalent throughou t the Indus civilization. Which gods did the people of the Indus Valley worsh ip? The few pictorial depictions that have been found show them wearing the divine Mesopotamian homed headdress. More abundant clay figu- rines indicate that the dominant deity was a goddes s, usually naked and bare-chested (Fig. 74a) or with rows of beads a nd necklaces as her sole covering (Fig. 74b); these were well-known depictions of Inanna, found in abundance in Mesopotamia and throu ghout the Near East. It is our suggestion that in their searc h for a land for Inanna, the Anunnaki decided to make the Third Regi on her do- minion.

Of particular interest is a long text named by scholars Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, whose bac kground is the rise to power of Uruk (the biblical Erech) and of Inanna. The text describes Aratta as the capital of a land situated be- yond mountain ranges and beyond Anshan; i.e., beyon d south- eastern Iran. This is precisely where the Indus Val ley lay: and such scholars as J. van Dijk (Orientalia 39, 1970) have sur- mised that Aratta was a city \"situated on the Irani an plateau or on the Indus river.\" What is most striking is the f act that the text speaks of the grain silos of Aratta. It was a place where \"wheat was growing of itself, beans also growing of them- selves\"—crops growing and stored in the storehouses of Aratta. Then, to be exported, they \"poured grain in to sacks, loaded them on the crate-carrying donkeys, and plac ed them on the sides of the transporting donkeys.\" Aratta's geographical location and the fact that it is a place re- nowned for its grain and bean storehouses bear forc eful similarities to the Indus civilization. Indeed one must wonder w hether Harappa or Arappa is not a present-day echo of the ancient Aratta. The ancient tale takes us back to the beginning of kingship at Erech. when a demigod (the son of Utu/Shamash by a human fe- male) was both high priest and king at the sacred p recinct from which the city was to develop. Circa 2900 B.C. he w as succeeded by his son Enmerkar, \"who built Uruk\" (according to the Sume- rian King Lists), transforming it from the nominal abode of an ab- sentee god (Anu) to a major urban center of a reign ing deity. He achieved this by persuading Inanna to choose Erech as her princi- pal seat of power and by aggrandizing for her the E anna (\"House of Anu\") temple. We read in the ancient text that at first all Enmer kar demanded of Aratta was that it contribute \"precious stones, bronze, lead, slabs of lapis lazuli\" to the building of the enlar ged temple, as well as \"artfully fashion gold and silver\" so that the H oly Mount being raised for Inanna would be worthy of the goddess. But no sooner was this done than the heart of Enmer kar grew haughty. A drought had afflicted Aratta, and Enmerk ar now de- manded not only materials but also obedience: \"Let Aratta submit to Erech!\" he demanded. To achieve his purpose Enme rkar sent to Aratta a series of emissaries to conduct what S. N. Kramer (History"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"236 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Begins at Sumer) has characterized as \"the first wa r of nerves.\" Lauding his king and his powers, the emissary quote d verbatim Enmerkar's threats to bring desolation upon Aratta and dispersion upon its people. The ruler of Aratta, however, coun tered this war of nerves with a ploy of his own. Reminding the emi ssary of the confusion of languages in the aftermath of the Towe r of Babel inci- dent, he claimed he could not understand the messag e given him in Sumerian. In frustration Enmerkar sent another message writte n on clay tablets—this time, it appears, in the language of A ratta—a feat made possible with the help of Nidaba, the Goddess of Writing. In addition to threats an offering of the seeds of \"th e olden grain\" that had been kept in Anu's temple was made—a seed, it appears, needed badly in Aratta because a long drought had d estroyed its crops. The drought was deemed to have been a sign t hat it was Inanna herself who wished Aratta to come \"under the protecting shade of Erech.\" \"The lord of Aratta from the herald took the baked tablet; the lord of Aratta examined the clay.\" The writing was in cuneiform script: \"The dictated word was nail-like in appeara nce.\" Was he to yield or resist? Just at that moment \"a storm, l ike a great lion attacking, stepped up\"; the drought was suddenly br oken by a thunderstorm that made the whole land tremble, the mountains quake; and once again, \"white-walled Aratta\" became a land of abundant grains. There was no need to yield to Erech; and the lord o f Aratta said to the herald: \"Inanna, the queen of the lands , has not abandoned her House in Aratta; she has not handed o ver Aratta to Erech.\" In spite of the rejoicing in Aratta, its expectatio n that Inanna would not abandon her abode there was not entirely fulfilled. Enticed by the prospect of residing in a grand temp le at Sumer's City of Anu, she became a commuting goddess: a \"wor king de- ity,\" so to speak, in faraway Aratta, but a residen t in metropol- itan Erech. She did her commuting by flying from place to place in her \"Boat of Heaven.\" Her flying about gave rise to many depi ctions of her as an aeronaut (Fig. 75), and the inference from some texts is that she did her own piloting. On the other hand, like other maj or deities, she was"},{"pageNumber":240,"pageContent":"\"A Queen Am I!\" 237 assigned a pilot-navigator for the more demanding f lights. As the Vedas, which spoke of pilots of the gods (one, Push an. \"guided Indra through the speckled clouds\" in the \"golden ship th at travels in the air's mid-region\"), so did the earlier Sumerian tex ts refer to the AB.GALs, who ferried the gods across the heavens. I nanna's pilot- navigator, we are told, was Nungal; and he was spec ifically named in regard to her transfer to the House of Anu in Erech : Fig. 75 At the time when Enmerkar in Uruk ruled, Nungal, the lion-hearted, was the Pilot who from the skies brought Ishtar down to the E-Anna. According to the Sumerian King Lists, kingship afte r the Deluge began at Kish. Then, \"the Kingship to the Eanna was carried.\" As archaeologists have confirmed, Erech indeed had its beginnings as a temple city, consisting of the sacred precinct wh ere Anu's first modest shrine (\"White Temple\") was built atop a rai sed platform (Fig. 76); the site remained in the city's heart ev en as Erech grew and its temples were aggrandized, as the remains of the city and its walls indicate (Fig. 77).

Erech was still a \"provincial\" town, lacking the stature of other Sumerian cities, which had the dis tinction of hav- ing been rebuilt on the sites of pre-Diluvial citie s. It lacked the sta- tus and benefits that stemmed from the possession o f the \"Divine MEs.\" Though they are constantly referred to, the n ature of the ME is not clear, and scholars translate the term as \"divine com- mandments,\" \"divine powers,\" or even \"mythic virtue s.\" The ME, however, are described as physical objects that one could pick up and carry, or even put on, and which contained s ecret knowl- edge or data. Perhaps they were something like our present-day computer chips, on which data, programs, and operat ional orders have been minutely recorded. On them the essentials of civilization were encoded. These MEs were in the possession of Enki, the chief scientist of the Anunnaki. They were released by him to benefit mankind grad- ually, step by step; and the turn of Erech to attai n the heights of civilization had, apparently, not yet come when Ina nna became its resident deity. Impatient, Inanna decided to use he r feminine charms to improve the situation."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"240 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN A text titled by S. N. Kramer (Sumerian Mythology) as \"Inanna and Enki.\" but whose original (and more poe tic) Su- merian title is unknown, describes how Inanna journ eyed in her \"Boat of Heaven\" to the Abzu, where Enki had secret ed away the MEs. Realizing that Inanna was coming to call o n him by herself—\"the maiden, all alone, has directed her st ep to the Abzu\"—Enki ordered his chamberlain to prepare a sum ptuous meal, including plenty of date wine. After Inanna a nd Enki had feasted and Enki's heart became happy with drink, I nanna brought up the subject of the MEs. Gracious with dr ink, Enki presented to her ME for \"Lordship .... Godship. the Exalted and Enduring Tiara, the Throne of Kingship.\" and \"b right Inanna took them.\" As Inanna worked her charms on h er aging host, Enki made to her a second presentation of \"th e Exalted Scepter and Staff, the Exalted Shrine, Righteous Ru - lership\"; and \"bright Inanna took them,\" too. As the feasting and drinking went on, Enki parted w ith seven major MEs, embracing the functions and attributes o f a Divine Lady, her temple and rituals, its priests, eunuchs, and prostitutes; warfare and weapons; justice and courts; music and arts; masonry; woodworking and metal working; leatherwork and weav ing; scribeship and mathematics; and so on. With the encoded data for all these attributes of a high civiliza- tion in her hands, Inanna slipped away and took off in her Boat of Heaven, back to Erech. Hours later a sobered Enki r ealized that Inanna and the MEs were gone. His somewhat embarras sed cham- berlain reminded Enki that he, Enki himself, had ma de the MEs a present to Inanna. Greatly upset. Enki ordered his chamberlain to pursue Inanna in Enki's \"Great Heavenly Skychamber\" and re- trieve the MEs. Overtaking Inanna at the first stop ping point, the chamberlain explained to Inanna his orders; but Ina nna, asking, \"Why had Enki changed his word to me?\" refused. Rep orting the situation to Enki, the chamberlain was ordered to seize Inanna's Boat of Heaven, bring the Boat to Eridu, a nd release Inanna, but without the MEs. But in Eridu, Inanna o rdered her trusted pilot to \"save the Boat of Heaven and the M Es pre- sented to Inanna.\" And so, while Inanna kept the ar gument with Enki's chamberlain going, her pilot slipped aw ay in her boat with the invaluable MEs.

The people of Erech had every reason to be thankful to Inanna. for under her deityship, Erech had become an afflue nt center of Su- merian civilization. In praising her wisdom and val or, the people of Erech failed not also to mention her beauty and attractiveness. Indeed, it was at about that time that Inanna insti tuted the custom of the \"Sacred Marriage,\" sexual rites whereby the priest-king was supposed to have become her spouse—but only for a night. A text, attributed to a king named Iddin-Dagan, descr ibed this aspect of Inanna's temple life—with music, male prostitute entertainers, and all: The male-prostitutes comb her hair . . .

Of Lugalbanda, too, as of Enmerkar, several epic ta les have been found. Inanna, it seems, wanted him to reside in he r stead in Aratta; but Lugalbanda was too restless and adventu rous to stay put. One epic tale (Lugalbanda and Mount Hurum) des cribes his dangerous journey to the \"awesome place on Earth\" i n search of the Divine Black Bird. He reached the Restricted Mo unt \"where the Anunnaki, gods of the mountain, inside the eart h like termites had tunneled.\" Seeking a ride in the Bird of Heaven , Lugalbanda pleaded with its custodian; his words immortalized man's desire to fly: Like Utu let me go, like Inanna, Like the Seven Stormers of Ishkur in a flame let me lift myself off, and thunder away! Let me go wherever my eyes can see, Wherever I desire, let me set my foot, Wherever my heart wishes, let me arrive . . . When he had arrived at Mount Hurum (\"whose front En lil as with a great door had closed off\"), Lugalbanda was challenged by the Guardian: \"If a god you are, a word in friendsh ip will I utter which will let you enter; If a man you are, your fa te will I decree.\" To which:"},{"pageNumber":247,"pageContent":"244 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Lugalbanda, he of beloved seed, stretched his hand out [and said]: \"Like divine Shara am I, the beloved son of Inanna.\" But the Guardian of the sacred place turned Lugalba nda down with an oracle: indeed, he would reach far lands an d make both himself and Erech famous, but he would do so on foo t. Another long epic tale, originally called by schola rs \"Lugalban- da and Enmerkar'' and more recently The Lugalbanda Epic, affirms Lugalbanda's semi-divine descent but does not ident ify his father; we can assume, however, from the circumstances and sub sequent events, that the father was Enmerkar; confirming Enmerkar a s the first one in a long list of rulers who, under the guise of a sym bolic marriage or without it, were invited by Inanna to share her bed . This \"invitation\" by Inanna is featured in the well -known Epic of Gilgamesh. The fifth ruler of Erech, Gilgamesh s ought to escape the mortals' destiny to die because, as a son of th e goddess Ninsun and the high priest of the Kullab, \"two thirds of h im were god.\" In his search for immortality (examined at length in T he Stairway to Heaven), he first journeyed to the \"Landing Place\" in the Cedar Mountain—the olden landing platform in the mountain s of Leba- non (to which, apparently, Lugalbanda had also gone ). Battling the mechanical monster that guarded the restricted area 's perimeter, Gilgamesh and his companion were almost annihilated were it not for Utu's help. Exhausted from the battle, Gilgames h took off his drenched clothes so that he might wash and rest. It was then that Inanna/Ishtar. who watched the struggle from the sk ies, was seized with a craving for Gilgamesh: He washed his grimy hair, polished his weapons; The braid of his hair he shook out against his back . He cast off his soiled things, put on his clean one s. Wrapped a fringed cloak about, fastened with a sash . When Gilgamesh put on his tiara, Glorious Ishtar raised an eye at the beauty of Gilg amesh. \"Come, Gilgamesh. be thou my lover!\" [she said] \"Do grant me of thy fruitfulness; thou shalt be a husband, I shall be a wife.\" She reinforced her invitation with promises of a gl orious (though not everlasting) life if Gilgamesh would accede to her otter.

Which lover didst thou love forever?\" he asked; \"if thou shouldst make love to me, thou w ouldst treat me like them.\" (The offended Inanna thereupon received Anu's per- mission to launch against Gilgamesh the Bull of Hea ven; Gilga- mesh was saved from it at the last moment at the ga tes of Erech). The golden era of Erech was not to last forever. Se ven other kings followed Gilgamesh on its throne. Then, \"Uruk was smitten with weapons: its kingship to Ur was carried.\" Thor kild Jacobsen, whose study The Sumerian King List is the most thor ough on the subject, believes that the transfer of kingship in Sumer from Erech to Ur occurred circa 2850 B.C.; others adopt a lowe r date of circa 2650 B.C. (Such a discrepancy of two centuries has persisted into later times and remains unexplained by scholars.) The reigns of the various rulers were getting short er and shorter as the site of kingship swung back and forth among Sumer's princi- pal cities: from Ur to Awan, then back to Kish; to a city named Hamazi, then back to Erech and Ur; to Adab and Mari , and back to Kish; to Aksak and again to Kish; and finally once more to Erech. In the course of no more than 220 years, there were thus three addi- tional dynasties at Kish, three at Erech, two at Ur , and single ones in five other cities. It was, by all appearances, a volatile period; it was also a time of increasing friction between the cities, mostly over water rights and irrigation canals—phenomena t hat can be ex- plained by drier weather on the one hand and rising populations on the other. In each instance the town that lost out was said to have been \"smitten with weapons.\" Mankind had begun to w age its own wars! The resort to arms to settle local disputes was bec oming more commonplace. Inscriptions from those days indicate that the ha- rassed populace was competing, through offerings an d enhanced worship, for the favors of the gods; the warring ci ty-states increas- ingly involved their patron-gods in their petty dis putes. In one re- corded instance Ninurta was involved in determining whether an irrigation ditch encroached on another city's bound aries, Enlil, too, was forced to order the warring parties to dis engage. This con- stant strife and lack of stability soon reached a p oint when the gods"},{"pageNumber":249,"pageContent":"246 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN had had enough. Once before, when the Deluge was co ming, Enlil was so disgusted with mankind that he schemed its o bliteration by the great flood. Then, in the Tower of Babel incide nt, he ordered mankind's dispersion and the confusion of its langu ages. Now, again, he was growing disgusted. The historical background to the events that follow ed was the final attempt by the gods to reestablish Kish, the original capital, as the center of kingship. For the fourth time they re turned kingship to Kish. starting the dynasty with rulers whose names indicate fealty to Sin, Ishtar. and Shamash. Two rulers, however, b ore names in- dicating that they were followers of Ninurta and hi s spouse- evidence of a revived rivalry between the House of Sin and the House of Ninurta. It resulted in the seating on the throne of a nonentity—\"Nannia. a stone cutter\"; he reigned a br ief seven years. In such unsettled circumstances Inanna was able to retrieve the kingship for Erech. The man chosen for the task, on e Lugal-zagesi, retained the favor of the gods for twenty-live year s; but then, attacking Kish to assure her permanent desolation, he only ma naged to raise En- lil's ire; and the idea of a strong hand at the hel m of human kingship made more and more sense. There was a need for some one unin- volved in all these disputes, someone who would pro vide firm leader- ship and once again properly perform the role of th e king as sole intermediary between the gods and the people in all matters mundane. It was Inanna who. on one of her flying trips, foun d that man. Her encounter with him, circa 2400 B.C., launched a new era. He was a man who began his career as a cup-bearer t o the king of Kish. When he took over the state reins in central Mesopotamia, he quickly extended his rule to all of Sumer. to its n eighboring coun- tries, and even unto distant lands. The epithet-nam e of this first empire-builder was Sharru-Kin (\"Righteous Ruler\"); modern textbooks call him Sargon I or Sargon the Great (Fi g. 80). He built himself a brand-new capital not far from Babylon an d named it Agade (\"United\"); we know it as Akkad—a name from w hich stems the term Akkadian for the first Semitic langu age. A text known as The Legend of Sargon records, in Sa rgon's own words, his odd personal history: Sargon. the mighty king of Agade. am I. My mother was a high priestess; I knew not my fathe r . . .

This Moses-like tale (written more than a thousand years before the time of Moses!) then continues to answer the ob vious question: How could a man of unknown fatherhood, a mere garde ner, be- come a mighty king? Sargon answered the questions t hus: While I was a gardener, Ishtar granted me her love. And for four and fifty years I exercised Kingship; The Black-headed people I ruled and governed.

Inanna—by then awakened, we must assume—found in Sa rgon a man to her liking, a man who could satisfy not only her bedtime cravings but also her political ambitions. A text k nown as the Sar- gon Chronicle states that \"Sharru-Kin, king of Agad e, rose [to power] in the era of Ishtar. He had neither rival n or opponent. He spread his terror-inspiring glamor over all the cou ntries. He crossed the sea in the east; he conquered the count ry of the west, in its full extent.\" The enigmatic reference to the \"'Era of Ishtar\" has baffled the scholars: but it can only mean what it says: at tha t time, for what- ever reasons. Inanna/Ishtar was able to have a man of her choice take the throne and create for her an empire: \"He d efeated Uruk and tore down its wall. ... He was victorious in th e battle with the inhabitants of Ur . . . he defeated the entire territory from La- gash as far as the sea. ...\" There were also the co nquests be- yond the olden boundaries of Sumer: \"Mari and Elam are standing in obedience before Sargon.\" The grandeur of Sargon and the greatness of Inanna. going hand in hand, were expressed in the construction of the new capital city of Agade and in it the UL.MASH (\"Glittering, Luxuri ous\") tem- ple to Inanna. \"In those days,\" a Sumerian historio graphy text relates, \"the dwellings of Agade were filled with g old; its bright- shining houses were filled with silver. Into its st orehouses were brought copper, lead and slabs of lapis-lazuli; its granaries bulged at the sides. Its old men were endowed with wisdom, its old women were endowed with eloquence; its young men we re en- dowed with the Strength-of-Weapons, its little chil dren were en- dowed with joyous hearts. . . . The city was full o f music.\" In that beautiful and happy city, \"in Agade did hol y Inanna erect a temple as her noble abode; in the Ulmash she set up a throne.\" It was the crowning temple in a series of shrines to h er that encom- passed Sumer's principal cities. Stating that \"in E rech, the E-Anna"},{"pageNumber":252,"pageContent":"\"A Queen Am I!\" 249 is mine,\" Inanna listed her shrines in Nippur, Ur, Girsu, Adab, Kish, Der, Akshak, and Umma, and lastly the Ulmash in Agade. \"Is there a god who can vie with me?\" she asked. Yet, though promoted by Inanna, the elevation of Sa rgon to kingship over what was henceforth known as Sumer an d Akkad could not have taken place without the consent and blessing of Anu and Enlil. A bilingual (Sumerian-Akkadian) text, or iginally in- scribed on a statue of Sargon that was placed befor e Enlil in his temple in Nippur, stated that Sargon was not only \" Commanding Overseer\" of Ishtar, but also \"anointed priest of A nu\" and \"great regent of Enlil.\" It was Enlil, Sargon wrote, who \" had given him lordship and kingship.\" Sargon's records of his conquests describe Inanna a s actively present on the battlefields but attribute to Enlil the overall decision regarding the scope of the victories and the extent of the territories: \"Enlil did not let anybody oppose Sargon, the king of the land; from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea Enlil gave unto him.\" Invari- ably, postscripts to Sargon's inscriptions invoked Anu, Enlil. Inanna, and Utu/Shamash as his \"witnesses.\" As one scrutinizes this vast empire, stretching fro m the Upper Sea (Mediterranean) to the Lower Sea (Persian Gulf) , it becomes clear that Sargon's conquests were, at first, limit ed to the domains of Sin and his children (Inanna and Utu) and, even at their peak, kept well within the Enlilite territories. Sargon r eached Lagash. the city of Ninurta. and conquered the territory from L agash south- ward, but not Lagash itself; nor did he expand to t he northeast of Sumer where Ninurta held sway. Going beyond the bou ndaries of olden Sumer, he entered to the southeast the land o f Elam—an area under Inanna's influence from earlier times. But wh en Sargon was entering the lands to the west on the mid-Euphrates and the Medi- terranean coast, the domains of Adad, \"Sargon prost rated himself in prayer before the god . . . |and| he gave him in the upper region Mari, Yarmuli and Ebla, as far as the cedar forest and the silver mountain.\" It is clear from Sargon's inscriptions that he was neither given Tilmun (the gods' own Fourth Region), nor Magan (Eg ypt), nor Meluhha (Ethiopia) in the Second Region, the domain s of Enki's descendants; with those lands he only conducted pea ceful trading relations. In Sumer itself he kept out of the area controlled by Ninurta and from the city claimed by Marduk.

Faced with the reemergence of her olden adversary, Inanna could simply not give up, no matter what the cost. Seating on Sar- gon's throne first one of his sons and then another , enlisting in her campaigns her vassal kings in the eastern mountainl ands, she fought as an enraged lioness for her disintegrating empire, \"rain- ing flame over the land . . . attacking like an agg ressive storm.\" \"You are known by your destruction of the rebel lan ds,\" in- toned a daughter of Sargon in a plaintive poem; \"yo u are known by massacring their people\" . . . turning \"against the city that said not 'the land is yours,' \" making \"its rivers run w ith blood.\" For more than two years Inanna wrought havoc all ar ound, until the gods decided that the only way to stop the carn age was to force Marduk back into exile. Having returned to Babylon when Sargon tried to remove some of its hallowed soil—an act wh ose symbolism was rooted in legendary events—Marduk fortified the city and in particular ingeniously enhanced its underground wat er system, making the city impervious to attack. Unable or unw illing to re- move Marduk by force, the Anunnaki turned to Marduk 's brother Nergal and asked him to \"scare Marduk off the divin e seat\" in Babylon. We know of these events from a text named by schola rs The Erra Epos, for in it Nergal is called by the ancien t chronicler ER.RA—a somewhat derogatory epithet, for it meant \" The Ser- vant of Ra.\" It is a text that could better be call ed The Tale of the 251"},{"pageNumber":255,"pageContent":"252 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Sins of Nerval, for it puts the blame on Nergal for a chain of events with a catastrophic ending; but it is an invaluable source for our knowledge and understanding of that prelude to disa ster.

Arrivi ng in Mesopo- tamia, he first stopped at Erech, \"the city of Anu, the king of all the gods,\" but, of course, also the place to huddle with Inan- na/Ishtar.

If he were forced to leave, Marduk said, \"on the day I step off my seat, the flooding shall from its well cease to work . . . the waters sh all not rise . . . the bright day to darkness [shall turn] . . . confu sion shall arise . . . the winds of draught shall howl . . . sicknes ses shall spread.\" After some more exchanges Erra offered to return to Marduk \"the artifacts of Heaven and Earth\" if Marduk would personally go to the Lower World to pick them up; and as to th e \"works\" in Babylon, he assured Marduk there was nothing to wor ry about: he (Erra) would enter Marduk\"s House only to \"erect th e Bulls of Anu and Enlil at thy gate\"—statues of Winged Bulls as w ere actually found at temple sites—but would do nothing to upset the water- works. Marduk heard this; The promise, given by Erra. found his favor. So did he step down from his seat. and to the Land of Mines, abode of the Anunnaki, he set his direction. Thus persuaded, Marduk agreed to leave Babylon. But no sooner he had done that than Nergal broke his word. Unable to re- sist his curiosity.

Thereupon, as Marduk had war ned, \"the day turned into darkness,\" the \"flooding was disarr ayed,\" and soon \"the lands were laid to waste, the people were made to per- ish.\" All of Mesopotamia was affected, for Ea/Enki, Sin a nd Sha- mash, in their cities, became alarmed; \"with anger [at Erra] they were filled.\" The people made sacrifices to Anu and Ishtar but to no avail: \"the water sources went dry.\" Ea, Erra's father, re- proached him: \"Now that Prince Marduk had stepped o ff, what have you done?\" He ordered that a statue of Erra, w hich had been prepared, should not be set up in the Esagil. \"Go a way!\" he or- dered Erra. \"Take off to where no gods ever go!\" \"Erra lost his voice\" only for a moment, then utter ed words of impudence. Enraged, he smashed Marduk's abode, set fire to its gates. Defiantly, \"he made a sign\" as he turned to leave, announc- ing that his followers, however, would stay behind: \"as to my war- riors, they shall not go back.\" And so it was that when Erra returned to Kutha, the men who had come with him st ayed behind, establishing a long-lasting presence for Nergal in the lands of Shem; a colony was assigned to them not far from Babylon, p erhaps as a per- manent garrison; there were \"Kutheans who worship N ergal\" in Samaria in biblical times; and there was official w orship of Nergal in Elam, as evidenced by an unusual bronze sculpture ( Fig. 82) found there, depicting worshipers with unmistakable Afric an features per- forming a cultic ceremony in a temple courtyard. The departure of Marduk from Babylon brought to an end Ish- tar's conflict with him; the rift between Marduk an d Nergal and the latter's retention of an Asian presence unintention ally created an alliance between Ishtar and Nergal. The chain of tr agic events that no one could have predicted and that no one had per haps even de- sired was thus being forged by fate, leading the An unnaki and Mankind ever closer to the ultimate disaster. . . . With her authority restored, Inanna renewed the kin gship in Agade and put on the throne a grandson of Sargon, N aram-Sin (\"Sin's Favorite\"). Seeing in him, at last, a true successor to Sar- gon, she encouraged him to seek grandeur and greatn ess. After a brief period of peace and prosperity she goaded Nar am-Sin to em- bark on an expansion of the erstwhile empire. Soon Inanna began to encroach on the territories of other gods; but t hey were unable or unwilling to fight her: \"The great Anunnaki gods fl ed before you like fluttering bats,\" a hymn to Inanna stated; \"th ey could not"},{"pageNumber":258,"pageContent":" Fig. 82 stand before your fearsome face . . . could not soo the your angry heart.\" Rock carvings in the annexed territories de picted Inanna as the ruthless conqueror she had become (Fig. 83).

Two sets of texts, one dealing with the goddess and the other with her surrogate, the king Naram-Sin, record the events of those times. Both indicate that the first out-of-bounds t arget of Inanna was the Landing Place in the Cedar Mountain.

Lyi ng astride the strategic Jordan River crossing and opposite the An unnaki strong- hold at Tell Ghassul, Jericho—the city dedicated to Sin—had also rebelled: \"It said not 'It belongs to your father w ho begot you\": it had promised its solemn word, but turned away from it.\" The Old Testament is filled with admonitions against \"stray ing after alien gods\": the Sumerian text conveys the same transgres sion: The people of Jericho, having given a solemn promise to worship Sin, Inanna's father, have switched allegience to anothe r, alien, god. The surrender of this \"city of date-palms\" to an ar med Inanna was depicted on a cylinder seal (Fig. 84).

A Mesopotamian royal chronicle attests that not onl y did Naram-Sin enter the peninsula, but he had gone on t o invade the land of Magan (Egypt): Naram-Sin, offspring of Sargon, marched against the town of Apishal and made a breach in its wall, conquering i t. He person- ally caught Rish-Adad, king of Apishal, and the viz ier of Apishal. He then marched against the country of Magan and pe rsonally caught Mannu-Dannu, king of Magan. The accuracy of the above-mentioned Babylonian roya l chroni- cle has been independently confirmed in its other d etails, so there is no reason to doubt this part of it, too—incredib le as it sounds, for it entailed the passage of a human king and a human army through the Sinai peninsula, the gods' own Fourth Region.

Inanna, it appears, was more than \"just passing through.\" (A foreign invasion, about the time of Naram-Sin, i s also known from Egyptian records. They describe a period of di sarray and chaos. In the words of the papyrus known to Egyptol ogists as The Admonitions of Ipuwer, \"Strangers have come into Eg ypt... the high-born are full of lamentation.\" It was a period that saw the shift of the center of worship and kingship from Me mphis-Heliop- olis in the north to Thebes in the south. Scholars call the century of disarray \"The First Intermediate Period\"; it follow ed the collapse of the sixth Pharaonic dynasty.) How could Inanna, with apparent immunity, intrude o n the Sinai peninsula and invade Egypt unopposed by the gods of Egypt? The answer lies in an aspect of the Naram-Sin inscr iptions that has baffled the scholars: the apparent veneration b y this Mesopota- mian ruler of the African god Nergal. Although this made no sense at all, the fact is that the long text known as The Kuthean Legend of Naram-Sin (or, as it is sometimes called, The King of Kutha Text) attests that Naram-Sin went to Kutha, Nergal's cult center in Af- rica, and erected there a stela to which he affixed an ivory tablet inscribed with the tale of this unusual visit, all to pay homage to Nergal. The recognition by Naram-Sin of Nergal's power and influence well beyond Africa is attested by the fact that in treaties made be- tween Naram-Sin and provincial rulers in Elam, Nerg al is invoked among the witness gods. And in an inscription deali ng with Naram-Sin's march to the Cedar Mountain in Lebanon, the king credited Nergal (rather than Ishkur/Adad) with maki ng the achieve- ment possible: Although since the era of the rulership of man none of the kings has ever destroyed Arman and Ebla , Now did the god Nergal open up the path for the mig hty Naram- Sin. He gave him Annan and Ebla, presented him with the Amanus and with the Cedar Mountain and with the Upper Sea."},{"pageNumber":262,"pageContent":"Prelude to Disaster 259 This puzzling emergence of Nergal as an influential Asian deity, and the audacious march of Inanna's surrogate Naram -Sin to Egypt—all violations of the status quo of the Four Regions estab- lished after the Pyramid Wars—have one explanation: While Mar- duk had shifted his attention to Babylon, Nergal as sumed a preeminent role in Egypt. Then, having gone to pers uade Marduk to leave Mesopotamia without further struggle, the amicable part- ing turned into a bitter enmity between the brother s. And this led to an alliance between Nergal and Inan na; but as they stood for each other, they soon found themselv es opposed by all the other gods. An assembly of the gods was hel d in Nippur to deal with the disruptive consequences of Inanna's e xploits; even Enki agreed that she had gone too far. And a decree for her arrest and trial was issued by Enlil. We learned of these events from a chronicle titled by scholars The Curse of Agade. Deciding that Inanna had indeed gotten out of hand, \"the word of the Ekur\" (Enid's sacred precinct in Nippur) was issued against her. But Inanna did not wait to be seized or held for trial: she forsook her temple an d escaped from Agade: The \"word of Ekur\" was upon Agade like a deathly silence; Agade was all atremble. its Ulmash temple was in terror; She who lived there, left the city.

Seven yea rs Naram-Sin remained in wait.\" Did Inanna seek out Nergal during her seven-year di sappearance from Agade? The text does not give the answer, but we believe that it was the only haven available to Inanna, away fro m Enlil's wrath. The ensuing events suggest that Inanna—even more au dacious than before, more ambitious than ever—must have obtained the backing of at least one other major god; and that could hav e been only Nergal. That Inanna would hide in Nergal's Lower Af rican domain seems thus a most plausible assumption. Did the two, talking over the situation, reviewing past events, discussing the future, end up forging a new allianc e that could rear- range the divine domains? A New Order was indeed fe asible, for Inanna was shattering the Old Divine Order upon the Earth.

This task was as- signed by Inanna to Naram-Sin; his attack on the Ek ur in Nippur and the resulting downfall of Agade are detailed in The Curse of Agade text.

But the hordes that swept down from the mountains upon Akkad were \"the hordes of Enlil,\" and they were in all probabi lity guided into the great Mesopotamian plain by Ninurta. The Sumerian King Lists call the land from which th e invaders came Gutium, a land in the mountains northeast of M esopotamia. In the Legend of Naram-Sin they are called Umman-Ma nda (possi- bly \"Hordes of Far/Strong Brothers\"), who came from \"camps in the dwelling of Enlil\" situated \"in the mountainlan d whose city the gods had built.\" Verses in the text suggest tha t they were descendants of soldiers who had accompanied Enmerka r on his distant travels, who \"slew their host\" and were pun ished by Utu/Shamash to remain in exile.

The confused situation is described in the Sumerian Kin g Lists with the statement: \"Who was king? Who was not king? Was Irg igi king? Was Nanum king? Was Imi king?

No new capital is named for them, and it appears that Lagash—the only Sumerian city to escape despoi ling by the in- vaders—served as their headquarters. From his seat in Lagash Ninurta undertook the slow process of restoring the country's agri- culture and primarily the irrigation system that co llapsed following the Erra/Marduk incident. It was a chapter in Sumer ian history that can best be called the Era of Ninurta. The focal point of that era was Lagash, a city whos e beginnings were as a \"sacred precinct\" (the Girsu) for Ninurta and his Divine Black Bird. But as the turmoil of human and divine ambitions grew, Ninurta decided to convert Lagash into a majo r Sumerian center, the principal abode for himself and his spo use Bau/Guia (Fig. 85), where his ideas of law and order and his ideals of moral- ity and justice could be practiced. To assist in th ese tasks Ninurta appointed in Lagash human viceroys and charged them with the ad- ministration and defense of the city-state."},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"Prelude to Disaster 263 Fig. 85 The history of Lagash (a site nowadays called Tello ) records a dynasty whose reign—uninterrupted for half a mill ennium- began three centuries before the rise of Sargon.

While Sumer's reli- gious holidays emanated from Nippur, Lagash origina ted tradi- tions of festivals tied to an agricultural calendar , such as the Festival of First Fruits. Its scribes and scholars perfected the Sumerian language; and its rulers, to whom Ninurta granted the title \"Righteous Governor,\" were sworn to a code of justice and morality.

As \"Enid's Foremost Warrior,\" Ninurt a made sure that those selected by him to govern Lagash should be militarily proficient. One (named Eannatum) whose inscriptions and stelae have been found, was a master tactician and victori ous general. The stelae show him riding a war chariot—a military vehicle whose introduction has been customarily attributed to lat er times; they also show his helmeted troops in tight formations ( Fig. 87). Commenting on this, Maurice Lambert (La Periode Pre -Sar- gonique) wrote that \"this infantry of spearmen, pro tected by shield- bearers, gave the army of Lagash a defence most sol id and an attack most rapid and versatile.\" The resulting victories of Eannatum even impressed Inanna/Ishtar, so much so that she had fa llen in love with him; and \"because she loved Eannatum, kingship over Kish she gave him. in addition to the governorship of Lagash.\" Wi th this Eannatum became the LU.GAL (\"Great Man\") of Sumer; and holdi ng the land in a military grip, he made law and order prevail."},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":" Fig. 87 Ironically the chaotic period that had preceded Sar gon of Agade found in Lagash not a strong military leader but a social reformer named Urukagina.

When the Gutians left Mesopotamia—circa 2160 B.C.—L agash burst into new bloom and produced some of Sumer's m ost enlight- ened and best-known rulers. Of these, one of the be st-known from his long inscriptions and many statues was Gudea, w ho reigned during the twenty-second century B . C . His was a time of peace and prosperity; his records speak not of armies and war s but of trade and reconstruction. He crowned his activities with the building of a new, magnificent temple for Ninurta in a vastly enl arged Girsu. According to Gudea's inscriptions, \"the Lord of Gir su\" appeared unto him in a vision, standing beside his Divine Bl ack Bird. The god expressed to him the wish that a new E.NINNU (\" House of Fifty\"—Ninurta's numerical rank) be built by Gudea. Gudea was given two sets of divine instructions: one from a g oddess who in one hand \"held the tablet of the favorable star of heavens\" and with the other \"held a holy stylus,\" with which she indicated to Gudea \"the favorable planet\" in whose direction the temple should be oriented. The other set of instructions c ame from a god whom Gudea did not recognize and who turned out to have been Ningishzidda. He handed to Gudea a tablet made of p recious stone; \"the plan of a temple it contained.\" One of Gudea's statues depicts him seated with this tablet on his knees, t he divine stylus beside it (Fig. 88). Gudea admits that he needed the help of diviners an d \"searchers of secrets\" to understand the temple plan. It was, as modern re- searchers have found, an ingenious one-in-seven arc hitectural plan for the construction of a ziggurat as a seven-stage pyramid. The structure contained a strongly reinforced platform for the landing of Ninurta's airborne vehicle. The participation of Ningishzidda in the planning o f the E- Ninnu carried a significance that went beyond mere architectural assistance, as evidenced by the fact that the Girsu included a spe- cial shrine for this god.

Ninurta, it will be recalled, had carried off with him some of the \"stones\" from within the Great Pyramid when the Pyr amid Wars ended. Now, with the thwarted efforts of Inanna and then Marduk to lord over gods and men, Ninurta wished to reaffi rm his \"Rank of Fifty\" by the erection of a step-pyramid for him self at Lagash, an edifice to be known as the \"House of Fifty.\" It was for that rea- son, we believe, that Ninurta invited Ningishzidda/ Thoth to come to Mesopotamia, to design for him a pyramid that co uld be built and raised high, not with massive stone blocks as i n Egypt, but with the humble clay bricks of Mesopotamia."},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"268 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN The stay of Ningishzidda in Sumer and his collabora tion there with Ninurta were commemorated not only in shrines to that visit- ing god, but also in numerous artistic depictions, some of which were discovered during the sixty years of archaeolo gical work at Tello. One of these (Fig. 89a) combined the emblem of Ninurta's Divine Bird with the serpents of Ningishzidda; anot her (Fig. 89b) depicted Ninurta as an Egyptian Sphinx.

The Era of Ninurta in Sumer, lasting through the Gu tian inva- sion and the ensuing period of reconstruction, was only an inter- lude. A mountain dweller at heart, Ninurta soon beg an to roam the skies again in his Divine Black Bird, visiting his rugged domains in the northeast and even farther away. Constantly per fecting the martial arts of his highland tribesmen, he gave the m mobility through the introduction of cavalry, thereby extend ing their reach by hundreds and even thousands of miles. He had returned to Mesopotamia at Enlil's call, to put an end to the sacrilege perpetrated by Naram-Sin and to the u pheavals caused by Inanna. With peace and prosperity restored, Ninu rta again ab- sented himself from Sumer; and, never one to give u p, Inanna seized upon this absence to regain the kingship for Erech. The attempt lasted only a few years, for Anu and En lil did not condone her deed. But the tale (contained in an eni gmatic text on a partly broken tablet catalogued as Ashur-13955) is most fascinat- ing; it reads like an ancient legend of the Excalib ur (King Arthur's magical sword, which was imbedded in a rock and cou ld be pulled out only by the one who was chosen for kingship); a nd it throws light on preceding events, including the incident b y which Sargon had offended Marduk. We learn that when \"Kingship was lowered from Heave n\" to begin at Kish, Anu and Enlil established there a \"P avilion of Heaven.\" \"In its foundation soil, for all days to c ome,\" they implanted the SHU.HA.DA.KU—an artifact made of allo yed metal whose name translates literally \"Supreme Stro ng Bright Weap- on.\" This divine object was taken to Erech when kin gship was transferred there from Kish; it was moved about as kingship moved about but only when the change was decreed by the G reat Gods. In accordance with this custom, Sargon carried the object to Agade. But Marduk protested, because Agade was a br and-new city and not one of the cities selected by \"the gre at gods of Heaven and Earth\" to be royal capitals. The gods who chose Agade— Inanna and her supporters—were in Marduk's opinion \"rebels, gods who wear unclean clothing.\" It was to cure this defect that Sargon went to Baby lon to the spot where its \"hallowed soil\" was located. The idea was to remove some of that soil \"to a place in front of Agade,\" t here to implant the Divine Weapon and thus legitimize its presence in Agade.

It was a city whose white houses—many of them multistoried (Fig. 93)—sh ined as a pearl from a distance; whose streets were straight and wide, with many a shrine at their intersections: a city of an industrious people with a smooth-functioning administration; a city of pious people, never failing to pray to their benevolent deities.

The nearly three centuries that had passed s ince the moral re- vival under Urukagina of Lagash witnessed the rise and fall of Akkad, the defying of the authority of Anu, and the defilement of Enlil's Ekur. Injustice, oppression, and immorality had become the common behavior. At Ur, under Ur-Nammu. an atte mpt was launched once again by Enlil to steer mankind away from \"evil ways\" to a course of \"righteousness.\" Proclaiming a new code of justice and social behavior. Ur-Nammu \"established equity in the land, banished malediction, ended violence and stri fe.\" Expecting so much from this New Beginning, Enlil—fo r the first time—entrusted the guardianship of Nippur to Nannar and gave Ur-Nammu the necessary instructions for the restora tion of the Ekur (which was damaged by Naram-Sin).

As soon as he ascended the throne, he em barked on the building (or rebuilding) of a temple for Ninurta in Nippur; this en- abled him to declare Ur and Nippur to be \"Brother-C ities.\" He then built a ship—naming it after Ninlil—and sailed to the \"Land of Flying for Life.\" His poems indicate that he ima gined himself a second Gilgamesh, following in that earlier king's footsteps to the \"Land of Living\"—to the Sinai peninsula.

We quote Shulg i's own words: With valiant Utu, a friend as a brother, I drank strong drink in the temple founded by Anu. My minstrels sang for me the seven songs of love. Inanna, the queen, the vulva of heaven and earth, was by my side, banqueting in the temple. As the unavoidable restiveness at home and abroad g rew, Shulgi sought military support from the southeastern provi nce of Elam. Arranging for his daughter to marry Elam's viceroy, Shulgi gave him as dowry the city of Larsa. In return the vicer oy brought into Sumer Elamite troops, to serve Shulgi as a Foreign Legion. But in- stead of peace the Elamite troops brought more warf are, and the yearly records of Shulgi's reign speak of repeated destruction in the northern provinces. Shulgi attempted to retain his hold on the west- ern provinces by peaceful means, and his thirty-sev enth year of reign records a treaty with a local king named Puzu r-Ish-Dagan—a name with clear Canaanite/Philistine connotations. The treaty en- abled Shulgi to reclaim the title \"King of the Four Regions.\" But the peace in the west did not last long. In his for ty-first year (2055 B . C .) Shulgi received certain oracles from Nannar/Sin, an d a major military expedition was launched against the Canaan ite provinces. Within two years Shulgi could claim once more that he was \"Hero, King of Ur, Ruler of the Four Regions.\" The evidence suggests that Elamite troops were used in this campaign to subdue the provinces and that these for eign troops had advanced as far as the gateway to the Sinai.

Instead we find that Amar-Sin turned his at tention to Eridu—Enki's city!—establishing there a royal resid ence and as- suming there priestly functions. This twist in reli gious filialtics might have been prompted by the practical desire to gain control of Eridu's shipyards; for in the following (ninth) yea r, Amar-Sin set sail to the same \"Place of the Ramp\" where Shulgi h ad gone. But reaching the \"Land of Flying for Life\" he got no fa rther: he died of a scorpion's (or snake's) bite. He was replaced on the throne by his brother Shu-Si n.

Thus begins the biblical tale, in chapter 14 of Gen esis, of an an- cient war that pitted an alliance of four kingdoms of the East against five kings in Canaan. It is a tale that has evoked some of the most intense debate among scholars, for it connects the story of Abraham, the first Hebrew Patriarch, with a specifi c non-Hebrew event, and thus affords objective substantiation of the biblical rec- ord of the birth of a nation. How wonderful it would have been, many have felt, i f the vari- ous kings could be identified and the exact time of Abraham estab- lished! But even if Elam was known and Shin'ar iden tified as Sumer, who were the kings named, and which were the other lands of the East?

The discovery was announced in a lecture by Theophi lus Pinches to the Victoria Institute, London, in 1897. Having exam- ined several tablets belonging to the Spartoli Coll ection in the Brit- ish Museum, he found that they described a war of w ide-ranging magnitude, in which a king of Elam, named Kudur-lag hamar, led an alliance of rulers that included one called Eri- aku and another named Tud-ghula—names that easily could have been t ransformed into Hebrew as Khedor-la'omer, Ariokh. and Tidhal. Accompa- nying his published lecture with a painstaking tran script of the cuneiform writing and a translation thereof. Pinche s could confi- dently claim that the biblical tale had indeed been supported by an independent Mesopotamian source. With justified excitement the Assyriologists of tha t time agreed with Pinches's reading of the cuneiform names. The tablets indeed spoke of \"Kudur-Laghamar, king of the land of Elam\" —uncan- nily similar to the biblical \"Khedorla'omer, king o f Elam\"; all scholars agreed that it was a perfect Elamite royal name, the prefix Kudur (\"Servant\") having been a component in the na mes of sev- eral Elamite kings, and Laghamar being the Elamite epithet-name for a certain deity. It was agreed that the second name, spelled Eri- e-a-ku in the Babylonian cuneiform script, stood fo r the original Sumerian ERI.AKU, meaning \"Servant of the god Aku,\" Aku being a variant of the name of Nannar/Sin. It is kn own from a num- ber of inscriptions that Elamite rulers of Larsa bo re the name \"Ser- vant of Sin,\" and there was therefore little diffic ulty in agreeing that the biblical Ellasar, the royal city of the ki ng Ariokh, was in fact Larsa. There was also unanimous agreement amon g the schol- ars for accepting that the Babylonian text's Tud-gh ula was the equivalent of the biblical \"Tidhal, king of Go'im\"; and they agreed that by Go'im the Book of Genesis referred t o the \"nation- hordes\" whom the cuneiform tablets listed as allies of Khedorla'omer. Here, then, was the missing proof—not only of the v eracity of the Bible and of the existence of Abraham, but also of an interna- tional event in which he had been involved! But the excitement was not to last. \"Unfortunately\" —to use an expression of A. H. Sayce in an address to the Soci ety of Biblical Archaeology eleven years later—a contemporary disco very, which should have upheld the one announced by Pinches, en ded up side- tracking and even discrediting it."},{"pageNumber":286,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 283 The second discovery was announced by Vincent Schei l. who reported that he had found among the tablets in the Imperial Otto- man Museum in Constantinople a letter from the well -known Babylonian king Hammurabi, which mentions the very same Kudur-laghamar! Because the letter was addressed to a king of Larsa, Father Scheil concluded that the three were contemporaries and thus matched three of the four biblical kings o f the East—Ham- murabi being none other than \"Amraphel. king of Shi n'ar.\" For a while it seemed that all the pieces of the pu zzle had fallen into place: one can still find textbooks and biblic al commentaries explaining that Amraphel stands for Hammurabi. The resulting conclusion that Abraham was a contemporary of this ruler seemed plausible, because it was then believed that Hammur abi reigned from 2067 to 2025 B.C., placing Abraham, the war of the kings, and the ensuing destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah a t the end of the third millennium B.C. However, when subsequent research convinced most sc holars that Hammurabi reigned much later (from 1792 to 175 0 B.C., ac- cording to The Cambridge Ancient History), the sync hronization seemingly achieved by Scheil fell apart, and the wh ole bearing of the discovered inscriptions—even those reported by Pinches- came into doubt. Ignored were the pleas of Pinches that no matter with whom the three named kings were to be identifi ed—that even if Khedorla'omer, Ariokh, and Tidhal of the cuneifo rm texts were not contemporaries of Hammurabi—the text's tale wit h its three names was still \"a remarkable historical coincidenc e, and deserves recognition as such.\" In 1917, Alfred Jeremias (Die sogenanten Kedorlaomer-Texte) attempted to revive interest in the subject; but the scholarly community preferred to treat the Spar toli tablets with benign neglect. They remained ignored in the basement of the Britis h Museum for half a century, when M. C. Astour returned to t he subject in a study at Brandeis University (Political and Cosmic Symbolism in Genesis 14). Agreeing that the biblical and Babylon ian editors of the respective texts drew from some older, common M esopotamian source, he identified the four Kings of the East as known rulers: 1) of Babylon in the eighth century B.C.; 2) of Assyria i n the thirteenth cen- tury B . C : 3) of the Hittites in the sixteenth century B.C.; a nd 4) of Elam in the twelfth century B . C A S none were contemporaries of each other or of Abraham, he ingeniously suggested that the text was not a historical one but a work of religious philosophy, wherein the author used four diverse historic incidents to illustrate one moral (the fate of"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"284 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN evil kings). The improbability of Astour's suggesti on was soon pointed out in other scholarly publications; and wi th that, the interest in the Khedorla 'omer Texts died again. Yet the scholarly consensus that the biblical tale and the Babylonian texts drew on a much earlier, common source impels us to revive the plea of Pinches and his central argument: How can c uneiform texts, affirming the biblical background of a major war an d naming three of the biblical kings, be ignored? Should the evidence —crucial, as we shall show, to the understanding of fateful years—b e discarded simply because Amraphel was not Hammurabi? The answer is that the Hammurabi letter found by Sc heil should not have sidetracked the discovery reported by Pinc hes, because Scheil misread the letter. According to his renditi on, Hammurabi promised a reward to Sin-Idinna, the king of Larsa, for his \"hero- ism on the day of Khedorla'omer.\" This implied that the two were allies in a war against Khedorla'omer and thus cont emporaries of that king of Elam. It was on this point that Scheil 's find was dis- credited, for it contradicted both the biblical ass ertion that the three kings were allies and known historical facts: Hammu rabi treated Larsa not as an ally but as an adversary, boasting that he \"over- threw Larsa in battle,\" and attacked its sacred pre cinct \"with the mighty weapon which the gods had given him.\" A close examination of the actual text of Hammurabi 's letter re- veals that in his eagerness to prove the Hammurabi- Amraphel identification. Father Scheil reversed the letter's meaning: Ham- murabi was not offering as a reward to return certa in goddesses to the sacred precinct (the Emutbal) of Larsa; rather, he was demand- ing their return to Babylon from Larsa: To Sin-Idinna speaks thus Hammurabi regarding the goddesses who in Emutbal have been behind doors from the days of Kudur-Laghamar, in sackcloth attired: When they ask them back from thee, to my men hand them over; The men shall grasp the hands of the goddesses; To their abode they shall bring them. The incident of the abduction of the goddesses had thus occurred in earlier times; they were held captive in the Emu tbal \"from the"},{"pageNumber":288,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 285 days of Khedorla'omer\"; and Hammurabi was now deman ding their return to Babylon, from where Khedorla'omer h ad taken them captive. This can only mean that Khedorla'omer's da ys were long before Hammurabi's lime. Supporting our reading of the Hammurabi letter foun d by Father Scheil in the Constantinople Museum is the fact tha t Hammurabi repeated the demand for the return of the goddesses to Babylon in yet another stiff message to Sin-Idinna. this time sending it by the hand of high military officers. This second letter is in the British Museum (No. 23,131) and its text was published by L . W. King in The Letters and Inscriptions of Hammurabi: Unto Sin-Idinna thus sayeth Hammurabi: I am now despatching Zikir-ilishu, the Transport Of ficer. and Hammurabi-bani, the Frontline Officer, that they may bring the goddesses who are in Emutba l. That the goddesses were to be returned from Larsa t o Babylon is made clear in the letter's further instructions: Thou shall cause the goddesses to journey in a processional boat as in a shrine, that they may come to Babylon. The temple-women shall accompany them. For food of the goddesses thou shalt load pure cream and cereals unto the boat; sheep and provisions thou shalt put on board for the sustenance of the temple-women. [enough] for the journey to reach Babylon. And thou shalt appoint men to tow the boat, and chosen soldiers to bring the goddesses to Babylon in safety. Delay them not: let them speedily reach Babylon. It is thus clear from these letters that Hammurabi— a foe, not an ally, of Larsa—was seeking restitution for events t hat had hap- pened long before his time, in the days of Kudur-La ghamar, the Elamite regent of Larsa. The texts of the Hammurabi letters thus affirm the existence of Khedorla'omer and of Elamit e reign in Larsa (\"Ellasar\"), and thus of key elements in the biblical tale. Which is the period into which these key elements f it?

These troops were employed by Shulgi to subdue the western provinces, including C anaan. It is thus in the last years of Shulgi's reign and when U r was still an im- perial capital under his immediate successor Amar-S in that we find the historical time slot into which all the biblica l and Mesopota- mian records seem to fit perfectly. It is in that time, we believe, that the search for the historical Abraham should be conducted; for—as we shall show—t he tale of Abraham was interwoven with the tale of the fall of Ur, and his days were the last days of Sumer. With the discrediting of the Amraphel-Hammurabi not ion, the verification of the Age of Abraham became a free-fo r-all, some suggesting such late dates that made the first patr iarch a descendant of the later kings of Israel. . . . But the exact d ates of his time and events need no guessing: the information is provide d by the Bible itself; all we have to do is accept its veracity. The chronological calculations are surprisingly sim ple. Our starting point is 963 B.C., the year in which Solom on is believed to have assumed the kingship in Jerusalem. The Book of Kings states unequivocally that Solomon began the construction o f the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem in the fourth year of his re ign, completing it late in the eleventh year. I Kings 6:1 also stat es that \"It came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year after t he Children of Is- rael were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fou rth year of Solo- mon's reign over Israel . . . that he began to buil d the House of Yahweh.\" This statement is supported (with a slight difference) by the priestly tradition that there had been twelve p riestly genera- tions, of forty years each, from the Exodus to the time when Azariah \"executed the priestly office in the temple that Solomon built in Jerusalem\" (I Chronicles 5:36). Both sources agree on the passage of 480 years, wit h this differ- ence: one counts from the start of the temple's con struction (960 B.C.) and the other from its completion (in 953 B . C ), when the priestly services could begin. This would set the I sraelite Exodus from Egypt in either 1440 or 1433 B.C.; the latter date, we find, of- fers better synchronization with other events. Based on the knowledge amassed by the beginning of this cen- tury, Egyptologists and biblical scholars had by th en reached the"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 287 conclusion that the Exodus had indeed taken place i n the middle of the fifteenth century B.C. But then the weight of s cholarly opinion shifted to a thirteenth-century date because it see med to better fit the archaeological dating of various Canaanite site s, in line with the biblical record of the conquest of Canaan by th e Israelites. Yet such a new dating was not unanimously agreed up on. The most notorious city conquered was Jericho; and one of its promi- nent excavators (K. M. Kenyon) concluded that the p ertinent de- struction occurred circa 1560 B.C.—well ahead of th e biblical events. On the other hand. Jericho's principal exca vator, J. Garstang (The Story of Jericho), held that the arch aeological evi- dence points to its conquest sometime between 1400 and 1385 B . C . Adding to this the forty years of Israelite wanderi ng in the wilderness after the departure from Egypt, he and o thers found ar- chaeological support for an Exodus date sometime be tween 1440 and 1425 B.C.—a time frame that agrees with our sug gestion of 1433 B . C . For more than a century scholars have also searched through the extant Egyptian records for an Egyptian clue to the Exodus and its date. The only apparent references are found in the writings of Manetho. As quoted by Josephus in Against Apion, Ma netho stated that \"after the blasts of God's displeasure broke u pon Egypt,\" a Pharaoh named Toumosis negotiated with the Shepherd People, \"the people from the east, to evacuate Egypt and go whither they would, unmolested.\" They then left and traversed th e wilderness, \"and built a city in a country now called Judaea . . . and gave it the name Jerusalem.\" Did Josephus adjust the writings of Manetho to suit the biblical tale, or did, in fact, the events concerning the so journ, harsh treat- ment, and eventual Exodus of the Israelites occur i n the reign of one of the well-known Pharaohs named Thothmes? Manetho referred to \"the king who expelled the past oral people from Egypt\" in a section devoted to the Pharaohs of the eighteenth dynasty. Egyptologists now accept as historical fac t the expulsion of the Hyksos (the Asiatic \"Shepherd Kings\") in 156 7 B . C . by the founder of the eighteenth dynasty, the Pharaoh Ahmo sis (Amosis in Greek). This new dynasty, which established the New Kingdom in Egypt, might well have been the new dynasty of P haraohs \"who knew not Joseph\" of which the Bible speaks (Exodus 1:8). Theophilus, second-century Bishop of Antioch, also referred in his writings to Manetho and stated that the Hebrews were enslaved by the king Tethmosis, for whom they \"built strong cities, Peitho"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"288 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN and Rameses and On, which is Heliopolis\"; then they departed Egypt under the Pharaoh \"whose name was Amasis.\" It thus appears from these ancient sources that the Israelites' troubles began under a Pharaoh named Thothmes and c ulminated with their departure under a successor named Amasis . What are the historical facts as they have been established by n ow? After Ahmosis had expelled the Hyksos, his successo rs on the throne of Egypt—several of whom indeed bore the nam e Thothmes, as the ancient historians have stated—engaged in mi litary cam- paigns in Greater Canaan, using the Way of the Sea as their inva- sion route. Thothmes I ( 15 2 5 -15 12 B.C.). a professi onal soldier, put Egypt on a war footing and launched military ex peditions into Asia as far as the Euphrates River. It is our belie f that it was he who feared Israelite disloyalty—\"when a war shall be ca lled, they shall join our enemies\"—and ordered therefore the k i l l i n g of all new- born Israelite male babies (Exodus 1:9-16). By our calculations, Moses was bom in 1513 B.C., the year before the dea th of Thothmes I. J. W. Jack (The Date of the Exodus) and others, ear lier this cen- tury, had wondered whether \"the Pharaoh's daughter\" who had retrieved the baby Moses from the river and then ra ised him in the royal palace could have been Hatshepsut, the eldest daughter of Thothmes I by his official spouse and thus the only royal princess of the time granted the high title \"The King's Daug hter,\" a title identical to that given in the Bible. We believe th at indeed it was she; and her continued treatment of Moses as an ado pted son can be explained by the fact that after she had married the succeeding Pharaoh, her half-brother Thothmes II, she could no t bear him a son. Thothmes II died after a short reign. His successor , Thothmes III—mothered by a harem girl—was Egypt's greatest w arrior-king, an ancient Napoleon in the view of some scholars. O f his seventeen campaigns against foreign lands to obtain tribute a nd captives for his major construction works, most were thrust into Canaan and Lebanon and as far north as the Euphrates River. We believe, as T. E. Peet (Egypt and the Old Testament) and others held earlier this century, that it was this Pharaoh, Thothmes II I, who was the enslaver of the Israelites; for in his military exp editions he pushed northward as far as Naharin, the Egyptian name for the area on the upper Euphrates called in the Bible Aram-Naharim, w here the kin- folk of the Hebrew Patriarchs had remained; and thi s could well explain the Pharaoh's fear (Exodus 1:10) that \"when there shall"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 289 happen to be a war, they [the Israelites] shall joi n unto our ene- mies.\" It was, we suggest, Thothmes III from whose death sen- tence Moses escaped to the wilderness of the Sinai after he had learned of his Hebrew origins and openly sided with his people. Thothmes III died in 1450 B.C. and was followed on the throne by Amenophis II—the Amasis named by Theophilus quot ing Manetho. It was indeed \"after a long time, that the king of Egypt died,\" (Exodus 2:23) that Moses dared return to Egy pt to demand of the successor—Amenophis II, in our opinion—to \"l et my people go.\" The reign of Amenophis II lasted from 1450 to 1425 B.C.; it is our conclusion that the Exodus had taken place in 1 433 B.C., ex- actly when Moses was eighty years old (Exodus 7:7). Continuing our calculation backward, we now seek to establish the date when the Israelites arrived in Egypt. Hebr ew traditions as- sert a stay of 400 years, in accord with the Lord's statement to Abraham (Genesis 15:13-14); so also states the New Testament (Acts 7:6). The Book of Exodus, however, says that \"the sojourn- ing of the Children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt wa s four hundred and thirty years\" (Exodus 12:40-41). The qualifying of \"so- journ\" by the words \"who dwelt in Egypt\" might have been in- tended to distinguish between the Josephites (who h ad dwelt in Egypt) and the newly arrived families of Joseph's b rothers, who just came \"to sojourn.\" If so, then the difference of thirty years can be accounted for by the fact that Joseph was th irty years old when made Chief of Egypt. This would leave intact t he 400 figure as the years of Israelite (rather than Josephite) s ojourn in Egypt, and place the event in 1833 B . C . (1,433 + 400). The next clue is found in Genesis 47:8-9: \"And Jose ph brought in Jacob, his father, and stood him before the Phar aoh. . . . And the Pharaoh said unto Jacob: 'How old art thou?' an d Jacob said unto Pharaoh: 'The days of my years are one hundred and thirty.\" \" Jacob, then, was born in 1963 B.C. Now, Isaac was sixty years old when Jacob was born unto him (Genesis 6:26); and Isaac was bom unto his father A braham when Abraham was 100 years old (Genesis 21:5). According ly. Abra- ham (who lived to be 175) was 160 years old when hi s grandson Jacob was born. This places the birth of Abraham in 2123 B.C. The century of Abraham—the hundred years from his b irth to the birth of his son and successor Isaac—was thus the c entury that wit- nessed the rise and fall of the Third Dynasty of Ur .

Contrary to the assertions o f advocates of biblical criticism that with the tale of Abraham th e Bible loses in- terest in the general history of mankind and the Ne ar East, to focus on the \"tribal history\" of one particular nation, t he Bible in fact continues to relate (as it did with the tales of th e Deluge and the Tower of Babel) events of major concern to mankind and its civili- zation: a war of unprecedented aspects and a disast er of a unique nature; events in which the Hebrew Patriarch played an important role. It is the tale of how the legacy of Sumer was salvaged when Sumer itself was doomed. In spite of numerous studies concerning Abraham, th e fact re- mains that all we really know about him is what we find in the Bi- ble. Belonging to a family that traced its ancestry to the line of Shem. Abraham—then called Abram—was the son of Tera h, his brothers being Harran and Nahor. When Harran died a t an early age, the family was living in \"Ur of the Chaldees.\" There, Abram married Sarai (later renamed Sarah). Then \"did Terah take Abram his son and Lot his gran dson, the son of Harran, and Sarai his daughter-in-law the wi fe of Abram his son: and they left and went forth from Ur of the Ch aldees to go to the land of Canaan: and they went as far as Harran, and dwelt there.\" Archaeologists have found Harran (\"The Caravanry\"). Situ- ated to the northwest of Mesopotamia at the foothil ls of the Taurus Mountains, it was a major crossroads in antiquity. As Mari con- trolled the southern gateway from Mesopotamia to th e lands of the Mediterranean coast, so did Harran control the gate way of the northern route to the lands of Western Asia. Markin g, at the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur, the limits of Nannar's domains where they bordered on Adad's Asia Minor. Harran was foun d by the ar- chaeologists to have been a mirror image of Ur in i ts layout and in its worship of Nannar/Sin. No explanation is given in the Bible for leaving Ur , and there is also no time stated, but we can guess the answers i f we relate the departure to events in Mesopotamia in general and i n Ur in particu- lar. We know that Abraham was seventy-five when he proce eded later on from Harran to Canaan. The tenor of the bi blical narrative suggests a long stay at Harran and depicts Abraham on his arrival there as a young man with a new bride.

We have de- scribed the traumatic effect of the event on the pe ople of Mesopota- mia, the shock it had given to their faith in Nanna r's omnipotence and the fidelity of Enlil's word. The year of Ur-Nammu's fall was 2096 B.C. Could it not have been the year when—under the impact of the event or as a conse- quence thereof—Terah and his family left Ur for a f araway destina- tion, stopping off at Harran, the Ur away from Ur? All through the following years of Ur's decline and Shulgi's pro- fanities, the family stayed on in Harran. Then, sud denly, the Lord acted again: And Yahweh said unto Abram: \"Get thee out of thy country and out of thy birthplace and from thy father's house, unto the land which I will show thee\" . . . And Abram departed as Yahweh had spoken unto him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was seventy-five years old when he left H arran. Once again, no reason is given for the crucial move . But the chronological clue is most revealing. When Abraham was seventy- five years old, the year was 2048 B.C.— the very ye ar of Shulgi's downfall! Because Abraham's family (Genesis 11) directly cont inued the line of Shem, Abraham has been considered a Semite, one whose background, cultural heritage, and language were Se mitic, as dis- tinct (in scholars' minds) from the non-Semitic Sum erians and the later Indo-Europeans. But in the original biblical sense, all the peo- ples of greater Mesopotamia were descended of Shem. \"Semite\" and \"Sumerian\" alike. There is nothing in the Bible that sug- gests—as some scholars have begun to hold—that Abra ham and his family were Amorites (i.e., western Semites) who ha d come as im- migrants to Sumer and then returned to their origin al abode. On the contrary: There is everything to support the image of a family rooted in Sumer from its earliest beginnings, hasti ly uprooted from its country and birthplace and told to go to an unf amiliar land.

Abraham emerges not as the son of immigrant aliens but as t he scion of a family directly involved in Sumerian affairs of sta te! In their search for the answer to the question of \" Who Was Abraham,\" scholars have seized upon the similarity between his designation as a Hebrew (Ibri) and the term Hapiru (which in the Near East could transform to Habiru) by which the A ssyrians and Babylonians in the eighteenth and seventeenth centu ries B.C. called bands of pillaging western Semites. At the end of t he fifteenth cen- tury B.C., the commander of an Egyptian garrison in Jerusalem asked his king for reinforcements against approachi ng Hapiru. Scholars have taken all that as evidence for the no tion that Abra- ham was a western Semite. Many scholars doubt, however, whether the term deno tes an ethnic group at all, wondering whether the word was not a descrip- tive noun simply meaning \"marauders\" or \"invaders.\" The sug- gestion that Ibri (clearly from the verb \"to cross\" ) and Hapiru are one and the same entails substantial philological a nd etymological problems. There are also great chronological incons istencies, all of which gave rise to serious objections to this sugge sted solution for the identity of Abraham, especially when the biblic al data is com- pared with the \"bandit\" connotation of the term Hap iru. Thus the Bible relates incidents concerning water wells, whi ch show that Abraham was careful to avoid conflict with local re sidents as he journeyed through Canaan. When Abraham became invol ved in the War of the Kings, he refused to share in the bo oty. This is not the behavior of a marauding barbarian but rather of a person of high standards of conduct. Coming to Egypt, Abraham and Sarah were taken to the Pharaoh's court; in Canaan, Abraham ma de treaties with the local rulers. This is not the image of a n omad pillaging others' settlements; it is the image of a personage of high standing skilled in negotiation and diplomacy. It was out of such considerations that Alfred Jerem ias, then a leading Assyriologist and professor of the history of religion at the Leipzig University, announced in the 1930 edition o f his master work Das Alte Testament im Lichte des Alten Orients that \"in his intellectual makeup Abraham was a Sumerian.\" He enl arged on this conclusion in a 1932 study entitled Der Kosmos von Sumer: \"Abraham was not a Semitic Babylonian but a Sumeria n.\" Abra- ham, he suggested, headed the Faithful whose reform ation sought to raise Sumerian society to higher religious level s."},{"pageNumber":296,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 293 These were audacious ideas in a Germany witnessing the rise of Nazism with its racial theories. Soon after the ass umption of power by Hitler, the heretic suggestions of Jeremias were strongly put down by Nikolaus Schneider in a reply entitled War Abraham Sumerer? Abraham was neither a Sumerian nor a man o f pure de- scent, he concluded: \"From the time of the reign of the Akkadian king Sargon in Ur, the home-place of Abraham, there was never there a pure, unmixed Sumerian population and a hom ogenous Su- merian culture.\" The ensuing upheavals and World War II cut off furt her debate on the subject. Regrettably, the thread discerned b y Jeremias has not been picked up. Yet all the biblical and Mesopo tamian evi- dence tells us that Abraham was indeed a Sumerian. The Old Testament, in fact (Genesis 17:1-16), provi des us with the time and manner in which Abraham was transforme d from a Sumerian nobleman to a west Semitic potentate, unde r a covenant between him and his God. Amid a ritual of circumcis ion, his Su- merian name AB.RAM (\"Father's Beloved\") was changed to the Akkadian/Semitic Abraham (\"Father of a Multitude of Nations' 1 and that of his wife SARAI (\"Princess\") was adapted to the Se- mitic Sarah. It was only when he was ninety-nine years old that Abraham be- came a \"Semite.\" As we decipher the age-old enigma of Abraham's iden tity and his Mission to Canaan, it is in Sumerian history, c ustoms, and lan- guage that we shall search for the answers. Is it not naive to assume that for the Mission to C anaan, for the birth of a nation, and for kingship over all the la nds from the border of Egypt to the border of Mesopotamia, the Lord wou ld choose someone at random, picking up anyone in the streets of Ur? The young woman whom Abraham married bore the epithet-n ame Prin- cess; since she was a half-sister of Abraham (\"Inde ed she is my sister, the daughter of my father but not the daugh ter of my mother\"), we can take it for granted that either Ab raham's father or Sarah's mother was of royal descent. Since the d aughter of Harran, Abraham's brother, also bore a royal name ( Milkha— \"Queenly\"), it follows that it was through the fath er of Abraham that the royal ancestry flowed. In dealing with Abr aham's family we thus deal with a family of Sumer's highest echel ons; people of a noble deportment and elegant dress as found depicte d on various Sumerian statues (Fig. 98)."},{"pageNumber":297,"pageContent":"294 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Fig. 98 It was a family that not only could claim descent f rom Shem but which kept family records tracing its lineage throu gh generations of firstborn sons: Arpakhshad and Shelach and Eber; Peleg, Re'u, and Serug: Nahor and Terah and Abraham; taking the family's re- corded history back for no less than three centurie s! What do the epithet-names signify? If Shelach (\"Swo rd\") was born, as chapter 11 of Genesis states, 258 years be fore Abraham, he was born in 2381 B.C.

This erroneous interpretation has stemm ed from the search for the meaning of the epithet-name in Weste rn Asia. It is our conviction that instead the answer is to be fou nd in the Sume- rian origins and the Sumerian language of Abraham a nd his ances- tors. Such a look at the Sumerian roots of the fami ly and the name provides an answer that startles with its simplicit y. The term Ibri (\"Hebrew\") by which Abraham and his f amily identified themselves clearly stemmed from Eber, th e father of Peleg, and from the root \"to cross.\" Instead of see king the mean- ing of the epithet-name in the Hapiru notions or in Western Asia, it is our conviction that the answer is to be found in the Sumerian ori- gins and the Sumerian language of Abraham and his a ncestors. Then, a new solution emerges with startling simplic ity: The biblical suffix \"i,\" when applied to a person, meant \"a na- tive of; Gileadi meant a native of Gilead and so on . Likewise, Ibri meant a native of the place called \"Crossing\": and that, pre- cisely, was the Sumerian name for Nippur: NI.IB.RU— the Cross- ing Place, the place where the pre-Diluvial grids c risscrossed each other, the original Navel of the Earth, the olden M ission Control Center. The dropping of the n in transposing from Sumerian to Akka- dian/Hebrew was a frequent occurrence. In stating t hat Abraham was an Ibri, the Bible simply meant that Abraham wa s a Ni-ib-ri, a man of Nippurian origin! The fact that Abraham's family migrated to Harran f rom Ur has been taken by scholars to imply that Ur was also Ab raham's birth- place; but that is not stated anywhere in the Bible . On the contrary, the command to Abraham to go to Canaan and leave fo r good his past abodes lists three separate entities: his fath er's house (which was then in Harran); his land (the city-state of Ur ); and his birth- place (which the Bible does not identify). Our sugg estion that Ibri means a native of Nippur solves the problem of Abra ham's true birthplace. As the name Eber indicates, it was in his time—the middle of the twenty-fourth century B.C.—that the family's associ ation with Nippur had begun. Nippur was never a royal capital; rather, it was a consecrated city, Sumer's \"religious center,\" as scholars put it. It was also the place where the knowledge of astron omy was en- trusted to the high priests and thus the place wher e the calendar—"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"296 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN the relationship between the Sun, Earth, and Moon i n their orbits—was originated. Scholars have recognized that our present-day calen dars derive from the original Nippurian calendar. All the evide nce shows that the Nippurian calendar began circa 4000 B . C , in the age of Taurus. In this we find yet another confirmation of the umb ilical cord con- necting the Hebrews with Nippur: The Jewish calenda r still contin- ues to count the years from an enigmatic beginning in 3760 B.C. (so that in 1983 the Jewish year was 5743). It has been assumed that this is a count \"from the beginning of the world\"; but the actual statement by Jewish sages was that this is the numb er of years that had passed \"since counting [of years) began.\" We su ggest that it means, since the introduction of the calendar in Ni ppur. In the ancestral family of Abraham we thus find a p riestly family of royal blood, a family headed by a Nippurian high priest who was the only one allowed into the temple's innermost ch amber, there to receive the deity's word and convey it to king and people. In this regard the name of Abraham's father. Terah, is of great interest. Seeking clues only in the Semitic environ ment, biblical scholars regard the name, as those of Harran and Na hor, as mere toponyms (names that personify places), holding tha t there were cities by such names in central and northern Mesopo tamia. Assyri- ologists searching the Akkadian terminology (being the first Se- mitic language) could only find that Tirhu meant \"a n artifact or vessel for magical purposes.\" But if we turn to the Sumerian language, we find that the cuneiform sign for Tirhu stemmed directly from that of an object called in Sumerian DUG.NAMTAR —literally, a \"Fate Speaker\"—a Pronouncer of Oracle s! Terah, then, was an Oracle Priest, one assigned to approaching the \"Stone that Whispers\" to hear the deity's words and communi- cate them (with or without an interpretation) to th e lay hierarchy. It was a function assumed in later times by the Israel ite High Priest, who alone was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies, approach the Dvir (\"Speaker\"), and \"hear the voice [of the Lord] speak unto him from off the overlay which is upon the Ark of t he Covenant, from between the two Cherubim.\" During the Israelit e Exodus, at Mount Sinai the Lord proclaimed that his covenant w ith the de- scendants of Abraham meant that \"ye shall be unto m e a kingdom of priests.\" It was a statement that reflected the status of Abra- ham's own descent: a royal priesthood. Farfetched as these conclusions may sound, they are in full ac- cord with the Sumerian practices whereby kings appo inted their"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 297 daughters and sons, and often themselves, to high-p riestly posi- tions, resulting in the commingling of the royal an d priestly lin- eages. Votive inscriptions found at Nippur (as thos e by the archaeological expeditions of the University of Pen nsylvania) con- firm that the kings of Ur cherished the title \"Piou s Shepherd of Nippur\" and performed there priestly functions; and the governor of Nippur (PA.TE.SI NI.IB.RU) was also the Foremost UR.ENLIL (\"Enlil's Foremost Servant\"). Some of the names borne by these royal-priestly VIP s resembled Abraham's Sumerian name (AB.RAM), also beginning wi th the component AB (\"Father\" or \"Progenitor\"); such, for example, was the name AB.BA.MU of a governor of Nippur durin g Shulgi's reign. That a family of people so closely associated with Nippur that they were called \"Nippurians\" (i.e., \"Hebrews\") wer e neverthe- less holding high positions in Ur is a suggestion t hat is in complete accord with the actual circumstances prevailing in Sumer at the time indicated by us; for it was then, at the lime of the Ur III Dy- nasty, that for the first time in divine affairs an d Sumerian history Nannar and the king of Ur were granted trusteeship over Nippur, combining the religious and secular functions. It t hus could have well been that when Ur-Nammu assumed the throne in Ur. Terah moved with his family from Nippur to Ur, perhaps to serve as a li- aison between the temple in Nippur and the royal pa lace in Ur. Their stay in Ur lasted throughout Ur-Nammu's reign ; it was in the year of his death, as we have shown, that the famil y left Ur for Harran. What the family did at Harran is nowhere stated, bu t considering the royal lineage and priestly standing, it must ha ve belonged to the hierarchy of Harran. The ease with which Abraham de alt, later on, with various kings suggests that he was involved in Harran's for- eign affairs; his special friendship with the Hitti te residents of Ca- naan, who were known for their military experience, may shed a light on the question of where Abraham himself had acquired the military proficiency which he employed so successfu lly during the War of the Kings. Ancient traditions also depict Abraham as greatly v ersed in astronomy—a knowledge then valuable for long journe ys guided by the stars. According to Josephus, Berossus refer red to Abra- ham, without naming him, when he wrote of the rise \"among the Chaldeans, of a certain righteous and great man who was well seen"},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"298 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN in astronomy.\" (If Berossus, the Babylonian histori an, had indeed referred to Abraham, the significance of the inclus ion of the He- brew Patriarch in Babylonian chronicles far exceeds the mere notation of his knowledge of astronomy.) All during the ignominious years of Shulgi's reign, the family of Terah stayed at Harran. Then, on Shulgi's demise, t he divine order came to proceed to Canaan. Terah was already quite old, and Nahor, his son, was to stay on with him in Harran. The one chosen for the mission was Abraham—himself a mature man of seventy- five. The year was 2048 B.C.; it marked the beginni ng of twenty- four fateful years—eighteen years encompassing the war-filled reigns of the two immediate successors of Shulgi (A mar-Sin and Shu-Sin) and six years of Ibbi-Sin. the last sovere ign king of Ur. It is undoubtedly more than mere coincidence that S hulgi's death was the signal not only for a move by Abraham, but also for a realignment among the Near Eastern gods. It was exa ctly when Abraham, accompanied (as we learn later) by an elit e military corps, left Harran—the gateway to the Hittite lands —that the exiled and wandering Marduk appeared in \"Haiti land.\" More over, the remarkable coincidence is that Marduk stayed there through the same twenty-four Fateful Years, the years that culm inated with the great Disaster. The evidence for Marduk's movements is a tablet (Fi g. 99) found in the library of Ashurbanipal, in which an a ging Marduk tells of his erstwhile wanderings and eventual retu rn to Babylon: O great gods, learn my secrets. As I girdle my belt, my memories remember: I am the divine Marduk, a great god. I was cast off for my sins. to the mountains I have gone. In many lands I have been a wanderer: From where the sun rises to where it sets I went. To the heights of Hatti-land I went. In Hatti-land I asked an oracle [about] my throne and my Lordship: In its midst [I asked]: \"Until when?\" 24 years, in its midst. I nested.

As on a signal, with the death of Shulgi, the whole ancient world came astir. The House of Nannar had been discredite d, and the House of Marduk saw its final prevailing hour appro aching.

Though silent conc erning Abraham's mission, the Old Testament is clear regar ding his desti- nation: Moving expeditiously to Canaan, Abraham and his wife, his nephew Lot, and their entourage continued swift ly southward. There was a stopover at Shechem, where the Lord spo ke to Abra- ham. \"Then he removed from there to the Mount, and encamped east of Beth-El; and he built there an altar to Yah weh and called the name of Yahweh.\" Beth-El, whose name meant \"God 's House\"—a site to which Abraham kept coming back—was in the vicinity of Jerusalem and its hallowed Mount, Mount Moriah (\"Mount of Directing\"), upon whose Sacred Rock the Ark of the Covenant was placed when Solomon built the Temple o f Yahweh in Jerusalem. From there \"Abram journeyed farther, still going to ward the Negev.\" The Negev—the dry region where Canaan and t he Sinai peninsula merge—was clearly Abraham's destination. Several di- vine pronouncements designated the Brook of Egypt ( nowadays called Wadi El-Arish) as the southern boundary of A braham's do- main, and the oasis of Kadesh-Barnea as his souther nmost outpost (see map). What was Abraham to do in the Negev, who se very name (\"The Dryness\") bespoke its aridity? What was there that required the patriarch's hurried, long journey from Harran and impelled his presence among the miles upon miles of barren land? The significance of Mount Moriah—Abraham's first fo cus of interest—was that in those days it served, together with its sister mounts Mount Zophim (\"Mount of Observers\") and Moun t Zion (\"Mount of Signal\"), as the site of Mission Control Center of the Anunnaki. The significance of the Negev, its only s ignificance, was that it was the gateway to the Spaceport in the Sinai. Subsequent narrative informs us that Abraham had mi litary al- lies in the region and that his entourage included an elite corps of several hundred fighting men. The biblical term for them—Naar— has been variously translated as \"retainer\" or simp ly \"young man\"; but studies have shown that in Human the word denoted riders or cavalrymen. In fact, recent studies of Me sopotamian texts dealing with military movements list among the men of the chariots and the cavalry LU.NAR (\"Nar-men\") who served as fa st riders. We find an identical term in the Bible (I Samuel 30 :17): after King David attacked an Amalekite camp, the only ones to escape were \"fourhundred Ish-Naar\"—literally, 'War-men\" or LU.NAR— \"who were riding the camels.\""},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 301 In describing Abraham's fighting men as Naar men, t he Old Testament thus informs us that he had with him a co rps of cavalry- men, in all probability camel riders rather than ho rsemen.

The emerging image of Abraham not as a sheepherding nomad but as an innovative military commander of royal de scent may not fit the customary image of this Hebrew patriarch, b ut it is in accord with ancient recollections of Abraham. Thus, quotin g earlier sources concerning Abraham, Josephus (first century A . D .) wrote of him: \"Abraham reigned at Damascus, where he was a for- eigner, having come with an army out of the land ab ove Babylon\" from which, \"after a long time, the Lord got him up and removed from that country together with his men and he went to the land then called the land of Canaan but now the land of Judaea.\" The mission of Abraham was a military one: to prote ct the space facilities of the Anunnaki—the Mission Control Cent er and the Spaceport! After a short stay in the Negev Abraham traversed t he Sinai pen- insula and came to Egypt. Evidently no ordinary nom ads, Abra- ham and Sarah were at once taken to the royal palac e. By our reckoning the time was circa 2047 B.C., when the Ph araohs then ruling in Lower (northern) Egypt—who were not follo wers of Amen (\"The Hiding God\" Ra/Marduk)—were facing a str ong challenge from the princes of Thebes in the south, where Amen was deemed supreme. We can only guess what matters of state— alliances, joint defenses, divine commands—were dis cussed be- tween the beleaguered Pharaoh and the Ibri, the Nip purian general. The Bible is silent on this as well as on the lengt h of stay. (The Book of Jubilees states that the sojourn lasted fiv e years). When the time came for Abraham to return to the Negev, he wa s accompa- nied by a large retinue of the Pharaoh's men. \"And Abraham went from Egypt, he and his wife and L ot with him, up onto the Negev.\" He was \"heavy with flocks\" of sheep and cattle for food and clothing, as well as with a sses and camels for his fast riders. Again he went to Beth-El to \"c all the name of Yahweh,\" seeking instructions. A separation from Lo t followed, the nephew choosing to reside with his own flocks i n the Plain of the Jordan, \"which was watered as the Garden of the Lord, before Yahweh destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.\" Abraham went on to"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"302 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN the hill country, settling on the highest peak near Hebron, from where he could see in all directions; and the Lord said unto him: \"Go, cross the country in the length and the breadt h of it, for unto thee shall I give it.\" It was soon thereafter, \"in the days of Amraphel ki ng of Shin'ar,\" that the military expedition of the easte rn alliance had taken place. \"Twelve years they [the Canaanite kings] served Khe dorla'o- mer; in the thirteenth year they rebelled; and in t he fourteenth year there came Khedorla'omer and the kings that were wi th him\" (Genesis 14:4-5). Scholars have long searched the archaeological reco rds for the events described in the Bible; their efforts have b een unsuccessful because they searched for Abraham in the wrong era. But if we are right in our chronology, a simple solution to the \" Amraphel\" problem becomes possible. It is a new solution, yet one that rests on scholarly suggestions made (and ignored) almost a century ago. Back in 1875, comparing the traditional reading of the name with its spelling in early biblical translations, F . Lenormant (La Langue Primitive cle la Chaldee) had suggested that the correct reading should be \"Amar-pal, \" as written out phone tically in the Septuagint (the third century B.C. translation of t he Old Testament into Greek from the original Hebrew). Two years lat er D. H. Haigh, writing in the Zeitschrift fur Agyptische Sp rache und Altertumskunde, also adopted the reading \"Amarpal\" and, stating that \"the second element [of the king's name] is a name of the Moon-god [Sin],\" declared: \"I have long been convin ced of the identity of Amar-pal as one of the kings of Ur.\" In 1916, Franz M. Bohl (Die Kbnige von Genesis 14) suggested again—without success—that the name be read, as in the Septuagint, \"Amar-pal,\" explaining that it meant \"Seen by the S on\"—a royal name in line with other royal names in the Near Eas t, such as the Egyptian Thoth-mes (\"Seen by Thoth\"). (For some rea son Bohl and others have neglected to mention the no-less-signif icant fact that the Septuagint spelled out the name of Khedorla'omer Kh odologomar— almost identical to the Kudur-lagamar of the Sparto li tablets.) Pal (meaning \"son\") was indeed a common suffix in M esopota- mian royal names, standing for the deity considered the favorite Divine Son. Since in Ur the god deemed to have been the Favored Son was Nannar/Sin, we suggest that Amar-Sin and Am ar-pal were, in Ur, one and the same name."},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 303 Our identification of \"Amarphal\" of Genesis 14 as A mar-Sin, third king of Ur's Third Dynasty, meshes perfectly the biblical and the Sumerian chronologies. The biblical tale of the War of the Kings places the event soon after Abraham's return to the Negev from Egypt but before the tenth anniversary of his arrival in Ca- naan; i.e., between 2042 and 2039 B . C . The reign of Amar- Sin/Amar-Pal lasted from 2047 to 2039 B.C.; accordi ngly, the war had taken place in the latter part of his reign. The year formulas for Amar-Sin's reign pinpoint his seventh year—2041 B.C.—as the year of the major military ex pedition to the western provinces. The biblical data (Genesis 1 4:4-5) asserts that this took place in the fourteenth year after t he Elamites under Khedorla'omer had subjugated the Canaanite kings: a nd the year 2041 was indeed fourteen years after Shulgi, having received Nannar's oracles, had launched in 2055 B . C . the military expedi- tion led by Elamites into Canaan. Our synchronization of biblical and Sumerian events and dates unfolds the following sequence and upholds every ti me factor re- ported in the Bible: 2123 B .

Terah and his family move to Ur. 2095 B.C. • Shulgi ascends throne after death of Ur -Nammu. Terah and his family leave Ur for Harran. 2055 B . C . • Shulgi receives Nannar's oracles, sends Elamite troops to Canaan. 2048 B . C . • Shulgi's death ordered by Anu and Enlil. Abraham, seventy-five years old, ordered to leave Harran for Canaan. 2047 B . C . • Amar-Sin (\"Amarpal\") ascends the throne of Ur. Abraham leaves the Negev for Egypt. 2042 B . C . • Canaanite kings switch allegiance to \"other gods. \" Abraham returns from Egypt with elite corps. 2041 B . C . • Amar-Sin launches the War of the Kings. Who were the \"other gods\" that were winning the all egiance of Canaanite cities?

But even seen fr om the biblical"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 305 viewpoint, which compressed the Mesopotamian tales of the gods into a monotheistic mold, it was an unusual war: th e ostensible purpose—the suppression of a rebellion—turns out to have been a secondary aspect of the war; the real target—a cros sroads oasis in a wilderness—was never reached. Taking the southern route from Mesopotamia to Canaa n, the in- vaders proceeded southward in Transjordan, along th e King's Highway, attacking in succession key outposts guard ing crossing points on the Jordan River: Ashterot-Karnayim in th e north; Ham in the center; and Shaveh-Kiryatayim in the south. According to the biblical tale, a place called El-P aran was the real target of the invaders, but it was never reach ed by them. Com- ing down Transjordan and circling the Dead Sea, the invaders passed by Mount Se'ir and advanced \"toward El-Paran , which is upon the Wilderness.\" But they were forced to \"swin g back by Ein-Mishpat, which is Kadesh.\" El-Paran (\"God's Gloried Place\"?) was never reached; somehow the invaders we re beaten back at Ein-Mishpat, also known as Kadesh or Kadesh -Barnea. It was only then, as they turned back toward Canaan , that \"Thereupon the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorr ah and the king of Adman and the king of Zebi'im and the king of Bela, which is Zoar, marched forth and engaged them in battle i n the Vale of Siddim.\" (See map.) The battle with these Canaanite kings was thus a la te phase of the war and not its first purpose. Almost a century ago, in a thor- ough study titled Kadesh-Bamea, H. C. Trumbull had concluded that the true target of the invaders was El-Paran. which he correctly identified as the fortified oasis of Nakhl in Sinai 's central plain. But neither he nor others could explain why a great alliance would launch an army to a destination a thousand mi les away and fight gods and men to reach an isolated oasis in a great, desolate plain. But why had they gone there, and who was it that bl ocked their way at Kadesh-Barnea, forcing the invaders to turn back? There have been no answers; and no answers can make sense ex- cept the ones offered by us: The only significance of the destina- tion was its Spaceport, and the one who blocked the advance at Kadesh-Barnea was Abraham. From earlier times Kades h-Bamea was the closest place where men could approach in t he region of the Spaceport without special permission.

It was the place the Sumerians called BAD.GAL.DINGIR and Sargon of Akkad Dur-Mah-I lani, clearly listing it in his inscriptions as a place i n Tilmun (the Sinai peninsula). It was the place, we suggest, which the Bible calle d Kadesh- Barnea; and there Abraham stood with his elite troo ps, blocking the invaders' advance to the Spaceport proper. The hints in the Old Testament become a detailed ta le in the Khedorlaomer Texts, which make clear that the war w as intended to prevent the return of Marduk and thwart the effo rts of Nabu to gain access to the Spaceport. These texts not only name the very same kings who are mentioned in the Bible but even repeat the bib- lical detail of the switch of allegiance \"'in the t hirteenth year\"! As we return to the Khedorlaomer Texts to obtain th e details for the biblical frame, we should bear in mind that the y were written by a Babylonian historian who favored Marduk's desi re to make Babylon \"the heavenward navel in the four regions.\" It was to thwart this that the gods opposing Marduk ordered K hedorla'omer to seize and defile Babylon: The gods . . . to Kudur-Laghamar, king of the land Elam, they decreed: \"Descend there!\" That which to the city was bad he performed: In Babylon, the precious city of Marduk, sovereignty he seized; In Babylon, the city of the king of the gods. Mardu k. kingship he overthrew; To herds of dogs its temple he made a den; Flying ravens, loud shrieking, their dung dropped t here. The despoiling of Babylon was only the beginning. A fter the \"bad deeds\" were done there, Utu/Shamash sought act ion against Nabu, who (he said in accusation) had subverted the allegiance of a certain king to his father, Nannar/Sin. It happened , the Khedorla'- omer Text states, in the thirteenth year (just as G enesis 14 states): Before the gods the son of his father [came]; On that day Shamash, the Bright One. against the lord of lords, Marduk [he said]: \"The faithfulness of his heart [the king] betrayed— in the time of the thirteenth year"},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Abraham: The Fateful Years 307 a falling-out against my father [he had]; to his faith-keeping the king ceased to attend; all this Nabu has caused to happen.\" The assembled gods, thus alerted to the role of Nab u in the spreading rebellions, put together a coalition of l oyal kings and ap- pointed the Elamite Kudur-Laghamar as its military commander. Their first order was that \"Borsippa, the stronghol d [of Nabuj. with weapons be despoiled.\" Carrying out the order, \"Kudur- Laghamar, with wicked thoughts against Marduk, the shrine of Borsippa with fire he destroyed and its sons with a sword he slew.\" Then, the military expedition against the rebelliou s kings was or- dered. The Babylonian text lists the targets to be attacked and the names of their attackers; we easily recognize the b iblical names among them: Eriaku (Ariokh) was to attack Shebu (Be er-Sheba) and Tud-Ghula (Tidhal) was to \"smite with a sword t he sons of Gaza.\" Acting in accordance with an oracle of Ishtar, the army put together by the Kings of the East arrived in Transj ordan. First to be attacked was a stronghold in \"the high land,\" then Rabattum. The route was the same as the one describ ed in the Bible: from the highland in the north through the d istrict of Rabat-Amon in the center, southward around the Dead Sea. Thereafter, Dur-Mah-Ilani was to be captured, and t he Ca- naanite cities (including Gaza and Beer-Sheba in th e Negev) were to be punished. But at Dur-Mah-Ilani, accordin g to the Babylonian text, \"the son of the priest, whom the g ods in their true counsel had anointed,\" stood in the invaders' way and \"the despoiling prevented.\" Could the Babylonian text indeed refer to Abraham, the son of Terah the priest, and spell out his role in turning back the invaders? The possibility is strengthened by the fact that th e Mesopotamian and biblical texts relate the same event in the sam e locality with the same outcome. But there is more to it than just a possibility, fo r we have come upon one highly intriguing clue. This is the unnoticed fact that the date formulas f or the reign of Amar-Sin call his seventh year—the crucial year 204 1 B.C., the year of the military expedition—also MU NE IB.RU.UM BA.HUL (Fig. 100), \"Year [in which] the Shepherding-abode of IB.RU.UM was attacked.\""},{"pageNumber":311,"pageContent":"308 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Fig. 100 Can this reference, in the exact crucial year, be o ther than to Abraham and his shepherding abode? There is also a possible pictorial commemoration of the inva- sion. This is a scene carved on a Sumerian cylinder seal (Fig. 101). It has been regarded as depicting the journey of Et ana, an early king of Kish, to the Winged Gateway, where an \"Eagl e\" took him aloft so high that the Earth disappeared from view. But the seal de- picts the crowned hero on horseback—too early for E tana's time— and standing between the site of the Winged Gateway and two distinct groups. One of four armed Mighty Men whose leader is also on horseback moves toward a cultivated area in the Sinai pen- insula (indicated by the symbol of Sin's crescent w ith wheat grow- ing in it). The other is of five kings, facing in t he opposite direction. The depiction thus has all the elements of an ancient il- lustration of the War of the Kings and the role of the \"Priest's Son\" in it, rather than that of Etana's journey to the Spaceport. The hero, depicted in the center atop an animal, could thus be Abraham rather than Etana.

But the invaders beat them and \"seized all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah\" as well as one p rize hos- tage: \"They took with them Lot, the nephew of Abrah am, who was residing at Sodom.\" On hearing the news, Abraham called up his best cav alrymen and pursued the retreating invaders. Catching up wi th them near Damascus, he succeeded in releasing Lot and retriev ing all the booty. Upon his return he was greeted as a victor i n the Valley of Shalem (Jerusalem): And Malkizedek, the king of Shalem, brought forth bread and wine, for he was a priest unto the God Most High. And he blessed him, saying: \"Blessed be Abram unto the God Most High, Possessor of Heaven and Earth; And blessed be the God Most High who hath delivered thine foes into thine hand.\" Soon the Canaanite kings also arrived to thank Abra ham, and of- fered him all the seized possessions as a reward. B ut Abraham, saying that his local allies could share in that, r efused to take \"even a shoe lace\" for himself or his warriors. He had ac ted neither out of friendship for the Canaanite kings nor out of enmit y for the Eastern Alliance; in the war between the House of Nannar an d the House of Marduk, he was neutral. It was for \"Yahweh, the God Most High, Possessor of Heaven and Earth, that I have raised m y hands,\" he stated. The failed invasion did not arrest the rush of mome ntous events in the ancient world. A year later, in 2040 B.C., M enluhotep II, leader of the Theban princes, defeated the northern Pharaohs and extended the rule of Thebes (and of its god) up to the western ap- proaches to the Sinai peninsula. In the following y ear Amar-Sin at- tempted to reach the Sinai peninsula by sea, only t o find his death by a poisonous bite. The attacks on the Spaceport were thwarted, but the danger to it was not removed; and the efforts of Marduk to gain the supremacy intensified ever more.

'\"And the Lord appeared unto him in the terebrinth grove of Mamre as he was sitting at the entrance of the tent , in the heat of the day. And he lifted his eyes and looked, and beh old—three men were stationed upon him; and as he saw them he ran from the en- trance of the tent towards them, and bowed to the g round.\" Swiftly, from a typical Middle Eastern scene of a p otentate rest- ing in the shade of his tent, the biblical narrator of Genesis 18 raised Abraham's eyes and thrust him—and the reader , too—into a sudden encounter with divine beings. Though Abraham was gazing out, he did not see the three approaching: t hey were sud- denly \"stationed upon him.\" And though they were \"m en,\" he at once recognized their true identity and bowed to th em, calling them \"my lords\" and asking them not to \"pass over a bove thy ser- vant\" until he had a chance to prepare for them a s umptuous meal. It was dusk when the divine visitors finished eatin g and resting. Asking about Sarah, their leader said to Abraham: \" Return I shall unto thee at this time next year: by then Sarah thy wife will have a son.\" The promise of a Rightful Heir to Abraham and Sarah at their old age was not the sole reason for dropping down o n Abraham. There was a more ominous purpose: And the men rose up from there to survey over upon Sodom. And Abraham had gone with them to see them off, and the Lord said: \"Can I conceal from Abraham that which I am about t o do?\" Recalling Abraham's past services and promised futu re, the Lord then disclosed to him the true purpose of the divine journey: to verify accusations against Sodom and Gomorrah. \" The outcry regarding Sodom and Gomorrah being great, and the a ccusation 310"},{"pageNumber":314,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Holocaust 311 against them being grievous,\" the Lord said he had decided to \"come down and verify; if it is as the outcry reach ing me, they will destroy completely; and if not, I wish to know.\" The ensuing destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah has b ecome one of the most frequently depicted and preached-ab out biblical episodes. The orthodox and the Fundamentalists neve r doubled that the Lord God had literally poured fire and bri mstone from the skies to wipe the sinful cities off the face of the earth. The scholarly and sophisticated have as tenaciously sought to fin d \"natural\" ex- planations for the biblical story: an earthquake; a volcanic erup- tion; some other natural phenomenon which (they gra nt) might have been interpreted as an act of God. a punishmen t befitting the sin. But so far as the biblical narrative is concerned—a nd until now it has been the only source for all the interpretation s—the event was most definitely not a natural calamity. It is descr ibed as a premedi- tated event: the Lord discloses to Abraham ahead of time what is about to happen and why. It is an avoidable event, not a calamity caused by irreversible natural forces: The calamity shall come to pass only if the \"outcry\" against Sodom and Gomorra h will be confirmed. And thirdly (as we shall soon discover) it was also a postponable event, one whose occurrence could be ma de to happen earlier or later, at will. Realizing the avoidability of the calamity, Abraham embarked upon a tactic of argumentative attrition: \"Perhaps there be fifty Righteous Ones inside the city,\" he said. \"Wilt tho u destroy and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty Right eous Ones within it?\" Then he quickly added: \"Far be it from you to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the guilty! Far b e it from you. the Judge of All the Earth, not to do justice!\" A mortal preaching to his Deity! And the plea is fo r calling off the destruction—the premeditated and avoidable dest ruction—if there be fifty Righteous Ones in the city. But no s ooner had the Lord agreed to spare the city if there be found suc h fifty persons than Abraham, who might have chosen the number fift y knowing that it would strike a special chord, wondered out loud if the Lord shall destroy if the number were five short. When t he Lord agreed to call off the destruction if only forty-five be f ound Righteous. Abraham continued to bargain the number down to for ty, then thirty, then twenty, then ten. \"And the Lord said: 'I shall not de- stroy if there be ten'; and he departed as he finis hed speaking to Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.\""},{"pageNumber":315,"pageContent":"312 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN At evetime, the two companions of the Lord—the bibl ical narra- tive now refers to them as Mal'akhim (translated \"a ngels\" but meaning \"emissaries\")—arrived at Sodom, their task being to ver- ify the accusations against the city and report the ir findings back to the Lord. Lot—who was sitting at the city's gate—re cognized at once (as Abraham had done earlier) the divine nature of the two visitors, their identity evidently being given away by their attire or weapons, or perhaps by the manner (flying over?) in which they arrived. Now it was Lot's turn to insist on hospitality, and the two ac- cepted his invitation to spend the night at his hom e; but it was not to be a restful night, for the news of their arriva l had stirred up the whole city. \"They had hardly lain down when the people of the c ity, the people of Sodom, surrounded the house—young and old , the whole population, from every quarter; and they called unt o Lot and said unto him: \"Where are the men who came unto you toni ght? Bring them out to us, that we may know them.' \" When Lot failed to do so. the crowd surged to break their way in; but the two Mal'akhim \"smote the people who were at the house's entrance with blind- ness, both young and old; and they wearied themselv es trying to find the doorway.\" Realizing that of all the townspeople only Lot was \"righteous,\" the two emissaries needed no further investigation; the fate of the city was sealed. \"And they said unto Lot: 'Who else hast thou here besides thee—a son-in-law, thy sons and daughters, any other relative—all who are in this city—bring them out fr om this place, for we are about to destroy it.' Rushing to convey the news to his sons-in-law, Lot only met disbelief and laughter. S o at dawn the emissaries urged Lot to escape without delay, takin g with him only his wife and their two unmarried daughters who live d with them at home. But Lot tarried; so the men took hold of his hand and his wife's hand and his two daughters' hands —for Yahweh's mercy was upon him— and they brought them out, and put them down outside the city.

Agreeing, one of the emissaries asked h im to hurry there: \"Haste thee to escape thither, for I will be unable to do any- thing until thou hast arrived there.\" The calamity was thus not only predictable and avoi dable but also postponable; and it could be made to afflict v arious cities at different times. No natural catastrophe could have featured all these aspects. The sun was risen over the Earth when Lot arrived a t Zoar; And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah, from t he skies. brimstone and fire that had come from Yahweh. And He upheavaled those cities and the whole plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities and all the vegetation that grows from the ground. The cities, the people, the vegetation—everything w as \"upheav- aled\" by the gods' weapon. Its heat and fire scorch ed all before it: its radiation affected people even at some distance away: Lot's wife, ignoring the admonition not to stop to look b ack as they were fleeing away from Sodom, turned to a \"pillar of vap or.\"* The \"Evil\" Lot had feared had caught up with her. . . . *The traditional and literal translation of the Heb rew term Netsiv melah has been \"pillar of salt,\" and tracts have be en written in the Middle Ages explaining the process whereby a person could turn into crystalline salt. However, if—as we believe—th e mother tongue of Abraham and Lot was Sumerian. and the eve nt was first recorded not in a Semitic language but in Sumerian. an entirely dif- ferent and more plausible understanding of the fate of Lot's wife be- comes possible. In a paper presented to the American Oriental Socie ty in 1918 and in a followup article in Beitrage zur Assyriologie, Paul Haupt had shown conclusively that because the early sources o f salt in Sumer were swamps near the Persian Gulf, the Sumerian ter m NIMUR branched off to mean both salt and vapor. Because th e Dead Sea has been called, in Hebrew, The Salt Sea. the biblical Hebrew narrator probably misinterpreted the Sumerian term and wrote \"pillar of salt\" when in fact Lot's wife became a \"pillar of v apor.\" In this"},{"pageNumber":317,"pageContent":"314 THE WARS OF CODS AND MEN One by one the cities \"which had outraged the Lord\" were up- heavaled, and each time Lot was allowed to escape: For when the gods devastated the ci tie s of the plai n, the gods remembered Abraham, and sent Lot away out of the upheavaling of the cities. And Lot, as instructed, went on \"to dwell in the mo un- tain . . . and dwelt in a cave, he and his two daug hters with him.\" Having witnessed the fiery destruction of all life in the Jordan plain and the unseen hand of death which vaporized their mother, what were Lot and his daughters to think? They thou ght, we learn from the biblical narrative, that they had witnesse d the end of man- kind upon the Earth, that the three of them were th e sole survivors of the human race; and therefore, the only way to p reserve man- kind was to commit incest and have the daughters co nceive chil- dren by their own father. . . . \"And the elder said unto the younger: \"Our father i s old. and there is not a man on Earth to squire us in the man ner of all on Earth; come, let us make our father drink wine, the n lie down with him. so that we shall preserve the seed of lif e from our fa- ther.' \" And having done so, both became pregnant a nd bore chil- dren.

The year was 2024 B.C. Where are the remains of Sodom and Gomorrah today? An- cient Greek and Roman geographers reported that the once- fertile valley of the five cities was inundated fol lowing the catastrophe. Modern scholars believe that the \"uphe avaling\" described in the Bible caused a breach in the south ern shore of the Dead Sea, letting its waters pour through to su bmerge the low-lying region to the south. The remaining portio n of what was once the southern shore became the feature figu ratively called by the natives el-Lissan (\"The Tongue\"), and the once- populated valley with its five cities became a new, southern part of the Dead Sea (Fig. 102) s t i l l bearing the l ocal nickname \"Lot's Sea.\" In the north the outpouring of the wat ers south- ward caused the shoreline to recede. The ancient reports have been confirmed in modern t imes by various researches, beginning with an exhaustive ex ploration of the area in the 1920s by a scientific mission spons ored by the Vati- can's Pontifical Biblical Institute (A. Mallon, Voy age d'Explora- tion au sud-est de la Mer Morte). Leading archaeolo gists, such as W. F. Albright and P. Harland, discovered that sett lements in the mountains around the region were abruptly abandoned in the twenty-first century B . C . and were not reoccupied for several cen- turies thereafter. And to this very day. the water of springs sur- rounding the Dead Sea has been found to be contamin ated with radioactivity, \"enough to induce sterility and alli ed afflictions in any animals and humans that absorbed it over a numb er of years\" (I. M. Blake, \"Joshua's Curse and Elisha's Miracle\" in The Palestine Exploration Quarterly). The cloud of death, rising in the skies from the ci ties of the plain, frightened not only Lot and his daughters bu t also Abraham, and he did not feel safe even in the Hebron mountai ns, some fifty miles away. We are told by the Bible that he pulled up his encamp- ment and moved farther away westward, to reside at Gerar. Also, at no time thereafter did he venture into the Sinai. Even years later, when Abraham's son Isaac wanted to go to Egypt on account of a famine in Canaan, \"Yahweh appeared unt o him and said: 'Go not down to Egypt; dwell in the land whic h I will show"},{"pageNumber":319,"pageContent":"316 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Fig. 102"},{"pageNumber":320,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Holocaust 317 thee.' \" The passage through the Sinai peninsula wa s apparently still unsafe. But why? The destruction of the cities of the plain, we beli eve, was only a sideshow: concurrently, the Spaceport in the Sinai peninsula was also obliterated with nuclear weapons, leaving behi nd a deadly ra- diation that lingered on for many years thereafter. The main nuclear target was in the Sinai peninsula; and the real victim, in the end, was Sumer itself. Though the end of Ur came swiftly, its sad fate loo med darker ever since the War of the Kings, coming nearer and nearer, like the sound of a distant drummer—an execution's drummer—g etting closer, growing louder with each passing year. The Year of Doom—2024 B.C.—was the sixth year of the reign of I bbi-Sin, the last king of Ur; but to find the reasons for the ca lamity, explana- tions of its nature, and details of its scope, we w ill have to study the records of those fateful years back from the time o f that war. Having failed in their mission and twice humiliated by the hand of Abraham—once at Kadesh-Barnea, then again near D amascus— the invading kings were promptly removed from their thrones. In Ur, Amar-Sin was replaced by his brother Shu-Sin, w ho ascended the throne to find the grand alliance shattered and Ur's erstwhile al- lies now nibbling at her crumbling empire. Although they, too, had been discredited by the War of the Kings, Nannar and Inanna were at first the gods in whom Shu-Sin had put his trust. It was Nannar, Shu-Sin's early i nscriptions stated, who had \"called his name\" to kingship; he w as \"beloved of Inanna.\" and she herself presented him to Nannar (Fig. 103).

Judging from the date formulas—annual inscriptions, for royal as well as commercial and social purposes, in which each succes- sive year of a king's reign was designated by the m ajor event of that year—Shu-Sin, in the second year of his reign, sought the favors of Enki by constructing for that god a speci al boat that could navigate the high seas all the way to the Lower Wor ld. The third year of reign was also one of preoccupation with th e pro-Enki alignment. Little else is known of this effort, whi ch could have been a roundabout way of pacifying the followers of Marduk and Nabu; but the effort evidently failed, for the four th and fifth years witnessed the building of a massive wall on the wes tern frontier of Mesopotamia, specifically aimed at warding off incu rsions by the \"Westerners.\" followers of Marduk. As the pressures from the west kept rising, Shu-Sin turned to the great gods of Nippur for forgiveness and salvation. The date for- mulas, confirmed by the archaeological excavations of the Ameri- can Expedition to Nippur, reveal that Shu-Sin under took massive reconstruction works at Nippur's sacred precinct, o n a scale un- known since the days of Ur-Nammu. The works culmina ted with the raising of a stela honoring Enlil and Ninlil, \" a stela as no king had built before.\" Desparately Shu-Sin sought accep tance, confir- mation that he was \"the king whom Enlil, in his hea rt, had chosen.\" But Enlil was not there to answer; only Ni nlil, Enlil's spouse, who remained in Nippur, heard Shu-Sin's sup plications. Responding with compassion, \"so as to prolong the w ell-being of Shu-Sin, to extend the time of his crown,\" she gave him a \"weapon which with radiance strikes down . . . whos e awesome flash reaches the sky.\" A Shu-Sin text catalogued as \"Collection B\" suggest s that in his efforts to reestablish the olden links with Nippur, Shu-Sin may have attempted a reconciliation with the Nippurites (such as the family of Terah) who had left Ur after the death of Ur-Nammu. The text states that after he made the region where Harran was situ- ated \"tremble in awe of his weapons,\" a peace gestu re was made: Shu-Sin sent there his own daughter as a bride (pre sumably to the region's chief or his son). She then returned to Su mer with an en-"},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Holocaust 319 touragc of that region's citizens, \"establishing a town for Enlil and Ninlil on the boundary of Nippur.\" It was the first time \"since the days when fates were decreed, that a king had estab lished a town for Enlil and Ninlil,\" Shu-Sin stated in obvious ex pectation of praise. With the probable assistance of the repatri ated Nippurites, Shu-Sin also reinstated the high temple services at Nippur- bestowing upon himself the role and title of High P riest. Yet all this was to no avail. Instead of greater se curity, there were greater dangers, and concern about the loyalty of distant provinces gave way to worry about Sumer's own terri tory. \"The mighty king, the King of Ur,\" Shu-Sin's inscription s said, found that the \"shepherding of the land\"—of Sumer itself— had become the principal royal burden. There was one final effort to entice Enlil back to Sumer, to find shelter under his aegis. On the apparent advice of Ninlil, Shu-Sin built for the divine couple \"a great touring boat, fit for the largest rivers. ... He decorated it perfectly with precious stones,\" outfitted it with oars made of the finest wood, pun ting poles and an artful rudder, and furnished it with all manner of comfort including a bridal bed. He then \"placed the touring boat in t he wide basin facing Ninlil's House of Pleasure.\" The nostalgic aspects struck a chord in Enlil's hea rt, for he had fallen in love with Ninlil, when she was still a yo ung nurse, when he saw her bathing naked in the river; and he did c ome back to Nippur: When Enlil heard [all this) From horizon to horizon he hurried. From south to north he travelled; Through the skies, over earth he hurried. To greatly rejoice with his beloved queen, Ninlil. The sentimental journey, however, was only a brief interlude. Some crucial lines before the end of the tablet are missing, so we are deprived of the details of what happened then. But the very last lines refer to \"Ninurta, the great warrior of Enlil , who befuddled the Intruder,\" apparently after \"an inscription, an evil inscrip- tion\" was discovered on an effigy in the boat, inte nded perhaps to place a curse on Enlil and N i n l i l . There is no record available of Enlil's reaction to the foul play: but all other evidence suggests that he again left Nippur, this time apparently taking Ninlil with him."},{"pageNumber":323,"pageContent":"320 THE WARS OF CODS AND MEN Soon thereafter—February 2031 B . C . by our calendar—the Near East was awed by a total lunar eclipse, which black ed out the moon during the night tor its full course from horizon t o horizon. The or- acle priests of Nippur could not allay Shu-Sin's an xiety: It was. they said in their written message, an omen \"to the king who rules the four regions: his wall will be destroyed. Ur wi ll become deso- late.\" Rejected by the great olden gods. Shu-Sin engaged i n one final act—either out of defiance or as a last straw to ga in divine support. He went ahead and built—in the very sacred precinct of Nippur—a shrine to a young god named Shara. He was a son of Inanna; and like Lugalbanda. who bore this epithet in earlier d ays, so was this new Shara (\"Prince\") a son of a king; in the inscri ption dedicating the temple. Shu-Sin claimed that he was the young g od's father: \"To divine Shara. heavenly hero, the beloved son of Inanna: His father Shu-Sin. the powerful king, king of Ur. king of the four re- gions, has built for him the temple Shagipada. his beloved shrine; may the king have life.\" It was the ninth year of S hu-Sin's reign. It was also his last. The new ruler on the throne of Ur, Ibbi-Sin, could not stop the retreat and retrenchment. All he could do was rush the construction of walls and fortifications in the heart of Sumer, around Ur and Nippur; the rest of the country was left unprotecte d. His own date formulas, of which none have been found beyond his fifth year (al- though he reigned longer), tell l i t t l e of the circu mstances of his days; much more is learned from the cessation of ot her customary messages and trade documents. Thus, the messages of loyalty, which the other subordinate urban centers were expe cted to send to Ur each year, ceased to arrive from one center afte r the other. First to cease were the loyalty messages from the western districts: then, in the t h i r d year, the capitals of eastern province s stopped their dis- patch. In that third year Ur's foreign commerce \"st opped with a significant suddenness\" (in the words of C. J. Gadd , History and Monuments of Ur). At the tax collection crossroads of Drehem (near Nippur), where shipments of goods and cattle and the collec- tion of taxes thereon were recorded throughout the Third Dynasty of Ur—records of which thousands of intact clay tab lets were found—the meticulous account-keeping also stopped a bruptly in that third year. Ignoring Nippur, whose great gods had left her, Ibb i-Sin put his trust again in Nannar and Inanna, i n s t a l l i n g himsel f in his second year as High Priest of Inanna's temple in Uruk. Rep eatedly he"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Holocaust 321 asked for guidance and reassurance from his gods; b ut all he was hearing were oracles of destruction and doom. In th e fourth year of his reign he was told that \"The Son in the west wil l arise . . . it is an omen for Ibbi-Sin: Ur shall be judged.\" In the fifth year, Ibbi-Sin sought further strength by becoming High Priest of Inanna at her shrine at Ur. But that , too, was of no help: that year, the other cities of Sumer itself c eased sending the messages of allegiance. It was also the last year i n which those cities delivered the traditional sacrificial animal s for Nannar's tem- ple in Ur. The central authority of Ur, her gods, a nd her great ziggurat-temple were no longer recognized. As the sixth year began, the omens \"concerning dest ruction\" became more urgent and more specific. \"When the six th year comes, the inhabitants of Ur will be trapped,\" one omen stated. The prophesied calamity shall come, another omen sa id, \"When, for the second time, he who calls himself Supreme, like one whose chest has been anointed, shall come from the west.\" That very year, as messages from the borders reveal, \"hostile Westerners had entered the plain\" of Mesopotamia; without resi stance, they quickly \"entered the interior of the country, takin g one by one all the great fortresses.\" All Ibbi-Sin held on to was the enclave of Ur and N ippur; but before the fateful sixth year was out, the inscript ions honoring the king of Ur stopped abruptly also in Nippur. The ene my of Ur and her gods, the \"One who calls himself Supreme,\" had reached the heart of Sumer. Marduk, as the omens had predicted, returned to Bab ylon for the second time. The twenty-four fateful years—since Abraham left Ha rran, since Shulgi was replaced on the throne, since Marduk's e xile among the Hittites had begun—have all converged in that Year of Doom, 2024 B.C. Having followed the separate, but interco nnected, bibli- cal tale of Abraham and the fortunes of Ur and its last three kings, we will now follow in the footsteps of Marduk. The tablet on which Marduk's autobiography is inscr ibed (from which we have already partly quoted) continues to r elate his return to Babylon after the twenty-four years of sojourn i n the Land of Hatti: In Hatti-land I asked an oracle [about] my throne and my Lordship;"},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"322 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN In its midst [I asked]: \"Until when?\" 24 years, in its midst, I nested.

The few legible c ity names indi- cate that Marduk's route from Asia Minor to Mesopot amia took him first south to the city of Hama (the biblical H amat), then eastward via Mari (see map, page 304). He had indee d come to Mesopotamia—as the omens had predicted—from the wes t, ac- companied by Amorite (\"Westerners\") supporters. His wish. Marduk continued, was to bring peace and prosperity to the land, \"chase away evil and bad luck . . . br ing motherly love to Mankind.\" But it all came to naught: Agains t his city, Bab- ylon, an adversary god \"his wrath had brought.\" The name of this adversary god is stated at the very beginning of a new column of the text; but all that has remained of it is the fi rst syllable: \"Divine NIN-.\" The reference could have been only to Ninurt a. We learn little from this tablet of the actions tak en by this adver- sary, for all the subsequent verses are badly damag ed and the text becomes unintelligible. But we can pick up some of the missing threads from the third tablet of the Khedorlaomer l exis. In spite of its enigmatic aspects, it paints a picture of total turmoil, with ad- versary gods marching against each other at the hea d of their hu- man troops: the Amorite supporters of Marduk swoope d down the"},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Holocaust 323 Euphrates valley toward Nippur, and Ninurta organiz ed Elamite troops to fight them. As we read and reread the record of those trying ti mes, we find that to accuse an enemy of atrocities is not a mode rn innovation. The Babylonian text—written, we must keep bearing i n mind, by a worshiper of Marduk—attributes to the Elamite troop s, and to them alone, the desecration of temples, including t he shrines of Shamash and Ishtar. The Babylonian chronicler goes even farther: he accuses Ninurta of falsely blaming on the follow ers of Marduk the desecration of Enlil's Holy-of-Holies in Nippur , thereby pro- voking Enlil to take sides against Marduk and his s on Nabu. It happened, the Babylonian text relates, when the two opposing armies faced each other at Nippur. It was then that the holy city was despoiled and its shrine, the Ekur, desecrated. Ninurta ac- cused the followers of Marduk of this evil deed; bu t it was not so: it was his ally Erra who had done it! How Nergal/Erra suddenly appears in the Babylonian chronicle will remain a puzzle until we return to the Erra Ep ic; but that this god is named in the Khedorlaomer Texts and is accus ed of the de- filement of the Ekur, there can be no doubt: Erra, the pitiless one, entered the sacred precinct. He stationed himself in the sacred precinct, he beheld the Ekur. His mouth he opened, he said to his young men: \"Carry off the spoil of Ekur, take away its valuables, destroy its foundation, break down the enclosure of the shrine!\" When Enlil, \"loftily enthroned.\" heard that his tem ple had been destroyed, its shrine defiled, that \"in the holy of holies the veil was torn away,\" he rushed back to Nippur. \"Riding in fr ont of him were gods clothed with radiance\"; he himself \"set o ff brilliance like lightning\" as he came down from the skies (Fig . 104); \"he made the holy place shake\" as he descended to the s acred precinct. Enlil then addressed himself to his son, \"the princ e Ninurta.\" to find out who had defiled the sacred place.

But Nabu managed to escape westward, to th e cities faith- ful to him near the Mediterranean Sea: From Ezida . . .

Now there follow verses in the Babylonian text that have a direct parallel in the biblical tale of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah: But when the son of Marduk in the land of the coast was, He-of-the-Evil-Wind [Erra] with heat the plain-land burnt. 324 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN"},{"pageNumber":328,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Holocaust 325 These are indeed verses that must have had a common source with the biblical description of how \"brimstone and fire\" rained from the skies \"upheavaled those cities and the who le plain\"! As biblical statements (e.g.. Deuteronomy 29:22-27) attested. the \"wickedness\" of the cities of the Jordan Plain was that \"they had forsaken the covenant of the Lord . . . and the y went and served other gods.\" As we now learn from the Babylo nian text, the \"outcry\" (accusation) against them was their rallyi ng to the side of Marduk and Nabu in that last clash between the cont ending gods. But whereas the biblical text left it at that, the Babylonian text adds another important detail: The attack on the Canaani te cities was in- tended not only to destroy the centers of support f or Marduk. but also to destroy Nabu. who had sought asylum there. However, that second aim was not achieved, for Nabu managed to sl ip out in time and escaped to an island in the Mediterranean, wher e the people accepted him although he was not their god: He [Nabu] the great sea entered. Sat upon a throne which was not his [Because] Ezida, the legitimate abode, was overrun. The picture that can be gathered from the biblical and Babylo- nian texts of the cataclysm that engulfed the ancie nt Near East in the time of Abraham is much more fully detailed in The Erra Epic (to which we have already referred earlier). First pieced together from fragments found in the library of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, the Assyrian text began to take shape and meaning a s more frag- mented versions were unearthed at other archaeologi cal sites. By now it is definitely established that the text was inscribed on five tablets: and in spite of breaks, missing or incompl ete lines, and even some disagreement among the scholars where som e frag- ments belong, two extensive translations have been compiled: Das Era-Epos by P. F. Gossmann, and L'Epopea di Erra by L. Cagni. The Erra Epic not only explains the nature and caus es of the con- flict that had led to the unleashing of the Ultimat e Weapon against inhabited cities and the attempt to annihilate a go d (Nabu) believed hiding therein. It also makes clear that such an ex treme measure was not taken lightly. We know from several other texts that the great god s, at that time of acute crisis, were sitting in a continuous Council of War, keeping constant communication with Anu: \"Anu to Ea rth the words was speaking, Earth to Anu the words pronounc ed.\" The"},{"pageNumber":329,"pageContent":"326 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN Erra Epic adds the information that before the awes ome weapons were used, one more confrontation had taken place b etween Nergal/Erra and Marduk. in which Nergal used threat s to persuade his brother to leave Babylon and give up his claims to Supremacy. But this time, persuasion failed; and back at the C ouncil of the Gods, Nergal voiced the recommendation for the use of force to dislodge Marduk. We learn from the texts that the d iscussions were heated and acrimonious; \"for one day and one night, without ceasing\" they went on. An especially violent argume nt developed between Enki and his son Nergal, in which Enki stoo d by his firstborn son: \"Now that Prince Marduk has arisen, now that the people for the second time have raised his image, w hy does Erra continue his opposition?\" Enki asked. Finally, losi ng his patience, Enki shouted at Nergal to get out of his presence. Leaving in a huff, Nergal returned to his domain. \" Consulting with himself,\" he decided to unleash the awesome we apons: \"The lands I will destroy, to a dust-heap make them; the cities I will up- heaval, to desolation turn them; the mountains I wi ll flatten, their animals make disappear; the seas I will agitate, th at which teems in them I will decimate; the people I will make vanish , their souls shall turn to vapor; none shall be spared. . . .\" We learn from a text known as CT-xvi-44/46 that it was Gibil, whose domain in Africa adjoined that of Nergal, who alerted Mar- duk to the destructive scheme hatched by Nergal. It was nighttime, and the great gods had adjourned for rest. It was t hen that Gibil \"these words to Marduk did speak\" in regard to the \"seven awe- some weapons which by Anu were created; . . . The w ickedness of those seven against thee is being laid.\" he info rmed Marduk. Alarmed, Marduk inquired of Gibil where the awesome weapons were kept. \"O Gibil,\" he said, \"those seven—where w ere they born, where were they created?\" To which Gibil reve aled that they were hidden underground: Those seven, in the mountain they abide. In a cavity inside the earth they dwell. From this place with a brilliance they will rush fo rth. From Earth to Heaven, clad with terror. But where exactly is this place?

To his surprise, not all the other gods were as shocked as he was. Enki spoke out strongly against the idea, urging steps to stop Ner gal, for the use of the weapons, he pointed out, \"the lands would make desolate, the people will make perish.\" Nannar and Utu wavered as Enki spoke; but Enlil and Ninurta were for decisive acti on. And so, with the Council of the Gods in disarray, the decision w as left to Anu. When Ninurta finally arrived in the Lower World wit h word of Anu's decision, he found out that Nergal had alread y ordered the priming of \"the seven awesome weapons\" with their \" poisons\"— their nuclear warheads. Though the Erra Epic keeps referring to Ninurta by the epithet Ishum (\"The Scorcher\"), it r elates in great detail how Ninurta had made clear to Nergal/Erra th at the weapons could be used only against specifically approved ta rgets; that be- fore they could be used, the Anunnaki gods at the s elected sites and the Igigi gods manning the space platform and the s huttlecraft had to be forewarned; and, last but not least, mankind had to be spared, for \"Anu, lord of the gods, on the land had pity.\" At first Nergal balked at the very idea of forewarn ing anyone, and the ancient text goes to some length to relate the tough words exchanged between the two gods. Nergal then agreed to giving ad- vance warning to the Anunnaki and Igigi who manned the space fa- cilities, but not to Marduk and his son Nabu, nor t o the human followers of Marduk. It was then that Ninurta, atte mpting to dis- suade Nergal from indiscriminate annihilation, used words iden- tical to those attributed in the Bible to Abraham w hen he tried to have Sodom spared: Valiant Erra, Will you the righteous destroy with the unrighteous ? Will you destroy those who have against you sinned together with those who against you have not sinned ? Employing flattery, threats, and logic, the two god s argued back and forth on the extent of the destruction.

Employing diplomacy, poi nting out the injustice of indiscriminate destruction—and the strategic merits of selective targeting—the words of Ninurta finally swayed Nergal. \"He heard the words spoken by Ishum [Ninurta]: the words ap- pealed to him as fine oil.\" Agreeing to leave alone the seas, to leave Mesopotamia out of the attack, he formulated a modified plan: the destruction will be selective: the tactic al aim will be to de- stroy the cities where Nabu might be hiding: the st rategic aim will be to deny to Marduk his greatest prize—the Spacepo rt, \"the place from where the Great Ones ascend\": From city to city an emissary I will send; The son, seed of his father, shall not escape; His mother shall cease her laughter . . . To the place of the gods, access he shall not have: The place from where the Great Ones ascend I shall upheaval. When Nergal finished presenting this latest plan, i nvolving as it did the destruction of the Spaceport, Ninurta was s peechless. But, as other texts assert, Enlil approved the plan when it was brought to his decision; so also, apparently, did Anu. Wasting no more time, Nergal then urged Ninurta that the two of them go a t once into ac- tion: Then did the hero Erra go ahead of Ishum, remembering his words; Ishum too went forth, in accordance with the word g iven, a squeezing in his heart. Their first target was the Spaceport, its command c omplex hid- den in the \"Mount Most Supreme,\" its landing fields spread in the adjoining great plain: Ishum to Mount Most Supreme set his course; The Awesome Seven, [weapons] without parallel, trailed behind him.

It was a d estructive feat, the written record attests, performed by Ninurta (I shum). Now it was the turn of Nergal (Erra) to give vent t o his vow of vengeance. Guiding himself from the Sinai peninsula to the Ca- naanite cities by following the King's Highway, Err a upheavaled them. The words employed by the Erra Epic are almos t identical to those used in the biblical tale of Sodom and Gomorr ah: Then, emulating Ishum, Erra the King's Highway followed. The cities he finished off, to desolation he overturned them. In the mountains he caused starvation, their animals he made perish.

That which lives in it, even the crocodiles he made wither. As with fire he scorched the animals, banned its grains to become as dust. The Erra Epic thus encompasses all the three aspect s of the nu- clear event: the obliteration of the Spaceport in t he Sinai; the \"overturning\" (\"upheavaling\" in the Bible) of the c ities of the Jordan plain; and the breach in the Dead Sea result ing in its exten- sion southward.

It is thus undoubtedly o ne of the earliest texts on the subject; and its wording indeed gives the impression that it is this or similar Sumerian originals that had served as a source for the biblical narrative. Addressed to a g od whose identity is not clear from the fragment, it says: Lord, bearer of the Scorcher that burnt up the adversary; Who obliterated the disobedient land; Who withered the life of the Evil Word's followers; Who rained stones and fire upon the adversaries. The deed performed by the two gods Ninurta and Nerg al, when the Anunnaki guarding the Spaceport, forewarned, ha d to escape by \"ascending to the dome of heaven,\" was recalled in a Babylo- nian text in which one king recalled the momentous events that had taken place \"in the reign of an earlier king.\" Here are the king's words: At that time, in the reign of a previous king, conditions changed. Good departed, suffering was regular. The Lord [of the gods] became enraged, he conceived wrath. He gave the command: the gods of that place abandoned it . . .

There has been no explanation for the colossal scar in the face of the Sinai peninsula since it was observed from the skies and photo- graphed by NASA satellites. There has been no expla nation for the blackened bits and pieces of rock strewn over the a rea in the central plain. No explanation—unless one reads the verses o f the ancient texts and accepts our conclusion that in the days o f Abraham. Nergal and Ninurta wiped out the Spaceport that was there with nuclear weapons: \"That which was raised towards Anu to launch they caused to wither, its face they made fade away , its place they made desolate.\" And the Spaceport, even the Evil Cities, were no mo re. Far away to the west, in Sumer itself, the nuclear blasts and their brilliant flashes were neither felt nor seen. But t he deed done by Nergal and Ninurta had not gone unrecorded, for it turned out to have had a most profound effect on Sumer, its people, and its very existence.

And then the radioactive whirlwind began to spread and move westward with the prevailing winds blowing from the Mediterra- nean; soon thereafter, the omens predicting the end of Sumer came true; and Sumer itself became the ultimate nuclear victim.

When the first lamentation tablets were found, the scholars be- lieved that Ur alone suffered destruction, and they titled the trans- lations accordingly. But as more texts were discove red, it was realized that Ur was neither the only city affected , nor the focal point of the catastrophe. Not only were similar lam entations found bewailing the fate of Nippur, Uruk, Eridu, but some of the texts also provided lists of the affected cities: they ap peared to begin in the southwest and extend to the northeast, encompas sing the whole of southern Mesopotamia. It became apparent that a general, sud- den, and concurrent catastrophe had befallen all th e cities—not in slow succession, as would happen in the case of a p rogressive inva- sion, but all at once. Such scholars as Th. Jacobse n (The Reign of Ibbi-Sin) then concluded that the \"barbarian inv aders\" had nothing to do with the \"dire catastrophe,\" a calami ty he called \"really quite puzzling.\" \"Whether we shall ever see with full clarity what h appened in those years,\" Jacobsen wrote, \"only time will tell; the full story, we are convinced, is still far beyond our grasp.\" But the puzzle can be solved, and the full story gr asped, if we relate the catastrophe in Mesopotamia to the nuclea r explosion in the Sinai. The texts, remarkable for their length and in many instances also in excellent state of preservation, usually begin b y bewailing the abrupt abandonment of all of Sumer's sacred precinc ts by their var- ious gods, their temples \"abandoned to the wind.\" T he desolation caused by the catastrophe is then described vividly , by such verses as these: Causing cities to be desolated, [causing] houses to become desolate; Causing stalls to be desolate, the sheepfolds to be emptied; That Sumer's oxen no longer stand in their stalls, that its sheep no longer roam in its sheepfolds; That its rivers flow with water that is bitter, that its cultivated fields grow weeds, that its steppes grow withering plants."},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"336 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN in the cities and the hamlets.

To scholars who had not yet com e face-to-face with the awesomeness of nuclear weapons, the Sumeri an lamenta- tion texts bespoke (as the scholars titled them) th e \"Destruction of Ur\" or the \"Destruction of Sumer.\" But that is not what these texts describe: they describe desolation, not destr uction. The cities were there but without people; the stalls were ther e but without cat- tle; the shcepfolds remained but were empty; the ri vers flowed but their waters became bitter; the fields still stretc hed but they grew only weeds; and on the steppe the plants sprouted, only to wither away. Invasion, war, killing—all those evils were well kn own to man- kind by then; but. as the lamentation texts clearly state, this one was unique and never experienced before: On the Land [Sumer] fell a calamity, one unknown to man: One that had never been seen before, one which could not be withstood. The death was not by the hand of an enemy; it was a n unseen death, \"which roams the street, is let loose in the road; it stands beside a man—yet none can see it; when it enters a house, its ap- pearance is unknown.\" There was no defense against this \"evil which has assailed the land like a ghost: . , .

The text known as Lamentation Over the Destruction of Ur lis ts all the great gods and some of their important sons and daughters who had \"abandoned to the wind\" the cities and great temple s of Sumer. The text called Lamentation Over the Destruction of Sumer and Ur adds dramatic details to this hurried abandonment. Thus. \"Ninhar- sag wept in bitter tears\" as she escaped from Isin; Nanshe cried, \"O my devastated city\" as \"her beloved dwelling pla ce was given over to misfortune.\" Inanna hurriedly departe d from Uruk, sailing off toward Africa in a \"submersible ship\" a nd complaining that she had to leave behind her jewelry and other posses- sions. ...

A breathtaking description of the fear and confusio n, among gods and men alike, as the Evil Wind approached is given in The Uruk Lament text, which was written years later as the time of Res- toration came. As the \"loyal citizens of Uruk were seized with terror,\" the resident deities of Uruk, those in cha rge of the city's administration and welfare, set off an alarm. \"Rise up!\" they called to the people in the middle of the night; ru n away, \"hide in the steppe!\" they instructed them.

Who caused such worry and lame ntation?\" But their questions remained unanswered; and when t he Evil Storm passed over, \"the people were piled up in heaps ... a hush settled over Uruk like a cloak.\" Ninki, we learn from The Eridu Lament, flew away fr om her city to a safe haven in Africa: \"Ninki, its great l ady, flying like a bird, left her city.\" But Enki left Eridu only far enough to get out of the Evil Wind's way, yet near enough to see its fate: \"Its lord stayed outside his city .... Father Enki stayed out side the city . . . for the fate of his harmed city he wept with bitter tears.\" Many of his loyal subjects followed him, camping on its outskirts. For a day and a night they watched the storm \"put i ts hand\" on Eridu. After the \"evil-bearing storm went out of the city, sweeping across the countryside.\" Enki surveyed Eridu; he fo und a city \"smothered with silence ... its residents stacked u p in heaps.\" Those who were saved addressed to him a lament: \"O Enki,\" they cried, \"thy city has been cursed, made like an alien terri- tory!\" and they kept on asking whence should they g o, what should they do.

Nannar ad dressed a long and emotional appeal to his father Enlil, seeking s ome means to avert the calamity. But \"Enlil answered his son Sin \" that the fate could not be changed: Ur was granted kingship- it was not granted an eternal reign. Since days of yore, when Sumer was founded, to the present, when people have multiplied— Who has ever seen a kingship of everlasting reign? While the appeals were made, Ningal recalled in her long poem, \"the storm was ever breaking forward, its howling o verpowering all.\" It was daytime when the Evil Wind approached Ur: \"al- though of that day I still tremble,\" Ningal wrote, \"of that day's foul smell we did not flee.\" As night came, \"a bitt er lament was raised\" in Ur; yet the god and goddess stayed on; \" of that night's foulness we did not flee,\" the goddess stated. Then the affliction reached the great ziggurat of Ur, and Ningal realiz ed that Nannar \"had been overtaken by the evil storm.\" Ningal and Nannar spent a night of nightmare, which Ningal vowed never to forget, in the \"termite house\" (unde rground chamber) within the ziggurat. Only next day. when \" the storm was carried off from the city.\" did \"Ningal, in order t o go from her city . . . hastily put on a garment,\" and together with the stricken Nannar departed from the city they so loved. As they were leaving they saw death and desolation: \"the peo- ple, like potsherds, filled the city's streets; in its lofty gates, where they were wont to promenade, dead bodies were lying about; in its boulevards, where the feasts were celebrated, scatt ered they lay; in"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"342 THE WARS OF GODS AND MEN all of its streets, where they were wont to promena de, dead bodies were lying about; in its places where the land's fe stivities took place, the people lay in heaps.\" The dead were not brought to buri- al: \"the dead bodies, like fat placed in the sun, o f themselves melted away.\" Then did Ningal raise her great lamentation for Ur, the once- majestic city, head city of Sumer, capital of an em pire: O house of Sin in Ur, bitter is thy desolation . . .

The hum of the turning churn resounds not in the sheepfold. . . . The stalls provide not fat and cheese. . . .

But instead of an empire ruling others, Sumer itself was now an occupied land, with a semblance of order maintained by Elamite troops in the south and Gutian soldiers in the north. Isin, a city never a capital before, was selected a s a temporary administrative center, and a former governor of Mar i was brought over to rule the land. Documents from that time rec orded a com- plaint that one \"who is not of Sumerian seed\" was g iven the reins over Sumer. As his Semitic name—lshbi-Erra—attested , he was a follower of Nergal, and his appointment must have b een part of the arrangement between Nergal and Ninurta.

A year or two later lshbi-Erra sought to add the ce ntral religious au- thority to his powers by assuming the guardianship of Nippur, raising there the sacred emblems of Enlil and Ninurta. But the permission for that came from Ninurta alone, and the great gods of Nippur remained aloof and alienated. Seeking other support. Ishhi-E rra appointed priests and priestesses to restore the worship of N annar. Ningal. and Inanna. But it seems that the hearts of the people belonged elsewhere: as numerous Shurpu (\"Purification\") texts suggest, it was Enki and Marduk—using Enki's immense scientific knowledge (\" magical powers\" in the eyes of the people)—who cured the af flicted, purified the waters, and made the soil grow edible vegetatio n again.

In a long poem of twelve stanzas dedicated to Nippur, he described how its divine couple responded to his appeals to r estore the city and its great temple, so that \"Nippur's brickwork b e restored\" and \"the divine tablets be returned to Nippur.\" There was great jubilation in the land when the gre at temple was rededicated to Enlil and Ninlil. in the year 1953 B .C.: it was only then that the cities of Sumer and Akkad were offici ally declared habitable again. The official return to normalcy, however, only serv ed to stir up old rivalries among the gods. The successor to Ishm e-Dagan bore a name indicating his allegiance to Ishtar.
