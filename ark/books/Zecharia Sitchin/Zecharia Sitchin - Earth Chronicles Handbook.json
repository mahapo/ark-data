The series is based on the author’s study of Sumerian tablets as well as other ancient texts, of which he is one of the world’s leading authorities, and shows that the myths from the world’s earliest civiliza- tions were in fact recollections of actual events and that the gods of ancient peo- ples were visitors to Earth from another planet — the Anunnaki, inhabitants of planet Nibiru. The series’ books include The 12th Planet, The Stairway to Heaven, The Wars of Gods and Men, The Lost Realms, When Time Began, The Cosmic Code, and The End of Days, all prod- ucts of the author’s decades of research and unmatched study of the Bible and of the ancient records of Sumer, Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt, and the civilizations of pre-Columbian America. Unearthing the hidden history of Earth and man- kind, the series — totaling more than 2,300 pages — uses the Past to unveil the meaning of the prophesied Future.

Proverbs 9:1 The seven books that comprise The Earth Chronicles began neither as a pre- conceived series nor even as a book. As an oak tree with seven branches, its acorn seed was a schoolboy’s query why a word in the Hebrew Bible — Nefilim — that derives from the verb meaning To Fall, To Come Down, was translated ‘Giants’. The schoolboy was I; the word is in Genesis chapter 6; the search for an explanation lasted a lifetime; the answer required — as the Bible itself does — going back to the Beginning. The quest for the biblical Beginning opened a Pandora’s Box filled with countless more questions. Why does the Bible describe the Nefilim as “sons of the gods” who chose wives from among the “daughters of the Adam”? Who were the Elohim who had fashioned The Adam in their image? Was there a Garden of Eden, and if yes, where and what was it? Was there a Deluge, was there a Noah, and if yes, who was he? How did Mankind learn how the Heavens, the Earth, and Man himself had been created? What scientific knowledge had existed in antiquity — indeed, how did Civilization itself begin? Was there a kingdom in a land called (in the Bible) Shine’ar that preceded ancient Babylon, Assyria, Egypt? And how did other civilizations arise around the world with uncanny similarities to the olden ones? Unavoidably, the quest spread from Bible to archaeology. There was 1"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"2 Introduction indeed a Cradle of Civilization in the ancient Near East; its monuments, artifacts, and written records unfolded a vivid history of lands and peoples whose tales of gods of heaven and Earth led through mythology to religion, from astronomy to genetics. Before long, what began as a simple question mushroomed to embrace virtually every scholarly discipline, ranging from the depths of Earth to the Solar System and Outer Space, from the Past to the Future, from the Beginning to the End of Days. As one book followed another, spanning the continents, diverse cultures and even different religions, it became evident that these were all branches of the same one tree. A Global Theory emerged, and the tales of gods and men were rendered in my books as a unified history of Earth and Mankind. The pantheons of Greece and Rome, of Aztecs and Hindus are identified as those of Sumer and Babylon; the Mayan and Olmec calendars are compared to those of Assyria and Egypt; Inca tales of creation or a day the sun stood still echo the Hebrew Bible; pyramids and massive stone circles in varied lands reveal a basic kinship. It all makes sense because it explains the other- wise inexplicable, by my unique assertion that there is one more planet in our solar system which periodically nears our vicinity, whose astronauts had come to Earth, fashioned Mankind, were its gods, and when they left prom- ised to return. The result of decades of research, study, and writing is thus daunting in its scope. The seven books of The Earth Chronicles total more than 2,300 pages; and I have often been asked by readers: How does one ‘keep a handle’ on all that mass of information? Guided by readers’ queries, this Handbook is the answer; alphabetically arranged, its hundreds of entries provide the relevant data about gods and demigods, kings and kingdoms, patriarchs and priests, archaeological sites and mythical places. Entries indicate links to related entries, and — when appropriate— add the particular or innovative take of ZS on the subject. By applying a Uniform Answer to the diverse civilizations and periods, this Handbook serves as the first attempt ever to globalize ancient knowledge.

Abraham (According to the Bible, changed from his original name Abram = ‘Beloved Father’ or ‘Father’s Beloved’): The first Hebrew Patriarch, credited with the start of Monotheism, the belief in a sole God — identified in the Bible as ‘ Yahweh According to Genesis, God made a covenant with Abram to grant to his descendants the lands between the Brook of Egypt (a winter stream in the Sinai peninsula) and the Euphrates river in northern Mesopotamia, rewarding him for his unwav- ering fealty to the sole God, and for carrying out an assignment known from Genesis chapter 14 as The War of the Kings. In The Wars of Gods and Men ZS linked those events to ones described in tablets known as the Khedorlamoer Texts, and synchronized the timing and movements of Abram with the chronologies of Mesopotamia and Egypt, leading to the conclusions that Abram was born in 2123 B.C. in Sumer’s religious center Nippur (Ne.Ibru), from which came his identification as Ibri — “A Nippurian” — in the Hebrew Bible, and per ZS, his name Ib.ru. um in Sumerian.

After the destruction of that spaceport with nuclear weapons (recorded in the Bible as the upheavaling of Sodom and Gomorrah) and the resulting demise of Sumer, Abram’s name was changed to the Semitic Abraham ; his spouse’s was changed from Sarai to Sarah , and they had a son, Isaac. They were both buried in Hebron. See Harran, Khedorla’omer Texts, Nippur, Patriarchs, Spaceport, Ur, War of the Kings. Ab.Sin (“Her father is Sin”): The Sumerian name for the zodiacal constel- lation honoring Inanna/Ishtar, the daughter of the god Sin. Our name for it, Virgo (= ‘The Maiden’) goes back to the beginning of the zodia- cal system, when the constellation honored the goddess Ninharsag who never married. The pictorial depiction of the constellation remained unchanged, to this day — that of a beautiful woman. See Inanna.

Achaemenids: A tribal dynasty in Anshan, a province in Elam east of Sumer, whose kings laid the foundations of the Persian empire. They included Cyrus, who captured Babylon in 539 B.C. and decreed the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, Darius I and Xerxes I who invaded Greece in the 5th century B.C., and Darius III who fought the invading Greek army of Alexander the Great in the 4th century B.C.

Adab: An early Sumerian city. Adad (also Hadad ): Enlil’s youngest son (the Sumerian Ishkur) whose main domain was mountainous Anatolia (today’s Turkey) — the land of the Hittites, who called him ‘Teshub’ (= ‘Wind Stormer’) and depicted him with his weapon, a lightning bolt, standing upon a bull (his ‘cult animal’). After the Deluge he was sent to supervise the mining of gold and tin in South America, where his presence was recorded by his carved image on the ‘Gate of the Sun’ in Tiahuanacu (now in Bolivia) and of his emblem on a mountainside in the Bay of Paracas (now in Peru). Canaanite texts called him simply Baal (= Lord), master of the ‘Landing Place’ in the Lebanon mountains. See Baalbek, Hittites, Storm God. Adam : (From H Adamah = Earth), so literally (H) ‘He of the Earth’ — Earthling. The creation tale in Genesis refers to him as The Adam, a new species of intelligent being fashioned by the Elohim (a plural term) who said “let us fashion the Adam in our image and after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26). Sumerian creation tales attributed the feat to the god Enki and the birth-goddess Ninharsag following a decision of the Anunnaki to create a ‘Primitive Worker’ ( Lulu amelu) by genetic engineering — combining their genes with those of a hominid that had already existed on Earth. The Bible then uses ‘Adam’ as the personal name of the progenitor, with his wife Eve, of the line of Mankind’s ante- diluvial patriarchs. ZS has suggested that the biblical tale, and more so its Sumerian antecedents, provide the ‘Missing Link’ in human evolution. Adapa: “The wisest of men,” a son of Enki by an Earthling woman who was the first human to be given knowledge — writing, mathematics and astronomy. According to a text known as ‘The Epic of Adapa’, he was the first Earthling to journey to Nibiru, to be presented to Anu. Enki made sure Adapa would return to Earth without the longevity of the Anunnaki.

She witnessed the departure of Sin from Earth and his eventual return — miraculous events that were recorded by Adda-Guppi and Nabuna’id on four stone columns erected in the god’s temple. (Nabuna’id turned out to be the last king of Babylon). See Ehulhul, Harran, Nabunaid, Sin. Aditi, Adityas: In the Hindu tales of the gods, the initial seven great gods of the Hindu pantheon, sons of the god Kasyapa and the goddess Aditi— among them Vishnu, Varuna, Rudra and Indra. In time, as in the Greek tales of the gods, they were joined by five more to form the twelve mem- bers of the divine clan that became dominant after several generations of competing and warring gods. In those wars, magical weapons were used in aerial battles. See Aerial Battles, God/gods. Admonitions of IPU-WER: The name given to an ancient Egyptian papy- rus whose long hieroglyphic text contains prophetic sections about a coming time of troubles and tribulations, a kind of messianic birth pangs leading to the appearance of a Redeemer who will usher an idyllic era. The title given to this text comes from the fact that it includes a series of admonitions to those who have abandoned religious practices, includ- ing a call for them to repent and be baptized. The papyrus purports to prophecy in the 26th century B.C. about events in the 22nd century B.C.; some scholars believe that it was in fact written after the described events. Aerial Battles: Various ancient texts describe aerial battles of the gods, the oldest of them being the Sumerian ‘Tale of Zu’ in which a god called Zu (or An.Zu according to recently discovered text fragments) betrayed the trust of Enlil and stole the ‘Tablets of Destinies’ that were essential to the operation of Mission Control Center in Nippur. The tablets were eventually retrieved after Zu was defeated in an aerial battle with the god Ninurta. An Egyptian text known as ‘The Contending of Horus and Seth’ asserts that the prolonged conflict between these two gods ended only after Horus defeated Seth in an aerial battle over the Sinai peninsula. In Greek tales of the gods, the fierce battles between Zeus and"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Aerial Chariots Ages 9 the monstrous giant Thyphoeus (Typhon) culminated when Zeus, in his Winged Chariot, shot a thunderbolt at the magical aerial contraption of his adversary. Detailed descriptions of aerial battles between the gods — flying in “cloud-borne chariots” — are found in the Hindu Sanskrit texts, such as the Vedas, the Puranas and the Mahabharata. Aerial Chariots: Besides references to and descriptions of aerial chariots in texts dealing with aerial battles (see previous entry), ‘Aerial Chariot’ (Sumerian Mar.gid.da, Akkadian Tiyaritu), ‘Sky Chamber’ (Sumerian Mu), ‘Boat of Heaven’, ‘Divine Black Bird’ (Im.du.gud) and similar terms are used in ancient Near Eastern texts to describe the personal air- craft — as distinct from spacecraft or rocketships (Gir) — of various gods, among them the Mesopotamian Ninurta, Marduk, and Inanna/Ishtar, the Egyptian gods Ra and Thoth, the Canaanite Ba’al and Anat, the Hindu god Indra and his ‘Vimana’. The Assyrian version of the Atra- Hasis tale of the Deluge uses the term rukub ilani (= ‘Divine Chariots’) for the aerial vehicles in which the gods took off to escape the avalanche of water. The Bible, in the tale of the Prophet Elijah’s ascent to heaven uses a term commonly translated ‘Whirlwind’, and in the vision of the Prophet Ezekiel a Merkava = literally ‘chariot’. See also Rocketships, Shem. Africa: The continent that was, “after the Earth was divided,” the domain of Enki and his six sons. See also Lower World. Afterlife: The ancient Egyptian Pharaohs believed that they would attain immortality in an Afterlife — that they would journey, after dying and found worthy when their hearts would be weighed, to the ‘Planet of Millions of Years’ to live happily ever after among the gods. The Journey To The Afterlife was described and illustrated in texts such as the Book Of The Dead and Pyramid Texts. See Journey to the Afterlife. Agade : See Akkad.

The Sumerians, followed by the Babylonians and Assyrians, attached particular significance to Zodiacal Ages (that mathematically lasted 2,160 years each, or 25,960 years in a complete cycle); these numbers co-related with the 432,000 years (120 Sars of 3,600 years each) that— according to the Sumerian King Lists and Berossus— passed from the arrival of the Anunnaki to the Deluge (per ZS, 3,600 years was the mathematical orbital period of Nibiru). The Egyptians divided prehistory and history by dynastic rulers — first divine, then semi-divine, and finally Pharaonic; the priest Manetho stated that the “duration of the world” was 2,160,000 years— exactly (per ZS) 1,000 times the 2,160 years of a zodiacal age. The Mesoamerican Ages consisted of ‘Suns’ of varying lengths, four past and a fifth ‘Sun’ of the Present. Hindu traditions defined the Ages experi- enced by Earth and Mankind as ‘Yugas’ that were precise multiples of the number 432,000 (thus linked to the Sumerian Ages). See Apocalypse, Berossus, History/Cyclical, Manetho, Yugas, Zodiacal Ages. Agga: A king of Kish, a city in Sumer, who was a rival of the famed Gilgamesh, king of Uruk. Agni: A Hindu god, brother of Indra, whose weapon was fiery thunderbolts. Agriculture: Scientific data determined that the cultivation of cereals and then other food crops began circa 10500 B.C. in the ancient Near East, in an area embracing today’s western Syria, eastern Lebanon and north- ern Israel. ZS has pointed out that the modern scientific findings cor- roborate the Sumerian tales of how the gods Enlil and Enki, needing to feed the gods and the remnants of Mankind after the Deluge, used a mountain base as a seed laboratory for the cultivation of crops and animal husbandry; he identified the place as the Baalbek platform in Lebanon. In the Americas, legends also attributed to the gods the intro- duction of maize (corn). See Domestication. Ahaz : An 8th century B.C.

Ahiram (English: Hiram): King of the Phoenician city Tyre who assisted his ally King Solomon in building the Temple in Jerusalem (10th cen- tury B.C.). AH-MOSE (Ahmosis, Amosis in Greek): The founder of ancient Egypt’s 18th dynasty (1570-1352 B.C.) that included the famed Pharaohs Thothmose (THOTH-MES, also written Thothmosis, Tutmosis) I, II, III and IV, the female Pharaoh Hatshepsut, as well as Akhen-Aten and Tut-Ankh-Amen. The royal names were theophoric, the first part being the name of a god (AH, THOTH, etc.) and the second part, MSS (read Mes/Mose/Mosis) meaning ‘issue of, born of’ that god. ZS has suggested that Hatshepsut was the “Pharaoh’s daughter” who raised the biblical Moses , giving him a name ending with MSS (= Mose, Moshe) as was typical of her dynasty. See Hatshepsut, Moses, Sphinx, Thothmes. Akapana: One of the main archaeological features of the ancient site of Tiahuanacu (also spelled Tiwanaku) near the shores of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia. A hill-like structure that some suggest is the remains of a pyramid. Excavations revealed in its interior a series of channels and chambers connected by conduits that suggested to ZS it was a facility for metallurgical processing. See Tiahuanacu. AKHEN-ATEN: The Pharaoh Amenhotep/Amenophus IV who, circa 1379 B.C., introduced in Egypt the worship of the celestial disc called ‘Aten’ — a form of monotheism according to some scholars; per ZS, it was a new name, denoting a Cross, for Nibiru, in line with expectations of its Return into view. In his inscriptions the Pharaoh claimed that he was a god-son, heralding a messianic time. See Aten, Winged Disc. A.ki.ti (= ‘Build [on] Earth Life’): The Sumerian New Year festival whose ceremonies required the reigning city god to leave, disappear, and return in a procession whose seven stations emulated the original space jour- ney from Nibiru to the Seventh Planet (Earth).

The Mesopotamian land adjoining Sumer on the north- west, settled by people whose language — “Akkadian” — is considered the Mother Tongue of all Semitic languages (including Hebrew, Canaanite, Phoenician, Aramaic, Arabic, etc.). A text known as ‘The Legend of Sargon’ relates that, at a time of turmoil in Sumer, the airborne god- dess Inanna/Ishtar, landing in a field, had sex with its gardener, and recommended him to the Anunnaki leadership to be the next king. Titled Sharru-kin (= ‘Trustworthy King’ — from which ‘ Sargon ) — he established circa 2370 B.C. a new capital, Agade (‘Union, United’— from which Akkad), and the united realm was henceforth known as Sumer & Akkad. The Akkadian dynasty, especially during the reign of Sargon’s grandson Naram-Sin, engaged in conquest and warfare at the behest of Inanna/Ishtar, angering the other gods; in 2230 B.C. they terminated the dynasty and obliterated Agade. See Naram-Sin, Sargon of Akkad. Akkadian Prophecies: A group of pro-Marduk cuneiform texts written in Old Babylonian and thus dated to the 22nd century B.C. that describe in apocalyptic terms what is to befall Mankind and even its gods. Listing a variety of wrongs, they predict a time of troubles and tribulations of unheard-of magnitude — divine judgments and punishments coming as natural calamities, overwhelming devastations, wars, toppling of kings and kingdoms, killing of officials and priests, desecration of temples, hunger and mass suffering — leading to the appearance of a Redeemer who will right the wrongs, comfort the people, and bring salvation to all. Underlying this sequence was the view that Past, Present and Future are part of a continuous flow of events manifesting a pre-ordained Destiny; in this particular case, the inevitability of Marduk’s triumph over less worthy gods. See Admonitions of Ipu-Wer, Marduk, Nabu. Alalu: A ruler of the planet Nibiru who was deposed by Anu and escaped to Earth.

During one of Anus visits to Earth, the two wrestled and Alalu bit off Anus ‘manhood’. Ale-woman: Called Siduri in the Epic of Gilgamesh, she was the innkeeper who gave succor and advice to Gilgamesh when he reached the “Sea of the waters of death” on his way to Tilmun (= ‘Land of the Missiles’). ZS has identified the place as the outskirts of Jericho, near the shores of the Dead Sea, and pointed out the parallels to the later biblical tale of the safe haven given the Israelite spies by the ‘Innkeeper-woman’ Rahab in Jericho. Alexander (the Great): The son of the Macedonian king Philip II and queen Olympias who (in 334 B.C) led an army across the Hellespont (now called the Dardanelles) strait separating Europe and Asia Minor, and in a series of battles defeated the army of the Persian king Darius. He conquered Asia from the Mediterranean Sea all the way to India, and Egypt in Africa. Historians consider Alexander’s invasion of Asia a response to previous Persian attacks on Greece; ZS has additionally highlighted the personal motivations of Alexander, stemming from court rumors that his real father was the Egyptian god Amon — making him a demigod and worthy of immortality. This explains why Alexander, after the first inconclusive battle with the Persians, set his course to the oasis of Siwa in Egypt, the site of a famed oracle, seeking confirmation of his divinity. He then proceeded to Babylon, where he paid homage to Amon/Ra/Marduk by entering the great god’s tomb within the Esagil ziggurat. Alexander himself died in Babylon, at age 32, in 323 B.C. Alexandria: A city in Egypt on the Mediterranean coast, built for burying Alexander the Great after his death. It was famed in antiquity as a cen- ter of learning, linked to its great library (which was destroyed, together with its invaluable manuscripts, when it was set on fire by Moslem con- querors in A.D. 642). The city was famous in antiquity for its harbor.

Al Mamoon: The Moslem ruler (‘Caliph’) of Egypt who, in A.D. 830 employed masons, blacksmiths and engineers to tunnel his way into the Great Pyramid in Giza in search of hidden treasure. Slightly miss- ing the original entranceway in the pyramid’s north face, he reached the descending corridor that had been a familiar feature of other pyramids. Then, due to a chance drop of a stone block, his men discovered the unique features in this pyramid’s upper parts— the ‘King’s’ and ‘Queen’s’ chambers and the horizontal and ascending passages leading to them, including the magnificent Grand Gallery. Alphabet, Alphabetic Writing: The first writing system, in Sumer, advanced from pictographs denoting objects or actions to the use of wedgelike (‘cuneiform’) signs to denote syllabic pronunciation. Egyptian writing progressed similarly, but continued to use pictographs (‘hiero- glyphs’) throughout. As a result, both systems required the use by scribes of hundreds of signs. Alphabetic writing, that appeared for the first time in the Sinai peninsula in the mid-second millennium B.C., was the achievement of a genius who switched to a vocal system, choos- ing the simplified pictograph of an object, such as an oxhead [Aluf in Semitic Hebrew) to denote the sound “A,” of a house (Bayit) to denote the sound “B,” and so on. The result was the reduction of the script to an ‘alpha-bet’ of just twenty-two signs. ZS has seen in the timing and location of the alphabet’s invention possible answers to the question: In what language and script did Moses, on Mount Sinai at the time of the Exodus, write down the divine dictation (on just two stone tablets)? (Re the Hebrew Alphabet, see also DNA.) Amalekites: A tribe that blocked the Israelite entry into the Sinai during the Exodus, leading to a fierce battle.

ZS pinpointed the date of that attack as 2041 B.C., equating it with Ur III royal annals (‘Date Formulas’) about Amar-Sin’s military expedition against “rebel lands” in the west. The real target, according to ZS, was the Spaceport in the Sinai, and the principal mission of Abraham was to defend the Spaceport. See Amar.Sin, Spaceport, Tilmun. Amar.Sin (= ‘Seen by Sin’): The third ruler (2047-2039 B.C.) of Sumer’s Third Dynasty of Ur, son of Shulgi, who tried to defend Sumer by mil- itary offensives in the north and the west. He led a punitive military expedition against an alliance of pro-Marduk Canaanite kings, possibly attempting to seize control of the Spaceport in the Sinai. See Amar.Pal, En.shag, Tilmun. Amazon: South America’s immense river, running with its numerous tribu- taries from the Andes mountains in the west to the Atlantic Ocean in the east, mostly through a great rain forest — a distance of more than 2,000 miles. Unnavigable in its deeper jungle parts, the River became a source of reports of lost cities, such as a legendary ‘Akakor’. AMON (Ammon, Amen): An epithet-name, meaning ‘The Unseen’, for the Egyptian god RA. Per ZS, Ra was the Egyptian name of the god whom the Babylonians called Marduk, and the epithet (often in the combined form Ra-Amon), came into usage when Ra/Marduk was exiled from Egypt. ZS has linked the events to the chaotic period in Egypt known as the First Intermediate Period that began circa 2160 B.C. and separated the Old Kingdom from the Middle Kingdom in Egyptian history. Amorites ( Amurru , Martu): A Semitic people inhabiting the lands west of the Euphrates River, now mostly Syria.

Father by his official spouse Antu of Enlil, and by other wives of Ea/Enki and Ninharsag. Though scion of a long line of Nibiruan royalty, he seized the throne by deposing the reigning king Alalu; their enmity reverberated through the ensuing generations. As head of the pantheon, his numerical rank was 60. Per ZS, Anu made at least three recorded visits to Earth — one when it became necessary to launch a full fledged Earth Mission; another after a mutiny of the Anunnaki, when it was decided to create a “Primitive Worker;” and a state visit with Antu circa 4000 B.C. when civilization was granted to Mankind. AN, Annu (Called On in the Bible): The original name of the Egyptian city later known as Heliopolis that was ancient Egypt’s first religious center. Hieroglyphic inscriptions tell that Pharaohs were allowed to enter the Holy of Holies of the city’s great temple once a year to view the “celestial barque” in which the god RA, the son of Ptah, had arrived on Earth from the “Planet of millions of years.” According to Genesis 41, when Joseph was appointed Overseer Over Egypt, the Pharaoh “gave him Assenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the Priest of On, for a wife.” See Ben-Ben. Anakim (H): Commonly translated ‘Giants’; see Anunnaki and Nefilim.

Though it was used in the Bible to denote even a king’s ambassadors, the translation “angels” is taken to mean divine emissaries, commonly depicted as winged beings. In the Bible, a class of angels called Seraphim are described in Isaiah 6 as having six wings each; the two golden Cherubim atop the Ark of the Covenant had four wings each (similar to divine entities protecting the coffin of the Pharaoh Tut-Ankh-Amen). In Mesopotamia, both gods and their emissaries were depicted wearing uniforms with attached wings — per ZS, to indicate their status as astronauts. See Cherubim, Eaglemen, Winged Beings. ANKH: The ancient Egyptian pictographic hieroglyph that looks like a plumbline instrument and means ‘Life’.

Antarctica: The icebound southernmost continent, where the Earth’s south pole is located. Though unknown to Europeans before its dis- covery in 1820, the existence of maps from earlier dates that correctly show the continent, indicates that it was already known in prior eras. ZS has suggested that the Sumerian geographic name Erkallum, usually translated ‘the Great Below’, referred to Antarctica, and was the biblical “Great Deep” where the Deluge or Great Flood began; it was caused, per ZS, by the slippage of the ice shelf off the Antarctic continent, creating an immense tidal wave, a rise in sea levels, and climate change.

Apocalyptic texts, that appeared both in Egypt and in Babylon more than a millen- nium before the biblical ones, admonished the people for religious or social transgressions, and described the coming upheavals and tribula- tions on a global or even cosmic scale; they also predicted the appearance of a Redeemer who will comfort and bring salvation to the masses.

Aratta: A land, distant from Sumer and located beyond mountain ranges, famed for its granaries and jewels — perhaps the ancient Indus Valley metropolis Harappa. It was granted by the Great Anunnaki to the god- dess Ishtar as her domain; but she kept coming back to her preferred city Uruk in Sumer, causing rivalries detailed in a Sumerian epic known as ‘Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta’. See Harappa. Arba (= H ‘Four’): According to the Bible, the previous name of Hebron, “a fortified city” so named after its erstwhile ruler Arba who was “a Great Man of the Anakim.” ZS has pointed out that ‘Great Man’ is a lit- eral rendering in Hebrew of the Sumerian Lu.gal, which meant ‘King’; and Anakim was the Hebrew for Anunnaki. Hebron, accordingly, was originally a stronghold of a demigod called Arba. See Anunnaki, Kings/ Kingship. Archaeoastronomy: The discipline that combines astronomy with archae- ology and enables the dating of ancient monuments by ascertaining their astronomical orientation. First suggested by Sir Norman Lockyer in his 1894 book The Dawn of Astronomy (after his visit to the temples of Athena in Greece), and applied by him to the dating of Egyptian temples and of Stonehenge in Britain.

Ark: A term applied in English both to Noah’s submersible vessel in the biblical tale of the Deluge (H) Tevah ( see Noah’s Ark), and the Ark (H: Aron) of the Covenant, the gold-plated wooden box in which Moses placed the stone tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments [see Ark of the Covenant, Deluge). Ark of the Covenant (El) Aron Ha-Britb: A wooden gilded box constructed according to precise instructions by God to Moses during the Exodus. Topped by two Cherubim fashioned and cast of solid gold whose wings touched, it served as a divine communication device. Unauthorized approach or touching led to death. The Ark, in which Moses deposited the two stone Tablets of the Law from Mount Sinai, accompanied the Israelites throughout the Exodus and played a miraculous role in the cross- ing of the Jordan River. It was finally placed in the Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple built by king Solomon, approachable only by the High Priest. The Ark of the Covenant was gone from its hallowed place when the Babylonians sacked Jerusalem and destroyed the Temple in 587 B.C.; when and how the Ark was gone, has remained a subject of speculation and legend to this day. (An adventure-filled attempt by ZS to unravel the mystery is described by him in The Earth Chronicles Expeditions .) Armageddon: The term, that has come to mean a final and terrible apoc- alypse that will engulf the Earth and its people, comes from the New Testament s Book The Apocalypse of St. John the Divine’ (commonly called Revelation ).

In that final war, Revelation asserts, one of the combatant ‘beasts’ “shall make fire come down from heaven to Earth, in sight of men” — a statement that can be understood as predicting a nuclear explosion. ZS, in The End of Days, places the Armageddon oracle in the context of other prophecies of a Final War (such as that of Gog and Magog by the Prophet Ezekiel) that will precede messi- anic times, and views the 2007 discovery of an ancient mosaic depiction of the Sign of the Fishes at the foot of Mount Megiddo as a clue to the time of the apocalypse.

Ashur (= The One Who Sees’): The great god of the Assyrians and the name by which they called their land {see Assyria) and one of its capi- tals. Adopting the Sumero-Akkadian pantheon, the Assyrians in their texts assigned to him the attributes of Enlil, but often referred to him as though he was Enlil’s son Ninurta. He was depicted as a mature bearded deity wearing the horned helmet of the gods. When Assyria rose to supremacy in the Near East in the first half of the first millen- nium B.C., its military campaigns and ruthless conquests were asserted by every Assyrian king to have been carried out “on the command of my god Ashur.” See Assyria, Nineveh, Sennacherib, Shalmaneser. Ashurbanipal (Akk.

He boasted that the god of scribes’ “initiated me into the secrets of writing,” including the ability to read Sumerian, and even to understand inscriptions “from the days before the Flood” — the first discovered mention of the Deluge outside the Bible. The subjects in the accumulated tablets covered a wide range, included such masterful texts as the Epic of Gilgamesh (that also told the story of the Deluge), and paid particular attention to celestial information.

Assyria ( Ashur ): A kingdom in the upper region of the Tigris river that was called Subartu in Sumerian times and became the northernmost exten- sion of Sumer & Akkad. In language and racial origins its people — the Assyrians — appear to have had a kinship to Sargon of Akkad, and some of its most famous kings took the name Sharru-kin — Sargon — as their royal name. (The Bible, in Genesis chapter 10, lists Ashur as stemming from the line of Shem.) Religiously, the Assyrians adopted the Sumerian pan- theon, with emphasis on the Enlilite deities — Enlil, Ninurta, Sin, Adad, Shamash and Ishtar. Assyria rose to prominence in the 2nd millennium B.C., vied with Babylonia and its god Marduk for supremacy, invaded Egypt, and reached a dominant position in the ancient Near East in the ‘Neo-Assyrian’ phase in the 9th-7th centuries B.C. Its royal and religious centers — Ashur, Nineveh, Nimrud, Calah — that have been excavated since 1843, have brought to light vast urban centers, magnificent palaces, great temples, immense libraries of inscribed clay tablets, and a wealth of artifacts. Depictions and inscriptions, paying homage to Assyria’s imperial kings, enabled a reconstruction of life and events in the second and first millennia B.C., and verified the biblical tales of the wars and conquests of famed Assyrian kings, including the invasion of Israel by Tiglath-Pileser III (744-727 B.C.) and the partial exile of its leaders; the attack on Israel in 722 B.C. by his son Shalmaneser V who exiled all of its people, creating the enigma of the ‘Lost Ten Tribes’; and the attack on Judea and the failed siege of its capital Jerusalem by Sennacherib in 702 B.C.

The texts astounded scholars by the wealth of precise astronomical terms used, like An.pa for ‘Zenith’, An.bil for solstices, An.ub for the solstitial orientations, An.ur for ‘Horizon’— apart from naming planet, stars and constellations and distinguishing between them. That earliest knowledge had already adopted the Dub, the Spherical Astronomy of 360° (which modern astronomy still follows), dividing the heavens surrounding the Earth into three “Ways” — that of Enlil in the north, of Ea/Enki in the south, and of Anu in the center. The latter hosted the twelve zodiacal constellations, whose Sumerian names and pictorial depictions (Lion, Bull, Ram, Twins, Fishes, etc.) are used to this day. Many of the tablets were grouped into series (one, known as Enuma Anu Enlil , consisted of thirty tablets); there were also depictions of the heavenly sphere on a flat surface, now referred to as ‘astrolabes’.

Some scholars view the Aten as a ‘New Sun’ or ‘New Ra’, and explain the change as a new ‘Sun Religion’; others discern elements of monotheism in the worship of the Aten. The religious revision was strongly opposed by the priests of Ra/Amen, and Akhen-Aten and his city came to a quick end in 1362 B.C.

Ba’al’s supremacy was manifested by his lordship over the ‘Crest of Zaphon’, the unique platform in the Lebanon mountains that is still called Ba’albek.

Historians separate that Old Babylonian Period from the Neo-Babylonian period by an interval that lasted some five centuries, known as the Kassite Period. The Neo-Babylonian empire, that embraced the 12th to 6th centuries B.C., included in its conquests several attacks on Jerusalem and the destruction of its Temple in 587 B.C. by Nebuchadnezzar — fully corroborating the biblical tales thereof. The rise and history of Babylon were closely intertwined with the fortunes and ambitions of the god Marduk, whose main temple was the famed ziggurat (seven-stage ‘pyramid’) within a sprawling sacred precinct that ZS compared to the Vatican in Rome, with an array of buildings serving diverse functions and a plethora of priests hierarchically arranged, specializing in duties from cleaners and butchers and healers to administrators, astronomers, and astrologers. The latest aggrandizement of the sacred precinct, in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II, was motivated (per ZS) by the anticipated return of the planet Nibiru and with it a repeat visit by the god Anu. The city of Babylon, as an imperial capital, a religious center and the symbol of its kingdom, came to an end in 539 B.C. by the hand of the Achaemenid-Persian king Cyrus.

Balam: The name of a Mayan priest whose oracles were recorded in a book, sacred to the Mayans as a record of their mythical past and prophetic future, known as Chilam Balam (= ‘The Oracles/Utterings of Balam’). ZS has wondered about the intriguing similarity, in name and function, of the Mayan Balam to the biblical Balaam. Balikh River: An important northern tributary of the Euphrates River. The city of Harran, which has played an important role in Near Eastern events already in the time of Abraham, was situated on the Balikh River. See Harran, Nabunaid. Ball Courts/Games: Sacred sites in Mesoamerica, and especially Mayan sites, included game courts for playing the Tlachtli rubber-ball game. Rectangular in shape, the courts were flanked on their elongated sides (that could be 545 feet long, as in Chichen Itza) by structures that served as viewing galleries for the spectators. In the center of each such lon- ger side, 35 feet above the ground, the top of the wall had a protruding stone ring; the players, without using their hands, had to throw the ball through the ring. There were two teams of seven players each; the leader of the losing team also lost his head.

Ba.u: The spouse of Ninurta, nicknamed Gula (= ‘The Big One’); known for her medical care for the people of Lagash (her ‘cult center’). When the deathly nuclear cloud unleashed in the Sinai reached Sumer, Bau could not force herself to leave their beloved Lagash. The Lamentation Over Sumer text states that as she lingered behind, “the storm caught up with her as if she was a mortal,” suggesting that she died. Bearded People: Although native Americans have had no facial hair, many monuments in Mesoamerica depict bearded men, sometimes shown in the company of typical beardless Mayan or Aztec men. ZS has pointed out that the facial features of the ‘Bearded Ones’ indicate they were peo- ple from the Mediterranean, and has offered explanations for this usu- ally unexplained (and mostly ignored) puzzling aspect of Who had been to the Americas in antiquity and How.

The name could mean ‘pyramidion-bird’; hieroglyphic texts depicted it as conical in shape and referred to it as the upper part of the ‘Celestial Barque’ in which the god Ra had arrived on Earth from “The Planet of millions of years.” Benjamin: The younger of the two sons of Jacob by Rachel, full brother of Joseph. His Hebrew name, Ben-Yamin, reflected the name of the main tribe that lived in the Harran area, where the relatives of the Patriarchs remained after Abraham had left for Canaan. See Harran, Hurrians, Matriarchs, Mitanni, Patriarchs. Bent Pyramid: A pyramid, attributed to the Pharaoh Sneferu (first ruler of the fourth dynasty) at Dahshur (near Maidum) in Egypt, which began to be constructed at the 52° angle as in Giza, but due to the collapse of a similar pyramid farther north was bent in mid-construction to a safer angle of 43°. Berossus (Greek from Bel-Re’ushu = ‘The Lord [Bel = Marduk] is his shep- herd’): A Babylonian priest-historian who, in the 3rd century B.C., was commissioned by the Greek Seleucid successors of Alexander the Great to compile for them a summary of the Sumerian/Akkadian texts dealing with the Anunnaki gods, their arrival on Earth, and the ensuing events up to the fall of Babylon and Assyria. Though the three volumes he had composed are no longer extant, portions of them were retained, having been copied and quoted by other ancient historians and savants. It is thus known that such major biblical events as Man’s creation, the Deluge (with its hero here called in Greek ‘Sisistrus’), the ‘confusion of languages’ resulting from the Tower of Babel incident, etc. were basic knowledge in Mesopotamia.

According to Berossus fragments, he wrote that the world undergoes periodic cata- clysms, which he related to the Zodiacal Ages. See Ages, Harran, History/ Cyclical, Seleucids. Beru: A Sumerian unit of measurement equaling one twelfth — of time (= one 12th of our 24-hours daytime/nighttime period, translated in texts as a “double-hour”), of distance (usually translated “league”), or in astronomy (the 12th part of the celestial arc). Beth-El (H = ‘House/Abode of [the god] El’): A biblical town in the vicinity of Jerusalem, situated where Abraham “built an altar to Yahweh.” It also featured in the journey of the Prophet Elijah (II kings 2) via Jericho to the east bank of the Jordan River to be taken heavenwards “in a whirlwind.” Beth-Lehem (H = ‘House of Bread’): An ancient town mentioned in the Old Testament as the place where Rachel, journeying with her hus- band the Patriarch Jacob, died in childbirth and was buried there; her tomb, on the outskirts of present-day Bethlehem (six miles southwest of Jerusalem) is a pilgrimage site sacred to Jews and to Moslems. After the Israelite settlement, the Judean town was linked in the Bible to David — a shepherd from a Bethlehemite farming family who was anointed king by the Prophet Samuel. The New Testament, which stresses the lineage of Jesus to the House of David, identifies Bethlehem as the birthplace of Jesus (Matthew 2, Luke 2). The Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus was born, is the focal point of Christian pilgrimages to Bethlehem. Beth-Shemesh (H = ‘House/Abode of [the god] Shamas’): Historically, there was a southern Beth-Shemesh = Heliopolis (Annu/0«) in Egypt, and a northern one, in the Lebanon mountains, which was later known as Baalbek.

Boat of Heaven: The term used in the Sumerian texts dealing with the flying-about of Inanna to denote her aerial chariot. Boghazkoi: The name of the place in north-central Turkey where the ruins of the ancient Hittite capital, Hattushas, are located. Bolivia: An Andean country, split off Peru in 1825, which retained the southern portion of Lake Titicaca and the archaeological sites of Tiahuanacu and Puma Punku. Bond Heaven-Earth: See Dur.an.ki. Book of Adam and Eve: An ancient extra-biblical book, found in several versions, that provides legendary details of the first human couple and their family after the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. References to it in the Book of Enoch suggest that an original ‘Book of Adam and Eve’ was held to have been among the pre-diluvial writings. Modern scholars believe, however, that the Book was composed by a Hebrew writer sometime between the first century B.C. and the first century A.D. Book of the Dead: A collection of verses inscribed in hieroglyphics on the walls of royal tombs in ancient Egypt, collectively recognized by schol- ars as an ancient work, divided into chapters, primarily dealing with the Pharaohs’ journeys after death to an Afterlife with the gods. The texts were often accompanied by relevant illustrations. Because some portions or ‘chapters’ deal with the conflict between the gods Thoth and Ra, the belief in ancient Egypt was that Thoth himself was the author of the ‘book’."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"Book of Enoch Bow 37 Book of Enoch: A work, believed by scholars to have been composed in Judea in the 2nd century B.C., purporting to provide the full story of the life and celestial journeys of the biblical Enoch, the 7th pre-diluvial Patriarch, who according to the Bible (Genesis 6) did not die, but at age 365 was gone from the Earth “for the Lord had taken him.” The book, versions or sources of which included works known as The Book of the Secrets of Enoch, The Testimony of Enoch, The Words of Enoch, and oth- ers, has survived the millennia in two principal versions: The Ethiopic Book of Enoch (‘Enoch I’) and the Slavonic version (‘Enoch II’). The most fascinating portions of the books are the descriptions of Enoch’s journeys that are filled with astronomical, calendrical, and Earth-science knowledge. Book of Jubilees: A pseudepigrapha book (a professed ‘biblical book’ not included in the canonical Bible), dated by scholars to second or first cen- turies B.C., that rewrote prehistory and history according to a calendrical count of “weeks of years” of 7 x 7, requiring the 50th year (‘the Jubilee’) to be one of granting freedom to people and lands. It adds many details to what is written in the canonized biblical books Genesis and the first part of Exodus; the fact that it was widely quoted in antiquity and has been found in various ancient translations of the original Hebrew and among the Dead Sea scrolls, suggests that — in antiquity — its unstated sources were deemed reliable. ‘Jubilee’ is a translation of the Hebrew term Yovel which literally means Ram. Borsippa: A city south of Babylon that was the ‘cult center’ of the god Nabu, the son of Marduk. During the escalating Anunnaki conflicts caused by Marduk’s strife for supremacy, Borsippa was destroyed by Elamite troops on order of the opposing gods (end of 2nd millennium B.C.). Bow: In Near Eastern lore the bow was a divine weapon with magical attributes, sometimes bestowed by a god to a favored individual. A cyl- inder seal depiction of gods shows one, probably Enlil, armed with a bow. Inanna/Ishtar, when depicted as a goddess of war, was also shown armed with a bow. In the Bible, a divine “Bow in the Clouds” ( Keshet"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"38 Brazil Brook of Egypt be-Anan ) was displayed by God after the Deluge as a sign that there will not be another Deluge; the term has thus been taken to mean a rain- bow. That, ZS has shown, is not necessarily so in view of the fact that a “god in the clouds” holding a bow in his hand was depicted on Assyrian monuments. Brazil: The largest country in South America, occupying most of the conti- nent’s eastern half and its Amazon River basin. It is Portuguese speaking, unlike the Spanish-speaking rest of South America, as a result of a treaty between Spain and Portugal dividing the New World between them — a division sought by Portugal because it apparently had access to maps, from a time before the Columbus discoveries, already correctly showing the Americas. Various archaeological discoveries in Brazil of rock carvings and pottery suggest that Near Easterners had reached its shores thousands of years before the Columbus voyages. Bronze (Za.bar = ‘Gleaming double metal’): An alloy of copper and tin that can be melted and cast, resulting in tools, utensils and sculptures of great strength. While other metals used in antiquity (gold, silver, copper and iron) are naturally found, tin is obtained by extracting it in high temperatures from a mineral called Cassiterite; the tin, malleable and soft, is useful in bronze only when added to copper in a certain proportion. In spite of these technological challenges, the ‘Bronze Age’ began in the Near East circa 3300 B.C. and gave way to the Iron Age circa 1100 B.C. Intriguing early use of bronze in antiquity was discov- ered at Puma Punku near Tiahuanacu in Bolivia, where stone blocks were held together with specially designed clamps made of bronze, in structures dated to circa 4000 B.C. That, and other evidence, has led ZS to conclude that Tiahuanacu was established by the Anunnaki as a major metallurgical center soon after the Deluge. See Metals/Metallurgy, Tiahuanacu, Tin.

Bull-men: Divine guardians, depicted in Mesopotamian monuments and on cylinder seals with a human upper part and the aft legs and tail of a bull. Bull of Heaven (Gud.anna): The Sumerian name of the zodiacal Constellation of the Bull (Taurus) associated with Enlil. In the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Bull of Heaven was a unique bull that was placed by Enlil in the Cedar Forest of Lebanon; it was slain by Enkidu (the com- panion of Gilgamesh). Incomplete portions in the Epic of Gilgamesh leave unclear whether it was a special but real bull, embellished with pre- cious stones and metals, or a robotic creature; Egyptian illustrations that depict the slaying of the Bull of Heaven considered it a celestial event, signaling the end of Enlil’s Age. Burning Bush: The bush which attracted the attention of Moses, when he shepherded a flock of sheep in the Sinai, for “it was burning with fire without being consumed.” When he approached, he heard God’s voice assigning to him the task of leading the Israelites out of Egypt. Buzur: An epithet of Enki that could mean in Sumerian both “He who knows/solves secrets” and “He of the copper mines” — per ZS, a significant clue to the identity of the ‘Serpent’ in the biblical Garden of Eden tale, because the Hebrew term Nachash also has the same multi-meanings as Buzur. See Enki, Eden, Ningishzida, Serpent. Byblos: A Phoenician city ( Gebal in the Bible) on the Mediterranean coast in what is now Lebanon.

ZS cites Sumerian tales of shepherd-farmer rivalries and a tab- let in the British Museum dealing with a Ka.in who was “doomed to roam the Earth in sorrow,” and has suggested that the ‘Mark of Cain’ could have been a genetic marker, such as the absence of facial hair by native Americans — offering the Cain migration and lineage as an expla- nation for early human settlement in North America.

An Assyrian city, known only from the Bible (Genesis 10) until the discovery of a tablet in which an Assyrian king described the restoration there of an olden temple. Archaeological finds identified the place as Kalhu, an Assyrian royal city in the 9th century B.C. The Bible listed Calah as one of the cities of the heroic hunter Nimrod; interestingly, the local name for the site is Tel Nimrud (= ‘The Mound of Nimrod’). Calendars: Calendrical timekeeping, linked to the annual Earth-Sun cycle and a monthly Moon-Earth cycle, began in Sumer, in Nippur (Sumer’s religious/astronomical center); there, the term for ‘month’ was Ezen — “festival”— because each month was dedicated to celebrating one of the twelve great gods, starting with Anu.

The complex luni-solar cal- endar, requiring sophisticated astronomical knowledge, was replaced by the later Greeks and Romans with a simplified solar-only calendar, while the Moslems have adopted a lunar-only one. The Christian or ‘Common Era’ (C.E.) solar calendar, whose count of ‘Annu Domini’ (A.D.) begins from the presumed birth of Jesus, continues the ‘Julian Calendar’ (so named after the Roman emperor Julius Caesar) as revised by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. In Mesoamerica the calendar story begins with the presentation of a golden disc by the Aztec king to the Spanish leader Hernando Cortes in A.D. 1519; while that one was promptly melted on arrival back in Spain, a stone replica of it was found and can be seen in Mexico City; it recorded the passage of time according to ‘Suns’ or Ages lasting an uneven number of thousands of years (see ‘Ages’). In the more common meaning of the word ‘calendar’, the Mesoamericans had three. One, called ‘Tzolkin’, rotated units of 20 days 13 times to make a Sacred Year of just 260 days. Another, called ‘Haab’, divided the solar year into 18 units of 20, to which 5 special days were added at the end to make up a solar year of 365 days; the Haab was thus somewhat similar to the Egyptian calendar. The oldest, called ‘The Long Count’, was originated by the Olmecs; it recorded time by the number of days that have passed from a Day One (now calculated to equal August 13, 3113 B.C.). ZS has suggested that it was then that Thoth, renamed Quetzalcoatl by the Aztecs, came to Mesoamerica from Egypt. See Ages, Mayan Calendar, Nippur Calendar, Olmecs.

Canaan, Canaanites: The biblical Cena’an comprised the lands that now are Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and southwestern Syria. Little was known of the Canaanites outside of the biblical information and passing references in Egyptian, Assyrian and Phoenician inscriptions, until the archaeological discovery of a major Canaanite site. Located on Syria’s Mediterranean coast at a place called Ras Shamra, a trove of inscribed clay tablets found there identified the place as Ugarit and provided firsthand information on the Canaanite language, culture and religion— shown to be adaptations of the Akkadian ones. The Bible named Canaan as descended of Ham (the second son of Noah) whose lands were in Africa, not in Asia; he was thus deemed a usurper in lands belonging to Shem (Noah’s Firstborn). Accordingly, Canaan (the land) was territorially available to be promised by God to Shem’s descendant Abraham and his seed: “All the land of Canaan, as an ever- lasting possession” (Genesis 14:8).

Tin was essential for making bronze (an alloy of copper and tin); some scholars believe that the quest for Cassiterite explains some of the early settlements in the British Isles. ZS has added the Americas to the list. Cassites (or Kassites): A people, possibly from the highlands east of Mesopotamia, who excelled in metallurgy in the third and second mil- lennia B.C. Since bronze was their preferred metal, it is possible that their name, stemming from the Greek Cassiteros, could be the source of the name Cassiterite for the tin-rich ore. See Kassites re their reign in Babylon. Cedars, Cedar Forest: The majestic cedar trees, extolled in the Bible for their extraordinary height (up to 150 feet), strength and beauty, were prized in antiquity as a gift of the gods, and were cut only for use in tem- ples or consecrated royal palaces. They grew only in a special forest in the mountains of Lebanon, which is described in the ‘Epic of Gilgamesh as a hideout of the gods guarded by ferocious robotic monsters; within that “Cedar Forest” was the secret “Landing Place of the gods — the Baalbek platform and stone launch tower, according to ZS.

Celestial Time: A term coined by ZS to denote the zodiacal cycle of 2,160 x 12 years, which (he has suggested) the Anunnaki devised to create a workable relationship between ‘Earthly Time’ (one year on Earth) and ‘Divine Time’ (one year on Nibiru, mathematically = 3,600 Earth years).

Cities of the gods: According to Sumerian texts, the Anunnaki established in the E.Din a series of settlements even before Man was created by them. Destroyed in the Deluge, the cities were rebuilt after the Deluge exactly where they had been, but now were also Cities of Men. ZS has shown that the original cities were laid out in a pattern serving as a Landing Corridor. See Anunnaki, Eden, Erech, Eridu, Mesopotamia, Sumer.

Codices: Picture-book manuscripts kept by Mesoamerica’s native peoples; most were destroyed by zealous Spanish priests as heresy, but some that have been spared serve as a unique source of information on the pre- Columbian peoples, their cultures, histories, legends and religions. Coffin Texts: Hieroglyphic texts painted on wooden coffins in Egypt, mostly from the Greek and Roman periods. Comets: Small celestial objects that orbit the Sun in diverse elongated tra- jectories of varying periods, giving off a gaseous luminous tail as they near the Sun. Astronomers assume that comets resulted from unknown celestial collisions, but are unable to explain why many comets have a retrograde orbit — clockwise, rather than the counterclockwise direction common in our solar system. Such a retrograde orbit, ZS has pointed out, was that of the invading Nibiru/Marduk; and he suggested as an explanation of the origin of retrograde comets the statement in Enuma elish that, as a result of the ‘Celestial battle’, Tiamat’s “host” of small satellites “was shattered, bro- ken up . . . her helpers who marched at her side turned their backs about.” The appearance of comets was considered a divine celestial omen in both Old World and New World cultures.

ZS additionally quotes references in Akkadian/Sumerian texts to a deliberate diversification of languages due to Enid's anger with Mankind. See Tower of Babel. Constellations: The grouping of heavenly stars into ‘constellations’ and their naming go back millennia, to Sumerian times — a fact recog- nized by early Greek astronomers such as Eudoxus and Hipparchus. The Sumerians (and the Babylonians etc. after them) divided the heav- ens into three ‘Ways’ — the northern segment as the Way of Enlil, the southern segment as the Way of Ea/Enki, and the central segment as the Way of Anu; and numerous clay tablets listed the constellations in each such Way. The central one of Anu was devoted to the twelve zodia- cal constellations, starting with Taurus (Gu.Anna, the Bull of Heaven), when the Sumerian civilization began (fourth millennium B.C.). Since texts dealing with much earlier times employ zodiacal terminology (the Sumerian tale of the Deluge dates it to the Age of Ur. Gula [= ‘The Lion’] which began circa 10900 B.C.), it is certain that the concept of constellations preceded Mankind’s civilizations. According to ZS, it was the Anunnaki (for whom an Earth year was a minuscule time unit), who grouped the stars and invented the zodiac as a ‘Celestial Calendar’ in which the mathematical length of one unit (a Zodiacal Age) was 2,160 Earth-years, giving a convenient 6:10 ratio to Nibiru’s orbital period of 3,600 Earth-years.

Its use began with hammering soft nuggets of native copper into sheets and utensils. With the invention of the kiln furnace, mined copper ores could be smelted and refined; that made lands where copper could be mined — such as Cyprus or Crete — desired territories. The Egyptians obtained copper from mines in the southern Sinai; the famed ‘King Solomon’s Mines’ were nearby. The discovery that copper, when alloyed with tin or zinc, acquired other useful properties, launched the Metallurgical Age. In the Bible, the word for copper — Neboshet — derives from the verb that means ‘to decipher’; the derived noun Nahash has two meanings: ‘a solver/knower of secrets’ and ‘serpent’ (as in the Garden of Eden tale); so does the parallel Sumerian terminology. Noteworthy is the report in Exodus that Moses stopped a plague afflicting the Israelites by fashion- ing Nehushtan — a copper serpent. See Buzur, Enki, Eden. Cori-Cancha (= ‘Golden Enclosure’): The principal shrine in Cuzco, the Inca capital in Peru, dedicated to the god Viracocha. Its walls were com- pletely encased in gold — gold that was immediately pried off the walls by the arriving Spaniards. (The bare walls still bear the marks of their golden plates.) The semi-circular section for the Holy of Holies, built of perfectly shaped ashlars, was so built that the sun’s rays shone in upon the golden altar, creating a sunburst as the rays hit a huge disc of pure gold, at sunrise on the day of the winter solstice — an archaeoastronomi- cal clue indicating that the temple’s orientation was determined thou- sands of years before the Incas. See Ayar Brothers, Viracocha. Council of the gods: According to Sumerian texts, the Anunnaki’s most important decisions were reached not by unilateral decrees of Anu or Enlil, but after “the great Anunnaki who decree the fates sat exchang- ing their counsels.” Matters concerning the gods, as well as crucial deci- sions affecting Mankind, were debated and decided at such councils. The Anunnaki leaders (who also included Enki, Ninharsag and others) addressed the meetings, and sometimes engaged in bitter debates before reaching a decision.

Covenant: (H Brit) Generally means a Treaty, but the term is used in the Bible to define God’s promises to Abraham and his descendants as an everlasting commitment. Craftsman of the gods: Called Kothar-Hasis (= ‘Skilled and Knowing’) in Canaanite tales, he made for the god Ba’al divine weapons with which to defeat his brothers, then fortified and equipped Ba’al’s redoubt of the Crest of Zaphon. He also made for a young hero a unique bow that the goddess Anat schemed to possess. Greek savants compared Kothar-Hasis to the divine craftsman Hephaestus who, according to Greek mythology, built an abode for Zeus and Hera. Creation Tales: Virtually all civilizations around the world have tales of Creation, with emphasis on how Mankind began with a First Couple. The best known is the biblical one in Genesis, which not only describes evolution on Earth, but starts with how the Earth itself, and the heav- ens, were created. The biblical version undoubtedly had as a source the Sumerian/Akkadian ‘Epic of Creation’ (. Enuma elish). These sources attribute the Creation of The Adam to the Anunnaki/Elohim. In The 12th Planet , ZS provides additional Sumerian/Akkadian texts that detail how Enki (god of knowledge) and Ninharsag (goddess of medicine) used genetic engineering to upgrade Earth’s hominids to Homo sapiens. Since the Anunnaki roamed the Earth, no wonder that Creation Tales in other parts of the world also included a First Couple fashioned by the god of science— e.g., in Mesoamerica Quetzalcoatl (‘Plumed Serpent’) assisted by the female Cihuacoatl (‘Serpent Woman’). Crest of Zaphon: The name given in Canaanite tales to Baal’s redoubt, and in the Bible (Isaiah 14) to the Landing Site, in the Lebanon moun- tains, in which the term Zaphon can mean both ‘place in the north’ and ‘the place of secrets’.

Canaanite texts about KRT and its king could well have been related to the Greek name ‘Kreta’ for the island. It is mentioned in the Bible as Caphtor. Cro-Magnon Man: An advanced Homo sapiens, physically almost indistin- guishable from Modern Man, who, some 40,000 years ago, inexplicably came from Western Asia and replaced the more primitive Neanderthals in Europe. Though spoken of as ‘Stone-age people’ and ‘cavemen’, they added wood, bones and clay to stones as materials for utensils, tools and weapons; wore clothing; crafted artistic artifacts (including figurines of a Mother Goddess); and decorated their caves with artful paintings that amaze to this day. In The Wars of Gods and Men ZS has suggested that the “accursation of Earth” which is recorded in Sumerian texts, that began some 75,000 years ago, was a new Ice Age that regressed the human race; and that about “49,000 years ago Enki and Ninharsag ele- vated humans of Anunnaki parentage” to be able to become rulers — a development that can explain the appearance of ‘Cro-Magnon’ man. Cronus: In Greek mythology, the youngest male of the twelve Titans (off- spring of the first celestial couple, Gaea/Earth and Uranus/Sky). Seeking dominion, he castrated his father and imprisoned and banished the other Titans. He consorted with his sister Rhea; their three sons and three daughters made up half of the Olympian pantheon, including the great god Zeus who deposed his father Cronus. Cross: When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan (now Mexico City) in A.D. 1519, they were astounded to discover that the Cross symbol was depicted as the emblem of the chief Aztec god on his shield.

See also Aten. Cubit: An ancient unit of measuring length, presumed to have equaled 24 ‘fingers’ in a biblical Amah, or 28 ‘fingers’ in a royal Egyptian one (525 millimeters = 20.63\"). Sir Isaac Newton calculated that a ‘Sacred Cubit’ used in the construction of the Giza pyramids and in Noah’s Ark equaled 25.2\". Cuneiform Script: A script introduced in Sumer in the 4th millennium B.C. and then used throughout the ancient Near East and Western Asia for more than three thousand years. Evolving from pictographs, the script expressed in wedgelike signs the syllabic sounds of the spoken words (be it Sumerian, Akkadian, Hittite, Canaanite, Persian, etc.). Scribes trained in special scribal schools had to learn more than 500 variants of the multi-wedged symbols that made up the script at the peak of its use, in Babylonia and Assyria. ZS has shown that the numerous variants were not only logically arranged, but actually followed advanced mathemati- cal formulas. Cush (or Kush)-.

There were fourteen Inca rulers in Cuzco from A.D. 1021 to A.D. 1532. When the Spaniards reached Cuzco in A.D. 1533, it was a great metropolis divided into twelve wards matching the twelve zodiacal constellations, from which"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"Cylinder Seals Cyrus 53 four royal roads led to the four corners of the Inca empire.

After plundering the city, the Spaniards divided its edifices among themselves, in the end dismantling most of them to build Dominican churches and monasteries. Nowadays, visitors to Cuzco can still see here and there remains of the pre-Incan structures built of interlocking stone blocks. Cylinder Seals: Precursor of the modern rotary press, a ‘cylinder seal’ was a device originated in Sumer and then emulated throughout the ancient Near East. Small cylinders (usually an inch or so high), mostly cut from stone (in some cases, semi-precious) were engraved by an artist in reverse with an illustration, sometimes accompanied by writing. When the cyl- inder was rolled on wet clay, the image was impressed on the clay as a positive; when the clay dried, a permanent imprint unique to that seal was obtained. The term adds the word ‘seal’ to ‘cylinder’ because they were used to seal containers (e.g., of oil, wine) or as a seal to authenticate clay-tablet documents.

Daniel (H = ‘Judged by God’): The Bible’s Book of Daniel identifies him as one of the sons of noblemen exiled from Judea to Babylon after Nebuchadnezzar captured Jerusalem. Taken to serve in the royal court of Belshazzar, Daniel distinguished himself as a solver of dreams and of an oracle written on the palace wall by a floating hand. Then Daniel himself began to have dreams and see visions foretelling turmoil and the rise and fall of kingdoms; the visions, involving angels, beasts and other symbolisms, are believed to have served as a model for similar visions in the New Testament’s Book of Revelation. Told by angels that his dreams and visions concerned the End of Time, Daniel persisted in asking when it shall come to pass; the several enigmatic answers he received have been the subject of study and speculation ever since, including recently dis- covered calculations by Sir Isaac Newton. ZS, in The End of Days, offers his own findings. See Ages, Babylon, Belshazzar, End of Days, Prophets, Zodiacal Ages.

David: The foremost Judean king whose feats, deeds and misdeeds are extensively recorded in the Bible. Son of Jesse of Bethlehem, he came to fame when, as a young shepherd, he stepped forth and slew the Philistine Goliath with a sling shot. He succeeded Israel’s first king, Saul; the description in I Samuel 16 of David’s anointment as the bestowing the Spirit of God upon him, established David as “God’s Anointed,” whose descendants alone (starting with his son Solomon) shall be the right- ful heirs to kingship in Jerusalem. According to Psalm 89, David was anointed with God’s Holy Oil, creating a special and everlasting bond between God and the “House of David.” A warrior and a nation builder, he fought off neighboring enemies and, circa 1000 B.C., established Jerusalem as the national capital. Many Psalms, expressing unbound devotion to Yahweh, are attributed to David. The Hebrew Prophets deemed the ultimate restoration of David’s throne in Jerusalem as the fulfillment of divine messianic promises; the New Testament begins the tale of Jesus with a listing of his Davidic lineage. According to ZS, the choice of David (a shepherd), his affirmation as king by the act of anointing, and the selection of Hebron as his first seat of kingship, were all symbolic links to the Kingship that “was brought down from heaven” by the Anunnaki.

Two gods sacrificed themselves in Teothihuacan (= ‘Place of the gods’) in the Divine Flame to persuade the Sun and the Moon to reappear and resume their motions. The other gods commemorated the event by erecting the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Likewise, in South America, an Inca legend relates that at one time the Creator God became angry with the people and hid the sun from the land: “There was no dawn for twenty hours.” He relented when the king hurriedly resumed the prescribed rites. A similar recollection of “a day of darkness” is included in the tales of the Uru people in the Andes. ZS, in The Lost Realms , recalls in that connection one of the most chal- lenging episodes recorded in the Bible, that of the day when the Sun did not set: According to Joshua chapter 10, to help the Israelites in a battle, Yahweh made “the Sun stand still in Gibeon and the Moon in the Valley of Ayalon.” The phenomenon lasted “about a whole day.” Scholars have struggled for generations with this tale; unable to find a satisfac- tory explanation, most consider the tale to be just a myth. In response, ZS pointed out in When Time Began that if the Sun stood still and did not set on one side of the Earth (the Near East), it did not rise on the other side (the Americas); therefore, the opposite tales describe the effects of the same occurrence, eyewitnessed on both sides of the Earth. Citing the chronicler Montesinos, ZS has calculated South America’s date of the event as 1394 B.C. — which corresponds to the time of Joshua’s battle in the Valley of Ayalon. So the inexplicable event — when the Earth stood still — had to have actually occurred, even if science is yet to explain it. See Joshua, Teotihuacan. Day of the Lord: A term increasingly invoked by biblical Prophets starting in the 8th century B.C. and with rising urgency in the 6th century B.C. The Prophets described it as a time when the Celestial Lord shall appear from the south, light up Venus, come closer to Earth, and on Earth cause darkness at noon and earthquakes: Isaiah foresaw the heavens “agitated” when the celestial Lord shall reappear “from the end point of heaven” and the Earth “shaken out of its place when the Lord shall be crossing;” Amos"},{"pageNumber":68,"pageContent":"58 Dead Sea Dead Sea Scrolls predicted that “the Earth shall be darkened in the midst of daytime.” ZS has explained that the ‘Day of the Lord’ was the anticipated return of the planet Nibiru to Earth’s vicinity.

(See also in Journeys to the Mythical Past re a date incised on the astounding ‘Antikythera Mechanism’.) Dead Sea: The lakelike and lifeless body of water at the terminus of the Jordan River, now divided between Israel and the Kingdom of Jordan. Located in a deep geologic rift valley that makes it the lowest point on Earth, it is called Yam Elamelach (= The Salt Sea ) in Hebrew because the high evaporation rate combined with insufficient water inflow cause an extremely high mineral-salt content that prevents any life in its waters; it is so named also in an inscription of the Assyrian king Sargon II. ZS, treating the Epic of Gilgamesh as a factual tale, has suggested that in trying to cross a “barren sea whose waters are death” Gilgamesh was actually attempting to cross the Dead Sea on the way to the spaceport in the Sinai. ZS has also suggested that the southern extension of the sea resulted from flooding caused by the nuclear upheavaling of Sodom, Gomorrah and three other “sinning cities” that had been located there. See Abraham, Erra, Gilgamesh, Lot, Nuclear Weapons. Dead Sea Scrolls: In the spring of 1947 a shepherd boy looking for a lost sheep in the barren cliffs overlooking the Dead Sea discovered in a cave a stack of earthenware jars in which inscribed parchment scrolls were hidden. Those scrolls and others discovered since then — collectively known as the Dead Sea Scrolls — turned out to be Hebrew manuscripts carefully hidden during the Jewish revolt against Roman rule in Judea two thousand years ago. Because most were found in caves adjoining a site called Qumran, the scrolls are presumed to have been the library of a Jewish sect known as the Essenes whose retreat Qumran was.

While such scrolls throw light on the religious ferment at the time when Christianity began, there is no consensus regarding the Essenes, whether Qumran was indeed their hideout, or even whether the scrolls were all theirs — or perhaps brought from the Temple in Jerusalem to save them from the Roman onslaught. But all agree that the scrolls’ very existence is a major attestation of the antiquity of the canonized Hebrew Bible and various apocryphal texts (that, among other things, corroborate the references to the Nefilim). DED (also DJED): An Egyptian hieroglyph depicting a step-pillar and meaning ‘Everlastingness’. Delphi: A sacred precinct dotted with temples, located on a promontory west ol Athens. It was the site of ancient Greece’s most famous oracle: In the inner sanctum of the temple to Apollo, hidden in a subterranean chamber, an oracle priestess, in a trancelike state, gave enigmatic answers to kings and heroes who posed questions concerning their fates. Such an ambiguous Delphic oracle encouraged Alexander of Macedon to embark on his conquests. The topography and layout of the site and the fact that the principal sacred object there was an Omphalos, suggested to ZS that the site served as a physical base for the intrepid and continent-hopping god Apollo. Deluge: The great flood that according to the Bible engulfed the Earth and would have extinguished Mankind save for Noah and his Ark. Though the lore of virtually all cultures recalls a devastating deluge, the biblical tale was held to be just that — a tale, until a similar story was found in earlier Mesopotamian texts, (e.g., the Epic of Gilgamesh and the Atra- Hasis epic). The Sumerian and Akkadian texts provided details of the several gods’ roles, their identities and motivations, and added specif- ics of actual locations, rulers’ names (including the identity of ‘Noah’— Ziusudra in Sumerian, Utnapishtim in Akkadian), and description of the Ark, a submersible vessel, per ZS. These texts enabled ZS to date the event to circa 13,000 years ago — a conclusion that links the Deluge to the scientifically established end of the last Ice Age. ZS explained the"},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"60 Demigods Destiny Deluge as an engulfing tidal wave caused by the slippage of the immense ice sheet off the Antarctic continent. It was a calamity in-the-making, observed by the Anunnaki from a scientific station at the tip of Africa; and when they realized that the anticipated close passage of Nibiru at its perigee would trigger the avalanche, Enlil wanted to let Mankind be unprepared and perish; Enki, defied that by saving ‘Noah’. See Ea/Enki, Man/Mankind, Nibiru Orbit, Noah, Ziusudra. Demigods: The written records of ancient civilizations contain as a mat- ter of fact numerous references to ‘demigods’ — the offspring of parents one of whom was a god or goddess. The Sumerian King List names pre- Diluvial demigod rulers (including the names of their divine parents). In post-Diluvial times, several kings of Uruk were demigods, parented by the god Utu or (as in the case of Gilgamesh) by the goddess Ninsun. Ancient Egyptian dynastic lists provided by Manetho start with two dynasties of gods followed by a list of thirty demigods; in Pharaonic times, kings claimed to have been the offspring of gods, and included the suffix MSS (= ‘Issue of’ a god) in their royal titles. Alexander the Great believed palace rumors that his true father was not king Philip but the Egyptian god Ammon. Even the Hebrew Bible recognizes demigods when it tells in chapter 6 of Genesis that “the sons of the Elohim took Daughters of Man as wives and had children by them.” In Joshua 14 the Bible lists the rulers of Hebron before the Israelite arrival as “descendants of the Anakim ” (= Anunnaki), which makes them demigod offspring. Denderah: A site in Upper Egypt where a zodiacal map of the heavens decorated the ceiling of a temple for the goddess Hathor. Descending Passage: In the Great Pyramid in Giza, a corridor leading from the Pyramid’s original entrance in the north side all the way to the Pyramid’s bottom pit in its bedrock base. Similar to descending passages in other pyramids, its existence was known in antiquity; that at some point it could lead to a blocked Ascending Passage (unique to this pyra- mid) was discovered by chance in A.D. 820. Destiny (Nam): While in most modern languages, and thus in modern"},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"Deuteronomy Din.gir 61 translations of Sumerian texts, ‘Destiny’ and ‘Fate’ are interchangeable terms, ZS has pointed out that the Sumerians distinguished between Destiny (Nam) that, once determined, could not be changed, and Fate (Nam. tar) which, though constrained by Destiny, could be modified by free will, righteous behavior, prayer, etc. A predetermined Destiny applied to people, kings, countries, the gods themselves, even to the Earth and other planets (whose ‘destiny’ was the orbit assigned to each one of them). But while Man’s mortality was his destiny, within that inevitability was his Fate, which just behavior, following the gods’ com- mandments etc. could result in a longer life, a healthier life, etc. In that way, the Sumerians introduced the concept of Free Will, Free Choice and Morality into Man’s life and behavior. Deuteronomy (H Devarim - ‘Sayings’): The fifth book of the so-called Five Books of Moses of the Bible, whose opening verse is “These are the words which Moses spoke to all of Israel on this side of the Jordan, in the wilderness.” The book reviews the events of the Exodus and repeats the commandments by which the Israelites had to abide. Dil.gan: A Sumerian name for the planet Jupiter. Dilmun: See Tilmun. Din.gir: A two-syllable word that was used in Sumerian cuneiform writ- ing as a ‘determinative’— a term that defines the nature of the name that follows. Because ‘din.gir’ always preceded the name of a god, e.g., ‘din- gir Enid’, ‘dingir Enki’, etc., the word is taken by translators to mean god — god Enid’, the ‘god Enki’, etc. Ancient Akkadian-Sumerian glossaries rendered the word as Ilu in Akkadian (from which comes the Fiebrew and Canaanite El, translated ‘god’), and simplified the pictorial sign to that of a star. By tracing back the development of the cuneiform sign Din.gir from its later star symbol to its two-part pictorial origin, ZS has shown that the sign depicted a two-stage rocketship. Taken sepa- rately, Din meant ‘Righteous’ in Sumerian and Gir meant ‘Rocket’, so that what has come to mean ’god’ originally meant the “Righteous one of the Rocketships.” See God/gods."},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"62 Dir.ga Divine Ranks Dir.ga (‘Dark, Crownlike’): An inner chamber in Enlil’s ‘Bond Heaven- Earth’ facility in Nippur where “a heavenly zenith with the starry emblems” was installed.

It was kept in a special enclosure built on an artificial platform in the sacred precinct of Lagash (Ninurta’s ‘cult center’). Divine Formulas: One way that translators use to convey the elusive mean- ing of the Sumerian term ‘Me’ that described small portable objects that contained and provided secret knowledge or ‘formulas’ for each and every aspect of a high civilization, from space travel to temple rituals. The Me was not just something on which data was encoded (we would now say ‘a computer chip’ or ‘memory disc’), but also provided the ability, the authority and the power to exercise such knowledge. A text titled ‘A Hymn to Eridu’ recorded a complaint by Enlil that Enki, the custodian of the Me, withheld from him the Me needed to establish Nippur as his command center. A subsequent description of Enlil’s Mission Control Center in Nippur lists Me alongside “Tablets of Destinies” as essential equipment. Another text tells how Inanna, visiting Enki to obtain the Me needed to make her city Uruk a center of kingship and priesthood, stole and escaped holding one hundred of them in her hand. Scholars have also translated the term as ‘Divine powers’, ‘Divine command- ments’, ‘Mythic virtues’. See Dur.an.ki, Enlil, Zu. Divine Ranks: The principal deities of the Sumerian-Akkadian pantheon had a numerical rank. Culling the information from a variety of texts, ZS has determined that these ranks followed the Sumerian sexagesimal (‘Base 60’) system, assigning to Anu (chief of the twelve Great Gods) the rank of 60, 50 to Enlil, 40 to Ea/Enki, 30 to Nannar/Sin, 20 to Utu/Shamash, 10 to Ishkur/Adad. Their female counterparts bore the ‘half ranks’ of 55 to Antu, 45 to Ninlil, 35 to Ninki, 25 to Ningal, 15 to Inanna/Ishtar (who pushed Ninharsag down to 5). In the struggle for succession, Ninurta claimed Enid's rank of 50 — only to see Marduk"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"Divine Scribe Dome of the Rock 63 obtain the rank and its Fifty Names” after the nuclear blast of 2024 B.C.

Divine Scribe: One of the titles of the Egyptian god Thoth, who wrote down the decisions of the Council of the Gods. It was stated that he wrote with his own fingers” the composition known as the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Divine Time: A term coined by ZS in When Time Began for the Anunnaki’s one year on Nibiru (one orbit = 3,600 Earth years), as distinguished from Earthly Time (one year = one Earth orbit). See Sar. DNA: The chains of molecules of four nucleic acids (known by their initials A-C-G-T) within every living cell that combine to form ‘genes’ which determine whether the life form shall be a lowly bacterium, a flower or fish, a bird, animal or human. The key to unlocking the genetic secrets was the discovery that the genetic chains are paired to form a Double Helix. ZS has pointed out, in The Cosmic Code, that in antiquity such a spiraling double helix was depicted as Entwined Serpents — it was the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol for ‘Ptah’ (= Enki, Mankind’s creator by genetic engineering and the ‘Serpent’ in the biblical tale of Adam and Eve). Entwined Serpents — a symbol of medicine to this day — was also the Sumerian symbol of Enki ’s son and helper Nin.gish.zid.da (‘Lord/ Artificer of the Tree of Life ). The human genome is arranged in 22 chromosomes (plus two to determine sex); DNA works when three of its four letters’ combine into 22 different sets of ‘trios’ of amino acid that act as verbs from which protein ‘words’ are formed. ZS has found it remarkable that the Hebrew language also uses 22 letters to make up ‘trios’ that serve as ‘root verbs’ — emulating the way DNA works. Dome of the Rock: An octagonal structure on the Temple Mount in Jerusalem built as a protective housing over the sacred ‘Foundation Rock a large and unusually formed rock outcropping on which the Ark of the Covenant in the Holy of Holies of Solomon’s Temple had stood (and where, according to tradition, Abraham was ready to"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"64 Domestication Duat sacrifice his son Isaac). The structure was built by the Moslems after they captured Jerusalem in the 7th century A.D.; the Moslems believe that it was from that sacred rock that Mohammed was taken aloft to visit heaven. The structure’s gilded dome, that gave the building its name, was brought over by the Caliph Abd al-Malik from Baalbek in Lebanon, where it roofed over a Byzantine church. See Ark of the Covenant. Domestication: The process of adapting wild plants (such as barley, wheat) or wild animals (such as sheep, goats) to human needs and raising them in controlled circumstances (as agricultural crops in fields, in herds, etc.). By and large, the process began in the Near East circa 10000-9000 B.C., in the area that is now Lebanon/Syria. While scientists and sociologists theorize how Mankind switched from ‘hunting-gathering’ to agriculture and husbandry, Sumerian texts attributed the feat to a deliberate deci- sion by the gods in the aftermath of Earth’s devastation by the Deluge circa 11000 B.C. Texts, such as the Tale of Lahar (‘woolly creatures’ = sheep) and Anshan (‘grain cereals’), state that both emanated from a “Creation Chamber,” a “House of Fashioning” set up by Enlil and Enki right after the Deluge on “the Pure Mound,” in the “Mountain of aro- matic cedars” (per ZS, the Landing Place of the Anunnaki = Baalbek in Lebanon). Then the gods taught Nam.lu.gallu (= ‘Civilized Mankind’) the “tilling of the land” and “the keeping of sheep” — first and foremost so that the gods themselves would be satiated. Other Sumerian texts attributed the teaching of agriculture to Enlil and his son Ninurta; of animal husbandry, to Enki. Duat: The Egyptian hieroglyphic name, meaning ‘Abode for ascending to the stars’, for the Pharaohs’ first destination in their Afterlife Journey. The Pyramid Texts and the Book of the Dead described it as a place with underground passages and chambers leading to where the ‘Gates to Heaven’ would open and the king would be taken heavenwards in a ‘Divine Ascender’, to join the gods on the ‘Planet of Millions of Years’. Treating the Journey’s details in those texts as factual geographic and topographic indicators, ZS has concluded that the Duat was located in"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"Dumu.zi Dvir 65 the central plain of the Sinai peninsula — the site of the Anunnaki’s post- Diluvial spaceport. Dumu.zi (= ‘Son who is Life’): The youngest of the six sons of Enki who was betrothed to Inanna/Ishtar (Enid's granddaughter). His elder brother Marduk opposed the marriage, and brought about Dumuzi’s death. Many Sumerian texts describe that godly ‘Romeo and Juliet’ tragic love, and how the distraught Inanna went in search of her beloved’s body in an effort to resurrect him. Additionally studying relevant Egyptian texts, ZS has suggested that it was Inanna who began the custom of mummification, hoping to preserve Dumuzi until he comes back to life. The 10th Mesopotamian month (called Tammuz in Akkadian and in Hebrew) was named for Dumuzi, and he was bewailed in that month even in biblical times. Dur.an.ki (= Bond Heaven-Earth’): The innermost secret chamber or Holy of Holies in Enid’s pre-Diluvial Mission Control Center in Nippur, from which the space operations of the Anunnaki were con- trolled with the aid of ‘Tablets of Destinies’ — devices encoded with sky maps, planetary orbits, and other space data. ZS has suggested that after the Deluge, Jerusalem fulfilled this function. Because Nippur was also deemed to be the Navel of the Earth, the Dur.an.ki could be com- pared to a virtual Umbilical Cord between the Anunnaki on Earth and their mother planet, Nibiru. See Nippur, Omphalos. Dvir. According to the Book of Exodus God spoke to Moses from the space between the spread pairs of wings of the golden Cherubim , located atop the Ark of the Covenant. After the Temple was built in Jerusalem, the Ark of the Covenant was placed in the Holy of Holies which only the High Priest was allowed to enter and (in a strictly prescribed man- ner) approach the Dvir “and hear the voice [of the Lord] speak unto him from off the overlay which is upon the Ark of the Covenant.” The term, which the King James Bible translated “oracle,” is nowadays usu- ally translated “shrine,” “inner shrine”; but ZS has pointed out that in Hebrew, Dvir literally means ‘Speaker’ — a voice communication device!"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"66 Dzibilchaltun Dzibilchaltun: A Mayan site on the Gulf of Mexico coast of the Yucatan peninsula whose remains — plazas, pyramids and temples — cover an astounding area of some twenty square miles.

Chosen for his scientific knowledge, his mission was to obtain gold from the Gulf’s waters; depicted with flowing streams of water, he was the prototype ‘Aquarius’. He was the Firstborn son of Anu, Nibiru’s ruler, but was not the Legal Heir, for he was mothered by one of Anu’s concubines; the succession privilege belonged to his half-brother Enlil, whose mother was not only Anu’s official spouse but also Anu’s half-sister. Many of the conflicts on Earth stemmed from the rivalry between the two half- brothers; as an accommodation, Anu granted Ea the title En.Ki (= ‘Lord [of] Earth’); but his numerical rank, 40, remained below Enid's 50. When the initial plans failed, he was put in charge of the gold mining operations in southeast Africa. There he discovered the existence of hominids geneti- cally akin to the Anunnaki — leading to his most important feat: The genetic engineering to fashion The Adam. As the creator of Mankind, he frustrated the plan to have it perish in the Deluge, by instructing his faithful follower to build the famed Ark. His ‘cult center’ in Sumer was Eridu; his domain, which he divided between his six sons, was Africa. The Egyptians called him PTAH (‘The Developer’). Described in the texts as a ‘ladies’ man’, his many infidelities included affairs with female Earthlings. His autobiography, found on partly damaged clay tablets, has been used by ZS to compose The Lost Book of Enki.

Earth (Ki, Gi = ‘The Cleaved One’ — from which ‘Gaea’ in Greek, and Latin ‘Geo’ as in Geography): According to the Epic of Creation as interpreted by ZS, Earth was the remaining half of the planet Tiamat that broke up in the ‘Celestial Battle’ with Nibiru/Marduk, shunted by the force of the collision to its present orbit, and pulling along with it Tiamat ’s principal satellite to become our Moon. It was nicknamed “the Seventh” because, counting from the outside in as one enters our solar system from way out, Earth is the seventh planet.

See Day of the Lord, Harran, Nibiru. Ecuador: A country in western South America, so named because it lies astride the Equator. According to local traditions, it was at its Cape Santa Helena which protrudes into the Pacific Ocean that the first settlers to the equatorial regions had arrived by boats, guided by divine instruc- tions emanating from a green stone; archaeological finds there are dated to circa 2500 B.C. It was also there, according to legends, that the “route of Viracocha” led away over the ocean as he left the Americas.

Sumerian tales of the Anunnaki assert that “when Earth was divided,” Africa was allotted to Enki; according to Egyptian lore, the fertile Nile Valley was ruled by the god PTAH (= Enki) and his descendants. After it was inundated by the Deluge, Ptah erected dams and “raised Egypt from under the waters” to make it habitable; then, circa 3100 B.C., Egyptian civiliza- tion with Pharaonic dynasties began. See Ham. Egyptian Religion; The ancient Egyptians’ word for ‘gods’ was NTR, meaning ‘Guardians’; they were Gods of Heaven who, in times immemo- rial, arrived on Earth from the ‘Planet of Millions of Years’ (represented by the celestial Winged Disk). At first only gods reigned in Egypt; according to the priest-historian Manetho the god Ptah, followed by his son Ra and the gods Shu, Geb, Osiris, Seth and Horus, reigned for a total of 12,300 years, followed by a divine dynasty led by Thoth for another 1,570 years. Those gods married half-sisters, fought and even killed each other. Thirty demigods then preceded the Pharaonic dynas- ties that began circa 3100 B.C. — a reason for Pharaohs to claim they too were demigods, entitled to an eternal Afterlife. Memphis in central Egypt was the first royal and religious capital; circa 2200 B.C. upheav- als shifted the power center to Thebes in Upper (= southern) Egypt.

Sumerian and Akkadian texts dealing with ‘Ekur wars of the gods’ (that scholars title “Myths of Kur”) have been shown by ZS to chronicle what he has termed ‘The Pyramid Wars’ (that have actually taken place). El\\ Literally meaning ‘Lofty’, the term derived from the Akkadian Ilu where it designated deity . In the Hebrew Bible too it was the generic word for ‘deity’, but in Canaanite texts El was the personal name of the head of the pantheon— once an active god of Heaven and Earth, but in time aloof and ready to retire together with his spouse Asherah— quite possibly the Moon god Sin and his spouse Nikkal. According to Canaanite texts discovered at a site called Ras Shamra (ancient Ugarit), the couple had three sons, the gods Yam (‘Ocean/Sea’), Baal (‘Lord’) and Mot (‘Smiter, Annihilator’) who were busy fighting each other. The (H) Bible uses Elim as the plural of El in the generic sense, and Elohim when the Anunnaki are involved. See Canaanites, God/gods. Elam: An ancient kingdom in the mountainlands southeast of Sumer; it is first mentioned in the Bible as the land of Shem’s offspring Elam, and its capital Susa was the biblical Shushan in Persian times. An extension of the Sumerian civilization, it was allotted by Enlil to his son Ninurta (whom the Elamites called In-shushinak = ‘Lord of Shushin’).

Elixirs: Virtually universally, tales of the gods include references to an elixir eaten or drunk by the gods to sustain their ‘immortality’. When the Earthling Adapa was taken to Nibiru to be presented to Anu, Enki made sure that he would not partake of the “Food of Life” and the “Waters of Life” lest he attain the “Life of a god.” In the biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, ‘Yahweh-Elohim’ expels them lest they “Take also of the Tree of Life and eat and live forever.” Egyptian texts dealing with the Pharaohs’ Afterlife refer to the gods’ ‘eternal sus- tenance’ and in particular to “the everlasting beverage” — paralleling the ‘Soma’ elixir of Hindo-Aryan tales."},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"Elohim End of Time, End Time 73 Elohim (H): Though usually translated ‘God’, this biblical word is a plural o(El not only grammatically but also in context, as when the Elohim said let us fashion the Adam in our image and after our likeness” (Genesis 1).

A biblical term, first used in Jacob’s oracle about the distant future, but mainly used by the Prophets to describe a future Messianic Time, when evil shall be gone from the Earth, justice and peace will reign — but not without a preceding ter- rible cataclysm, an apocalypse; then there will be a New Beginning, and all nations shall flock to Jerusalem to worship Yahweh. According to the Prophet Jeremiah, Yahweh had planned that ending from the very beginning; the Prophet Isaiah considered the “bowing down” and cowering’ of Marduk and Nabu as essential steps in resuming the Kingdom of God”; and the Prophet Hosea asserted that the “Kingdom of God” will return at the ‘End of Days’ “through the House of David,” in Jerusalem, on the Temple Mount. The biblical Prophets also asserted that what was to come had been planned by God all along— “From the Beginning the Ending I foretell, from ancient times the things that are not yet done [I told]” God was saying to Isaiah. ZS has stressed that the prophesied ‘End of Days’ and the ‘Day of the Lord’, usually treated by scholars as the same set of events, are completely separate and distinct anticipated occurrences: The Day of the Lord was the anticipated return of Nibiru, which took place within the biblical time frame; the timing of the messianic End of Days continued to intrigue beyond the Hebrew Bible’s final book, the Book of Daniel. In The End of Days, ZS, reviewing the various olden and current predictions, has concluded that the time, times and a half time” told to Daniel by an angel refers to Zodiacal Time.

The Esagil was also Marduk’s official residence, attended by a hierarchy of priests. Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian kings came there to receive the god’s blessing for their claim to Babylon’s throne, the last one on record being Cyrus. After the death of Marduk (in 323 B.C. per ZS in The End of Days), the ziggurat served as the god’s tomb. See Babylon, Marduk, Ziggurats. Esarhaddon (also written Asarhaddon): An Assyrian king (680-669 B.C.). The biblical account of the violent circumstances of his succession to the throne in faraway Nineveh, long doubted, were in time corroborated by discovered Assyrian texts. He invaded Egypt and his annals mention the Brook of Egypt in the Sinai and the Qenites residing there, confirming the biblical references to both. His annals report that before embarking on the invasion of Egypt, he went to Harran and paid homage there to an aging god Sin. A stela of Esarhaddon, now in the British Museum, depicts all the emblems of the twelve members of our solar system. Esau: Son of Isaac and Rebecca, twin brother of Jacob. Essenes: The presumed name of the ascetic group that dwelt in Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were found. Etana: A ruler in the Sumerian city Kish. The Sumerian King Lists simply observed after his name: “The one who to Heaven ascended.” But tablets were found with a long text, The Epic of Etana, that tells how this righ- teous king, deprived of a son to succeed him, was provided by the god Utu/Shamash with an ‘Eagle’ to take him to the Divine Abode, there to obtain the “Plant of Birth.” The text describes how, as he was carried by"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"Eternal Life Eve 79 the Eagle ever higher, the Earth appeared smaller and smaller until it dis- appeared from view; at which point the increasingly scared Etana asked to be brought down back to Earth.

(Gilgamesh managed to obtain the plant, only to have it snatched from him by a serpent.) Millennia later, the Spaniards led by Ponce de Leon explored Florida for a rumored Fountain of Eternal Youth there. See also Elixirs, Food of Life, Fountain of Youth, Water of Life. Ethiopia: A land in east Africa, south of the Sudan. Local lore deems it to have been the kingdom of the Queen of Sheba who visited king Solomon in Jerusalem, and considers Ethiopian kings as descended of Solomon. Euphrates River: A major river that, together with the Tigris River, irri- gates and delineates Mesopotamia (‘The Land Between The Rivers’). Starting in the north in the mountains in Anatolia, and enhanced there by several tributaries, it flows all the way to the Persian Gulf in the south. Many major cities and cultural centers from Sumer on dotted the river’s course; being navigable once it left the highlands, it was also an essential transportation and trade route. Called Puratu in Akkadian, it is the bib- lical river Prath that was one of the four ‘Rivers of Paradise’. According to the Bible, the Euphrates River delineated the eastern boundary of the lands covenanted by God to Abraham and his descendants. Eve: The name of Adam’s female counterpart and wife. The Bible calls her (H) Hava (= She of Life’), and had her fashioned out of Adam’s rib (thus, ‘She of the Rib’) — two aspects that may stem from the Sumerian word Ti that means both ‘Life’ and Rib’.

Titled Shemoth (‘Names’) in Hebrew, after its opening verse (“Now these are the names of the children of Israel”), it is called ‘Exodus’ in English. Because most scholars identify the oppressive Pharaoh of the events as Ramses II, the Exodus is usually dated to the mid 13th century B.C. The Bible itself, however, states that the Exodus took place 480 years before Solomon began to build the Temple in Jerusalem (I Kings 6); this and other synchronizations have led ZS to conclude that the Exodus began in 1433 B.C. Such dating places the Exodus in the context of geopoliti- cal and religious events of the time: The palace intrigues involving the 18th dynasty in Egypt, the Egyptian military thrusts against Mitanni and Hatti, and the contests for control of the Space-related sites of the Anunnaki.

Fifty: A number that signified the hierarchical rank of Enlil (next to Anus sixty). In the struggle for succession on Earth, the Rank of Fifty was extended by Enlil to his Legal Heir Ninurta by naming a new temple for Ninurta E.Ninnu, “House/temple of Fifty.” When Marduk finally assumed supremacy on Earth, it was formalized by granting him “The Fifty Names” at an Assembly of the ‘Fifty Great Gods’. Those fifty names were added to the original six-tablet Sumerian ‘Epic of Creation’ as a sev- enth tablet in its Babylonian version.

Giants: The lore of many peoples includes tales of giants, especially so when it comes to explaining who was able to haul and emplace the colossal stone blocks at such sites as Baalbek in Lebanon, the promontory above Cuzco in Peru, or the edifices in Tiahuanacu in Bolivia. In Mexico, the Aztec stone calendar depicts four Ages, the first of which was that of the “White Haired Giants; a giant statue of the Goddess of Water was discovered in Mexico City, and at Tula there stand the statues of the giant ‘Atlantes’. In Mexico’s central zone bordering the Gulf of Mexico, giant stone heads of African-looking men were found at Olmec sites. In South America, var- ied legends tell of ‘giants’ who arrived by sea and settled on the Pacific coast; there, Mochica paintings depict giants, with black or blackened faces, being served by smaller enslaved natives; and the great Temple of Pachacamac south of Lima had a golden statue of a giant. In the ancient Near East, Hittite kings were depicted being embraced by a god double the kings’ size; and the Bible speaks of the giantlike Og, king of Bashan, and of Goliath the Philistine whose height of “six cubits and a span” equaled more than 9 feet. ZS tells how he was drawn to the subject of his writings when, as a schoolboy, he questioned the reading in Genesis 6 of the word Nefilim as giants because they were Anakim — a term commonly taken to mean giants but which ZS has shown to be the rendering in Hebrew of the Sumerian Anunnaki. Were then Anunnaki ‘gods’ tall and giant- like?

Gilgal (H = Circle of Heaped Stones’): The name given to the place, “east of Jericho, where Joshua put up twelve stones to commemorate the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River by the Israelites as they entered the promised Land at the end of the Exodus. It was also the place where, centuries later, the Prophet Elijah was told by God to cross back the Jordan, to be taken heavenwards in a fiery Whirlwind. Gilgal Repha im: A Stonehenge-like structure on the Golan Heights, east of the Sea of Galilee. It consists of four concentric circles of crude stone walls, rising eight feet, with a complex entryway built of more massive stone boulders and oriented to the winter solstice, suggesting a 3rd mil- lennium B.C. date. An artificial mound in the circles’ center contains a paved vaulted chamber, eleven feet long, that may have served as a burial place. Some objects discovered in the burial chamber are dated to mid-2nd millennium B.C., but the tale in Genesis 31 about a circular stone monu- ment erected by Jacob could support an earlier date. Because the Bible (books of Numbers and Joshua) reported that a giantlike king named Og had once reigned in that area, and he was (like Goliath) a descendant of a godlike race called Repha im, Israeli archaeologists gave the site its current name Gilgal Repha im (— The Stone Gircles of the Repha’im’).

ZS has treated such ‘myths’ as records and recollections of actual events, and has suggested that the similarities are due to the fact that worldwide these gods were the same original group of the Sumerian Anunnaki (= ‘Those who from heaven to Earth came’): The Hittite Teshub was the Akkadian Adad, and so was (per ZS) the Andean Viracocha ; the Mesoamerican Quetzalcoatl was (per ZS) the Egyptian Thoth (and the Sumerian Ningishzidda); the Greek Cronus paralleled the Sumerian Anu, the Olympian Zeus and Poseidon reflected the Mesopotamian Ea and Enlil, as did the Canaanite Baal and Yam, and so were the legend- ary Hindu gods Vishnu, Indra and Vritra. The aerial battles of Zeus versus Typhon or Horus versus Seth paralleled those of Ninurta ver- sus Zu, and so on and on. Capable of roaming the skies and possessing extraordinary weapons, they were all so humanlike — except for one cru- cial difference from Mankind: their presumed immortality. But in fact all the tales, including Sumerian, Akkadian, Canaanite, Egyptian, Aztec etc., recorded instances of the death of gods (such as Zu and Dumuzi in Sumerian lore, Osiris in Egyptian, Ba’al in Canaanite, the Aztec goddess Coyolxauhqui). The ‘immortality’ (per ZS) was simply extreme longev- ity, stemming from the fact that for the Anunnaki (and their life cycle) one year on Nibiru — meaning one orbit around the Sun — equaled some 3,600 Earth-years. The existence of those gods with a small ‘g’ not only does not conflict with the belief in a sole universal God with a capi- tal ‘G’, but confirms the view (held by the Anunnaki themselves) of a cosmic ‘Creator of All’ — the biblical Yahtveh, whom the Bible calls “El Elohim ” — ‘God of the gods’, and who told the Elohim gods per Psalm 82: “You are Elohim, all of you sons of the Most High; but you shall die as men do.” See An (Anu), Anunnaki, Enki, Enlil, Marduk, Yahweh.

It is the most malleable and duc- tile of all known metals; it can be stretched, made into thinnest wires, sheets, foil, grains or dust (and nowadays even reduced to its atoms); it can be melted, cast, shaped, hammered and alloyed; it is non-corrosive, and a perfect electrical conductor. The first metal known to Mankind, it was considered from the earliest times the property of the gods; it was used by them when communicating with mankind (a golden wand given by Viracocha in Peru, golden Cherubim upon the Ark of the Covenant to hear Yahweh). In both the Old World and the New World, Holy of Holies and divine abodes were entirely covered with gold to form golden enclosures, outfitted with golden emblems, golden ritual objects, and golden utensils. According to Sumerian texts the Anunnaki mined gold in southeast Africa (Arali = ‘Place of the shiny lodes’), from the mines of the Ab.zu (= Primeval Deep’). The texts attributed the gods’ decision to fashion Man to a need for Primitive Workers in order to take over the Anunnaki’s toil in the mines after a mutiny of the Anunnaki. Utilizing extant texts to reconstruct a cohesive narrative, ZS saw the Anunnaki’s need of gold with which to protect the dwindling atmosphere of Nibiru as their reason for coming to Earth. At first Ea arrived with fifty Anunnaki hoping to obtain gold from the waters of the Persian Gulf; when that failed, a full fledged Earth Mission under Enlil’s command was put into operation, requiring mining of gold in southeast Africa. When the Anunnaki there mutinied, Man was fashioned.

There was a golden enclosure in the main shrine of the Chimu people in northern Peru. In Puma Punku in Bolivia, four cham- bers, each hewn out of a colossal rock, were completely covered inside with plates of gold.

The Holy of Holies in Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem was similarly entirely plated within with gold.

Its sides were originally covered by a casing of white limestone blocks of about 15 tons each, angled to have the pyramid rise at the steep angle of 52°. The Pyramid’s total mass is calculated to have been 93 million cubic feet, weighing some 7,000,000 tons. Inside, the pyramid contains an amazing array of perfectly aligned chambers, pas- sages, shafts, niches, and a grand gallery, whose purposes or functions remain a mystery.

Greece, Greek Civilization: Greece as a country — Hellas in Greek — extends in southern Europe into the Mediterranean Sea, encompassing the large island of Crete, the renowned island of Rhodes, and many other islands in the eastern Mediterranean; Greek settlements (including the famed Troy) extended into Asia Minor. As a result, Greece formed a cultural bridge between Europe and the Near Eastern civilizations, borrowing their scien- tific knowledge, alphabet, religions, and pantheon. The Greeks described their gods as anthropomorphic, akin to men and women physically and in character, but immortal; led by a pantheon of twelve Olympians headed by Zeus, who attained his supremacy after many conflicts and wars.

Per ZS, these are all references to the expected Return of Nibiru. See Day of the Lord. Habiru: In the 18th and 17th centuries B.C., Assyrian and Babylonian annals made references to bands of marauders, calling them Hapiru. In the 15th century B.C. a message from an Egyptian commander in Canaan to his superiors in Egypt complained of attacks by APIRU. Some scholars have suggested that those were references to Hebrew tribes who entered Egypt. However, apart from the similar sound of the names, there appears to be no basis for these theories.

It is named after the British Astronomer Edward Halley who at the end of the 17th century A.D. determined the comet’s orbital period and correctly predicted its next visibility. Astronomers and historians have since ascertained that the comet was known (and observed) in antiquity, when it was deemed a harbinger of events in heaven and on Earth. It was extensively studied during its most recent near-Earth passage, in 1986.

Situated at the intersection of trade routes, it became a major home-away-from-home for the famed ‘Merchants of Ur’ who bought there sheepskins and wool and sold there woven fabrics and garments. In time, the temple in Harran to Ur’s god Nannar/Sin became second in importance to the one in Ur. The Bible relates that Abraham’s father Terah moved from Ur to Harran with his family; and after Abraham moved on to Canaan, the wives of his son Isaac and grandson Jacob were chosen from the Terahites who stayed on in Harran. Harran also played major roles in the affairs of the gods and the histories of Babylonia and Assyria: Marduk stayed there in a crucial period of his struggle for supremacy. (For the significance of these interwoven events, and the crucial year 2048 B.C., see The End of Days by ZS.) As events neared the End, the Assyrian royal family made its last stand in Harran before Assyria’s demise; and the last king of Babylon was granted there the throne due to his mother who was High Priestess in Harran. At the closing chapter of the Anunnaki tale, Nannar/Sin left Earth from Harran (but relented and returned); Harran was thus a witness and a stage for 4,000 years of history.

The local skirmishes grew to a countrywide revolt, and in a series of fierce battles the Hashmoneans succeeded to free the land, cleanse the Temple of the idols, and restart the Holy Flame in 160 B.C.; the miracle ol a bit of sacred oil lasting eight days has since been celebrated by Jews as the holiday of Hanukkah. The Hashmoneans re-established Judea as an independent Jewish state, and ruled it as its kings until the Romans occupied the land a century later. ZS has linked the Hasmonean uprising and the imperative of restarting the Temple’s Holy Flame by 160 B.C. to the Calendar of Nippur and to the End of Days prophecies in the Book of Daniel.

HATHOR (Hat-Hor, Abode of Horus’): A great early Egyptian goddess whose domain was the Sinai peninsula — especially its southern moun- tainous part, where turquoise mines were located (and thus her epithet, ‘Lady of the Mines’). She was depicted in Egyptian art with cow’s horns flanking a planet as her headdress, and as she grew older she was nick- named ‘The Cow’. ZS has suggested that she was the goddess whom the Sumerians called Ninmah, who as a peacemaker between the warring Anunnaki clans was assigned the neutral Fourth Region — the Sinai pen- insula. There, her son Ninurta built her a mountain abode, and she was granted the epithet Ninharsag (= ‘Lady of the Mountain Peak’). As she aged, the Sumerians depicted her with a cowlike head.

Giving the adopted child a name that included MOSE was thus in line with that dynasty’s cus- tom. The standard dating of the Exodus to the 13th century B.C. places the story of Moses in the context of Ramses II and Egypt’s 19th dynasty; but ZS has shown that the biblical dating of Solomon’s Temple in rela- tion to the Exodus (I Kings 6:1 and I Chronicles 5:36) places Moses in the 15th century B.C., exactly at the time of Hatshepsut.

Hindu Traditions: Knowledge of the historical, prehistorical and religious traditions of the ancient peoples of the Indian subcontinent comes from texts in the Sanskrit language (such as the Vedas, Puranas and other ‘ancient writings’) together with epic tales (such as the Mahabharata and the Ramayana); though written down circa 200 B.C., they are revered as being not of human origin, held to have been originally composed by the gods themselves; but, scholars believe, brought to the Indian subcon- tinent by 2nd millennium migrants from the Caucasus. The complex tales of the Hindu gods and demigods parallel in many aspects the Greek ones, with three principal victors of divine conflicts — Indra, Agni, and Surya (as the three Greek Zeus, Poseidon and Hades). Many similarities to Hittite and Hurrian tales (scholars call them all ‘mythologies’) natu- rally suggest a common source, such as the Sumerian three: Anu, Enki and Enlil. See Indo-European, Indra.

ZS holds that such a cyclical view of history rules out End of Time considerations according to linear calendars (such as the A.

Archaeological discoveries in central Turkey (where the Hittite capital Hattu-shas was located) and royal records uncovered in Egypt, Assyria, and Babylon confirmed the existence of a once mighty Kingdom of Hatti that, at the end of the 2nd millennium B.C., vied with those other empires for control of the ancient Near East. Though Hittite tales of the wars of gods and demigods resemble the Hindu-Aryan tales in the Vedas, it is certain that they adopted the Sumerian pantheon, venerating Enlil’s son Ishkur lAdad as their national god Teshub (= ‘The Windblower’— ‘The Storm God’ in most current translations). The Hittites might have been the first to introduce horse-drawn chariots into battle, and in 1595 B. C. they successfully invaded Babylon and took Marduk prisoner.

Archaeologists have found such a tripartite division in other Near Eastern temples, with architectural names harking back to Akkadian ( Ulammu ) and Sumerian (E.gal). Remarkably, Inca and pre-Inca temples in South America also included a sacred Holy of Holies that — like the one con- structed by Solomon — were encased in gold. But there, as in Egyptian temples, the Holy of Holies was so built that on Solstice Day the sun’s rays would shine in and light up a god’s effigy; the Jerusalem Temple was built on an East-West (equinoctial) alignment. The Holy of Holies in the Jerusalem Temple was completely inlaid with gold, making it similar in this respect to the Golden Enclosures associated with Anu’s visits to Earth.

It is noteworthy that this classification of nations by their common linguistic origin matches the biblical Table of Nations (Genesis 10) and the list for the offspring of Noah’s son Japhet. Indra: A major member of the Hindu pantheon. He slew his father, and fought his own brothers (using missiles in aerial battles) for the leader- ship of the gods; but though supreme in the end, he had to share con- trol with his brothers Agni and Surya. The tales parallel those about the Greek gods. See Aditi, Hindu Traditions, Jupiter, Zeus. Indus Valley Civilization: A major civilization that developed in the 3rd millennium B.C. in the Indian subcontinent, along the Indus River, and lasted till mid-2nd millennium B.C. Archaeological remains of two main urban centers, Harrapa and Mohenjo-Daru, suggest an agriculture-based hierarchical society that started suddenly and ended abruptly. ZS believes that this was the Third Region of civilization the Anunnaki granted to Mankind, circa 2800 B.C. under the aegis of Inanna. The very few arti- facts discovered depict gods with horned headdresses and worship of a naked and bejeweled goddess; but with no written texts discovered, a possible kinship to Sumer can only be surmised from Sumerian texts.

Iron (An.ta), Iron Age: The change from bronze as the strongest metal for tools and weapons to iron required major technological advances, ranging from mining, smelting, refining, and melting to casting. Archaeological evidence indicates that the change took place in the ancient Near East circa 1200 B.C. Textual evidence, however, suggests earlier familiarity with iron: Egyptian tales of the contending of Horus and Seth — long before Pharaonic times — describe the granting by Horus to his human followers of “weapons that were forged” (i.e., made of iron). The Bible (Genesis 4) records that Tobal-Kain, a descendant of the accursed Cain, was “an artificer of gold and copper and iron,” presumably even before the Deluge. In Deuteronomy, the Promised Land is described — at the time of the Exodus, 15th century B.C. — as “a land whose stones are iron and of whose mountains thou canst hew copper.” Isaac (H Itzhak ): The second Patriarch of the Hebrew people, Abraham’s son by his wife Sarah, born to both in old age as predicted by one of three divine beings who paid the couple a visit. Though Abraham already had a son by Sarah’s handmaiden Hagar, it was Isaac who was the legal heir and patriarchal successor. ZS has postulated that this paralleled the suc- cession rules of the Anunnaki, in accordance with which a son born by a sister-wife was the Legal Heir even if not the Firstborn; and the Bible identified Sarah as a half-sister of Abraham (“Indeed she is my sister, the daughter of my father but not of my mother”). The Hebrew patriarchal line then continued through Isaac’s son Jacob.

When Sarah herself had later a son (Isaac) as a result of divine intervention, the older Ishmael mocked Isaac, and Sarah insisted that Hagar and Ishmael leave Abraham’s household.

He had twelve sons, the forefathers of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. On one of his divine encounters, he wrestled with an angelic person, who renamed Jacob Isra-El , “for thou hast wrestled with El” For the other divine encounter, see Jacob’s Dream. Before he died, Jacob blessed his twelve sons in an oracle about the End of Days, in which scholars find hints of the twelve zodiacal constellations. ZS has pointed out that before the twelfth son (Benjamin) was born in Canaan, the Bible lists Jacob’s Harran offspring as eleven sons and one daughter — paralleling the Sumerian count of eleven ‘male’ and one ‘female’ (Ishtar = Venus) members of the Solar System. See Harran, Israel. Jacob s Dream: According to Genesis 28, as Jacob (on his way from Beer- Sheba in Canaan to Harran) lay to sleep one night in a field, he was awakened by a dream-vision of “a ladder set up on the earth and its top reaching heavenwards” on which “angels of the Elohim were going up and down;” and God appeared and spoke to him. Realizing what he had witnessed, Jacob said: “How awesome is this place! Indeed, this is none but an abode of the Elohim , and this is the Gateway to Heaven;” and he named the place Beth-El , God’s Abode.

Jehu: A king in ancient Israel who is depicted bowing to the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III (858-824 B.C.) on the latter’s memorial stone column (now on display in the British Museum). Jeremiah (H Yirme-Yahu = ‘Yahweh will lift me’): A major biblical Prophet in Jerusalem during the politically and militarily turbulent times (626- 586 B.C.), when Assyria, Babylonia and Egypt contended for domina- tion in the Near East. Guided by his faith, high moral principles of justice, and impressively versed in international affairs, Jeremiah called on the people to put their faith in Yahweh as he foresaw coming events — including the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by the Babylonians (and the subsequent fall of Babylon!) — as part of a divine plan to mete out punishment where due, and salvation when it was earned, “at the End of Days.” Jericho (H Yeriho = ‘[City] of the Moon [god]’): A city just north of the Dead Sea, on the way from Jerusalem to the east side of the Jordan River, that has been continuously settled from very ancient times — archaeological evidence suggests as far back as 7500 B.C.

Jericho also featured in the journey of the Prophet Elijah, to go across the Jordan River in order to be taken aloft by a fiery whirlwind. See Elijah, Joshua, Siduri, Tell Ghassul. Jerusalem: (H Yeru-shala’yim, probably from Ur-Shalem = ‘City of the Complete One’): Already a sacred city at the time of Abraham (he was greeted there by the priest of “The God Most High” during the War of the Kings), it was where — presumably on Mount Moriah, the city’s site of a great artificial platform — Abraham was ready to sacri- fice Isaac on God’s command. Though situated neither at a trade or military crossroads nor on the banks of a river, always short of water, not surrounded by farmland or grazing meadows, and with no natural resources of any kind, Jerusalem has remained settled and coveted by conquerors throughout the millennia. David made it his capital, and Solomon built on the platform the Temple to Yahweh; Jesus’ coming there launched Christianity, and Moslems believe that Mohammed went there for an ascent to Heaven. Why Jerusalem, why there? In his writings, ZS has shown that after the Deluge had destroyed the Anunnaki’s Mission Control Center (Nippur) in Mesopotamia, they relocated the Spaceport to the Sinai peninsula and chose Jerusalem, for its geographic location, to serve as the post-Diluvial Mission Control Center at an equidistant point in the new Landing Corridor. ZS suggests in The End of Days that past attacks on Jerusalem by the Egyptians, Assyrians and Babylonians, as recorded in the Bible, were fights for controlling this ‘Bond-Heaven Earth’ — a role that has been central to the messianic prophecies about a future “New Jerusalem” to come after ‘Armageddon’, and thus also central to current events.

It was a tripartite structure with its innermost section serving as a Holy of Holies, with the Ark of the Covenant placed upon the Sacred Rock where (according to tradition) Abraham was ready to sacrifice Isaac. Oriented east-west, the Temple was an eter- nal equinoctial temple. Called in Hebrew Beth Ha-Mikdash (= ‘The Dedicated/Sacred House’), it was intended, according to the Bible, to serve a dual purpose: As the place for Yahweh’s Shem (trans- lated ‘Presence’) on Earth, and the place where He could hear the people’s prayers, when the High Priest entered the Holy of Holies and approached the Ark of the Covenant. With all the similarities to other temples, the Jerusalem temple was unique in that it con- tained absolutely no statue or effigy; the only object within it was the Ark of the Covenant. That temple, completed after seven years in 953 B.C., was destroyed by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar in 587/586 B.C. After the Achaemean/Persian king Cyrus captured Babylon in 539 B.C., he allowed Judean exiles to return and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem. Known as the ‘Second Temple’, its rebuild- ing was completed exactly on the 70th anniversary of its destruction, as had been predicted by the Prophet Jeremiah. In the 2nd century B.C., the Greek-Seleucid rulers of the Asian parts of Alexander the Great’s empire became intent on Hellenizing Judea and convert- ing the Temple to the worship of Zeus— actions that triggered the Jewish revolt of 164 B.C. and the rededication of the Temple in 160 B.C. The Second Temple was aggrandized by king Herod (1st cen- tury B.C.), only to be destroyed again, by the Romans, in A.D. 70. The victory Arch of Titus in Rome depicts Roman soldiers carrying off some of the Temple’s sacred objects.

He grew up in the Galilee; but following a family tra- dition to spend the Passover holiday in Jerusalem, came to Jerusalem in the spring of A.D. 30 (or 33) with his twelve disciples, preaching to his fellow Jews and challenging the city’s Roman masters (Pontius Pilate was the governing Procurator). The events described in the Gospels culmi- nated during the ‘Last Supper’ — actually, the Jewish Seder, the symbol- filled ritual evening meal that ushers in the Passover holiday — when Jesus was arrested, then tried and executed on the cross by the Romans. The mysterious disappearance of his body from the temporary burial cave gave rise to the belief in his resurrection and divinity, and eventually to Christianity. ZS, in The End of Days, puts those events in the context of the messianic expectations of that time, in which the resumption of the Davidic kingship by an ‘Anointed One’ (. Mashi’ah in Hebrew, from which Chrystos in Greek and Messiah/Christ in English) was required as a prelude to the return of the Kingdom of Heaven, and suggests that the traditional Seder wine chalice, mentioned in the New Testament, is an important clue in understanding the prophetic background of those events.

Though it is neither a mighty river nor really running deep, it has served from time immemorial as a natural divide between the desertlike lands to its east and the more fertile lands to its west.

Speaking an unfamiliar lan- guage, Kassite kings bearing names such as Karaindash and Kadashman ruled over Babylon (which they called Karduniash) from at least 1560 B.C. to 1160 B.C.

That changed in 1897, when the Assyriologist Theophilus Pinches reported at the Victoria Institute in London that a group of clay tablets in the British Museum, which has since been known as ‘The Khedorla’omer Texts’, described such a war and named the Elamite king Kudur-Lagamar as a participant.

King, Kingship: The institution of kings and kingship was begun in Sumer. Texts known as the ‘Sumerian King Lists’ assert that “Kingship was brought down from Heaven,” not merely suggesting that Kingship was a gift of the gods to Mankind, but also that it instituted on Earth a form of government practiced by the Anunnaki themselves on their home planet. The symbols of Kingship — a tiara or crown, a scepter, and a shepherd’s staff — were stated in the texts to have been brought down to Earth by Anu. The Sumerian term for ‘king’ was Lu.gal (= ‘Great Man’) who at first was a demigod and later on an ‘Anointed One’ chosen by the gods, intermediary between the gods and Mankind whose role was to be a shepherd of the people, and Sumerian kings strived to attain, through justice and benevolent rule, the title En.si (= ‘Righteous Shepherd’). In the Bible, anointing (with oil) as signify- ing choice and appointment to kingship was performed by the prophet Samuel in respect to David. See also Arba. King Lists: While the most familiar record of the succession of kings (in this case, of Judea and Israel) are the Bible’s books I and II Kings, the custom of listing kings in a chronological order with informa- tion about their reigns was started in Sumer; the texts known as the ‘Sumerian King Lists’ in fact begin with ten pre-Diluvial rulers (eight of them divine, two demigods) and resumed the kingship after the Deluge. The Babylonians and Assyrians etc. continued the tradition of king lists. In Egypt, the priest Manetho (3rd century B.C.) listed the rulers by dynasties, also starting with a divine one, followed by demigods, and then by Pharaohs.

A fortified city in Judea whose capture by the Assyrian king Sennacherib (701 B.C.) is recorded in the Bible (2 Kings and Isaiah) — and corroborated by the Assyrian king, who depicted the capture on his monuments. Lagash: A Sumerian city that served as the ‘cult center’ of the god Ninurta, where — already in the 24th century B.C. — its king Urukagina promul- gated a Code of Laws based on social justice. One of its famed kings, Gudea (22nd century B.C.), described in detailed texts inscribed on two large clay cylinders (that can now be seen in the Louvre in Paris) how he built a new temple for the god Ninurta and his spouse Bau in the Girsu, the city’s sacred precinct. The instructions for the temple’s building were given to the king in a kind of ‘Twilight Zone’ dream, parts of which turned out to be real. See E.ninnu, Girsu, Gudea, Ninurta.

See Evil Wind, Nuclear Weapons, Sumer. Landing Corridor: Per ZS, the Anunnaki located their spaceports — the pre-Diluvial and the post-Diluvial ones — as part of patterns of natu- ral and artificial landmarks forming a triangular Landing Corridor, anchored on the twin peaks of Ararat as an apex. At the epicenter, equidistant from other landmarks, was Mission Control Center — Nippur the first time, Jerusalem after the Deluge. The two great pyra- mids of Giza, ZS showed in diagrams, were part of the post-Diluvial landmark and landing system. See Jerusalem, Nippur, Spaceport. Landing Place: The term used in the Epic of Gilgamesh to describe his first destination in his Search Lor Immortality: “A secret place of the Anunnaki” in the Cedar Lorest, a place guarded by a ferocious artificial or robotic creature — Baalbek in Lebanon, per ZS. Gilgamesh described seeing there a fiery rocket launched heavenwards. See Baalbek, Cedar Lorest, Gilgamesh, Huwawa. Larak (La.ra.ak = ‘Seeing the bright halo’): The third ‘City of the gods’ established by the Anunnaki in the E.din. ZS has shown that it was located so that it served as a component of the pre-Diluvial Landing Corridor. Larsa (La.ar.sa = ‘Seeing the red light’): A seventh ‘City of the gods’ in the E.din that, per ZS, served as a component of the pre-Diluvial Landing Corridor.

See Elijah, Jerusalem, Jesus, Passover. La Venta: A major Olmec site near the Gulf of Mexico coast, where some of the first Olmec colossal sculpted stone heads were found. Law Codes: Though the Law Code of Hammurabi, the 18th century B.C. Babylonian king, comes mostly to people’s minds, the fact is that the practice of enacting a series of laws to form a ‘law code’ goes back to ancient Sumer — the oldest of which (thus far discovered) was by king Urukagina six centuries earlier. While the Hammurabi and other Babylonian decrees were primarily lists of crimes and their punishments, the Sumerian ones were laws of social justice, protecting the poor, the daily laborers, widows. The Ten Commandments that Moses received on Mount Sinai (15th century B.C.) are a unique law code that lists with brevity and clarity the essential religious, social and moral do’s and don’ts. Lebanon: So named after its Lebanon (= ‘The Place of Whiteness’) mountain ranges, which are snow covered in winter in the otherwise semi-tropical Near East. Lamed from antiquity for its unique Cedar forest — the location, according to the Epic of Gilgamesh, of the gods’ Landing Place and its awesome guardians.

In ancient Egypt it was believed that a Pharaoh could not journey to the Afterlife unless the god Thoth weighed the king’s heart in balancing scales, and found it “not wanting.” Lion: The zodiacal constellation the Sumerians called Ur.gal (= ‘Lion’), and so depicted it. The lion was considered the ‘cult animal’ of Inanna/ Ishtar, and she was frequently depicted standing upon a lion. The Epic of Gilgamesh relates that when he was wandering lost in a desert, he encoun- tered two lions and slew them both with his bare hands. The feat assumed legendary status and depictions of Gilgamesh wrestling the lions have been found throughout the ancient world — and, ZS has pointed out, even in pre-Columbian South America. Long Count Calendar: A Mesoamerican calendar, introduced by the Olmecs and used by the Mayans, that recorded dates by counting the number of days that had passed from a “Day One” in 3113 B.C. (Per ZS, when the god Thoth arrived in Mesoamerica with a group of his African followers). Various numbers of days were grouped and represented by a hieroglyph; the one called Baktun (= 144,000 days) features in so-called ‘Mayan Prophecies’ regarding the year A.D. 2012. See Calendars, Mayas, Olmecs, Quetzalcoatl. Lost Tribes of Israel: The disappeared descendants of the ten tribes that broke off from Judea after the death of king Solomon and formed the Kingdom of Israel, who were exiled en masse by the Assyrians in 724/720 B.C. and vanished in the fog of history. Because of many simi- larities in tales and customs by the native Americans, the first European explorers of the New World believed that they had found the ‘Ten Lost Tribes’. See Israel (Kingdom).

See Erra, War of the Kings. Lower Sea: The Sumerian/Akkadian name for what is now called the Persian Gulf. Lower World: In Mesopotamian texts, the designation of the southern tip of Africa that was the domain of Ereshkigal (a sister of Inanna) and her spouse Nergal (a son of Enki). An array of scientific instruments located there predicted the Deluge. A text titled ‘Inanna’s Descent to the Lower World’ describes the place and tells how Inanna, going there uninvited, was put to death (and how she was brought back to life). See Dumuzi, Ereshkigal, Inanna, Nergal. Lu.gal (= ‘Great Man’): The Sumerian term translated ‘king’. Lugal.banda: A king of Uruk (Inanna’s center in Sumer) who, according to the Sumerian King Lists and other texts, was a demigod — the son of Inanna by Uruk’s previous king, Enmerkar.

Machu Picchu: In 1911 the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham found an abandoned city in the Incan realm in Peru, and described it in his books Machu Picchu, a Citadel of the Incas and The Lost City of the Incas — an epithet that has become inseparable from the place. Situated on a mountain peak amongst skyscraping Andean mountains, it is an enchanting place of mystery, featuring walls of large interlocking stone blocks, a row of three windows, a stone sun dial, a semi-circular win- dowed structure built with perfect ashlars, a sacred rock within a cave.

Did its builders, who preceded the presumed builders of the 52° Giza pyramids, pioneer the idea of such pyramids (as most Egyptologists think) or try (as some, including ZS, believe) to emulate the Giza ones that had already existed? The puzzle of this pyramid has thus a bearing on the issue of When and By Whom were the unique Giza pyramids built. Mal’akhim-. A biblical Hebrew term literally meaning ‘Emissaries’, but usually translated ‘angels’. See Angels. Man, Mankind: Discoveries in East Africa of hominid skeletal remains document the slow progression of the human species over millions of years from ancestral apelike primates; but this evolutionary evidence has failed to explain the sudden transformation — overnight, in evolu- tionary timetables — from a bipedal ‘Homo erectus’ to ‘Homo sapiens’ (‘Thinking Man’) — us — that occurred inexplicably some 300,000 years ago. ZS has suggested that this problem of the “Missing Link” is resolved by the Sumerian texts that describe a deliberate feat by the Anunnaki (specifically, Enki and Ninharsag) of genetic engineering, of adding some of their genes to those of a Homo erectus. It is a feat, he claims, that also explains the biblical assertion in Genesis that The Adam was fashioned deliberately by the Elohim “in their image and after their likeness.” The Garden of Eden episode with the ‘Serpent’, ZS wrote, deals with a second genetic engineering feat by Enki, of granting to the hybrid the ability to procreate.

Manetho (Greek from MEN-THOTH = ‘Gift of Thoth’): A 3rd century B.C. Egyptian priest who was retained by the Ptolemaic-Greek rulers of Egypt (after the death of Alexander) to write for them the history of Egypt and its kings. His writings arranged the rulers by dynasties — beginning with a time when gods alone ruled, then demigods, then Pharaohs. The first divine dynasty of seven gods was begun by PTAH (= Enki, per ZS) who was succeeded by his son RA (= Marduk per ZS). The total length of time of the pre-Pharaonic reigns was 17,870 years, i.e. started some 10,000 years before the Deluge. Manetho also provided the estimated “duration of the world” as 2,160,000 years (a number, ZS has pointed out, that represented 1,000 zodiacal ages of 2,160 years each). See Ages, Demigods, History/Cyclical, Zodiac. Mar.duk (= ‘Son of the Pure Mound’): Best known as the national god of Babylon, where earlier canonical texts, such as the Epic of Creation, were revised to grant him also celestial supremacy as the Creator Planet, changing its name from Nibiru to ‘Marduk’. He was the Foremost son of Ea/Enki, born on Nibiru and brought over to Earth by his mother Damkina. Found guilty of the death of his younger brother Dumuzi, Marduk was buried alive inside the Great Pyramid but was spared and was exiled — but then alienated the other Anunnaki leaders, and espe- cially Enlil, when he broke a taboo by taking an Earthling female as a wife (who bore him a son, Nabu). Witnessing his father’s constant yet futile contesting with Enlil for the succession rights, he took up the struggle for supremacy of which, he believed, his father was unjustly deprived.

It was then that Babylon was made an imperial city, with an imposing sacred precinct dominated by a seven-stage ziggurat, the Esagil; it served as the god’s abode, head- quarters, and finally as his tomb. (According to Greek and Roman histo- rians of that time, Marduk’s tomb was within the Esagil ziggurat, which was attacked by the Persian king Xerxes in 482 B.C.; ZS has there- fore concluded that Marduk died in 484 B.C.). In seeking supremacy, Marduk did not introduce monotheism; once he won the Rank of Fifty, he invited the other gods (Enlilites included) to reside in Babylon’s sacred precinct, ordering the building of residential shrines for them; indeed, being Supreme required the existence and recognition of other deities.

It was pictorially depicted on cylinder seals as a six-rayed planet, indicating (per ZS) that the Anunnaki counted it as the sixth planet as they entered the solar system from way out. ZS has shown that it served as a Way Station for the Anunnaki in their space journeys between Nibiru and Earth, and suggested that it was the principal base for the shuttling Igi.gi astronauts. While that was considered impossible when The 12th Planet was published (in 1976) because Mars was deemed an uninhabitable planet, subsequent multiple studies of the planet by NASA and European nations has shown that Mars in fact once had an atmosphere, lakes, rivers and flowing waters, and was habitable. NASA photographs from Mars also show what appear to be remains of artificial structures; but they have not been pursued by NASA’s subsequent orbit- ers and rovers.

See Chichen Itza, Balam, Mesoamerica. Mayan Calendar: Mayan monuments, whose hieroglyphic writing described actual events, frequently bore a date expressed in glyphs of the ‘Long Count’ adopted from the Olmecs. The glyphs stood for ‘Kin’ (= a day), ‘Uinal’ (= 20 days), ‘Tun’ (= 360 days), ‘Ka-tun’ (= 20 x 360 = 7,200 days), ‘Bak-tun’ (= 20 x 20 x 360 = 144,000 days) and so on. Each category was multiplied by a number (represented by dots and bars) next to it; it all added up to a grand total of days that had passed from a Day One (that scholars determined to have been equal to August 13, 3113 B.C.). Accordingly, we are now in the 13th Baktun; and some believe that when it completes its 144,000 days’ count, so-called ‘Mayan Prophecies’ will come into play. See Calendars.

Some, as at Tiahuanacu and Puma Punku near Lake Titicaca in the Andean mountains, are formed into huge chambers or gateways, each one carved out of a single colossal stone; and then there is the unique stone platform and towering structure at Baalbek in Lebanon, with cut and shaped megaliths weighing more than 1,000 tons each. In all these instances, the stones — in spite of their great weight — were brought to the site from some other distant source, apparently selected for some particular quality. How the feat of transporting, raising and erecting (and sometimes cutting to shape) such colossal weights by the ‘primi- tive’ locals was achieved, remains a mystery — unless legendary ‘giants’, or the gods, were involved.

Exodus chapters 28, 29) or king (viz. I and II Samuel, re Saul and David) was consecrated by pouring oil on his head. In Mesopotamian texts, it was Sargon of Akkad who claimed to have been “the anointed priest of Anu.” In the Bible, the ritual (that was at first also applicable to objects, e.g., when Jacob anointed with oil the stone monument at Beth-El, the “Gateway to Heaven”), evolved to signify a king or king-priest conse- crated and chosen by God to carry out His plan (as when Yahweh called the Persian Cyrus “My Anointed One”).

Starting in the previous millennium, it was the land of the Hurrians (biblical ‘Horites’), people of Indo-European origin who adopted the Sumerian-Akkadian culture and religion but retained god and royal names in a language akin to Sanskrit. Written records from the time, that include correspondence between Mitannian kings and Egyptian Pharaohs, detail how repeated Egyptian forays to capture the upper Euphrates regions — including attacks by Egypt’s ‘Napoleon’ Thothmes III — were blocked by Mitanni both militarily and diplomati- cally. ZS has suggested that the biblical tale of the events leading to the Exodus, in which the Egyptians feared that the Israelites would become a ‘Fifth Column’ in a war with enemies in the north, in fact reflects the Egyptian-Mitannian conflict, because the contested upper Euphrates region was settled by the erstwhile relatives of the Hebrew Patriarchs. See Harran, Hurrians, Naharin, Nahor, Thothmes. Moab: A small kingdom on the eastern side of the Dead Sea with which the Hebrew kingdoms of Judea and Israel had variably warring and friendly relations. A stone column (now in the Louvre Museum), inscribed in language and script akin to that of Judea, relates events in the 9th century B.C. concerning Mesha (king of Moab) and Omri (king of Israel) that parallel what is told in 2 Kings 3. According to the Bible, the forefather of the Moabites was a son of Lot, Abraham’s nephew; and Ruth, a Moabite, was a foremother of king David. Mount Nebo, where Moses died, was in Moab. A stela (stone column) inscribed by Mesha, a Moabite king, is the only discovered ancient document outside of the Bible in which the divine name YHWH is spelled out."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"Moon Mount Moriah 145 Moon: The Moon has fascinated Mankind from time immemorial, has been observed since astronomy began, is essential to many calendars, and was associated in antiquity with the god Su.en (Akkadian Sin). Yet the origin of Earth’s sole satellite is still an enigma baffling sci- entists. The prevailing theory, that it is a part of Earth thrust off as a result of a giant collision with some celestial wanderer, fails to explain its large size relative to Earth, why the Moon’s mineral makeup differs from Earth’s, and what happened to the impactor. ZS has resolved the enigma by treating the Mesopotamian Epic of Creation as a sophis- ticated cosmogony. The Moon, he wrote, was Kingu, the main sat- ellite of Tiamat; and when the ‘celestial battle’ with Nibiru/Marduk occurred, it was carried to a new celestial location with the half of Tiamat that became the Earth. See Astronomy, Celestial Battle, Earth, Epic of Creation. Moses (H Mosbe ): According to the Bible, a baby boy who was born in Egypt to parents of the tribe of Levi at a time when the reigning Pharaoh had ordered all newborn Israelite boys killed, ended up as the adopted son of Pharaoh’s daughter (who gave him his name). Discovering his true origins, he slew one of his people’s oppressors and fled to the wilderness of Sinai; there, God imposed on him the task of leading the Israelites out of bondage in Egypt to their ancestors’ land. During the forty years’ saga of wanderings, Moses received the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai, and built a Tabernacle where Yahweh spoke to him from atop the Ark of the Covenant; yet, in the end, he was denied entry to the Promised Land and died on Mount Nebo, on the eastern side of the Jordan River. ZS has shown that if the dating of the Exodus strictly follows the biblical data, it took place in 1433 B.C. and “Pharaoh’s Daughter” who adopted Moses was the childless princess Hatshepsut, who belonged to a dynasty in which royal names included the suffix ‘MSS’ (e.g., RA-MSES).

Mount Sinai: The mountain on which, according to the Book of Exodus, Yahweh landed in His Kavod in full view of the Israelite people, and where Moses received the tablets with the Ten Commandments. Monks at the St. Katherine monastery in the mountainous southern Sinai call a nearby peak ‘Mount Moses’ and identify it as the bibli- cal Mount Sinai. Such an identification requires what scholars call a ‘Southern Route’ for the Exodus. For reasons given in The Stairway to Heaven ZS supports the ‘Central Route’ approach, according to which the real Mount Sinai is located farther north in the flatter part of the peninsula. ZS has also suggested that the Mount was linked to the Anunnaki’s post-Diluvial spaceport facilities, and was the “Mount Mashu” where Gilgamesh went to be taken aloft. See Exodus, Kavod, St. Katherine Monastery. Mount Zaphon: Hebrew for ‘Mount of the North’ — the biblical name of a mountain peak in northern Canaan; the name could also mean in Hebrew ‘Mount of the Hidden Secret’. Because the Canaanite epic tale of Keret describes the mount as “the mount of Baal” and his “sacred cir- cuit . . . the circuit of broad span,” ZS identified it as the ‘Landing Place’ of Baalbek in Lebanon. See Crest of Zaphon. Mu: A Sumerian term whose interpretation as “Name” ignores its meaning when used in texts describing the aircraft of the Anunnaki (such as the “Divine Black Bird” of Ninurta, the “Heavenly Boat” of Inanna, or the “Supreme Traveler” of Marduk). ZS interpreted it as a technical term for the ‘Sky Chamber’ itself, and reinforced such understanding with the pictographs that evolved into the cuneiform sign for Mu. See Aerial Chariots, Shem.

His epithet-name and role could well be the origin of the biblical term Nabih — commonly translated ‘prophet’, but literally meaning a ‘Spokesman’ (for God). While his father was in exile, he proselytized for him and converted the people in the Dead Sea area cities to Marduk’s side; Mount Nebo on the Jordan’s eastern shore, from which Moses saw the Promised Land before he died, is one of the landmarks in that area named after Nabu. After Marduk triumphed, Nabu came annually to Babylon from his ‘cult center’ Borsippa for the New Year ceremonies, during which Marduk’s being buried alive inside the Great Pyramid and triumphant emergence was re-enacted in ‘Passion Plays’. Because Nabu was the god’s son by his Earthling-wife Sarpanit, the events in the 21st century B.C. evolved to messianic expectations (especially in Egypt) with elements of a Trinity. See Akiti, En.sag, Messianic Clock, Marduk, Prophets, Sarpanit, War of the Kings.

He was the father of the famed Nebuchadnezzar. NAHARIN (= ‘The Two Rivers’): The Egyptian name for the Upper Euphrates area. Called Aram Nahara’yim (= ‘The West of the Two Rivers’) in the Bible, it was a region whose heartland centered on the Khabur River where Harran was located; it was where the relatives of the Israelites continued to live after Abraham had left Harran for Canaan. At the start of Egypt’s New Kingdom circa 1560 B.C. the area was part of the Hurrian kingdom of Mitanni, and famed Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty persisted in attempts to capture Naharin. ZS, in The End of Days, has linked the biblical story of the Exodus to those Egyptian-Mitannian wars, and suggested that the Egyptian reason for oppressing the Israelites (“lest they join our enemies”) was fear of an Israelite ‘Fifth Column’ allied with the Mitannians back in Harran.

Nam: A Sumerian term that meant unavoidable ‘Destiny’ — as Man’s des- tiny to die, no matter what; it was distinguished from Nam. tar (which should be correctly translated ‘Fate’) — a destiny that could be ‘bent’ (as when a man’s free choice to be righteous could earn him a better or lon- ger life, though without escaping his final mortality). Nam. tar: In Sumerian texts, Namtar (in addition to its meaning, of a Destiny that can be ‘bent’) was the personal name of the Chief Counselor of Ereshkigal, mistress of the Lower World. Nannar (= ‘The Bright One’; sometimes shortened to Nanna): The Sumerian ‘Moon god’ — a son, born on Earth, of Enlil and Ninlil. His better-known Akkadian name Sin stemmed from his nickname Su.en (= ‘Multiplying Lord’), for he was the father of the twins Utu/Shamash and Inanna/Ishtar. His ‘cult centers’ were Ur in Sumer and Harran in Upper Mesopotamia. His numerical rank was 30.

Nebuchadnezzar II: A major Babylonian king (reigned 605-562 B.C.) who aggrandized Babylon and its empire on behalf of his gods Marduk and Nabu (after whom he was named). He began his career as a general under his father the king Nabupolassar, defeating Assyrian and then Egyptian armies. As king, he expanded Babylonian (and thus the gods’ Marduk and Nabu) dominance to the former Sumer & Akkad, to the erstwhile Canaan and Phoenicia, and to the Sinai all the way to Egypt’s border. ZS has suggested that the driving motivation was control of the olden space-related sites in anticipation of the imminent return of Nibiru and an expected repeat visit by Anu. Nebuchadnezzar’s extensive inscriptions corroborate the Bible’s record of his besieging and capturing Jerusalem (598/597 B.C.), when he exiled Judea’s leaders and priests (including the Prophet Ezekiel). He returned in 587 B.C. to destroy the Temple (586 B.C.). See Baalbek, Carchemish, Jerusalem. Nefilim (H): The term appears in the Bible’s description of conditions on Earth before the Deluge (Genesis 6): “The Nefilim were upon the Earth in those days [before the Deluge] and thereafter too, when the sons of the Elohim cohabited with the daughters of the Adam and they bore children unto them.” The beginning of the verse is commonly rendered “there were giants upon the Earth.” It was ZS’s questioning of his teacher why the word Nefilim (literally, “Those who had come down”) is wrongly translated ‘giants’ that started his interest in the subject. The reason for the mistranslation is the biblical explanation (Numbers 13:33) that the Nefilim were Anakim — a word taken to mean ‘giants’. But that, ZS has suggested in his books, was the Hebrew for Anunnaki.

Treated as an opportunity for an affirmation of the Faith, the ceremonies included the public reading of Enuma elish (the Epic of Creation) on the fourth night of the twelve- day festival. Part of the steps taken in Babylon to assert the supremacy of Marduk was the revision of the Epic of Creation by calling Nibiru ‘Planet Marduk’ and claiming for Marduk the creative feats of other gods. See Calendars, Marduk, Nabu, Nibiru. Nibiru: The name, in the Epic of Creation, of the planet that invaded the Solar System, and assisted by its seven satellites or moons engaged in a ‘Celestial Battle’ with a planet called Tiamat. After defeating and cleav- ing Tiarnat, the invader joined the Solar System with an orbit that sur- passed those of all the other planets. While the Epic is generally treated as a myth or an allegorical tale, ZS has treated it as a rendering of a sophisticated cosmogony dealing with the makeup of the Solar System and life on Earth. Nibiru (renamed ‘Marduk’ by the Babylonians), is listed as a planet in Mesopotamian astronomical texts and sky maps, and scholars have argued whether it was just another name for either Jupiter or Mars; but by treating the Epic of Creation as factual astronomy, ZS has concluded that it is the Sumerian name of one more planet in our Solar System that, when nearing the Sun, passed between Jupiter and Mars. The planet’s name Nibiru meant “Planet of Crossing” — crossing and recrossing the place of the Celestial Battle; and Sumerian depictions signified it by the sign of the Cross. The reappearance of this sign in depictions in the 7th and 6th centuries B.C. served as one of the clues in ZS’s book The End of Days for deciphering biblical prophecies about the Day of the Lord’; many of the Assyrian and Babylonian astronomical texts from that time actually served as guidelines for observing the planet Nibiru as it returned to Earth’s vicinity. See Ashurbanipal, Astronomy, Celestial Battle, Cross, Day of the Lord, Epic of Creation, Sar, Tiamat.

The actual orbital times, especially since the Deluge (as explained in The End of Days ) digressed from the mathematically perfect Sar.

Nile Civilization: A phrase encompassing ancient Egypt and Nubia, termed to match the two other civilizations named after their rivers — the Tigris-Euphrates (Mesopotamia) in the Near East (the First Region of Sumerian texts), and that of the Indus River (the Sumerian Third Region). Nile River: Africa’s longest river, originating in mountainous Uganda and Ethiopia and reaching the Mediterranean Sea in Egypt, more than 4,000 miles in the north. In its southern part it gushes through several gorges and falls (with six main cataracts’), but becomes wider and navigable from the city of Aswan (ancient Siena) northward. With hardly any rainfall, Egypt, its agriculture, and indeed civilization, have depended on the Nile and its life-giving waters. Ancient texts ascribed to the god Ptah (= Enki, per ZS) the regulating of the rise and fall of the river’s waters by installing sluices near the island of Elephantine in Upper Egypt— where the modern Aswan Dam now performs a similar function. See Aswan. Nimrod: The Book of Genesis names the otherwise unidentified ‘Nimrod’ as the “mighty hunter by the grace of Yahweh” who— after the Deluge— began Kingship in “Babel and Erech and Akkad, all in the Land of Shine ar; out of that land there emanated Ashur, where Nineveh was built.” Nimrod was thus credited in the Bible with starting Man’s king- ship in Mesopotamia — the lands of Sumer, Akkad, Babylon, and Assyria.

In 1988 archaeologists unearthed there, in tombs of three Assyrian queens, a treasure of jewelry and other golden artifacts, known as ‘The Nimrud Treasure’.

Until archaeological excavations in the 19th century began to bring back to light Assyria and its major cities, Nineveh was known only from the Bible, from such tales as the failed siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrian king Sennacherib, or of Jonah and the Whale. When the city was excavated and vast written records were found in its temples and palaces, it emerged as the dazzling royal capital of the three great- est Assyrian kings — Sennacherib, Esarhaddon, and Ashurbanipal {see relevant entries).

Per ZS, it was the birthplace of Abram/Abraham who called himself an Ibri (= ‘A Nippurian’). See Abraham, Enlil, Landing Corridor, Mission Control Center. Nippur Calendar: A Sumerian 12 month luni-solar calendar, that periodi- cally adjusted the lunar months to the solar year by adding a 13th month in a leap year. It was adopted by the Babylonians and then by others in the ancient Near East, and still serves as the Jewish calendar to this day, retaining the Akkadian/Babylonian month names and order. Since the Jewish calendar counts the Common Era (A.D.) year 2009 as year 5769, ZS has concluded that the Calendar of Nippur had to begin in 3760 B.C. — soon after the Sumerian civilization began. In Mesopotamia, the New Year began precisely on the day of the Spring Equinox, which was declared the first day of the First Month; called Nisannu in Akkadian (Hebrew Nisan ), it was named in Sumerian the Ezen (= ‘Festival’) month honoring Anu. During the Exodus the Israelites were ordered to begin the New Year on the day of the Autumnal Equinox; but the Bible clearly recognized the month, Tishrei (Akkadian Teshritu) as “the seventh month.” Nissanu (= ‘Signaling’): The Akkadian name of the first month of the Nippur Calendar (H Nissan ) that began on the first day of spring.

Nuclear Weapons: A series of Sumerian texts known as Lamentation Texts ascribe the demise of the Sumerian civilization, at the end of the 3rd millennium B.C., to an “Evil Wind” that brought death to people, animals and flora without destroying any buildings. Cities, houses, stalls, sheepfolds were desolated and emptied; their occupants met a terrible death, “an unseen death,” from which there was no escape. The Evil Wind that withered all plants and made the waters “bitter” came blowing from the west. It was, the texts repeatedly stated, “a calamity unknown to man, one that had never been seen before.” While the prevalent scholarly guess has been that the texts describe a climate change, ZS has placed the occurrence in the context (and dating) of the mounting conflict between the Anunnaki clans, and linked the unique calamity to the detailed description in the Erra Epic of the decision to use seven hidden “Awesome Weapons” to thwart Marduk’s ambitions. In 2024 B.C., ZS has concluded, nuclear weapons were used to wipe out the Spaceport in the Sinai and the nearby five “sin- ning cities” south of the Dead Sea — the ‘upheavaling’ of Sodom and Gomorrah as described in the Bible. The unintended consequence was the blowing of the nuclear cloud eastward to bring death to Sumer. See Erra Epic, Nabu, Nergal, Ninurta.

Beginning in Sumer (as early as circa 4000 B.C., when Anu and Antu visited Earth) the ziggurats of Mesopotamia — step-pyramids that usually rose in seven stages — served to observe the night skies for planetary phenomena or the zodiacal background at the moment of sunrise. Structures with circular observation chambers (such as the temple built in Lagash by Gudea, the Caracol in Chichen Itza) served to observe the zodiacal constellations. Other structures, involving stones erected in circles (Gilgal Rephaim on the Golan, Stonehenge in England) were oriented to observe solstices. Twin-towered temples co-oriented with an observation post (such as in the Aztec capital) were built to observe equinoxes; and windows in stone walls (as twice in Machu Picchu) served to observe both equinoxes and solstices. And though not regular observatories, temples from Karnak to Jerusalem to Cuzco were oriented to either the solstices or equinoxes.

Most significantly, Olmec monuments bearing glyph-writing and dates according to the Long Count leave no doubt that it was they who introduced this calendar in Mesoamerica. Most scholars suggest 1400/1500 B.C. as the Olmec starting date, but leave unanswered the Why and How of their coming millennia before Columbus. ZS believes that the start coincided with this calendar’s Day One in 3113 B.C. and that the African Olmecs accompanied Thoth (alias Quetzalcoatl = ‘The Winged Serpent’) when Ra chased him out of Egypt, circa 3100 B.C. The Olmecs faded out of the Mesoamerican scene with the rise of the Mayas, circa 500 B.C. See Calendars, Mesoamerica, Quetzalcoatl, Thoth. Olympian gods: The group of twelve gods, headed by Zeus, who according to Greek lore were based on Mount Olympus. Omphalos: A short conical stone column rounded at the top that served as an Oracle Stone at certain sacred places, such as Delphi in Greece. Derived from the Latin ‘umbilicus’ (= ‘navel’), Omphalos stones were revered as a means for communicating with the celestial gods — a tra- dition, per ZS, that harked back to Nippur — the Sumerian ‘Navel of the Earth’, where the Dur.an.ki, a ‘Bond’— a virtual ‘umbilical cord’— connected Earth with Heaven. A Canaanite text described a “stone that whispers divine words, that the god Baal used for communicating, at Baalbek. Alexander the Great, seeking confirmation for his demigod sta- tus, consulted such oracle stones not only in Delphi, but also at the Siwa oasis in Egypt and one in Nubia.

The god was also known as ‘Rimac’, meaning ‘The Thunderer’, and ZS has wondered whether it was a corruption of ‘Raman’ (= ‘The Thunderer’) — one of the epithets, in the ancient Near East, of the god Ishkur/Adad who— in the southern Andes— was called ‘Viracocha’ (‘Creator of AH’). See Adad, Tiahuanacu, Viracocha. Palmyra (= The Place of Palms’): An ancient city in what is now eastern Syria, known for monumental ruins from the Graeco-Roman period. The Bible called it Tadmor and attributed its development from a desert oasis to a major caravan center on the way from Damascus to Mesopotamia to king Solomon. Paradise: What has come to mean the place of optimal and ultimate physi- cal, spiritual and religious attainment, is simply called in the Bible (H) Gan Eden (‘The Garden/Orchard of Eden’) — which ZS has explained as stemming from E.din (‘Abode of the Righteous Ones’), the pre-Diluvial name given by the Anunnaki to their abode in southern Mesopotamia.

Passover (H Pesah): The weeklong Jewish holiday, prescribed in the Bible, commemorating the Israelite Exodus from Egypt. Traditionally, Jewish pilgrims gathered in Jerusalem for the holiday, and according to the New Testament Jesus has been so coming to Jerusalem since childhood. See Exodus, Jesus, Last Supper. Patriarchs: The Bible lists ten pre-Diluvial patriarchs of Mankind, beginning with Adam through Noah (but neither counting the first two sons of Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, nor the descendants of Cain); they are recognized by scholars to parallel the same number of pre-Diluvial Anunnaki ‘gods’ and demigods named in the Sumerian King Lists. ZS has shown that the 432,000 years assigned to those ten Sumerian pre-Diluvial patriarchs matches the lengths given in the Bible if, under the sexagesimal numbers system, the latter are multiplied by 60. Though the Bible provides in Genesis 10 the post-Diluvial genea- logical lines descended from the three sons of Noah, only Abraham (a descendant of Shem), his son Isaac and his grandson Jacob are the “biblical Patriarchs” through whom God has made a Covenant with the Hebrew people. People of the Sea: Unidentified invaders who beleaguered the Asian and African coasts of the Mediterranean Sea around the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C. They are depicted in sea-battle scenes on a temple built by Ramses III (at Medinet Habu, Egypt) as warriors wearing plumed helmets; ZS, in The Earth Chronicles Expeditions, drew attention to the enigma of similar depictions at the Mayan site of Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, Mexico.

Such finds, as often as not suppressed by establishment academics, have been fully vindicated by now. Pepi I: A 6th dynasty Egyptian king (circa 2300 B.C.), known for the inscriptions in his pyramid that described his Journey to the Afterlife. Taken literally, they indicated (per ZS) a route to the Sinai penin- sula.

Persia, Persians: In terms of history as known in the West, ‘Persia’ (today’s Iran) began with the takeover of the plateau east of the Tigris-Euphrates plain by the Achaemenids, after they helped the Medes (biblical Maddai ) defeat Assyria at the end of the 7th century B.C., and captured Babylon at the start of the 6th century B.C. Under the leadership of Cyrus II and his son Cambyses II they made the Elamite city Susa (biblical Shushan ) the capital of a fast-expanding empire that embraced even Egypt, and in less than a century crossed from Asia to Europe to challenge Athenian Greece. The counterattack, led by Alexander the Great, put an end to Persian rule and empire in 330 B.C.

ZS has drawn attention to the little known writings of a Spaniard named Montesinos, who recorded local lore about an Ancient Empire’ in the Andean highlands long before the Incas, attributing to its kings such enigmatic places as Machu Picchu. Peru, where the Spaniards found incredible quantities of gold and golden artifacts, also lies at the core of the Piri Reis map and Nazca Lines puz- zles. See Cuzco, Gold, Golden Enclosure, Incas, Machu Picchu, Piri Reis, Nazca, Titicaca, Viracocha. Pharaoh: The term, used as epithet-title for ‘king’ in ancient Egypt, is first found in the Bible, where the Hebrew word Phar’oh is believed to have been a rendering of the Egyptian PER-OH (= ‘Big House’) = royal palace, and by extension its resident, the king. Manetho, and king lists found by archaeologists, divided the reigning Pharaohs by dynasties, beginning circa 3100 B.C. and ending in Roman times. Philistines: Identified as Plishtim (H = ‘Invaders’) in the Bible, they were a sea people of Greek origins who settled in the southern Mediterranean coast of Canaan, occupying approximately the area that is nowadays known as the Gaza Strip.

Phobos 2 was then commanded from the Soviet Mission Control to change orbit, fly in tandem with the moonlet Phobos, and probe the moonlet with laser beams; where- upon the spacecraft went into a spin and vanished. The last photograph sent by it showed a missile fired at it from the moonlet. ZS managed at the time to obtain the telltale photographs and published them along with other details of the occurrence, which he dubbed ‘The Phobos Incident’, in his book Genesis Revisited, with an update in The End of Days.

Planets: Extensive astronomical texts, as well as depictions on cylinder seals and varied sculptures, leave no doubt that the Sumerians, and the Babylonians after them, were fully aware of our solar system’s makeup. They repeatedly asserted that our Solar System has twelve members — the Sun (which was depicted in the center), the Moon (for reasons given in the Epic of Creation), and ten planets, including Nibiru. They named them, listed them in the correct order and numbered them — from First for Pluto, through Neptune, Uranus, Saturn and Jupiter, to Mars as the 6th, Earth the 7th, Venus 8th, and 9th for Mercury — the order, accord- ing to ZS, in which someone (like the Anunnaki) coming into our Solar System from far out (i.e. from Nibiru— the tenth planet and the twelfth member) would count. Generally called Mul (= ‘Celestial body’) in Sumerian ( Kakkabu in Akkadian), the planets observable from Earth were additionally identified as Lu.mash (= ‘The familiar Wanderers’). The Sumerian familiarity with our Solar System was such that ZS could predict what NASA would find on Neptune; it even extended to the odd orbit of Pluto, that is sometimes beyond Neptune and sometimes closer than Neptune: It was depicted as a Two Faced planetary god!

References to a “Plant of Life” (and “Waters of Life”) are also found in the Pyramid Texts. See Pepi I, Pyramid Texts. Pluto: The outermost known planet before the Space Age, whose odd inclined orbit beyond Neptune sometimes takes it in, closer than Neptune. ZS has identified it with Ga.ga, a moon of Saturn that, according to the Epic of Creation, was sent off as a messenger to the other planets, ending up near Neptune. In Sumerian astronomical texts it was called Ushmu (= ‘He of Two Faces’), and was depicted with two heads — looking this way and the other way. Ushmu, moreover, was the ‘vizier’ of Ea — the Sumerian god of waters.

While scholars used to credit the Greek astronomer Hipparchus (who lived in Asia Minor in the 2nd century B.C.) with being the first to recognize Precession, the fact is that the phenomenon lies at the core of the zodiacal system, with which the Sumerians were already familiar in the 4th millennium B.C.

Priesthood reached a peak in Babylon and Assyria in the first millennium B.C., when hundreds of priests living and serving in Sacred Precincts formed guildlike groups with particu- lar specialties, ranging from cleaning and cooking to sky-watching and omen-solving. The same phenomenon of priests and priesthood arose in both the Mesoamerican and South American civilizations.

Of Egypt’s score ‘true’ pyramids the three in Giza stand out as unique in their perfection, size, inner complexity, and exterior limestone casing; while Egyptologists con- sider them a 4th dynasty development from lesser prior pyramids, ZS has suggested that on the contrary, they were an Anunnaki-built model that later Pharaohs tried to emulate (with varied degrees of failure).

RADEDEF: A 4th dynasty Pharaoh whom Egyptologists prefer not to discuss because his existence and his pyramid defy the theory that three successive Pharaohs— KHUFU/Cheops, KHEFRA/Chefren and MENKAURA/Mycerinus built in succession the three Giza pyramids. Khefra (to whom the Second Pyramid is attributed) was not the succes- sor of Khufu — Radedef (sometimes read backwards, Dedefra) was. He was the son of KHUFU/Cheops and reigned as Pharaoh after him; but the pyramid he built (a) is not at Giza but miles away to the north, (b) was primitively built of unhewn stones, and (c) is a pile of rubble.

RAMSES (also Ramesses = ‘Issue of Ra’): The theophoric name of several Pharaohs of the New Kingdom whose royal names (including AH-MSES/ Ahmose, THOTH-MSES/Tutmose) claimed for the king a demigod sta- tus by being the “issue of” this or that god. Most renowned were Ramses II of the 19th dynasty (reigned 1279-1213 B.C.) who some (but not ZS) consider to have been the Pharaoh of the Exodus, and Ramses III of the 20th dynasty (reigned 1182-1151 B.C.) who defended Egypt against the invading People of the Sea.

The Sumerian text dealing with Inanna’s journey to the “Lower World” (the domain of her sister Ereshkigal) describes both how she was put to death and how she was brought back to life by an emissary of Enki. Egyptian tales relate how Horus, having died from a scorpion’s sting, was brought back to life by the god Thoth. Canaanite texts assert that Ba’al, having been killed in battle with other gods, was brought back to life by the goddesses Anat and Shepesh. The Bible credits the prophets Elijah and Elisha with reviving a sick person who died; and the prophet Ezekiel had the vision of dry bones reassem- bling themselves and returning back to life. Revelation: The New Testament’s prophetic book (whose full title is ‘The Apocalypse of St. John the Divine’) that contains a series of revelations of things to come, most rendered in mystic symbolism. One of its most baffling segments is the referral to “The Beast whose number is 666;” many scholars consider it the numerical code for the name ‘Nero Caesar’ in Hebrew, which is among the reasons for dating the book to the time of that Roman ruler (first century A.D.). The most apocalyptic proph- ecy concerns the Final Battle of “Armageddon,” which is a rendering in Greek of Har Megiddo = Mount Megiddo in Israel. See Armageddon, End of Days, Megiddo.

The ‘Garden of Eden’ was thus unmistakably the Sumerian E.din (Akkadian Edinnu ) — Mesopotamia. But what about the other two rivers that joined the oth- ers at one headwaters? The Bible called them by epithets: Gihon (‘The Gusher’) and Pishon (‘The One That Rested ), and scholars’ suggestions have ranged as far as the Nile in Africa and the Indus in India. The answer occurred to ZS when earth-penetrating radar discovered in 1993 that a river, now dried up, had once run through eastern Arabia to the headwaters of the Persian Gulf — joining there the Euphrates and Tigris. That, ZS suggested, was the Pishon, the river that came to rest. He then guessed that a river (called Kuron) that cascades down from the Zagros mountains on the opposite side of the Gulf, could have been the missing Gihon. Rocketships: The Sumerian term Gir, pictographically depicted as a conical object pointed at its head, has been usually translated ‘cutter’. Combined with the term Din (= ‘Just, Righteous’) it was the Sumerian term for ‘gods’. Because of astounding pictographic similarity of Din. Gir to an Egyptian drawing of a multi-stage spaceship in an underground silo, ZS has concluded that in this context Gir stands for the conical upper part of a rocketship. See also Aerial Chariots. Rome, Romans: The city, now the capital of Italy, that gave its name to a country and people that were the mightiest power some two mil- lennia ago. Founded according to legend in the 8th century B.C., it became the capital of a republic (governed by a senate) in the 6th cen- tury B.C. Gradually but persistently replacing the Greeks in the east- ern Mediterranean, the Roman control of the sea lanes was resisted by the Phoenicians, leading to the Punic Wars (264-146 B.C.) of which Hannibal’s march on Rome is best remembered. By the first century B.C. Rome, ruled by an emperor, grew to become an imperial city, deeply involved, through conquest and diplomacy, in the lands and peo- ples of the olden great civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia, the eastern Mediterranean, and Judea.

Rosetta Stone: A stone tablet (now on display in the British Museum) discovered at the village of Rosetta in Egypt by one of Napoleon’s men in 1799.

With small variations the three principal alternatives are (a) the Southern Route, requiring Mount Sinai to be located among the high granite peaks near St. Katherine monastery; (b) a Northern Route, fol- lowing the Mediterranean seashore Way of the Sea; or (c) the Central Route, using one of the time-immemorial passes to enter the central plain, locating Mount Sinai near the caravan stop of Nakhl (Way of the Pilgrims).

The narrower side of the promontory contains remains of rectangular and circular structures under which passages and tunnels run. Whatever had been on that side has been protected by three parallel zig- zagging colossal walls built of huge boulders (weighing between 20 and 300 tons each) cut at numerous angles so as to fit together as a jigsaw puzzle. Except for local lore that all that was built “by the giants,” there is no indication of by whom, when and why all that was put up.

Named after a martyr, Santa Katarina (purportedly buried on an adja- cent mount by angels), the monastery was enlarged and given special status by the emperor Constantine (when he adopted Christianity) because it is located next to a “Mount Mussa” — ‘Mount Moses’ — which the monks claim to be the Mount Sinai of the Exodus. The claim forms the basis for accepting a ‘Southern Route’ as the Route of the Exodus. Reviewing two centuries of debate and research on the subject, ZS concluded that the monks’ tradition is untenable. His on-site evidence for a central Sinai loca- tion for Mount Sinai is given in The Stairway to Heaven and The Earth Chronicles Expeditions. See Exodus, Mount Sinai, Sinai Peninsula.

Sargon ( Sharru-kin = ‘Trustworthy King’) of Akkad: The Semitic founder of the Akkadian dynasty that assumed control over Sumer circa 2360 B.C., forming a unified ‘Sumer & Akkad’. A text known as ‘The Legend of Sargon’ described him as a foundling, not unlike the biblical Moses. A protege of Inanna/Ishtar, he ruled from a new capital {Agade/. Akkad) and carried out military campaigns on her behalf. The atrocities committed by his grandson Naram-Sin led the other gods to wipe Agade off the face of the Earth. See Akkad, Akkadians.

The latter (‘Sargon II’) built a grand new capital, Dur-Sharru-kin, with walls whose length in Assyrian cubits equaled the numerical value of the king’s name.

Seafaring: Legendary, textual, pictorial and even physical evidence indicate that seafaring began much earlier than usually assumed. Enki, texts tell, liked to sail in a Ma.gur (= ‘Boat for turning about’) in the marshlands while his “crewmen sang in unison.” Boats were used by the Anunnaki to transport gold ores for smelting and refining in the E.din. Mankind did not completely perish in the Deluge because Noah/Ziusudra/ Utnapishtim built a submersible boat following Enki’s instructions. According to the Sumerian King List, after the Deluge, the demigod king of Uruk “Mes-kiag-gasher, went into the sea and came out from it to the mountains.” Legends, such as that of Naymlap, recorded the arrival of settlers in boats on the Pacific coast of South America, and of Aztec predecessors arriving in Mexico in boats.

In the Sumerian origin of the Garden of Eden story, Enki’s epithet Buzur meant both “Solver of Secrets” and “Serpent;” the Bible (siding with Enlil?) chose ‘Serpent’. But then the biblical Exodus tale reports that Moses stopped a plague with a Copper Serpent (Enki’s epithet).

Solstice (from Latin, ‘Sun standstill’): The farthest point north or south as the Sun appears to move northward and back southward during a year, where it seems to hesitate, stop, then move back. In antiquity, many tem- ples (both in the Old and the New Worlds) — or even special structures, such as Stonehenge or Gilgal Repha’im — were oriented to either the summer or the winter solstice. The phenomena (occurring June 20/21 and December 21/22) are caused by the Earth’s tilt relative to the plain of its orbit around the Sun. The tilt, now about 23.5°, fluctuates up and down in a millennia-long cycle; archaeoastronomy therefore enables determining the date of such temples by their orientation at the time of construction. See Archaeoastronomy, Gilgal Repha’im, Stonehenge, Temples. Spaceport: The pre-Diluvial one was located at Sippar in the E.din; it was destroyed by the Deluge. The post-Diluvial one was located, per ZS, in the Sinai peninsula and was destroyed with nuclear weapons in 2024 B.C. See Abraham, Erra Epos, Gilgamesh, Landing Corridor, Pharaohs, Ninharsag, Sinai, Sippar, Utu, War of the Kings.

In the Pyramid Texts describing the Pharaoh’s ‘Journey to the Afterlife’, the vehicle was called a ‘Divine Ascender’; in the tomb of an Egyptian governor of the Sinai, one was depicted as a multi-stage rocketship in an underground silo. According to the autobiographical text of Enki, there were fifty astronauts with him in his spaceship when he journeyed to Earth. See Afterlife, Ben-Ben, Rocketships, Spaceport. Sphinx: The Greek-origin name for a huge (more than 240 ft. long, 65 ft. high) sculpture of a crouching lion with a human head, carved out of the natural limestone bedrock, in Giza, Egypt. Whom does the face repre- sent is just one of the riddles of Who, When, By whom, How and Why, questions that, like the desert sands that have often buried it up to its neck, swirl about the Great Sphinx. Because a causeway connects its site to the Second Pyramid, Egyptologists attribute it to Khefra/Chefren, and continue to do so even though inscriptions by Khufu/Cheops (who preceded Khefra) already mention the Sphinx. Indeed, as ZS has submit- ted in The Stairway to Heaven, those inscriptions (such as the Inventory Stela) indicate even earlier dates, and pictorial depictions already show the Sphinx in pre-dynastic times. In a chapter titled “The Gaze of the Sphinx” ZS attached great significance to the fact that the Sphinx is located precisely on the 30th parallel north and gazes east — precisely toward the Spaceport in the Sinai. ZS has concluded that the Sphinx was built by the Anunnaki as part of the Giza/Spaceport complex circa 10500 B.C. Recent research by non-Egyptologists, studying erosion pat- terns and other data, have arrived at a similar date. See Giza, Pharaohs, Pyramids, Spaceport. Sphinxes, Ram-headed: The avenue leading to the great temple of Ra-Amon in Karnak (Upper Egypt) is flanked by facing rows of ram-headed sphinxes. ZS has suggested that it had to do with the expectations of Ra/Marduk to attain supremacy as the Age of the Ram (= Aries) was nearing. Spring Equinox: The day, in the Sumerian and Babylonian calendars, of the start of a new year — the first day of the month Nissan. See Astronomy, Equinoxes."},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"196 Stars Succession Rules Stars: From the very beginning of ancient astronomy in Sumer, the heavens enveloping the Earth were divided into three ‘Ways’, each occupying 60 degrees (i.e. one third) of the celestial arc. The central and most impor- tant band was the ‘Way of Anu; it extended (in the heavens) from the 30th parallel north to the 30th parallel south, with the Celestial equator in the middle, and the lists of stars in it included all those grouped into the twelve zodiacal constellations. The northern band was called the ‘Way of Enlil’; the southern one, the ‘Way of Ea’ (= Enki). Cuneiform star and constellation lists for the Way of Enlil contain virtually all the constellation-stars known today; the list for the Way of Ea, whose south- ernmost part was unobservable from Mesopotamia, is not that complete. Though the Sumerian term Mul ( Kakkabu in Akkadian) applied to all celestial bodies (stars, constellations, planets), the Sumerians did some- times distinguish planets by the term Lu.bad. See Astronomy, Planets, Solar System. Storm God: A term frequently used by translators from Hittite when the name of the leading Hittite deity, Teshub, is in the inscription. See Adad, Teshub. Stonehenge: The famed monument in England known for its megaliths that stand in an oval or ‘horse-shoe’ within megalithic circles. It is believed to have been built in several stages involving ditches, corner markers, ‘horseshoe’ and rectangular arrangements, an avenue, special viewline stones, etc. starting in the mid 3rd millennium B.C. and attain- ing their present shape (more or less) circa 2160 B.C. But who actually had conceived and carried out these constructions, and why were its most important stones brought over from distant places, remains an enigma. What seems to be certain, however, is that in its final shape Stonehenge served as an observatory for determining the zodiacal age by observing sunrise on summer solstice day. ZS, in The End of Days, associated Stonehenge with a global effort to show Mankind that it was still the Age of the Bull, that the Age of the Ram (of Marduk) had not yet arrived. See Astronomy, E.Ninnu, Solstice, Zodiac. Succession Rules: A clue provided in the Bible has enabled ZS to decipher"},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Sud Sumer 197 the Succession Rules that lay at the root of rifts among Anunnaki half- brothers and the struggle for supremacy on Earth between Marduk and Ninurta. The ruler’s successor was the Firstborn son, whether mothered by a wife or a concubine; but if at any time later the ruler had a son by a half-sister (whether a spouse or not), that son was the Legal Heir with the Succession Right. Often, to avoid future conflicts (since rulers, like Anu, had numerous concubines), the king (or Patriarch) preferred to marry a half-sister to begin with. That half-sister, as Abraham explained after he had introduced Sarah as his sister, could be “the daughter of my father but not of my mother.” That was the reason that Enlil, though Enki was the Firstborn, was Anus Legal Heir, and why Enlil’s son Ninurta (by his half-sister Ninmah) was the dynastic successor, rather than Marduk. The preference for a half-sister as wife was also practiced in Egypt — and, interestingly, also among Inca royalty in South America. Sud: A term meaning ‘One who gives succor’ in Sumerian, applied to Ninmah/Ninharsag as an epithet when she arrived on Earth, and as a personal name for the young nurse who became Enlil’s wife. Suhur.mash (= Goat-fish’): The Sumerian name for the zodiacal constel- lation we call Capricorn. Sumer (Akk. Shumeru = ‘Land of the Guardians’): Called Ki.en.gi (‘Land of Earth’s Lords’) in Sumerian, it was the post-Diluvial land where the Anunnaki’s E.din had been before the Deluge. After the layers of mud sufficiently dried, settlers from the mountain ranges to the east began to arrive; the Bible records their arrival in “the Land of Shin’ar ” and the start of cities built with mud bricks — a milestone turning point in human history — in chapter 1 1 of Genesis. Mesopotamian texts assert that Mankind was granted ‘kingship’ — an urban civilization — by a decision of the Anunnaki leadership, taken in their council, dur- ing Anu’s state visit to Earth circa 4000 B.C.; and indeed, all excavations of Sumer’s earliest cities show no date earlier than that (ZS has suggested that the Calendar of Nippur, still used by Jews as their calendar, that began in 3760 B.C., serves as a good starting-time indicator). It is such a deliberate decision by the advanced Anunnaki"},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"198 Susa Syria to grant some of their knowledge to Mankind that can explain the sudden and unprecedented rise of a high civilization in that part of the world, with its myriad ‘firsts’ — the first urban centers, first writing, first wheel, first kiln, first kings and a social organization, first musical notes and poetry, first schools and homework, first doctors, first reli- gion (with a pantheon and priesthood), first mathematical system, first taxes, first law codes, first high rise buildings, first observatories, first calendar, etc. etc. Sumer’s demise, vividly described in Lamentation Texts, came about as a result of an “Evil Wind” — per ZS, a deathly nuclear cloud blowing over the land from the nuclear explosion in the Sinai in 2024 B.C. Sumerian remnants formed the first recorded human Diaspora, traceable to the Far East as well as to enclaves in Europe. Sumer’s legacy lives on in virtually every aspect of modern civilizations, not the least in the continuing Nippur Calendar. See Anunnaki, Edin, Mesopotamia.

Syria: The current political entity that extends from the Euphrates River westward to the Mediterranean Sea was, in antiquity, primarily the land of the Semitic Amorites (= Westerners’, biblical Ammites). It was over the millennia and centuries since the 3rd millennium B.C. the arena of various kingdoms and city-states (e.g., Aram, Ebla, Mari, Mitanni, Palmyra, Ugarit) as well as of major battles between the imperial powers in antiquity.

Taurus Mountains: A mountain range in Asia Minor (today’s Turkey) that runs east-west along a great part of the country’s south, with peaks rising to 10,000-12,000 feet; the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and their tribu- taries originate in those mountains. The Hittites and other Anatolian peoples mined silver and then tin in those mountains; ZS has sug- gested that after the Deluge, the god Teshub/Adad brought over mining experts from Anatolia to obtain gold and tin in the Lake Titicaca region in South America. See Adad, Metallurgy, Teshub, Titicaca. Tell Ghassul (= ‘Mound of the Messenger’): An ancient site east of the Jordan River, near the Dead Sea, where archaeologists of the Vatican’s Pontifical Biblical Institute found wall murals depicting bulbous space- craft with round ‘eye’ openings and extended legs. ZS has associated the site with the biblical tale of the heavenward ascent of the Prophet Elijah “in a whirlwind’. Temple: The Sumerian term that is translated ‘temple’ is the cuneiform sign read ‘E’, which means ‘House/Abode/Residence’ — for, distinct from a mere shrine honoring this or that god or goddess, the temple was deemed to be the actual place of residence of an actual god. Thus, Enlil (and his spouse Ninlil) were deemed to actually reside in the E.kur (= ‘House which is like a mountain’), their ziggurat-temple in Nippur; Marduk actually resided and granted kingships in his magnificent zig- gurat E.temen.an.ki (= ‘The Heaven-Earth Foundation House’), and was served there by a complex retinue of priests; when Gudea com- pleted building the new temple E.Ninnu (= ‘House of Fifty’) in Lagash, Ninurta and his spouse Bau took up residence in it amid ceremonial festivities.

There is no indication that Egyptian temples were intended as physical godly residences— in the innermost Holy of Holies, only effigies of gods were found. The Canaanite texts held that the head of the pan- theon, El (with his spouse Asherah ) lived somewhere in retirement, and that the active Baal (= ‘Lord’) resided in the ‘Secret Place of the North’ (Baalbek per ZS). Aztec, Maya and Inca temples seem to have emulated the Egyptian model, serving mostly as glorified shrines. Temple Mount: Mount Moriah (= ‘Mount of Directing’), the middle mount of Jerusalem’s three, situated between Mount Zophim (= ‘Mount of Observers’) to the north and Mount Zion (= ‘Mount of the Signal’) to the south. It is so called because it was on its platform that the Temple to Tahweh was built. Surrounded by a wall, the elevated platform contains the sacred Even Shatit (= ‘Foundation Stone’) where, tradition and archae- ological studies indicate, the Temple’s Holy of Holies was (now, encom- passed by the Dome of the Rock, it is a Moslem shrine). On the west, the ancient platform is supported by the Western Wall, a relic from Temple times whose foundations reach native bedrock. Remains from the time of Jesus indicate that the public access to the Temple was via a ceremo- nial staircase and gates in the south wall. See David, Jerusalem Temple, Solomon. Temple Orientations: From the very beginning, the celestial orientation of temples was a most important aspect of their construction. Square z ‘gg urats had their corners pointed precisely to the four cardinal points. In rectangular temples, the long axis ran either precisely east-west, or was aligned with one of the solstices; Sir Norman Lockyer, the father of archaeoastronomy, called the former (as Solomon’s Temple in Jerusalem) Equinoctial or Eternal Temples, and the latter (such as those in Egypt or the Americas) Solstitial Temples whose orientation could help date"},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"202 Ten Commandments Teotihuacan them. Gudea received divine help in orienting the E.Ninnu temple in Lagash; Egyptian depictions showed gods indicating where the corner stone of a temple should be laid. Ten Commandments: The term applied to the ten religious and ethi- cal principles of the Covenant made between God and the people of Israel at Mount Sinai, as stated in Exodus 20:2-17 and reiterated in Deuteronomy 5:6-18. The first three state the religious principles of a monotheism centered on following Yahweh; the fourth commands keep- ing the seventh day as the Sabbath; the fifth instructs respect for one’s parents; the other five, beginning with the words “thou shalt not,” direct social and moral behavior. In establishing monotheism and prohibiting graven images, the Commandments were unique in the prevailing poly- theism involving worship of many gods represented by their statues; in its social and ethical instructions, the Commandments differed from the law codes of other nations that (like Hammurabi’s in Babylon) were lists of crimes and their punishments. The Commandments (literally, ‘Sayings’ in Hebrew), were inscribed on two stone tablets that Moses was given on Mount Sinai; they were the only objects kept in the Ark of the Covenant. Tenochtitlan (= ‘City of Tenoch’): The Aztec name for their capital, estab- lished in the midst of a lake by following legendary guidelines. When the Spaniards arrived, they were astounded to find a bustling metropolis, crisscrossed by canals, with twin-towered temples and great palaces. ZS has wondered whether the name might be understood as the ‘City of Enoch ’ — because according to the Bible the outcast Cain built a city “in the Land of Wandering” and called it by the name of his son, Enoch. Mexico City was built by the Spaniards over the destroyed Aztec capi- tal; recent archaeological excavations in Mexico City’s main square have exposed some remains (and many artifacts) from Aztec times. Teotihuacan (= ‘Place of the gods’): A huge ancient site northwest of Mexico City, known primarily for its ‘Pyramid of the Moon’, ‘Pyramid of the Sun’, and a wide 2.5-mile-long ‘Avenue of the Dead’ along which the step-pyramids and many other sacred structures, including a tern-"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Terah Third Region 203 pie to Quetzalcoatl, are situated. Legend has it that the pyramids com- memorate a Time of Darkness, when the Sun failed to rise. The gods gathered at Teotihuacan to discuss what to do. After two gods sacrificed themselves, the Wind God blew at the Sun and it resumed its motion. Archaeological evidence suggests that the site’s first builders were the Olmecs; carbon dating suggests a date of circa 1400 B.C. for the two pyramids. All that has induced ZS to relate the delayed sunrise (that is also mentioned in South American lore) to the ‘Day the Sun stood still’ — did not set for twenty hours — on the other side of the world at the time of Joshua — also circa 1400 B.C. Terah-. The father of Abraham who moved from Ur in Sumer to Harran in northern Mesopotamia with his family, including his sons Abram and Nahor and their wives. Based on literal readings of the Hebrew text, ZS has concluded that the family originated in Nippur, and that Terah comes from the Sumerian Tirhu (= ‘Oracle Speaker’), suggesting that Terah was an Oracle Priest. Teshub: The head of the Hittite pantheon, so-called ‘Storm God’. See Adad, Hittites, Ishkur. Thebes: The name, from the Greek Thebai, of the southern capital of ancient Egypt, on the Nile’s eastern bank, during the Middle and New Kingdoms. It is mentioned in the Bible as Noh Amon, matching its Egyptian name NEUT-AMON (= ‘The pleasant city of [the god] Amon ). The great temples of Karnak and Luxor, a major tourist attrac- tion, were part of ancient Thebes. Third Pyramid: Usually a reference to the smaller of the three pyramids in Giza; attributed by Egyptologists to the Pharaoh Menkara. ZS, who has attributed all three to the Anunnaki, has suggested that this pyramid was in fact the first one— built by the Anunnaki as a scale model, to test the incline and other features that were subsequently incorporated in the larger two. Third Region: The Indus Valley, chosen by the Anunnaki as the third region for giving Mankind civilization; put under the aegis of Inanna."},{"pageNumber":214,"pageContent":"204 Thirtieth Parallel Thoth Thirtieth Parallel: Per ZS, just as the heavens around the Earth were divided into segments at the 30th parallels north and south {see Stars), so was the Earth itself divided by the Anunnaki. The 30th parallel north was the most important one: It ran through the heart of the Giza com- plex, with the Sphinx gazing precisely east along this parallel, toward the Spaceport in the Sinai, which was located on the 30th parallel (north); so was Eridu (Enki’s city, the first Anunnaki settlement in the Edin); and farther east — Harappa of the Indus Valley civilization. All focal points of the Four Regions — the Anuunnaki’s in Giza/Sinai, the three first civilizations — were thus located on this parallel. So were the centers of subsequent civilizations: Persepolis (the Persian capital), then Lhasa (the sacred center of Tibet). Thoth: A major god of ancient Egypt whose attributes included that of Divine Architect (and thus his Egyptian name TEHUTI = ‘Drawer of the Cord’ = the Divine Measurer); the Divine Scribe, who recorded the decisions of the gods or the deeds of men when their fate was weighed; god of secret knowledge, god of mathematics, numbers and the calendar; god of magic who could resurrect the dead. He was usually depicted with the head of an Ibis bird (meaning ‘Wisdom’). According to Manetho, Thoth was descended of Ptah, and reigned for 1,560 years when gods alone ruled over Egypt; but in time, having quarreled with his half- brother the god RA, had to go into exile (according to ZS, Ptah, Ra and Thoth were the gods Enki, Marduk and Ningishzida in Sumer). In Egypt, Hieroglyphic texts known as ‘Tales of the Magicians’ revealed that the ‘Secret Number of Thoth’ was 52; it was expressed in the 52 x 7-day weeks calendar (and in his reign of 52 x 30 = 1,560). That was one of the clues suggesting to ZS that in Mesoamerica Quetzalcoatl was Thoth, for there 52 was the ‘Sacred Number’ of the Haab and Tzolkin calendars, when they meshed back to the same spot, linked to the prom- ised return of Quetzalcoatl. ZS has thus suggested that in 3113 B.C. Thoth, expelled by Ra/Marduk from Egypt, took along a group of African followers to Mesoamerica, where he was called Quetzalcoatl. See Calendars, Mesoamerica, Ningishzida, Olmecs, Quetzalcoatl."},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"Thothmes Tiahuanacu 205 Thothmes (also Thothmose, Tuthmosis) = ‘Issue of Thoth’: The name given to several Pharaohs of the 18th dynasty, the most famous of whom was Thothmes III (1504-1450 B.C.) who greatly extended Egypt’s domains in Africa and Asia, launched campaigns to capture the Landing Place and Naharin, and controlled Canaan up to the Hittite border after a great battle at Megiddo. Thothmes IV is mostly remembered for his encounter, when still a prince, with the Sphinx. As recorded on a stela erected between the paws of the Sphinx, the Sphinx at that time was covered by the desert sands up to its neck. Tired after a hunt, the prince fell asleep there and in a dream the Sphinx spoke to him, asking to be freed of the sand, promising the prince future kingship if he would. The prince did, and in time became king. See Ahmose, Hatshepsut, Mitanni, Moses, Sphinx. Tiahuanacu (also Tiwanaku): A major site near the southern shores of Lake Titicaca (now in Bolivia) where — according to any one of several legends — the Creator God Viracocha had arrived in great antiquity, and from which human settlement of South America began. Surprisingly, explorers and archaeologists had to reach corroborating conclusions. Spanish chroniclers declared the place “the oldest in the world.” The 19th century explorer E. G. Squier called it “the Baalbec of the New World;” and its most famous and dedicated explorer in the 20th century, Arthur Posnansy, calling Tiahuanacu “The Cradle of American Man,” determined it to be more than 10,000 years old. The principal monu- ments at the site corroborate its great age, and per ZS hold clues to the identity ot its builders and their reasons for creating a megalithic city amidst barren mountains some 2.5 miles above sea level. Of the three principal monuments, the most picturesque is the Gate of the Sun, a colossal stand-alone gateway whose large doorway, decorated arch, jambs, lintels, niches and false windows are all cut and shaped from a single huge stone block weighing over one hundred tons. Intricate carvings on the archway depict the god Viracocha as a central figure dominating three rows of winged beings — an arrangement with calendrical meaning. ZS has shown that the depiction of Viracocha, holding a scepter and a lightning, is similar to the way the Hittites of Anatolia depicted their"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"206 Ti.amat Tiglat Pileser III principal deity Teshub/Adad, and the winged beings emulate similar Hittite depictions. This and other facts led ZS to suggest that, when in the aftermath of the Deluge the Anunnaki shifted the gold obtaining operations to South America, the metal savvy Hittites led by Teshub were brought over. That Tiahuanacu was a metallurgical center — for gold as well as for tin — is further attested by the second prominent monument, the Akapana-. an artificial hill that was thought to be the remains of a pyramid; but excava- tions revealed in its interior a series of channels and chambers connected by conduits and equipped with sluices that suggest that it was a facility for metallurgical processing — the obtainment of tin from its Cassiterite ore, per ZS. Conclusive to determining the site’s age is the third promi- nent monument; called the Kalasasaya, it is a rectangular enclosure of about 400 x 450 feet that included a sunken court and was delineated by a series of standing stone pillars. The east-west orientation, and the number of pillars and their positions, suggest an astronomical function relating to both equinoxes and solstices. The angle (or ‘obliquity’) for the solstices conforms to a construction date of either circa 10000 B.C. or 4000 B.C. — the former (per ZS) coinciding with the post-Diluvial activities of the Anunnaki, the latter matching Anu’s state visit to Earth. See Akapana, Anu, Gate of the Sun, Kalasasaya, Megalithic Structures, Metallurgy, Puma Punku, Solstices, Tin. Ti.amat (= ‘Mother of Life’): According to the Epic of Creation — taken as a sophisticated cosmogony by ZS — an early planet in our Solar System, with eleven satellites (moons), with which an invading planet (called Nibiru/Marduk) collided. As a result of that ‘Celestial Battle’, Tiamat broke up into two parts — one smashed to bits and pieces to become the ‘Eleavenly Bracelet’ (the Asteroid belt) and the other, thrust to a different orbit, becoming planet Earth, carrying with it Tiamat’s main satellite to become Earth’s Moon.

Tilmun (= ‘Place/Land of the Missiles’; sometimes rendered Dilmun): A Sumerian name for the Sinai peninsula (or that part of the Peninsula) where the spaceport of the Anunnaki was located. According to the Epic of Gilgamesh, Tilmun, “where the rocketships were raised up,” was one of the destinations in his search for immortality; it was there that he encountered Ziusudra/Utnapishtim, the survivor of the Deluge who was granted (together with his wife) Long Life and sent to dwell in Tilmun, the sacred region of the gods. See Deluge, Gilgamesh, Ziusudra. Time: ZS has suggested that faced with an immense difference in time cycles (starting with the planets’ orbital periods) between their home planet Nibiru and the Earth — which he named Divine Time and Earthly Time — the Anunnaki created the median of Zodiacal Time. Due to the phenomenon of Precession, Earth’s retardation accumulates to one Zodiacal House of 30° every 2,160 years — a number which gave the Anunnaki the 10:6 ratio with Nibiru’s 3,600 (Earth)-years orbit (3,600:2,160 = 10:6). It also explains, per ZS, the mathematical basis for the sexagesimal system. Tin: A metal that, unlike gold, silver or copper, is extremely rare in pure form in nature. It is mostly found oxidized in the form of an ore called Cassiterite, from which the tin is obtained by smelting in furnaces at very high temperatures in a multi-stage process that requires recovery after recombining with carbon. Its usefulness lies in the fact that when added to copper in a small proportion (just over 10%), the resulting alloy — Bronze — gains extraordinary strength. In spite of all the complex"},{"pageNumber":218,"pageContent":"208 Titicaca Toltecs metallurgical processes that lead from Cassiterite to Bronze, the ‘Bronze Age’ was launched in Sumer (where tin was called An.na = ‘Heavenly stone’) as early as 3600 B.C., spreading within several centuries through- out the Near East. The Sumerian achievement was even more remark- able in view of the fact that while copper was available from nearby Near Eastern sources (such as Cyprus, Crete), the tin-bearing ores were far away — either in the Indian subcontinent and the Far East, in the British Isles (Cornwall), or in South America (the environs of Lake Titicaca). ZS, in The Lost Realms, quotes a Sumerian text in which Inanna speaks of her domain in the Indus Valley as a source of tin, and provides evi- dence that the Anunnaki obtained tin at Tiahuanacu in Bolivia — where the world’s leading source of tin still is. ZS has even wondered whether the center’s name may come from the Akkadian word for tin — Anaku — making Ti-anaku literally mean ‘Tin City’! See Bronze, Puma Punku, Tiahuanacu, Titicaca. Titicaca: The large freshwater lake in the Andes mountains — at the high- est elevation on Earth — that is now divided between Peru and Bolivia. The important ruins of Tiahuanacu and Puma Punku, now not far from the lake but originally on its southern shore, served, per ZS, as the met- allurgical source of gold and tin of the Anunnaki after the Deluge. The Lake’s name, ZS has pointed out, could be understood as ‘Rock of Tin’ in the native Aymara tongue — matching a legend that the god Viracocha obtained for Mankind tin from an island in the midst of the lake.

Yahweh got concerned and suggested to unnamed colleagues to foil Mankind’s plot by confusing its languages: The Bible draws the city’s name, Babel (= Babylon) from the Hebrew verb BLL (= ‘Mix up, confuse’). While the notion that at one time Mankind had only one language is found in varied Sumerian texts as well as in the writings of Berossus, ZS connected the tale to Marduk’s first attempt to build a Launch Tower in Babylon, his city in Mesopotamia, and dated the event to 3460 B.C. — a chaotic period when Ra/Marduk was away from Egypt. ZS based his interpretation on a “Tower of Babylon” tale in a clay tablet (K. 3657) found in the library of Ashurbanipal, and on his suggestion that, in certain contexts, Shem means a rocketship. See Babylon, Confusion of Languages, Marduk, Shem. Tree of Knowledge: According to Genesis 2:9, two special trees were growing in the Garden of Eden, the “Tree of the Life” and the “Tree of Knowing good and evil;” it was of the latter’s fruit that God forbade The Adam to eat. A female companion, Eve, was then fashioned; and it was she who was persuaded by the Serpent to eat and share with Adam the fruit of the Tree of Knowing — a transgression for which the couple was expelled from the Garden of Eden.

Tree of Life: In the biblical tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life “grew in the midst of the Garden.” It was after the couple ate the fruit of the Tree of Knowing that Yahweh expressed (to unnamed colleagues) his concern lest they would also eat of the Tree of Life “and live forever;” so Adam and Eve were driven out of the Garden of Eden, and Cherubim were placed “to guard the way to the Tree of Life.” Egyptian texts refer to the “Tree in the Land of Living;” Mesopotamian texts refer to a “Plant of Life.” Depictions in both civilizations show the tree as a Date Palm; in Mesopotamian art (and especially so Assyrian) the Tree of Life is often shown flanked by divine beings.

(Correctly, the title of ZS’s first book, The 12th Planet, should have been ‘The Planet which is the 12th member of the Solar System’.)

Uranus: According to the Epic of Creation (when treated as a cosmogony), the twinlike planets we call Uranus and Neptune were formed at the same phase of the Solar System. Its Sumerian name was En.ti.mash (= ‘Lord of Bright-Greenish Life’); its Akkadian name was Kakkab Shanamma (— Planet which is the double’), and ZS has used these epithets to pre- dict the main Voyager 2 1986/1989 discoveries at Uranus and Neptune. Uranus is unique in that it lies on its side, its north pole (rather than its equator) facing the Sun— the result, according to NASA, of the planet getting a “big whack” at some time. One of its moons, Miranda, also shows signs of having been ‘whacked’, and ZS, in The End of Days , has suggested that it was all due to a collision with one of Nibiru’s moons during a passage that might have coincided with the Deluge on Earth.

ZS has also suggested that the target of the invasion was the Spaceport, which Abraham successfully defended. Wars of the gods: The lore of all the ancient civilizations of the Old World contains references, descriptions and even depictions of fighting between gods. While the Enuma elish (‘Epic of Creation’) described the celestial collision between Tiamat and the invading Nibiru as a battle in heaven between two gods, Tiamat and Marduk, other Sumerian texts dealt with actual battles between gods on Earth, starting with one on one (Ninurta against Zu) and expanding to group fights (Enlilites versus Enki’ites).

Egyptian tales kept the struggles to one on one: Seth against Osiris, Horus against Seth (except that Horus is stated to have been the first god to organize a human army to fight for him).

Waters of Life: While in Mesopotamian texts the way for mortals to attain immortality was to partake of the Food (or Fruit) of Life, Egyptian Pyramid Texts depicted the Pharaoh seeking eternal life by drinking the Water of Life (in which a Tree of Life sometimes grew). It is unclear whether (or what) the Anunnaki who had come to Earth required to be supplied from Nibiru to sustain their longevity.

The other, Derekh Hayam (= Way of the Sea’) ran along the Mediterranean coast, connecting Asia Minor and the Levant with Egypt via the Sinai Peninsula; it was still in use in Roman times as their Via Maris. The Bible mentions in the Patriarchal tales and in connection with the Exodus three Ways for crossing the Sinai Peninsula: The Way of the Sea; a somewhat more southern Way of the Land of the Philistines; and the Way of the Pilgrims that cut diagonally from northwest to southeast, leading to the eastern rather than the west- ern side of the Jordan River.

Zeus overwhelmed his opponents with a “Thunder Stone” that fired thunderbolts; Indra shot “flashing thun- derbolts” that shook the Earth when they hit the ground; Vritra fought with sharpened missiles. ’ Hindu depictions of gods invariably showed them holding intricate weapons in each hand.

Writing: The recording of objects, a transaction or an event by the use of agreed-upon signs representing a spoken language— as distinct from using mere pictures (such as petroglyphs or cave paintings)— began in Sumer, where scribes using a stylus with a wedge-shaped (= ‘Cuneiform’) tip impressed signs into wet clay to create a record that others could read and understand. Scholars believe that such writing began in the 4th millennium B.C. as record keeping in temples. Cuneiform writ- ing, in which signs represented spoken syllables (a consonant with a vowel) that could be combined to be read as the spoken word, was adapted to Akkadian, Hittite and other languages and remained in use throughout the ancient Near East until replaced by alphabetic writ- ing at the end of the 2nd millennium B.C.; it differed from Egyptian hieroglyphic writing, which remained essentially a pictographic system until some of its pictographs came to represent consonants.

It was revealed by God himself to Moses in the Sinai: When Moses was given the mission to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, he asked for God’s name, and at first got the answer “I will be whoever I shall be” ( incorrectly translated “I am who I am”); but when Moses persisted, he was told to say to them: “YHWH, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob hath sent me unto you; this is My eternal name, this is My remembrance from generation to generation.” The theological complexities of the subject have been compounded by the use of the name in biblical versions of Mesopotamian tales (e.g., of the Deluge) in which Enlil or Enki are the protagonists: Yahweh is named in the Bible (Genesis 6) where in Mesopotamian texts Enlil sought Mankind’s demise, and then is named where in Mesopotamian texts Enki saves Noah.

The houselike seventh stage was no accident either: The ziggurats were intended as actual residences of the gods, each one in his (or her) ‘cult center’ — as the ziggurats’ names, starting with ‘E’ (= ‘House, Abode’ in Sumerian) indicated: Enlil’s E.kur, Ninurta’s E.Ninnu, Marduk’s E. sag.il, Nannar’s E.hul.hul, etc. See Gudea, Temples. Ziusudra (= ‘[His] Life-days Prolonged’): The ‘Noah’ of the Deluge tale in its original Sumerian version. He was a “man of Shuruppak,” the city assigned to Ninmah/Ninharsag, son of the demigod Ubar-Tutu. According to that version, Enki warned him of the coming Deluge, gave him instructions how to build a Ma.gur.gur (= ‘A boat that can turn and tumble’), and provided him with a navigator to steer the boat to Ararat. Enlil, relenting that he had planned Mankind’s demise, then granted to Ziusudra and his wife long life in a land called Til.mun, where (millennia later) Gilgamesh managed to reach him.

Zodiac (From the Greek, ‘Animal Circle’): The term applied to the twelve star groups (constellations), pictorially representing the ‘animals’ (bull, lion, ram, fishes, etc.) after which some of them have been called. The significance of dividing the skies around Earth into this central band of twelve stems from a phenomenon called Precession — the retardation in Earth’s orbit around the Sun that accumulates to 1° (out of 360°) in 72 years, so that the transition from one zodiacal “House” of 30° requires 2,160 years— the mathematical length of a Zodiacal Age. Though scholars continue to credit 3rd century B.C. Greek astronomers in Asia Minor with the discovery of the zodiacal phenomenon, the undeniable fact is that it was already known in Sumerian times: In The 12th Planet, ZS has provided the complete list of the 12 zodiacal constellations, in the Way of Anu, by their Sumerian names and depictions — names, depictions and order used to this day, after some 6,000 years! Calling k Celestial Time , ZS asserted that the zodiac was a device invented by the Anunnaki as a workable ratio between their planet’s orbit (‘Divine Time’, averaging 3,600 Earth years) and Earthly Time (Earth’s fast 1-year orbit), resulting in a ratio of 10:6 to the 2,160 years of a Zodiacal Age. He has pointed out that the very fact that texts about the Deluge date the event to “the Age of Lion” (that began circa 10860 B.C.) indicate how old the zodiacal device has been. Zodiacal constellations are men- tioned in the Bible, where they are called Mazalot (from the Akkadian Manzalu = ‘Stations’). The ZS scenario also explains familiarity with the 12-house zodiac in the Americas, which attributing the zodiac to 3rd century B.C. Greeks fails to explain. Sumerian lists of the zodia- cal constellations began with Taurus; Egyptian depictions (among them the one in Denderah) began with Aries. See Ages, ^Mays of Heaven, and names of individual constellations. Zodiacal Ages: The observation, begun in Sumer, of sunrise on the day of the Spring Equinox, to determine (when the starry sky is still observable) which zodiacal constellation is seen in the background. As long as the rising shows, as it was when the Sumerian calendar"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"Zoser Zu 231 began, the Constellation of the Bull, one would say it was the ‘Age of Taurus’; when the background began to shift to the Constellation of the Ram, we would say that the ‘Age of Aries’ had begun, and so on. While mathematically a Zodiacal Age lasts 2,160 years (72 x 30 = 2,160), observationally the Ages’ differ in length because the con- stellations occupy different segments of the sky. In fact, that differ- ence was a paramount issue in the conflicts with Marduk in the 21st century B.C., when the expected changeover from Enid's Age of the Bull to Marduk’s Age of the Ram was delayed. Mathematically, this Zodiacal Clock rendered the Ages thus (all dates B.C.): Lion (Leo), 10860 to 8640; Crab (Cancer), 8640 to 6480; Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160; Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0; then fishes (Pisces), 0 to A.D. 2160. According to Berossus, the zodiacal Ages were turning points in the affairs of gods and men — an assertion that has a basis in history, as well as in the fact that Sumerian math- ematical tablets were found which listed multiples of 12,960 (= 2,160 x 6) as fractions of the ultimate number 12,960,000 (2,160 x 6,000).

The site, called Sakkara or Saqqarah, on the west side of the Nile south of Giza, still staggers visitors with its magnificent stone-walled compound; the pyramid itself — a seven-step structure emulating Sumerian ziggurats — built of crude rocks, wooden logs and mud-mortar — is crumbling. See Giza, Pyramids, Sakkara. Zu (from An.zu = ‘Knower of the heavens’): The evil hero of an epic tale, who misused Enid's trusting to steal the ‘Tablets of Destinies’ that were essential to the operations of the Anunnaki; Ninurta succeeded, with great difficulty, to defeat Zu and retrieve the tablets.
