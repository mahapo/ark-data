Will it be when Nibiru in its elongated orbit returns to our vicinity, and what will happen then? Will there be darkness at noon and the Earth shall shatter? Will it be Peace on Earth, or Armageddon? A Millennium of trouble and tribulations, or a messianic Second Coming? Will it happen in 2012, or later, or not at all? These are profound questions that combine people’s deep - est hopes and anxieties with religious beliefs and expecta - tions, questions compounded by current events: wars in la nds where the entwined affairs of gods and men began; the threats of nuclear holocausts; the alarming ferocity of natural disasters. They are questions that I dared not answer all these years—but now are questions the answers to which cannot—must not—be delayed. Questions about the Return, it ought to be realized, are not n ew; they have inexorably been linked in the past—as they are today—to the expectation and the apprehension of the Day of the Lord, the End of Days, Armageddon. Four millen - nia ago, the Near East witnessed a god and his son promising H eaven on Earth. More than three millennia ago, king and people in Egypt yearned for a messianic time. Two millennia ago, the people of Judea wondered whether the Messiah had appeared, and we are still seized with the mysteries of those events. Are prophecies coming true?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We shall deal with the puzzling answers that were given, solve ancient enigmas, decipher the origin and meaning of symbols—the Cross, the Fishes, the Chalice. We shall describe the role of space-related sites in historic events, and show why Past, Present and Future converge in Jerusalem, the place of the “Bond Heaven-Earth.” And we shall ponder why it is that our current twenty-first century a.d. is so similar to the twenty-first century b.c.e. Is history repeating itself—is it destined to repeat itself? Is it all guided by a Messianic Clock? Is the time at hand? More than two millennia ago, Daniel of Old Testament f ame repeatedly asked the angels: When ? When will be the End of Days, the End of Time? More than three centuries ago the famed Sir Isaac Newton, who elucidated the secrets of celestial motions, composed treatises on the Old Testa- ment’s Book of Daniel and the New Testament’s Book of Revelation; his recently found handwritten calculations con - cerning the End of Days will be analyzed, along with more re cent predictions of The End. Both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament asserted t hat the secrets of the Future are embedded in the Past, that the destiny of Earth is connected to the Heavens, that the af - fairs and fate of Mankind are linked to those of God and g ods. In dealing with what is yet to happen, we cross over from history to prophecy; one cannot be understood without the other, and we shall report them both. With that as our guide, let us look at what is to come through the lens of what had been. The answers will be certain to surprise.

Religious fanaticism manifests itself in wars, rebellions, a nd the slaughter of “infidels.” Armies amassed by Kings of the West are warring with armies of the Kings of the East. A Clash of Civilizations shakes the foundations of traditional ways of life. Carnage engulfs cities and towns; the high and the mighty seek safety behind protective walls. Natural ca - lamities and ever-intensifying catastrophies leave people w ondering: Has Mankind sinned, is it witnessing Divine Wrath, is it due for another annihilating Deluge? Is this the Apocalypse? Can there be—will there be—Salvation? Are Messianic times afoot? The time—the twenty-first century a.d. — or was it the twenty-first century b.c.e. ? The correct answer is Yes and Yes, both in our own time a s well as in those ancient times. It is the condition of the present time, as well as at a time more than four millennia ago; and the amazing similarity is due to events in the middle time in between—the period associated with the messianic fervor at the time of Jesus. Those three cataclysmic periods for Mankind and its pl anet—two in the recorded past (circa 2100 b.c.e. and when b.c.e. changed to a. d. ), one in the nearing future—are inter - connected; one has led to the other, one can be understood on ly by understanding the other. The Present stems from the Past, the Past is the Future. Essential to all three is Messi - anic Expectation ; a nd linking all three is Prophecy ."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"2 THE END OF DAYS How the present time of troubles and tribulations will end —what the Future portends—requires entering the realm of Prophecy. Ours will not be a mélange of newfound pre - dictions whose main magnet is fear of doom and End, but a r eliance upon unique ancient records that documented the Past, predicted the Future, and recorded previous Messianic expectations—prophesying the future in antiquity and, one believes, the Future that is to come. In all three apocalyptic instances—the two that had oc - curred, the one that is about to happen—the physical and spi ritual relationship between Heaven and Earth was and re - mains pivotal for the events. The physical aspects were ex - pressed by the existence on Earth of actual sites that linked E arth with the heavens—sites that were deemed crucial, that were focuses of the events; the spiritual aspects have been expressed in what we call Religion. In all three instances, a changed relationship between Man and God was central, ex - cept that when, circa 2100 b.c.e . , Mankind faced the first of these three epochal upheavals, the relationship was between men and gods , in the plural. Whether that relationship has re - ally changed, the reader will soon discover. The story of the gods, the An unnaki (“Those who from heaven to Earth came”), as the Sumerians called them, be - gins with their coming to Earth from Nibi ru in need of gold. The story of their planet was told in antiquity in the Epic of Creation , a long text on seven tablets; it is usually considered to be an allegorical myth, the product of primitive minds that spoke of planets as living gods combating each other. But as I have shown in my book The Twelfth Planet , the ancient text is in fact a sophisticated cosmogony that tells how a stray planet, passing by our solar system, collided with a planet called Tiamat; the collision resulted in the creation of Earth and its Moon, of the Asteroid Belt and comets, and in the capture of the invader itself in a great elliptical orbit that takes about 3,600 Earth-years to complete (Fig. 1) . It was, Sumerian texts tell, 120 such orbits—432,000 E arth-years—prior to the Deluge (the “Great flood”) that the Anunnaki came to Earth. How and why they came, their first"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"3 The Messianic Clock Figure 1 cities in the E.DIN (the biblical Eden), their fashioning of the Adam and the reasons for it, and the events of the cata - strophic Deluge—have all been told in T he Earth Chronicles series of my books, and will not be repeated here. But before we time-travel to the momentous twenty-first century b.c.e. , some pre-Diluvial and post-Diluvial landmark events need to be recalled. The biblical tale of the Deluge, starting in chapter 6 of G enesis, ascribes its conflicting aspects to a sole deity, Yah - weh, who at first is determined to wipe Mankind off the face o f the Earth, and then goes out of his way to save it through Noah and the Ark. The earlier Sumerian sources of the tale ascribe the disaffection with Mankind to the god Enlil , and the countereffort to save Mankind to the god Enki . What the Bible glossed over for the sake of Monotheism was not just the disagreement between Enlil and Enki, but a rivalry and a conflict between two clans of Anunnaki that dominated the course of subsequent events on Earth. That conflict between the two and their offspring, and the E arth regions allocated to them after the Deluge, need to be kept in mind to understand all that happened thereafter. The two were half-brothers, sons of Nibiru’s ruler An u ; their conflict on Earth had its roots on their home planet, Ni - biru. Enki—then called E.A ( “He whose home is water”)— was Anu’s firstborn son, but not by the official spouse, Antu . When Enlil was born to Anu by Antu—a half-sister of Anu—Enlil became the Legal Heir to Nibiru’s throne though"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"4 THE END OF DAYS he was not the firstborn son. The unavoidable resentment on t he part of Enki and his maternal family was exacerbated by the fact that Anu’s accession to the throne was problematic to begin with: having lost out in a succession struggle to a rival named Alalu, he later usurped the throne in a coup d’état, forcing Alalu to flee Nibiru for his life. That not only back - tracked Ea’s resentments to the days of his forebears, but also brou ght about other challenges to the leadership of Enlil, as told in the epic Tale of Anzu . (For the tangled relationships of Nibiru’s royal families and the ancestries of Anu and Antu, Enlil and Ea, see The Lost Book of Enki .) The key to unlocking the mystery of the gods’ succession ( and marriage) rules was my realization that these rules also applied to the people chosen by them to serve as their proxies to Mankind. It was the biblical tale of the Patriarch Abraham explaining ( Genesis 20:12) that he did not lie when he had pre - sented his wife Sarah as his sister: “Indeed, she is my sister, the d aughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife.” Not only was marrying a half-sister from a different mother permitted, but a son by her—in this case Isaac—became the Legal Heir and dynastic successor, rather than the Firstborn Ishmael, the son of the handmaiden Hagar. (How such succession rules caused the bitter feud between Ra’s divine descendants in Egypt, the half-brothers Osiris and Seth who married the half-sisters Isis and Nephtys, is explained in The Wars of Gods and Men . ) Though those succession rules appear complex, they were ba sed on what those who write about royal dynasties call “bloodlines”—what we now should recognize as sophisticated DNA genealogies that also distinguished between general DNA inherited from the parents as well as the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that is inherited by females only from the mother. The complex yet basic rule was this: Dynastic lines continue through the male line; the Firstborn son is next in succession; a half-sister could be taken as wife if she had a different mother ; and if a son by such a half-sister is later born, that son—though not Firstborn—becomes the Legal Heir and the dynastic successor. The rivalry between the two half-brothers Ea/Enki and En -"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"5 The Messianic Clock lil in matters of the throne was complicated by personal ri - valry in matters of the heart. They both coveted their ha lf-sister Ninmah , whose mother was yet another concubine of Anu. She was Ea’s true love, but he was not permitted to marry her. Enlil then took over, and had a son by her— Nin- urta . Though born without wedlock, the succesion rules made Ninurta Enlil’s uncontested heir, being both his Firstborn son and one born by a royal half-sister. Ea, as related in T he Earth Chronicles books, was the leader of the first group of fifty Anunnaki to come to Earth to obtain the gold needed to protect Nibiru’s dwindling atmosphere. When the initial plans failed, his half-brother Enlil was sent to Earth with more Anunnaki for an expanded Mission Earth. If that was not enough to create a hostile atmosphere, Ninmah too arrived on Earth to serve as chief medical officer . . . A long text known as the At rahasis Epic begins the story of gods and men on Earth with a visit by Anu to Earth to settle once and for all (he hoped) the rivalry between his two sons that was ruining the vital mission; he even offered to stay on Earth and let one of the half-brothers assume the regency on Nibiru. With that in mind, the ancient text tells us, lots were drawn to determine who would stay on Earth and who would sit on Nibiru’s throne: The gods clasped hands together, had cast lots and had divided: Anu went up [back] to heaven, [For Enlil] the Earth was made subject; The seas, enclosed as with a loop, to Enki the prince were given. The result of drawing lots, then, was that Anu returned to N ibiru as its king. Ea, given dominion over the seas and wa- ters (in later times, “Poseidon” to the Greeks and “Neptune” to t he Romans), was granted the epithet EN.KI (“Lord of Earth”) to soothe his feelings; but it was EN.LIL (“Lord of the Command”) who was put in overall charge: “To him the Earth was made subject.” Resentful or not, Ea/Enki could"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"6 THE END OF DAYS not defy the rules of succession or the results of the drawing o f lots; and so the resentment, the anger at justice denied, and a consuming determination to avenge injustices to his father and forefathers and thus to himself led Enki’s son Marduk to take up the fight. Several texts describe how the Anunnaki set up their set - tlements in the E.DIN (the post-Diluvial Sumer), each with a sp ecific function, and all laid out in accordance with a mas - ter plan. The crucial space connection—the ability to con - stantly stay in communication with the home planet and with th e shuttlecraft and spacecraft—was maintained from Enlil’s command post in Nippur , the heart of which was a dimly lit chamber called the DUR.AN.KI, “The Bond Heaven-Earth.” Another vital facility was a spaceport, located at Sippar (“Bird City”). Nippur lay at the center of concentric circles at which the other “cities of the gods” were located; all together they shaped out, for an arriving spacecraft, a landing corri - dor whose focal point was the Near East’s most visible topo - graphic feature—the twin peaks of Mount Ararat (F ig. 2) . And then the Deluge “swept over the earth,” obliterated all t he cities of the gods with their Mission Control Center and Spaceport, and buried the Edin under millions of tons of mud and silt. Everything had to be done all over again—but much could no longer be the same. First and foremost, it was necessary to create a new spaceport facility, with a new Mis - sion Control Center and new Beacon-sites for a Landing Cor ridor. The new landing path was anchored again on the prominent twin peaks of Ararat; the other components were all new: the actual spaceport in the Sinai Peninsula, on the 30th parallel north; artificial twin peaks as beacon sites, the Giza pyramids; and a new Mission Control Center at a place called Jerusalem (Fig. 3) . It was a layout that played a crucial role in post-Diluvial events. The Deluge was a watershed (both literally and figuratively) i n the affairs of both gods and men, and in the relationship between the two: the Earthlings, who were fashioned to serve and work for the gods were henceforth treated as junior part - ners on a devastated planet."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"7 The Messianic Clock Figure 2 The new relationship between men and gods was formu - lated, sanctified, and codified when Mankind was granted i ts first high civilization, in Mesopotamia, circa 3800 b.c.e. The momentous event followed a state visit to Earth by Anu , not just as Nibiru’s ruler but also as the head of the pantheon, on Earth, of the ancient gods. Another (and probably the main) reason for his visit was the establishment and affirma - tion of peace among the gods themselves—a live-and-let-live a rrangement dividing the lands of the Old World among the two principal Anunnaki clans, that of Enlil and that of Enki— for the new post-Diluvial circumstances and the new location of the space facilities required a new territorial division among the gods."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"8 THE END OF DAYS Figure 3 It was a division that was reflected in the biblical Table of Nations ( Genesis , chapter 10), in which the spread of Man - kind, emanating from the three sons of Noah, was recorded b y nationality and geography: Asia to the nations/lands of Shem, Europe to the descendants of Japhet, Africa to the na- tion/lands of Ham. The historical records show that the par - allel division among the gods allotted the first two to the En lilites, the third one to Enki and his sons. The connecting"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"9 The Messianic Clock Sinai peninsula, where the vital post-Diluvial spaceport was l ocated, was set aside as a neutral Sacred Region. While the Bible simply listed the lands and nations ac - cording to their Noahite division, the earlier Sumerian texts re corded the fact that the division was a deliberate act, the result of deliberations by the leadership of the Anunnaki. A text known as the Epic of Etana tells us that The great Anunnaki who decree the fates sat exchanging their counsels regarding the Earth. They created the four regions, set up the settlements. In the First Region, the lands between the two rivers Euphra - tes and Tigris (Mesopotamia), Man’s first known high civili - zation, that of Sumer, was established. Where the prediluvial ci ties of the gods had been, Cities of Man arose, each with its sacred precinct where a deity resided in his or her ziggu- rat—Enlil in Nippur, Ninmah in Shuruppak, Ninurta in Lagash, Nannar/Sin in Ur, Inanna/Ishtar in Uruk, Utu/ Shamash in Sippar, and so on. In each such urban center an EN.SI, a “Righteous Shepherd”—initially a chosen demi- god—was selected to govern the people in behalf of the gods; his main assignment was to promulgate codes of jus - tice and morality. In the sacred precinct, a priesthood over - seen by a high priest served the god and his spouse, s upervised the holiday celebrations, and handled the rites of offerings, sacrifices, and prayers to the gods. Art and sculp - ture, music and dance, poetry and hymns, and above all writ - ing and recordkeeping flourished in the temples and extended to t he royal palace. From time to time one of those cities was selected to serve a s the land’s capital; there the ruler was king, LU.GAL (“Great man”). Initially and for a long time thereafter this person, the most powerful man in the land, served as both king and high priest. He was carefully chosen, for his role and authority, and all the physical symbols of Kingship, were deemed to have come to Earth directly from Heaven, from Anu on Nibiru. A Sumerian text dealing with the subject"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"10 THE END OF DAYS stated that before the symbols of Kingship (tiara/crown and sc epter) and of Righteousness (the shepherd’s staff ) were granted to an earthly king, they “lay deposited before Anu in heaven.” Indeed, the Sumerian word for Kingship was Anu- ship. This aspect of “Kingship” as the essence of civilization, j ust behavior and a moral code for Mankind, was explicitly expressed in the statement, in the Sumerian King List , that after the Deluge “ Kingship was brought down from Heaven .” It is a profound statement that must be borne in mind as we progress in this book to the messianic expectations—in the words of the New Testament, for the Return of the “King - ship of Heaven” to Earth. Circa 3100 b.c.e. a s imilar yet not identical civilization was established in the Second Region in Africa, that of the river Nile (Nubia and Egypt). Its history was not as harmo - nious as that among the Enlilites, for rivalry and contention con tinued among Enki’s six sons, to whom not cities but whole land domains were allocated. Paramount was an ongo - ing conflict between Enki’s firstborn Mar duk ( Ra in Egypt) and Ningishzidda ( Thoth in Egypt), a conflict that led to the exile of Thoth and a band of African followers to the New World (where he became known as Quetzalcóatl , the Winged Serpent). Marduk/Ra himself was punished and exiled when, opposing the marriage of his young brother Dumuzi to En- lil’s granddaughter Inanna/Ishtar, he caused his brother’s death. It was as compensation to Inanna/Ishtar that she was granted dominion over the Third Region of civilization, that of the Indus Valley, circa 2900 b.c.e. It was for good reason that the three civilizations—as was the spaceport in the sa - cred region—were all centered on the 30th parallel north (F ig. 4) . According to Sumerian texts, the Anunnaki established K ingship—civilization and its institutions, as most clearly exemplified in Mesopotamia—as a new order in their rela - tionships with Mankind, with kings/priests serving both as a l ink and a separator between gods and men. But as one looks back on that seemingly “golden age” in the affairs of gods and men, it becomes evident that the affairs of the gods con -"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"11 The Messianic Clock Figure 4 stantly dominated and determined the affairs of Men and the fate of Mankind. Overshadowing all was the determination of Marduk/Ra to undo the injustice done to his father Ea/ Enki, when under the succession rules of the Anunnaki not Enki but Enlil was declared the Legal Heir of their father Anu, the ruler on their home planet Nibiru. In accord with the sexagesimal (“base sixty”) mathematical s ystem that the gods granted the Sumerians, the twelve great gods of the Sumerian pantheon were given numerical ranks in which Anu held the supreme Rank of Sixty; the Rank of Fifty was granted to Enlil; that of Enki was forty, and so farther down, alternating between male and female deities (Fig. 5) ."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"12 THE END OF DAYS Under the succession rules, Enlil’s son Ninurta was in line for t he rank of fifty on Earth, while Marduk held a nominal rank of ten; and initially, these two successors-in-waiting were not yet part of the twelve “Olympians.” And so the long, bitter, and relentness struggle by Marduk t hat began with the Enlil–Enki feud focused later on Mar- duk’s contention with Enlil’s son Ninurta for the succession to the Rank of Fifty, and then extended to Enlil’s grand - daughter Inanna/Ishtar, whose marriage to Dumuzi, Enki’s y oungest son, was so opposed by Marduk that it ended with Dumuzi’s death. In time Marduk/Ra faced conflicts even Figure 5"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"13 The Messianic Clock with other brothers and half-brothers of his, in addition to the c onflict with Thoth that we have already mentioned—princi- pally with Enki’s son Nergal , who married a granddaughter of Enlil named Ereshkigal. In the course of these struggles, the conflicts at times f lared up to full-fledged wars between the two divine clans; some of those wars are called “The Pyramid Wars” in my book The Wars of Gods and Men . In one notable instance the fighting led to the burying alive of Marduk inside the Great Pyramid; in another, it led to its capture by Ninurta. Marduk was also exiled more than once—both as punishment and as a self-imposed absence. His persistent efforts to attain the status to which he believed he was entitled included the event recorded in the Bible as the Tower of Babel incident; but in the end, after numerous frustrations, success came only when Earth and Heaven were aligned with the Messianic Clock . Indeed, the first cataclysmic set of events, in the twenty- f irst century b.c.e. , and the Messianic expectations that ac- companied it, is principally the story of Marduk; it also brou ght to center stage his son Nabu —a deity, the son of a god, but whose mother was an Earthling. Throughout the history of Sumer that spanned almost two t housand years, its royal capital shifted—from the first one, Kish (Ninurta’s first city), to Uruk (the city that Anu granted to Inanna/Ishtar) to Ur (Sin’s seat and center of worship); then to others and then back to the initial ones; and finally, for the third time, back to Ur. But at all times Enlil’s city Nippur, his “cult center,” as scholars are wont to call it, re - mained the religious center of Sumer and the Sumerian peo - ple; it was there that the annual cycle of worshipping the g ods was determined. The twelve “Olympians” of the Sumerian pantheon, each wi th his or her celestial counterpart among the twelve mem - bers of the Solar System (Sun, Moon, and ten planets, includ - ing Nibiru), were also honored with one month each in the a nnual cycle of a twelve-month year. The Sumerian term for “month,” EZEN, actually meant holiday, festival; and each such month was devoted to celebrating the worship-festival of"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"14 THE END OF DAYS one of the twelve supreme gods. It was the need to determine t he exact time when each such month began and ended (and not in order to enable peasants to know when to sow or har - vest, as schoolbooks explain) that led to the introduction of M ankind’s first calendar in 3760 b.c.e. It is known as the Calendar of Nippur because it was the task of its priests to determine the calendar’s intricate timetable and to announce, for the whole land, the time of the religious festivals. That calendar is still in use to this day as the Jewish religious cal - endar, which, in a. d. 2007, numbers the year as 5767. In pre-Diluvial times Nippur served as Mission Control Cen ter, Enlil’s command post where he set up the DUR.AN. KI, the “Bond Heaven-Earth” for the communications with the home planet Nibiru and with the spacecraft connecting them. (After the Deluge, these functions were relocated to a place later known as Jerusalem.) Its central position, equidis - tant from the other functional centers in the E.DIN (see Fig. 2), w as also deemed to be equidistant from the “four corners of the Earth” and gave it the nickname “ Navel of the Earth.” A hymn to Enlil referred to Nippur and its functions thus: Enlil, When you marked off divine settlements on Earth, Nippur you set up as your very own city . . . You founded the Dur-An-Ki In the center of the four corners of the Earth. (The term “the Four Corners of the Earth” is also found in t he Bible; and when Jerusalem replaced Nippur as Mission Control Center after the Deluge, it too was nicknamed the Navel of the Earth.) In Sumerian the term for the four regions of the Earth w as UB, but it also is found as AN.UB—the heavenly, the celestial four “corners”—in this case an astronomical term connected with the calendar. It is taken to refer to the four points in the Earth-Sun annual cycle that we nowadays call the Summer Solstice, the Winter Solstice, and the two cross - ings of the equator—once as the Spring Equinox and then as th e Autumnal Equinox. In the Calendar of Nippur, the year"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"15 The Messianic Clock began on the day of the Spring Equinox and it has so re - mained in the ensuing calendars of the ancient Near East. T hat determined the time of the most important festival of the year—the New Year festival, an event that lasted ten days, during which detailed and canonized rituals had to be followed. Determining calendrical time by Heliacal Rising entailed t he observation of the skies at dawn, when the sun just be - gins to rise on the eastern horizon but the skies are still dark enou gh to show the stars in the background. The day of the equinox having been determined by the fact that on it day - light and nighttime were precisely equal, the position of the s un at heliacal rising was then marked by the erection of a stone pillar to guide future observations—a procedure that was followed, for example, later on at Stonehenge in Britain; and, as at Stonehenge, long-term observations revealed that the group of stars (“constellation”) in the background has not remained the same (Fig. 6) ; there, the alignment stone called the “Heel Stone” that points to sunrise on solstice day Figure 6"},{"pageNumber":23,"pageContent":"16 THE END OF DAYS nowadays, pointed originally to sunrise circa 2000 b.c.e . The phenomenon, called Precession of the Equinoxes or j ust Precession, results from the fact that as the Earth com - pletes one annual orbit around the Sun, it does not return to t he same exact celestial spot. There is a slight, very slight retardation; it amounts to one degree (out of 360 in the circle) in 72 years. It was Enki who first grouped the stars observ - able from Earth into “constellations,” and divided the heav - ens in which the Earth circled the sun into twelve parts—what ha s since been called the Zodiacal Circle of constellations (Fig. 7) . Since each twelfth part of the circle occupied 30 degrees of the celestial arc, the retardation or Precessional shift from one Zodiacal House to another lasted (mathemat - ically) 2, l60 years (72 × 30), and a complete zodiacal cycle lasted 25,920 years (2,l60 × l2). The approximate dates of the Zodiacal Ages —following the equal twelve-part divi - sion and not actual astronomical observations—have been a dded here for the reader’s guidance. Figure 7"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"17 The Messianic Clock That this was the achievement from a time preceding Ma nkind’s civilizations is attested to by the fact that a zodia - cal calendar was applied to Enki’s first stays on Earth (when t he first two zodiacal houses were named in his honor); that this was not the achievement of a Greek astronomer (Hip - parchus) in the third century b.c.e . (as most textbooks still suggest), is attested by the fact that the twelve zodiacal houses were known to the Sumerians millennia earlier by names (Fig. 8) and depictions (Fig. 9) that we use to this day. Figure 8 In When Time Began the calendrical timetables of gods and men were discussed at length. Having come from Nibiru, whose orbital period, the SAR, meant 3,600 (Earth-) years, that unit was naturally the first calendrical yardstick of the Anunnaki even on the fast-orbiting Earth. Indeed, the texts dealing with their early days on Earth, such as the Sumerian King Lists , designated the periods of this or that leader’s time on Earth in terms of Sars. I termed this Divine Time . The calendar granted to Mankind, one based on the orbital as - pects of the Earth (and its Moon), was named Ea rthly Time .

As Marduk discovered, that Celestial Time was the “clock” b y which his destiny was to be determined. But which was Mankind’s Messianic Clock , determining its fate and destiny— Earthly Time , such as the count of fifty- year Jubilees, a count in centuries, or the Millennium? Was it Divine Time , geared to Nibiru’s orbit? Or was it—is it— Celestial Time that follows the slow rotation of the zodiacal clock? The quandary, as we shall see, baffled mankind in antiq - uity; it still lies at the core of the current Return issue. The ques tion that is posed has been asked before—by Babylonian and Assyrian stargazing priests, by biblical Prophets, in the Book of Daniel, in the Revelation of St. John the Divine, by the likes of Sir Isaac Newton, by all of us today. The answer will be astounding. Let us embark on the p ainstaking quest."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"2 “AND IT CAME TO PASS” It is highly significant that in its record of Sumer and the early Sumerian civilization, the Bible chose to highlight the space connection incident —the one known as the tale of the “ Tower of Babel ”: And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shin’ar and they settled there. And they said to one another: “Come, let us make bricks and burn them by fire.” And the brick served them as stone, and the bitumen served them as mortar. And they said: “Come, let us build us a city and a to wer whose head shall reach the heavens. ” Genesis 11: 2–4 This is how the Bible recorded the most audacious attempt— b y Marduk!—to assert his supremacy by establishing his own city in the heart of Enlilite domains and, moreover, to build there his own space facility with its own launch tower . The place is named in the Bible Babel, “Babylon” in English. This biblical tale is remarkable in many ways. It records, f irst of all, the settlement of the Tigris-Euphrates plain after the Deluge, after the soil had dried up enough to permit re - settlement. It correctly names the new land Shin ’ar , the He - brew name for Sumer. It provides the important clue from w here—from the mountainous region to the east—the set - tlers had come. It recognizes that it was there that Man’s first"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"20 THE END OF DAYS urban civilization began—the building of cities. It correctly n otes (and explains) that in that land, where the soil consisted of layers of dried mud and there is no native rock, the people used mud bricks for building and by hardening the bricks in kilns could use them instead of stone. It also refers to the use of bitumen as mortar in construction—an astounding bit of information, since bitumen, a natural petroleum product, seeped up from the ground in southern Mesopotamia but was totally absent in the Land of Israel. The authors of this chapter in Genesis were thus well in - formed regarding the origins and key innovations of the Su - merian civilization; they also recognized the significance of t he “Tower of Babel” incident. As in the tales of the creation of Adam and of the Deluge, they melded the various Sume - rian deities into the plural Elohim o r into an all-encompass- ing and supreme Yahweh , but they left in the tale the fact that it took a group of deities to say, “let us come down” and put an end to this rogue effort ( Genesis 11:7). Sumerian and later Babylonian records attest to the verac - ity of the biblical tale and contain many more details, linking t he incident to the overall strained relationships between the gods that caused the outbreak of two “Pyramid Wars” after the Deluge. The “Peace on Earth” arrangements, circa 8650 b.c.e. , left the erstwhile Edin in Enlilite hands. That con - formed to the decisions of Anu, Enlil, and even Enki—but w as never acquiesced to by Marduk/Ra. And so it was that when Cities of Men began to be allocated in the former Edin to the gods, Marduk raised the issue, “What about me?” Although Sumer was the heartland of the Enlilite territo - ries and its cities were Enlilite “cult centers,” there was one e xception: in the south of Sumer, at the edge of the marsh - lands, there was Er idu ; it was rebuilt after the Deluge at the exact same site where Ea/Enki’s first settlement on Earth had been. It was Anu’s insistence, when the Earth was di - vided among the rival Anunnaki clans, that Enki forever re - tain Eridu as his own. Circa 3460 b. c.e. Marduk decided that he could extend his father’s privilege to also having his own foothold in the Enlilite heartland. The available texts do not provide the reason why Marduk"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"21 “And It Came to Pass” chose that specific site on the banks of the Euphrates river for h is new headquarters, but its location provides a clue: it was situated between the rebuilt Nippur (the pre-Diluvial Mission Control Center) and the rebuilt Sippar (the pre-Diluvial space - port of the Anunnaki), so what Marduk had in mind could have b een a facility that served both functions. A later map of Baby - lon, drawn on a clay tablet (F ig. 10) represents it as a “Navel of the Earth”—akin to Nippur’s original function-title. The name Marduk gave the place, Bab-Ili in Akkadian, meant “Gateway of the gods”—a place from which the gods could ascend and descend, where the appropriate main facility was to be a “tower whose head shall reach the heavens”—a launch tower ! As in the biblical tale, so it is told in parallel (and earlier) M esopotamian versions that this attempt to establish a rogue Figure 10"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"22 THE END OF DAYS space facility came to naught. Though fragmented, the Mes - opotamian texts (first translated by George Smith in l876) m ake it clear that Marduk’s act infuriated Enlil, who “in his anger a command poured out” for a nighttime attack to de - stroy the tower. Egyptian records report that a chaotic period that lasted 350 y ears preceded the start of Pharaonic kingship in Egypt, circa 3l10 b.c.e. It is this time frame that leads us to date the Tower of Babel incident to circa 3460 b.c.e., for the end of that cha- otic period marked the return of Marduk/Ra to Egypt, the ex - pulsion of Thoth, and the start of the worship of Ra. Frustrated this time, Marduk never gave up his attempts to do minate the official space facilities that served as the “Bond Heaven-Earth,” the link between Nibiru and Earth—or to set up his own facility. Since, in the end, Marduk did attain his aims in Babylon, the interesting question is: Why did he fail in 3460 b.c.e. ? The equally interesting answer is: It was a matter of timing. A well-known text recorded a conversation between Mar - duk and his father, Enki, in which a disheartened Marduk a sked his father what he had failed to learn. What he failed to do was to take into account the fact that the time then—the Celestial Time—was the Age of the Bull, the Age of Enlil. Among the thousands of inscribed tablets unearthed in the a ncient Near East, quite a number provided information re - garding the month associated with a particular deity. In a co mplex calendar begun in Nippur in 3760 b.c.e., the first month, Nissanu , was the EZEN (festival time) for Anu and Enlil (in a leap year with a thirteenth lunar month, the honor was split between the two). The list of “honorees” changed as time went by, as did the composition of the membership of the supreme Pantheon of Twelve. The month associations also changed locally, not only in various lands but sometimes to recognize the city god. We know, for example, that the planet we call Venus was initially associated with Ninmah and later on with Inanna/Ishtar. Though such changes make difficult the identifications of w ho was linked celestially to what, some zodiacal associa -"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"23 “And It Came to Pass” tions can be clearly inferred from texts or drawings. Enki ( called at first E.A, “He whose home is water”) was clearly associated with the Water Bearer “Aquarius” (Fig. 11) , and initially if not permanently also with the Fishes, “Pisces.” The constellation that was named The Twins, “Gemini,” without doubt was so named in honor of the only known di - vine twins born on Earth—Nannar/Sin’s children Utu/ S hamash and Inanna/Ishtar. The feminine constellation of “Virgo” (the “Maiden” rather than the inaccurate “Virgin”) that, like the planet Venus, was probably named at first in honor of Ninmah, was renamed AB.SIN, “Whose father is Sin,” which could be correct only for Inanna/Ishtar. The Ar - cher or Defender, “Sagittarius,” matched the numerous texts a nd hymns extolling Ninurta as the Divine Archer, his fa- ther’s warrior and defender. Sippar, the city of Utu/Shamash, no longer the site of a spaceport after the Deluge, was consid - ered in Sumerian times to be the center of Law and Justice, a nd the god was deemed (even by the later Babylonians) as the Chief Justice of the land; it is certain that the Scales of Justice, “Libra,” represented his constellation. And then there were the nicknames comparing the prow - ess, strength, or characteristics of a god with an animal held i n awe; Enlil’s, as text after text reiterated, was the Bull . It Figure 11"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"24 THE END OF DAYS was depicted on cylinder seals, on tablets dealing with as - tronomy, and in art. Some of the most beautiful art objects d iscovered in the Royal Tombs of Ur were bull heads sculpted in bronze, silver, and gold, adorned with semiprecious stones. Without doubt, the constellation of the Bull—Taurus— honored and symbolized Enlil. Its name, GUD.ANNA, meant “The Bull of Heaven,” and texts dealing with an ac - tual “Bull of Heaven” linked Enlil and his constellation to one o f the most unique places on Earth. It was a place that was called T he Landing Place —and it is there that one of the most amazing structures on Earth, including a stone tower that reaches to the heav - ens, still stands. Many texts from antiquity, including the Hebrew Bible, desc ribe or refer to the unique forest of tall and great cedar trees in Lebanon. In ancient times it extended for miles, sur - rounding the unique place—a va st stone platform built by the gods as their first space-related site on Earth , before their centers and real spaceport were established. It was, Su - merian texts attested, the only structure that had survived the D eluge, and could thus serve right after the Deluge as a base of operations for the Anunnaki; from it they revived the rav - ished lands with crops and domesticated animals. The place, c alled the “Landing Place” in the Epic of Gilgamesh , was that king’s destination in his search for immortality; we learn from the epic tale that it was there, in the sacred cedar forest, that Enlil kept the GUD.ANNA—the “Bull of Heaven,” the symbol of Enlil’s Age of the Bull. And what happened then in the sacred forest had a bearing on t he course of the affairs of gods and men. The journey to the Cedar Forest and its Landing Place, we l earn from the epic tale, began in Uruk, the city that Anu granted as a present to his great-granddaughter Inanna (a name that meant “Beloved of Anu”). Its king, early in the third millennium b.c.e. , was Gilgamesh (Fig. 12) . He was no ordinary man, for his mother was the goddess Ninsun, a member of Enlil’s family. That made Gilgamesh not a mere demi -god, but one who was “ two-thirds divine.” As he got older and began to contemplate matters of life and death, it"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"25 “And It Came to Pass” Figure 12 occurred to him that being two-thirds divine ought to make a difference; why should he “peer over the wall” like an ordi - nary mortal? he asked his mother. She agreed with him, but e xplained to him that the apparent immortality of the gods was in reality longevity due to the long orbital period of their planet. To attain such longevity he had to join the gods on Nibiru; and to do that, he had to go to the place where the rocket ships ascend and descend. Though warned of the journey’s hazards, Gilgamesh was det ermined to go. If I fail, he said, at least I will be remem - bered as one who had tried. At his mother’s insistence an a rtificial double, Enkidu (ENKI.DU meant “By Enki Made”), was to be his companion and guardian. Their adventures, told and retold in the Epic’s twelve tablets and its many an - cient renderings, can be followed in our book T he Stairway to Heaven. There were, in fact, not one but two journeys (Fig. 13) : one was to the Landing Place in the Cedar Forest, the other to the spaceport in the Sinai peninsula where—ac- cording to Egyptian depictions (Fig. 14) —rocket ships were emplaced in underground silos."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"26 THE END OF DAYS Figure 13 In the first journey circa 2860 b.c.e. —to the Cedar Forest in Lebanon—the duo were assisted by the god Shamash, the godfather of Gilgamesh, and the going was relatively quick and easy. After they reached the forest they witnessed during the night the launching of a rocket ship . This is how Gil - gamesh described it: The vision that I saw was wholly awesome! T he heavens shrieked, the earth boomed."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"27 “And It Came to Pass” Figure 14 Though daylight was dawning, darkness came. Lightning flashed, a flame shot up. The clouds swelled, it rained death! Then the glow vanished, the fire went out, And all that had fallen was turned to ashes. Awed but undeterred, the next day Gilgamesh and Enkidu d iscovered the secret entrance that had been used by the Anunnaki, but as soon as they entered it, they were attacked by a robotlike guardian who was armed with death beams and a revolving fire. They managed to destroy the monster, and relaxed by a brook thinking that their way in was clear. But when they ventured deeper into the Cedar Forest, a new challenger appeared: the Bull of Heaven. Unfortunately, the sixth tablet of the epic is too damaged f or the lines describing the creature and the battle with it to be completely legible. The legible portions do make it clear that the two comrades ran for their lives, pursued by the Bull of Heaven all the way back to Uruk; it was there that Enkidu managed to slay it. The text becomes legible where the boastful Gilgamesh, who cut off the bull’s thigh, “called"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"28 THE END OF DAYS Figure 15 the craftsmen, the armorers, the artisans” of Uruk to ad - mire the bull’s horns. The text suggets that they were ar tifi - cially made — “each is cast from thirty minas of lapis, the coating on each is two fingers thick.” Until another tablet with the illegible lines is discovered, w e shall not know for sure whether Enlil’s celestial symbol in the cedar forest was a specially selected living bull deco - rated and embellished with gold and precious stones or a ro - botic creature, an artificial monster. What we do know for c ertain is that upon its slaying, “Ishtar, in her abode, set up a wail” all the way to Anu in the heavens. The matter was so serious that Anu, Enlil, Enki, and Shamash formed a divine council to judge the comrades (only Enkidu ended up being punished) and to consider the slaying’s consequences. The ambitious Inanna/Ishtar had indeed reason to raise a w ail: the invincibility of Enlil’s Age had been pierced, and the Age itself was symbolically shortened by the cutting off of the bull’s thigh. We know from Egyptian sources, including picto - rial depictions in astronomical papyri (F ig. 15) , that the slay- ing’s symbolism was not lost on Marduk: it was taken to mean that in the heavens, too, the Age of Enlil had been cut short. Marduk’s attempt to establish an alternative space facility was n ot taken lightly by the Enlilites; the evidence suggests that Enlil and Ninurta were preoccupied with establishing their own alternative space facility on the other side of the Earth, in the Americas, near the post-Diluvial sources of gold."},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"29 “And It Came to Pass” This absence, together with the Bull of Heaven incident, us hered in a period of instability and confusion in their Mes - opotamian heartland, subjecting it to incursions from neigh - boring lands. People called Gutians, then the Elamites came f rom the East; Semitic-speaking peoples came from the West. But while the Easterners worshipped the same Enlilite gods as the Sumerians, the Amurru (“Westerners”) were dif - ferent. Along the shores of the “Upper Sea” (the Mediter - ranean), in the lands of the Canaanites, the people were b eholden to the Enki’ite gods of Egypt. Therein lay the seeds—perhaps to this day—of Holy Wars un dertaken “In the Name of God,” except that different peo - ples had different national gods . . . It was Inanna who came up with a brilliant idea; it can be desc ribed as “if you can’t fight them, invite them in.” One day, as she was roaming the skies in her Sky Chamber—it happened circa 2360 b.c.e. —she landed in a garden next to a sleeping man who had caught her fancy. She liked the sex, she liked the man. He was a Westerner, speaking a Semitic language. As he wrote later in his memoirs, he knew not who his father was, but knew that his mother was an Entu , a god’s priestess, who put him in a reed basket that was carried by the river’s flowing waters to a garden tended by Akki the Ir - rigator, who raised him as a son. The possibility that the strong and handsome man could ha ve been a god’s castoff son was enough for Inanna to rec- ommend to the other gods that the next king of the land s hould be this Amurru. When they agreed, she granted him the epithet-name Sharru-kin , the old cherished title of Su - merian kings. Not stemming from the previous recognized ro yal Sumerian lineages, he could not ascend the throne in any one of the olden capitals, and a brand-new city was es - tablished to serve as his capital. It was called Ag gade— “Union City.” Our textbooks call this king Sargon of Akkad and his Semitic language Akkadian. His kingdom, which added northern and northwestern provinces to ancient Sumer, was called Sumer & Akkad. Sargon lost little time in carrying out the mission for which he w as selected—to bring the “rebel lands” under control."},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"30 THE END OF DAYS Hymns to Inanna—henceforth known by the Akkadian name Is htar —had her tell Sargon that he would be remembered “by the destruction of the rebel land, massacring its people, making its rivers run with blood.” Sargon’s military expeditions were recorded and glorified in his own royal annals; his achieve - ments were summarized in the Sa rgon Chronicle thus: Sharru-kin, king of Aggade, Rose to power in the era of Ishtar. He left neither rival nor opponent. He spread his terror-inspiring awe in all the lands. He crossed the sea in the east, He conquered the country of the west in its full extent. The boast implies that the sacred space-related site, the Land - ing Place deep in the “country of the west,” was captured and he ld in behalf of Inanna/Ishtar—but not without opposition. Even texts written in glorification of Sargon state that “in his old age all the provinces revolted against him.” Counteran - nals, recording the events as viewed from Marduk’s side, re - veal that Marduk led a punishing counteroffensive: On account of the sacrilege Sargon committed, the great god Marduk became enraged . . . From east to west he alienated the people from Sargon, and punished him with an affliction of being without rest. Sargon’s territorial reach, it needs to be noted, included only one o f the four post-Diluvial space-related sites—only the Landing Place in the Cedar Forest (see Fig. 3). Sargon was briefly succeeded on the throne of Sumer & Akkad by two sons, but his true successor in spirit and deed was a grandson named Naram-Sin. The name meant “Sin’s favorite,” but the annals and inscriptions concerning his reign and military campaigns show that he was in fact Ishtar’s favorite. Texts and depictions record that Ishtar encouraged the king to seek grandeur and greatness by ceaseless conquest and destruc -"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"31 “And It Came to Pass” tion of her enemies, actively assisting him on the battlefields. D epictions of her, which used to show her as an enticing god - dess of love, now showed her as a goddess of war, bristling wi th weapons (Fig. 16) . It was warfare not without a plan—a plan to counter Mar- du k’s ambitions by capturing all the space-related sites in be - half of Inanna/Ishtar. The lists of cities captured or subdued b y Naram-Sin indicate that he not only reached the Mediter - ranean Sea—assuring control of the Landing Place—but also t urned southward to invade Egypt. Such an incursion into the Enki’ite domains was unprecedented, and it could take place, a careful reading of the records reveals, because Inanna/Ishtar had formed an unholy alliance with Nergal, Marduk’s brother who espoused Inanna’s sister. The thrust into Egypt also re - quired entering and crossing the neutral Sacred Region in the S inai Peninsula, where the spaceport was located—another breach of the olden Peace Treaty. Boastful, Naram-Sin gave himself the title “King of the four regions” . . . We can hear the protests of Enki. We can read texts that re - cord Marduk’s warnings. It was all more than even the Enlilite l eadership could condone. A long text known as The Curse of Aggade , which tells the story of the Akkadian dynasty, clearly states that its end came about “after the frowning of the fore - head of Enlil.” And so the “word of Ekur”—the decision of En lil from his temple in Nippur—was to put an end to it: “The word of the Ekur was upon Aggade” to be destroyed and Figure 16"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"32 THE END OF DAYS wiped off the face of the Earth. Naram-Sin’s end came circa 22 60 b.c.e. ; texts from that time report that troops from the territory in the east, called Gutium, loyal to Ninurta, were the instrument of divine wrath; Aggade was never rebuilt, never resettled; that royal city, indeed, has never been found. The saga of Gilgamesh at the start of the third millennium b.c.e . , and the military forays of the Akkadian kings near the end of that millennium, provide a clear background for that millennium’s events: the targets were the space-related sites—by Gilgamesh to attain the gods’ longevity, by the kings beholden to Ishtar to attain supremacy. Without doubt, it was Marduk’s “Tower of Babel” attempt t hat placed the control of the space-related sites at the center of the affairs of gods and men; and as we shall see, that centrality dominated much (if not most) of what took later place. The Akkadian phase of the War and Peace on Earth was not wi thout celestial or “messianic” aspects. In his chronicles, Sargon’s titles followed the customary hon orific “Overseer of Ishtar, king of Kish, great Ensi of En - lil,” but he also called himself “ a nointed priest of Anu .” It was the first time that being divinely anointed —which is what “Messiah” literally means—appears in ancient inscriptions. Marduk, in his pronouncements, warned of coming up - heavals and cosmic phenomena: The day shall be turned into darkness, the flow of river waters shall be disarrayed, the lands shall be laid to waste, the people will be made to perish. Looking back, recalling similar biblical prophecies, it is c lear that on the eve of the twenty-first century b.c.e. , gods and men expected a coming Apocalyptic Time."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"3 EGYPTIAN PROPHECIES, HUMAN DESTINIES In the annals of Man on Earth, the twenty-first century b.c.e. saw in the ancient Near East one of civilization’s most glori - ous chapters, known as the Ur III period. It was at the same t ime the most difficult and crushing one, for it witnessed the end of Sumer in a deathly nuclear cloud. And after that, nothing was the same. Those momentous events, as we shall see, were also the root o f the messianic manifestations that centered on Jerusalem when b.c.e. turned to a.d. some twenty-one centuries later. The historic events of that memorable century—as all events i n history—had their roots in what had taken place before. Of that, the year 2160 b.c.e. is a date worth remembering. The annals of Sumer & Akkad from that time record a major policy shift by the Enlilite gods. In Egypt, the date marked the begin- ning of changes of political-religious significance, and what o ccurred in both zones coincided with a new phase in Marduk’s campaign to attain supremacy. Indeed, it was Marduk’s chess- like strategy maneuvers and geographic movements from one place to another that controlled the agenda of the era’s “divine chess game.” His moves and movements began with a depar - ture from Egypt, to become (in Egyptian eyes) Am on (a lso written Amun or Amen ), “ The Unseen .” The date of 2160 b. c.e. is considered by Egyptologists to mark the beginning of what is designated the First Interme - diate Period—a chaotic interval between the end of the Old K ingdom and the dynastic start of the Middle Kingdom. During the thousand years of the Old Kingdom, when the religious-political capital was Memphis in Middle Egypt, the"},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"34 THE END OF DAYS Egyptians worshipped the Ptah pantheon, erecting monu - mental temples to him, to his son Ra, and to their divine suc - cessors. The famed inscriptions of the Memphite Pharaohs gl orified the gods and promised an Afterlife for the kings. Reigning as the gods’ surrogates, those Pharaohs wore the double crown of Upper (southern) and Lower (northern) Egypt, signifying not just the administrative but also the religious unification of the Two Lands, unification attained when Horus defeated Seth in their struggle for the Ptah/Ra legacy. And then, in 2160 b.c.e. , that unity and religious certainty came crashing down. The turmoil saw a breakup of the Union, abandonment of t he capital, attacks from the south by Theban princes to gain control, foreign incursions, desecration of temples, a collapse of law and order, and droughts, famines, and food riots. Those conditions are recalled in a papyrus known as the Ad- monitions of Ipu-Wer, a l ong hieroglyphic text that consists of several sections in which it gives an account of calamities and tribulations, blames an unholy enemy for religious wrong - doing and social evils, and calls on the people to repent and res ume the religious rites. A prophetic section describing the coming of a Redeemer , and another that extolls the ideal times that will follow, conclude the papyrus. At its start the text describes the breakdown of law and order a nd of a functioning society—a situation in which “the doorkeepers go and plunder, the wash-man refuses to carry his load . . . robbery is everywhere . . . a man regards his son as an enemy.” Though the Nile is in flooding and irrigates the land, “no one ploughs . . . grain has perished . . . the storehouses are bare . . . dust is throughout the land . . . the desert spreads . . . women are dried up, no one can con - ceive . . . the dead are just thrown into the river . . . the river is b lood.” The roads are unsafe, trade has ceased, the prov - inces of Upper Egypt are no longer taxed; “there is civil w ar . . . barbarians from elsewhere have come to Egypt . . . all is in ruin.” Some Egyptologists believe that at the core of those events la y a simple rivalry for wealth and power, an attempt (suc - cessful in the end) by Theban princes from the south to con- trol and rule the whole country. Lately, studies have associated"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"35 Egyptian Prophecies, Human Destinies the collapse of the Old Kingdom with a “climate change” t hat undermined a society founded on agriculture, caused food shortages and food riots, social upheaval, and collapse of authority. But little attention has been paid to a major and perhaps the most important change: in the texts, in the hymns, in the honorific names of temples, it was no longer Ra but from then on Ra -Amon , or simply Amon , who was henceforth worshipped; Ra became Amon —Ra the Un- seen—for he was gone from Egypt. It was indeed a religious change that caused the political a nd societal breakdown, the unidentified Ipu-Wer wrote; we believe that the change was Ra’s becoming Amon. The up - heaval began with a collapse of religious observances and m anifested itself in the defiling and abandonment of temples, where “the Place of Secrets has been laid bare, the writings of the august enclosure have been scattered, common men tear them up in the streets . . . magic is exposed, it is in the sight of him who knows it not.” The sacred symbol of the gods worn on the king’s crown, the Uraeus (the Divine Ser - pent), “is rebelled against . . . religious dates are dis - turbed . . . priests are carried off wrongfully.” After calling on the people to repent, “to offer incense in t he temples . . . to keep the offerings to the gods,” the papy - rus called on the repenters to b e baptized —to “remember to immerse.” Then the words of the papyrus turn prophetic: in a passage that even Egyptologists call “truly messianic,” the Admonitions speak of “a time that shall come” when an un- named Sav ior—a “god-king” —shall appear. Starting with a small following, of him “men shall say: He brings coolness upon the heart, He is a shepherd of all men. Though his herds may be small, He will spend the days caring for them . . . Then he would smite down evil, He would stretch forth his arm against it.” “People will be asking: ‘Where is he today? Is he then sle eping?

This, the papyrus conc luded, was “What Ipu-Wer said when he responded to the majesty of the All-Lord.” If not just the description of events and the messianic prophe cies, but also the choice of wording in that ancient Egyptian papyrus seem astounding, there is more to come. Scholars are aware of the existence of another prophetic/ messianic text that reached us from ancient Egypt, but be - lieve that it was really composed after the events and only p retends to be prophetic by dating itself to an earlier time. To be specific, while the text purports to relate prophecies made at the time of Sneferu, a Fourth Dynasty pharaoh (circa 2600 b.c.e. ), Egyptologists believe that it was actually written in the time of Amenemhet I of the Twelfth Dynasty (circa 2000 b.c.e. )— afte r the events that it pretends to prophecy. Even so, the “prophecies” serve to confirm those prior occur - rences; and many details and the very wording of the predic - tions can best be described as chilling. The prophecies are purported to be told to King Sneferu b y a “great seer-priest” named Nefer-Rohu, “a man of rank, a scribe competent with his fingers.” Summoned to the king to foretell the future, Nefer-Rohu “stretched forth his hand for the box of writing equipment, he drew forth a scroll of papy - rus,” and then began to write what he was envisioning, in a No stradamus-like manner: Behold, there is something about which men speak; It is terrifying . . .

Yet the bu ilding of the new temple required special permission from Enlil, which was in time granted. We learn from the inscrip - tions that the new temple had to have special features linking i t to the heavens, enabling certain celestial observations. To that end Ninurta invited to Sumer the god Ningishzidda (“Thoth” in Egypt), the Divine Architect, and Keeper of the Secrets of the Giza pyramids. The fact that Ningishzidda/ Thoth was the brother whom Marduk forced into exile circa 310 0 b.c.e. was certainly not lost on all concerned . . . The amazing circumstances surrounding the announce - ment, planning, construction, and dedication of the E.NINNU ( “House/Temple of Fifty”) are told in great detail in Gudea’s inscriptions; they were unearthed in the ruins of Lagash (a site now called Tello) and are quoted at length in The Earth Chron - icles b ooks. W hat emerges from that deta iled record (inscr ibed on two clay cylinders in clear Sumerian cuneiform script, Fig. 17 ) is the fact that from announcement to dedication, ev - ery step and every detail of the new temple was dictated by ce lestial aspects. Those special celestial aspects had to do with the very t iming of the temple’s building: It was the time, as the in - scriptions’ opening lines declare, when “in the heavens des - tinies on Earth were determined”: At the time when in heaven destinies on Earth were determined, “Lagash shall lift its head heavenwards in accordance with the Great Tablet of Destinies” Enlil in favor of Ninurta decided. That special time when the destinies on Earth are deter - mined in the heavens was what we have called Celestial T ime, the Zodiacal Clock. That such determining was linked to Equinox Day becomes evident from the rest of Gudea’s tale, as well as from Thoth’s Egyptian name Tehuti, The Bal - ancer ( of day and night) who “Draws the Cord” for orienting"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"39 Egyptian Prophecies, Human Destinies Figure 17 a new temple. Such celestial considerations continued to dominate the Eninnu project from start to finish.

In that vision-dream (the first of several) the god Ninurta app eared at sunrise, and the sun was aligned with the planet Jupiter.

Next the goddess Nisaba ap - peared; she was wearing the image of a temple structure on her he ad; the goddess was holding a tablet on which the starry heavens were depicted, and with a stylus she kept pointing to the “favorable celestial constellation.” A third god, Ningishzidda (i.e. Thoth) held a tablet of lapis lazuli on which a structural plan was drawn; he also held a clay brick, a mold for brickmaking, and a builder’s carrying basket. When Gudea awoke, the three gods were gone, but the archi - tectural tablet was on his lap ( Fig. 18) and the brick and its mold were at his feet! Gudea needed the help of an oracle goddess and two more v ision-dreams to understand the meaning of it all. In the third vision-dream he was shown a holographic-like ani - mated demonstration of the temple’s building, starting with t he initial alignment with the indicated celestial point, the laying of foundations, the molding of bricks—the construc - tion all the way up, step by step. Both the start of construc- tion and the final dedication ceremony were to be held on s ignals from the gods on specific days; both fell on New Year’s Day, which meant the day of the Spring Equinox. Figure 18"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"41 Egyptian Prophecies, Human Destinies The temple “raised its head” in the customary seven stages, bu t—unusually for the flat-topped Sumerian ziggurats—its head had to be pointed, “shaped like a horn”—Gudea had to emplace upon the temple’s top a capstone! Its shape is not described, but in all probability (and judging by the image on Nisaba’s head), it was in the shape of a pyramidion—in the manner of capstones on Egyptian pyramids (Fig. 19) . More - over, rather than leave the brickwork exposed, as was cus- tomary, Gudea was required to encase the structure with a ca sing of reddish stones, increasing its similarity to an Egyp - tian pyramid. “The outside view of the temple was like that o f a mountain set in place.” That raising a structure with the appearance of an Egyptian p yramid had a purpose becomes clear from Ninurta’s own words. The new temple, he told Gudea, will be seen from afar; its awe-inspiring glance will reach the heavens; the ado - ration of my temple shall extend to all the lands, its heavenly n ame will be proclaimed in countries from the ends of the Earth— In Magan and Meluhha it will cause people [to say]: Ningirsu [the “Lord of the Girsu”], the Great Hero from the Lands of Enlil, is a god who has no equal; He is the lord of all the Earth.

The ziggurat’s en - trance had to face the Sun precisely in the east, rather than t he customary northeast. In the temple’s topmost level Gudea had to erect a SHU.GA.LAM—“where the shining is an - nounced, the place of the aperture, the place of determin- ing,” from which Ninurta/Ningirsu could see “the Repetition o ver the lands.” It was a circular chamber with twelve posi - tions, each marked with a zodiacal symbol, with an aperture f or observing the skies— an ancient planetarium aligned to the zodiacal constellations!"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"43 Egyptian Prophecies, Human Destinies Figure 21 In the temple’s forecourt, linked to an avenue that faced sunrise, Gudea had to erect two stone circles, one with six and the other with seven stone pillars, for observing the skies. Since only one avenue is mentioned, one assumes that the cir - cles were one within the other. As one studies each phrase, t erminology, and structural detail, it becomes evident that what was built in Lagash with the help of Ningishzidda/Thoth was a complex yet practical stone observatory, one part of which, devoted entirely to the zodiacs, reminds one of the similar one found in Denderah, Egypt (Fig. 20) , and the other, geared to observing celestial risings and setting, a virtual Stonehenge on the banks of the Euphrates river! Like Stonehenge in the British Isles (F ig. 21) , the one built in Lagash provided stone markers for solar observations of sol - stices and equinoxes, but the prime outside feature was the c reation of a sight line from a center stone, continued between two stone pillars, then on down an avenue to another stone. Such a sight line, precisely oriented when planned, enabled determining at the moment of heliacal rising in which zodiacal"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"44 THE END OF DAYS constellation the Sun was appearing. And that—determining the zodiacal age through precise observation—was the prime objective of the whole complex facility . In Stonehenge, that sight line ran (and still runs) from the s tone column called the Altar Stone in the center, through two stone columns identified as Sarsen Stones numbers 1 and 30, then down the Avenue to the so-called Heel Stone (see Fig. 6). It is generally agreed that the Stonehenge with the double Bluestone Circle and the Heel Stone of what is designated Stonehenge II dates to between 2200 to 2100 b.c.e. That was also the time—perhaps more accurately, in 2160 b.c.e. —when the “Stonehenge on the Euphrates” was built . And that was no chance coincidence. Like those two zo - diacal observatories, other stone observatories proliferated at t he same time in other places on Earth—at various sites in Europe, in South America, on the Golan Heights northeast of Israel, even in faraway China (where archaeologists discov - ered in the Shanzi province a stone circle with thirteen pil - lars aligned to the zodiac and dating to 2100 b.c.e . ). They were all deliberate countermoves by Ninurta and Ningish- zidda to Marduk’s Divine Chess Game: to show Mankind t hat the zodiacal age was still the Age of the Bull. Various texts from that time, including an autobiographical t ext by Marduk and a longer text known as the Erra Epos, shed light on Marduk’s wanderings away from Egypt, mak - ing him there the Hidden One. They also reveal that his de - mands and actions assumed an urgency and ferocity because o f a conviction that his time for supremacy has come. The Heavens bespeak my glory as Lord, was his claim. Why? Because, he announced, the Age of the Bull, the Age of En- lil, was over; t he Age of the Ram, Marduk’s zodiacal age, has arrived. It was, just as Ninurta had told Gudea, the time when in the heavens destinies on Earth were determined. The zodiacal ages, it will be recalled, were caused by the phen omenon of Precession, the retardation in Earth’s orbit around the Sun. The retardation accumulates to 1 degree (out of 360) in 72 years; an arbitrary division of the grand circle"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"45 Egyptian Prophecies, Human Destinies into 12 segments of 30 degrees each means that mathemat - ically the zodiacal calendar shifts from one Age to another e very 2,160 years. Since the Deluge occurred, according to Sumerian texts, in the Age of the Lion, our zodiacal clock can start circa 10860 b.c.e. An astounding timetable emerges if, in this ma themati - cally determined 2 ,160-year zodiacal calendar, the starting point of 10800 b.c. rather than 10860 b.c. is chosen: 10800 to 8640—Age of the Lion (Leo) 8640 to 6480—Age of the Crab (Cancer) 6480 to 4320—Age of the Twins (Gemini) 4320 to 2160—Age of the Bull (Taurus) 2160 to 0—Age of the Ram (Aries) Setting aside the neat end result that s ynchronizes with the Christian Era , one must wonder whether it was mere coinci - dence that the Ishtar-Ninurta era petered out in or about 2160 b.c.e . , just when, according to the above zodiacal calendar, the Age of the Bull, Enlil’s Age, was also ending? Probably not; certainly Marduk did not think so. The available evidence suggests that he was sure that according to Celestial Time, his time for supremacy, his Age, has arrived. (Modern studies of Mesopotamian astronomy indeed confirm that the zodiacal circle was divided there into 12 houses of 30 degrees each—a mathematical rather than an observational division.) The various texts we have mentioned indicate that as he mo ved about, Marduk made another foray into the Enlilite heartland, arriving back in Babylon with a retinue of follow - ers. Rather than resort to armed conflict, the Enlilites enlisted Ma rduk’s brother Nergal (whose spouse was a granddaughter of Enlil) to come to Babylon from southern Africa and per - suade his brother to leave. In his memoirs, known as Th e Erra Epos, Nergal reported that Marduk’s chief argument was that his time, the Age of the Ram, had arrived. But Nergal counter- argued that it is not really so: the Heliacal Rising, he told Mar - duk, still occurs in the constellation of the Bull! Enraged, Marduk questioned the accuracy of the observa - tions. What happened to the precise and reliable instruments,"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"46 THE END OF DAYS from before the Deluge, that were installed in your Lower W orld domain? he demanded to know from Nergal. Nergal explained that they were destroyed by the Deluge. Come, see for yourself which constellation is seen at sunrise on the ap - pointed day, he urged Marduk. Whether Marduk went to L agash to make the observation, we do not know, but he did realize the cause of the discrepancy: While mathematically the ages changed every 2,160 years, i n reality, observationally, they did not. The zodiacal con - stellations, in which stars were grouped arbitrarily, were not o f equal size. Some occupied a larger arc of the heavens, some smaller; and as it happened, the constellation of the Ram was one of the smaller ones, squeezed between the larger Taurus and Pisces (Fig. 22) . Celestially, the constella - tion Taurus, occupying more than 30 degrees of the heavenly a rc, lingers on for at least another two centuries beyond its mathematical length. In the twenty-first century b. c.e. , Celestial Time and Messianic Time failed to coincide. Go away peacefully and come back when the heavens will de clare your Age, Nergal told Marduk. Yielding to his fate, Marduk did leave, but did not go too far away. And with him, as emissary, spokesman, and herald, w as his son, whose mother was an Earthling woman. Figure 22"},{"pageNumber":54,"pageContent":"4 OF GODS AND DEMIGODS The decision of Marduk to stay in or near the contested lands and to involve his son in the struggle for Mankind’s alle - giance persuaded the Enlilites to return Sumer’s central cap - it a l t o Ur, t h e c u lt c e n t e r o f Na n n a r (S u - e n o r Sin in Akkadian). It was the third time that Ur was chosen to serve in that ca- pacity—hence the designation “Ur III” for that period. The move linked the affairs of the contending gods to t he biblical tale—and role—of Abraham, and the inter - twined relationship changed Religion to this day. Among the many reasons for the choice of Nannar/Sin as t he Enlilite champion was the realization that contending with Marduk has expanded beyond the affairs of the gods alone, and has become a contest for the minds and hearts of the people—of the very Earthlings whom the gods had cre - ated, who now made up the armies that went to war on be - half of their creators . . . Unlike other Enlilites, Nannar/Sin was not a combatant i n the Wars of the Gods; his selection was meant to signal to people everywhere, even in the “rebel lands,” that under his leadership an era of peace and prosperity would begin. He and his spouse Ningal (Fig. 23) were greatly beloved by the people of Sumer, and Ur itself spelled prosperity and well - being; its very name, which meant “urban, domesticated p lace,” came to mean not just “city” but The City—the urban jewel of the ancient lands. Nannar/Sin’s temple there, a skyscraping ziggurat, rose i n stages within a walled sacred precinct where a variety of structures served as the gods’ abode and the residences and"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"48 THE END OF DAYS Figure 23 functional buildings of a legion of priests, officials, and ser - vants who attended to the divine couple’s needs and arranged t he religious observances by king and people. Beyond those walls there extended a magnificent city with two harbors and canals linking it to the Euphrates river (Fig. 24) , a great city with the king’s palace, administrative buildings (including for scribes and recordkeeping as well as for tax collecting), multilevel private dwellings, workshops, schools, merchants’ warehouses, and stalls—all in wide streets where, at many intersections, prayer shrines open to all travelers were built. The majestic ziggurat with its monumental stairways (Re - construction, Fi g. 25 ), though long in ruins, still dominates the landscape even after more than 4,000 years. But there was another compelling reason. Unlike the con - tending Ninurta and Marduk, who were both “immigrants” to E arth from Nibiru, Nannar/Sin was born on Earth. He was not only Enlil’s Firstborn on Earth—he was the first of the first generation of gods to be born on Earth. His children, the twins Utu/Shamash and Inanna/Ishtar, and their sister Eresh - kigal, who belonged to the gods’ third generation, were all b orn on Earth.

The new king, named Ur-Nammu (“The joy of Ur”), was carefully selected by Enlil and approved by Anu, and he was no mere Earthling: He was a son—“the beloved son”—of the goddess Ninsun; she had been, the reader will recall, the mother of Gilgamesh. Since this divine"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"50 THE END OF DAYS genealogy was restated in numerous inscriptions during U r-Nammu’s reign, in the presence of Nannar and other gods, one must assume that the claim was factual. This made Ur-Nammu not only a demigod but—as was the case of Gil- gamesh—“two-thirds divine.” Indeed, the claim that the king’s mother was the goddess Ninsun placed Ur-Nammu in the very same status as that of Gilgamesh, whose exploits were well remembered and whose name remained revered. The choice was thus a signal, to friends and foes alike, that the glorious days under the unchallenged authority of Enlil and his clan are back. All that was important, perhaps even crucial, because Mar - duk had his own attributes of appeal to the masses of Man - kind. That special appeal to the Earthlings was the fact that Ma rduk’s deputy and chief campaigner was his son Nabu — who not only was born on Earth, but was born to a mother who herself was an Earthling, for long ago—indeed, in the days before the Deluge—Marduk broke all traditions and ta - boos and took an Earthling woman to be his official wife. That young Anunnaki took Earthling females as wives should n ot come as a shocking surprise, for it is recorded in the Bible for all to read. What is little known even to scholars, because the information is found in ignored texts and has to be veri - fied from complex God Lists, is the fact that it was Marduk w ho set the example that the “Sons of the gods” followed: And it came to pass when the Earthlings began to increase in number upon the Earth and daughters were born unto them— That the sons of the Elohim saw the daughters of The Adam that they were compatible; And they took unto themselves wives of whichever they chose.

(My readers may recall that it was my question, as a sc hoolboy, of why Nefilim —which literally means “Those who have come down,” who descended [from heaven to Earth]—was usually translated “giants.” It was much later that I realized and suggested that the Hebrew word for “gi - ants,” Anakim , was actually a rendering of the Sumerian Anunnaki. ) The Bible clearly cites such intermarriage—the “ takin g as wives ”—between young “sons of the gods” (sons of the Elo - him , t he Nefilim ) and female Earthlings (“daughters of The Adam ”) as God’s reason for seeking Mankind’s end by the Deluge: “My spirit shall no longer dwell in Man, for in his flesh they erred . . . And God repented that He had fashioned the Adam on Earth, and was distraught, and He said: Let me wipe the Adam that I have created off the face of the Earth.” The Sumerian and Akkadian texts telling the story of the D eluge explained that two gods were involved in that drama: it was Enlil who sought Mankind’s destruction by the Deluge, while it was Enki who connived to prevent it by instructing “Noah” to build the salvaging ark. When we delve into the details, we find that Enlil’s “I’ve had it up to here!” anger on one hand, and Enki’s counterefforts on the other hand, were not just a matter of principles. For it was Enki himself who began to copulate with female Earthlings and have children by them , and it was Marduk, Enki’s son, who led the way to and set the example for actual marriages with them . . .

We know that Ninmah, the Anunnaki’s chief medical officer, came to Earth at the head of a group of female nurses (Fig. 26) . It is not stated how many they were or whether there were other fe - males among the Anunnaki, but it is clear that in any event f emales were few among them. The situation required strict sexual rules and supervision by the elders, so much so that (according to one text) Enki and Ninmah had to act as match - makers, decreeing who should marry whom. Enlil, a strict disciplinarian, himself fell victim to the s hortage of females and date-raped a young nurse. For that even he, the Commander in Chief on Earth, was punished with exile; the punishment was commuted when he agreed to marry Sud and make her his official consort, Ninlil . She re - mained his sole spouse to the very end. Enki, on the other hand, is described in numerous texts as a ph ilanderer with female goddesses of all ages, and manag - ing to get away with it. Moreover, once “daughters of The A dam” proliferated, he was not averse to having sexual flings with them, too . . .

Apocryphal texts inform us that when Noah, the biblical hero o f the Deluge, was born, much about the baby and the birth caused his father, Lamech, to wonder whether the real father had not been one of the Nefilim. The Bible just states that Noah was a genealogically “perfect” man who “Walked with the Elohim”; Sumerian texts, where the Flood’s hero is named Ziusudra, suggest that he was a demigod son of Enki. It was thus that one day Marduk complained to his mother t hat while his companions were assigned wives, he was not: “I have no wife, I have no children.” And he went on to tell her that he had taken a liking to the daughter of a “high priest, an accomplished musician” (there is reason to believe that he was the chosen man Enmeduranki of Sumerian texts, the parallel of the biblical Enoch). Verifying that the young Earthling female—her name was Tsarpanit—agreed, Mar- duk’s parents gave him the go-ahead. The marriage produced a son. He was named EN.SAG, “ Lofty Lord.” But unlike Adapa, who was an Earthling demi - god, Marduk’s son was included in the Sumerian God Lists, w here he was also called “the divine MESH”—a term used (as in GilgaMESH) to denote a demigod. He was thus the first demigod who was a god . Later on, when he led the masses of humans in his father’s behalf, he was given the epithet-name Nabu — The Spokesman , The Prophet —for that is what the literal meaning of the word is, as is the meaning of the paral - lel biblical Hebrew word Na bih, translated “prophet.” Nabu was thus the god-son and an Adam-son of an - cient scriptures, the one whose very name meant Prophet. A s in the Egyptian prophecies earlier quoted, his name and role became linked to the Messianic expectations.

Finding an op- p ortunity—perhaps an invitation to come and celebrate Mar- duk’s wedding—they seized Earthling females and carried them off as wives. Several extra-biblical books, designated The Apocrypha, such as the Book of Jubilees , the Book of Enoch , and the Book of Noah , record the incident of the intermarriage by the Nefilim and fill in the details. Some two hundred “Watch - ers” (“Those who observe and see”) organized themselves in t wenty groups; each group had a named leader. One, called Shamyaza, was in overall command. The instigator of the transgression, “the one who led astray the sons of God and brought them down to Earth and led them astray through the Daughters of Man,” was named Yeqon . . . It happened, these sources confirmed, during the time of Enoch. In spite of their efforts to fit the Sumerian sources (that to ld of rival and contradicting Enlil and Enki) into a mono - theistic framework—the belief in only one Almighty God— t he compilers of the Hebrew Bible ended that section in chapter 6 of Genesis with a recognition of the factual out - come. Speaking of the offspring of those intermarriages, the B ible makes two admissions: the first, that the intermarrying took place in the days before the Deluge, “ and therafter too ”; and secondly, that from the offspring “came the heroes of old, the men of renown.” The Sumerian texts indicate that post-Diluvial heroic kings were indeed such demigods. But they were the offspring not only of Enki and his clan: s ometimes kings in the Enlilite region were sons of Enlilite gods. For example, The Sumerian King Lists clearly state that when kingship began in Uruk (an Enlilite domain), the one chosen for kingship was a MESH, a demigod: Meskiaggasher, a son of Utu, became high priest and king. Utu was of course the god Utu/Shamash, grandson of Enlil. Fu rther down the dynastic line there was the famed Gilgamesh, “two-thirds of him divine,” son of the Enlilite goddess Ninsun and fathered by the High Priest of Uruk, an Earthling. (There"},{"pageNumber":62,"pageContent":"55 Of Gods and Demigods were several more rulers down the line, both in Uruk and in U r, who bore the title “Mesh” or “Mes”.) In Egypt, too, some Pharaohs claimed divine parentage. Ma ny in the 18th and 19th Dynasties adopted theophoric names with a prefix or suffix MSS (rendered Mes, Mose, Meses), meaning “Issue of ” this or that god—such as the names Ah-mes or Ra-mses (RA-MeSeS—“issue of,” offspring of, the god Ra). The famed queen Hatshepsut, who though a female seized the title and privileges of a Pharaoh, claimed that right by virtue of being a demigod—the great god Amon, she claimed in inscriptions and depictions in her immense temple at Deir el Bahri, “took the form of his majesty the king,” the husband of her queen-mother, “had intercourse with her,” and caused Hatshepsut to be born as his semidi - vine daughter. Canaanite texts included the tale of Keret, a k ing who was the son of the god El. An interesting variant on such demigod-as-king practices w as the case of Eannatum, a Sumerian king in Ninurta’s Lagash during the early “heroic” times. An inscription by the king on a well-known monument of his (the “Stela of the Vultures”) attributes his demigod status to artificial insemi - nation b y Ninurta (the Lord of the Girsu, the sacred pre - cinct), and to help from Inanna/Ishtar and Ninmah (here ca lled by her epithet Ninharsag): The Lord Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, implanted the semen of Enlil for Eannatum in the womb of [ . . . ]. Inanna accompanied his [birth], named him “Worthy in the Eanna temple,” set him on the sacred lap of Ninharsag. Ninharsag offered him her sacred breast. Ningirsu rejoiced over Eannatum— semen implanted in the womb by Ningirsu. While the reference to the “semen of Enlil” leaves unclear w hether Ninurta/Ningirsu’s own semen is here considered “semen of Enlil” because he was Enlil’s firstborn, or actually used Enlil’s semen for the insemination (which is doubtful),"},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"56 THE END OF DAYS the inscription clearly claims that Eannatum’s mother (whose na me is illegible on the stela) was artificially impregnated, so that a demigod was conceived without actual sexual inter- course— a case of immaculate conception in third millen - nium b. c.e. Sumer! That the gods were no strangers to artificial insemination is cor roborated by Egyptian texts, according to which after Seth killed and dismembered Osiris, the god Thoth extracted semen from the phallus of Osiris and impregnated with it the wife of Osiris, Isis, bringing about the birth of the god Horus. A depiction of the feat shows Thoth and birth goddesses holding the two strands of DNA that were used, and Isis holding the newborn Horus (Fig. 27) . Clearly, then, after the Deluge the Enlilites too accepted b oth the mating with Earthling females and considered the offspring “heroes, men of renown,” suitable for kingship. Royal “bloodlines” of demigods were thus begun. One of the first tasks of Ur-Nammu was to carry out a moral a nd religious revival. And for that, too, a former revered and remembered king was emulated. It was done through the promulgation of a new Code of Laws, laws of moral behav- Figure 27"},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"57 Of Gods and Demigods ior, laws of justice—of adherence, the Code said, to the laws t hat Enlil and Nannar and Shamash had wanted the king to enforce and the people to live by. The nature of the laws, a list of do’s and don’ts, can be j udged by Ur-Nammu’s claim that due to those laws of jus- tice, “the orphan did not fall prey to the wealthy, the widow d id not fall prey to the powerful, the man with one sheep was not delivered to the man with one ox . . . justice was estab - lished in the land.” In that he emulated—sometimes using t he exact same phrases—a previous Sumerian king, Uruka - gina of Lagash, who three hundred years earlier had promul - gated a law code by which social, legal, and religious reforms w ere instituted (among them the establishment of women’s safehouses under the patronage of the goddess Bau, Ninurta’s spouse). These, it ought to be pointed out, were the very same principles of justice and morality that the biblical prophets demanded of kings and people in the next millennium. As the era of Ur III began, there was obviously a deliber - ate attempt to return Sumer (now Sumer & Akkad) to its o lden days of glory, prosperity, and morality and peace—the times that preceded the latest confrontation with Marduk. The inscriptions, the monuments, and the archaeological e vidence attest that Ur-Nammu’s reign, which began in 2113 b.c.e. , witnessed extensive public works, restoration of river navigation, and the rebuilding and protection of the country’s highways: “He made the highways run from the lower lands to the upper lands,” an inscription stated. Greater trade and com - merce followed. There was a surge in arts, crafts, schools, and o ther improvements in social and economic life (including the introduction of more accurate weights and measures). Treaties with neighboring rulers to the east and northeast spread the prosperity and well-being. The great gods, especially Enlil and Ninlil, were honored with renovated and magnified temples, and for the first time in Sumer’s history, the priesthood of Ur was combined with that of Nippur, leading a religious revival.

That conclusion only increased the puzzlement caused by a beautifully crafted box that was"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"58 THE END OF DAYS uncovered by archaeologists: its inlaid panels, front and ba ck, depicted two contradicting scenes of life in Ur.

A close examination of the records from that time reveals t hat indeed while under the leadership of Ur-Nammu Sumer itself flourished, the hostility to the Enlilites by the “rebel lands” increased rather than diminished. The situation ap - parently demanded action, for accordng to Ur-Nammu’s in - scriptions Enlil gave him a “divine weapon that heaps up the r ebels in piles” with which to attack “the hostile lands, de - stroy the evil cities and clear them of opposition.” Those “reb el lands” and “sinning cities” were west of Sumer, the Figure 28"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"59 Of Gods and Demigods lands of Marduk’s Amorite followers; there, the “evil”—the hos tility against Enlil—was fanned by Nabu, who moved about from city to city proselytizing for Marduk. Enlilite re - cords called him “The Oppressor,” of whose influence the “ sinning cities” had to be rid. There is reason to believe that the Peace and War panels a ctually depicted Ur-Nammu himself—one showing him banqueting and celebrating peace and prosperity, the other in the royal chariot, leading his army to war. His military expedi - tions took him well beyond Sumer’s borders into the western la nds. But Ur-Nammu—great reformer, builder, and eco - nomic “shepherd” that he was—failed as a military leader. In t he midst of battle his chariot got stuck in the mud; Ur- Nammu fell off it, but “the chariot like a storm rushed along,” leaving the king behind, “abandoned like a crushed jug.” The tragedy was compounded when the boat returning Ur-Nam- mu’s body to Sumer “in an unknown place had sunk; the waves sank it down, with him on board.” When news of the defeat and the tragic death of Ur-Nammu rea ched Ur, a great lament went up there. The people could not understand how such a religiously devout king, a righteous shepherd who only followed the gods’ directives with weapons they put in his hands, could perish so ignominiously. “Why did the Lord Nannar not hold him by the hand?” they asked; “Why did Inanna, Lady of Heaven, not put her noble arm around his head? Why did the valiant Utu not assist him?” The Sumerians, who believed that all that happens had been f ated, wondered, “Why did these gods step aside when Ur- Nammu’s bitter fate was decided?” Surely those gods, Nannar and his twin children, knew what Anu and Enlil were deter - mining; yet they said nothing to protect Ur-Nammu. There cou ld be only one plausible explanation, the people of Ur and Sumer concluded as they cried out and lamented: The great gods must have gone back on their word— How the fate of the hero had been changed! Anu altered his holy word. Enlil deceitfully changed his decree!"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"60 THE END OF DAYS These are strong words, accusing the great Enlilite gods of de ceit and double-crossing! The ancient words convey the extent of the people’s disappointment. If that was so in Sumer & Akkad, one can imagine the reac - tion in the rebellious western lands. In the struggle for the hearts and minds of Mankind, the En lilites were faltering. Nabu, the “spokesman,” intensified the campaign in behalf of his father Marduk. His own status was enhanced and changed: his own divinity was now glori - fied by a variety of venerating epithets. Inspired by Nabu— th e Nabih , the Prophet—prophecies of the Future, of what is about to happen, began to sweep the contested lands. We know what they said because a number of clay tablets o n which such prophecies were inscribed have been found; written in Old Babylonian cuneiform, they are grouped by scholars as Akkadian Prophecies or Akkadian Apocalypses. Common to all of them is the view that Past, Present, and Future are parts of a continuous flow of events; that within a preordained Destiny there is some room for free will and thus a variated Fate; that for Mankind, both were decreed or determined by the gods of Heaven and Earth; and that there - fore events on Earth reflect occurrences in the heavens. To grant the prophecies believability, the texts sometimes a nchored the prediction of future events in a known past his - toric occurrence or entity. What is wrong in the present, why c hange is needed, is then recounted. The unfolding events are attributed to decisions by one or more of the great gods . A divine Emissary, a Herald , will appear ; the prophetic text might be his words, written down by the scribe, or expected pronouncements; as often as not, “a son will speak for his father.” The predicted event(s) will be linked to omens—the death of a king, or heavenly signs: a celestial body will ap - pear and make a frightful sound; “a burning fire” will come f rom the skies; “a star shall flash from the height of the sky to the horizon as a torch;” and, most significantly, “a planet will appear before its time.” Bad things, Apocalypse, shall precede the final event.

Good will prevail over evil, prosperity will re - place sufferings; abandoned cities will be resettled, the rem nants of the dispersed people will return to their homes.

Not unexpectedly, these Babylonian or pro-Marduk proph - ecies pointed the accusing finger of wrongdoing at Sumer & A kkad (and also their allies Elam, Hattiland, and the Seal - ands), and named the Amurru Westerners as the instrument o f divine retribution. The Enlilite “cult centers” Nippur, Ur, Uruk, Larsa, Lagash, Sippar, and Adab are named; they will be attacked, plundered, their temples abandoned. The Enlilite gods are described as confused (“unable to sleep”). Enlil is calling out to Anu, but ignores Anu’s advice (some translators read the word as “command”) that Enlil issue a misharu edict—a “putting things straight” order. Enlil, Ishtar, and Adad will be forced to change kingship in Sumer & Akkad. The “sacred rites” will be transferred out of Nippur.

He wi ll establish the rites of Anu in Uruk.” The Igigi are also specifically mentioned: “The regular offerings for the Igigi gods, which had ceased, will be reestablished,” one prophecy states."},{"pageNumber":69,"pageContent":"62 THE END OF DAYS *** As was the case with Egyptian prophecies, most scholars a lso treat the “Akkadian Prophecies” as “pseudo-prophe- cies” or post aventum texts—that they were in fact written long after the “predicted” events; but as we have remarked in regard to the Egyptian texts, to say that the events were not prophesied because they had already happened is only to re - assert that the events per se did happen (whether or not they w ere predicted), and that is what matters most to us. It means that the prophecies did come true . And if so, most chilling is the prediction (in a text known as Pr ophecy “B” ): The Awesome Weapon of Erra upon the lands and the people will come in judgment. A most chilling prophecy indeed, for before the twenty- fi rst century b.c.e. was over, “judgment upon lands and peoples” occurred when the god Erra (“The Annihi- lator”)—an epithet for Nergal—unleashed nuclear weap - ons in a cataclysm that made prophecies come true."},{"pageNumber":70,"pageContent":"5 COUNTDOWN TO DOOMSDAY The disastrous twenty-first century b.c.e. began with the tragic and untimely death of Ur-Nammu, in 2096 b.c.e. It culminated with an unparalleled calamity, by the hand of the gods themselves, in 2024 b.c.e. The interval was seventy- two years—exactly the precessional shift of one degree; and if it was just a coincidence, then it was one of a series of “coincidental” occurrences that were somehow well coordi - nated . . . Following Ur-Nammu’s tragic death, the throne of Ur was t aken over by his son Shulgi. Unable to claim the status of a demigod, he asserted (in his inscriptions) that he was never - theless born under divine auspices: the god Nannar himself a rranged for the child to be conceived in Enlil’s temple in Nippur through a union between Ur-Nammu and Enlil’s high priestess, so that “a ‘little Enlil,’ a child suitable for kingship and throne, shall be conceived.” That was a genealogical claim not to be sneezed at. Ur- N ammu himself, as earlier stated, was “two-thirds” divine, since his mother was a goddess. Though the High Priestess who was Shulgi’s mother is not named, her very status sug - gests that she, too, was of some godly lineage, for it was a k ing’s daughter who was chosen to be an EN.TU; and the kings of Ur, starting with the first dynasty, could be traced back to demigods. That Nannar himself arranged for the union to take place in Enlil’s temple in Nippur was also significant; as previously stated, it was under Ur-Nammu’s reign that for the first time the priesthood of Nippur was combined with the priesthood of another city—in this case, with the one in Ur."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"64 THE END OF DAYS Much of what was happening in and around Sumer at the t ime has been gleaned from “Date Formulas”—royal records in which each year of the king’s reign was noted by the major event that year. In the case of Shulgi much more is known, for he left behind other short and long inscriptions, including poetry and love songs. These records indicate that soon after he had ascended the t hrone, Shulgi—perhaps hoping to avert his father’s fate on a battlefield—reversed his father’s militant policies. He launched an expedition to the outlying provinces, including the “rebel lands,” but his “weapons” were offers of trade, peace, and his daughters in marriage. Deeming himself a successor to Gilgamesh, his route embraced the two desti - nations of that famed hero: the Sinai peninsula (where the spa ceport was) in the south and the Landing Place in the north. Observing the sanctity of the Fourth Region, Shulgi skirted the peninsula and paid homage to the gods at its boundary, at a place described as “Great fortified place of the gods.” Moving northward west of the Dead Sea, he paused to worship at the “Place of Bright Oracles”—the place we know as Jerusalem—and built there an altar to “the god who judges” (usually an epithet of Utu/Shamash). At the “Snow-covered Place” in the north, he built an altar and of - fered sacrifices. Having thus “touched base” with the reach - able space-related sites, he followed the “Fertile C rescent”—the arching trade and migration east–west route dictated by geography and water sources—then continued southward in the Tigris-Euphrates plain, back to southern Sumer. When Shulgi returned to Ur, he had every reason to think t hat he had brought to gods and people alike “Peace in our time” (to use a modern analogy). He was granted by the gods the title “High Priest of Anu, Priest of Nannar.” He was be - friended by Utu/Shamash, and was given the personal atten - tion of Inanna/Ishtar (boasting in his love songs that she g ranted him her vulva in her temple). But while Shulgi turned from affairs of state to personal p leasures, the unrest in the “rebel lands” was continuing. Unprepared for military action, Shulgi asked his Elamite ally for troops, offering its king as a reward one of his daugh -"},{"pageNumber":72,"pageContent":"65 Countdown to Doomsday ters in marriage and the Sumerian city Larsa as dowry. A m ajor military expedition, employing those Elamite troops, was launched against the “sinning cities” in the west; the troops reached the Fortified Place of the gods at the Fourth Region’s boundary. Shulgi in his inscriptions boasted of vic - tory, but in fact, soon thereafter, he started to build a forti - fied wall to protect Sumer against foreign incursions from t he west and from the northwest. The Date Formulas called it the Great West Wall, and sc holars believe that it ran from the Euphrates to the Tigris rivers north of where Baghdad is situated nowadays, block - ing to invaders the way down the fertile plain between the t wo rivers. It was a defensive measure that preceded the Great Wall of China, which was built for similar reasons, by almost two thousand years! In 2048 b.c.e . the gods, led by Enlil, had enough of Shul- gi’s state failures and personal dolce vita. Determining that “the divine regulations he did not carry out,” they decreed for him “the death of a sinner.” We don’t know what kind of death it was, but it is a historic fact that in that year he was replaced on the throne of Ur by his son Amar-Sin, of whom we know from the inscriptions that he launched one military expedition after another—to quell a revolt in the north, to fight an alliance of five kings in the west. As in so much else, what was happening had root causes g oing back, sometimes way back, to earlier times and events. The “rebel lands,” though in Asia and thus domains in the Enlilite Lands of Noah’s son Shem, were inhabited by varied “Canaanites”—offspring of the biblical Canaan who, though descended of Ham (and thus belonging to Africa), occupied a stretch of Shem’s lands ( Genesis, Chapter 10). That the “Lands of the West” along the Mediterranean coast were somehow disputed territory was also indicated by ancient Egyptian texts regarding the bitter contest between Horus and Seth that ended in aerial battles between them over the Sinai and the same contested lands. It is noteworthy that in their military expeditions to sub - due and punish the “rebel lands” in the west, both Ur-Nammu a nd Shulgi reached the Sinai peninsula, but turned away"},{"pageNumber":73,"pageContent":"66 THE END OF DAYS from that Fourth Region without entering it. The prize there w as a place called TIL.MUN—the “Place of the Missiles”— the site of the post-Diluvial spaceport of the Anunnaki. When the Pyramid Wars ended, the sacred Fourth Region was en- trusted to the neutral hands of Ninmah (who was then re - named NIN.HAR.SAG—“Lady of the Mountain Peaks”), bu t actual command of the spaceport was put in the hands of Utu/Shamash (here shown in his winged dress uniform, Fig. 29 , commanding the spaceport’s “Eaglemen,” Fig. 30) . That, however, appeared to change as the struggle for su - premacy intensified. Inexplicably, various Sumerian texts a nd “God Lists” started to associate Tilmun with Marduk’s son, the god Ensag/Nabu. Enki was apparently involved in that, for a text dealing with the affair between Enki and Nin - harsag states that the two of them decided to allocate the p lace to Marduk’s son: “Let Ensag be the lord of Tilmun,” they said. The ancient sources indicate that from the safety of the sa cred region Nabu ventured to the lands and cities along the Mediterranean coast, even to some Mediterranean islands, spreading everywhere the message of Marduk’s coming su- Figure 29"},{"pageNumber":74,"pageContent":"67 Countdown to Doomsday Figure 30 premacy. He was, thus, the enigmatic “Son-Man” of the Egyptian and the Akkadian prophecies—the Divine Son who was also a Son-Man, the son of a god and of an Earth - ling woman. The Enlilites, understandably, could not accept such a sit - uation. And so it was that when Amar-Sin ascended the t hrone of Ur after Shulgi, the targets and strategy of the Ur III military expeditions were changed in order to reassert Enlilite control over Tilmun, to sever the sacred region from the “rebel lands,” then pry loose those lands from the influ - ence of Nabu and Marduk by force of arms. Starting in 2047 b.c.e . , the sacred Fourth Region became a target and a pawn in the Enlilite struggle with Marduk and Nabu; and as both biblical and Mesopotamian texts reveal, the conflict erupted to the greatest international “world war” of antiquity . In- volving the Hebrew Abraham, that “War of the Kings” place d him in center stage of international events. In 2048 b. c.e. the destiny of the founder of monothe - ism, Abraham, and the fate of the Anunnaki god Marduk con verged at a place called Harran. Harran —“ The Caravanry”—was an important trading cen - ter from time immemorial in Hatti (the land of the Hittites)."},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"68 THE END OF DAYS It was located at the crossroads of major international trade a nd military land routes. Situated at the headwaters of the Euphrates River, it was also a hub for river transportation all the way downstream to Ur itself. Surrounded by fertile meadows watered by the river’s tributaries, the Balikh and Khabur rivers, it was a center of sheepherding. The famed “Merchants of Ur” came there for Harran’s wool, and brought in exchange to distribute from there Ur’s famed woolen gar - ments. Commerce in metals, skins, leather, woods, earthen - ware products, and spices followed. (The Prophet Ezekiel, w ho was exiled from Jerusalem to the Khabur area in Baby - lonian times, mentioned Harran’s “merchants in choice fab - rics, embroidered cloaks of blue, and many-colored ca rpets.”) Harran (the town, by that very name, still exists in Turkey, nea r the border with Syria, and was visited by me in 1997) was also known in ancient times as “Ur away from Ur”; at its center stood a great temple to Nannar/Sin. In 2095 b.c.e. , the year in which Shulgi took over the throne in Ur, a priest named Terah was sent from Ur to Harran to serve at that temple. He took along his family; it included his son Abram. We know about Terah, his family, and their move from Ur to Harran from the Bible: Now these are the generationas of Terah: Terah begot Abram, Nahor and Haran, and Haran begot Lot. And Haran died before his father Terah in his land of birth, in Ur in Chaldea. And Abram and Nahor took wives— the wife of Abram was named Sarai and that of Nahor’s wife Milkhah . . . And Terah took with him his son Abram and Lot, the son of his son Haran, and his daughter-in-law Sarai, and went forth with them from Ur in Chaldea by the way to Canaan; and they reached Harran and resided there. Genesis 11: 27–31"},{"pageNumber":76,"pageContent":"69 Countdown to Doomsday It is with these verses that the Hebrew Bible begins the pi votal tale of Abraham—called at the beginning by his Su - merian name Abr am . His father, we are told earlier, stemmed from a patriarchal line that went all the way back to Shem, the oldest son of Noah (the hero of the Deluge); all those Pa - triarchs enjoyed long lives—Shem to the age of 600, his son A rpakhshad to 438; and subsequent male offspring to 433, 460, 239, and 230 years. Nahor, the father of Terah, lived to age l48; and Terah himself—who fathered Abram when he was seventy years old—lived to age 205. Chapter 11 of Gen - esis e xplains that Arpakhshad and his descendants lived in the lands later known as Sumer and Elam and their sur - roundings. S o Abraham, as Abram, was a true Sumerian. This genealogical information alone indicates that Abra - ham was of a special ancestry. His Sumerian name, AB. R AM, meant “Father’s Beloved,” an apropriate name for a son finally born to a seventy-year-old father. The father’s name, Terah, stemmed from the Sumerian epithet-name TIRHU; it designated an Oracle Priest—a priest who ob - served celestial signs or received oracular messages from a g od, and explained or conveyed them to the king. The name of Abram’s wife, SARAI (later Sarah in Hebrew), meant “Princess”; the name of Nahor’s wife, Milkhah , meant “Queen - like”; both suggest a royal genealogy. Since it was later re - vealed that Abraham’s wife was his half-sister—“the daughter o f my father but not of my mother,” he explained—it follows that Sarai/Sarah’s mother was of royal descent. The family thus belonged to Sumer’s highest echelons, combining royal and priestly ancestries. Another significant clue to identifying the family’s history is t he repeated reference by Abraham to himself, when he met rulers in Canaan and Egypt, as being an Ibri —a “Hebrew.” The word stems from the root ABoR —to come across, to cross—so it has been assumed by biblical scholars that by that he meant that he had come across from the other side of the Euphrates River, i.e., from Mesopotamia. But I believe that the term was more specific. The name used for Sumer’s “Vat - ican City,” Ni ppur , is the Akkadian rendering of the original Sumerian name NI.IBRU, “Splendid Place of Crossing.”"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"70 THE END OF DAYS Abram, and his descendants who are called in the Bible He - brews, belonged to a family that identified themselves as “ Ib ru ”—Nippurians. That would suggest that Terah was first a priest in Nippur, then moved to Ur, and finally to Harran, taking his family along. By synchronizing biblical, Sumerian, and Egyptian chro - nologies (as detailed in T he Wars of Gods and Men) , we have arrived at the year 2123 b.c.e. as the date of Abraham’s birth. The gods’ decision to make Nannar/Sin’s cult center Ur the capital of Sumer and to enthrone Ur-Nammu took place in 2113 b.c.e. Soon thereafter, the priesthoods of Nippur and Ur were combined for the first time; it is very likely that it was then that the Nippurian priest Tirhu moved with his family, including the ten-year-old boy Abram, to serve in Nannar’s temple in Ur. In 2095 b.c.e . , when Abraham was twenty-eight and al - ready married, Terah was transferred to Harran, taking the f amily with him. It could not have been just a coincidence that it was the very same year in which Shulgi succeeded Ur- Nammu. The emerging scenario is that the movements of this family were somehow linked to the geopolitical events of that era . Indeed, when Abraham himself was chosen to carry out divine orders to leave Harran and rush to Cannan , the great god Marduk took the crucial step of moving to Harran . It was in 2048 b.c.e. that the two moves occurred: Marduk coming to sojourn in Harran, Abraham leaving Harran for faraway Cannan. We k now f rom Ge nesis that Abram was seventy-five years old, and it was thus 2048 b.c.e. , that he was told by God, “Get thee out of thy country and out of thy birthplace and from thy father’s house”—leave behind Sumer, Nippur, and Harran—and go “unto the land which I will show thee.” As to Marduk, a long text known as the Marduk Prophecy that he addressed to the people of Harran (clay tablet, Fig. 31 ) provides the clue confirming the fact and the time of his move to Harran: 2048 b.c.e. There is no way the two moves could have been unrelated. But 2048 b.c.e . was also the very year in which the Enli - lite gods decided to get rid of Shulgi, ordering for him the"},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"71 Countdown to Doomsday Figure 31 “death of a sinner”—a move that signaled the end of “let’s try peaceful means” and a return to aggressive conflict; and there is no way that this, too, was just a coincidence. No, the three moves—Marduk to Harran, Abram leaving Harran for Canaan, and the removal of the decadent Shulgi—had to be interconnected: three simultaneous and interrelated moves in the Divine Chessgame. They were, as we shall see, steps in the countdown to Doo msday. The ensuing twenty-four years—from 2048 to 2024 b.c.e . — were a time of religious fervor and ferment, of international diplomacy and intrigue, of military alliances and clashing armies, of a struggle for strategic superiority. The spaceport in the Sinai peninsula, and the other space-related sites, were constantly at the core of events. Amazingly, various written records from antiquity have s urvived, providing us not just with an outline of events but with great details about the battles, the strategies, the discus- sions, the arguments, the participants and their moves, and"},{"pageNumber":79,"pageContent":"72 THE END OF DAYS the crucial decisions that resulted in the most profound up - heaval on Earth since the Deluge. Augmented by the Date Formulas and varied other refer - ences, the principal sources for reconstructing those dramatic e vents are the relevant chapters in Genesis ; Marduk’s autobi - ography, known as Th e Marduk Prophecy ; a group of tablets in the “Spartoli Collection” in the British Museum known as The Khedorla’omer Texts ; and a long historical/autobio- graphical text dictated by the god Nergal to a trusted scribe, a text known as the Erra Epos . As in a movie—usually a crime thriller—in which the various eyewitnesses and principals de - scribe the same event not exactly the same way, but from w hich the real story emerges, so are we able to reach the same result in this case. Marduk’s main chess move, in 2048 b.c.e. , w as to estab - lish his command post in Harran. By that he took away from N annar/Sin this vital northern crossroads and severed Sumer from the northern lands of the Hittites. Besides the military significance, the move deprived Sumer of its economically vital commercial ties. The move also enabled Nabu “to mar - shal his cities, toward the Great Sea to set his course.” Place na mes in these texts suggest that the principal cities west of the Euphrates River were coming under full or partial con - trol of the father–son team, including the all-important Land - ing Place. It was into the most populated part of the Lands of the W est—Canaan—that Abram/Abraham was commanded to go. He left Harran, taking his wife and nephew Lot with him. He was traveling swiftly southward, stopping only to pay homage to his God at selected sacred sites. His destination was the Negev, the dry region bordering the Sinai Peninsula. He did not stay there long. As soon as Shulgi’s successor, A mar-Sin, was enthroned in Ur in 2047 b.c.e. , Abram was instructed to go to Egypt. He was at once taken to meet the reigning Pharaoh, and was provided with “sheep and oxen and asses, and male attendants and female servants, and she- asses and camels.” The Bible is mum regarding the reason for this royal treatment, except to hint that the Pharaoh, be - ing told that Sarai was Abram’s sister, assumed that she was"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"73 Countdown to Doomsday being offered to him in marriage—a step that suggsts that a t reaty was discussed. That such high level international ne - gotiations were taking place between Abram and the Egyp - tian king seems plausible when one realizes that the year w hen Abram returned to the Negev after a seven-year stay in Egypt—2040 b.c.e. —was the very same year in which the Theban princes of Upper Egypt defeated the previous Lower Egypt dynasty, launching Egypt’s unified Middle Kingdom. Another geopolitical coincidence! Abram, now reinforced with manpower and camels, re - turned to the Negev in the nick of time, his mission now c lear: to defend the Fourth Region with its spaceport. As the biblical narrative reveals, he now had with him an elite force of Ne’arim —a term usually translated “Young Men”—but Mesopotamian texts used the parallel term LU.NAR (“NAR - men”) to denote armed cavalrymen. It is my suggestion that A braham, having learnt in Harran tactics from the militarily excelling Hittites, obtained in Egypt a striking force of swift camel-riding cavalrymen. His base in Canaan was again the Negev, the area bordering the Sinai Peninsula. He did so in the nick of time, for a mighty army—legions o f an alliance of Enlilite kings—was on its way not only to crush and punish the “sinning cities” that switched allegiance to “other gods,” but to also capture the spaceport. The Sumerian texts dealing with the reign of Amar-Sin, S hulgi’s son and successor, inform us that in 2041 b.c.e. he launched his greatest (and last) military expedition against the Lands of the West that fell under the Marduk-Nabu spell. It entailed an invasion of unparalleled scope by an interna - tional alliance, in which not only cities of men but also s trongholds of gods and their offspring were attacked. It was, indeed, such a major and unparalleled occurrence t hat the Bible devoted a whole long chapter to it— Genesis, Chapter 14. Biblical scholars call it “The War of the Kings,” for it climaxed in a great battle between an army of four “Kings of the East” and the combined forces of five “Kings of the West,” and culminated in a remarkable military feat by Abraham’s swift cavalrymen."},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"74 THE END OF DAYS The Bible begins its report of that great international war b y listing the kings and kingdoms of the East who “came and made war” in the West: And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shine’ar, Ariokh king of Ellasar, Khedorla’omer king of Elam, and Tidhal the king of Goyim. The group of tablets named the Khedorla’omer Texts w as first brought to scholarly attention by the Assyriologist Theophilus Pinches in a lecture at the Victoria Institute, London, in 1897. They clearly describe the same events that are the great international war of Chapter 14 of Genesis, though in much greater detail; it is quite possible, indeed, that those tablets served as the source for the biblical writers. Those tablets identify “Khedorla’omer king of Elam” as the Elamite king Kudur-Laghamar, who is known from histori - cal records. “Ariokh” has been identified as ERI.AKU (“Ser - vant of the Moon god”), who reigned in the city of Larsa ( biblical “Ellasar”); and Tidhal was identified as Tud-Ghula, a vassal of the king of Elam. There has been over the years a debate regarding the iden - tity of “Amraphel king of Shine’ar”; suggestions ranged all t he way to Hammurabi, a Babylonian king centuries later. Shine’ar was the constant biblical name for Sumer, not Baby - lon, so who, in the time of Abraham, was its king? I have c onvincingly suggested in The Wars of Gods and Men that the Hebrew should be read not Amra-Phel but Amar-Phel , from the Sumerian AMAR.PAL—a variant of AMAR.SIN— whose Date Formulas attest that he did indeed, in 2041 b.c.e. , launch the War of the Kings. That fully identified coalition, according to the Bible, w as led by the Elamites—a detail corroborated by the Mes - opotamian data that highlights the reemerging leading r ole of Ninurta in the struggle. The Bible also dates this Khedorla’omer Invasion by observing that it took place fourteen years after the previous Elamite incursion into"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"75 Countdown to Doomsday Canaan—another detail conforming to the data from Shul- gi ’s time. The invasion route this time was, however, different: shor tcutting the distance from Mesopotamia by a risky pas - sage through a stretch of desert, the invaders avoided the dense ly populated Mediterranean coastland by marching on the eastern side of the Jordan River. The Bible lists the places where those battles took place and who the Enlilite forces battled there; the information indicates that an attempt was made to settle accounts with old adversaries—descendants of the intermarrying Igigi, even of the Usurper Zu—who evidently supported the uprisings against the Enlilites. But sight was not lost of the prime target: the spaceport . The in - vading forces followed what has been known since biblical t imes as the Way of the King, running north–south on the eastern side of the Jordan. But when they turned westward toward the gateway to the Sinai Peninsula, they met a block - ing force: Abraham and his cavalrymen ( Fig. 32) . Referring to the Peninsula’s gateway city Dur-Mah-Ilani ( “The gods’ great fortified place”)—the Bible called it Kadesh-Barnea—the Khedorla’omer Texts clearly stated that the way was blocked there: The son of the priest, whom the gods in their true counsel had anointed, the despoiling had prevented. “The son of the priest,” anointed by the gods , I suggest, was Abram the son of the priest Terah. A Date Formula tablet belonging to Amar-Sin, inscribed on b oth sides (Fig. 33) , boasts of destroying NE IB.RU.UM— “The Shepherding place of Ibru’um .” In fact, at the gateway to the spaceport there was no battle; the mere presence of Abram’s cavalry striking force persuaded the invaders to turn away—to richer and more lucrative targets.

Looting the cities and taking captives with them, the invaders marched back, this time on the western side of the Jordan. The biblical focus on those battles might have ended with t hat turning back were it not for the fact that Abram’s nephew Lot, who resided in Sodom, was among the captives. When a refugee from Sodom told Abram what had happened, “he armed his trained men, three hundred and eighteen of them, and gave chase.” His cavalry caught up with the invaders all the way north, near Damascus (see Fig. 32), where Lot was freed and the booty recovered. The Bible records the feat as the “smiting of Khedorla’omer and the kings who were with him” by Abram. The historical records suggest that as audacious and far- f lung that War of the Kings had been, it failed to suppress the Marduk-Nabu surge.

The sad fact is that a mounting conflict—among gods, not men—did lead to the use of nuclear weapons, right there, four thousand years ago. And if there ever was a most regrettable act with the most unexpected consequences, that was it. That nuclear weapons had been used on Earth for the f irst time not in l945 A.D. but in 2024 b.c.e. is fact, not fiction. The fateful event is described in a variety of ancient texts from which the What and How, the Why and Who can be construed, reconstructed and put in context. Those an - cient sources include the Hebrew Bible, for the first Hebrew P atriarch, Abraham, was an eyewitness to the awesome ca - lamity. The failure of the War of the Kings to subdue the “rebel la nds” of course discouraged the Enlilites and encourged the Mardukites, but the events did more than that. On Enlil’s in - structions, Ninurta got busy setting up an alternative space fa - cility on the other side of the world—all the way in what is n ow Peru in South America. The texts indicate that Enlil him - self was away from Sumer for long stretches of time. These g ods’ moves caused the last two kings of Sumer, Shu-Sin and Ibbi-Sin, to waver in their allegiances and to start paying hom- age to Enki in his Sumerian foothold, Eridu. The divine ab - sences also loosened controls over the Elamite “Foreign L egion,” and the records speak of “sacrileges” by the Elamite troops. Gods and men were increasingly disgusted with it all."},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"80 THE END OF DAYS Especially enraged was Marduk, who received word of l ooting, destructions, and desecrations in his cherished Bab - ylon.

He d id so having received Nergal’s solemn word that nothing would be disturbed or desecrated in Babylon, but the oppo - site happened. Marduk was angered by the reported dese - cration of his temple there by the “unworthy” Elamites: “To herd s of dogs Babylon’s temple they made a den; flying ra - vens, loudly shrieking, their dung dropped there.” From Harran he cried out to the great gods: “Until When?” Ha s not the Time arrived yet, he asked in his prophetic auto - biography: O great gods, learn my secrets as I girdle my belt, my memories remember. I am the divine Marduk, a great god. I was cast off for my sins, to the mountains I have gone. In many lands I have been a wanderer. From where the sun rises to where it sets I went. To the highland of Hatti I came. In Hattiland I asked for an oracle; in it I asked: “Until when?” “Twenty-four years in Harran’s midst I nested,” Marduk w ent on; “my days are completed!” The time has come, he said, to set his course to his city (Babylon), “my temple to rebuild, my everlasting abode to establish.” Waxing vision- ary, he spoke of seeing his temple E.SAG.ILA (“Temple w hose head is lofty”) rising as a mountain upon a platform in Babylon, calling it “The house of my covenant.” He foresaw Babylon as forever established, a king of his choice installed there, a city filled with joy, a city blessed by Anu. The mes - sianic times, Marduk prophesied, will “chase away evil and ba d luck, bring motherly love to Mankind.” The year in which a sojourn of twenty-four years in Harran w as completed was 2024 b.c.e. ; it marked seventy-two years"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"81 Gone with the Wind since Marduk had agreed to depart from Babylon and await t he oracular celestial time. Marduk’s “until when?” appeal to the Great Gods was no t an idle one, for the leadership of the Anunnaki was con - stantly consulting, informally and in formal councils. A larmed by the worsening situation, Enlil hurriedly returned to Sumer, and was shocked to learn that things had gone wrong even in Nippur itself. Ninurta was summoned to ex - plain the Elamites’ misconduct, but Ninurta put all the blame on Ma rduk and Nabu. Nabu was summoned, and “Before the gods the son of his father came.” His main accuser was Utu/ Shamash, who, describing the dire situation, said, “all this Nabu has caused to happen.” Speaking for his father, Nabu blamed Ninurta, and revived the old accusations against Ner - gal in regard to the disappearance of the pre-Diluvial moni - toring instruments and the failure to prevent sacrileges in B abylon; he got into a shouting match with Nergal, and “showing disrespect . . . to Enlil evil he spoke: ‘There is no justice, destruction was conceived, Enlil against Babylon caused evil to be planned.’ ” It was an unheard-of accusation against the Lord of the Command. Enki spoke up, but it was in defense of his son, not of En lil. What are Marduk and Nabu actually accused of ? he asked. His ire was directed especially at his son Nergal: “Why do you continue the opposition?” he asked him. The two argued so much that in the end Enki shouted to Nergal to get out of his presence. The gods’ councils broke up in disarray. But all these debates, accusations, and counteraccusations w ere taking place against the increasingly realized fact— what Marduk referred to as the Celestial Oracle: with the passage of time—with the crucial shift of the precessional clock by one degree—the Age of the Bull, the zodiacal age of Enlil, was coming to an end, and the Age of the Ram, Marduk’s Age, was looming in the heavens. Ninurta could see it coming at his Eninnu temple in Lagash (which Gudea built); Ningishzidda/Thoth could confirm it from all the stone circles that he had erected elsewhere on Earth; and the people knew it, too."},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"82 THE END OF DAYS It was then that Nergal—vilified by Marduk and Nabu, ordere d out by his father Enki—“consulting with himself,” concocted the idea of resort to the “Awesome Weapons.” He did not know where they were hidden, but knew that they existed on Earth, locked away in a secret underground place (according to a text catalogued as CT-xvi, lines 44–46, some - where in Africa, in the domain of his brother Gibil): Those seven, in the mountains they abide; In a cavity inside the earth they dwell. Based on our current level of technology, they can be de - scribed as seven nuclear devices: “Clad with terror, with a br illiance they rush forth.” They were brought to Earth unin - tentionally from Nibiru and were hidden away in a secret sa fe place a long time ago; Enki knew where, but so did En- lil. A War Council of the gods, overruling Enki, voted to fol - low Nergal’s suggestion to give Marduk a punishing blow. T here was constant communication with Anu: “Anu to Earth the words was speaking, Earth to Anu the words pro - nounced.” He made it clear that his approval for the unprec - edented step was limited to depriving Marduk of the Sinai spa ceport, but that neither gods nor people should be harmed: “Anu, lord of the gods, on the Earth had pity,” the ancient records state. Choosing Nergal and Ninurta to carry out the mission, the gods made absolutely clear to them its limited and conditional scope. But that is not what happened: The “Law of Unintended Conse quences” proved itself true on a catastrophic scale. In the aftermath of the calamity that resulted in the death of cou ntless people and the desolation of Sumer, Nergal dictated to a trusted scribe his own version of the events, trying to ex - onerate himself. The long text is known as the Er ra Epos, for it refers to Nergal by the epithet Erra (“The Annihilator”) and to Ninurta as Ishum (“The Scorcher”). We can put together the true story by adding to this text information from several other Sumerian, Akkadian, and biblical sources."},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"83 Gone with the Wind Thus we find that no sooner was the decision reached than N ergal rushed to Gibil’s African domain to find and retrieve the weapons, not waiting for Ninurta. To his dismay Ninurta learnt that Nergal was disregarding the objective’s limits, and was going to use the weapons indiscriminately to settle personal accounts: “I shall annihilate the son, and let the fa- ther bury him; then I shall kill the father, and let no one bury h im,” Nergal has boasted. While the two argued, word reached them that Nabu was n ot sitting still: “From his temple to marshall all his cities he set his step, toward the Great Sea he set his course; the Great Sea he entered, sat upon a throne that was not his.” Nabu was not only converting the western cities, he was taking over the Mediterranean islands, and setting himself up as their ruler! Nergal/Erra thus argued that destroying the spaceport was not enough: Nabu, and the cities that rallied to him, also had to be punished, destroyed! Now, with two targets, the Nergal-Ninurta team saw an - other problem: Would the “upheavaling” of the spaceport not sou nd the alarm for Nabu and his sinning followers to escape? Reviewing their targets, they found the solution in splitting up: Ninurta would attack the spaceport; Nergal would attack the nearby “sinning cities.” But as all this was agreed upon, Ninurta had second thoughts; he insisted that not only the Anunnaki who manned the space facilities should be fore - warned, but that even certain people should be forewarned: “ Valiant Erra,” he told Nergal, “ will you the righteous destroy with the unrighteous? Will you destroy those who against you have not sinned with those who against you have sinned?” Nergal/Erra, the ancient text states, was persuaded: “The w ords of Ishum appealed to Erra as fine oil.” And so, one morning, the two, sharing the seven nuclear explosives be - tween them, set out on their ultimate Mission: Then did the hero Erra go ahead, remembering the words of Ishum. Ishum too went forth in accordance with the words given, a squeezing in his heart."},{"pageNumber":91,"pageContent":"84 THE END OF DAYS The available texts even tell us who went to what target: “ Ishum to the Mount Most Supreme set his course” (we know that the spaceport was beside this mount from the Epic of Gilgamesh). “Ishum raised his hand: the Mount was smashed . . . That which was raised toward Anu to launch was caused to wither, its face was made to fade away, its place was made desolate.” In one nuclear blow, the spaceport and its facilities were obliterated by the hand of Ninurta. The ancient text then describes what Nergal did: “Emulat - ing Ishum, Erra the Way of the King followed, the cities he f inished off, to desolation he overturned them”; his targets were the “sinning cities” whose kings had formed the alli - ance against the Kings of the East, the plain in the south of t he Dead Sea. And so it was that in the year 2024 b.c.e. n uclear weap - ons were unleashed in the Sinai Peninsula and in the ne arby Plain of the Dead Sea; and the spaceport and the Five Cities were no more. Amazingly, yet no wonder if Abraham and his mission in Ca naan is understood the way we explain it, it is in this apocalyptic event that the biblical record and the Mesopota - mian texts converge. We know from the Mesopotamian texts relating the events t hat, as required, the Anunnaki guarding the spaceport were forewarned: “The two [Nergal and Ninurta], incited to com - mit the evil, made its guardians stand aside; the gods of that p lace abandoned it—its protectors went up to the heights of heaven.” But while the Mesopotamian texts reiterate that “the two made the gods flee, made them flee the scorching,” they are ambiguous regarding whether that advance notice was also extended to the people in the doomed cities. It is here that the Bible provides missing details: we read in Gen - esis t hat both Abraham and his nephew Lot were indeed forewarned—but not the other residents of the “sinning cit - ies.” The biblical report, apart from throwing light on the “up - heavaling” aspects of the events, contains details that shed a n amazing light on the gods in general and on their relation -"},{"pageNumber":92,"pageContent":"85 Gone with the Wind ship with Abraham in particular. The story begins in Chapter 18 of Genesis when Abraham, now ninety-nine years old, sitting at the entrance to his tent on a hot midday, “lifted his eyes” and all of a sudden saw “three men standing above him.” Though they are described as Anashim , “men,” there was something different or unusual about them, for he rushed out of his tent and bowed to the ground, and—referring to himself as their servant—washed their feet and offered them food. As it turned out, the three were divine beings. As they leave, their leader—now identified as the Lord G od—decides to reveal to Abraham the trio’s mission: to de - termine whether Sodom and Gomorrah are indeed sinning ci ties whose upheavaling is justified. While two of the three continue toward Sodom, Abraham approaches and reproaches (!) God with words that are identical to those in the Mesopota - mian text: W ilt thou destroy the righteous with the unrigh - teous? ( Ge nesis 18: 23). What followed was an incredible bargaining session be - tween Man and God. “Perchance there are fifty righteous wi thin the city—Wilt thou destroy, and not spare the city on account of the fifty righteous within it?” Abraham asked God. When told that, well, the city would be spared if fifty righteous men reside there, Abraham said, what about just forty? What about only thirty? And so it went, down to ten . . . “And Yahweh went away as soon as he had finished speaking, and Abraham returned to his place.” The other two divine beings—the tale’s continuation in C hapter 19 calls them Mal’achim , literally “emissaries” but commonly translated “Angels”—arrived in Sodom in the evening. The happenings there confirmed its people’s wick - edness, and at daybreak the two urged Abraham’s nephew L ot to escape with his family, for “Yahweh is about to de - stroy the city.” The lingering family asked for more time, a nd one of the “angels” agreed to have the upheaval delayed long enough for Lot and his family to reach the safer moun - tain. “And Abraham got up early in the morning . . . and he lo oked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of the Plain, and beheld, and lo—vapor went up from the earth as the smoke of a furnace.”"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"86 THE END OF DAYS Abraham was then ninety-nine years old; having been b orn in 2123 b.c.e. , the time had to be 2024 b.c.e.

Those who question the Bible or treat the Mesopotamian texts as just myths have sought to explain the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah as some natural calamity, yet the biblical ver - sion confirms twice that the “upheaval” by “fire and sulfur” w as not a natural calamity but a premeditated, postponable and even cancellable event: once when Abraham bargained with The Lord to spare the cities so as not to destroy the righ - teous with the unjust, and again when his nephew Lot ob - tained a postponement of the upheaval. Photographs of the Sinai Peninsula from space ( Fig. 34) still show the immense cavity and the crack in the surface where the nuclear explosion had taken place.

It was, the reader will recall, the very year in which Abraham was ninety-nine years old . . . Scholars assumed at first that Sumer’s capital, Ur, was o verrun by “barbarian invaders”; but no evidence for such a destructive invasion was found. A text titled “A Lamentation Over the Destruction of Ur” was then discovered; it puzzled the scholars, for it bewailed not the physical destruction of Ur but its “abandonment”: the gods who had dwelt there abandoned it, the people who dwelt there were gone, its sta - bles were empty; the temples, the houses, the sheepfolds re - mained intact—standing, but empty. Other lamentation texts were then discovered. They la - mented not just Ur, but all of Sumer. Again they spoke of “ abandonment”: not only did the gods of Ur, Nannar, and Ningal abandon Ur; Enlil, “the wild bull,” abandoned his be - loved temple in Nippur; his spouse Ninlil was also gone. N inmah abandoned her city Kesh; Inanna, “the queen of Erech,” abandoned Erech; Ninurta forsook his temple Eninnu; his spouse Bau was also gone from Lagash. One Sumerian city after another was listed as having been “abandoned,” without their gods, people, or animals. The scholars were now puzzling over some “dire catastrophe,” a mysterious ca- lamity that affected the whole of Sumer. What could it be? The answer to the puzzle was right there in those texts: Gone with the wind. No, this is not a play of words on the title of a famous book/ mo vie. That was the refrain in the Lamentation Texts: Enlil has abandoned his temple, he was “gone by the wind.” Ninlil from her temple was “gone by the wind.” Nannar has aban - doned Ur—his sheepfolds were “gone by the wind”; and so on a nd on. The scholars have assumed that this repetition of the words was a literary device, a refrain that the lamenters re - peated over and over again to highlight their grief. But that w as no literary device—that was the literal truth: Sumer and its cities were literally emptied as a result of a wind. An “ Ev il Wind ,” the lamentation (and then other texts) re - ported, came blowing and caused “a calamity, one unknown"},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"90 THE END OF DAYS to men, to befall the land.” It was an Ev il Wind that “caused cities to be desolate, caused houses to be desolate, caused stalls to be desolate, the sheepfolds to be emptied.” There was desolation, but no destruction; emptiness, but no ruins: the cities were there, the houses were there, the stalls and sheepfolds were there—but nothing alive remained; even “Sumer’s rivers flow with water that is bitter, the once culti - vated fields grow weeds, in the meadows the plants have wi thered.” All life is gone. It was a calamity that had never happened before— On the Land Sumer a calamity fell, One unknown to men. One that had never been seen before, One which could not be withstood. Carried by the Evil Wind, it was a death from which there w as no escape: it was a death “which roams the street, is let loose in the road . . . The highest wall, the thickest wall, it passes like a flood; no door can shut it out, no bolt can turn it back.” Those who hid behind doors were felled inside; those who ran to the rooftops died on the roofs. It was an unseen death: “It stands beside a man, yet no one can see it; when it enters a house, its appearance is unknown.” It was a gruse - some death: “Cough and phlegm weakened the chest, the mou th was filled with spittle, dumbness and daze have come upon them . . . an overwhelming dumbness . . . a headache.” As the Evil Wind clutched its victims, “their mouths were drenched with blood.” The dead and dying were every - where. The texts make clear that the Evil Wind, “bearing gloom f rom city to city,” was not a natural calamity; it resulted from a deliberate decision of the great gods. It was caused by “a great storm ordered by Anu, a [decision] from the heart of Enlil.” And it was the result of a single event—“spawned in a single spawning, in a lightning flash”—an event that oc - curred far away in the west: “From the midst of the moun - tains it had come, from the Plain of No-Pity it had"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"91 Gone with the Wind come . . . Like a bitter venom of the gods, from the west it ha d come.” That the cause of the Evil Wind was the nuclear “up - heaval” back in and near the Sinai peninsula was made clear w hen the texts asserted that the gods knew its source and cause— a blast, an explosion : An evil blast heralded the baleful storm, An evil blast was its forerunner. Mighty offspring, valiant sons, were the heralds of the pestilence. The authors of the lamentation texts, the gods themselves, l eft us a vivid record of what had taken place. As soon as the Awesome Weapons were launched from the skies by Ninurta and Nergal, “they spread awesome rays, scorching every - thing like fire.” The resulting storm “in a flash of lightning w as created.” A “dense cloud that brings doom”—a nuclear “mushroom”—then rose to the sky, followed by “rushing wind gusts . . . a tempest that scorches the heavens.” It was a day not to be forgotten: On that day, When heaven was crushed and the Earth was smitten, its face obliterated by the maelstrom— When the skies were darkened and covered as with a shadow— On that day the Evil Wind was born. The various texts kept attributing the venomous maelstrom to t he explosion at the “place where the gods ascend and de- scend”—to the obliteration of the spaceport, rather than to the destruction of the “sinning cities.” It was there, “in the midst of the mountains,” that the nuclear mushroom cloud arose in a brilliant flash—and it was from there that the pre - vailing winds, coming from the Mediterranean Sea, carried t he poisonous nuclear cloud eastward, toward Sumer, and"},{"pageNumber":99,"pageContent":"92 THE END OF DAYS there it caused not destruction but a silent annihilation, bring - ing death by nuclear poisoned air to all that lives. It is evident from all the relevant texts that, with the pos - sible exception of Enki, who had protested and warned ag ainst the use of the Awesome Weapons, none of the gods involved expected the eventual outcome. Most of them were Earthborn, and to them the tales of the nuclear wars on Nib - iru were Tales of the Elders. Did Anu, who should have k nown better, think perhaps that the weapons, hidden so long ago, would hardly work or not work at all? Did Enlil and Ninurta (who had come from Nibiru) assume that the winds, if at all, would blow the nuclear cloud toward the desolate deserts that are now Arabia? There is no satisfactory answer; the texts only state that “the great gods paled at the storm’s immensity.” But it is clear that as soon as the direction of the winds and the intensity of the nuclear venom were realized, an alarm was sounded for those in the wind’s path—gods and people alike—to run for their lives. The panic, fear, and confusion that overtook Sumer and i ts cities as the alarm was sounded are vividly described in a series of lamentation texts, such as the Ur Lamentation , the Lamentation over the Desolation of Ur and Sumer , The Nippur Lamentation , The Uruk Lamentation , and others. As far as the gods were concerned, it appears that it was by and large “each man for himself ”; using their varied craft, they took off by air and by water to get out of the wind’s path. As for the people, the gods did sound the alarm before they fled. As described in The Uruk Lamentation , “Rise up! Run away! Hide in the steppe!” the people were told in the middle of the night. “Seized with terror, the loyal citizens of Uruk” ran for their lives, but they were felled by the Evil Wind anyway. The picture, though, was not identical everywhere. In Ur, t he capital, Nannar/Sin was so incredulous that he refused to believe that Ur’s fate has been sealed. His long and emo - tional appeal to his father Enlil to avert the calamity is re - corded in the Ur Lamentation ( which was composed by Ningal, Nannar’s spouse); so is Enlil’s blunt admission of inevitability:"},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"93 Gone with the Wind Ur was granted kingship— An eternal reign it was not granted . . . Unwilling to accept the inevitable and too devoted to the p eople of Ur to abandon them, Nannar and Ningal decided to stay put. It was daytime when the Evil Wind approached Ur; “of that day I still tremble,” Ningal wrote, “but of that day’s foul smell we did not flee.” As doomsday came, “a bitter la- ment was raised in Ur, but of its foulness we did not flee.” T he divine couple spent the night of nightmares in the “ter - mite house,” an underground chamber deep inside their zig - gurat. By morning, as the venomous wind “was carried off f rom the city,” Ningal realized that Nannar was ill. She hast - ily put on garments and had the god carried out and away f rom Ur, the city that they loved. At least another deity was also harmed by the Evil Wind; she w as Ninurta’s spouse Bau, who was alone in Lagash (for her husband was busy destroying the spaceport). Loved by the people, who called her “Mother Bau,” she was trained as a healing physician, and just could not force herself to leave. The lamentations record that “On that day, the storm caught up with the Lady Bau; as if she was a mortal, the storm caught up with her.” It is not clear how badly she was stricken, but subsequent records from Sumer suggest that she did not survive long thereafter. Eridu, Enki’s city, lying farthest to the south, was appar - ently at the edge of the Evil Wind’s path. We learn from Th e Eridu Lament that Ninki, Enki’s spouse, flew away from the city to a safe haven in Enki’s African Abzu: “Ninki, the Great Lady, flying like a bird, left her city.” But Enki himself de - parted from the city only far enough to get out of the Evil Wi nd’s way: “The Lord of Eridu stayed outside his city . . . for the fate of his city he wept with bitter tears.” Many of Eridu’s citizens followed him, camping in the fields at a safe dis - tance as they watched—for a day and a half—the storm “put i ts hand on Eridu.” Amazingly, the least affected of all the land’s major cen - ters was Babylon, for it lay beyond the storm’s northern edge. A s the alert was sounded, Marduk contacted his father to"},{"pageNumber":101,"pageContent":"94 THE END OF DAYS seek advice: What are the people of Babylon to do? he asked. T hose who can escape should go north, Enki told him; and in the manner of the two “Angels” who had advised Lot and his family not to look back when they fled Sodom, so did Enki instruct Marduk to tell his followers “neither to turn nor to look back.” If escape was not possible, the people should seek shelter underground: “Get them into a chamber below the earth, into a darkness,” was Enki’s advice. Following this advice, and due to the wind’s direction, Babylon and its peo - ple were unharmed. As the Evil Wind passed and blew away (its remnants, we l earn, reached the Zagros Mountains farther east), it left Sumer desolate and prostrate. “The storm desolated the cit - ies, desolated the houses.” The dead, lying where they fell, r emained unburied: “The dead people, like fat placed in the sun, of themselves melted away.” In the grazing lands, “cattle large and small became scarce, all living creatures came to an end.” The sheepfolds “were delivered to the Wind.” The cultivated fields withered; “on the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates only sickly weeds grew, in the swamps the reeds rotted in a stench.” “No one treads the highways, no one seeks out the roads.” “Oh Temple of Nannar in Ur, bitter is thy desolation!” the la mentation poems bewailed; “Oh Ningal whose land has perished, make thy heart like water!” The city has become a strange city, how can one now exist? The house has become a house of tears, it makes my heart like water. Ur and its temples have been delivered to the Wind.

Their research used radiological and chemical analysis of ancient dust layers from that period obtained from various Near Eastern sites, but primarily from the bottom of the Gulf of Oman; their conclusion was that an unusual climate change in the areas adjoining the Dead Sea gave rise to dust storms and that the dust—an unusual “atmospheric mineral dust”—was carried by the prevailing winds over southern Mesopotamia all the way beyond the Persian Gulf (Fig. 37) —the very pattern of Sumer’s Evil Wind!

The scientific journal Sc ience devoted its issue of 27 April 2001 to Paleoclimate worldwide.

It was, in almost all respects, truly a New Age, even the way we understand the term nowadays. Its greatest paradox was that while it made Man look to the heavens, it brought the gods of the heavens down to Earth. The changes that New Age has wrought affect us to this day. For Marduk the New Age was a wrong righted, an ambi - tion attained, prophecies fulfilled. The price paid—the deso - lation of Sumer, the flight of its gods, the decimation of its p eople—was not his doing. If anything, those who suffered were punished for obstructing Destiny. The unforeseen nu - clear storm, the Evil Wind, and its course that seemed selec - tively guided by an unseen hand only confirmed what the He avens proclaimed: the Age of Marduk, the Age of the Ram, has arrived. The change from the Age of the Bull to the Age of the R am was especially celebrated and marked in Marduk’s homeland, Egypt. Astronomical depictions of the heavens (such as at the Denderah temple, see Fig. 20) showed the constellation of the Ram as the focal point of the zodiacal cycle.

Both Marduk and Nabu survived the nuclear maelstrom un harmed. Although Nabu was personally targeted by Nergal/ Erra, he apparently hid on one of the Mediterranean islands and escaped harm. Subsequent texts indicate that he was given his own cult center in Mesopotamia called Borsippa, a new city situated near his father’s Babylon, but he continued to roam and be worshipped in his favorite Lands of the West. His veneration both there and in Mesopotamia is attested to by sacred places named in his honor—such as Mount Nebo near the Jordan River (where Moses later died)—and the theophoric royal names (such as Nabo-pol-assar, Nebo-chad- nezzar, and many others) by which famous kings of Babylon were called. And his name, as we have noted, became syn - onymous with “prophet” and prophecy throughout the an - cient Near East.

In his autobiographical text The Marduk Prophecy he envisioned the coming of a Messianic Time , when gods and men will recognize his supremacy, when peace shall replace war and abundance will banish suffering, when a king of his choice “will make Babylon the foremost” with the Esagil temple (as its name meant) raising its head to heaven— A king in Babylon will arise; In my city Babylon, in its midst, my temple to heaven he will raise; The mountainlike Esagil he will renew, the ground plan of Heaven-Earth for the mountainlike Esagil he will draw; The Gate of Heaven will be opened. In my city Babylon a king will arise; In abundance he will reside; My hand he will grasp, He will lead me in processions . . . To my city and my temple Esagil for eternity I shall enter. That new Tower of Babel, however, was not intended (as t he first one was) as a launch tower. His supremacy, Marduk recognized, was now stemming not only from the posses - sion of a physical space connection but from the Signs of He aven—from the zodiacal Celestial Time, from the posi - tion and movement of the celestial bodies, the Ka kkabu (stars/planets) of heaven. Accordingly, he envisioned the future Esagil as the reign - ing astronomical observatory, making redundant Ninurta’s En innu and the varied stonehenges erected by Thoth. When the Esagil was eventually built, it was a ziggurat erected ac - cording to detailed and precise plans (F ig. 40) : its height, the spacing of its seven stages, and its orientation were such that its head pointed directly to the star Iku —the lead star of the constellation of the Ram—circa 1960 b.c.e.

Left and right, on opposite sides, they shall separately stand.

The god—Marduk—be- c ame a star; a star (we call it planet)—Nibiru—became “Marduk.” Religion became Astronomy, Astronomy be - came Astrology. In conformity with the new Star Religion, the Epic of Cre - ation, E numa Elish , was revised in its Babylonian version so as to grant Marduk a celestial dimension: he did not just come from Nibiru—he was Nibiru. Written in “Babylonian,” a dialect of Akkadian (the Semitic mother language), it equated Marduk with Nibiru, the home planet of the Anun - naki, and gave the name “Marduk” to the Great Star/Planet t hat had come from deep space to avenge both the celestial Ea and the one on Earth (Fig. 41) . It thus made “Marduk” the “Lord” in Heaven as on Earth. His Destiny—in the heavens, his orbit—was the greatest of all the celestial gods (the other planets) (see Fig. 1); paralleling that, he was destined to be the greatest of the Anunnaki gods on Earth. The revised Epic of Creation was read publicly on the f ourth night of the New Year festival. It credited Marduk with the defeat of the “monster” Tiamat in the Celestial Bat - tle, the creation of the Earth ( Fig. 42) , and the reshaping of the Solar system (Fig. 43) —all the feats that in the original Figure 41"},{"pageNumber":110,"pageContent":"103 Destiny Had Fifty Names Figure 42 Sumerian version were attributed to the planet Nibiru as part of a sophisticated scientific cosmogony. The new version then credited Marduk even with the “artful fashioning” of “Man,” with devising the calendar, and with the selection of Babylon to be the “Navel of the Earth.” The New Year festival—the most important religious e vent of the year—began on the first day of the month Nis- san, coinciding with the Spring Equinox. Calling it in Baby - lon the Akiti f estival, it evolved there into a twelve-day-long celebration from the Sumerian ten-day A.KI.TI (“On Earth Bring Life”) festival. It was conducted according to elabo - rately defined ceremonies and prescribed rituals that reen - acted (in Sumer) the tale of Nibiru and the coming of the A nunnaki to Earth, as well as (in Babylon) the life story of Marduk.

(The New Testament’s Jesus story was so"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"105 Destiny Had Fifty Names similar that scholars and theologians in Europe debated a c entury ago whether Marduk was the “Prototype Jesus . ” ) The ceremonies consisted of two parts. The first involved a so litary boat ride by Marduk upon and across the river, to a structure called Bit Akiti (“House of Akiti”); the other took place within the city itself. It is evident that the solitary part symbolized Marduk’s celestial travel from the home planet’s outer location in space to the inner solar system—a journey in a boat upon waters, in conformity with the concept that interplanetary space was a primeval “Watery Deep” to be traversed by “celestial boats” (spacecraft)—a concept repre - sented graphically in Egyptian art, where the celestial gods w ere depicted as coursing in the skies in “celestial barques” (Fig. 44) . It was upon Marduk’s successful return from the outer and l onely Bit Akiti that the public festivities began. Those pub - lic and joyous ceremonies started with the greeting of Mar - duk at the wharf by other gods, and his accompaniment by t he king and priests in a Sacred Procession, attended by ever- larger crowds. The descriptions of the procession and its route were so detailed that they guided the archaeologists who ex - cavated ancient Babylon. From the texts inscribed on clay t ablets and from the unearthed topography of the city, it emerged that there were seven stations at which the sacred procession made stops for prescribed rituals. The stations bore both Sumerian and Akkadian names and symbolized Figure 44"},{"pageNumber":113,"pageContent":"106 THE END OF DAYS (in Sumer) the travels of the Anunnaki within the solar sys - tem (from Pluto to Earth, the seventh planet), and (in Baby - lon) the “stations” in Marduk’s life story: his divine birth in t he “Pure Place”; how his birthright, his entitlement to su - premacy, was denied; how he was sentenced to death; how he w as buried (alive, in the Great Pyramid); how he was rescued and resurrected; how he was banished and went into exile; and how in the end even the great gods, Anu and Enlil, bowed to destiny and proclaimed him supreme. The original Sumerian Epic of Creation extended over six t ablets (paralleled by the biblical six days of creation). In the Bible, God rested on the seventh day, using it to review His handiwork. The Babylonian revision of the Epic culminated with the addition of a seventh tablet that was entirely devoted to the glorification of Marduk by the granting to him of fifty names—an act that symbolized the assumption by him of the Rank of Fifty that was until then Enlil’s (and to which Nin- urta had been in line). Starting with his traditional name MAR.DUK, “son of the P ure Place,” the names—alternating between Sumerian and Akkadian—granted him epithets that ranged from “Creator of All” to “Lord who fashioned Heaven and Earth” and other titles relating to the celestial battle with Tiamat and the cre - ation of the Earth and the Moon: “Foremost of all the gods,” “ Allotter of tasks to the Igigi and the Anunnaki” and their Commander, “The god who maintains life . . . the god who revives the dead,” “Lord of all the lands,” the god whose de - cisions and benevolence sustain Mankind, the people he had f ashioned, “Bestower of cultivation,” who causes rains to enrich the crops, allocates fields, and “heaps abundance” for gods and people alike. Finally, he was granted the name NIBIRU, “He who shall ho ld the Crossing of Heaven and Earth”: The Ka kkabu which in the skies is brilliant . . . He who the Watery Deep ceaselessly courses— Let “Crossing” be his name!

When the nightlong reading of the seven tablets was com- p leted—it probably was dawn by then—the priests who conducted the ritual service made the following prescribed pronouncements: Let the Fifty Names be kept in mind . . . Let the wise and knowing discuss them. Let the father recite them to his son, Let the ears of shepherds and herdsmen be opened. Let them rejoice in Marduk, the “Enlil” of the gods, whose order is firm, whose command is unalterable; The utterance of his mouth no god can change. When Marduk appeared in sight of the people, he was d ressed in magnificent vestments that put to shame the sim - ple wool garments of the olden gods of Sumer & Akkad ( Fig. 45) .

According to these expressions of faith, on Earth, in Egypt, R a/Marduk was an unseen god because his main abode was elsewhere—one long hymn actually referred to Babylon as the place where the gods are in jubilation for his victory (scholars, though, assume the reference is not to the Mesopo - tamian Babylon, but to a town by that name in Egypt). In the hea vens he was unseen, because “he is far away in heaven,” because he went “to the rear of the horizons . . . to the height of heaven.” Egypt’s reigning symbol—a Winged Disc usu - ally flanked by serpents—is commonly explained as a Sun d isc “because Ra was the Sun”; but, in fact, it was the ancient world’s ubiquitous symbol of Nibiru (Fig. 46) , and it was Nibiru that has become a distant unseen “star.” Because Ra/Marduk was physically absent from Egypt, it w as in Egypt that his Star Religion was expressed in its clearest form. There, Aten , the “Star of Millions of Years” representing Ra/Marduk in his celestial aspect, became The Unseen because it was “far away in heaven,” because it had gone “to the rear of the horizon.” The transition to Marduk’s New Age and new religion was not so s mooth in the Enlilite lands. First, southern Mesopo - tamia and the western lands that were in the path of the poi - sonous wind had to recover from its impact.

And so it was possible for people to slowly repopulate and reinhabit the desolated land. The first recorded administrative ruler in the devastated sou th was an ex-governor of Mari, a city way northwest on the Euphrates River. We learn that “he was not of Sumerian seed”; his name, Ishbi-Erra, was in fact a Semitic name. He established his headquarters in the city of Isin, and from there he oversaw the efforts to resurrect the other major cit - ies, but the process was slow, difficult, and at times chaotic. H is efforts at rehabilitation were continued by several suc- cessors, also bearing Semitic names, the so-called “Dy - nasty of Isin.” All together, it took them close to a century to re vive Ur, Sumer’s economic center, and ultimately Nip - pur, the land’s traditional religious heart; but by then that"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"110 THE END OF DAYS city-at-a-time process ran into challenges from other local ci ty rulers, and the erstwhile Sumer remained fragmented and a broken land. Even Babylon itself, though outside the Evil Wind’s direct pat h, needed a revived and repopulated country if it was to rise to imperial size and status, and it did not attain the gran- deur of Marduk’s prophecies for quite some time. More than a c entury had to pass until a formal dynasty, called by schol - ars the First Dynasty of Babylon, was installed on its throne (c i rca 190 0 b.c.e. ). Yet another century had to pass until a king who lived up to the prophesied greatness sat on Baby- lon’s throne; his name was Hammurabi. He is mostly known for the code of laws proclaimed by him—laws recorded on a stone stela that archaeologists have discovered (and that is now in the Louvre in Paris). It still took some two centuries before Marduk’s prophetic v ision regarding Babylon could come true. The meager evi - dence from the postcalamity time—some scholars refer to t he period following the demise of Ur as a Dark Age in Mesopotamian history—suggests that Marduk let the other gods—even his adversaries—take care of the recovery and repopulation of their own olden cult centers, but it is doubtful that they took up his invitation. The recovery and rebuilding that were started by Ishbi-Erra began at Ur, but there is no mention of Nannar/Sin and Ningal returning to Ur. There is mention of Ninurta’s occasional presence in Sumer, espe - cially in regard to its garrisoning by troops from Elam and Gu tium, but there is no record that he or his spouse Bau ever returned to their beloved Lagash. The efforts by Ishbi-Erra and his successors to restore the cult centers and their tem - ples culminated—after the passage of seventy-two years—at N ippur, but there is no mention that Enlil and Ninlil resumed residence there. Where had they gone? One avenue of exploring that in- triguing subject was to ascertain what Marduk himself—now s upreme and claiming to be the giver of commands to all the Anunnaki—had planned for them. The textual and other evidence from that time show that Ma rduk’s rise to supremacy did not end polytheism—the re -"},{"pageNumber":118,"pageContent":"111 Destiny Had Fifty Names ligious beliefs in many gods. On the contrary, his supremacy re quired continued polytheism, for to be supreme over other gods, the existence of other gods was necessary. He was sat - isfied to let them be, as long as their prerogatives were sub - ject to his control; a Babylonian tablet recorded (in its u ndamaged portion) the following list of divine attributes that were henceforth vested in Marduk: Ninurta is Marduk of the hoe Nergal is Marduk of the attack Zababa is Marduk of the combat Enlil is Marduk of lordship and counsel Sin is Marduk the illuminator of the night Shamash is Marduk of justice Adad is Marduk of rains The other gods remained, their attributes remained—but t hey now held attributes of Marduk that he granted to them. He let their worship be continued; the very name of the in - terim ruler/administrator in the south, Ishbi- Er ra (“Priest of Erra,” i.e., of Nergal) confirms this tolerant policy. But what Marduk expected was that they come and stay with him in his envisaged Babylon—prisoners in golden cages, one may say. In his autobiographical P rophecies Marduk clearly indi - cated his intentions in regard to the other gods, including his a dversaries: they were to come and reside next to him, in Babylon’s sacred precinct. Sanctuaries or pavilions for Sin and Ningal, where they would reside—“together with their treasures and possessions”!—are specifically mentioned. Texts describing Babylon, and archaeological excavations there, show that in accordance with Marduk’s wishes, Baby- lon’s sacred precinct also included residence-shrines dedi - cated to Ninmah, Adad, Shamas, and even Ninurta. When Babylon finally rose to imperial power—under Ha mmurabi—its ziggurat-temple indeed reached skyward; the prophesied great king in time did sit on its throne; but to its priest-filled sacred precinct, the other gods did not flock. That manifestation of the New Religion did not come about."},{"pageNumber":119,"pageContent":"112 THE END OF DAYS Figure 47 Looking at the Hammurabi stela recording his law code (Fig. 47) , we see him receiving the laws from none other than Utu/Shamash—the very one, according to the above- quoted list, whose prerogatives as God of Justice now be - longed to Marduk; and the preamble inscribed on the stela i nvoked Anu and Enlil —the one whose “Lordship and Coun - sel” were presumably taken over by Marduk—as the gods to w hom Marduk was beholden for his status: Lofty Anu, Lord of the gods who from heaven to Earth came, and Enlil, Lord of Heaven and Earth who determines the Land’s destinies, Determined for Marduk, the firstborn of Enki, the Enlil-functions over all mankind. These acknowledgments of the continued empowerment of En lilite gods, two centuries after the Age of Marduk began, reflect the actual state of affairs: They did not come to retire in Marduk’s sacred precinct. Dispersed away from Sumer, some accompanied their followers to far lands in the four corners of the Earth; others remained nearby, rallying their followers, old and new, to a renewed challenge to Marduk."},{"pageNumber":120,"pageContent":"113 Destiny Had Fifty Names The sense that Sumer as a homeland was no more is clearly e xpressed in the divine instructions to Abram of Nippur—on the eve of the nuclear upheavaling—to “Semitize” his name to Abraham (and that of his wife Sarai to Sarah), and to make his permanent home in Cannan. Abraham and his wife were not the only Sumerians in need of a new refuge. The nuclear calamity triggered migrational movements on a scale un - known before. The first wave of people was away fr om the affected lands; its most significant aspect, and one with the most lasting effects, was the dispersal of Sumer’s remnants away from Sumer. The next wave of migrants was into that abandoned land, coming in waves from all directions. Whichever direction those migration waves took, the fruits of two thousand years of Sumerian civilization were adopted by the other peoples that followed them in the next two mil - lennia. Indeed, though Sumer as a physical entity was c rushed, the attainments of its civilization are still with us to this day—just look up your twelve-month calendar, check the time on your watch that retained the Sumerian sexagesimal (“base sixty”) system, or drive in your contraption on wheels (a ca r). The evidence for a widespread Sumerian diaspora with its l anguage, writing, symbols, customs, celestial knowledge, be - liefs, and gods comes in many forms. Beside the generali- t ies—a religion based on a pantheon of gods who have come from the heavens, a divine hierarchy, god epithet-names that mean the same in the different languages, astronomical knowl - edge that included a home planet of the gods, a zodiac with its t welve houses, virtually identical creation tales, and memories of gods and demigods that scholars treat as “myths”—there are a host of astounding specific similarities that cannot be explained other than by an actual presence of Sumerians. It was expressed in the spread in Europe of Ninurta’s Double- Eagle symbol ( Fig. 48 ); the fact that three European lan- guages—Hungarian, Finnish, and Basque—are akin only to Sumerian; and the widespread depiction throughout the world—even in South America—of Gilgamesh fighting off with bare hands two ferocious lions ( Fig. 49 ). In the Far East, there is the clear similarity between the"},{"pageNumber":121,"pageContent":"114 THE END OF DAYS Figure 48 Sumerian cuneiform writing and the scripts of China, Korea, and Japan. The similarity is not only in the script: many similar glyphs are identically pronounced and also have the same meanings. In Japan, civilization has beeen attributed to an enigmatic forefather-tribe called AINU. The emperor’s family has been deemed to be a line of demigods descended from the Sun-god, and the investiture ceremonies of a new king include a secret solitary nightly stay with the Sun god- dess—a ritual ceremony that uncannily emulates the Sacred Marriage rites in ancient Sumer, when the new king spent a night with Inanna/Ishtar. In the erstwhile Four Regions, the migratory waves of di - verse peoples triggered by the nuclear calamity and Marduk’s N ew Age, much like flowing and overflowing rivers and rivulets after stormy rains, filled the pages of the ensuing centuries with the rise and fall of nations, states, and city- states. Into the Sumerian void, newcomers came in from near and far; their arena, their central stage, remained what can rightly be called the Lands of the Bible. Indeed, until the advent of modern archaeology, little or nothing was known about most of them except for their mention in the Hebrew Bible; it provided not only a record of those various peoples, but also of their “national gods”—and of the wars fought in the name of those gods.

Significantly, the resistance came n ot so much from the dispersed Enlilite gods but from the people, the masses of their loyal worshippers! More than a century had to pass from the time of the nuclear ordea l until Babylon (the city) emerged on the stage of history as Babylonia (the state) under its First Dynasty. During that interval southern Mesopotamia—the Sumer of old—was left to recover in the hands of temporary rulers headquartered in Isin and then in Larsa; their theophoric names—Lipit- Ishtar , Ur- Ninurta , Rim- Sin , Enlil -Bani—flaunted their Enlilite loy - alties.

It was done, Hammurabi boasted in his annals, “through the mighty power of Marduk.” After the fall of Mari, chieftains from the “Sealands”— S umer’s marshy areas bordering the Lower Sea (Persian Gulf)—conducted raids northward, and took from time to time control of the sacred city of Nippur. But those were temporary gains, and Hammurabi was certain that his van- quishing of Mari completed Babylon’s political and religious do mination of the old Sumer & Akkad. The dynasty to which he belonged, named by scholars the First Dynasty of Baby - lon, began a century before him and continued through his desc endants for another two centuries. In those turbulent times, it was quite an achievement. Historians and theologians agreee that in 17 60 b.c.e. Hammurabi, calling himself “King of the Four Quarters,” “put Babylon on the world map” and launched Marduk’s distinct Star Religion. When Babylon’s political and military supremacy was thus es tablished, it was time to assert and aggrandize its religious domination.

When archaeologists excavated Babylon, they found not only the city’s remains but also “architectural tablets” describing and mapping out the city; though many of the structures are remains from later times, this artist’s conception of the sa - cred precinct’s center ( Fig. 52) gives a good idea of Marduk’s magnificent headquarters. As befits a “Vatican,” the sacred precinct was also filled wi th an impressive array of priests whose religious, cere - monial, administrative, political, and menial tasks can be gl eaned from their varied groupings, classifications, and des - ignations. At the bottom of the hierarchy were the service personnel, th e Abalu —“Porters”—who clean-swept the temple and ad - joining buildings, provided the tools and utensils that the other pr iests required, and acted as general supply and warehous - ing personnel—except for woollen yarns, which were en - trusted only to the Shu’uru pr iests.

Other priestesses acted as profes - sional bewailers in funerals; the Bak ate knew how to shed bitter tears. And then there were the Shangu —simply “the priests”—who oversaw the overall functioning of the temple, the smooth performance of its rituals, and the receiving and handling of the offerings, or who were responsible for the gods’ clothes; and so on and on. The provision of personal “butlering” services to the resi - dent gods was handled by a small, specially selected elite g roup of priests. There were the Ramaqu who handled the purification-by-water rituals (honored with bathing the god), and the Nisaku who poured out the used water. The anoint - ing of the god with “Sacred Oil”—a delicate mixture of s pecific aromatic oils—was placed in specialized hands, starting with the Abaraku who mixed the ointments, and in - cluded the Pashishu w ho performed the anointing (in the case of a goddess the priests were all eunuchs). Then there were altogether other priests and priestesses, including the Sacred Choir—the Naru who sang, the Lallaru who were singers and musicians, and the Munabu whose specialty was lamen- tations. In each group there was the Ra bu —the Chief, the one in charge. As envisaged by Marduk, once his Esagil ziggurat-temple w as raised heavenward, its main function was to constantly observe the heavens; and indeed, the most important seg - ment of temple priests were those whose task it was to ob - serve the heavens, track the movement of stars and planets, re cord special phenomena (such as a planetary conjunction or an eclipse), and consider whether the heavens bespoke omens; and if so, to interpret what they did portend. The astronomer-priests, generally called M ashmashu , in - cluded diverse specialties; a Ka lu priest, for example, spe - cialized in watching the Constellation of the Bull. It was the d uty of the Lagaru to keep a detailed daily record of the celestial observations, and to convey the information to a cadre of interpreter-priests. These—making up the top priestly hierarchy—included the Ashippu , Omen specialists,"},{"pageNumber":129,"pageContent":"122 THE END OF DAYS the Ma hhu “who could read the signs,” and the Baru — “Truth-tellers”—who “understood mysteries and divine signs.” A special priest, the Zaqiqu , was charged with con- veying the divine words to the king. Then at the head of t hose astronomer-astrologer priests was the Urigallu , the Great Priest, who was a holy man, a magician, and a physi - cian, whose white vestments were elaborately color-trimmed at t he hems. The discovery of some seventy tablets that formed a con - tinuous series of observations and their meaning, named a fter the opening words Enuma Anu Enlil , revealed both the transition from Sumerian astronomy and the existence of oracular formulas that dictated what a phenomenon meant. In time a host of diviners, dream interpreters, fortune-tell- ers, and the like joined the hierarchy, but they were in the king’s rather than the gods’ service. In time the celestial observations degraded to astrological omens for king and country—predicting war, tranquility, overthrows, long life or death, abundance or pestilences, divine blessings or godly wrath. But in the beginning the celestial observations were purely astronomical and were of prime interest to the god— Marduk—and only derivatively to king and people. It was not by chance that a Kalu priest specialized in w atching Enlil’s Constellation of the Bull for any untoward phenomena, for the main purpose of the Esagil-as-observa- tory was to track the heavens zodiacally and keep an eye on Celestial Time. The fact that significant events prior to the nuclear blast happened in seventy-two-year intervals, and continued to do so afterward (see above and earlier chapters), suggests that the zodiacal clock, in which it took seventy-two years for a Precessional shift of one degree, continued to be observed and adhered to. It is clear from all the astronomical (and astrological) texts f rom Babylon that its astronomer-priests retained the Sume - rian division of the heavens into three Ways or paths, each o ccupying sixty degrees of the celestial arc: the Way of Enlil for the northern skies, the Way of Ea for the southern skies, and the Way of Anu as the central band (Fig. 53) . It was in"},{"pageNumber":130,"pageContent":"123 In the Name of God Figure 53 the latter that the zodiacal constellations were located, and it was there that “Earth met Heaven”—at the horizon. Perhaps because Marduk attained supremacy in accordance wi th Celestial Time, the zodiacal clock, his astronomer-priests continuously scanned the skies at the horizon, the Sumerian AN.UR, “Heaven’s Base.” There was no point in looking up to the Sumerian AN.PA, “Heaven’s Top,” the zenith, for Marduk as a “star,” Nibiru, was by then gone and unseen. But as an orbiting planet, though unseen now, it was bound to ret urn. Expressing its equivalent of the Marduk-is-Nibiru theme, the Egyptian version of Marduk’s Star-Religion openly promised its faithful that a time will come when this god-star or star-god would reappear as the ATEN. It was this aspect of Marduk’s Star Religion—the eventual R eturn—that directly challenged Babylon’s Enlilite adver - saries, and shifted the conflict’s focus to renewed messianic e xpectations. Of the post-Sumer actors on the stage of the Old World, four t hat grew to imperial status left the deepest imprint on his - tory: Egypt and Babylonia, Assyria and Hatti (the land of the H ittites); and each one had its “national god.”"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"124 THE END OF DAYS The first two belonged to the Enki-Marduk-Nabu camp; t he other two were beholden to Enlil, Ninurta, and Adad. Their national gods were called Ra-Amon and Bel/Marduk, Ashur and Teshub, and it was in the name of those gods that constant, prolonged, and cruel wars were fought. The wars, historians may explain, were caused by the usual reasons for war: resources, territory, need, or greed; but the royal annals that detailed the wars and military expeditions presented them as religious wars in which one’s god was glorified and the opposite deity humiliated. However, the looming expecta - tions of the Return turned those wars to te rritorial cam - paigns t hat had specific sites as their targets. The wars, according to the royal annals of all those lands, w ere launched by the king “on the command of my god” so- and-so; the campaign was carried out “in accordance with an oracle” from this or that god; and as often as not, victory was attained with the help of unopposable weapons or other di - rect help provided by the god. An Egyptian king wrote in his w ar records that it was “Ra who loves me, Amon who favors me,” who instructed him to march “against these enemies whom Ra abominates.” An Assyrian king, recording the de - feat of an enemy king, boasted that he replaced in the city’s t emple the images of the city’s gods “with the images of my gods, and declared them to be henceforth the gods of the country.” A clear example of the religious aspect of those wars—and t he deliberate choice of targets—can be found in the Hebrew Bible, in 2 Kings Chapters 18–19, in which the siege of Jeru - salem by the army of the Assyrian king Sennacherib is de - scribed. Having surrounded and cut off the city, the Assyrian co mmander engaged in psychological warfare in order to get the city’s defenders to surrender. Speaking in Hebrew so that all on the city’s walls could understand, he shouted to them the words of the king of Assyria: Don’t be deceived by your leaders that your god Yahweh will protect you; “Has any of the gods of the nations ever rescued their lands from the hand of the king of Ashur?

The wars, and the nat ional gods in whose name they were fought, don’t make sense except when one realizes that at the core of the con - flicts was what the Sumerian had called DUR.AN.KI—the “ Bond Heaven-Earth.” Repeatedly, the ancient texts spoke of the catastrophe “when Earth was separated from Heaven”— when the spaceport connecting them was destroyed. The overwhelming question in the aftermath of the nuclear ca - lamity was this: Who—which god and his nation—could cla im to be the one on Earth who now possessed the link to the Heavens? For the gods, the destruction of the spaceport in the Sinai p eninsula was a material loss of a facility that required re - placement. But can one imagine the impact—the spiritual a nd religious impact—on Mankind? All of a sudden, the worshipped gods of Heaven and Earth were cut off from Heaven . . . With the spaceport in the Sinai now obliterated, only three spa ce-related sites remained in the Old World: the Landing Place in the cedar mountains; the post-Diluvial Mission Con - trol Center that replaced Nippur; and the Great Pyramids in E gypt that anchored the Landing Corridor. With the destruc- tion of the spaceport, did those other sites still have a useful c elestial function—and thus also a religious significance? We know the answer, to some extent, because all three si tes still stand on Earth, challenging mankind by their mysteries and the gods by facing upward to the heavens. The most familiar of the three is the Great Pyramid and its co mpanions in Giza (Fig. 54) ; its size, geometric precision, inner complexity, celestial alignments, and other amazing aspects have long cast doubt on the attribution of its con- struction to a Pharaoh named Cheops—an attribution sup - ported solely by a discovery of a hieroglyph of his name i nside the pyramid.

So, with and then without the spaceport, the Landing Place continued to be operative. The place, Ba’albek ( “The valley-cleft of Ba’al”), in Leba - non, consisted in antiquity of a vast (about five million square f eet) platform of paved stones at the northwestern corner of which an enormous stone structure rose heavenward. Built with perfectly shaped massive stone blocks weighing 600 to 900 tons each, its western wall was especially fortified with the heaviest stone blocks on Earth, including three that weigh an incredible 1,100 tons each and are known as the Trilithon (Fig. 56) . The amazing fact about those colossal stone blocks is that they were quarried about two miles away in the valley, where one such block, whose quarrying was not completed, still sticks out from the ground (Fig. 57) . The Greeks venerated the place since Alexander’s time as He liopolis (City of the Sun god); the Romans built there the greatest temple to Zeus. The Byzantines converted it to a great church; the Moslems after them built there a mosque; and present-day Maronite Christians revere the place as a relic from the Time of the Giants.

It was upon that preexisting platform that the Temple to Yahweh was built by King Solomon, its Holy of Holies with the Ark of the Covenant resting upon a sacred rock above a subterranean chamber. The Romans, who built the greatest temple ever to Jupiter in Baalbek, also planned to build one to Jupiter in Jerusalem instead of the one to Yahweh.

The most unremitting adversary of Babylon was the Assyr - ians. Their province, in the upper region of the Tigris River, w as called Subartu in Sumerian times and was the north - ernmost extension of Sumer & Akkad. In language and ra - cial origins they appear to have had a kinship to Sargon of A kkad, so much so that when Assyria became a kingdom and imperial power, some of its most famous kings took the name Sharru-kin —Sargon—as their royal name. All that, gleaned from archaeological finds in the past two c enturies, corroborates the succint statements in the Bible ( Genesis , Chapter 10) that listed the Assyrians among the descendants of Shem, and Assyria’s capital Nineveh and other principal cities as “coming out of ”—an outgrowth, an extension of—Shine’ar (Sumer). Their pantheon was the Su - merian pantheon—their gods were the Anunnaki of Sumer & A kkad; and the theophoric names of Assyrian kings and high officials indicated reverence to the gods Ashur, Enlil, Ninurta, Sin, Adad, and Shamash.

Historical documents from the time indicate that it was t he Assyrians from the north who were the first to challenge Marduk’s Babylon militarily. The very first recorded Assyr - ian king, Ilushuma, led circa 1900 b.c.e . a successful mili - tary expedition down the Tigris River all the way south to t he border of Elam. His inscriptions state that his aim was to “set the freedom of Ur and Nippur”; and he did remove, for a while, those cities from Marduk’s grip. That was only the first fight between Assyria and Baby - lonia in a conflict that continued for more than a thousand y ears and lasted to the end of both. It was a conflict in which the Assyrian kings were usually the aggressors. Neighboring each other, speaking the same Akkadian language, and both inheriting the Sumerian foundation, the Assyrians and Baby - lonians were distinguishable by just one key difference: their nat ional god. Assyria called itself the “Land of the god Ashur” or sim- ply AS HUR, after the name of its national god, for its kings Figure 60"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"132 THE END OF DAYS and people considered this religious aspect to be all that mat - tered. Its first capital was also called “City of Ashur,” or si mply Ashur . The name meant “The One Who Sees” or “The One Who Is Seen.” Yet with all the countless hymns, prayers, and other references to the god Ashur, it remains unclear who exactly, in the Sumerian-Akkadian pantheon, he was. In god lists he was the equivalent of Enlil; other ref - erences sometimes suggest that he was Ninurta, Enlil’s son a nd heir; but since whenever the spouse was listed or men - tioned she was always called Ninlil, the conclusion tends to b e that the Assyrian “Ashur” was Enlil. The historical record of Assyria is one of conquest and ag - gression against many other nations and their gods. Their cou ntless military campaigns ranged far and wide, and were carried on, of course, “in the name of god”—their god, Ashur: “On the command of my god Ashur, the great lord” was the usual opening statement in the Assyrian kings’ re - cord of a military campaign. But when it came to the warfare wi th Babylon, the amazing aspect of Assyria’s attacks was its central aim: not just the rollback of Babylon’s influence— but the actual, physical removal of Marduk himself from his temple in Babylon! The feat of capturing Babylon and taking Marduk into capt ivity was first achieved, however, not by the Assyrians but by their neighbors to the north—the Hittites. Circa 1900 b.c.e. t he Hittites began to spread out from their strongholds in north-central Anatolia (today’s Turkey), became a major military power, and joined the chain of En- lilite nation-states opposed to Marduk’s Babylon. In a rela - tively short time, they attained imperial status and their do mains extended southward to include most of the biblical Canaan. The archaeological discovery of the Hittites, their cities, r ecords, language, and history, is an astounding and exciting tale of bringing to life and corroborating the existence of people and places hitherto known only from the Hebrew Bi - ble. Hittites are repeatedly mentioned in the Bible, but with - out the disdain or scorn reserved for worshippers of pagan g ods. It refers to their presence throughout the lands where"},{"pageNumber":140,"pageContent":"133 In the Name of God the story and history of the Hebrew Patriarchs unfolded. T hey were Abraham’s neighbors in Harran, and it was from Hittite landowners in Hebron, south of Jerusalem, that he bought the Machpelah burial cave. Bathsheba, whom King David coveted in Jerusalem, was the wife of a Hittite captain in his army; and it was from Hittite farmers (who used the site for wheat thrashing) that David bought the platform for the Temple on Mount Moriah. King Solomon bought chariot horses from Hittite princes, and it was one of their daughters whom he married. The Bible considered the Hittites to belong, genealogically a nd historically, to the peoples of Western Asia; modern scholars believe that they were migrants to Asia Minor from elsewhere—probably from beyond the Caucasus mountains. Because their language, once deciphered, was found to be - long to the Indo-European group (as do Greek on the one ha nd and Sanskrit on the other hand), they are considered to have been non-Semitic “Indo-Europeans.” Yet, once settled, they added the Sumerian cuneiform script to their own dis - tinct script, included Sumerian “loan words” in their termi - nology, studied and copied Sumerian “myths” and epic tales, a nd adopted the Sumerian pantheon—including the count of twelve “Olympians.” In fact, some of the earliest tales of the gods on Nibiru and coming from Nibiru were discovered only in their Hittite versions. The Hittite gods were undoubt - edly the Sumerian gods, and monuments and royal seals in - va r iably showed t hem accompa n ied by t he ubiquitous symbol o f the Winged Disc (see Fig. 46), the symbol for Nibiru.

The two sides t hus had all it took to engage in armed conflict.

The humiliating absence of Marduk from Babylon lasted t wenty-four years—exactly the same time that Marduk had been in exile in Harran five centuries earlier. After several years of confusion and disorder, kings belonging to a dy - nasty called the Kassite Dynasty took control of Babylon, res tored Marduk’s shrine, “took the hand of Marduk,” and returned him to Babylon. Still, the Hittite sack of Babylon is considered by historians to have marked the end both of the glorious First Dynasty of Babylon and of the Old Babylonian Period. The sudden Hittite thrust to Babylon and the temporary re - moval of Marduk remain an unresolved historical, political, a nd religious mystery. Was the intention of the raid just to embarrass and diminish Marduk—deflate his ego, confuse his followers—or was there a more far-reaching purpose— or cause—behind it?

Modern scholars speak of the period that followed Mar- d uk’s humiliation as a “dark age” in Babylonian history, not only because of the disarray it caused but mainly because of the paucity of written Babylonian records from that time. The Kassites quickly integrated themselves into the Sume- rian-Akkadian culture, including language and cuneiform script, but were neither the meticulous recordkeepers the Sumerians had been nor the likes of previous Babylonian writers of royal annals. Indeed, most of the few royal records of Kassite kings have been found not in Babylon but in Egypt—clay tablets in the El-Amarna archive of royal cor - respondence. Remarkably, in those tablets the Kassite kings ca lled the Egyptian Pharaohs “my brother.” The expression, though figurative, was not unjustified, for E gypt shared with Babylon the veneration of Ra-Marduk and, like Babylonia, had also undergone a “dark age”—a period scholars call the Second Intermediate Period. It began with the demise of the Middle Kingdom circa 1780 b.c.e. and lasted until about 1560 b.c.e. As in Babylonia, it fea - tured a reign of foreigner kings known as “Hyksos.” Here, to o, it is not certain who they were, from where they came, or how it was that their dynasties were able to rule Egypt for more than two centuries.

It was circa 1460 b.c.e. that the forgotten kingdoms of Elam and Anshan (later known as Persia, east and southeast of Babylonia) joined to form a new and powerful state, with Susa (the bibli - cal Shushan) as the national capital and Ninurta, the national go d, as Shar Ilani— “Lord of the gods”; that newly assertive nation-state was to play a decisive role in ending Babylon’s and Marduk’s supremacy. It was probably no coincidence that at about the same t ime, a new powerful state arose in the Euphrates region where Mari had once dominated. There the biblical Horites (scholars call them Hurrians) formed a powerful state named Mitanni —“The Weapon of Anu”—which captured the lands that are now Syria and Lebanon and posed a geopolitical and religious challenge to Egypt. That challenge was countered, most ferociously, by Egypt’s Pharaoh Tothmosis III, whom historians describe as an “Egyptian Napoleon.” Interwined with all that was the Is raelite exodus from Egypt , that period’s seminal event, if for no other reason than due to its lasting effects, to this day, on Mankind’s religions, social and moral codes, and the centrality of Jerusalem. Its timing was not accidental, for all those developments related to the issue of who shall control the space-related sites when Nibiru’s return will occur. As was shown in previous chapters, Abraham did not just happ en to become a Hebrew Patriarch, but was a chosen participant in major international affairs; and the places where his tale took us—Ur, Harran, Egypt, Canaan, Jerusa - lem, the Sinai, Sodom and Gomorrah—were principal sites o f the universal story of gods and men in earlier times. The Israelite Exodus from Egypt, recalled and celebrated by the Jewish people during the Passover holiday, was likewise an integral aspect of the events that were then unfolding throughout the ancient lands. The Bible itself, far from"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"142 THE END OF DAYS treating the Exodus as just an “Israelite” story, clearly p laced it in the context of Egyptian history and the interna- tional events of the time. The Hebrew Bible opens the story of the Israelite exodus f rom Egypt in its second book, Exodus, by reminding the reader that the Israelite presence in Egypt began when Jacob (who was renamed Israel by an angel) and his other eleven sons joined Jacob’s son Joseph in Egypt, in 1833 b.c.e. The full story of how Joseph, separated from his family, rose from being a slave to the rank of viceroy, and how he saved Egypt from a devastating famine, is told by the Bible in the last chapters of Genesis; and my take on how Joseph saved Egypt and what evidence of that exists to this day is told in The Earth Chronicles Expeditions. Having reminded the reader of how and when the Israelite presenc e in Egypt began, the Bible makes it clear that all that was gone and forgotten by the time of the Exodus: “Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation had passed away.” Not only they but even the dynasty of the Egyptian kings who were connected to those times were also long gone. A new dynasty came into power: “And there arose a new king over Egypt who knew not Joseph.” Accurately, the Bible describes the change of government i n Egypt. The dynasties of the Middle Kingdom based in Memphis were gone, and after the disarray of the Second Intermediate Period the princes of Thebes launched the dy - nasties of the New Kingdom. Indeed, there arose entirely ne w kings over Egypt—new dynasties in a new capital, “and they knew not Joseph.” Forgetting the Israelite contribution to Egypt’s survival, a ne w Pharaoh now saw danger in their presence. He ordered a series of oppressive steps against them, including the killing of all male babies.

But this is in accord with neither the numbers given nor with the literal wording in the Bible. Exodus begins with a list of the names of Jacob and his children who had come, with their children, to join Joseph in Egypt, and states that “all of those who descended from the loins of Jacob, exclud - ing Joseph who was already in Egypt, numbered seventy.” ( That together with Jacob and Joseph the number totaled 72 is an intriguing detail to ponder.) The “sojourn” lasted four cen - turies, and according to the Bible the number of all the Israel - ites leaving Egypt was 600,000; no Pharaoh would consider s uch a group “greater and mightier than us.” (For the identity of that Pharaoh and of “the Pharaoh’s Daughter” who raised Moses as her son, see Divine Encounters .) The narrative’s wording records the Pharaoh’s fear that at t ime of war, the Israelites will “join our enemies, and fight against us, and leave the land .” It is a fear not of a “Fifth Column” inside Egypt, but of Egypt’s indigent “Children of Israel” leaving to reinforce an enemy nation to whom they are related—all of them being, in Egyptian eyes, “Children of Israel.” But what other nation of “Children of Israel” and what war was the Egyptian king talking about? Thanks to archaeological discoveries of royal records f rom both sides of those ancient conflicts and the synchro - nization of their contents, we now know that the New King - dom Pharaohs were engaged in prolonged warfare against Mi tanni . Starting circa 1560 b.c.e. with the Pharaoh Ah - mosis, continued by the Pharaohs Amenophis I, Thothmosis I, a nd Thothmosis II, and intensifying under Thothmosis III through 1460 b.c.e., Egyptian armies thrust into Canaan and advanced northward against Mitanni. The Egyptian chronicles of those battles frequently mention Naharin as"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"144 THE END OF DAYS the ultimate target—the Khabur River area, which the Bible ca lled Aram-Naharayim (“The Western Land of the Two Rivers”); its principal urban center was Harran! It was there, Bible students will recall, that Abraham’s brot her Nahor stayed on when Abraham proceeeded to Ca - naan; it was from there that Rebecca, the bride of Abraham’s son Isa ac, came—she was in fact the granddaughter of Na - hor. And it was to Harran that Isaac’s son Jacob (renamed Isr ael ) went to find a bride—ending up marrying his cous - ins, the two daughters (Le’ah and Rachel) of Laban, the brot her of his mother Rebecca. These direct family ties between the “Children of Israel” ( i.e., of Jacob) who were in Egypt and those who stayed on in Naharin-Naharayim are highlighted in the very first verses in Exodus : the list of the sons of Jacob who had come to Egypt with him includes the youngest, Ben-Yamin (Benja - min), the only full brother of Joseph because both were Ja- cob ’s sons by Rachel (the others were sons of Jacob by his wife Le’ah and two concubines). We now know from Mitan - nian tablets that the most important tribe in the Khabur River ar ea were called Ben-Yamins! The name of Joseph’s full brother was thus a Mitannian tribal name; no wonder, then, that the Egyptians considered the “Children of Israel” in Egypt and the “Children of Israel” in Mitanni as one com - bined nation “greater and mightier than us.” That was the war the Egyptians were preoccupied with a nd that was the reason for the Egyptian military concern— not the small number of Israelites in Egypt if they stayed, but a threat if they “left the land” and occupied territory to the north of Egypt. Indeed, preventing the Israelites from leav - ing appears to have been the central theme of the developing d rama of the Exodus—there were the repeated appeals by Moses to the reigning Pharaoh to “let my people go,” and the Pharaoh’s repeated refusals to grant that request—in spite of ten consecutive divine punishments. Why? For a plausible answer we need to insert the space connection into the unfolding drama. In their northward thrusts, the Egyptians marched through t he Sinai peninsula via the Way of the Sea, a route (later"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"145 The Promised Land called by the Romans Vi a Maris ) that afforded passage through the gods’ Fourth Region along the Mediterranean coast, without actually entering the peninsula proper. Then, advancing north through Canaan, the Egyptians repeatedly reached the Cedar Mountains of Lebanon and fought battles at Kadesh, “The Sacred Place.” Those were battles, we sug - gest, for control of the two sacred space-related sites—the er stwhile Mission Control Center ( Jerusalem) in Canaan and the Landing Place in Lebanon. The Pharaoh Thothmo - sis III, for example, in his war annals, referred to Jerusalem (“ Ia -ur-sa ”), which he garrisoned as the “ place reaching to the outer ends of the Earth ”—a “Navel of the Earth.” De - scribing his campaigns farther north, he recorded battles at K adesh and Naharin and spoke of taking the Cedar Moun - tains, the “ M ountains of god’s land ” that “support the pil - lars to heaven . ” The terminology unmistakably identifies by their space-related attributes the two sites he was claim - ing to have captured “for the great god, my father Ra/ Am on.” And the purpose of the Exodus? In the words of the bibli - cal God himelf, to keep His sworn promise to Abraham, Isa ac, and Jacob to grant to their descendants as “an Ever - lasting Heritage” ( Exodu s 6 : 4–8); “from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates, the great river”; “the whole of the Land of Canaan,” ( Genesis 15:18, 17:8); “the Western Mount . . . the Land of Canaan and Lebanon” ( Deuteronomy 1: 7); “from the desert to Lebanon, from the River Euphrates u nto the Western Sea” ( Deuteronomy 11:24)—even the “ for - tified places reaching heavenwards ” w herein “descendants of the Anakim ”—the Anunnaki—still resided ( Deuteronomy 9: 1–2). The promise to Abraham was renewed at the Israelites’ f irst stop, at Har Ha-Elohim , the “Mount of the Elohim/ gods.” And the mission was to take hold, possess, the two other space-related sites, which the Bible repeatedly con - nected (as in Psalms 48 :3), calling Mount Zion in Jerusalem Har Kodshi , “My Sacred Mount,” and the other, on the crest of Lebanon, Har Zaphon , “The Secret North Mount.” The Promised Land clearly embraced both space-related"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"146 THE END OF DAYS sites; its division among the twelve tribes granted the area of J erusalem to the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, and the terri - tory that is now Lebanon to the tribe of Asher. In his parting w ords to the tribes before he died, Moses reminded the tribe of Asher that the northern space-related site was in their land—like no other tribe, he said, they will see the “ Rider of the clouds soaring heavenwards ” ( Deuteronomy 33: 26). Apart from the territorial assignment , the words of Moses imply that the site would be functional and used for soar - ing heavenward in the future . Clearly and most emphatically, the Children of Israel w ere to be the custodians of the two remaining space-re- lated sites of the Anunnaki . That Covenant with the people chosen for the task was renewed, at the greatest theophany on record, at Mount Sinai . It was certainly not by chance that the theophany oc- curred there. From the very beginning of the Exodus tale— w hen God called out to Moses and gave him the Exodus assignment—that place in the Sinai peninsula occupied cen - ter stage. We read in Exodus 3 :1 that it happened at the “Mount of the Elohim ”—the mountain associated with the Anunnaki. The route of the Exodus (Fig. 65) was divinely determined, the Israelite multitude having been shown the way by a “pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night.” The Children of Israel “journeyed in the wilderness of Sinai according to the instructions of Yahweh,” the Bible clearly states; in the third month of the journey they “reached and encamped opposite the Mount”; and on the third day thereaf - ter, Yahweh in his Ka bod “came down upon Mount Sinai in full view of all the people.” It was the same mount that Gilgamesh, arriving at the p lace where the rocket ships ascended and descended, had called “Mount Mashu .” It was the same mount with “the double doors to heaven” to which Egyptian Pharaohs went in their Afterlife Journey to join the gods on the “planet of millions of years.” It was the Mount astride the erstwhile Spaceport—and it was there that the Covenant was renewed with the people chosen to be the guardians of the two re -"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"147 The Promised Land Figure 65 maining space-related sites. *** As t he Israelites were preparing, after the death of Moses, to cross the Jordan River, the boundaries of the Promised Land were restated to the new leader, Joshua. Embracing the locations of the space-related sites, the boundaries em - phatically included Lebanon. Speaking to Joshua, the bibli - cal God said:"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"148 THE END OF DAYS Now arise and cross this Jordan, thou and all this people, the Children of Israel, unto the land which I do give to them.

Joshua 1: 2–4 With so much of the current political, military, and reli - gious turmoil taking place in the Lands of the Bible, and wi th the Bible itself serving as a key to the past and to the future, one must point out a caveat inserted by the biblical God in regard to the Promised Land. The boundaries, run - ning from the Wilderness in the south to the Lebanon range i n the north, and from the Euphrates in the east to the Medi - terranean Sea in the west, were reconfirmed to Joshua. T hese, God said, were the promised boundaries. But to be - come an actual land grant, it had to be obtained by po sses- sion . A kin to the “planting of the flag” by explorers in the recent past, the Israelites could possess and keep land where they actually set foot—“tread with the soles of their feet”; therefore, God commanded the Israelites not to tarry and delay, but to cross the Jordan and fearlessly and systemati - cally settle the Promised Land. But when the twelve tribes under the leadership of Joshua w ere done with the conquest and settlement of Canaan, only part of the areas east of the Jordan were occupied; nor were all of the lands west of the Jordan captured and settled. As far as the two space-related sites were concerned, their stories are totally different: Jerusalem—which was specifically listed ( Joshua 12: 10, 18: 28)—was firmly in the hands of the tribe of Benjamin. But whether the northward advance attained the Landing Place in Lebanon is in doubt. Subsequent biblical references to the site called it the “Crest of Zaphon ” (the “se-"},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"149 The Promised Land cret north place”)—what the area’s dwellers, the Canaanite- P hoenicians, also called it. (Canaanite epics deemed it to be a sacred place of the god Adad, Enlil’s youngest son.) The crossing of the Jordan River—an accomplishment at - tained with the help of several miracles—took place “oppo - site Jericho,” and the fortified city of Jericho (west of the J ordan) was the Israelites’ first target. The story of the tum - bling of its walls and its capture includes a biblical reference to S umer ( Shin’ar in Hebrew): in spite of the commandment to take no booty, one of the Israelites could not resist the temptation to “keep a valued garment of Shin’ar.” The capture of Jericho, and the town of Ai south of it, op ened the way to the Israelites’ most important and imme - diate target: Jerusalem, where the Mission Control platform ha d been. The missions of Abraham and his descendants and God’s covenants with them never lost sight of that site’s cen - t rality. As God told Moses, i t is in Jerusalem that His earthly abode was to be ; now the promise-prophecy could be ful - filled. The capture of the cities on the way to Jerusalem, along wi th the hill towns surrounding it, turned out to be a for - midable challenge, primarily because some of them, and es - pecially Hebron, were inhabited by “children of the Anakim ” —descendants of the Anunnaki. Jerusalem, it will be recalled, ceased to function as Mission Control Center when the spaceport in the Sinai was wiped out more than six centuries earlier. But according to the Bible, the descendants of the Anunnaki who had been stationed there were still re - siding in that part of Canaan. And it was “Adoni-Zedek, king o f Jerusalem” who formed an alliance with four other city- kings to block the Israelite advance. The battle that ensued, at Gibe’on in the Valley of Ayalon j ust north of Jerusalem, took place on a unique day— the day the Earth stood still . For the better part of that day, “the Sun stopped and the Moon stood still” ( Joshua 10: 10 – 14), enabling the Israelites to win that crucial battle. (A parallel but reverse occurrence, when nighttime lasted an extra twenty hours, took place on the other side of the world, in the Americas; we discuss the matter in The Lost Realms .)"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"150 THE END OF DAYS In the biblical view, then, God himself assured that Jerusa- lem would come into Israelite hands. No sooner was kingship established under David than he w as commanded by God to clear the platform atop Mount Moriah and sanctify it for Yahweh’s Temple. And ever since Solomon built that Temple there, Jerusalem/Mount Moriah/ the Temple Mount have remained uniquely sacred. There is, indeed, no other explanation why Jerusalem—a city not at major crossroads, far from waterways, with no natural re- sources—has been coveted and sacred since antiquity, deemed to be a singular city, a “Navel of the Earth.” The comprehensive list of captured cities given in Jo shua Chapter 12 names Jerusalem as the third city, following Jeri - cho and Ai, as firmly in Israelite hands. The story was differ - ent, however, in regard to the northern space-related site. The Cedar Mountains of Lebanon run in two ranges, the L ebanon on the west and the anti-Lebanon on the east, sepa - rated by the Bekka— t he “Cleft,” a canyon-like valley that has been known since Canaanite times as the “Lord’s Cleft” or Ba’al-Bekka —hence Ba’albek, the current name of the site of the Landing Place (on the edge of the eastern range, facing the valley). The kings of the “Mount of the North” are listed in the Book of Joshua as having been defeated; a place called Ba’al Gad “in the valley of Lebanon” is listed as cap - tured; but whether Ba’al-Gad “in the valley of Lebanon” is j ust another name for Ba’al-Bekka is uncertain. We are told ( Judges 1: 33) that the Tribe of Naphtali “did not disinherit the dwellers of Beth-Shemesh” (“Abode of Shamash,” the Sun god), and that could be a reference to the site, for the later Greeks called the place Heliopolis, “City of the Sun.” (Though later the territories under Kings David and Solo - mon extended to include Beth-Shemesh, it was only tempo - rarily so.) The primary failure to establish Israelite hegemony over t he northern space-related site made it “available” to others. A century and a half after the Exodus the Egyptians at - tempted to take possession of that “available” Landing P lace, but were met by an opposing Hittite army.

Known as the Battle of Kadesh, i t ended with an Egyptian defeat, but the war and the battle exhausted both sides so much that the site the Landing Place was left in the hands of the local Phoenician kings of Tyre, Sidon, and Byblos (the biblical Gebal). (The prophets Eze - kiel and Amos, who called it “the place of the gods” as well a s “the Eden Abode,” recognized it as belonging to the Phoenicians.) The Phoenician kings of the first millennium b.c.e . were well aware of the site’s significance and purpose—witness its depiction on a Phoenician coin from Byblos (see Fig. 55). The Prophet Ezekiel (28: 2, 14) admonished the king of Tyre for haughtily believing that, having been to that sacred site of the Elohim , he had become himself a god: Thou hast been to a sacred mount, As a god werest thou, moving within the fiery stones . . . A nd you became haughty, saying: “A god am I, at the place of the Elohim I was”; But you are just Man, not god. It was at that time that the Prophet Ezekiel—in exile in the “ old country,” near Harran on the Khabur River—saw divine visions and a celestial chariot, a “Flying Saucer,” but that tale must be postponed to a later chapter. Here it is important"},{"pageNumber":159,"pageContent":"152 THE END OF DAYS to note t hat of the two space-related sites, only Jerusalem was retained by the followers of Yahweh. The first five books of the Hebrew Bible, known as the To rah (“The Teachings”), cover the story from Creation, Adam, and Noah to the Patriarchs and Joseph in Genesis . The other four books— Exodus , Leviticus , Numbers, and Deuteronomy —tell the story of the Exodus on the one hand, and on the other hand enumerate the rules and regulations of the new reli - gion of Yahweh. That a new religion encompassing a new, a “pr iestly” way of life was promulgated is explicitly made clear: “You shall neither do what is done in the land of Egypt, where you had dwelt, nor as is wont in the Land of Canaan whence I am bringing you; you shall neither behave like them nor follow their statutes” ( Leviticus 18: 2–3). Having established the basics of the faith (“You shall ha ve no other God before me”) and its moral and ethical code in just Ten Commandments, there follow page after page of detailed dietary requirements, rules for priestly rites and vestments, medical teachings, agricultural directives, architectural instructions, family and sexual conduct regu - lations, property and criminal laws, and so on. They reveal e xtraordinary knowledge in virtually every scientific disci - pline, expertise in metals and textiles, acquaintance with l egal systems and societal issues, familiarity with the lands, history, customs, and gods of other nations—and certain numerological preferences. The theme of tw elve —as in the twelve tribes of Israel or in the twelve-month year—is obvious. Obvious, too, is the pre - dilection for seven , mos t prominently in the realm of festi - vals and rituals, and in establishing a week of seven days and conse crating the seventh day as the Sabbath. Forty is a spe - cial number, as in the forty days and forty nights that Moses sp ent upon Mount Sinai, or the forty years decreed for the Israelite wandering in the Sinai wilderness. These are num - bers familiar to us from the Sumerian tales—the twelve of t he solar system and the twelve-month calendar of Nippur; the seven as the planetary number of the Earth (when the"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"153 The Promised Land Anunnaki counted from the outside in) and of Enlil as Earth’s Co mmander; the forty as Ea/Enki’s numerical rank. The number fifty i s a lso present. Fifty, as the reader k nows, was a number with “sensitive” aspects—it was the original rank number of Enlil and the stand-in rank of his heir appar - ent, Ninurta; and more significantly, in the days of the Exo - dus, it connoted symbolism to Marduk and his Fifty Names. E xtra attention is therefore called for when we find that “fifty” was granted extraordinary importance— it was used to create a new Unit of Time, the fifty-year Jubilee . While the calendar of Nippur was clearly adopted as the ca lendar by which the festivals and other Israelite religious rites were to be observed, special regulations were dictated for the fiftieth year; it was given a special name, that of a Jubilee Year: “A hallowed Jubilee year it shall be unto you” ( Leviticus Chapter 25). In such a year, unprecedented free - doms were to take place. The count was to be done by count - ing the New Year’s Day of Atonements for seven years s evenfold, forty-nine times; then on the Day of Atonement on the year thereafter, the fiftieth year, the trumpet call of a ram’s horn was to be sounded throughout the land, and free - dom was to be proclaimed for the land and all who dwelled i n it: people should return to their families; property should return to its original owners—all land and house sales shall be redeemable and undone; slaves (who had to be treated at all times as hired help!) shall be set free, and liberty shall be given the land itself by leaving it fallow that year. As much as the concept of a “Year of Freedom” is novel a nd unique, the choice of fifty as a calendrical unit seems odd (we have adopted 100—a century—as a convenient unit of time). Then the name given to such a once-in-fifty year is even more intriguing. The word that is translated “Jubilee” is Yovel in the Hebrew Bible, and it means “a ram.” So one can say that what was decreed was a “ Year of the Ram , ” to repeat itself every fifty years, and to be announced by sounding the ram’s horn . Both the choice of fifty for the new time unit and its name raise the unavoidable question: Was there a hidden aspect here, related to Marduk and his Age of the Ram?"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"154 THE END OF DAYS Were the Israelites told to keep counting “fifty years” until so me significant divine event, relating either to the Age of the Ram or to the holder of the Rank of Fifty— when every - thing shall turn back to a new beginning? While no obvious answer is offered in those biblical chap - ters, one cannot avoid searching for clues by pursuing a sig - nificant and very similar year-unit on the other side of the w orld: not fifty, but fifty-two. It was the Secret Number of the Mesoamerican god Quetzalcoatl, who according to Az - tec and Mayan legends gave them civilization, including t heir three calendars. In The Lost Realms we have identified Quetzalcoatl as the Egyptian god Thoth, whose secret num - ber was fifty-two—a calendrical-based number, for it repre - sented the fifty-two weeks of seven days in a solar year. The oldest of the three Mesoamerican calendars is known a s the Long Count: it counted the number of days from a “Day One” that scholars have identified as August 13, 3113 b.c.e. Alongside this continuous but linear calendar there w ere two cyclical calendars. One, the Haab , was a solar-year calendar of 365 days, divided into 18 months of 20 days each plus an additional 5 special days at year’s end. The other was the Tzolkin , a Sacred Calendar of only 260 days, composed of a 20-day unit rotated 13 times. The two cyclical calendars were then meshed together, as two geared wheels (Fig. 67) , to create the Sacred Round of fifty-two years, when these two counts returned to their common starting point and started the counts all over again. This “bundle” of fifty-two years was a most important u nit of time, because it was linked to the promise of Quetzal - coatl, who at some point left Mesoamerica, to return on his S acred Year. The Mesoamerican peoples therefore used to gather on mountains every fifty-two years to expect the promised Return of Quetzalcoatl. (In one such Sacred Year, 1519 a.d. , a white-faced and bearded Spaniard, Hernando Cortes, landed on Mexico’s Yucatan coast and was welcomed by the Aztec king Montezuma as the returning god—a costly mistake, as we now know.)

Some sc holars view those developments as an attempt to adopt Monotheism—perhaps under the influence of the revelations at Mount Sinai. What they have in mind is the reign of Amenhotep (sometimes rendered as Amenophis) IV who left Thebes and its temples, gave up the worship of Amon, and declared ATEN the sole creator god. As we shall show, that was not an echo of Monotheism, bu t another harbinger of an expected Return—the re - turn, into view, of the Planet of the Cross. The Pharaoh in question is better known by the new name he ha d adopted— Akhen-Aten (“The servant/worshipper of Aten”), and the new capital and religious center that he had established, Akhet-Aten (“Aten of the Horizon”), is better known by the site’s modern name, Tell el-Amarna (where the famed ancient archive of royal international correspondence was discovered). Scion of Egypt’s famed eighteenth Dynasty, Akhenaten r eigned from 1379 to 1362 b.c.e. , and his religious revolution did not last. The priesthood of Amon in Thebes led the op - position, presumably because it was deprived of its positions o f power and wealth, but it is of course possible that the ob - jections were genuinely on religious grounds, for Akhenat- en ’s successors (of whom most famed was Tut-Ankh-Amen) resumed the inclusion of Ra/Amon in their theophoric names.

Nevertheless, the remains that archaeologists have f ound throw enough light on Akhenaten and his religion. The notion that the worship of the Aten was a form of monot heism—worship of a sole universal creator—stems primarily from some of the hymns to the Aten that have been found; they include such verses as “ O sole god , like whom there is no other . . . The world came into being by thy hand.” The fact that, in a clear departure from Egyptian customs, representation of this god in anthropomorphic form was strictly forbidden sounds very much like Yahweh’s prohibi - tion, in the Ten Commandments, against making any “graven i mages” to worship. Additionally, some portions of the Hymns to Aten read as if they were clones of the biblical Psalms— O living Aten, How manifold are thy works! They are hidden from the sight of men. O sole god, beside whom there is no other! Thou didst create the earth according to thy desire whilst thou wast alone. The famed Egyptologist James H. Breasted ( T he Dawn of Conscience ) compared the above verses to Psalm 104, begin - ning with verse 24— O Lord, how manifold are thy works! In wisdom hast thou made them all; the Earth is full of thy riches. The similarity, however, arises not because the two, Egyp - tian hymn and biblical Psalm, copy each other, but because b oth speak of the same celestial god of the Sumerian Epic of Creation—of Nibiru—that shaped the Heavens and created the Earth, imparting to it the “seed of life.” Virtually every book on ancient Egypt will tell you that t he “Aten” disc that Akhenaten made the central object of worship represented the benevolent Sun.

A close reading of the hymns reveals that Akhenaten’s “ star god” was not Ra as Amon “the Unseen,” but a different kind of Ra: it was the celestial god who had “existed from primeval time . . . The one who renews himself ” as it reap - pear s in all its glory, a celestial god that was “ going afar and returning .” On a daily basis, those words could indeed apply to the Sun, but on a long-term basis, the description fitted Ra only as Nibiru: it did become unseen, the hymns said, because it was “far away in heaven,” because it went “to the rear of the horizon, to the height of heaven.” And now, Akhenaten announced, it was coming back in all its glory. Aten’s hymns prophesied its reappearance, its return “beauti - ful on the horizon of heaven . . . Glittering, beautiful, strong,” us hering a time of peace and benevolence to all. These words express clear messianic expectations that have nothing to do with the Sun. In support of the “Aten is the Sun” explanation, various depi ctions of Akhenaten are offered; they show (Fig. 68) him and his wife blessed by, or praying to, a rayed star; it is the Sun, most Egyptologists say. The hymns do refer to the Aten as a manifestation of Ra, which to Egyptologists who have deemed Ra to be the Sun means that Aten, too, repre - sented the Sun; but if Ra was Marduk and the celestial Mar - duk was Nibiru, then Aten, too, represented Nibiru and not t he Sun. Additional evidence comes from sky maps, some painted on coffin lids (Fig. 69) , that clearly showed the twelve zodiacal constellations, the rayed Sun, and other members of the solar system; but the planet of Ra, the “Planet of Millions of Years,” is shown as an extra planet in its own large separate celestial barque beyond the Sun , with the pictorial hieroglyph for “god” in it—Akhenaten’s “Aten.” What, then, was Akhenaten’s innovation, or, rather, di - gression, from the official religious line?

Then the issue was: Has Mar- duk/Ra’s time for supremacy come, has the Age of the Ram begun in the heavens? Akhenaten shifted the issue from Ce - lestial Time (the zodiacal clock) to Divine Time (Nibiru’s o rbital time), changing the question to: When will the Un - seen celes tial god reappear and become visible—“beautiful on the horizon of heaven”? His greatest heresy in the eyes of the priests of Ra/Amon ca n be judged by the fact that he erected a special monument honoring the Ben-Ben— an object that had been revered gen- erations earlier as the vehicle in which Ra had arrived on E arth from the heavens (Fig. 70) . It was an indication, we believe, that what he was expecting in connection with Aten was a Reappearance, a Return not just of the Planet of the Gods, but another arrival, a New Coming of the gods them - selves! This, we must conclude, was the innovation, the difference i ntroduced by Akhenaten. In defiance of the priestly establish - ment, and no doubt prematurely in their opinion, he was an - nouncing the coming of a new messianic time. This heresy w as aggravated by the fact that Akhenaten’s pronouncements about the returning Aten were accompanied by a personal claim: Akhenaten increasingly referred to himself as the god’s prophet-son, one “who came forth from the god’s body,” and to whom alone the deity’s plans were revealed: Figure 70"},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"162 THE END OF DAYS There is no other that knoweth thee except thy son Akhenaten; Thou hast made him wise in thy plans. And this, too, was unacceptable to the Theban priests of A mon. As soon as Akhenaten was gone (and it is uncertain how . . . ), they restored the worship of Amon—the Unseen god—and smashed and destroyed all that Akhenaten had erected. That the Aten episode in Egypt, as the introduction of the J ubilee—the “Year of the Ram”—were the stirrings of a wider expectation of a Return of a celestial “star god” is evi - dent from yet another biblical reference to the Ram, yet an- other manifestation of a Coun tdown to the Return. It is the record of an unusual incident at the end of the E xodus. It is a tale that is replete with puzzling aspects, and one that ends with a divinely inspired vision of things to come. The Bible repeatedly declared divination by examining a nimal entrails, consulting with spirits, soothsaying, en - chanting, conjuring, and fortune-telling to be “abominations u nto Yahweh”—all manners of sorcery practiced by other nations that the Israelites must avoid. At the same time, it as- serted—quoting Yahweh himself—that dreams, oracles, and visions could be legitimate ways of divine communication. It is such a distinction that explains why the Book of Numbers devotes three long chapters (22–24) to tell—approvingly!— the story of a non-Israelite Seer and Oracle-teller. His name was Bil’am, rendered Balaam in English Bibles. The events described in those chapters took place when t he Israelites (“Children of Israel” in the Bible), having left the Sinai Peninsula, went around the Dead Sea on the east, advancing northward. As they encountered the small king - doms that occupied the lands east of the Dead Sea and the J ordan River, Moses sought from their kings permission for peaceful passage; it was, by and large, refused. The Israel - ites, having just defeated the Ammonites, who did not let t hem pass through peacefully, now “were encamped in the"},{"pageNumber":170,"pageContent":"163 The Cross on the Horizon plains of Mo’ab, on the side of the Jordan that is opposite J ericho,” awaiting the Moabite king’s permission to pass through his land. Unwilling to let “the horde” pass yet afraid to fight them, t he king of Mo’ab—Balak the son of Zippor—had a bright idea. He sent emissaries to fetch an internationally renowned seer, Bala’am the son of Be’or, and have him “put a curse on these people for me,” to make it possible to defeat and chase them away. Balaam had to be entreated several times before he ac - cepted the assignment. First at Balaam’s home (somewhere ne ar the Euphrates River?) and then on the way to Moab, an Angel of God (the word in Hebrew, Mal’ach , literally means “emissary”) appears and gets involved in the proceedings; he is sometimes visible and sometimes invisible. The Angel al - lows Balaam to accept the assignment only after making s ure that Balaam understands that he is to utter only divinely inspired omens. Puzzlingly, Balaam calls Yahweh “my God” when he repeats this condition, first to the king’s ambassa - dors and then to the Moabite king himself. A series of oracular settings are then arranged. The king t akes Balaam to a hilltop from which he can see the whole Israelite encampment, and on the Seer’s instructions he erects seven altars, sacrifices seven bullocks and seven rams, and awaits the oracle; but from Balaam’s mouth come words not of accusation but of praise for the Israelites. The persistent Moabite king then takes Balaam to another mou nt, from which just the edge of the Israelite encampment can be seen, and the procedure is repeated a seond time. But again Balaam’s oracle blesses rather than curses the Israel - ites: I see them coming out of Egypt protected by a god with sprea ding ram’s horns, he says—it is a nation destined for kingship, a nation that like a lion will arise. Determined to try again, the king now takes Balaam to a h illtop that faces the desert, facing away from the Israelite encampment; “maybe the gods will let you proclaim curses there,” he says. Seven altars are again erected, on which seven bullocks and seven rams are sacrificed. But Balaam now sees the Israelites and their future not with human eyes"},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"164 THE END OF DAYS but “in a divine vision.” For the second time he sees the na - tion protected, as it came out of Egypt, by a god with spread - ing rams’ horns, and envisions Israel as a nation that “like a l ion will arise.” When the Moabite king protests, Balaam explains that no m atter what gold or silver he be offered, he can utter only the words that God puts in his mouth. So the frustrated king gives up and lets Balaam go. But now Balaam offers the king free advice: Let me tell you what the future holds, he says to the king—“that which will come about to this nation and to your people at the end of days”—and proceeds to describe the di - vine vision of the future by relating it to a “star”: I see it, though not now; I behold it, though it is not near: A Star of Jacob is on its course. A Scepter from Israel will arise— Moab’s quarters it will crush, all the Children of Seth it will unsettle. Numbers 24: 17 Balaam then turned and cast his eyes toward the Edomites, A malekites, Kenites, and other Canaanite nations, and pro - nounced an oracle thereon: Those who will survive the wrath o f Jacob shall fall into the hands of Assyria; then Assyria’s turn will come, and it shall forever perish. And having pro - nounced that oracle, “Balaam rose up and went back to his p lace; and Balak too went on his way.” Though the Balaam episode has naturally been the subject o f discussion and debate by biblical and theological schol - ars, it remains baffling and unresolved. The text switches e ffortlessly between references to the Elohim —“gods” in the plural—and to Yahweh, the sole God, as the Divine Pres - ence. It gravely transgresses the Bible’s most basic prohibi - tion by applying to the God who brought the Israelites out of E gypt a physical image, and then compounds the transgres - sion by envisioning Him in the image of “a ram with spread - ing horns”—an image that has been the Egyptian depiction of Amon (Fig. 71) !

The text suggests that Balaam was an Aramaean, residing so mewhere up the Euphrates River; his prophetic oracles expanded from the fate of the Children of Jacob to the place of Israel among the nations to oracles regarding the future of such other nations—even of distant and yet-to-come impe - rial Assyria. The oracles were thus an expression of wider n on-Israelite expectations at the time. By including the tale, the Bible combined the Israelite destiny with Mankind’s universal expectations .

The zodiacal references are strongest regarding the Age of t he Ram (and its god!) at the time of the Exodus, and become oracular and prophetic as the Seer Balaam envisions the Fu - ture, when the zodiacal constellation symbols of the Bull and t he Ram (“bullocks and rams for sevenfold sacrifices”) and the Lion (“when the Royal Trumpet shall be heard in Israel”) are invoked ( Numbers Chapter 23). And it is when envision - ing that Distant Future that the Balaam text employs the sig - nificant term At t he End of Days as the time to which the prophetic oracles apply ( Numbers 24: 14). The term directly links these non-Israelite prophecies to t he destiny of Jacob’s offspring because it was used by Jacob himself as he lay on his deathbed and gathered his children to hear oracles regarding their future ( Genesis Chapter 49). “Come gather together,” he said, “that I may tell you that which shall befall you at the End of Days .” The oracles, indi - vidually stated for each one of the twelve future Tribes of Isr ael, are deemed by many to be related to the twelve zodia - cal constellations. And what about the Star of Jacob—an explicit vision by Ba laam? In scholarly biblical discussions, it is usually considered in a n astrological rather than an astronomical context at best, and more often than not, the tendency has been to deem the reference to “Jacob’s Star” as purely figurative. But what if the reference was indeed to a “star” orbiting on its course—a planet prophetically seen though it is not yet visible? What if Balaam, like Akhenaten, was speaking of the ret urn, the reappearance, of Nibiru? Such a return, it must be realized, would be an extraordinary event that occurs once in several millennia, an event that had repeatedly signi - fied the most profound watersheds in the affairs of gods and men. This is not just a rhetorical question. In fact, the unfolding e vents were increasingly indicating that an overwhelmingly significant occurrence was in the offing. Within a century or"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"167 The Cross on the Horizon so of the preoccupations and predictions regarding the Re - turning Planet that we find in the tales of the Exodus, Balaam, a nd Akhenaten’s Egypt, Babylon itself started to provide evi - dence of such wide-spreading expectations, and the most pro minent clue was the Sign of the Cross. In Babylon, the time was that of the Kassite dynasty, of w hich we have written earlier. Little has remained of their reign in Babylon itself, and as stated earlier those kings did not excel in keeping royal records. But they did leave behind telltale depictions—and international correspondence of let - ters on clay tablets. It was in the ruins of Akhet-Aten, Akhenaten’s capital—a s ite now known as Tell el-Amarna in Egypt—that the famed “el-Amarna Tablets” were discovered. Of the 380 clay tablets, all except three were inscribed in the Akkadian language, which was then the language of international diplomacy. While some of the tablets represented copies of royal letters sent from the Egyptian court, the bulk were original letters received from foreign kings. The cache was the royal diplomatic archive of Akhenaten, a nd the tablets were predominantly correspondence he had received from the kings of Babylon! Did Akhenaten use those exchanges of letters with his c ounterparts in Babylon to tell them of his newfound Aten religion? We really don’t know, for all we have are a Babylo - nian king’s letters to Akhenaten in which he complained that g old sent to him was found short in weight, that his ambas - sadors were robbed on the way to Egypt, or that the Egyptian k ing failed to inquire about his health. Yet the frequent ex - changes of ambassadors and other emissaries, even offers of intermarriage, as well as the calling of the Egyptian king “my brother” by the Babylonian king, must lead to a conclu - sion that the hierarchy in Babylon was fully aware of the re - ligious goings-on in Egypt; and if Babylon wondered, “What is t his ‘Ra as a Returning Star’ commotion?” Babylon must have realized that it was a reference to “Marduk as a Return - ing Planet”— to N ibiru orbiting back.

Be that as it may, i t was in the thirteenth century b.c.e. that the Kassite kings of Babylon started to signal, in a variety of ways, their own fundamental religious changes. In 12 60 b.c.e. a new king ascended the throne in Babylon and adopted the name Kadashman-Enlil—a theophoric name surprisingly venerating Enlil. It was no passing gesture, for he was followed on the throne, for the next century, by Kas- site kings bearing theophoric names venerating not only En - lil but also Adad—a surprising gesture suggesting a desire f or divine reconciliation. That something unusual was ex - pected was further evidenced on commemorative monu- ments called kudu rru —“rounded stones”—that were set up as boundary markers. Inscribed with a text stating the terms of the border treaty (or land grant) and the oaths taken to uphold it, the kudurru was sanctified by symbols of the ce - lestial gods. The divine zodiacal symbols—all twelve of t hem—were frequently depicted (Fig. 72) ; orbiting above them were the emblems of the Sun, the Moon, and Nibiru. In another depiction (Fig. 73) , Nibiru was shown in the com - pany of Earth (the seventh planet) and the Moon (and the u mbilical-cutter symbol for Ninmah). Significantly, Nibiru was depicted no longer by the Winged D isc symbol, but rather in a new way—as the planet of the radiating cross —befitting its description by the Sumerians in the “Olden Days” as a radiating planet about to become the “Planet of the Crossing.” This way of showing a long-unobserved Nibiru by a sym - bol of a radiating cross began to become more common, and so on the Kassite kings of Babylon simplified the symbol to just a Sign of the Cross, replacing with it the Winged Disc symbol on their royal seals (Fig. 74) . This cross symbol, which looks like the much later Christian “Maltese Cross,” is known in studies of ancient glyptic as a “Kassite Cross.” As another depiction indicates, the symbol of the cross was for a planet clearly not the same as the Sun , which is separately shown along with the Moon-crescent and the six-pointed star"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"169 The Cross on the Horizon Figure 72 Figure 73 symbol for Mars (Fig. 75) .

The adoption of the Sign of the Cross as the emblem of Nib - iru, in Babylon, Assyria, and elsewhere, was not a surprising i nnovation.

Since Tiamat orbited the Sun in a plane called the Ecliptic (as other members of our Sun’s planetary family do), it is to that place in the heavens that the Invader had to return; and when it does so, orbit after orbit after orbit, it is there that it crosses the plane of the ecliptic. A simple way to illustrate this would be to show the orbital path of the well-known Halley’s Comet (Fig. 78) , which emulates on a greatly reduced scale the orbit of Nibiru: its inclined orbit brings it, as it nears the Sun, from the south, from below the ecliptic, near Uranus. It arches above the ecliptic and makes the turn around the Sun, saying “Hello” to Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars; then it comes down and crosses the ecliptic near the site of Nibiru’s Celestial Battle with Tiamat—the Crossing (marked “ X ”)—and is gone, only to come back as its orbital Destiny prescribes.

Finally and most memorably for the Sumerians, the planet w as visible once again when Anu and Antu came to Earth on a state visit circa 4000 b.c.e. , in the Age of the Bull (Taurus). The city that was later known for millennia as Uruk was es - tablished in their honor, a ziggurat was erected, and from its s tages the appearance of the planets on the horizon, as the night sky darkened, was observed.

It was also then that a temple to Yahweh in Jerusalem forever linked its sacred site to the course of historic events and to Mankind’s messianic expectations. The time and the place were no co - incidence: the impending Return dictated the enshrinement o f the erstwhile Mission Control Center. Compared to the mighty and conquering imperial powers o f those days—Babylonia, Assyria, Egypt—the Hebrew king - dom was a midget. Compared to the greatness of their capi- t als—Babylon, Nineveh, Thebes—with their sacred precincts, ziggurats, temples, processional ways, ornate gates, majestic palaces, hanging gardens, sacred pools, and river harbors—Jerualem was a small city with hastily built walls and an iffy water supply. And yet, millennia later, it is Jerusalem, a living city, that is in our hearts and in the daily headlines, while the grandeur of the other nations’ capitals has turned to dust and crumbled ruins. What made the difference? The Temple of Yahweh that w as built in Jerusalem, and its Prophets whose oracles came true. Their prophecies, one therefore believes, still hold the key to the Future. The Hebrew association with Jerusalem, and in particular w ith Mount Moriah, goes back to the time of Abraham. It was when he had fulfilled his assignment of protecting the spaceport during the War of the Kings that he was greeted by Malkizedek, the king of Ir-Shalem ( Jerusalem), “who was a priest of the God Most High.” There Abraham was blessed,"},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"178 THE END OF DAYS and in turn took an oath, “by the God Most High, possessor o f Heaven and Earth.” It was again there, when Abraham’s devotion was tested, that he was granted a Covenant with God. Yet it took a millennium, until the right time and cir - cumstances, for the Temple to be built. The Bible asserted that the Jerusalem temple was unique— a nd so indeed it was: it was conceived to preserve the “Bond Heaven-Earth” that the DUR.AN.KI of Sumer’s Nippur had once been. And it came to pass in the fourhundred and eightieth year after the Children of Israel came out of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign, in the second month, that he began to build the House of the Lord. Thus does the Bible record, in the first Book of Kings (6:1), the memorable start of the construction of the Temple of Yahweh in Jerusalem by King Solomon, giving us the exact date of the event. It was a crucial, decisive step whose conse - quences are still with us; and t he time, it must be noted, was when Babylon and Assyria adopted the Sign of the Cross as the harbinger of the Return . . . The dramatic story of the Jerusalem Temple starts not wi th Solomon but with King David, Solomon’s father; and how he happened to become Israel’s king is a tale that reveals a divine plan: to prepare for the Future by resurrecting the Past. David’s legacy (after a reign of 40 years) included a greatly e xpanded realm, reaching in the north as far as Damascus (and including the Landing Place!), many magnificent Psalms, and the groundwork for Yahweh’s temple. Three divine emissaries played key roles in the making of this king and his place in history; the Bible lists them as “Sam - uel the Seer, Nathan the Prophet, and Gad the Visionary.” It w as Samuel, the custodian-priest of the Ark of the Covenant, who was instructed by God to “take the youth David, son of Jesse, from herding sheep to be shepherd of Israel,” and"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"179 The Day of the Lord Samuel “took the oil-filled horn and anointed him to reign over Israel.” The choosing of the young David, who was shepherding h is father’s flock, to be shepherd over Israel was doubly sym - bolic, for it harks back to the golden age of Sumer. Its kings w ere called LU.GAL, “Great Man,” but they strove to earn the cherished title EN.SI, “Righteous Shepherd.” That, as we shall see, was only the beginning of David’s and the Temple’s links to the Sumerian past. David began his reign in Hebron, south of Jerusalem, and t hat, too, was a choice filled with historic symbolism. The previous name of Hebron, the bible repeatedly pointed out, was Kiryat Arba , “the fortified city of Arba.” And who was Arba? “He was a Great Man of the Anakim ”—two biblical terms that render in Hebrew the Sumerian LU.GAL and ANUNNAKI. Starting with passages in the book of Num - bers, a nd then in Joshua , Judges, and Chronicles, the Bible reported that Hebron was a center of the descendants of the “Anakim, who as the Nefilim are counted,” thus connecting them to the Nefilim of Genesis 6 who intermarried with the Daughters of Adam. Hebron was still inhabited at the time of the Exodus by three sons of Arba, and it was Caleb the son of Jephoneh who captured the city and slew them in behalf of Joshua. By choosing to be king in Hebron, David estab - lished his kingship as a direct continuation of kings linked t o the Anunnaki of Sumerian lore. He reigned in Hebron for seven years, and then moved h is capital to Jerusalem. His seat of kingship—the “City of David”—was built on Mount Zion, just south of and sepa - rated by a small valley from Mount Moriah (where the plat - form built by the Anunnaki was, Fi g. 83 ). He constructed the Miloh , the Filling, to close the gap between the two mounts, as a first step to building, on the platform, Yahweh’s temple; but all he was allowed to erect on Mount Moriah was an al - tar. God’s word, through the Prophet Nathan, was that be - cause David had shed blood in his many wars, not he but his son S olomon would build the temple. Devastated by the prophet’s message, David went and “sat b efore Yahweh,” in front of the Ark of the Covenant (which"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"180 THE END OF DAYS Figure 83 was still housed in a portable tent). Accepting God’s decision, he asked for one reward for his devout loyalty to Him: an as - surance, a sign, that it would indeed be the House of David t hat would build the Temple and be forever blessed. That very night, sitting in front of the Ark of the Covenant by which Moses had communicated with the Lord, he received a di - vine sign: he was given a Tavnit— a sc ale model — of the fu - ture temple!

The Hebrew term Ta vnit is translated in the King James English Bible “pattern” but is rendered “plan” in more recent translations, suggesting that David was given some kind of an architectural drawing. But the Hebrew word for “plan” is Tokh nit . Tavnit , on the other hand, is derived from the root verb that means “to construct, to build, to erect,” so what David was given and what he handed over to his son Solo - mon was a “constructed model”—in today’s parlance, a scale mo del. (Archaeological finds throughout the ancient Near East have indeed unearthed scale models of chariots, wag - ons, ships, workshops, and even multilevel shrines.) The biblical books of Kings an d Chronicle s provide pre - cise measurements and clear structural details of the Temple a nd its architectural designs. Its axis ran east–west, making it an “eternal temple” aligned to the equinox. Consisting of three parts (see Fig. 64), it adopted the Sumerian temple plans of a forepart ( Ulam in Hebrew), a great central hall ( Hekhal in Hebrew, stemming from the Sumerian E.GAL, “Large Abode”), and a Holy of Holies for the Ark of the Cov - enant. That innermost section was called the Dv ir (the “Speaker”)—for it was by means of the Ark of the Covenant that God spoke to Moses. As in Sumerian ziggurats, which traditionally were built to e xpress the sexagesimal’s “base sixty” concept, the Tem - ple of Solomon also adopted sixty in its construction: the m ain section (the Hall) was 60 cubits (about 100 feet) in length, 20 cubits (60:3) wide, and 120 (60 × 2) cubits in height. The Holy of Holies was 20 by 20 cubits—just enough to hold the Ark of the Covenant with the two golden Cher - ubim atop it (“their wings touching”). Tradition, textual evi -"},{"pageNumber":189,"pageContent":"182 THE END OF DAYS dence, and archaeological research indicate that the Ark was p laced precisely on the extraordinary rock on which Abra - ham was ready to sacrifice his son Isaac; its Hebrew designa - tion, Ev en Shatiyah , means “Foundation Stone,” and Jewish legends hold that it is from it that the world will be re-cre- ated. Nowadays it is covered over and surrounded by the Dome of the Rock (Fig. 84) . (Readers can find more about the sacred rock and its enigmatic cave and secret subterra- nean passages in T he Earth Chronicles Expeditions. ) Though these were not monumental measurements com - pared to the skyscraping ziggurats, the Temple, when com - pleted, was truly magnificent; it was also unlike any other c ontemporary temple in that part of the world. No iron or iron tools were used for its erection upon the platform (and absolutely none in its operation—all the utensils were of cop - per or bronze), and th e building was inlaid inside with gold; even the nails holding the golden plates in place were made of gold. The quantities of gold used ( just “for the Holy of Figure 84"},{"pageNumber":190,"pageContent":"183 The Day of the Lord Holies, 600 talents; for the nails, fifty shekels”) were enor- mous —so much so that Solomon arranged for special ships to bring gold from Ophir (believed to be in southeast Af - rica). The Bible offers no explanation, neither for the prohibi - tion against using anything made of iron on the site nor for th e inlaying of everything inside the temple with gold. One can only speculate that iron was shunned because of its magnetic properties, and gold because it is the best elec - trical conductor. It is significant that the only two other known instances of s hrines so inlaid with gold are on the other side of the world. One is the great temple in Cuzco, the Inca capital in Peru, where the great god of South America, Viracocha, was wor - shipped. It was called the Coricancha (“ Golden Enclosure”), for its Holy of Holies was completely inlaid with gold. The other is in Puma-Punku on the shores of Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, near the famed ruins of Tiwanaku. The ruins there consist of the remains of four chamberlike stone buildings whose walls, floors, and ceilings were each cut out of a sin- gle colossal stone block. The four enclosures were completely i nlaid inside with golden plates that were held in place with golden nails. Describing the sites (and how they were looted by the Spaniards) in The Lost Realms , I have suggested that Puma-Punku was erected for the stay of Anu and Antu when they visited Earth circa 4000 b.c.e. According to the Bible, tens of thousands of workmen were ne eded for seven years for the immense undertaking. What, then, was the purpose of this House of the Lord? When all was ready, with much pomp and circumstance, the Ark of the Cov - enant was carried by priests and placed in the Holy of Holies. A s soon as the Ark was put down and the curtains separating the Holy of Holies from the great hall were drawn, “the House of the Lord was filled with a cloud and the priests could not remain standing.” Then Solomon offered a thanksgiving prayer, saying: Lord who has chosen to dwell in the cloud: I h ave built for Thee a stately House,"},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"184 THE END OF DAYS a place where you may dwell forever . . .

From heaven I will hear the prayers of my people and forgive their transgressions . . . Now I have chosen and consecrated this House for my Shem to remain there forever” ( II Chronicles, Chapters 6–7). The word Shem — here and earlier, as in the opening verses of chapter 6 of Genesis —is commonly translated “Name.” As far back as in my first book, The Twelfth Planet , I have sug - gested that the term originally and in the relevant context re - ferred to what the Egyptians called the “Celestial Boat” and t he Sumerians called MU—“sky ship”—of the gods. Accord - ingly, the Temple in Jerusalem, built atop the stone platform, w ith the Ark of the Covenant placed upon the sacred rock, was to serve as an earthly bond with the celestial deity—both for communicating and for the landing of his sky ship! Throughout the Temple there was no statue, no idol, no g raven image. The only object within it was the hallowed Ark of the Covenant—and “there was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets that were given to Moses in Sinai.” Unlike the Mesopotamian ziggurat temples, from Enlil’s i n Nippur to Marduk’s in Babylon, this one was not a place of residence for the deity, where the god lived, ate, slept, and bathed. It was a House of Worship, a place of divine con- tact; it was a temple for a Divine Presence by the Dweller i n the Clouds. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words; it is cer - tainly true where there are few pertinent words but many re levant pictures.

T hey showed, most clearly, the god Ashur as a “dweller of the clouds,” full face or with just his hand showing, fre - quently depicted holding a bow (Fig. 85) — a depiction re - minding one of the Bible’s tale of the Bow in the Cloud that w as a divine sign in the aftermath of the Deluge. A century or so later, Assyrian depictions introduced a ne w variant of the God in the Cloud. Classified as “Deity in a Winged Disc,” they clearly showed a deity inside the emblem of the Winged Disc, by itself (Fig. 86a) or as it joins the Earth (seven dots) and the Moon (crescent) (Fig. 86b) . Since the Winged Disc represented Nibiru, it had to be a deity arriving with Nibiru . Clearly, then, these depictions implied expecta - tions of the nearing arrival not only of the planet, but also o f its divine dwellers, probably led by Anu himself. The changes in glyphs and symbols, begun with the Sign of t he Cross, were manifestations of more profound expectations, of overwhelming changes and wider preparations called for by the expected Return. However, the expectations and prepara - tions were not the same in Babylon as in Assyria. In one, the mess ianic expectations were centered on the god(s) who were already there; in the other, the expectations related to the god(s) about to return and reappear.

With unparalleled ferocity, its kings set out on one military campaign after an - other not only to have dominion over the olden Sumer & A kkad, but also over what they deemed essential for the Re - turn: Co ntrol of the space-related sites.

Frequently bearing the sa me name as previous glorified kings (hence the numera - tions I, II, III, etc. for them), the successive kings expanded A ssyrian control in all directions, but with special emphasis on the coastal cities and mountains of La-ba-an (Lebanon). Circa 860 b.c.e.

The Prophet Ezekiel castigated the king of Tyre for deeming him - self a god because he had been to that sacred place and “mo ved within its fiery stones”; and the Prophet Amos listed it when he spoke of the coming Day of the Lord .

In his best-known inscribed monument, the Black Obelisk, Shalmaneser III recorded the receipt of tribute from the Israelite king Jehu and, in a scene dominated by the Winged Disc emblem of Nibiru, depicted him kneeling in obeisance (Fig. 88) . Both the Bible and the Assyrian annals recorded the subsequent invasion of Israel by Tiglath-Pileser III (744–727 b.c.e. ), the detaching of its better provinces, and the partial exile of its leaders. Then, in 722 b.c.e. , his son Shalmaneser V overran what was left of Israel, exiled all of its people, and replaced them with for - eigners; the Ten Tribes were gone, their whereabouts re - maining a lasting mystery.

After the capture of the space-related site in Lebanon— bu t before launching the campaigns toward Jerusalem—the Assyrians took an unprecedented step for reconciliation with Marduk. In 729 b.c.e. Tiglath-Pileser III entered Babylon, went to its sacred precinct, and “took the hands of Marduk.” It was a gesture with great religious and diplomatic signifi - cance; the priests of Marduk approved the reconciliation by i nviting Tiglath-Pileser to share in the god’s sacramental meal. Following that, Tiglath-Pileser’s son Sargon II marched southward into the olden Sumer & Akkad areas, and after seizing Nippur turned back to enter Babylon. In 710 b.c.e. he, like his father, “took the hands of Marduk” during the New Year ceremonies. The task of capturing the remaining space-related site fell to S argon’s successor, Sennacherib. The assault on Jerusalem in 704 b.c.e. , at the time of its King Hezekiah, is amply re - corded both in Sennacherib’s annals and in the Bible. But w hile Sennacherib in his inscriptions spoke just of the suc - cessful seizing of Judean provincial cities, the Bible provides a det ailed tale of the siege of Jerusalem by a mighty Assyr - ian army that was miraculously wiped out by Yahweh’s will. Encircling Jerusalem and entrapping its people, the Assyr - ians engaged in psychological warfare by shouting discour - aging words to the defenders on the city’s walls, ending with v ilification of Yahweh. The shocked king, Hezekiah, tore his clothes in mourning and prayed in the Temple to “Yahweh, the God of Israel, who rests upon the Cherubim, the sole God upon all the nations,” for help. In response, the Prophet Isa - iah conveyed to him God’s oracle: the Assyrian king shall ne ver enter the city, he will return home in failure, and there he will be assassinated. And it came to pass that night that the Angel of Yahweh went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand."},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"191 The Day of the Lord And at sunrise, lo and behold, they were all dead corpses. So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, departed and journeyed back to his abode in Nineveh 2 Kings 19: 35–36 To make sure the reader realizes that the whole prophecy ca me true, the biblical narrative then continues: “And Sen - nacherib went away, and journeyed back to Nineveh; and it was w hen he was bowing down in his temple to his god . . . that Adramelekh and Sharezzer struck him down with a sword, and they fled to the land of Ararat. His son Esarhaddon be - came king in his stead.” The biblical postscript is an amazingly informed record: Sen nacherib was indeed murdered, by his own sons, in 681 b.c.e. For the second time, Assyrian kings who attacked Is- rael or Judea were dead as soon as they went back. While prophecy—the foretelling of what is yet to happen—is i nherently what is expected of a prophet, the Prophets of the Hebrew Bible were more than that. From the very beginning, as was made clear in Leviticus, a prophet was not to be “a ma - gician, a wizard, an enchanter, a charmer or seer of spirits, a f ortune-teller, or one who conjures the dead”—a pretty com - prehensive list of the varied fortune-tellers of the surrounding nat ions. Their mission as Nabih —“Spokesmen”—was to con- vey to kings and peoples Yahweh’s own words. And as Heze- k iah’s prayer made clear, while the Children of Israel were His Chosen People, He was “sole God upon all the nations .” The Bible speaks of prophets from Moses on, but only f ifteen of them have their own books in the Bible. They in - clude the three “majors”—Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel— a nd twelve “minors.” Their prophetic period began with Amos in Judea (circa 760 b.c.e . ) and Hoseah in Israel (750 b.c.e. ) and ended with Malachi (circa 450 b.c.e. ). As expec - tations of the Return took shape, geopolitics, religion, and a ctual happenings combined to serve as the foundation of biblical Prophecy. The biblical Prophets served as Keepers of the Faith and"},{"pageNumber":199,"pageContent":"192 THE END OF DAYS were the moral and ethical compass of their own kings and p eople; they were also observers and predictors on the world arena by possessing uncannily accurate knowledge of go- ings-on in distant lands, of court intrigues in foreign capitals, of which gods were worshipped where, plus amazing knowl - edge of history, geography, trade routes, and military cam - paigns. T hey then combined such awareness of the Present with knowledge of the Past to foretell the Future. To the Hebrew Prophets, Yahweh was not only El Elyon— “God Supreme”—and not only God of the gods, El Elohim , but a Universal God—of all nations, of the whole Earth, of the universe. Though His abode was in the Heaven of Heav - ens, He cared for his creation—Earth and its people. Every - thing that has happened was by His will, and His will was ca rried out by Emissaries—be it Angels, be it a king, be it a nation. Adopting the Sumerian distinction between predeter - mined Destiny and free-willed Fate, the Prophets believed t hat the Future could be foretold because it was all pre - planned, yet on the way thereto, things could change. As - syria, for example, was at times called God’s “rod of wrath” wi th which other nations were punished, but when it chose to act unnecessarily brutally or out of bounds, Assyria itself was in turn subjected to punishment. The Prophets seemed to be delivering a two-track message n ot only in regard to current events, but also in respect to the Future. Isaiah, for example, prophesied that Mankind should expect a Day of Wrath when all the nations (Israel included) shall be judged and punished—as well as look forward to an idyllic time when the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, men shall beat their swords into plowshares, and Zion shall be a light unto all nations. The contradiction has baffled generations of biblical sc holars and theologians, but a close examination of the Prophets’ words leads us to an astounding finding: the Day of Judgment was spoken of as the Day of the Lord ; the mes - sianic time was expected at the End of Days ; a nd the two were neither synonymous nor predicted as concurrent events. They were two separate events, due to occur at different times:"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"193 The Day of the Lord One, the Day of the Lord, a day of God’s judgment, was a bout to happen; The other, ushering a benevolent era, was yet to come, so metime in the future. Did the words spoken in Jerusalem echo the debates in N ineveh and Babylon regarding which time cycle applies to the future of gods and men—Nibiru’s orbital Divine Time or the zodiacal Celestial Time? Undoubtedly, as the eighth century b.c.e. was ending, it was clear in all three capitals that the two time cycles were not identical; and in Jerusa - lem, speaking of the coming Day of the Lord, the biblical p rophets in fact spoke of the Return of Nibiru. Ever since it rendered in the opening chapter of Ge nesis an abbreviated version of the Sumerian Epic of Creation, the Bi - ble recognized the existence of Nibiru and its periodic return to E arth’s vicinity, and treated it as another—in this case, ce- lestial—manifestation of Yahweh as a Universal God. The Psalms and the Book of Job spoke of the unseen Celestial Lord that “in the heights of heaven marked out a circuit.” They recalled this Celestial Lord’s first appearance—when he collided with Tiamat (called in the Bible Teh o m and nick - named Ra hab or Rabah , the Haughty One), smote her, cre - ated the heavens and “the Hammered Bracelet” (the Asteroid B elt), and “suspended the Earth in the void”; they also re - called the time when that celestial Lord caused the Deluge. The arrival of Nibiru and the celestial collision, leading to N ibiru’s great orbital circuit, were celebrated in the majestic Psalm 19: The heavens bespeak the glory of the Lord; The Hammered Bracelet proclaims his handiwork . . . He comes forth as a groom from the canopy; Like an athlete he rejoices to run the course. From the end of the heavens he emanates, and his circuit is to their end.

The Prophets considered those earlier phenomena as the g uide for what to expect. They expected the Day of the Lord (to quote the Prophet Joel) to be a day when “the Earth shall be agitated, Sun and Moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withhold their shining . . . A day that is great and terri - fying.” The Prophets brought the word of Yahweh to Israel and all nat ions over a period of about three centuries. The earliest of the fifteen Literary Prophets was Amos; he began to be God’s spokesman (“ Nabih ”) circa 760 b.c.e. His prophecies covered three periods or phases: he predicted the Assyrian assaults in the near future, a coming Day of Judgment, and an Endtime of peace and plenty. Speaking in the name of “the Lord Yahweh who reveals His secrets to the Prophets,” he described the Day of the Lord as a day when “the Sun shall set at noon and the Earth shall darken in the midst of daytime.” Addressing those who worship the “planets and star of their gods,” he compared the coming Day to the events of the Deluge, when “the day darkened as night, and the waters of the seas poured upon the earth;” and he warned those worshippers with a rhetorical question ( Amos 5: 18): Woe unto you that desire the Day of the Lord! To what end is it for you? For the day of the Lord is darkness and no light.

The heavens shall be agitated and the Earth in its place will be shaken; When the Lord of Hosts sh all be crossing on the day of his wrath. Most noticeable in this prophecy is the identification of t he Day of the Lord as the time when “the Lord of Hosts”— the celestial, the planetary lord—“ shall be crossing .” This is the very language used in Enuma elish when it describes how the invader that battled Tiamat came to be called NIB - IRU: “ Crossin g shall be its name!” Following Isaiah, the Prophet Hosea also foresaw the Day o f the Lord as a day when Heaven and Earth shall “respond” to each other—a day of celestial phenomena resonating on Earth. As we continue to examine the prophecies chronologi - cally, we find that in the seventh century b.c.e . the prophetic pronouncements became more urgent and more explicit: the Day of the Lord shall be a Day of Judgment upon the nations, Israel included, but primarily upon Assyria for what it has done and upon Babylon for what it will do, and the Day is approaching, it is near — The great Day of the Lord is approaching— It is n ear!"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"196 THE END OF DAYS The sound of the Lord’s Day hasteth greatly.

To judge by their written records and engraved images, t hey were expecting the resolution of the gods’ conflicts, benevolent times for mankind, and a great theophany. They were in, as we shall see, for an immense surprise. In anticipation of the great event, the cadres of priests ob - serving the skies in Nineveh and Babylon were mobilized to n ote celestial phenomena and interpret their omens. The phe - nomena were meticulously recorded and reported to the k ings. Archaeologists have found in the remains of royal and temple libraries tablets with those records and reports that in many instances were arranged according to subject or the planet they were observing. A well-known collection in which some seventy tablets were combined—in antiquity— was a series titled Enuma Anu Enlil ; it reported observations of planets, stars, and constellations classified according to the celestial Way of Anu and Way of Enlil—encompassing the skies from 30 degrees south all the way to zenith in the north (see Fig. 53). At first the observations were interpreted by comparing t he phenomena to astronomical records from Sumerian times. Though written in Akkadian (Babylon’s and Assyria’s language), the observational reports extensively used Sume - rian terminology and mathematics and sometimes included a sc ribal note that they were translated from earlier Sumerian tablets.

When a comet reaches the path of the Sun: Field-flow will be diminished, an uproar will happen twice. When Jupiter goes with Venus: The prayers of the land will reach the gods. As time went on, the reports were increasingly of observa- tions accompanied by the omen-priests’ own interpretations: “ In the night Saturn came near to the Moon. Saturn is a planet of the Sun. This is the meaning: It is favorable to the king.” The noticeable change included the paying of particu - lar attention to eclipses; a tablet (now in the British Museum), l isting computerlike columns of numbers, served to predict lunar eclipses fifty years in advance. Modern studies have concluded that the change to the new s tyle of topical astronomy took place in the eighth century b.c.e. when, after a period of mayhem and royal upheavals in B abylon and Assyria, the two lands’ fates were placed in new and strong royal hands: Tiglath-Pileser III (745–727 b.c.e. ) in Assyria and Nabunassar (747–734 b.c.e. ) in Babylonia. Nabunassar (“By Nabu protected”) was hailed, already in a ntiquity, as an innovator and powerhouse in the field of as - tronomy. One of his first actions was to repair and restore the t emple of Shamash in Sippar, the Sun-god’s “cult center” in ancient Sumer. He also built a new observatory in Babylon, updated the calendar (a heritage from Nippur), and instituted daily reporting to the king of the celestial phenomena and their meaning. It was primarily due to those measures that a wealth of astronomical data, shedding light on subsequent events, has come to light. Tiglath-Pileser III was also active, in his own ways.

His role, and those of his successors Shal - maneser V and Sargon II, in the demise of Israel and the ex - ile of its people (the Ten Lost Tribes), and then the attempt by Sen nacherib to seize Jerusalem, were described in the previ - ous chapter. Closer to home, those Assyrian kings were busy a nnexing Babylonia by “taking the hands of Marduk.” The next Assyrian king, Esarhaddon (680–669 b.c.e. ), announced that “both Ashur and Marduk gave me wisdom,” swore oaths in the name of Marduk and Nabu, and started to rebuild the Esagil temple in Babylon. In history books, Esarhaddon is mainly remembered for h is successful invasion of Egypt (675–669 b.c.e. ). The inva- sion’s purpose, as far as it could be ascertained, was to stop Egyptian attempts to “meddle in Canaan” and dominate Jerusalem. Noteworthy, in the light of subsequent events, was the route he chose: instead of going the shortest way, to the southwest, he made a considerable detour and went northward, to Harran . There, in the olden temple of the god Sin, Esarhaddon sought that god’s blessing to embark on the conquest; and Sin, leaning on a staff and accompa - nied by Nusku (the Divine Messenger of the gods), gave his appro val. Esarhaddon then did turn southward, sweeping mightily t hrough the lands of the eastern Mediterranean to reach Egypt. Significantly, he detoured away from the prize that Sennacherib failed to seize—Jerusalem. Significantly, too, that invasion of Egypt and the detour away from Jerusa- lem—as well as Assyria’s own eventual fate—had been prophesied by Isaiah decades earlier (10: 24–32). Busy geopolitically as Esarhaddon was, he did not neglect th e astronomical requirements of those times. With guid - ance from the gods Shamash and Adad, he erected in Ashur ( the city, Assyria’s cult center) a “House of Wisdom”—an observatory—and depicted the complete twelve-member so - lar system, including Nibiru, on his monuments ( Fig. 89) .

When the Planet of the Throne of Heaven will grow brighter, there will be floods and rains. When Nibiru attains its perigee, the gods will give peace. Troubles will be cleared up, complications will be unravelled. Clearly, the expectation was of a planet that will appear, r ise in the skies, grow brighter, and at its perigee, at the Crossing, become NIBIRU (the Cross Planet). And as the gateway and other construction indicated, with the returning planet a repeat of the previous visit to Earth by Anu was expected. It was now up to the astronomer-priests to watch the heavens for that planetary appearance; but where were they to look in the celestial expanse, and how would they recognize the planet when still in the distant skies? The next Assyrian king, Ashurbanipal (668–630 b.c.e . ), came up with a solution. Historians consider Ashurbanipal to have been the most sc holarly of the Assyrian kings, for he had learnt other lan- guages besides Akkadian, including Sumerian, and claimed t hat he could even read “writings from before the Flood.” He also boasted that he “learnt the secret signs of Heaven and Earth . . . and studied the heavens with the masters of divina - tion.” Some modern researchers also consider him to have been “ The First Archaeologist,” for he systematically collected tablets from sites that were already ancient in his time—like"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"203 Darkness at Noon Nippur, Uruk, and Sippar in what used to be Sumer. He also sen t specialized teams to sort out and loot such tablets from the capitals that the Assyrians overran. The tablets ended up in a famed library where teams of scribes studied, translated, and copied chosen texts from the previous millennia. (A visi - tor to the Museum of the Ancient Near East in Istanbul can se e a display of such tablets, neatly arranged on the original shelves, with each shelf headed by a “catalog tablet” that lists all the texts on that shelf .) While the subjects in the accumulated tablets covered a wi de range, what was found indicates that particular atten - tion was given to celestial information. Among the purely a stronomical texts there were tablets that belonged to a se - ries titled “ T he day of Bel ”—the Day of the Lord! In addi - tion, epic tales and histories pertaining to the gods’ comings a nd goings were deemed important, especially if they shed light on Nibiru’s passages. Enuma elish —the Epic of Cre - ation that told how an invading planet joined the solar sys - tem to become Nibiru—was copied, translated, and recopied; so w ere writings dealing with the Great Flood, such as the Atra-Hasis Epic and the Epic of Gilgamesh . While they all seem to legitimately be part of accumulating knowledge in a royal library, it so happens that they all dealt with instances of Nibiru’s appearances in the past —and thus with its next nearing. Among the purely astronomical texts translated and, un - doubtedly, carefully studied, were guidelines for observing N ibiru’s arrival and for recognizing it on its appearance. A Babylonian text that retained the original Sumerian termi - nology stated: Planet of the god Marduk: Upon its appearance SHUL.PA.E; Rising thirty degrees, SAG.ME.NIG; When it stands in the middle of the sky: NIBIRU.

A similar text from N ippur, rendering the Sumerian planetary names as UMUN.PA.UD.DU and SAG.ME.GAR, suggested that the arrival of Nibiru will be “announced” by the planet Saturn, and after rising 30 degrees will be near Jupiter. Other texts (e.g., a tablet known as K.3124) state that after passing SHUL.PA.E and SAG.ME.GAR—which I believe mean Sat - urn and Jupiter—“Planet Marduk” will “enter the Sun” (i.e., rea ch Perigee, closest to the Sun) and “become Nibiru.” Other texts provide clearer clues in regard to Nibiru’s path, a s well as to the time frame for its appearance: From the station of Jupiter, the planet passes toward the west. * The extensive astronomical data that have been found attracted, already in the 19th and early in the 20th centuries, the time, attention, and pa - tience of scholarly giants who brilliantly combined “Assyriology” with k nowledge of astronomy. The very first book of The Earth Chronicles, The 12th Planet , covered and used the work and achievements of the likes of Franz Kugler, Ernst Weidner, Erich Ebeling, Herman Hilprecht, Alfred Jeremias, Morris Jastrow, Albert Schott, and Th. G. Pinches, among oth - ers. Their task was complicated by the fact that the same kak kabu (a ny celestial body, including planets, fixed stars, and constellations) could have more than one name. I also pointed out right then and there the most basic failing of their work: they all assumed that the Sumerians and other ancient peoples had no way of knowing (“with the naked eye”) about plan - ets beyond Saturn. The result was that whenever a planet was named other t han the accepted names for the “seven known kakkabani ”—Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn—it was assumed to just be yet an - other name for one of those “known seven.” The principal victim of that e rroneous stance was Nibiru; whenever it or its Babylonian equivalent “planet Marduk” was listed, it was assumed to be another name for Jupiter or Mars or (in some extreme views) even for Mercury. Incredibly, modern establishment astronomers continue to base their work on that “only seven” assumption—in spite of the vast contrary evidence that shows that the Sumerians knew the true shape and composition of our solar system, starting with the naming of the outer planets in Enuma elish , or the 4,500- year-old depiction of the complete twelve-member solar system, with the Sun in the center, on cylinder seal VA/243 in the Berlin Museum (Fig. 91) , or the depiction of twelve planetary symbols on Assyrian and Babylonian monuments, etc."},{"pageNumber":212,"pageContent":"205 Darkness at Noon Figure 91 From the station of Jupiter the planet increases its brilliance, and in the zodiac of Cancer will become Nibiru.

At its perigee, when it is closest to the Sun (and thus to Earth), the planet—at the Crossing—be- comes Nibiru “in the zodiac of Cancer.” That, as the en- closed schematic (and not to scale) diagram shows, could happ en only when sunrise on the day of the Spring Equinox took place in the Age of the Ram—during the zodiacal age of Aries (Fig. 92) .

It is a trajectory, on a vaster scale, akin to that of Ha lley’s comet (see Fig. 78). A telling clue in regard to Ashurbanipal’s expectations w as the meticulous rendering into Akkadian of Sumerian descriptions of the ceremonies attending the state visit of Anu and Antu to Earth circa 4000 b.c.e.

One can reasonably conclude that Ashurbanipal was en - gaged in collecting, collating, translating, and studying all t he earlier texts that could (a) provide guidance to the as- tronomer-priests for detecting, at the first possible moment, the returning Nibiru and (b) inform the king about the proce - dures for what to do next. Calling the planet “Planet of the He avenly Throne” is an important clue to the royal expecta - tions, as were the depictions on palace walls, in magnificent r eliefs, of Assyrian kings greeting the god in the Winged Disc as it hovered above the Tree of Life (as in Fig. 87). It was important to be informed of the planet’s appearance a s soon as possible in order to be able to prepare the proper reception for the arrival of the great god depicted within it—Anu himself? —and be blessed with long, perhaps even eternal, Life. But that was not destined to be. Soon after Ashurbanipal’s death, rebellions broke out t hroughout the Assyrian empire. His sons’ hold on Egypt, Babylonia, and Elam disintegrated. Newcomers from afar ap - peared on the borders of the Assyrian empire—“hordes” from t he north, Medes from the east. Everywhere, local kings seized control and declared independence. Of particular impor- tance—immediate and for future events—was Babylon’s “de - coupling” of the dual kingship with Assyria. As part of the N ew Year festival in 626 b.c.e. a Babylonian general whose name—Nabupolassar (“Nabu his son protects”)—implied that he claimed to be a son of the god Nabu, was enthroned as king of an independent Babylonia. A tablet described the start of his investiture ceremony thus: “The princes of the land were assembled; they blessed Nabupolassar; opening their fists, they declared him sovereign; Marduk in the assembly of the gods gave the Standard of Power to Nabupolassar.” The resentment of Assyria’s brutal rule was so great that"},{"pageNumber":215,"pageContent":"208 THE END OF DAYS Nabupolassar of Babylon soon found allies for military ac - tion against Assyria. A principal and freshly vigorous ally w as the Medes (precursors of the Persians), who had experi - enced Assyrian incursions and brutality. While Babylonian t roops were advancing into Assyria from the south, the Medes attacked from the east, and in 614 b.c.e. —as had been prophesied by the Hebrew Prophets!—captured and burned down Assyria’s religious capital, Ashur. The turn of Nineveh, the royal capital, came next. By 612 b.c.e. the great Assyria was in shambles . Assyria—the land of the “First Archaeologist”—itself became a land of archaeological sites. How could that happen to the land whose very name meant “ Land of the god Ashur”? The only explanation at the time was that the gods withdrew their protection from that land; in fact, we shall show, there was much more to it: the gods themselves withdrew—from that land and from Earth. And then the most astounding and final chapter of the R eturn Saga, in which Harran was to play a key role, began to unfold. The amazing chain of events after the demise of Assyria be - gan with the escape to Harra n of members of Assyria’s royal family. Seeking there the protection of the god Sin, the escapees rallied the remnants of the Assyrian army and pro - claimed one of the royal refugees as “King of Assyria”; but t he god, whose city Harran has been since days of yore, did not respond. In 610 b.c.e. Babylonian troops captured Harran and put an end to the Assyrians’ lingering hopes . The contest for the mantle of successorship to the heritage o f Sumer and Akkad was over; it was now worn solely, and with divine blessing, by the king in Babylon. Again, Babylon ruled the lands that were once the hallowed “Sumer & Ak- kad”—so much so that in many texts from that time, Nabu - polassar was given the title “King of Akkad.” He used that au thority to extend the celestial observations to the erstwhile Sumerian cities of Nippur and Uruk, and some of the key observational texts from the subsequent crucial years come from there. It was in that same fateful year, 610 b.c.e. —a memorable"},{"pageNumber":216,"pageContent":"209 Darkness at Noon year of astounding events, as we shall see—that a reinvigo - rated Egypt also placed on its throne an assertive strongman na med Necho. Just one year later one of the least under- stood—by historians, that is—geopolitical moves then took place. The Egyptians, who used to be on the same side as the Babylonians in opposition to Assyrian rule, emerged from Egypt and, rushing northward, overran territories and sacred sites that the Babylonians considered theirs. The Egyptian advance, all the way north to Carchemish, put them within striking distance of Harran; it also placed in Egyptian hands the two space-related sites, in Lebanon and in Judea. The surprised Babylonians were not going to let it stand. T he aging Nabupolassar entrusted the task of recapturing the vital places to his son Nebuchadnezzar, who had already distinguished himself on the battlefields. In June 605 b.c.e. , at Carchemish, the Babylonians crushed the Egyptian army, liberated “the sacred forest in Lebanon which Nabu and Marduk desired,” and chased the fleeing Egyptians all the way to the Sinai Peninsula. Nebuchadnezzar stopped the pursuit only on news from Babylon that his father had died. He rushed back, and was proclaimed King of Babylon that same year. Historians find no explanation for the sudden Egyptian t hrust and the ferocity of the Babylonian reaction. To us it is evident that at the core of the events was the expectation of the Return. Indeed, it seems that in that year 605 b.c.e. the Return was deemed to be imminent, perhaps even overdue; for it was in that very same year that the Prophet Habakkuk began to prophecy in the name of Yahweh, in Jerusalem. Uncannily foretelling the future of Babylon and other na - tions, the Prophet asked Yahweh when the Day of the Lord— a d ay of judgment upon the nations, Babylon included—would come, and Yahweh responded, saying: Write down the prophecy, explain it clearly on the tablets, so that it may be quickly read: For the vision there is a set time; In the end it shall come, without fail!"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"210 THE END OF DAYS Though it may tarry, wait for it; For it will surely come— For its appointed time it will not be delayed. Habakkuk 2: 2–3 (The “appointed time,” as we shall see, arrived precisely fifty years thereafter.)

To prepare Babylon for the expected Return, massive ren - ovation and construction works were quickly undertaken. T heir focal point was the sacred precinct, where the Esagil temple of Marduk (now simply called Bel/Ba’al , “The Lord”) was renovated and rebuilt, its seven-stage ziggurat readied for viewing from it the starry skies (Fig. 93) —just as had been done in Uruk when Anu had visited circa 4000 b.c.e.

Babylon, Ma rduk’s Eternal City, was readied to welcome the Return. “I have made the city of Babylon to be the foremost among a ll the countries and every habitation; its name I elevated to be the most praised of all the sacred cities,” Nebuchadnezzar wrote in his inscriptions. The expectation, it seems, was that the arriving god of the Winged Disk would come down at the Landing Place in Lebanon, then consummate the Return by entering Babylon through the new marvelous Processional Way and imposing gate (Fig. 94) —a gate named “Ishtar” (alias IN.ANNA), who had been “Anu’s beloved” in Uruk— another clue regarding whose Return was expected. Figure 94"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"212 THE END OF DAYS Accompanying these expectations was Babylon’s role as the ne w Navel of the Earth—inheriting the prediluvial status of Nippur as the DUR.AN.KI, the “Bond Heaven-Earth.” That this was now Babylon’s function was expressed by giving the ziggurat’s foundation platform the Sumerian name E.TEMEN. AN.KI (“Temple of the Foundation for Heaven-Earth”), stress - ing Babylon’s role as the new “Navel of the Earth”—a role c learly depicted on the Babylonian “Map of the World” (see Fig. 10). This was terminology that echoed the description of Jerusalem, with its Foundation Stone, serving as a link be - tween Earth and Heaven! But if that was what Nebuchadnezzar envisioned, then Ba bylon had to replace the existing post-Diluvial space link—Jerusalem. Having taken over Nippur’s prediluvial role to serve as M ission Control Center after the Deluge, Jerusalem was lo - cated at the center of concentric distances to the other space- re lated sites (see Fig. 3). Calling it the “Navel of the Earth” (38: 12), the Prophet Ezekiel announced that Jerusalem has b een chosen for this role by God himself: Thus has said the Lord Yahweh: This is Jerusalem; In the midst of the nations I placed her, and all the lands are in a circle round about her.

The city itself and the Temple were left intact this time, bu t eleven years later, in 587 b.c.e. , the Babylonians returned in force. Acting this time, according to the Bible, on their own volition, the Babylonians put the torch to the Temple that Solomon built. In his inscriptions Nebuchadnezzar of - fered no explanation other than the usual one—to carry out t he wishes of and to please “my gods Nabu and Marduk”; but as we shall soon show, the real reason was a simple one: a belief that Yahweh had departed and was gone. The destruction of the Temple was a shocking and evil de ed for which Babylon and its king—previously deemed by the Prophets to have been Yahweh’s “rod of wrath”—were to be severely punished: “The vengeance of Yahweh our God, vengeance for His Temple ,” shall be meted out to Babylon, announced the Prophet Jeremiah (50: 28). Predicting the fall of mighty Babylon and its destruction by invaders from the north—events that came true just a few decades later—Jere- miah also proclaimed the fate of the gods whom Nebuchad - nezzar had invoked: Declare among the nations and proclaim, Raise the sign, announce, do not conceal, Say: Captured is Babylon!

The twelve zodiacal-calendrical segments were then superimposed on the three Ways, as shown by the dis - covered fragments ( Fig. 96) ; explanatory texts were written on the back sides of those circular tablets.

The debate over the identity of the celestial bod - ies (at the root of which lurks the notion of “nothing beyond S aturn”) and the meaning of the numbers has yet to end. Also unresolved is the issue of dating—in what year was the astrolabe made, and if it was a copy of an earlier tablet, what was the time shown? Dating opinions ranged from before the twelfth century to the third century b.c.e. ; most agreed, how - ever, that the astrolabe belonged to the era of Nebuchadnez - zar or his successor Nabuna’id. The astrolabe presented by Pinches was identified in the ens uing debates as “P,” but has been later renamed “Astro - labe A” because another one has since been pieced together a nd is known as “Astrolabe B.” Though the two astrolabes at first glance look identical, t hey are different—and for our analysis, the key difference is that in “B” the planet identified as mul Neberu deity Mar- duk —“Planet Nibiru of the god Marduk”—is shown in the Way of Anu, the central-ecliptic band (Fig. 98) , whereas in “A” the planet identified as mul Marduk —the “Planet of Marduk”—is shown in the Way of Enlil, in the northern skies (Fig. 99) . The change in name and position is absolutely correct if t he two astrolabes depict a moving planet— “Marduk” as it was called by the Babylonians—that, after having come into view high in the northern skies (as in “A”), curves down to cross the ecliptic and becomes NIBIRU (“Crossing”) when it crosses the ecliptic in the Way of Anu (as in “B”). The two- stage documentation by the two astrolabes depicts precisely what we have been asserting all along!

Though Nannar (“ Su- en, ” or Sin for short in Akkadian) was not Enlil’s firstborn legal heir—that rank belonged to Ninurta—he was the firstborn of Enlil and his spouse Ninlil, a firstborn on Earth. Gods and men greatly adored Nannar/ Sin and his spouse; the hymns in their honor in Sumer’s glo - rious times, and the lamentations about the desolation of S umer in general and Ur in particular, reveal the great love and admiration of the people for this divine couple. That many centuries later Esarhaddon went to consult with an ag - ing Sin (“leaning on a staff ”) regarding the invasion of E gypt, and that the escaping Assyrian royals made a last stand in Harran, serve to indicate the continued important role played by Nannar/Sin and Harran to the very end.

Then, in the desolate sacred precinct, she found a robe that ha d once belonged to Sin. To the despondent priestess, the find was an omen from the god: suddenly he had given her a physical presence of himself. She could not take her eyes off the sacred garb, not daring to touch it except by “taking hold of its hem.” As if the god himself was there to hear her, she prostrated herself and “in prayer and humility” uttered a vow: “If you would return to your city, all the Black-Headed people would worship your divinity!” “Black-Headed people” was a term by which the Sumeri - ans used to describe themselves, and the employment of the t erm by the high priestess some 1,500 years after Sumer was no more was full of significance: she was telling the god that were he to come back, he would be restored to lordship as in the Days of Old, become again the lord god of a restored Sumer and Akkad.

Ezekiel, a priest of Yahweh in Jerusalem, was among the a ristocracy and craftsmen who had been exiled, together with King Jehoiachin, after Nebuchadnezzar’s first attack on Jerusalem in 598 b.c.e. They were taken forcefully to north - ern Mesopotamia, settling in the district of the Khabur River, j ust a short distance away from their ancestral home in Harran. And it was there that Ezekiel’s famous vision of a celestial chariot had occurred. As a trained priest, he too re - corded the place and the date: it was on the fifth day of the f ourth month in the fifth year of the exile—594/593 b.c.e. — “when I was among the exiles on the banks of the river Khe - bar, that the heavens opened up and I saw visions of Elohim ,” Ez ekiel stated at the very beginning of his prophecies; and what he saw, appearing in a whirlwind, flashing lights and surrounded by a radiance, was a divine chariot that could go up and down and sideways, and within it, “upon the likeness of a throne, the semblance of a man”; and he heard a voice addressing him as “Son of Man” and announcing his pro - phetic assignment. The Prophet’s opening statement is usually translated “vi - sions of God . ” The term Elohim , which is plural, has been traditionally translated “God” in the singular, even when the Bible itself clearly treats it in the plural, as in “And Elohim said let us fashion the Adam in our image and after our like - ness” ( Ge nesis 1: 26). As readers of my books know, the biblical Adam tale is a rendering of the much more detailed Sumerian creation texts, where it was an Anunnaki team, led by Enki, that used genetic engineering to “fashion” the Adam. The term Elohim , we have shown over and over again, referred to the Anunnaki; and what Ezekiel reported was that he had encountered an Anunnaki celestial craft — near Harran."},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"230 THE END OF DAYS The celestial craft that was seen by Ezekiel was described b y him, in the opening chapter and thereafter, as the God’s Kavod (“That which is heavy”)—the very same term used in Exodus to describe the divine vehicle that had landed on Mount Sinai. The craft’s description rendered by Ezekiel has inspired generations of scholars and artists; the resulting de - pictions have changed with time, as our own technology of f light vehicles has advanced. Ancient texts refer both to spacecraft and aircraft, and describe Enlil, Enki, Ninurta, Marduk, Thoth, Sin, Shamash, and Ishtar, to name the most prominent, as gods who possessed aircraft and could roam Earth’s skies—or engage in aerial battles, as between Horus and Seth or Ninurta and Anzu (not to mention the Indo-Eu- ropean gods). Of all the varied textual descriptions and pic - torial depictions of the “celestial boats” of the gods, the most appropr iate to Ezekiel’s vision of a Whirlwind appears to be the “whirlwind chariot” depicted at a site in Jordan (Fig. 103) from which the Prophet Elijah was taken up to heaven. Helicopterlike, it had to serve just as a shuttlecraft to where full-fledged spacecraft were stationed. Ezekiel’s mission was to prophesy and warn his exiled co mpatriots of the coming Day of Judgment for all the na - tions’ injustices and abominations.

Arriving there, Ezekiel saw a scene of complete brea kdown of the rule of law and of religious observances. Wondering what was going on, he heard the remnant sitting in mourning, bewailing (8: 12; 9: 9): Yahweh sees us no more, Yahweh has left the Earth! This was, we suggest, the reason why Nebuchadnezzar d ared attack Jerusalem again and destroy Yahweh’s temple. It was an outcry virtually identical to what Adda-Guppi had reported from Harran: “Sin, the lord of the gods, became angry with his city and his people, and went up to heaven; and the city and the people in it went to ruin.” One cannot be certain how or why events occurring in n orthern Mesopotamia gave rise to a notion in distant Judea that Yahweh, too, had left the Earth, but it is evident that word that God and gods departed had spread far and wide. Indeed, tablet VAT 7847, which we mentioned earlier in con - nection with the solar eclipse, states the following in a pro - phetic section regarding calamities that last 200 years: Roaring the gods, flying, from the lands will go away, from the people they will be separated. The people will the gods’ abodes leave in ruins. Compassion and well-being will cease. Enlil, in anger, will lift himself off. Like several other documents of the “Akkadian Prophe - cies” genre, scholars deem this text, too, a “post-event proph- e cy”—a text that uses events that had already happened as the basis for predicting other future events. Be that as it may, we have here a document that considerably expands the divine exodus: the angered gods, led by Enlil , flew away from their lands; it was not just Sin who was angered and left."},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"232 THE END OF DAYS There is yet another document. It is classified by scholars a s belonging to “Prophecy in Neo-Assyrian sources,” though its very first words suggest authorship by a (Babylonian?) worshipper of Marduk. Here is, in full, what it says: Marduk, the Enlil of the gods, got angry. His mind beca me furious. He made an evil plan to disperse the land and its peoples. His angry heart was bent on levelling the land and destroying its people. A g rievous curse formed in his mouth. Evil portents indicating the disruption of heavenly harmony started appearing abunbantly in heaven a nd on Earth. The planets in the Ways of Enlil, Anu and Ea wor sened their positions and repeatedly disclosed abnormal omens. Arahtu, the river of abundance, became a raging curr ent. A fierce surge of water, a violent flood like th e Deluge swept away the city, its houses and sanctuaries, turning them to ruins. The gods and goddesses became afraid, a bandoned their shrines, flew off like birds and ascended to heaven.

It seems that the latter is the case, for it is probably no coincidence that the era of biblical prophecy re - garding the nations’ sins and the coming judgment on the Da y of the Lord began with Amos and Hosea circa 760/750 b.c.e. —two centuries before the Return of Nibiru! For two centuries the Prophets, from the only legitimate place of the “Bond Heaven-Earth”—Jerusalem—called for justice and honesty among people and peace among nations, scorned meaningless offerings and worship of lifeless idols, denounced wanton conquests and pitiless destruction, and warned one nation after another—Israel included—of the inevitable pun- ishments, but to no avail. If that was the case, then what had taken place was a g radual buildup of divine anger and disappointment, and the reaching of a conclusion by the Anunnaki that “enough is enough”—it was time to leave. It all brings to mind the deci - sion of the gods, led by the disappointed Enlil, to keep the co ming Deluge and the gods’ lofting themselves in their ce - lestial craft a secret from Mankind; now, as Nibiru was again ne aring, it was the Enlilite gods who planned the Departure. Who left, how did they leave, and where did they go if Sin cou ld come back in a few decades? For the answers, let us roll the events back to the beginning. When the Anunnaki, led by Ea/Enki, had first come to E arth to obtain the gold with which to protect their planet’s endangered atmosphere, they planned to extract the gold from the waters of the Persian Gulf. When that did not work, they shifted to mining operations in southeastern Africa and smelting and refining in the E.DIN, the future Sumer. Their number increased to 600 on Earth plus 300 Igigi who oper - ated celestial craft to a way station on Mars, from which the l ong-haul spacecraft to Nibiru could be launched more eas - ily.

When the Anunnaki toiling in the mines mutinied, Enki suggested that a “Prim - itive Worker” be fashioned; it was done by genetically up -"},{"pageNumber":241,"pageContent":"234 THE END OF DAYS grading an existing Hominid. And then the Anunnaki began to “ take the daughters of the Adam as wives and had chil - dren by them” ( Ge nesis 6), with Enki and Marduk breaking the taboo. When the Deluge came, the outraged Enlil said “let mankind perish,” for “the wickedness of Man was great on the Earth.” But Enki, through a “Noah,” frustrated the plan. Mankind survived, proliferated, and in time was granted civilization. The Deluge that swept over the Earth flooded the mines i n Africa, but exposed a mother lode of gold in the Andes Mountains of South America, enabling the Anunnaki to obtain more gold more easily and quickly, and without the need for smelting and refining, for the Placer Gold—pure gold nuggests washed down from the mountains—needed only panning and collecting. It also made it possible to re - duce the number of Anunnaki needed on Earth. On their s tate visit to Earth circa 4000 b.c.e. , Anu and Antu visited the post-Diluvial gold land on the shores of Lake Titicaca. The visit served as an opportunity to begin reducing the n umber of Nibiruans on Earth; it also approved peace ar - rangements between the rival half-brothers and their warring c lans. But while Enki and Enlil accepted the territorial di - visions, Enki’s son Marduk never gave up the strife for su - premacy that included control of the olden space-related s ites. It was then that the Enlilites began to prepare alterna - tive spaceport facilities in South America. When the post- D iluvial spaceport in the Sinai was wiped out with nuclear weapons in 2024 b.c.e. , the facilities in South America were the only ones left entirely in Enlilite hands. And so, when the frustrated and disgusted Anunnaki lead- ership decided that it was time to leave, some could use the L anding Place; others, perhaps with a last large haul of gold, had to use the South American facilities, near the place where Anu and Antu stayed during their visit to the area.

If it was to serve as casting dies for complex instruments, what—and whose— were those instruments? Clearly, one can think only of the Anunnaki as possessing b oth the technology to make those “dies” and to use them or their end products. The main outpost of the Anunnaki was situated a few miles inland, at a site now known as Tiwanacu (earlier spelled Tiahuanacu), now belonging to Bolivia. One of the first European explorers to reach it in modern times, George Squier, described the place in his book Peru Illus - trated a s “The Baalbec of the New world”—a comparison more valid than he realized.

It had to be, of cou rse, a place from which Sin could return relatively soon once he changed his mind. The place was the good old Way Station on Mars, from which the long-distance spaceships raced to intercept and land on the orbiting Nibiru. As detailed in T he Twelfth Planet , Sumerian knowledge of our Solar system included references to the use of Mars by the Anunnaki as a Way Station.

In 1976, when all that was first presented in T he Twelfth Planet , Mars was still held to be an airless, waterless, life - less, hostile planet, and the suggestion that a space base had onc e existed there was deemed by establishment scholars even more far out than the notion of “Ancient Astronauts.” By the time Genesis Revisited was published in 1990, there were enough of NASA’s own findings and photographs from Mars to fill up a whole chapter titled “A Space Base on Mars.” The evidence showed that Mars once had water, and included photographs of walled structures, roads, a hublike compound (Fig. 114 shows just two such photographs)—and the famous Face (Fig. 115) .

Of particular interest to us are such collective memories b y the peoples and in the lands where the departures had ac - tually taken place. We have already covered the evidence f rom the ancient Near East; it also comes from the Americas, and it embraces both Enlilite and Enki’ite gods. In South America, the dominant deity was called Vi raco - cha ( “Creator of All”). The Aymara natives of the Andes told of him that his abode was in Tiwanaku, and that he gave the first two brother-sister couples a golden wand with which to find the right place to establish Cuzco (the eventual Inca capital), the site for the observatory of Machu Picchu, and other sacred sites.

Though the time of his departure was not specified, it had to coincide with the demise of his African protégés, the Ol - mecs, and the simultaneous rise of the native Mayas—circa 60 0/500 b.c.e. The dominant legend in Mesoamerica was his promise, when he departed, to return —on the anniversary of his Secret Number 52. And so it was, by the middle of the first millennium b.c.e . , in one part of the world after another, that Mankind found itself without its long-worshipped gods; and before long, the question (which has been asked by my readers) began to pre - occupy Mankind: Wi ll they return?

Their number"},{"pageNumber":259,"pageContent":"252 THE END OF DAYS was falling after the Deluge and especially after Anu’s visit ci rca 4000 b.c.e. Of the gods named in the early Sumerian texts and in long God Lists, few remained as the millennia followed each other. Most returned to their home planet; some—in spite of their wonted “immortality”—died on Earth. We can mention the defeated Zu and Seth, the dismembered Osiris, the drowned Dumuzi, the nuclear-afflicted Bau. The departures of the Anunnaki gods as Nibiru’s return loomed were the dramatic finale. The awesome times when the gods resided in sacred pre - cincts in the people’s cities, when a Pharaoh claimed that a g od was riding along in his chariot, when an Assyrian king boasted of help from the skies, were over and gone. Already in the days of the Prophet Jeremiah (626–586 b.c.e. ), the na- tions surrounding Judea were mocked for worshipping not a “l iving god” but idols made by craftsmen of stone, wood, and metal—gods who needed to be carried, for they could not walk. With the final departure taking place, who of the great A nunnaki gods remained on Earth? To judge by who was mentioned in the texts and inscriptions from the ensuing pe - riod, we can be certain only of Marduk and Nabu of the En ki’ites; and of the Enlilites, Nannar/Sin, his spouse Nin- gal/Nikkal and his aide Nusku, and probably also Ishtar. On each side of the great religious divide there was now just one sole Great God of Heaven and Earth: Marduk for the Enki’ites, Nannar/Sin for the Enlilites. The story of Babylonia’s last king reflected the new cir - cumstances. He was chosen by Si n in his cult-center Harran— but he required the consent and blessing of Marduk in Babylon, and the celestial confirmation by the appearance of Marduk’s planet; and he bore the name Nabu -Na’id. This di - vine co-regnum might have been an attempt at Dual Mono - theism (to coin an expression); but its un intended consequence was to plant the seeds of Islam . The historical record indicates that neither gods nor people w ere happy with these arrangements.

A tablet now in the British Museum is inscribed with a text t hat scholars have titled Nabunaid and the Clergy of Baby - lon . I t contains a list of accusations by the Babylonian priests against Nabunaid. The charges ran from civil matters (“law and order are not promulgated by him”), through neglect of the economy (“the farmers are corrupted,” “the traders’ roads are blocked”), and lack of public safety (“nobles are killed”), to the most serious charges: religious sacrilege— He made an image of a god which nobody had seen before in the land. H e placed it in the temple, raised it upon a pedestal, He called it by the name of Nannar, with lapis lazuli he adorned it, Cr owned it with a tiara in the shape of an eclipsed moon, Made for its hand the gesture of a demon. It was, the accusations continued, a strange statue of a de - ity, never seen before, “with hair reaching down to the pedes - tal.” It was so unusual and unseemly, the priests wrote, that e ven Enki and Ninmah (who ended up with strange chimera creatures when they attempted to fashion Man) “could not have conceived it”; it was so strange that “not even the learned Adapa”—an icon of utmost human knowledge—“could have named it.” To make matters worse, two unusual beasts were sculpted as its guardians—one a “Deluge demon” and the other a wild bull; then the king took this abomination and placed it in Marduk’s Esagil temple. Even more offending was Nabunaid’s announcment that henceforth the Akitu festi - val, during which the near-death, resurrection, exile, and fi - nal triumph of Marduk were reenacted, would no longer be c elebrated. Declaring that Nabunaid’s “protective god became hostile to h im” and that “the former favorite of the gods was now fated to misfortune,” the Babylonian priests forced Nabunaid"},{"pageNumber":261,"pageContent":"254 THE END OF DAYS to leave Babylon and go into exile “in a distant region.” It is a h istorical fact that Nabunaid indeed left Babylon and named his son Bel-Shar-Uzur—the Belshazzar of the biblical Book of Daniel—as regent. The “distant region” to which Nabunaid went in self-exile w as Arabia. As various inscriptions attest, his entourage in - cluded Jews from among the Judean exiles in the Harran re - gion. His principal base was at a place called Teima, a ca ravan center in what is now northwestern Saudi Arabia that is mentioned several times in the Bible. (Recent excava- tions there have uncovered cuneiform tablets attesting to N abunaid’s stay.) He established six other settlements for his followers; five of the towns were listed—a thousand years later—by Arabian writers as Jewish towns. One of them was Medina, the town where Muhammed founded Islam. The “Jewish angle” in the Nabunaid tale has been reinforced b y the fact that a fragment of the Dead Sea scrolls, found at Qumran on the shores of the Dead Sea, mentions Nabunaid and asserts that he was suffering in Teima from an “unpleas - ant skin disease” that was cured only after “a Jew told him to g ive honor to the God Most High.” All that has led to specula- tion that Nabunaid was contemplating Monotheism; but to h im the God Most High was not the Judeans’ Yahweh, but his benefector Nannar/Sin, the Moon god, whose crescent symbol has been adopted by Islam; and there is little doubt that its roots can be traced back to Nabunaid’s stay in Arabia. Sin’s whereabouts fade out of Mesopotamian records af - ter the time of Nabunaid. Texts discovered at Ugarit, a “Ca - naanite” site on the Mediterranean coast in Syria now called R as Shamra, describe the Moon god as retired, with his spouse, to an oasis at the confluence of two bodies of water, “near the cleft of the two seas.” Ever wondering why the Si - nai peninsula was named in honor of Sin and its main cen - tral crossroads in honor of his spouse Nikkal (the place is s till called, in Arabic, Nakhl), I surmised that the aged cou - ple retired to somewhere on the shores of the Red Sea and t he Gulf of Eilat.

And as tradi - tion demands, the mosques are flanked, to this day, by m inarets that simulate multistage rocketships ready to be launched (Fig. 119) . The last chapter in the Nabunaid saga was linked to the emer - gence on the scene of the ancient world of the Pe rsians —a name given to a medley of peoples and states on the Iranian plateau that included the olden Sumerian Anshan and Elam and the land of the later Medes (who had a hand in the de - mise of Assyria). It was in the sixth century b.c.e. t hat a tribe called Ach - aemeans b y Greek historians who recorded their deeds emerged from the northern outskirts of those territories, seized control, and unified them all to become a mighty new empire. Though deemed to racially be “Indo-Europeans,” their tribal name stemmed from that of their ancestor Hakham-Anish, which meant “Wise Man” in Semitic He- brew—a fact that some attribute to the influence of Jewish exiles from the Ten Tribes who had been relocated to that Figure 119"},{"pageNumber":263,"pageContent":"256 THE END OF DAYS region by the Assyrians. Religiously, the Achaemean Per - sians apparently adopted a Sumerian-Akkadian pantheon a kin to its Hurrian-Mitannian version, which was a step to the Indo-Aryan one of the Sanskrit Vedas—a mixture that is conveniently simplified by just stating that they believed in a God Most High whom they called Ahura-Mazda (“Truth and Light”). In 56 0 b.c.e. the Achaemean king died and his son Kurash succeeded him on the throne and made his mark on subse - quent historic events. We call him Cyr us ; the Bible called him Koresh and considered him Yahweh’s emissary for con - quering Babylon, overthrowing its king, and rebuilding the des troyed Temple in Jerusalem. “Though you knowest Me not, I, Yahweh, the God of Israel, am thy caller who hath called you by name . . . who will help you though you don’t recognize me,” the biblical God stated through the prophet Isaiah (44: 28 to 45: 1–4). That end of Babylonian kingship was most dramatically fo retold in the Book of Daniel. One of the Judean exiles taken to Babylon, Daniel was serving in the Babylonian court of Belshazzar when, during a royal banquet, a floating hand appeared and wrote on the wall MENE MENE TEKEL UP - HARSIN. As tounded and mystified, the king called his wiz - ards and seers to decipher the inscription, but none could. As a la st resort, the exiled Daniel was called in, and he told the king the inscription’s meaning: God has weighed Babylon and its king and, finding them wanting, numbered their days; they will meet their end by the hand of the Persians. In 539 b.c.e . Cyrus crossed the Tigris River into Babylo - nian territory, advanced on Sippar where he intercepted a r ushing-back Nabunaid, and then—claiming that Marduk himself had invited him—entered Babylon without a fight. Welcomed by the priests who considered him a savior from the heretic Nabunaid and his disliked son, Cyrus “grasped the hands of Marduk” as a sign of homage to the god. But he also, in one of his very first proclamations, rescinded the exile of the Judeans, permitted the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, and ordered the return of all the Temple’s ritual objects that were looted by Nebuchadnezzar."},{"pageNumber":264,"pageContent":"257 The End of Days The returning exiles, under the leadership of Ezra and N ehemiah, completed the rebuilding of the Temple—hence- forth known as the Second Temple—in 516 b.c.e. —exactly, as was prophesied by Jeremiah, seventy years after the First Temple was destroyed. The Bible considered Cyrus an in - strument of God’s plans, an “anointed of Yahweh”; historians b elieve that Cyrus proclaimed a general religious amnesty that allowed each people to worship as they pleased. As to what Cyrus himself might have believed, to judge by the monument he had erected for himself, he appears to have envisioned himself as a winged Cherub (Fig. 120) . Cyrus—some historians attach the epithet “the great” to h is name—consolidated into a vast Persian empire all the lands that had once been Sumer & Akkad, Mari and Mittani, Hatti and Elam, Babylonia and Assyria; it was left to his son Cambyses (530–522 b.c.e. ) to extend the empire to Egypt. Egypt was just recovering from a period of disarray that some consider a Third Intermediate Period, during which it was disunited, changed capitals several times, was ruled by invaders from Nubia, or had no central authority at all. Egypt Figure 120"},{"pageNumber":265,"pageContent":"258 THE END OF DAYS was also in disarray religiously, its priests uncertain who to w orship, so much so that the leading cult was that of the dead Osiris, the leading deity the female Neith whose title was Mother of God , and the principal “cult object” a bull, the sa - cred Apis Bull, for whom elaborate funerals were held. Cam - byses, too, like his father, was no religious zealot, and let p eople worship as they pleased; he even (according to an in - scribed stela now in the Vatican museum) learnt the secrets o f the worship of Neith and participated in a ceremonial fu - neral of an Apis bull. These religious lai ssez-faire policies bought the Persians peace in their empire, but not forever. Unrest, uprisings, and rebellions kept breaking out almost everywhere. Especially troublesome were growing commercial, cultural, and reli - gious ties between Egypt and Greece. (Much information ab out that comes from the Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote extensively about Egypt after his visit there circa 460 b.c.e. , coinciding with the beginning of Greece’s “golden age.”) The Persians could not be pleased with those ties, above all because Greek mercenaries were participating in the local uprisings. Of particular concern were also the prov - inces in Asia Minor (present-day Turkey), at the western tip o f which Asia and the Persians faced Europe and the Greeks. There, Greek settlers were reviving and reinforcing olden settlements; the Persians, on their part, sought to ward off the troublesome Europeans by seizing nearby Greek islands. The growing tensions broke into open warfare when the P ersians invaded the Greek mainland and were beaten at Marathon in 490 b.c.e.. A Persian invasion by sea was beaten off by the Greeks in the straits of Salamis a decade later, but the skirmishes and battles for control of Asia Minor contin - ued for another century, even as in Persia king followed king a nd in Greece Athenians, Spartans, and Macedonians fought one another for supremacy. In those double struggles—one among the mainland G reeks, the other with the Persians—the support of the Greek settlers of Asia Minor was very important. No sooner did the Macedonians win the upper hand on the mainland"},{"pageNumber":266,"pageContent":"259 The End of Days than their king, Philip II, sent an armed corps over the Straits o f Hellespont (today’s Dardanelles) to secure the loyalty of the Greek settlements. In 334 b.c.e. his successor, Alexander (“the Great”), heading an army 15,000 strong, crossed into Asia at the same place and launched a major war against the Persians. Alexander’s astounding victories and the resulting subjuga - tion of the Ancient East to Western (Greek) domination have b een told and retold by historians—starting with some who had accompanied Alexander—and need no repetition here. What does need to be described are the personal reasons for Alexander’s foray into Asia and Africa. For, apart from all geopolitical or economic reasons for the Greek-Persian great war, there was Alexander’s own personal quest: there had been persistent rumors in the Macedonian court that not King Philip but a god—an Egyptian god—was Alexander’s true father, having come to the queen, Olympias, disguised as a man. With a Greek pantheon that derived from across the Mediterranean Sea and headed (like the Sumerian twelve) by twelve Olympians, and with tales of the gods (“myths”) that emulated the Near Eastern tales of the gods, the appearance of one such god in the Macedonian court was not deemed an impossibility. With court shenanigans that involved a young Egyptian mistress of the king and marital strife that included divorce and murders, the “rumors” were believed—first and foremost by Alexander himself. A visit by Alexander to the oracle in Delphi to find out w hether he was indeed the son of a god and therefore immor - tal only intensified the mystery; he was advised to seek an a nswer at an Egyptian sacred site. It was thus that as soon as the Persians were beaten in the first battle, Alexander, rather than pursuing them, left his main army and rushed to the oasis of Siwa in Egypt. There the priests assured him that he indeed was a demigod, the son of the ram-god Amon. In cel - ebration, Alexander issued silver coins showing him with r am’s horns (Fig. 121) . But what about the immortality? While the course of t he resumed warfare and Alexander’s conquests have been"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"260 THE END OF DAYS Figure 121 documented by his campaign historian Callisthenes and other historians, his personal quest for Immortality is mostly known from sources deemed to be pseudo-Callisthenes, or “Alexander Romances” that embellished fact with legend. As detailed in The Stairway to Heaven , the Egyptian priests directed Alexander from Siwa to Thebes. There, on the Nile River’s western shore, he could see in the funerary temple built by Hatshepsut the inscription attesting to her being fa - thered by the god Amon when he came to her mother dis - guised as the royal husband—exactly like the tale of A lexander’s demigod conception. In the great temple of Ra- Amon in Thebes, in the Holy of Holies, Alexander was crowned as a Pharaoh. Then, following the directions given in Siwa, he entered subterranean tunnels in the Sinai penin - sula, and finally he went to where Amon-Ra, alias Marduk, w as—to Babylon. Resuming the battles with the Persians, Alexander reached Babylon in 331 b.c.e. , and entered the city riding in his chariot. In the sacred precinct he rushed to the Esagil ziggurat t emple to grasp the hands of Marduk as conquerors before him had done. But the great god was dead . According to the pseudo-sources, Alexander saw the god l ying in a golden coffin, his body immersed (or preserved) in special oils. True or not, the facts are that Marduk was no longer alive, and that his Esagil ziggurat was, without ex - ception, described as his to mb by subsequent established historians. According to Diodorus of Sicily (first century b.c.e . ),"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"261 The End of Days whose Biblioth ca historica is known to have been compiled from verified reliable sources, “scholars called Chaldaeans, who have gained a great reputation in astrology and who are accustomed to predict future events by a method based on age-old observations,” warned Alexander that he would die in Babylon, but “could escape the danger if he re-erected the tomb of Belus which had been demolished by the Persians” (Book XVII, 112.1). Entering the city anyway, Alexander had neither the time nor the manpower to do the repairs, and indeed died in Babylon in 323 b.c.e. The first century b.c.e. h istorian-geographer Strabo, who was born in a Greek town in Asia Minor, described Babylon in his famed Geography —its great size, the “hanging gar - den” that was one of the Seven Wonders of the World, its h igh buildings constructed of baked bricks, and so on, and said this in section 16.I.5 (emphasis added): Here too is the tomb of Belus, now in ruins, having been demolished by Xerxes, as it is said. It was a quadrangular pyramid of baked bricks, not only being a stadium in height, but also having sides a stadium in length. Alexander intended to repair this pyramid; but it would have been a large task and would have required a long time, so that he could not finish what he had attempted. According to this source, the to mb of Bel /Marduk was destroyed by Xerxes, who was the Persian king (and ruler of Babylon) from 486 to 465 b.c.e. Strabo, in Book 5, had earlier stated that Belus was lying in a coffin when Xerxes decided to destroy the temple, in 482 b.c.e. Accordingly, Marduk died not long before (Germany’s leading Assyriolo - gists, meeting at the University of Jena in 1922, concluded t hat Marduk was already in his tomb in 484 b.c.e. ). Marduk’s son Nabu also vanished from the pages of history about the same time. And thus came to an end, an almost human end, the saga of the gods who shaped history on planet Earth."},{"pageNumber":269,"pageContent":"262 THE END OF DAYS That the end came as the Age of the Ram was waning was prob ably no coincidence, either. With the death of Marduk and the fading away of N abu, all the great Anunnaki gods who had once domi - nated Earth were gone; with the death of Alexander, the re al or pretended demigods who linked Mankind to the gods were also gone. For the first time since Adam was fashioned, Man was without his creators. In those despondent times for Mankind, hope came forth fr om Jerusalem. Amazingly, the story of Marduk and his ultimate fate in B abylon had been correctly foretold in biblical prophecies. We have already noted that Jeremiah, while forecasting a crushing end for Babylon, made the distinction that its god Bel/Marduk was only doomed to “wither”—to remain, but to grow old and confused, to shrivel and die. We should not be surprised that it was a prophecy that came true. But as Jeremiah correctly predicted the final downfall of Ass yria, Egypt, and Babylon, he accompanied those pre - dictions with prophecies of a reestablished Zion, of a rebuilt t emple, and of a “happy end” for all nations at the End of Days . It would be, he said, a future that God had planned “in his heart” all along, a secret that shall be revealed to Man - kind (23: 20) at a predetermined future time: “ at the End of Days you shall perceive it” (30: 24), and “at that time, they shall call Jerusalem Yahweh’s Throne, and all nations shall assemble there” (3: 17). Isaiah, in his second set of prophecies (sometimes called t he Second Isaiah), identifying Babylon’s god as the “Hiding god”—which is what “Amon” meant—foresaw the future in those words: Bel is b owed down, Nebo is cowered, their images are loads for beasts and cattle . . . Together they stoopeth, they bowed down, unable to save themselves from capture. Isaiah 46:1–2"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"263 The End of Days These prophecies, as did Jeremiah’s, also contained the pro mise that Mankind will be offered a new beginning, new hope; that a Messianic Time will come when “the wolf shall dwell with the lamb.” And, the Prophet said, “it shall come to pass at the End of Days that the Mount of Yahweh’s Temple shall be established as foremost of all mountains, exalted above all hills; and all the nations shall throng unto it”; it will be then that the nations “shall beat their swords into plough - shares and their spears into pruning hooks, nation shall not l ift up sword against nation, and they shall no longer teach war” ( Isaiah 2: 1–4). The assertion that after troubles and tribulations, after p eople and nations shall be judged for their sins and trans- gressions, a time of peace and justice shall come was also m ade by the early Prophets even as they predicted the Day of the Lord as judgment day. Among them were Hosea, who foresaw the return of the kingdom of God through the House of David at the End of Days , and Micha, who—using words identical to those of Isaiah—declared that “at the End of Days it shall come to pass.” Significantly, Micha too consid - ered the re storation of God’s Temple in Jerusalem and Yahweh’s universal reign through a descendant of David as a prerequisite, a “must” destined from the very beginning, “emanating from ancient times, from everlasting days.” There was thus a combination of two basic elements in t hose End of Days predictions: one, that the Day of the Lord, a day of judgment upon Earth and the nations, will be fol - lowed by Restoration, Renewal, and a benevolent era cen - tered on Jerusalem. The other is, that it has all been pre ordained, that the End was already planned by God at the Beginning. Indeed, the concept of an End of Epoch, a time when the course of events shall come to a halt—a precursor, one may say, of the current idea of the “End of History”— and a new epoch (one is almost tempted to say, a New Age ), a new (and predicted!) cycle shall begin, can already be found in the earliest biblical chapters. The Hebrew term A charit Hayamim (sometimes trans- lated “last days,” “latter days,” but more accurately “end of"},{"pageNumber":271,"pageContent":"264 THE END OF DAYS days”) was already used in the Bible in Genesis (C hapter 49), when the dying Jacob summoned his sons and said: “Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall be - fall you at the End of Days . ” It is a statement (followed by detailed predictions that many associate with the twelve houses of the zodiac) that presupposes prophecy by being based on advance knowledge of the future. And again, in Deuteronomy (Chapter 4), when Moses, before dying, re - viewing Israel’s divine legacy and its future, counseled the p eople thus: “When you in tribulations shall be and such things shall befall you, in the End of Days to Yahweh thy God return and hearken to His voice.” The repeated stress on the role of Jerusalem, on the essen - tiality of its Temple Mount as the beacon to which all nations s hall come streaming, had more than a theological-moral reason. A very practical reason is cited: the need to have the site ready for the return of Yahweh’s Kavod —the very term used in Exodus and then by Ezekiel to describe God’s celestial vehicle! The Kavod that will be enshrined in the rebuilt Tem - ple, “from which I shall grant peace, shall be greater than the one i n the First Temple,” the Prophet Haggai was told. Sig - nificantly, the Kavod ’ s coming to Jerusalem was repeatedly linked in Isaiah to the other space-related site—in Lebanon: It is from there that God’s Kavod shall arrive in Jerusalem, verses 35: 2 and 60: 13 stated. One cannot avoid the conclusion that a divine Return w as expected at the End of Days; but when was the End of Days due? The question—one to which we shall offer our own an- s wer—is not new, for it has already been asked in antiquity, even by the very Prophets who had spoken of the End of Days. Isaiah’s prophecy about the time “when a great trumpet s hall be blown” and the nations shall gather and “bow down to Yahweh on the Holy Mount in Jerusalem” was accompa - nied by his admission that without details and timing the p eople could not understand the prophecy. “Precept is upon precept, precept is within precept, line is upon line, line is with line, a little here, somewhat there” was how Isaiah (28:"},{"pageNumber":272,"pageContent":"265 The End of Days 10) complained to God. Whatever answer he was given, he w as ordered to seal and hide the document; no less than three times, Isaiah changed the word for “letters” of a script— Otioth —to Ototh , which meant “oracular signs,” hinting at the existence of a kind of secret “Bible Code” due to which the divine plan could not be comprehended until the right time. Its secret code might have been hinted at when the Prophet asked God—identified as “Creator of the letters”— to “tell us the letters backward” (41: 23). The prophet Zephaniah—whose very name meant “By Y ahweh encoded”—relayed a message from God that it will be at the time of the nations’ gathering that He “will speak in a clear language.” But that said no more than saying, “You’ll know when it will be time to tell.” No wonder, then, that in its final prophetic book, the Bible de alt almost exclusively with the question of WHEN—when will the End of Days come? It is the Book of Daniel, the very Daniel who deciphered (correctly) for Belshazzar the Writ - ing on the Wall. It was after that that Daniel himself began to ha ve omen-dreams and to see apocalyptic visions of the fu - ture in which the “Ancient of Days” and his archangels played k ey roles. Perplexed, Daniel asked the angels for explana - tions; the answers consisted of predictions of future events, t aking place at, or leading to, the End of Time. And when will that be? Daniel asked; the answers, which on the face of it seemed precise, only piled up enigmas upon puzzles. In one instance an angel answered that a phase in future e vents, a time when “an unholy king shall try to change the times and the laws,” will last “ a time, times and a half time ”; only after that will the promised Messianic Time, when “the kingdom of heaven will be given to the people by the Holy Ones of the Most High,” come about. Another time the re - sponding angel said: “Seventy sevens and seventy sixties of y ears have been decreed for your people and your city until the measure of transgression is filled and prophetic vision is ratified”; and yet another time that “after the seventies and sixties and two of years, the Messiah will be cut off, a leader will come who will destroy the city, and the end will come through a flood.”"},{"pageNumber":273,"pageContent":"266 THE END OF DAYS Seeking a clearer answer, Daniel then asked a divine mes- senger to speak plainly: “How long until the end of these a wful things?” In response, he again received the enigmatic answer that the End will come after “ a time, times and a half time .” But what did “time, times and a half time” mean, what did “seventy weeks of years” mean? “I heard and did not understand,” Daniel stated in his b ook. “So I said: My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?” Again speaking in codes, the angel answered: “from the time the regular offering is abolished and an appalling abomination is set up, it will be a thousand and two hundred and ninety days; happy is the one who waits and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty five.” And having given Daniel that information, the angel—who had called him be - fore “Son of Man”—told him: “Now, go on to thy end, and a rise for your destiny at the End of Days.” Like Daniel, generations of biblical scholars, savants and t heologians, astrologers and even astronomers—the famed Sir Isaac Newton among the latter—also said “we heard, but did not understand.” The enigma is not just the meaning of “time, time and a half ” and so on, but from when does (or did) the count begin? The uncertainty stems from the fact that the symbolic visions seen by Daniel (such as a goat at - tacking a ram, or two horns multiplying to four and then di - viding) were explained to him by the angels as events that w ere to take place well beyond Babylon of Daniel’s time, beyond its predicted fall, even beyond the prophesied re - building of the Temple after seventy years.

No sooner did he die than his four year-old son and his guardian, Alexander’s brother, were murdered and the quarrelling generals and regional com- manders divided between them the main conquered lands: P tolemy and his successors, headquartered in Egypt, seized Alexander’s African domains; Seleucus and his successors ruled, from Syria, Anatolia, Mesopotamia, and the distant Asian lands; the contested Judea (with Jerusalem) ended up in the Ptolemaic realm. The Ptolemies, having managed to maneuver Alexander’s"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"270 THE END OF DAYS body for burial in Egypt, considered themselves his true he irs and, by and large, continued his tolerant attitude toward others’ religions. They established the famed Library of Al - exandria, and assigned an Egyptian priest, known as Mane- t ho, to write down Egypt’s dynastic history and divine prehistory for the Greeks (archaeology has confirmed what is still known of Manetho’s writings). That convinced the Ptolemies that their civilization was a continuation of the Egyptian one, and they thus considered themselves rightful successors to the Pharaohs. Greek savants showed particular interest in the religion and writings of the Jews, so much so that the Ptolemies arranged for the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek (a translation known as the Septuagint ) and allowed the Jews complete religious freedom of worship in Judea, as well as in their growing communities in Egypt. Like the Ptolemies, the Seleucids also retained a Greek- s peaking scholar, a former priest of Marduk known as Ber - ossus, to compile for them the history and prehistory of Ma nkind and its gods according to Mesopotamian knowl - edge. In a twist of history, he researched and wrote at a li - brary of cuneiform tablets located near Harran. It is from his t hree books (which we know of only from fragmented quota - tions in the writings of others in antiquity) that the Western w orld, of Greece and then Rome, learnt of the Anunnaki and their coming to Earth, the prediluvial era, the creation of Wise Man, the Deluge, and what followed. Thus it was from Berossus (as later confirmed by the discovery and decipher - ment of the cuneiform tablets) that the 3600 “Sar” as the “ year” of the gods was first learnt. In 200 b.c.e . the Seleucids crossed the Ptolemaic bound - ary and captured Judea. As in other instances, historians ha ve searched for geopolitical and economic reasons for the war—ignoring the religious-messianic aspects. It was in the report about the Deluge that the tidbit information was given by Berossus, that Ea/Enki instructed Ziusudra (the Sumerian “Noah”) to “conceal every available writing in Sippar, the city of Shamash,” for post-Diluvial recovery, because those writings “ were about beginnings, middles and ends .” Ac - cording to Berossus, the world undergoes periodic cata-"},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"271  Jerusalem:  A Chalice,  V anished  clysms, and he related them to the zodiacal Ages, his con temporary one having begun 1,920 years before the Se - leucid Era (312 b.c.e . ); that would have placed the beginning of the Age of the Ram in 2232 b.c.e. —an Age destined to come soon to an end even if the full mathematical length is granted to it (2232–2160 = 122 b.c.e. ). The available records suggest that the Seleucid kings, cou - pling those calculations with the Missing Return, were seized wi th the need to urgently expect and prepare for one. A frenzy of rebuilding the ruined temples of Sumer and Akkad began, with emphasis on the E.ANNA—the “House of Anu”—in Uruk. The Landing Place in Lebanon, called by them Heliopolis—City of the Sun god—was rededicated by erecting a temple honoring Zeus. The reason for the war to capture Judea, one must conclude, was the urgency of also preparing the space-related site in Jerusalem for the Return. It was, we suggest, the Greek-Seleucid way of preparing for the reappearance of the gods. Unlike the Ptolemies, the Seleucid rulers were determined to i mpose the Hellenic culture and religion in their domains. The change was most significant in Jerusalem, where sud - denly foreign troops were stationed and the authority of the T emple priests was curtailed. Hellenistic culture and customs were forcefully introduced; even names had to be changed, starting with the high priest, who was obliged to change his name from Joshua to Jason. Civil laws restricted Jewish citi - zenship in Jerusalem; taxes were raised to finance the teach - ing of athletics and wrestling instead of the Torah ; a nd in the countryside, shrines to Greek deities were being erected by the authorities and soldiers were sent to enforce worship in them. In 169 b.c.e . the then Seleucid king, Antiochus IV (who adopted the epithet Epiphanes) came to Jerusalem. It was not a courtesy visit. Violating the Temple’s sanctity, he entered the Holy of Holies. On his orders, the Temple’s treasured golden ritual objects were confiscated, a Greek governor was put in charge of the city, and a fortress for a permanent garri - son of foreign soldiers was built next to the Temple. Back in h is Syrian capital, Antiochus issued a proclamation requiring"},{"pageNumber":279,"pageContent":"272 THE END OF DAYS worship of Greek gods throughout the kingdom; in Judea, it sp ecifically forbade the observance of the Sabbath and cir - cumcision. In accordance with the decree, the Jerusalem tem- ple was to become a temple to Zeus; and in 167 b.c.e . , on the 25th day of the Hebrew month Kislev— equivalent to today’s December 25 —an idol, a statue representing Zeus, “The Lord of Heaven,” was set up by Syrian-Greek soldiers in the tem - ple, and the great altar was altered and used for sacrifices to Z eus. The sacrilege could not have been greater. The unavoidable Jewish uprising, begun and led by a priest na med Matityahu and his five sons, is known as the Hash - monean or Maccabean Revolt. Starting in the countryside, t he uprising quickly overcame the local Greek garrisons. As the Greeks rushed in reinforcements, the revolt engulfed the whole country; what the Maccabees lacked in numbers and weapons, they compensated for by the ferocity of their reli - gious zeal. The events, described in the Book of Maccabees (and by subsequent historians), leave no doubt that the fight of the few against a powerful kingdom was guided by a cer - tain timetable: It wa s imperative to retake Jerusalem, cleanse the temple, and rededicate it to Yahweh by a certain dead - line . Ma naging in 164 b.c.e. to recapture only the Temple Mount, the Maccabees cleansed the Temple, and the sacred flame was rekindled that year; the final victory, leading to full control of Jerusalem and restoration of Jewish indepen - dence, took place in 160 b. c.e. The victory and rededication of the Temple are still celebrated by Jews as the holiday of Hanukkah (“rededication”) on the twenty-fifth day of Kislev. The sequence and the timing of those events appeared to b e linked to the prophecies about the End of Days. Of those prophecies, as we have seen, the ones that offered specific numerical clues in regard to the ultimate future, the End of Days, were conveyed by the angels to Daniel. But clarity is lacking because the counts were enigmatically expressed ei - ther in a unit called “time,” or in “weeks of years,” and even i n numbers of days; and it is perhaps only in respect to the latter that one is told when the count does begin, so that one could know when it would end. In that one instance, the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"273  Jerusalem:  A Chalice,  V anished  count was to begin from the day when “regular offering is ab olished and an appalling abomination is set up” in the Je - rusalem temple; we have established that such an abominable a ct indeed took place one day in 167 b.c.e. With the sequence of those events in mind, the count of d ays given to Daniel must have applied to the specific events at the Temple: its defiling in 167 b.c.e. (“when the regular offering is abolished and an appalling abomination is set up”), the cleansing of the Temple in 164 b.c.e. (after “a thou- sand and two hundred and ninety days”), and Jerusalem’s co mplete liberation by 160 b.c.e. (“happy is the one who waits and reaches one thousand three hundred and thirty five days”). The numbers of days, 1290 and 1335, basically match the sequence of events at the Temple. According to the prophecies in the Book of Daniel, it was then that the clock of the End of Days began ticking. The imperative of recapturing the whole city and the removal o f uncircumcised foreign soldiers from the Temple Mount by 160 b.c.e. hold the key to another clue. While we have been using the accepted count of b.c.e. and a.d. for dating events, the people of those past times obviously could not and did not use a timetable based on a future Christian calendar. The He - brew calendar, as we have mentioned earlier, was the calendar be gun in Nippur in 3760 b.c.e. —and according to that calen - dar, w hat we call 160 b.c.e. was precisely the year 3600! That, as the reader knows by now, was a SAR, the original ( mathematical) orbital period of Nibiru. And though Nibiru had reappeared four hundred years earlier, the arrival of the SAR year—3,600— the completion of one Divine Year — was of unavoidable significance. To those to whom the bibli - cal prophecies of the return of Yahweh’s Kavod to H is Temple Mount were unquestioned divine pronouncements, the year we call “160 b.c.e. ” was a crucial moment of truth: no matter where the planet was, God has promised to Return to His Temple, and the temple had to be purified and readied for that.

It retells the history of the Jewish people from the t ime of the Exodus in time units of Jubilees—the 50-year units decreed by Yahweh at Mount Sinai (see our chapter IX); it also created a consecutive calendrical historical count that has since become known as Annu Mundi —“Year of the World” in Latin—that starts in 3760 b.c.e.

Was the Time of Fulfillment not yet at hand, many wondered; and it became evident that the enigmas of Daniel’s other counts, of “years” and “weeks of years” and of “Time, Times,” and so on had yet to be deciphered. Clues were the prophetic parts in the Book of Daniel t hat spoke of the rise and fall of future kingdoms after Babylon, Persia, and Egypt—kingdoms cryptically called “of the south,” “of the north,” or a seafaring “Kittim”; and kingdoms that shall split off them, fight each other, “plant tabernacles of palaces between the seas”—all future enti - ties that were also cryptically represented by varied ani - mals (a ram, a goat, a lion and so on) whose offspring, ca lled “horns,” will again split apart and fight each other. Who were those future nations, and what wars were fore - told? The Prophet Ezekiel also spoke of great battles to come, b etween north and south, between an unidentified Gog and an opposing Magog; and people were wondering whether the prophesied kingdoms have already appeared on the scene— Alexander’s Greece, the Seleucids, the Ptolemies. Were these the subject of the prophecies, or was it someone yet to come in the even more distant future? There was theological turmoil: Was the expectation at t he Jerusalem Temple of the Kavod as a physical object a correct understanding of prophecies, or was the expected Coming only of a symbolic, of an ephemeral nature, a spir - itual Presence ? W hat was required of the people—or was what was destined to happen will happen no matter what? The Jewish leadership split between devout and by-the- book Pharisees and the more liberal Sadducees, who were more internationally minded, recognizing the importance of a Jewish diaspora already spread from Egypt to Anatolia to Mesopotamia. In addition to these two mainstreams, small sects, sometimes organized in their own communi - ties, sprang up; the best known of them are the Essenes (of"},{"pageNumber":284,"pageContent":"277  Jerusalem:  A Chalice,  V anished  the Dead Sea Scrolls fame), who secluded themselves at Qum ran. In the efforts to decipher the prophecies, a rising new po wer— Rome —had to be figured in. Having won repeated wars with the Phoenicians and with the Greeks, the Romans controlled the Mediterranean and began to get involved in the affairs of Ptolemian Egypt and the Seleucid Levant (Judea included). Armies followed imperial delegates; by 60 b.c.e. , the Romans, under Pompey, occupied Jerusalem. On the way there, like Alexander before him, he detoured to Heliopolis (alias Baalbek) and offered sacrifices to Jupiter; it was followed by the building there, atop the earlier colossal stone blocks, of the Roman empire’s greatest temple to Jupi - ter (F ig. 123) . A commemorative inscription found at the site indicates that the emperor Nero visited the place in a.d. 60, suggesting that the Roman temple was already built by then. The national and religious turmoil of those days found e xpression in a proliferation of historic-prophetic writings, such as the Book of Jubilees , the Book of Enoch , the Testa - ments of the Twelve Patriarchs , a nd the Assumption of Mo - ses ( and several others, all collectively known as the Apocrypha and Pseuda-Epigrapha ). The common theme in them was a belief that history is cyclical, that all has been foretold, that the End of Days—a time of turmoil and up- heaval—will mark not just an end of a historic cycle but also the beginning of a new one, and that the “flipover time” (to use a modern expression) will be manifest by the coming of the “ Anointed One ”— Mashi’ach in Hebrew (t ra nslated Chrystos in Greek, and thus Messiah or Christ in English). The act of anointing a newly invested king with priestly oil w as known in the Ancient World, at least from the time of Sargon. It was recognized in the Bible as an act of consecra - tion to God from the earliest times, but its most memorable i nstance was when the priest Samuel, custodian of the Ark of the Covenant, summoned David, the son of Jesse, and, pro - claiming him king by the grace of God,"},{"pageNumber":285,"pageContent":"278 THE END OF DAYS Figure 123 Took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brethren; and the Spirit of God came upon David from that day on.

This, God vowed, is “an everlasting promise,” God’s covenant “for all generations.” The universality of this vow is attested to in Isaiah 16: 5 and 22: 22; Jeremiah 17: 25, 23: 5, and 30: 3; Amo s 9: 11; Habakkuk 3: 13; Zechariah 12: 8; Psalms 18: 50, 89: 4, 132: 10, 132: 17, and so on. These are strong words, unmistakable in their messianic co venant with the House of David , yet they are also full of explosive facets that virtually dictated the course of events in Jerusalem. Linked to that was the matter of the Prophet Eli - jah. Elijah, nicknamed the Thisbite after the name of his town i n the district of Gile’ad, was a biblical prophet active in the kingdom of Israel (after the split from Judea) in the ninth cen - tury b.c.e . , during the reign of king Ahab and his Canaanite wife, Queen Jezebel. True to his Hebrew name, Eli-Yahu — “Yahweh is my God”—he was in constant conflict with the priests and “spokesmen” of the Canaanite god Ba’al (“the Lord”), whose worship Jezebel was promoting. After a period of seclusion at a hiding place near the Jordan River, where he was ordained to become “A Man of God,” he was given a “mantle of haircloth” that held magical powers, and was able to perform miracles in the name of God. His first reported miracle ( I Kings Chapter 17) was the making of a spoonful of flour and a little cooking oil last a widow as food for the rest of her lifetime. He then resurrected her son, who had died of a virulent illness. During a contest with the prophets of Ba’al on Mount Carmel, he could summon a fire from the sky. His was the only biblical instance of an Israelite revisiting Mount Sinai since the Exodus: when he escaped for his life from the wrath of Jezebel and the priests of Ba’al, an Angel of the Lord sheltered him in a cave on Mount Sinai. Of him the Scriptures said that he did not die because he w as taken up to heaven in a whirlwind to be with God. His ascent, as described in great detail in II Kings Chapter 2, was neither a sudden nor an unexpected occurrence; on the con - trary, it was a preplanned and prearranged operation whose p lace and time were communicated to Elijah in advance. The designated place was in the Jordan Valley, on the"},{"pageNumber":287,"pageContent":"280 THE END OF DAYS eastern side of the river. When it was time to go there, his d isciples, headed by one named Elisha, went along. He made a stop at Gilgal (where Yahweh’s miracles were performed for the Israelites under the leadership of Joshua). There he tried to shake off his companions, but they went on to ac- company him to Beth-El; though asked to stay put and let El ijah cross the river by himself, they stuck with him unto the last stop, Jericho, all the while asking Elisha whether it was “true that the Lord will take Elijah heavenward today?” At the bank of the Jordan River, Elijah rolled his miracle m antle and struck the waters, parting them, enabling him to cross the river. The other disciples stayed behind, but even then Elisha persisted on being with Elijah, crossing over with him; And as they continued to walk and to talk, there appeared a chariot of fire with horses of fire, and the two were separated. And Elijah went up to heaven, in a whirlwind. And Elisha saw and cried out: “My father! My father! the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!” And he saw it no more. II Kings 2: 11–12 Archaeological excavations at Tell Ghassul (the “Prophet’s M ound”), a site in Jordan that fits the biblical tale’s geogra - phy, have uncovered murals that depicted the “whirlwinds” sho wn in Fig. 103.

Because tradition held that the Mount Sinai cave where the angel took Elijah was where God had revealed himself to Moses, Elijah has been expected to reappear at the start of the Passover festival, when the Exodus is commemorated. To this day the Seder , the ceremonial evening meal when the seven-day Passover holiday begins, requires the placement on the meal table of a wine-filled cup for Elijah, to sip from as he arrives; the door is opened to enable him to enter, and a prescribed hymn is recited, expressing the hope that he will soon herald “the Messiah, son of David.” (As is the case with Christian kids being told that Santa Claus did sneak down the chimney and bring them the gifts they see, so are Jewish kids told that though unseen, Elijah did sneak in and took a tiny sip of wine.) By custom, “Elijah’s Cup” has been embel - lished to become an artful goblet, a chalice never used for any pu rpose other than for the Elijah ritual at the Passover meal.

The Roman governor, called Procurator, made sure that the Jews chose as Ethnarch (“Head of the Jewish Council”) to serve as the Temple’s High Priest, and at first also a “King of the Jews” (not “King of Judea” as a country), whomever Rome preferred. From 36 to 4 b.c.e. the king was Herod, descended of Edomite converts to Judaism, who was the choice of two Roman generals (of Cleopatra fame): Mark Anthony and Octavian. Herod left a legacy of monumental structures, including the enhancement of the Temple Mount and the strategic palace-cum-fortress of Ma - sada at the Dead Sea; he also paid heed to the governor’s wis hes as a de facto vassal of Rome. It was into a Jerusalem enlarged and magnified by Hash - monean and Herodian constructions , thronged with pilgrims for the Passover holiday, that Jesus of Nazareth arrived—in a.d. 33 (according to the accepted scholarly dating). At that t ime the Jews were allowed to retain only a religious author - ity, a council of seventy elders called the Sanhe drin ; there was no longer a Jewish king; the land, no longer a Jewish state but a Roman province, was governed by the Procurator Pontius Pilate, ensconced in the Antonia Citadel that ad- joined the Temple. Tensions between the Jewish populace and the Roman m asters of the land were rising, and resulted in a series of bloody riots in Jerusalem.

When Jesus arrived (with his disciples) this time,"},{"pageNumber":290,"pageContent":"283  Jerusalem:  A Chalice,  V anished  the situation was certainly not what was expected, not what t he biblical prophecies promised. Devout Jews—as Jesus most certainly was—were beholden to the idea of redemp - tion, of salvation by a Messiah, central to which was the sp ecial and everlasting bond between God and the House of David. It was clearly and most emphatically expressed in the magnificent Psalm 89 (19–29), in which Yahweh, speaking to His faithful followers in a vision, said: I have exalted one chosen out of the people; I have found David, my servant; With my holy oil have I anointed him . . . He shall call out to me: “Thou art my father, my God, the rock of my salvation!” And I as a Firstborn shall place him, supreme of all the kings on Earth. My compassion for him forever I will keep, My faithfulness I shall not betray; My covenant with him will not be violated, What I have uttered I shall not change . . . I shall make his seed endure forever, his throne [endure] as the D ays of Heaven. Was not that reference to the “Days of Heaven” a clue, a l inkage between the coming of a Savior and the prophesied End of Days? Was it not the time to see the prophecies come true? And so it was that Jesus of Nazareth, now in Jerusalem with his twelve disciples, determined to take matters into his own hands: if salvation requires an Anointed One of the House of David, he, Jesus, would be the one! His very Hebrew name— Y ehu-shuah (“Joshua”)—meant Yahweh’s Savior; and as for the requirement that the Anointed One (“Messiah”) be of the House of David, that he was: the very opening verse of the New Testament, in the Gospel According to St. Matthew, says: “ The book of the generations of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of"},{"pageNumber":291,"pageContent":"284 THE END OF DAYS Abraham. ” T hen, there and elsewhere in the New Testa - ment, the genealogy of Jesus is given through the genera - tions: Fourteen generations from Abraham to David; f ourteen generations from David to the Babylonian exile; and fourteen generations from then to Jesus. He was quali - fied, the Gospels assured one and all. Our sources for what happened next are the gospels and ot her books of the New Testament. We know that the “eye - witness reports” were in fact written long after the events; we k now that the codified version is the result of deliberations at a convocation called by the Roman emperor Constantine three centuries later; we know that “gnostic” manuscripts, like the Nag Hammadi documents or the Gospel of Judas, give different versions that the Church had reason to sup - press; we even know—which is an undisputed fact—that at f irst there was a Jerusalem Church led by the brother of Je - sus, aimed exclusively at Jewish followers, that was over - taken, superseded, and eliminated by the Church of Rome t hat addressed the gentiles. Yet follow we shall the “official” version, for it, by itself, links the Jesus events in Jerusalem to all the previous centuries and millennia, as told heretofore in this book. First, any doubt, if it still exists, that Jesus came to Jerusa - lem at Passover time and that the “Last Supper” was the Pa ssover Seder meal must be removed. Matthew 26: 2, Mark 14: 1, and Luke 2 2: 1 quote Jesus saying to his disciples as they arrived in Jerusalem: “Ye know that after two days is the Feast of the Passover”; “After two days was the feast of the Passover, of the unleavened bread”; and “Now the feast of the unleavened bread drew nigh, and it is called the Pass - over.” The three gospels, in the same chapters, then state that J esus told his disciples to go to a certain house, where they would be able to celebrate the Passover meal with which the holiday begins. Next to be tackled is the matter of Elijah, the herald of the co ming Messiah ( Luke 1: 17 even quoted the relevant verses in Malachi ). According to the Gospels, the people who heard about the miracles that Jesus performed—miracles that were"},{"pageNumber":292,"pageContent":"285  Jerusalem:  A Chalice,  V anished  so similar to those by the prophet Elijah—at first wondered w hether Jesus was Elijah reappeared. Not saying no, Jesus challenged his closest disciples: “What say you that I am? And Peter answered and said unto him: Thou art the Anointed One” ( Mark 8: 28–29). If so, he was asked, where is Elijah, who had to appear f irst? And Jesus answered: Yes, of course, but he has already come! And they asked him, saying: Why say the scribes that Elias must first? And he answered and told them: Elias verily cometh first, and restoreth all things . . . But I say unto you That Elias has indeed come. Mark 9: 11,13 This was an audacious statement, the test of which was ab out to come: for if Elijah has in fact returned to Earth, “ is indeed come ,” thereby fulfilling the prerequisite for the Messiah’s coming— then he had to show up at the Seder and drink from his cup of wine! As custom and tradition required, the Cup of Elijah, filled wi th wine, was set on the Seder table of Jesus and his disci - ples. The ceremonial meal is described in Ma rk , Chapter 14. Conducting the Seder, Jesus took the unleavened bread (now called Matzoh ) and made the blessing, and broke it, and gave pieces of it to his disciples. “And he took the cup , and when he had thanks, he gave it to them, and they all drank of it” ( Mark 14: 23). So, without doubt, the Cup of Elijah was there, but Da Vi nci chose not to show it . In this The Last Supper painting, which could only be based on the New Testament passages, Jesus is not holding the crucial cup, and nowhere is there a wine cup on the table! Instead there is an inexplicable gap to the right of Jesus (Fig. 125) , and the disciple to his right is bending sideways as if to allow someone unseen to come between them:"},{"pageNumber":293,"pageContent":"286 THE END OF DAYS Figure 125 Was the thoroughly theologically correct Da Vinci im - plying that an unseen Elijah did come through the open w indows, behind Jesus, and took away the cup that was his?

The answer to the second question has preoccupied Mankind ever since the watershed events in Je - rusalem more than two thousand years ago.

It is enough reason to ask: Will history repeat itself— does history repeat itself, in some mysterious way, every twenty-one centuries? A war, an annihilating conflagration, has been depicted as pa rt of the End of Days scenario in Ezekiel (chapters 38–39). Though “Gog of the land of Magog,” or “Gog and Magog,” are foreseen as the principal instigators in that final war, the list of combatants that shall be sucked into the battles en - compassed virtually every nation of note; and the focus of t he conflagration shall be “the dwellers of the Navel of the Earth”—the people of Jerusalem according to the Bible, but the people of “Babylon” as a replacement for Nippur to those for whom the clock stopped there. It is a spine-chilling realization that Ezekiel’s list of t hose widespread nations (38: 5) that will engage in the fi - nal war—Armageddon — a ctually begins with PERSIA— the very country (today’s Iran) whose leaders seek nuclear weapons with which to “wipe off the face of the Earth” the people who dwell where Har-Megiddo is! Who is that “Gog of the land of Magog,” and why does t hat prophecy from two and a half millennia ago sound so much like current headlines? Does the accuracy of such de - tails in the Prophecy point to the When— t o our time, to our century? Armageddon , a Fi nal War of Gog and Magog, is also an essential element of the End of Days scenario of the New Testament’s prophetic book, Revelation (whose full name is The Apocalypse of St. John the Divine ). It compares the instigators of the apocryphal events to two beasts, one of which can “make fire come down from heaven to earth, in sight of men.” Only an enigmatic clue is given for its iden - tity (13: 18): Here is wisdom: Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: It is the number of a man;"},{"pageNumber":298,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 291 and his number is six hundred and threescore and six. Many have attempted to decipher the mysterious number 666 , assuming it is a coded message pertaining to the End of Days. Because the book was written when the persecution of Christians in Rome began, the accepted interpretation is that the number was a code for the oppressor emperor Nero, the numerical value of whose name in Hebrew (NeRON QeSaR) added up to 666. The fact that he had been to the space plat - form in Baalbek, possibly to inaugurate the temple to Jupiter th ere, in the year a.d. 60 may—or may not—have a bearing on the 666 puzzle. That there could be more to 666 than a connection to Nero is s uggested by the intriguing fact that 600, 60, and 6 are all basic numbers of the Sumerian sexagesimal system, so that the “code” might hark back to some earlier texts; there were 600 Anunnaki, Anu’s numerical rank was 60, Ishkur/Adad’s rank was 6. Then, if the three numbers are to be multiplied rather than added, we get 666 = 600 × 60 × 6 = 216,000, which is the familiar 2160 (a zodiacal age) times 100—a re - sult that can be speculated on endlessly. Then there is the puzzle that when seven angels reveal the s equence of future events, they do not link them to Rome; they link them to “ Babylon .” The conventional explanation has been that, like the 666 was a code for the Roman ruler, so was “Babylon” a code word for Rome. But Babylon was already gone for centuries when Revelation was written, and Revela - tion, s peaking of Babylon, unmistakably links the prophecies to “the great river Euphrates” (9: 14), even describing how “the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates,” drying it up so that the Kings of the East would be joined in the fighting (16: 12). The talk is of a city/land on the Euphra - tes, not on the Tiber River. Since Re velation ’s prophecies are of the future, one must conclude that “Babylon” is not a code — Babylon means Babylon, a future Babylon that will get involved in the war of “Armageddon” (which verse 16: 16 correctly explains as"},{"pageNumber":299,"pageContent":"292 THE END OF DAYS the name of “a place in the Hebrew tongue”— Ha r-Megiddo , Mount Megiddo, in Israel)—a war involving the Holy Land. If that future Babylon is indeed today’s Iraq, the prophetic v erses are again chilling, for as they foretell current events leading to the fall of Babylon after a brief but awesome war, they predict the breakup of Babylon/Iraq into three parts! (16: 19). Like the Book of Daniel , which predicted phases of trib - ulations and trying stages in the messianic process, so has Re velation tried to explain the enigmatic Old Testament prophecies by describing (Chapter 20) a First Messianic Age with “a First Resurrection” lasting a thousand years, fol - lowed by a Satanic reign of a thousand years (when “Gog and Mag og” will engage in an immense war), and then a second messianic time and another resurrection (and thus the “Sec - ond Coming”). Unavoidably, these prophecies triggered a frenzy of specu - lation as the year a.d. 2 000 approached: speculation regard- ing the Millennium a s a point in time, in the history of Mankind and the Earth, when prophecies would come true. Besieged with millennium questions as the year 2000 ne ared, I told my audiences that nothing will happen in 2000 , and not only because the true millennium point count - ing from the birth of Jesus had already passed, Jesus having b een born, by all scholarly calculations, in 6 or 7 b.c.e. The main reason for my opinion was that the prophecies ap - peared to envision not a li near timeline—year one, year two, year nine hundred, and so on—but a cyclical repetition of events, the fundamental belief that “The First Things shall be the Last Things”—something that can happen only when history and historical time move in a circle, where the start point is the end point, and vice versa. Inherent in this cyclical plan of history is the concept of G od as an everlasting divine entity who had been present at the Beginning when Heaven and Earth were created and who will be there at the End of Days, when His kingdom shall be renewed upon His holy mount. It is expressed in repeated statements from the earliest biblical assertions through the"},{"pageNumber":300,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 293 latest Prophets, as when God announced, through Isaiah (41: 4 , 44: 6, 48: 12): I am He, I am the First and also the Last I am . . . From the Beginnings the Ending I foretell, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done. Isaiah 48: 12, 46: 10 And equally so (twice) in the New Testament’s Book of Rev - elation : I am Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the Ending, sayeth the Lord— Which is, and which was, and which will be. Revelation 1: 8 Indeed, the basis for prophecy was the belief that the End w as anchored in the Beginning, that the Future could be pre - dicted because the Pa st was known—if not to Man, then to God: I am the one “ who from the Beginning tells the End ,” Ya hwe h s a i d ( Isaiah 46: 10). The Prophet Zechariah (1: 4, 7: 7, 7: 12) foresaw God’s plans for the future— the Last Days — in terms of the Past, the First Days . This belief, which is restated in the Ps alms , in Proverbs , and in the Book of Job , was viewed as a universal divine plan for the whole Earth and all its nations. The Prophet Isaiah, envisioning the Earth’s nations gathered to find out what is in store, described them asking each other: “Who among us can tell the future by letting us hear the First Things?” (41: 22). That this was a universal tenet is shown in a collection of Assyrian Prophecies, when the god Nabu told the Assyrian king Esarhaddon: “ The future shall be like the past .” This cyclical element of the biblical Prophecies of the Return l eads us to one current answer to the question of WHEN."},{"pageNumber":301,"pageContent":"294 THE END OF DAYS A cyclical revolving of historical time was found, the rea der will recall, in Mesoamerica, resulting from the mesh - ing, like the gears of wheels, of two calendars (see Fig. 67), c reating the “bundle” of 52 years, on the occurring of which—after an unspecified number of turns—Quetzalcoatl (alias Thoth/Ningishzidda) promised to return. And that in - troduces us to the so-called Ma yan Prophecies , according to which the End of Days will come about in a.d. 2012. The prospect that the prophesied crucial date is almost at ha nd has naturally attracted much interest, and merits ex - plaining and analyzing. The claimed date arises from the f act that in that year (depending how one calculates) the time unit called Baktun will complete its thirteenth turn. Since a Baktun lasts 144,000 days, it is some kind of a milestone. Some errors, or fallacious assumptions, in this scenario ne ed to be pointed out. The first is that the Baktun belongs not to the two “meshing” calendars with the 52-year promise (the Haab and the Tzolkin ), but to a third and much older calendar called The Long Count. It was introduced by the Olmecs—Africans who had come to Mesoamerica when Thoth was exiled from Egypt—and the count of days actu - ally began with that event, so that Day One of the Long Cou nt was in what we date as August 3113 b.c.e. Glyphs in that calendar represented the following sequence of units: 1 kin = 1 day 1 Uinal = 1 kin × 20 = 20 days 1 Tun = 1 kin × 360 = 360 days 1 Ka-tun = 1 tun × 20 = 7,200 days 1 Bak-tun = 1 Ka-tun × 20 = 144,000 days 1 Pictun = 1 Bak-tun × 20 = 2,880,000 days These units, each a multiple of the previous one, thus con - tinued beyond the Baktun with ever-increasing glyphs. But s ince Mayan monuments never reached beyond 12 Baktuns, whose 1,728,000 days were already beyond the Mayan exis- tence, the 13th Baktun appears as a real milestone. Besides, Ma yan lore purportedly held that the present “Sun” or Age"},{"pageNumber":302,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 295 would end with the 13th Baktun, so when its number of days ( 144,000 × 13 = 1,872,000) is divided by 365.25, it results in the passage of 5,125 years; when the b.c.e. 3113 is deducted, the result is the year a.d. 20 12. This is an exciting as well as an ominous prediction. But t hat date has been challenged, already a century ago, by scholars (like Fritz Buck, El Calendario Maya en la Cultura de Tiahuanacu ) who pointed out that as the above list indi - cates, the mutiplier, and thus the divider, should be the calen- d ar’s own mathematically perfect 360 and not 365.25. That way, the 1,872,000 days result in 5,200 years—a perfect re - sult, because it represents exactly 100 “bundles” of Thoth’s m agical number 52. Thus calculated, Thoth’s magical year of the Return would be a.d. 2087 (5200 − 3113 = 2087). One could stand even that wait; the only fly in the oint - ment is that t he Long Count is a linear time count, and not the required cyclical one , so that its counted days could roll on to the fourteenth Baktun and the fifteenth Baktun and on and on. All that, however, does not eliminate the significance of a prophet ic millennium. Since the source of “millennium” as an escatological time had its origins in Jewish apocryphal writings from the 2nd century b.c.e. , the search for mean - ing must shift in that direction. In fact, the reference to “a t housand”—a millennium—as defining an era had its roots way back in the Old Testament. Deuteronomy (7: 9) assigned to the duration of God’s covenant with Israel a period of “a thousand generations”—an assertion repeated ( I Chronicles 16:15) when the Ark of the Covenant was brought to Jerusa - lem by David. The Psalms repeatedly applied the number “ thousand” to Yahweh, his wonders, and even to his chariot ( Psalm 68: 17). Directly relevant to the issue of the End of Days and the R eturn is the statement in Psalm 90: 4—a statement attrib - uted to Moses himself—that said of God that “ a t housand years, in thy eyes, are but as one day that has passed. ” This statement has given rise to speculation (which started soon after the Roman destruction of the Temple) that it was a way"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"296 THE END OF DAYS to figure out the elusive messianic End of Days: if Creation, “ The Beginning,” according to Genesis, took God six days, and a divine day lasts a thousand years, the result is a dura - tion of 6,000 years from Beginning to End. The End of Days, i t has thus been figured, will come in the Anno Mundi year 6,000. Applied to the Hebrew calendar of Nippur that began in 37 60 b.c.e., this means that the End of Days will occur in a.d. 2240 ( 6000 − 3760 = 2240). This third End of Days calculation may be disappointing or co mforting—it depends on one’s expectations. The beauty of this calculation is that it is in perfect harmony with the Sumerian sexagesimal (“base 60”) system. It might even prove in future to be correct, but I don’t think so: it is again linear—and it is a cyclical time unit that is called for by the prophecies. With none of the “modern” predicted dates workable, one m ust look back at the olden “formulas”—do what had been advised in Isaiah , “ look at the signs backwards .” We have two cyclical choices: the Divine Time orbital period of Nib - iru, and the Celestial Time of the zodiacal Precession. Which one is i t? That the Anunnaki came and went during a “window of opp ortunity” when Nibiru arrived at Perigee (nearest the Sun, and thus the closest to Earth and Mars) is so obvious that some readers of mine used to simply deduct 3600 from 4000 (as a round date for Anu’s last visit), resulting in 400 b.c.e. , or deduct 3,600 from 3760 (when the Nippur calendar began)— as the Maccabbees did—and arrive at 160 b.c.e. Either way, the next arrival of Nibiru is way in the distant future. In fact, as the reader now knows, Nibiru arrived earlier, ci rca 560 b.c.e. When considering that “digression,” one must keep in mind that the perfect SAR (3600) has always been a mathematical orbital period, because celestial or- bits—of planets, comets, asteroids—digress from orbit to orbit due to the gravitational tug of other planets near which they pass. To use the well-tracked Halley’s Comet as an ex - ample, its given period of 75 years actually fluctuates from"},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 297 74 to 76; when it last appeared in 1986, it was 76 years. Ex - tend Halley’s digression to Nibiru’s 3600, and you get a plus/ m inus variant of about 50 years each way. There is one other reason for wondering why Nibiru had d igressed so much from its wonted SAR: the unusual occur - rence of the Deluge circa 10900 b.c.e . During its 120 SARs before t he Deluge, Nibiru orbited without causing such a catastrophe. Then something unusual happened that brought Nibiru closer to Earth: combined with the slippage conditions of the ice sheet covering Antarctica, the Deluge occurred. What was that “something unusual”? The answer may well lie farther out in our solar system, w here Uranus and Neptune orbit—planets whose many moons include some that, inexplicably, orbit in an “opposite” (“retrograde”) direction—the way Nibiru orbits. One of the great mysteries in our solar system is the fact t hat the planet Uranus literally lies on its side—its north- south axis faces the Sun horizontally instead of being vertical to it. “Something” gave Uranus a “big whack” sometime in its past, NASA’s scientists said—without venturing to guess what the “something” was. I have often wondered whether that “something” was also what caused the huge mysterious “chevron” scar and an unexplained “ploughed” feature that NASA’s Voyager 2 found on Uranus’s moon Miranda in 1986 (Fig. 128) —a moon that is different in numerous ways from Figure 128"},{"pageNumber":305,"pageContent":"298 THE END OF DAYS the other moons of Uranus. Coul d a celestial collision with a passing Nibiru and its moons cause all that? In recent years astronomers have ascertained that the outer la rge planets have not stayed put where they were formed, but have been drifting outward, away from the Sun. The studies concluded that the shift has been most pronounced in the case of Uranus and Neptune (see sketch, Fig. 129 ), and that can explain why nothing happened out there for many Nibiru orbits—then suddeny something did. It is not implau - sible to assume that on its “Deluge” orbit Nibiru encountered t he drifting Uranus, and one of Nibiru’s moons struck Ura - nus, t ilting it on its side; it could even be that the strike “weapon” was the enigmatic moon Miranda— a moon of Nibiru —striking Uranus and ending up captured to orbit Uranus. Such an occurrence would have affected the orbit of Nibiru, slowing it down to about 3450 Earth-years rather than 3600, and resulting in a post-Diluvial reappearance schedule of circa 7450, circa 4000, and circa 550 b.c.e. If that is what had happeed, it would explain the “early” a rrival of Nibiru in 556 b.c.e. —and suggest that its next ar - rival will be circa a.d . 2900 . For those who associate the prophesied cataclysmic events with the return of Nibiru— “Planet X” to some—the time is not at hand. Figure 129"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 299 But any notion that the Anunnaki limited their com - ings and goings to a single short “window” at the planet’s p erigee is, however, incorrect. They could keep coming and going at other times as well. The ancient texts record numerous instances of back- a nd-forth travel by the gods with no indication of a link to the planet’s proximity. There are also a number of tales of Earth-Nibiru travel by Earthlings that omit any assertion of Nibiru seen in the skies (a sight stressed, on the other hand, when Anu visited Earth circa 4000 b.c.e. ). In one instance Adapa, a son of Enki by an Earthling woman, who was given Wisdom but not immortality, paid a very short visit to Nibiru, accompanied by the gods Dumuzi and Ningish - zidda. Enoch, emulating the Sumerian Enmeduranki, also ca me and went, twice, in his lifetime on Earth. This was possible in at least two ways, as shown in Fig. 130 : one b y a spaceship accelerating on Nibiru’s incoming phase (from point A ), arriving well ahead of perigee time; the other by decelerating a spacecraft (at point B ) during Nibiru’s outbound phase, “falling back” toward the Sun (and thus to Earth and Mars). A short visit to Earth, like the one by Anu, could take place by combining “A” for arrival and “B” for outbound departure; a short visit to Nibiru (as by Adapa) could take place by reversing the procedure—by leaving Figure 130"},{"pageNumber":307,"pageContent":"300 THE END OF DAYS Earth to intercept Nibiru at “A” and departing from Nibiru at “ B” for the return to earth, and so on. A Return of the Anunnaki at a time other than the pla net’s return can thus take place, and for that we are left with the other cyclical time—zodiacal time. I have called it, in Wh en Time Began , Celestial Time , dis- tinct from yet serving as a link between Earthly Time (our p lanet’s orbital cycle) and Divine Time (the clock of the Anunnaki’s planet). If the expected Return will be of the Anunnaki rather than of their planet, then it behooves us to seek the solution to the enigmas of gods and men through the clock that has linked them—the cyclical zodiac of Celes - tial Time. It was invented, after all, by the Anunnaki as a w ay to reconcile the two cycles; their ratio—3600 for Nibiru, 2l60 for a zodiacal Age—was the Golden Ratio of 10:6. It resulted, I have suggested, in the sexagesimal system on which Sumerian mathematics and astronomy were based (6 × 10 × 6 × 10 and so on). Berossus, as we have mentioned, deemed the zodiacal A ges to be turning points in the affairs of gods and men and held that the world periodically undergoes apocalyptic ca - tastrophes, either by water or by fire, whose timing is deter - mined by heavenly phenomena. Like his counterpart Ma netho in Egypt, he also divided prehistory and history into divine, semidivine, and postdivine phases, with a grand total of 2,160,000 years of “the duration of this world.” This—wonder of wonders!—is exactly one thousand—a millennium!—zodiacal ages. Scholars studying ancient clay tablets dealing with math - ematics and astronomy were astounded to discover that th e tablets used the fantastic number l2960000—yes, 12,960,000—as a starting point. They concluded that this could only be related to the zodiacal ages of 2,160, whose multiples result in 12,960 (if 2,160 × 6), or 129,600 (if 2,160 × 60), or 1,296,000 (if multiplied by 600); and—won- der of wonders!—the fantastic number with which these ancient lists begin, 12,960,000, is a multiple of 2,160 by 6,000—as in the divine six days of creation."},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 301 That major events, when the affairs of the gods affected t he affairs of men, were linked to zodiacal ages has been shown throughout this volume of The Earth Chronicles . As each Age began, something momentous took place: the Age of Taurus signaled the grant of civilization to Mankind. The Age of Aries was ushered in by the nuclear upheaval and ended with the Departure. The Age of Pisces arrived with the destruction of the Temple and the beginning of Christi - anity. Sh ould one not wonder whether the prophetic End of Days really means End of (zodiacal) Age? Were the “time, times, and a half ” of Daniel simply a ter - minology referring to zodiacal ages? The possibility was p ondered, some three centuries ago, by none other than Sir Isaac Newton . Best known for his formulation of the natural laws governing celestial motions—such as planets orbiting the Sun—his interests also lay in religious thought, and he wrote lengthy treatises about the Bible and biblical prophe - cies. He considered the celestial motions that he formulated to b e “the mechanics of God,” and he strongly believed that the scientific discoveries that began with Galileo and Coper - nicus and were continued by him were meant to happen w hen they did. This led him to pay particular attention to the “mathematics of Daniel.” In March 2003 the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC) startled the scientific and religious establishments with a program on Newton that revealed the existence of a document, handwritten by him on front and back, that calcu - lated the End of Days according to Daniel’s prophecies. Newton wrote his numerical calculations on one side of t he sheet, and his analysis of the calculations as seven “prop - ositions” on the paper’s other side. A close examination of t he document—a photocopy of which I am privileged to have—reveals that the numbers that he used in the calcula - tions include 216 and 2160 several times—a clue to me to u nderstand what his line of thought was: he was thinking of zodiacal time—to him, that was the Messianic Clock! He summed up his conclusions by writing down a set of t hree “not before” and a “not later than” timetable for Dan- iel’s prophetic clues:"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"302 THE END OF DAYS • Between 2132 and 2370 according to one clue given to Da niel, • Between 2090 and 2374 according to a se cond clue, • Between 2060 and 2370 for the crucial “time, t imes & half time.” “ Si r Isaac Newton predicted the world would end in the year 2060 ,” the BBC announced. Not exactly, perhaps— but as the table of zodiacal ages in an earlier chapter shows, he was not far off the mark in two of his “not earlier than” dates: 2060 and 2090 . The original cherished document of the great Englishman is no w kept in the Department of Manuscripts and Archives of the Jewish National and University Library— in Jerusa - lem ! A coincidence? It was in my 1990 book G enesis Revisited that the “Phobos Incident”—a hushed-up event—was first publicly revealed. It concerned the loss, in 1989, of a Soviet spacecraft sent to ex - plore Mars and its possibly hollow moonlet called Phobos. In fact, not one but two Soviet spacecraft were lost. Named Ph obos 1 and Phobos 2 to indicate their purpose—to probe Mars’ moonlet Phobos—they were launched in 1988, to reach Mars in 1989. Though a Soviet project, it was sup - ported by NASA and European agencies. Ph obos 1 just van- ished—no details or explanation were ever publicly given. Phobos 2 did make it to Mars, and started to send back pho - tographs taken by two cameras—a regular one and an infra - red one. Amazingly or alarmingly, they included pictures of the sha dow of a cigar-shaped object flying in the planet’s skies between the Soviet craft and the surface of Mars (Fig. 131 by the two cameras). The Soviet mission chiefs described the object that cast the shadow as “something which some may call a flying saucer.” Immediately, the spacecraft was di - rected to shift from Mars orbit to approach the moonlet and, f rom a distance of 50 yards, bombard it with laser beams."},{"pageNumber":310,"pageContent":"Armageddon and Prophecies of the Return 303 Figure 131 The last picture Phobos 2 sent showed a missile coming at it from the moonlet (Fig. 132) . Immediately after that, the spacecraft went into a spin and stopped transmitting—de- stroyed by the mysterious missile. The “Phobos incident” remains, officially, an “unex - plained accident.” In fact, right thereafter, a secret commis - sion on which all the leading space nations were represented spr ang into action. The commission and the document it for - mulated merit more scrutiny than they received, for they ho ld the key to understanding what the world’s leading na - tions really know about Nibiru and the Anunnaki. The geopolitical events that resulted in the secret group’s f ormation began with the discovery, in 1983, of a “Neptune - sized planet” by IRAS—NASA’s Infra-Red Astronomical S atellite—which scanned the edges of the solar system not visually but by detecting heat-emitting celestial bodies. The search for a tenth planet was one of its stated objectives, and indeed it found one—determining that it was a planet be - cause, detected once and then again six months later, it was c learly moving in our direction.

Work - ing feverishly, it formulated in Ap ril 1989 a set of guidelines known as the Declaration of Principles Concerning Activi - ties Following the Detection of Extraterrestrial Intelligence, by which the procedures to be followed after re ceiving “a signal or other evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence” were agreed upon. The “signal,” the group revealed, “might not b e simply one that indicates its intelligent origin but could be an actual message that may need decoding.” The agreed procedures included undertakings to delay disclosure of the contact for at least twenty-four hours before a response is made . This was surely ridiculous if the message had come from a planet light years away . . . No, the preparations were for a nearby encounter!

To me, the Earth-Mars cylinder seal (see Fig. 113) is both a depi ction of the Past and a foretelling of the Future because it bears a date— a date indicated by the sign of two fishes— the Age of Pisces . Does it tell us: What had taken place in a previous Age of P isces will be repeated again in the Age of Pisces? If the prophecies are to come true, if the First Things shall be the Last Things, if the Past is the Future—the answer has to be Yes. We are still in the Age of Pisces.
