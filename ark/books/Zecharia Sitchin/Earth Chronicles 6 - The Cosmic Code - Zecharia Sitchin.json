If not the most enigmatic, it certai nly is the most puzzling, and for sure one rooted in great ant iquity. It is a structure that has no parallel among the remai ns of the great civilizations that had flourished in the Near East in past millennia—at least so far as has been uncovered. It s closest parallels are thousands of miles away, across the s eas and on other continents; and what it mostly brings to mind is Stone- henge in faraway Britain. There, on a windswept plain in England about eighty miles southwest of London, circles of imposing megaliths form the most important prehistoric monument in the whole of Britain. There, a semicircle of huge upright stones that hav e been connected at their tops by lintel stones encompasse s within it a semicircle of smaller stone uprights, and is s urrounded in turn by two circles of other megaliths. The mult itudes that visit the site find that only some of the megaliths still remain standing, while others have collapsed to the ground or are somehow gone from the site. But scholars and resear chers have been able to figure out the configuration of t he circles- within-circles (Fig. 1, which highlights the still- standing megaliths), and observe the holes indicating where two other circles—of stones or perhaps wooden pegs—had once e x- isted, in earlier phases of Stonehenge. The horseshoe semicircles, and a fallen large megal ith nicknamed the Slaughter Stone, indicate beyond doub t that the structure was oriented on a northeast-southwest axis. 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Figure I They point to a line of sight that passes between t wo stone uprights through a long earthworks Avenue, straight to the so-called Heel Stone (Fig. 2).

(give or take a century or so) to sunrise on the summer solstice day; and then realig ned circa 2000 B.C. and again circa 1550 B.C. toward sunrise on sum- mer solstice day in those times (Fig. 3). One of the shortest yet most fierce and ferocious r ecent wars in the Middle East was the Six Day War of 1967 , when the hemmed-in and besieged Israeli army defeated th e armies of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria and captured the Sinai peninsula, the West Bank of the Jordan River, and the Golan He ights. 2 THE COSMIC CODE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Figure 2 In the years that followed Israeli archaeologists c onducted extensive archaeological surveys and excavations in all those areas, bringing to light settlements from early Neo lithic times through biblical times to Greek, Roman, and Byzanti ne per- iods.

Not only was it discovered that it had bee n an ac- tively inhabited and cultivated area in the earlies t times of human habitation; not only were remains of settleme nts found from the several millennia preceding die Comm on Era. Virtually in the middle of nowhere, on a windswept plain (that had been used by the Israeli army for artille ry practice), piles of stones arranged in circles turned out—when viewed from me air—to be a Near Eastern \"Stonehenge\" (Fig. 4).

The outermost circle clearly showed that i t con- tained two breaks or openings, one located in the n ortheast and the other in the southeast—locations that indic ate an orientation toward the summer and winter solstices. Working to clear away fallen rocks and ascertain th e orig- inal layout, Israeli archaeologists exposed in the northeastern opening a massive square structure with two extende d '\"wings\" that protected and hid narrower breaks in the two next concentric walls behind it (Fig. 5); the build ing thus served as a monumental gate providing (and guarding ) an entrance into the heart of the stone complex. It wa s in the walls of this entryway that the largest basalt boul ders, weigh- ing as much as five and a half tons each, were foun d. The southeastern break in the outer ring also provided access to the inner parts of the structure, but there the ent ranceway did not possess the monumental building; but piles of f allen stones starting in this entranceway and leading out ward from it suggest the outlines of a stone-flanked avenue e xtending in the southeastern direction—an avenue that might have outlined an astronomical line of sight.

Such similarities were reason enough for the Israel i sci- entists to call in Dr. Anthony Aveni of the USA, an inter- nationally acclaimed authority on ancient astronomi es, especially those of the pre-Columbian civilizations of the Americas. His task was not only to confirm the astr onomical orientations underlying the design of the Golan sit e, but also to help determine its age—and thus, in addition to the For What question, also answer the question When. That the orientation of a structure—if aligned to t he sol- stices—can reveal the time of its construction, has been an accepted tool in archaeoastronomy since the publica tion of The Dawn of Astronomy by Sir Norman Lockyer in 1894 . The apparent movement of the Sun from north to sout h and back as the seasons come and wane is caused by the fact that the Earth's axis (around which the Earth rotat es to create the day/night cycle) is inclined to the plane (\"ecl iptic\") in which the Earth orbits the Sun. In this celestial d ance— though it is the Earth that moves and not the Sun—i t appears to observers on Earth that the Sun, moving back and forth, reaches some distant point, hesitates, stops, and t hen as if it changed its mind, starts back; crosses the equator, goes all the way to the other extreme, hesitates, and stops there, and goes back. The two crossings a year over the equato r (in March and September) are called equinoxes; the two stops, one in the north in June and one in the south in De cember, are called solstices (\"Sun Standstills\")—the summer and winter solstices for observers in the Earth's north ern hemi- sphere, as people at Stonehenge and on the Golan ha d been. Studying ancient temples, Lockyer divided them into two classes. Some, as the Temple of Solomon in Jerusale m and the temple to Zeus at a place called Baalbek in Leb anon,"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Star Stones 9 were built along an east-west axis that oriented th em to sunrise on the days of the equinoxes. Others, as ph ar- aonic temples in Egypt, were aligned on an axis inc lined southwest-northeast, which meant that they were ori ented to the solstices. He was surprised, however, to discov er that while in the former the orientation never changed ( so he called them Eternal Temples), the latter—such as the great Egyptian temples in Karnak—showed that as successive Pharaoh s needed to see the rays of the Sun strike the holy o f holies on the day of me solstice, they kept changing the dire ction of the avenues and corridors toward a slightly different p oint in the skies. Such realignments were also made at Stonehen ge. What had caused those directional changes? Lockyer' s an- swer was: changes in the Earth's inclination, resul ting from its wobble. Nowadays the inclination of the Earth's axis (\"obli quity\") to its orbital path (\"ecliptic\") is 23.5 degrees, a nd it is this inclination that determines how far northward or so uthward the Sun would appear to move seasonally. If this an gle of inclination were to remain unchanged forever, the s olstice points would also remain the same. But astronomers have concluded that the Earth's tilt (caused by its wobb le) changes over the centuries and millennia, rising and fallin g over and over again. Right now, as in the preceding several millennia, t he tilt has been in a narrowing phase. It was over 24 degre es circa 4000 B.C., declined to 23.8 degrees circa 1000 B.C. , and con- tinued to fall to its present smidgen under 23.5 de grees. The great innovation of Sir Norman Lockyer was to apply this change in Earth's obliquity to the ancient temples and estab- lish the dates of construction of the various phase s of the Great Temple in Karnak (Fig. 7) as well as for the phases of Stonehenge (as indicated by changes in the location of the Heel Stone, Fig. 3).

C .! By 2000 B.C., the scientists concluded, the Sun wou ld have appeared to a similar observer noticeably off-cente r, but probably still within the gateway. Five hundred yea rs later, the structure had lost its value as a precise astro nomical ob- servatory. It was, then, sometime between 1500 and 1200 B.C.—as confirmed by carbon dating of small artifac ts recovered there—that the central stone heap was enl arged to form a cairn—a stone mound under which a cavity has been dug out, probably to serve as a burial chamber. Uncannily, these phased dates are virtually identic al to the dates assigned to the three phases of Stonehenge. Because it was protected by the mound of stones abo ve it, the cavity under the cairn—the presumed burial cham ber—re- mained the most intact part of the ancient site. It was located with the aid of sophisticated seismic instruments a nd ground- penetrating radar. Once a large cavity had been ind icated, the excavators (led by Dr. Yonathan Mizrachi) dug a tre nch that led them into a circular chamber of over six feet i n diameter and about five feet high. It led to a larger chambe r, oval in shape, about eleven feet long and about four feet w ide. The latter's walls were constructed of six courses of b asalt stones rising in a corbelled fashion (i.e. slanting inward as the walls rose); the chamber's ceiling was made of two massiv e basalt slabs, each weighing some five tons. There was no coffin and no body, nor any other huma n or animal remains in either the chamber or antechamber . But the archaeologists did find, as a result of meticul ous sifting of the soil, a few gold earrings, several beads mad e of car- nelian semiprecious stone, flint blades, bronze arr owheads, and ceramic shards. They therefore concluded that i ndeed it was a burial chamber, but one that had been looted, probably in antiquity. The fact that some of the stones used to pave the chamber's floor were pried out reinforced the c onclusion that the place had been broken into by grave robber s."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 THE COSMIC CODE The finds have been dated to the period known as La te Bronze Age, which extended from about 1500 to 1200 B.C. That was the time frame of the Exodus of the Childr en of Israel from Egypt under the leadership of Moses, an d the conquest of the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua. Of the twelve tribes, the tribes of Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh were allotted parts of Trans- jordan, from the River Anion in the south to the fo othills of Mount Hermon in the north. Those domains included t he mountain range of Gilad east of the Jordan River an d the plateau that is now the Golan. It was therefore per haps un- avoidable that Israeli researchers turned to the Bi ble for an answer to the question: Who? According to the books of Numbers and Joshua, the n orth- ern part of the Gilead mountains was ruled by a kin g called Og from his capital of Bashan. The capture of Og's domain is described in Deuteronomy (chapter 3). \"Og and al l his men took the field against the Children of Israel,\" the nar- rative states. Winning the battle, the Israelites c aptured sixty towns that were \"fortified with high walls and gate s and barriers, apart from a great number of unwalled tow ns.\" The construction of high stone walls and gates—features of the enigmatic Golan site—was thus within the capabiliti es of the kingdoms in the time of King Og. Og, according to the Bible, was a big and stout man : \"His iron bedstead is nine cubits long and four cubits w ide\" (equivalent to over thirteen feet and six feet, res pectively). This giant size, the Bible hints, was due to his be ing a de- scendant of the Repha'im, a giantlike race of demig ods who had once dwelt in that land. (Other giantlike desce ndants of the Repha'im, including Goliath, are mentioned in t he Bible as siding with the Philistines at the time of David ). Combin- ing the references to the Repha'im with the biblica l account of the circular stone structure erected by Joshua a fter the crossing of the Jordan River, and the naming of the place Gilgal—\"The Circular Stone Heap\"—some in Israel hav e nicknamed the Golan site Gilgal Repha'im—\"The Circu lar Stone Heap of the Repha'im.\""},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"Star Stones 13 While the biblical verses alone do not support such a nam- ing, nor do they really link King Og to the burial chambers, the biblical assertions that the area had once been the domain of the Repha'im and that Og was descended of them a re quite intriguing, because we find the Repha'im and their offspring mentioned in Canaanite myths and epic tales. The te xts, which clearly place the divine and semidivine actio ns and events in the area we are dealing with here, were w ritten on clay tablets discovered in the 1930s at a coastal s ite in northern Syria whose ancient name was Ugarit. The texts desc ribe a group of deities whose father was El (\"God, the Lof ty One\") and whose affairs centered on El's son Ba'al (' 'th e Lord\") and his sister Anat (\"She who answers\"). The focus of B a'al's at- tention was the mountainous stronghold and sacred p lace Za- phon (meaning both \"the northern place\" and \"the pl ace of secrets\") and the arena of Ba'al and his sister was what now- adays is northern Israel and the Golan. Roaming the area's skies with them was their sister Shepesh (the name' s uncertain meaning suggests an association with the Sun); and of her the texts clearly state that \"she governs the Repha'im, the divine ones\" and rules over demigods and mortals. Several of the discovered texts deal with such invo lvement on the part of the trio. One. titled by scholars Th e Tale of Aqhat, pertains to Danel (\"Whom God Judges,\" Daniel in Hebrew), who—although a Rapha-Man (i.e. descended o f the Repha'im)—could not have a son. Growing old and de- spondent about not having a male heir, Danel appeal s to Ba'al and Anat, who in turn intercede with El. Gran ting the Rapha-Man's wish, El instills in him a \"quickening life- breath\" and enables him to mate with his wife and h ave a son whom me gods name Aqhat. Another tale, The Legend of King Keret (Keret. \"The Cap- ital, the Metropolis,\" is used as the name of both the city and its king), concerns the claim to immortality by Keret because of his divine descent. Instead, he falls il l; and his sons wonder aloud: \"How could an offspring of El, t he Mer- ciful One, die?

Granting appeals for mercy, El at the last moment s ent the goddess Shataqat, \"a female who removes the illness .\" to save Keret. \"She flies over a hundred towns, she fl ies over a multitude of villages\" on her rescue mission; arr iving at Keret's home in the nick of time, she manages to re vive him. But being only a demigod, Keret in the end did die. Was he then the one buried in the tomb within \"the sacred circuit, the mighty circuit, the circuit of broad span\"? Though the Ca- naanite texts give no chronological hint, it is evi dent that they relate events from the Bronze Age—a time frame that could well fit the date of the artifacts discovered in th e Golan site's tomb. Whether or not any of those legendary rulers ended up be- ing buried at the Golan site, we may never know for sure; es- pecially since the archaeologists studying the site raised the possibility of intrusive burials—namely, the entomb ment of a later-deceased in a burial place from earlier times , involving as often as not the removal of the earlier remains.

As at Stonehenge and other megalithic sites, so too re- garding the Golan site, the enigma of who built the m is only intensified by establishing their age and determini ng that an advanced knowledge of astronomy underlay their orie nta- tions. Unless they were indeed the divine beings th emselves, who was there capable of the feat—circa 3000 B.C. i n the case of the Golan site? In 3000 B.C. there was in western Asia only one civ iliza- tion high enough, sophisticated enough, and with an extraor- dinary astronomical knowledge, capable of planning, orienting astronomically, and carrying out the kind of major structures here considered: the Sumerian civilizati on. It blos- somed out in what is nowadays southern Iraq, \"sudde nly, unexpectedly, out of nowhere\" in the words of all s cholars. And w i t h i n a few centuries—an instant as human evol ution goes—accounted for virtually all the firsts of what we deem essential to a high civilization, from the wheel to the kiln and bricks and high-rise buildings, writing and poe try and music, codes of law and courts, judges and contract s, temples and priests, kings and administrators, schools and teachers, doctors and nurses; and amazing knowledge of mathem atics, exact sciences, and astronomy. Their calendar, stil l in use as the Jewish calendar, was inaugurated in a city call ed Nippur in 3760 B.C.—embracing all the sophisticated knowle dge re- quired for the structures we are discussing. It was a civilization mat preceded mat of Egypt by some eight hundred years and by a thousand years that of the Indus Valley. The Babylonians, Assyrians, Hittites, Elami tes, Ca- naanites, and Phoenicians followed later, some much later. They all bore the imprint and borrowed the underlyi ng firsts of the Sumerians; so did the civilizations mat in t ime rose in Greece and the Mediterranean islands. Did the Sumerians venture as far as me Golan Height s? Undoubtedly, for their kings and their merchants we nt west- ward toward the Mediterranean Sea (which they calle d the"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 THE COSMIC CODE Upper Sea), and sailed the waters of the Lower Sea (the Persian Gulf) to other distant lands. When Ur was t heir cap- ital, its merchants were familiar in all parts of t he ancient Near East. And one of Sumer's most famed kings, Gil ga- mesh—a famed king of Uruk (the biblical Erech)—in a ll probability passed through the site. The time was c irca 2900 B.C., soon after the Golan site was first construct ed. The father of Gilgamesh was the city's High Priest; his mother was the goddess Ninsun. Aiming to be a might y king and aggrandize his city, Gilgamesh started his reig n by chal- lenging the authority of the then-principal city of Sumer, Kish. A clay tablet describing the episode names the king of Kish Agga, and twice describes him as being \"stout.\" Kis h was then the capital of a wide domain that might have e xtended be- yond the Euphrates River; and one must wonder wheth er the stout king Agga might have been a forerunner of the giantlike Og of biblical fame: for the naming of kings after earlier pred- ecessors was a common Near Eastern practice. Proud, ambitious, and swashbuckling in his youth, G il- gamesh took hard his creeping aging. To sustain his prowess he took to dropping in on newlyweds in his city, cl aiming the royal right to be the first to have sex with th e bride. When the townspeople could not stand it anymore, they ap pealed to the gods for help; and the gods responded by cre ating a double for Gilgamesh. who stopped the king's shenan igans. Subdued. Gilgamesh grew gloomy and reflective. He w it- nessed people his age or even younger dying; and th en it occurred to him that there is another way: he was. after all, partly divine—not just a demigod, but two-thirds di vine, for it was not his father but his mother who was a godd ess! Should he. Gilgamesh, then die as a mortal, or be e ntitled to the everlasting life of the gods? He presented h is case to his mother. Yes, she told him, you are right. But i n order to attain the divine life span, you must ascend the he avens and reach the gods' abode. And the places from which su ch as- cents are possible, she told him, are under the com mand of his godfather Utu (later known as Shamash). Utu/Shamash tried to dissuade Gilgamesh: \"Who, Gilg a-"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"Star Stones 17 mesh, can scale heaven? Only the gods live forever under the Sun. As for Mankind, numbered are their days.\" Go, be with your family and your townsfolk, enjoy the rest of your days, the god said to him. The story of Gilgamesh and his quest for immortalit y is told in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a long text written on clay tablets and discovered by archaeologists in both th e original Sumerian and various ancient translations. As the t ale un- folds, we read that Gilgamesh was not dissuaded, an d an object that fell from the skies was deemed by him a sign from heaven that he should not give up. Agreeing to help, Ninsun revealed to him that there is a place in the Cedar Mountains—the Landing Place—from which Gilgamesh could ascend to the divine abode. It would be a jou rney fraught with dangers, she warned Gilgamesh. But wha t is the alternative? he asked her. If I fail in my quest, h e said, at least future generations will know that 1 tried. Giving her blessing to the journey, Ninsun insisted that the artificial man, Enkidu, go in front of Gilgames h and pro- tect him along the way. The choice was opportune, f or the area of their destination was the very area from wh ich Enkidu had come, the hills where he had roamed with the wi ld beasts. He explained to Gilgamesh how dangerous the un- dertaking would be; but Gilgamesh insisted on going . In order to reach the Cedar Mountains in what is no w Lebanon from Sumer (which was in what is now southe rn Iraq). Gilgamesh had to cross the plateau that we n ow call the Golan. And indeed we find it stated, in the pre amble to the epic in which the king's adventures and achieve ments are enumerated, that it was \"he who opened the mountain passes.\" It was a first that merited recalling, for there are no mountains in the land called Sumer. On their way Gilgamesh stopped several times to see k divine oracles from the Sun God.

One of the most recounted episodes in the king's ad ventures has been the incident in which he encountered two f erocious lions, fought them off, and killed mem with his bar e hands.

That was some two thousand years after Gilgamesh, and certainly n ot on the Golan Heights. Is the village's name, then, just a coinci- dence, or the lingering memory of a visitor called Gilgamesh becoming Samson? Of greater significance is the association with Kin g Keret.

Minos then commissioned the divine crafts man Daedalus to build in the Cretan capital Knossos an under- ground maze from which the bull-man would be unable to escape.

What was the Bull of Heaven—GUD.ANNA in Sume- rian? Many students of the Epic, such as Giorgio de Santil- lana and Hertha von Dechend in Hamlet's Mill, have come to the conclusion mat the Epic's events, taking pla ce on Earth, are but a mirror image of events taking plac e in Heaven. Utu/Shamash is the Sun, Inanna/lshtar is wh at she was later called in Greek and Roman times—Venus. Th e menacing guardian of the Cedar Mountains with me fa ce of a lion is the constellation of Leo (the Lion), and the Bull of Heaven the celestial group of stars that has been c alled— since Sumerian times!—the constellation of the Bull (Tau- rus). There are, indeed, Mesopotamian depictions with the Lion/ Bull theme (Fig. 11a and 11b); and as was first rem arked upon by Willy Hartner (The Earliest History of the Constel- lations in the Near East), in the fourth millennium B.C. the Sumerians would have observed the two constellation s in key zodiacal positions: the constellation of the Bull ( Taurus) as the constellation of the spring equinox and the con stellation of the Lion (Leo) as that of the summer solstice. The attributing of zodiacal connotations to epic ev ents on Earth, as told by the Sumerians, implies mat they h ad such celestial knowledge—in the fourth millennium B.C., some three millennia before the usually presumed time of the grouping of stars into constellations and the intro duction of the twelve zodiacal ones by the Greeks.

A thousand years after the probable stay of Gilgame sh at me Golan site, it was visited by another ancient VI P who also saw Fate written in the zodiacal constellation s. He was Jacob, the grandson of Abraham; and the time, by ou r cal- culations, was about 1900 B.C. A question that is often ignored regarding the mega lithic structures around the globe is, Why have they been con- structed where they are? The location obviously had to do with their particular purpose. The great pyramids o f Giza, we have suggested in our writings, served as anchors f or a Land- ing Corridor leading to a spaceport in the Sinai pe ninsula, and were emplaced precisely because of that link on the thir- tieth parallel north. Stonehenge, it was suggested by leading astronomers, was erected where it is because it is precisely there that its astronomical functions could combine both solar and lunar observations. Until more might come to li ght con- cerning the Golan Circles, the most likely reason f or its being where it is was that it lay astride one of the few linkways that connected two major international routes (in a ntiquity and still now): the King's Highway, which ran along the hills east of the Jordan River, and the Way of the Sea, w hich ran on the west along the coast of the Mediterranean Se a (Map). The two routes connected Mesopotamia and Egypt, Asi a and Africa—be it for peaceful trade or military invasio ns. The links between the two routes were dictated by geogr aphy and topography.

His name suggests t hat he was an oracle priest (Tirhu); the family's care to be known as Ibri (Hebrew) people suggests to us that they co nsidered themselves to be Nippurians—people from the city Ni ppur that in Sumerian was rendered NI.IBRU—\"The Beautifu l/ Pleasant Abode of Crossing.\" The religious and scie ntific center of Sumer, Nippur was the site of the DUR.AN. KI, the \"Bond Heaven-Earth,\" located in the city's sacred p recinct. It was the focal point for the preservation, study, and inter- pretation of accumulated astronomical, calendrical, and ce- lestial knowledge; and Abraham's father, Terah, was one of its priests. Circa 2100 B.C. Terah was transferred to Ur. The ti me was a period known to Sumerologists as Ur III, for it w as then that Ur, for the third time, became the capital not only of Sumer, and not only of an enlarged political entity called Sumer and Akkad, but also of a virtual empire that flourished and was held together not by force of arms but by a superior culture, a unified pantheon (what is known as Relig ion), a capable administration, and—not least of all—a thri ving trade. Ur was also the cult-center of the Moon god Nannar (later known by the Semitic people as Sin). Rapidly devel- oping events in Sumer and beyond triggered first th e transfer of Terah to Ur and then to a distant city called Ha rran. Sit- uated on the Upper Euphrates and its tributaries, t he city served as a major crossroads and trading post (whic h its name, meaning the Caravanry, indicated). Founded by Su- merian merchants, Harran also boasted a large templ e to the Moon god, so much so that the city was looked upon as an \"Ur away from Ur.\" On these transfers Terah took with him his family. The move to Harran included Abram (as he was then calle d), Terah's firstborn; a son called Nahor; the two sons ' wives, Sarai (later renamed Sarah) and Milcah; and Terah's grand- son Lot, me son of Abram's brother Haran who had di ed in Ur.

It was after that that God said unto Abram: \"Get th ee out of thy country, and out of thy birthplace, and from thy fa- ther's dwelling place, unto the land that I will sh ow thee... There I will make thee unto a great nation, and I w ill bless thee and make great thy name.\" And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew and all the people in their household and all of their belongings, and went to the Land o f Canaan; \"and Abram was seventy-five years old when he depar ted from Harran.\" His brother Nahor stayed behind, with his family, in Harran. Acting on divine instructions, Abram moved quickly in Canaan to establish a base in the Negev, the arid a rea of Canaan bordering the Sinai peninsula. On a visit to Egypt he was received in the Pharaoh's court; back in Canaan , he dealt with the local rulers. He then played a role in an international conflict, known in the Bible (Genesis 14) as the Wa r of the Kings. It was after that that God promised Abram th at his \"seed\" should inherit and rule the lands between th e Brook of Egypt and the Euphrates River. Doubting the prom ise, Abram pointed out that he and his wife Sarai had no children. So God told Abram not to worry. \"Look now toward th e heavens.\" he told him, \"and count the stars if you can... so numerous shall be thy seed.\" But Sarai remained barren even after that. So, at her suggestion Abram slept with her handmaid en Hagar, who did bear him a son, Ishmael. And then, m irac- ulously—after the upheaval of Sodom and Gomorrah, w hen the couple's names were changed to Abraham and Sara h— Abraham, then aged one hundred, had a son by his wi fe Sarah, aged ninety. Though not the firstborn, Sarah 's son, Isaac, was the Legitimate Heir under the Sumerian s ucces- sion rules that the Patriarch followed; for he was a son of his father's half sister: \"the daughter of my fathe r but not of my mother,\" Abraham said of Sarah (Genesis 20:12). It was after the death of Sarah, his lifelong compa nion, that Abraham, \"old and advanced in years\" (137 year s, by"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"Fate Has Twelve Stations 29 our calculations) became concerned about his unmarr ied son Isaac. Fearing that Isaac would end up marrying a C anaanite. he sent the overseer of his household to Harran, to find there a bride for Isaac from among the relatives mat had remained there. Arriving at the dwelling village of Nahor, h e met at the watering well Rebecca, who turned out to be Nah or's granddaughter and ended up going to Canaan to becom e Isaac's wife. Twenty years after they got married Rebecca gave bi rth to twins, Esau and Jacob. Esau was first to get marrie d, taking two wives right off, both of them Hittite lasses; \" they were a source of grief to Isaac and Rebecca.\" The troubl es are not detailed in the Bible, but the situation betwee n mother and daughters-in-law was so bad that Rebecca told I saac: \"1 am disgusted with life on account of the Hittite wo men; should Jacob too marry such a Hittite woman, of the local females, what good would life be to me?\" So Isaac c alled Jacob and instructed him to go to Harran, to his mo ther's family, to find there a bride. Heeding his father's words, \"Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Harran.\" Of Jacob's journey from the south of Canaan to dist ant Harran, the Bible reports only one episode—though a very significant one. It was the nighttime vision by Jac ob, \"as he came upon a certain place,\" of a stairway to heaven on which Angels of the Lord were ascending and descend ing. Awakened, Jacob realized that he had come upon \"a p lace of the Elohim and a gateway to heaven.\" He marked t he place by setting up there a commemorative stone, an d named the site Beth-El—\"The House of El,\" the Lord. And t hen, by a route that is not stated, he continued to Harr an. On the city's outskirts he saw shepherds gathering with their flocks at a well in the field. Addressing the m, Jacob inquired whether they knew Laban, his mother's brot her. In- deed we know him, the shepherds said, and here come s his daughter Rachel, shepherding his flocks.

Here, he said, we do not marr y off the younger daughter before her elder sister; why d on't you work for me another seven years, and then marry Rac hel, too? Still in love with Rachel, Jacob agreed. After seven years, he married Rachel; but the wily Laban held o n to the hard worker and capable shepherd that Jacob was, an d would not let him go. To keep Jacob from leaving, he let him start raising his own flocks: but the more Jacob succeede d, the more were Laban's sons grumbling with envy. And so it was, when Laban and his sons were away to shear their flocks of sheep, that Jacob gathered hi s wives and children and flocks and fled Harran. \"And he crosse d the river\"—the Euphrates—\"and set his course toward the mount of Gile'ad.\" \"On the third day it was told to Laban mat Jacob ha d escaped; so he took his kinfolk with him and pursue d after Jacob; and after seven days he caught up with him a t the mount of Gilead.\" Gilad—\"The Everlasting Stone Heap\" in Hebrew— the site of the circular observatory in the Golan! The encounter started with bitter exchanges and rec iprocal accusations. It ended with a peace treaty. In the m anner of boundary treaties of the time, Jacob selected a sto ne and erected it to be a Witnessing Pillar, to mark the b oundary be- yond which Laban would not cross into Jacob's domai ns nor would Jacob cross to Laban's domains. Such boundary stones, called Kudurru in Akkadian because of their rounded tops, have been discovered at various Near Eastern sites. As a rule, they were inscribed with details of the treaty and included the invoking of each side's gods as witnesses and guara ntors. Ad- hering to the custom, Laban called for \"he God of A braham"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"Fate Has Twelve Stations 31 and the gods of Nahor\" to guarantee the treaty. App rehensive, Jacob \"swore by the fear of his father Isaac.\" Then he added his own touch to the occasion and the place: And Jacob said to his sons: Gather stones; And they gathered stones and arranged them in a heap... And Jacob called the stone heap Gated. By a mere change of pronunciation, from Gilad to Ga l- Ed, Jacob changed the meaning of the name from its long- standing \"The Everlasting Stone Heap\" to \"The Stone Heap of Witnessing.\" How certain can we be that the place was that of th e Golan circles' site? Here, we believe, is the convincing final clue: In his oath of treaty, Jacob also described the sit e as Ha- Mitzpeh—the Observatory! The Book of Jubilees, an extrabiblical book that re counted the biblical tales from varied early sources, added a postscript to the recorded event: \"And Jacob made there a heap for a witness, wherefore the name of the place is called 'The Heap of Witness'; but before they used to call the land of Gilead the Land of the Repha'im.\" And thus we are back to the enigmatic Golan site an d its nickname Gilgal Repha'im. The Kudurru boundary stones that have been found in the Near East bore, as a rule, not just the terms of th e agreement and the names of the gods invoked as its guarantors , but also the gods' celestial symbols—sometimes of the Sun an d Moon and planets, sometimes of the zodiacal constel lations (as in Fig. 13)—all twelve of them.

Genesis 17:20 With that prophetic blessing, linked to the starry heavens as observed by Abraham, does the Bible for the firs t time record the number twelve and its significance. It t hen relates (Genesis 25) that Ishmael's sons—each a chief of a tribal state—indeed numbered twelve. Listing them by their names, the Bible emphasizes: \"Those were the sons of Ishma el ac- cording to their courts and strongholds—twelve chie ftains, each to his own nation.\" Their domains encompassed Arabia and the desertland to its north. The next time the Bible employs the number twelve i s in listing Jacob's twelve sons at the time when he was back at his famer's estate in Hebron. \"And the number of me sons of Jacob was twelve,\" the Bible states in Genesis 3 5, listing them by the names that later became familiar as nam es of the Twelve Tribes of Israel: Six by Leah: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun.

Yet the n umber of Jacob's children was twelve before that: The last c hild born by Leah was a daughter, Dinah. The list—perhaps by more than a coincidence—was thus made up of eleven males and one female, matching the list of zodiacal constella tions that is made up of one female (Virgo, the Virgin) and el even \"male\" ones. The zodiacal implications of the twelve children of Jacob (renamed Israel after he had wrestled with a divine being when crossing the Jordan River) can be discerned tw ice in the continuing biblical narrative. Once, when Josep h—a master of having and solving dream-omens—boasted to his brothers that he had dreamed that the Sun and the M oon (the elder Jacob and Leah) and eleven Kokhavim were bowi ng to him. The word is usually translated \"stars,\" but th e term (stemming from the Akkadian) served equally to deno te con- stellations. With Joseph's, the total added up to t welve. The implication, that his was a superior constellation, annoyed greatly his brothers. The next time was when Jacob, old and dying, called his twelve sons to bless them and foretell their future .

The strict adherence to the number twelve, emulatin g the twelve houses of the zodiac, involved another sleig ht of hand that usually escapes notice. After the Exodus and t he division of the Promised Land among the Twelve Tribes, they again included some rearrangement. Suddenly the account o f the Twelve Tribes who shared territories lists the two sons of Joseph (who were born to him in Egypt)—Manasseh and Ephra'im. The list, nevertheless, stayed at twelve: for, as prophesied by Jacob, the tribes of Simeon and Levi did not share in the territorial distributions and, as fore told, were dispersed among the other tribes.

Archaeologists excavating the remains of Jewish syn a- gogues in the Holy Land are sometimes puzzled to fi nd the floors of such synagogues decorated with the zodiac al circle of twelve constellations, depicted by their traditi onal symbols (Fig. 15). They tend to view the finds as aberratio ns resulting from Greek and Roman influences in the centuries be fore Christianity. Such an attitude, stemming from the b elief that the practice was prohibited by the Old Testament, i gnores the historical record—the Hebrews' familiarity with the zo- diacal constellations and their association with pr edictions of the future—with Fate. For generations and to this day, one can hear cries of Mazal-tov! Mazal-lov! at Jewish weddings or when a boy is circumcised.

Few realize, however, that though that is what is i ntended, that is not what the phrase means.

What was the meaning for the king or the land of the observation that, on the same evening, Jupit er rose in Sagittarius, Mercury in Gemini, and Saturn in Scorp io? Rec- ords literally requiring hundreds of tablets reveal that those heavenly phenomena were interpreted to foretell inv asions, famines, floodings, civil unrest—or, on tie other h and, long life for the king, a stable dynasty, victory in war , prosperity. Most of the records of such observations were writt en down as straight prose on clay tablets; sometimes, the a strological almanacs, as horoscopical handbooks, were illustrat ed with the symbols of the relevant zodiacal constellations . In all instances, Fate was deemed to be indicated by the h eavens. Today's horoscopic astrology's roots go back well b eyond the Babylonians, the \"Chaldeans\" of Greek reports. Coupled with the twelve-month calendar, the notion that Fat e and the Zodiac are two aspects of the same course of events un- doubtedly began at least when the calendar began—in Nip- pur, in 3760 B.C. (which is when the count of the J ewish calendar began). That such an association is really that old can be gleaned, in our opinion, from one of the Sum erian constellation names, that of ZI.BA.AN.NA. The term, un- derstood to mean \"Heavenly Fate,\" literally means \" Life- Decision in the heavens\" as well as \"The Heavenly S cales of Life.\" This was a concept that was recorded in E gypt in the Book of the Dead; it was a belief that one's ho pe for an eternal afterlife depends on the weighing of his he art on the Day of Judgment.

The answers require the crossing of a threshold—to a re- alization that underlying the seemingly astrologica l signifi- cance of dividing the heavens into twelve parts is a highly sophisticated astronomy—an astronomy, in fact, so a dvanced that Man, by himself, could not have possessed it w hen this division of the celestial circle began. In its annual orbit around the Sun, the Sun appears to be rising each month—a twelfth part of the year—in a d ifferent station. But the one that counts most, the one mat was deemed crucial in antiquity and which determines th e tran- sition from Age to Age (from Taurus to Aries to Pis ces and soon to Aquarius), is the one in which the Sun is s een rising on the day of the spring equinox (Fig. 17).

In a series of texts which formed the basis of anci ent sci- ence and religion, and which were rendered later on in other tongues, including the biblical Hebrew, the Sumeria ns' tales of the Anunnaki—of the ancient gods—have been the s tuff of which \"mythology\" was made. In the Western cultu res the mythology that jumps first to mind is that of t he Greeks; but it, as all the ancient mythologies and divine p antheons of all the nations—all over the world—stemmed from the original Sumerian beliefs and texts. There was a time, the Sumerians told, when civilize d Man was not yet on Earth, when animals were only wild a nd undomesticated and crops were not yet cultivated. A t that long-ago time there arrived on Earth a group of fif ty Anun- naki. Led by a leader whose name was E.A. (meaning \"whose home is water\"), they journeyed from their h ome planet NIBIRU (\"planet of crossing\") and, reaching Earth, splashed down in the waters of the Persian Gulf. A text known to scholars as the \"myth\" of Ea and the Earth de- scribes how that first group waded ashore, finding themselves in a marshland. Their first task was to drain the m arshes, clear river channels, check out food sources (found to be fish and fowl). They then began to make bricks from the clay of the soil and established the first-ever settlement on Earth by extraterrestrials. They named the habitat ERIDU, wh ich meant \"Home in the Faraway\" or \"Home away from home.\" That name is the origin of the name \"Earth\" in some of the oldest languages. The time: 445,000 yea rs ago. The astronauts' mission was to obtain gold by extra cting it from the waters of the gulf—gold needed for surv ival on Nibiru; for there the planet was losing its atmosph ere and thus also its internal heat, slowly endangering con tinued life on Nibiru. But the plan proved unworkable, and the leaders back home decided that gold could be obtained only the hard way—by mining it where it was in abundance, in sout heast- ern Africa. The new plan called for a substantial increase in t he num-"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"Divine Generations 43 ber of Anunnaki on Earth, and in rime they numbered six hundred. There was also a need for an elaborate ope ration of shipping out from Earth the refined gold and bri nging in varied supplies. For that three hundred additional Nibiruans were employed as IGI.GI (\"Those Who Observe and See \"), operating orbiting platforms and shuttlecraft. Nibi ru's ruler, AN (\"The Heavenly One\"—Anu in Akkadian) came to Earth to supervise the expanded presence and operat ions. He brought along with him two of his children: his son EN.LIL (\"Lord of the Command\"), a strict disciplinarian, t o serve as Chief of Operations; and a daughter. NIN.MAH (\"M ighty Lady\"), Chief Medical Officer. The division of duties between the pioneer Ea and t he newly arrived Enlil proved tricky, and at a certain moment of impasse Anu was willing to stay on earth and let one of his sons act as viceroy on Nibiru. In the end the t hree drew lots. Anu returned to reign on Nibiru; Enid's lot w as to stay in the area of the original landing and expand it t o an E.DIN (\"Home of the Righteous Ones\"). His task was to est ablish additional setdements, each with a specific functio n (a space- port, a Mission Control Center, a metallurgical cen ter, a med- ical center, or as landing beacons). And Ea's lot w as to organize the mining operations in southeastern Afri ca—a task for which he, as an outstanding scientist, was not un- suited. That the task was within his competence did not mea n that Ea liked the assignment away from the Edin. So to c ompen- sate him for the transfer he was given the title-na me EN.KI— \"Lord of Earth.\" Enlil might have thought mat it was just a gesture; Ea/ Enki, however, took the title more seriously. Thoug h both were sons of An, they were only half brothers. Ea/E nki was the Firstborn Son, and normally would have followed his father on the throne. But Enlil was a son born to A nu by a half sister of his; and according to the succession rules on Nibiru, that made Enlil the Legal Heir, even if not firstborn.

The matter became an acute problem for Enki in view of the presence on Earth of his son Marduk as well as Enlil's son Ninurta; for while the former was born to Enki by his official consort, the latter was born to Enlil (on Nibiru) by the half sister Ninmah (when both were unmarried; E nlil married Ninlil on Earth. Ninmah never married). And mat gave Ninurta precedence over Marduk in the line of succes- sion. Unabashed philanderer mat he was, Enki decided to r em- edy the situation by having sex with his half siste r, too, hop- ing also to have a son by her. The lovemaking produ ced a daughter instead. Unrelenting, Enki lost no time in sleeping with the daughter as soon as she matured; but she, too, bore a daughter. Ninmah had to temporarily immobilize En ki to put an end to his conjugal attempts. Though he could not attain a son by a half sister, Enki was not lacking other male offspring. In addition t o MAR.DUK ('\"Son of the Pure Mound\"), who had also co me from Nibiru, there were the brothers NER.GAL (\"Grea t Watcher\"), GIBIL (\"He of the Fire\"), N1N.A.GAL (\"Prince of the Great Waters\"), and DUMU.ZI (\"Son W ho Is Life\").

They were the above-mentioned ERESH.KI.GAL (\"Mistress of the Grea t Land\") and the twins UTU (\"The Shiny One\") and IN.ANNA (\"An's Beloved\")—the Shamash (\"Sun god\") and Ishtar (Astarte/Venus) of later pantheons.

The table in Fig. 20 identifies the Great Gods by p arentage and rank, highlighting the twelve Great Gods. But why twelve! The answer, we believe, lies in another major probl em that the Anunnaki faced once they changed their mission from a one-time mineral-extracting expedition to a long-te rm settle- ment with almost a thousand of them involved.

The most important consequence was the creation of The Adam: the text tells how Mankind was brought about.

Enlil demanded that the mutineers be given the maxi mum punishment: Enki described the impossibility of con tinuing the harsh toil; Anu sided with Enki.

So should we—for, in the depiction of the mo ment by a Sumerian artist on a cylinder seal (Fig. 23), we are shown the most momentous event in the annals of Man - kind: the moment when we, Homo sapiens, emerged on Earth. Using the successful genetic combination, the slow process of making duplicates—a process we now call cloning— was started. The reproduction, involving the need for A nunnaki females to serve as Birth Goddesses, cloned the Pri mitive Worker in sets of seven males, seven females. The B ible (Genesis chapters 1 and 5) tells it thus: On the day that Elohim created the Adam, in the likeness of Elohim he made him; Male and female created he them. Cloning was a slow process, requiring the service o f the Birth Goddesses because the new being, as a hybrid, could not procreate on its own.

Tinkering with what are now called chro- mosomes X and Y, he gave the human race the ability to procreate on its own. The Bible recorded the event in the tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden (the Sum erian E.DIN), in which Enki plays the role of the Nachash —a term translated \"serpent\" but which also means \"He who k nows/ possesses secrets.\" Though he had voted for the genetic experiment. Enl il did so reluctantly. Unlike the great scientist Enki. he was not carried away by the scientific challenge. Whimsical ly we might even imagine him saying, \"We did not come to an- other planet to play God\" ... He was infuriated whe n Enki performed the second (unauthorized) genetic manipul ation. \"You have made the Adam to be like one of us,\" able to procreate, he shouted; one more step, and he would also par- take of the fruit of the Tree of Life! So Mankind was banished from the Garden of Eden, to fend for itself; but instead of withering, it proli ferated and filled the Earth. Enid's displeasure grew when youn g An- unnaki began to fraternize with the Daughters of Ma n, even had children with them. In the Bible (Genesis chapt er 6) the story of me Nefilim (\"Those Who Came Down\"), the \"s ons of the Elohim\" who intermarried with human females, serves as a preamble to the story of the Deluge, the expla nation for the decision to wipe Mankind off the face of the Ea rth.

In its aftermath ev en Enlil relented. Realizing that after everything that the Anunnaki had built on Earth had been destroyed, they needed Mankind as a partner to make Earth habitable again. With En lil's con- sent, the Anunnaki began to advance Mankind cultura lly and technologically, in intervals that lasted 3,600 yea rs (matching the orbital period of Nibiru). The culmination of t he process was the great Sumerian civilization. On the eve of the Deluge, the Anunnaki took to thei r craft to escape the calamity, watching the havoc and tota l destruc- tion from Earth's skies. Not only Mankind perished: All that the Anunnaki had built in the past 432,000 years wa s wiped off the face of the Earth or buried under m i l e s - t h i c k layers of mud; and that included the spaceport they had in the E.DIN. As soon as the tidal wave began to recede, they cou ld bring their Earth-orbiting craft down on the Near E ast's high- est peaks, the peaks of Ararat. As more of the dry land ap- peared, they could use the Landing Place—a vast sto ne platform that had been erected before the Rood in t he Cedar Mountains of what is now Lebanon. But to resume the space operations they needed a spaceport: and the decisio n was made to erect it in the Sinai peninsula. The Landin g Corridor, as before me Rood, was anchored on me conspicuous t win peaks of Mount Ararat; the Landing Place was incorp orated; a new Mission Control Center (to replace the one th at had been in pre-Diluvial Nippur) was selected; and two artificial twin peaks, to anchor the Landing Corridor's termin us, were erected—the two still-standing great pyramids at Gi za in Egypt. Concerned by the simmering rivalries between what h as come to look like two distinct clans on Earth, the location of the spaceport and its auxiliary facilities assum ed major importance. To minimize frictions, the de facto div ision of domains between Enlil in the Edin and Enki in the A bzu was formalized, the former and his descendants granted dominion over Asia and nearby parts of Europe, the latter th e whole"},{"pageNumber":57,"pageContent":"Divine Generations 55 African continent. That meant that the pre-Diluvial Landing Place and the new Mission Control Center were in En lilite territory, and the great pyramids with their intric ate guidance systems in Enki'ite hands. It was therefore resolve d to place the area of the spaceport, the Sinai peninsula, in the neutral hands of Ninmah. To mark the event, she was given t he title- epithet NIN.HAR.SAG—\"Lady of the Mountainpeaks.\" Our suggestion that the gods of Egypt were none oth er than Enki and his clan may seem far-fetched at firs t glance. Weren't their names, to start with, entirely differ ent? The great Olden God of the Egyptians, for example, was called PTAH, \"The Developer\"; but that was also the meanin g of Enki's Sumerian epithet NUDIMMUD, \"The Maker of Art - ful Things.\" He was the Knower of Secrets, the Divi ne Ser- pent, in both pantheons; and (recalling his epithet \"whose home is water\") was depicted in both as the Divine Water- man (Figs. 14, 22), our Aquarius. In the Egyptian p antheon the Mistress of the Sinai was HATHOR, nicknamed \"Th e Cow\" in her old age; so too was Ninharsag nicknamed in Sumer as she grew old. Enki's principal son and successor in Egypt was RA, \"The Pure One,\" paralleling Marduk, \"Son of the Pure Mou nd,\" in Mesopotamia. The many other similarities between the two have been expounded in The Wars of Gods and Men . So were the reasons for identifying me Egyptian god THOTH, a son of Ptah and keeper of divine secret kn owl- edge, as the god Ningishzidda of the Sumerian texts . In time Ptah/Enki handed over the reign over Egypt to his son Marduk/Ra; but the latter was not appeased. Rei gn over the whole Earth was his birthright, he kept asserti ng; and that led to conflicts with the Enlilites that we describ ed as the Pyramid Wars. At one time—circa 8700 B.C. by our ca lcu- lations—he was forced to leave Egypt; according to Manetho (an Egyptian priest who wrote down me history and p rehis- tory of Egypt in Greek times) the reign was then as signed to Marduk's brother Thoth.

Texts, both Egyptian and Me sopo- tamian, that describe a tough space journey that be came es- pecially perilous near Saturn, may well have dealt with Ra/ Marduk's return voyage to Earth. The returning Ra/Marduk found an Earth that he coul d hardly recognize. In the intervening period, the Su merian civilization had burst into full bloom. There, in a ddition to the expansion of the headquarters of Enlil and Enki into sa- cred precincts surrounded by teeming cities (Nippur and Er- idu, respectively), Cities Of Man had been establis hed. The newly created institution of Kingship was inaugurat ed in a new city, Kish, under the aegis of Ninurta. Nannar/ Sin was given mastery over a new urban center called Ur. A sacred precinct built for a visit of Anu and Antu was expa nded to become the city of Uruk (the biblical Erech) and wa s given as a gift to Inanna/Ishtar. The functions of the Pr iesthood were formalized; a calendar—the famed Calendar of N ip- pur—was introduced, based on sophisticated astronom ical knowledge and official festivals. Started in 3760 B .C., it is still in use as the Hebrew calendar. The returning Marduk must have cried out to his fat her and the Council of the Gods: And what about me? He set his sights on a place not far from where the pre- Diluvial spaceport had been, and determined to make it into a Bab-lli—\"Gateway of the Gods\" (hence its lasting name Babylon). It was to be a symbolic and actual expres sion of his supremacy. What ensued is recalled in the Bible as the inciden t of the Tower of Babel; it took place in Shine'ar (the bibl ical name"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"Divine Generations 57 Figures 24a, 24b, and 24c for Sumer). There the followers of the god of Babyl on began to build \"a tower whose head can reach the heavens\" —a launch tower, we would say nowadays. \"Let us make u s a Shem.\" they said—not a \"name\" as is commonly transl ated, but the original meaning of the Sumerian source of the word MU—a rocketlike object.

U ntil then \"there was one language and one kind of words upon the whole Earth\" (Genesis 11:1). Until then there w as indeed one civilization, that of Sumer, with a single lang uage and form of writing (Fig. 24a).

Thus was Mankind aliened three Regions; the Fourth Region was retained by the gods: the Sinai peninsul a, where the spaceport was. Defied in Mesopotamia, Ra/Marduk returned to Egypt to reassert his supremacy there, as the Great God of t he new civilization. The time was 3100 B.C. There was, of course, the small problem of what to do with Thoth, who had been the reigning deity in Egypt and Nubia while Ra/Mard uk was gone. Unceremoniously, he was sent away ... In The Lost Realms we have suggested that, taking along a group of his African followers, he went all the way to the New W orld, to become Quetzalcoatl, the Winged Serpent god. The fi rst cal- endar instituted by him in Mesoamerica (the Long Co unt calendar) began in the year 3113 B.C.; it was, we b elieve, the precise date of the arrival in the New World of Tho tii/Quet- zalcoatl. Still seedling from his failure in Mesopotamia, the bitter Marduk turned to settling other scores. During his absence a divine '\"Romeo and Juliet\"—his brother Dumuzi and I n- anna/Ishtar, the granddaughter of Enlil—fell in lov e and were to be betrothed. The union was anathema to Ra/ Mar- duk; he was especially alarmed by Inanna's hopes to become Mistress of Egypt through the marriage. When Marduk 's em- issaries tried to seize Dumuzi, he accidentally die d as he tried to escape. His death was blamed on Marduk.

Sentenced to exile, Ra/Marduk became Amen-Ra, the u n- seen god. This time, however, he roamed the Earth. In an autobiographical text in which his return was proph esied, Marduk described his wanderings thus: I am the divine Marduk, a great god. I was cast off for my sins. To the mountains I have gone, in many lands I have been a wanderer. From where the sun rises to where it sets I went. And wherever he roamed, he kept asking the Gods of Fate: \"Until when?\" The answer regarding his Fate, he realized, came fr om the heavens. The Age of the Bull, the age zodiacally be longing to Enlil and his clan, was ending. The dawn was nea ring when the Sun would rise on the first day of spring, the day of the New Year in Mesopotamia, in the zodiacal con stel- lation of the Ram (Aries)—his constellation. The ce lestial cycle of Fates augurs his, Marduk's, supremacy! Not everyone agreed. Was it just so because of time cal- culations, or an observable celestial phenomenon? M arduk could not care less; he launched a march on Mesopot amia while his son, Nabu, organized followers to invade the Sinai and seize the spaceport. The escalating conflict is described in a text known as the Erra Epos; it tells how, see ing no other choice, the gods opposing Marduk used nuclear weap- ons to obliterate the spaceport (and, as a sideshow , the un- faithful cities of Sodom and Gomorrah). But Fate intervened on the side of Marduk. The prev ailing western winds carried the deathly nuclear cloud eas tward, toward Sumer. Babylon, farther north, was spared.

Destiny, NAM, was the predetermine d course of events that was unalterable.

Once the Solar System begot its shape and com- position after the Celestial Battle, the planetary orbits became everlasting Destinies; the term and concept could t hen be applied to the future course of events on Earth, st arting with the gods who had celestial counterparts. In the biblical realm, it was Yahweh who controlled bom Destinies and Fates, but while me former was predet ermined and unalterable, the latter (Fate) could be affecte d by human decisions. Because of the former powers, the course of future events could be foretold years, centuries, and even millennia earlier, as when Yahweh revealed to Abraham the fut ure of his descendants, including the sojourn of four hund red years in Egypt (Genesis 15:13-16). How that sojourn would come about (it began with a search for food during a gre at famine) was a matter of Fate; that the sojourn would begin with an unexpected welcome (because Joseph, through a serie s of consecutive occurrences, became Overseer over all o f Egypt) was a matter of Fate; but that the sojourn (after a period of enslavement) would end with a liberating Exodus at a pre- determined time was a Destiny, preordained by Yahwe h. Because they were called to prophecy by God, the bi blical prophets could foretell the future of kingdoms and countries, of cities and kngs and individuals. But they made i t clear that their prophecies were merely expressions of di vine de- cisions. 'Thus sayeth Yahweh, Lord of Hosts,\" was a fre- quent way in which the Prophet Jeremiah began as th e future of kingdoms and rulers was foretold. \"So sayeth the Lord Yahweh.\" the Prophet Amos announced. But when it came to Fates, the free will and free c hoice of people and nations could come and did come into play. Unlike Destinies, Fates could be changed and punish ments could be averted if righteousness replaced sin, if piety re- placed profanity, if justice prevailed over injusti ce. \"It is not the death of the evildoer that I seek, but that the wicked shall turn from his ways and live,\" the Lord God told the Prophet Ezekiel (33:11).

He was, as we have mentioned, the son of Uruk's high priest and the goddess Ninsun. As he grew olde r and began to contemplate issues of life and death, he p osed the question to his godfather, the god Utu/Shamash: In my city man dies; oppressed is my heart. Man perishes, heavy is my heart.. . Man, the tallest, cannot stretch to heaven; Man, the widest, cannot cover the Earth. Will I too 'peer over the wall'? Will I too be fated thus? The answer of Utu/Shamash was not encouraging. \"Whe n the gods created Mankind,\" he said, \"death to Manki nd they allotted; Life they retained in their own keeping.\" This is your Destiny; so, while you are alive and what you do in the meantime is a Fate that you can change or affect, e njoy it and make the most of it— Let full he thy belly, Gilgamesh; Make thou merry by day and night!

Gilgamesh comforts h im: Worry not, he says; the \"Adjurer\" Namtar indeed can de- vour—but he also \"lets the caught bird go back to i ts place, lets the caught man return to the bosom of his moth er.\" Falling into the hands of Namtar is not an unaltera ble oc- currence; as often as not, Fate reverses itself. Refusing to give up, Gilgamesh embarked on a second journey, this time to the spaceport in the Sinai pe ninsula. His troubles and tribulations on the way were coundess, yet he persevered. At last he managed to obtain the fruit that would have given him eternal youth; but in the end a serp ent snatched it from him as the weary Gilgamesh fell as leep, and he returned to Uruk empty-handed, there to die.

The emergence of Homo sapiens on Ea rth, we believe, was a matter of Destiny, a final outcom e that might have been delayed or reached otherwise, but u ndoubt- edly reached. Indeed, we believe mat even though me An- unnaki deemed their coming to Earth their own decis ion for their own needs, that too, we believe, was preordai ned, des- tined by a cosmic plan.

One who understood the connection between Fate and the twelve zodiacal constellations was Marduk himself. They constituted what we have termed Celestial Time, the link between Divine Time (the orbital period of Nibiru) and Earthly Time (the Year, months, seasons, days, and nights resulting from the Earth's orbit, tilt, and revolut ion about its own axis).

In our 1976 book The Twelfth Planet we have suggest ed that neither the Mesopotamian text nor its condense d biblical version was myth or allegory. They were based, we s ug- gested, on a most sophisticated cosmogony that, bas ed on advanced science, described the creation of our Sol ar System stage by stage; and then the appearance of a stray planet from outer space that was gradually drawn into our Solar System, resulting in a collision between it and an olden me mber of the Sun's family. The ensuing Celestial Battle betw een the invader—\"Marduk\"—and the olden planet—Tiamat—led to the destruction of Tiamat. Half of it broke up i nto bits and pieces that became a Hammered Bracelet; the other h alf, shunted to a new orbit, became the planet Earth, ca rrying with it Tiamat's largest satellite that we call the Moon. And the invader, attracted into the center of our Solar System and slowed down by the collision, became permanently th e twelfth member of our Solar System. In the subsequent companion book Genesis Revisited (1990), we showed that all the advances in our cele stial knowledge corroborated the Sumerian tale—a tale whi ch ex- plained satisfactorily the history of our Solar Sys tem, the enigma of Earth's continents starting only on one s ide with an immense gap (me Pacific basin) on the other side , the origin of the Asteroid Belt and the Moon, the reaso n for Uranus lying on its side and Pluto having an odd or bit, and on and on.

That i ncluded Mankind, for according to the Sumerian original ver sion it was Nibiru, coming from some other part of the univ erse, that brought with it and imparled to Earth during t he colli- sion the \"Seed of Life.\" (For that matter, it should be realized that the il lustration so long deemed to represent Marduk battling the Dra gon is also all wrong. It is a depiction from Assyria, whe re the supreme god was Ashur, and not Babylon; the deity i s de- picted as an Eagleman, which indicates an Enlilite being; the divine cap he wears has three pairs of horns, indic ating the rank of 30, which was not Marduk's rank; and his we apon is the forked lightning, which was the divine weapo n of Ish- kur/Adad, Enid's—not Enki's—son.) No sooner did Marduk seize the sovereignty in Babyl on, than the pivotal New Year rites were changed, to re quire the public reading (on the festival's fourth evening) o f Enuma elish in its new, Babylonian, version; in it the su premacy of Marduk on Earth only paralleled his supremacy in th e heav- ens, as the planet with the greatest orbital path, the one mat embraces all the others in its loop.

Once one realizes that this is the meaning and sign ificance of the ancient term for \"orbits,\" one can follow me steps by which the Destiny was attained by Marduk. The te rm is used, for the first time in the text, in connection with the principal satellite of Tiamat (which the text calls Kingu).

But what about the other way—can a Fate, no m atter by whom decreed, be superseded by Destiny? The issue had certainly been pondered in antiquity, for otherwise what was the reason for prayers and suppl ications that had begun then, of the admonitions by the Prop hets for righteousness and repentance? The biblical Book of Job raises the question whether Fate—to be afflicted to the point of hopelessness—shall prevail even if Job's righteo usness and piety had destined him to long life. It was a theme whose origins can be found in the Su merian poem that scholars titled Man and His God, whose su bject is the righteous sufferer, a victim of cruel fate a nd unde- served misfortune. \"Fate grasped me in its hand, ca rries away my breath of life,\" the unnamed sufferer lamen ted: but he sees the Gates of Mercy opening up for him \"now that you, my god, have shown me my sins.\" Confession and repentance make his god \"turn aside the Demon of Fa te.\" and the supplicant lives a long and happy life. Just as the tale of Gilgamesh demonstrated that Fat e could not override his ultimate Destiny (to die as a mort al), so did other tales convey the moral that neither can Fate bring about death if it was not yet so destined.

(The notion was abetted by the close affinity between Ma rduk with his father Enki on the one hand and with his son Na bu on the other hand, creating the impression of an early Trinity). The impact of Marduk's ordeals and its moral for hu man- ity was evidenced by a Mystery Play in which his ap parent death and return from the dead were played out by a ctors. The Mystery Play was acted out in Babylon as part o f the New Year ceremonies, and various ancient records su ggest that it served a darker purpose as well—to point an accusing finger at his enemies and judges who were responsib le for his death sentence and entombment. As variant rendi tions indicate, the identity of those responsible changed from time to time to suit the changing political-religious sc ene. One of the original accusees was Inanna/Ishtar: and it is ironic that while she truly had died and resurrecte d, her mi- raculous experience was neither reenacted (as was M arduk's) nor recalled in the calendar (as was the death of h er beloved Dumuzi after whom the month Tammuz was named). This is doubly ironic because it was as a result of the death of Dumuzi that Inanna/Ishtar ended up dead. Not even a Shakespeare could conceive the tragic ir ony of the events that followed the entombment and resurre ction of Marduk as a result of Inanna's outcry. For as thing s turned out, while he had not truly died or really come bac k from the dead, his accuser Inanna did meet actual death and at- tained true resurrection.

The suspenseful story of Inanna/Ishtar's death and resur- rection reveals, from the very beginning, that she met her death—real death, not just entombment—as a result o f her own decisions. She created her own Fate; but since her death (at least at that time) was not her Destiny—in the end she was revived and resurrected. The tale is recorded in texts written first in the original Sumerian language, with later renderings in Akkadia n. Scholars refer to the various renditions as the tal e of Inanna 's Descent to the Lower World, although some prefer th e term Netherworld instead of Lower World, implying a hell ish do- main of the dead. But in fact Inanna set her course to the Lower World, which was the geographic term denoting the southernmost part of Africa. It was the domain of h er sister Ereshkigal and Nergal, her spouse; and it appears t hat as a brother of Dumuzi it was his task to arrange the fu neral. And although Inanna was warned not to go there, she dec ided to make the trip anyway. Attending the funeral rites of her beloved Dumuzi w as the reason Inanna gave for her journey; but it is evide nt that no one believed her ... It has been our guess that acc ording to a custom (that later guided biblical laws), Inanna intended to demand that Nergal, as an older brother of Dumuzi, sleep with her so that a son be born as a pseudo-son of D umuzi (who had died sonless). And that intention infuriat ed Eresh- kigal.

The notion of the realm of Namtar as a Netherworld, an abode of the dead but at the same time a place from which one could escape and be back among the living, form ed the basis for an Assyrian text dealing with the near-de ath expe- rience of a prince named Kumma. As in an episode of the TV series The Twilight Zone , the prince sees himself arriving in the Netherworld. Ri ght off he sees a man standing before Namtar: \"In his left han d he held the hair of his head, in his right he held a sword. \" Namtaru, Namtar's concubine, stood nearby. Monstrous beasts sur- rounded them: a serpent-dragon with human hands and feet, a beast with the head of a lion and four human hand s. There was Mukil (\"Smiter\"), birdlike with human hands and feet, and Nedu (\"Who casts down\"), who had the head of a lion, the hands of a man, and the feet of a bird.

On her orders, the two di- vine messengers also took back with them the lifele ss body of Dumuzi. They took the body to Bad-Tibira in the Edin; there the body was embalmed at Inanna's request: As for Dumuzi, the lover of my youth: Wash him with pure water, anoint him with sweet oil, clothe him in a red garment, lay him on a slab of lapis-stone. Inanna ordered that the preserved body be put upon a stone slab of lapis lazuli to be kept in a special shrine . It should be preserved, she said, so that one day, on the Fin al Day, Dumuzi could return from the dead and \"come up to m e.\" For that, she asserted, would be the day when The dead one will arise and smell the sweet incense.

The biomedical powers of Thoth in matters of life a nd death were also recorded in a series of ancient Egy ptian texts known as Tales of the Magicians. In one of them (Ca iro Papyrus 30646) a long tale deals with a couple of r oyal de- scent who unlawfully took possession of the Book of the Secrets of Thoth. In punishment Thoth buried them i n a sub- terranean chamber in a state of suspended animation —mum- mified as the dead but able to see, hear, and speak . In another tale, written on the Westcar Papyrus, a son of the Pharaoh Khufu (Cheops) told his father of an old man who \"w as acquainted with the mysteries of Thoth.\" Among them was the ability to restore life to the dead. Wishing to see this with his own eyes, the king ordered that a prisoner's he ad be cut off, then challenged the sage to reconnect the seve red head and return the man to life. The sage refused to per form this \"magic of Thoth\" on a human being; so the head of a goose was severed. The sage \"spoke certain words of power \" from the Book of Thoth; and lo and behold, the severed h ead joined itself back to the body of the goose, the go ose stood up, waddled, then began to honk—alive as before. That Thoth had indeed possessed the ability to resu rrect a dead person who had been beheaded, reattach the hea d, and return the victim to life, was known in ancient Egy pt because of an incident that had occurred when Horus finally took up arms against his uncle Seth. After battles that rag ed on land, water, and in the air, Horus succeeded in capturing Seth and his lieutenants. Bringing them before Ra for judgme nt, Ra put the captives' fate in the hands of Horus and Is is. Thereupon Horus started to slay the captives by cut ting off their heads; but when it came to Seth, Isis could n ot see this done to her brother and stopped Horus from executin g Seth.

Nowhere in the relevant tex ts is there any indication of a connection between Dumuzi (and, for mat matter, Inanna) and that City of the Gods. The only possible connection is the fact that Bad-Tibira was estab- lished as the metallurgical center of the Anunnaki.

Another possibly relevant tidbit concerns the const ruction of the Tabernacle and Tent of Appointment in the de sert of the Exodus, in accordance with very detailed and ex plicit instructions by Yahweh to Moses: where gold or silv er were to be used and how. what kinds of woods or timbers and in what sizes, what manner of cloth or skins, how sewn , how decorated.

She missed, however, the god's ph allus, which she could not find, for Seth had disposed of it so that Osiris would have no heir. Determined to have one so that he would avenge his fa- ther, Isis appealed to Thoth, the Keeper of Divine Secrets, to help her. Extracting the \"essence\" of Osiris fro m the dead god's available parts, Thoth helped Isis impregnate herself and give birth to a son, Horus. The \"essence\" (not \"seed\"!), we now know, was what we nowadays call DNA—the genetic nucleic acids that form chains on the chromosomes, chains that are arranged in base pairs in a double helix (see Fig. 38b). At concepti on, when the male sperm enters the female egg, the entwined double helixes separate, and one strand from the male comb ines with one strand from the female to form a new double-hel ixed DNA for their offspring. It is thus essential not o nly to bring together the two double-helixed DNAs, but also to a ttain a separation—an unwinding—of the double strands, and then a recombining of only one strand from each source i nto the new entwined double-helixed DNA. Pictorial depictions from ancient Egypt indicate th at Thoth—the son of Ptah/Enki—was well aware of these biological-genetic processes and employed them in h is genetic feats.

The importance of the wife-sister in the succession rules of the gods of Mesopotamia and Egypt, evident from all that we have reported thus far, was echoed also in the G reek myths regarding their gods. The Greeks named the fi rst di- vine couple, emerging out of Chaos, Gaea (\"Earth\") and Uranus (\"Sky\" or \"Heaven\"). Of them twelve Titans w ere brought forth, six males and six females. Their int ermarriages and varied offspring laid the groundwork for later struggles for supremacy. Of the earliest struggles the one wh o emerged on top was Cronus, the youngest male Titan, whose s pouse was his sister Rhea; their children were the three sons Hades, Poseidon and Zeus, and me three daughters Hestia, D emeter and Hera. Though Zeus fought his way up to the supr emacy, he had to share dominion with his brothers. The thr ee divided the domains among them—some versions say by drawing lots—very much as Anu, Enlil, and Enki had: Zeus wa s the heavenly god (yet residing on Earth, on Mount Olymp us); Hades was accorded me Lower World; and Poseidon the seas."},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"110 THE COSMIC CODE The three brothers and three sisters, offspring of Cronus and Rhea, constituted the first half of the Olympia n Circle of twelve.

When it was time, however, to obtain a male heir in accordance with me succession rules of the gods, Zeus turned to his own sisters. Hestia, the oldest, was by all ac- counts a recluse, too old or too sick to be the obj ect of mat- rimony and childbearing. Zeus thus sought a son by his middle sister, Demeter; but instead of a son she bo re him a daughter, Persephone. This paved the way for Zeus t o marry Hera, the youngest sister; and she did bear to Zeus a son, Ares, and two daughters (Ilithyia and Hebe). When t he Greeks and Romans, who lost the knowledge of the pl anets beyond Saturn, named the known planets, they assign ed one—Mars—to Ares; though not me Firstborn Son, he w as Zeus's Foremost Son. Apollo, as great a god as he w as, had no planet named after him by the Greeks and Romans. All this reinforces the importance of the wife-sist er in the annals of the gods. In matters of succession, the i ssue arose again and again: Who will me successor to the thron e be— the Firstborn Son or the Foremost Son, if the latte r was born by a half sister and the former not?

Why? Because Sarah was Abraham's h alf sister. \"She is my sister, the daughter of my fathe r but not of my mother.\" Abraham explained (Genesis 20:12). The marrying of a half sister as a wife was prevale nt among the Pharaohs of Egypt, as a means both to leg itimize the king's reign and me succession. The custom was even found among the Inca kings of Peru, so much so that the occurrence of calamities during a certain king's re ign was attributed to his marrying a woman who was not his halt sister. The Inca custom had its roots in the Legend s of Be- ginnings of the Andean peoples, whereby the god Vir acocha created four brothers and four sisters who intermar ried and were guided to various lands. One such brother-sist er couple, which was given a golden wand with which to find th e Navel of the Earth in South America, began kingship in Cu zco (the erstwhile Inca capital).

As we search for the answer, it will help to note o ther biblical practices affecting the mother/father issu es. It is cus- tomary to refer to the period of Abraham, Isaac, Ja cob, and Joseph as the Patriarchal Age, and when asked most people would say that the history related in the Old Testa ment has been presented from a male-oriented viewpoint. Yet the fact is that it was the mothers, not the fathers, who co ntrolled the act that, in the ancients' view, gave the subject o f the tale its status of \"being\"—the naming of the child. Inde ed, not only a person but a place, a city, a land, were not deemed to have come into being until they were given a nam e. This notion, in fact, goes back to the beginning of time, for the very opening lines of the Epic of Creation, wishing to impress on the listener that the story begins be fore the Solar System had been fully fashioned, declare that the story of Tiamat and the other planets begins Enuma elish la nabu shamamu When in the heights heaven had not been named Shapiltu ammatum shuma la zakrat And below, firm ground (Earth) had not been called And in the important matter of naming a son, it was either the gods themselves or the mother whose privilege i t was.

But when Man was given the ability to procreate on his own, it was Eve—not Adam—who had the right and privilege of naming their first male child Cain (Genesis 4:1) as well as Seth who replaced the slain Abel (Genesis 4:25).

No specific information is provided in the Bible re- garding the two sons of Isaac by Rebecca, Esau and Jacob (it is simply stated that this is how they were cal led). But then it is clearly stated that it was Leah who name d Jacob's sons by her and by her handmaiden, as did Rachel (G enesis chapters 29 and 30). Centuries later, after the Isr aelites had settled in Canaan, it was Samson's mother who so na med him (Judges 13:24); so did the mother of the Man of God, Samuel (1 Samuel 1:20). The Sumerian texts do not provide this kind of info rma- tion. We do not know, for example, who named Gilgam esh— his mother the goddess or his father the High Pries t. Bui the tale of Gilgamesh provides an important clue to the solution of the puzzle at hand: the importance of the mother in de- termining the son's hierarchical standing. His search for attaining the longevity of the gods, it will be recalled, led him first to the Landing Place in the Cedar Mountains; but he and his companion Enkidu were pre vented from entering by its robotic guardian and the Bull of Heaven. Gilgamesh then journeyed to the spaceport in the Si nai pen- insula. The access to it was guarded by awesome Roc ketmen who trained on him \"the dreaded spotlight that swee ps the mountains\" whose \"glance was death\" (Fig. 42); but Gil- gamesh was not affected; whereupon one Rocketman sh outed to his comrade: He who comes, of the flesh of the gods is his body!"},{"pageNumber":116,"pageContent":" Figure 42 Permitted to approach. Gilgamesh confirmed the guar d's conclusion: Indeed he was immune to the death rays because his body was of the \"flesh of the gods.\" He was, he ex- plained, not just a demigod—he was \"two-thirds divi ne.\" because it was not his father but his mother who wa s a god- dess, one of the female Anunnaki. Here, we believe, is the key to the puzzle of the s uc- cession rules and other emphasis on the mother. It is through her that an extra \"qualifying dose\" was giv en to the hero or the heir (be it Anunnaki or patriarc hal). This seemed to make no sense even after the discove ry, in 1953, of the double-helix structure of DNA and t he un- derstanding how the two strands unwind and separate so that only one strand from the female egg and one strand from the male sperm recombine, making the offspring a fifty- fifty im- age of its parents. Indeed, this understanding, whi le explain- ing the demigod claims, defied the inexplicable cla im of Gilgamesh to be two-thirds divine. It was not until the 1980s that the ancient claims began to make sense. This came with the discovery that in ad dition to the DNA stored in the cells of both males and femal es in the double-helix structures on the chromosome stems, fo rming the cell's nucelus, there was another kind of DNA t hat floats 114 THE COSMIC CODE"},{"pageNumber":117,"pageContent":"The Cosmic Connection: DNA 115 in the cell outside the nucelus.

In other words, if the mother of Gilgamesh was a go ddess, then he had indeed inherited both her half of the r egular DNA plus her mtDNA, making him, as he had claimed, two- thirds divine. It was this discovery of the existence and transmit tal as is of mtDNA that has enabled scientists, from 1986 on, to trace the mtDNA in modern humans to an \"Eve\" who had live d in Africa some 250,000 years ago. At first scientists believed that the sole function of mtDNA was to act as the cell's power plant, providing the energy required for the cell's myriad chemical and biologi cal reac- tions. But then it was ascertained that the mtDNA w as made of \"mitochondrions\" containing 37 genes arranged in a closed circle, like a bracelet; and that such a gen etic \"brace- let\" contains over 16,000 base pairs of the genetic alphabet (by comparison, each of the chromosomes making up t he cell's core that are inherited half from each paren t contains upward of 100,000 genes and an aggregate of more th an three billion base pairs). It took another decade to realize that impairments in the makeup or functions of mtDNA can cause debilitating dis- orders in the human body, especially of the nervous system, of heart and skeletal muscles, and of the kidneys. In the 1990s researchers found that defects (\"mutations\") in mtDNA also disrupt the production of 13 important b ody proteins, resulting in various severe ailments.

Thus, when one outcome was a man with faulty eye- sight, Enki taught him an art that did not require seeing— the art of singing and the playing of a lyre. To all those, the text states, Enki decreed this or that Fate. He then challenged Ninmah to try the genetic engine ering on her own.

One is to ascertain me human genome, the total genetic makeup of the human being; this i nvolves the reading of a code that although written with ju st four letters (A-G-C-T, short for the initials of the nam es given to the four nucleic acids that make up all DNA) is mad e up of coundess combinations of those letters mat men form \"words\" that combine into \"sentences\" and \"paragrap hs\" and finally a complete \"book of life.\" The other re search route is to determine the function of each gene; th at is an even more daunting task, facilitated by the fact th at if that very same gene (\"genetic word\") can be found in a s impler creature (such as a lowly bacterium, or a laborator y mouse) and its function could be experimentally determined , it is virtually certain that the same gene in humans woul d have the same functions (or its absence the same malfunc tions). The discovery of genes related to obesity, for exam ple, has been achieved that way.

In view of such complexities, one wishes that moder n scientists would avail themselves of a road map pro vided by—yes!—the Sumerians. The remarkable advances in a s- tronomy keep corroborating the Sumerian cosmogony a nd the scientific data provided in the Epic of Creatio n: the ex- istence of other solar systems, highly elliptic orb ital paths, retrograde orbits, catastrophism, water on the oute r planets— as well as explanations for why Uranus lies on its side, the origin of the Asteroid Belt and of the Moon, the Ea rth's cavity on one side and the continents on the other side. All is explained by the scientifically sophisticated ta le of Nibiru and the Celestial Battle. Why not then take seriously, as a scientific road m ap, the other part of the Sumerian creation tales—that of the creation of The Adam? The Sumerian texts inform us, first of all, that th e \"seed of life\"—the genetic alphabet—was imparted to Earth by Nibiru during the Celestial Battle, some four billi on years ago. If the evolutionary processes on Nibiru began a mere one percent before they were launched on Earth, evo lution there had begun forty million years before it start ed on Earth. It is thus quite plausible that the advanced superh umans, An- unnaki, were capable of space travel half a million years ago. It is also plausible that when they came here, they found on Earth the parallel intelligent beings still at the hominid stage. But coming from the same \"seed,\" transgenic manipul a- tion was possible, as Enki had discovered and then sug- gested. \"The being we need already exists!\" he expl ained. \"All we need to do is put our [genetic] mark on it. \" One must presume that by then the Anunnaki were awa re of the complete genome of the Nibiruans, and capabl e of determining no less of the hominids' genome as we a re by now of ours.

What defects, on the other hand, remained hidden in the depths of the recombined genome of The Adam? We strongly believe that were qualified scientists to study in detail the data recorded in the Sumerian t exts, valuable biogenetic and medical information could b e ob- tained. An amazing case in point is the deficiency known as Williams Syndrome. Afflicting roughly one in 20,000 births, its victims have a very low IQ verging on retardati on; but at the same time they excel in some artistic field. Re cent re- search has discovered that the syndrome resulting i n such \"idiot savants\" (as they are sometimes described) i s caused by a minute gap in Chromosome 7, depriving the pers on of some fifteen genes. One of the frequent impairments is the i n a b i l it y of the brain to recognize what the eyes s ee—im- paired eyesight; one of the most common talents is musical. But that is exactly the instance recorded in the Su merian text of the man with impaired eyesight whom Enki ta ught to sing and play music! Because The Adam could not, at first, procreate (re quiring the Anunnaki to engage in cloning), we must conclud e that at that stage the hybrid being possessed only the b asic twenty-two chromosomes. The types of ailments, defi ciencies (and cures) that modem biomedicine should expect to find on those chromosomes are the types and range listed in the Enki and Ninmah texts. The next genetic manipulation (echoed in the Bible in the tale of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden) was the grant- ing of the ability to procreate—the addition of the X (female) and Y (male) chromosomes to the basic 22 (Fig. 44). Con- trary to long-held beliefs that these two chromosom es have no other function besides determining the offspring 's sex, recent research has revealed that the chromosomes p lay wider and more diverse roles.

Where did Enki—the Nachash—obtain the X and Y chro- mosomes? And what about the source of the mtDNA? Hi nts scattered in the Sumerian texts suggest that Ninki, Enki's spouse, played some crucial role in the final stage of human creation.

Sumerian texts assert that while the gods kept \"Ete rnal Life\" to themselves, they did give Mankind \"Wisdom, \" an extra dose of intelligence genes. That additional g enetic con- tribution, we believe, is the subject of a text tha t scholars call The Legend of Adapa. Clearly identified in the text as a \"Son of Eridu,\" Ea/ Enki's \"cult center\" in the Edin, he was also calle d in the text \"the son of Ea\"—an offspring, as far as other pieces of data suggest, of Ea/Enki himself by a woman othe r than his spouse. By dint of this lineage, as well as by deliberate action, Adapa was recalled for generations as the W isest of Men, and was nicknamed the Sage of Eridu: In those days, in those years, Ea created the Sage of Eridu as a model of men. Wide understanding he perfected for him, disclosing the designs of the Earth. To him he had given Widsom; Eternal Life he had not given him. This clash between Fate and Destiny takes us to the mo- ment when Homo sapiens-sapiens appeared; Adapa, too , be- ing the son of a god, asked for immortality. That, as we know from the Epic of Gilgamesh, could be obtained by as cending heavenward to the abode of the Anunnaki; and that w as what Ea/Enki told Adapa.

If you accept them and partake of them, Enki warned Adapa, surely you shall die! And, so misled by his own fat her. Adapa refused the food and the waters of the gods a nd ended up subject to his mortal's Destiny. But Adapa did accept a garment that was brought to him and wrapped himself in it, and did take the oil tha t was of- fered to him, and anointed himself with it. Therefo re, Anu declared, Adapa would be initialed into the secret knowledge of the gods. He showed him the celestial expanse, \" from the horizon of heaven to heaven's zenith.\" He would be allowed to return to Eridu safe and sound, and there would be initi- ated by the goddess Ninkarrak into the secrets of \" the ills that were allotted to Mankind, the diseases that we re wrought upon the bodies of mortals,\" and taught by her how to heal such ailments. It would be relevant here to recall the biblical as surances by Yahweh to the Israelites in the wilderness in Si nai. Wan- dering three days without any water, they reached a watering hole whose water was unpotable. So God pointed out to Moses a certain tree and told him to throw it into the water, and the water became potable. And Yahweh said to th e Is- raelites: If you shall give ear to my commandments, 1 shall not impose on thee the illnesses of Egypt; \"I Yahwe h shall be thine healer\" (Exodus 15:26). The promise by Yah weh to act as the healer of his chosen people is repeat ed in Exodus 23:25, where a specific reference is made to enabli ng a woman who is barren to bear children.

It was a \"secret of the gods,\" to be hidden from Mankind or revealed, from time to time and only partly, to selected individuals—initiates into the divine secrets. \"Everything that we know was taught to us by the go ds,\" the Sumerians stated in their writings; and therein lies the foundation, throughout the millennia and unto our o wn times. of Science and Religion, of the discovered and the occult. First there was the Secret Knowledge; what was reve aled when Mankind was granted Understanding became Sacre d Wisdom, the foundation of human civilizations and a dvance- ment.

And one must begin to wonder whether the u nend- ing search for That Which Is Hidden, sometimes in t he guise of mysticism, stems not from the wish to attain the divine but from a fear of what Fate the gods—in their secr et con- claves or in hidden codes—have destined for Mankind . Some of the knowledge that was, or could be. impart ed to Mankind when Wisdom and Understanding were granted can be gleaned from God's challenge to Job regarding wh at he does not know (but God does). \"Say if thou knowest sci- ence,\" the biblical Lord stated to the suffering Jo b: Who has measured the Earth, that it be known? 125"},{"pageNumber":128,"pageContent":"126 THE COSMIC CODE Who has stretched a cord upon it?

The ways thereof to Elohim are known, God knows the place thereof; For he sees to the ends of the Earth and all that is under the Heavens he views. With such words did the biblical Lord challenge Job (in chapter 28) to stop questioning the reasons for his Fate, or its ultimate purpose; for Man's knowledge—Wisdom an d Understanding—fall so far short of God's, that it s erves no purpose to question or try to fathom divine will. That ancient treatment of Wisdom and Understanding of the secrets of the heavens and the Earth—of science —as a divine domain to which only a few selected mortals can be given access, found expression not only in canonica l writings but also in such Jewish mysticism as the Kaballah, according to which the Divine Presence symbolized by God's Cr own rests on the penultimate supports designated Wisdom (Hokh- mah) and Understanding (Binah) (Fig. 45). They are the same two components of scientific knowledge regardi ng which Job had been challenged. The references to Hokhmah (\"Wisdom\") in the Old Tes - tament reveal mat it was considered to have been a gift from God, because it was the Lord of the Universe who po ssessed the Wisdom required for creating the heavens and th e Earth. \"How great are thy deeds, Oh Lord; with Wisdom hast thou wrought them all,\" Psalm 104 states as it describes and ex- tols, phase by phase, the Creator's handiwork.

Of that extraor- dinary experience the Bible only says that, at age 365, Enoch was taken aloft to be with God. Fortunately, the ex trabiblical Book of Enoch, handed down through the millennia an d sur- viving in two versions, provide much greater detail ; how much is originally ancient, and how much was fancy and speculation when the \"books\" were compiled close to the beginning of the Christian era, one cannot say.

From these sources it emerges that Enoch made not o ne but two celestial journeys. On the first one he was taught the Secrets of Heaven, and was instructed to impart the knowl- edge on his return to Earth to his sons. Ascending toward the Divine Abode, he was lofted through a series of heavenly spheres.

He was still talkin g and in- structing when a sudden darkness fell and the two a ngels who had brought Enoch back lifted him and returned him to the heavens; it was precisely the day and hour of h is 365th birthday. The Bible (Genesis 5:23-24) simply states : \"And all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty and five years; and Enoch walked with God, and he was no mor e, for he was taken by Elohim.\" A prominent similarity between all three tales (Ada pa, En- meduranki, and Enoch) is the involvement of two div ine be- ings in the celestial experience. Adapa was met at the Gate of Anu, and accompanied in and out, by the two youn g gods Dumuzi and Gizidda; Enmeduranki's sponsors/teachers were Shamash and Adad; and Enoch's, two archangels. The tales undoubtedly were the inspiration for an Assyrian de piction of Anu's heavenly gate, in which it is guarded by t wo Ea- glemen. The gate bears the symbol of Nibiru, the Wi nged Disc, and the heavenly location is indicated by the celestial symbols of the Earth (as the seventh planet), the M oon, and the complete Solar System (Fig. 47). Another aspect that stands out—though not e x p l i c i t l y so in the case of Enoch—is the tradition that the gran ting of the Wisdom and Understanding made the chosen individual not just a scientist but also a priest, and moreover th e progenitor of a priestly line. We find this principle employed in the Sinai wilderness during the Exodus, when Yahweh, th e bib- lical Lord, chose Aaron (the brother of Moses) and his sons to be the Lord's priests (Exodus 28:1).

The problem is that at the time of the Exodus, circ a 1450 B.C., nowhere in the ancient world did an alphabeti c script yet exist. The concept of an alphabet is the work of genius; a nd whoever the genius was, he based it on existing fou ndations. Egyptian hieroglyphic writing advanced from picture -signs depicting objects to signs standing for syllables o r even con- sonants; but it has remained a complex writing syst em of countless picture-signs (see Fig. 24b).

Little noticed in the biblical tales of Exodus is t he fact that Moses was instructed by Yahweh to write things down even before the ascent upon Mount Sinai to receive the t ablets. The first time was after the war with the Amalekite s, a tribe that instead of acting as an ally betrayed the Isra elites and attacked them. The betrayal, God said, should be re mem- bered by all future generations: \"And Yahweh said u nto Moses: Write this down in a book for a remembrance\" (Exodus 17:14).

After all, he was in the Sinai peninsula at the very same time, he was highly educated in the Egyptian court (where co rrespon- dence with both the Mesopotamians and Hittites had been going on), and he undoubtedly learned the Semitic l anguage from the Midianites (if not knowing it already from his Is- raelite brethren in Egypt). Did he, in his wanderin gs in the Sinai wilderness, see the Semitic slaves (Israelite s who had by then been enslaved in Egypt), crudely etch on th e mines' walls his idea of a new way of writing?

It is the number of human chromosomes when The Adam was created, before the second genetic manipulation had added the sex chromosomes \"Y\" and \"X\"! Did the Almighty who had revealed to Moses the secr et of the alphabet, then, use the genetic code as the secret code of the alphabet? The answer seems to be Yes. If this conclusion seems outlandish, let us read th e Lord's statement in Isaiah 45:11: \"It is I who created the Letters ... It is I who made the Earth and created the Adam upon it,\" thus sayeth Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel.

If so, then the three letter root words corroborate th is con- clusion. \"Death and life are in me language,\" the Bible stat es in Proverbs (18:21). The statement has been treated al legori- cally.

While this is presented in scientific papers and ev en books as the epitome of modern sophistication, the fact i s that this search is actually a renewed, not a new, search, al beit with new and more advanced tools. The Hebrew Bible consists of three parts, the Torah (\"Teachings\"), which comprises the Pentateuch (the Five Books of Moses) and, historically and chronological ly, covers the time from Creation through the wanderings of th e Exodus and the death of Moses; Neviyim (\"Prophets\"), encom pass- ing the books of Joshua and the Judges, Samuel and the Kings, and then the major and minor Prophets, the P salms and Proverbs and Job—historically from the Israelit e settle- ment in Canaan through the destruction of the First Temple of Jerusalem; and Ketuvim (\"Writings\"), starting wi th the Song of Songs through the books attributed to the t wo lead- ers who led the exiles back to Judea to rebuild the Temple (Ezra and Nehemiah) and (in the arrangement of the Hebrew Bible's canon) ending with 1 and 2 Chronicles.

The record of those deliber ations is the Talmud (\"The Study\"). Jewish mysticism, know n as the Kaballah, took over and built upon those earlie r searches for hidden meanings. That such hidden meanings did exist, the Bible itse lf at- tests. The key was the alphabet, the twenty-two let ters. A simple encoding device, which even schoolchildren often play, is the serial substitution of letters. Kabbal ist sages in the Middle Ages used as a search tool a system known as ATBSh, in which the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Ta v (\"T\") is substituted for the first letter Aleph (\"A\"); the l ast but one, Shin (\"Sh\") for the second Beth (\"B\"), and so on. T he Kab- balist Abraham ben Jechiel Hacohen illustrated the system and provided the key to it in a book published in A . D . 1788. But in fact such a coding system was used by the Pr ophet Jeremiah (7th century B.C.) who. prophesying the fa ll of mighty Babylon, substituted the spelling B-B-L (Bab el) with the letters Sh-Sh-Kh to avoid imprisonment (Jeremia h 25:26 and 51:42). The Book of Lamentations, attributed to the Prophet Jeremiah, in which the fall and destruction of Jeru- salem are bewailed, employed another hidden code, c alled Acrostics, in which the first (or sometimes last) l etter of a verse make up a word or a name, or (as in the case of Jer- emiah) reveal the identity of the sacred alphabetic al letters. The first word in the first verse (translated \"alas \") begins with an Aleph, the second verse begins with a Beth and so on through the twenty-second verse. The same acrost ics is repeated by the Prophet in the second chapter: then each letter starts two verses in the third chapter, reve rting to one per verse in the fourth. Psalm 119 is constructed w ith eight- fold acrostics! The authenticity of certain verses in Psalms could be ver- ified by noticing that each verse has two parts, ea ch of which starts alphabetically (e.g.. Psalm 145); the same c lue is hid- den in the verse arrangement of Proverbs 31.

A prominent example com es from the time of the revolt against Greek rule in t he second century B.C. The revolt bears the name of its leade rs, the Maccabees—a name which was in fact an acronym based on the verse in the Song of Moses (Exodus 15:11)—\"Who is like thee among the gods, oh Yahweh\"—the first lett ers of the four Hebrew words forming the acronym M-K-B-I, pro- nounced \"Maccabee.\" After the destruction of the Second Temple by the R omans in A.D. 70, the spiritual and religious mainstay fo r the Jews were the Holy Scriptures—the treasure of divine and pro- phetic words. Was it all fated, was it all predicte d? And what is still destined, what is yet to come? The keys to the past and to the future had to be hidden in the sacred wr itings, by then canonized not only as to content but also as t o every word and every letter. That search for hidden meani ngs ob- scured by secret codes became known after the Templ e's destruction as \"entering the forbidden grove,\" the word for \"grove\"—PaRDeS—in itself being an acronym created from the first letters of four methods of extractin g the scrip- tures' message: Peshat (literal meaning), Remez ( hi nt) , Drash (interpretation) and Sod (secret).

The search for hidden meanings was resumed in Medie val limes by the Kabbalists and their forerunners. What would an examination of the Bible by the ATBSh code revea l?

In another instan ce it was asserted that the great Jewish savant Maimonides (S pain and Egypt, twelfth century A . D .) was named in the Book of Ex- odus, where the first letters of the last four word s in verse 11:9 create the acronym R-M-B-M—matching the acrony m resulting from the full name of Maimonides, Rabbi M oshe Ben Maimon (explaining the prevalent reference to h im as Rambam). But, Medieval savants wondered, had the search to b e lim- ited to only first or last letters of words, the be ginning or end of verses? What happens if one searches for hidden meanings by skipping letters? Every second, every fourth, ev ery forty- second? It was perhaps inevitable that with the adv ent of computers, someone would apply this tool to an expe dited search for a \"code\" based on letter spacing. The la test spate of interest in the subject indeed resulted from suc h an ap- plication of computer techniques by a number of Isr aeli sci- entists; it was launched by the publication in Augu st 1994 of a paper titled \"Equidistant Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis\" in the prestigious journal Statistical Silence by Doron Witzum, Eliyahu Rips and Yoav Rosenberg. Subsequent reviews, analyses, and books (The Bible Code by Michael Drosnin and The Truth Behind the Bible C ode by Jeffrey Satinover) deal, in essence, with one ba sic prem- ise: If you list all of the 304,805 letters in the Pentateuch in sequence, and arrange them in \"blocs\" that segment those letters into sections consisting of a certain numbe r of lines, and each line a certain number of letters, then cho ose a skip- ping method—certain letters will form words that, u nbeliev- able as it sounds, spell out predictions for our ti me and for all time, such as the assassination of Prime Minist er Rabin of Israel or the discovery of the Theory of Relativ ity by Albert Einstein.

Such arbitrariness in selecting the length and numb er of lines, the direction of reading, the skipping or no nskipping of letters and so on must rob the uninitiated of th e uncritical acceptance of the code claims that are based exclus ively on letters in the Bible: and to do that without belabo ring the issue of whether the current text of the Pentateuch is pre- cisely the original, divinely endowed, letter-by-le tter arrange- ment.

Apart from the theological implications, the immediate is sue is a distortion of the letter count. Nevertheless, the encryption of hidden words or mea nings into the biblical text must be accepted as a seriou s possibility, not only because of the examples cited above, but f or two other very important reasons. The first of them is that instances of encoding and en- cryption have been found in non-Hebrew texts from M eso- potamia, both from Babylonia and from Assyria. They include texts that begin or end with the warning th at they are secret, to be shown only to the initiated (or, conv ersely, not to be revealed to the uninitiated), under penalty o f death in the hands of the gods. Such texts sometimes employe d de- cipherable encoding methods (such as acronyms), and some- times encrypting methods that remain an enigma. Amo ng the former is a hymn by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in praise of the god Marduk and Marduk's spouse Zarpan it. It uses the cuneiform syllabic signs at the beginning of lines to spell out a hidden message to the god Marduk.

[n this double-encoding, the Assyrian king spelled out the following secret message to the god (we provide the trans- lation horizontally, though the message in the tabl et is read vertically, from top to bottom): A-na-ku Ah-shur-ba-an-ni-ap-li I am Ashurbanipal Sha il-shu bu-ul-ti-ta ni-shu-ma Ma-ru-du-uk Who to his god called give me life Marduk [and] Da-li-le-ka lu-ud-lu I will praise thee The discovery of an acrostic inscription by one Sha ggil- kinam-ubbib. a priest in the temple of Marduk in Ba bylon, indicates not only the priesthood's accessibility t o such en- coding, but also raises questions regarding its ant iquity. In that acronym (in which there is an eleven-line skip between the coded syllables) the encoder's name is clearly stated.

Dealing with the restoration of Marduk's temple in Babylon, which the Assyrian k ing undertook as a way to be accepted also as a ruler o f Baby- lonia, he recalled that Marduk. having become angry at the Babylonians, had decreed that the city and its temp le shall remain in ruins for seventy years.

What can be figured out regarding this hidden oracl e is that the god's act represented a sleight of hand wi th figures— with the symbols (also in cuneiform) that stood for numbers. In the Sumerian sexagesimal (meaning \"base sixty\") system, the sign for \"one\" could mean both 1 and 60, depend ing on position. The sign for 10 was a chevronlike symbol. What Esarhaddon asserted was that the god took the Book of Fates. on which the decreed period of desolation was \"70\" years (Fig. 58a) and turned it upside down, so that the c uneiform signs represented \"11\" (Fig. 58b). The association of hidden messages and secret meani ngs not with words alone but with numerals and numbers was even more prominent in the writings of Sargon II, t he grand- father of Ashurbanipal.

But we have reason to believe that such Mes o- potamian encoding methods were known to the Hebrew Prophets. One of the most difficult passages in the Bible is the prophecy of Isaiah about the time of Retribution, w hen \"it shall come to pass mat a great trumpet shall be blo wn, and they shall return those who were lost in the land o f Assyria and those who were cast out to the land of Egypt, a nd they shall bow down to Yahweh on the Holy Mount in Jerus a- lem.\" At that time, Isaiah prophesied, confusion sh all reign and people will ask each other, \"Who shall be given the understanding\" of the message which has somehow bee n altered to hide its meaning: For precept is upon precept, precept is within precept; Line is upon line. line is with line— A litile here, somewhat there; For with a confused language and in a strange tongue will He address this people.

(The New English Bible). What language could be confused, or its written sig ns given a strange meaning, by changing the \"order\" an d a \"line\" here and there? It is our suggestion that what the Prophet Isaiah—a contemporary of Sargon II and Sennacherib—was talking about is the cuneiform scri pt of the Assyrians and the Babylonians! It was of course not an unknown language; but as th e verse quoted above states, the message delivered in that language could not be understood because it had been encoded by Kav to Kav, by changing a \"line\" here and a \"line\" ther e, thereby changing the \"precept\" of what the message was saying. The changed Tzav (\"order\") hints at encrypt ion methods (like the A/T-B/Sh) using the changed order of the loiters. This suggested solution to the enigma of verses 28: 10-11 can serve to explain the subsequent description by the Prophet (29:10-12) of the inability of anyone to un derstand the envisioned writings because \"the words of the b ook have become unto you as a book that has been sealed.\" Th e last word, hatoom, is usually translated \"sealed.\" but i n the bib- lical usage it had the connotation of \"hidden.\" mad e a se- cret.

We have already mentioned the reference by Isaiah t o Yahweh as the creator of the Letters (of the alphab et). In verse 45:11 the Prophet, extolling the uniqueness o f Yahweh, states that it was Yahweh who \"hath arrayed by lett ers that which shall come to pass.\" And that such an arrayme nt was encoded ought to be the way to understand the enigm atic verse 41:23. Describing how the bewildered people o f the Earth seek to divine the future from the past, Isai ah quotes them as begging God: Tell us the letters backward! Were the word the usual Ototh. it would have meant, \"tell us the signs back from the beginning of things.\" Bu t the Prophet has chosen—three times—to write Otioth, \"le tters.\" And the clear request is to be enabled to understan d the di- vine plan by being shown the letters backward, as i n a code, in which the letters have been scrambled.

When the Greeks adopted the alphabet, they retained the prac tice of assigning numerical values to letters; and it is fr om Greek that the art of and rules for the interpretation of letters, words or groups of words by their numerical values was gi ven the name Gematria.

Thus, it was held that when a man took an oath to be a Nazirite, the unspecified period of abstent ion should be 30 days, because the defining word YiHYeH (\"shal l be\") in Numbers chapter 6 has the numerical value 30. Co mparing words and their implications by their numerical equ ivalents opened up countless possibilities for hidden meanin gs. As an example, it was suggested that Moses and Jacob had a similar divine experience, because the ladder to heaven (Su lam in Hebrew) that Jacob saw in the nighttime vision and the mount (Sinai) on which Moses received the Tablets o f the Law had both the same numerical value, 130. The employment of numerology and especially Gematri a to detect secret meanings reached a new height with the growth of Jewish mysticism known as the Kabbalah du ring the Middle Ages. In those searches special attentio n was given to divine names. Paramount was the study of t he name by which the Lord God named himself to Moses, YHWH: \"I am whoever I will be, Yahweh is my name\" (Exodus 3: 14-15). If added simply, the four letters of the di vine name (the Tetragammaton) amount to 26 (10+5+6+5); but un der more complex methods advocated by the Kabbalists, i n which the spelled-out names of the four letters (Yo d, Hei, Wav, Hei) were added up numerically, the total come s to 72. The numerical equivalents of these numbers made up scores of insightful other words. (At the beginning of Christianity an Alexandrian se ct held that the name of the supreme and primordial creator was Abraxas, the sum of whose letters equaled 365—the n umber of days in a solar year. The sect's members used to wear cameos made of semiprecious stones, bearing the god 's im- age and name—as often as not equated with YaHU (sho rt for Yahweh)—Fig. 60. There is every reason to belie ve that Abraxas stemmed from Abresheet, \"Father/Progenitor of Be- ginning,\" that we have proposed as the full first w ord, start- ing with an \"A,\" of Genesis, rather than the curren t Bresheet which makes Genesis start with a \"B.\" If Genesis in deed had one more letter, the code sequencing now in vog ue would have to be reexamined)."},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":" Figure 60 How much value should one attach to numerical codes or meanings—a code inherent in the letters themselv es and not on arbitrary spacing between them?

In other words, from the very moment that the three-letter r oot words of the Hebrew emerged, to write with letters and to count with numbers were considered one and the s ame. Indeed, there are instances in the Hebrew Bible whe re the meanings \"book\" and \"number\" were interchangeable, as in 1 Chronicles 27:24 where, reporting a census con ducted by King David, the word \"number\" was used twice in the same sentence, once to denote the number (of the pe ople counted) and then to mean David's book of records.

The scanning of earlier texts for coded numbers evolved into the us e of num- bers as secret codes.

Still another sugges- tion was that the code was in Hebrew, standing for Neron Qesar (\"Nero the Emperor\"), whose Hebrew spelling N -R- W-N + Q-S-R also added up to 666; and so on, in a v ariety of Gematria approaches both using straight addition as well as triangulauon methods. The possibility that the encoded secret of \"666\" is to be uncovered in Hebrew rather than Greek or Roman word meanings might well be the key to finally resolving the enigma.

An approach that accepts the possibility that the O ld Tes- tament as well as the New Testament borrowed for th eir en- codings from earlier Mesopotamian secret writings a nd divine rankings leads to another possible solution of the \"666\" enigma. One of the rare (discovered) instances where the nu mber \"6\" was revealed as a divine rank was in a tablet t hat was put together by Alasdair Livingstone in Mystical an d Myth- ological Explanatory Works of Assyrian and Babyloni an Scholars.

Thus, when the alphabet was conceived, the letter \"M\"—Mem . from Ma'yim, water, paralleled the Egyptian and Akk adian pictorial depictions of water (a pictograph of wave s) as well as the pronunciation of the term in those languages for \"wa- ter.\" Was it then just a coincidence that the numer ical value of \"M\" in the Hebrew alphabet was \"40\"—the secret n u- merical rank of Ea/Enki, \"whose home is water,\" the pro- totype Aquarius?

Were one a Sumerian initiate seeking to apply the secret numbers code to this th eophoric name (as used in prefixes and suffixes to personal names), one could say that YHU is a secret code for \"50\" (I A = 10, U = 5, IA.U = 10x5 = 50), with all the theologi cal implications thereof. While attention has been focused on the meaning of \"666,\" we find in the cryptic verse in Revelation a statement of utmost significance. The secret code, it states, is what Wisdom is all about, and it can be deciphered only by those who have Understanding. These are precisely the two terms used by the Sume- rians, and those who came after them, to denote the se- cret knowledge that only privileged initiates had b een taught by the Anunnaki. At the foundation of the incredible and encompassin g Su- merian knowledge lay an equally amazing knowledge o f numbers. As the Assyriologist-mathematician Herman V. Hilprecht observed earlier this century after the d iscovery of numerous Mesopotamian mathematical tablets (The Bab ylo- nian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania), \"all the"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"Hidden Codes, Mystic Numbers 173 multiplication and division tables from the temple libraries of Nippur and Sippar, and from the library of Ashur banipal in Nineveh, are based upon the number 12960000\"—a v ir- tual astronomical number, a number that required as tounding sophistication to be comprehended, and whose utilit y to hu- mans in the fourth millennium B.C. seemed completel y ques- tionable. But analyzing this number—with which some mathemat- ical tablets started—Professor Hilprecht concluded that it could only be related to the phenomenon of Precessi on—the retardation of the Earth in its orbit around the Su n that takes 25,920 years to complete (until the Earth returns t o the exact same spot). That complete circling of the twelve ho uses of the zodiac has been named a Great Year; the astrono mical number 12.960,000 represented 500 such Great Years. But who, except for the Anunnaki, could grasp or have u se for such a vast span of time? In considering numerical and counting systems, the deci- mal system (\"base ten\") is the most obviously \"man- friendly,\" resulting from counting on the fingers o f our hands. Even the perplexing Mayan calendar system cu lled Haab, which divided the solar year into 18 months o f 20 days each (plus 5 special days at year's end) can b e assumed to have resulted from counting all 20 human digits, fingers and toes combined. But from where did the Sumerians take the sexagesimal (\"base 60\") system whose lasting ex pres- sion is still extant in time reckoning (60 minutes, 60 sec- onds), astronomy (a celestial circle of 360 degrees ), and geometry? In our book When Time Began we have suggested that the Anunnaki, coming from a planet whose orbital period (one year on Nibiru) equaled 3,600 orbits of the planet Earth, needed some kind of a common denominator for such d iverse periods—and have found one in the phenomenon of Pre ces- sion (which only they, not men with the shorter lif e spans dictated by Earth's cycles, could have discovered). When they divided the celestial circle into twelve parts , the preces-"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"174 THE COSMIC CODE Figure 64 sional retardation—that could be easily observed by them— was 2,160 years per \"house.\" That, we have suggeste d, led to the ratio of 3,600:2,160 or 10:6 (the eventual G olden Ratio of the Greeks), and to the sexagesimal system that ran 6 x 10 x 6 x 10 and so on (resulting in 60, 360, 3600 a nd so on to the immense number 12,960,000). In this system, several numbers of celestial or sac red im- port seem to be out of place. One is the number sev en, whose significance in the story of Creation, as the seven th or Sab- bath day, in the name of Abraham's abode Beer-Sheba (\"The Well of Seven\") and so on is easily recognize d. In Mesopotamia it was applied to the Seven Who Judge, the Seven Sages, the seven gates of the Lower World, th e seven tablets of Enuma elish. It was an epithet of Enlil (\"Enlil is Seven,\" the Sumerians stated); and—undoubtedly the origin of the number's significance—it was the planetary n umber of Earth. \"Earth (KI) is the seventh.\" all Sumerian astro- nomical texts asserted. This, as we have explained, made sense only to someone coming into the center of our Solar System from the outside. To him (or them) coming fr om the far-out Nibiru, Pluto would be the first planet, Ne ptune and Uranus the second and third, Saturn and Jupiter the fourth and fifth, Mars would be the sixth and Earth the se venth (and then Venus the eighth—as indeed these planets were de- picted on monuments and cylinder seals, Fig. 64).

No wonder, then, that in Hebrew the root from which seven stems—Sh-V-A—is the same root from whic h the meanings \"to be satiated\" and \"to swear, to tak e an oath\" derive). The number \"7\" is a key number in Revelation (7 ang els, 7 seals, and so on); so was the next extraordinary number— 12—or multiples thereof, 144,000 in Revelation 7:3- 5, 14:1 etc. We have already recounted its applications and its sig- nificance, as stemming from the number of the membe rs of our Solar System (Sun, Moon, and 10 planets—the 9 w e know of plus Nibiru). And then—hardly realized—was the peculiar number 72 . To say, as has been done, that it is simply a multi ple of 12 by 6, or that when multiplied by 5 it results in 36 0 (as the number of degrees in a circle), is merely to state the obvious. But why 72 to begin with? We have already observed that the mystics of the Ka ballah arrived through Gematria methods at the number 72 a s the numerical secret of Yahweh. Although obscured in th e bib- lical report of the time when God instructed Moses and Aaron to approach the Holy Mount and to take along 70 of the elders of Israel, the fact is that Moses and Aa ron had 72 companions: In addition to the 70 elders, God instr ucted that 2 sons of Aaron also be invited (although Aaron had 4 sons)—making the total 72. Of all places we also find this odd number 72 in th e Egyp- tian tale dealing with the contending of Horus and Seth. Re- lating the tale from its hieroglyphic sources, Plut arch (in De hide et Osiride, wherein he equated Seth with Typho n of Greek myths) said that when Seth tricked Osiris int o the doomed chest, he did so in the presence of 72 \"divi ne com- rades.\" Why then 72 in these various instances? The only pl au- sible answer, we believe, is to be found in the phe nome- non of Precession, for it is there that the crucial number 72 is to be found, as the number of years it takes to retard the Earth by one degree.

It was perhaps more than a coincidence that Enlil's secret rank number—and the number sought by Marduk—was als o 50. For it was one of the numbers that expressed th e rela- tionships between Divine Time (stemming from Nibiru 's mo- tions), Earthly Time (relating to the motions of th e Earth and its Moon), and Celestial Time (or zodiacal time, re sulting from Precession).

The number 432,000 is al so key in the Hindu and other concepts of Ages and the per iodic catastrophies that befall the Earth. The number 432,000 also embraces 72 precisely 6,000 times. And it is perhaps worth keeping in mind that ac- cording to Jewish sages the count of years in the J ewish calendar—5,758 in A . D . 1998—will come to a completion, a terminus, when it reaches 6,000; it is then that it will all come full cycle. As is evident from the ancient records concerning s uch initiates—Adapa, Enmeduranna, Enoch—the core of the knowledge and understanding revealed to them, no ma tter what else, was astronomy, the calendar, and mathema tics (the \"secret of numbers\"). Indeed, as a review of the en coding and encrypting practices in antiquity has shown, th e common thread between them, no matter what language used, was numbers.

Revealed or secret, straight forward or encrypted, the information had to be recorded, w ritten down. A covenant, a treaty, a prophecy—what value t o those then present or to those who will inhabit the futur e unless the words be written down? When archaeologists excavate an ancient site, nothi ng is deemed more exciting and significant than \"somethin g\" with writing on it—an object, a brick, a stone slab , pottery shards, and needless to say a text or part thereof inscribed on a clay tablet or a papyrus sheet. What was the p lace, what was its ancient name, to what culture did it belong , who were its rulers? A few scribbled letters, a couple of wo rds offer answers; and so much more, of course, fuller texts. One of the earliest antiquarians, if not a full-fle dged ar- chaeologist, was the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal. Be lieving that his own fate and the land's Destiny were deter mined way back in the past, he made written records from the past the prime prize or booty of his conquests; and the library of his palace in Nineveh was at the time (seventh cent ury B.C.) perhaps the greatest collection of clay tablets of countless ancient texts of \"myths\" and epics, royal annals, a nd what was then the \"books\" (on clay tablets) of astronomy , math- ematics, medicine, and other invaluable texts.

A great many of t he texts now known come from the tablets, or fragments there of, found in Nineveh. At the same time, the catalogue t ablets at the start of each shelf also reveal how much is sti ll missing and undiscovered. Certainly missing—for none has been duplicated else - where—are what Ashurbanipal himself identified as \" writ- ings from before the Deluge'\"; we know that they ha d existed because Ashurbanipal had boasted that he could read that writing. The king's assertion, one might note here, has not been taken seriously by modern Assyriologists. Some have amended the king's statement to read \"writings in S ume- rian,\" for it seems incredible not only to claim th at there had been writing millennia before Mesopotamian tablets, but that such writing (on whatever tablets) had survived the global catastrophe. Yet other texts and sources, unrelated to Ashurbani pal or his time, make those very assertions. Adapa—a pre-D iluvial initiate—wrote a book whose title, rendered in Sume rian, was U. SAR Dingir ANUM Dingir ENULA (Writings Re- garding Time [from] divine Anu and divine Enlil). Enoch, another pre-Diluvial ancestor, returned from heaven with 360 \"books\"—a number not only with a ce - lestial/mathematical allusion, but one, let us poin t out, which when converted into letters spells out SeQeR (60+100+200)—\"that which is hidden.\" The name-place Saqqarah in Egypt, the \"hidden place\" of early roya l pyr- amids and burials, stems from the same root. The Book of Enoch (known as 1 Enoch) purports to ha ve been written by Enoch himself as a first-person rep ort. Al- though by all scholarly opinions it was compiled sh ortly be- fore the Christian era, citations from it in other early works and parallels with other extrabiblical writings (as well as the fact that it was canonized in early Christian times ), attest to its being based on truly ancient texts. In the book itself, after a brief introduction that explains who the Nefilim (of Genesis"},{"pageNumber":182,"pageContent":"180 THE COSMIC CODE 6 renown) were, Enoch states that what follows is \" the book of the words of righteousness and of the reprimand of the eternal Nefilim\" that were heard by him during a vi sion and which he now proceeds to put down \"in a human lan- guage\"—a language \"which the Great One has given to men to converse therewith.\" Having been given knowledge of the heavens and the Earth and their mysteries, Enoch was told to write down prophecies of future events (according to the Book of Jubi- lees, Enoch was shown \"what was and what will be\"). Al- though scholars assume that the \"prophecies\" were r eally hindsight, the incorporation in 1 Enoch of earlier texts and its subseqent canonization attest that at the time of the Sec- ond Temple it was firmly believed that the future c ould be and was foretold in the past by divine inspiration— even dic- tated by the Lord himself or his Angels to humans, to be recorded and written down and passed to future gene rations. Even more emphatic in asserting that Enoch brought down with him books that contained not only scientific k nowledge but also prophecies of the future is the version kn own as 2 Enoch or by the full title The Book of the Secrets of Enoch. It states that God instructed Enoch to \"give the ha ndwritten books to his children\" so that they may be handed d own \"from generation to generation and from nation to n ation.\" Then God disclosed to him the \"secrets of Creation\" and the cycles of the events on Earth. \"At the beginnin g of the eighth thousand of years there will be a time of No t- Counting, [a time] with neither years nor months or weeks, nor days or hours\" (2 Enoch 33:1-2). A reference is then made to even earlier writings t hat be- longed to Enoch's ancestors Adam and Seth—\"handwrit ing that should not be destroyed till the end of time.\" There is also reference to a \"chart\" that God has \"put on Ea rth\" and \"ordered that it be preserved, and that the handwri ting of thy fathers be preserved, and that it perish not in the Deluge which I shall bring upon thy race.\" The reference to a future Deluge, included in 2 Eno ch as a prophetic revelation by God to Enoch, thus speaks of"},{"pageNumber":183,"pageContent":"Prophecy: Writings from the Past 181 \"handwritings\" by both Adam and his son Seth and a divine \"chart\" that were deposited on Earth and were to su rvive the Deluge.

At the time of the Second Temple it was held that among su ch pre- Diluvial writings were the Books of Adam and Eve. i n which many details were provided, augmenting the biblical tale. Scholars agree that 1 Enoch has clearly incorporate d, ver- batim, sections from a much earlier manuscript call ed the Book of Noah, a work that was mentioned in other wr itings besides the Book of Enoch. It could well have been the source of the very enigmatic eight verses in Genesi s chapter 6; preceding the biblical version of the Deluge and its hero Noah, those verses speak of the Nefilim, the \"sons of the Elohim\" who had married the Daughters of The Adam a s the background for God's decision to wipe mankind o ff the face of the Earth. In it, the tale is fully told, t he Nefilim are identified, the nature of the divine wrath is expla ined. Hark- ing back in all probability to Sumerian times and s ources, it includes some details otherwise known only from the Me- sopotamian Atra Hasis text. It is more than likely that the two books mentioned above—the Books of Adam and Eve and the Book of Noa h— did in fact exist, in one form or another, and were actually known to the compilers of the Old Testament. After having described the creation of The Adam and of Eve, and the incident in the Garden of Eden and the birth of Cai n and Abel and then of Enosh, Genesis restarts (in chapte r 5) the genealogical record by saying, \"This is the book of the gen- erations of Adam\" and recounts the creation tale.

Interesting and intriguing light on what the Book o f Noah might have contained is to be found in the Book of Jubilees, another one of the Apocrypha (extrabiblical) books from the time of the Second Temple (or earlier). It states t hat the An- gels \"explained to Noah all the medicines, all the diseases and how he might heal them with herbs of the earth; and Noah wrote down all things in a book, concerning ev ery kind of medicine.\" And after the Deluge, Noah \"gave all mat he had written to his son Shem.\" Starting a new chapter not only in the Bible but in human affairs again with the word Toledoth is next found in Genesis chapter 10. Dealing with the post-Diluvial rimes, i t begins, \"Now these are the 'generations' of the sons of Noa h: Shem, Ham and Japhet; and unto them were born sons after the Deluge.\" The general list, nicknamed by biblical sc holars the Table of Nations, reverts to Shem and his desce ndants and pays special attention to the line of his middl e son Ar- packhshad both in this chapter and by returning to the subject in chapter 11 with the opening \"These are the 'gene rations' of Shem.\" The significance, we soon gather, is that it was the direct ancestral line of Abraham's family. The existence of a book that we might arbitrarily t itle The Book of Shem or, more specifically, the Book of Arpakhshad, is suggested by yet another tradition concerning wr itings from before the Deluge.

An unambiguous reference to pre-Diluvial writings a nd what had happened to them as far as the destruction by the avalanche of waters was concerned is found in the w ritings of Berossus. A Babylonian historian-priest who comp iled a history of Mankind for the Greek rulers of the Near East after the death of Alexander, he clearly had access to a li- brary of ancient writings in Akkadian (and possibly in Su- merian, too: In the first volume of his writings, d escribing events from the splash landing of Ea to the Deluge, he called the hero of the Great Flood by his Sumerian name, Z iusudra). In the fragments of Berossus's writings that are av ailable from Greek historians, it is stated that after Ea/E nki had re- vealed to Sisithros (= Ziusudra) that there would b e a Del- uge, \"he ordered him to conceal every available wri ting in Sippar, the city of Shamash. Sisithros accomplished all these things, sailed immediately to Armenia, and thereupo n what the god had announced did happen.\" Those writings w ere about \"beginnings, middles, and ends.\" Berossus continued to relate that among those who w ere in the ark and survived the Deluge was Sambethe, th e wife of one of the sons of Ziusudra/Noah—her name probab ly a corruption of the Sumerian or Akkadian Sabitu (\"The Sev- enth\"). According to Berossus \"she was the first of the Sy- bils, and she had prophesied concerning the buildin g of the Tower of Babylon and all that happened to the enter prises"},{"pageNumber":186,"pageContent":"184 THE COSMIC CODE of its planners; this was before the division of th e lan- guages.\" To this first of a line of oracle prophetesses (the most renowned of which was the Sybil in Delphi) was attr ibuted the role of intermediary between the gods and the s urvivors of the Deluge. She uttered to them the words that w ere \"a voice from the air,\" which directed them how to sur vive after the Deluge and \"how to recover from Sippar th e books that described the future of Mankind.\" The ubiquitous traditions and recollections regardi ng writ- ings from before the Flood clearly persist in asser ting that apart from all manner of scientific knowledge they also in- cluded prophecies concerning the future. As often a s not, such prophecies concerned not only fateful events t hat would befall individuals or nations, but also humanity's and Earth's ultimate destiny. Enoch was shown \"what was and what will be,\" and wrote down for future generations the secrets of cr eation and the cycles of events on Earth. God had placed a \"ch art\" on Earth, determining the destiny of the planet and al l that is upon it. The writings from before the Deluge were a bout \"beginnings, middles and ends.\" Indeed, as one reviews the beliefs underlying all t hese di- verse statements, one begins to understand why the editors of Genesis in its Hebrew version had omitted the Al eph to make the beginning start with Beginning, with a \"B\" (Beth). For the very notion of a beginning incorporates wit hin it a notion of an end. The very admonition that the anci ent writ- ings, containing all that there is to be known—thos e ancient \"data banks,\" to use computer lingo—must be preserv ed until the \"end of times\" or \"end of days\" implies t hat such an end had been destined. By starting with beginnin g, the Bible's editors subscribed to that belief. These concepts permeate the Bible, from the very st art in Genesis through the books of the Prophets to the fi nal books (of the Hebrew Bible). \"And Jacob called unto his s ons, and said: Come, gather, and I shall tell you that which shall befall"},{"pageNumber":187,"pageContent":"Prophecy: Writings from the Past 185 you at the end of days\" (Genesis 49:1). Fearing tha t the Israelites would abandon the commandments after his death. Moses alerted them to the \"evils that will befall y ou in the last days\" (Deuteronomy 31:29). Coupled with that a dmo- nition was a prediction—a prophecy—of the Fate and future of each one of the tribes of Israel. The prophetic visions of Isaiah open with the statement, \"And it shall be at the end of days\" (2:2); and the Prophet Jeremiah clearly ex plained that what shall be \"at the end of days\" had been pl anned \"in Yahweh's heart\" from the very beginning (23:20) . \"He tells the End at the Beginning,\" Isaiah extolled th e Lord God (46:10). God was the ultimate prophet and the source of all proph- ecy. That biblical view found expression even where the text seems just to report events. The punishment imposed on Adam and Eve after they had eaten the forbidden fru it in me Garden of Eden foresaw the future ways of human bei ngs. Cain was given a protective mark, for otherwise he and his descendants would be avenged for seventy and seven gen- erations. In a covenant made by God with Noah and h is sons. He promised mat mere would never again be a Deluge. In a covenant with Abraham, God foretold his future as t he father of multitudes of nations; but predicted that a time would come when his offspring would be enslaved in a fore ign land—a bitter experience that would last 400 years (as the Israelite sojourn in Egypt eventually did). And reg arding the barren Sarah, God predicted that she would have a s on and that out of her womb there would come nations and k ings thereof. Encompassing the human story from Adam and Eve through me destruction of the First Temple of Jerus alem and its rebuilding by returning exiles in the sixth cen tury B.C., the Old Testament also tells, indirectly and almost unpercep- tibly, the shift of prophecy from a direct communic ation from God to one through Angels (literally: Emissari es) and men through Prophets.

After several attempts he was persuaded by the Moabite king to try once mo re; but then, in a divine vision, he could \"hear the saying s of God and discern the knowledge of the One who is Most Hi gh.\" \"Though not nigh, I can see it,\" Bala'am announced of the Star of Jacob; \"though not now, it steppeth forth.\" And that is what the divine message is, he said: the Sons of Israel shall defeat and conquer the nations standing in th eir way. Incredibly, the list of those doomed nations includ ed As- syria—a nation not at all present in Canaan at the time of the Exodus and whose kings assaulted only many cent uries later the Israelite kingdoms that were yet to be fo rmed. A case of prophecy based on past prophecies was the fu- ture great battle of Gog and Magog that was reveale d to the Prophet Ezekiel (chapters 38 and 39)—a battle that in the apocalyptic literature of the time assumed the role of the final batde in the last millennium, the Armageddon of the New Testament.

Foreseeing the world's nations ga thered together to find out what is in store, the Prophet Isaiah en- visioned them asking each other, \"Who among us can tell the future by letting us hear the First Things?'' M ocking that quest among the nations who ask about the past and the future not God but each other. Isaiah declared that only Yah- weh, the Lord of Hosts, has that knowledge (Isaiah chapter 43). That is further enlarged upon in Isaiah chapte r 48, wherein Yahweh announced: It is I who had told the first things, out of my mouth were they uttered. And I shall announce them suddenly: And when I shall do so, it shall happen. The quest for the hidden past in order to divine th e future permeates not only the books of the Prophets but al so the biblical books of Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. \"Give ear, my people, to my teachings, incline your ears to the w ords of my mouth; I will open my mouth with parables and wi ll utter riddles from olden times,\" the Psalmist (78:2-3) sa id of the remembrances passed from generation to generation.

A nuclear holocaust was unleashed; it vaporized the spaceport, leaving a huge gash in the peninsula 's face and a vast blackened area all around it. The \"sinni ng cities\" that sided with Nabu in what was then a fertile val ley south of the Dead Sea were likewise obliterated—an upheav al that Abraham could see from his abode in the south of Ca naan. But as Fate would have it, the nuclear \"cloud of de ath,\" carried by the prevailing Mediterranean winds, drif ted east- ward toward Mesopotamia; in its path, all that was alive— people, animals, plants—died a horrible death. As t he deathly cloud neared Sumer, the Anunnaki gods began to abandon their cities. But Nannar/Sin would not acce pt the doom of his splendid city Ur. His appeals to Anu an d Enlil to find a way to spare Ur were of no avail; and as the helpless Enlil bluntly told him, \"Ur was granted kingship—an ev- erlasting reign it was not granted... Its kingship, its reign, has been cut\"—not to everlast was its NAM.TAR, a De stiny that can be cut and broken, Fate. But as fate would have it, the winds, as they reach ed Mes- opotamia, changed course to the southeast. And whil e Sumer and its great olden cities lay prostrate and desola te, the city of Babylon to the north was completely spared. Until then Marduk had looked to the heavens to divi ne his Fate. The miraculous sparing of Babylon from the nu clear death and desolation led him to wonder whether his now unobstructed way to supremacy was more man Fate— whether it was his Destiny. Were Marduk not a deity already, one could have sai d that what ensued was his deification. In the circumstanc es, let us call it his Celestialization. The vehicle for that was an alter- ation (\"falsification\" is equally applicable) of th e hallowed text of Enuma elish: to call Nibiru \"Marduk\" and th ereby make me supreme planetary god and the supreme god o n Earth one and the same.

The coronation—to use an understandable term—of Mar - duk as \"king of the gods\" took place in a solemn ce remony, at an assembly of the Fifty Great Gods and the \"Sev en Gods of Destiny,\" and with hundreds of rank and file Anu nnaki present. Symbolically, Enlil laid before Marduk his divine weapon, the Bow (which in the heavens had the Bow-s tar as its counterpart). Then the transfer of the Enlil-po wers to Mar- duk was further celebrated by the transfer to Mardu k of the secret numerical rank of 50.

That su ch secret meanings or encodings underlay the fifty nam es was recognized by the renowned Assyriologist and biblic al scholar E. A. Speiser; rendering Enuma elish in Eng lish for Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Test ament. he observed that \"the text etymologizes the names i n a man- ner made familiar by the Bible; the etymologies, wh ich ac- company virtually every name on the long list, are meant to be cabalistic and symbolic rather than strictly lin guistic.\" There is more in the Fifty Names of a \"Kabbalistic\" na- ture than the above observation allows. The first n ine names are listed at the end of the sixth tablet of Enuma elish, and are accompanied by several accolade verses. As had been noted by Franz M. Th. Bohl in his Die funfzig Namen des Marduk, the utterance of those first nine names was attributed to forefathers not only of Marduk but even of Anu h imself; three of them contained triple meanings each; and i n one such meaning-within-meaning, the unique (and otherw ise un- reported) ability to \"revive the dead gods\" was att ributed to Marduk. That. Franz Bohl suggested, could be a refe rence to the death and resurrection of Osiris (of Egyptian l ore), be- cause the ensuing three names (numbers 10, 11, 12) are var- iants of the epithet-name ASAR (Asaru in Akkadian) and, according to Bohl, three epithets that paralleled t hree epithets of the Egyptian god. With those three epithet-names Enuma elish moves on to the seventh tablet—not without implications for the seven days of Creation in Genesis (of which the first six were per- iods of activity and the seventh a day of rest and divine contemplation); and seven was, we will recall, the planetary designation of Earth and of Enlil as Earth's Comman der.

One was that of a god who was certain that his Fate had become a Destiny; the other was of a man whose Destiny became his Fate. The god was Marduk; the man was Abraham; the place where their paths crossed was Harran. And an outcome of that was to last to our very own times, when Babylon (now Iraq) rained deathly missiles on the land of Jerusalem (now Israel). That Abraham had sojourned in Harran is known from the Bible. That Marduk had wanderings in faraway lands, and that he ended up in the land of the Hittites, we kn ow from his autobiography. That the specific place where he had spent twenty-four years was Harran is surmised by us from the very opening words of Marduk's \"autobiography\": He be- gins his query, \"Until when?\" by addressing it to i lu Har- anim, the \"gods of Harran\" (Fig. 66), as the immedi ately present gods, and only then goes on to the distant Great Gods Who Judge. Indeed, to be in Harran was a logical choice, for i t was a major urban and religious center—lying at the cross roads of trade routes—and a hub of communications, at the bo rder of Sumer and Akkad but not yet within Sumer proper, Ha rran was a perfect headquarters for the god whose son wa s raising an invasion army.

To be certain that he was traveling correctly. Abram awaited further instructions; and \"Yahweh appeared there unto Abram,\" confirming that he was in the right place. Moving on, Abram reached Beth-El (\"God 's Abode\") and again \"called out the name of Yahweh,\" con- tinuing thereafter without stopping to the Negev (\" The Dry- ness\"), me southernmost part of Canaan bordering on the Sinai peninsula. He did not linger there long. Food was short there. So Abram moved on, all the way to Egypt. It is customa ry to depict Abraham as a nomadic Bedouin chieftain, spen ding his days tending his flocks or lolling in his tent. In fact he had to be much more than that, for otherwise why wa s he chosen by Yahweh to be sent on the divinely ordaine d mis- sion? He was descended from a line of priests; and the names of his and his brother's wives, Sarai (\"princess\") and Mil- cah (\"queenly\") indicate a connection with Sumer's royal line. No sooner did Abram reach the Egyptian border than he coached his wife on how to behave when they woul d be received at the Pharaoh's court (and later on, back in Canaan, he dealt with its kings as an equal). After a sojou rn of five years in Egypt, when Abram was ordered back to the Negev, he was provided by the Pharaoh with a great number of men and women to be in his service, and with flocks of sheep and herds of oxen and she-asses and he-asses—as wel l as with a flock of highly prized camels. The inclusion of camels is significant, for they were suited for military p urposes in desert conditions. That a military conflict was brewing we learn in th e chap- ter immediately following in Genesis (chapter 14), dealing with the invasion of southern Canaan by a coalition of Kings of the East—from Sumer and its protectorates (such as Elam,"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Navel of the Earth 201 in the Zagros Mountains, which was renowned for its fight- ing men). Capturing city after city as they followe d the King's Highway, they detoured around the Dead Sea a nd headed straight for the Sinai peninsula (see map p. 26). But there Abram and his armed men blocked the invaders' way. Disappointed, the invaders satisfied themselves by looting the five cities (that included Sodom and Gomorrah) in the fertile plain south of the Dead Sea; among the pris oners they took was Lot, Abram's nephew. When word reached Abram that his nephew had been taken captive, he pursued the invaders with 318 sel ect men all the way to Damascus. Since some time had passed until a refugee from Sodom told Abram about his nephew's cap- ture, it was quite a feat for Abram to catch up wit h the in- vaders, who were already at Dan, in the north of Ca naan. It is our suggestion that the \"trained young men\" as t hey are called in Genesis were camel-riding cavalrymen (Fig . 67), from a Mesopotamian sculpture. \"It was after those events,\" the Bible states (Gene sis 15), \"that Yahweh spoke to Abram in a vision, saying: Fe ar not, Abram; I am thy shielder; thy reward shall be excee dingly great.\" It is time to review the Abram saga up to this poin t and to ask some questions. Why was Abram told to forsak e everything and go to a completely strange place? Wh at was special about Canaan? Why the rush to reach the Neg ev, on the border of the Sinai peninsula? Why the royal re ception in Egypt and the return with an army and a camel-ca valry? What was the target of the invaders from the East? And why was their defeat at the hands of Abram deserving of a prom- ise of a \"great reward\" from God? Far from the customary picture painted of Abram as a nomadic sheepherder, he turns out to be a superb mi litary leader and a major actor on the international scene .

And it was because Ab ram successfully protected the gateway to the spaceport that Yah- weh assured him of a great reward—as well as promis ed him protection from future retribution by the losing si de. The War of the Kings took place, by our calculation s, in 2041 B.C. The year after that the princes of the so uth captured Memphis in Egypt and dethroned Abram's ally, declar ing allegiance to Amon-Ra, the \"hidden\" or \"unseen\" Ra/ Mar- duk, who was then still in exile.

Things were no less hectic in Sumer and its empire. Ce- lestial omens, including a total lunar eclipse in 2 031 B.C., predicted coming doom. Under the pressure of Nabu's war- riors, the last kings of Sumer drew back their forc es and protective outposts ever closer to the capital Ur. There was little comfort to be found in appeals to the gods, for the gods themselves were engulfed in the sharpening confront ation with Marduk. Gods as well as men looked to the heav ens for signs. A human, even one as qualified or chosen as Abram, could no longer protect the essential facili ty of the Anunnaki, the spaceport. And so, in 2024 B.C., with the con- sent of the Council of the Great Gods, Nergal and N inurta used nuclear weapons to keep the prize from Marduk. It is all described vividly and in detail in the Erra Epo s; it is there also that a sideshow, the upheaval of the \"sinning cities\" that included Sodom and Gomorrah, is recounted. Abram was forewarned about what was to happen: at h is request, two Angels of the Lord went to Sodom the d ay before the nuking of the spaceport and the cities t o save Lot and his family.

In the mountains in south- eastern Jordan, Lot and his daughters huddled in fe ar; their mother, having lingered behind as they were escapin g from Sodom, was vaporized by the nuclear explosion. (The usual translation of the words, that she was turned into a pillar of salt, stems from a misreading of the Sumerian word that could mean both \"salt\" and \"vapor\"). Convinced that they had just witnessed the end of the world, the two da ughters of Lot decided that the only way to enable the huma n race to survive was to have them sleep with their own fa ther. Each one had a son that way; they were, according to the Bible, the progenitors of two tribes east of the Jordan Ri ver: the Moabites and the Amonites. And as for Abraham: \"God remembered Sarah as he had promised\" (when He appeared to them with the two An gels the year before), \"and Sarah conceived and bore Abr aham a son in his old age,\" and they named the son Isaac. Abraham was 100 years old at the time; Sarah was 90. With the spaceport gone, Abraham's mission had come to an end. Now it was up to God to keep His end of the bargain. He had \"cut a covenant\" with Abraham to give him an d his descendants as an everlasting legacy the lands betw een the Brook of Egypt and the Euphrates River. And now, th rough Isaac, the promise had to be kept. And there was also the question of what to do with the other space facilities."},{"pageNumber":207,"pageContent":"Navel of the Earth 205 There were, to be sure, two such facilities in addi tion to the spaceport itself. One was the Landing Place, to which Gilgamesh had set his course. The other was the Mis sion Control Center—no longer needed, but still intact; a post- Diluvial \"Navel of the Earth,\" serving the same fun ction as the pre-Diluvial \"Navel of the Earth\" that Nippur h ad been. To understand the similar functions and consequentl y sim- ilar layouts, one should compare our sketches of th e pre- and post-Diluvial space facilities. Before the Deluge ( Fig. 69) Nippur, designated the \"Navel of the Earth\" because it was at the center of concentric circles delineating the Landing Corridor, served as Mission Control Center. Cities of the Gods whose names meant \"Seeing the Red Light\" (Lars a), \"Seeing the Halo at Six\" (Lagash) and \"Seeing the B right Halo\" (Laraak) marked out both the equidistant spac ing and the landing path toward Sippar (\"Bird City\"), the s ite of the spaceport. The landing path, within an elongated La nding Corridor, was based at its point on the twin peaks of Mount Ararat—the most prominent topographic feature in th e Near East. Where that line intersected the precise line northward, the spaceport was to be built. Thus, the Landing Pa th formed a precise 45° angle with the geographic parallel. After the Deluge, when humanity was granted the thr ee Regions, the Anunnaki retained for themselves the F ourth Region—the Sinai peninsula. There, in the central p lain, the ground was both flat and hard (perfect tank terrain , as mod- ern armies have concluded), unlike the mud-buried a nd water-clogged post-Diluvial plain in Mesopotamia. C hoosing again the twin peaks of Ararat as the anchor point, the An- unnaki drew a landing path at the same 45° angle to the geographic parallel—the 30th parallel north (Fig. 7 0). There in the central plain of the Sinai peninsula, where the diagonal line intersected the 30th parallel, wa s to be the spaceport.

There was every reason to include this place—a vast stone platform of massive construction—in the new space f acili- ties. That, in turn, determined by equidistant conc entric cir- cles the location of Mission Control Center. To complete the space facilities, it was necessary to anchor the Landing Corridor. In its southeastern end, two nearby peaks—one of which remained hallowed to this day as the so-called Mount Moses—were handy. In the equidistan t northwestern edge mere were no peaks, just a flat p lateau. The Anunnaki—not any mortal Pharaoh—built there two ar- tificial mountains, the two great pyramids of Giza (the smaller Third Pyramid, we have suggested in The Sta irway to Heaven, was built first as a test scale model). The layout was completed with a \"mythological\" animal carved f rom the native rock—the sphinx. It gazes precisely alon g the 30th parallel, eastward toward the spaceport in the Sina i.

The king of Sodom was more genero us: Keep all the wealth, he said, just return to me the captives. But Abram would have none of that; swearing by \"'Ya hweh, the God Most High, Creator of Heaven and Earth,\" he said he would not keep even a shoelace (Genesis chapter 14). (Scholars have long debated, and will undoubtedly c on- tinue to debate, whether Abraham swore by the \"God Most High\" of Melchizedek, or meant to say: No, Yahweh i s the God Most High by whom I will swear.) This is the first time that an allusion is made in the Bible to Jerusalem, here called Shalem. That this was a r eference to what was later known as Jerusalem is based not o nly on long-standing traditions, but also on the clear ide ntification in Psalm 76:3.

It was a place—the only place in Canaan—where a priest servi ng the God Most High was located. And the question is, Why there? What was special about the place? The second seemingly unnecessary digression had to do with the testing by God of Abraham's devotion. Abra m had already carried out his mission to Canaan. God had already promised him that his reward would be great, that G od him- self should protect him. The miracle of a son and L egal Heir at extreme old age had happened; Abram's name was changed to Abraham, \"Father of a multitude of natio ns.\" The land was promised to him and his descendants; t he promise was incorporated in a covenant that involve d a mag- ical ritual. Sodom and Gomorrah had been destroyed and all was ready to let Abraham and his son enjoy the peac e and quiet to which they were surely entitled.

B ut why was the test, if it was needed at all, not conducte d just where Abraham and Isaac dwelt, near Beersheba? Why the ne ed to undertake a journey of three days? Why go to the pa rt of Canaan mat God identified as the Land of Moriah, an d there to locate a specific mount—which God himself pointe d out— to conduct there the test? As in the first instance, there had to be something special about the chosen place. We read (Genesis 22:4) that , \"On the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the p lace from a distance.\" The area was rich, if with anything, w ith barren mounts; from nearby, and certainly from a distance, they all look alike. Yet Abraham recognized the particular m ount \"from a distance.\" There had to be something there that distinguished it from all me other mounts. So much so that when the ordeal was over he gave the place a long- remembered name: The Mount Where Yahweh Is Seen. As 2 Chronicles 3:1 makes clear, Mount Moriah was the Jeru- salem peak on which the Temple was eventually built . From the time Jerusalem became a city, it encompass ed three mounts. Listed from the northeast to the sout hwest, they have been Mount Zophim (\"Mount of Observers,\" now called Mount Scopus in English), Mount Moriah (\"Mount of Directing, of Pointing Out\") in the cent er, and Mount Zion (\"Mount of the Signal\"); these are desig na- tions of functions that bring to mind the function- names of the Beacon Cities of the Anunnaki marking out Nippu r and the Landing Path when the spaceport had been in Mes opo- tamia. Jewish legends relate that Abraham recognized Mount Moriah from a distance because he saw upon it \"a pi llar of fire reaching from the Earth to Heaven, and a heavy cloud in which the Glory of God was visible.\" This langua ge is almost identical to the biblical description of the presence of the Lord upon Mount Sinai during the Exodus. But pu tting"},{"pageNumber":217,"pageContent":"Navel of the Earth 215 such lore aside, what we believe Abraham saw that i dentified the mount as different, that distinguished it from all others there, was the great platform upon it. A platform which, though smaller than at Baalbek's Landing Place, was also part of the space facilitie s of the Anunnaki. For Jerusalem (before it became Jerusalem ), we suggest, was the post-Diluvial Mission Control C enter. And, as at Baalbek, that platform, too, still exist s. The reason (for the first) and purpose (of the seco nd) di- gressions thus come into focus. The fulfillment of his mission was marked by a formal celebration, including a pri estly blessing of Abraham with the ceremonial bread and w ine, at a site—the only site in Canaan—directly connected t o the presence of the Elohim. The second diversion was me ant to test Abraham's qualifications for a chosen status a fter the destruction of the spaceport and the resulting dism antling of the accoutrements of Mission Control Center; and to renew there the covenant in the presence of Abraham's suc cessor.

Such a renewal of the divine vow indeed foll owed right away after the test: And the Angel of Yahweh called out to Abraham for a second time from the skies, saying, this is Yahweh's word: \"This is my oath: Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, the unique one, I will greatly bless thee and I will exceedingly multiply thy seed... And in thy seed shall the nations of the Earth be blessed.

The sin gular prize went to King David, who circa 1000 B.C.—a tho usand years after me testing of Abraham—captured the Jebu site settlement and moved the capital from Hebron to wha t has been called in the Bible the City of David. It is important to realize that the Jebusite settle ment mat David captured, and his new capital, were not at al l \"Jeru- salem\" as it is now envisioned, not even the walled \"Old City.\" The area captured by David and thereafter kn own as the City of David was on Mount Zion, not Mount Mori ah.

All the evidence sugge sts that the platform already existed when the construction of a Tem- ple was even contemplated. Who then built the platform, with all the earthwork s and stonework that it entailed? Our answer, of course, is: the same master builders who had built the platform at Baalbek (and, for that matter, the vast and precisely posit ioned plat- form on which the Great Pyramid of Giza stands). The great platform that covers the Temple Mount is sur- rounded by walls that serve both as retaining walls and as fortifications. The Bible reports that Solomon buil t such walls, as did Judean kings after him. Visible secti ons of the walls, especially on the southern and eastern sides , display constructions from various later periods. Invariabl y, the lower (and thus more ancient) courses are built of larger and better-shaped stone blocks. Of these walls, only th e Western Wall, by tradition and as confirmed by archaeology, has re- mained hallowed as an actual remnant from the time of the First Temple—at least in its lowest courses where a shlars (perfectly cut and shaped stone blocks) are the lar gest. For almost two millennia, since the destruction of the Second Temple, Jews held on to this remnant, worshiping th ere, praying to God, seeking personal succor by insertin g slips of paper with a request to God between the ashlars, be wailing the Temple's destruction and the Jewish people's di sper- sion—so much so that, in time, the Crusaders and ot her con- querors of Jerusalem nicknamed the Western Wall the \"Wailing Wall.\" Until the reunification of Jerusalem by Israel in 1 967, the Western Wall was no more than a sliver of a wall, a bout a hundred feet or so squeezed between residential hou ses. In front was left a narrow space for the prayers, and on both sides, rising house atop house, it encroached on th e Holy Mount. When the houses were removed, a large plaza was formed in front of the Western Wall and its extensi on all the way to its southern corner was unveiled (Fig. 82). And, for the first lime in almost two millennia, it was real ized that the retaining walls extend downward nearly as much as t hey had"},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":" Figure 82 been exposed above what has been considered ground level.

How far down and how fa r north did all that extend? That was a puzzle that I sraeli ar- chaeologists finally began to tackle. In the end what they discovered was mind-boggling. Using data from the Bible, from the Book of Maccabe es and from the writings of the Jewish-Roman historian Jose- phus (and taking into account even a medieval legen d that King David knew of a way to ascend the Mount from t he west), Israeli archaeologists concluded that Wilson 's Arch was the entranceway to what must have been in earli er times an open-air street that ran along the Western Wall, and that the Wall itself extended northward by hundreds of f eet. The laborious clearing of the rubble, confirming those assump- tions, led to the opening in 1996 of the \"Archaeolo gical Tunnel\" (an event that made headlines for more than one reason).

Those wonders of wonder s re- ferred principally to the things created and foreto ld in the long-ago past; they were also the subject of Daniel 's inquiry when he sought to divine the End of Time (12:6). There thus appear to be wheels within wheels, meani ngs within meanings, codes within codes in those verses con- cerning a millennial period: not just the obvious n umerical sequential count of passing time, but also a built- in duration of the Covenant, a coded affirmation of monotheism, and a prophecy concerning the millennium and the End of Y ears. And, as the Bible makes clear, the thousand years w hose count began with the building of the Temple—coincid ing with what is now called the last millennium B.C.—wa s a time of prophecy. To understand the events and prophecies of that las t mil- lennium, one ought to turn the clock back to the pr eceding millennium, to the nuclear calamity and the assumpt ion of supremacy by Marduk.

There, as we have already mentione d, Nannar/ Sin refused to believe that his city's fate was sea led. In the lamentation she herself wrote later, his spouse Nin gal de- scribed how, in spite of the foul smell of the dead whose bodies filled the city they stayed on \"and did not flee.\" Nor did they flee on the night that followed me awesome day. But by morning the two deities, huddled in their zi ggurat's subterranean chamber, realized that the city was do omed, and they, too, left. The nuclear cloud, shifted southward by the winds, spared Babylon; and that was taken as an omen reinforcing the grant of the fifty names to Marduk as an indication of hi s deserved supremacy. His first step was to carry out his fath er's sug- gestion that the Anunnaki themselves build for him his house/temple in Babylon, the E.SAG.IL (\"House of Lo fty Head\"). To that was added in the sacred precinct an other temple for the celebration of the New Year and the reading of the revised Enuma elish; its name, E.TEMEN.AN.KI (\"House of the Foundation Heaven-Earth\") was clearl y in- tended to indicate that it had replaced Enlil's DUR .AN.KI (\"Bond Heaven-Earth\"), which had been at the heart of Nip- pur when it was Mission Control Center. Scholars have paid scant attentionto the issue of m athe- matics in the Bible, leaving untackled what should have been a puzzle: Why has the Hebrew Bible adopted complete ly the decimal system, although Abraham was an Ibri—a Sume rian from Nippur—and all the tales in Genesis (as echoed in the Psalms and elsewhere) were based on Sumerian texts? Why was the Sumerian sexagesimal system (\"base 60\") not at all"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"236 THE COSMIC CODE echoed in the Bible's numerology—a practice that cu lmi- nated in the concept of a millennium? One wonders whether Marduk had been cognizant of th is issue. He marked his assumption of supremacy by pro claim- ing a New Age (that of the Ram), by revising the ca lendar, and by building a new Gateway of the Gods. In those steps one can find evidence also for a new mathematics—a tacit shift from the sexagesimal to the decimal system. The focal point of those changes was the temple-zig gurat honoring him, that Enki suggested be built by the A nunnaki themselves. Archaeological discoveries of its remai ns (after repeated rebuildings) as well as the information pr ovided by tablets with precise architectural data, reveal tha t the ziggurat rose in seven stages, the topmost of which served a s the actual residence of Marduk. Planned (as Marduk hims elf had claimed) \"in accordance with the writings of the Up per Heaven,\" it was a square structure whose base or fi rst stage measured 15 gar (about 300 feet) on each side and r ising 5.5 gar (about 110 feet); atop that there was a second stage, smaller and shorter; and so on, until the whole tem ple reached a combined height of the same 300 feet as t he bot- tom base. The result was a cube whose circumference equaled 60 gar in each of its three dimensions, giv ing the structure the celestial number 3600 when squared (6 0 x 60) and 216,000 when cubed (60 x 60 x 60). But in that number was hidden a shift to the decimal system, for it re presented the zodiacal number 2,160 multiplied by 100. The four corners of the ziggurat faced precisely to the four cardinal points of the compass. As studies by archa eoastron- omers have shown, the staggered height of each of t he first six stages was precisely calculated to enable celes tial obser- vations at that particular geographic location. The ziggurat was thus intended not only to surpass Enlil's oneti me Ekur, but also to take over Nippur's astronomical/calendr ical func- tions. This was carried out in practice by the institution of a revision of the calendar—a matter of theological pr estige as well as of necessity, because the zodiacal shift (f rom Taurus"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"A Time of Prophecy 237 to Aries) also necessitated an adjustment of one mo nth in the calender if Nissan (\"The Standard Bearer\") was to r emain the first month and the month of the spring equinox . To achieve that, Marduk ordered that the last month of the year, Addaru, was to be doubled that year. (The device of doubling Addar seven times within a cycle of nineteen years has been adopted in the Hebrew calendar as a way to periodic ally realign the lunar and solar years). As in Mesopotamia, so was the calendar revised in E gypt. Originally devised there by Thoth, whose \"secret nu mber\" was 52, it divided the year into 52 weeks of 7 days each, resulting in a solar year of only 364 days (an issu e prominent in the Book of Enoch). Marduk (as Ra) instituted in stead a year based on a division into 10: he divided the ye ar into 36 \"decans\" of ten days each; the resulting 360 days w ere then followed by five special days, to complete 365. The New Age ushered in by Marduk was not one of mon o- theism. Marduk did not declare himself sole god; in deed, he needed the other gods to be present and to hail him as su- preme. To that purpose he provided in the sacred pr ecinct of Babylon shrines, small temples and residences for a ll the other principal gods, and invited them to make thei r homes therein. There is no indication in any of the texts that any accepted the invitation. In fact, at about the time that the royal dynasty that Marduk had envisioned was finall y in- stalled in Babylon circa 1890 B.C., the dispersed g ods began to establish their own new domains all around Mesop otamia. Prominent among them was Elam in the east, with Sus a (later the biblical Shushan) as its capital and Nin urta as its \"national god.\" In the west, a kingdom whose capita l was called Mari (from the term Amurru, the Western One) blos- somed out into its own on the western banks of the Euphrates River; its magnificent palaces were decorated with murals showing Ishtar investing the king (Fig. 84), attest ing to the high standing of that goddess there.

And between the Land of the Hittites a nd Bab- ylonia there arose a brand-new kingdom—that of Assy ria, with a pantheon identical to mat of Sumer and Akkad , except that the national god was named Ashur—the \"Seeing O ne.\" He combined the powers and identities of both Enlil and Anu, and his depiction as a god within a winged cir cular object (Fig. 85) dominated Assyrian monuments. And, in distant Africa, there was Egypt, the Kingdo m of the Nile. But there a chaotic period, called by sch olars the Second Intermediate Period, removed the country fro m the international scene until the so-called New Kingdom began circa 1650 B.C. Scholars are still hard put to explain why the anci ent Near East came astir just at that time. The new (17th) d ynasty that took control of Egypt was seized with imperial ferv or, thrust- ing into Nubia in the south, Libya in the west, and the lands along the Mediterranean coast to the east.

As each nation made the claim that they went on the war- path in the name and on the orders of their nationa l god, the growing conflicts might well have represented a str uggle be- tween the gods through human surrogates. A clue tha t seems to confirm this is the fact that the theophoric nam es of Phar- aohs of the 18th dynasty dropped the prefix or suff ix Ra or Amen in favor of Thoth. The change, that began with Thoth- mes (sometimes rendered Tuthmosis) I in 1525 B.C., also marked the beginning of the oppression of the Israe lites. The reason given by the Pharaoh is enlightening: Launch ing mil- itary expeditions to Naharin, on the Upper Euphrate s, he feared that the Israelites would become an internal fifth col- umn. The reason? Naharin was the very area where Ha rran was located, and where the people were descendants of the Patriarchal relatives. As much as this explains the given reasons for the op- pression of the Israelites, it leaves unexplained w hy, and what for, did the Egyptians—now venerating Thoth—se nd armies to conquer distant Harran. It is a puzzle th at bears keeping in mind. The military expeditions on the one hand and the co ncur- rent oppression of the Israelites, peaking with the edict or- dering the killing of all Israelite newborn males, reached a climax under Thothmes III, forcing Moses to flee af ter he A Time of Prophecy 239"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":" Figure 86 had stood up for his people.

Seventeen years later, after repeated dem ands and a series of afflictions wrought by Yahweh upon \"Egy pt and its gods,\" the Israelites were let go, and the Exod us began. Two incidents mentioned in the Bible, and a major c hange in Egypt, indicate theological repercussions among other peoples as a result of the miracles and wonders att ributed to Yahweh in support of his Chosen People. \"And when Jethro, the Priest of Midian, the father- in-law of Moses, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel,\" we read in Genesis chapter 18, he came to the Israelite encampment, and after getting me f ull story from Moses, Jethro said: \"Now 1 know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods;\" and he offered sacrific es to Yah- weh.

But \"the spirit of God came upo n Bilam,\" and in a \"divine vision\" he saw mat the House of Ja cob was blessed by Yahweh, and mat His word cannot be c oun- termanded. The recognition by a non-Hebrew priest and seer of the powers and supremacy of Yahweh had an unexpected ef fect on the Egyptian royal family. In 1379 B.C.—just as the Is- raelites were entering Canaan proper—a new Pharaoh changed his name to Akhenaten—the Aten being repres ented by the Winged Disc (Fig. 86), moved his capital to a new 240 THE COSMIC CODE"},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"A Time of Prophecy 241 place, and began to worship one god. It was a short -lived experiment to which the priests of Amen-Ra put a qu ick end ... Short-lived, too, was the concept of a universa l peace that accompanied the faith in a universal God. In 1296 B .C. the Egyptian army, ever thrusting toward the Harran reg ion, was decisively defeated by the Hittites in the Battle o f Kadesh (in what is now Lebanon). As the Hittites and Egyptians exhausted each other, there was more room for the Assyrians to assert themselve s. A series of expansions virtually in all directions cu lminated in the recapture of Babylon by the Assyrian king Tukul ti- Ninurta 1—a theophoric name that indicates the reli gious al- legiance—and the seizing of Babylon's god, Marduk. What followed is typical of the polytheism of the time: Far from denigrating the god, he was brought over to the Ass yrian capital and, when the time came for the New Year ce remo- nies, it was Marduk, not Ashur, who featured in the age-old rituals. This \"unification of the churches,\" to coi n an expression, failed to stop the increasing exhaustio n among the once-imperial kingdoms; and for several ensuing centu- ries, the two erstwhile powers of Mesopotamia joine d Egypt and Hatti Land in a retraction and loss of conqueri ng zeal. It was undoubtedly that withdrawal of imperial tent acles that made possible the emergence of prosperous city -states in western Asia, especially along the Mediterranean coast, in Asia Minor, even in Arabia. Their rise, however, be came a magnet attracting migrants and invaders virtually f rom all directions. Invaders who came in ships—the \"Peoples of the Sea\" as the Egyptians called them—tried to settle i n Egypt and ended up occupying the coast of Canaan.

The period that is now called in hindsight the firs t millen- nium B.C. was actually the last millennium in the f our- thousand-year-old human story that began with the blossoming out of the Sumerian civilization. The mi dpoint in this human drama, whose story we have called The Earth Chronicles, was the nuclear holocaust, the demise o f Sumer and Akkad, and the hand-over of the Sumerian baton to Abraham and his seed. That was the watershed after the first two thousand years. Now, the next half of the story , the last two millennia of what had begun in Sumer and a stat e visit to Earth by Anu circa 3760 B.C., was also coming to an end. That, indeed, was the thread connecting the great b ib- lical prophecies at that time: The cycle is coming to a closure, what had been foretold at the Beginning of Years shall be coming true at the End of Years.

But if evil shall prevail, if inj ustice shall rule human relations, if nation shall continue to t ake sword to other nations, all shall be judged and doomed on the Day of the Lord. As the Bible itself acknowledges, it was not a mess age to a receptive audience. Surrounded by peoples who see med to know whom they worshiped, the Jews were asked to ad here to strict standards demanded by an unseen God, one whose mere image was unknown. The true prophets of Yahweh had their hands full facing \"false prophets\" who also c laimed to be delivering God's word. Sacrifices and donations to the Temple will atone all sins, the latter said; Yahweh wants not your sacrifices but that you live in justice, Isaia h said. Great calamities will befall the unrighteous, Isaiah said ; No, no— Peace is coming, the false prophets said. To be believed, the biblical Prophets resorted to m iracles— just as Moses, instructed by God, had to resort to miracles to obtain the Pharaoh's release of the Israelites, and then to convince the Israelites of Yahweh's almightiness. The Bible describes in detail the difficulties face d by the Prophet Elijah during the reign (in the northern ki ngdom. Israel) of Ahab and his Phoenician wife Jezebel, wh o brought with her the worship of the Canaanite god Ba'al. Ha ving already established his reputation by making a poor woman's flour and oil last and last, and by reviving a boy who had died, Elijah's greatest challenge was a confrontati on with the \"prophets of Ba'al\" on Mount Carmel. Who was a \"tru e prophet\" was to be determined, in front of an assem bled multitude headed by the king, by the performance of a mir- acle: A sacrifice on a pile of wood was readied, bu t no fire was lit—the fire had to come from heaven. And the p rophets of Ba'al called in the name of Ba'al from morning t ill noon, but there was no sound and no answer (1 Kings chapt er 18). Mocking them, Elijah said: Perhaps your god is asle ep—why don't you call to him much louder? And they did til l evetime, but nothing happened.

And he called the name of Yahweh, the god of Abra- ham and Isaac and Jacob; \"and a fire of Yahweh decs ended upon the sacrifice and it and the altar were burnt down.\" Convinced of Yahweh's supremacy, the people seized the prophets of Ba'al and killed them all. After Elijah was taken up to heaven in a fiery char iot, his disciple and successor Elisha also performed miracl es to es- tablish his authenticity as a true Prophet of Yahwe h. He turned water blood red, revived a dead boy, filled up empty vessels from a minute amount of oil, fed a hundred people with a bit of leftover food, and made a bar of iron float on water. How believable were such miracles then? We know fro m the Bible—the tales from the time of Joseph and the n me Exodus—as well as from Egyptian texts themselves, s uch as the Tales of the Magicians, that the royal court th ere had its fill of magicians and soothsayers. Mesopotamia had omen- priests and oracle priests, diviners and seers, and solvers of dreams. Nevertheless, when a scholarly discipline c alled Bi- ble Criticism became fashionable in the nineteenth century A . D ., such tales of miracle-making added to the insistenc e that everything in the Bible must be supported by i ndepen- dent sources to be believed.

Though this is no corrobor ation of the miracles themselves, this find—as others later on—went far to authenticate events and personalities record ed in the Bible. While the texts and artifacts discovered by archaeo logists provided corroboration, they also shed light on pro found dif- ferences between the biblical Prophets and those fo rtune- tellers of other nations.

And no sooner was the Temple of Yahweh built, than Jerusalem bega n to attract the attention of distant rulers. As a direc t consequence, its prophets, too, shifted their sights to the inte rnational arena, and embedded prophecies concerning the world at large within their prophecies regarding Judea, the split-off northern kingdom of Israel, their kings, and their peoples. It was a worldview that was amazing in its scope and u nder- standing—by Prophets who, before they were summoned by God, were mostly simple villagers. Such profound knowledge of distant lands and nation s, the names of their kings (in one instance, even a king' s nick- name), their commerce and trade routes, their armie s and makeup of fighting forces, must have amazed even th e kings of Judea at the time. Once, at least, an explanatio n was spelled out. It was Hanani the Prophet who (warning the Judean king against a treaty with the Aramaeans) ex plained to the king: Rely on the word of Yahweh, for \"it is the eyes of Yahweh that roam the whole Earth.\" In Egypt, too, a period of disunity ended when a ne w dynasty, the 22nd, reunited the country and relaunc hed the involvement in international affairs. The new dynas ty's first king, the Pharaoh Sheshonq, seized the historical f irst of be- ing the first foreign ruler of one of the then-grea t powers to forcefully enter Jerusalem and seize its treasures (without, however, damaging or defiling the Temple). The even t, oc- curring in 928 B.C., is related in 1 Kings 14 and i n 2 Chron- icles 12: it was all foretold by Yahweh to the Jude an king and his noblemen ahead of time by the Prophet Shema iah; it was also one of the instances where the biblical account has been corroborated by an outside, independent re cord— in this case by the Pharaoh himself, on the souther n walls of the temple of Amen in Karnak. Assyrian encroachments on the Jewish kingdoms, accu - rately recorded in the Bible, began with the northe rn king- dom, Israel.

But the Assyrians had their eye on Jerusalem and its te mple; and for reasons which their annals do not explain, many of their military expeditions started in the Harran area and then ex- tended westward to the Mediterranean coast. Signifi cantly, the annals of the Assyrian kings, describing their conquests and domains in the Harran area, identify by name a city called Nahor and a city called Laban—cities bearing the names of the brother and brother-in-law of Abraham. The turn of Judea and specifically Jerusalem to com e un- der Assyrian attack was not long in coming. The tas k of extending the territories and the \"command\" of the god Ashur to the House of Yahweh fell to Sennacherib, t he son of Sargon II and his successor in 704 B.C.

Hezekiah had a wat er tun- nel dug under the city's walls, diverting the plent iful waters of the Spring of Gihon to the Pool of Silo'am insid e the city. This subterranean secret water tunnel provided the besieged city with fresh water, defying the Assyrians' plans . Frustrated by the failure of the siege to subdue th e city, the Assyrian commander turned to psychological warf are. Speaking in Hebrew so that the common defenders wou ld understand, he pointed out the futility of resistan ce. None of the other nations' gods could save them; who is thi s \"Yah- weh\" and why would he do better for Jerusalem? He w as a god as fallible as the others ... Hearing all that, Hezekiah tore his clothes and put on a mourner's sackcloth, and went to the Temple of Yahw eh, and prayed to \"Yahweh the God of Israel, who abides upon the Cherubim, the sole God upon all the nations, th e maker of the Heaven and the Earth.\" Assuring him that his prayer was heard, the Prophet reiterated the divine promis e: The Assyrian king shall never enter the city: he will r eturn home in failure, and there he will be assassinated."},{"pageNumber":254,"pageContent":"252 THE COSMIC CODE That night a divine miracle happened, and the first part of the prophecy came true: And it came to pass that night, that the Angel of Yahweh went forth and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty five thousand.

So Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, departed and journeyed back and dwelt in Nineveh. 2 Kings 19:35-36 In a postscript, the Bible made sure to record that the sec- ond part of the prophecy had also come true, adding \"And Sennacherib went away, and journeyed back to Nineve h.

Then, in 1880, p laying boys discovered that about midway in the tunnel an inscr iption had been carved into the wall. The Turkish authorit ies of the time ordered that the inscribed segment of the wall be ex- cised and brought to Istanbul (the Turkish capital) . It was then ascertained that the inscription (Fig. 90), in beautiful ancient Hebrew script current at the time of the Ju dean kings, commemorated the completion of the tunnel when the tun- nelers of Hezekiah, cutting through the rock from b oth ends, met at that very spot where the inscription was fou nd.

The Assyrian attempt to bring the Babylonians to he el and in reality annex Babylon by bringing Marduk over to the Assyrian capital did not work, and within decades M arduk was returned to his honored position in Babylon. Th e texts suggest that a crucial aspect of the god's restorat ion was the need to celebrate the Akitu festival of the New Yea r, in which the Enuma elish was publicly read and the Res urrec- tion of Marduk was reenacted in a Passion Play, in Babylon and nowhere else. By the time of Tiglat-Pileser III , the king's legitimacy required his humbling himself before Mar duk un- til Marduk \"took both my hands in his\" (in the king 's words). To cement his choice of Esarhaddon as his successor , Sen- nacherib had appointed him as Babylon's viceroy (an d named himself \"King of Sumer and Akkad\"). And when he ascended the throne, Esarhaddon took the solemn oat h of office \"in the presence of the gods of Assyria: Ash ur, Sin, Shamash, Nebo, and Marduk.\" (Ishtar, though not pre sent, was invoked in later annals).

He departed and conquered Egypt.\" (Nusku, we know from Sumerian God List, was a member of Sin's en- tourage). The invasion of Egypt by Esarhaddon is a historical fact, fully making true Isaiah's prophecy. The details of the detour to Harran additionally serve to confirm the presenc e there, in 673 B.C., of the god Sin; for it was several decade s later that Sin \"became angry with the city and its people\" and was gone—to me heavens. Nowadays Harran still stands where it did in the ti me of Abraham and his family.

In the better-preserved stela, cataloged by scholar s as H 1 B, Adda-Guppi began her written testimony (in the Akka dian language) thus: I am the lady Adda-Guppi, mother of Nabuna 'id, king of Babylon, devotee of the gods Sin, Ningal, Nusku and Sadarnunna, my deities, to whose godliness I have been pious ever since my childhood. She was born, Adda-Guppi wrote, in the twentieth ye ar of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria—in the middle of the seventh century B.C. Though in her inscriptions Adda-Guppi does not state her genealogy, other sources suggest that she stemmed from a distinguished lineage.

Scholars hav e found her listing of reigns to be in accord with Assyrian and Bab- ylonian annals. Here then is the record of the first remarkable occ urrence, in Adda-Guppi's own words: It was in the sixteenth year of Nabupolassar, king of Babylon, when Sin, lord of gods, became angry with his city and his temple and went up to heaven; and the city and the people in it went to ruin.

There are quite a number of issues that call for cl arification as a result of this statement: Was Sin \"angry with the city and its people\" because they let the Assyrians in? Did he decide to leave on account of the Assyrians, or the approach- ing Umman-Manda hordes? How, by what means, did he go up to heaven—and where did he go? To another place on Earth, or away from Earth, a celestial place? The w ritings of Adda-Guppi gloss over these issues, and for the mom ent we, too, shall leave the questions hanging. What the High Priestess does state is that after th e depar- ture of Sin \"the city and the people in it went to ruin.\" Some scholars prefer to translate the word in the inscri ption as \"desolate.\" as better describing what had happened to the once-thriving metropolis, a city whom the Prophet E zekiel (27:23) listed among the great international tradin g centers of the time, specializing \"in all sorts of things, in blue clothes, and broidered work, and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar.\" Indeed, the de solation in the abandoned Harran brings to mind the opening words of the biblical Book of Lamentations about the deso late and desecrated Jerusalem: \"How solitary lies the city, once so full of people! Once great among the nations, now b ecome a widow; once queen among the provinces, now become a tributary.\" While others fled, Adda-Guppi stayed on. \"Daily, wi thout ceasing, by day and night, for months, for years,\" she went to the abandoned shrines. Mourning, she forsook the dresses of fine wool, took off her jewels, wore neither sil ver nor gold, relinquished perfumes and sweet-smelling oils . As a ghost roaming the empty shrines, \"in a torn garment I was clothed, I came and went noiselessly,\" she wrote. Then, in the abandoned sacred precinct, she discove red a robe that had once belonged to Sin. It must have be en a magnificent garment, in the manner of robes worn at the time by various deities, as depicted on monuments from M eso- potamia (see Fig. 28). To the despondent High Pries tess, the"},{"pageNumber":267,"pageContent":"The God Who Returned from Heaven 265 find seemed an omen from the god; it was as though he had suddenly given her a physical presence of himself. She could not lake her eyes off the sacred garb, daring not t o touch it except by \"taking hold of its hem.\" As if the god h imself was there to listen, she prostrated herself and ' ' in prayer and humility\" uttered the following vow: If you would return to your city, all the Black-Headed people would worship your divinity! \"Black-Headed people\" was a term used by the Sumeri - ans to describe themselves; and the employment of t he term by the High Priestess in Harran was highly unusual. Sumer, as a political-religious entity, had ceased to exis t almost 1,500 years before me time of Adda-Guppi. when the land and its capital, the city of Ur, fell victim to a d eadly nuclear cloud in 2024 B.C. Sumer, by Adda-Guppi's time, was just a hallowed memory, its erstwhile capital Or a place of crum- bling ruins, its people (the \"Black-Headed\" people) dis- persed to many lands. How then could a High Prieste ss in Harran offer to her god Sin to restore him to lords hip in distant Ur, and to make him again the god of all th e Sume- rians, wherever they had dispersed? It was a true vision of the Return of the Exiles an d a Restoration of a god in his ancient cult center wor thy of biblical prophecies. To achieve that, Adda-Guppi pr oposed her god a deal: If he would return and then use his authority and divine powers to make her son Nabuna'id the nex t im- perial king, reigning in Babylon over both the Baby lonian and Assyrian domains—Nabuna'id would restore the te mple of Sin in Ur and would reinstate the worship of Sin in all the lands where the Black-Headed people dwelt! The Moon god liked the idea. \"Sin, lord of me gods of Heaven and Earth, for my good doings looked upon me with a smile; he heard my prayers, he accepted my vow. T he wrath of his heart calmed; toward Ehulhul, the temp le of Sin in Harran, the divine residence in which his heart rejoiced,"},{"pageNumber":268,"pageContent":"266 THE COSMIC CODE he became reconciled; and he had a change of heart. \" The smiling god, Adda-Guppi wrote on in her inscrip tion, accepted the deal: Sin, lord of the gods, looked with favor upon my words.

All the lands from the border of Egypt, from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea, in his hands he entrusted. Grateful and overwhelmed, Adda-Guppi raised her han ds and \"reverently, with imploration\" thanked the god for \"pronouncing the name of Nabuna'id, calling him to king- ship.\" Then she implored the god to assure the succ ess of Nabuna'id—to persuade the other great gods to be at Nabuna'id's side as he battled the enemies, to enab le him to fulfill the vow to rebuild the Ehulhul temple and r estore Har- ran to its greatness. In a postscript added to the inscriptions when Adda -Guppi, aged 104, was on her deathbed (or recording her wor ds right after she had passed on), the text reported that bo th sides kept their bargain: \"I myself saw it fulfilled;\" Si n \"honored his word which he spoke to me,\" causing Nabuna'id t o be- come king of a new Sumer and Akkad (in SSS B.C.); a nd Nabuna'id kept the vow to restore the Ehulhul templ e in Harran, \"perfected its structure.\" He renewed the w orship of Sin and his spouse Ningal—\"all the forgotten rit es he made anew.\" And the divine couple, accompanied by t he divine emissary Nusku and his consort (?)

The mourning, which inc luded casting ashes upon the head, weeping, and self-infl icted cuts, lasted seven days. Before we rum to the inscriptions of Nabuna'id and their miracle-filled tales, one must stop to wonder how—i f what Adda-Guppi had recorded was true—she managed to com - municate with a deity that by her own statement was no longer in the temple or in the city—gone and ascend ed to heaven, in fact. The first part, that of Adda-Guppi addressing her g od, is easy: she prayed, addressing her prayers to him. Pr ayer as a way of laying before the deity one's fears and worr ies, asking for health or good fortune or long life, even seeki ng guidance for the right choices between alternatives, is stil l with us. From the time when writing began in Sumer, prayers and appeals to the gods were recorded. Indeed, prayer a s a means of communicating with one's deity probably preceded the written word and, according to the Bible, began whe n the first humans became Homo sapiens: It was when Enosh (\"Homo sapiens Man\"), the grandson of Adam and Eve, was born, \"that it was begun to call the name of Go d\" (Gen- esis 4:26). Touching the hem of the god's robe, prostrating her self, with great humility Adda-Guppi prayed to Sin. She d id so day after day, until he heard her prayers and respo nded. Now comes the more tricky part—how did Sin respond, how could his words or message reach the High Pries tess?"},{"pageNumber":270,"pageContent":"268 THE COSMIC CODE The inscription itself provides the answer: the god 's response came to her in a dream. As she passed out, perhaps in a trancelike sleep, the god appeared to her in a drea m: In the dream Sin, lord of the gods. laid his two hands on me. He spoke to me, thus: \"On account of you the gods will return to inhabit Harran. I will entrust your son, Nabuna 'id, with the divine residences in Harran. He shall rebuild the Ehulhul, shall perfect its structure; he will restore Harran and make her more perfect than it was before.\" Such a manner of communication, directed from a dei ty to a human, was far from being unusual; indeed, it was the one mostly employed. Throughout the ancient world k ings and priests, patriarchs and prophets received the d ivine word through the medium of dreams. They could be oracle dreams or omen ones, sometimes with words only heard, some times including visions. In fact, the Bible itself quotes Yahweh telling the sister and brother of Moses during the Exodus: \"If there be a prophet among you, I the Lord will m ake myself known to him in a vision and will speak to h im in a dream.\" Nabuna'id also reported divine communications recei ved by means of dreams. But his inscriptions reported m uch more: a unique event and an uncommon theophany. His two stelae (referred to by scholars as H 2 A and H 2 B) are adorned at their tops with a depiction of the king holding an unusual staff and facing the symbols of three celestial bod ies, the planetary gods that he venerated (Fig. 92).

Whether Nabuna'id (whom s ome scholars have nicknamed \"the first archaeologist\" o n ac- count of his penchant for uncovering and digging up the ruins of earlier sites) had qualified his statement just to be on the safe side, or whether he was actually famili ar, through olden tablets, with such events that had indeed tak en place far away and long ago, we do not know; but the fact is mat such events did happen. Thus, in the turbulent times that ended with the de mise of the Sumerian empire circa 2000 B.C., the god Enlil, who was away somewhere else, hurried back to Sumer when he was notified that his city, Nippur, was in danger. Acco rding to an inscription by the Sumerian king Shu-Sin, Enlil returned \"flying from horizon to horizon; from south to nort h he trav- eled; through the skies, over Earth, he hurried.\" That Return, however, was sudden, unannounced, and not part of a theophany. Some five hundred years later—still almost a thousa nd years before the return and theophany by Sin—the gr eatest theophany on record took place in the Sinai peninsu la, during the Israelite Exodus from Egypt.

That he indeed possessed such a flying vehicle—an e ssen- tial requirement for me heavenward departure and re turn re- ported in the Harran inscriptions—is attested by ma ny hymns to him. A Sumerian one, describing Sin flying over his be- loved city Ur, even referred to the god's Boat of H eaven as his \"glory\": Father Nannar, Lord of Ur Whose glory is the sacred Boat of Heaven ...

No t too far to the east of the Khabur River is another importan t tributary of the Euphrates, the River Balikh; and it is on th e shores of the Balikh that Harran has been situated for millen nia. Ezekiel found himself so far away from Jerusalem, o n the banks of a river in Upper Mesopotamia, at the edge of Hittite territory (\"Hattiland\" in cuneiform records), becau se he was one of several thousand noblemen, priests, and othe r leaders of Judea who were captured and taken into exile by Nebu- chadnezzar, the Babylonian king who overran Jerusal em in 597 B.C. Those tragic events are detailed in the second book of Kings, mainly 24:8-12. Remarkably, a Babylonian cla y tab- let (part of the series known as The Babylonian Chr onicles) recorded the very same events, with matching dates. Remarkably too, this Babylonian expedition—like the ear- lier one by Esarhaddon—was also launched from a sta rting point near Harran! The Babylonian inscription details the capture of J erusa- lem, the seizing of its king, his replacement on th e throne of Judea by another king of Nebuchadnezzar's choice, a nd the exiling—\"sending off to Babylon\"—of the captured ki ng and the land's leaders. It was thus that the priest Ezekiel found himself on the banks of the Khabur River in t he prov- ince of Harran.

But, said Yah weh to Ezekiel, the people did not mend their ways; rat her, they turned to the worship of \"alien gods.\" Therefore, s aid the Lord God, Jerusalem shall be attacked again, and th is time it shall be totally destroyed, temple and all.

In a text titled by scholars Nabuna'id and the Cler gy of Babylon (on a tablet now in the British Museum), th e priests of Marduk presented a charge sheet, a list of accus ations against Nabuna'id; they ran from civil mailers (\"la w and order are not promulgated by him\") through economic ne- glect (\"the farmers are corrupted,\" \"the trader's r oads are blocked\") and unsuccessful wars (\"the nobles are ki lled in war\") to the most serious charges: religious sacril ege— He made an image of a god which nobody had seen before in the land; He placed it in the temple, raised it upon a pedestal...

To add insult to sacrilege, the king placed this abomi nation in the Esagil temple of Marduk, and announced that the Akitu (New Year) festival, which was central to the equat ing of Marduk with the celestial Nibiru, would no longer b e cele- brated. The priests announced for all to hear that \"the pro tective deity of Nabuna'id became hostile to him,\" that \"th e former favorite of the gods was now fated to misfortune.\" And so Nabuna'id announced that he was leaving Babylon \"on an expedition to a distant region.\" He named his son B el-shar-"},{"pageNumber":281,"pageContent":"Epilogue 279 uzur (\"Bel/Marduk protects the king\"—the Belshazzar of the Book of Daniel) as regent.

Intro ducing Daniel as one of the Judean exiles taken into Babyl onian captivity, it relates how he was selected, with thr ee other friends, to serve in the court of Nebuchadnezzar an d how (as Joseph in Egypt) he was elevated to high office aft er solving the king's omen-dreams about future events.

Not one of the king's seers and wizards c ould decipher the inscription. As a last resort, Daniel— now long retired—was called in. And Daniel explained the mea ning to the Babylonian king: God has numbered the days of y our kingdom; you have been weighed and found wanting; y our kingdom will come to an end, divided between the Me des and the Persians. After that Daniel himself began to have omen-dreams and see visions of the future in which the \"Ancient of Days\" and his archangels played key roles. Baffled by thi s own dreams and visions, Daniel asked the angels for exp lanations. In each instance they turned out to be predictions of future events that went beyond the fall of Babylon, even b eyond the fulfillment of the seventy-year prophecy of the rebuilding of the Temple. The rise and fall of the Persian Emp ire was predicted, the coming of the Greeks under Alexander , the split of his domains after his death, and what foll owed. Though many modern scholars—but not Jewish sages or the Fathers of the Christian Church—take those prop hecies (only accurate in part) as hindsight, indicating a much later author (or even several authors), the central point of the dreams, visions, and omens experienced by Daniel is a pre- occupation with the question: When? When will be th e final kingdom, the only one that will survive and last?
