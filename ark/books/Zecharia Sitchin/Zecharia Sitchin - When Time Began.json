Awed as well as fascinated, Earthlings learned the Ways of Heaven: th e positions of the stars, the cycles of Moon and S un, the turning of an inclined Earth. How did it all begin, how w ill it end—and what will happen in between? Heaven and Earth meet on the horizon. For millennia Earthlings have watched the st ars of the night give way to the rays of the Sun at that meeting place, and chose as a point of reference the moment when daytime and nighttime are equal, the day of the Equinox. Man, aided by the cal- endar, has counted Earthly Time from that point on. To identify the starry heavens, the skies were divided into twelve parts, the twelve houses of the zodiac. But as the millennia rolled on, the \"fixed stars\" seemed not to be fixed at all. and the Day of the Equinox, the day of the New Year, appeared to shif t from one zodiacal house to another; and to Earthly Time was added Celestial Time— the start of a new era, a New Age. As we stand at the threshold of a New Age, when sunrise on the day of the spring equinox will occur in the zodiacal house of Aquarius rather than, as in the past 2,000 years, in the zodiacal house of Pi sces, many wonder what the change might portend: good or evil, a new beginning or an end—or no change at all? To understand the future we should examine the past; because since Mankind began to count Earthly Time, it has already experienced the meas ure of Celestial Time—the arrival of New Ages. What preceded and followed one such New Age holds great lessons fo r our own present station in the course of Time. 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1 THE CYCLES OF TIME It is said that Augustine of Hippo, the bishop in Roman Carthage ( A . D . 354-430), the greatest thin ker of the Chris- tian Church in its early centuries, who fused the religion of the New Testament with the Platonistic tradition of Greek philosophy, was asked, \"What is time?\" His answer was, \"If no one asks me, I know what it is; if I wish to explain what it is to him who asks me, I do not know.\" Time is essential to Earth a nd all that is upon it, and to each one of us as individuals ; for, as we know from our own experience and observations, what separates us from the moment we are born and the moment when we cease to live is TIME. Though we know not what Time is, we have found ways to measure it. We count our lifetimes in years, which— come to think of it—is anothe r way of saying \"orbits,\" for that is what a \"year\" on Earth is: the time it takes Earth, our planet, to complete one orbit around our star, the Sun. We do not know what time is, but the way we measure it makes us wonder: would we live longer, would our life cycle be different, were we to live on another planet whose \"year\" is longer? Would we be \"immortal\" if we were to be upon a \"Planet of millions of years\"—as, in fact, the Egyptian pharaohs believed that they would be, in an eternal Afterlife, once they joined the gods on that \"Planet of millions of years\"? Indeed, are there other planets \"out there,\" and, even more so, planets on which lif e as we know it could have evolved—or is our planetary system unique, and life on Earth unique, and we, humankind, are all alone—or did the pharaohs know what they were speaking of in their Pyramid Texts? 2"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Cycles of Time 3 \"Look up skyward and count the stars,\" Yahweh told Abraham as He made the covenant with him. Man has looked skyward from time imme morial, and has been won- dering whether there are others like him out there, upon other earths. Logic, and math ematical probability, dictate a Yes answer; but it was only in 1991 that astronomers, for the first time, it was stressed, actually found other planets orbiting other suns elsewhere in the universe. The first discovery, in July 1991, turned out not to have been entirely correct. It was an announcement by a team of British astronomers that, based on observations over a five- year period, they concluded th at a rapidly spinning star identified as Pulsar 1829-10 has a \"planet-sized compan- ion\" about ten times the size of Earth. Pulsars are assumed to be the extraordinarily dense cores of stars that have col- lapsed for one reason or another. Spinni ng madly, they emit pulses of radio energy in re gular bursts, many times per second. Such pulses can be monitored by radio telescopes; by detecting a cyclic fluctuation, the astronomers surmised that a planet that orbits Pulsar 1829-10 once every six months can cause and e xplain the fluctuation. As it turned out, the British astronomers admitted several months later that their calculations were imprecise and, therefore, they could not stand by their conclusion that the pulsar, some 30,000 light-years away, had a planetary sat- ellite. By then, however, an American team had made a similar discovery pertaining to a much closer pulsar, iden- tified as PSR 1257+ 12—a colla psed sun only 1,300 light- years away from us. It expl oded, astronome rs estimated, about a mere billion years ago; and it definitely has two, and perhaps three, orbiting planets. The two certain ones were orbiting their sun at abou t the same distance as Mercury does our Sun; the possible third planet orbits its sun at about the same distance as Earth does our Sun. \"The discovery stirred specul ation that planetary systems not only were fairly common but also could occur under diverse circumstances,\" wrot e John Noble Wilford in The New York Times of January 9, 1992; \"scientists said it was most unlikely that planets orb iting pulsars could be hospita-"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"4 WHEN TIME BEGAN ble to life; but th e findings enc ouraged astron omers, who this fall will begin a systematic survey of the heavens for signs of intelligent ex traterrestrial life.\" Were, then, the pharaohs right? Long before the pharaohs and the Pyramid Texts, an ancient civilization—Man's first known one—possessed an advanced cosmogony. Six thous and years ago, in ancient Sumer, what astronomers have discovered in the 1990s was already known; not only the tr ue nature and composition of our Solar System (including the farthest out planets), but also the notion that there ar e other solar systems in the universe, that their stars (\"s uns\") can collapse or explode, that their planets can be thrown off course—that Life, in- deed, can thus be car ried from one star system to another. It was a detailed cosmogon y, spelled out in writing. One long text, written on seve n tablets, has reached us primarily in its late r Babylonian version. Called the Epic of Creation and known by its openi ng words Enuma elish, it was publicly read during the New Year festival that started on the first day of the month Nissan, coinciding with the first day of spring. Outlining the process by whic h our own Solar System came into being, the long text described how the Sun (\"Apsu\") and its messenger Mercury (\"Mummu\") were first joined by an olden planet called Tiamat; how a pair of planets Venus and Mars—(\"Lahamu\" and \"Lahmu\") then coalesced between the Sun and Tiamat, followed by two pairs beyond Tiamat—Jupiter and Saturn (\"Kishar\" and \"Anshar\") and Uranus and Neptune (\"Anu\" and \"Nudim- mud\"), the latter two being planets unknown to modern astronomers until 1781 and 1 846 respectively—yet known, and described, by the Sumerians millennia earlier. As those newly-created \"cel estial gods\" tugged and pulled at each other, some of them sprouted satellites—moonlets. Tiamat, in the midst of that unstable planetary family, sprouted eleven satellites; one of them, \"Kingu,\" grew so much in size that it began to assume the aspects of a \"celestial god,\" a planet, on its own. Modern astronomers were totally ig- norant of the possibility that a planet coul d have many"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The Cycles of Time 5 moons until Galileo discovered the four largest moons of Jupiter in 1609, with the aid of a telescope; but the Su- merians were aware of the phenomenon millennia earlier. Into that unstable solar sy stem, according to the millen- nia-old Epic of Creation, ther e appeared an invader from outer space—another planet; a planet not born into the fam- ily of Apsu, but one that had belonged to some other star's family and that was thrust o ff to wander in space. Millennia before modern astronomy lear ned of pulsars and collapsing stars, the Sumerian cosmogony had already envisioned other planetary systems and collapsin g or exploding stars that threw off their planets. And so, Enuma elish related, one such cast-off planet, reaching th e outskirts of our own Solar System, began to be drawn into its midst (Fig. 1). As it passed by the outer planets, it caused changes that account for many of the enigmas that s till baffle modern astronomy—such as the cause for Uranus's tilt on its side, the retrograde orbit of Nept une's largest moon, Triton, or what pulled Pluto from its place as a moonlet to become a planet with an odd orbit. The more the invader was drawn into the Solar System's center, the more was it forced onto a collision course with Tiamat , resulting in the \"Celestial Battle.\" In the series of collis ions, with the invader's sat- "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"6 WHEN TIME BEGAN ellites repeatedly smashing in to Tiamat, the olden planet split in two. One half of it was smashed into bits and pieces to become the Asteroid Belt (b etween Mars and Jupiter) and various comets; the other half, wounded but intact, was thrust into a new orbit to become the planet we call Earth (\"Ki\" in Sumerian); shunted with it was Tiamat's largest satellite, to become Earth's Moon. The invader itself was caught into permanent orbit around the Sun, to become our Solar System's twelfth me mber (Sun, Moon, and ten planets). The Sumerians called it Nibiru—\"Planet of the Crossing.\" The Babylonians renamed it Marduk in honor of their national god. It was during the Celes tial Battle, the ancient epic asserted, that th e \"seed of life,\" brought by Nibiru from elsewhere, was passed to Earth. Philosophers and scientists, contemplating the universe and offering modern cosmogoni es, invariably end up dis- cussing Time. Is Time a dimension in itself, or perhaps the only true dimension in the universe? Does Time only flow forward, or can it flow backward? Is the present part of the past or the beginning of the fu ture? And, not least of all, did Time have a beginning? For, if so, will it have an end? If the universe has existed forever, without a beginning and thus without an end, is Time too without a beginning and without an end—or did the unive rse indeed have a begin- ning, perhaps with the Big Ba ng assumed by many astro- physicists, in which case Time began when the universe began? Those who conceived the amazingly accurate Sumerian cosmogony also believed in a Beginning (and thus, inex- orably, in an End). It is clea r that they conceived of Time as a measure, the pacesetter from, and the marker of, a beginning in a celestial saga; for the very first word of the ancient Epic of Creation, Enuma, means When: Enuma elish la nabu shamamu When in the heights heaven had not been named Shaplitu ammatum shuma la zakrat And below, firm ground (E arth) had not been called"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The Cycles of Time 7 It must have taken great scie ntific minds to conceive of a primordial phase when \"nau ght existed but primordial Apsu, their begetter; Mummu, and Tiamat\"—when Earth had not yet come into being; and to realize that for Earth and all upon it the \"big bang\" was not when the universe or even the Solar System was created, but the event of the Celestial Battle. It was then, at that moment, that Time began for Earth—the moment wh en, separated from the half of Tiamat that became the As teroid Belt (\"heaven\"), Earth was shunted to its own new or bit and could start counting the years, the months, the days, the nights—to measure Time. This scientific view, centr al to ancient cosmogony, re- ligion, and mathematics, was expressed in many other Su- merian texts besides the Epic of Creation. A text treated by scholars as the \"myth\" of \"Enki and the world order,\" but which is literally the autobi ographical tale by Enki, the Sumerian god of science, de scribes the moment when— When—Time began to tick for Earth: In the days of yore, when heaven was separated from Earth, In the nights of yore, when heaven was separa ted from Earth . . . Another text, in words often repeated on Sumerian clay tablets, conveyed the notion of Beginning by listing the many aspects of evolution and civilization that had not yet come into being before the crucial event. Before then, the text asserted, \"the name of Man had not yet been called\" and \"needful things had not ye t been brought into being.\" All those developments starte d to take place only \"after heaven had been moved away from Earth, after Earth had been separated from heaven.\" It is not surprising that the same notions of Time's be- ginnings also ruled Egyptian beliefs, whose development was subsequent to those of th e Sumerians. We read in the Pyramid Texts (para. 1466) th e following description of the Beginning of Things:"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"8 WHEN TIME BEGAN When heaven had not yet come into existence, When men had not yet come into existence, When gods had not yet been born, When death had not yet come into existence . . . This knowledge, universal in antiquity and stemming from the Sumerian cosmogony, was echoed in the very first verse of Genesis, the first book of the Hebrew Bible: In the beginning Elohim created the he aven and the earth. And the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of Tehom, and the wind of th e Lord swept over its waters. It is now well established that this bi blical tale of creation was based on Mesopotamian text s such as Enuma elish, with Tehom meaning Tiamat, the \"wind\" meaning \"sat- ellites,\" in Sumerian, and \"heaven,\" desc ribed as the \"hammered out bracelet,\" the Asteroid Belt. The Bible, however, is clearer regarding the moment of the Beginning as far as Earth was concerned; the biblical version picks up the Mesopotamian cosmogony only from the point of the separation of the Earth from the Shama'im, the Hammered Bracelet, as a result of the breakup of Tiamat. For Earth, Time began with the Celestial Battle. The Mesopotamian tale of cr eation begins with the for- mation of our Solar System a nd the appearance of Nibiru/ Marduk at a time when the planetary orbits were not yet fixed and stable. It ends by a ttributing to Nibiru/Marduk the current shape of our Solar System, whereby each planet (\"celestial god\") rece ived its assigned place (\"station\"), orbital path (\"destiny\"), and rotation, even its moons. In- deed, as a large planet that en compasses by its orbit all the other planets, one who \"crosses the heavens and surveys the regions,\" it was considered to have become the one that stabilized the Solar System:"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The Cycles of Time 9 He established the station of Nibiru, to determine their heavenly bands, that none might transgress or fall short. . . He established for the planets their sacred heavens, He keeps hold on their ways, determines their courses. Thus, states Enuma elish (Table t V, line 65), \"He created the Heaven and the Earth\"—the very same words used in the Book of Genesis. The Celestial Battle eliminated Tiamat as a member of the old Solar System, thrust half of it into a new orbit to become Planet Earth, retained the Moon as a vital com- ponent of the new Solar System , detached Pluto into an independent orbit, and added Nibiru as the twelfth member of the New Order in our heavens. For Earth and its inhab- itants, those were to become the elements that determined Time. To this day, the key role th at the number twelve played in Sumerian science and daily life (in line with the twelve- member Solar System) has acco mpanied us th roughout the millennia. They divided the \"day\" (from sunset to sunset) into twelve \"double-hours,\" retained into modern times in the twelve-hour clock and the twenty-four-hour day. The twelve months in the year are still with us, as are the twelve houses of the zodiac. This ce lestial number had many other expressions, as in the twelve tribes of Israel or the twelve apostles of Jesus. The Sumerian mathematical system is called sexagesimal, i.e. \"based on sixty\" rather than on 100 as in the metric system (in which one meter is equal to 100 centimeters). Among the advantages of the sexagesimal system was its divisibility into twelve. The sexagesimal system progressed by alternately multiply ing six and ten: st arting with six, multiplying six by ten (6 x 10 = 60), then by six to obtain 360—the number applied by the Su merians to the circle and still used both in geometry and astro nomy. That, in turn,"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"10 WHEN TIME BEGAN was multiplied by ten, to obtain the sar (\"ruler, lord\"), the number 3,600, which was writte n by inscribing a great circle, and so on. The sar, 3,600 Eart h-years, was the or bital period of Nibiru around the Sun; for anyone on Nibiru, it was just one Nibiru-year. According to the Sumerians, there were indeed others, intelligent bein gs, on Nibiru, evolving there well ahead of hominids on Earth. The Sumerians called them Anunnaki, literally meaning \"Those who from Heaven to Earth came.\" Sumerian texts repeatedly asserted that the Anunnaki had come to Earth from Nibiru in great antiquity; and that when they had come here, they counted time not in Earth terms but in terms of Nibiru's orbit. The unit of that Divine Time, a year of the gods, was the sar. Texts known as the Sumerian King Lists, which describe the first settlements of the An unnaki on Earth, list the gov- ernorships of the first ten Anu nnaki leaders before the Del- uge in sars, the 3,600 Earth- year cycles. From the first landing to the Deluge, according to those text s, 120 sars had passed: Nibiru orbited th e Sun one hundred and twenty times, which equals 432,000 Eart h-years. It was on the one hundred twentieth orbit that the gravitatio nal pull of Nibiru was such that it caused the i ce sheet that a ccumulated over Antarctica to slip off into th e southern oceans, creating the immense tidal wave that engulfed the Earth—the great flood or Deluge, recorded in the Bible from much earlier and much more detailed Sumerian sources. Legends and ancient lore gave this number, 432,000, cyclical significance beyond th e land then called Sumer. In Hamlet's Mill, Giorgio de Santillana and Hertha von De- chend, searching for \"a point where myth and science join,\" concluded that \"432,00 0 was a number of significance from old.\" Among the examples c ited by them was the Teutonic and Norse tale of the Valhalla, the mythic abode of the slain warriors who, on the Day of Judgment, will march out of the Valhalla's gates to fight at the side of the god Odin or Woden against the giants. They would exit through the Valhalla's 540 doors; eight hundred warriors would march out of each. The total number of warrior-heroes, Santillana"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"The Cycles of Time 11 and von Dechend pointed out , was thus 432,000. \"This number,\" they continued, \"mus t have had a very ancient meaning, for it is also the number of syllables in the Rigveda,\" the \"Sacred Book of Verses\" in the Sanskrit language, in which have been recorded the Indo-European tales of gods and heroes. Four hundred thirty-two thousand, the two authors wrote, \"goes back to the basic figure 10,800, the number of stanzas in the Rigveda, with 40 syllables to a stanza \" (10,800 x 40 = 432,000). Hindu traditions clearly associated the number 432,000 with the yugas or Ages that Earth and Mankind had expe- rienced. Each caturyuga (\"gr eat yuga\") was divided into four yugas or Ages whose dimi nishing lengths were expres- sions of 432,000: first the F ourfold Age (4 x 432,000 = 1,728,000 years) which was the Golden Age, then the Threefold Age of Know ledge (3 x 432,000 = 1,296,000 years), followed by the Double or Twofold Age of Sacrifice (2 x 432,000 = 864,000 years); and finally our present era, the Age of Discord wh ich will last a mere 432,000 years. All in all these Hindu traditions envision ten eons, paralleling the ten Sumerian rulers of the pre-Diluvial era but expanding the ov erall time span to 4,320,000 years. Further expanded, such astr onomical numbers based on 432,000 were applied in Hindu re ligion and traditions to the kalpa, the \"Day\" of the Lord Brahma. It was defined as an eon comprising twelve million devas (\"Divine Years\"). Each Divine Year in turn equaled 360 Earth- years. Therefore, a \"Day of the Lord Brahma\" equaled 4,320,000,000 Earth-years—a ti me span very much like modern estimates of the age of our Solar System—arrived at by multiplications of 360 and 12. 4,320,000,000 is, however, a thousandfold great yugas— a fact brought out in the eleventh century by the Arab math- ematician Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, who explained that the kalpa consisted of 1,000 cycles of caturyugas.

This brings to mind"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 WHEN TIME BEGAN the enigmatic statement in Psalms (90:4) regarding the Di- vine Day of the biblical Lord: A thousand years, in thy eyes, [are] as a day past, gone by. The statement has traditionally been viewed as merely symbolic of the Lord's eternit y. But in view of the numerous traces of Sumerian data in the Book of Psalms (as well as in other parts of the Hebrew Bible), a precise mathematical formula might well have been intended—a formula echoed also in Hindu traditions. The Hindu traditions were brought to the Indian subcon- tinent by \"Aryan\" migrants from the shores of the Caspian Sea, cousins of the Indo-Eur opeans who were the Hittites of Asia Minor (today's Turkey) and of the Hurrians of the upper Euphrates River, through whom Sumerian knowledge and beliefs were transmitted to the Indo-Europeans. The Aryan migrations are believed to have taken place in the second millennium B.C. and the Vedas were held to be \"not of human origin,\" having been composed by the gods them- selves in a previous age. In time the various components of the Vedas and the auxiliary literature that derived from them (the Mantras, Brahmanas, etc.) were augmented by the non-Vedic Puranas (\"Ancient Writings\") and the great epic tales of the Mahabharata and Ramayana. In them, ages deriving from multiples of 3,600 also predominate; thus, according to the Vishnu Parana, \"the day that Krishna shall depart from Earth will be the first day of the age of Kali; it will continue for 360,000 years of mortals.\" This is a reference to the concept that the Kaliyuga, the present age, is divided to a dawn or \"morning twilight\" of 100 divine years that equal 36,000 Earth or \"mortal\" years, the age itself (1,000 divine years equaling 360,000 Earth-years), and a dusk or \"evening twilight \" of a final 100 divine years {36,000 mortal-years), adding up to 1,200 divine or 432,000 Earth-years.

We have shown in The 12th Planet, the first book of Th e Earth Chronicles series, that the Deluge was a global calamity anticipated by the Anunnaki, resulting from the gr avitational pull of the near- ing Nibiru on the unstable ic e sheet over Antarctica. The event brought the last ice age to an abrupt end circa 13,000 years ago, and was thus recorded in Earth's cycles as a major geological and climatic change. Such changes, the longest being the geological epochs, have been verified through studies of the Earth's surface and oceanic sediments. The last geological epoch, called the Pleistocene, began about 2,500,000 years ago and ended at the time of the Deluge; it was the time span during which hominids evolved, the Anunna ki came to Earth, and Man, Homo sapiens, was brought in to being. And it was during the Pleistocene that a cycle of approximately 430,000 years was identified in marine sedi ments. According to a series of studies by teams of geologi sts led by Madeleine Briskin of the University of Cincinna ti, sea level changes and deep- sea climatic records show a \"430,000-year quasi-periodic cyclicity.\" Such a cyclic periodicity conforms with the As- tronomical Theory of climatic modulations that takes into account changes due to obliquity (the Earth's tilt), preces- sion (the slight orbital reta rdation), and eccentricity (the shape of the elliptical orbi t). Milutin Milankovitch, who outlined the theory in the 1920s, estimated that the resulting grand periodicity was 413,000 years. His, and the more recent Briskin cycle, almost c onform to the Sumerian cycle of 432,000 Earth-years attributed to Nibiru's effects: the convergence of orbits and pertur bations and climatic cycles. The \"myth\" of Divine Ages thus appears to be based on scientific facts.

The destruction of Tiamat and the ensuing creation of the Asteroid Belt and Earth required, according to the Mesopotamian version, two re- turn orbits of the Celestial Lord (the invading Nibiru/Mar- duk). In the biblical version, it took the Lord two divine \"days\" to complete the task; hopefully, even Fundamen- talists will by now agree that these were not day and night days as we now know them, for the two \"days\" occurred before Earth had yet come into existence (and besides, let them heed the Psalmist's stat ement of the Lo rd's day being equal to a thousand years or so). The Mesopot amian version clearly measures Creation Time or Divine Time by the pas- sages of Nibiru, in an or bit equaling 3,600 Earth-years. Before that ancient story of Creation shifts to the newly formed Earth and evolution upon it, it is a ta le of stars, planets, celestial orbits; and the Time it deals with is Divine Time. But once the focus shifts to Earth and ultimately to Man upon it, the scale of Time also shifts—to an Earthly Time—to a scale appropriate not only to Man's abode but also to one that Mankind could grasp and measure: Day, Month, Year. Even as we consider these familiar elements of Earthly Time, it should be borne in mind that all three of them are also expressions of celestial motions—cyclical motions— involving a complex correlation between Earth, Moon, and Sun. We now know that the daily sequence of light and darkness that we call a Day (of twenty-four hours) results from the fact that Earth turns on its axis, so that as it is lit by the Sun's rays on one side, the other side is in darkness. We now know that the Moon is always there, even when unseen, and that it wanes and waxes not because it disap- pears but because, dependin g on the Earth-Moon-Sun po- sitions (Fig. 2) we see the Moon fully lighted by the Sun's rays, or fully obscured by the Earth's shadow, or in phases in between. It is this threefol d relationship that extends the actual orbital period of th e Moon around the Earth from about 27.3 days (t he \"sidereal month\") to the observed cycle of about 29.53 days (t he \"synodic month\") and the"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"The Cycles of Time 15 phenomenon of the reappearing or New Moon with all its calendrical and religious impli cations.

But such basic truths regarding the causes of the Earthly Time cycles of day, month, year are not self-evident and required advanced scientific kno wledge to be realized. For the better part of two thousa nd years it was believed, for example, that the day-night cycle resulted from the circling of Earth by the Sun; for from the time of Ptolemy of Al- exandria (second century A . D .) until the \"Copernican Rev- olution\" in 1543 A . D ., the unquestioned belief was that the Sun, the Moon, and the visibl e planets were circling the Earth, which was the center of the universe.

Yet it is evident that in earli er times Sumerian knowledge included familiarity with the triple Earth-Moon-Sun rela- tionship. The Enuma elish text, describing the four phases of the Moon, clearly explained th em in terms of the position of the Moon vis-a-vis the Sun as it (the Moon) circled the Earth: a full moon at midmont h as it \"stood still opposite the Sun,\" and its waning at month's end as it \"stood against the Sun\" (see Fig. 2). These motions were attributed to the \"destinies\" (orbits) that the Celestial Lord (Nibiru) gave Earth and its moon as a resu lt of the Celestial Battle: The Moon he caused to shine, to it the night entrusting; In the night the days to signal he appointed it, [saying:] Monthly, without cease, fo rm designs with a crown. At the month's very start, rising over the Earth, thou shalt have luminous horns to signify six days, reaching a crescent on the seventh day. At mid month stand still opposite the Sun; it shall overtake thee at the horizon.

Over the millennia of Mankind's efforts to measure time by devising a calendar, some (as the Moslems continue to this day) have followed only the Moon's cycles; others (as the ancient Egyptians an d the Common Era ca lendars in use in the Western world) have adopte d the solar year, convenient- ly dividing it into \"months.\" But the cal endar devised about fifty-eight hundred years ago in Nippur (Sumer's religious center) and still adhered to by the Jews retained the biblically stated complexity of time-keeping based on the orbital re- lationship between the Earth and the two lu minaries. In doing that, the fact that the Ea rth orbits the Sun was rec- ognized by the term Shanah fo r \"year\" which stems from the Sumerian shatu, an astronomical term meaning \"to course, to orbit,\" and the full term Tekufath ha-Shanah— \"the circling or annual orbiting\" to denote the passage of a full year.

Other such translations of Arabic and Greek works on astronomy, as we ll as independent treatises, were a main channel for the st udy of astronomy in medieval Europe. In the ninth and tenth centuries Jewish astronomers composed treatises on the movements of the Moon and the planets and calculated the paths of the Sun and the positions of the constellations. In fact , the compilation of astronom- ical tables, whether for Europe an kings or Moslem caliphs, was a specialty of Jewi sh court astronomers. Such advanced knowledge, seemingly ahead of its time, can be explained only by the re tention of the earlier so- phisticated knowledge that permeates the Bible and its ear- lier Sumerian sources. Ind eed, Kabbalah literally means \"that which was received,\" earlie r secret knowledge trans- mitted from generation to generation. The knowledge of Jewish savants in the Middle Ag es can be traced directly to academies in Judea and Babylonia that commented upon and retained biblical data. Th e Talmud, recording such data and commentaries from about 300 B.C. to about a.d. 500, is replete with astronomical sn ippets; they include the state- ment that Rabbi Samuel \"knew the paths of heaven\" as if they were the streets of his town, and the reference by Rabbi Joshua ben-Zakai to \"a star which appears once in seventy years and confounds the mariners\"—familiarity with Hal- ley's Comet whose periodic retu rn every seventy-five years or so was assumed to have been unknown until discovered by Edmund Halley in the eighteenth century. Rabbi Gamliel of Jabneh possessed a tubular op tical instrument with which he observed the stars and plan ets—fifteen centuries before the \"official\" inventi on of the telescope. The need to know the heavenly secrets stemmed from the lunar-solar nature of the Jewi sh (i.e. Nippur ian) calendar, which required a complex adjustment—\"intercalation\"— between the solar year and the lunar year, the latter falling short of the former by 10 days, 21 hours. 6 minutes and about 45.5 seconds.

Scholars have been puzzled by the fact that in the Sumerian-Mesopotamian pant heon, Shamash (the \"Sun god\") was depicted as the so n of the \"Moon god\" Sin, and thus of a lesser hierarchic al standing, rather than the expected reverse order. The explanation may lie in the origins of the calendar, wherein the notation of the cycles of the Moon preceded the meas urement of the solar cycle. Alexander Marshack, in The R oots of Civilization, sug- gested that markings on bone and stone tools from Nean- derthal times were not decorations but primitive lunar calendars. In the purely lunar calendars, as is still the case in the Moslem calendar, the holidays keep slipping back by about a month every three years. Th e Nippurian calendar, having been devised to maintain a cy cle of holidays connected with the seasons, could not allow such an ongoing slippage: the New Year, for example, had to begin on the first day of spring. This required, from th e very beginning of Sumerian civilization, a precise knowledge of the mo tions of the Earth and the Moon, and their correlation with the Sun, and thus the secrets of intercalation. It also required understanding how the seasons come about. Nowadays we know that the annual movement of the Sun from north to south and back, causing the seasons, results from the fact that the Earth's ax is is tilted relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun; this \"obliquity\" is at present about 23.5 degrees. The farthest points reached by the Sun north and south, where it seems to hesitate, then turn back, are called solstices (literally, \"Sun standstills\"), occurring on June 21 and December 22. The discovery of the solstices has also been attr ibuted to Meton and his col- league, the Athenian astronom er Euctemon. But, in fact, such knowledge goes back to much earlier times.

Using the term Natoh, the Book of Job refers to the Earth's tilted axis and the North Pole when it states (26:7) He tilted north over the void and hangeth the Earth upon nothing at all. Psalms 74:16-17 recognized not only the correlation be- tween the Earth, Moon, and Su n, and the Earth's rotation about its axis as the cause of day, night, and the seasons, but also recognized the outermost points, the \"limits\" of the Sun's apparent seasonal movements, that we call solstices: Thine is the day and thine also is the night; the Moon and Sun thou didst ordain. All the Earth's limits thou hast set, summer and winter didst create. If a line is drawn between th e sunrise and s unset points for each solstice, the result is such that the two lines cross above the viewer's head, formin g a giant X that divides the Earth, and the skies above it, into four parts. This division has been recognized in antiquit y and is referred to in the Bible when it speaks of the \"fou r corners of the Earth\" and the \"four corners of the skie s.\" The resulting division of the circle of the Earth and the skies into four parts that look like triangles rounded at their bases created for the ancient peoples the image of \"wings.\" The Bible thus spoke of the \"four wings of the Earth\" as well as of the \"four wings of the skies.\" A Babylonian map of the Eart h, from the first millennium B.C., illustrated this concept of four \"corners of the Earth\""},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 WHEN TIME BEGAN by literally depicting four \"wings \" attached to the circular Earth (Fig. 4). The Sun's apparent movement from north to south and back resulted not only in th e two clearly opposite seasons of summer and winter, but also the interim seasons of au- tumn and spring. The latter were associated with the equi- noxes, when the Sun passed over the Earth's equator (once going, once coming back)—times at which daylight and nighttime are equal. In ancien t Mesopotamia, the New Year began on the day of the spring equinox—the first day of the First Month (Nisannu—Month \"when the sign is given\"). Even when, at the time of th e Exodus, the Bible (Leviticus chapter 23) decreed that the Ne w Year be celebrated on the day of the autumnal equinox, th at designated month (Tish- rei) was called \"the seventh month,\" recognizing that Ni- sannu has been the first month. In either case, the knowledge of the equinoxes, attested to by the New Year days, clearly extends back to Sumerian times. The fourfold division of the so lar year (two solstices, two equinoxes) was combined in antiquity with the lunar motions to create the first known formal calendar, the lunar-solar calendar of Nippur.

From its Mesopotamian roots the Hebrew language re- tains the term Maza l as meaning \"luck, fortune\" which could be either good or bad. Little is it realized that the term is a celestial one, meaning zodiac house, and harkens back to the time when astronomy and astrology were one and the same, and priests atop temple-towers followed the movements of the Celestial Gods to see in which house of the zodiac—in which Manzalu, in Akkadian—they stood that night. But it was not Man who had first grouped the myriads of stars into recogn izable conste llations, defined and named those that spanned the ecliptic, and divided them into twelve to create the twelve houses of the zodiac.

For someone arriving from Nibi ru with its vast orbital \"year\" on a fast orbiting planet (Earth, the \"seventh planet\" as the Anunnaki had called it) whose year is but one part of 3,600 of theirs, time-keeping had to pose a great problem. It is evident from the Sumerian King Lists and other texts dealing with the a ffairs of the Anunnaki that for a long time—certainly until th e Deluge—they retained the sar, the 3,600 Earth-years of Ni biru, as the divine unit of time. But what could they do somehow to create a reason- able relationship, other than 1:3600, between that Divine Time and the Earthly Time?"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 WHEN TIME BEGAN The solution was provided by the phenomenon called precession. Because of its wobble, the Earth's orbit around the Sun is slightly retarded each year; the retardation or precession amounts to 1° in seventy-tw o years. Devising the division of the ecliptic (the plane of planetary orbits around the Sun) into twelve—to conform to the twelve- member composition of the Solar System—the Anunnaki invented the twelve houses of the zodiac; that allotted to each zodiac house 30°, in cons equence of which the retar- dation per house added up to 2,160 years (72 x 30 = 2,160) and the complete Precessional Cycle or \"Great Year\" to 25,920 years (2,160 x 12 = 25,920). In Genesis Revisited we have suggested that by relating 2,160 to 3,600 the Anunnaki arrived at the Gold en Ratio of 6:10 and, more importantly, at the sexagesimal system of mathematics which multiplied 6 by 10 by 6 by 10 an d so on and on. \"By a miracle that I have found no one to interpret,\" the mythologist Joseph Campbell wrote in The Masks of God: Oriental Mythology (1962) , \"the arithmetic that was developed in Sumer as early as c. 3200 B.C., whether by coincidence or by intuitive i nduction, so matched the ce- lestial order as to amount in itself to a revelation.\" The \"miracle,\" as we have sinc e shown, was provided by the advanced knowledge of the Anunnaki. Modern astronomy, as well as modern exact sciences, owes much to the Sumerian \"firsts.\" Among them the di- vision of the skies about us and all other ci rcles into 360 portions (\"degrees\") is the most basic. Hugo Winckler, who with but a few others co mbined, at the turn of the century, mastery of \"Assyriolo gy\" with knowledge of as- tronomy, realized that the num ber 72 was fundamental as a link between \"Heaven, Calendar and Myth\" (Altorien- talische Forschungen). It was so through the Hameshtu, the \"fiver\" or \"times five,\" he wrote, creating the fundamental number 360 by multiplying the ce lestial 72 (the precessional shift of 1°) by the human 5 of an Earthling's hand.

H.V. Hilprecht (The Babylonian Expe dition of the University of Pennsylvania), who studied thou sands of mathematical tab- lets from the library of the As syrian king Ashurbanipal in Nineveh, concluded that the number 12,960,000 was lit- erally astronomical, stemming from an enigmatic Great Cycle of 500 Great Years of complete precessional shifts (500 x 25,920 = 12,960,000). He , and others, had no doubt that the phenomenon of precession, presumably first mentioned by the Greek Hipparc hus in the second century B.C., was already known and followed in Sumerian times. The number, reduced by ten to 1,296,000, it will be re- called, appears in Hindu tradition as the length of the Age of Knowledge as a threefold multiple of the cycle of 432,000 years. The cycles-within-cycles, interplaying 6 and 12 (the 72 years of a 1° zodiacal shift) , 6 and 10 (the ratio of 2,160 and 3,600) and 432,000 to 12,960,000, may thus reflect small and great cosmic and astronomical cycles—secrets yet to be unveiled, of which Sumerian numbers offer just a glimpse. The selection of the vernal equinox day (or conversely, the autumnal equinox day) as the moment to begin the New Year was not accidental, for b ecause of the Earth's tilt, it is just on these two days th at the Sun rises at the points where the celestial equator and th e ecliptic circle intersect. Because of precession—the full term is Precession of the Equinoxes—the zodiacal house in which this intersection occurs keeps shifting back, a ppearing in a preceding 1° in the zodiacal band every seventy-two years. Although this point is still being referred to as the First Point of Aries, in fact we have been in the \"Age\" (or zodiac) of Pisces since about 60 B.C., and slowly but su rely we will soon enter the Age of Aquarius (Fig. 5).

Does Time only flow forward or can it also flow back- ward, philosophers have wondere d. In fact, Time does shift backward, for that is the essence of the phenomenon of precession: the retardation in Earth's orbit around the Sun that causes, once in about 2,16 0 years, the observance of sunrise on the spring equinox not in the next zodiacal house but in the preceding one. . .Celestial Time, as we have designated it. does not progress in the direction of Earthly (and all Planetary) Time, count erclockwise; rather, it moves in the opposite direction, matc hing the orbita l (clockwise) direction of Nibiru.

All the way south in pre-Columbian Peru, the Andean peoples also spoke of five \"Suns\" or ages. The first one was the age of the Viracochas, white and bearded gods; the second was the Age of the Giants, followed by the Age of Primitive Man. The fourth was the Age of Heroes; and then came the fifth or contemporary age, the Age of Kings, of which the Inca kings were last in line. The durations of these ages were measured in thousands rather than in tens or hundreds of thousands of years. Mayan monuments and tombs were decorated with \"sky bands\" whose glyphs have been found to represent the zodiacal division of the heavens; artifacts found in Mayan ruins and in the Inca capital Cuzco have been identified as zodiacal calendars. The city of Cuzco itself, it appears, was (in the words of S. Hagar in a paper delivered at the 14th Congress of Americanists) \"a testi- monial in stone\" to the Sout h American familiarity with the twelve-house zodiac. The una voidable conclusion is that knowledge of the zodiacal divisi on of the ecliptic was some- how known in the New World millennia ago, and that the Ages were measured in the 2,160-year units of Celestial Time.

The remains pose an enigma that has titillated the curiosity and imagination of generations, challenging historians, archaeologists, and astronomers.

It has been described—at least by its British relators—as unique, for \"there is nothing else like it anywhere in the world\" (R.J.C. Atkinson, Stone- henge and Neighbouring Monuments ); and that may explain why an eighteenth-century manuscript listed more than six hundred works on Stonehenge in its catalogue of ancient monuments in Western Europe . Stonehenge is indeed the largest and most elaborate of more than nine hundred ancient stone, wood, and earthen circles in the British Isles, as well as the largest and most co mplicated one in Europe. Yet, in our view, it is no t only what makes Stonehenge unique that is its most importa nt aspect. It is also what reveals its similarity to certain monuments elsewhere, and its purpose at the specific time of its construction, that make it part of the tale we have called The Earth Chronicles. It is within such a wider framework, we believe, that one can offer a plausible solution to its enigma. Even those who have not vi sited Stonehenge must have seen, in print or on the screen, the most striking features of this ancient complex: the pairs of huge upright stone blocks, each about thirteen fe et high, connected at the top by an equally massive lintel ston e to form freestanding Tril- ithons; and these, erected in a semicircle, surrounded in turn by a massive circle of similar giant stones connected at the top by lintels that were carefully carved to form a continuous ring around the paired uprights.

In spite of considerable restoration work, much of the structure's past glory is either gone or fallen.

As if to emphasize the importance of the circular shape already evident, the rings of stones are in turn centered within a large framing circle. It is a deep and wide ditch whose excavated soil was used to raise its banks; it forms a perfect encompassing ring around the whole Stonehenge complex, a ring with a diameter in excess of three hundred feet. Approximately half the circuit of the ditch was ex- cavated earlier this century and then partly refilled; the other portions of the ditch and its ra ised banks bear the marks of being weathered down by nature and man over the millennia. These circles within circles have been repeated in yet other ways. A few feet away from the inner bank of the ditch there exists a circle made up of fifty-six pits, deep and perfectly dug into the ground, called the Aubrey Holes after their seventeenth-century di scoverer, John Aubrey. Ar- chaeologists have excavated these holes for whatever clues the accumulation of debris might disclose about the site and its builders, and have thereaft er plugged up the holes with white cement discs; the result is that the perfect circle that these holes form stands out—especially from the air.

That the axis was deliberately oriented is suggest ed by a series of holes in- dicating that the marker ston es had once been placed along this axis. One of them, called the Heel Stone, still stands as a mute witness to the builder s' intentions and the site's purpose; it was undoubtedly astronomical. The idea that Stonehenge was a carefully planned astro- nomical observatory rather than a heathen cult or occult site (a notion expressed, for exampl e, by calling a fallen stone \"Slaughter Stone,\" implying hu man sacrifices), was not easily accepted. In fact, the difficulty grew rather than di- minished the more the site was investigated and its date of construction kept shifting backward. A twelfth-century account (H istoria regum Britanniae by Geoffrey of Monmouth) related that the \"Giants' Ring\" was \"a stone cluster which no man of the period could ever erect and was first built in Ireland from stones brought by the giants from Africa.\" It was then on the advice of the sorcerer Merlin (whom Arthurian legends also connected with the Holy Grail) that th e King of Vortigen moved the stones and \"re-erected them in a circle round a sepulchre, in exactly the same way as they had been arranged on Mount Killaraus\" in Ireland. (That this medieval legend had a factual core was given confirmation by the modem discovery that the bluestones originated from the Prescelly Mountains in southwestern Wales and were somehow transported by land and water over a distance of two hundred fifty miles— first to a site some twelve miles northwest of Stonehenge, where they might have been erected in an earlier circle, and then on to Stonehenge proper).

Of these vari ous theories, the one concern- ing the Druids gained the most favor at the time, not least of all because of the research and writings of William Stuke- ley, especially his 1740 work Stonehenge, A Temple Re- stor'd To The British Druids. The Druids were the learned class or sect of teacher-pri ests among the ancient Celts. According to Julius Caesar, who is the prime source of information regarding the Druids, they assembled once a year at a sacred place for secr et rites; they offered human sacrifices; and among the subjec ts they taught the Celt no- blemen were \"the powers of the gods,\" the sciences of nature, and astronomy. While nothing that has been un- covered by archaeologists at the site reveals any connection with pre-Christian era Druids, the Celts had arrived in the area by that time and there is no proof the other way either, namely that the Druids did not gather at this \"Sun Temple\" even if they had nothing to do w ith its much earlier builders. Although Roman legions encamped near the site, no evi- dence was found to connect Stonehenge with the Romans. A Greek and Phoenician conn ection, however, shows more promise. The Greek historian Di odorus Siculus (first century B.C.)—a contemporary of Julius Caesar—who had traveled to Egypt, wrote a multivolume history of the ancient world. In the first volumes he dealt with the prehistory of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Ethiopian s, and Greeks, the so-called \"mythic times.\" Drawing on the writings of earlier histo- rians, he quotes from a (by now lost) book by Hecataeus of Abdera in which the latte r had stated, circa 300 B.C., that on an island inhabited by the Hyperboreans \"there is a magnificent sacred precinct of Apollo and a notable temple which is spherical in shape.\" The name in Greek signified a people from the distant nor th, whence the north wind (\"Boreas\") comes.

These man-made ancient remains include the great Avebury Circle, wh ich schematically drawn re- sembles the works of a modern watch (Fig. 9a, as sketched by William Stukeley) or even the meshing wheels of the ancient Mayan calendar (Fig. 9b). They also include the miles-long trench called th e Cursus; a kind of wooden- pegged rather than stone-made circle called Woodhenge; and the outstanding Silbury Hill—an artificial conical hill Figures 9a and 9b"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"36 WHEN TIME BEGAN which is precisely circular and 520 feet in diameter, the largest of its kind in Europe (some see significance in the fact that it is situated an exact six purported \"megalithic miles\" from Stonehenge). The most important finds, archaeologically speaking, have been made in this area (as often elsewher e) in tombs, which are scattered all over th e Stonehenge area. In them archaeologists have found bronze daggers, axes and maces, golden ornaments, decorated pottery, and polished stones. Many of those finds reinforced archaeological opinion that the manner in which stones at Stonehenge were smoothly dressed and carefully shaped indicated \"influences\" from Minoan Crete (the Mediterranean island) and Mycenaean (mainland) Greece. It was also noted that some of the peg- into-socket joints used at Ston ehenge to hold together stone blocks were similar to the joints used in the stone gateways of Mycenae. All this, many archaeologists held, pointed to a connection with ancient Greece. A leading representative of th is school has been Jacquetta Hawkes, who in her book. Dawn of the Gods, about the Minoan and Mycenaean origins of Greek civilization, could not help devoting a good porti on of the chapter on \"Graves and Kingdoms\" to Stonehenge. Mycenae is situated in the southwestern part of mainland Greece that is called the Peloponnesus (and now separated from the rest of Greece by a man-made Corinth Canal) and acted as a bridge between th e earlier Minoan civilization on the island of Crete and the la ter classical Greek one. It flowered in the sixteenth century B.C. and the treasures uncovered in the tombs of its kings revealed foreign contacts that undoubtedly included Britai n. \"At just this time when Mycenaean kings were rising to a new wealth and power,\" Jacquetta Hawkes wrote, \"a rather similar advance, al- though on a smaller scale, was taking place in southern England. There too a warrior aristocracy was ruling over peasants and herders and beginni ng to trade and to prosper— and to be buried with approp riate extravagance. Among the possessions so buried were a few objects that prove these chieftains to have had contacts with the Mycenaean world.''"},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"A Computer Made of Stone 37 Such things, she added, were not of great moment and could just be the fruits of trade or imitation, were it not for \"the unique event—the building of th e great sarsen-stonc circle and trilithons of Stonehenge.\" Not all archaeological finds, however, showed such early Greek \"influences.\" The finds in tombs around Stonehenge included, for example, decorated beads and amber disks bound with gold in a method developed in Egypt and not at all in Greece. Such finds raised the possibility that all those artifacts were someho w imported to southeast En- gland, neither by Greeks nor Egyp tians but perhaps by trad- ing people from the eastern Mediterranean. The obvious candidates were the Phoenician s, the renowned sailors-cum- traders of antiquity. It is a recorded fact that the Phoenicians, sailing from their Mediterranean ports, reached Cornwall in the south- west corner of England, quite close to Stonehenge, in the search for tin, with which ha rdened bronze was made from soft copper. But were any of these peoples, whose trade links flourished in the millennium between 1500 B.C. and 500 B.C., responsible for the planning and construction of Stonehenge? Did they even vis it it? A partial answer would depend, of course, on when St onehenge itself was conceived and built, or who else was there to build it. In the absence of written records or carved images of the Mediterranean gods (artifacts found elsewhere among Mi- noan, Mycenaean, and Phoenician ruins) no one can answer the question with any certainty. But the question itself be- came moot when various remains of organic origin, such as carved antlers, were dug up by archaeologists at Stone- henge. Subjected to radiocar bon dating, remains found in the Ditch produced a date of between 2900 to 2600 B.C.— at least a thousand years and probably much more before the sailors from the Mediterranean may have arrived. A charcoal piece found in one of the Aubrey Holes provided a carbon date of 2200 B.C.; an antler pick found near one of the trilithons gave a r eading of between 2280 and 2060 b.c; radiocarbon datings of finds in the Avenue gave dates between 2245 and 2085 b.c."},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"38 WHEN TIME BEGAN Who was there at such an early time to plan and execute the marvelous stone complex? Scholars hold that until about 3000 B.C. the area was sparse ly populated by small groups of early farmers and herders who used stone for their tools. Some time after 2500 B.C. new groups arrived from the European continent; they br ought with them knowledge of metals (copper and gold), used clay utensils, and buried their dead in round mounds; they have been nicknamed the Beaker People, after the shape of their drinking vessels. At about 2000 B.C. bronze made its appearance in the area and a wealthier and more numerous population, known as the Wessex People, engaged in cat tle ranching, metal crafts, and trade with western and central Europe and the Medi- terranean. By 1500 B.C. this er a of prosperity suffered an abrupt decline that lasted the better part of a millennium; and Stonehenge must have sh ared in this decline. Were the Neolithic farmers and herders, the Beaker Peo- ple, or even the Early Bron ze Age Wessex People, capable of creating Stonehenge? Or did they just provide the labor and the manpower to construct a complex mechanism in stone devised by advanced scie ntific knowledge of others? Even an outspoken proponent of the Mycenaean connec- tion, Jacquetta Hawkes, had to admit that Stonehenge,' 'this sanctuary, constructed from colossal yet carefully-shaped blocks that make the cyclope an masonry of Mycenae look like children's bricks, has nothing to compare with it in all prehistoric Europe.\" To allow for the Mycenaean connec- tion and to link it with the ear ly Englanders, she proceeded to offer the theory that \"som e of the local lords controlling the pastures of Salisbury plai n, and perhaps, like Odysseus, owning twelve herds of cattle, may have had the wealth and authority needed to turn what had been a modest sanctuary of Stone Age origin into a noble and unparalleled work of megalithic architecture.

The answer must depend on an ac- curate dating of Stonehenge; and if, as scientific data sug- gests, it is a thousand to tw o thousand years older than the Mycenaeans and the Phoenicians, then an earlier source of the \"civilized trad ition\" must be sought. If Stonehenge belongs to the third millennium B.C., then the only candi- dates are those of Sumer a nd Egypt. When Stonehenge was first conceived, the Sumerian civilization, with its cities, high-rise temples-cum-observatori es, writing, and scientific knowledge, was already a thous and years old, and kingship had already flourished in Egypt for many centuries. For a better answer, we have to put together the knowl- edge accumulated by now regarding the several phases by which Stonehenge, according to the latest research, came to be. Stonehenge began with hardly any stones. It began, all are agreed, with the Ditch and its embankment, a great earthen circle with a circumfe rence of 1,050 feet at its bot- tom; it is about twelve feet wide and up to six feet deep, and thus required digging up a considerable quantity of soil (chalky earth) and arranging it to form the two raised banks. Within this outer ring the circle of 56 Aubrey Holes was made. The northeastern section of th e earthen ring was left un- dug, to provide an entranceway in to the midst of the circle. There, two \"gateway stones,\" now missing, flanked this entry to the enclosure; they also served as focusing aides for the Heel Stone, which was erected on the resultant axis. This massive natural boulder st ands sixteen feet above the ground and cuts four feet into the earth; it ha s been set up inclined at an angle of 24°. A series of holes at the entrance gap may have been intended to hold movable wooden mark- ers, and are thus called Post Holes. Finally, the four rounded Station Stones were positioned to form a perfect rectangle;"},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"40 WHEN TIME BEGAN and this completed Stonehenge I—the earthen ring, the Au- brey Holes, an entranceway axis, seven stones, and some wooden pegs. Organic remains and stone tools associated with this phase suggest to scholars that Stone henge I was constructed some- time between 2900 and 2600 B.C.; the date selected by the British authorities is 2800 b.c. Whoever constructed Stonehenge I, and for whatever pur- pose, found it satisfactory for several centuries. Throughout the occupation of the area by the Beaker People, no need to change or improve the arrangement of earthwork and stones was indicated. Then, at about 2100 B.C., just before the arrival of the Wessex People (or perhaps coinciding with it) a spate of extraordinary activity burst upon the scene. The main event was the introduction of the bluestones into the makeup of Stonehenge, making Stonehenge II a stone \"henge\" for the first time. It was no mean feat to haul the bluestones, weighing up to four tons each, across land and over sea and river for a total distance of some two hundred fifty miles. To this day it is not known why these part icular dolerite stones were chosen and why such a great e ffort was made to bring them to the site, directly or with a short interval at a temporary way station. Whatever the prec ise route was, it is believed that in the end they were brought to the site's proximity up the River Avon, which explains why the Avenue was ex- tended by some two miles at th is phase to connect Stone- henge with the river. At least eighty (some estim ate eighty-two) bluestones were brought over. It is believ ed that seventy-six of them were intended for the holes th at made up the two concentric Q and R holes, thirty-eight per circle; the circles appear to have had openings on their west-facing sides. At the same time a separate larger stone, the so-called Altar Stone, was erected within the circles exactly on the Stonehenge axis, facing the Heel Stone to the northeast. But as the researchers checked the alignment and the po- sition of the outer stones, they discovered to their surprise that the Heel Stone was shifted in this Phase II somewhat"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"A Computer Made of Stone 41 eastward (to the right, as one looks from the enclosure's center); simultaneously, two othe r stones were erected in a row in front of the Heel Stone , so as to emphasize the new line of sight. To accommodate these changes, the entrance to the enclosure was widened on its right (eastern side) by filling up part of the Ditch, and the Avenue too was widened there. Unexpectedly the researchers realized that the main in- novation of Stonehenge II was not the introduction of the bluestones, but the introduction of a new axis, an axis some- what more to the east than the previous one. Unlike the seven or so centuries of dormancy for Stone- henge I, Stonehenge III followed Phase II within decades. Whoever was in charge decided to give the complex a mon- umental scope and permanence. It was then that the huge sarsen stones, weighing forty to fifty tons each, were hauled to Stonehenge from Marlboro Downs, some twenty miles away. It is generally assumed that seventy-seven stones were brought. As laborious as the transpor ting of these boulders with an aggregate weight of thousands of tons was, even more daunting must have been the task of setting them up. The stones were carefully dressed to the desired shapes. The lintels were given a precise curvature, given (somehow) protruding pegs exactly where th ey had to fit into carved- out sockets where stone joined stone; and then all those prepared stones had to be erecte d in a precise circle or in pairs, and the holding lintels haul ed up to be placed on top. How the task, made more diffi cult by the site's slope, was achieved, no one really knows. At this time the realigned axis was also given permanence by the erection of two new ma ssive Gateway Stones, re- placing the earlier ones. It is be lieved that the fallen Slaugh- ter Stone could have been one of the two new Gateway Stones. In order to make room for the Sarsen Circle and the Trilithon Horseshoe or oval, the two circles of bluestones from Phase II had to be completely dismantled. Nineteen of them were used to form the inner Bluestone Horseshoe"},{"pageNumber":44,"pageContent":"42 WHEN TIME BEGAN (now recognized as an open-ended oval) and fifty-nine, it is believed, were intended to be placed in two new circles of holes (Y and Z), surrounding the Sarsen Circle. The Y circle was meant to hold thirty stones and the Z circle twenty-nine. Some of the other stones of the original eighty- two may have been intended to serve as lintels or (as John E. Wood, Sun, Moon and Standing Stones, believes) to complete the oval. The Y and Z circles, however, were never erected; instead the blue stones were arranged in one large circle, the Bluestone Circle, with an undetermined number of stones (some believe sixty). Also uncertain is the time when this circle was erected—right away, or a century or two later. Some al so think that additional work, mainly on the Avenue, was done about 1100 B.C. But for all intents and purposes, the Stonehenge we see was planned in 2100 B.C., executed during the following century, and given its final t ouches circa 1900 B.C. Modern scientific research methods have thus co rroborated the find- ings—astounding at the time, 1880—of the renowned Egyp- tologist Sir Flinders Petrie, that Stonehenge dated to circa 2000 B.C. (It was Petrie who de vised the stones' numbering system still in use). In the usual course of scientif ic studies of ancient sites, archaeologists are the first to be on the scene, and others— anthropologists, metallurgists , historians, linguists, and other experts—follow. In the case of Stonehenge, astron- omers led the way. This was not only because the ruins were visible above the surface and required no excavation to reveal them, but also because from the very beginning it seemed almost self-evident that the axis line from the center toward the Heel Stone through the Avenue pointed \"to the northeast, whereabouts the Sun rises when the days are longest\" (to use the words of William Stukeley, 1740)— toward the point in the sky wh ere the Sun rises at the summer solstice (about June 21). Stone henge was an instrument to measure the passage of time! After two and a half centuries of scientific progress, this conclusion is still valid. All ar e agreed that Stonehenge was not a place of residence; nor was it a burial place. Neither"},{"pageNumber":45,"pageContent":"A Computer Made of Stone 43 palace nor tomb, it was in essence a temple-cum- observatory, as the ziggurats (step-pyramids) of Mesopo- tamia and ancient America were. And being oriented toward the Sun when it rises in midsummer, it could be called a Temple of the Sun. With this basic fact undisput able, it is no wonder that astronomers continue to lead the research concerning Stone- henge. Prominent among them, at the very beginning of this century, was Sir Norman Lockyer, who conducted a comprehensive survey of Stonehenge in 1901 and confirmed the summer solstice orientati on in his master work Stone- henge and Other British Stone Monuments. Since this ori- entation is satisfied by the axis alone, subsequent researchers began in time to wonder whether the additional complexity of Stonehenge—the diverse circ les, ovals, rectangle, mark- ers—might signify that othe r celestial phenomena besides sunrise at summer solstice and other time cycles have been observed at Stonehenge. There have been suggestions to that effect in earlier trea- tises on Stonehenge. But it wa s only in 1963, when Cecil A. Newham discovered alignments that suggested that equi- noxes too could have been observed and even predicted at Stonehenge, that these possibiliti es were given modern sci- entific credence. His most sensational suggestion, however (first in articles and then in his 1964 book The Enigma of Stonehenge), was that Stonehenge must have also been a lunar observatory. He based this conclusion on examination of the four Station Stones and the rectangle that th ey form (Fig. 10); he also showed that whoever had inte nded to give Stonehenge this capability knew where to erect it, for the rectangle and its alignments had to be sited exactly where Stonehenge is. All this was at first received with extreme doubt and disdain, because lunar observati ons are considerably more complex than solar ones. The Moon's motions (around the Earth and together with the Earth around the Sun) are not repeated on an annual basis, because, among other reasons, the Moon orbits the Earth at a s light inclination to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. The complete cycle, which is repeated"},{"pageNumber":46,"pageContent":"44 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 10 only once in about nineteen years, includes eight points of \"Moon Standstill\" as the astrono mers call them, four major and four minor. The suggestio n that Stonehenge I—which already possessed the alignmen ts highlighted by Newham— was built to enable the dete rmination, or even prediction, of these eight points seemed preposterous in view of the fact that Britain's inhabitants at the time were just emerging from the Stone Age. This is clearly a valid argument; and those who have nevertheless found more evidence for the astronomical marvels at Stonehe nge are yet to provide an answer to the paradox of a co mplex lunar observatory amidst Stone Age people! Prominent among the astronom ers whose investigations confirmed the incredible cap abilities of Stonehenge was Gerald S. Hawkins of Boston University. Writing in pres- tigious scientific journals in 1963, 1964, and 1965, he an- nounced his far-reaching conclusions by entitling his studies \"Stonehenge Decoded,\" \"Stonehenge: A Neolithic Com- puter,\" and \"Sun, Moon, Men and Stones,\" followed by his books Stonehenge Decoded and Beyond Stonehenge."},{"pageNumber":47,"pageContent":"A Computer Made of Stone 45 With the aid of the university's computers he analyzed hundreds of sight lines at Stone henge and related them to the positions of th e Sun, Moon, and major stars as they were in ancient times, and deci ded that the resulting ori- entations could not have been just accidental. He attached great significance to the four Station Stones and the perfect rectangle they form and showed how the lines connecting opposite stones (91 with 94 and 92 with 93) were oriented to the points of major standstills and those connecting the stones diagonal ly to the points of minor standstills of the Moon at mo onrise and moonset. Together with the four points of the Sun's movements, Stonehenge, according to Hawkins, enables observation and prediction of all the twelve points marking the Sun's and the Moon's movements. Above all he was fascinated by the number 19 expressed by stones and holes in the various circles: the two circles of 38 bluestones of St onehenge II \"can be regarded as two semi-circles of 19\" (Stonehenge Decoded) and the oval \"horseshoe\" of Stonehenge III had the exact 19. This was an unmistakable lunar relationship, for 19 was the Moon's cycle which governs intercalation. Professor Hawkins went even farther: he concluded that the numbers expressed by stones and holes in the various circles bespoke an ability to predict eclipses. Because the Moon's orbit is not exactly in the same plane as the Earth's orbit around the Sun (the former is inclined to the latter by just over 5°), the Moon's orbit crosses the path of the Earth around the Sun at two points each year. The two points of intersection (\"nodes\") are commonly marked on astronom- ical charts N and N'; this is when eclipses occur. But because of the irregularities in the shape and lag of the Earth's orbit around the Sun, these nodal intersections do not recur pre- cisely at the same celestial pos itions year after year; rather, they recur in a cycle of 18.61 years. Hawkins postulated that the operating principle for this cycle was, therefore, \"cycle end/cycle start\" in th e nineteenth year, and Hawkins reasoned that the purpose of the 56 Aubrey Holes was to attain an adjustment by moving three markers at a time within the Aubrey circle, since 18 2/3 x 3 = 56. This, he"},{"pageNumber":48,"pageContent":"46 WHEN TIME BEGAN held, made possible the foretel ling of eclipses of the Moon as well as of the Sun, and hi s conclusion was that such a prediction of eclipses was the main purpose of the construc- tion and design of Stonehenge . Stonehenge, he announced, was nothing short of a brilliant astronomical computer made of stone. The proposition that Stonehenge was not only a \"Sun temple\" but also a lunar observatory was met at first with fierce resistance. Prominent among the dissenters, who con- sidered many of the Moon alignments to be coincidental, was Richard J.C. Atkinson of the University College in Cardiff, who had led some of the most extensive archaeo- logical excavations at the site . The archaeological evidence for the great antiquity of St onehenge was the very reason for his disdain for the obscrvatory/lunar-alignments/Neo- lithic computer theories, for he asserted that Neolithic Man in Britain was simply incapable of such achievements. His disdain and even ridicule, expressed in such titles for his articles in Antiquity as \"M oonshine on Stonehenge\" and in his book Stonehenge, turned to grudging support as a result of studies conducted at St onehenge by Alexander Thorn (Megalithic Lunar Observations). Thorn, an engineering professor at Oxford Univers ity, conducted the most accurate measurements at Stonehenge , and pointed out that the \"horseshoe\" arrangement of the sarsen stones in fact rep- resented an oval (Fig. 11), an elliptical shape that represents Figure 11"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"A Computer Made of Stone 47 planetary orbits more accurately than a circle. He agreed with Newham that Stonchenge 1 was primarily a lunar, and not just a solar, observatory, and confirmed that Stonehenge was erected where it is because it is only there that the eight lunar observations could be ma de precisely along the lines formed by the rectangle connect ing the four Station Stones. The fierce debate, conducte d on the pages of leading scientific magazines and in c onfrontational conferences, was summed up by C.A. Newham (Supplement to the Enigma of Stonehenge and its Astronom ical and Geometric Signif- icance) in the following words: \"With the exception of the five Trilithons, practically all the remaining features appear to have lunar connections.\" He agreed that the \"56 Aubrey Holes rotate to the eight main alignments of the Moon setting and rising.\" Thereafter, even Atkinson admitted that he \"has become sufficiently pe rsuaded that conventional ar- chaeological thinking is in need of drastic revision\" in re- gard to the purpose and functions of Stonehenge. These conclusions were to no small measure the result of the research by a notable participant who had joined the growing list of involved scient ists in the late 1960s and the decade of the 1970s. He was Si r Fred Hoyle, astronomer and mathematician. He held that the alignments listed by Hawkins to various stars and cons tellations were rather ran- dom than deliberate, but fully agreed with the lunar aspects of Stonehenge I—and especially the role of the fifty-six Aubrey Holes and the rectangular arrangement of the Station Stones (\"Stonehenge—An Eclipse Predictor\" in Nature and On Stonehenge). But concurring that the Aubr ey Circle could act as a \"calculator\" for predicting ecl ipses (in his opinion it was done by moving four markers around), Hoyle stirred up another issue. Whoever had designed this calculator— Hawkins called it a \"computer \"—must have known in ad- vance the precise length of the solar year, the Moon's orbital period, and the cycle of 18.61 y ears; and Neolithic Man in Britain simply did not possess such knowledge. Struggling to explain how the advanced knowledge of astronomy and mathematics had appeared in Neolithic Brit-"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"48 WHEN TIME BEGAN ain, Hawkins resorted to ancient records of the Mediterra- nean peoples. In addition to the Diodorus/Hecataeus ref- erence he also mentioned Plutarch's quote (in Isis and Osiris) of Eudoxus of Cnidus, the fourth century B.C. astronomer-mathematician from Asia Minor, who had as- sociated the ''demon god of ec lipses\" with the number fifty- six. In the absence of answers from Man, a glance at the superhuman? Hoyle, on his part, arrived at the conviction that Stone- henge was not a mere observatory, a place to see what goes on in the skies. He called it a Predictor, an instrument for foretelling celestial events and a facility for noting them on the predetermined dates. Agreei ng that \"such an intellectual achievement was beyond the capacity of the local Neolithic farmers and herdsmen,\" he felt that the Station Stones rect- angle and all it implied indicate \"that the builders of Stone- henge I might have come to the British Isles from the outside, purposely looking for this rectangular alignment\" (which is possible just where Stonehengc is located, in the northern hemisphere), \"just as the modern astronomer often searches far from home for pl aces to build his telescopes. \"A veritable Newton or Einstein must have been at work at Stonehenge,\" Hoyle mused; but even so, where was the university where he had lear ned mathematics and astron- omy, where were the writings without which accumulated knowledge could not be passed on and taught, and how could a sole genius plan, ex ecute, and supervise such a celestial predictor when, for Ph ase II alone, a whole century was needed? \"There have onl y been about 200 generations of history; there were upwar d of 10,000 generations of pre- history,\" Hoyle observed. Was it all part of the \"eclipse of the gods,\" he wondered—the transition from a time when people worshiped an actual Sun god and a Moon god, \"to become the invisible God of Isaiah?\" Without explicitly divulging his thoughts, Hoyle gave an answer by quoting the full section in Diodorus from Hec- ataeus regarding the Hyperborea ns; it states toward its end"},{"pageNumber":51,"pageContent":"A Computer Made of Stone 49 that after the Greeks and Hyperboreans exchanged visits \"in the most ancient times.\" They also say that the Moon, as viewed from this island, appears to be but a litt le distance from the Earth, and to have upon it prom inences, like those of the Earth, which are visible to the eye. The account is also given that the god visits the island every nineteen years, the period in which the return of the stars to the same place in the heavens is accom- plished; and for this reason the nineteen-year period is called by the Greeks the \"year of Meton.\" The familiarity in such distant times not only with the nineteen-year cycle of the Moon but also with \"promi- nences, like those of the Earth\"—surface features such as mountains and plains—is unquestionably amazing. The attribution by Greek histor ians of the circular struc- ture in Hyperborea to the l unar cycle first described in Greece by the Athenian Meton tosses the problem of Who Built Stonehenge to the ancient Near East; so do the soul- searching conclusions and musi ngs of the above mentioned astronomers. But more than two centuries earlier, William Stukeley had already pointed for answers in the same direction, to- ward the ancient Near East. To his sketch of Stonehenge, as he understood it to have b een, he appended the design he had seen on an eastern Mediterranean ancient coin (Fig. 12a) which depicts a temple on an elevated platform. This depiction, more explicit, also appears on another ancient coin from the city of Byblos in the same area, one that we have reproduced in the very first volume of The Earth Chronicles. It shows that the ancient temple had an enclo- sure in which there stood a rocket upon a launch pad (Fig. 12b). We have identified the place as The Landing Place of Sumerian lore, the place where the Sumerian king Gil- gamesh witnessed a rocket ship rise.

The great antiquity of Stone henge, which kept increasing as scientific knowledge about it progressed, is of course what troubles most scientists; and it is primarily the dates of construction ascertained for Stonehenge I and II + III that have led archaeologists to seek Mediterranean visitors, and eminent scholars to allude to ancient gods, as the only possible explanations for the enigma.

Having visited the Levant in 1890 he observed that whereas fo r the early civilizations in India and China there are fe w monuments but many written records establishing their age, the opposite holds true in Egypt and Babylonia: they were \"two civilizations of un- defined antiquity\" where monu ments abounded but the mea- sure of their antiquity was uncer tain fat the time of Lockyer's writing). It struck him, he wrote, that it was truly remarkable that in Babylonia \"from the beginn ing of things the sign for God was a star\" and that likewis e in Egypt, in the hiero- glyphic texts, three stars re presented the plural term \"gods.\" Babylonian records on cl ay tablets and burned clay bricks, he noted, appeared to deal with regular cycles of \"moon and planet positions with extreme accuracy.\" Planets, stars, and the constell ations of the zodiac are rep- resented on the walls of E gyptian tombs and on papyruses. In the Hindu pantheon, he observed, we find the worship of the Sun and of the Dawn: the name of the god Indra meaning \"The Day Brought by the Sun\" and that of the goddess Ushas meaning \"Dawn.\" Can astronomy be of assistan ce to Egyptology? he won- dered; can it help define the measure of Egyptian and Baby- lonian antiquity? When one considers the Hindu Rigveda and Egyptian inscriptions from an astronom ical point of view, Lockyer wrote, \"one is struck by the fact that in both, the early worship and all the early observa tions related to the horizon . . . This was true not only of the Sun, but equally true of the stars which studded the expanse of the sky.\" The ho- rizon, he pointed out, is \"the place where the circle which bounds our view of Earth's surface and the sky appear to meet.\" A circle, in other words, where Heaven and Earth touch and meet. It is there that the ancient peoples sought whatever sign or omen their observers were looking for. Since the most regular phenom enon observable on the ho- rizon was the rising and setting of the Sun on a daily basis, it was natural to make this the basis of ancient astronomical observations, and to relate ot her phenomena (such as the"},{"pageNumber":55,"pageContent":"The Temples That Faced Heaven 53 appearance or movements of plan ets and even stars) to their \"heliacal rising,\" their brief ap pearance on the eastern ho- rizon as the turning Earth reach es the few moments of dawn, when the Sun begins to rise but the sky is dark enough to see the stars. An ancient observer could eas ily determine that the Sun always rises in the eastern sk ies and sets in the western skies, but he would have noted that in summer the Sun appears to rise in a higher arc than in winter and the days are longer. This, modern astronomy explains, is due to the fact that the Earth's axis ar ound which it rotates daily is not perpendicular to its path around the Sun (the Ecliptic) but is inclined to it—about 23.5 de grees nowadays. This creates the seasons and the four points in the seeming movement of the Sun up and down in the skies: the summer and winter solstices and the spring (\"vernal\") and autumnal equinoxes (which we have described earlier). Studying the orientation of te mples old and not so old, Lockyer found that those he called \"Sun Temples\" were of two kinds: those oriented according to the equinoxes and those oriented according to the solstices. Though the Sun always rises in the eastern sk ies and sets in the western skies, it is only on the days of the equinoxes that it rises anywhere on Earth precisely in the east and sets precisely in the west, and Lockyer therefore deemed such \"equinoc- tial\" temples to be more universal than those whose axis was oriented according to the solstices; because the angle formed by the northern and southern (to an observer in the northern hemisphere, the summer and winter) solstices de- pended on where the observer was—his latitude. Therefore, \"solstitial\" temples were more individual, specific to their geographic location (and even elevation). As examples of equinoctial temples Lockyer cited the Temple to Zeus at Baalbek, the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, and the great basilica of St. Peter's in the Vatican in Rome (Fig. 13)—all oriented on a precise east-west axis. Regarding the latter he quoted studies on church architecture that described how at the Old St. Peter's (begun under Constantine in the fourth cen tury and torn down early in"},{"pageNumber":56,"pageContent":"54 WHEN TIME BEGAN the sixteenth century), on the day of the vernal equinox, \"the great doors of the porch of the quadriporticus were opened at sunrise, and also th e eastern doors of the church; and as the sun rose, its rays passed through the outer doors, then through the inner doors, and, penetrating straight through the nave, illuminate d the High Altar.\" Lockyer added that \"the present church fulfils the same conditions.\" As examples of \"solstitial\" Sun Temples Lockyer described the principal Chinese \"Temple of Heaven\" in Peking, where \"the most important of a ll state observances in China, the sacrifice performed in the op en air at the south altar of the Temple of Heaven,\" was he ld on the day of the winter solstice, December 21; and the structure at Stonehenge, oriented to the summer solstice. All that was, however, just a prelude to Lockyer's main studies, in Egypt. Studying the orientation of Egypt's ancient temples, Lockyer concluded that the ol der ones were \"equinoctial\" and the later ones \"solstitial.\" He was amazed to discover that earlier temples revealed greater astronomical sophisti- cation than later ones, for they were intended to observe and venerate not only the rising or setting of the Sun, but also of stars.

That equinoctial shrine, he wrote, was the temple in Heliopolis (\"City of the Sun\" in Greek) whose Egyptian name, Annu, was also mentioned in the Bible as On. Lock- yer calculated that the comb ination of solar observations with the period of the bright st ar Sirius and with the annual rising of the Nile, a triple conjunction on which the Egyptian calendar was based, indicated th at in Egyptian time reck- oning Point Zero was circa 3200 B.C. The Annu shrine, it is known from Egyptian inscriptions, held the Ben-Ben (\"Pyramidi on-Bird\"), claimed to have been the actual conical upper pa rt of the \"Celestial Barge\" in which the god Ra had come to Earth from the \"Planet of Millions of Year s.\" This object, us ually kept in the temple's inner sanctum, wa s put on public display once a year, and pilgrimages to the shri ne to view and venerate the sacred object continued into dynastic times. The object itself has vanished over the millennia; but a stone replica thereof has been found, showing the great god visible through the doorway or hatch of the capsule (Fig. 14). The legend of the Phoenix, the mythical bird that dies and resurrects after a certain period, has also been traced to this shrine and its veneration.

In other words, the Sed festival was a kind of New Year's Day festival celebrated not each y ear but after the passage of a number of years. The presence of both equinoctial and solstitial orientations in this temple implies familiarity—in the third millennium B.C.—-with the concept of the Four Corners. Drawings and inscriptions found in the temp le's corridor describe the king's \"sacred dance.\" They were copied, translated, and published by Ludwig Borchardt with H. Kees and Friedrich von Bissing in Das Re-Heiligtum des Konigs Ne-Woser-Re. They concluded that the \"dance\" represented the \"cycle of sanctification of the f our corners of the Earth.\" The equinoctial orientation of the temple proper and the solstitial one of the corridor, bespeaking the movements of the Sun, led Egyptologists to ap ply to the structure the term \"Sun Temple.\" They found reinforcement in this desig- nation in the discovery of a \"s olar boat\" (par tly carved out of the rock and partly built of dried and painted bricks) buried under the sands just south of the temple enclosure. Hieroglyphic texts dealing wi th the measurement of time and the calendar in ancient E gypt held that the celestial bodies traversed the skies in boats. Often, the gods or even the deified pharaohs (h aving joined the gods in the Afterlife) were depicted in such boats , sailing above the firmament of the skies that was held up at the four corner points (Fig, 17). The next great temple clearly emulated the pyramidion- on-platform concept (Fig. 18) of the Ne-User-Ra \"Sun Tem- ple\"; but it was already fully oriented to the solstices from its inception, having been pl anned and executed along a northwest—southeast axis. It was built on the west side of the Nile (near the present-day village of Deir-el-Bahari) in Upper Egypt, as part of greater Thebes, by the Pharaoh Mentuhotep I circa 2100 B.C.

We now know that the solstices result from the fact that the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its plane of orbit around the Sun, and the points of \"s tandstill\" match the Earth's tilt. But astronomers established that this angle is not con- stant. The Earth wobbles, like a pitching ship, from side to side—perhaps the lingering result of some mighty bang it received in its past (whether the original collision that put the Earth in its present orbit, or the crash of a massive meteor some 65 million years ago that may have extin- guished the dinosaurs). The pr esent tilt of about 23.5 degrees can decrease to perhaps just 21° and on the other hand increase to well over 24°—no one can really say for sure, since the change by even 1° lasts thousands of\" years (7,000, according to Lockyer). Such changes in the obliquity result in changes in the Sun's standstill points (Fig. 23a). This means that a temple built to a precise solstitial orientation at a given time is no longer properly aligned to that ori- entation several hundred, and cer tainly several thousand, years later. Lockyer's masterful innovation was this: by determining the orientation of a temple and its geographic longitude, it was possible to calculate the obl iquity that prevailed at the time of construction; and by determining the changes in obliquity over the millennia, it was possible to conclude with sufficient certainty when the temple was constructed. The Table of Obliquity, fine -tuned and made more ac- curate during the past century, shows the change in the angle of the Earth's tilt in five-hundr ed-year intervals, going back from the present 23° 27' (about 23.5 degrees): "},{"pageNumber":63,"pageContent":"The Temples That Faced Heaven 63 Lockyer applied his lindings pr imarily to extensive mea- surements at the great temple to Amon-Ra in Karnak. This temple, having been enlarged and augmented by various pharaohs, consists of two prin cipal rectangular structures built back-to-back on a southeast-northwest axis, signifying a solstitial orientation. Loc kyer concluded that the purpose of the orientation and the layout of the temple was to enable a beam of sunlight to come fr om such a direction on solstice day that it would travel the length of a long corridor, pass between two obelisks, and strike the Holy of Holies with a flash of Divine Light at the temple's innermost sanctum. Lockyer noticed that the axis of the two back-to-back tem- ples was not similarly oriented: the newer axis represented a solstice resulting from a somewhat smaller obliquity than the older axis (Fig. 23b). Th e two obliquities determined by Lockyer show that the older temple was built circa 2100 B.C. and the newer one circa 1200 B.C. Although more recent investigations, especially by Gerald S. Hawkins, suggest that the Sun's beam, at winter solstice, was meant to be viewed from a part of the temples Hawkins named \"High Room of the Sun\" and not as a beam traveling the length of the axis, the revision in no way changes the basic conclusion by Locker rega rding the solstitial orien- Figures 23a and 23b "},{"pageNumber":64,"pageContent":"64 WHEN TIME BEGAN tation. Indeed, further archaeological discoveries at Kamak corroborate Lockyer's principa l innovation—that the ori- entation of the temples changed in time to reflect the changes in obliquity. Therefore, the orie ntation could serve as a clue to the temples' time of constr uction, The latest archaeolog- ical advances confirmed that the construction of the oldest part coincided with the be ginning of the Middle Kingdom under the XI dynasty circa 2100 B.C. Repairs, demolitions, and rebuilding then continued through the ensuing centuries by pharaohs of subsequent dynas ties; the two obelisks were set up by pharaohs of the XVIII dynasty. The final phase took shape under the Pharaoh Seti II of the XIX dynasty who reigned in 1216-1210 B.C.—all as Lockyer had determined. Archaeoastronomy—or, astro-archaeology as Sir Norman Lockyer named it—proved its merit and validity. At the beginning of this cent ury Lockyer turned his at- tention to Stonehenge, having become convinced that the phenomenon he had discovered governed temple orienta- tions in other parts of the an cient world, as at the Parthenon in Athens. At Stonehenge the ax is of viewing from the center through the Sarsen Circle clearly bespoke an orientation to the summer solstice, and Lockyer performed his measure- ments accordingly. The Heel Stone, he concluded, was the indicator of the point on the horizon where the expected sunrise was to happen; and the apparent shifting of the stone (with attendant widening and realignment of the Avenue) suggested to him that as the centuries passed and the change in the Earth's tilt kept changing the sunrise point, even if ever so slightly, the people in charge of Stonehenge kept adjusting the view line. Lockyer presented his conclusions in Stonehenge and Other British Stone Monuments (1906); they can be summed up in one drawing (Fi g. 24). It assumes an axis that begins at the Altar Stone, passes betw een the sarsen stones num- bered 1 and 30, down the Avenue , toward the Heel Stone as the focusing pillar. The obliq uity angle indicated by such an axis led him to suggest that Stonehenge was built in 1680"},{"pageNumber":65,"pageContent":"The Temples That Faced Heaven 65 Figure 24 B.C. Needless to say, such an early date was quite sensa- tional at a time, a century ago, when scholars still thought of Stonehenge in terms of King Arthur's days. The refinements in studies of the Earth's obliquity, al- lowances now made for margin s of error, and the deter- mination of the various phases of Stonehenge have not diminished Lockyer's basic contribution. Although Stone- henge III, which is what we essentially see nowadays, is now dated to circa 2000 B.C., it is generally agreed that the Altar Stone was removed when the remodeling began circa 2100 B.C. with the double Bluestone Circle (Stonehenge II), and that it was reerected where it is now only when the bluestones were reintroduced and the Y and Z holes dug.

(Stonehenge IIIc)—and quite possibly"},{"pageNumber":66,"pageContent":"66 WHEN TIME BEGAN the 1680 B.C. date arrived at by Lockyer. As the drawing shows, he did not rule out a mu ch earlier date for the prior phases of Stonehenge; this too compares well with the pres- ently accepted date of 2900/2800 B.C. for Stonehenge I. Archaeoastronomy thus joins archaeological findings and radiocarbon dating to arrive at the same dates for the con- struction of the various phases of Stonehenge, the three separate methods corroborati ng each other. With such a convincing determination of St onehenge's dates, the ques- tion regarding its builders b ecomes more poignant. Who, circa 2900/2800 B.C., possessed the knowledge of astron- omy (to say nothing of engineerin g and architecture) to build such a calendrical \"comput er,\" and circa 2100/2000 B.C. to rearrange the various components thereof and attain a new realignment? And why was such a realignment required or desired? Mankind's transition from the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age) that lasted for hundreds of th ousands of years to the Me- solithic (Middle Stone Age) occurred abruptly in the ancient Near East. There, circa 11,000 B. C.—right after the Deluge, according to our calculations—de liberate agriculture and the domestication of animals be gan in a stunning profusion. Archaeological and other evidence (most recently aug- mented by studies of linguist ic patterns) shows that Me- solithic agriculture spread from the Near East to Europe as a result of the migration of people possessing such knowl- edge. It reached the Iberia n peninsula between 4500 and 4000 b.c, the western edge of what is today France and the Lowlands between 3500 and 3000 B.C., and the British Isles between 3000 and 2500 b.c. It was soon thereafter that the \"Beaker People,\" who knew how to make clay utensils, arrived on the Stonehenge scene. But by then the ancient Near East was already well past the Neolithic (New Stone Age) which began there circa 7400 B.C. and whose hallmark was the transition from stone to clay to metals and the appearan ce of urban settlements.

If, as all agree, the sophistic ated scientific knowledge that was required for the planning, siting, orientation, and con- struction of Stonehenge had to come from outside the British Isles, the earlier civilizations of the Near East seem to be the only sources for such knowledge at the time. Were the Sun Temples of Egypt, then, the prototypes for Stonehenge? We have seen that at the dates established for Stonehenge's various phases, th ere already existed in Egypt elaborate temples that were astronomically oriented. The equinoctial Sun Temple at Heli opolis was built at about the time, 3100 B.C., when kingshi p began in Egypt (if not somewhat earlier)—several centuries before Stonehenge I. The construction of the oldest phase of the solstitially ori- ented temple to Amon-Ra in Karnak took place circa 2100 B.C.—a date coinciding (perhaps not by chance) with the date for the \"remodeling\" of Stonehenge. It is thus theoretically possi ble that Mediterranean peo- ple—Egyptians or people with \"Egyptian\" knowledge— could somehow account for the construction of Stonehenge I, II, and III at dates that were impossible for the local inhabitants of the area. While, from a timing point of view, Egypt could have been the source of the required knowledge, we ought to be bothered by a crucial differen ce between all of the Egyptian temples and Stonehenge: none of the Egyptian temples, no matter whether their orientation was equinoctial or solstitial, were circular as Stonehenge has been during all of its phases. The various pyramids were square-based; the podiums for the obelisks and pyramidions were square; the numerous temples were all rectangular. With all the stones of Egypt, not one of its temples was a stone henge.

None of th em, however, appears to have designed, oriented, and built a circular temple. What about those famous seafarers, the Phoenicians? Not only did they reach the British Isles (mainly in search of tin) too late to have built not just Stonehenge I but also the II and III phases, but none of th eir temple architecture bears any resemblance to the emphatically circular essence of Stonehenge. We can see a Phoeni cian temple depicted on the Byblos coin (Fig. 12). an d it is certainly rectangular. On the vast stone platform at Baalbek in the Lebanon moun- tains, people after people a nd conquerors after conquerors built their temples precisely on the ruins and according to the layout of preceding temples. These, as the latest extant ruins from the Roman era reveal (Fig. 25), represented a rectangular temple (black area) with a square forecourt (the diamond-shaped entrance pavilion is a purely Roman ad- dition).

The sciences flourished within the temples, where the \"secrets of numbers and of the heavens\"—of mathematics and astronomy—were kept, taught, and trans- mitted by generations of priests who performed their func- tions within walled-off sacr ed compounds. Such compounds usually included shrines dedicated to various deities, resi- dences, work and study places for the priests, storehouses and other administrative buildings, and—as the dominant, principal, and most prominent fe ature of the sacred precinct and of the city itself—a ziggu rat, a pyramid that rose sky high in stages (usually seven). The topmost stage was a multichambered structure that was intended—literally—to be the residence of the great god whose \"cult center\" (as scholars like to call it) the city was (Fig. 30).

In those days each of the Great Anunnaki was assigned a celestial counterpart, and since the Solar System had twelve members, the \"Olympic Circle,\" throughout the millennia and up to and including Greek time, was always made up of twelve. It was thus that the worship of the gods was closely associated with the motions of the celestial bodies, and the biblical admonitions against the worship of \"the Sun, the Moon and the Host of Heaven'1 were in reality admonitions against the worshi p of gods other than Yahweh. The rituals, festivals, days of abstinence, and other rites that expressed the worship of the gods were thus attuned to the motions of the gods' celestial counterparts.

They were already, we learn from the earliest texts, Temples of Time. One of the Mesopotamian versions of the events leading to the Deluge is the text known (by its opening words) \" When the gods like men\" in which the hero of the Deluge is called Atra-Hasis (\"He who is exceedingly wise\"). The tale relates how Anu, the ruler of Nibiru, retu rned to that planet from a visit to Earth after arranging a division of powers and territories on Earth between his feuding sons, the half brothers Enlil (\"Lord of the Command\") and Enki (\"Lord of Earth\"), putting En ki in charge of the gold- mining operations in Africa.

Let heralds proclaim a command loudly throughout the land: Do not reverence your gods, do not pray to your goddesses. As the situation got worse an d the catastrophe day neared, Atra-Hasis persisted in his in tercession with his god Enki. \"In the temple of his god ... he set foot. . . every day he wept, bringing oblations in th e morning.\" Seeking Enki's help to avert Mankind's demise, \"he called by the name of his god\"—words that employ the same terminology as in the above-quoted verse from th e Bible. In the end Enki decided to subvert the decision of the Council of the An- unnaki by summoning Atra-Hasis to the temple and speaking to him from behind a screen. The event was commemorated on a Sumerian cylinder seal, showing Enki (as the Serpent God) revealing the secret of the Deluge to Atra-Hasis (Fig. 40). Giving him instructions for the building of a submers- ible boat that would withstand the avalanche of water, Enki advised Atra-Hasis to lose no time, for he had only seven days left before the catastr ophe happened. To make sure Atra-Hasis wasted no time, Enki put into motion a clocklike device: He opened the water clock and filled it; the coming of the flood on the seventh night he marked off for him.

It has been assumed that the ancient illustration depicts (on the right) the reed screen from behind which Enki had spok en to the hero of the great flood, the biblical Noah. On e must wonder, however, whether what we see is not a reed screen, but a depiction of that prehistoric water clock (held up by its priestly attendant). Enki was the chief scientist of the Anunnaki; it is no wonder, therefore, that it was at his temple, at his \"cult center\" Eridu, that the first hu man scientists, the Wise Men, served as priests. One of the first, if not the very first, was called Adapa. Though the original Sumerian Adapa text has not been found, Akkadian and A ssyrian versions on clay fragments that have been found attest the tale's significance. Informing us at the very be ginning that Adapa's command of wisdom was almost as good as that of Enki himself, the text proceeds to explain that Enki had \"perfected for him wide understanding, disclosing al l the designs of the Earth; Wisdom he had given to him.\" It was all done at the temple; Adapa, we are told, \"daily did attend the sanctuary of Eridu.\" According to Sumerian chronicl es of the earlier times, it was at Eridu's temple that Enki, as guardian of the secrets of all scientific knowledge, ke pt the ME's—tabletlike ob- jects on which the scientific data were inscribed. One of the Sumerian texts details how the goddess Inanna (later known"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"84 WHEN TIME BEGAN as Ishtar), wishing to give st atus to her \"cult center\" Uruk (the biblical Erech), tricked En ki into giving her some of these divine formulas. Adapa, we find, was also nicknamed NUN.ME, meaning \"He who can decipher the ME's.\" Even unto millennia later, in Assyrian times, the saying \"Wise as Adapa\" meant that someone was exceedingly wise and knowledgeable. The st udy of sciences was often referred to in Mesopotamian texts as Shunnat apkali Adapa, \"recital/repetition of the great forefather Adapa.\" A letter by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipa l mentioned that his grand- father. King Sennacherib, wa s given great knowledge when Adapa had appeared to him in a dream. The \"wide knowl- edge\" imparted by Enki to Adapa included writing, med- icine, and—according to the astronomical series of tablets UD.SAR.ANUM.ENLILLA (\"The Great Days of Anu and Enlil\")—knowledge of astronomy and astrology. Though Adapa had daily attended the sanctuary of Enki, it appears from Sumerian texts that the first officially ap- pointed priest—a function that then passed hereditarily from father to son—was named EN.ME.DUR.AN. KI—\"Priest of the ME's of Duranki,\" the sacred precinct of Nippur. The texts report how the gods \"showed him how to observe oil and water, the secrets of Anu, Enlil, and Enki. They gave him the Divine Tablet, th e engraved secrets of Heaven and Earth. They taught him how to make calculations with numbers\"—the knowledge of ma thematics and astronomy, and of the art of measuremen t, including that of time. Many of the Mesopotamian tablets dealing with mathe- matics, astronomy, and the calendar have astounded sci- entists by their sophistication. At the core of these sciences was a mathematical system called sexagesimal (\"Base Sixty\") whose advanced nature , including its celestial as- pects, has already been discussed. Such sophistication ex- isted even in the earliest ti mes that some call predynastic: arithmetically inscribed tablet s (Fig. 41) that have been found attest the use of the sexagesimal system and of nu- merical record keeping. Designs on clay objects also from the earliest times (Fig. 42) leave no doubt regarding the high level of knowledge of geomet ry in those remote times,"},{"pageNumber":81,"pageContent":"DUR.AN.KI—The \"Bond Heaven-Earth\" 85 "},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"86 WHEN TIME BEGAN six thousand years ago. And one must wonder whether these designs, or at least some of them, were purely decorative or represented knowledge regarding the Earth, its four \"cor- ners,\" and perhaps even of the shape of astronomically related structures. What these designs also show applies to an important point made in the previous chapter: the circle and circular shapes were obviously known in ancient Mes- opotamia and could be drawn to perfection. Additional information regarding the antiquity of the ex- act sciences can be gleaned fr om the tales about Etana, one of the earliest Sumerian rulers. At first considered a mythical hero, he is now recognized as a historical person. According to the Sumerian King Lists, when kingship—an organized civilization—was \"lowered ag ain from heaven\" after the Deluge, \"kingship was first in Kish\"—a city whose remains and antiquity have been found and confirmed by archae- ologists. Its thirteenth ruler was called Etana, and the King Lists, which by and large only list the names of successive rulers and the length of their reigns, make an exception in the case of Etana by adding after his name the following notation: \"A shepherd; he who ascended to heaven, who consolidated all the lands.\" A ccording to Thorkild Jacobsen (The Sumerian King List) Et ana's reign began circa 3100 B.C.; excavations at Kish have unearthed the remains of monumental buildings and a zi ggurat (stage-temple) dating to the same time. In the aftermath of the Deluge, when the plain between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers dried sufficiently to enable resettlement, the Cities of the Gods were rebuilt exactly where they had been, according to the \"olden plan,\" Kish, the first City of Men, was entirely new and its place and layout had to be determined. These decisions, we read in the Tale of Etana, were made by the gods. Employing scientific knowledge of geometry for layout and astronomy for orientation, The gods traced out a city; Seven gods laid its foundations. The city of Kish they traced out,"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"DUR.AN.KI—The \"Bond Heaven-Earth\" 87 and there the seven gods laid its foundation, A city they established, a dwelling place; but a Shepherd they withheld. The twelve rulers at Kish who had preceded Etana were not yet given the Sumerian ro yal-priestly title EN.SI— \"Lordly Shepherd\" or as some prefer \"Righteous Shep- herd.\" The city, it appears, could attain this status only when the gods could find the ri ght man to build a ziggurat stage-temple there and, by becoming a king-priest, be given the title EN.SI. Wh o would be \"their builder, the one to build the E.HURSAG.KALAMMA,\" the gods asked— build the \"House\" (ziggurat) that shall be \"Mountainhead for all the lands\"? The task to \"look for a king in all the lands, above and below,\" was assigned to Inanna /Ishtar. She found and rec- ommended Etana—a humble shepherd . . . Enlil, \"he who grants kingship,\" had to make the actual appointment. We read that \"Enlil inspected Etana, the young man whom Ishtar had nominated. 'She s ought and she found!' he cried. 'In the land shall kingship be established; let the heart of Kish be glad!' \" Now comes the \"mythological\" part. The brief notation in the King Lists that Etan a ascended to heaven stemmed from a chronicle that scholar s call the \"legend\" of Etana which related how Etana, with the permission of the god Utu/Shamash who was in charge of the spaceport, was car- ried aloft by an \"eagle.\" Th e higher he rose, the smaller the Earth looked. After the firs t beru of flight the land \"became a mere hill\"; after the second beru the land looked like a mere furrow; after the third beru, as a garden ditch; and after one more beru the Earth completely disappeared. \"As I glanced around,\" Etana later reported , \"the land had disappeared, and upon the sea mine eyes could not feast.\" A beru in Sumer was a unit of measurement—of length (a \"league\") and of time ( one \"double-hour,\" the twelfth part of a daytime-nighttime period that we now divide into twenty-four hours). It remained a unit of measure in as- tronomy, when it denoted the twel fth part of the heavenly"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"88 WHEN TIME BEGAN circle. The text of the Tale of Etana does not make clear which unit of measurement—di stance, time, or arc—was meant; perhaps all of them. What the text does make clear is that at that remote time, when the first true Shepherd King was enthroned in the first City of Men, distance, time, and the heavens could already be measured. Kishas the first royal city—under the patronage of \"Nim- rod\"—is mentioned in the Bibl e (Genesis chapter 10); and certain other aspects of events recorded in the Bible merit exploration. This is especia lly so because of the puzzling mention in the Tale of Etana of the seven gods involved in the planning—and thus orient ation—of the c ity and its ziggurat. Since all the major gods of ancient Mesopotamia had celestial counterparts from am ong the twelve members of the Solar System, as well as a counterpart from the twelve constellations of the zodiac an d from the twelve months, one must wonder whether the re ference to the determination of the orientation of Kish and its ziggurat by the \"seven gods\" did not actually mean by the seven planets which those deities represented. Were the Anunnaki waiting for the propitious alignment of seven planets as the right time and right orientation fo r Kish and its ziggurat? Further light, we believe, can be shed on the subject by journeying in time over more than two thousand years to Judea circa 1000 b.c. Incredibly , we find that about three thousand years ago the circ umstances surrounding the se- lection of a shepherd to be the builder of a new temple in a new royal capital emulated th e events and circumstances recorded in the Tale of Etana; and the same number seven, with a calendrical signifi cance, also played a role. The Judean city where the ancient drama was reenacted was Jerusalem. David, who wa s shepherding the flocks of his father, Jesse the Bethlehemite, was chosen by the Lord for kingship. After the death of King Saul, when David reigned in Hebron over the trib e of Judah alone, represen- tatives of the other eleven tribes \"came unto David in He- bron\" and asking him to become king over all of them"},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"DUR.AN.KI—The \"Bond Heaven-Earth\" 89 reminded him that Yahweh had earlier said thus to him: \"You shall shepherd my people Israel and shall be a Nagid over Israel\" (II Samuel 5:2). The term Nagid is usually translated \"Captain\" (King James Version), \"Commander\" (The New American Bible) or even \"Prince\" (The New English Bible). None appear to have realized that Nagid is a Sumerian loanword, a term borrowed intact from the Sumerian language, in which the word meant \"herdsman\"! A principal preoccupation of the Israelites at that time was the need to find a home for the Ark of the Covenant— not just a permanent home, but also a safe one. Originally made and placed by Moses in the Tent of Appointment during the Exodus, it contained the two stone tablets in- scribed with the Ten Commandm ents on Mount Sinai. Made of specific wood and overlaid with gold both inside and outside, it was surmounted by two Cherubim made of hard- ened gold with wings extended toward each other; and each time Moses had an appointment with the Lord, Yahweh spoke to him \"from between the two Cherubim\" (Fig. 43a is a reconstruction suggested by Hugo Gressmann (Die Lade Jahves) because of similar depictions found in northern Phoenicia; Fig. 43b is a depi ction suggested by A. Parrot in Le Temple de Jerusalem). We believe that the Ark, with its insulated gold layers a nd Cherubim was a communication device, perhaps electrically powered (when it was once touched inadvertently, the person involved fell dead). Yahweh had given very deta iled instructions regarding the construction of the Tent of Appointment and the enclo- sure for it, and for the Ark, including what amounted to an \"operating manual\" for the dism antling and reassembly of all that as well as for the careful transportation of the Ark. By David's time, however, th e Ark was no longer carried by wooden staves but transpor ted upon a wheeled carriage. It was moved from one temporary place of worship to an- other, and a major assignment for the newly anointed Shep- herd King was to establish a new national capital in Jerusalem and therein build a permanent housing for the Ark in the \"House of the Lord.\""},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"90 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figures 43a and 43b But this was not to come to pass. Speaking to King David through the Prophet Nathan, the Lord informed him that it would not be he but his son who would be granted the privilege of building a H ouse of Cedars for Yahweh. And so it was that one of the very first tasks of King Sol- omon was to build the \"House of Yahweh\" (now referred to as the First Temple) in Jerusalem. Built as the sacred compound and its components in the Sinai were, it was erected in accordance with ve ry detailed instructions. In fact, the layout plans of th e two are almost identical (Fig. 44a the sacred compound in the Sinai; Fig. 44b the Temple of Solomon). And both were oriented along a precise east-west axis, identifying them both as equinoc- tial temples.

We are informed in I Kings (chapter 3) that Solomon proceeded to organize the construction project (it involved, among others in the workfor ce, 80,000 stone quarriers and 70,000 porters) only after Ya hweh had appeared unto Solomon in Gibeon \"in a nightly vision.\" The construc- tion, lasting seven years, bega n with laying the foundation stone in the fourth year of Solomon's reign and \"in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul which is the eighth month the Temple was completed in all its stipulations and exactly according to its plans.\" But although entirely complete with no detail missed or omitted, the Temple was not inaugurated. It was only eleven months later, \"in the month of Etanim, the seventh month, on the festiv al,\" that all the elders and tribal chiefs from all over assembled in Jerusalem, \"and the priests brought the Ark of the Covenant with Yahweh"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"92 WHEN TIME BEGAN into its place, into the Dvir of the temple which is the Holy of Holies, under the wings of the Cherubim . . . And there was nothing in the Ark except the two stone tablets which Moses had placed therein in the Wilderness after Yahweh had made a covenant with the Children of Israel after they had left Egypt. And when the priests had stepped out of the Holy of Holies, a cloud filled the House of Yahweh.\" And Solomon prayed unto Yahweh, \"H e who dwells in the fog- like cloud,\" beseeching the Lord \"who dwells in the heav- ens\" to come and listen to his people's prayers in the new temple. The long postponement in the inauguration of the temple was required, it appears, so that it would take place \"in the seventh month, on the festival.\" There can be no doubt that the festival referred to was the New Year festival, in ac- cordance with the commandments concerning holy days and festivals pronounced in the biblical Book of Leviticus. \"These are the appointed festiv als of Yahweh,\" the pream- ble to chapter 23 states: the observance of the seventh day as the Sabbath is just the first of holy days to be held in intervals of multiples of seven days or that were to last seven days, culminating with the festivals of the seventh month: New Year's Day, the Day of Atonement, and the Feast of Booths. In Mesopotamia by that time Babylon and Assyria had supplanted Sumer, and the New Year festival was cele- brated—as the month's name i ndicated—in the first month, called Nissan, which coincided with the spring equinox. The reasons why the Israelites were commanded to celebrate the New Year in the seventh month, coinciding with the autumnal equinox, remain unexplained in the Bible. But we may find a clue in the fact th at the biblical narrative does not call this month by its Ba bylonian-Assyrian name, Tish- rei, but by the enigmatic name Etanim. No satisfactory explanation for this name has been found so far; but a solution does occur to us: in view of all the above listed similarities between the king-priest as a shepherd and the circumstances of the establishment of a new capital and the construction of a residence for Yahweh in the desert and in"},{"pageNumber":89,"pageContent":"DUR.AN.KI—The \"Bond Heaven-Earth\" 93 Jerusalem, the clue to the month's name should also be sought in the Tale of Etana. For does not the name used in the Bible, Etanim, simply stem from the name Etana? The name Etan as a personal name, one may note, was not uncommon among the Hebrews, meaning \"heroic, mighty.\" The celestial alignments in Kish, we have noted, were expressed not only in the temple 's solar orientation but also in some relationship with seven planetary \"gods\" in the heavens. It is noteworthy that in a discussion by August Wiinsche of the similarities between Solomon's edifices in Jerusalem and the Mesopotamian \"portrait of the heavens\" (Ex Oriente Lux, vol, 2) he cited the rabbinic reference— as in the Tale of Etana—to the \"seven stars that indicate time\"—Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sun. and Venus. There are thus plenty of clues and indications con- firming the celestial-calendrical aspects of Solomon's Tem- ple—aspects that link it to traditions and orientations established millennia earlier, in Sumer. This is reflected not only in the orientation, but also in the temple's tripartite division; it emulated the traditional temple plans that began in Mesopotamia millennia earlier. Gunter Martiny, who in the 1930 s led the studies regarding the architecture and astronomi cal orientation of Mesopo- tamian temples (Die Gegensdt ze im Babylonischen und As- syrischen Tempelbau and other studies) sketched thus (Fig. 45a) the basic tripartite layout of \"cult structures\": a rec- tangular anteroom, an elongated ritual hall, and a square Holy of Holies. Walter Andrae (Des Gotteshaus und die Urformen des Bauens) pointed out that in Assyria the tem- ple's entrance was flanked by two pylons (Fig. 45b); this was reflected in Solomon's Temple, where the entrance was flanked by two freestanding pillars (see Fig. 44b). The detailed architectural and construction information in the Bible in respect to So lomon's Temple calls its ante- room Ulam, its ritual hall Hekhal, and its holiest part Dvir. The latter, meaning \"Where the speaking takes place,\" no doubt reflected the fact that Yahweh spoke to Moses from the Ark of the Covenant, the voice coming from where the"},{"pageNumber":90,"pageContent":"94 WHEN TIME BEGAN wings of the Cherubim were touching; and the Ark was placed in the Temple as the only artifact in the innermost enclosure, the Holy of Ho lies or Dvir. The terminology used for the two foreparts, scholars have recognized, comes from the Sumerian (via Akkadian): E-gal and Ulammu. This essential tripartite divi sion, adopted la ter on else- where (e.g. the Zeus temple in Olympia, Fig. 46a, or the Canaanite one at Tainat in Upper Syria, Fig. 46b), was in reality a continuation that bega n with the most ancient tem- ples, the ziggurats of Sumer, where the way to the ziggurat's top, via a stairway, led through tw o shrines, an outer shrine with two pylons in front of it, and a prayer room—as drawn by G.

Texts de scribing tem- ple rituals in Uruk mention golden libation vessels, golden trays, and golden censers; su ch objects were found in ar- chaeological excavations.

Thus, a king of Isin (Ishbi-Erra) called the nineteenth year of his reign \"Year in which the throne in the Great House of the goddess Ninlil was made''; and a nother ruler of Isin (Ishme- Dagan) named one of his regnal years \"Year in which Ishme-Dagan made a bed of gold and silver for the goddess Ninlil.\" But having been built of bricks made of clay, the temples"},{"pageNumber":93,"pageContent":"DUR.AN.KI—The \"Bond Heaven-Earth\" 97 of Mesopotamia fell into disrepair as time went by, fre- quently as the result of earthquakes. Constant maintenance and repairs were required, and re pairs or reconstruction of the gods' houses, rather than th e offering of new furnishings, began to fill the Date Formulas. Thus, the years-list for the famed Hammurabi, king of Babylon, began with the des- ignation of Year One as the \"Year in which Hammurabi became king,\" and \"Year in wh ich the laws were pro- mulgated\" for Year Two. Year Four, however, was already designated \"Year in which Hammu rabi built a wall for the sacred precinct.\" A successor of Hammurabi in Babylon, the king Shamshi-Iluna, named his eighteenth year as the \"Year in which the reconstr uction work was done on the E.BABBAR of the god Utu in Sippar\" (E.BABBAR, mean- ing \"House of the Bright One,\" was a temple dedicated to the \"Sun-god\" Utu/Shamash). Sumerian, then Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian kings recorded in their inscriptions with great pride how they repaired, embellished, or rebuilt the sacred temples and their precincts; archaeologica l excavations not only uncov- ered such inscriptions but also corroborated the claims made therein. In Nippur, for example, archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania f ound in the 1880s evidence of repair and maintenance work in the sacred precinct in thirty- five feet of debris piled up during some four thousand years above a brick pavement built by the Akkadian king Naram- Sin circa 2250 B.C. and another accumulation of debris of over thirty feet below the pavement from earlier times down to virgin soil (which were not excavated and examined at the time). Returning to Nippur half a century later, a joint expedition of the University of Pennsylvania and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chi cago spent many digging seasons working to unearth the Temple of Enlil in Nippur's sacred precinct. The excavators found fi ve successive constructions between 2200 b.c. and 600 B.C., the latter having its floor some twenty feet above the former. The even earlier tem- ples, the archaeologists' report noted at the time, were still"},{"pageNumber":94,"pageContent":"98 WHEN TIME BEGAN to be dug for. The report also noted that the live temples were \"built one above the othe r on exactly the same plan.\" The discovery that later temples were erected upon the foundations of earlier temples in strict adherence to the original plans was reconfirmed at other ancient sites in Mesopotamia. The rule applie d even to enlargement of temples—even if more than once, as was found at Eridu (Fig. 49); in all instances the original axis and orientation were retained. Unlike the Egypt ian temples whose solstitial orientation had to be realigne d from time to time because of the change in the Earth's tilt, Mesopotamian equinoctial temples needed no adjustment in their orientation because geographic north and geographic east, by definition, re- mained unchanged no matter how the Earth's tilt had changed: the Sun always pass ed over the equator at \"equi- nox\" times, rising on such days precisely in the east. The obligation to adhere to the \"olden plans\" was spelled out in an inscription on a tablet found in Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, among the ruins of a rebuilt temple.

Describing how he had unearthed the \"ancient mound,\" he stated: \"I dug down to the level of the water, for 120 measures into the depth I penetrated. I found the foundations of the god Ninib, my lord ... I constructed thereon, with firm brickwork, the temple of Ninib, my lord.\" It was done, the king pr ayed, so that the god Ninib (an epithet for the god Ninurta) \"may command that my days be long.\" Such a blessing, the king hoped, would follow the decision by the go d, at a time of his own choosing—\"at his heart's desire\"—to come and reside in the rebuilt temple: \"When the lord Ninib shall take up habitation, forever, in his pure temple, his dwelling place.\" It is a prayed-for e xpectation-cum-invitation not unlike the one expressed by King Solomon when the First Temple was completed. Indeed, the obligatory adherenc e to the earlier site, ori- entation, and layout of the temple s in the ancient Near East, no matter how long the interval or how extensive the repairs or rebuilding had to be, is exemplifie d by the successive temples in Jerusalem. The First Temple was destroyed by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar in 587 B.C.; but after Babylon fell to the Achaemenid Persians, the Persian king Cyrus issued an edict permitting the return of Jewish exiles to Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the temple by them. The rebuilding, significantly, began w ith the erection of an altar (where the first one used to be) \"when the seventh month commenced,\" i.e. on the day of the New Year (and the sacrifices continued until the Feast of Booths).

The Bible constantly saw the Creator's awesomeness in the \"Host of Heaven\"—the myri ads of stars and planets, moons and moonlets that twinkle in the Vault of Heaven as night falls. \"The heavens bespeak the glory of the Lord and the vault of heaven reveals His handiwork,\" the Psalmist wrote. The \"heavens\" thus desc ribed were the nightly skies; and the glory they bespoke was conveyed to Mankind by astronomer-priests. It was th ey who made sense of the countless celestial bodies, recogni zed stars by their groups, distinguished between the immovable stars and the wan- dering planets, knew the Sun's and Moon's movements, and kept track of Time—the cy cle of sacred days and fes- tivals, the calendar. The sacred days began at dusk on the previous evening— a custom still retained in the Jewish calendar.

Then, putting on a garment of pure white linen, he could enter into the presence of the great god (Marduk in Babylon) and recite prescribed prayers in the Holy of Holies of the ziggurat (the Esagil in Babyl on). The recitation, which no one else was to hear, was deemed so secret that after the text lines in which the prayer was inscribed, the priestly scribe inserted the followi ng admonition: \"Twenty-one lines: secrets of th e Esagil temple. Whoever reveres the god Marduk shall show them to no one except the Urigallu priest.\" After he finished reciting the secret prayer, the Urigallu priest opened the temple's gate to let in the Eribbiti priests, who proceeded to \"perform th eir rites, in the traditional manner,\" joined by musicians and singers. The text then details the rest of the duties of the Urigallu priest on that night. \"On the third day of the month Nisannu\" at a time after sunset too damaged in the insc ription to read, the Urigallu priest was again required to perform certain rites and rec- itations; this he had to do thro ughout the night, until \"three hours after sunrise,\" when he was to instruct artisans in the making of images of metal a nd precious stones to be used in ceremonies on the sixth day. On the fourth day, at \"three and one third hours of the night,\" the rituals repeated them- selves but the prayers now e xpanded to include a separate service for Marduk's spouse, the goddess Sarpanit. The prayers then paid homage to the other gods of Heaven and Earth and asked for the granting of long life to the king and prosperity to the people of Babylon. It was thereafter that the advent of the New Year was directly linked to the Time of the Equinox in the constella tion of the Ram: the heliacal rising of the Ram Star at dawn. Pronouncing the blessing \"Iku-star\" upon the \"Esagil, im age of heaven and earth,\" the rest of the day was spent in prayers, singing and music playing.

The text which we have been following (per F. Thureau-Dangin, Rituels accadiens and E. Ebeling in A ltorientalische Texte zum alien Testament) deals, however, only with the duties of the Uri- gallu priest; and we read that on that night the priest, at \"four hours of the night,\" rec ited twelve times the prayer \"My Lord, is he not my Lord\" in honor of Marduk, and invoked the Sun, the Moon, and th e twelve constellations of the zodiac. A prayer to the goddess followed, in which her epithet, DAM.KLANNA (\" Mistress of Earth and Heaven\") revealed the ritual's Sumerian origin. The prayer likened her to the planet Venus \"which shines brilliantly among the stars,\" naming seven constellations. After these prayers, which stressed the astronomical-calendrical aspects of the occasion, singers and musicians performed \"in the traditional manner\" and a breakfast was served to Marduk and Sarpanit \"two hours after sunrise.\" The Babylonian New Year rituals evolved from the Su- merian AKITI (\"On Earth Build Life\") festival whose roots can be traced to the state visit by Anu and his spouse Antu to Earth circa 3800 B.C., when (a s the texts atte st) the zodiac was ruled by the Bull of Heav en, the Age of Taurus. We have suggested that it was then that Counted Time, the calendar of Nippur, was granted to Mankind. Inevitably, that entailed celestial observati ons and thus led to the cre- ation of a class of trained astronomer-priests.

Of the many volumes of the archaeolog ists' reports (Ausgrabungen der Deuischen Forschungsgemein schaft in Uruk-Warka), of particular interest to the remarkable correlation of ancient texts and modern excavations are the second (Archaische Texte aus Uruk) and third (T opographie von Uruk) volumes by Adam Falkenstein. Surprisingly, the texts on the clay tablets (whose scribal colophons identify them as co pies of earlier originals) clearly describe two sets of rituals—one taking place in the month Nissan (the month of the spring equinox) and the other in the month Tishrit (the month of the autumnal equi- nox); the former was to become the Babylonian and Assyrian New Year, and the latter was reta ined in the Jewish calendar following the biblical commandment to celebrate the New Year \"in the seventh month,\" Tishrei, While the reason for this diversity still mystifies scholars, Ebeling noted that the Nissan texts appear to have been better preserved than the Tishrei texts which are mostly fragmented, suggesting a clear bias on the part of the later temple scribes; and Falkenstein has noted that th e Nissan and Tishrei rituals, seemingly identical, were not really so; the former stressed the various celestial observations , the latter the rituals within the Holy of Holies and its anteroom.

As these compositions ('To the one who grows bright, the heavenly planet of the Lord Anu\" and \"The Creator's image has arisen\") were recited from the ziggurat, wine was served to the gods from a golden libation vessel. Then, in succession, the priests announced the appearance of Ju- piter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn, Mars, and the Moon. The ceremony of washing the hands followed, with water poured from seven golden pitchers honoring the six luminaries of the night plus the Sun of daytim e. A large torch of \"naphtha fire in which spices were inserted\" was lighted; all the priests sang the hymn Kakkab Anu etellu shamame (\"The planet of Anu rose in the sky\"), and the banquet could begin. Afterward Anu and Antu retired for the night and leading gods were assigned as watchmen until dawn. Then, \"forty minutes after sunrise, \" Anu and Antu were awak- ened \"bringing to an end their overnight stay.\" The morning proceedings began outside the temple, in the courtyard of the Bit Akitu (\"House of the New Year Festival\" in Akkadian). Enlil and Enki were awaiting Anu at the \"golden supporter,\" standing by or holding several objects; the Akkadian terms, whose precise meaning re- mains elusive, are best translated as \"that which opens up the secrets,\" \"the Sun disks\" (plural!) and \"the splendid/ shining posts.\" Anu then cam e into the courtyard accom- panied by gods in procession. \"He stepped up to the Great Throne in the Akitu courtyard, and sat upon it facing the"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"Keepers of the Secrets 113 rising Sun.\" He was then joined by Enlil, who sat on Anus right, and Enki, who sat on his left; Antu, Nannar/Sin, and Inanna/Ishtar then took places behind the seated Anu. The statement that Anu seated himself \"facing the rising Sun\" leaves no doubt that the ceremony involved a deter- mination of a moment connected with sunrise on a particular day—the first day of Nissan (the spring Equinox Day) or the first day of Tishrei (the autumnal Equinox Day). It was only when this sunrise ceremo ny was completed, that Anu was led by one of the gods and by the High Priest to the BARAG.GAL—the \"Holy of Holies\" inside the temple. (BARAG means \"inner sanctum, screened-off place\" and GAL means \"great, foremost.\" The term evolved to Baragu/Barukhu/Parakhu in Akka dian with the meanings \"inner sanctum. Holy of Holies\" as well as the screen which hides it. This term appears in the Bible as the Hebrew word Parokhet. which was both the word for the Holy of Holies in the temple and for the screen that separated it from the anteroom. The traditions and ri tuals that began in Sumer were thus carried on both phys ically and linguistically.) Another text from Uruk, instru cting the priests regarding daily sacrifices, calls for the sacrifice of \"fat clean rams, whose horns and hooves arc whol e,\" to the deities Anu and Antu, \"to the planets Jupiter, Venus, Mercury, Saturn and Mars; to the Sun as it rise s, and to the Moon on its ap- pearance.\" The text then explains what \"appearance\" means in respect to each one of these seven celestial bodies: it meant the moment when they come to rest in the instru- ment which is \"in the midst of the Bit Ma hazzat\" (\"House of Viewing\"). Further instructio ns suggest that this enclo- sure was \"on the topmost stage of the temple-tower of the god Anu.\" Depictions have been found that show divine beings flank- ing a temple entrance and holding up poles to which ringlike objects are attached.

In their serrated superstruc- tures (Fig. 59c) these facilities, high up temple gateways or in the open courty ards of temple prec incts, created sub- stitutes for the rising stages of the ziggurats as ziggurats gave way to the more easily built flat-roofed temples. The Assyrian inscription also serves as a reminder that not only the Sun at dawn, and the accompanying heliacal rising of stars and planets, but also the nightly Host of Heaven were observed by the astronomer-priests. A perfect example of such dual observations concerns the planet Ve- nus, which because of its much shorter orbit time around the Sun than Earth's appears to an observer from Earth half the time as an evening star a nd half the time as a morning star. A Sumerian hymn to Inanna/lshtar, whose celestial counterpart was the planet we call Venus, offered adoration to the planet first as an eveni ng star, then as a morning star: The holy one stands ou t in the clear sky; Upon all the lands and all the people the goddess looks sweetly from heaven's midst. . . At evetime a radiant star, a great light that fills the sky; The Lady of the Evening, Inanna, is lofty on the horizon. After describing how both people and beasts retire for the night \"to their sleeping place s\" after the appearance of the Evening Star, the hymn continues to offer adoration to Inanna/Venus as the Morning Star: \"She made the morning come forth, the bright daylig ht; and in the bedchambers sweet sleep has come to an end.\" While such texts throw light on the role of the ziggurats and their rising stages in the observation of the night sky, they also raise the intriguing question: did the astronomer- priests observe the heavens with the naked eye, or did they have instruments for pinpointi ng the celestial moments of"},{"pageNumber":112,"pageContent":"118 WHEN TIME BEGAN appearances?

The hornlike devices seen in Fig. 60b serve as a link to Egyptian depictions of instruments for astronomical obser- vations associated with temples. There, viewing devices consisting of a circular part em placed in the center of a pair of horns atop a high pole (Fig. 61a ) were depicted as raised in front of the temples to a god called Min.

We believe that it was a hand -held viewing instrument that represented the cres cents of the Moon. Was Min perhaps another inca rnation of Thoth, who was firmly linked to the lunar calendar of Egypt? What is certain is that Min was deemed to be related celestially to the Bull of Heaven, the zodiacal cons tellation of Taurus, whose age lasted from about 4400 b.c. to about 2100 B.C. The viewing devices that we have seen in the Mesopotamian depictions and those associated with Min in Egypt thus represent some of the oldest astronomical instruments on Earth. According to the Uruk ritual texts, an instrument called Itz Pashshuri was used for the planetary observations. Thureau-Dangin translated the term simply as \"an appa- ratus\"; but the term literally meant an instrument \"that solves, that unlocks secrets.\" Was this instrument one and the same as the circular objects that topped poles or posts, or was the term a generic one, meaning \"astronomical in- strument\" in general? We cannot be sure because both texts and depictions have been f ound, from Sumerian times on, that attest to the existence of a variety of such instruments. The simplest astronomical device was the gnomon (from the Greek \"that which knows\"), an instrument which tracked the Sun's movements by the shadow cast by an upright pole; the shadow's le ngth (growing smaller as the Sun rose to midday) indicate d the hourly time and the di- rection (where the Sun's rays fi rst appeared and last cast a shadow) could indicate the seasons. Archaeologists found such devices at Egyptian sites (Fig. 62a) which were pre- marked to show time (Fig. 62b) . Since at solstice times the shadows grew inconveniently long, the flat devices were improved by inclining the horizontal scale, thereby reducing the shadow's length (Fig. 62c). In time, this led to actual structural shadow clocks which were built as stairways that indicated time as the shadow moved up or down the stairs (Fig. 62d). Shadow clocks also developed into sundials when the upright pole was provided with a semicircular base on which an angular scale was marked. Archaeologists have found"},{"pageNumber":115,"pageContent":"Keepers of the Secrets 121 such instruments at Egyptian s ites (Fig. 62e), but the oldest device so far discovered comes from the Canaanite city of Gezer in Israel; it has the regul ar angular scale on its face and a scene of the worship of the Egyptian god Thoth on the reverse side (Fig. 62f). Th is sundial, made of ivory, bears the cartouche of the Pharaoh Mercnptah, who reigned in the thirteenth century B.C. Shadow clocks are mentioned in the Bible. The Book of Job refers to portable gnomons , probably of the kind shown in 62a, that were used in the fields to tell time, when it observes that the hired laborer \"earnestly desireth the shadow\" that indicated it was time to collect his daily wages (Job 7:2).

So the prophet pre- dicted a divine omen: inst ead of moving forward, the shadow of the Temple's sun clock would be \"brought ten degrees backward.'' The Hebrew text uses the term Ma'aloth Ahaz, the \"stairs\" or \"degrees\" of the King Ahaz. Some scholars interpret the statement as referring to a sundial with an angular sc ale (\"degrees\") while others think it was an actual stairway (as in Fig. 62d). Perhaps it was a combination of the two, an early version of the sun clock that still exists in Jaipur, India (Fig. 63). Be it as it may, scholars by an d large agree that the sun clock that served as an omen for the miraculous recovery of the king was in all probab ility a gift presented to the Judean King Ahaz by the Assyri an king Tiglatpileser II in the eighth century b.c. In spite of the Greek name {gnomon) of the device (whose use contin ued into the Middle Ages), it was not a Greek invention nor, it seems, even an Egyptian one. According to Pliny the Elder, the first-century savant, the science of gnomonics was first described by Anaxi- mander of Miletus who possessed an instrument called \"shadow hunter.\" But Anaximan der himself, in his work (in Greek) Upon Nature (547 B.C.) wrote that he had ob- tained the gnomon from Babylon.

By the end of the second millennium B.C. the Phoe- nicians of northern Canaan had become the best navigators of the ancient world; plying the trade routes, one may say, between the stone pillars of Byblos and the ones in the British Isles, their foremost western outpost was Carthage (Keret-Hadash, \"New City\"). Th ere they adopted as their main divine symbol the depi ction of an astronomical in- strument; before it began to appear on stelae and even tomb- stones, it was shown in asso ciation with two double-ringed pillars that flanked the entrance to a temple (Fig. 65b)—as earlier in Mesopotamia. The ring flanked by two opposite- facing crescents suggests observations of the Sun and of the Moon's phases. A \"votive tablet\" found in th e ruins of a Phoenician settlement in Sicily (Fig. 66a ) depicts a scene in an open courtyard, suggesting that the Sun's movements rather than the night sky are the astronom ical objective. The ringed pillar and an attar stand in fr ont of a three-columned struc- ture; there, too, is the view ing device: a ring between two short vertical posts placed on a horizontal bar and mounted atop a triangular base. This pa rticular shape for observations of the Sun brings to mind the Egyptian hieroglyph for \"ho- rizon\"—the Sun rising between two mountains (Fig. 66b). Indeed, the Phoenician device (scholars refer to it as a \"cult symbol\") suggesting a pair of ra ised hands is related to the Egyptian hieroglyph for Ka (Fig. 66c) that represented the pharaoh's spirit or alter ego fo r the Afterlife journey to the abode of the gods on the \"Pla net of millions of years.\" That the origin of the Ka was, to begin with, an astronomical instrument is suggested by an archaic Egyptian depiction (Fig. 66d) of a viewing device in front of a temple.

The Egyptian Book of the Dead has not reached us in the form of a cohesive book, assuming that a composition that might be called a \"book\" truly existed; rather, it has been collated from the many quotatio ns from it that cover the walls of royal tombs. But a complete book did reach us from ancient Egypt, and it shows that an ascent heavenward to attain immortality was deemed connected with the calendar. The book we refer to is the Book of Enoch, an ancient composition known from two sets of versions, an Ethiopic one that scholars identify as \"1 Enoch,\" and a Slavonic version that is identified as \"2 Enoch,\" and which is also known as The Book of the Secrets of Enoch. Both versions, of which copied manuscripts have been found mostly in Greek and Latin translations, are based on early sources that enlarged on the short bibl ical mention that Enoch, the seventh Patriarch after Adam, did not die because, at age 365, \"he walked with God\"—taken heavenward to join the deity. Enlarging on this brief statement in the Bible (Genesis chapter 5), the books describe in detail Enoch's two celestial journeys—the first to learn the heavenly secrets, return, and impart the knowledge to his so ns; and the second to stay put in the heavenly abode.

In es sence, the secr ets that were imparted to Enoch and by him to his sons to keep, were the knowledge of astronomy as it related to the calendar. The author of The Book of th e Secrets of Enoch, the so- called Slavonic version, is beli eved to have been (to quote R.H. Charles, The Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the Old Testament) \"a Jew who lived in Egypt, probably in Alexandria\" some time around th e beginning of the Chris- tian era. This is how the book concludes: Enoch was born on the sixth day of the month Tsivan, and lived three hundred and sixty-five years. He was taken up to heaven on the first day of the month Tsivan and remained in heaven sixty days. He wrote all these signs of all creation which the Lord created, and wrote three hundred and si xty-six books, and handed them over to his sons. He was taken up [again] to heaveivon the sixth day of the month Tsivan, on the very day and hour when he was born. Methosalam and his brethren , all the sons of Enoch, made haste and erected an altar at the place called Ahuzan, whence and where Enoch had been taken up to heaven. Not only the contents of the Book of Enoch—astronomy as it relates to the calenda r—but also the very life and ascension of Enoch are thus repl ete with calendrical aspects. His years on Earth, 365, are of course the number of whole days in a solar year ; his birth and depart ure from Earth are linked to a specific month, even the day of the month.

Frag- ments of Enoch books were discovered among the Dead Sea scrolls. The astronomical-cal endrical tale of Enoch thus goes back into great antiquity—pe rhaps, as the Bible asserts, to pre-Diluvial times. Now that it is certain that the biblical tales of the Deluge and the Nefilim (the biblical Anunnaki), of the creation of the Adam and of Earth itself, and of ante-Diluvial patriarchs, are abbreviated renderings of or iginal earlier Sumerian texts that recorded all that, it is al most certain that the biblical \"Enoch\" was the equivalent of the Sumerian first priest, EN.ME.DUR.AN.KI (\"High Priest of the ME's of the Bond Heaven-Earth\"), the man from the city Sippar taken heavenward to be taught the secrets of Heaven and Earth, of divination, and of the calenda r. It was with him that the generations of astronomer-priests , of Keepers of the Secrets, began. The granting by Min to the Egyptian astronomer-priests of the viewing device was not an extraordinary action. A Sumerian sculpture molded in relief shows a great god grant- ing a hand-held astronomical device to a king-priest (Fig. 68). Numerous other Sumerian depictions show a king being granted a measuring rod and a rolled measuring cord for the purpose of assuring the correct astronomical orientation of temples, as we have seen in Fig. 54. Such depictions only enhance the textual evidence that is explicit about the manner in which the line of astronomer-priests began. Did Man, however, become ha ughty enough to forget all that, to start thinking he had attained all that knowledge by himself? Millennia ago the i ssue was tackled when Job was asked to admit that not Man but El, \"the Lofty One,\" was the Keeper of the Secrets of Heaven and Earth: Say, if thou knowest science: Who hath measured the Earth, that it be known? Who hath stretched a cord upon it? By what were its platforms wrought?

The records of Sumer leave no doubt that the teachers, the original Keepers of the Secrets, were the Anunnaki. The leader of the first team of Anunnaki to come to Earth, splashing down in the waters of the Persian Gulf, was E.A— he \"whose home is water.\" He was the chief scientist of the Anunnaki and his initial task was to obtain the gold they needed by extracting it from the gulfs waters—a task re- quiring knowledge in physics, chemistry, metallurgy.

More than one hundred ME's, those enigmatic objects that, like computer disks, held the knowledge arranged by subject, were kept by him in his center, Eridu, in Sumer; at the southern tip of Africa, a scientific station held \"the tablet of wisdom.\" All that knowledge was in time shared by Enki with his six sons, each of whom became expert in one or more of these scientific secrets. Enki's half brother EN.LIL —\"Lord of the Command\"— arrived next on Earth. Under his leadership the number of Anunnaki on Earth increased to six hundred; in addition, three hundred IGI.GI (\"Those who observe and see\") re- mained in Earth orbit, manni ng orbiting stations, operating shuttlecraft to and from spacecr aft. He was a great space- man, organizer, disciplinarian. He established the first Mission Control Center in NI.IBRU, known to us by its Akkadian name Nippur, and the communication links with the Home Planet, th e DUR.AN.KI—\"Bond Heaven- Earth.\" The space charts, the ce lestial data, the secrets of astronomy were his to know and keep.

Shamash (Utu in Sumerian) was usually depicted (see Fig. 54) holding the measuring rod and cord; Adad (Ishkur in Sumerian) was shown holding the forked lightni ng. A depiction on the royal seal of an Assyrian king (T ukulti-Ninurta I) shows the king being introduced to the two great gods, perhaps for the purpose of granting him the kno wledge they had once given to Enmeduranki (Fig. 69).

One cannot rule out the possibility that, as Enmeduranki and Enoch, Adapa too was the seventh in a line of sages, the Sages of Eridu, and thus a nother version of the Sumerian memory echoed in the biblical Enoch record. According to this tale, seven Wise Men were trained in Eridu, Enki's city; their epithets and partic ular knowledge varied from version to version. Rykle Borg er, examining this tale in light of the Enoch traditions (\"Die Beschworungsserie Bit Meshri und die Himmelfahrt Henochs\" in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, vol. 33), was especially fascinated by the inscription on the third tabl et of the series of Assyrian Oath Incantations. In it the na me of each sage is given and his main call on fame is explained; it says thus of the seventh: \"Utu-abzu, he who to heaven ascended.\" Citing a second such text, R. Borger concluded that this seventh sage, whose name combined that of Utu/Shamash with the Lower World (Abzu) domain of Enki, was the Assyrian \"Enoch.\" According to the Assyrian re ferences to the wisdom of Adapa, he composed a book of sciences titled U.SAR d ANUM d ENLILA—\"Writings regarding Time; from di- vine Anu and divine Enlil.\" Ad apa, thus, is credited with writing Mankind's first book of astronomy and the calendar. When Enmeduranki ascended to heaven to be taught the various secrets, his patron gods were Utu/Shamash and Adad/Ishkur, a grandson and a son of Enlil. His ascent was thus under Enlilite aegis. Of Adapa we re ad that when Enki sent him heavenward to Anu's abode, the two gods who acted as his chaperons were Dumuzi and Gizzida, two sons of Ea/Enki. There, \"Adapa from the horizon of heaven to the zenith of heaven cast a glance; he saw its awesome- ness\"—words reflected in the Books of Enoch. At the end of the visit Anu denied him ev erlasting life; instead, \"the priesthood of the city of Ea to glorify in future\" he decreed for Adapa.

This conclusion, supported by later writings and events, is re flected in the fact that we find the leading Anunnaki havi ng each their talents, spe- cialty, and specific assignments. As we continue to examine these specialties and assign- ments, we will find that the close relationship of temple- astronomy-calendar was also expre ssed in the fact that sev- eral deities, in Sumeras in E gypt, combined these specialties in their attributes. And since the ziggurats and temples served as observatories—to de termine the passage of both Earthly and Celestial Times—the deities with the astronom- ical knowledge were also the ones with the knowledge of orienting and designing the te mples and their layouts. \"Say, if thou knowest science; Who hath measured the Earth, that it be known? Who hath stretched a cord upon it?\" So was Job asked when called upon to admit that God, not Man, was the ultimate Keeper of the Secrets. In the scene of the introduction of the king-priest to Shamash (Fig. 54), the purpose or essence of the occurrence is indicated by two Divine Cordholders. The two cords they stretch to a ray-emitting planet form an angle, suggesting measure- ment not so much of distance as of orientation. An Egyptian depiction of a similar motif, a scene painted on the Papyrus of Queen Nejmet, shows how tw o cordholders measured an angle based on the planet called \"Red Eye of Horus\" (Fig. 70). The stretching of cords to determine the proper astro- nomical orientation of a temp le was the task of a goddess called Sesheta in Egypt. Sh e was on the one hand a Goddess of the Calendar; her epithets we re \"the great one, lady of letters, mistress of the Hous e of Books\" and her symbol was the stylus made of a palm branch, which in Egyptian hieroglyphs stood for \"counting the years.\" She was de- picted with a seven-rayed star within the Heavenly Bow on her head. She was the Goddess of Construction, but only (as pointed out by Sir Norman Lockyer in The Dawn of"},{"pageNumber":131,"pageContent":"Keepers of the Secrets 137 Figure 70 Astronomy) for the purpose of determining the orientation of temples. Such an orientation was not haphazard or a matter left to guesswork. The Egyptians relied on divine guidance to determine the orient ation and major axis of their temples; the task was assigned to Sesheta. Auguste Mariette, reporting on his finds at Dend erah where depictions and inscriptions pertaining to Se sheta were discovered, said it was she who \"made certain that the construction of sacred shrines was carried out exactly according to the directions contained in the Divine Books.\" Determining the correct orient ation called for an elaborate ceremony named Put-ser, meaning \"the stretching of the cord.\" The goddess sank a pole in the ground by hammering it down with a golden club; the king, guided by her, sank another pole. A cord was then stretched between the two poles, indicating the proper orie ntation; it wa s determined by the position of a specific st ar. A study by Z. Zaba pub- lished by the Czechoslovak Acad emy of Sciences {Archiv Orientalni, Supplement 2, 1953) concluded that the cere- mony revealed knowledge of the phenomenon of precession, and thus of the zodiacal divisi on of the celestial circle.

The event throws light on many matters of gods and men thanks to the fact that the ki ng entrusted with the task, Gudea of Lagash, wrote it all down in great detail on two large clay cylinders. In spite of the immensity of the task, he realized that it was a great honor and a unique opportunity to have his name and deeds remembered for all time, for not many kings were so entrus ted; in fact, royal records (since found by archaeologists) sp oke of at least one instance when a famous king (Naram-Sin), otherwise beloved by the gods, was again and again refuse d permission to engage in the building of a new temple (such a situation arose mil- lennia later in the case of King David in Jerusalem). Shrewdly expressing his grat itude to his god by inscribing laudatory statements on statues of himself (Fig. 72) which Gudea then emplaced in the new temple, Gudea managed to leave behind a rather substantial amount of written in- formation which explains th e How and What for of the sacred precincts and temples of the Anunnaki. As the Foremost Son of Enlil by his half sister Ninharsag and thus the heir apparent, Ni nurta shared his father's rank of fifty (that of Anu being th e highest, sixty, and that of Anu's other son, Enki, being forty) and so it was a simple choice to call Ninurta's ziggur at E.NINNU, the \"House of Fifty.\" Throughout the millennia Ninurta was a faithful aide to his father, carrying out dutifully each task assigned to him.

Ninurta, however, was not just a warrior. In the aftermath of the Deluge it was he who dammed the mountain passes to prevent more flooding in th e plain between the Euphrates and Tigris rivers and who had arranged extens ive drainage works there to make the plain habitable again. Thereafter, he oversaw the introduction of organized agriculture to the region and was fondly nickname d by the Sumerians Urash— \"He of the Plough.\" When the Anunnaki decided to give Kingship to Mankind, it was Ni nurta who was assigned to organize it at the first City of Men, Kish. And when, after the upheavals caused by Marduk, the lands quieted down circa 2250 B.C., it was again Ni nurta who restored order and kingship from his \"cult city,\" Lagash. His reward was permission from Enlil to build a brand new temple in Lagash. It was not that he was \"homeless\"; he already had a temple in Kish, and a temple within the sacred precinct in Nippur, next to his father's ziggurat. He also had his own temple in the Girsu, the sacred precinct of his \"cult center,\" the city of Lagash.

When Ninurta defeated the Enki'ites he entered the Great Pyramid and for the first time r ealized its intricate and amaz- ing inner architecture in addition to its outer grandeur. The information provided by the inscriptions of Gudea suggests that Ninurta had nourished a de sire to have a ziggurat of similar greatness and intricacy ever since his Egyptian tour of duty. Now that he had once again pacified Sumer and attained for Lagash the status of a royal capital, he asked Enlil once again for permission to build a new E.N1NNU, a new \"House of Fifty,\" in the Girsu precinct of Lagash. This time, his wish was to be fulfilled. That his wish was granted should not be downplayed as a matter of course. We read, for example, in the Canaanite \"myths\" regarding the god Ba'al (\"Lord\"), that for his role in defeating the enemies of El (\"The Lofty One.\" the supreme deity) he sought El's permission to build a House on the crest of Mount Zaphon in Lebanon. Ba'al had sought this permission before, and was repeatedly turned down; he had repeatedly complained to \"Bull El, his father\": No house has Ba'al like the gods, no precinct like the children of Asherah; the abode of El is th e shelter of his son. Now he asked Asherah, El's spouse, to intercede for him; and Asherah finally convinced El to give his permission. Added to the previous arguments was a new one: Ba'al, she said, could then \"observe the seasons\" in his new House— make there celestial observations for a calendar. But though a god, Ba'al could not just go ahead and build his temple-abode. The plans had to be drawn and construc- tion supervised by the Koth ar-Hasis, the \"Skilled and Knowing\" Craftsman of the Gods.

(quoting earlier Phoenician historians) compared Kothar-Hasis with the Greek divine craftsman He phaestus (who built the tern-"},{"pageNumber":139,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 145 pie-abode of Zeus) or with Thoth, the Egyptian god of knowledge, crafts, and magic. The Canaanite texts indeed state that Ba'al sent emissaries to Egypt to fetch Kothar- Hasis, but found him eventually in Crete. No sooner, however, did Kothar-Hasis arrive than Ba'al got into fierce arguments with him regarding the temple's architecture. He wanted, it appears, a House of only two parts, not the customary three—an Hekhal and a Bamtim (a raised stage). The sharpest argument was over a funnellike window or skylight which Kothar-Hasis claimed had to be positioned \"in the House\" but Ba'al vehemently argued should be located somewhere el se. The argument is given the space of many verses in the text to show its ferocity and importance; it involved s houting and spitting . . . The reasons for the argument regarding the skylight and its location remain obscure; our guess is that it might have been connected with the temple 's orientation. The statement by Asherah that the temple would enable observance of the seasons suggests an orientati on requiring certain astronom- ical observations. Ba'al, on th e other hand, as the Canaanite text later reveals, was planning to install in the temple a secret communication device that would enable him to seize power over other gods. To that purpose Ba'al \"stretched a cord, strong and supple,\" from the peak of Zaphon (\"North\") to Kadesh (\"the Sacred Place\") in the south, in the Sinai desert. The orientation in the end re mained the way the divine architect, Kothar-Hasis, wanted it. \"Thou shalt heed my words,\" he told Ba'al emphatically, and \"as for Ba'al, his house was thus built.\" If, as one must assume, the later temples atop the Baalbek platform were built according to that olden plan, then we find that the orientation Kothar- Hasis had insisted upon resulted in a temple with an east- west axis (see Fig. 25).

By his side was the Divine Storm Bird; Like a devouring storm under his feet two lions crouched, on the right and on the left. He commanded me to build his temple. A celestial omen then o ccurred whose meaning, Gudea told the oracle goddess, he did not understand: the Sun upon Kishar, Jupiter, was suddenly seen on the horizon. A woman then appeared who gave Gudea other celestial directions: A woman— who was she?

A third divine being then appeared who had the look of a \"hero\": A tablet of lapis lazuli his hand held; the plan of a temple he drew on it. And then, before his very eyes, there materialized the signs for construction: \"a holy carrying-basket\" and a \"holy brick mold\" in which th ere was placed \"the destined brick.\" Having heard the details of the dreamlike vision, the oracle goddess proceeded to tell Gudea what it meant. The first god to appear was Ningirs u (Ninurta); \"f or thee to build his temple, Eninnu, he commanded.\" The heliacal rising, she explained, signa led the god Ningishzidda, in- dicating to him the point of the Sun on the horizon. The goddess was Nisaba; \"to build the House in accordance with the Holy Planet she in structed thee.\" And the third god, Nanshe explained, \"Nindub is his name; to thee the plan of the House he gave.\" Nanshe then added some in structions of her own, re- minding Gudea that the new En innu had to provide appro- priate places for Ninurta's w eapons, for his great aircraft, even for his favorite lyre. Given these explanations and instructions Gudea returned to Lagash and secluded himself in the old temple, trying to figure out what all those instruc- tions meant. \"For two days in the sanctuary of the temple he shut himself in, at night he was shut in; the House's plan he contemplated, the vision he repeated to himself.\" Most baffling to him, to begin with, was the matter of the new temple's orientation. Stepping up to a high or el- evated part of the old temple called Shugalam, \"the place of the aperture, the place of determining, from which Nin- girsu can see the re petition over his lands,\" Gudea removed some of the \"spittle\" (morta r? mud?) that obstructed the view, trying to fathom the secr ets of the temple's construe-"},{"pageNumber":143,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 149 tion; but he was still baffled and perplexed. \"Oh my lord Ningirsu,\" he called out to hi s god, \"Oh son of Enlil: my heart remains unknowing; the meaning is as far from me as the middle of the ocean, as the midst of heaven from me it is distant. . . Oh, son of Enlil, lord Ningirsu—I, I do not know.\" He asked for a second omen; and as he was sleeping Ningirsu/Ninurta appeared to him; \"While I was sleeping, at my head he stood,\" Gudea wrote. The god made clear the instructions to Gudea, a ssuring him of constant divine help: My commands will teach thee the sign by the divine heavenly planet; In accordance with the holy rites my House, the Eninnu, shall bind Earth with Heaven. The god then lists for Gudea all the inner requirements of the new temple, expanding at the same time on his great powers, the awesomeness of his weapons, his memorable deeds (such as the damming of the waters) and the status he was granted by Anu, \"the fifty names of lordship, by those ordained.\" The construction, he tells Gudea, should begin on \"the day of the new Moon,\" when the god will give him the proper omen-—a signal: on the evening of the New Year the god's hand shall appear holding a flame, giving off a light \"that shall make the night as light as day.\" Ninurta/Ningirsu also assures Gudea that he will receive from the very beginning of the planning of the new Eninnu divine help: the god whose epit het was \"The Bright Ser- pent\" shall come to help build the Eninnu and its new precinct—\"build it to be like the House of the Serpent, as a strong place it shall be built.\" Ninurta then promises Gudea that the construction of the temple will bring the land abundance: \"When my temple-terrace is completed,\" rains will come on time, the irrigatio n canals will fill up with water, even the desert \"where water has not flowed\" shall"},{"pageNumber":144,"pageContent":"150 WHEN TIME BEGAN bloom; there will be abundant crops, and plenty of oil for cooking, and \"wool in abunda nce shall be weighed.\" Now \"Gudea understood the favorable plan, a plan that was the clear message of his vision-dream; having heard the words of the lord Ningirsu, he bowed his head . . . Now he was greatly wise and understood great things.\" Losing no time Gudea procee ded to \"purify the city\" and organize the people of Lagash, old and young, to form work brigades and enlist themselves in the solemn task. In verses that throw light on the human side of the story, of life and manners and social prob lems more than four mil- lennia ago, we read that as a way to consecrate themselves for the unique undertaking \"the whip of the overseer was prohibited, the mother did not chide her child... a maid who had done a great wrong wa s not struck by her mistress in the face.\" But the people were asked not only to become angelic; to finance the project , Gudea \"levied taxes in the land; as a submission to the lord Ningirsu the taxes were increased\" . . . One can stop here for a moment to look ahead to another construction of a God's Residence, the one built in the wilderness of Sinai for Yahwe h. The subject is recorded in detail in the Book of Exodus , beginning in chapter 25. \"Speak unto the Children of Israel,\" Yahweh told Moses, \"that they may bring for me a contribution: from every man whose heart shall prompt him thereto shall be taken an allotment for me ... and they shall build for me a sacred sanctuary, and I shall dwell in their midst. In accordance with all that which I am showing thee, the plan of the Residence and the pattern of all the instruments thereof shall ye make it.\" Then followed the most detailed architectural instructions—details which ma ke possible the reconstruc- tions of the Residence and its components by modern scholars. To help Moses carry out these detailed plans, Yahweh decided to provide Moses with two assistants whom Yahweh was to endow with a \"divin e spirit\"-—\"wisdom and un- derstanding and knowledge of all manner of workmanship.'' Two men were chosen by Yahw eh to be so instructed,"},{"pageNumber":145,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 151 Bezalel and Aholiab, \"to carry out all of the sacred work in all of the manner that Yahweh had ordered.\" These instructions began with the la yout plan of the Residence and make clear that it was a rect angular enclosure with its long sides (one hundred cubits) faci ng precisely south and north and its short sides (fifty cubits in length) facing precisely east and west, creating an east-west axis of orientation (see Fig. 44a). By now ''greatly wise\" and ''understanding great things,\" Gudea—to go back to Sumer some seven centuries before the Exodus—launched the execution of the divine instructions in a grand way. By canal and river he sent out boats, \"holy ships on which the emblem of Nanshe was raised,\" to summon assistance from her followers; he sent caravans of cattle and asses to the lands of Inanna, with her emblem of the \"star-disk\" carr ied in front; he enlisted the men of Utu, \"the god whom he loves.\" As a result, \"Elam- ites came from Elam, Susians came from Susa; Magan (Egypt) and Melukhah (Nubia) se nt a large tribute from their mountains.\" Cedars were brought from Lebanon, bronze was collected, shiploads of stones arrived. Copper, gold, silver, and marble were obtained. When all that was ready, it wa s time to make the bricks of clay. This was no small undertaking, not only because tens of thousands of bricks were needed. The bricks—one of the Sumerian \"firsts\" which, in a land short of stones, enabled them to build high-rise buildings—-were not of the shape and size that we use now adays: they were usually square, a foot or more on each side and two or three inches thick. They were not identical in all places at all times; they were sometimes just sun-dried, sometimes dried in kilns for durability; they were not always flat. but sometimes concave or convex, as their function requ ired, to withstand structural stress. As is clear from Gudea's as well as other kings' inscriptions, when it came to temples, and even more so to ziggurats, it was the god in ch arge who determined the size and shape of the bricks; this wa s such an important step in the construction, and such an honor for the king to mold the first brick, that the kings embedded in the wet bricks a"},{"pageNumber":146,"pageContent":"152 WHEN TIME BEGAN stamped inscription (Fig. 75) w ith a votive content. This custom, fortunately, made it possible for archaeologists to identify so many of the kings involved in the construction, reconstruction, or repair of the temples. Figure 75 Gudea devoted many lines in his inscriptions to the subject of the bricks. It was a ceremony attended by several gods and was held on the grounds of the old temple. Gudea prepared himself by spending th e night in the sanctuary, then bathing clean and putti ng on special clothes in the morning. Throughout the land it was a solemn rest day. Gudea offered sacrifices, then went into the old Holy of Holies; there was the brick mold that the god had shown him in the vision-dream and a \"holy carrying-basket.\" Gu- dea put the basket on his head. A god named Galalim led the procession. The god Ningishzidda held the brick-mold in his hand. He let Gudea pour into the mold water from the temple's copper cup, as a good omen. On a signal from Ninurta, Gudea poured clay into the mold, all the while uttering incantations. Reverentl y, the inscription says, he carried out the holy rites. The whole city of Lagash \"was lying low,\" waiting for the outcome: will the brick come out right or will it be faulty?"},{"pageNumber":147,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 153 After the sun had shone upon the mold Gudea broke the mold, he separated the brick. The bottom face of the stamped clay he saw; with a faithful eye he examined it. The brick was perfect! He carried the brick to the temple, the brick raised from the mold. Like a brilliant diadem he raised it to heaven; he carried it to the pe ople and raised it. He put the brick down in the temple; it was solid and firm. And the heart of the king was made as bright as the day. Ancient, even archaic, Sume rian depictions have been found dealing with the brick ce remony; one of them (Fig. 76) shows a seated deity holding up the Holy Mold, bricks from which are carried to construct a ziggurat. The time has thus come to start building the temple; and the first step was to mark out its orientation and implant the foundation stone. Gudea wrote th at a new place was chosen for the new Eninnu, and archaeologists (see map. Fig. 73) have indeed found its remains on a hill about fifteen hundred feet away from the earlie r one, on the mound marked \"A\" on the excavations map.

This ceremony too was done on an auspicious day for which \"the full year\" had to come to pass. The day was announced by the go ddess Nanshe: \"Nanshe, a child of Eridu\" (the city of Enki) \"commanded the fulfill- ment of the ascertained oracle.\" It is our guess that it was the Day of the Equinox. At midday, \"when the Sun came fully forth.\" the \"Lord of the Observers, a Master Builder, stationed at the temple, the direction carefully planned.\" As the Anunnaki were watching the procedure of dete rmining the orientation \"with much admiration,\" he \"lai d the foundation stone and marked in the earth the wall's direction.\" We read later on in the inscription that this Lord of the Observers, the Master Builder, was Ningishzidda; and we know from various de- pictions (Fig. 77) that it was a deity (recognized by his horned cap) who implanted the conical cornerstone on such occasions. Apart from depictions of the ceremony, showing a god with the horned headdress im planting the conical \"stone,\" such representations cast in bronze suggest that the \"stone\" was actually a bronze one; the use of the term \"stone\" is not unusual, since all metals resulting from quarrying and mining were named with the prefix NA, meaning \"stone\" or \"that which is mined.\" In this regard it is noteworthy that in the Bible the laying of the comer or First Stone was also considered a divine or di vinely inspired act signifying the Lord's blessing to the new House. In the prophecy by Zechariah about the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem, he relates how Yahweh show ed him in a vision \"a man holding a measuring cord in his hand,\" and how he was told that this divine emissary would come to measure the four sides of a rebuilt and greater Jerusalem with its new Lord's House, whose stones sh all rise sevenfold after the Lord will place for him the First Stone. \"And when they shall see the bronze stone in th e hands of Zerubbabel\" (the one chosen by Yahweh to rebuild the Temple) all nations"},{"pageNumber":149,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 155 Figure 77 will know that it was the Lord's will.

In Lagash, once the cornerstone was embedded by the god Ningishzidda, Gudea was able to lay the temple's foun- dations, by now \"like Nisa ba knowing the meaning of numbers.\" The ziggurat built by Gudea, scholars have concluded, was one of seven stages. Acco rdingly, seven blessings were pronounced as soon as the la ying of the foundation stone was completed and the temple's orientation set and Gudea began to place the bricks along the marking on the ground: May the bricks rest peacefully! May the House by its plan rise high! May the divine Black Storm Bird"},{"pageNumber":150,"pageContent":"156 WHEN TIME BEGAN be as a young eagle! May it be like a young lion awesome! May the House have the brilliance of Heaven! May joy abound at the pr escribed sacrifices! May Eninnu be a light unto the world! Then did Gudea begin to build the \"House, a dwelling he established for his lord Ningirsu ... a temple truly a Heaven-Earth mountain, its head reaching heavenward . . . Joyfully did Gudea erect th e Eninnu with Sumer's firm bricks; the great temple he thus constructed.\" With no stones to be quarried in Mesopotamia, the \"Land between the rivers\" which was covered with an avalanche of mud during the Deluge, the only building materials were the mud or clay bricks, and all the temples and ziggurats were so built. The statement by Gudea that the Eninnu was erected \"with Sumer's firm bric ks\" is thus a mere statement of fact. What is puzzling is the detailed list by Gudea of other materials used in the c onstruction. We refer here not to the various woods and timbers, which were commonly used in temple constructions, but to the variety of metals and stones employed in the project—materials all of which had to be imported from afar. The king, we read in the in scriptions, \"the Righteous Shepherd,\" \"built the temple bright with metal\" bringing copper, gold, and silver from distant lands. \"He built the Eninnu with stone, he made it bright with jewels; with copper mixed with tin he held it fast.\" This is undoubtedly a reference to bronze which, in addition to its use for various listed artifacts, apparently was also used to clamp together stone blocks and metals. The making of bronze, a complex process involving the mixing of copper and tin under great heat in specified proportions, was quite an art; and indeed Gudea's inscription makes it clear that for the purpose a Sangu Simug, a \"priestly smith,\" working for the god Nin- tud, was brought over from the \"Land of smelting.\" This priestly smith, the inscription adds, \"worked on the tem- ple's facade; with two handbreadth s of bright stone he faced over the brickwork; with di orite and one handbreadth of"},{"pageNumber":151,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 157 bright stone he ...\" (the insc ription is too damaged here to be legible). Not just the mere quantity of stones used in the Eninnu but the outright statement that the brickwork was faced with bright stone of a certain th ickness—a statement that until now has not drawn the attent ion of scholars—is nothing short of sensational. We know of no other instance of Su- merian records of temple construction that mention the fac- ing or \"casing\" of brickwork wi th stones. Such inscriptions speak only of brickwork—its erection, its crumbling, its replacement—but never of a stone facing over the brick facade. Incredibly—but as we shall show, not inexplicably—the facing of the new Eninnu with bright stones, unique in Sumer, emulated the Egyp tian method of facing step- pyramids with bright stone casings to give them smooth sides! The Egyptian pyramids that were built by pharaohs began with one built by King Zoser at Sakkara (south of Memphis) circa 2650 B.C. (Fig. 78). Rising in six steps within a rec- tangular sacred precinct, it was originally faced with bright limestone casing stones of which only traces now remain: its casing stones, as those of ensuing pyramids, were re- moved by later rulers to be used in their own monuments. The Egyptian pyramids, as we have shown and proved in The Stairway to Heaven, be gan with those built by the Anunnaki themselves—the Great Pyramid and its two com- panions at Giza. It was they who devised the casing with bright stones of what were in their core step-pyramids, giv- ing them their renowned smooth sides. That the new Eninnu in Lagash, commissioned by Ninur ta at about the same time "},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"158 WHEN TIME BEGAN as Stonehenge became truly a stone-henge, emulated an Egyptian pyramid's stone facing, is a major clue for the resolution of the Stonehenge enigma. Such an unexpected link to ancient Egypt, as we have been showing, was only one among many. Gudea himself was alluding to these connections when he stated that the shape of the Eninnu and its cas ing with bright stones were based on information provided by Nisaba \"who was taught the plan of the temple by Enki \" in the \"House of Learning.'' That academy was undoubtedly in one of Enki's centers; and Egypt, it will be recalled, was the domain allotted to Enki and his descendants when Earth was divided. The Eninnu project involved th e participation of quite a number of gods; Nisaba, who had appeared to Gudea in the first vision with the star map, was not the only female among them. Let us look at the full li st, then highlight the female roles. First there was Enlil, who began the process by granting the permission to Ninurta to build the new temple. Then Ninurta appeared to Gudea, informing him of the divine decision and of his (Gudea's) se lection to be the builder. In his vision Ningishzidda indi cated to him the celestial point where the Sun rose, Nisaba pointed with a stylus to the favorable star, and Nindub dr ew the plan of the temple on a tablet. In order to unders tand all that, he consulted Nanshe, the oracle goddess. Inanna/Ishtar and Utu/Shamash enlisted their followers in obtaining the rare building ma- terials. Ningishzidda, with the participation of a god named Galalim, was involved in molding the bricks. Nanshe chose the auspicious day on which to start the construction. Nin- gishzidda then determined the orientation and laid the cor- nerstone. Before the Eninnu was declared fit for its purpose, Utu/Shamash examined its alignment with the Sun. The individual shrines built al ongside the ziggurat honored Anu, Enlil, and Enki. And the final purification and consecration rites, before Ninurta/Ningi rsu and his spouse Bau moved in, involved the deities Ninmada, Enki, Nindub, and Nanshe."},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 159 Astronomy clearly played a key role in the Eninnu project; and two of the deities involved, Nanshc and Nisaba, were female astronomer-gods. They applied their specialized knowledge of astronomy, mathem atics, and metrology not only to temple construction (a s in Gudea's case), but also to general productive purposes as well as in ritual roles. One, however, was trained in the academy of Eridu; the other in that of Nippur. Nanshe, who identified for G udea the celestial role of each of the deities that appeared to him in his vision and determined the precise calendrical day (of the equinox) for orienting the temple, is called in the Gudea inscriptions \"a daughter of Eridu\" (Enki's city in Sumer). Indeed, in the major God Lists of Mesopotamia, she was called NIN. A— \"Lady of Water\"—and shown as a daughter of Ea/Enki. The planning of waterways a nd the locating of fountainheads were her specialty; her celes tial counterpart was the con- stellation Scorpio—mul GIR.TA B in Sumerian. The knowl- edge she contributed to the bu ilding of the Eninnu in Lagash was thus that of the Enki'ite academies. A hymn to Nanshe in her role as determiner of the New Year Day has her sitting in judgment on Mankind on that day, accompanied by Nisaba in the role of Divine Accoun- tant who tallies and measures the sins of those who are judged, such as the sin of he \"w ho substituted a small weight for a large weight, a small measure for a large measure.\" But while the two goddesses were frequently mentioned together, Nisaba (some scholars read her name Nidaba) was clearly listed among th e Enlilites, and was sometimes iden- tified as a half si ster of Ninurta/Ningirsu. Although she was in later times deemed to be a goddess who blesses the crops—perhaps because of her association with the calendar and weather—she was described in Sumerian literature as one who \"opens men's ears,\" i.e. teaches them wisdom. In one of several School Essays compiled by Samuel N. Kramer (The Sumerians) from scattered fragments, the Urn- mia (\" Word-knower\") names Nisaba as the patron goddess of the E.DUB.BA (\"House of Inscribed Tablets\"), Sumer's"},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"160 WHEN TIME BEGAN principal academy for scribal arts. Kramer called her \"the Sumerian goddess of Wisdom.\" Nisaba was, in the words of D.O. Edzard (Cotter und My then im Vorderen Orient ), the Sumerian goddess of \"the art of writing, mathematics, science, architecture and astronomy.\" Gudea specifically described her as the \"god- dess who knows numbers\"—a female \"Einstein\" of an- tiquity . . . The emblem of Nisaba was th e Holy Stylus. A short hymn to Nisaba on a tablet unearthed in the ruins of the sacred precinct of Lagash (Fig. 79) describes her as \"she who acquired fifty great ME's\" and as possessor of the \"stylus of seven numbers.\" Both numbe rs were associated with Enlil and Ninurta: the numerical rank of both was fifty, and one of Enlil's epithets (as commander of Earth, the seventh planet) was \"Lord of Seven.\" Figure 79 With her Holy Stylus Nisaba pointed out to Gudea the \"favorite star\" on the \"star tablet\" that she held on her knees; the implication is that the star tablet had drawn on it more than one star, so that the correct one for the ori- entation had to be pointed out from among several stars. This conclusion is strengthened by the statement in The Blessing of Nisaba by Enki that Enki had given her as part"},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 161 of her schooling \"the holy tablet of the heavenly stars\"— again \"stars\" in the plural. The term MUL in Sumerian (Kakkab in Akkadian), mean- ing \"celestial body,\" was applied to both planets and stars, and one wonders what heavenly bodies were shown on the star map possessed by Nisaba, whether they were stars or planets or (probably) both. Th e opening line of the text shown in Fig. 79, paying homag e to Nisaba as a great astronomer, calls her NI N MUL.MUL.LA—\"Lady of Many Stars.\" The intriguing aspe ct of this formulation is that the term \"many stars\" is written not with a star sign together with the determina tive sign for \"many,\" but with four star signs. The only plau sible explanation for this un- usual formulation is that Nisa ba could point out, on her sky map, the four stars that we c ontinue to use for determining the cardinal points. Her great wisdom and scien tific knowledge were ex- pressed in Sumerian hymns by the statement that she was \"perfected with the fifty great ME's\"—those enigmatic \"divine formulas\" that, like computer disks, were small enough to be carried by hand though each contained a vast amount of information. Inanna/Ishtar, a Sumerian text re- lated, went to Eridu and tric ked Enki into giving her one hundred of them. Nisaba, on th e other hand, did not have to steal the fifty ME's. A poetic text compiled from frag- ments and rendered into English by William W. Hallo (in a lecture titled \"The Cultic Setting of Sumerian Poetry\") that he called The Blessing of Nisaba by Enki, makes clear that in addition to her Enlilite schooling Nisaba was also a graduate of the Eridu academy of Enki. Extolling Nisaba as \"Chief scribe of heaven, record-keeper of Enlil, all- knowing sage of the gods\" and exalting Enki, \"the crafts- man of Eridu\" and his \"House of Learning,\" the hymn says of Enki: He verily opened the House of Learning for Nisaba; He verily placed the lapis lazuli tablet on her knee, to take counsel with the holy ta blet of the heavenly stars."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"162 WHEN TIME BEGAN The \"cult city\" of Nisaba was called Eresh (\"Foremost Abode\"); its remains or location were never discovered in Mesopotamia. The fifth stanza of this poem suggests that it was located in the \"Lower Worl d\" (Abzu) of Africa, where Enki oversaw the mining and metallurgical operations and conducted his experiments in ge netics. Listing the various distant locations where Nisa ba was also schooled under Enki's aegis, the poem states: Eresh he constructed for her, in abundance created of pure little bricks. She is granted wisdom of the highest degree in the Abzu, great place of Eridu's crown. A cousin of Nisaba, the goddess ERESH.KI.GAL (\"Foremost Abode in the Great Place\"), was in charge of a scientific station in southern Africa and there shared con- trol of a Tablet of Wisdom w ith Nergal, a son of Enki, as a marriage dowry. It is quite pos sible that it was there that Nisaba acquired her additional schooling.

She holds a pole-mounted viewing instrument, identified here by the crescent as one for viewing the Moon's move- ments, i.e. for calendrical purposes. And she is further identified by the four stars—the symbol, we believe, of Nisaba. One of the oddest statements made by Gudea when he described the deities who appear ed to him concerned Nisaba: \"The image of a temple-structure, a ziggurat, she carried on her head.\" The headdress of Mesopotamian deities was distinguished by its pairs of horns; that gods or goddesses would instead wear on their h eads the image of a temple or an object was absolutely unheard of. Yet, in his inscription, that is how Gudea described Nisaba. He was not imagining things. If we examine illustration 80, we will see that Nisaba is indeed carrying on her head the image of a temple-ziggurat, just as Gudea had stated. But it is not a stepped structur e; rather, it is the image of a smooth-sided pyramid—an Egyptian pyramid! Moreover, not only is the ziggurat Egyptianized—the very custom of wearing such an image on the head is Egyp- tian, especially as it applie d to Egyptian goddesses. Fore- most of them were Isis, the sister-wife of Osiris (Fig. 81a) and Nephtys, their sister (Fig. 81b). Was Nisaba, an Enlilite goddes s schooled in Enki's acad- emy, Egyptianized enough to be wearing this kind of head- gear? As we pursue this i nvestigation, many similarities between Nisaba and Sesheta, th e female assistant of Thoth in Egypt, come to light. In addition to the attributes and function of Sesheta that we have already reviewed, there were others that closely matched those of Nisaba. They included her role as \"the goddess of the arts of writing and of science,\" in the words of Hermann Kees (Der Gotter- glaube in Alien Aegypten). Ni saba possessed the \"stylus of seven numbers\"; Sesheta too wa s associated with the num- ber seven. One of her epithets was \"Sesheta means seven\" and her name was often writte n hieroglyphicaliy by the sign for seven placed above a bow.

She was a \"daughter of the sky,\" a chronologer and chrono grapher; and like Nisaba, she determined the required astr onomical data for the royal- temple builders. According to the Sumerian texts, the consort of Nisaba was a god called Haia. Hardly anything is known of him, except that in the judgment procedures on New Year's Day supervised by Nanshe, he was also present, acting as the balancer of the scales. In Egyptian beliefs Judgment Day for the pharaoh was when he died, at which time his heart was weighed to determine his fate in the Afterlife. In Egyp- tian theology, the god who bala nced the scales was Thoth, the god of science, astronomy, the calendar, and of writing and record keeping. Such an overlapping of identities between the deities who provided the astronomical and calendrical knowledge for the Eninnu reveals an othe rwise unknown state of cooper- ation between the Sumerian a nd Egyptian Divine Architects in Gudea's time.

A pool was built and filled with rare fish—another unusual feature in Sumerian temple precincts and one which is akin to E gyptian ones, where a sacred pool was a common feature. \"The dream,\" Gudea wrote, \"was fulfilled.\" The En- innu was completed, \"like a bright mass it stands, a radiant"},{"pageNumber":160,"pageContent":"166 WHEN TIME BEGAN brightness of its facing covers everything; like a mountain which glows it joyously rises.\" Now he turned his attention and efforts to the Girsu, the sacred precinct as such. A ravine, \"a great dump\" was filled up: \"with the wisdom gr anted by Enki divinely he did the grading, enlarging the area of the temple terrace.\" Cylinder A alone lists more than fifty separate shrines and temples built adjoining the ziggurat to honor the various gods involved in the project as well as Anu, Enlil, and Enki. There were enclosures, service buildings, courts, altars, gates; residences for the various priests; and, of course, the special dwelling and sleeping quarters of Ningirsu/Ninurta and his spouse Bau. There were also special encl osures or facilities for hous- ing the Divine Black Bird, th e aircraft of Ninurta, and for his awesome weapons; as well as places at which the astronomical-calendrical functions of the new Eninnu were to be performed. There was a sp ecial place for \"the Master of Secrets,\" and the new Shugalam, the high place of the aperture, the \"place of determining whose awesomeness is great, where the Brillianc e is announced.\" And there were two buildings connected with the \"solving of the cords\" and the \"binding with the cords\" respectively— facilities whose purpose has eluded scholars but which had to be connected with ce lestial observations, for they were located next to, or were part of, the structures called ''Uppermost Chamber'' and \"Chamber of the seven zones.\" There were certain other features that were added to the new Eninnu and its sacred precin ct that indeed made it as unique as Gudea had boasted; we shall discuss them in the detail they deserve further on. There was also a need, as the text makes clear, to aw ait a certain specific day—New Year's Day, to be precise - before Ninurta and his spouse Bau could actually move into the new Eninnu and make it their dwelling abode. Whereas Cylinder A was devoted to the events leading to the construction of the Eni nnu and the construction itself, Gudea's inscriptions on Cylinder B deal with the rites con-"},{"pageNumber":161,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 167 nected with the consecration of the new ziggurat and its sacred precinct and the cerem onies involved in the actual arrival of Ninurta and Bau in the Girsu—reaffirming his title as NIN.GIRSU, \"Lord of Girsu\"—and their entry into their new dwelling place. The astronomical and calendrical aspects of these rites and cerem onies enhance the data with which the Cylinder A inscriptions are filled. While the arrival of the inauguration day was awaited— for the better part of a year —Gudea engaged in daily pray- ers, the pouring of libations, and the filling up of the new temple's granaries with food from the fields and its cattle pens with sheep from the pastures. Finally the designated day arrived: The year went round, the months were completed; the New Year came in the heavens— the \"Month of the Temple\" began. On that day, as the \"new Moon was born,\" the dedication ceremonies began. The gods themselves performed the pu- rification and consecration rite s: \"Ninmada performed the purification; Enki granted a special oracle; Nindub spread incense; Nanshe, the Mistress of Oracles, sang holy hymns; they consecrated the Eninnu, made it holy.\" The third day, Gudea recorde d, was a bright day. It was on that day that Ninurta stepped out—\"with a bright ra- diance he shone.\" As he ente red the new sacred precinct, \"the goddess Bau was advancing on his left side.\" Gudea \"sprinkled the ground with an abundance of oil. . . he brought forth honey, butter, wi ne, milk, grain, olive oil... dates and grapes he piled up in a heap—food untouched by fire, food for the eating by the gods.\" The entertainment of the divi ne couple and the other gods with fruits and other uncooked foods went on until midday. \"When the Sun rose high over the country\" Gudea \"slaugh- tered a fat ox and a fat sheep\" and a feast of roasted meats with much wine began; \"white bread and milk they brought by day and through the night\"; and \"Ninurta, the warrior"},{"pageNumber":162,"pageContent":"168 WHEN TIME BEGAN of Enlil, taking food and beer for drink, was satisfied.\" All the while Gudea \"made the whol e city kneel, he made the whole country prostrat e itself. . . By day there were peti- tions, by night prayers.\" \"At the morning aurora''—at dawn—\"Ningirsu, the warrior, entered the Temple; into the Temple its lord came; giving a shout like the cry of battle, Ningirsu advanced into his temple.\" \"It was,\" observed Gudea, \"like the rising of the Sun over the land of Lagash . . . and the Land of Lagash rejoiced.\" It was also the day on which the harvest began: On that day, when the Righteous God entered, Gudea, on that day, began to harvest the fields. Following a decree of Ninur ta and the goddess Nanshe, there followed seven days of repentance and atonement in the land. \"For seven days the maid and her mistress were equal, master and slave walked side by side ... of the evil tongue the word was changed to good ... the rich man did not wrong the orphan, no man o ppressed the widow ... the city restrained wickedness.\" At the end of the seven days, on the tenth day of the month, Gudea entered the new temple and for the first time performed there the rites of the High Priest, \"lighting the fire in the temple-terrace before the bright heavens.\" A depiction on a cylinder seal from the second millennium B.C., found at Ashur, may well have preserved for us the scene that had taken place a thousand years earlier in Lagash: it shows a High Priest (who as often as not was also the king, as in the case of Gudea) lighting a fire on an altar as he faces the god's ziggurat, while the \"favorite planet\" is seen in the heavens (Fig. 83). On the altar, \"before the bright heavens, the fire on the temple-terrace increased.\" Gud ea \"oxen and kids sacrificed in numbers.\" From a lead bow l he poured a libation. \"For the city below the temple he pleaded \"He swore everlasting"},{"pageNumber":163,"pageContent":"The Divine Architects 169 Figure 83 allegiance to Ningirsu, \"by the bricks of Eninnu he swore, a favorable oath he swore.\" And the god Ninurta, promisi ng Lagash and its people abundance, that \"the land may bear whatever is good,\" to Gudea himself said: \"Life sh all be prolonged for thee.\" Appropriately, the Cylinder B inscription concludes thus: House, rising heavenward as a great mountain, its luster powerfully falls on the land as Anu and Enlil the fate of Lagash determine. Eninnu, for Heaven-Earth constructed, the lordship of Ningirsu to all the lands it makes known. O Ningirsu, thou art honored! The House of Ningirsu is built; Glory be unto it!"},{"pageNumber":164,"pageContent":"7 A STONEHENGE ON THE EUPHRATES There is a wealth of information in the inscripti ons of Gudea; the more we study them and the special features of the Eninnu he built, the more astounded we shall be. Perusing the texts verse by vers e and visualizing the great new temple-terrace and its ziggurat, we shall discover amaz- ing celestial features of th e \"Bond Heaven-Earth\"; one of the earliest if not the very ear liest association of a temple with the zodiac; the appearan ce of sphinxes in Sumer at a totally unexpected time; an a rray of links with Egypt and especially with one of its gods; and a \"mini-Stonehenge\" in the Land Between the Rivers . . . Let us begin with the firs t task Gudea undertook after the construction of the ziggurat was completed and the temple-terrace formed. It was the erection of seven upright stone pillars at seven carefully selected positions. Gudea, the inscription states, made sure that they be firmly erected: he \"laid them on a foundation, on bases he erected them,\" The stelae (as scholars call these upright stones) must have been of great importance, for Gudea spent a full year in bringing the rough stone bl ocks, from which the uprights were carved to shape, from a distant source to Lagash; and another year to cut and shape them. But then, in a frenzied effort that lasted a precise seven days during which the work was carried out without stoppi ng, without rest, the seven stelae were set up in their prop er places. If, as the infor- mation given suggests, the seven stelae were positioned in some astronomical alignment, then the speed becomes un- derstandable, for the longer the setting up would have taken, 170"},{"pageNumber":165,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 171 the more misaligned the ce lestial bodies would have become. Signifying the importance of the stelae and their position is the fact that Gudea gave each one a \"name\" made up of a long sacred utterance evidently related to the posi- tion of the stela (e.g. \"on the lofty terrace,\" facing the \"gate of the river-bank\" or a nother one \"opposite the shrine of Anu\"). Although the insc ription stated unequivocally (column XXIX line 1) that \"seven stelae were erected\" in those seven hectic days, the na mes of only six locations are given. In respect to one, presum ably the seventh stela, the inscription states that it \"was erected toward the rising sun.\" Since by then all the required orientations of the Eninnu had already been fixed, starting with the divine instructions and the laying of the cornerstone by Ningishzidda, neither the six spread out stelae nor the seventh \"erected toward the rising sun\" were required for orienting the temple. An- other, different purpose had to be the motive; the only log- ical conclusion is that it i nvolved observations other than determining the Day of the Equi nox (i.e. of the New Year)— some astronomical-calendrical observations of an unusual nature, justifying the great e ffort in obtaining and shaping the stelae and the haste in setting them up. The enigma of these erected stone pillars begins with the question, why so many when two are enough to create a line of sight, say toward th e rising Sun. The puzzle is en- gulfed by incredulity when we r ead on in the inscription the sensational statement that the six whose locations were named were placed by Gudea \"in a circle.\" Did Gudea use the stelae to form a stone henge—in ancient Sumer, more than five thousand years ago? Gudea's inscription indicates , according to A. Falken- stein (Die Inschrif ten Gudeas von Lagash), the existence of an avenue or pathway which—as at Stonehenge!—could provide an unimpeded sightline. He noted that the stela which was \"toward the rising Sun\" stood at one end of a pathway or avenue called \"Way to the high position.\" At the other end of this way was the Shugalam, the \"High place whose awesomeness is great, where the Brilliance"},{"pageNumber":166,"pageContent":"172 WHEN TIME BEGAN is raised.\" The term SHU.GALAM meant, according to Falkenstein, \"Where the ha nd is raised\"—a high place from which a signal is given. Indeed, the Cylinder A inscription asserts that \"At th e radiant entrance of Shu- galam, Gudea stationed a favorable image; toward the rising Sun, in the destined pl ace, the emblem of the Sun he established.\" We have already discussed th e functions of the Shugalam when Gudea had gone to it, in the old temple, to remove the mortar or mud that obstructed the view through it. It was, we found, \"the place of the aperture, the place of determining.\" There, the inscri ption stated, \"Ninurta could see the repetitions\"—the annua l celestial cy cle—\"over his lands.\" The description brings to mind the ceiling aperture about which there was so much arguing on Mount Zaphon between Ba'al and the divine architect who came from Egypt to design the new temple in Lebanon. Some additional light on the enigmatic purpose of such a skylight or aperture in th e ceiling can be obtained from the examination of the Hebrew term for such a contraption and its Akkadian roots. It is Tzohar and appears just once in the Bible to describe the only aperture in the ceiling of the otherwise hermetically sealed Noah's Ark. The mean- ing, all agree, is \"a ceiling window through which a beam of light can shine in.\" In mode rn Hebrew the term is also used to denote \"zenith,\" the poi nt in the sky directly over- head; and both in modern Hebrew and biblical texts the term Tzohora'im that derived from it meant and still means \"mid- day,\" when the Sun is direc tly overhead. Tzohar was thus not just a simple aperture, but one intended to let a beam of the Sun shine into a darken ed enclosure at a certain time of the day; spelled slightly differently, Zohar, the term acquired the meaning \"brightness, brilliance.\" All stem from the Akkadian, the mother tongue of all the Semitic languages, in which the words tzirru, tzurru meant \"lighten up, shine\" and \"be high.\" At the Shugalam, Gudea wrote, he \"fixed the image of the Sun.\" All the ev idence suggests that it was a viewing device through which the rising Sun—undoubtedly on Equi-"},{"pageNumber":167,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 173 nox Day, to judge from all the data in the inscriptions— was observed to determine a nd announce the arrival of the New Year. Was the concept underlying the structural arrangement the same as (possibly) the one on Mount Zaphon and (cer- tainly) as at the Egyptian temple s, where a beam of sunlight passed along the preselected ax is to light up the Holy of Holies at sunrise on the prescribed day? In Egypt the Sun Temples we re flanked by two obelisks (Fig. 84) which the pharaohs er ected so that they might be granted long life; their f unction was to guide the Sun's beam on the prescribed da y. E.A. Wallis Budge (The Egyptian Obelisk) pointed out that the pharaohs, such as Ramses II and Queen Hatshepsut, always set up these obelisks in pairs. Queen Hatshepsut even wrote her royal name (within a cartouche) between two obelisks (Fig. 85a) to imply that the Blessed Beam of Ra shone on her on the crucial day. Scholars have noted that Solomon's Temple also had two pillars erected at its entrance (Fig. 85c); like the uprights at the Eninnu which were give n names by Gudea, so were the two pillars named by Solomon: And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple. He set up the right pillar "},{"pageNumber":168,"pageContent":"174 WHEN TIME BEGAN and called the name thereof Yakhin; and he set up the left pillar and called the name thereof Bo'az. While the meaning of the tw o names eludes scholars (the best assumption is \"Yahweh makes firm\" and \"In him is strength\"), the shape, height, and makeup of the pillars is described in the Bible (mainly I Kings chapter 7) in detail. The two pillars were made of cast bronze, eighteen cubits {some twenty-seven feet) high. Each pillar supported a com- plex \"headband\" around which, as a crown, there was placed a corolla whose serrated top created seven protru- sions; one of them (or both, depending on the way the verse is read) was \"encircled by a cord twelve cubits long.\" (Twelve and seven are the predominant numbers in the Temple.) The Bible does not state the purpose of these pillars, and theories have ranged from purely decorative or sym- bolic to a function akin to that of the pair of obelisks that flanked the entrances to the temples in Egypt. In this regard a clue is suggested by the Egyptian word for \"obe- lisk,\" which was Tekhen. The term, Budge wrote, \"was a very old word, and we find it in the dual in the Pyramid Texts which were written before the close of the VIth Dynasty.\" As to the meaning of the word, which he did not know, he added: \"The exact meaning of Tekhen is unknown to us and it is probable that the Egyptians had forgotten it at a very early period.\" This raises the pos- sibility that the word was a foreign term, a \"loanword\" from another language or c ountry, and we on our part believe that the source, of both the biblical Yakhin and the Egyptian Tekhen was the Akkadian root khunnu which meant \"to establish correctly\" as well as \"to start a light\" (or fire). The Akkadian term may even be traced back to the earlier Sumerian term GUNNU which combined the meanings \"daylight\" with \"tube, pipe.\" These linguistic clues sit we ll with earlier Sumerian depictions of temple entran ces showing them flanked by pillars to which circular devi ces were attached (Fig. 85b)."},{"pageNumber":169,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 175 Figures 85a, 85b, and 85c These must have been the fore runners of all such pairs of uprights, pillars, or obelisks elsewhere, for they appear on the Sumerian depictions millennia before the others. The search for answers to th e puzzle of these uprights is further assisted by examining the term used by Gudea in his inscriptions to describe the stone uprights. He called all seven of them NE.RU—fr om which the Hebrew word Ner, meaning \"candle,\" stems. Sumerian script evolved by the scribe's making wedgelik e markings with a stylus on wet clay to emulate the original drawing of the object or action for which the sign stoo d.

If such a single determination was intended at the Girsu, two stelae, in alignment with the Shugalam, would have suf- ficed.

Six outer or circumference poi nts with one in the center would have created a layout (Fig . 87) that, as in Stonehenge II—belonging to the same time—provided alignments not only with the equinoxes but also with the four solstice points (midsummer sunrise and sunset , midwinter sunrise and sun- set). Since the Mesopotamian New Year was firmly an- chored to the equinoxes, resulting in ziggurats whose determining corner was oriented to the east, an arrangement of stone pillars that incorporat ed fixings of the solstices was a major innovation. It also indicated a decisive \"Egyptian\" influence, for it was at Egyptia n temples that an orientation linked to the solstices was th e dominant feature—certainly by Gudea's time."},{"pageNumber":171,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 177 If, as Falkenstein's study sugge sts, the seventh pillar was nol within the circle of six stelae but outside of it—in the pathway or avenue leading to the Shugalam, an even more astounding similarity emerges, not to the later Stonehenge but to the earliest one, to Stonehenge I, where—we may recall—there were only seven st ones: the four Station Stones forming a rectangle, two Gate way Stones that flanked the beginning of the Avenue, and th e Heel Stone that marked out the sightline—an arrangement of seven stone uprights illustrated in Fig. 88. Since at Stonehenge the Aubrey Holes were part of phase I, the sightl ine could be eas ily determined by a viewer at hole 28 direct ing his gaze through a post inserted in hole 56, watching for the Sun to appear above the Heel Stone on the propitious day. Such a similarity in layouts would be even more signif- icant than the first alternative, for—as we have reported earlier—the rectangle formed by the four Station Stones implied lunar observations in addition to the solar ones. The realization of this rectangular arrangement led both Newham "},{"pageNumber":172,"pageContent":"178 WHEN TIME BEGAN and Hawkins to far-reaching conclusions regarding the so- phistication of the planners of Stonehenge I. Byt since Stonehenge I preceded the Eninnu by about seven centuries, the similarity would have to imply that whoever had planned the layout of the seven upright s in the Eninnu copied from whoever had planned Stonehenge I. Such a kinship between the tw o structures, in two dif- ferent parts of the world, seem s incredible; it will, however, become credible as we bring to light more amazing aspects of Gudea' s Eninnu. The six-plus-one circle just described was not the only stone circle on the plat form of the new Eninnu. Boasting that he accomplished \"great things\" that called for unusual \"wisdom\" (scientific knowledge), Gudea pro- ceeded to describe, after the s ection dealing with the stelae, the \"crownlike circle for the new Moon\"—a creation in stone so unique that \"its name in the midst of the world he caused to brigh tly go forth.\" This second circle was arranged as a \"round cr own for the new Moon\" and consisted of thirteen stones erected \"like heroes in a net- work\"—a most figurative way, it seems to us, to describe a circle of upright stones c onnected at the top by lintels to form a \"network\" akin to the Trilithons at Stonehenge! While the possibility that the first smaller circle served lunar as well as solar functions can be only surmised, the second larger circle was un doubtedly intende d to observe the Moon. Judging by the repeated references in the in- scriptions to the New Moon, th e lunar observations were geared to the Moon's monthly cycle, its waxing and waning in the course of four quarters. Our interpretation of the crownlike circle is reinforced by the statement that this circle consisted of two groups of me galiths—one of six and the other of seven, with the latter apparently more elevated or taller than the first. At first glance the arrangement of thirteen (six plus seven) megaliths, connected at their tops by lintels to form a \"crown.\" seems to be an erro r, because we expect to find only twelve pillars (w hich in a circle crea te twelve apertures)"},{"pageNumber":173,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 179 it\" the arrangement is related to the twelve months of the lunar phases. The presence of thirteen pillars , however, does make sense if account were taken of the need to add one month every now and then for intercalation purposes. If so, the amazing stone circles in the Girsu were also the first instance where calendars made of stone meshed to correlate the solar and lunar cycles. (One wonders whether these stone circles in the Girsu somehow presaged the intro duction of the seven-day week—a division of time whos e origin has evaded schol- ars—the biblical week which totaled seven by adding the six days of creation to the final additional day of rest. The number seven appears twice, in the first arrangement of pillars and as part of the second circle; and it is quite possible that somehow days were counted according to either group, leading to a repetition of periods of seven days. Also, four phases of the Moon multiplied hy the thirteen pillars would divide the year into fifty-two weeks of seven days each). Whatever the astronomical-calendrical possibilities in- herent in the two circles (a nd we have probably only touched upon the very basic ones ), it is evid ent that in the Girsu of Lagash a solar-l unar stone computer was put into operation. If all this begins to s ound like a \"Stonehenge on the Euphrates\"—a mini-Stonehcng e erected by a Sumerian king in the Girsu of Lagash at about the same time that Stonehenge in the British Isles became a truly stone circle circa 2100 B.C.—there is more to come. It was at that time that the second type of stone , the bluestones, was brought to the plain of Salisbury from a distant source. This too enhances the similarities: Gudea too hauled not one but two types of stones from a great distance,'' from the stone moun- tains\" of Magan (Egypt) a nd Melukhah (Nubia), both in Africa. We read in the inscription on Cylinder A that it took a full year to obtain these stone blocks from \"stone moun- tains which no [Sumerian] ki ng had entered before,\" To reach them, Gudea \"into the mountains made a way, and"},{"pageNumber":174,"pageContent":"180 WHEN TIME BEGAN their great stones he brought out in blocks; shiploads of Hua stones and Lua stones.\" Though the meaning of the names of the two types of stones remains undeciphered, their distant origin is clearly stated. Coming from two African sources, they were first transported by land via a new way made by Gudea, then carried by ships over sea routes to Lagash (which was connected to the Euphrates River by a navigable canal). As at Salisbury Plain in the British Isles so was it in the Mesopotamian plain: stones ha uled from afar, stones es- pecially selected, set up in tw o circles. As at Stonehenge I, seven pillars played a key role; as in all the phases of Stonehenge in Lagash, too, a large megalith created the desired sightline toward the principal solar orientation. In both places a stone \"computer\" was created to serve as a solar-lunar observatory. Were both, then, created by the same scientific genius, by the same Divine Architect—or were they simply the result of accumulated scientif ic traditions that found expres- sion in similar structures'? While general scientific know ledge as applied to as- tronomy and the calendar undoubt edly played a role, the hand of a specific Di vine Architect cannot be ignored. In earlier chapters we have pointed out the key difference in design between Stonehenge an d all the other temples of the Old World: the former was based on circular forma- tions to observe the heavens; th e latter were all built with right angles (rectangular or squa re). This difference is evi- dent not only in the general plan of the other temples but also in the several instances where stone uprights were found, emplaced in a pattern suggesting an astronomical- calendrical function. An out standing example was found at Byblos, on a promontory ove rlooking the Mediterranean Sea. The Holy of Holies of its temple, square in shape, was flanked by upright stone monoliths. They were set up in alignments suggesting observations of equinoxes and solstices; but none were arranged in a circle. So apparently was the case at a Canaanite site, Gezer, near Jerusalem, where the discovery of a tablet inscribed with the full list"},{"pageNumber":175,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 181 of months and their agricultu ral activities may suggest the existence of a center for the study of the calendar. There too a row of upright monoliths indicates the existence in antiquity of a structure perhaps akin to that at Byblos; the remaining uprights, standing in a straight line, belie any circular arrangement. The few known instances of monoliths arranged in a circle, somehow emulating the extraordinary circular ar- rangement at the Girsu, come to us from the Bible. Their rarity, however, points to a di rect connection to Sumer in Gudea's time. Knowledge of a circle of thirteen with an upright in the center emerges in the tale of Joseph, a great-grandson of Abraham, who kept annoying his eleven brothers by telling them of his dreams wherein th ey all bowed to him although he was the youngest. The dream that upset them most, leading them to get rid of hi m by selling him into slavery in Egypt, was the one in whic h, Joseph related, he saw \"the Sun and the Moon and eleven stars bowing down to me,\" meaning his father and mother and eleven brothers. Several centuries later, as th e Israelites left Egypt for the Promised Land in Canaan, an actual stone circle—this time of twelve stones—was erected. In chapters 3 and 4 of the Book of Joshua the Bible desc ribes the miraculous crossing of the Jordan River by the Isra elites under the leadership of Joshua. As instructed by Yahw eh, the heads of the twelve tribes erected twelve stones in the midst of the river; and as the priests carrying the Ar k of the Covenant stepped into the waters and stood wh ere the twelve stones were placed, the flow of the river's waters \"was cut off\" up- stream and the dry river be d was exposed, enabling the Israelites to cross the Jordan on foot. As soon as the priests carrying the Ark stepped off th e stones and carried the Ark across, \"the waters of the Jord an returned to their place and flowed over its banks as they did before.\" Then Yahweh ordered Joshua to take the twelve stones and erect them in a circle on th e west side of the river, east of Jericho, as an everlasting commemoration of the miracle"},{"pageNumber":176,"pageContent":"182 WHEN T1ME BEGAN performed by Yahweh. The place where the twelve stones were erected was since then known as Gilgal, meaning \"Place of the Circle.\" Not only the establishment of the twelve-stone circle as a miraculous device is relevant here; so is the date of the event. We first learn in Chapter 3 that the time was \"harvest time, when the waters of the Jordan overflow its banks.\" Then Chapter 4 is more specific: it was in the first month of the calendar, the month of the New Year; and it was on the tenth of that month—the very day on which the inau- guration ceremonies were culminated in Lagash—that \"the people left the Jordan and encamped at Gilgal, where Joshua erected the twelve stones brought up from the Jordan River.\" These calendrical markers be ar uncanny resemblance to similar data concerning the time when Gudea had erected the stone circles on the platfo rm of the Girsu, after the Eninnu itself was completed. We read in the Gudea inscrip- tions that the day Ninurta a nd his spouse entered their new abode was the day when the harvest began in the land— matching the \"harvest time\" in the tale of Gilgal. Astron- omy and the calendar converge in both tales, and both con- cern circular structures. The emergence of traditions of stone circles among the descendants of Abraham can be traced, we believe, to Abra- ham himself and the identity of his father Terah. Dealing with the subject in great deta il in The Wars of Gods and Men, we have concluded that Terah was an oracle priest of royal descent, raised and trai ned in Nippur. Based on bib- lical data we have ca lculated that he wa s born in 2193 B.C.; this means that Terah was an astronomer-priest in Nippur when Enlil authorized his son, Ninurta, to proceed with the building of the new Eninnu by Gudea. Terah's son Abram (later renamed Abraham) was bom, by our calculations, in 2123 B.C. and was ten years old when the family moved to Ur, where Terah was to serve as a liaison. The family stayed there until 2096 b.c. when it left Sumer for the Upper Eu phrates region (a migration that later led to Abraham's settlement in Canaan). Abraham"},{"pageNumber":177,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 183 was by then well-versed in royal and priestly matters, in- cluding astronomy. Getting his ed ucation in the sacred pre- cincts of Nippur and Ur just as the glories of the new Eninnu were talked about, he could no t have missed learning of the wondrous stone circle of the Gi rsu; and this would explain the knowledge thereof by his descendants. Where did the idea of a circle as a shape appropriate to astronomical observations—a shape that is the most out- standing feature of Stonehenge —come from? In our view, it came from the zodiac, the cycle of twelve constellations grouped around the Sun in the or bital plane (the Ecliptic) of the planets. Earlier this century archaeologists uncovered in the Gal- ilee, in northern Israel, the remains of synagogues dating to the decades and centuries immediately following the de- struction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem by the Romans (in a.d. 70). To their surprise, a common feature of those synagogues was the decoration of their Moors with intricate mosaic designs that included the signs of the zodiac. As this one from a place called Bet-Alpha shows (Fig. 89), the number—twelve—was the same as nowadays, the symbols were the same as now in use, and so were the names: written in a script no different from that of modern Hebrew, they begin (on the east) with Taleh for ram, Aries, flanked by Shor (bull) for Taurus and Dagim (fishes) for Pisces, and so on in the very same order that we continue to employ millennia later. This zodiacal circle of wh at the Akkadians called Man- zallu (\"stations\" of the Sun) was the source of the Hebrew term Mazalot, which came to denote \"lucks.\" Therein lies the transition from the essen tial astronomical and calendrical nature of the zodiac to its as trological connot ations—a tran- sition that in time obscured the original significance of the zodiac and the role it played in the affairs of gods and men. Last but not least was its wondr ous expression in the Eninnu that Gudea built. The notion has prevailed, in spite of the facts, that the concept, names, and symbols of the zodiac were devised"},{"pageNumber":178,"pageContent":"184 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 89 by the Greeks, for the word is of Greek origin, meaning \"animal circle.\" It is conceded that the inspiration for them may have come from Egypt, wh ere the zodiac with its un- altered symbols, order, a nd names was certainly known (Fig. 90). In spite of the antiq uity of some of the Egyptian depictions—including a magnifi cent one in the temple at Denderah, of which more later—the zodiac did not begin there.

Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that the Sumerians were cognizant of the zodia cal ages—not only the names and images but the precessional cycle thereof—when the calendar was begun in Nippur, circa 3800 B.C., in the Age of Taurus. Willy Hartner, in his study titled \"The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East\" (Journal of Near Eastern Studies), analyzed the Sumerian pictorial evi- dence and concluded that numerous depictions of a bull nudging a lion (Fig. 93b, from the fourth millenium B.C.) or a lion pushing bulls (Fig. 93c, from about 3000 B.C.) are representations of the zodiacal time when the spring equi- nox, at which time the calendrical new year began, was in the constellation Taurus and the summer solstice occurred in the sign of Leo. Alfred Jeremias (The Old Testament in the Light of the Ancient Near East) found text ual evidence that the Su- merian zodiacal-calcndrical \"point zero\" stood precisely between the Bull and the Twins (Gemini), from which he concluded that the zodiacal division of the heavens—in- explicably to him—was devised even before the Sumerian civilization began, in the Ag e of Gemini.

Hence it should not surprise us to discover that zodiacal depictions were indeed present in the new temple in Lagash; not, however, on the floor as in Bet- Alpha, and not as symbols carved on boundary stones. Rather, in a magnificent structure that can rightly be called the first and most ancient planetarium! We read in Gudea's inscriptions that he emplaced \"im- ages of the constellations\" in a \"pure and guarded place, in an inner sanctuary.\" Ther e, a specially designed \"vault of heaven \"—an imitation of th e heavenly circle, a kind of ancient planetarium—was built as a dome resting on what is translated as ''entablature \" (a technical term meaning a base of a superstructure restin g atop columns). In that \"vault of heaven\" Gudea \"caused to dwell\" the zodiacal images. We find clearly listed the \"Heavenly Twins,\" the \"Holy Capricorn,\" the \"Hero\" (Sagit tarius), the Lion, the \"Ce- lestial Creatures\" of the Bull and the Ram. As Gudea had boasted, that \"vault of heaven\" studded with the zodiacal symbols must indeed have been a sight to behold.

The hieroglyphic name of the temple, Ta ynt neterti, meant \"Place of the pillars of the goddess,\" suggest ing that at Denderah too, as in the Girsu, stone upright s served for celestial obser- vations, connected on the one hand to the zodiac and on the other hand to the calendar (as the thirty-six decans attest)."},{"pageNumber":185,"pageContent":"A Stonehenge on the Euphrates 191 Scholars are unable to agree on the point in time repre- sented by the Denderah zodiac. The depiction as now known was discovered when Napoleo n visited Egypt, has since been removed to the Louvre Mu seum in Paris, and is be- lieved to date to the period when Egypt came under Greco- Roman dominance. Scholars are, however, certain that it replicated a similar depiction in a much earlier temple, one that was dedicated to the goddess Hathor. Sir Norman Lock- yer in The Dawn of Astronomy interpreted a Fourth Dynasty (2613-2494 B.C.) text as descri bing the celestial alignments in that earlier temple; this would date the Denderah \"vault of heaven\" to a time between the completion of Stonehenge I and the building of the Eninnu in Lagash by Gudea. If, as others hold, the skies s hown in Denderah are dated by the image of the club topped by a falcon touching the foot of the Twins (Gemini), between the Bull (Taurus) on the right and the Crab (Cancer) on the left, it means that the Denderah depiction turned back the skies (as we do in mod- em planetariums when, say, at Christmas time the skies are shown as they were in the tim e of Jesus) to sometime be- tween 6540 b.c. and 4380 B.C. According to the Egyptian chronology transmitted by the priests and recorded by Ma- netho, that was the time when demigods reigned over Egypt; such a dating of the Denderah sk ies (as distinct from when the temple itself was built) corroborates the findings, men- tioned above, by Alfred Jeremias regarding the \"point zero\" of the Sumerian zodiacal calen dar. Both Egyptian and Su- merian zodiacal datings thus confirm that the concept pre- ceded the start of those civili zations, and that the \"gods,\" not men, were responsible fo r the depictions and their dating. Since, as we have shown, the zodiac and its accompa- nying Celestial Time were devised by the Anunnaki soon after they first came to Earth, some of the zodiacal dates marking events depicted on cylinder seals do stand for zo- diacal ages that preceded th e emergence of Man's civili- zations.

Incredibly but not surprisingl y, we find a suggestion that a \"starry heaven\" depicting th e celestial circle with the constellations of the zodiac might have existed in the earliest times in a Sumerian text known to scholars as A Hymn to Enlil the All-Beneficent. Describing the innermost part of Enlil's Mission Control Center in Nippur, inside the E.KUR ziggurat, the text states that in a darkened chamber called Dirga there was installed \"a h eavenly zenith, as mysterious as the distant sea\" in which \"the starry emblems\" were \"carried to perfection.\" The term DIR.GA connotes \"d ark, crownlike\"; the text explains that the \"starry emblems\" installed therein enabled the determination of festivals, meaning a calendrical func- tion. It all sounds like a forerunn er of Gudea's planetarium; except that the one in the Ekur was hidden from human eyes, open to the Anunnaki alone. Gudea's '' vault of heaven,'' c onstructed as a planetarium, bears a greater similarity to th e Dirga than to the depiction at Denderah, which was only a pa inting on the ceiling. Yet we cannot rule out th e possibility that th e inspiration for the one in the Girsu came from Egypt because of the numerous similarities to Egyptian ones that features in the Girsu bore. The list is far from being exhausted. Some of the most impressi ve finds now adorning the Assyrian and Babylonian collec tions in the major museums are colossal stone animals with bodies of bulls or lions and heads of gods wearing horned caps (Fig. 96) that stood as guardians at temple entrances. We can safely assume that these \"mythical creatures,\" as scholars call them, translated into stone sculptures the Bull-L ion motif that we illustrated earlier, thereby invoking for the temples the magic of an earlier Celestial Time and the gods associated with its past zodiacal ages.

Hints that all that should have been expected were given to Gudea—and thus to us—in the address by Ninurta to the baffled Gudea during the se cond night vision, in which Ninurta asserted his powers a nd reasserted his standing among the Anunnaki (\"By fifty edicts my lordship is or-"},{"pageNumber":188,"pageContent":"194 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 97 dained\"), pointed out his unusual familiarity with other parts of the world (\"A lord w hose eyes are lifted up afar\" as a result of his roamings in his Divine Black Bird), assured him of the cooperation of Ma gan and Meiukhah (Egypt and Nubia), and promised him that the god called \"the Bright Serpent\" will, in person, come to assist in the construction of the new Eninnu: ''As a strong place it shall be built, like E.HUSH will my holy place be.\" This last statement is truly sensational in its implica- tions. \"E\" as we already know meant a god's \"house,\" a temple; and in the case of the Eninnu—a stage-pyramid. HUSH (pronounced \"Chush\" with the \"ch\" as in the Ger- man Loch) meant in Sumerian \"of reddish hue, red- colored.\" So this is what Ninurta/Ningirsu stated: the new Eninnu will be like the \"Red-hued Divine House.\" The statement implies that the ne w Eninnu will emulate an ex- isting structure known fo r its reddish hue . .. Our search for such a structur e can be facilitated by trac- ing back the pictograph for the sign Hush.

The Red Pyramid was certainly there to be emulated when the Eninnu was built in Lagash. It was one of three pyramids attributed to Sneferu, the first pharaoh of the IV dynasty, who reigned circa 2600 b.c. His architects first attempted to build for him a pyramid at Maidum, emulating the 52° slope of the Giza pyramids that were built millennia earlier by the Anunnaki; but the angl e was too steep and the pyr- amid collapsed. The collapse led to a hurried change in the angle of a second pyramid at Dahshur to a flatter 43°, re- sulting in the pyramid nicknamed the Bent Pyramid. This led to the construction, also at Dahshur, of the third Sneferu pyramid. Considered the \"first classical pyramid\" ofapha- raoh, its sides slope up at the safe angle of about 43 1/2o (Fig. 99). It was built of local pink limestone and was therefore nicknamed the Red Pyramid. Protrusions on the sides were intended to hold in place a surfacing of white limestone; but that did not stay put for long, and today the pyramid is seen in its original reddish hue.

Had he seen the final successful em- ulation by a pharaoh and his architects of the Great Pyra- mid—the Red Pyramid of Sneferu, built circa 2600 B.C.?

For the explanation we have to turn our attention to the Divine Architect, the Keeper of the Secrets of the Pyra- mids, the god called by Gudea Ningishzidda; for he was none other than the Egyptian god Tehuti whom we call THOTH.

Wallis Budge (The Gods of the Egyptians) interpreted that to mean that Thoth was the \"god of the equilibrium\" and considered depictions of him as \"Master of the Bal- ance\" to indicate that he was associated with the equi- noxes—the time when the day and the night were balanced. The Greeks identified Thoth with their god Hermes, whom they considered to have been the originator of astronomy and astrology, of the science of numbers and of geometry, of medicine and botany.

It is also a tale of conflict, reli gious fervor, and struggles for supremacy. The notion that the calendar was devised by and for farmers so that they would know when to sow and when to reap has been taken for gr anted too long; it fails both the test of logic and of fact. Farmers do not need a formal calendar to know the seasons, and primitive societies have managed to feed themselves for generations without a calendar. The historic fact is that the calendar was devised in order to predetermine the precise time of festivals hon- oring the gods. The calendar, in other words, was a re- ligious device. The first names by which months were called in Sumer had the pref ix EZEN. The word did not mean \"month\"; it meant \"festival.\" The months were the times when the Festival of Enlil, or the Festival of Ninurta, or those of the other leading deities were to be observed. That the calendar's purpose was to enable religious observances should not surprise one at all. We find an instance that still regulates ou r lives in the current common, but actually Christian, calendar. Its principal festival and the focal point that determines the rest of the annual calendar is Easter, the celebration of the resurrection, according to the New Testament, of Jesus on the third day after his crucifixion. We stern Christians celebrate Easter on the first Sunday after the full moon that occurs on or right after the spring eq uinox. This created a problem for the early Christians in Rome, where the dominant calendrical element was the solar year of 365 days and 198"},{"pageNumber":193,"pageContent":"Calendar Tales 199 the months were of irregular length and not exactly related to the Moon's phases. The determination of Easter Day therefore required a reliance on the Jewish calendar, be- cause the Last Supper, from which the other crucial days of Eastertide are counted, was actually the Seder meal with which the Jewish celebration of Passover begins on the eve of the fourteenth day of the month Nissan, the time of the full Moon. As a resu lt, during the first centuries of Christianity Easter was celebrated in accordance with the Jewish calendar. It was only when the Roman emperor Constantine, having adopted Christianity, convened a church council, the Council of Nicaea, in the year 325, that the continued dependence on the Jewish calendar was severed, and Christianity, until then deemed by the gentiles as merely another Jewish sect, was made into a separate religion. In this change, as in its origin, the Christian calendar was thus an expression of religious beliefs and an instrument for determining the dates of worship. It was also so later on, when the Moslems burst out of Arabia to conquer by the sword lands and people east and west; the imposition of their purely lunar calendar was one of their first acts, for it had a profound religious connota tion: it counted the passage of time from the Hegira, the migration of Islam's founder Mohammed from Mecca to Medina (in 622). The history of the Roman-Chri stian calendar, interesting by itself, illustrates some of the problems inherent in the imperfect meshing of solar and lunar times and the resulting need, over the millennia, for calendar reforms and the en- suing notions of ever-renewing Ages. The current Common Era Christian calendar was intro- duced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 and is therefore called the Gregorian Calendar. It cons tituted a reform of the pre- vious Julian Calendar, so named after the Roman emperor Julius Caesar. That noted Roman emperor, tired of the chaotic Roman calendar, invited in the first century B.C. the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria, Egypt, to suggest a reform of the calendar. Sosigenes's advice was to forget about lunar time-"},{"pageNumber":194,"pageContent":"200 WHEN TIME BEGAN keeping and to adopt a solar calendar \"as that of the Egyp- tians.\" The result was a year of 365 days plus a leap year of 366 days once in four years. But that still failed to account for the extra 11 1/4 minutes a year in excess of the quarter- day over and above the 365 days . That seemed too minute to bother with; but the result was that by 1582 the first day of spring, fixed by the Council of Nicaea to fall on March 21, was retarded by ten days to March 11th. Pope Gregory corrected the shortfall by simply decreeing on October 4, 1582, that the next day should be October 15. This reform established the currently used Gregorian calendar, whose other innovation was to decree that the year begin on January first. The astronomer's suggestion that a calendar \"as that of the Egyptians\" be adopted in Rome was accepted, one must assume, without undue difficulty because by then Rome, and especially Julius Caesar, we re quite familiar with Egypt, its religious customs, and hence with its calendar. The Egyp- tian calendar was at that time indeed a purely solar calendar of 365 days divided into twelve months of thirty days each. To these 360 days an end-of-year religious festival of five days was added, dedicated to the gods Osiris, Horus, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys. The Egyptians were aware that the solar year is some- what longer than 365 days—not just by the full day every four years, as Julius Caesar had allowed for, but by enough to shift the calendar back by one month every 120 years and by a full year every 1,460 years. The determining or sacred cycle of the Egyptian calendar was this 1,460-year period, for it coincided with the cycle of the heliacal rising of the star Sirius (Egyptian Sept, Greek Sothis) at the time of the Nile's annual flooding, which in turn takes place at about the summer solstice (i n the northern hemisphere). Edward Meyer (Agyptische Chronologic) concluded that when this Egyptian calendar was introduced, such a con- vergence of the heliacal rising of Sirius and of the Nile's inundation had occurred on July 19th.

By now researchers of the ancient Egyptian calendar agree that the solar calendar of 360 + 5 days was not the first prehistoric calendar of that land. This \"civil\" or secular calendar was introduced only after the start of dynastic rule in Egypt, i.e., after 3100 B.C.; according to Richard A. Parker (The Calendars of the Ancient Egyp- tians) it took place circa 2800 b.c. \"probably for admin- istrative and fiscal purpos es.\" This civil calendar supplanted, or perhaps supplemented at first, the \"sacred\" calendar of old. In the words of the Encyclopaedia Bri- tannica, \"the ancient Egyptia ns originally employed a calendar based upon the Moon.\" According to R.A. Parker (Ancient Egyptian Astronomy) that earlier calendar was, \"like that of all ancient pe oples,\" a calendar of twelve lunar months plus a thirteenth intercalary month that kept the seasons in place. That earlier calendar was also , in the opinion of Lockyer, equinoctial and linked indeed to the earliest temple at Heliopolis, whose orientation wa s equinoctial. In all that, as in the association of months with religious festivals, the earliest Egyptian calendar was akin to that of the Sumerians. The conclusion that the Egypt ian calendar had its roots in predynastic times, before civilization appeared in Egypt, can only mean that it was not the Egyptians themselves who invented their calendar. It is a conclusion that matches that regarding the zodiac in Egypt, and regarding both the zodiac and the calendar in Sumer: they were all the artf ul inventions of the \"gods.\" In Egypt, religion and worship of the gods began in He- liopolis, close by the Giza pyramids; its original Egyptian name was Annu (as the name of the ruler of Nibiru) and it is called On in the Bible: when Joseph was made viceroy over all of Egypt (Genesis ch apter 41), the Pharaoh \"gave him Assenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the [high] priest of On, for a wife.\" Its oldest shrine was dedicated to Ptah (\"The Developer\") who, accord ing to Egyptian tradition,"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"202 WHEN TIME BEGAN raised Egypt from under the wa ters of the Great Flood and made it habitable by extensiv e drainage and earthworks. Divine reign over Egypt was then transferred by Ptah to his son Ra (\"The Bright One\") w ho was also called Tern (\"The Pure One\"); and in a special shrine, also at Heliopolis, the Boat of Heaven of Ra, the c onical Ben-Ben, could be seen by pilgrims once a year. Ra was the head of the fi rst divine dynasty according to the Egyptian priest Mane tho (his hieroglyphic name meant \"Gift of Thoth\"), who compiled in the third century B.C. Egypt's dynastic lists. The reign of Ra and his suc- cessors, the gods Shu, Geb, Osir is, Seth, and Horns, lasted more than three millennia. It was followed by a second divine dynasty that was be gun by Thoth, another son of Ptah; it lasted half as long as the first divine dynasty. Thereafter a dynasty of demigods, thirty of them, reigned over Egypt for 3,650 years. Altogether, according to Ma- netho, the divine reig ns of Ptah, the Ra dynasty, the Thoth dynasty, and the dynasty of the demigods lasted 17,520 years. Karl R. Lepsius (Konigsbuch der alten Agypter) noted that this time span represented exactly twelve Sothic cycles of 1,460 years each, thereby corroborating the pre- historic origin of calendric al-astronomical knowledge in Egypt. Based on substantial evidence, we have concluded in The Wars of Gods and Men and other volumes of The Earth Chronicles that Ptah was none other than Enki and that Ra was Marduk of the Mesopotamian pantheon. It was to Enki and his descendants that the African lands were granted when Earth was divided among the Anunnaki after the Del- uge, leaving the E.DIN (the biblical land of Eden) and the Mesopotamian sphere of influence in the hands of Enlil and his descendants. Thoth, a brother of Ra/Marduk, was the god the Sumerians called Ningishzidda. Much of the history and violent conflicts that followed the Earth's division stemmed from the refusal of Ra/Mar- duk to acquiesce in the division. He was convinced that his father was unjustly deprived of lordship of Earth (what the epithet-name EN.KI, \"Lord Earth,\" connoted); and"},{"pageNumber":197,"pageContent":"Calendar Tales 203 that therefore he, not Enlil's Foremost Son Ninurta, should rule supreme on Earth from Babylon, the Mesopotamian city whose name meant \"Gateway of the Gods.\" Obsessed by this ambition, Ra/Marduk caused not only conflicts with the Enlilites, but also aroused the animosity of some of his own brothers by involving them in these bitter conflicts as well as by leaving Egypt and then returning to reclaim the lordship over it. In the course of these comings and goings and ups and downs in Ra/Marduk's struggles, he caused the death of a younger brother called Dumuzi, let his brother Thoth reign and then forced him into exile, and made his brother Nergal change sides in a War of the G ods that resulted in a nuclear holocaust. It was in particular the on-again, off-again re- lationship with Thoth, we belie ve, that is essential to the Calendar Tales. The Egyptians, it will be recalled, had not one but two calendars. The first, with root s in prehistoric times, was \"based upon the Moon.\" The later one, introduced several centuries after the start of pharaonic rule, was based on the 365 days of the solar year. Contrary to the notion that the latter \"civil calendar\" was an administrative innovation of a pharaoh, we suggest that it too, like the earlier one. was an artful creation of the gods; ex cept that while the first one was the handiwork of Thoth, the second one was the craft- work of Ra. One aspect of the civil calen dar considered specific and original to it was the division of the thirty-day months into \"decans,\" ten-day periods each heralded by the heliacal rising of a certain star. Each star (depicted as a celestial god sailing the skies, Fig. 100) was deemed to give notice of the last hour of the night; and at the end of ten days, a new decan-star would be observed. It is our suggestion that th e introduction of this decan- based calendar was a deliberat e act by Ra in a developing conflict with his brother Thoth. Both were sons of Enki, th e great scientist of the An- unnaki, and one can safely assume that much of their"},{"pageNumber":198,"pageContent":"204 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 100 knowledge had been acquired from their father. This is certain in the case of Ra/Marduk, for a Mesopotamian text has been found that clearly states so. It is a text whose beginning records a complaint by Marduk to his father that he lacks certain healing knowledge. Enki's response is rendered thus: My son, what is it you do not know? What more could 1 give to you? Marduk, what is it that you do not know? What could I give you in addition? Whatever I know, you know! Was there, perhaps, some jealousy between the two brothers on this score? Th e knowledge of mathematics, of astronomy, of orienting sa cred structures was shared by both; witness to Marduk's attainments in these sciences was the magnificent ziggurat of Babylon (see Fig. 33) which, according to the Enum a dish, Marduk himself had designed.

He was prom- inently featured in magical healing and exorcism texts; a Maqlu (\"Burnt Offerings\") seri es of incantations and mag- ical formulas devoted a whole tablet, the seventh, to him. In one incantation, devoted to drowned mariners (\"the seafaring folk who are utterly at rest\"), the priest invokes the formulas of \"Siris and Ningishzidda, the miracle work- ers, the spellbinders.\" Siris is the name of a godde ss otherwise unknown in the Sumerian pantheon, and the possibility that it is a Meso- potamian rendition of the star's name Sirius comes to our mind because in the Egyptian pantheon Sirius was the star associated with the goddess Is is. In Egyptian legendary tales, Thoth was the one who ha d helped Isis, the wife of Osiris, to extract from the dismembered Osiris the semen with which Isis was impregnated to conceive and bear Ho- rus. This was not all. In an Egyptian inscription on an artifact known as the Metternich Stela, the goddess Isis describes how Thoth brought her son Horus back from the dead after Horus was stung by a poisonous scorpion. Responding to"},{"pageNumber":200,"pageContent":"206 WHEN TIME BEGAN her cries, Thoth came down fro m the skies, \"and he was provided with magical power s, and possessed the great power which made the word become indeed.\" And he per- formed magic, and by nighttime it drove the poison away and Horus was returned to life. The Egyptians held that the whole Book of the Dead, verses from which were inscri bed on the walls of pharaonic tombs so that the deceased pharaoh could be translated into an Afterlife, was a composition of Thoth, \"written with his own fingers.\" In a shorter wo rk called by the Egyptians the Book of Breathings, it was st ated that \"Thoth, the most mighty god, the lord of Khemennu, cometh to thee; he writeth for thee the Book of Breat hings with his own fingers, so that thy Ka shall breathe for ever and ever and thy form endowed with life on Earth.\" We know from Sumerian sour ces that this knowledge, so essential in pharaonic beliefs—knowledge to revive the dead—was first possessed by Enki. In a long text dealing with Inanna/Ishtar's journey to the Lower World (southern Africa), the domain of her sister who was married to another son of Enki, the uninvited goddess was put to death. Re- sponding to appeals, Enki fashioned medications and su- pervised the treatment of the corpse with sound and radiation pulses, and \"Inanna arose.\" Evidently, the secret was not divulged to Marduk; and when he complained, his father gave him an evasive answer. That alone would have been enough to make the ambitious and power-hungry Marduk jealous of Thoth. The feeling of being offended, perhaps even threatened, was probably greater. First, because it wa s Thoth, and not Marduk/Ra, who had helped Isis retrieve the dismembered Osiris (Ra's grandson) and save his semen, and then revived the poisoned Horus (a great-grandson of Ra). And second, because all that led—as the Sumerian text makes clearer—to an affinity between Thoth and the star Si rius. the controller of the Egyptian calendar and the harbinger of the life-giving in- undation of the Nile.

According to Manetho, the long reign of the firs t divine dynasty begun by Ra ended abruptly afte r only a short reign of three hundred years by Horus, after the confli ct that we have called the First Pyramid War. Then, inst ead of another descendant of Ra, it was Thoth who was given lordship over Egypt and his dynasty continued ( according to Manetho) for 1,570 years. His reign, an era of peace and progress, coincided with the New Stone (Neolithic) Age in the Near East—the first phase of the gr anting of civilization by the Anunnaki to Mankind. Why was it Thoth, of all the other sons of Ptah/Enki, who was chosen to replace the dynasty of Ra in Egypt? A clue might be suggested in a study titled Religion of the Ancient Egyptians by W. Osborn, Jr., in which it is stated as follows regarding Thoth: ''Though he stood in mythology in a secondary rank of deities, yet he always remained a direct emanation from, and part of. Ptah—the firstborn of the primeval de ity\" (emphasis is ours). With the complex rules of succession of the Anunnaki, where a son born to a half sister became the legal heir ahead of a firstborn son (if mothered not by a half sister)—a cause of the endless friction and riva lry between Enki (the first- born of Anu) and Enlil (born to a half sister of Ann)— could it be that the circumstan ces of Thoth's birth somehow posed a challenge to Ra/Marduk's claims for supremacy? It is known that initially the dominating \"company of the gods\" or divine dynasty wa s that of Heliopolis; later on it was superseded by the divine triad of Memphis (when Memphis became the capital of a unified Egypt). But in between there was an interim Paul or ''divine company\" of gods headed by Thoth. The \"cult center\" of the latter was Hermopolis (\"City of Hermes'\" in Greek) whose Egyptian name, Khemennu, mean t \"eight.\" One of the epithets of Thoth was \"Lord of Eight,\" which according to Heinrich Brugsch (Relig ion und Mythologie der alten Aegypter) referred to eight cele stial orientations, including the four cardinal points. It could also refer to Thoth's ability to ascertain and mark out the eight standstill points"},{"pageNumber":202,"pageContent":"208 WHEN TIME BEGAN of the Moon—the celestial body with which Thoth was associated. Marduk, a \"Sun god,\" on the other hand, was asso- ciated with the number ten. In the numerical hierarchy of the Anunnaki. in which Anu's rank was the highest, sixty, that of Enlil fifty and of Enki forty (and so on down), the rank of Marduk was ten; and that could have been the origin of the decans. Indeed, the Babylonian version of the Epic of Creation attri butes to Marduk the devising of a calendar of twelve months each divided into three \"celestial astrals\": He determined the year, designating the zones: For each of the twelve months he set up three celestial astrals, [thus] defining the days of the year. This division of the skies into thirty-six portions as a means of \"defining the days of the year\" is as clear a reference as possible to the calendar—a calendar with thirty- six \"decans.'1 And here, in Enuma elish, the division is attributed to Marduk, alias Ra. The Epic of Creation, undoubted ly of Sumerian origin, is known nowadays mostly from its Babylonian rendition (the seven tablets of the Enuma elish). It is a rendition, all scholars agree, that was intended to glorify the Babylonian national god Marduk. Hence, the name \"Marduk was inserted where in the Sumerian original text the invader from outer space, the planet Nibiru, was described as the Celestial Lord; and where, describing deeds on Earth, the Supreme God was named Enlil, the Babylonian version also named Marduk. Thereby, Marduk was made supreme both in heaven and on Earth.

A basic tenet of Sumerian"},{"pageNumber":203,"pageContent":"Calendar Tales 209 astronomy was the division of th e celestial sphere envel- oping the Earth into three \"ways\"—the Way of Anu as a central celestial band, the Way of Enlil of the northern skies, and the Way of Ea (i.e., Enki) in the southern skies. It has been thought that the three ways represented the equatorial band in the center and the bands demarcated by the two tropics, north and south; we have, however, shown in The 12th Planet that the Way of Anu, straddling the equator, extended 30° northward and southward of the equator, resulting in a width of 60°; and that the Way of Enlil and the Way of Ea similarly extended for 60° each, so that the three covered the complete celestial sweep of 180° from north to south. If this tripartite division of the skies were to be applied to the calendrical division of the year into twelve months, the result would be thirty-s ix segments. Such a division— resulting in decans—was indeed made, in Babylon. In 1900, addressing the Roya l Astronomical Society in London, the orientalist T.G. Pi nches presented a recon- struction of a Mesopotamian as trolabe (literally: \"Taker of stars\"). It was a circular disk divided like a pie into twelve segments and three concentric rings, resulting in a division of the skies into thirty-six portions (Fig. 102). The round symbols next to th e inscribed names indicated that the reference was to cel estial bodies; the names (here transliterated) are those of constellations of the zodiac, stars, and planets—thirty-six in all. That this division was linked to the calendar is made clear by the inscribing of the months' names, one in each of the twelve segments at the segment's top (the marking I to XII, starting with the first month Nisannu of th e Babylonian calendar, is by Pinches). While this Babylonian planis phere does not answer the question of the origin of the relevant verses in Enuma elish, it does establish that what was supposed to have been a unique and original Egyptian in novation in fact had a coun- terpart (if not a predecessor) in Babylon—the place claimed by Marduk for his supremacy.

The earlier one was linked to the Moon, the late r one to the Sun. In Egyptian theology, Thoth was a Moon God, Ra was a Sun God. Extending this to the two calendars, it follows that the first and older Egyptian calendar wa s formulated by Thoth and the second, later one, by Ra/Marduk. The fact is that when the time came, circa 3100 B.C.. to extend the Sumerian level of civilization (human Kingship) to the Egyptians, Ra/Marduk—having been frustrated in his efforts to establish supremacy in Babylon—returned to Egypt and expelled Thoth. It was then, we believe, that Ra/Marduk—not for ad- ministrative convenience but in a deliberate step to erad- icate the vestiges of Thoth's predominance—reformed the calendar. A passage in the Book of the Dead relates that Thoth was \"disturbed by what hath happened to the divine"},{"pageNumber":205,"pageContent":"Calendar Tales 211 children\" who have \"done ba ttle, upheld strife, created fiends, caused trouble.\" As a consequence of this Thoth \"was provoked to anger when they [his adversaries] bring the years to confusion, throng in and push to disturb the months.\" All that evil, the text declares, \"in all they have done unto thee, they have worked iniquity in secret.\" This may well indicate that the strife that led to the sub- stitution of Thoth's calendar by Ra/Marduk's calendar in Egypt took place when the cal endar (for reasons explained earlier) needed to be put back on track. R.A. Parker, we have noted above, believes that this change occurred circa 2800 B.C. Adolf Erman (Aegypt en und Aegyptisches Leben im Altertum) was more specif ic. The opportunity, he wrote, was the return of Sirius to its original position, after the 1,460-year cycle, on July 19, 2776 B.C. It should be noted that that date, circa 2800 B.C., is the official date adopted by the British authorities for Stone- henge I. The introduction by Ra/Mar duk of a calendar divided into, or based upon, ten-day pe riods may have also been prompted by a desire to draw a clear distin ction, for his followers in Egypt as well as in Mesopotamia, between himself and the one who was \"seven\"—the head of the Enlilites, Enlil himself. Indeed, such a distinction may have underlain the oscillations betwee n lunar and solar calendars; for the calendars, as we have shown and ancient records attested, were devised by the Anunnaki \"gods\" to delineate for their followers the cycles of worship; and the struggle for supremacy meant, in the final analysis, who was to be worshiped. Scholars have long debated, but have yet to verify, the origin of the week, the slice of the year measured in lengths of seven days. We have shown in earlier books of The Earth Chronicles that seven was the number that represented our planet, the Earth. Earth was called in Sumerian texts \"the seventh,\" and was depicted in representations of celestial bodies by the symbol of the seven dots (as in Fig. 94) because journeying into the center of our Solar System from"},{"pageNumber":206,"pageContent":"212 WHEN TIME BEGAN their outermost planet, the A nunnaki would first encounter Pluto, pass by Neptune and Ura nus (second and third), and continue past Saturn and Jupi ter (fourth and fifth).

Such a journey and such a count are in fact depicted on a plan- isphere discovered in the ruins of the royal library of Nine- veh, where one of its eight se gments (Fig. 103) shows the flight path from Nibiru and st ates (here in English transla- tion) \"deity Enlil went by the planets.\" The planets, rep- resented by dots, are seven in number. For the Sumerians, it was Enlil, and no other, who was \"Lord of Seven.\" Mesopotamian as well as biblical names, of persons (e.g., Bath-sheba, \"Daughter of Seve n\") or of places (e.g., Beer- Sheba, \"the well of Seven\") honored the god by this epithet. Figure 103 The importance or sanctity of the number seven, trans- ferred to the calendrical unit of seven days as one week, permeates the Bible and other ancient scriptures.

Though no one can say who \"invented\" the seven-day week, it is obviously associated in the Bible with the earliest times—indeed, when Time itself began: witness the seven days of Creation with whic h the book of Genesis begins. The concept of a seven-day delineated period of counted time, a Time of Man, is found in the biblical as well as the earlier Mesopotamian Deluge ta le, thereby attesting to its antiquity. In the Mesopotamian texts, the hero of the flood is given seven days' advance warning by Enki, who \"opened the water clock and fi lled it\" to make sure his faithful follower would not miss the deadline. In those ver- sions the Deluge is said to have begun with a storm that \"swept the country for seven days and seven nights.\" In the biblical version the Deluge also began after a seven-day advance warning to Noah. The biblical talc of the flood and its duration reveals a far-reaching understanding of the calendar in very early times. Significantly, it shows familiarity with the unit of seven days and of a division of the year into fifty-two weeks of seven days each. Moreover, it suggests an understanding of the complexities of a lunar-solar calendar. According to Genesis, the De luge began \"in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month\" and ended the following year \"in the second month, on the twenty- seventh day of the month.\" Bu t what on the face of it would appear to be a period of 365 da ys plus ten, is not so. The biblical tale breaks down the Deluge into 150 days of the avalanche of water. 150 days during which the water re- ceded, and another forty days un til Noah deemed it safe to open the Ark. Then, in two seven-day intervals, he sent out a raven and a dove to survey the landscape; only when the dove no longer came back did Noah know it was safe to step out."},{"pageNumber":208,"pageContent":"214 WHEN TIME BEGAN According to this breakdown, it all added up to 354 days (150 + 150 + 40 + 7 + 7). But that is not a solar year; that is precisely a lunar year of twelve months averaging 29.5 days each (29.5 x 12 = 354) represented by a cal- endar—as the Jewish one st ill is—alternating between months of 29 and 30 days. But 354 days is not a full year in solar terms. Recognizing this, the narrator or editor of Genesis resorted to interca- lation, by stating that the Del uge, which began on the sev- enteenth day of the second m onth, ended (a year later) on the twenty-seventh of the second month. Scholars are di- vided in regard to the number of days thus added to the lunar 354. Some (e.g., S. Gandz , Studies in Hebrew Math- ematics and Astronomy) consider the addition to have been eleven days-—the correct intercalary addition that would have expanded the lunar 354 da ys to the full 365 days of the solar year. Others, among them the author of the ancient Book of Jubilees, consider the number of days added to be just ten, increasing the year in question to only 364 days. The significance is, of course , that it implies a calendar divided into fifty-two weeks of seven days each (52 x 7 = 364). That this was not just a result of adding 354 + 10 as the number of days, but a deliberate division of the year into fifty-two weeks of seven days each, is made clear in the text of the Book of Jubilees. It states (chapter 6) that Noah was given, when the Deluge ended, \"heavenly tablets\" ordaining that All the days of the commandment will be two and fifty weeks of days which will make the year complete. Thus it is engraven and ordained on the heavenly tablets; there shall be no negl ecting for a single year or from year to year.

The insistence on a year of fi fty-two weeks of seven days, adding up to a calendrical year of 364 days, was not a result of ignorance regarding the true length of 365 full days in a solar year. The awareness of th is true length is made clear in the Bible by the age (\"five and sixty and three hundred years\") of Enoch until he was lofted by the Lord. In the nonbiblical Book of Enoch the \"overplus of the Sun,\" the five epagomenal days that had to be added to the 360 days (12 x 30) of other calendars, to complete the 365, are specifically mentioned. Yet th e Book of Enoch, in chapters describing the motions of the Sun and the Moon, the twelve zodiacal \"portals,\" the equinoxe s and the solstices, states unequivocally that the calendar y ear shall be \"a year exact as to its days: three hundred a nd sixty-four.\" This is re- peated in a statement that \"the complete year, with perfect justice\" was of 364 days—fifty -two weeks of seven days each. The Book of Enoch, especially in its version known as Enoch II, is believed to show el ements of scientific knowl- edge centered at the time in Alexandria, Egypt. How much of that can be traced back to the teachings of Thoth cannot be stated with any certainty; but biblical as well as Egyptian tales suggest a role for seve n and fifty-two times seven beginning in much earlier times. Well known is the biblical tale of Joseph's rise to governorship over Egypt after he had successfully inter- preted the pharaoh's dreams of, first, seven fatfleshed cows that were devoured by seven leanfleshed cows, and then of seven full ears of corn swallowed up by seven dried- out ears of corn. Few are awar e, however, that the tale— \"legend\" or \"myth\" to some—had strong Egyptian roots as well as an earlier counterpart in Egyptian lore. Among the former was the Egyptian forerunner of the Greek Sib- ylline oracle goddesses; they were called the Seven Hath- ors, Hathor having been the goddess of the Sinai peninsula who was depicted as a cow. In other words, the Seven"},{"pageNumber":210,"pageContent":"216 WHEN TIME BEGAN Hathors symbolized seven cows who could predict the future.

The Egyptia ns believed that after he had turned over lordship over Eg ypt to his son Ra, he retired to the island of Abu (known as Elephantine since Greek times because of its shape), where he formed twin caverns— two connected reservoirs-—whos e locks or sluices could be manipulated to regulate the flow of the Nile's waters. (The modern Aswan High Dam is similarly located above the Nile's first cataract). Figure 104 According to this text, the Pharaoh Zoser (builder of"},{"pageNumber":211,"pageContent":"Calendar Tales 217 the step-pyramid at Saqqara) received a royal dispatch from the governor of the people of the south that grievous suffering had come upon the pe ople \"because the Nile hath not come forth to the pr oper height for seven years.\" As a result, \"grain is very scarce, vegetables are lacking altogether, every kind of th ing which men eat for their food hath ceased, and every man now plundereth his neighbor.\" Hoping that the spread of famine and chaos could be avoided by a direct appeal to the god, the king traveled south to the island of Abu. The god, he was told, dwells there \"in an edifice of wood with portals formed of reeds,\" keeping with him \"the cord and the tablet\" that enable him to \"open the double door of the sluices of the Nile.\" Khnemu, responding to the king's pleadings, promised \"to raise the level of the Nile, give water, make the crops grow.\" Since the annual rising of th e Nile was linked to the heliacal rising of the star Si rius, one must wonder whether the tale's celestial or astronom ical aspects recall not only the actual shortage of water (which occurs cyclically even nowadays) but also to the sh ift (discussed above) in the appearance of Sirius under a ri gid calendar. That the whole tale had calendrical connotations is suggested by the state- ment in the text that the abode of Khnemu at Abu was astronomically oriented: \"The god's house hath an opening to the southeast, and the Sun standeth immediately opposite thereto every day.\" This can only mean a facility for ob- serving the Sun in the course of moving to and from the winter solstice. This brief review of the use and significance of the number seven in the affairs of gods an d men suffices to show its celestial origin (the seven plan ets from Pluto to Earth) and its calendrical importance (the seven-day week, a year of fifty-two such weeks).

In these circumstances the veneration of the Seven Hath- ors, as an example, must have been anathema to Ra/Marduk. Not only their number, seven, which implied veneration of Enlil; but their association with Hathor. an important deity in the Egyptian pantheon but one for whom Ra/Marduk had no particular liking. Hathor, we have shown in earlier books of The Earth Chronicles, was the Egyptian name for Ninharsag of the Sumerian pantheon—a half sist er of both Enki and Enlil and the object of both brothers' sexual attention. Since the official spouses of both (Ninki of Enki, Ninlil of Enlil) were not their half sisters, it was important for them to beget a son by Ninharsag; such a son, under the succession rules of the Anunnaki, would be the undisputed Legal Heir to the throne on Earth. In spite of re peated attempts by Enki, all Ninharsag bore him were daug hters; but Enlil was more successful, and his Foremost Son was conceived in a union with Ninharsag. This entitled Ninurta (Ningirsu, the \"Lord of Girsu\" to Gudea) to inherit his father's rank of fifty— at the same time depriving Enki's firstborn. Marduk, of rulership over the Earth. There were other manifestations of the spread of the worship of seven and its cale ndrical importance.

Archaeologists have dis- covered in the area of Saqqara a circular \"altar-top\" of alabaster whose shape (Fi g. 105) suggests that it was intended to serve as a sacred lamp to be lighted over a seven-day period. Another find is that of a stone \"wheel\" (some think it was the base of an omphalos, an oracular \"navel stone\") that is clearly divided into four segments of seven markers each (Fig. 106), suggesting that it was really a stone calendar—a lunar calendar, no doubt— incorporating the seven-day week concept and (with the"},{"pageNumber":213,"pageContent":"Calendar Tales 219 Figure 106 aid of the four dividers) enabling a lunar monthly count ranging from twenty-eight to thirty-two days.

Archaeologists see in that no more than games with which to while away the time; but the usual number of holes, fifty-eight, is clearly an allocation of twenty-nine to each player—and twenty-nine is the number of full days in a lunar mont h.

That these were calendar games and that at least one of them, the favorite of Thoth, wa n designed to teach the di- vision of the year into fifty-two weeks, is evident from an ancient Egyptian tale known as \"The Adventures of Satni- Khamois with the Mummies.\" It is a tale of magic, myst ery, and adventure, an ancient thriller that combines the ma gical number fifty-two with Thoth and the secrets of the calendar. The tale is written on a papyrus (cataloged as Cair o-30646) that was discovered in a tomb in Thebes, dating to the third century B.C. Frag- ments of other papyruses with th e same tale have also been found, indicating that it was part of the established or can- onical literature of ancient Egypt that recorded the tales of gods and men. The hero of this talc was Satni, a son of the pharaoh, \"well instructed in all thi ngs.\" He was wont to wander in the necropolis of Memphis, studying the sacred writings on temple walls and researching ancient \"books of magic.\" In time he himself became \"a magician who had no equal in the land of E gypt.\" One day a mysterious old man told him of a tomb \"where there is deposited the book that the god Thoth had written with his own hand,\" and in which the mysteries of the Earth and the secrets of heaven were reve aled.

The book was indeed at Nenoferkheptah's feet, and it \"gave off a light as if the sun shone there.\" As Satni stepped toward it, the wife's mummy spoke up, warning him to advance no further. She then told Satni of her own husband's adventures when he had atte mpted to obtain the book, for Thoth had hidden it in a secret place, inside a golden box that was inside a silver box th at was inside a series of other boxes within boxes, th e outermost ones being of bronze and iron. When her husband, Nenoferkheptah, ig- nored the warnings and the dangers and grasped the book, Thoth condemned him and his wi fe and their son to sus- pended animation: although alive, they were buried; and although mummified, they could see, hear, and speak. She warned Satni that if he touched the book, his fate would be the same or worse. The warnings and the fate of the earlier king did not deter Satni. Having come so far, he was determined to get the book. As he took another step toward the book, the mummy of Nenoferkheptah spoke up. There was a way to possess the book without incurring the wr ath of Thoth, he said: to play and win the Game of Fi fty-Two, \"the magical number of Thoth.\" Challenging fate, Satni agreed. He lost the first game and found himself partly sunk into the floor of the tomb. He lost the next game, and the next, sinking down more and more into the ground.

It is now known that it was built long before the Incas, and that its olden name was Tampu-Tocco, \"Haven of the Three Windows.\" The place, and its unique three windows, are featured in local lore regarding the origins of the Andean civ ilization when the gods, led by 224"},{"pageNumber":219,"pageContent":"Where the Sun Also Rises 225 Figure 108 Figure 109"},{"pageNumber":220,"pageContent":"226 WHEN TIME BEGAN the great creator Viracocha, placed the four Ayar brothers and their four sister-wives in Tampu-Tocco. Three brothers emerged through the three window s to settle and civilize the Andean lands; one of them founded the Ancient Empire that preceded that of the Incas by thousands of years. The three windows formed part of a massive wall con- structed of cyclopean granite stones that—as at Stone- henge—were not native to the s ite, but hauled from a great distance across towering mountains and steep valleys. The colossal stones, carefully smoothed and rounded on their surfaces, were cut into numerous sides and angles as though they were soft putty. Each stone's sides and angles fitted the sides and angles of all its adjoining stones; all these polygonal stones thus locked into one another like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, tightly fi tting without any mortar or cement and withstanding the not infrequent earthquakes in the area and other ravages of man and nature. The Temple of the Three Windows, as Bingham named it. has only three walls: th e one with the windows facing in an easterly direction, a nd two sidewalls as protecting wings. The western side is co mpletely open, providing room for a stone pillar, about seve n feet high; su pported by two horizontally placed, carefully shaped stones, one on each side, the pillar precisely faces the central window. Because of a niche cut into the pillar 's top, Bingham surmised that it might have held a beam supporting a thatched roofing; but that would have been a unique feature in Machu Picchu, and we believe that the pillar here served the same purpose as the Heel Stone (at first) at Stonehenge or the Altar Stone (later on there), i.e., as the Seventh Pillar of Gudea to provide the line of sight. Inge niously, the availability of three windows made possible th ree lines of sight—to sunrise on midsummer day, equinox day, and midwinter day (Fig. 110). The structure of the three wi ndows with the facing pillar made up the eastern part of what Bingham named, and scholars still call, the Sacred Pl aza.

A massive rectangular stone monolith, measuring fourteen by five by three feet, lies on the structure's floor below these false windows. Though the purpose of th is structure has not been determined, it is still referred to as the Principal Temple, as Bingham named this structure. Since the five-foot height of the prostrate stone did not let it serve as a seat, Bingham speculated that it might have served as an offering table, \"a species of an altar; possibly offerings of food were placed on it, or it may have been intended to receive mummies of the honored dead, which could here be brought out and worshipped on days of fes- tival.\" Though such customs are purely imaginary, the sug- gestion that the structure could have been related to festival days—i.e. to the calendar—is intriguing.

This too implies a calendrical function. A smaller enclosure that belongs to the same Megalithic Age was built as an adjunct to the Principal Temple, behind its northwest corner. It can best be described as a roofless room with a stone bench; Bi ngham assumed that it was the priest's abode, but there is nothing there to indicate its purpose. What is obvious, though, is that it was built with the greatest care of the same polygonal granite boulders, shaped and polished to perfect ion. Indeed, it is there that the stone with the most side s and angles—thirty-two!—is found; how and by whom this amazing megalith was carved and emplaced is a mystery that confounds the visitor. Right behind this enclosure th ere begins a stairway, made of rectangularly shaped but undr essed field stones that serve as steps. It winds its way upw ard, leading from the Sacred Plaza up a hill which overlooks the whole city. The top of the hill was flattened to enable the construction of an en- closure. It was also built of beautifully shaped and smoothed stones, but not of a megalithic size and not outstandingly polygonal; rather, the higher entr ance wall that creates a gateway to the hilltop and the surrounding lower walls are built of ashlars—rectangularly shaped stones that, as bricks, form masonry walls. This met hod of construction is neither of a kind with the colossi of the Megalithic Age nor of the obviously inferior structures of field stones, mortared to- gether in their irregular shapes , of which most other struc- tures at Machu Picchu are built. The latter undoubtedly belong to the Inca period; and the ashlar-built structures, as the one on the hilltop, belong to an earlier era which, in The Lost Realms, we have identified as the era of the Ancient Empire. The ashlar-built structure at op the hill was clearly in- tended only as a decorative-protective enclosure for the main feature of the hilltop. There, in the center, where the hilltop was flattened to form a platform, an outcropping of the native stone was left sticking ou t, then shaped and carved magnificently to create a polygona l base from which a short"},{"pageNumber":223,"pageContent":"Where the Sun Also Rises 229 stone column projects upward. That the stone-on-a-base served astronomical-calendrical purposes is evident from its name: Inti-huatana, which in the local tongue meant \"That which binds the Sun.\" As the Incas and their descendants explained, it was a stone inst rument for observing and de- termining the solstices, to make sure that the Sun be bound and not keep moving away for good without being pulled back to return (Fig. 111). Nearly a quarter of a century passed between the discov- ery of Machu Picchu and the fi rst serious study of its as- tronomical connotations. It was only in the 1930s that Rolf Miiller, a professor of astronom y at the University of Pots- dam in Germany, began a series of investigations at several important sites in Peru and Bo livia. Fortunately, he applied to his findings the principles of archaeoastronomy that were first expounded by Lockyer; and so, besides the interesting conclusions regarding the astronomical aspects of Machu Picchu, Cuzco, and Tiahuanacu ( on the southern shores of Lake Titicaca), Miiller was able to pinpoint their time of construction.

Muller concluded that those preintended days were su nset (Su) on the day of the winter solstice (June 21 in th e southern hemisphere) and sunrise (Sa) on the day of th e summer solstice (there, De- cember 23). He furthermore determined that the angles of the rectangular base were such that if one were to observe the horizon along a diagonal sightline connecting protru- sions 3 and 1, one would have observed sunset precisely on the equinox days at the time the Intihuatana was carved.

This makes the Intihuatana at Machu Picchu contemporaneous with, if not somewhat older than, the Eninnu in Lagash and Stonehenge II. More remarkable perhaps is the rect angular layout for the astro- nomical function of the Intihua tana's base, for it imitates the exceptional rectangular layou t of the four Station Stones of Stonehenge I (though, appa rently, without its lunar purposes). The legend of the Ayar brothers relates that the three brothers from whom the Andean kingdoms stemmed—a kind of South American version of the biblical Ham, Shem, and Japhet-—got rid of the f ourth brother by imprisoning him in a cave inside a great rock, where he was turned into a stone. Such a cave inside a cl eft great rock, with a white vertical stem or short pillar inside, indeed exists at Machu Picchu. Above it one of the most remarkable structures in the whole of South America still stands. Built of the same kind of ashlars as on the platform of the Intihuatana, and thus clearly contemporaneous wi th it, is an enclosure which on two sides forms perfect wall s at a right angle to each other, and on the other two side s curves to form a perfect semicircle (Fig. 113a). It is known the Torreon (the Tower). The enclosure, which is reached by seven stone steps, encompasses, as at the Intihuatana, the protruding peak of the great rock on which it was constructed. As with the Intihuatana, the outcropping here was also carved and given a purposeful shape; except that here no stem was made to act as a gnomon. Instead, the astronomical sightlines that run along grooves and polygonal surfaces of the \"sacred rock\" lead to two windows in th e semicircular wall. Muller, and other astronomers after hi m (e.g., D.S. Dearborn and R.E. White, Archaeoastronomy at Machu Picchu), con- cluded that the sightlines were oriented to sunrises on the days of the winter and summe r solstices—more than four thousand years ago (Fig. 113b).

Our own studies show that when the Incan buildings were not yet there, i.e., at the time of the Ancient Empire, a sightline from the Sacred Rock through the slit in this window to the Intihuatana atop the hill to the northwest would probably have indicated winter solstice sunset when the Torreon was built. The structure atop the cleft ro ck also emulated those in the Sacred Plaza in other features.

The number of false windows (seven) and pegs (six) in the lo nger wall, as in that of the Principal Temple, may indicate a calendrical need to engage in intercalation—a periodic adju stment of the lunar cycle to the solar cycle by adding a thirt eenth month every few years. Combined with the alignments and apertures for observing and determining the solstices and the equinoxes, the false windows with their pegs lead to the conclusion that at Machu Picchu someone had created a complex solar-lunar stone computer to serve as a calendar. Figure 115 The Torreon, contemporaneous with the Eninnu and with Stonehenge II, is in one respect more remarkable than the rectangular format at the Inti huatana, because it presents the extremely rare circular shape of a stone structure— extremely rare, that is, in South America, but with an ob- vious kinship to the stone circ les of Lagash and Stonehenge."},{"pageNumber":229,"pageContent":"Where the Sun Also Rises 235 According to legends and data compiled by the Spaniard Fernando Montesinos at the beginning of the seventeenth century, the Inca Empire was not the first kingdom with a capital at Cuzco in Peru. Re searchers now know that the legendary Incas, whom the Spaniards encountered and sub- jugated, came to power at Cuzco only in a.d. 1021. Long before them one of the Ayar brothers, Manco Capac, founded the city when a golde n rod given him by the god Viracocha sank into the ground to indicate the right location. It happened, by the calculatio ns of Montesinos, circa 2400 B.C.—almost 3,500 years before the Incas. That Ancient Empire lasted nearly 2,500 years until a succession of plagues, earthquakes, and othe r calamities caused the people to leave Cuzco. The king, accompanied by a handful of chosen people, retreated to the hideout of Tampu-Tocco; there, the interregnum lasted about a thousand years, until a young man of noble birth was c hosen to lead the people back to Cuzco and establish a New Kingdom—that of the Inca dynasty. When the Spanish conquerors arrived in Cuzco, the Inca capital, in 1533, they were astounded to discover a me- tropolis with some 100,000 dw elling houses surrounding a royal-religious center of magnificent palaces, temples, pla- zas, gardens, marketplaces, parade grounds. They were puz- zled to hear that the city wa s divided into twelve wards, arranged in an oval, whose boundaries ran along sightlines anchored to observation towers built on peaks encircling the city (Fig. 116). And they were awed by the sight of the city's and empire's holiest temple—not because it was su- perbly built, but because it was literally covered with gold. True to its name Cori-cancha, meaning Golden Enclosure, the temple's walls were covered with plates of gold; inside there were wondrous artifacts a nd sculptures of birds and animals made of gold, silver , and precious stones; and in the temple's main courtyard there was a garden whose corn and other growths were all artific ial, made of gold and silver. The initial scouting party of Spaniards alone removed seven hundred of those gold plates (a s well as many of the other precious artifacts)."},{"pageNumber":230,"pageContent":"236 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 116 Chroniclers who had seen the Coricancha before it was vandalized, demolished by the Catholic priests, and built over into a church, reported that the enclosed compound included a main temple, dedicated to the god Viracocha; and shrines or chapels for the worship of the Moon, Venus, a mysterious star called Coy llor, the Rainbow, and the god of Thunder and Lightning. The Spaniards nevertheless called the temple Temple of the Sun, believing that the Sun was the supreme deity wcrshiped by the Incas. It is assumed that the idea came to the Spaniards from the fact that in the Holy of Holies of the Coricancha—a semicircular chamber—there hung on the wall above the great altar an \"image of th e Sun.\" It was a great golden disk which the Spaniards assumed to represent the Sun. In reality, it had served in earlier times to reflect a beam of light as the Sun's rays penetrated the dark chamber once a year—at the moment of sunris e on the day of the winter solstice.

Significantly, the earliest part of the temple, including the Holy of Holies, was built of the same perfect ashlars as the Torreon and the walls enclosing the Intihuatana —the hallmark of the Ancient Empire era. And, not surprisingl y, careful studies and mea- surements by Muller showed th at the orientation designed to permit the beam of sunlight to travel thro ugh the corridor and bounce off the \"image of the Sun\" was conceived when the Earth's obliquity was 24° (Fig. 117), which chronolog- ically means, he wrote, more than four thousand years ear- lier. This matches the timetable related by Montesinos, according to which the Ancient Empire began circa 2500- 2400 B.C. and the assertion that the temple in Cuzco was built soon thereafter. As astoundingly early as the structures of the Ancient Empire were, they were clearly not the earliest ones, for according to the Ayar legends the megalithic Three Win- dows had already existed when the founder of the Ancient Empire, Manco Capac, and his brothers set out from Tampu- Tocco to establish kingships in the Andean lands.

But as mind-boggling as that age's structures at Machu Picchu are, they are neither the largest nor the most enigmatic ones. The prize fo r that should undoubtedly go to the ruins at Sacsahuaman, the promontory that overlooks Cuzco. Shaped like a triangle with its base toward the mountain chain of which the promontory is an edge, its two sides formed by deep gorges, its apex forms a peak that rises steeply some eight hundred feet above the city that lies at its bottom. The promontory can be divided into three parts. The widest part, forming the triangle's base, is dominated by huge rock outcroppings that someone—\"giants\" ac- cording to local lore—had cut and shaped, with incredible ease and at angles that could not possibly have been formed with crude hand tools, to form giant steps or platforms or inverted stairs, additionally perforating the rocks with twist- ing channels, tunnels, grooves, and niches. The promon- tory's middle section is formed by an area hundreds of feet wide and long that has been flattened out to form a huge level area. This flattened-out area is clearly separated from the triangular and more elevat ed apex of the promontory by a most remarkable and certainly unique stone structure. It consists of three massive walls that extend in a zigzag par- allel to each other from one edge of the promontory to the other (Fig. 118). The walls are bu ilt so as to rise one behind the other, to a combined heig ht of about sixty feet.

Recent excavations have uncovered behind the large rock outcroppings that separate the flat middle area from the rocky area leading to the northwest, where most of the tunnels and channels have been formed, one of the most unusual structural shapes in S outh America: a perfect circle. Carefully shaped stones have be en laid out so as to form the rim of a sunken area, perfectly circular. In The Lost Realms we enumerate the reasons for our conclusion that it served as a reservoir where or es—gold ores, to be specific- were processed as in a giant pan. This, however, was not the only circular structure on the promontory. Assuming that the three tiers of colossal walls were ramparts of a fortress, the Spaniards took it for granted that structural remains in the highest and narrowest part of the promontory, behind and above the walls, belonged to an Inca fortification. Prompted by local legends that a child once fell into a hole there and later emerged eight hundred feet down in Cuzco proper, local archaeologists engaged in limited excavations. They discov ered that the area behind and above the three walls was honeycombed with subter- ranean tunnels and chambers. More important, they uncov- ered there the foundations of a series of connected square and rectangular buildings (Fi g. 120a); in their midst there were the remains of a perfectly circular structure. The na- tives refer to the structure as the Muyocmarca, \"The Cir- cular Building\"; the archeologists call it the Torreon—the Tower—the same descriptive name given to the semicircular structure at Machu Picchu, and assumed that it was a de- fensive tower, part of th e Sacsahuaman \"fortress.\" Archaeoastronomers, however, see in the structure clear evidence of an astronomical function. R.T.

One such opening—an ap- erture if the higher courses forming the tower followed the ground plan—does point due sout h and thus could have served to determine sunset on nadir day. But the four other openings are clearly oriented to the northeast, southeast, southwest, and northwest—the unmistakable points of sun- set and sunrise on the winter an d summer solstice days (in the southern hemisphere)."},{"pageNumber":236,"pageContent":"242 WHEN TIME BEGAN If these are, at it appears, the remains of a full-fledged astronomical observatory, it wa s in all probabi lity the ear- liest round observatory in Sout h America, perhaps in all of the Americas. The alignment of this round observatory to the solstices puts it in the same category as the one at Stonehenge and orientationally as that of Egyptian temples. The evidence suggests, however, that after the Megalithic Age and in the era of the Ancient Empire begun under the aegis of Vira- cocha, both the equinoxes and the lunar cycle played the key roles in the Andean calendar. The chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega, describing the tow- erlike structures (see Fig. 116) around Cuzco, stated that they were used to determine the solstices. But he also de- scribed another \"calendar in st one\" that has not survived and that brings to mind the stone circle that stood on the platform in Lagash . . . Acco rding to Garcilaso, the pillars erected in Cuzco served to determine the equinoxes, not the solstices. These are his exact words: \"In order to denote the precise day of the equinoctial , pillars of the finest marble had been erected in the open ar ea in front of the Coricancha which, when the Sun came near the time, the priests watched daily to observe what shadow the pillars cast; and to make it more exact they fixed on th em a gnomon like the pin of a dial. And so, soon as the sun at its rising came to cast a direct shadow by it and at the sun's height, by midday, cast no shadow, they concluded that the sun had entered the equinoctial.\" According to the authoritative study The Andean Cal- endar by L.E. Valcarcel, such a fixing and veneration of the equinoxes was carried in to Inca times although they switched from an earlier equinoctial calendar to a solstitial one. His study brought out the f act that Inca month names accorded special significance to months corresponding to our March and September, the equinoctial months. \"The Incas believed,\" he wrote, \"that on the two days of the equinoxes Father Sun came down to live among men.\" The need to adjust the solar calendar over a period of millennia because of the phe nomenon of precession and,"},{"pageNumber":237,"pageContent":"Where the Sun Also Rises 243 perhaps, also due to the wave ring between a solstitial and an equinoctial New Year, led to repeated reforms of the calendar even in the days of the Ancient Empire. According to Montesinos, the 5th, 22nd, 33rd, 39th, and 50th monarchs of the Ancient Empire \"renewed the computation of time that had fallen into confusion.\" That such calendar reforms had to do with wavering be tween solstices and equinoxes is confirmed by the statement that the monarch Manco Capac IV \"ordered that the year be gin at the spring equinox,\" a feat possible because he was an Amauta, a \"knower of astronomy.\" But evidently in doing so he only reinstated a calendar that had once been in use, in earlier times; for, according to Montesinos, the fortieth monarch who had reigned a thousand years befo re Manco Capac IV, \"estab- lished an academy for the study of astronomy and deter- mined the equinoxes. He was knowing in astronomy and found the equinoxes, which the Indians called Illa-Ri.\" As if all that was not enough to require constant reforms, other evidence also indicates th e employment of, or at least familiarity with, the lunar calenda r. In his studies of Andean archaeoastronomy Rolf Muller reported that at a site called Pampa de Anta, some ten miles west of Sacsahuaman, the sheer rock has been carved into a series of steps that form a semicircle or crescent. Since there is nothing to view there except the promontory at Sacs ahuaman to the east, Muller concluded that the place serv ed to make astronomical ob- servations along a sightline an chored on the Sacsahuaman promontory—but, apparently, link ed to appearances of the Moon. The native name for the edifice, Quillarumi, \"Moon Stone,\" suggests such a purpose. Shackled by the notions that the Incas worshiped the Sun, modem scholars found it at first difficult to concede that Inca observations could have also included the Moon. In fact the early Spanish chronicler s stated repeatedly that the Incas had an elaborate and precise calendar incorporating both solar and lunar aspects. The chronicler Felipe Guaman Poma de Avila stated that th e Incas \"knew the cycles of the Sun and the Moon . .. and the month of the year and the four winds of the world.\" The assertion that the Incas"},{"pageNumber":238,"pageContent":"244 WHEN TIME BEGAN observed both solar and lunar cycles is confirmed by the fact that next to the shrine to the Sun in the Coricancha there was a shrine to the Moon. In the Holy of Holies the central symbol was an ellipse flanked by the Sun on the left and the Moon on the right; it was only the ruler Huascar, one of the two half brothers who were fighting over the throne when the Spaniards arrived, who replaced the oval with a golden disk representing the Sun. These are Mesopotamian calendrical features; finding them in the remote Andes has baffled the scholars. Even more perplexing has been the ce rtainty that the Incas were familiar with the zodiac—a wholly arbitrary device for di- viding the orbital circle around the Sun into twelve parts— a Sumerian \"first\" by all accounts. E.G. Squier, in his report on Cuzco and the meaning of its name (\"Navel of the Earth\"), noted that the city was divided into twelve wards ar ranged around the nucleus or \"navel\" in an elliptical shap e (Fig. 121), which is the true orbital circuit. Sir Clemens Markham (Cuzco and Lima: the Incas of Peru) quoted the chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega's information that the twelve wards represented the twelve zodiacal constellations. Stansbury Hagar (Cuzco, the Ce- lestial City) noted that, according to Inca lore, Cuzco was laid out in conformity with a s acred or divine plan to emulate the heavens, and concluded that the first ward, named \"Ter- race of Kneeling,\" represented the constellation Aries. He showed that—as in Mesopotamia —the Incas also associated each of the twelve zodiac \"hou ses\" with a parallel month in the calendar. These zodiacal months bore names that had an uncanny resemblance to their Near Eastern names that originated in Sumer. Thus, th e month of the autumn equi- nox, which equaled the month of the spring equinox and the constellation of the Bull (Taurus) when the calendar began in Sumer, was called Tupa Taruca, \"Pasturing Stag.\" The constellation of th e Maiden (Virgo), as another example, was called Sara Mama, \"Mother Maize.\" To grasp fully the extent of such similarities, one should recall that in Mesopotamia this cons tellation (see Fig. 91) was de- picted as a maiden holding a st alk of grain—wheat or barley"},{"pageNumber":239,"pageContent":"Where the Sun Also Rises 245 Figure 121 in Mesopotamia, replaced by maiz (corn) in the Andes. Hagar's conclusion that the zodiacal layout in Cuzco as- sociated the first ward with Aries rather than with Taurus as in Sumer, suggests that the city's plan was devised after the Age of Taurus had ended (due to precession) at about 2150 B.C. According to Montesinos, it was the fifth ruler of the Ancient Empire who completed the Concancha and introduced a new calendar some time after 1900 B.C. That Capac (ruler) was given the epithet Pachacuti (Reformer), and one can safely conclude that the reform of the calendar in his time was required by the zodiacal shift from Taurus to Aries—another confirmation of familiarity with the zo- diac and its calendrical aspects even in pre-Inca times in the Andes.

The requirement (still in force in the Jewish and Christian cal- endars) that the spring festival (Passover, Easter) be held when the Sun is in the rele vant zodiac house and on or immediately after the first fu ll Moon of that month, forced the ancient priest-astronomers to intercalate the solar and lunar cycles. The studies by R. T. Zuidema and others con- cluded that not only did such in tercalation take place in the Andes, but that the lunar cycle was additionally linked to two other phenomena: it had to be the first full Moon after the June solstice, and it was to coincide with the first heliacal rising of a certain star. This double correlation is intriguing, for it brings to mind the Egyptian linking of the beginning of their calendrical cycle both to the solar date (rising of the Nile) and the heliacal ri sing of a star (Sinus). Some twenty miles northeast of Cuzco, at a place called Pisac, there are remains of a structure, probably from early Inca times, that appear to have been an attempt to emulate and combine some of the sacred structures at Machu Picchu: a building one of whose sides wa s semicircular, with a crude Intihuatana in its midst.

It was there, according to the legends, that the repopulation of the Andean lands began af ter the Deluge; that the gods, headed by Viracocha, had th eir abode; that the couples destined to begin the Ancien t Empire were given knowl- edge, route instructions, and the Golden Wand with which to locate the site of the Navel of the Earth—of establishing Cuzco. Insofar as human beginnings in the Andes are concerned, the tales connected them to two distinct islands off the southern shore of Lake Titicaca. They were called the Island of the Sun and the Island of the Moon, the two luminaries having been considered as the two principal helpers of Vir- acocha; the calendrical symbolism inherent in these tales has been noted by many scholars. The abode of Viracocha was, however, in a City of the Gods on the mainland, at the lake's southern shore. The place, called Tiahuanacu, was settled by the gods (according to local lore) in times immemorial; it was, the legends related, a place of colossal structures that only giants could erect. The chronicler Pedro Cieza de Leon, who traveled throughout what is now Peru an d Bolivia in the years im- mediately following the Span ish conquest, reported that without doubt, of all the antiquities in the Andean lands, the ruins at Tiahuanacu were \"the most ancient place of any.\" Among the edifices that amazed him was an artificial hill \"on a great stone foundation\" that measured more than 900 feet by 400 feet at its base and rose some 120 feet. Nearby he saw gigantic stone blocks fallen to the ground, among them \"many doorways with their jambs, lintels, and thresholds all in one stone\" which in turn were part of even larger stone blocks, \"some of th em thirty feet broad, fifteen or more long, and six in thickness.\" He wondered whether \"human force can have sufficed to move them to the place where we see them, being so large.\" But not only the immense size of the stone blocks puzzled him; so did their \"grandeur and magnificence.\" \"For myself,\" he wrote, \"I fail to understand with what instruments or tools it could have been done, for it is certain that before these great stones"},{"pageNumber":242,"pageContent":"248 WHEN TIME BEGAN could be brought to perfection and left as we see them, the tools must have been much better than those now used by the Indians.\" He had no doubt that \"two stone idols, of the human shape and figure, the features very skillfully carved . . . that seem like small giants\" were responsible for the wondrous structures. Over the centuries most of th e smaller stone blocks have been carted away to be used in La Paz, the Bolivian capital, in railroads leading to it, and in rural areas all around. But even so, travelers continued to report the incredible mon- umental remains; by the end of the nineteenth century the reports assumed a more scientific accuracy as a result of the visits and researches by Ephrai m George Squier (Peru: In- cidents of Travel and Explora tion in the Land of the Incas) and A. Stubel and Max Uhle (Die Ruinenstaette von Tia- huanaco im Hochland des Alten Peru). They were followed earlier this century by the most renowned and tenacious researcher of Tiahuanacu, Arthur Posnansky (Tiahuanacu— The Cradle of American Man). Their work and more recent excavations and studies, revi ewed at length in The Lost Realms, have led us to conclude that Tiahuanacu was the tin capital of the ancient world, that its extensive above- ground and underground structures were metallurgical fa- cilities, that the huge one-pi ece multiwalled stone blocks were part of port facilities at the ancient lakeshore, and that Tiahuanacu was founded not by Man but by the Anunnaki \"gods\" in their search for gol d long before Man was taught the uses of tin. Where a narrow and rare plain fanned out from the south- ern shore of Lake Titicaca, the site of the once magnificent Tiahuanacu and its port ( nowadays called Puma-Punku), only three principal monument s to its past dominate the landscape. The one at the southe astern part of the ruins is the hill called Akapana, an ar tificial hill (as Cieza de Leon had observed) that was assumed to have served as a fortress; it is now known to have been more like a stage-pyramid with built-in reservoirs, conduits , channels and sluices that indicate its true purpose: a facility for the separation and processing of ores."},{"pageNumber":243,"pageContent":"Where the Sun Also Rises 249 This artificial hill, which some believe originally had the shape of a step-pyramid like that of a Mesopotamian zig- gurat, dominates the flat landsca pe. As the visitor casts his gaze about, another structure stands out. Situated to the northwest of the Akapana, it appears from a distance as a transplanted Arc de Triomphe from Paris. It is indeed a gate, intricately cut and carved out of a single cyclopean stone block; but it was not set up to commemorate a victory— rather, to enshrine in stone a marvelous calendar. Called \"Gate of the Sun,\" th e single stone block from which it was cut and shaped measured about ten by twenty feet and weighed more than one hundred tons. There are niches and geometrically accurate cutouts upon the lower part of the gate, especially on what is considered its back side (Fig. 122b). The most ela borate and enigmatic carvings are on the upper front side (F ig. 122a), facing due east. There, the arch of the gate has been carved to depict in relief a central figure—probabl y of Viracocha—flanked on each side by three rows of wi nged attendants (Fig. 123a); the central figure and three ro ws have been positioned above a meandering geometric frame so carved as to snake over and under miniature images of Viracocha (Fig. 123b). The writings of Posnansky have established that the carv- ings on the gate represented a twelve-month calendar of a year beginning on the day of the spring equinox in the southern hemisphere (Septembe r), yet a year where the other major points of the solar year—the autumn equinox and the two solstices—are also indicate d by the positions and shapes of the depicted smaller images. It was, he concluded, a calendar of eleven months of thirty days each plus a \"great month,'1 a twelfth month of th irty-rive days, adding up to a solar year of 365 days. A twelve-month year beginning on the day of the spring equinox was, as we now know, first introduced at Nippur, in Sumer, circa 3800 B.C.

Posn ansky found evidence that the back side of the Gate of the Sun was so carved out that it probably held two golden pa nels that could be swung on bronze axles; that might have enabled the astronomer-priests to angle the plates so that they reflected the sunset rays toward any desired observatio n post in the Kalasasaya proper.

The realization that this an cient structure, more than twenty thousand feet up the A ndean mountains, in a des- olate, narrow plain among snowbound mountains, was a sophisticated calendrical observatory was compounded by discoveries regarding its age. Posnansky was the first to conclude that the angles form ed by the lines of sight sug- gested an obliquity somewhat greater than the present dec- lination of 23.5°; it meant, he himself was astounded to realize, that the Kalasasaya had been designed and built thousands of years before the Common Era.

Dr. Rolf Muller, whose extensive work on other sites has already been men- tioned by us, was one of the three astronomers chosen for the task. The investigations and thorough measurements left no doubt that the obliquity prev ailing at the time of con- struction was such that the Kalasasaya could have been built circa 4050 B.C. or (as the Earth tilted back and forth) circa 10,050 B.C. Muller, who had arrive d at a date of just over 4000 B.C. for the megalithic remains at Machu Picchu, was inclined likewise to date the Kalasasaya—a conclusion with which Posnansky in the end agreed. Who was there with such sophisticated knowledge to plan, orient, and erect such calendrical observatories—and in a manner that followed the astronomical principles and calendrical arrangements devise d in the ancient Near East? In The Lost Realms we presented the evidence and arrived at the conclusion that it was the same Anunnaki. those who had come to Earth from Nibi ru in need of gold. And, like the men who searched for the golden El Dorado millennia later, they also came to the New World in search of gold. The mines in southeastern Africa were flooded by the Del- uge; but the same upheaval uncovered the incredibly rich veins of gold in the Andes. We believe that Anu and hi s spouse Antu, visiting Earth from Nibiru circa 3800 B.C., also went to see for themselves the new metallurgical center on the southern shore of Lake Titicaca. They left by sailing away on the lake from the port facilities of Puma P unku, where the cyclopean cham- bers, carved and shaped out of single stone blocks, then stood alongside massive piers. The remains at Puma Punku hold another enigmatic clue to the amazing link between the structures at Lake Titicaca and the unusual temple to Ninurta that Gudea built. To the disbelief of the site's excavators, they found that the me- galithic builders had used bronz e clamps, formed to fit T- shaped cutouts in adjoining st ones, to hold together the huge stone blocks (Fig. 125).

Recording in his inscrip- tions the unusual use of stones and of metals, this is how Gudea lauded his own achievements: He built the Eninnu with stone, he made it bright with jewels; with copper mixed with tin [bronze] he held it fast.

At some time in between, the Sphinx might have witnessed the departure of a great god—Thoth—with his followers, to be counted among the First Americans. The 500th anniversary of the epochal voyage of Co- lumbus in 1492 has been by now reclassified from dis- covery to rediscovery, and has intensified the inquiry regarding the true identity of the \"First Americans.\" The notion that settlement of th e Americas began with the trekking of family groups from Asia across a frozen land- bridge to Alaska, just before the last ice age abruptly ended, has been grudgingly giving way in the face of mounting archaeological evidence that humans arrived in the Americas many millennia ear lier, and that South Amer- ica, not North America, was the earliest arena of human presence in the New World. \"For the last 50 years, the received wisdom has been that the 11,500-year-old artifacts f ound at Clovis, New Mexico, were made soon after the first Americans found their way across the Bering landbridge,\" Science magazine (21 Feb- ruary 1992 issue) wrote in an update on the debate among scientists; \"Those who have dared question the consensus have met with harsh criticis m.\" The reluctance to accept an earlier age and a different arrival route stems primarily from the simple assumption that Man could not have crossed the oceans separating the Old and New Worlds at such 255"},{"pageNumber":250,"pageContent":"256 WHEN TIME BEGAN prehistoric times because maritime technology did not yet exist. Notwithstanding the evidence to the contrary, the rock-bottom logic continues to be, if Man couldn't do it, it didn't happen. The age of the Sphinx has recently emerged as an analogous issue, where scientists refuse to accept new evidence because it implies achievements by Man when Man could not have achieved them; and guidance or as- sistance by the \"gods\"—Extraterrestrials—is simply out of consideration. In previous books of The Earth Chronicles we have presented extensive evidence (to date unrefuted) that the great pyramids of Giza were built not by pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty circa 2600 B.C., but by the Anunnaki \"gods\" millennia earlier, as components of the landing corridor for the spaceport in th e Sinai peninsula. We ar- rived at the time frame of circa 10,000 B.C.—some 12,000 years ago—for those pyramids; and we showed that the Sphinx, built soon thereafter, had already existed on the Giza plateau when pharaonic reigns began many centuries before the Fourth Dynasty. Th e evidence we relied on and presented were Sumerian and Egyptian depictions, inscrip- tions, and texts. In October 1991, some fifteen y ears after our initial pre- sentation of such evidence in The I2th Planet, Dr. Robert M. Schoch, a Boston Universi ty geologist, reported at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America that meteorological studies of the Sphinx and its layering indi- cated that it was carved out of the native rock \"long before the dynasties of the Pharaohs.\" The research methods in- cluded seismic surveying of subsurface rocks by Dr. Thomas L. Dobecki, a geophysicist fr om Houston, and Egyptologist Anthony West of New York, a nd the study of weathering and watermarks on the Sphinx and its surroundings. The precipitation-induced weathering. Dr. Schoch stated, \"in- dicated that work on the Sphi nx had begun in the period between 10,000 B.C. and 5000 B.C., when the Egyptian climate was wetter.\" The conclusion \"flies in the face of everything we know"},{"pageNumber":251,"pageContent":"In Their Footsteps 257 about ancient Egypt,\" the Los Angeles Times added in its report of the announcement. \"Other Egyptologists who have looked at Mr. Schoch's work cannot explain the geological evidence, but they insist that the idea that the Sphinx is thousands of years older than they had thought just simply \"does not match up\" with what has been known. The news- paper quoted archaeologist Carol Redmount of the Univer- sity of California at Berkeley: \"There's just no way that could be true. . . The Sphinx was created with technology that was far more advanced than that of other Egyptian monuments of known date, an d the people of that region would not have had the technology, the governing institu- tions or the will to have built such a structur e thousands of years earlier.\" In February 1992, the Ameri can Association for the Advancement of Science, meeting in Chicago, devoted a session to the subject \"How ol d is the Sphinx?\" at which Robert Schoch and Thomas Dobecki debated their findings with two debunkers, Mark Lehne r of the University of Chicago and K.L. Gauri of th e University of Louisville. According to the Associated Press, the heated debate which spilled over into a confrontation in the hallway has not focused on the scientific merits of the meteorological find- ings, but, as Mark Lehner expressed it, on whether it is permissible to \"overthrow E gyptian history based on one phenomenon, like a weathering profile.\" The final argu- ment by the debunkers was the absence of evidence that a civilization advanced enough to carve the Great Sphinx existed in Egypt between 7000 and 5000 B.C. \"The people during that age were hunters and gatherers; they didn't build cities,\" Dr. Lehner said; and with that the debate ended. The only response to this logi cal argument is, of course, to invoke someone other than the \"hunters and gatherers\" of that era—the Anunnaki. But admitting that all evidence points to such more advanced beings from another planet is a threshold that not ever yone, including those who find the Sphinx to be 9,000 years old, is as yet ready to cross.

The discovery near Clovis, New Mexico, in 1932 of a trove of leaf-shaped, sharp- edged stone points that could be attached to spears and clubs for hunting, and subse- quently at other North American sites, led to the theory that big game hunters migrated from Asia to the Pacific northwest some 12,000 years ag o, when Siberia and Asia were linked by an icy landbridge . In time, the theory held, these \"Clovis People\" and their kindred folk spread over North America and, via Central America, eventually also to South America. This neat image of the First Americans retained its ex- clusive hold in spite of occasio nal discoveries, even in the southwestern United States, of remains of crushed bones or chipped pebbles—arguably evidence of human presence— dating some 20,000 years before Clovis. A less doubtful find has been that at Meadowcr oft rock shelter, Pennsyl- vania, where stone tools, an imal bones, and, most impor- tant, charcoal, have been ca rbon-dated to between 15,000 and 19,000 years ago—millennia before Clovis, and in the eastern part of the Un ited States to boot. As linguistic research and ge netic trace-backs joined other investigative tools, the evidence began to mount in the 1980s that humans arrived in the New World some 30,000 years ago—probably in more than one migration, and perhaps not necessarily over an icebridge but by rafts or canoes hugging the coastlines. The basic tenet—out of northeast Asia into northwest America—has, how ever, been stubbornly main- tained in spite of unsettling evidence from South America. That evidence, whose discove ry was not only ignored but even initially suppressed, pert ains primarily to two sites where Stone Age tools, crushed animal bones, and even petroglyphs have been found.

This is a date much too early to be explained by a slow south- ward migration of Clovis Pe ople from North America. Moreover, lower strata at this campsite yielded fragmented stone tools that suggest that the site's human occupation began some 20,000 years earlier. The second site is all the way on the other side of South America, in Brazil's northeast. At a place called Pc dra Furada, a rock shelter contained circular hearths fi lled with charcoal surrounded by flints; the nearest source of flint is a mile away, in- dicating that the sharp stone s were brought over inten- tionally. Dating by radioc arbon and newer methods provided readings spanning the period 14,300 to 47,000 years ago. While most estab lished archaeologi sts continue to consider the early dates \"simply inconceivable,\" the rock shelter has yielded, at the 10,000 B.C. level, petro- gylphs (rock paintings) whose age is undisputable. In one, a long-necked animal that looks like a giraffe—an animal nonexistent in the Americas—seems to have been depicted. The ongoing challenge to the Cl ovis theory in regard to the time of arrival has been accompanied by a challenge to the via-the-Bering-strait route as the sole path of arrival. Anthropologists at the Arctic Research Center of the Smith- sonian Institution in Washingt on, D.C., have concluded that the image of animal-skin clad hunters carrying spears across a frozen wilderness (with women and children in tow) is all wrong in thinking of the First Americans. Rather, they were maritime people who sailed in rafts or skinboats to the more hospitable southern shores of the Americas. Others, at the Center for the Study of the First Americans at Oregon State University, do not rule out a crossing of the Pacific via the islands and Australia (which wa s settled circa 40,000 years ago).

This is a question that (also when applied to the Age of the Sphinx) has only one answer: the Anunnaki, showing Man how to cross the oceans, telling him why and where- to—perhaps carrying him over, \"on the wings of eagles,\" as the Bible has described—to a new Promised Land. There are two instances of planned migrations recounted in the Bible, and in both th e deity was the guide. The first instance was the ordering of Abraham, more than 4,000 years ago, to \"get thee out of thy country and out of thy birthplace and from thy fa ther's house.\" He was to go, Yahweh said, \"unto the land which I will show thee.\" The second instance was the Israelite Exodus from Egypt, some 3,400 years ago. Showing the Israel ites the route to take to the Promised Land, Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud, to lead them the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give light to them, to go by day and by night.

The earliest tribes, the oral legends and the tales written down pict orially in books called codices related, came from Azt-lan, the \"White Place,\" which was associated with the number seven. It was sometimes de- picted as a place with seven cav es out of which the ancestors had emerged; alternatively, it was painted as a place with seven temples: a central large step-pyramid (ziggurat) sur- rounded by six lesser shrines. Codex Boturini contains a series of cartoonlike paintings of the early migration by four tribes that began from the pl ace of the seven temples, in- volved crossing a sea in boats and a landing in a place of cave shelters; the migrants were guided in that journey to the unknown by a god whose symbol was a kind of Seeing- eye attached to an elliptical rod (Fig. 126a). The four clans of migrants then trekked inland (Fig. 126b), passing by and following various landmarks. Splitting into several tribes, one, the Mexico, finally reached the valley where an eagle was perched upon a cactus bush—the signal for their final destination and the place where the Nahuatlan capital was to be built.

Roosevelt, the team's leader. The red-brown pottery fragments, some decorated with painted patterns , have definitely been dated by the latest technologies to be no less than seven thousand years old. They were found at a site called Sabtarem in mounds of shells and other tr ash discarded by the ancient residents, a fishing people. The date, and the fact that the pottery was painted with linear designs, put it on a par with similar pottery that appeared in the ancient Near East, in the mountains bor- dering on the plain where the Sumerian civilization blos- somed out.

A natural cavity on its top has been carved out to form a pond whose waters flow on and into the gigantic rock through channels and conduits. A cavelike cavity has been enlarged to form a large rock shelter, further carved out to form grottoes and platforms at various levels. The entrance into the rock's innards has painted above it a snake that is about twenty- two feet long, its mouth formed of three openings into the rock that are surrounded by enigmatic and undeciphered inscriptions; inside and out, the rock is filled with hundreds of painted signs and symbols. Intrigued by reports by earlier explorers and local lore that the grottoes contained sk eletons of \"giants whose faces were European in expression,\" Professor Marcel F. Hornet (Die Sohne der Sonne) explored the rock in the 1950s and provided more accurate data about it than had been known. He found that the three facades of the Pedra Pintada point in three directions: the large facade is oriented on an east- west line, and the two smalle r ones are oriented south- southeast and south-southwes t. His observation was that \"Externally, in its structural or ientation . . . this monument follows the exact identical rules of the ancient European and Mediterranean cultures.\" He considered many of the signs and symbols painted on the meticulously polished surfaces of the rock to be \"impeccably regular numerals which are not based on the d ecimal system\" but \"belong to the oldest known eastern Mediterranean cultures.\" He thought that surfaces filled with dots represented tables of multiplication, such as 9 times 7 or 5 times 7 or 7 times 7, and 12 times 12. The highlight of the rock's ancient artifacts, because of which some earlier explorers had called it the Place of the Stone Books, were dolmens —large flat stones laid across supporting stones—wei ghing between fifteen and twenty tons each.

Although the drawings on these two particular dolmens remain undeciphered, they do hol d, in our view, a number of important clues. The pe ntagonal one no doubt records some coherent tale, perhaps, as with the later Meso- american picture books, a tale of migration and the route taken. At its four corners the tablet depicts four types of people; in that it could have been a precursor of a well- known Mayan painting on the co ver of the Codex Fejervary that showed the four quarters of the Earth and (in different colors) their diverse races of people. As on the pentagonal dolmen, the Mayan depiction al so has a geometric central panel. Except for the central panel, which in Brazil is pentago- nal, the dolmen's face is covered with what appears to be an unknown script. We find si milarities between it and a script from the eastern Mediterranean known as Linear A; it was a precursor of the script of the island of Crete, and also of that of the Hittites of Anatolia (today's Turkey). The dominant symbol on the pentagonal dolmen is the serpent, also a well-known symbol of the pre-Hellenic cul- ture of Crete and ancient Egypt. In terms of the ancient Near Eastern pantheon, the serp ent was the symbol of Enki and his clan. On the oval dolmen it is depicted as a heavenly cloud, which brings to mind the the serpent symbol on Mesopotamian kudurru (Fig. 92), where it represented the Milky Way. Many of the symbols that frame the central panel on this dolmen are familiar Sumerian and Elamite designs and em- blems (such as the swastika). The larger images within the oval frame are even more revealing. If we consider the central uppermost symbol as a script element, precisely twelve symbols are left. In our view, they represent the twelve signs of the zodiac.

The significance of the Amazonian depiction can, there- fore, hardly be exaggerated. As we have pointed out, the zodiac was an entirely arbitr ary division of the celestial circle into twelve groups of stars; it was not the result of simple observation of natural ph enomena, such as the day- night cycle, the waxing and waning of the Moon, or the Sun's seasonal changes. To find the concept and knowledge of the zodiac, and moreover to have it represented by Me- sopotamian symbols, must be taken as evidence of someone with Near Eastern knowledge in the Amazon basin. No less astounding than th e decorative symbols and the zodiacal signs around the oval dolmen's face is the depic- tion in the center of the pentagonal dolmen. It shows a cir- cle of stones surrounding two monoliths, between which there appears a partly erased drawing of a human head whose eye is focused on one of the monoliths. Such a \"head with sighting eye\" can be found in Mayan astro- nomical codices, in which th e sign depicts astronomer- priests. All that, plus the astronomical orientations of the rock's three surfaces, bespeaks the presence of someone familiar with celestial observations. Who was that \"someone\"? Who could have crossed the ocean at such an early time? The crossing, admittedly, could not have taken place unaided.

The pr incipal river of the Sacred Valley of the Incas, the Uruba mba, is but a tributary of the Amazon River; so are other Peruvian rivers that flow eastward from sites whose mind-boggling remains indicate they were metallurgical processing centers. The known sites, only a fraction of what is there to be discovered if proper archaeological work were carried out, support the veracity of local traditions that people from across the Atlantic landed on those coasts and journeyed via the Amazon basin to obtain the gold and tin and other treasures of the Andes. In what used to be called British Guiana alone, more than a dozen sites have been discovered where the rocks are covered with carved pictures. At a site near Karakananc in the Pacaraima mountains, the petroglyphs (Fig. 134a) depict stars with different numbers of rays or points (a Sumerian \"first\"), the crescen t of the Moon and solar symbols, and what could have been a viewin g device next to a stairway.

As the discoveries earlier disc ussed in this chapter show, Man arrived in the Americas, an d especially in South Amer- ica, tens of thousands of year s ago.

As the carbon dating of the charcoal sa mples from the prehistoric hearths shows, Man lived there beginning some 32,000 years ago. Throughout the area, such habitation appears to have come to an abrupt end circa 12,000 years ago, concurrently with a marked change in climate. It has been our opinion that the change co incided with the abrupt end of the last ice age by the Deluge, the Great Flood. The rock art of that long period was naturalistic; the artists of the time depicted what th ey saw around them: local an- imals, trees and other vegetation, people. A hiatus of some two thousand years followed until hu- man occupation of the site resumed, when other and new groups arrived in the area. Thei r rock art suggests that they had come from a distant land, for animals not native to the area were included in the painti ngs: giant sloths, horses, an early type of llama, and (according to the excavators' re- ports) camels (which, to our eyes, looked more like gi- raffes). This second phase lasted till about 5,000 years ago and included, in its latter part, the making of decorated pottery. It also included in its art, in the words of Niede Guidon who has led the excava tions, \"abstract signs\" that \"seem related to ceremonies or mythical subjects\"—a re- ligion, an awareness of the \"god s.\" It is at the end of that phase that the transition to petr oglyphs akin to Near Eastern signs, symbols, and script make their appearance, leading in such a third phase to the astronomical and calendrical aspects of the markings on the rocks. These petroglyphs can be found at both landfall zones and along the two major cross- continent routes. The more they belong to the third phase, the more pronounced are the celestial symbols and connotations.

Unlike Sumer, which was situated in an alluvial plain with no stones therein to serve as building materials, the Enlilite domain of Anatolia was all KUR.KI, \"mountain land,\" of which Ishkur/Adad/Teshub was put in charge. The structures and edifices in the Andean lands were also made of stone—from the earli est cyclopean stoneworks through the exquisite ashlars of the Ancient Empire, down to the fieldstone buildings of the Incas and to the present. Who was there in the Andean lands knowledgeable in the use of stone for construction before the lands were popu- lated, before Andean civilization began, before the Incas? We suggest they were stonemasons from Anatolia, who quite usefully were also expe rt miners—for Anatolia was an important source of metal or es in antiquity and one of the first places to begin mixing copper with tin to make bronze. Making an on-site visit to the ruins of Hattusas, the an- cient Hittite capital, and othe r bastions nearby, some 150 miles northeast of Ankara, the capital of present-day Tur- key, one begins to realize that in some respects they rep- resented crude emulations of Andean stoneworks, even including the unique and intricat e incisions in the hard stone to create the \"stairway motif\" (Fig. 139). One has to be an expert in ancient ceramics to be able to distinguish between some of the Anatolian and Andean pottery, especially the burnish ed and polished deep ocher- rcd kind from the bronze age. One need not, however, be an expert to notice the similarity between strange warriors depicted on Peruvian artifacts from the coastal areas (Fig."},{"pageNumber":275,"pageContent":"In Their Footsteps 281 Figure 139 140a) and pre-Hellenic warriors depicted on artifacts from the eastern Mediterranean (Fig. 140b). Regarding the latter similarity, it should be borne in mind that the home of the early Greeks, Ionia, was not in Greece but in the western part s of Anatolia (Asia Minor). The myths and legends of early times, recorded in such works as Homer's Iliad, deal in fact with locations that were in Anatolia. Troy was there and not in Greece. So was the famed Sardis, capital of Croesus, king of Lydia, who was renowned for his golden treasures.

There are many indications that it was quite extensive and advanced; and once again, the impossible can be accepted as possible only if teachings by the Anunnaki are taken into account. The Sumerian King List descri bes an early king of Erech, a predecessor of Gilgamesh, thus: \"in Eanna, Meskiag- gasher, the son of divine Utu, became high priest as well as king, and ruled 324 years. Meskiaggasher went into the western sea and came forth to ward the mountains.\" How such a cross-oceanic voyage was accomplished without some kind of navigational aids , if none yet existed, is left unexplained by scholars. Centuries later, Gilgamesh, having been mothered by a goddess, went in search of immortality. His adventures pre- cede in time but exceed in dr ama those of Odysseus. On his last journey he had to cro ss the Waters or Sea of Death, which was possible only with th e assistance of the boatman Urshanabi. No sooner did the two start the crossing, than Urshanabi accused Gilgamesh of breaking the \"stone"},{"pageNumber":277,"pageContent":"In Their Footsteps 283 things\" without which the boatm an could not navigate. The ancient text records the lament of Urshanabi about the \"bro- ken stone things\" in three line s that are unfortunately only partly legible on the clay tabl et; the three begin with the words \"I peer, but I cannot. . .\" which strongly suggests a navigational device. To correct the problem, Urshanabi instructed Gilgamesh to go b ack ashore and cut long wooden poles, 120 of them. As they sailed off, Urshanabi instructed Gilgamesh to discard one pole at a time, in groups of twelve. This was repeated ten times until all of the 120 poles were used up: \"At twice-sixty Gilg amesh had used up the poles,\" reaching their destination on the other side of the sea. Thus did a specific number of poles, a rranged as instructed, sub- stitute for the \"stone things\" that could no longer be used to peer with. Gilgamesh is a known historical ruler of ancient Sumer; he reigned in Erech (Uruk) ci rca 2900 B.C. Centuries later, Sumerian traders reached dist ant lands by sea routes, ex- porting the grains, wool, and garments for which Sumer became known and importing—as Gudea has attested— metals, lumber, construction, and precious stones. Such two-way repeated voyages coul d not have taken place with- out navigational instruments. That such instruments had existed in antiquity can be judged from an object that was found in the eastern Med- iterranean off the Aegean island Antikythera at the be- ginning of this century. Sai ling through the ancient sea route from the eastern to th e western Mediterranean be- tween the islands of Crete and Kythera, two boats of sponge divers discovered the wreck of an ancient ship lying on the sea's bottom. The wreck yielded artifacts, including marble and bronze st atues, dated to the fourth century B.C. The ship itself has been dated to some time after 200 B.C.; amphorae, vess els containing wine, olive oil, and other foodstuffs, were dated to about 75 B.C. That the ship and its contents date to a time before the beginning of the Christian era thus seems certain, and so is the conclusion that it had taken on its load at or near the coast of Asia Minor."},{"pageNumber":278,"pageContent":"284 WHEN TIME BEGAN The objects and materials raised from the wreck were taken to Athens for examin ation and study.

The mechanism is considered to be a calendrical Sun and Moon computing machine dated, after the latest evidence, to circa 80 B.C. One of the most thorough stud ies on the subject is the book Gears from the Greeks by Professor Derek de Sola Price of Yale University. He found that the three broken- apart sections contained gears and dials and graded plates that in turn were assembled from at least ten separate parts. The gears were linked one to th e other on a basis of several differentials—a sophistication which we now find in auto- matic gearshift boxes in cars—th at incorporated the cycle of the Sun and the Metonic (n ineteen-year) cycle of the Moon. The gears were fitted with tiny teeth and moved on varied axles; markings on circ ular and angular parts were accompanied by inscriptions in Greek that named a number of zodiacal constellations.

Nothing coming even close to it in intr icacy has been found in sub- sequent or preceding times, in spite of the guess offered by de Sola Price that it could ha ve been made—or perhaps just repaired—at the School of Po sidonios on the island of Rhodes after the model of pl anetarium devices used by Archimedes. Though he \"sympathized with the shock one may feel at revising upwards the estimation of Hellenistic technology,\" he wrote, he could not agree with the \"radical interpretation\" by some \"that the complexity of the device and its mechanical sophistication put it so far beyond the scope of Hellenistic technology that it could only have been designed and created by alien astronauts coming from outer space and visiting our civilization.\" Yet the fact is that nothi ng coming even close to the instrument's intricacy and precision has been found any- where in any of the centuries preceding or following the"},{"pageNumber":280,"pageContent":"286 WHEN TIME BEGAN time of the shipwreck.

Strenuous studies since the map was discovered in 1929 among the Sultan's treasures have reaffirmed these puzzling features of the map. Brief notations on the map's margins are more fully ex- plained in a treatise titled Bahariyeh (\"About the Sea\") that the admiral wrote. Regarding such geographic land- marks as the Antilles islands, he explained that he obtained the information from \"the maps of the Genoese infidel, Colombo.'' He also repeated th e tale of how Columbus first tried to convince the grandees of Genoa and then the king of Spain that according to a book that he (Columbus) pos- sessed, \"at the end of the West ern Sea (Atlantic), that is on its western side, there were coasts and islands and all kinds of metals and also precious stones.\" This detail in the Turkish admiral's book conf irms reports from other sources that Columbus knew qui te well in advance where he was going, having come into possession of maps and geographic data from ancient sources. In fact, the existence of such earlier maps is also attested to by Piri Re'is.

One of the odd things about Mercator's maps of the world is that they show Antarctica, although that ice covered con- tinent was not discovered, by British and Russian sailors, until 250 years later, in 1820! As those who had preceded (and succeeded) him, Mer- cator used for his Atlas earlier maps drawn by former cartographers. In respect to the Old World, especially the lands bordering on the Mediterranean, he obviously relied on maps that went back to the time when Phoenicians and Carthaginians ruled the seas, maps drawn by Marinus of Tyre that were made known to future generations by the astronomer, mathematician, and geographer Claudius Ptol- emy who lived in Egypt in the second century a.d. For his information on the New World, Mercator relied both on olden maps and the reports of explorers since the discovery of America. But where did he get the data not only on the shape of Antarctica, but on its very existence? Scholars agree that his probable source was a Map of the World made in 1531 by Orontius Finaeus (Fig. 144a).

In fact, the forced departure of someone into exile was a form of punishment begun by the gods, a nd the first ex iles were leaders of the Anunnaki them selves. Such forced deporta- tions, first of gods and then of people, have changed the course of history. They also le ft their mark on the calendar, and were linked to the coming of a New Age. When the Spaniards, and then other Europeans, realized how numerous were the similar ities in traditions, customs, and beliefs between those of the American natives and those that have been associated wi th the Bible and the Hebrews, they could think of no other e xplanation but that the \"In- dians\" were descendants of the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.

Yet, unknowingly, the Spaniards were right in attribut ing the beginning of a formal civilization, with it s own calendar, in the Americas to an exile; but not of a people—ra ther, the exile of a god. The peoples of Mesoamerica—the Maya and Aztecs, Tol- tecs and Olmecs and lesser known tribes—had three cal- endars. Two were cyclical, meas uring the cycles of the Sun and the Moon and of Venus. The other was chronological, measuring the passage of time from a certain starting point, \"Point Zero.\" Scholars have established that this Long Count calendar's starting point wa s in the year that is des- ignated under the Western cale ndar as 3113 B.C., but they know not what that starting poi nt signifies. In The Lost Realms we have suggested that it marked the date of the arrival of Thoth, with a small band of aides and followers, in America. QuetzalcoatI, the Great God of the Mesoamericans, was none other than Thoth, we have suggested. His epithet, the Plumed or Winged Serpent, was well known in Egyptian iconography (Fig. 145).

The two without doubt reveal the handiwork of \"someone\" familiar with the much earlier calendars of the Near East. First of the two was the H aab, a solar-year calendar of 365 days that was subdivided into 18 months of 20 days each, plus an additional five special days at year's end. Although the 18 x 20 division is different from the Near Eastern one of 12 x 30, this calendar was basically an adaptation of the Egyptian calend ar of 360 days plus 5. That purely solar calendar, as we ha ve seen, was the one favored by Ra/Marduk; changing its subdivision could have been a deliberate act by Thoth to make it differ from that of his rival. That purely solar calendar di d not allow for intercala- tion—-a device that, in Mesopot amia, was expressed in the addition of a thirteenth month once in a given number of years. In Mesoamerica this num ber, 13, featured in the next calendar. As in Egypt, which had both a secular (pure solar-year) calendar as well as a sacred one, so was the second Meso- american calendar that of th e Sacred Year called Tzolkin. In it the division into 20 also played a role; but it was counted in a cycle that rotated 13 times—the number inserted into the Haab calendar. That 13 x 20 resulted in a total of only 260 days. What this number , 260, represented or how it had originated has engendered many theories but no certain solutions. What is significant, calendrically and historically, is that these two cyclical cal endars were meshed together. as gear wheels lock their teeth together (see Fig. 9b), to create the grand Sacred Round of fifty-two solar years; for the combination of 13, 20 and 365 could not repeat itself except once in 18,980 days, which meant fifty-two years. This grand cycle of fifty-two years was sacred to all the peoples of Mesoamerica, and they related to it events both past and future. It lay at the core of the events associated with the greatest Mesoamerican deity, Quetzalcoatl (\"The Plumed Serpent\"), who having come to those lands from across the eastern seas was fo rced by the God of War to go into exile, but vowed to return in the year \"1 Reed\" of the"},{"pageNumber":289,"pageContent":"Exiles on a Shifting Earth 295 fifty-two-year Sacred Cycle.

The centrality of the number fifty-two, if nothing else, as a hallmark of religious an d messianic Mesoamerican be- liefs and expectations, pointed to a key similarity between Quetzalcoatl and his Sacred Calendar and Thorn's calendar of fifty-two. The Game of Fi fty-two was Thoth's game, and the Tale of Satni earlier related clearly stated that \"fifty- two was the magical number of Thoth.\" We have already explained the significance, in terms of Thoth's feud with Ra/Marduk, of the Egyptian cal endar of fifty-two weeks. The Mesoamerican \"fifty-two \" had \"Thoth\" stamped all over it. Another hallmark of Thoth wa s the application of a cir- cular design to edifices related to the calendrical observa- tions of the heavens. The Mesopotamian ziggurats were squarish, with their corners al igned to the cardinal points. Near Eastern temples—Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Canaan- ite, even Israelite—were recta ngular structures whose axis was oriented either to the equi noxes or the solstices (a plan still manifest in churches a nd temples of our days). Only in the unique edifice that Thoth helped build in Lagash was a circular shape adopted. Its only other Near Eastern em- ulation was at the temple dedi cated to Hathor (i.e. Ninhar- sag) at Denderah; and at St onehenge, near where the Old World faces the New World on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In the New World, in the domain of Adad, the younger son of Enlil and chief deity of the Hittites, the usual rec- tangular shape and orientatio n of Mesopotamian temples predominated.

Another major south- ern Andes temple, a focal point of sacred pilgrimages, was the one dedicated to the Grea t Creator that stood atop a promontory looking out to the ex panse of the endless Pacific (not far south from present-day Lima). It too was rectangular in shape. Judging by the design of thes e structures, Thoth was not invited there to take a hand in their construction. But if, as we believe, he was the Divine Architect of the circular observatories, he was certainly present in the Sacred Valley. His hallmarks among the structur es of the Megalithic Age were the Round Observatory atop the Sacsahuaman prom- ontory, the semicircular Holy of Holies in Cuzco, the Tor- reon in Machu Picchu. The actual domain of Quetzalcoatl/Thoth was Mesoamer- ica and Central America, the lands of the Nahuatl-speaking and Mayan tribes; but his influence extended southward into the northern parts of the South American continent. Petro- glyphs found near Cajamarca in the north of Peru (Fig. 146) that depict the Sun, the Moon, fi ve-pointed stars, and other celestial symbols, show repeated ly next to them the symbol of the serpent—the unmistakab le emblem of Enki and his clan and specifically so of the deity known as the \"Plumed Serpent.''

Both Nahua tlan traditions, as well as Mayan ones in such forms as the Legend of Votan, recount the arrival of \"the Fathers and the Mothers,\" the tribal ancestors, from across the seas. The Annals of Cakchiquels, a Nahuatlan record, states that while they themselves came from the west, there were others who had come from the east, in both instances \"from the other side of the sea.\" The Legend of Votan, who had built the first city that was the cradle of Mesoamerican civilization, was written down by Spanish chroniclers from oral Mayan traditions. The emblem of Votan, they recorded, was the serpent; \"he was a descendant of the Guardians, of the race of Can.\" \"Guard- ians\" was the meaning of the Egyptian term Neteru (i.e. \"gods\"). Can, studies such as that by Zelia Nuttal (Papers of the Peabody Museum) have suggested, was a variant of Canaan who was (according to the Bible) a member of the Hamitic peoples of Africa and a brother-nation of the Egyptians. The possibility, which we have already mentioned, that the earliest migrants might have been descendants of Cain, relates Nahuatlan beginnings to one of the first recorded forced deportations: the exiling of Cain as punishment for the killing of Abel. The very first one, according to the Bible, was the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. In our times the exiling of kings has been a known occurrence; the exiling of Napoleon to the island of St. Helena is a notorious example.

Next in significance was a Grand Cycle of \"perfect years\" that encompassed thirteen eras of baktuns, units of four hundred ye ars that were a key element in the consecutive calenda r known as the Long Count. The smallest unit in the Long Count calendar was the kin, a single day, and it was built up to larger numbers that could run into the millions of days by a series of multipli- cations, by 20 and by 360: 1 kin = 1 day 1 uinal = 1 kin x 20 = 20 days 1 tun =1 kin x 360 = 360 days 1 ka-tun = 1 tun x 20 = 7,200 days 1 bak-tun = I ka-tun x 20 = 144,000 days As a purely arithmetical exercise the multiplications by twenty could continue, increasing the number of days that each term and its specific glyph represented, going on to 2,880,000 and 57,600,000 and so on.

He deemed the number 5,200 a key to under- standing Mayan cosmogony and ages past and future. In the 1930s Fritz Buck (El Calendario Maya en la Cul- tura de Tiahuanacu), seeing comparable elements between the Mayan calendars and that of Tiahuanacu, considered the starting date and other periodica l markers to be related to actual events affecting the American peoples. He believed that a key symbol on the Gate of the Sun represented 52 and another one 520, and accepted as historically significant the number of 5,200 years; he held, however, that not one but two Great Cycles have to be considered, and that since 1,040 years remain in the second Great Cycle, the first one began in 9360 b.c. It was then, he held, that the legendary events and the tales of the gods in the Andes began. The second Great Cycle, accordingly, began at Tiahuanacu in 4160 b.c.

The gods, he said, \"have made an uproar, they have taken to quarreling, they have done evil deeds, they have created rebellion.\" They must have belittled Ra/Marduk in the course of their rebellion: \"They have made the great into small.\" Ra, the Great God, pointed an accusing finger at Thoth; the accusation directly concerne d changes in the calendar: Thoth, Ra accused, \"their years cut short, their months had curbed.\" This Thoth had achieved by \"the destruction of Hidden Things that were made for them.\" While the nature of the Hidden Things whose destruction shortened the year and the months remains unknown, the outcome could have only meant a switch from the longer solar year to the shorter lunar year—the \"making of the great into small.\" The text ends with Thoth's accepting a sentence of exile and banishment: \"I am departing to the desert, the silent land.\" It is such a tough place, the text explains, that \"sexual pleasure s are not enjoyed in it\" . . . Another little-understood hier oglyphic text, found in one of Tutankhamen's shrines as well as in royal tombs in Thebes, may have recorded the expulsion order by Ra/Mar- duk and gave among the reason s the calendrical conflict between the \"Sun god\" and the \"Moon god\" (Thoth). The text, which scholars are certain originated at a much earlier time, relates how Ra ordered that Thoth be summoned to him. When Thoth came befo re Ra, Ra announced: \"Behold ye, I am here in the sky in my proper place.\" Proceeding to berate Thoth and \"those who perform deeds of rebellion against me,\" Ra told Thoth: \"Thou encompasseth the two heavens with thy shining rays; that is, Thoth as the Moon encompasses.\" And he told Thot h: \"I shall therefore have thee go all the way around, to the place Hau-nebut.\" Some"},{"pageNumber":303,"pageContent":"Exiles on a Shifting Earth 309 scholars title the text \"The assignment of functions to Thoth.\" In fact, it was the \"a ssignment\" of Thoth to an unidentified distant land because of his \"functions\"—ca- lendrical preferences—r elating to the Moon. The exiling of Thoth was treated in Mesoamerican time- keeping as Point Zero of the Long Count—-according to accepted chronology, in the year 3113 B.C. It must have been an event whose repercussions were recalled far and wide, for it could not be a mere coincidence that according to Hindu traditions (that also divide Earth's history and prehistory into Ages) the present Age, the Kaliyuga, began on a day equivalent to midnight between February 17 and 18 in 3102 B.C. This date is un cannily close to the date of Point Zero of the Mesoamerican Long Count, and is, there- fore, in some way connected to the exiling of Thoth. But no sooner than Marduk/Ra forced Thoth to leave the African domains, did he himself become the victim of a similar fate: exile. With Thoth gone and his brothe rs Nergal and Gibil remote from the center of Egyptian power, Ra/Marduk could have expected an undisturbed supremacy there. But a new rival had emerged on the scene. He was Dumuzi, the youngest son of Enki, and his domain was the grasslands south of Upper Egypt. Unexpectedly, he emerged as a pretender to the Lordship over Egypt; and as Marduk soon discovered, the ambitions were prompted by a love affair of which Marduk was most disapprovi ng. Preceding by millennia the setting and principals in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, Dumuzi's bride was none other than Inanna/Ishtar, a grand- daughter of Enlil and one who had fought alongside her brother and uncles to defeat the Enki'ites in the Pyramid Wars. With limitless ambition, Inanna saw in the espousement with Dumuzi a great role for herself—if only he were to cease being just the Herder (as his epithet was) and assume lordship over the great Egyptia n nation: \"I had a vision of a great nation choosing Dumuzi as God of its country,\" she later confided, \"for I have ma de Dumuzi's name exalted, I gave him status.\""},{"pageNumber":304,"pageContent":"310 WHEN TIME BEGAN Opposing the bethrothal and enraged by such ambitions, Marduk sent his \"sheriffs\" to arrest Dumuzi. Somehow the arrest went wrong; and Dumuzi, trying to hide in his sheep- folds, was found dead. Inanna raised \"a most bitter cry\" and sought vengeance. Marduk, fearing her wrath, hid inside the Great Pyramid, all the while asserting his innocence because the death of Dumuzi was unintended, accidental. Unrelenting, Inanna \"ceased not striking\" at the pyramid, \"at its corners, even its multitude of stones.\" Marduk issued a warning that he would resort to the use of awesome weapons \"whose out- burst is terrible.\" Fearing anot her terrible war, the Anunnaki convened the supreme court of the Seven Who Judge. It was decided that Marduk must be punished, but since he did not directly kill Dumuzi, he could not be sentenced to death. The verdict was therefore to bury Marduk alive in the Great Pyramid within which he took refuge, by her- metically sealing it with him inside. Various texts, quoted by us at length in The Wars of Gods and Men, relate the ensuing events, the commutaion of Marduk's sentence, and the dramatic effort to cut through the massive pyramid, using its original architectural draw- ings, to reach Marduk in time. The step-by-step rescue is described in detail. So is the conclusion of the incident: Marduk was sentenced to exile, and in Egypt Ra became Amen—the Hidden One, a god no longer seen. As for Inanna, robbed by Dumuzi's death of her dream of being the Lady of Egypt, sh e was given Erech to be her \"cult center\" and the domain of Aratta to become the third region of civilization—that of the Indus Valley—circa 2900 B.C.

In Mesopotamia Inanna, ruthless and cunning, maneu- vered the kingship of Sumer into the hands of a gardener whom she had found to be a man to her liking. She named him Sharru-kin, \"righteous ruler,\" known to us as Sargon I. With Inanna's help he expanded his domains and created a new capital for a greater Sumer hence to be known as Sumer and Akkad. But seeking legitimacy, he went to Baby- lon—Marduk's city—and there removed some of its hal- lowed soil to use for foundations in his new capital. That was the opportunity for Marduk to reassert himself. \"On account of the sacrilege thus committed,\" Babylonian texts recorded, \"the great lord Marduk became enraged\" and destroyed Sargon and his people ; and, of course, reinstated himself in Babylon. There he be gan to fortify the city and enhance its underground water system, making it imper- vious to attack. As the ancient texts reveal, it all had to do with Celestial Time. Alarmed by the prospect of yet another devastating War of the Gods, the Anunnaki met in council. The chief an- tagonist was Ninurta, the heir apparent of Enlil, whose birthright Marduk was directly challenging. They invited Nergal, a powerful brother of Marduk, to join them in seek- ing a peaceful solution to the looming conflict. Mixing com- pliments with persuasion, Nergal first calmed down Ninurta, then agreed to go to Babylon similarly to persuade Marduk to step back from an armed confrontation. The chain of events, with dramatic and in the end fateful turns and con- sequences, is described in detail in a text known as the Erra Epos (Erra having been an epithet of Nergal). It includes many of the verbal exchanges between the participants as though a stenographer were pres ent; and indeed, the text (as its postscript attests) was di ctated to a scribe after the events by one of the participating Anunnaki. As the story unfolds, it beco mes increasingly clear that what was happening on Earth ha d been related to the heav- ens—to the constellations of the zodiac. In retrospect, the"},{"pageNumber":306,"pageContent":"312 WHEN TIME BEGAN statements and positions taken by the contestants for the supremacy on Earth—Marduk the son of Enki and Ninurta the son of Enlil—lead to no other conclusion than that the issue was the coming of a Ne w Age: the impending change from the zodiac house of the bull (Taurus) to the zodiac house of the ram (Aries) as the one in which the spring equinox, and thus the calendrical moment for the New Year, would occur. Listing all his attributes an d heirlooms, Ninurta thus asserted: In Heaven I am a wild bull, On Earth I am a lion. In the land I am the lord, among the gods I am the fiercest. The hero of the Igigi I am, among the Anunnaki I am powerful. The statement asserts verbally what the depictions, such as we have shown in Fig. 93, have illustrated pictorially: the zodiacal time when the spring equinox began in the House of the Bull (Taurus) and the summer solstice occurred in the zodiac of the Lion (Leo ) belonged to the Enlilites, whose \"cult animals\" were the Bull and the Lion. Carefully, choosing his words, Nergal formulated his an- swer to the assertive Ninurta. Ye s, he said, all that is true. But On the mountaintop, in the bush-thicket, see you not the Ram? Its emergence, Nergal c ontinued, is unavoidable: In that grove, even the supermost time measurer, the bearer of the standards, the course cannot change.

In its relentless precessional retardation, while the zo- diacal constellation of the Bu ll was still dominant, \"on the rim of the Sun's orbit\" one c ould already see the approach- ing Age of the Ram. But while the change was unavoidable, the time for it had not yet come. \"The other gods are afraid of battle,\" Nergal said in conclusion. It could all be explained to Mar- duk, he felt. \"Let me go and summon the prince Marduk away from his dwelling,\" ma ke him leave peacefully, Ner- gal suggested. And so, with Ninurta's reluctant consent, Nergal set out on a fateful mission to Babylon. On the way he stopped at Erech, seeking an oracle from Anu at his temple, the E.ANNA. The message he carri ed to Marduk from \"the king of the gods\" was this: the Time has not yet come. The Time in question, the conversation-debate between Nergal and Marduk makes clear , was the impending zodia- cal change—the coming of a New Age. Marduk received his brother in the E.SAG.IL, the ziggurat-temple of Baby- lon; the meeting took place in a sacred chamber called SHU.AN.NA, \"The Celestially Supreme Place,\" which evidently Marduk deemed the most suitable place for the discussion; for he was certain that his time had come, and even showed Nergal the instrume nts he used to prove it. (A Babylonian artist, depicting th e encounter between the two brothers, showed Nergal w ith his identifying weapon, and a helmeted Marduk standing atop his ziggurat and holding in his hand a device—Fig. 153—that looks very much like the viewing instruments that were employed in Egypt at the temples of Min.) Realizing what had happened, Nergal argued to the con- trary. Your \"preci ous instrument,\" he told Marduk, was imprecise, and that is what had caused him to interpret incorrectly \"the glow of the h eavenly stars as the light of"},{"pageNumber":308,"pageContent":"314 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 153 the ordained day.\" While in your sacred precinct you have concluded that \"on the crown of your lordship the light did shine,\" it was not so at the Eanna, where Nergal had stopped on his way. There, Nergal said, \"the face of E.HAL. AN.KI in the Eanna remains covered over.'' The term E.HAL.AN.KI literally means \"House of the circling of Heaven-Earth\" and, in our view, suggests the location of instruments for determining the Earth's precessional shift. But Marduk saw the issue differently. Whose instruments were really incorrect? At the time of the Deluge, he said, the \"regulations of Heaven-Ear th shifted out of their groove and the stations of the celes tial gods, the stars of heaven, have changed and did not return to their [former] places.\" A major cause of the change, Marduk claimed, was the fact that \"the Erkallum quaked an d its covering was diminished, and the measures could no longer be taken.\" This is a highly significant statement, whose scientific importance—as that of the full text of the Erra Epos—has been ignored by scholars. Erkall um used to be translated \"Lower World\" and more recently the term is left intact, untranslated, as a word whose precise meaning is undeter- mined. We suggest that it is a term that denotes the land at the bottom of the world—Antar ctica; and that the \"cov-"},{"pageNumber":309,"pageContent":"Exiles on a Shirting Earth 315 ering\" or more literally \"hair-growth-over\" is a reference to the ice cap that, Marduk cl aimed, was still diminished millennia after the Deluge. When it was all over, Marduk continued, he sent emis- saries to check the Lower World. He himself went to take a look. But the '\"covering,\" he said, \"had become hundreds of miles of water upon the wide seas\": the ice cap was still melted. This is a statement that corr oborates our assertion, in The 12th Planet, that the Deluge was an immense tidal wave caused by the slippage of the Antarctic ice covering into the adjoining ocean, some 13,000 years ago. The event was the cause, we held, of the abrupt end of the last ice age and the climatic change it had br ought about. It also left the Antarctic continent bare of its ice covering, enabling the seeing—and, evidently, mapping—of that continent as its landmass and shorelines really are. The implication of Marduk s statement that the \"regu- lations of Heaven-Earth had sh ifted out of their groove\" as a result of the melting of the immense ice cap and the redistribution of its weight as water all over the world's seas, bears further study. Did it imply a change in Earth's declination? A somewhat diffe rent retardation and thus a different precessional schedule? Perhaps a slowing down of the Earth's spin, or of its or bit around the Sun? The results of experiments simulating the Earth's motions and wobbles with and without an Antarc tic ice mass could be most illuminating. All that, Marduk said, was aggravated by the fate of instruments in the Abzu, the s outheastern tip of Africa. We know from other texts that th e Anunnaki had a scientific station there that monitored the situation before the Deluge and was thus able to alert them to the impending calamity. \"After the regimen Heaven -Earth was undone,\" Marduk continued, he waited until th e fountains dried up and the floodwaters receded. Then he \"went back and looked and looked; it was very grievous.\" What he had discovered was that certain instruments \"that to Anu's heaven could reach\" were missing, gone.

We have earlier referred to an Egyptian text in which Ra/ Marduk accused Thoth of destroying \"the Hidden Things\" that were used for determining the Earth's motions and calendar; the rhetorical questio ns thrown at Nergal imply deliberate wrongdoing against Marduk. In such circum- stances, Marduk indicated, was he not right to rely on his own instruments to determine when his Time—the Age of the Ram—had arrived? Nergal's full response is unclear because where it begins several lines on the tablet ha ve been damaged. It appears that based on his own vast African domains, he did know where some of the instruments (or their replacements) were. He thus suggested that Marduk go to the indicated sites in the Abzu and verify it all for himself. He was certain that thereupon Marduk would realize th at his birthright was not at risk; what was being challenged was the timing of his ascendancy. To put Marduk further at ease. Nergal promised that he would personally see to it that nothing would be disturbed in Babylon during Marduk's absence. And, as a final gesture of reassurance, he promised to make the celestial symbols of the Enlilite Age, \"the bulls of Anu and Enlil, crouch at the gate of thy temple.\" Such a symbolic act of obeis ance, the bowing to Marduk of Enlil's Bull of Heaven at the entrance to Marduk's tem- ple, persuaded Marduk to accept his brother's plea: Marduk heard this.

Thus did the dispute regarding the correct timing of the zodiacal change lead to Ma rduk's second exile—temporary only, he believed. But as fate would have it, the anticipated coming of a New Age was not to be a peaceful one."},{"pageNumber":312,"pageContent":"12 THE AGE OF THE RAM When the Age of the Ram finally arrived, it did not come as the dawn of a New Age. Rather, it was accompanied by darkness at noon—the darkness of a cloud of deadly radia- tion from the first-ever expl osion of nuclear weapons on Earth. It came as the culmination of more than two centuries of upheavals and warfare that pitted god against god and nation against nation; and in its aftermath, the great Su- merian civilization that had lasted for nearly two millennia lay prostrate and desolate, its people decimated, its remnants dispersed in the world's first Diaspora. Marduk did indeed gain supremacy; but the New Order that ensued was one of new laws and customs, a new religion and beliefs; an era of regression in sciences, of astrology instead of astron- omy—even of a new and lesser status for women. Did it have to happen that way? Was the change so dev- astating and bitter just because it involved ambitious pro- tagonists—because the Anunnaki, not men, had directed the course of events? Or was it all destined, preordained, and the force and influence—real or imagined—of the passage into a new zodiacal house so overwhelming that empires must topple, religions must change, laws and customs and social organization must be overturned? Let us review the record of that first known changeover; perchance we may find full answers, for sure enlightening clues. It was, by our calculations, circa 2295 B.C. that Marduk left Babylon, going first to th e Land of Mines and then to regions unspecilied by the Meso potamian texts. He left on the understanding that the instruments and other \"works of wonder\" that he had put up in Babylon would remain un- 318"},{"pageNumber":313,"pageContent":"The Age of the Ram 319 disturbed; but no sooner did Marduk leave, than Nergal/ Erra broke his promise. Out of mere curiosity, or perhaps with malice in mind, he entered the forbidden Gigunu, the mysterious chamber that Marduk had declared off limits. Once inside he caused the chamber's \"brilliance\" to be removed; thereupon, as Mar duk had warned, \"the day turned into darkness,\" and calamities started afflicting Bab- ylon and its people. Was the \"brilliance\" a radi ating, nuclear-driven device? It is not clear what it was, except that the adverse effects began to spread throughout Mesopotamia. The other gods were angered by Nergal's deed; even his father Enki rep- rimanded him and ordered him back to his African domain, Kutha. Nergal heeded the order; but before leaving he smashed all that Marduk had set up, and left behind his warriors to make sure that Marduk's followers in Babylon would remain subdued. The two departures, first of Marduk and then of Nergal, left the arena free for the descendants of Enlil. First to take advantage of the situation was Inanna (Ishtar); she chose a grandson of Sargon, Naram-Sin (\"Sin's Favorite\") to as- cend the throne of Sumer and Akkad; and with him and his armies as her surrogates, she embarked on a series of con- quests. Among her first targets was the great Landing Place in the Cedar Mountains, the immense platform of Baalbek in Lebanon. She then assaul ted the lands along the Medi- terranean coast, seizing Mission Control Center in Jerusalem and the crossing point on the land route from Mesopotamia to the Sinai, Jericho. Now the spaceport itself, in the Sinai peninsula, was under her contro l. But, unsatisfied, Inanna sought to fulfill her dream of dominating Egypt—a dream shattered by the death of Dumuzi. Guiding, urging, and arming Naram-Sin with her ''awesome weapons,'' she brought about the invasion of Egypt. The texts suggest that recogn izing her as an avowed ad- versary of Marduk, Nergal gave her his actual or tacit as- sistance in that invasion.

An Assembly of the Gods was convened in Nippur to deal with Inanna's excesses. As a result, an order for her arrest and trial was issued by Enlil. Hearing that, Inanna forsook her temple in Agade, Naram-Sin's capital, and es- caped to hide with Nergal. Fr om afar, she sent orders and oracles to Naram-Sin, encouraging him to continue the con- quests and bloodshed. To count eract that, the other gods empowered Ninurta to bring ov er loyal troops from neigh- boring mountainous lands. A text titled The Curse of Agade describes those events and the vow of the Anunnaki to obliterate Agade. True to that vow, the city—once the pride of Sargon and the dynasty of Akkad—was never to be found again. The relatively brief Era of Ishtar had come to an end; and to bring some measure of order and stability to Mesopotamia and its neighboring lands, Ninur ta (under whom Kingship had started in Sumer) was again given command of the country. Before Agade was destroyed, Ninurta its \"crown- band of lordship, the tiara of kingship, the throne given to rulership, to his temple brought over.\" At that time his \"cult center\" was in Lagash, at its Girsu sacred precinct. From there, flying in his Divi ne Black Bird, Ninurta roamed the plain between the two rivers and the adjoining moun- tainlands, restoring irrigation and agriculture, returning or- der and tranquility. Setting personal examples by his unwavering fidelity to his spouse Bau (nicknamed Gula, \"the Great\") with whom he had portraits made (Fig. 154), and devoted to his mother Ninharsag, he proclaimed moral laws and codes of justice. To assist in these tasks he ap- pointed human viceroys; circa 2160 b.c, Gudea was the chosen one. Over in Egypt, in the afterm ath of the exile of Marduky Ra, Naram-Sin's invasion and the reprimand to Nergal, the country was in disarray.

Political, religious, and calendrical issues were involved; underlying the human contest wa s the celestial confrontation between the Bull and the Ram. From the very beginning of Egyptian dynastic rule and religion, the greatest celestial compliment to the great gods was to compare them to the Bull of Heaven. Its earthly symbol, the Sacred Bull Apis (Fig. 155a) was venerated at Heliopolis and Memphis. Some of the earliest pictographic inscriptions—so old that Sir Fl inders Petrie (Royal Tombs) attributed them to the time of \"dynasty zero\"—showed this symbol of the Sacred Bull upon a Celestial Boat with a priest holding ritual objects in front of it (Fig. 155b). (The depictions on this archaic pla que and on another similar one also reported by Sir Flinders Petrie, also clearly show the Sphinx, indicating beyond doubt that the Sphinx had already existed many centuries before its supposed construction by the Pharaoh Khephren of the Fo urth Dynasty.) As later in Crete for the Minotaur, a special labyrinth was built for the Apis Bull in Memphis. At Saqqara, effigies of bull-heads made of clay with natural horns were placed in recesses within the tomb of a Second Dynasty pharaoh; and it is known that Zoser, a Third D ynasty pharaoh, held special ceremonies in honor of the Bull of Heaven at his spacious pyramid compound in Saqqara.

Later on, when the New Kingdom reunited Egypt with Thebes as its capital and Amon-Ra was elevated to supremacy, the Bull of Heaven was depicted pierced and deflated (Fig. 156b).

Was it just a work of love, or was there a more compelling reason for that burst of astr onomically related activity? Dealing with the symbolism th at guided Sumerian temple building, Beatrice Goff (Symbols of Prehistoric Mesopo- tamia) wrote thus of the cons truction of the Eninnu: \"The time is the moment when in heaven and on earth the fates were decided.\" That the temple be built the way its divine planners had ordained and at the specific time it was to be built and inaugurated, she dete rmined, was all \"part of a plan foreordained when the fates were decided; Gudea's commission was part of a co smic plan.\" This, she con- cluded, was '\"the kind of setting where not only art and ritual but also mythology go hand in hand as essentials in the religion.\" Circa 2200 B.C. was indeed a time \"when in Heaven and on Earth the fates were decide d,\" for it was the time when a New Age, the Age of the Ram, was due to replace the Old Age, the Age of the Bull. Though Marduk/Ra was somewher e in exile, there grew a contest for the hearts and mi nds of people since the \"gods\" had come to depend increasingly on human kings and human armies to achieve their ends. Many sources indicate that Marduk's son Nabu was crisscrossing the lands that later became known as Lands of the Bible, seeking adherents to his father's side. His name. Nabu, had the same meaning and came from the same verb by which the Bible called a true prophet: Nabi, one who r eceives the divine words and signs and in turn expresses th em to the peopl e. The divine signs of which Nabu spoke were the changing Heavens; the fact that the New Year and other worship dates no longer seemed to occur when they should have. Nabu's weapon, in behalf of Marduk, was the calendar . . . What, one may ask, was there to view or determine that was unclear or in dispute?

Th ere could be the arbitrary, mathematically precise calculation that since the Grand Precessional Cycle of 25,920 years is divided into twelve Houses, each House or Age la sts exactly 2,160 years. That was the mathematical basis of the sexagesimal system, the 10:6 ratio between Divine Time and Celestial Time. But if no person alive, no astronome r-priest, had witnessed the beginning of an Age and its ending, for no one human stayed alive 2,160 years, it was either the word of the gods, or the observation of the skies. But the zodiacal constellations are of varied sizes, and the Sun can linger longer or shorter periods within them. The problem is especially acute in the case of Aries, that occupies less than 30° of the celestial arc, while its neighbors Taur us and Pisces extend beyond their official 30° Houses. So, if the gods disagreed, some of them (e.g. Marduk, so well trained in sciences by his father Enki, and Nabu) could say: 2,160 years have passed, the Time has come. But others (e.g. Ninurta, Thoth) could and did say: But look to the Heavens, do you really see the change occurring? The historical record, as deta iled by the ancient texts and affirmed by archaeology, indicate s that the tactics worked-— at least for a while. Marduk remained in exile and in Mes- opotamia the situation calmed down sufficiently for the mountainland troops to be sent back. After serving as a military headquarters for \"ninet y-one years and forty days\" (according to the ancient records), Lagash could become a civilian center for the glorifi cation of Ninurta.

Then, satisfied that the situa tion was under control, Ninurta departed for some distant mi ssion. In his stead Enlil ap- pointed his son Nannar/Sin to oversee Sumer and Akkad, and Ur, Nannar/Sin's \"cult center,\" became the capital of a revitalized empire.

The year, by our calculations, was 2113 B.C. The arrival of Terah and his family in Ur coincided with the establishment of the reign of five successive rulers known as the Ur III dynasty. Their, and Abram's, ensuing century saw on the one hand th e glorious culmination of the Sumerian civilization; its epitome and hallmark was the grand ziggurat built there for Nannar/Sin—a monumental edifice that, though lying in ru ins for almost four thousand years, still dominates the landscape and awes the viewer by its immensity, stability, and intricacy. Under the active guidance of Nannar and his spouse Nin- gal, Sumer attained new heights in art and sciences, liter- ature and urban organization, agriculture and industry and commerce. Sumer became the granary of the Lands of the Bible, its wool and garment industries were in a class by themselves, its merchants were the famed Merchants of Ur. But that was only one aspect of the Era of Nannar. On the other hand, hanging over all th is greatness and glory was the destiny ordained by Time—t he relentless change, from one New Year to another, of the Sun's position less and less in the House of GUD.ANNA, the \"Bull of Heaven,\" and ever closer to that of KU.MAL, the celestial Ram— with all the dire consequences. Ever since it was given Pr iesthood and Kingship, Man- kind had known its place and role. The \"gods\" were the Lords, to be worshiped and venerated. There was a defined hierarchy, prescribed rituals, and holy days. The gods were strict but benevolent, their de crees were sharp but righteous. For millennia the gods oversaw the welfare and fate of Mankind, all the while remaining clearly apart from the people, approachable only by the high priest on specified dates, communicating with th e king in visions and by omens. But now all that was beginning to crumble, for the"},{"pageNumber":321,"pageContent":"The Age of the Ram 327 gods themselves were at odds, citing different celestial omens and a changing calendar, increasingly pitting nation against nation in the cause of \"divine\" wars, quarrels, and bloodshed. And Mankind, confused and bewildered, in- creasingly speaking of \"my god\" and \"your god,\" now even began to doubt the divine credibility. In such circumstances Enlil and Nannar chose carefully the first ruler of the new dynast y. They selected Ur-Nammu (\"The Joy of Ur\"), a demigod whose mother was the god- dess Ninsun. It was undoubtedly a very calculated move meant to evoke among the people memories of past glories and the \"good old days,\" for Ninsun was the mother of the famed Gilgamesh who was st ill exalted in epic tales and artistic depictions. He was a king of Erech who was priv- ileged to have seen both th e Landing Place in the Cedar Mountains of Lebanon and the spaceport in the Sinai; and the choice of another son of Ninsun, some seven centuries later, was meant to evoke conf idences that those vital places would again be part of Sume r's heritage, its Promised Lands. Ur-Nammu's assignment was to steer the people \"away from the evil ways\" of follo wing the wrong gods. The effort was marked by the repair and rebuilding of all the major temples in the land—with the conspicuous exception of Marduk's temple in Babylon. Th e next step was to subdue the \"evil cities\" where Nabu was making converts to Mar- duk. To that end Enlil provided Ur-Nammu with a \"Divine Weapon\" with which to \"in th e hostile lands heap up the rebels in piles.\" That the enforcement of the Enlilite Ce- lestial Time was a major purpose is made clear in the text that quotes Enlil's instructions to Ur-Nammu about the weapon's use: As the Bull to crush the foreign lands; As the Lion to hunt [the sinners] down; to destroy the evil cities, clear them of opposition to the Lofty Ones."},{"pageNumber":322,"pageContent":"328 WHEN TIME BEGAN The Bull of the equinox and the Lion of the solstice were to be upheld; any opponent of the Lofty Ones had to be hunted down, crushed, destroyed. Leading the called-for military expedition, Ur-Nammu met not victory but an ignominious end. In the course of the battle his chariot got stuck in the mud and he fell off it, only to be crushed to deat h by its own wheels. The tragedy was compounded when the boat returning his body to Sumer sank on the way, so that the gr eat king was not even brought to burial. When the news reached Ur, the people were grieved and disbelieving. How did it happen that \"the Lord Nannar did not hold Ur-Nammu by the ha nd,\" why did Inanna \"not put her noble arm around his head ,\" why did Utu not assist him? Why did Anu \"alter his ho ly word\"? Surely it was a betrayal by the great gods; it could only happen because \"Enlil deceitfully changed his fate-decree.\" The tragic death of Ur-Na mmu and the doubting of the Enlilite gods at Ur caused Terah and his family to move to Harran, a city in northwestern Mesopotamia that served as a link with the lands and people of Anatolia—the Hittites; evidently, the powers that be fe lt that Harran, where a tem- ple to Nannar/Sin almost duplicat ed that of Ur, would be a more appropriate place for the Nippurian scion of a priestly royal line in the turbulent times ahead. In Ur, Shulgi, a son of U r-Nammu by a priestess in a marriage arranged by Nannar, ascended the throne. He at once sought the favor of Ninurta, building for him a shrine in Nippur. The move had practical aspects; for as the western provinces became ever more restive in spite of a peace- journey undertaken by Shulgi, he arranged to obtain a \"for- eign legion\" of troops from El am, a Ninurta domain in the mountains southeast of Sumer. Using them to launch mil- itary expeditions against the \"sinning cities,\" he himself sought solace in lavish livi ng and lovemaking, becoming a \"beloved\" of Inanna and conducting banquets and orgies in Erech, in Anu's very temple.

In the forty-seventh year of his reign, 2049 B.C., Shulgi re sorted to a desperate strat- agem: he ordered the buildi ng of a defensive wall along Sumer's western border. To th e Enlilite gods it was tanta- mount to an abandonment of crucial lands where the Landing Place and Mission Control Center were. So, because \"the divine regulations he did not carry out,\" Enlil decreed Shul- gi's death, the \"death of a sinner,\" the very next year. The retreat from the western lands and the death of Shulgi triggered two moves. As we l earn from a biographical text in which Marduk explained hi s moves and motives, it was then that he decided to return to the proximity of Meso- potamia by arriving in the land of the Hittites. Thereupon, it was also decided that Abram should make a move. In the forty-eight years of Shulgi's reign, Abram matured in Har- ran from a young bridegroom to a seventy-five-year-old leader, possessing varied knowledge and militarily trained and assisted by his Hittite hosts. And Yahweh said unto Abram: \"Get thee out of thy country and out of thy birthplace and from thy father's house, unto the land which I will show thee.\" And Abram departed as Yahweh had spoken unto him. The destination, as chapter 12 of Genesis makes clear, was the vital Land of Canaan; he was to proceed as quickly as possible and station himself and his elite cavalry in the Negev, on the Canaan-Sinai border. His mission, as we have fully detailed in The Wars of Gods and Men, was to protect the gateway to the spaceport. He arrived there skirt- ing the \"sinful cities\" of the Canaanites; soon thereafter he went to Egypt, obtaining more troops and camels, for a cavalry, from the last pharaoh of the Memphite dynasties. Back in the Negev, he was ready to fulfill his mission of guarding the spaceport's approaches. The anticipated conflict came to a head in the seventh"},{"pageNumber":324,"pageContent":"330 WHEN TIME BEGAN year of the reign of Shulgi's successor, Amar-Sin (\"Seen by Sin\"). It was, even in mode rn terms, a truly international war in which an alliance of four kings of the East set out from Mesopotamia to attack an alliance of five kings of Canaan. Leading the attack, acco rding to the biblical record in chapter 14 of Genesis, was \"Amraphel, the king of Shin'ar\" and, for a long time, it was believed that he was the Babylonian king Hammurabi. In fact, as our own studies have shown, he was the Sumerian Amar-Sin and the tale of the international conflict has been recorded also in Mes- opotamian texts, such as the ta blets of the Spartoli Collection in the British Museum whose confirmation of the biblical tale was first pointed out by Theophilus Pinches in 1897. Together with complementary fragments, the collection of Mesopotamian tablets dealing wi th those events has come to be known as the Khedorla omer Texts. Marching under the banner of Sin and according to oracles given by Inanna/Islitar, the alli ed army—probably the great- est military force of men ever seen until then—smote one western land after another. Re gaining for Sin all the lands between the Euphrates and the Jordan River, they circled the Dead Sea and set as their next target the spaceport in the Sinai peninsula. But there Abram, carrying out his mis- sion, stood in their way; so th ey turned back north, ready to attack the \"evil cities\" of the Canaanites. Instead of waiting in their walled cities to be attacked, the Canaanite alliance marched fo rth and joined battle with the invaders in the Valley of Siddim. The records, both biblical and Mesopotamian. suggest an indecisive result. The \"evil cities\" were not obliterated, though the flight (and resulting death) of tw o kings, those of Sodom and Gomorrah, resulted in booty a nd prisoners being carried away from there. Among the prisoners from Sodom was Abram's nephew Lot; and when Abram heard that, his cav- alry pursued the invaders, ca tching up with them near Da- mascus (now the capital of Sy ria). Lot, other prisoners, and the booty were retaken and brought back to Canaan. As the Canaanite kings came out to greet them and Abram, they offered that he keep the booty as a reward."},{"pageNumber":325,"pageContent":"The Age of the Ram 331 But he refused to take \"eve n a shoelace.\" He had acted neither out of enmity for the Mesopotamian alliance nor out of support for the Canaanite kings, he explained. It was only for \"Yahweh, the God Most High, Possessor of Heaven and Earth, that I have raised my hand,\" he stated. The unsuccessful military campaign depressed and con- fused Amar-Sin. According to the Date Formula for the ensuing year, 2040 B.C., he left Ur and the worship of Nannar/Sin and became a priest in Eridu, Enki's \"cult cen- ter.\" Within another year he was dead, presumably of a scorpion's bite. The year 2040 B.C. was even more mem- orable in Egypt; there, Mentuhotep II, leader of the Theban princes, defeated the norther n pharaohs and extended the rule and rules of Ra-Amen th roughout Egypt, up to the Sinai boundary. The victory ushered in what scholars call the Middle Kingdom of the XI and XII dynasties that lasted to about 1790 B.C. While the full force and significance of the Age of the Ram came into pl ay in Egypt during the later New Kingdom, the Theban victory of 2040 B.C. marked the end of the Age of the Bull in the African domains. If, from a historical persp ective, the coming of the Age of the Ram appears to have been inevitable, so must it also have appeared to the principa l protagonists and antagonists of that very trying time. In Canaan, Abram retreated to a mountain stronghold near Hebron. In Sumer, the new king, Shu-Sin, a brother of Amar-Sin, strengthened the defensive walls in the west, sought an alliance with the Nippurites who had settled with Terah in Harran, and built two large ships—possibly as a precaution, with escape in mind ... In a night equivalent to one in February 2031 B.C. a major lunar eclipse occurred in Sumer; it was taken to be an om- inous omen of the nearing \"eclipse\" of the Moon god himself. The first victim, however, was Shu-Sin; for by the following year he was no longer king. As the word of the celestial omen, the eclipse of the Moon, spread throughout the anci ent Near East, the required messages of loyalty from viceroys and governors of the provinces, first in the west a nd then in the east, ceased."},{"pageNumber":326,"pageContent":"332 WHEN TIME BEGAN Within a year of the reign of the next (and last) king of Ur, Ibbi-Sin, raiders from the west, organized by Nabu and encouraged by Marduk, were clashing with Elamite mer- cenaries at Mesopotamia's gates. In 2026 B.C. the compiling of customs receipts (on clay tablets) at Drehem, a major trade gateway in Sumer duri ng the Ur III period, ceased abruptly, indicating that fore ign commerce had come to a standstill. Sumer itself becam e a country under siege, its territory shrinking, its peop le huddled behind protective walls. In what was once the ancient world's food basket, supplies ran short and prices of essentials-—barley, oil, wool—multiplied every month. Unlike any othertirne in Sumer's and Mesopotamia's long history, omens were cited in unusual frequency. Judging by the record of human behavior one may see in that a known reaction to fear of the unknown and to a search for reas- surance or guidance from some higher power or intelligence. But at that time there was a real cause for watching the heavens for omens, for the cele stial arrival of the Ram was becoming increasingly evident. As the texts that have survived from that period attest, the course of events about to happen on Earth was closely linked to celestial phenomena; and each side to the growing confrontation constantly observed the skies for heavenly signs. Since the various Great Anunnaki were associated with celestial counterparts, both zodiacal constellations and the twelve members of the Solar System (as well as with months), the movements and positi ons of the celestial bodies associated with the chief prot agonists were especially sig- nificant. The Moon, counterpart of Ur's great god Nannar/ Sin, the Sun (counterpart of Nannar's son Utu/Shamash), Venus (the planet of Sin's da ughter Inanna/Ishtar), and the planets Saturn and Mars (associated with Ninurta and Ner- gal) were especially watched and observed in Ur and Nippur. In addition to all those associ ations, the various lands of the Sumerian empire were also deemed to belong, celes- tially, to specific zodiacal c onstellations: Sumer, Akkad, and Elam were under the sign a nd protection of Taurus; the Lands of the Westerners, under the sign of Aries.

One such text, put together through the labor of many scholars from assorted tablets (mostly in the British Museum), is an amazing autobiographical record by Marduk of his exile, agonizi ng wait for the right celestial omens, and final move to take over the Lordship that he believed was his. Written as a \"memoir\" by an aging Mar- duk, he reveals in it his \"secrets\" to posterity: O great gods, learn my secrets as I girdle my belt, my memories recall. 1 am the divine Marduk, a great god. I was cast off for my sins, to the mountains I have gone. In many lands I have been a wanderer; From where the Sun rises to where it sets I went.

In its midst [I asked]: \"Until when?\" 24 years in its midst I nested. Various astronomical texts from the years that marked the transition from Taurus to Aries offer a clue regarding the omens that Marduk was especi ally interested in. In those texts, as well as in what is called by scholars \"mythological texts,\" the association of Ma rduk with Jupiter is strongly suggested.

Bu t prior to that Jupiter, by all indications, was the celestial body of Marduk in his epithet \"Son of the Sun\"; and a suggestion—made more than a century and a half ago—-th at Jupiter might have served in Babylon as a device parallel to that which Sirius had served in Egypt, as the synchron izer of the calendrical cycle, is quite pertinent here. We refer to a series of lectures delivered at the Royal Institute of Great Britain to the Society of Antiquarians in 1822 (!) by an \"antiquarian\" named John Landseer in which, in spite of the meager ar chaeological data then avail- able, he showed an astounding grasp of ancient times. Long before others, and as a re sult the holder of unaccepted views, he asserted that the \"Chaldeans\" had known of the phenomenon of precession millennia before the Greeks. Calling those early times an era \"when Astronomy was Religion\" and vice versa, he asserted that the calendar was related to the zodiacal \"mansion\" of the Bull, and that the transition to Aries was associat ed with \"a mystifying con- junction of the Sun and Jupiter in the sign of Aries, at the commencement of the great cycle of intricate [celestial] revolutions.\" He believed that the Greek myths and legends connecting Zeus/Jupiter with the Ram and its golden fleece reflected that transition to Aries. And he calculated that such a determining conjunction of Jupiter and the Sun in the boundary between Taurus and Aries had occurred in the year 2142 B.C. The notion that Jupiter in a conjunction with the Sun might have served as the Announcer, the herald of the Age of Aries, was also surmised from Babylonian astronomical tablets in a series of papers titled \"Euphratean Stellar Re- searches\" by Robert Brown in the Proceedings of the So- ciety of Biblical Arch aeology, London, in 1893. Focusing in particular on two astronomical tablets (British Museum catalogue numbers K.2310 and K.2894), Brown concluded that they dealt with the positi on of stars, constellations, and"},{"pageNumber":330,"pageContent":"336 WHEN TIME BEGAN planets as seen in Babylon at midnight on a date equivalent to July 10, 2000 B.C. Apparently quoting Nabu in reference to his \"proclamation of the plan et of the Prince of Earth''— presumably Jupiter—appearing in an \"ocular instance which took place in the sign of Aries,\" the texts were translated by Brown into a \"star map\" that showed Jupiter in near conjunction with the brightest star (Lulim, known by its Arabic name Hamal) of Aries and just off the point of the spring equinox, when the zodiacal path and the plane- tary path (celestial equator and ecliptic) cross (Fig. 158). Dealing with the transitions from one Age to another as recorded in the Mesopotamian tablets, various Assyriolo- gists (as they were called at the time)—e.g. Franz Xavier Kugler (Im Bannkreis Babels)—ha ve pointed out that while the transition from Gemini to Taurus was ascertainable with relative precision, that from Taurus to Aries was less de- terminable timewise. Kugler believed that the vernal equi- nox signaling the New Year was still in Taurus in 2300 B.C., and noted that the Babylonians had assumed the Zeit- alter, the new zodiacal Age. to have come into effect in 2151 B.C.

That, however, would have meant that the claim that the shift to Aries had come about preceded by about a century and a half the observational shift of the vernal equinox into Aries in 2000 B.C. as attested by the two tablets. That discrepancy could explain, at least in part, the disa- greement at that time regarding what the celestial omens or observations were truly portending. As the autobiographical Marduk text admits, even the omen that signified to him th e time to end his wanderings and come to Hatti Land, the La nd of the Hittites in Asia Minor, occurred twenty-four y ears before his next move. But that and other celestial om ens were also watched closely on the Enlilite side; and although the Ram had not yet fully dominated the New Year's day on the spring equinox in the time of Ibbi-Sin, the last king of Ur, the oracle priests interpreted the omens as portent s of the disastrous end. In the fourth year of Ibbi-Sin 's reign (2026 B.C.) the oracle priests told him that according to the omens, \"For the sec- ond time, he who calls himself Supreme, like one whose chest has been anointed, shall come from the west.\" With such predictions Sumerian cities, in the fifth year of Ibbi- Sin's reign, ceased the delivery of the traditional sacrificial animals for Nannar's temple in Ur. That same year the omen-priests prophesied that \"when the sixth year comes, the inhabitants of Ur will be trapped.\" In the following, sixth year, the omens of destruction and ruin became more urgent and Mesopotamia itself, the heartland of Sumer and Akkad, was invaded. The inscriptions record that in the sixth year the \"hostile Wester ners had entered the plain, had entered the interior of the country, taking one by one all the great fortresses.\" In the twenty-fourth year of his sojourn in the Land of the Hittites, Marduk received another omen: \"My days [of exile] were completed, my years [of exile] were fulfilled,\""},{"pageNumber":333,"pageContent":"The Age of the Ram 339 he wrote in his memoirs. \"With longing to my city Babylon I set course, to my temple Esagila as a mount |to rebuild], my everlasting abode to rees tablish.\" The partly damaged tablet then describes Marduk's route from Anatolia back to Babylon; the cities named indicate that he first went south to Hama (the biblical Hamat), then crossed the Euphrates at Mari; he indeed returned, as the omens had predicted, from the west. The year was 2024 B.C. In his autobiographical memo irs Marduk described how he had expected his return to Babylon to be a triumphant one, opening an era of well-be ing and prosperity for its people. He envisaged the establishment of a new royal dy- nasty, and foresaw as the first task of the new king the rebuilding of the Esagil, the temple-ziggurat of Babylon, according to a new \"ground plan of Heaven and Earth\"— one in accord with the New Age of the Ram: I raised my heels toward Babylon, through the lands I went to my city; A king in Babylon to make the foremost, in its midst my temple-mountain to heaven raise.

In my city Babylon in abundance he will reside; My hand he will grasp, to my city and my temple Esagil for eternity I shall enter.

The king will then approach; the rightful star of the Esagil over the land [he will observe]. When the Esagil was eventually built, it was erected according to very detailed and precise plans; its orientation, height, and various stages were indeed such that its head pointed directly (see Fig. 33) to the star Iku, the lead star of the constellation Aries. But Marduk's ambitious vision was not to be fulfilled right then and there. In the very same year that he began his march back to Babylon at th e head of a horde of West- ern supporters organized by Na bu, a most awesome catas- trophe befell the ancient Near East—a calamity the likes of which neither Mankind nor Earth itself had previously experienced. He expected that once the omens were clear, both gods and men would heed his call for accepting his supremacy without further resistance. \"I called on the gods, all of them, to heed me,\" Marduk wrote in his memoirs. \"I called on the people along my march, 'b ring your tribute to Baby- lon.' \" Instead, he encountered a scorched-earth policy: the gods in charge of cattle and gr ains left, \"to heaven they went up,\" and the god in char ge of beer \"made sick the heart of the land.\" The advance turned violent and bloody. \"Brother consumed brother, friends slew each other with the sword, corpses of people blocked the gates.\" The land"},{"pageNumber":335,"pageContent":"The Age or the Ram 341 was laid waste, wild animal s devoured people, packs of dogs bit people to death. As Marduk's followers continued their advance, the tem- ples and shrines of other gods began to be desecrated.

When Enlil heard that even the Holy of Holies was not spared , that \"in the holy of holies the veil was torn away,\" he rushed back to Mesopotamia. He \"set off a brilliance like lightning'1 as he came down from the skies; \"riding in fr ont of him were gods clothed with radiance.\" Seeing what had happened, \"Enlil evil against Babylon caused to be planned.\" He ordered that Nabu be seized and brought before the Council of the Gods, and Ninurta and Nergal were gi ven the assignment. But they found that Nabu had escaped from his temple in Borsippa, on the Euphratean border, to hide among his followers in Canaan and the Mediterranean islands. Meeting in Council, the lead ing Anunnaki debated what to do, discussing the alternatives \"a day and a night, without ceasing.\" Only Enki spoke up in defense of his son: \"Now that prince Marduk has risen, now that the people for the second time have raised his image,\" why does opposition continue? He reprimanded Nerg al for opposing his brother; but Nergal, \"standing before him day and night without cease,\" argued that the celestial omens were being misread. \"Let Shamash\"—the Sun god—\" see the signs and inform the people,\" he said; \"Let Nannar\"—the Moon god—\"at his sign look and impart that to the land.\" Referring to a constellation-star whose identity is being debated, Nergal said that \"among the stars of heaven the Fox Star was twinkling its rays to him.\" He was seeing other omens— \"dazzling stars of heaven th at carry a sword\"—comets streaking in the skies. He wa nted to know what these new omens meant.

It was Inanna who had pointed out that time was running out. \"Until the time is fulfilled, the hour will be past!\" she told the arguing gods; \"pay atte ntion, all of you,\" she said, advising them to continue their deliberations in private, lest the plan of attack be divul ged to Marduk (presumably by Enki). \"Cover your lips,\" she told Enlil and the others, \"go into your privat e quarters!\" In the privacy of the Emes- lam temple, Ninurta spoke up. \"The time has elapsed, the hour has passed,\" he said.

It describes in great detail the discussions, the arguments for and against, the fears for the future if Marduk and his followers should control the spaceport and its aux- iliary facilities.

Typical of the calamities that befell the once proud and prospe rous land are those listed in the Lamentation Over the Destruction of Ur, a long poem of some 440 verses of which we shall quote but a few: The city into ruins was made, the people groan . . . Its people, not potsherds, filled its ravines . . . In its lofty gates, where they were wont to promenade, dead bodies lay about. . . Where the festivities of the land took place, the people lay in heaps . . . The young were lying in their mothers' laps like fish carried out of the waters . . . The counsel of the land was dissipated. In the storehouses that abounded in the land, fires were kindled. . . The ox in its stable has not been attended, gone is its herdsman . . .

For a long time scholars have held the view that the various lamentation texts dealt with the successive but sep- arate destruction of Sumer's cities by invaders from the west, the east, the north. But in The Wars of Gods and Men we have suggested that it was not so; that what these lam- entations deal with was one single countrywide calamity, an unusual catastrophe and a su dden disaster against which no protection, no defense, no hiding was possible. This view, of a single sudden a nd overwhelming calamity, is now increasingly accepted by sc holars; yet to be accepted is the evidence that we have presented that the calamity was linked to the \"upheavaling\" of the \"evil cities\" and the spaceport in the west. It was the unexpected development of an atmospheric vacuum, creating an immense whirlwind and a storm that carried th e radioactive cloud eastward— toward Sumer. The various available texts, and not just the lamentation texts, clearly speak of the cala mity as an unstoppable storm, an Evil Wind, and clearly identi fy it as the result of an unforgettable day when a nuclear blast had created it near the Mediterranean coast: On that day, When heaven was crushed and the Earth was smitten, its face obliterated by the maelstrom—"},{"pageNumber":339,"pageContent":"The Age of the Ram 345 When the skies were darkened and covered as with a shadow— On that day there was created A great storm from heaven . . .

The story, however, was not the same everywhere. In Ur, Nannar and Ningal refused to abandon their followers and appealed to the great Enlil to do whatever possible to avert the disaster, but Enlil re- sponded that the fate of Ur could not be changed. The divine couple spent a nightmarish night in Ur: \"Of that night's foulness they did not flee,\" hiding underground \"as ter- mites.\" But in the morning Ningal realized that Nannar/Sin had been afflicted, and \"hastily putting on a garment\" de- parted the beloved Ur with th e stricken mate. In Lagash, where with Ninurta away Bau had stayed in the Girsu by herself, the goddess could not fo rce herself to leave. Lin- gering behind \"she wept bitterly for her holy temple, for her city.\" The delay almost co st her her life: \"On that day, the storm caught up with he r, with the Lady.\" (Indeed, some scholars deem the ensuing verse in the lamentation to indicate that Bau had in fact lost her life: \"Bau. as if she were a mortal, the storm had caught up with her.\") Fanning out in a wide swath ov er what used to be Sumer and Akkad, the Evil Wind's path touched Eridu, Enki's city, in the south. Enki, we learn, took cover some distance away from the wind's path, yet close enough to be able to return to the city after the cloud had passed. He found a city \"smothered with silence, its residents stacked up in heaps.\" But here and there ther e were survivors, and Enki led them southward, to the desert. It was an \"inimical land,\" uninhabitable; but usi ng his scientific prowess, Enki—like Yahweh half a millennium later in the Sinai desert—managed miraculously to provide water and food for \"those who have been displaced from Eridu.\" As fate would have it, Babylo n, situated on the northern edge of the Evil Wind's wide swath, was the least affected of all the Mesopotamian cities. Alerted and advised by his father, Marduk urged the city's people to leave and hurry northward; and, in words reminiscent of the angels' advice to Lot and his family as they were told to leave Sodom before its upheavaling, Marduk told the escapees \"neither to turn nor to look back. \" If escape was not possible, they were told to \"get thee into a chamber below the earth, into"},{"pageNumber":341,"pageContent":"The Age of the Ram 347 a darkness.\" Once the Evil St orm had passed, they were not to consume any of the food or beverage in the city, for they might have been \"touched by the ghost.\" When the air finally cleared, all of southern Mesopotamia lay prostrate. \"The storm crushed the land, wiped out every- thing ...

In the orchards and the gardens there is no new growth, quickly they waste away ... On the steppes cattle large and small become scarce . . . The sheep- folds have been delivered to the Wind.\" Life began to stir anew only seven years later. Backed by Elamite and Gutian troops loyal to Ninurta, a semblance of organized society returned to Sumer under rulers seated in former provincial centers, Isin and Larsa. It was only after the passage of seventy years—the same interval that later applied to the restoration of the temple in Jerusalem— that the temple in Nippur wa s restored. But the \"gods who determine the destinies,\" Anu and Enlil, saw no purpose in resurrecting the past. As Enlil had told Nannar/Sin who had appealed in behalf of Ur— Ur was granted kingship— it was not granted an eternal reign. Marduk had won out. Within a few decades, his vision of a king in Babylon who would grasp his hand, rebuild the city, raise high its ziggurat Es agil—had come true. After a halting start, the First Dynast y of Babylon attained the in- tended power and assurance that were expressed by Hammurabi: Lofty Anu, lord of the gods who from Heaven to Earth came, and Enlil, lord of Heaven and Earth who determines the destinies of the land.

In Egypt, unaffected by the nuclear cloud, the transition to the Age of the Ram began right after the Theban victory and the enthronement of the Middle Kingdom dynasties. When the celebrations of the New Year, coinciding with the rising of the Nile, were adjusted to the New Age, hymns to Ra-Amen praised him thus: 0 Brilliant One who shines in the inundation waters. He who raised his head and lifts his forehead: He of the Ram, the greatest of celestial creatures. Under the New Kingdom, temple avenues were lined with statues of the Ram; and in th e great temple to Amon-Ra in Karnak, in a secret observation perch that had to be opened on the day of the winter solstice to let in the Sun's rays through the path to the Holy of Holies, the following in- structions were inscribed for the astronomer-priest: One goes toward the hall called Horizon of the Sky. One climbs the Aha, \"Lonesome place of the majestic soul,'' the high room for watching the Ram who sails across the skies. In Mesopotamia, slowly but surely, the ascendancy of the Age of the Ram was recognized by changes in the calendar and in the lists of th e celestial stars. Such lists, that used to begin with Taurus, now began with Aries; and for Nissan, the month of th e spring equinox and the New Year, the zodiac of Aries rather than Taurus was thereafter written in.

It was to dominate the next two millennia and the as- tronomy that the \"Chaldeans\" had transmitted to the Greeks. When, in the closing years of the fourth century B.C., Alexander came to believe that he was entitled—like Gilgamesh 2,500 years earlier—t o immortality because his true father was the Egyptian god Amon, he went to the god's oracle place in Egypt's western desert to seek con- firmation.

A major vehicle to that end was the all-important annual New Year celebration, when the Epic of Creation was read publicly. It was a tradition whose purpose was to acquaint the populace not only with the basic cosmogony and the tale of Evolution and the arrival of the Anunnaki, but also as a way to state and reinstate the basic religious tenets regarding Gods and Men. The Epic of Creation was thus a useful and powerful vehicle for indoctrination and re indoctrination; and as one of his first acts Marduk instituted one of the greatest for- geries ever: the creation of a Babylonian version of the epic in which the name \"Marduk\" was substituted for the name \"Nibiru.\" It was thus Mar duk, as a celestial god, who had appeared from outer space, battl ed Tiamat, created the Ham- mered Out Bracelet (the Asteroid Belt) and Earth of Tiamat's halves, rearranged the Solar System, and became the Great God whose orbit encircles an d embraces \"as a loop\" the orbits of all the other celestial gods (planets), making them subordinate to Marduk's maje sty. All the ensuing celestial stations, orbits, cycles, and phe nomena were thus the mas- terworks of Marduk: it was he who determined Divine Time by his orbit, Celestial Time by defining the constellations, and Earthly Time by giving Ea rth its orbital position and tilt. It was he, too, who had de prived Kingu, Tiamat's chief satellite, of its emerging inde pendent orbit and made it a satellite of Earth, the Moon, to wax and wane and usher in the months. In so rearranging the heavens, Marduk did not forget to settle some personal accounts. In the past Nibiru, as the 350"},{"pageNumber":345,"pageContent":"Aftermath 351 home planet of the Anunnaki, was the abode of Anu and thus associated with him. Ha ving appropriated Nibiru to himself, Marduk relegated Anu to a lesser planet—the one we call Uranus. Marduk's father , Enki, was originally as- sociated with the Moon; now Marduk gave him the honor of being \"number one\" planet —the outermost, the one we call Neptune. To hide the forgery and make it appear as though it was always so, the Babyl onian version of the Epic of Creation (called Enuma elish after its opening words) employed Sumerian terminology for the planetary names, calling the planet NUDIMMUD, \"The Artful Creator\"— which was exactly what Enki 's Egyptian epithet, Khnum, had meant. A celestial counterpart was needed for Marduk's son Nabu. To achieve that, the plan et we call Mercury, which was associated with Enlil's young son Ishkur/Adad, was expropriated and allocated to Nabu. Sarpanit, Marduk's spouse to whom he owed his release from the Great Pyramid and the commutation of the sentence of being buried alive in it to that of exile (the first one of the two), was also not forgotten. Settling accounts with Inanna/Ishtar, he deprived her of the celestial association with the planet we call Venus and granted the planet to Sa rpanit. (As it happened, while the switch from Adad to Nabu wa s partly retained in Baby- lonian astronomy, that of re placing Ishtar by Sarpanit did not take hold.) Enlil was too omnipotent to be shoved aside, instead of changing Enlil's celestial position (as the god of the Seventh Planet, Earth) Marduk appropr iated to himself the Rank of Fifty that was Enlil's rank, just a rung below Anu's sixty (Enki's numerical rank was fo rty). That takeover was in- corporated into the Enuma elish by listing, in the seventh and last tablet of the epic, the Fifty Names of Marduk. Starting with his own name, \"Marduk,\" and ending with his new celestial name, \"Nibiru,\" the list accompanied each name-epithet with a laudatory explanation of its meaning.

Marduk's seizure of the supremacy in the heavens was accompanied by a parallel religious change on Earth. The other gods, the Anunnaki lead ers—-even his direct adver- saries—were neither punished no r eliminated. Rather, they were declared subordinate to Marduk through the gimmick of asserting that their variou s attributes and powers were transferred to Marduk. if Ni nurta was known as the god of husbandry, who had given Ma nkind agriculture by damming the mountain gushes and digging irrigation canals—the function now belonged to Marduk.

But that confuses the belief in one G od Almighty with a religion in which one god is just superior to the other gods, a polytheism in which one god dominates the others. In the words of Enuma elish, Marduk became \"the Enlil of the gods,\" their \"Lord.\" No longer residing in Egypt, Marduk/Ra became Amen, \"The Unseen One.\" Egyptian hymns to him, nevertheless, proclaimed his supremacy, al so connoting the new theology that he was now the \"god of gods,\" \"more powerful of might than the other gods.\" In one set of such hymns, composed in Thebes and di scovered written on what is known as the Leiden Papyrus, the chapters begin with a description of how after the ' 'i slands which are in the midst of the Mediterranean\" recogniz ed his name as \"high and mighty and powerful,\" the peoples of \"the hill countries came down to thee in wonder; every rebellious country was filled of thy terror.\" Listing other lands that switched their obedience to Amen-Ra, the sixth chapter continued by de- scribing the god's arrival in the Land of the Gods—as we understand it, Mesopotamia—a nd the ensuing construction there of Amon's new temple—as we understand it, the Es- agil.

But not only people pay Amen homage; so do all the other gods. Here are some of the verses from the following chapters of the papyrus exto lling Amen-Ra as the king of the gods: The company of the gods which came forth from heaven assembled at thy sight, announcing: \"Great of glory, Lord of Lo rds . . .

Ingeniously, the policy was not to eliminate the other Great Anunnaki but to control and supervise them. When, in time, the Esagila sacred precinct was built with appro- priate grandeur, Mard uk invited the other leading deities to come and reside in Babylon, in special shrines that were built for each one of them within the precinct. The sixth tablet of the epic in its Babyl onian version states that after Marduk's own temple-abode was completed, and shrines for the other Anunnaki were er ected, Marduk invited all of them to a banquet. \"This is Babylon, the place that is your home!\" he said. \"Make merry in its precincts, occupy its broad places.\" By acceding to his invitation, the others would literally have made Babylon what its name—Bab- ili—had meant: \"Gateway of the gods.\" According to this Babylonian version, the other gods took their seats in front of the lo fty dais on which Marduk had seated himself. Among them we re \"the seven gods of des- tiny.\" After the banqueting and the performance of all the rites, after verifying \"that the norms had been fixed ac- cording to all the portents,\" Enlil raised the bow, his weapon, and laid it before the gods.

Let us now proclaim his Fifty Names! Proclaiming his Fifty Name s—granting Marduk the Rank of Fifty that had been Enli l's and Ninurta's—Marduk be- came the God of Gods. Not a sole God, but the god to whom the other gods had to pay obeisance. If the new religion proclaimed in Babylon was a far cry from a monotheistic theology, scholars (e specially at the turn of this century) wondered and heatedly debated the extent to which the notion of a Trinity had originated in Babylon. It was recognized that Babylon's New Religion stressed the lineage Enki-Marduk-Nabu and that the divinity of the Son was obtained from a Holy Father. It was pointed out that Enki referred to him as \"our Son,\" that his very name, MAR.DUK, meant \"Son of the Pure Place\" (P. Jensen), \"Son of the Cosmic Mountain\" (B. Meissner), \"Son of the Brilliant Day\" (F .J. Delitzsch), \"Son of Light\" (A. Deimel) or simply \"The True Son\" (W. Paulus). The fact that all those leading Assyriologists were German was primarily due to the particular interest that the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft—an archae ological society that also served the political and intelligence-gathering ends of Ger- many—had conducted an unbroken chain of excavations at Babylon from 1899 until almost the end of World War 1 when Iraq fell to the British in 1917.

What is cert ain is that the New Age that Marduk and Babylon ushered in circa 2000 B.C. manifested itself in a new religion, a polytheism in which one god dominated all the others. Reviewing four millennia of Mesopotamian religion. Thorkild Jacobsen (The Treas ures of Darkness) identified as the main change at the beginning of the second millen- nium B.C. the emergence of national gods in lieu of the universal gods of the preceding two millennia. The previous plurality of the divine powers, Jacobsen wrote, \"required the ability to dist inguish, evaluate a nd choose\" not just between the gods but also be tween good and evil. By as- suming all the other gods' powers, Marduk abolished such choices. \"The national character of Marduk,\" Jacobsen wrote (in a study titled Toward the Image of Tammuz), created a situation in which \"religion and politics became more inextricably linked\" and in which the gods, \"through signs and omens, actively guided the policies of their countries.\" The emergence of guiding poli tics and religion by \"signs and omens\" was indeed a major innovation of the New Age. It was not a surprising development in view of the importance that celestial sign s and omens had played in determining the true beginning of the zodiacal change and in deciding who would become supreme on Earth. For many millennia it was the word of the Seven Who Determine the Destinies, Anu, Enlil, and the other Anunnaki leaders, who made the decisions affecting the Anunnaki; Enlil, by him- self, was the Lord of the Command as far as Mankind was concerned. Now, signs and omens in the heavens guided the decisions."},{"pageNumber":351,"pageContent":"Aftermath 357 In the \"prophecy texts\" (one of which we have earlier quoted) the principal gods played a role al ongside or within the framework of the celestial omens.

Babylonian texts, and those of neighboring nations in the second and first millennia B.C., are replete with such Omina and their interpretation. A whole science, if one so wishes to call it, developed as time we nt on, with speci al beru (best translated \"fortune teller\") priests on hand to interpret ob- servations of celestial phenomen a. At first the predictions, continuing the trend that bega n at the time of the Third Dynasty of Ur, concerned themse lves with affairs of state— the fate of the king and his dynasty and the fortunes of the land: When a halo surrounds the Moon and Jupiter stands within it, ther e will be an invasion of the army of Aharru.

The positions of the planets inside the zodiacal constellations were described by the term Ma nzallu (\"stations\"), from which the Hebrew plural Mazzaloth (II Kings 23:5) comes, and from which a Mazal (\"luck , fortune\") evolved, capable of being good luck or bad luck. Since not only constellations and planets but also months had been associated with various gods—some, by Baby- lonian times, adversaries of Marduk—the time of the ce- lestial phenomena grew in importance. One omen, as an example, said: \"If the Moon shall be eclipsed in the month Ayaru in the third watch\" and certain other planets will be at given positions, \"the king of Elam will fall by his own sword ... his son will not take the throne; the throne of Elam will be unoccupied.\" A Babylonian text on a very large tablet (VAT-10564) divided into twelve columns co ntained instructions for what may or may not be done in certain months: \"A king may build a temple or repair a holy place only in Shebat and Adar ... A person may return to his home in Nissan.\" The text, called by S. Langdon (Ba bylonian Menologies and the Semitic Calendars) \"the great Babylonian Church Calen- dar,\" then listed the lucky and unlucky months, even days and even half days, for many personal activities (such as the most favorable time for bringing a new bride into the house). As the omens, predictions, and instructions increasingly assumed a more personal nature , they verged on the horo- scopic. Would a certain person, not necessarily the king, recover from an illness? Will the pregnant mother bear a healthy child? If some times or certain omens were unlucky, how could one ward off the ill luck? In time, incantations were devised for the purpose; one text, for example, actually provided the sayings to be re cited to prevent the thinning of a man's beard by appealing to \"the star that giveth light\" with prescribed utterings.

While the majority dealt with celestial phenomena, not all of them did so. Some dealt with dream-omens, others with the interpretation of \"oil and water\" signs (the pattern made by oil as it was poured on water), even the si gnificance of animal entrails as they appeared after sacrifi ces. What used to be astronomy became astrology, and astrology was followed by divina- tions, fortune-telling, sorcery. R. Camblell Thompson was probably right in titling a ma jor collection of omen texts The Reports of the Magicians and Astrologers of Nineveh and Babylon. Why did the New Age bring all that about? Beatrice Goff (Symbols of Prehistoric Mesopotamia) identified the cause as the breakdown of the gods-pri ests-kings framework that had held society together in the prior millennia. \"There was no aristocracy, no priesthood, no intelligentsia\" to prevent the situation where \"all the affairs of living were inextric- ably bound up with such 'magical' practices.\" Astronomy became astrology because, with the Olden Gods gone from their \"cult centers,\" the people were looking at least for signs and omens to guide them in turbulent times. Indeed, even astronomy itself was no longer what it had been during two millennia of Sumerian achievements. De- spite the reputation and high esteem in which \"Chaldean\" astronomy was held by the Greeks in the second half of the first millennium b.c., it was a sterile astronomy and a far cry from that of Sumer, wher e so many of the principles, methods, and concepts on which modern astronomy is founded had originated. \"There is scarcely another chapter in the history of science wher e a deep gap exists between the generally accepted description of a period and the results"},{"pageNumber":354,"pageContent":"360 WHEN TIME BEGAN which have slowly emerged from a detailed investigation of the source material,\" O.

Fig. 161 is a pho- tograph of one such (fragmented) tablet; Fig. 162 is the contents of such a tablet converted to modern numerals. Not unlike the astronomical codices of the Mayas, that contained page after page afte r page of glyphs dealing with the planet Venus, but without a ny indication that they were based on actual Mayan observa tions but rather followed some data source, so were th e Babylonian lists of predicted positions of the Sun, Moon, and visible planets extremely detailed and accurate. In the Babylonian instance, however, the position lists (called \"Ephe merides\") were accompanied by procedure texts on companion tablets in which the rules for computing the ephemeride s were given step by step; they contained instructions how, for example, to compute—- for over fifty years in advance—Moon eclipses by taking into account data from columns dealing with the orbital velocities of the Sun and the Moon and other factors that were needed. But, to quote from Astronomical Cuneiform Texts by O. Neugebauer, \"unf ortunately these procedure texts do not contain much of what we would call the 'theory' behind the method.\" Yet \"such a theory,\" he poin ted out, \"must have existed because it is impossible to devise computational schemes of high complication without a ve ry elaborate plan.'' It was clear from the very neat script and carefully arranged col- umns and rows, Neugebauer stated, that these Babylonian tablets were copies meticulously made from preexisting sources already so neatly and accurately arranged.

No wonder that many of the scholars studying the period consider the time when the Old Age of the Sumerian Bull of Heaven gave way to the New Age of the Babylonian Ram a \"time of darkness.\" The Babylonians, as did the Assyrians and others that followed, retained—almost until the Greek era—the cunei- form script that the Sumerian s had devised (based, as we have shown in Genesis Revisite d, on sophisticated geometric and mathematical theories). But instead of any improve- ment, the Old Babylonian tablet s were written in a more scribbled and less refined scri pt. The many Sumerian ref- erences to schools, teachers, homework, were nonexistent in the ensuing centuries. Gone was the Sumerian tradition of literary creativity that bequeathed to future generations, including ours, \"wisdom\" text s, poetry, proverbs, alle- gorical tales, and not least of all the \"myt hs\" that had provided the data concerning th e solar system, the Heavens and Earth, the Anunnaki, the creation of Man. These, it ought to be pointed out, were l iterary genres that reappear only in the Hebrew Bible about a millennium later. A cen- tury and a half of digging up the remains of Babylon pro- duced texts and inscriptions by rulers boasting of military campaigns and conquests, of how many prisoners were taken or heads cut off—whereas Sumerian kings (as, for example, Gudea) boasted in th eir inscriptions of building temples, digging canals, having beautiful works of art made. A harshness and a coarseness replaced the former com- passion and elegance. The Babylonian king Hammurabi, the sixth in what is called the First Dynasty of Babylon, has been renowned because of his famous legal code, the \"Code of Hammurabi.\" It was, however, just a listing of crimes and their punishments—whereas a thousand years earlier Sumerian kings had pr omulgated codes of social justice, their laws protecti ng the widow, the orphan, the weak, and decreeing that \"you shall not take away the donkey of a widow,\" or \"you sh all not delay the wages of"},{"pageNumber":358,"pageContent":"364 WHEN TIME BEGAN a day laborer.\" Again, the Sumerian concept of laws, in- tended to direct human conduct rather than punish its faults, reappears only in the biblical Ten Commandments some six centuries after the fall of Sume r. Sumerian rulers cherished the title EN.SI—\"Righteous Sh epherd.\" The ruler selected by lnanna to reign in Agade (Akkad) whom we call Sargon I in fact bore the name-epith et Sharru-kin, \"Righteous King.\" The Babylonian kings (a nd the Assyrian ones later on) called themselves \"King of the four regions\" and boasted of being \"King of kings\" rather than a \"shepherd\" of the people. (It was greatly symbolic that Judea's greatest king, David, had been a shepherd.) Missing in the New Age were expressions of tender love. This may sound like an insignifi cant item in the long list of changes for the worse; but we believe that it was a mani- festation of a profound mind-set that went all the way down from the top—from Marduk himself. The poetry of Sumer included a substantial number of love and lovemaking poems. Some , it is true, were related to Inanna/Ishtar and her relati onship with her bridegroom Dumuzi. Others were recited or sung by kings to divine spouses. Yet others were devoted to the common bride and bridegroom, or husband and wife , or parental love and com- passion. (Once again, this genre reappears only after many centuries in the Hebrew Bible, in the Book of The Song of Songs.) It seems to us that this omission in Babylonia was not accidental, but part of an overall decline in the role of women and their status as co mpared to Sumerian times. The remarkable role of women in all walks of life in Sumer and Akkad and its very marked downgrading upon the rise of Babylon, have been lately reviewed and docu- mented in special studies and several international confer- ences, such as the \"Invited Lectures on the Middle East at the University of Texas at Austin\" published in 1976 (The Legacy of Sumer) by Denise Sc hmandt-Besserat as editor, and the proceedings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale in 1986, whos e theme was \"The woman in the ancient Near East.\" The gathered evidence shows that in Sumer and Akkad women engaged not only in household"},{"pageNumber":359,"pageContent":"Aftermath 365 chores like spinning, weaving, milking, or tending to the family and the home, but also were \"working profession- als\" as doctors, midwives, nurses, governesses, teachers, beauticians, and hairdressers. The textual evidence recently culled from discovered tablets augments the depictions of women in their varied tasks from the earliest recorded times that showed them as singers and musicians, dancers and banquet-masters. Women were also prominent in business and property management. Records have been found of women managing the family lands and overseeing their cultivation, and then supervising the trade in the resulting products. This was especially true of the \"ruling families\" of the royal court. Royal wives administered temp les and vast estates, royal daughters served not only as priestesses (of which there were three classes) but even as the High Priestess. We have already mentioned Enheduanna, the daughter of Sargon I, who composed a series of memorable hymns to Sumer's great ziggurat-temples. She served as High Priestess at Nan- nar's temple in Ur (Sir Leonard Woolley, who had excavated at Ur, found there a round pl aque depicting Enheduanna performing a libation ceremony). We know that the mother of Gudea, Gatumdu, was a Hi gh Priestess in the Girsu of Lagash. Throughout Sumerian history, other women held such high positions in the temples and priestly hierarchies. There is no record of a comp arable situation in Babylon. The story of women's role and position in the royal courts was no different. One mu st refer to Greek sources to find mention of a ruling queen (as distinct from a queen- consort) in Babylonian history—the tale of the legendary Semiramis who, according to Herodotus (I, 184) \"held the throne in Babylon\" in earlier times. Scholars have been able to establish that she was a historical person, Shammu-ramat. She did reign in Babylon, but only because her husband, the Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad, had cap- tured the city in 811 B.C. She served as the royal regent for five years after her husband's death, until their son Adad-Nirari III could assume the throne. 'This lady,'1 H.W.F.

There may have been other queens like her during the Sumerian era, but scholars are not certain of their status (i.e. whether they were only queen-consorts or regents for an underage son).

As time went on women's dress and garments, as well as their hairdos, became more elaborate and elegant (Fig. 163b, 163c), reflecting their st atus, education, and noble demeanor. Scholars researching these aspects of the civi- lizations of the ancient Near East have noted that whereas during the two millennia of Su merian primacy women were depicted by themselves in drawings and in plastic art— hundreds of statues and statuett es that are actual portraits of individual females have b een found—there is an almost total absence of such depicti ons in the post-Sumerian period in the Babylonian empire. W.G. Lambert titled the pape r he had presented at the Rencontre Assyriologique \"G oddesses in the Pantheon: A Reflection of Women in Society?\" We believe that the situation may well have been the reverse: women's status in society reflected the sta nding of the goddesses in the pantheon. In the Sumerian pantheon, female Anunnaki played leading roles along with the males from the very beginning. If EN.LIL was \"L ord of the Command,\" his spouse was NIN.LIL, \"Lady of the Command\"; if EN.KI was \"Lord of Earth,\" his spouse was NIN.KI, \"Lady of Earth.\" When Enki created the Primitive Worker through genetic engineering, Ninharsag was there to be the cocrea- tor. Suffice it to reread the inscriptions of Gudea to realize how many important roles godde sses played in the process that led to the building of the new ziggurat-temple. Suffice it also to point out that one of Mar duk's first acts was to transfer to the male Nabu the functions of Nisaba as deity of writing. In fact, all those goddesses that in the Sumerian pantheon held specific knowle dge or performed specific functions, were by and large re legated to obscurity in the Babylonian pantheon. When goddesses were mentioned, they were only listed as spous es of the male gods. The same held true for the people under the gods: women were men- tioned as wives or daughters, mostly when they were \"given\" in arranged marriages. We surmise that the situat ion reflected Marduk's own bias. Ninharsag, the \"Mother of gods and men,\" was, after"},{"pageNumber":362,"pageContent":"368 WHEN TIME BEGAN all, the mother of his main adversary in the contest for the supremacy on Earth, Ninurta. In anna/Ishtar wa s the one who had caused him to be buried alive inside the Great Pyramid. The many goddesses who were in charge of the arts and sciences assisted the construc tion of the Eninnu in Lagash as a symbol of defiance of Marduk's claims that his time had come. Was there any reason for him to retain the high position and veneration of all these females? Their down- grading in religion and worshi p was, we believe, reflected in a general downgrading of th e status of women in the post-Sumerian society. An interesting aspect of that was the apparent change in the rules of succession. The s ource of the conflict between Enki and Enlil was the fact that while Enki was Anu's firstborn, Enlil was the Legitimate Heir because he was born to Anu by a mother who was Anu's half sister. On Earth, Enki repeatedly tried to ha ve a son by Ninharsag, a half sister of his and Enlil's. but she bore him only female- offspring. Ninurta was the Legi timate Heir on Earth because it was Ninharsag who bore him to Enlil. Following these rules of succession, it was Is aac who was born to Abraham by his half sister Sarah and not the firstborn Ishmael (the son of the maid Hagar) who be came the patriarch's Legit- imate Heir. Gilgamesh, king of Erech, was two-thirds (not just one-half) \"divine\" because his mother was a goddess; and other Sumerian kings sought to enhance their status by claiming that a goddess nursed them with mother's milk. All such matriarchal lineages lost their significance when Marduk became supreme. (Maternal lineage became sig- nificant again among the Jews at the time of the Second Temple.) What was the ancient world experiencing at the beginning of the New Age of the 20th century B.C., in the aftermath of international wars, the use of nuclear weapons, the dis- solution of a great unifying political and cultural system, the displacement of a boundary less religion with one of national gods?

The phenomena of millions of war refugees on the one hand, and the rearrangement of the population-map on the other hand, so symptomatic of the events of the twentieth century a.d. had their counter parts in the twentieth cen- tury B.C. For the first time there appears in Mesopotamian inscrip- tions the term Munnahtutu, literally meaning \"fugitives from a destruction.\" In light of our twentieth century a.d. experience a better translation would be \"displaced per- sons\"—people who, in the words of several scholars, had been \"de-tribalized,\" people who had lost not only their homes, possessions, and liveliho ods but also the countries to which they had belonged and were henceforth \"stateless refugees,\" seeking religious asylum and personal safe ha- vens in other peoples' lands. As Sumer itself lay prostrate and desolate, the remnants of its people (in the words of Hans Baumann, The Land of Ur) \"spread in all directions; Sumerian doctors and astron- omers, architects and sculptors, cutters of seals and scribes, became teachers in other lands.\" To all the many Sumerian \"fir sts,\" they have thus added one more as Sumer and its civi lization came to a bitter end: the first Diaspora . . . Their migrations, it is certai n, took them to where earlier groups had gone, such as Harran where Mesopotamia links up with Anatolia, the place to where Terah and his family had migrated and which was already then known as \"Ur away from Ur.\" They undoubtedly stayed (and prospered) there in ensuing centuries, for Abraham sought a bride for Isaac his son among the erstwhile relatives there, and so did Isaac's son Jacob. Their wanderings no doubt also fol- lowed in the footsteps of the famed Merchants of Ur, whose loaded caravans and laden ship s had blazed trails on land and sea to places near and far. Indeed, one can learn where the \"displaced persons\" of Su mer went by looking at the"},{"pageNumber":364,"pageContent":"370 WHEN TIME BEGAN foreign cultures that sprouted one after the other in foreign lands—cultures whose scrip! wa s the cuneiform, whose lan- guage included countless Sume rian \"loanwords\" (espe- cially in the scien ces), whose pantheons , even if the gods were called by local names, were the Sumerian pantheon, whose \"myths\" were the Sumerian \"myths,\" whose tales of heroes (such as of Gilgamesh) were of Sumerian heroes. How far did the wanderers of Sumer go? We know that they certainly went to the lands where new nation-states were formed within two or three centuries after the fall of Sumer. While the Amurru (\"Westerners\"), fol- lowers of Marduk and Nabu, pour ed into Mesopotamia and provided the rulers that made up the First Dynasty of Mar- duk's Babylon, other tribes an d nations-to-be engaged in massive population movements that forever changed the Near East, Asia, and Europe. They brought about the emer- gence of Assyria to Babylon's north, the Hittite kingdom to the northwest, the Hurrian Mitanni to the west, the Indo- Aryan kingdoms that spread from the Caucasus on Baby- lon's northeast and cast, and t hose of the \"Desert peoples\" to the south and of the \"Sealan d people\" to the southeast. As we know from the later re cords of Assyria, Hatti-land, Elam, Babylon and from their tr eaties with others (in which each one's national gods were invoked), the great gods of Sumer did forgo the \"invitation\" of Marduk to come and reside within the confines of Babylon's sacred precinct; instead, they mostly became national gods of the new or old-new nations. It was in such lands that the Sumerian refugees were given asylum all around Mesopotamia, serving at the same time as catalysts for the conversion of their host countries into modern and flourishing states. But some must have ventured to more distant lands, migrati ng there on their own or, more probably, accompanying the displaced gods themselves. To the east there stretched the limitless reaches of Asia. Much discussed has been the mi gratory wave of the Aryans (or lndo-Aryans as some prefer).

Th e Vedic tales of gods and heroes that they brought w ith them were the Sumerian \"myths\" retold; the notions of Time and its measurement and cycles were of Sumerian or igin. It is a safe assumption, we believe, that mingled into the Aryan migration were Sumerian refugees; we say \"safe assumption\" because Su- merians had to pass that way in order to reach the lands that we call the Far East. It is generally accepted that within two centuries or so of 2000 B.C. a \"mysteriously abru pt change\" (in the words of William Watson, China) had occurred in China; without any gradual development the land was transformed from one of primitive villages to one with \"walled cities whose rulers possessed bronze weapons and chariots and the knowledge of writing.\" The cause, all agree, was the arrival of migrants from the west—t he same \"civilizing influ- ences\" of Sumer \"which can ul timately be traced to the cultural migrations comparable to those which radiated in the West from the Near East\"—the migrations in the after- math of the fall of Sumer. The \"mysteriously abrupt\" new civilization blossomed out in China circa 1800 B.C. according to most scholars. The vastness of the country and the sparseness of the earliest evidence offer fertile grounds for scholarly disagreements, but the prevalent opinion is that writing was introduced together with Kingship by the Shang Dynasty; the purpose was significant in itself: to record omens on animal bones. The omens were mostly concerned with inquiries for guid- ance from enigmatic Ancestors. The writing was monosyllabic and the script was picto- graphic (from which the familiar Chinese characters evolved into a kind of \"cuneiform\"—Fig. 164)—both hallmarks of Sumerian writing. Nineteenth-c entury observations regard- ing the similarity between the Chinese and Sumerian scripts were the subject of a major st udy by C.J. Ball (Chinese and Sumerian, 1913) that was publis hed under the auspices of Oxford University. It proved conclusively the similarity be- tween the Sumerian pictographs (from which the cuneiform"},{"pageNumber":366,"pageContent":"372 WHEN TIME BEGAN Figure 164 signs evolved) and the old forms (Ku Wen) of Chinese writing. Ball also tackled the issue of whether this was a similarity stemming only from the expectation that a man or a fish would be drawn pictorially in similar ways even by unrelated cultures. What his research ha s shown was that not only did the pictographs look the same, but they also (in a material number of instances) were pr onounced the same way; this included such key terms as An for \"heaven\" and \"god,\" En for \"lord\" or \"chief,\" Ki for \"Earth\" or \"land,\" Itu for \"month,\" Mul for \"bright/shining\" (planet or star). Moreover, when a Sumerian syllable had more than one meaning, the parallel Chinese pictograph had a similar set of varied meanings; Fig. 165 re produces some of the more than one hundred instan ces illustrated by Ball. Recent studies in linguistics, spearheaded by former So- viet scholars, have expanded the Sumerian link to include the whole family of Centra l and Far Asian or \"Sino- Tibetan\" languages, Such links form only one aspect of a variety of scientific and \"m ythological\" aspects that recall those of Sumer. The former are especially strong; such aspects as the calendar of twelve months, time counting by dividing the day into twelve double-hours, the adoption of the totally arbitrary device of the zodiac, and the tradition of astronomical observations are entirely of Sumerian origin."},{"pageNumber":367,"pageContent":"Aftermath 373 Figure 165 The \"mythological\" links are more widespread.

Theories concerning the former route see the Sumerian refugees pass ing through the area that is now the state of Georgia (in wh at used to be the Soviet Union), accounting for its people's unusual language which shows affinity to Sumerian, then advancing along the Volga River, establishing its princi pal city whose ancient name was Samara (it is now called Kuybichev), and—according to some researchers—finally r eaching the Baltic Sea. This would explain why the unusual Fi nnish language is similar to no other except to Sumerian. (Some also attribute such an origin to the Estonian language.) The other route, where some archaeological evidence sup- ports the linguistic data, sees the Sumerian refugees ad- vancing along the Danube Rive r, thereby corroborating the deep and persistent belief am ong the Hungarians that their unique language could also have had but one source: Sumerian. Have Sumerians indeed come this way? The answer might be found in one of the most puzzling relics from antiquity that can be seen where the Danube meets the Black Sea in what was once the Celtic-Roman province of Dacia (now part of Romania). There, at a site called Sarmizegetusa, a series of what researchers have called \"calendrical temples\" includes what could well be de scribed as \"Stonehenge by the Black Sea.\" Built on several man-made terraces, various structures have been so designed as to form integrated components of a wondrous Time Computer made of stone and wood (Fig. 166). Archaeologists have identified five structures that were in reality rows of round stone \"lobes\" shaped to form short cylinders, neatly arranged within rectangles formed by sides made of small stones cut to a precise design. The two larger of these rectangular structur es contained sixty lobes each, one (the \"large old sanctuary\") in four rows of fifteen, and the other (the \"large new sa nctuary\") six rows of ten.

This and the prevalence of the number sixty, the basic number of the Sumerian sexa- gesimal system, led researcher s to discern strong links to ancient Mesopotamia. The similarities, H. Daicoviciu wrote, \"could have been neit her a coincidence nor an ac- cident.\" Archaeological and ethnographic studies of the area's history and prehistory in general indicate that at the beginning of the second mille nnium B.C. a Bronze Age civilization of \"nomadic shepherds with a superior social organization\" (Rumania, an o fficial guidebook) arrived in the area that was until then settled by \"a population of simple hand-tillers.\" The time and the description fit the Sumerian migrants. Figure 168 The most impressive and intr iguing component of this Calendar City is the third rou nd \"temple.\" It consists of two concentric circles surr ounding a \"horseshoe\" in the middle (Fig. 168), bearing an uncanny similarity to Stone- henge in Britain.

Altogether, then, the outer circle of 104 stones rings an inner circle of 210 (180 + 30) stones. The second circle, between the outer one and the horse- shoe, consists of sixty-eight postholes—akin to the Aubrey holes at Stonehenge—divided into four groups separated by horizontal stone blocks: three each in the northeast and southeast positions and four each in the northwest and south- east positions, giving the \"h enge\" its main northwest- southeast axis and its perpendicular northeast—southwest one.

They concluded that the \"stellar era\" cons isted of four periods of 520 years each (double the 260 of the Mesoamer ican Sacred Calendar), and that the ultimate purpose of the calendrical complex was to measure an \"era\" of 2,080 years (4 x 520)-—the approx- imate length of the Age of Aries. Who was the mathematical-astronomical genius who had devised all that, and to what purpose? The spellbinding answer, we believe, also leads to a so- lution of the enigmas of Quetza lcoatl and the circular ob- servatories that he had built, the god who according to Mesoamerican lore left at one point in time to go back eastward across the seas (promi sing to return). Was it not just the Enlilite gods who had guided and led the wandering Sumerians, but also Thoth/ Ningishzidda (alias Quetzal- coatl), the god of the Game of Fifty-two, who himself had been displaced from his native land? And was the purpose of all th e \"stonehenges\" in Sumer, and South America, and Mesoamer ica, and the British Isles, and on the shores of the Black Sea, not so much to adjust the lunar year to the solar one, not just for calculating Earthly Time but—ultimately—to calculate Celestial Time, the zo- diacal Ages?
