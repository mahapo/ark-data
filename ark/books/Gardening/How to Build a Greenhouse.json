Obviously its warmer in a greenhouse than it is outside (most often any way!). It’ s all to do with solar ener gy. Solar energy is the sunlight that hits the Earth. Sunlight is converted to thermal energy when it hits Earth and this is the warmth that you feel around you on a hot sunny day. A greenhouse traps these rays and heats them up. The sunlight filters through the glass of the walls and roof of the greenhouse that is normally made of glass or polycarbonate, and the air inside the greenhouse then heats up. This effect is good for plants because it helps them to grow to their full potential. The greenhouse also acts as a protective barrier as it helps to keep plants away from the elements such as frost, wind and rain. Plants always grow better if they are exposed to a reasonable amount of good sunlight, heat, and a good source of water. This is what a greenhouse can offer and achieves, if it is looked after properly . Composition of a Greenhouse and its Ef fects: Greenhouses are usually made of plastic or glass. The main function of a greenhouse is to trap as much sunlight as possible and therefore as much heat as possible within the confines of the building. The plants use sunlight in a process called photosynthesis to make energy (sugars) that they then use to grow. This process is more efficient when the temperature is warm. The sunlight is eventually reflected back to space by the plants and the greenhouse soil. The energy (sunlight) entering a greenhouse is composed of shortwave infrared radiation. This type of energy can pass through the greenhouse glass. Everything in the greenhouse absorbs this energy and reflects it back out. However , once the energy is absorbed it changes composition and becomes long wave infrared radiation. This type of radiation cannot pass through the glass of the greenhouse and it gets trapped inside."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The process of sunlight entering the greenhouse in the form of short wave radiation continues and more energy is trapped. The result is that the greenhouse gets hotter and hotter. The greenhouse then becomes hot and humid. Water vapour is released by the plants in a process called evapotranspiration (this is the process whereby plants release water vapour back to the atmospher e via stomata pores in their leaves) One of the by-products of plant photosynth esis is water vapour and it is this that makes a greenhouse humid. One of the earliest greenhouses was constructed by Tiberius a Roman emperor , this was around 30 AD. Tiberius loved cucumbers and had a craving for them. Tiberius realized that in colder climates they could not be grown all year . Glass was not invented by 30 AD so the Romans used a material known as “Specularium ” and this was made from tiny translucent sheets of mica. The first examples of greenhouses were to be found in 13th Century Italy. It is widely believed though that a Dutch botanist named Jules Charles may have designed the first practical glass greenhouse in 1599. Greenhouse construction became very popular in modern Europe. Some of the structures were very large and they were known as Orangeries. This is because they were used to protect orange trees from freezing temperatures. Later, when the pineapple and other exotic fruit plants were brought back by the early explorers, more and more greenhouses were built. As the craft of greenhouse building became more advanced, angled glass walls and heating flues were improved to make greenhouses more durable. By the end of the 19th century the rich of Europe would compete for the most elaborate greenhouses to grow flowers and fruits and to please the eye. One of the best examples of such a greenhouse is the conservatory at Kew Gardens in England. Times have changed since the early days of huge and expensive greenhouses. Modern greenhouses have now been developed into simple and practical structures. It is no longer only the wealthy that can own a greenhouse. If you have an"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"interest in gardening, you can set up a greenhouse in your backyard. "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"THE GREENHOUSE A greenhouse gives the gardener many possibilities within any kind of garden. It extends the seasons and provides an environment for growing a range of plants that would not otherwise ripen or develop fully. It also hugely expands the opportunities for propagation and is also a haven for tender plants in winter . Before purchasing a particular type or size of greenhouse it is really important to understand what you are most likely to use it for. For example if headroom is required in order to grow tomatoes you are going to need height to be able to do so. If you plan to grow something like alpines, plenty of waist high benching will be required. The ability to split a greenhouse into sections will also be useful if you intent to keep a variety of tropical plants from dif ferent parts of the world. Everyone purchases or builds a greenhouse almost always eventually wishes that it was bigger , so make sure that you buy or build the biggest greenhouse that your garden and budget will allow. There is a good choice of green houses available to gardeners, with the 2.5 m x 2m (8x6’) being the number one seller and the most popular greenhouse to build. The first figure relates to the length of the greenhouse and the second figure the width. It is worth considering buying or building a wider green house if you can. The door is usually wider (as you would expect on a wider greenhouse) and this gives easier access for a wheelbarrow and other equipment. Also there are many units available that allow many greenhouses to be extended in length, but it is much more difficult to extend the width of a greenhouse once it has been built. The traditional straight-sided rectangular greenhouse has always been best for gardeners and plants and this is still the case today. Straight sides mean that canes or strings are easily attached and both headroom and growing room are optimised. There are a number of other greenhouse shapes available such"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"as octagonal, hexagonal, and pentagonal, but these can prove to be awkward when trying to grow crops such as tomatoes or cucumbers. These types of greenhouse can be useful for pot plants, alpines or when used as propagation houses for seeds and young plants. The pitch or slope of a greenho use roof is an important thing to consider. A shallow pitch of less than 25 degrees is to be avoided because it can collect water or snow. This can cause damage through breakages and can also encourage the growth of moss, restricting the amount of light entering the greenhouse. The steeper the pitch on the roof is the easier it is for snow and water to run of f. Greenhouse frames are normally constructed of wood or aluminium. The choice of wood can be softwood or hardwood. Hardwood is more expensive but will last longer, softwood frames need more maintenance and will not last as long as hardwoo d. Traditionally greenhouse frames have been made of cedar wood but this is expensive, but very long lasting and durable. Until recently the aluminium made for greenhouse construction was bright and shiny. Powder coatings have now been developed and greenhouses are now available in subtle colours such as blues and greens. This is good, and garden designers are now using this in garden design schemes. It is best to only buy quality aluminium, as it will withstand the considerable forces of a growing year and the weather . There are advantages and disadvantages to using wood and aluminium. Wooden greenhouses take longer to warm up and cool down and therefore hold a more constant temperature. Aluminium greenhouses heat up quicker , but also lose heat faster. Aluminiu m greenhouses generally last longer and also need less maintenance. Wooden greenhouses always look more traditional, make better garden features and are more pleasant to work in. "},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Once you have decided on your frame material there are then four main glazing options available to you: Horticultural glass is the lowest grade of class and it’s cheap. When broken it shatters into large shards and this can be very dangerous. Toughened, tempered or safety glass is the choice for many manufacturers and suppliers of greenhouse materials and is now used as standard in many greenhouses. When broken it shatters into very small pieces. This can still be dangerous, but it is not as bad as or horticultural glass. Buy toughened glass only if it has the relevant safety kite mark or equivalent certification. Very often nowadays polycarbonate is used as greenhouse glazing and this has many advantages. It does not shatter and its twin wall layer construction acts like double-glazing. Polycarbonate doesn’t have sharp edges and it’s easy to handle. The downside is that it can be expensive. Because it has a double-glazing effect, this can also result in a hot greenhouse during the summer months. In smaller greenhouses this ef fect can be intensified. Acrylic sheets are a cheap option and they are lightweight. The acrylic can degrade in the sun after a few years and it then becomes brittle and yellow. Before purchasing make sure that all acrylic plastics have been certified as UV inhibited. This should ensure that the product retains its clarity for many years. Cheaper greenhouses may not be UV inhibited and as a result they will turn yellow and will be brittle. If you have not got room for a full size greenhouse there are also lots of smaller greenhouses or grow rooms to consider . These are simple aluminium structures over which a clear plastic cover can be secured. These are cheap and easy to assemble and are similar to a large cold frame or cloche. For"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"their price, they are good at covering trays of tender seedlings, but growing a crop of tomatoes in one is another matter . If you do buy one of these structures, a good tip when erecting it is to lay the plastic coverin g in the sun to enable it to become pliable. The plastic is prone to splitting if forced over the frame straight from the box. "},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"SITING A GREENHOUSE In an ideal world the ridge of a greenhouse should run in an east to west axis. If sited in this way the greenhouse will trap the maximum amount of sunlight without casting shade on itself. This is the prefect set up but the reality is that the advantages are minimal and as such are really only important only to commercial growers. Any greenhouse in normal circumstances should really be positioned as close to the house as possible. This makes it easier to pop out and check on it and it will also be cheaper and easier to lay services to it. The main objective when a greenhouse is sited is to avoid overhanging trees. Trees will cast shadows, shed leaves onto the greenhouse roof and drip water, leading to moss and algal growth. Having said that a greenhouse situated away from everything including the home, is not very welcoming and may get neglected. It can sometimes be a good idea to plant a hedge nearby as this will act as a good windbreak. However a balance needs to be struck between planting the hedge and the casting of shadows onto the greenhouse. A hedge that Stops the wind completely is not a good idea, as eddy currents are often formed behind such windbreak s and these can cause more damage than a simple blast of wind. Filtering the wind is more effective than blocking it and a mixed hedge planted 3m away from the greenhouse should stop any damage. It is important that you select a site for your greenhouse that it is level. This is vital if the greenhouse is to survive. You should never erect a greenhouse directly on to soil. The soil will move (think about gravestones that sink in graveyards, these move considerably because of the activity of earthworms beneath them), frames twist and glass breaks. Suppliers often sell ready made bases for their greenhouses. A solid base of paving slabs is a good idea and is easy to do. Remember that a"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"fully glazed greenhouse is a lightweight structure and a gust of wind through an open door can move a 2.5 x 2m (8’x6’) greenhouse easily. Because of this it is important to secure your greenhous e to its base and the base securely to the foundations. If you are planning to grow directly in to the soil borders you must make sure that the soil is in a fit state to support crops. If it is not then you need to add lots of nutrients and garden manure to it. It can be a good idea to have borders down one side of the greenhouse and a gravelled area and staging on the other side. You can then have a hard paved path down the centre. This makes it easier for everyone to use the greenhouse without damagi ng the soil. The central path should be wide enough to accommodate a wheelbarrow . "},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"EQUIPPING A GREENHOUSE If you are able to provide your greenhouse with a dedicated water supply this is the gold standard, as it will make your job of maintaining a well-stocked greenhouse easier. Best of all is to have a main’s tap fitted inside the greenhouse. However , not everyone is able to do this so other options have to be considered. The most basic method is a water butt that will collect the rainwater from the greenhouse roof. Every greenhouse should have one water butt and preferably two. A lot of rain falls on a greenhouse roof and none of it should be wasted. Fix guttering to both sides of the greenhouse and run downpipes into water butts or tanks. Place wire netting over the top of the downpipe to prevent leaves falling into the water and clogging the pipe. Ensure water butts are raised well off the ground- purpose made stands are available but bricks will do the same job- to allow you to fill your watering can. A good idea is to have a large container inside the greenhouse (ideally under staging) and this can then be filled with a hosepipe and used for dipping a watering can. Ideally the container should be partially sunk into the ground. This means that the water is at the same ambient temperature as the plants, and avoids giving tender seedlings a shock. "},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"ELECTRICITY The addition of electricity to your greenhouse makes a big difference and will provide you with lots of opportunities to run heaters, propagators and lighting. You must realize though that electricity and greenhouses can potentially be a very dangerous mix. It is important that a qualified electrician carries out this work. Armoured cable and waterproof sockets are essential. "},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"BENCHES AND SHELVING Benches and shelving are required in all greenhouses but they never seem to part of the standard greenhouse package. It is well worth bearing this in mind when planning your budget. The cost of benching and shelving can often be as much again as a cheap greenhouse. Benche s or staging should always be constructed so that they are at a comfortable working level for the main user of the greenhouse. When you make and install them (or purchase them), experiment until they are at the right height. Benchin g should be wide enough to be practical but not too wide. In practice it’s a good idea to have enough room for at least two seed trays end to end. When fully loaded the benching will have take a lot of weight so make sure that it is as sturdy as possible and add extra cross members to the frame if necessary . "},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"VENTILA TION Ventilation is very important in a greenhouse (many will say that it is as important as heat) and it is accepted that more harm can be done by too little ventilation than by too much. It helps to control the heat and reduce humidity as this helps to prevent fungal and bacterial diseases from taking hold. By far the largest ventilator in a greenhouse is the door and this is normally sliding or hinged. Sliding doors will not slam shut and tend to be more space saving. However , the runners can become worn and this can hinder the opening and closing process. Hinged doors do slam and should ideally open outwards, away from the greenhouse. Most greenhouses come supplied with one vent fitted to the roof as standard , but it is worth asking the greenhouse supplier to add another if it is at all possible (or build an extra one yourself). Side vents or windows are just as important. For low-level ventilation louvered vents are the best, as they open to allow lots of air circulation, they will also stop animals entering the greenhouse. If you are at work during the day and have to leave your greenhou se unattended it is a wise precaution to fit automatic ventilators. These function by way of a cylinder of wax that expands or contracts according to the ambient tempera ture. A rise causes expansion of the wax and this pushes a piston that opens the window , a reduction in the ambient tempera ture causes a contraction of the wax and the window closes. "},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"HEATING Heating a conservatory is usually done by connecting a radiator to the central heating system of the main house. Tubular heaters are often used as they are silent, the even heat is thermostatically controlled, and the units can look good. Electric fan heaters are a good idea for the greenhouse. One can be placed in the cool area of the greenhouse and the other can be used to provide heat to maintain heat in a portioned off section of the greenhouse where you may want to have a steady temperatu re. There is some debate as to what to call a greenhouse when it is maintained to a particular temperature. A cool greenhouse is not just a measure of how trendy it is, but describes its temperature range as being kept above 5 C that then enables frost tender plants to be successfully overwintered. A greenhouse heated to a constant 20 C was often called a stove house and more recently a tropical house and these are capable of providing conditions for year round growth of house and conservatory plants. A cold greenhouse is unheated and is therefore only 3-4 degrees above the outside temperature. In severe weather plants inside the green house may freeze. There are ways to save money on your heating bills: You can buy a heater with a thermostatic control. Set the thermostat to the required temperature and the heater will do the rest. Make sure that your heater is well serviced and maintained. Trim wicks in paraffin burners to ensure economy and smokeless heat. Clean dirt of f all heating elements "},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"Block all draughts and ensure that doorways are well insulated. Bubble plastic is a good thing to use as insulation on all glazing panels and as a draught curtain behind doors, and is easily affixed to both wooden and metal frames. Always make sure that there is a gap between the glass and the plastic, as this is what provides the vital layer of air that heats up in the sun and retains heat in the greenhouse. Some gardeners insulate the whole of their greenhouse but this can cause condensation problems if you are not careful. Insulating just the roof will conserve heat and save you money. Some gardeners leave the insulation in place all year round. In summer this is useful as it can act as shading. However in spring and early autumn it can filter out too much of the available sunlight to the detriment of your plants. The useful tips include: Rather than heating the whole greenhouse in winter, try to group plants into one half of the greenhouse and keep this heated. Large greenhouses will be able to accommodate a complete smaller greenhouse inside. This acts as good double-glazing. Use a minimum maximum thermometer . This thermometer shows what the minimum and maximum temperatures achieved have been during the period since the thermometer was reset. It is able to give a gardener the precise idea of how the greenhouse heating and ventilation are working. It may show that a heater could be turned down. As with all thermometers, when placed it needs to be out of direct sunlight in a place where air is able to circulate. "},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"COLD FRAMES Cold frames can be used to very good effect so please do not dismiss them as not being as useful as a greenhouse. If you haven’t the room for a greenhouse then a cold frame could be just what you need. Most people are at least able to fit a cold frame into their garden and even if you have a huge greenhouse a couple of cold frames can still be a very useful addition to the garden. They can be used to overwinter plants, or to grow vegetables directly into the soil and are very useful for hardening off (the process whereby plants are acclimatized to outside conditions between the greenhouse and the garden). Moving your seedlings from the greenhouse straight to the outdoors can be like going from a sauna to an ice bath and this is not good for your plants. Cold frames are a good half way house between the greenhouse and outside conditions. Heaters are available for cold frames but insulation with bubble wrap or old carpet placed on top of the cold frame over night when the weather is at its coldest always helps. During all but the coldest days the tops of cold frames should be opened to allow cooler air to circulate, but always make sure that you close the cold frame at night. "},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"EDIBLE GREENHOUSE CROPS"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"T OMATOES It is a good idea to sow your tomato seed in two or three batches about two months before planting out, in the UK this means from about mid February to the end of March. There is no point in sowing the seed too early if you are growing the plants outside, as they will not grow well until the weather warms up. There are lots of different methods of sowing the seed but scattering the seeds thinly on to a seed tray filled with peat free sowing compost works very well. Tomatoes need a little heat to germinate (about 15 C (59F). A heated propagator is a good idea to get them started. Tomato seeds tend to germinate very quickly so as soon as the first true leaves appear pot them on into larger pots containing a good quality potting compost. Do not allow the plants to be exposed to the cold once they have been potted on or this will check their growth. Plants that have blue or purple tinges to their leaves have suffered cold damage and might not fully recover . Tomatoes always grow better under cover and will fruit better in these conditions. The choice of location will partly be driven by the way that the variety of tomato grows. There are two variations, and these called bush and cordon. Bush tomatoes grow to a vigorous bushy size and the fruit all ripens more or less at the same time and is then harvested. Cordon tomatoes will grow for as long as the conditions are right and they can reach really good heights that will produce fruit over a long period of time. However , climate does restrict this and in the UK this is normally between July and October . Cordon tomatoes are trained up a cane or twine and are pruned by pinching out all the lateral shoots that grow at 45 degrees between the stem and the leaves. These side shoots are very vigorous and need to be removed as they inhibit the development of fruit. Tomatoes should always be planted deeply so that the stem is buried right up to the first pair of leaves. New roots will then grow from the submer ged part of the stem. Cordon tomatoes should be planted about eighteen inches apart with three feet between rows. They appear to be close together but there is still plenty of room between and around the rows for picking and pinching out and for air to circulate around the plants. The cordons need to be very sturdy, as they will potentially have to hold up about 45kg (10lb) of fruit. Allow at least three feet in each direction between bush plants and twice that distance between rows. Support bush tomatoes with canes and /or string or wire to stop them flopping over . If you are growing in a container , a 1.5 litre pot is about the smallest workable size, 20 litres is much better. Peat free grow bags can be much improved by taking a couple of old pots and cutting the bottoms out before fixing them into the bag. Then plant the tomatoes into the pots so the roots grow on down into the bag beneath them. Tomatoes need plenty of water, especially as they are growing. Water every three or four days in the soil and every day in pots. As the fruits start to ripen this watering regime can be cut back, otherwise the tomatoes may split. Also too much water gives you over lar ge tasteless tomatoes. "},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"If you have good soil, well enriched with compost, the plants will not need extra feeding. But container -grown plants do well with a feed once a week. Liquid seaweed or home-made comfrey fertilizer are good choices. Comfrey in particular is very good for tomatos, the leaves of the plant can just be cut and placed around the base of the tomato plants as a mulch. Tomatoes are very easy to grow but they do need regular attention, especially the cordon varieties. They need to be supported very well and tied in regularly . This is a twice- weekly task during the main growing season. Side-shoots can be picked of f at the same time. Potential tomato problems Although tomatoes like heat and plenty of moisture, many of their problems occur because there is not sufficient air flow around the plants. As the fruits set it is a good idea to remove he lower leaves up to the first truss of fruit. When these are ripened, the next set of leaves can be taken off, and so on until by the end of September the plants are completely leafless. This also helps to speed up the ripening of green tomatoes. Tomatoes are close relatives of the potato and suffer the same diseases. Especially common is potato blight. Never grow outdoor potatoe s in soil that has had potatoes in it in the previous two years and always keep your potatoes well away from your tomatoes. Potato blight manifests itself as pale brown blotches on the leaves that quickly radiate out. The fungus also targets the fruit and this makes it inedible. Plants that have been infected should be removed at once. The remaining plants can be sprayed with Bordeaux mixture. Tomatoes also suffer from blossom end rot and this manifests itself as a flattened calloused hard brown disc at the end of the fruit. This disease is caused by an inadequate water supply that in turn stops the plant from taking in enough calcium and this causes the cells to collapse. To prevent blossom end rot, water"},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"regularly and if you have acidic soil grow only small fruited varieties that tend to be less susceptible to the problem. Splitting Fruits and Leaf Curl. Fruits sometimes split and develop a grey wispy mould. It is caused by an irregular water supply or big variations in temperature between day and night. . Always close the greenhouse before the evening cools down and keep the window wide open all day. Cold nights will also cause leaves to curl up lengthways and look as if they are about to die. Older leaves tend to be more af fected than younger ones. White Fly The adult lays its eggs on the lower leaves, and after a nymph stage the new adult emerges and feeds on the leaves, sucking sap, spreading viruses and exuding honeydew on which fungus feeds. The flies overwinter , especially on perennial plants. Basil can be grown with Tomatoes as a deterrent against white fly. Varieties ‘Shirley’ can produce heavy crops of medium sized red fruits. It has a long fruiting season and is tolerant to the cold. The short distance between leaves enables the plant to produce a lot of fruit for the space it occupies. ‘Brandywine’ has very large fruits with meaty red flesh. This is an old Amish variety dating back to 1885. It is delicious raw or cooked. ‘Gardeners Delight’ is one of the tastiest cherry or small fruiting varieties that you can choose. The plant produces masses of trusses containing the small cherry sized tomatoes. "},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"‘Sungold’ produces tomatoes that are yellow/gold in colour and these are delicious. It is easy to pick one of these and pop it in your mouth whilst you are in the green house as they are that tasty! ‘Black Russian’ this plant produces medium sized fruit with vermillion coloured skin. They taste really good. "},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"C HILLIES Chillies are easy to grow and a greenhouse or a cold frame are the ideal environment in which to do so. They are related to tomatoes and if you treat them like tomatoes you will not go far wrong. There are five main wild species of chilli and these are capasicum annuum that produces all the sweet peppers including many of the hot ones including jalapeno and bell pepper varieties. Capasicum frutescens is the one that produces Tabasco Sauce, Capsicum chinense that produces the really hot Habanero and Scotch bonnet varieties, Capasicum baccatum that produces the Aji varieties and Capasicum pubescens that produces the Rocoto and Manzano varieties. Chilles are hot and the heat in them is measured by a scale called Scoville units. Sweet peppers have a rating of zero, Jalapenos get a rating of 2,500-5,000 units, Tabasco gets a rating of 30,000 to 50,000 units and a Habanero or Scotch bonnet gets a rating of 100,000 to 350,000 units. A chilli is not actually hot. The sensation of heat is caused by an acute reaction to the chemical capsaicin, and this is found in the white pithy ribs that run down the middle and along the sides of a pepper and connect the seeds to the flesh. The proximity of the seeds to this pith makes them hot too. It is interesting to note that there is no connection between the colour of the chilli and heat as many yellow and orange peppers can be hotter than some of the red ones. If you want really hot chilli’s then neglect them! The hotter the sun is the poorer the soil and the less water they get the hotter the chillies will be. It is best to sow the seeds in mid February or march in a heated greenhouse where the temperature will not drop below 15 C (59 F). The seeds should germinate quickly but they are then slow to develop as seedling s. When they are large enough prick them out and re pot into good quality peat free potting compost.

Chillies are also very ornamental and are attractive plants to grow in their own right. There are many varieties to choose from. A couple of the best ones include: ‘Habanero’ this is a very hot chilli, one of the hottest available. This chilli is a strong grower and it produces lantern shaped fruits that are wrinkled and are a salmon orange colour . ‘Hungarian Hot Wax’ this is not as hot as Habanero but crops earlier and the fruits are elongated and change colour from light green to yellow , orange and then red. "},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"C UCUMBERS Cucumbers are often grown with tomatoes but they actually prefer a warmer and more humid environment. They are excellent for a greenhouse where the temperature never falls below 10 C (50 F). Cucumbers are ideally sown in March. Sow in good quality seed compost, two seeds to a 3-inch pot placed on their sides. The seed needs a temperature of 21 C (70 F) to germinate. The airing cupboard is a good place to put the seeds to give them some heat, but keep a close eye on them, and remove them to the light at the first sign of germination. Remove the weaker of the two seedlings and allow the other one to grow on. Maintain a reasonable heat while the seedlings are growing. Re-pot the seedlings when they are pot-bound into their final growing pot that should be 15-18 inches, or plant into the prepared border of your greenhouse. Cucumbers prefer a very rich soil so add plenty of organic material and feed regularly with tomato fertilizer . Cucumber plants can produce both male and female flowers, but it is known that if a male flower pollinates a female flower the resulting cucumber will be bitter. Because of this male flowers should be removed from the plant. You can identify the male flowers because they do not have the small embryonic fruit at the base of the flower. All female flower varieties of cucumber can now be purchased if you do not want to do this. Cucumber plants can be trained up bamboo canes or up wires and strings tied to the roof of your greenhouse. The plants can carry a lot of weight when in full fruit so you must make sure that your support canes, wires etc are sturdy and up to the job. It is common practice to remove the growing tip when the cucumber reaches the roof of the greenhouse. Side shoots are"},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"also produced and these should be pinched out when a female flower and two pairs of leaves have been produced. Cucumbers are very fast growers so you must do this on a daily basis and keep on top of the job. Having said that if you let your cucumbers grow wild you will still produce a good crop- but you may not be able to get into your greenhouse because of all the growth! There are now lots of varieties of cucumber to choose from and I have always found these ones to be reliable croppers and free from disease: ‘Esmarald’ is a predominantly female variety that resists cucumber mosaic virus and powdery mildew . It produces tasty fruits in lar ge numbers. ‘Crystal Apple’ produces round fruits with large cavities. The skin of the fruit changes colour to yellow on maturing. ‘Carmen’ the fruit has a spineless skin. The fruits are seedless and are produced in lar ge numbers. Aubergines (Egg Plant) The auber gine is a relative of the tomato but the plants actually prefer similar conditions to those enjoyed by cucumbers. They like lots of heat and humidity and lots of moisture. Aubergines have a long growing season so they should be sown as early as possible. I sow mine in February in 3-inch pots, two seeds on their sides to each pot (like cucumbers). I use a good quality seed compost and place the pots into a propagator with the temperature set at 18 C (64 F). The seeds should germinate after 8-10 ten days. Thin out the weaker seedling and pot on as necessary , ending up with a final pot size of ten inches. Having said that aubergines grow much better if they are planted in a bed so if you are able to plant them in your greenhouse border ."},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":" Once the plants are 90cm (3 feet) tall pinch out the growing tip. This will ensure that all of the plants energy goes to fruit production. Water aubergines regularly and never allow them to dry out. Mist with water once a week to avoid an infestation of red spider mite. It takes about 20 weeks from sowing to harvesting. The fruit is actually ready to pick when it is firm and has glossy skin. Various colours of aubergine are available and they range from purple to red to white to even mottled. ‘De Barbentane ’ is a great medium-sized cylindrical black aubergine from France, with firm white flesh. It delivers consistently high production and good flavour . "},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"C ITRUS F RUITS A greenhouse is the ideal place to overwinter citrus plants. You can keep the plants frost-free and ticking over until the warmer months arrive. Check the plants regularly as pests can still be a problem under glass during winter. Look out for aphids and scale insects, both of which will happily overwinter in your greenhouse. Growing citrus plants is easy but they do require very good drainage. A mixture of peat-fre e compost and grit are ideal. Citrus plants like to kept on the dry side so do not overwater or allow them to become water logged. It is actually better to let the plants dry out completely before re-watering them. When re-potting citrus plants only go a pot size larger than the last one as the plants do better if the pot that they are in is barley big enough to hold their roots. Feeding can be done with a special citrus feed or a general- purpose liquid feed, not tomato feed! Citrus plants are worth the effort as there is nothing better than producing your own home grown oranges and lemons. Grape V ines Growing grape vines in your greenhouse can be problematical as a vine will take up a lot of room and also cast shade. If you have a full grown grape vine in your greenhouse it may difficult to grow things like tomatoes underneath the it, as there will not be enough light. However , if you go for a grapevine in your greenhouse (or a section of it) no heat will be required unless you want to grow a specialist cultivar . Vines are best planted in the border of"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"your greenhouse and they can then be trained up the back wall as one main stem. You can then develop a permanent framework. Each year side shoots that develop from the main stem will produce flowers and then grapes. Make sure that you keep the vine well fed and watered in summer . It is best to prune your vine in mid winter when it is completely dormant. You can then cut back all the side shoots to your main framework. "},{"pageNumber":36,"pageContent":"F IGS Figs can be trained in a similar way to grape vines. They are best planted in the border of the greenhouse and do well when their roots are confined. If they are allowed a large root run they will produce masses of leaves and no fruit. Training in a fan shape against the back wall of the greenhouse is the best option for a fig. In summer feed well with liquid tomato feed and keep well watered. Prune your fig tree in mid winter when it is dormant. Keep the size of the tree down and prune to improve the overall shape of the tree. Brown Turkey and Brunswick are two excellent varieties to grow and neither needs heat if grown in a greenhouse.

You can get your annuals, bi-annu als and perennials on the go as soon as the days are long enough. Sow your regular greenhouse plants in the spring like your tomatoes, cucumbers and aubergines. This is a good time to check everything in your greenhouse to make sure that it is working. It is very important that you check your automatic vents to make sure that they are working and are providing enough ventilation. Keep your greenhouse heaters in place as the weather can still get cold and you may have to use them. Prepare your border soil for the new season and make sure that you incorporate lots of fresh compost and well-rotted manure or humus. Now is a good time to harden off seedlings in the greenhouse. Remember that your greenhouse is a ‘halfway house’ between sowing indoors and eventually planting things into your garden. Make sure that your greenhouse is nice and clean and ready for the season. After a long winter it is often necessary to give your greenhouse glass (or other material) a thorough clean to maximize the amount of sunlight reaching your plants. "},{"pageNumber":39,"pageContent":"S UMMER Your greenhous e can get very hot during the summer months so make sure that your ventilation is working correctly . It is a good idea to test this by using a maximum/minimum thermometer so that you know the maximum temperature reached during the day. Remember that your greenhouse will normally be at its hottest when you are at work during the day. Once you have determined how hot your greenhouse gets you can then adjust the ventilation accordingly . You can also provide some shade if necessary . Watering regularly is essential during the summer months so make sure that you do this morning and evening as required. This is the time to prune and train your tomatoes and cucumbers so make sure that this is done and that your plants are supported well. Check regularly for pests and consider using biological controls to eradicate them. Biologically controlling pests means that chemicals are not used and your produce will be organic and safer . Make sure that you damp down your greenhouse regularly . This will ensure that humidity is kept high and most plants will respond well to this. However, if you have an alpine house or something similar disregard this advice. You can use your greenhouse at this time of year to propagate cuttings and to plant seeds that will flower the following year . Harvest your produce regularly . If there is too much of it consider freezing it, make pickles and chutneys’ and if there is any left give it to your neighbours as it will be gratefully received. "},{"pageNumber":40,"pageContent":"A UTUMN Continue to ventilate your greenhouse as the temperatures can still get high. Now is a good time to sow sweet peas, peas for eating, and broad beans for use the following spring. Continue to maintain your tomato plants by pinching out the side shoots and harvest regularly . Take care when watering at this time of year as too much water can cause your greenhouse to become cold and damp. The idea is to retain the heat at this time of year . You may also need to use your greenhous e heaters to keep the temperature up at night. Use your maximum/minimum thermometer on a regular basis and adjust the heating accordingly . Now is also a good time to give your greenhouse a good clean after a busy summer season. Choose a warm day, remove what plants you can and give everything inside and outside a good clean. Once this has been done you can bring in your tender plants that need to be overwintered frost-free. Winter If you have some really tender plants you may want to consolidate them into a sectioned off area of your greenhouse. If you do this you can then heat that area and it will be cheaper than heating the whole greenhouse. If your greenhouse is heated electrically make sure that you have a back up. It is a good idea to invest in a paraf fin heater for this purpose. Keep an eye out for pests and diseases as they will persist if your greenhouse is kept heated during the winter months. Your plants can still suffer attacks from overwintering aphids and scale insects. Treat your greenhouse accordingly if any pests are found. "},{"pageNumber":41,"pageContent":"TYPES OF GREENHOUSE The cheapest reasonable quality greenhouse that you can buy is a standard-sized aluminium framed one from the main DIY stores. These are usually 2.4x2m (8x6). If you are not limited by price it is worth looking around at various greenhouse manufacturers or you might even conside r building your own. There are various styles and sizes available. It really depends on what you are after and to what purpose you want to put your greenhouse to. Timber greenhouses have a very traditiona l look and feel. If you need to put things up in a timber greenhouse you can use nails and screws rather than having to buy special fittings as you would have to with an aluminium greenhouse. The downside of having a timber greenhouse is that it will need regular treatment with a wood preservative. Age also impacts upon a wooden greenhouse as it will rot over time. Regular maintenance will be needed, as your greenhouse gets older . In contrast to this metal greenhouses need very little maintenance. Modern glazing units also mean that your greenhouse will be draught free. There are many different styles of aluminium greenhouse from mock-V ictorian to the ultra modern. The aluminium can now also be coloured and this gives a better effect when set in your garden. As well as the conventional shaped greenhouse that you can buy there are six sided structures that look like gazebos. These can look very good in small gardens where looks are important. Lean-to greenhouses seem to have gone out of fashion, as most people seem to want a conservatory on their house nowadays. However , a lean-to greenhouse is a very good idea on the side of a garage or shed. Polythene tunnels do not look great, but if you have a large garden or can tuck one out of the way they are a cheap alternative to a greenhouse and can be used to grow exactly the same produce. You can also use them as walk in cold frames for growing out of season vegetables. Polythe ne greenhouses do not need footings like a proper greenhouse. If you buy one you will need to replace the plastic every 4-5 years as it becomes brittle and can tear after prolonged exposed to the sun. A polythene greenhouse can be used as a valuable overflow area for your main greenhouse and will help to stop it becoming overloaded and untidy . Even the simplest greenhouse can be expensive and it may not fit your design criteria. A greenhouse from a manufact urer may not fit your plot or may not provide enough space for what you have in mind. Constructing your own greenhouse from a kit could be the best option for many gardeners. If you are working to a budget a greenhouse kit may be just the thing you need. The level of skill involved is within the range of most people. To begin with you must consider what you want from your greenhouse. If you want an elegant design that is going to look good, then one of the redwood greenhouse kits may the thing for you. Take a look at the Sunshine range. These are made from solid redwood frames with polycarbonate glazing. This type of greenhou se kit is easy to assemble because the glazing is built into the frame, so you have no cutting to do. Cutting glass can be an awkward thing to do. Fitting glass into a frame can be tricky and you may have many broken panes before you succeed in getting a good fit."},{"pageNumber":42,"pageContent":"Redwood greenhouse kits are an excellent option. The downside is the cost. They range from $1000 to $4000. If budget is an important consideration for you take a look at aluminum framed greenhouse kits. These range in price from $2,500 to £30,000. At the lower end of the range you may find a design that suits your purpose. They are not as elegant as the redwood greenhouse kits but the Cross Country range are very well designed and will provide years of use. The Hobby Gardener range of greenhouses are priced at $1000 to $2000 and these are very good value kits. They have “snaplass” panels made of polycarbonate. They are a good height and this makes working in them easy. Their hinged door and vent system allow the gardener to create an ideal microclimate inside the greenhouse. In terms of features such as doors and venting aluminium and readwood kits are comparable. They are engineered to high standards. An aluminium frame greenhouse will never look as natural and authentic as a redwood one but they have the advantage because the frames are maintenance free. The Juliana range of greenhouse kits is also worth considering. They are made of aluminium frames and have twin wall polycarbonate glazing. They start as low as $65 making them an ideal choice for the greenhouse gardener who is on a budget. For those on an even tighter budget the Little Greenhouse range of kits are worth considering. The kits are covered with 4mm polyethylene sheeting on a PVC frame. They are less durable than the types of greenhouse kits already discussed but they are more economical and good for the beginner . If you are not yet sure if you want to take up greenhouse gardening as a pastime time then a Little Greenhouse kit may be a good starting point. Perhaps you do not intend to stay long at your present home and do not want to commit to an expensive structure. They are useful if you already have a more permanent greenhouse as they can act as an overflow area. If you want a very large structure and the appearance of the greenhouse is not important to it is worth considering a portable greenhouse. These are made of a steel frame covered with plastic sheeting. These can be purchased for as little as $300. They look like commercial poly tunnels but they can be put to good use.
