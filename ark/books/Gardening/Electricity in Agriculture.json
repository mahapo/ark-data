The Publisher is desirous of placing Prof. Lemstrém’s interesting work before the public, with the view of hasten- ing the time when the utilisation of the electric current in agricultural and horticultural work will become a recognised development of the science and industry of up-to date cultivation of the land for market crops. That this deve- lopment will be advanced by Prof. Lemstrém’s valuable experiments there can,.the Publisher considers, be no question. As the greater part of the Author's scientific determina- tions regarding temperatures are made in Centigrade degrees, and for other measurements in the metric system, the Publisher, in accord with the Author’s wishes; and de- sirous of facilitating the reading of this book, has printed on the last pages tables containing a Figure showing the relations between the different thermometers, and a Table showing the metric measures (with their signs) in English measures. The Table is attached in such a manner that it can be readily consulted by the reader during his reading of the book."},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE AND HORTICULTURE. By Prof. S. LEMSTROM. INTRODUCTORY. § 4. It is well known that the question which is the subject of this book has been a favourite field of investiga- tion for a century past. As the subject is connected with no less than three sciences—viz., physics, botany and agri- cultural physics—it is in itself not particularly attractive. The causes which induced me to begin an investigation of this matter were manifold, and I venture to hope that a short exposition of them will not be without interest. During several voyages in the Polar regions (1868 to Spitzbergen and the north of Norway, and 1871, 1882, 1884 to Finnish Lapland), I had occasion to observe with my own eyes a peculiarity in the vegetable kingdom which also has attracted the attention of other explorers. When the plants in these regions have resisted the frequently destruc- tive night frosts they show a degree of development which greatly surpasses that of plants in more southern regions, where the climatic conditions are more advantageous. This rich development appears principally in the fresh and clear colours of the flowers, in their strong perfume, in the rapid development of the leaves on the trees, and their scent, but particularly in the rich harvest which diffe- rent seeds—such as rye, oats and barley—will produce when, as before stated, they are not destroyed by the frosts. From a bushel of rye sown they will often produce B"},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"2 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE 40 bushels, and from barley 20 bushels, and so forth. It is the same with grass. These results are attained although the people cultivate their soil very imperfectly, using only ploughs and harrows of wood. Vegetables require, for a rich development, a fertile soil and a sufficient quantity of heat, light and humidity ; but one of these principal conditions, that of heat, is to be found only in a slight degree in the Polar regions. To be convinced of this it is only necessary to glance at a map and follow the yearly isothermes, and especially the summer isothermes. The isotherm corresponding to a mean temperature of —7°C. to —8°C. crosses Spitzbergen, and that of o’C. goes through the north of Finnish Lapland. The mean temperature for the month of July is there 10°C., and at Spitzbergen 5°C.* The cause of the astonishing development of vegetation under such conditions has hitherto been held to lie in the long day, which lasts from two to three months in these regions during their short summer. It is further sometimes supposed that this circumstance will provide the crops with more light and heat, the principal factors of vegetation. This is, however, not true, for calculation shows that the quantity, notwithstanding this long day, is less than it is, for instance, in 69 deg. of latitude. In consequence of the low height of the sun over the horizon, the rays meet the earth in such an oblique direction that their illuminating and heating power is greatly lessened, and this power is also lessened by the great absorption in the atmosphere, Since the quantities of light and heat received are relatively smaller than in more southern regions, the cause of the rich development of the vegetables cannot lie in the long day, and must be sought elsewhere. For several reasons I was induced to search for the cause in electrical currents, the effect of which appears in the Polar light, and which are going from the atmosphere * See Thermometer Table at end of book."},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 3 to the earth or vice versa. The existence of these currents has been proved beyond all doubt through the experiments of the Finnish International Polar Expedition of 1882-84. § 2. My reasons will be shown in the following order :— (2) The physiology of plants gives a satisfactory expla- nation of the functions which most of their organs have to perform, and good reasons for their existence and their varying forms. This is, however, not the case with the needle-like shape of the leaves in fir trees, and the beard on the ears of most cereals. Since nothing exists without a purpose in all the infinite number of objects in Nature, then the needle-shaped leaves and the beard must have their determined ends. In fact, they are very well fitted to be the means through which the electricity goes from the atmosphere into the earth, or vice versa; thatis to say, they act in the same fashion as metallic points. To pretend that they really serve as a means of transmitting electricity only because their form shows them capable of it would be to go too far. The presence of electricity in the air around them shows that they are, in fact, in a position to perform this function of transmission. Through experiments made during the above-named expedition, it was, at least by analogy, proved that they really serve that end, for it was not only shown that such electrical currents exist, but these currents were even measured by means of a specially con- structed apparatus provided with metallic points. We are thus induced to concede that an electrical current is going on through the needle-formed leaves of the pine, and the beard on the ears of cereals, not to particularise other plants. Though this is the case, it is not, however, shown that this electrical current exercises any influence whatever in the process of vegetation, or, in other words, has any definite effect on the plant life itself. That must be proved by experiments, and a description of them, with an exposition of their results, is the principal object of this volume. B2"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"4 ELECTRICITY IN AGRILULTURE (4) In studying and observing sections of fir trees from different latitudes (60 deg. to 67 deg.) we have found a pecu- liarity in their yearly growth in thickness or year rings. They show in general a great difference in growth during different ages, but when due regard is paid to this fact, so that these differences may be eliminated, there remains another difference, which clearly must depend on the more or less advantageous nature of the atmospheric conditions of the year. These latter variations, taking into account principally the thickness of the year rings, show a periodicity in full agree- ment with the periods of the sun spots and the auroras— namely, a period of from Io to II years. By a comparison between sections of large pine trees from the Polar regions of lat. 67 deg. and from more southern latitudes (about 60 deg.), it will be seen that this periodic variation is much more pronounced the more nearly we approach the Polar regions. The circumstance that this periodicity agrees with that of the auroras will conduce to an investigation of a pos- sible connection betweeen the electrical current producing auroras and the year rings of these trees. As this peculiarity is more strongly developed in those regions of the earth where the electrical currents in question are of greater frequency and higher intensity, it indicates a connection between cause and effect which demands an investigation.* (¢) Inashort Paper entitled, “On the Periodic Variations in some Meteorological Phenomena, their Connection with the Changes of the Solar Surface and their Probable Influence on the Vegetation,”+ I have suggested, with a high degree of probability, that the harvest results in Finland show a periodicity which agrees with periodical variations in the sun spots and in the number of Polar lights. The greater the yearly number of sun spots and auroras, the more abundant is the harvest of seeds, roots, and grass.+ * This investigation is not yet published, + Finsk tidfkrift, 1878, in Swedish. { These harvest results also give evidence of the longer cycle period of about 58 years."},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 5 In the Paper’in which I treated these phenomena I have found the explanation of this periodicity in the different state of the heat radiating from the sun, either without spots or supplied with them. In the former.case the greater part of the heat rays are light, and of shorter wave length ; in the latter case the greater number are dark, and of greater wave length. The rays must pass through the atmosphere, and the darker heat rays will be absorbed during this passage rather than the lighter ones, and hence there will be more heat stored up in the atmosphere in the case when spots appear on the sun. This heat, generally contained in watery vapours, is transported through the air currents or winds into higher latitudes, and will there exercise its beneficent effect. Though I continue to regard this explanation as highly probable, I must introduce some modification, in order to ascribe a large influence to the Polar light, or rather its cause, the electric current from the atmosphere, In consequence of this modification of my ideas, I must give it an important place in order to explain the perio- dicity of the harvests. § 8. Everyone who has given attention to the question of the causes of the.electrical conditions of the atmosphere, : knows that several theories on this matter have been brought forward. The most widely known suppositions are the following :— (a) Unipolar induction, caused by the earth, as a magnet, rotating around its axis, produces a force component, which carries the positive electricity up in the atmosphere. (4) Evaporation, which, according to the opinion of several physicists, produces electricity, the vapours being positive. (c) Unipolar induction working together with the evapora- tion in making every particle, great or little, carried from the earth, positively electric. 4"},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"6 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE (d) The vegetation process on the earth, the friction of the small solid or liquid particles suspended in the atmo- sphere with the air, or between each other, the air’s friction against the surface of the earth. (e) The direct effect of the sun rays on the different layers of the atmosphere. A discussion of these very different views cannot be entered upon here. I will, therefore, only say that the majority of the physicists, as it seems to me, are at present inclined to give a certain precedence to the opinion which searches for the cause of the atmospheric electricity in the evaporation which is going on all over the earth (perhaps in connection with the unipolar induction). For my part I have no doubt that this conception is right—viz., that the watery vapours act as transmitters of the atmospheric electricity and carry it to the upper layers of the air, because it seems to me that this theory is very well founded and in full harmony with other closely allied phenomena. According to this opinion, therefore, the evaporation must be subjected to the same periodicity as the sun spots and also the electrical phenomena in the atmosphere. My opinion upon the manner in which Nature is fulfilling all this process is shortly as follows :—* The quantities of electricity which are carried up by the water vapours to the higher parts of the atmosphere reach there an air stratum with a low pressure. As this rarefied air is provided with a relatively high conducting power, it will form with the surface of the earth a nearly spherical condenser. The rarefied air space-lies, principally in con- sequence of the lower temperature, nearer to the earth surface around the poles. Through this circumstance a greater quantity of electricity will accumulate in these regions, and there discharge in auroral displays or in a current from the atmosphere. * See also “ L’Aurore Boreale,” by S. Lemstrém. Paris: Gauthier Villars, 1886, p. 131 and following."},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"i AND HORTICULTURE. 7 It has already been announced that the Finnish Inter- national Polar Expedition produced, by experiments made on mountain tops, auroral beams and light phenomena of the same nature as the auroras, and hence contributed to the confirmation of the opinion that auroras are caused by electric currents in the atmosphere. The E.M.F. (electro- motive force), or the force which produces this current, was measured. It was absolutely very little, but always existing, though with varying intensity. It is only in exceptional cases that it will produce light phenomena—viz., when the conditions of the atmosphere are favourable and the current is of high intensity. The most important result here is the proof of the existence of such a current, which is always passing either downwards or upwards. The experiments which have been carried out in Finnish Lapland, do not, strictly speaking, apply to other regions of the earth. Considering, however, that the laws of atmos- pheric electricity are nearly the same for all latitudes, the existence of such a current in the whole atmosphere seems not to be in doubt. This electric atmospheric current has hitherto been very little investigated ; it is only the atmospheric electricity which has been measured. The method has been to, measure the potential in a point of the air (or the electrical tension of it). These results cannot be used for conclusions regarding electrical current from the atmosphere, and, in consequence, not for the laws it follows. These observations of atmospheric electricity can, however, contribute to some general propositions. When it has been found, for instance, that the air near the earth’s surface is positive electrically (and seldom negative), and that the potential increases with the height, a general conclusion can be drawn that an electric current, an equalising of the difference of potential, is going on between the whole atmosphere and the earth. As has been said above, this current: produces luminous phenomena or Polar light only when in a state of high"},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"8 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE intensity. When these manifestations appear, principally in the Polar regions, it must be admitted that the current there possesses the highest intensity. The effect of it must, therefore, be more remarkable there than elsewhere. Once convinced not only of the necessity for finding a cause for the above-mentioned phenomena of the vegetable kingdom in the Polar regions, but also for the existence of the electric current from the atmosphere, I was strongly induced to connect the two phenomena, and to regard the electric current as the cause of the peculiar phenomena in the vegetation, and all that has been said about these peculiarities will find its explanation in this:—(1) The rich harvests and their periodicity ; (2) the periodical increase ’ in the year rings of the fir woods; and (3) the needle- formed leaves and the beards of the ears will, from this point of view, only be the means by which the electricity is conducted from the atmosphere to the earth. As the intensity of the current is highest in the Polar regions, its effect must also there be the greatest. It must not be overlooked that electricity has hitherto been regarded as of little or no importance in the complex life of a plant, and a great effect from its application was not anticipated. From a further consideration of the subject it will, however, be clear that this conception must be changed, and that electricity must be numbered among the principal factors in plant life. , THE EXPERIMENTS. § 4 Since the year 1746, when the Scotchman, Maim- bray, made his experiments on the influence of electricity on two myrtles, a great number of researches have been performed to examine this influence. The most striking feature of these experiments is that they are a/ways con- tradictory. “Hardly has one explorer obtained favourable results before another presents himself with directly oppo-"},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 9 site ones. A closer scrutiny shows that a favourable result is obtained every time the experiments are executed with artificial electricity—namely, with a machine. Exception shows only one case in which negative electricity was employed. The experiments have never been executed on a large scale, because the method was not convenient. In the case when the method was intended to spread the electricity over a larger field its application seemed to present much difficulty. The cause of the contradictory results has been searched for under conditions of only occasional occurrence—for instance, difference in soil, different illumination, &c. Without denying that such circumstances can exercise a very great influence, my more recent experience has shown that these contradictions can be explained without refer- ence to chance. Consideration of all the evidence I have obtained shows so decidedly that electricity exercised a favourable influence on the growing plants that I found a new examination of the question necessary. My first experiments, the aim of which was to test the usefulness of the method, were carried out in the physical laboratory of the University of Helsingfors. Omitting a number of experiments, the results of which only encouraged me to continue further, I will enumerate the first definite experiments made, from the beginning of May to June 24, 1885 :— (1) Before a window looking to the south three small compartments of cardboard were constructed, and on a table within were placed two flower-pots in each compart- ment. In these pots were sown barley, wheat and rye— four grains of each sort. The grains of every kind were of the same weight and appearance. Over the pots was hung a net of wires provided with points, separated from each other and insulated. The soil in the pots was connected with the earth by tinfoil in such manner that, when we call the compartments I, II, IIL, the electric current from"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"Io, ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE the positive pole of a Holtz electric influence machine was going in I. From the points in the air to the soil. II. From the soil in the pot to the points, III. Without wires. The negative pole of the machine was conducted to earth. The pots were watered with water of the same temperature and of the same quantity in every pot. After certain intervals the plants were measured as to their height, and the leaves both as to breadth and length. A week passed. We could already see a remarkable difference. The plants in the compartments I. and II. developed. much more strongly and more rapidly than in III. The electrical machine was kept working five hours daily. The experiments were continued to June 24th, when the increase of vegetation in I. and IJ. under the influence of the electric current was estimated to be 40 per cent. beyond the result in III. As the soil in the six pots was exactly alike, the cause of the greater development must be sought in the electric current. The difference between I. and II. was barely perceptible, though the current in I. was + and in II. —.* No differ- Lege between +E and —E is shown in these experiments. hoe also p. 11 on this point). (2) In the summer of 1885, the first experiments were performed on a field. This was a small barley field on the farm of Mr. W. Lemstrém, in the parish of Vichtis, in the south of Finland. Though the external circumstances were unfavourable, dryness being prevalent, the results were very satisfactory, the part of the field under the electric current giving an increase of about 35°1 per cent.

The plants came under treatment in such a way that half a garden bed of about 7 metres (23 feet) in length was under the current, the other half serving as “control.” The following are the results in percentages :— Per cent.

The most remarkable fact in this table is that some of the plants seem as though favoured by the electricity while others derived no benefit and were apparently injured by it. Among these last mentioned cabbage is prominent. It is, however, not necessary to discuss this inequality here, as it was later discovered that it had its cause in the want of water. The strawberries, planted in pots, were in a greenhouse and ranged in three compartments, separated from each In every compartment were two pots, and in the first + electricity in the second —(E) was given, the third being without E.

Inthe same summer (1886) a first experiment was per- formed on the estate of Brédtorp, in the parish of Pojo, in"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"12 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE the south of Finland, whose owner, the Baron E. Hisinger, I had the good fortune to interest in the experiments, and to whom I am under a great obligation for assistance in all directions given with the utmost courtesy and kindness. The experiments, executed on a wheat field of exceptionally good development, began first on June 20th, when the wheat was just flowering. When the crop was sifted in first and second qualities the result was: On thefexperimental field (0°5 hectare). | On the control field (05 hectare). 1,226'2kg. 1,292'5kg. 198'1kg. 1st quality, 1,028'1kg. 2nd. 126'1kg. rst, 1,166°4kg. 2nd. As thejexperiments began as late as the time of flowering of the wheat, an increase of the total crop could not be expected, but only an improvement in quality. .That had really been the case, and we find that the first quality is augmented on the experimental field by 57 per cent. (4) As the experiments hitherto performed had, as shown above, given very encouraging results, we were induced to make an extensive ‘series of experiments at Brédtorp in the year 1887, to which Baron Hisinger consented and gave, as before, his friendly assistance. We give below the results obtained, and refer the reader to the extensive treatment of this subject in the Paper “Expériences sur Influence de l’Electricité sur les Végé- taux ” :—* Average increase per cent.

(5) The results obtained by the experiments made up to 1887 were very encouraging to a continuation of the studies of the phenomenon ; but still many problems were yet to.be solved. Among these were the following :— Do we obtain the same results as in Finland if the experiments should be performed after the same method in another part of the globe, or, in other terms, would the effect be the same independent of the latitude? Considering the great importance of the whole question, any publication of the results without having given an answer to that question would, perhaps, have been fatal. The first and most important point of all was to raise the necessary funds. That great difficulty was overcome, and by Prof. E. Mascart we were introduced to Baron A. Thenard, who gave us permission to perform the experi- ments on his estate at Castle Laferté, in Burgundy, and also his support where it was needed. Of the exposition hitherto made, it seems. that the greatest difficulty with experiments in the open field is to get a homogeneous soil on both the experimental and control fields. But that is not all. The fields must also be uniformly lighted by the sun. The shadow of a tree can be of great consequence if it falls unequally on both fields, and: that circumstance will be more effective in the case of a summer with, in general, bad weather. The summer of"},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"14. ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE 1888 was exceptionally bad, and fatal to the experiments on a number of plants, because the field on which they were carried out was not suitable in many cases. It has, therefore, been necessary to exclude a number of doubtful results ; but for further details we must refer to a more complete publication, “Expériences sur l’Influence de l’Elec- tricité sur les Végétaux.”* Here we give only the results which were certain and of consequence for our purpose. The plants which were objects of suitable experiments were :— In the garden: Raspberries, peas, onions, carrots and cabbage. In the field: Wheat, oats, maize, red beets and white beets. The results gave an augmentation in the following pro- portions :-— WiKGd tric. cuea aa ete An eas eel about 21°2 per cent.

On the experimental field were 315 plants, and on the control field 392 plants. The experi- ments began April 18, 1888, and were continued day and: night. On the plants were, at the beginning, only leaves, but on April 29 appeared the first flowers on the experi- mental field,and eight days later on the control field. During this interval of 19 days there were four days of rain, and, as the machines are not effective under conditions of rain and moisture, the time of active action was reduced to 15 days. The development of the flowers on the experimental field was, therefore, twice as rapid as on the control field, and the plants of the former field possessed an appearance of much greater activity than the latter. This state of things * See Note on page 12."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 15 continued to May 18, but then followed eight days with a burning sun and warmth exceptional even for Burgundy. From this time the plants on the experimental field began to languish, and the berries gathered between June 7 and 21 gave— Experimental field............ 8065 kg. or 157g. from one plant Control ae inn ekpeknas 7245 kg. or 185 ¢. 5 or 15'r per cent. less from the experimental field. A difference in quality was also noticeable, the berries. from the control field being fresher and more fragrant, those from the experimental field sweeter. It was evident that the electricity had damaged the plants. Rightly to esti- mate the damage, the number of fruits was counted to- be on the average 16 on every plant on the experimental field, but only eight on the control field ; the fecundity had been twice as great on the experimental field. The cause of this unexpected change in the develop- ment must be sought in the electric current, and the con- sequence is that the quantity of this agent must be lessened in times of burning sun. But it will be seen that. an equal watering of both fields should have altered the result in favour of the experimental field. We must, then, conclude that electricity is not so harm- less that it may be given in an unlimited quantity; the external circumstances must be carefully considered. The same damaging through the burning sun happened with maize, which, in the beginning of May, showed an evident. greater activity.on the experimental field than on the control field, but was found afterwards to decline. In all the series of experiments the results showed that some of the plants were not favoured by electricity. Among these were carrots, cabbage, rooted cabbage, tobacco and peas. During the experiments in Burgundy it happened that, besides the areas upon the field, there were fields of experi- ment and control both for carrots and peas in the garden.. These four small fields, being of the same size, were equally-"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"16 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICUITURE watered ; care was taken that every field should receive the same quantity of water. The result was that the carrots gave an increase of 125 per cent., and the peas (after careful estimation) 75 per cent.* -The results so far showed, therefore, that, if electricity is applied according to the above-mentioned method, favourable results were obtained equal to an increase of 40 to 80 per cent. It had, besides, been shown that elec- tricity administered at the time of strong sunshine was damaging to the development of the plants. One other ex- perience gained from these experiments is the following :— The more fertile the soil and the more vigorous the vegetation the more stimulating will the effect of the electric current prove. A number of results show this. We will compare two experiments on potatoes and red beets, the one made on the field of the Garden Society, the other on the field at Brodtorp.. The former field possessed all the properties of garden soil, the latter was little better than ordinary farm land :— Garden soil, Field, For potatoes there was an increase of 762 percent. | 24°3 per cent. For red beets _,, ‘3 65°31 307 Electricity will, in a high degree, accelerate the ripening of fruits, berries and roots, and probably develop more sugar in them. The former effect is well shown by experiments on strawberries and raspberries, the latter will be the object of further investigation.t In the greenhouse the strawberries under electrical treatment ripened in an average time of 30 days, while 24 days more, or in all 54 days, was necessary for the berries without the benefit of the electric current. The same was the case with raspberries on the open field in Brétdorp, though the difference of time was there only 17 days.

Comparing the experiments made in southern Finland and in Burgundy, we find the results in general to be the same, but the increase seems to be less in Burgundy. We must, however, remember that the weather during the summer of 1888 in Burgundy was exceptionally bad, and, considering the law of greater development in the more vigorous vegetation, we cannot assert that the fact of a less increase per cent. in southern regions is sufficiently proved. § 5. Experiments continued—After a long interval the ex- periments were resumed in 1898. Some of the questions still remained unanswered. Amongst these was the question : What time of the day is the best for applying electricity, and is the effect proportional to the time during which it is applied ? During the interval between the experiments a new type of influence machine had been constructed, with cylinders instead of plates, rotating in the opposite direction. This type of apparatus, which has since been modified again,+ came in use in the summer of 1898, when the experiments were carried out at Villa Kammio, near Helsingfors, where Dr. W. Lybeck had kindly given a piece of land in his garden and a room for the machine. In these experiments the soil for the experimental field, as well as for the control field, was divided into two parts, whereby its properties were equalised. The machine was in motion from 5 a.m. to 9 a.m., and from 4 p.m. to 8 p.m., or about eight hours daily. The experiments began on June 17th, and by the middle of July tobacco plants on the experimental field showed so evident a superiority that photographs of both fields were taken, one of the experimental field and one of the control * See result of the analysis on page 47. t+ See Fig. 5, page 21. c wan,"},{"pageNumber":30,"pageContent":"18 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE ‘field. Two of these photographs are represented in Figs. I and 2 on the opposite page. The machine had been at work for 164 hours when the photographs were taken. The difference between the experimental and control fields was estimated at 40 per cent. The experiments were continued till August 24th, and the harvest gave: From the experimental field 16 plants weighing 18 kg. 45 control LO. 55 35 13 kg. or nearly 39 per cent. better result on the experimental field. The fields were situated on gently sloping ground, and- were divided into two sections, an upper and a dower one, of which the upper was watered with 50 per cent. more water than the lower. The results were: Carrots an increase of 8°7 per cent. White Beets _,, Iz yy Beans 43 ite 4, Of the carrots, the upper and more watered field showed the above increase; of the beets, on the contrary, the lower or less watered. The remaining fields showed nearly the same result. The short time (only eight hours daily) during which the machine was in motion exercised a con- siderable influence on the results. We must here call attention to a singular circumstance. concerning these experiments., It seems that the tobacco plants had by middle July, or during the time I could personally survey the experiments, already given, approxi- mately, the surplus that was attained in the final result. Therefore, it appears as if the electricity had no increased effect over the interval of more than a month during which the experiments were continued. This strange cir- cumstance gives rise to the supposition that a defect, not seen by the person in charge, belongs to these experiments. I suppose that the machine had been running uncharged during the greater part of this time without this fact being observed. I was myself on a journey."},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"[gt asrg aovnfo7] “PPL jouuog—'e O14 “ppayy Teweuredxy—'r “S1-J \\"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE, 19 §6. The following year, in the summer of 1899, the experiments were again removed to Brédtorp, where Baron E. Hisinger, with his usual benevolence and never-failing interest, gave us some land and caused the necessary work for the culture of the plants to be continued. As stated above,the greatest difficulty in such experiments, when a comparison between the harvest from two fields had to be made, lies in obtaining homogeneous soil—that is, a soil which fully possesses the same qualities of fertility. As this is dependent not only on the elements of which it is com- posed, but also on the depth of cultivation and humidity of the soil, the choosing of the land is very difficult. In order to overcome these difficulties, at least to a certain degree, the following method was introduced.

There remained this year, therefore, only barley, oats, peas and potatoes. One might think that all inequalities in fertility would be eliminated when the experimental squares and the corre- sponding control squares are situated in the manner shown in Fig. 4, where the squares under C are control fields and under E experimental fields; but that was not the case, for the soil represented in Fig. 3 under the last column, C,,, showed such a superiority over the soil in the columns marked C,, and E,,, that the given results would, without observing this fact, be erroneous. To obtain a reliable result, it will, therefore, be necessary to graduate the soil according to its fertility. If to all the squares under E,, the value 1 is given, the squares under C,,, must be put =1°4, and the squares under C,, =0'8. The harvest from the squares under C,,, must be divided by 1°4, and under C,, by o°8. In this way we shall attain, not the reality, but a minimum of increase. By this, graduation we had a good proportion of oats growth in the fields which lay between C,, and E,, and between E,, and C,,, ; the growth in the latter was at least twice the former. The new influence machine was used on these experiments (see Fig. 5), with cylinders of about 30 cm. in diameter and 40 cm. in length.

The beans, for instance, were destroyed by night frosts. When, in considering these experiments, we take into account the imperfect cultivation of the soil and the late sowing, they show, in general, the same results as during the previous years’ experiments. The decreasing tendency of cabbage and peas has been observed before, and shows only that the watering has been too little, which was the case at the beginning of the experiment during the month of June. The experiments made in the year 1899 might, in general, be regarded as a preparation for the following year, 1900. As the growth was under the average, the consequence must be a low increase per cent., according to the law stated above. This had really been the case. Remember- ing that the electricity was applied only during 6°5 hours daily, we must regard the results as satisfactory. §7. The experiments were continued during the year 1900, and were chiefly undertaken for the purpose of finding out the effect that electricity exercises during the night. ' As the wheat and rye were this year observed with special attention from the sowing onwards, we will devote to them a separate description. From 1899 there were in the fields gooseberries, currants, strawberries and clover, which, like the other squares, were manured.

In general this length is very variable, as will be seen from the above. The spark-length is the measure of the potential to which the wire net can be charged, and depends on external meteorological conditions, the most significant of which is the humidity of the air. The faster the elec- tricity is streaming out from the wire net the lower is the potential to which the wire net can be loaded by means of a machine of given strength.

This resistance is, in general, greater in the day, the air being drier, than at night, when the air is more humid. The electrical air-current which goes from the wire net through the plant is, therefore, different during the day than during the night. The plants show in their life cycle essential inequalities during the day and the night. It is for this reason that the electrical treatment was in 1900 restricted to the night hours. \\ Barley.

The oat fields showed this year such great inequality that no sure results were to be expected from them. They were situated a little higher on the squares where the carrots were planted in 1899. This inequality was due to an old ditch, which some ten years previously had been filled. This ditch went through two of the experimental squares, and lowered their fertility in such a remarkable way that comparing them with the other squares with a prospect of sure results was out of the question. My opinion is, how- ever, as I had an opportunity of following the whole development during the summer, that the electricity exer- cised so great an influence that the effect of it was about the same as on the barley above. | Peas.

Comparing the results for both the years 1899 and 1900, they appear to be alike for barley and oats, or an increase of 25 to 30 per cent.; for peas the decrease of 7 per cent. has grown to an increase of 55:7 per cent.; and for carrots from 37°5 to 92°7 per.cent. In general, the per- centage of increase was greater during the summer of 1900. During the summer of 1899 the machine was at work, on an average, for 6'5 hours dazly; during the summer of 1900, principally during ¢he night, for to hours. The longer time during which the machine was at work in the latter summer will suffice to explain the higher increase, so we cannot conclude from these results whether day or night is more favourable for the electrical treatment. When all the results received are taken into considera- tion, the increase appears greater if the application of electricity is continued by day and night. So we seem entitled to suppose that there is a certain dependence between the percentage of increase and the period during which electrical treatment takes place ; but any declaration that they are proportional to each other cannot be made from the experiments hitherto carried out. As above ‘mentioned, the electric current which goes from the wire net through the plants to the earth is different during the day and the night: during the day, high potential and great resistance; during the night, low potential and little resistance. It must be understood that we here take normal conditions for granted—that is to say, clear days and clear nights. During moist weather the potential is low, and in case of rain the machine can be continued at work only when a nearly constant spark is going on in a gap (Imm.) of the circuits to the earth. This was not applied in the above-mentioned experiments, but the machine was stopped. It might now happen that the changes in the potential and the resistance were such that the intensity of the current was constant, or nearly so; but upon this point our"},{"pageNumber":49,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 33 knowledge is at present very inadequate. Most probably the intensity in question is very variable. Hence it seems that this relation between the increase per cent. and the period during which the electrical air-current exercises its effects is also a variable quantity, and that the effect of the electric air-current is different under different exterior con- ditions. This must be taken into consideration in judging the amount of the increase percentage. As mentioned above, the greatest difficulty in determining this percentage of increase lies in the want of uniformity in the soil. An augmentation of the number of squares might perhaps lead to an equalising of the difference .in the average fertility of the soil; but this will lead to another difficulty—namely, that which consists in making out the many squares. Much skill and foresight are neces- sary to avoid confusion. As will be seen from the experiments previously des- cribed, there were for rye and wheat 12 squares (six for each). It would have been necessary to prepare each square separately in order to attain positive results. That mis- takes might happen here is easy to comprehend, and some have really happened; but they were so apparent that they could be immediately corrected. To prepare the whole soil beforehand would obviously have been too costly. A relatively satisfactory result could certainly be obtained in the following way :—Two squares of 3 m. (10°8 sq. ft.) are prepared with the soil from the field in which the elec- trical treatrnent is to be applied. They must lie at least 5 m. from this field and from each other. The soil on both the squares must be well mixed and put out in equal quanti- ties in every square. One is put under the same electric treatment as the field. If care is taken that the sunshine and the rain will reach both the squares in the same pro- portions, comparable results can be obtained. The increase per cent. for the whole field can then be calculated. D"},{"pageNumber":50,"pageContent":"34 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE The experiments in the summer of 1903, particularly at Atvidaberg, Sweden, showed it to be necessary to im- prove the method of control, as the constitution of the soil will have a marked influence, especially in rainy summers. Besides the above-described method it should have a wholly artificial addition of well-mixed earth put into two boxes, Im’. in surface and 4m. in depth, the sowing to be as equal as possible in number and at the same depth. One of the boxes should be placed under the electric air-current and the other 1om. apart from the field under the same current. The growth in these boxes will show the effect of this current, and also provide the means to judge if the fields have been of equal fertility. In connection with these experiments, it is to me an agreeable duty to express my best thanks to Baron E. Hisinger for the warm interest he has taken in the work and for the real support he has given it. HOW DOES ELECTRICITY EXERCISE ITS INFLUENCE ON THE, PLANTS? §10. During the summer of 1898 some experiments at the Physical Laboratory of the University of Helsingfors were performed regarding the state of liquids in capillary tubes under the influence of the electrical air-current. These experiments were continued in the spring of 1900 by myself, assisted by a student (R. Bengelsdorff), and in the’ autumn and winter of 1901 with the aid of another student (V. J. Laine). The most important of these results may here be cited.* If a capillary tube is lowered into a glass of water united electrically with the earth, and a fine metal point, in con- ducting connection with the xegative pole of an influence * See the Author, ‘‘ On the State of Liquids in Capillary Tubes under Influence of Electrical Air-Currents,” O/versigt af Finska Wet.

AND HORTICULTURE, 35 machine, is placed above the capillary tube, when the machine is started water-drops will appear after some seconds in the upper part of the tube. It is assumed that the inner surface of the tube has been moistened just before, and that the positive pole of the machine is united with the earth. The water climbs up the walls of the tube and forms one or more drops or small water cylinders. The quantity of water which in such a way ascends in the tube is proportional to the square of the distance of the point from the meniscus of the water pillar in the tube, and is ‘dependent upon the length and diameter of the tube and the resistance in the circuit. The positive pole exercises no influence, so that this effect is produced by the current from the earth through the liquid in the capillary tube to the point. When the connection with the earth is removed, all effect ceases. Hence it follows that an electric current is produced by which the liquid is drawn up in the positive direction. , The application of this phenomenon on the method used in our experiments on growing plants is as follows :—The electric current produced by the influence machine when its positive pole is earthed goes from the earth through the plants to the points of the insulated wire net and back to the negative pole. This causes an ascent of liquid or juice in the capillary tubes of the plants, and produces in such a way an augmentation of the energy with which the circulation of the juices ts going on. During the experiments made hitherto the insulated wire net had been united with the positive pole of the influence machine, and had thus been made positive; in analogy with Nature itself, where the potential of the air is ordinarily positive. A thorough investigation of the influence machine resulted in detecting the following pecu- liarity, not before observed by me: As the machine, pro- vided with Leyden jars at both poles and with the one pole earthed, is stopped, after having been again moved and set D2"},{"pageNumber":52,"pageContent":"36 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE in movement afresh there will occur a change of poles. This change easily escapes the attention of the observer. Such a change of pole might, therefore, have occurred during the experiment by which the wire net had been charged alternately positively and negatively. For this reason it was very important to make a series of experiments in which strict control over the direction of the current was exercised. The experiments were executed in the same way as the experiments mentioned on pages 9 and 10, with, however, a few modifications, Sixteen burnt clay pots of middle size (19 cm. in diameter at the upper side, 14cm. in diameter at the bottom, and 19cm. in height) were placed before the windows, four in number, facing south. The pots were placed four in a line before the window. The earth in these pots had been well mixed in a box and distri- buted alike in all the pots. In each of 12 pots out of the 16 was sown, on May 18th, I901, 12 grains of wheat, the same of oats and barley—two grains in the middle, and in five symmetrically situated places also two grains. In the four remaining pots were set strawberry plants in the middle, and around them in three places were sown carrots. The pots were placed in four sections, one before each window, so as to stand in a row—the pot with the strawberries and carrots inside, then the pot with wheat, and last that with oats and barley. Every section was separated from the other by screens of white paste- board, and care was taken that the light was the same for all. Above the three first sections (I., II., III.) was suspended by a thread of silk a wire net furnished with points 25 cm. broad and 120cm. long, at a height of 40cm. above the earth in the pots. Through the holes in the bottom of the’ pots were introduced equal-sized strips of zinc which were in conducting communication with each other and with the earth in every section. The pots stood on plates of burnt clay, and these on plates of thick glass supported"},{"pageNumber":53,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE, 37 by small pieces of ebonite. In Section IV., which ought to serve as control, the pots with their plates stood on the same kind of insulating layer, but with no zinc strips beneath nor wire net above. After having found a new way to determine the situation of the poles at the influence machine, we could easily con- trol this each time the machine was set in motion. When the machine is allowed to work without Leyden jars, and its poles are at a distance of 1°5’cm, a stream of light can be observed between the poles. This fine light is violet at the negative pole, ending with a bright point on .the surface of the sphere ; but it is white and very bright at the positive pole. The change of colour in the light-current does not take place in the middle, but is nearer to the positive pole. The influence machine used ‘on this occasion was of the new type, with small cylinders (15 cm. diameter and 20 cm. in length), and enclosed in a glass box, in which was placed a little plate with sulphuric acid for the drying of the air The machine was set in motion by an electrodynamic motor, into which was led a current of from five to six Daniel elements. The negative pole of the machine was placed in connection : ‘In Section I., with the zinc strips underneath the pots, the wire net of the same section being led off to earth ; In Section II., with the wire net above the pots, the zinc strips of this section being led off to earth ; In Section III, with.a commutator of ebonite (lying on a plate of glass) through which a leading con- nection could be produced, one day with the zinc strips and the other day with the wire net, in the same section.

Watering was done every day in measured quantities. For the first two weeks Section II., or the section in which the current went from the plants to the wire net, showed the highest development; but from this time Section I., where the current went in the opposite direction, began to take the ascendency, and kept it till August 13th, when the experi- ments ceased. This refers only to the barley, oats and wheat. On July 1oth appeared the first ear of oats in Section IIL, on July 14th in Section II., and on July 16th in Section I. On July 23rd the brush of a barley-ear began to appear in Section I., and on July 25th in Section II. The wheat could not, however, be brought to form ears. This proved generally that these kinds of cereal could not be brought to a normal condition of development in the prevailing high temperature, and so the experiments ceased, as I have said, on August 13th. But the development of the strawberry plants went on normally, except in Section I., where the plant died, pro- bably from the strong effect of the current.

Consequently, it is not only by a mechanical updrawing from the root of the water and dissolved matter within it that the electric circuit operates; it aids the development more powerfully when it goes in the opposite direction. The question therefore arises: Is the positive current able to exercise a mechanical effect on the plants? With- out doubt; for it is known that when a cut branch from a leafy tree is put into water upside down, it can suck up the water and keep living a long time; and it is the same with plants. The positive current introduces into the plants the different elements or compounds of the air, besides oxygen and nitrogen—water, carbonic acid, ozone and nitric acids, ammonia, &c.* A portion of these compounds is formed * Experiments executed in the laboratory of physics at the University of Helsingfors show that the electric current which is going out from the points forms the followirg chemical compounds, the nature of which has been deter- mined by chemical analysis : Ozone (2 great guaitztzes), nitric acids, nitrous acid, ammonia (doubtful)."},{"pageNumber":58,"pageContent":"40 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE by the passage of the electricity from the points into the air, and the current introduces them in a fresh condition into the capillary tubes of the plant. In this way the effect of the electric air-current can be reduced to a purely mechanical one. We do not maintain that any other effects than the mechanical may not occur ; but our experience does not go so far that we can say anything with certainty on this point. The effects of the two currents can be determined in the following way :— The negative current going from the earth to the plants facilitates the drawing-up of water with the dissolved matter through the roots of the plant to its capillary tubes, and thus produces a stronger circulation of the saps.. The positive current brings to the plants the different elements, and introduces them through the openings in their capillary tubes in such a way as to promote vegetation. This latter effect is, as mentioned ‘above, very much more effective than the former. In the above-related experiments the effects were pro- duced by an artificial electric air-current ; but, as also men- tioned above, a continual electric current is going upwards or downwards, certainly in the polar regions and in our latitudes, but probably everywhere ; and this current must evidently exercise a greater or lesser influence on the life of vegetables in the way we have endeavoured to show. Electricity takes a much larger part in the life of vege- tables than it has been presumed to do till now. The amount or value of this influence cannot be determined without examining more exactly the electric currents of the atmosphere. The methods used at present for this pur- pose cannot lead to this knowledge. New methods must -be introduced, and this question will be one of the most — significant in the scientific programme of the future. We cannot say that the question regarding the influence of the artificially produced electric air-currents has reached"},{"pageNumber":59,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 4I its solution; but the experiments have led to an admissible explanation, founded on facts, showing the way in which this influence is exercised. They have also effected some advance in our knowledge, which has not yet attained the necessary degree of exactness, but which possesses some importance both to science and to the practical application of our scientific knowledge. We may therefore summarise our present knowledge as follows :— (a) The real increase per cent. due to electrical treat- ment has not yet been exactly determined for the different vegetables which have been under experiment. But we are approaching its smallest value in fixing it at 45 per cent. for land of average fertility. (4) The better and more scientifically a field is cultivated and manured, the greater is the increase per cent. On poor soil it is so small as to be scarcely perceptible. (c) Some vegetables cannot endure the electrical treat- ment if they are not watered, but then they will give very high percentage increases. Among these are peas, carrots and cabbage. (@) Electrical treatment when accompanied by hot sun- shine is damaging to most vegetables, probably to all; wherefore, if favourable results are aimed at, the treatment must be interrupted in the middle of hot and sunny days. (e) As it is very difficult to determine the’ effect of electricity on most plants, a special arrangement must be made to get an approximate determination of the increase. In this connection we have already set out (page 33) what must be done in order to avoid the uncertainty which arises from the want of homogeneousness in the soil. Since the preceding part of this book was written, the following experiments have been carried out during the summers of 1902 and 1903 :— In all the experiments mentioned hereafter, the new type of influence machine, described on page 21 (see Fig. 5),"},{"pageNumber":60,"pageContent":"42 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE and the new insulators were employed.

After a long correspondence with Mr. Hogarth, of Kirkcaldy, I was induced to erect an installation for experiments to be made at Durham College of Science. After having corresponded with Mr. R. B. Greig, I got the conditions for my experiments settled, and it was determined that they should begin as early as possible. As a matter of fact, they could not begin before May 24th, 1902, after all plants had been sown. This work was com- pleted on May 22nd. The machine employed was driven by an electromotor. Our intention was to put under experiment the following plants:—Barley, oats, sugar-beets, mangolds, potatoes, beans, carrots, turnips, swedes, clover, rye grass and strawberries. After the electric current had been applied some days (from May 24th to June 2nd) it could be seen on nearly all plants that germination and vegetation were much better on the experimental fields than on the control fields. Espe- cially was this. the case with strawberries, and the barley showed a much richer development under current than without it. But after the commencement of June the bad weather—the rain and the low temperature—began to exercise their strongest influence. The following meteorological observations, taken at Cockle Park, Morpeth, may be set out to give a true idea of the weather during the summer of 1902 :— Average No. of Hours of No. of days hours machine Sunshine. without rain, in motion.

But from another cause—viz., that the machine has none or little effect shortly before, during, and shortly after rain, a lowered result must be the consequence. From the majority of plants no harvest could be obtained, because they had not sufficient time to ripen ; others were destroyed by insects, and so on.

The machine worked on an area of 100 m?. It is shown by this table that turnips, rape, peas, rye grass and clover have been improved by the watering, but not so sugar-beets, mangels, potatoes and strawberries, on all of which watering had a marked deleterious influence. Espe- cially was this the case with strawberries, the experimental plot of which had suffered much from the rain in the summer of 1902. On the unwatered control plot the harvest of strawberries was, to July 20th, 11°870z.; on the unwatered electrified plot, on the contrary, 18:250z., which shows ‘the earlier ripening of the fruits on the electrified plot. Remarks—In considering the results of these experi- ments it must be kept in mind that the control field had not been manured within the last four years, while the field in which were the experimental plots had not been manured during the last five years, or a year earlier. The experi- mental plots also lie about 0-3 m. lower than the control plots, and, therefore, may have lost more by washing during the rainy season of 1902 than the higher lying plots. The remainder of the active force of the soil, which evidently existed chiefly at the bottom, was therefore carried away in a higher degree from the experimental than from the control fields. The soil on these fields was mixed in the spring of 1903, but as this could not reach the bottom itself the experimental squares were in a more unfavour- able position than the control squares. The whole field should have been manured in order to produce the best result from the electrical treatment, but the manuring was omitted in order to prevent inequality in the sub-soil.

Therefore it seems to serve a practical purpose to divide the plants which were under treatment"},{"pageNumber":67,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE, 49 into two groups. In the first group come corn, rye, barley, oats and meslin, and in the second group the root crops—potatoes, sugar beets, carrots and beets. The former were reaped in the month of August (oats the 14th September), the latter in the first week of October, except the potatoes, which were reaped in the middle of September. The most important time of development comes, for the former in the months of June, July and August, for the latter in July, August and September. The machine worked very well during the months of May, June and July; but during August and September together for not more than 22 days out of 61, of which 17 days were during August and only five days during September. These circumstances appear clearly from the tabulated results. ; For each kind of plants three squares of 16 m?, situate as shown in Fig. 4 (middle part), page 20, were chosen for the experimental field, and three squares situated in the same way for the control field, within a distance of about 5m, In each pair of squares (except for the rye, which was autumn corn) the earth from both fields was dug to a depth of 30cm., mixed, and laid out afresh in equal quantity on each square. The machine acted upon an area of 4'03 hectares, and the large extension of the wire net in these experiments will give them a particular interest. . The First Group—Corn. From Atvidaberg I got samples of all species of corn which had been under electrical treatment. There were two samples for each species, one taken from the harvest on the experimental field, the other from the harvest on the control field.

The operation was as follows: The corn from the control field was at first separated, the threads of the spiral having been disposed of at a convenient distance from each other. Then the corn from the experimental field was separated, the distance between the threads of the spiral being the same. Rye.

BALECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE The harvest of oats shows the singularity that the harvest of straw is the same on both fields, although there is an increase of crop of 16:0 per cent. For the other species of corn the increase of crop is accompanied more or less by an increase in straw. The explanation partly lies in the improvement of the crop which the electric air current had caused (the percentage of first quality on the experi- mental field exceeding that on the control field by 8°6%, and also the weight of 1,000 grains on the former field over that of 1,000 grains on the latter by 0'75 g.); but this does not seem sufficient to explain the above-mentioned singularity. We must therefore suppose. that the number of grains of oats on each straw has been greater on the experimental field. A fault in the drainage of this field was observed during the summer, which had reduced the fertility of the field, and thus a falling off of the increase per cent. Meslin. This consisted of barley and oats, and occupied the greatest part of the field, or 2°52 hectares (=5'06 acres). It was observed that the net over this field became from time to time in contact with the plants, and had to be carefully looked after in this respect. During these inter- ruptions the current was stopped ; thus the current acted for a shorter time on this field. Another cause of the shortening of time was that the net was twice destroyed by straying horses. On the first occasion the damage was repaired in nine days, so that the current was not opera- ting upon this field from May 31st to June 11th (in all twelve days, of which three days was from another cause). The second time there was no current from June 29th. to July 1st. For the meslin there were two experimental fields and ' two control fields, of the same size and quality as for."},{"pageNumber":71,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE, 53 barley and oats; and again, on these fields the soil was mixed.

Oats, which, when cultivated alone, show so important an improvement as 86 per cent. increase in first quality and 0°75 g. in the weight of 1,000 grains, show, when cultivated along with barley, under electrical treat- ment, no such improvement, which is a most remarkable result. Probably the cause is that the barley was grown taller than the oats, and thus received more of the electric current. The whole quantity of oats is, nevertheless, increased in the same proportion as the barley. These two second experimental and control fields give a negative result of —7°5 per cent. in crop, but 11°2 per cent. surplus in straw. The cause of this lies in the exceptionally large harvest which the second control field has given, this surpassing the harvest from the first control field by 688 kg., or about 38 per cent., and the yearly average harvest of meslin, which during the last three years had been 2,047 kg. per hectare, by 453 kg., or 221 per cent.

Already at these experiments, which embrace only four different cornfields, accidental circumstances have, in two cases, diminished the increase per cent. or have trans- formed this into a minus quantity. In the first case it was a fault in the drainage, in the second case an unusually great fertility of a control field. And this notwithstanding the previous careful mixing of the soil. Unfortunately, the quality of the subsoil seems to be of such great consequence to the success of the experiments that this method has not been a sufficient safeguard. It will therefore be necessary to improve the method to ensure a regular increase per cent. (see pages 33 and 37), If all circumstances are taken into consideration we must conclude that the increase per cent. during 1903 has been between 35 and 40 per cent. for the corn crop, added to the improved quality of the corn, shown not only by the Tables above, but especially by the chemical analysis of the crops (pape 60).

The increase percentages are small for potatoes as well as for sugar beets, and it comes near the fact to suspect the cause to be a greater fertility of the control fields, in analogy with the second experimental and control fields in the case of the meslin. It is known with certainty that, on the mixing of the soil, the subsoil of the fields showed very different constituents. In favour of this view also there is the negative result with the fodder beets, which always previously have given a fairly high increase per cent. If the fertility of the two fields had been the same, and if the electric air-current had had no effect, the harvest ought to have been the same from both fields, but the negative result shows a smaller fertility of the soil of the experi- mental field. Carrots, which have always been a delicate crop, cannot here serve as a proof. At all events, the summer was so wet in the latter half of August and the earlier part of September that the condition of the subsoil had a marked influence on the fertility of the soil. That the electric current had exercised an influence on the roots during a long period, and ought thus to have produced a higher increase per cent., if both fields had been of an equal fertility, is shown by the great increase of the percentage of sugar in the sugar beets, for such a condition is not produced suddenly. The chief cause, however, of the low ncrease per cent. lies in the circumstance that the influence machine from ist August to 15th September had not been at work for more than 22 days, hence there were 23 days of inactivity. From 15th September to 8th October, or 23 days further, the machine was out of use owing to a misunderstanding of the skilled manager in Atvidaberg, Mr. Tillberg, who, with never-failing interest, exercised the supervision and direction of these experiments. He reported on the 15th September"},{"pageNumber":75,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE, 57 that, because only sugar beets, fodder beets and carrots were unripened, he did not think it worth while to let the machine work. There were in all 46 days of inactivity, among them 15 rainy days, during which it was indifferent whether the machine worked or not. Altogether, therefore, we have 38 days when the machine was out of use. There was a further eight days of inactivity, three being in con- sequence of necessary repairs and three days because of great conducting power of the air due to its humidity. During two of the eight days this humidity of the atmos- phere caused another difficulty, due to radzo-activity. This quality of the air was discovered by Elster and Geitel in 1902-1903, and acts chiefly in such a manner that the air has a great conducting power for electricity. When this condition of the air arrives the only thing to do is to wait for its cessation, which happens generally after some few ‘hours, or at most oneday. During Juneand July it occurred but three times. Mr. Tillberg tried to neutralise the effect of this radio-activity by putting new cylinders on the machine and by varnishing the old cylinders, &c. This work might have been avoided, however, for, after having ascertained conclusively that the air in the room is quite dry, and after having given the cylinders a careful drying by warming them, we can but wait for the cessation of the conducting power in the air before resuming operations. According to information from Atvidaberg, the weather during the latter part of September was not actually wet, but humid. It is, therefore, probable that the machine could have been kept in activity during 14 days more. Remembering that the effect of the electric air current is nearly the same as that of sunlight, it is very likely that a continuance of the electrical air current treatment during these two weeks would have augmented to a perceptible degree the increase per cent. of the roots. One consequence of the experiments this year is evident, namely, the necessity of improving the method of control.

(4'03 hectares), the same crop gave 40°I per cent. or 7°6 per cent. more. We must therefore conclude that the wet weather which prevailed in Atvidaberg during August and September caused this small increase of the roots, and also that a greater fertility pre- vailed there on the control fields for the same plants. This remarkable fact is also observable in the harvest of potatoes. In Kryschanowitz there was 7°6 per cent., and in Atvidaberg 4°8 per cent. ; but at Durham College, where the machine worked on an area of only 100 m?, the increase was 65°5 percent. The machine at Kryschanowitz had a speed of 3°5 turns per second, at Atvidaberg 2°5 turns, and at Durham College about 1’o turns ; the quantity of electricity generated, and therefore distributed, is almost proportional to the number of turns per second. The main cause contributing to this unequal result is, without doubt, to be found in the inequality of the soil of the experimental and control fields, and therefore it is"},{"pageNumber":77,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 59 necessary to improve the method of controlling, as previously stated. If all the above enumerated conditions had been duly attended to during the experiments, it is very probable that the increase per cent. for the roots would have been about the same as for the crops, in addition to the improve- ment in the quality of the roots.

I am all the more grateful to Baron Adelsvard, as he gave me a conscientious and active assistant in the person of his skilled and interested manager, Mr. Knut Tillberg, who carried out and supervised in an able manner the experiments, and also provided me with all necessary workmen for my purpose."},{"pageNumber":78,"pageContent":"ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE 60 ok . iy *ypuem AqrT ‘sx Aydosorryd jo arep “Ipuvo Aq (TJ9puRy any ‘forg jo uoToa1p ay} z9put) ‘sIojSurs[ 7] ye Axoyeroqey] omoucsg oinynousy 94} ut epeut sem sishyeue saoqe sy], Jo} pue “yua0 rad zi ye Aayreq 10} ¢ ‘uso rad oz 1@ uayze} oq, uo quauiaaordurt sty} oft 10g *yuaa Jad ZI 0} OI 18 syeo ‘ju9}xo S[qereprsuco & 0} Ayenb ut pesordum ueaq pet yuauryeaq} [eotAjoaJa ay} Aapun sdoso [TW ‘peonposd sem ‘yus0 sed g.€ ATUO Jo uaUINTe Jo asvarOUT Ue UT[SeW 94} Wor poyeredas s}eo ay} UI seaIayM ! uadoI}U s]qNsasIp sy} Ur *JuVo Jad gg Jo pus ‘uouING]e oY} UT “Judd Aad 1.9 Jo ‘10}]eUI plajoad Jo ‘yuad Jad z.h Jo aseasoul ue peonpoad sey yt ‘ArexyU00 aq} uo ‘s}eo ay} Uy Ire o1W9979 oy) Aapreq ay} UT ‘yuao sad zr uasomtu jo Ayuenb [e}0} ayy ut “yuo Jad %.z1 Jo asvaroul ue Ja}}eM plojoid Mei oy} ut paonpoad AqUO UaIIMD *yuao rad 1.12 Jo uasorjIU s[qusesip ay} ut pue ‘yus0 rad €.h1 jo uaunqye 9yy ur ‘*yvad Jad z.61 uadorU jo AWuenb Te}0} ot} ur §yus0 ad .61 jo aA1 ay} Ut 9x72 prajord ayy Jo asvaroUT Ue psonpord sey jusLIND Ire [eoLNOaTa OY} JEU} SMOT[OF It SIsATeUe sty} WOT — ok 6.5 | — 1g 0.9 | — zbr) z2S1) — Z.01 2g brsesreesees uraqoid a[qusesip-uoN — z9g| S.o6] -- 1.98] +.6g} — 9.28] o.og] — g.2g] LOL [res urajord afqnsesiq : L4agpopy snouasoaiyy fo Sz4vg OOL uj — 0.£6|) 1.46) — 1.16| o.F6]) — g.Sg] grog — g.6g} g.i6 fr uasosgtu yo AyIqusasiq — |S€1.0 |z110 | — |SS1.0 |611.0 | — |Sgz.0 |L6z.0 | — |PS1.0 | ghr.o fst utaponu a]qusesIp-uON 0.0 |z64.1 |26L.1 |SS.9 | 242.1 | 999.1 [90.0 |o99.1 | 199.1 |So.1z]6S€.1 |Shg.1 fort’ UaSomU s[qQNSESIpP [VIO g-£ |ro9.r |FeLz |€1.g |og9.r |S6L.1 Joo |668r7 |LoS.r |Sz.r1 |O6t2.2 | Lebar [oo uasoryu prourmndqyry — |1£1.0 |9g0.0 | — |zr1.0 |£60.0 | — | 190.0 | 60.0 | — |Jorr.o [giz.o Je uasomU apy 61.1-| 426.1 |vob.1 [S17 |£z6.1 | Loo.z [61.1 |S€6.1 | 956.1 [21.61 /€1S.1 [fog [oo casoIU [RIO], S uasodjziyy fo ‘ua? 4af OoI ool ooI ool ool oo oo1 COT pote sore TV TOT QI.1~—| ovo.zz | 006.11 | S1.F | obo.zi|ovS.z1} 1y.21 | 060,21 | ovz.z1] 1.624 /09F.6 Jolzarr faye prajoid mey — | £%g.99| 200.69] — |6zb.69/1g4.2o} — |zoS.4L |} QS1.LL] — |2z6.€glofhrgpicc tt yoeIXa 9a4j UABOI}IN atin SS9.11 ++6.6 as vClrv.6 ge1.11 =, ¢10.S So9.S A 6LE.z 96z.2 eee e wen eee meee ne eeseesene asolnifad — 688.5 |SS25 | — |gSes j1€gb | — |Erb.z | gtoe | — [664.2 JorS.2 foo Gey Med) joRXATO4IG — |lorv |66g.€ | — |6ELE |z1l.€ | — |oS6.2 |6L6.2 | — Jorb.2 |gzr.2 feo (yse) souRysqns [erUT yuso1ed *JUOIIND | *JUNAIND “yuao i ‘yuaqind *yuarINd *yU9d | ‘JUSTIN | “JusTING ‘Juuso \"JUdTING | \"JWaTINS ‘DOP JO} d1zJDa]9 | OLOaja | yzad | omoaJo | ojoaja J red | orjoaJa | omjoopo | sad | o1aOa]9 | o11}0079 ‘OUT | OpIsNO | JopugQ, Jasouy | apisyng | zspuy, | eSA9UT | opisinO | zapuq fasouy| aprsino | sJepug “AONVLSENS *ulysour “wy payeredas sLVO *SLVO “ATTAVG “EAT *JUSLIND [Bd11}99[9 ot]} SpIsyn Ayjuenb ay} syussordar wv arayM «—— oo1(9 —v) g 9 © pearsoer AyUeNb oy] g pue “JUAaIIND oLI}DaTa JapUN paAtedaI SBM TTY _ efnuiioy ay} sa1Fe payepNo[ed st aoueJsqns ¥v jo ‘jUa0 rad osvorOUI SYL—'aLON] ‘INGWLVAYL TVWOIMLOGTA LAOHLIM GNV HLIMA OYGEVCIALY LV SdOuDd dO SISATIVNY ‘IVOINGHD"},{"pageNumber":80,"pageContent":"G- Fic, 7.

Introduction—The principal manner in which electricity, or an electrical air current, exercises its influence on growing vegetables has been discovered to consist (1) partly in pro- ducing ozone and nitric compounds and introducing them into the capillary tubes of the plants when the current is going from the points of the wire-net to the earth (posi- tive) ; and (2) partly in drawing up the sap from the roots upwards when the current is going from the earth to the points (negative),* the former effect being about 30 per cent. greater than the latter. If we suppose that the former or positive current is applied, it will be easy to apply it for the purpose, and to give clear rules for this application. The lengthy experience I have had in these experiments enables me to give these rules, which, if they are intelligently applied, will lead to favourable results. I. The whole scheme of the experiments will be easily understood from the diagram (Fig. 7) on the opposite page. From the positive pole ¢ of the influence machine is coriducted an insulated copper wire through a hole in an ebonite disc fixed in the wall, over the posts p to the insulated wire net www over the growing plants. The negative pole ¢ is conducted to a zinc plate, z, in humid soil. Following are details of :— 1. The electric influence machine, its installation, and the motor. i 2. The experimental and control fields. 3. Putting the wire-net on the insulators and their fixing. 4. Remarks. . 5. Cost of the experiments. * See “On the State of Liquids in Capillary Tubes under the Influence of an. Electrical Air-Current.” By the Author. (Sve p. 34). ,"},{"pageNumber":82,"pageContent":"62 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE Il. The Electric Influence Machine and its Installation—As the old machines of Holtz and Wimshurst have shown, especially on prolonged use, many inconveniences, I have con- structed the type represented in Fig. 5 (facing p. 21), in which these inconveniences are, for the most part, removed. This machine consists of two cylinders of glass or ebonite, E, rotating in opposite directions, one within the other, and provided with metallic (tin) boats fixed on strips of tinfoil. Over the machine is placed a cover fitted with a drying apparatus not shown in the figure. The glass cylinders are covered with a special varnish to protect them from humidity, and the brushes are made of silver-thread, The machine is best charged if first put in rotation by some turns in the wrong direction, the outer cylinder going from the brushes of the transverse conductor against the points of the collector, and afterwards in the right direc- tion—that is to say, the outer cylinder rotating from the collector against the brushes, causing sparks to go between the separate spheres of the discharger. The spheres must be separated at least 2cm., and some sparks taken before the machine comes to full charge. In experiments on the land the machine must be installed in a dry room, preferably on an upper floor, but always some height over the soil. In this room the temperature must be kept always some degrees higher than the outside. In such places the drying apparatus referred to above is not neces- sary, but the cover must always be kept over the machine to protect it from dust. The machine charging the positive pole must be con- nected to the insulated wire net by means of insulated copper wire, and the negative pole with a plate of zinc (o'5m2.) in humid soil. The method of distinguishing the negative from the positive pole is simple. Take away the connection of the Leyden jars with the poles on the one side and also the"},{"pageNumber":83,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 63 conducting wire (to earth or the insulated wire net), and put the spheres of the discharger at a distance apart of about 15 cm. Ifthe machine is moved a stream of light is seen between the spheres, violet on the side of the negative pole, with a small bright spot on the sphere, white and very bright, on the positive side. The machine is easily made to perform this experiment. As the machine, when stopped, very frequently changes its poles, this experi- ment must always be repeated and the machine continue in motion before fixing the conducting wires. The new machine does not give so long a spark as the older one, but the quantity of electricity generated and given out is much greater. If a machine of the new type, of medium size, with glass cylinders of 40 cm. length and about 30 cm. diameter, gives 100, the Wimshurst, with plates of 45 cm. diameter, gives only 27, and in some cases only 22; while the old Holtz machine, with four plates 46 cm., gives 30. But the greatest advantage of this new type of machine is that it can be kept in motion for three months if necessary, cleaning the glass cylinders between the tin strips with a linen cloth only being necessary from time to time. After long use the glass cylinders must be thoroughly cleaned up and fitted afresh with new tin strips and boats, if necessary, and be also covered with new varnish. The Motor—Any small motor—electric, hot-air or otherwise—is suitable to do the little work required to move the machine. If an electric motor is used it can be battery-driven. Small hot-air motors are suitable for this work. The machine, 4, shown in the illustration (Fig. 7) has an output of 75th of a horse-power and costs about 48 sterling, or, say, $41. It is easily managed. The Field —It the purpose is to apply the electricity in such a way that the results can be brought clearly forward for comparing the yield on two fields, of which the one"},{"pageNumber":84,"pageContent":"64 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE is under electrical treatment (experimental field), the other serving as the control field, we have to observe the following points :— (@) CHOICE OF FIELD, The qualities of the soi] must, as far as possible, be the same throughout the whole field—of the same composition, the same humidity, the same fertility, and of about the same height over a common level. The field must, further, be in the same way exposed to the sun, so that no shadow at all (@g., from growing trees) falls upon it. We will suppose that the experiments are to be made on six kinds of plants, and we then divide the field into squares, as shown in Fig. 8.

When the experiments are made in a garden the squares can be arranged in two beds or layers, with a pathway between them. Such paths. must be made between the ranges of squares. In Fig. 8 the squares marked E,, E,, &c., represent experimental fields, and the squares marked C,, Cy, &c., the corresponding control fields. Between the two ranges of fields is left a space of 5 m., which can be sown with any sort of plant, but must be out of consideration so far as the experiment is concerned."},{"pageNumber":85,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE. 65 If we number the kinds of plants with which experi- ments are to be made, rt 2 $3 4 & © it is safest to sow them as indicated in the figure.

If there is any inequality in the soil it will, for the most part, be eliminated by the results from the three fields.* The seed must, of course, be chosen with much care, and must be as equal as possible for both kinds of fields. Fic. 9. If a general application of electricity is to be given, the posts are to be fixed as shown in Fig. 9. In this figure the round dots signify posts provided with insulators, as described below. Along these insulators the wire is carried. III. Fixing the Wire Net and Insulators—Along each range of the experimental squares posts, 25 m. in length and about 6 cm. in diameter, are rammed in the ground very firmly to a depth of } m. and at a distance apart of 14°3 m. * See the remarks made on pages 33 and 34, F"},{"pageNumber":86,"pageContent":"66 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE Every corner-post must have on the inner side (the side of the experimental field) a short stout support to resist the strain of the iron wire. The insulators (Fig. 10) have now to be firmly fixed to the posts, putting the ring around the post and drawing the screw. When the insulators are well fixed, galvanised iron wire (of 1-5 mm. diameter) is carried with a medium tension along the posts, over the porcelain bell of the insulator. The wire is put round the bell and fixed with a separate ‘short wire. Fic. 10.—4, ring ; e, ebonite tube ; z, iron bar; 9, porcelain bell; Z, post. When these conducting wires have been fixed all round the experimental field, cross-wires of about o°6 mm. diameter are laid on them from one side to the other at a distance of about 1°25 m., and in this way eight cross-wires cover 10m. This finer wire must be furnished, at I m. apart, with small points 2 cm. in length, nearly similar in appear- ance to the well-known barbed wire. The wire net, being now fully insulated from the posts, is, as stated above, connected by means of a well insulated conducting wire to the positive pole of the electric machine, the negative pole being conducted to earth by means of a"},{"pageNumber":87,"pageContent":"AND HORTICULTURE, 67 wire and a zinc plate. When the wire between the net and the machine is led through a wall it must be insulated with a round plate of ebonite (4 cm. diameter), as shown _in Fig. 7. After some sparks have been taken between the spheres of the discharger, the spheres are to be put in contact and the wires connected with cand c. Here, after the spheres are separated, the wire net is charged. To prove this the spheres of the discharger are brought to within a short distance of one another (I mm. or less), and a small spark will be seen between them, notifying that the net is charged, well insulated, and fitted for its purpose. The height of the wire net above the plants must be about 04 m. at its lowest point, and this height must be increased as the plants are growing. This raising needs to be done only once or twice, by loosening the rings of the insulators, lifting them up and again fixing them. The wire net must be carefully examined to see that it does not touch the plants, as all the electric current will be conducted away by such contact. As the electricity, if given in too large quantity, may damage the plants, especially if administered at periods of burning sunshine, it is best to apply the current on sunny days for only four hours in the morning (from 6 a.m. or 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. or II am.) and for four hours in the afternoon (from 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. or 9 p.m.). On cloudy days, however, it can be given the whole day, and even during the night when the weather is moist. During rainy days it ts useless to keep the machine in motion, because the wire net then loses its charge instantly. In very dry periods, with burning sun, it is best to interrupt the applications of the electricity, or to administer for only one or two hours a day. When the air is very moist the machine will speedily lose its charge, because the electricity is going from the wire net almost instantly. On such occasions it will be advisable"},{"pageNumber":88,"pageContent":"68 ELECTRICITY IN AGRICULTURE to put the spheres of the discharger so near that sparks are intermittently passing between them, These sparks are very small, but they will keep the machine charged; a Leyden (Lane)* jar in the conductor to earth will have the same effect. Remarks.—During the experiments with this installation attention must always be directed to the insulation of the wire net and the charging of the machine. The insulators must be carefully observed every day, because spiders make their webs over from the wire net to the posts. This web must be cleared away. When the electric machine is kept in a dry room, it will be charged at the first turns. In the summer it sometimes happens that the air in the room is colder than that outside. In this case a condensation of watery vapour begins within the machine, and its insulation is destroyed. (This has not hitherto been observed, because the older machines have never been used for continuous work, and have always been kept in an ordinary room with dry air.) The best course is, therefore, to put the machine, together with the motor, in a small room on an upper floor (about 2 square metres in area), provided with a small fireplace with the fire laid ready to be lighted, or a small heating apparatus with source of heat outside, care being taken that the tem- perature inside the room is always two or three degrees higher than that outside. The best method to observe, with regard to the supply of the electric current, is to construct, as it were, a central supply station, to branch out conductors 5 km. on all sides around it, and to sell the electricity as an ordinary article of commerce. In this way the cost of current will be ascer- tainable, and this is most desirable from all points of view. COST OF THE INSTALLATION.

As the cost of the installation does not increase in direct proportion to the area of land treated, it follows that on larger areas the profits would be greater, whereas on a very small area (1 or 2 acres) the increased crop would not pay for the application of the electric current. In the case of horticulture, however, it is an-entirely different matter. The produce has a much higher value, and the electrical treatment will always repay the cost when the area is not too small and is very intensively cultivated. In this department of agricultural work, therefore, the future for the electrical treatment of growing crops has a most promising future. . Remarks.—I\\n other countries, where the wheat prices are much higher, this process of calculation will give, generally speaking, 30 hectolitres* per hectare, or 300 hectolitres for 10 hectares. In these countries also the capital cost and maintenance charges are, speaking generally, lower than in the United Kingdom. The electrical treatment gives an increase of 45 per cent.

That the electri- cal air-current will prove of great service in orchards and on large market growing lands, by inducing earliness and rapid maturity as well as increased crops, seems to be clearly demonstrated.

It has always borne the same title, been the same size, and been published weekly. Consequently the Volumes torm a unique set of uniform appearance. In the volumes of “ THE ELEcTRICIAN” will be found the most valuable collection of original Papers and articles by nearly every leading writer on every branch of electrical engineering, science and industry besides al] Papers read before the principal Electrical Institutions throughout the world by men eminent in the Electrical Profession, and authenticated reports of the discussions thereupon. Original articles appearing in ‘‘ THe ErecrricsANn”’ are written by gentlemen having no interest whatever in particular electrical systems, and with but one object —the advancement of electrical knowledge and electro-technology generally. Many of these original series of articles have since been revised and amplified, and published in book form, These form the nucleus of the well-known ‘‘ ELECTRICIAN”’ SERIES. Much space is devoted in every weekly issue to fully illustrated, technical descriptions of the Electricity Supply Works and Electric Tramways owned by: Local Authorities and Com- panies, and in the very full record of Municipal Notes, the progress and development of Municipal Electrical Enterprise, including detailed analyses of the Accounts of Electric Lighting and Tramway Undertakings,,is given. The Municipal Notes of ‘‘THe ELgctriciAn ” are more numerous, more complete, and more up-to-date than those of any other technical or trade journal in the world, In addition to the above, ‘‘ THE ELECTRICIAN?’ contains a complete record of all the legal causes which have occupied the attention of the Courts of Justice for the past 26 years. Itis customary for ‘‘THE ELECTRICIAN’? to oad a prominent position in the Courts as an authority upon all legal questions affecting the Electrical Profession’and Industry, A regular feature in “‘ Tue ELecrrictan” has always been the verbatim reports of mectings of Electrical Companies and Corporations. - inally, ‘* THe Execrrician’’ has been of incalculable service to technical education, and has done much to make the general study of electricity the reality it has undoubtedly become, No aspirant to honour and renown in the electrical profession can hope to keep abreast of the never-ceasing stream of discoveries of new applications of electrical science to every-day com; mercial pursuits who does not diligently peruse the colums of “THe Erecrrician,” which is pre-eminently the leading electrical journal.

Ayrton—THE ELECTRIC ARC. By Mrs. Ayrton, M.LE.E, Now Ready. Very fully Illustrated. Price ras. 6d. ae u . Abstract from Author's Preface.—This book owes its origin to a series of articles published in The Electrician in 1895-6. In experimenting on the arc my aim was not so much to add « THE ELECTRICIAN ” PRINTING & PUBLISHING CO,, LTD., r, 2 and 3, Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, London, E.G."},{"pageNumber":97,"pageContent":"(°2 ) to the large number of isolated facts that had already been discovered, as to form some idea of the bearing of these upon one another, and thus to arrive at a clear conception of what takes place in each part of the arc and carbons at every moment. The attempt to correlate all the known phenomena and to bind them into one consistent whole led to the deduction of new facts, and opened up fresh questions, to be answered in their turn by new experiments. Thus the subject grew and developed into what may almost be termed a natural way. The Ga acres of other observers have been employed in two ways : (2) In confirmation of theory developed from my own experiments, and (2) as the. basis of theory for which further tests were devised. M. Blondel’s interesting and systematic researches, the admirable work of Mr. A. P. Trotter, and Prof, Ayrton’s Chicago Paper were all laid under c ontribution, and the deductions drawn from them tested by new experiments. The excellent work done by men whose names are quite unfamiliar to us in England, including Nebel, Feussner, Luggin, Granquist and Herzfeld, has been utilised, and in Chapter II, I have given short abstracts of most of the important Papers on the direct-current arc that appeared up to the end of the nineteenth century. Baines—BEGINNER’S MANUAL OF SUBMARINE CABLE TESTING AND WORKING. ByG. M. Baines. Second Edition. Cloth Bound, 7s. 6d. nett; post free, 8s. This book has been written to meet the requirements of those about to commence the study of Submarine Telegraphy. All subjects demandia attention have been brought within the scope of the volume and have been dealt with at sufficient length to enable an intelligible idea to be obtained of them. With regard to the algebraical portion of the study, all the formule have been worked out step by step, and, where convenient, have been supplemented by arithmetical equivalents. The book is divided into 18 chapters, and deals with: Batteries, Ohm’s Law, Joint Resistance, Wheatstone Bridge, Bridge Measurements, Insulation Test by Direct Deflection, Inductive Capacity, Internal Resistance of a Battery, &c., E.M.F. of a Battery, &c., Current Strength in Wheatstone Bridge, &c., Tests of Broken or Faulty Cables, and Description of Apparatus, &c, ; Beaumont—THE STEAM-ENGINE INDICATOR AND INDI- CATOR DIAGRAMS.

The object of this book is to place in the hands of students and practical men a concise guide to the objects, construction and use of the indicator,and to the interpretation of indicator diagrams. Lengthy discussion of theoretical or hypothetical matters has been avoided. The behaviour of steam and its expansion under different conditions have been treated in a simple manner so far as these questions are important to the consideration of indicator diagrams in their most usual practical applications, Bond—RATING OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING, ELECTRIC TRAMWAY AND SIMILAR UNDERTAKINGS.

Part VI.—Types of Power Stations. This work presents to consulting engineers, contractors, central-station engineers and engineering students the latest and most approved practice in the equipment and working of mechanical plant in electric power generating stations. Every part of the work has been brought completely uP to date; and especially in the matter of the costs of equipment and working the latest available informatfon has been given. The treatise deals with Steam, Gas, Oil and Hydraulic Plant and Gearing; and it deals with these severally from the three standpoints of (1) Theory, (2) Practice and (s) Costs. * “Motive Power AND GEARING FOR ELECTRICAL Macuinery”’ is a handbook of modern electrical engineering practice in all parts of the world. It offers to the reader a means of comparing the central station practice of the United Kingdom with that of America, the Colonies or other places abroad ; and it enables him to study the scientific, economic and financial principles upon which the relative suitability of various forms of practice is based, and to apply these principles to the design or working of plant for any given kind of work, whether for electrical supply or for electric traction. It is a treatise which should be in the hands of every electrical engineer throughout the world, as it constitutes the only existing treatise on the Economics of Motive Power and Gearing for Electrical Machinery. “ THE ELECTRICIAN” PRINTING & PUBLISHING CO.,, LTD., I, 2 and 3, Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, London, E.C,"},{"pageNumber":98,"pageContent":"( 3) Cooper—PRIMARY BATTERIES: THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND USE. By W.R. Cooper, M.A. Fully Illustrated. Price tes. 6d. nett. Author's Preface—Extract.—Primary Batteries form a subject from which much has been hoped, and but little realised. But even so, it cannot be said that the advance has been small; and consequently no apology is offered for the present volume, in which the somewhat scattered literature of the subject has been brought together. Recent years have seen important additions to the theory of the voltaic cell, and therefore a considerable number of pages have been devoted to this part of the subject, although it is impossible to do more than give a superficial sketch of the ,theory in a volume like the present. With regard to the practical part of the subject, this volume is not intended to be encyclopzedic in character; the object has been rather to describe those batteries which are in general use, or of particular theoretical interest. As far as possible, the Author has drawn on his personal experience, in giving practical results, which, it is hoped, will add to the usefulness of the book.. Owing to the importance of the subject, Standard Cells have been dealt with at some length. Those cells, however, which are no longer in general use are not described ; but recent work is summarised in some detail so as to give a fair idea of our knowledge up tothe present time. It has also been thought well to devote a chapter to Carbon- Consuming Cells. Very little has been written upon this subject, but it is of great interest, and possibly of great importance in the future.

Third Edition. ‘ Synopsis of Contents.—After an introductory chapter, which attempts to explain the fundamental ideas and the terminology, an account is given of the methods which are usually employed to measure the magnetic quality of metals. Examples are then quoted, showing the results of such measurements for various specimens of iron, steel, nickel and cobalt. A chapter on Magnetic Hysteresis follows, and then the distinctive features of induction by very weak and by very strong magnetic forces are separately described, with further description of experimental methods, and with additional numerical results. The influence of Temperature and the influence of Stress are next discussed. The conception of the Magnetic Circuit is then explained, and some account is given of experiments which are best elucidated by making use of this essentially modern method of treatment. Fisher—THE POTENTIOMETER AND ITS ADJUNCTS. (A Universal System of Electrical Measurement.) By W. Clark Fisher. Price 6s., post free; eros, 6s. 6d, The extended use of the Potentiometer System of Electrical Measurement will, it is hoped, be sufficient excuse for the publication of this work, which, while dealing with the main instru- ment, its construction, use and capabilities, would necessarily be incomplete without similar treatment of the various apparatus which, as adjuncts, extend the range and usefulness of the whole system. ‘he engineer or practical man demands that he shall be shown results quickly, plainly and accurately with a minimum of trouble, understanding, and consequently ‘Time,’ and on that account prefers—like all good mechanics—to have one good instrument, which, once understood and easily manipulated, can be used in a variety of ways to suit his needs. I[t is to this fact, undoubtedly, that the ‘‘ Potentiometer ” method of measurement owes its popularity. Its accuracy is rarely, if ever, impugned. Measurements made by it are universally accepted amongst engi- neers, and it might be well termed a “ universal ” instrument in “ universal” use.

In the hope that this “THE ELECTRICIAN ” PRINTING & PUBLISHING CO,, LTD., 1, 2 and 3, Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, London, E.C."},{"pageNumber":100,"pageContent":"ae ae will be found to render the book still useful to the increasing numbers of those who are practically engaged in alternating-current work, he has sought, as far as possible, to avoid academic methods and keep in touch with the necessities of the student who has to deal with the subject not as a basis for mathematical gymnastics but with the object of acquiring practicaly usefull knowledge. Dr. Fleming’s manual on the Alternate,Current Transformer in Theory and Practice is recognised as the text book on the subject.

Fleming—-THE ELECTRONIC THEORY OF ELECTRICITY. By Prof. J. A. Fleming, M.A., D.Sc., F.R.S. Price 1s. 6d. post free. Extract from the Author.—In this sketch of the Electronic Theory the author has made no attempt to present a detailed account of discoveries in their historical order, or to con- nect them especially with their authors. The object has been to show the evolution. of the idea that electricity is atomic in structure, and that thus these atoms of electricity called electrons attach themselves to material atoms and are separable from them. Lorentz, Helmholtz, Thomson and others have shown that such a conception jof atomic structure enables us to explain many electro-optic phenomena which are inexplicable on any other theory. The Electronic Theory of Electricity, which is an expansion of an idea originally due to Weber, does not invalidate the ideas which lie at the base of Maxwell’s theory that electric and magnetic effects are due to the strains and stresses in the zther, but supplements them by a new concepiian thet ot the electron or electric particle as the thing which is moved by electric force, and which, in turn, gives rise to magnetic force as it moves, All the facts of electricity and magnetism are capable of being restated in the terms of the idea. : Geipel and Kilgour—A POCKET-BOOK OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING FORMULA, &c.

It is to supply this real want that this most comprehensive book has been prepared. Compiled to some extent on thelines of other pocket-books, the rules and formulz in general use among Electricians and Electrical Engineers all over the world have been supplemented by brief and, it is hoped, clear descriptions of the various subjects treated, as well as by concise articles and hints on the construction and management of various plant and machinery. No pains have been spared in compiling the various sections,to bring the book thorough]. up to date ; and while much original matter is given, that which is not original has been caretully selected, and, where necessary, corrected. ere authorities differ, as far as practicable a mean has been taken, the different formula being quoted for guidance.

Vol. III. in preparation. ‘ Extract from Preface to Vol. 1.—This work is something approaching a connected treatise on electrical theory, though without the strict formality usually associated with a treatise. The following are some of the leading points in this volume. The first chapter is introductory. The second consists of an outline scheme of the fundamentals of electromagnetic theory from the Faraday-Maxwell point of view, with some small modifications and extensions upon Maxwell’s equations, The third chapter is devoted to vector algebra and analysis, in the form used by me in former papers. The fourth chapter is devoted to the theory of plane electromagnetic waves, and, being mainly descriptive, may perhaps be read with profit by many who are unable to tackle the mathematical theory comprehensively. I have included in the present volume the application of the theory (in duplex form) to straight wires, and also an account of the effects of self- induction and leakage, which are of some significance in present practice as well as in possible future developments. : Extract Srom Preface to Vol, 1].—From one point of view this volume consists essentially of a detailed ‘development of the mathematical hecty of the propagation of plane electro- magnetic waves in conducting dielectrics, according to Maxwell’s theory, somewhat extended. From another point of view, it is the development of the theory of the propagation of waves along wires. But on account of the important applications, ranging from Atlantic telegrapby, through ordinary telegraphy and telephony, to Hertzian waves along wires, the Author has usually preferred to express results in terms of the concrete voltage and current, rather than the specific electric and magnetic forces belonging to a single tube of flux of energy. . . . The theory of the latest kind of so-called wireless telegrapby (Lodge, Marconi, &c.) has been somewhat anticipated, since the waves sent up the vertical wire are hemispherical, with their equatorial bases on the ground or sea, which they run along in expanding. (See 360, Vol. I. ; dso $393 in this volume.) The author’s old predictions relating to skin conduction, and to the possibilities of long-distance telephony have Theeds abundantly verified in advancing practice; and his old predictions relating to the behaviour of approximately distortionless circuits have also received fair support in the quantitative observation of Hertzian waves along wires.

Although the localisation of faults in tele; rep cables has been dealt with fully in several hand-books and pocket-books, the treatment of e ty electric light and power cables has never been discussed in an equally comprehensive manner. The conditions of the problems are, however, very different in the two cases; faults in telegraph cables are seldom localised before their resistance has become low compared with the resistance of the cable itself, while in electric light work the contrary almost always obtains. This fact alone entirely changes the method of treatment required in the latter case, and it has been the Author’s endeavour, by dealing with the matter systematically, and as a separate subject, to adequately fill a gap which has hitherto existed in technical literature. The various methods of insulation Wii ee working have been collected and discussed, as these tests may be considered to belong to the subject. Raphael—WIREMAN’S POCKET-BOOK. A Manual for the Wiring Contractor, the Mains Superintendent and the Wireman. Edited by F. Charles Raphael. Price 5s. nett., post free 5s. 3d. Eprror’s Note.—When the preparation of this Pocket-Book was commenced, the original intention of its Editor was to collect in a handy and useful form such Tables, Instructions and Memoranda as would be useful to the Electric Light Wireman in his work. Thishas been carried out in Section A of the Pocket Book in its present form. During the past few years, however, many enquiries have been received for a good book of reference with regard to the laying of underground mains, and with matters connected with insulated conductors generally. It was decided, therefore, to extend greatly the area covered by the book, and to treat the whole subject of erecting and laying electrical and conducting systems in such a manner that the tables, diagrams and let‘erpress might be useful to engineers in charge of such work, as well as to the wireman, jointer, and foreman. In fact, the section on Underground work has been compiled largely with a view to meeting the requirements of Mains Superintendents, Central Station Engineers and those occupied in designing networks. In addition to the tables, instructions and other detailed information as to cables, ducts, junction boxes, &c., contained in the section on Underground Mains, it has been deemed advisable to add a chapter briefly describing the various systems employed for public distributing networks. In this, the essential practical information is alone given; two and three-phase systems are dealt with, as well as continuous current and single phase, and the method of calculating the size of the conductors and the fall of pressure from the number of lamps or horse-power of motors is made clear without the elaboration of clock-face diagrams or algebraical exercises. Diagrams for the connections of telephones are given in Section D, including those for subscribers’ instruments on the new Post Office exchange system in London ; and it is belicved that neither these diagrams nor those for bell connections have hitherto been published together in convenient peckst-Ficok form. The various conversion factors in the Miscellaneous Section and the arrangement of the wages table are those with which the Editor has himself found the most useful in practice.

The rapid spread of electrical work in collieries, mines and elsewhere has created a demand for a practical book on the subject of transmission of power. Though much had been written, “ THE ELECTRICIAN” PRINTING & PUBLISHING CO.,, LTD., I, 2 and 3, Salishury Court, Fleet Street, London, E.C,"},{"pageNumber":103,"pageContent":"(3) there was no single work dealing with the question ina sufficiently comprehensive and yet practical manner to be of real use to the mechanical or mining engineer; either the treatment was adapted for specialists, or it was fragmentary, and power work was regarded as subservient to the question of lighting.. The Author has felt the want of such a book in dealing with his clients and others, and in ‘“‘ Etecrric Motive Power” has endeavoured to supply it. In the introduction the limiting conditions and essentials of a power plant are analysed, and in the subsequent chapters the power plant is treated synthetically. The dynamo, motor, line and details are discussed both as to function and design. The various systems of Kiger | and distributing power by continuous and alternate currents are fully enlarged upon, and muc! ractical information, gathered from actual experience, is distributed under the various divisions. The last two chapters deal exhaustively with the applications of electricity to mining work in Great Britain, the Continent and America, particularly with reference to collieries and coal- getting, and the results of the extensive experience eae. in this field are embodied. n general, the Author’s aim has been to give a sound digest of the theory and practice of the electrical transmission of power, which will be of real use to the practical engineer, and to avoid controversial points which lie in the province of the specialist, and elementary proofs which properly belong to text-books on electricity and magnetism.

Soddy, M.A. Fully Illustrated, and with a full Table of Contents and extended Index. 6s. 6d. nett. Extract fiom Author's Preface.—In this book the Author has attempted to give a con. nected account of the remarkable series of investigations which have followed M. Becquerel’s discovery in 1896 of a new property of the element Uranium. The discovery of this new pro- perty of self-radiance, or “‘radio-activity,” has proved to be the beginning of a new science, in the development of which physics and chemistry have played equal parts, but which, in the course of only eight years, has achieved an independent position, . . . Radio-activity has passed from the position of a descriptive to that of a thilosophical science, and in its main generalisations must exert a profound influence on almost every other branch of knowledge. It has been recognised that there is a vast and hitherto almost unsuspected store of energy bound in, and in some way associated with, the unit of elementary matter represented by the atom of Dalton. . . . Since the relations between energy and matter constitute the ultimate ground- work of every philosophical science, the influence of these generalisations on allied branches of knowledge is a matter of extreme interest at the present time. It would scem that they must effect sooner or later important changes in astronomy and cosmology, which have been long awaited by the biologist and geologist. he object of the book has been to give to Students and those interested in all departments of science a connected account of the main arguments and chief experimental data by which the results so far attained have been achieved.
