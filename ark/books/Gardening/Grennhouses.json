The first recorded use of hotbeds and cold frames was ensuring Roman emperors had cucumbers in winter. The English greenhouse culture that is so pervasive in the United Kingdom today began on the estates of the landed gentry—aristocrats who wanted fresh citrus and pineapples without the bother of importing those delicacies. Ultimately, however, the idea of growing crops out of season or out of locality was far too appealing to be confined to the rich. Home gardeners of more modest means soon adopted simpler greenhouses so that they could have fresh vegetables all year round, or get a jump on flowers for their gardens, and that promise is still what draws home gardeners to greenhouses today. Wonder if a greenhouse would be right for you? Ask yourself a few basic questions: Are you ready to start your own flower-bed showoffs rather than buying flat after flat at the local nursery each spring? Would you like the satisfaction and flavor of growing your own super-healthy greens, fruits, and vegetables? Would you like to experiment with crops that normally would not grow in your zone, including tropical plants like orchids, avocadoes, and pineapples? If the answer to any of these is yes, it’s time to consider which greenhouse is best for you. Before taking the plunge, you’ll need to consider the many factors and options that go into setting up a greenhouse. No worries: we’ve covered all those basics in the pages that follow, leading you to choices based on what you want to grow and how you want to grow it. Fortunately, a greenhouse need not break the bank. You can find an entire spectrum of prefabricated types, from zip-up plastic covers over hutch-sized metal frames all the way up to house- sized “conservatories” that can dominate a large property. The range of available prefabricated sizes, materials, and technologies ensures that there is a greenhouse for everyone—and if you can’t find exactly what you want from a manufacturer, you can build your own. You’ll find many wonderful possibilities in the project section of this book. A greenhouse is even more productive and rewarding when coupled with features such as seed starter racks, custom workbenches, and cost-saving graywater systems. You can also supplement the bounty of the greenhouse with structures such as covered raised beds and portable cold frames that help keep plants warm and protected in garden beds. You’ll find a wealth of these “greenhouse complements” in the projects section as well. A greenhouse may seem like a luxury, because that’s exactly what it is—an everyday luxury. It is an extraordinary structure that can, if used correctly, pay for itself. A greenhouse allows you to grow exactly the ornamentals and edibles you want, rather than settling for those that you find in local nurseries and home centers. More than that, the right greenhouse in the right location is a gardener’s getaway, a tiny slice of tropical paradise that makes bitter winter cold disappear (if only for an hour or so) and provides a lush vacation spot steps from your back door."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"9 GREENHOUSES E nter a greenhouse and you’ve crossed the threshold of an extraordinary place. You’re greeted by a profusion of flowers and the rich textures of foliage. Sweet fragrances mix with the earthy smell of soil. Diffused light shines through the misty air. In the silence, you can almost hear the plants growing. Traffic rumbles by unnoticed, and the distractions of the “real” world seem miles away. Although the experience is similar from greenhouse to greenhouse, the structures themselves are amazingly diverse. They can be large and complex or small and simple. They can be unheated or heated, built of glass or covered in plastic. You’ll find greenhouses on city rooftops and tucked into suburban gardens. No two are identical, even if they’re constructed from the same kit; the contents of a greenhouse make it unique. Some house vegetables (tomatoes and cucumbers), some shelter tropicals (scheffleras and dieffenbachias), and some are home to flats of germinating begonias. This section is focused on leading you through the many variables among greenhouses. Finding the perfect structure for you and what you want to grow means making the right decisions along the way. The sections that follow will help you do that.

They can be custom designed or built from a kit, freestanding or attached, framed in metal or wood, glazed with plastic or glass. Spend a little time researching online greenhouse suppliers and you’ll discover almost unlimited options. Although it’s important to choose a design that appeals to you and complements your house and yard, you’ll need to consider many other factors when making a decision. Answering the following questions will help you determine the type, style, and size of greenhouse that suits your needs. Choosing a Greenhouse How you plan to use the greenhouse will also determine its size, type, and location. If you only want to harden off seedlings or extend the growing season for lettuce plants and geraniums, a small, unheated structure covered with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sheeting or even a cold frame—a glass- or plastic- topped box on the ground—might be all you need. If your intentions are more serious, consider a larger, more permanent building. A three-season greenhouse can be placed anywhere on your property and might even be dismantled in the winter, whereas year-round use calls for a location near the house, where utilities are convenient and you don’t have to trek a long way in inclement weather. What do you plan to grow in your greenhouse? Are you mostly interested in extending the growing season—seeding flats of bedding plants early in the spring and protecting them from frost in the fall? Or do you want to grow flowers and tropical plants year-round? Your intentions will determine whether you need a heated greenhouse. Unheated greenhouses, which depend solely on solar heat, are used primarily to advance or extend the growing season of hardy and half-hardy plants and vegetables. Although an unheated greenhouse offers some frost protection, it is useful only during spring, summer, and fall, unless you live in a warm climate. A heated greenhouse is far more versatile and allows you to grow a greater variety of plants. By installing equipment for heating, ventilation, shading, and watering, you can provide the perfect environment for tender plants that would never survive freezing weather. How Will the Greenhouse Be Used? The cost of a basic freestanding greenhouse can range from the very economical (plastic sheeting and PVC hoop frame) to the surprisingly expensive (custom- designed and built). It all depends on your tastes and aspirations, and on your budget. The following real-life samples will give you a sense of the cost variations (remember, though, that prices can vary widely, depending on features and accessories you choose to include): • A 5 × 5' pop-up mini greenhouse from one mail order source sold for around $125. • A small, 6 × 8' greenhouse with rigid polycarbonate panels sold for around $400. • A more spacious 8 × 17' rigid panel kit with motorized windows sold for around $5,000. • The most elaborate polycarbonate kit greenhouses we found, available by mail order, sold for around $7,500 for an 11 × 24' structure. • For a custom-designed and built greenhouse of the same size (11 × 24'), one homeowner recently spent $23,000—a price that could have been much higher for a greenhouse designed with ornamental metalwork or stone foundations. • A 20 × 30' hoop kit using plastic sheeting and PVC tubing was recently available for around $1,500. THE COST QUESTION"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"11 GREENHOUSES There are many different reasons to choose a given greenhouse. The owner of this yard opted for a traditional crested, aluminum- framed, glass-enclosed model. The use of clear glass instead of semiopaque plastic allows the greenhouse to be used for meals and relaxing (thus, the table) as well as growing favorite plants."},{"pageNumber":14,"pageContent":"12 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Attached to the exterior wall of the house, this lean-to-style greenhouse has all the features for complete growing success: running water (A); electrical service (B); a heated plant-propagation table (C); a heater (D) for maintaining temperatures on cold nights; ventilating windows (E) and sunshades (F) for reducing temperatures on hot days; drip irrigation system (G) for maintaining potted plants; a full-length potting bench (H) with storage space beneath; paved flooring (I) to retain solar heat. E F G B C A D H I"},{"pageNumber":15,"pageContent":"13 GREENHOUSES Greenhouse styles are divided into two main groups: attached lean-tos and freestanding. Lean-tos are attached to the house, the garage, or an outbuilding, usually on a south-facing wall. An attached greenhouse has the advantage of gaining heat from the house. It’s also conveniently close to plumbing, heating, and electrical services, which are required to operate a heated greenhouse. Lean-tos come in just as many variations as full-scale freestanding greenhouses do. This means you can find or build a lean-to that suits an end- or side-wall space and the style of your home. As with greenhouses, lean-tos can be simple enclosed structures meant to be used in three seasons or they can include vent fans, misters, heaters, and the other accessories that increase the usefulness of the structure. On the downside, lean-tos can be restricted by the home’s design. They should be built from materials that complement the existing structure, and a low-slung roofline or limited exterior wall space can make them difficult to gracefully incorporate. Siting can be tricky if the only available wall faces an undesirable direction. In cold climates, they must be protected from heavy snow sliding from the house roof. Lean-tos are typically smaller than freestanding greenhouses and can be subject to overheating if they aren’t vented properly. Standalone greenhouses can be portable or permanent. It’s wise to keep that in mind if you anticipate moving in the near future or just aren’t certain exactly where you want to fit the greenhouse into your existing landscape. A freestanding greenhouse can be sited anywhere on the property and is not restricted by the home’s design. It can be as large or as small as the yard permits. Because all four sides are glazed, it receives maximum exposure to sunlight. However, a freestanding structure is more expensive to build and heat, and depending on its size, it may require a concrete foundation. Utilities must be brought in, and it is not as convenient to access as a lean-to. Because it is more exposed to the elements, it can require sturdier framing and glazing to withstand winds. You can also secure lighter greenhouses with an anchoring system. Do I Want a Lean-to or a Freestanding Greenhouse? Heated greenhouses can be classified by three temperature categories: cool, warm, and hot. Each of these environments supports different plants and gardening activities. Cool Minimum Nighttime Temperature: 45°F (7°C) In a cool environment, you can start seeds and propagate cuttings early in the year so they will be ready for planting in garden beds at the beginning of summer. Unless your climate is mild, however, you’ll probably need a propagator to provide a little extra warmth for starting seeds. Vegetables and hardy and half-hardy plants do well in this type of greenhouse. Although the temperature in a cool greenhouse is suitable for protecting frost-tender plants, their growth during winter is minimal. Warm Minimum Nighttime Temperature: 55°F (13°C) A warm greenhouse is suitable for propagating plants, raising seedlings, and growing a wide range of plants, including flowers, fruits, houseplants, and vegetables, even during the coldest months. You can sow tomato seeds in January and harvest the ripe fruits in June. Though this type of greenhouse provides a highly desirable environment for plants, heating it can be extremely costly, especially if you live in an area with long, cold winters. Hot Minimum Nighttime Temperature: 65°F (18°C) Only a few serious gardeners will invest in a hot greenhouse because it is prohibitively expensive to heat. This type of environment is ideal for growing exotic tropical plants, such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns. HEATED GREENHOUSE ENVIRONMENTS"},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"14 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES structure. Many models are available as modules that allow additions as your enthusiasm grows. When choosing a greenhouse, take into account the size of your property. How much space will the structure consume? Most of the expense comes from operating the greenhouse, especially during winter. The larger the structure, the more expensive it is to heat. Be sure the greenhouse has enough room for you to work. Allow space for benches, shelves, tools, pots, watering cans, soil, hoses, sinks, and a pathway through the plants. If you want benches on both sides, choose a greenhouse that is at least 8 feet wide by 10 feet long. Give yourself enough headroom, and allow extra height if you are growing tall plants or plan to hang baskets. In all likelihood, you’ll shop for a greenhouse that fits the “hobby” category. Larger, estate greenhouses are categorized as “conservatories,” while much smaller greenhouses, which are usually portable, are labeled “mini.” Some experts recommend buying the largest greenhouse you can afford, but this isn’t always the best advice. You don’t want to invest in a large greenhouse only to discover that you’re not up to the work it involves. Of course, buying a greenhouse that is too small can lead to frustration if your plant collection outgrows the space. It is also much more difficult to control the temperature. One compromise is to buy a greenhouse that’s one size larger than you originally planned, or better yet, to invest in an expandable How Big Should the Greenhouse Be? Location is important. If you live in a windy area, you’ll need a sturdy structure. Buying a cheaply made greenhouse will not save you money if it fails to protect your plants or blows away in a storm. And cutting costs by using inefficient glazing will backfire because you’ll wind up paying more for heating. Your budget will influence the type of structure you choose. A simple hoop greenhouse with a plastic cover is inexpensive and easy to build. If you’re handy with tools, you can save money by buying a kit, but if the greenhouse is large, requires a concrete foundation, or is built from scratch, you may need to hire a contractor, which will add to the cost. How Much Can I Afford to Spend on a Greenhouse? Local building codes will vary from region to region, but many dictate the type, size, and location of any greenhouse that may be placed on your property. Codes may also require a certain type of glazing—for instance, they may mandate that in a structure with glass panes, only tempered glass be used. That’s why it’s essential to do a little homework before you commit to buying or building your dream greenhouse. Here are a few basic questions every homeowner should ask his or her local building department before committing to a specific greenhouse: • What type of foundation is required for a freestanding greenhouse? If compacted gravel is allowed as a foundation, how deep must the foundation go? • Is there a minimum wind load required? Are anchors required? (Anchors are necessary for lighter greenhouses in areas that are commonly affected by high winds or extreme weather events.) • What is the snow load per square foot or dead load required on the greenhouse? • Does the structure need to be code compliant with the International Building Code (IBC) or Universal Building Code (UBC)? Which year? • Do the building plans have to be site specific? • Does the greenhouse have to be Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliant? BUILDING DEPARTMENT QUESTIONS"},{"pageNumber":17,"pageContent":"15 GREENHOUSES You may have big dreams, but do you have the commitment to match? Maintaining a successful greenhouse requires work. It’s not hard labor, but your plants depend on you for survival. Although technology offers many time savers, such as automated watering and ventilation systems, there’s no point in owning a greenhouse if you don’t have time to spend there. Carefully assess your time and energy before you build. How Much Time am I Prepared to Invest in a Greenhouse? You might save money by choosing a smaller greenhouse, but if you don’t have usable room to grow everything you want to grow, you aren’t getting real value out of the structure. This beautiful redwood-framed, prefab unit may be a little pricey, but it offers abundant counter, shelf, and work-surface space as well as quality construction and glazing meant to last decades."},{"pageNumber":18,"pageContent":"16 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES W hen the first orangeries were built, heat was thought to be the most important element for successfully growing plants indoors. Most orangeries had solid roofs and walls with large windows. Once designers realized that light was more important than heat for plant growth, they began to build greenhouses from glass. All plants need at least 6 (and preferably 12) hours of light a day year-round, so when choosing a site for a greenhouse, you need to consider a number of variables. Be sure that it is clear of shadows cast by trees, hedges, fences, your house, and other buildings. Don’t forget that the shade cast by obstacles changes throughout the year. Take note of the sun’s position at various times of the year : A site that receives full sun in the spring and summer can be shaded by nearby trees when the sun is low in winter. Winter shadows are longer than those cast by the high summer sun, and during winter, sunlight is particularly important for keeping the greenhouse warm. If you are not familiar with the year-round sunlight patterns on your property, you may have to do a little geometry to figure out where shadows will fall. Your latitude will also have a bearing on the amount of sunlight available; greenhouses at northern latitudes receive fewer hours of winter sunlight than those located farther south. You may have to supplement natural light with interior lighting. To gain the most sun exposure, the greenhouse should be oriented so that its ridge runs east to west (see illustration, below), with the long sides facing north and south. A slightly southwest or southeast exposure is also acceptable, but avoid a northern exposure if you’re planning an attached greenhouse; only shade-lovers will grow there. Where to Site Your Greenhouse The ideal greenhouse location is well away from trees but protected from prevailing winds, usually by another structure, a fence, or a wall. North South West East"},{"pageNumber":19,"pageContent":"17 GREENHOUSES Access Try to locate your greenhouse as close to the house as possible. Connecting to utilities will be easier, and you’ll be glad when you’re carrying bags of soil and supplies from the car. Furthermore, a shorter walk will make checking on plants less of a chore when the weather turns ugly. Aesthetics Although you want to ensure that plants have the perfect growing environment, don’t ignore aesthetics. The greenhouse should look good in your yard. Ask yourself whether you want it to be a focal point—to draw the eye and make a statement—or to blend in with the garden. Either way, try to suit the design and the materials to your home. Keep space in mind, too, if you think you might eventually expand the greenhouse. Several factors influence the decision of where to build your greenhouse. Some pertain to your property, some to the structure, and some to your tastes. Climate, Shelter & Soil Stability Your local climate and geography have an impact on the location of your greenhouse. Choose a site that is sheltered from high winds and far enough away from trees that roots and falling branches are not a threat. (Try to position the greenhouse away from areas in which children play, too.) If you live in a windy area, consider planting a hedge or building a fence to provide a windbreak, but be careful that it doesn’t cast shade on the greenhouse. Avoid low-lying areas, which are prone to trapping cold, humid air. The site should be level and the soil stable, with good drainage. This is especially important if heavy rains are common in your climate. You might need to hire a contractor to grade your site. Siting Factors For maximum heat gain, orient your greenhouse so the roof or wall with the most surface area is as close to perpendicular to the sunrays as it can be."},{"pageNumber":20,"pageContent":"18 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES A t first glance, a greenhouse seems like a very simple structure: some basic framing, a good amount of glass or plastic, and voilà—a greenhouse. But actually, there is much more to this garden addition than meets the eye. In addition to being thoughtfully situated to take advantage of the sun throughout the day and the seasons, any greenhouse must be carefully built to last while still providing an optimal environment for the plants you want to grow. That starts with choosing the right foundation and making sure the greenhouse has an appropriate floor. Not only is the base of a greenhouse important for its support, but the right floor can also serve as a heat sink, absorbing heat during the day and releasing it at night. In addition, you’ll need to put a lot of thought into your greenhouse’s covering. Glass is traditional, but fragile and expensive. Plastic panels and sheeting are easier to work with, but you must choose the right type to create the ideal microclimate for your plants. Any plant needs water, and depending on how large your greenhouse is, you may decide to automate the watering of your plants or to use misters to create the proper humidity. You’ll also need to figure out how to moderate the heat inside, because the temperature in a greenhouse can swing by as much as 50 degrees Fahrenheit over the course of any given day. Ventilation goes hand in glove with heat, and, of course, you’ll probably want some form of lighting so that you can check on or work with your plants after dark. These are just some of the factors any greenhouse owner needs to consider and resolve. The purpose of this section is to help you make informed choices from among the great many options available in order to create the ideal space for whatever it is you hope to grow—not to mention yourself. Greenhouse Elements A greenhouse is composed of several major systems that perform important functions. When planning your greenhouse, you’ll need to make choices about each system, which include the foundation, floor, frame, glazing, ventilation, watering, heat, storage, and more."},{"pageNumber":21,"pageContent":"19 GREENHOUSES Other cases may call for a base of landscape timbers, concrete footings or piers, or a concrete slab. More traditional, substantial, and permanent greenhouses are often built on a kneewall of wood, brick, or stone. This is an option for most types of greenhouses, but the work and expense mean that kneewalls are rarely used with hobby greenhouses. Earth anchors, or anchor stakes, are often used to tie down very lightweight greenhouses and crop covers to prevent them from blowing away. A typical anchor is a long metal rod with a screw-like auger end that is driven into the ground. An eye at the top end is used for securing a cable or other type of tether attached to the greenhouse. As with a house or any substantial outbuilding, a greenhouse needs an appropriate foundation. For lightweight kits and smaller greenhouses, this may be a compacted gravel base. Larger, heavier structures will most likely require a more significant foundation to prevent movement in the underlying soil from damaging the framing or glazing. A foundation should also keep any wood or metal parts off the ground to prevent premature rot or corrosion. If you’ve purchased a kit greenhouse, the manufacturer will likely recommend appropriate foundation options. Regardless of what you’re building, you should consult your local building department to determine the codes that dictate the foundation you need to use and whether you need a permit for the foundation, the whole greenhouse, or both. Whether you’re working from codes or simply following best building practices, the foundation needs to match the greenhouse. A kit greenhouse may come with its own metal or fabric base. For many types of prefab structures, a crushed gravel base 4 inches deep or more will serve the purpose. Foundations Kneewalls, sometimes called pony walls, are low walls to which a greenhouse frame can be attached. They can raise a greenhouse to maximize headroom and can help to retain heat. However, they also eliminate growing space behind the walls and below the benches. If you only plan to grow potted plants on the benches, this may not be a problem—you can use the area underneath the benches for storage. Kneewalls can be built with concrete blocks on a concrete footing, but a more attractive option is to use stone or brick and mortar. To help integrate the greenhouse with your home, build the kneewall from materials that complement the exterior of the house. KNEEWALLS"},{"pageNumber":22,"pageContent":"20 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Concrete slabs make great foundations and a nice, cleanable floor surface but are overkill for most hobby greenhouses. In some areas, it may be permissible to use a “floating” footing that combines a floor slab with a deep footing edge (shown here). Otherwise, slabs must be poured inside of a perimeter frost footing, as with garage or basement construction. To prevent water from pooling inside the greenhouse, concrete slabs must slope toward a central floor drain—a job for a concrete pro, not to mention a plumber to install the drain and underground piping. Pier footings are structural concrete columns poured in tube forms set below the frost line—the same foundation used to support deck posts. Pier foundations are appropriate for some kit and custom greenhouses and are often used on large commercial hoop-style houses. Anchor bolts embedded in the wet concrete provide fastening points for the greenhouse base or wall members. A concrete footing provides a structural base for a large greenhouse or a masonry kneewall. Standard footings are continuous and run along the perimeter of the structure. They must extend below the frost line (the depth to which the ground can freeze in winter; varies by climate) to prevent frost heave and should be at least twice as wide as the greenhouse walls they support. Timber foundations are simple frames made with 4 × 4, 6 × 6, or larger landscape timbers. The timber frame is laid over a leveled and compacted gravel base (which can also double as the floor or floor subbase for the greenhouse interior) and pinned to the ground with rebar stakes. One level, or course, of timbers is suitable for small greenhouses, while two courses are recommended for larger structures.

Pathway gravel is the easiest and cheapest flooring to install. Pea gravel, trap rock, and some river stones are good for both drainage and cleanliness. Highly compactible materials, such as decomposed granite, remain solid and level underfoot but leave a lot of grit on your shoes (if that’s a concern). In any case, choose a material that’s comfortable to walk on; loose or large gravel or stones can be unstable. Concrete pavers set in sand offer a longlasting, stable floorcovering that breathes and allows for good drainage. from the upper layers. From there, the simplest floors can be made with any type of suitable gravel, such as pea gravel or trap rock. Brick and concrete patio pavers are other great options and offer a more finished look and feel over gravel floors. Pavers are laid over a 1- to 2-inch layer of sand and should be surrounded by a border ( foundation timbers or patio edging will suffice) to keep them from drifting. Once the pavers are set, you can sweep sand over the surface to fill the cracks and lock the units in place. Another floor option— flagstone—is installed in much the same way. Keep in mind that any stone or concrete surface will also serve as a heat sink. This, alone, can be a good reason to add a stone floor to your greenhouse. Even if your greenhouse is small or temporary, a dirt floor is often a bad idea. Watering of plants and even condensation can lead to a muddy mess that invites weeds, disease, and pests. There are plenty of inexpensive options for greenhouse floors, all of which are easy to install yourself. In general, any water-permeable surface that works for a patio or walkway will make a good floor for a greenhouse. For long-term stability, improved drainage, and a level floor surface, it’s wise to support any greenhouse floor with a 4- to 6-inch subbase of compacted gravel. Cover the subbase with commercial-quality landscape fabric (not plastic; the fabric must be water-permeable) to inhibit weed growth and to separate the gravel base Floors Pea gravel Crushed stone"},{"pageNumber":24,"pageContent":"22 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Wood and aluminum remain the most popular framing materials for hobby greenhouses, but they are far from the only options. Steel is popular for larger, more complex structures, and PVC is commonly used for more simple and portable greenhouses and hoophouses. Every framing option has advantages and disadvantages, which is why it’s essential that you choose the best framing material for your needs both now and in the future. The key is to balance durability, weight, expense, and, of course, appearance to find just the right framing. Looking at the tradeoffs entails considering local weather conditions (do you need a high snow or wind load tolerance?), the gardening you intend on doing (do want to hang baskets in the greenhouse?), and the look that most appeals to you (do you want the greenhouse to blend in or stand out?). Wood Advantages: Wood is often selected for custom greenhouse framing because of the many beautiful species available. The bonus with a wood frame is that it won’t conduct heat as quickly as metal or plastic and will be less likely to shed potentially harmful condensation. It is also long lasting and durable. These qualities come at a higher cost than that of other materials, but the price tag also buys an extremely beautiful greenhouse structure. Some of the best woods for greenhouses are cedar and redwood, because both are naturally resistant to rot and insects and age well, whether finished or unfinished. Hardwoods also offer these benefits, but the cost is usually prohibitive for a hobby greenhouse. The practical choice for a utilitarian greenhouse is pressure-treated wood. In either case, wood is a wise choice if you are planning on hanging baskets or accessories from the framing, or if you intend to put up shelving. Disadvantages: Wood framing is heavy and usually requires regular maintenance. Because it’s necessarily bulkier than other options, wood also casts more of a shadow on greenhouse plants. Rot is a potential problem, especially as the wood ages, and many types of woods will ultimately be attacked by insects—something that is never a problem with plastic or metal. You’ll also pay a higher cost for the frame than you would if you had used other materials, especially if you choose the beauty of redwood. Framing Materials A pine frame with plastic glazing. This is a good option for a lightweight and inexpensive greenhouse that will be used for two or three seasons during the year. Choose redwood for a greenhouse frame that will last years and provide an incomparable appearance to the structure. Aluminum Advantages: The foremost advantage of aluminum is that it is low maintenance. It is also strong and lightweight, lasts longer than wood, and can easily accommodate different glazing systems and connectors. Aluminum is used in many greenhouse kits and can be powder-coated or anodized in various colors (although the most common are white, black, and green). Aluminum greenhouse kits are typically"},{"pageNumber":25,"pageContent":"23 GREENHOUSES easy to assemble and come with predrilled holes for attachments, connections, and fixtures. Some manufacturers offer “thermally broken” aluminum frames, which are made by sandwiching a thermal barrier between two layers of extruded aluminum to decrease heat loss through the frame. Disadvantages: Because aluminum loses heat more rapidly than wood does, this type of greenhouse is more expensive to heat. In addition, cheaper aluminum frames can be too flimsy to withstand high winds or heavy snow loads. The material can also exacerbate condensation problems inside the greenhouse. Galvanized Steel Advantages: Galvanized steel frames are most often used for commercial greenhouses because the material is incredibly sturdy, strong, and durable. It can stand up to severe weather and resists corrosion and fatigue. Disadvantages: This type of framing is some of the heaviest, and framing a hobby greenhouse in galvanized steel will be extremely expensive both to ship and to build. If bumped and scratched, it can be subject to rusting in the scr atches, making it better suited to a large structure for which the frame itself won’t be buffeted. The protective coating will also wear off with age. PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) Advantages: PVC tubes are used in less expensive kits for hoophouses and greenhouses. The tubes make for a very low-cost frame that is durable and lightweight. The material does not rot and is entirely resistant to insects. It is also easy to clean, and although not distinctive in appearance, it looks neat and tidy. PVC frames are usually used in greenhouses meant to be portable and for beginner or intermediate gardeners. Disadvantages: High winds, heavy snow loads, and other extreme weather can damage PVC frames. Bright sun also takes its toll, making PVC framing brittle over time. It cannot be used with glass—the frames are restricted to bendable polycarbonate panels or plastic sheeting. This simple kit greenhouse includes a basic aluminum frame with durable polycarbonate framing. An upscale example of a handsome prefab, aluminum-framed greenhouse. The crest and finial are finished in long-lasting baked enamel. A crest like this, as well as adding flair to the greenhouse’s look, also keeps birds from perching on the ridge—which in turn keeps the panels cleaner. A simple hoophouse frame like this is easy to assemble and doesn’t require a serious investment in money or expertise."},{"pageNumber":26,"pageContent":"24 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES There are basically two types of greenhouse coverings: glass and plastic. The ideal glazing lets in the maximum amount of light and lets out the minimum amount of heat. But there’s more to any greenhouse covering than simply how much sunlight gets through. For instance, if you’re growing plants that are sensitive to light overexposure and burning, you may want to opt for an opaque glazing that not only lets less light through but also diffuses the light so that it doesn’t concentrate on plant surfaces. Different materials have different lifespans. Where glass will last as long as the garden does as long as it isn’t accidentally broken, polyethylene film is likely to become brittle and fogged after a few years. A good indicator of how long any given material will last is the warranty the manufacturer offers on the panels, sheets, or rolls of the material. Glass Advantages: Glass is the traditional material used for greenhouse glazing, and it remains popular today for good reason. If undamaged, the material will last forever. It offers some of the best light transmission among glazing materials, doesn’t degrade under long exposure to UV radiation, and is exceedingly easy to clean. It boasts surprising tensile strength—in a frame, it can hold up to a lot of stress and wind load. Although single-pane glazing has poor insulating properties, the R-value can easily be raised by purchasing double- or even triple-pane glazing. Disadvantages: Uninsulated single-pane glass is very inefficient at retaining heat. Glass is also extremely breakable—children, tree branches, and hail are all threats to a glass greenhouse. For safety, tempered glass is recommended for greenhouses because it shatters when broken, creating small, rounded fragments, rather than sharp, jagged shards. Glass is also heavy, requiring a strong supporting framework that won’t flex under stress. Direct sunlight passing through glass is so strong it may burn some plants. Lastly, unlike some synthetic materials and products, glass panes cannot bend to accommodate curved shapes, such as a hoophouse or Gothic arch greenhouse. Fiberglass Advantages: Manufacturers have vastly improved fiberglass panel formulation since the material first debuted as a potential substitute for glass panels in homes and outbuildings. Modern fiberglass panels are UV resistant and formulated to resist yellowing under prolonged sun exposure—a key problem in early panels. This material transmits almost as much light as glass does, but also diffuses that light. Fiberglass also provides much better heat retention than glass. The best panels now come with 15- or 20-year warranties. Disadvantages: The surface of fiberglass panels is rough and captures dirt, requiring more frequent cleanings than other types of glazing. Fiberglass Greenhouse Glazing Materials This stunning redwood greenhouse combines the best of both worlds—the beauty and view through clear glass windows on all walls and frosted polycarbonate panels on the roof to diffuse light. Fiberglass panels come in clear, white, and colored varieties, such as the green shown here. The ridged panels can be challenging to install, so manufacturers supply wavy nailing strips (called “closure strips”) that make installation as easy as nailing flat panels."},{"pageNumber":27,"pageContent":"25 GREENHOUSES panels can also, under certain circumstances, experience excess condensation that can lead to plant disease and overwatering. Dirt and debris can collect in the valleys of panel ridges. Inexpensive fiberglass panels will degrade and deteriorate much more quickly than high-quality versions do. Acrylic (Plexiglas) Advantages: Acrylic panels offer excellent light transmission, similar to glass, but in a lighter material that is incredibly durable and impact resistant. The material is also UV resistant and can be molded into unusual shapes. Acrylic is less expensive than polycarbonate, and is easy drill, cut, or shape. It can also be coated to reduce condensation. Disadvantages: Acrylic has never caught on for use in hobby greenhouses because less-expensive versions have a tendency to yellow with age, and uncoated acrylic is prone to condensation in the temperature extremes of a greenhouse. Polycarbonate Advantages: Polycarbonate panels are light, strong, and shatter resistant. Multiwall versions retain heat far better than glass does; the panels are available in basic corrugated form, but the more prevalent types of panels are multiwalled. Manufacturers offer panels with between two and five walls—the more walls, the greater the heat retention and the lower the light transmission. The panels also come in clear and white varieties for greater light diffusion. The material is tough and durable; warranties typically run 10 to 15 years for quality polycarbonate. It is also very easy to work with and difficult to break. Disadvantages: Although polycarbonate scratches easily, the main drawback to these panels is the high price. They are somewhat hard to clean, because certain mass-market glass cleaners can damage the material. Polyethylene & PVC Advantages: Greenhouse sheet coverings—primarily polyethylene plastic, but also including some PVC products—are inexpensive, easy to work with, incredibly lightweight, and adaptable to unusual shapes. They come in different thicknesses, with thicker sheet products slightly better at retaining heat without much loss in light transmission. These products usually come in white (although you can buy clear), which ensures that transmitted light is diffused and won’t burn plant leaves. The sheeting can be doubled up, whic h cuts down significantly on light transmission, or layers can be attached to both the outside and the inside of a structure, for improved heat retention. Disadvantages: Polyethylene sheeting does not retain heat well and will deteriorate under prolonged sun exposure. The material is prone to rips during installation and can become brittle and yellowed in as little as two years.

GREENHOUSE GLAZING CHARACTERISTICS*"},{"pageNumber":28,"pageContent":"26 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES All greenhouses need some kind of water supply system. This can be as simple as a hose connected to the nearest outdoor spigot or as complex as a frost-proof underground li ne extending from your basement to a special hydrant in the greenhouse. The latter is obviously more convenient, and the system can operate year-round. It’s also a pretty big job that usually requires a plumber to make the final connections. A somewhat easier alternative is to install a shallow underground water line that you drain at the end of the growing season, similar to the supply line for a sprinkler system. Or, if your water demands are not too great and your greenhouse is located near your house, maintain a rain barrel nearby. A rain barrel can provide a ready supply of water for your greenhouse. It’s an easy water supply option, but it lacks the convenience of linking the greenhouse to your house’s water supply system. Water A dedicated all-season water line is the ultimate setup for any freestanding greenhouse. To prevent the line from freezing during winter, the entire buried portion of the water line must be laid 6\" below the frost line in your area. In the greenhouse, the water comes up through a freeze-proof yard hydrant (commonly used on farms), which drains itself of residual water each time it is shut off. The water drains into a gravel pit (installed per local code and the hydrant manufacturer). In a typical installation, the supply line connects to a cold-water pipe in the house and includes a shutoff valve and backflow preventer (vacuum breaker). The line passes through the foundation wall (where it’s protected by a sleeve of rigid pipe) at the burial depth, then runs underground to the hydrant. For most applications, flexible PE (polyethylene) tubing is the best all-around option for the buried portion of the supply line. As always, all connections and devices must follow local code requirements. AN ALL-SEASON WATER SUPPLY"},{"pageNumber":29,"pageContent":"27 GREENHOUSES A greenhouse with a water supply of any sort should also have a drain. A dry well can be made with an old trash can or other container perforated with holes and filled with coarse rock. The well sits in a pit about 2' in diameter by about 3' deep and is covered with landscape fabric and soil. Dry wells are for draining graywater only—no animal waste, food scraps, or hazardous materials. Winterize a seasonal supply line using a shutoff valve with an air nipple. With the valve closed and the greenhouse spigot open, blow compressed air (50 psi max.) into the line to remove any water in the tubing. Then, remove the plug from the T-fitting inside the valve box (photo top right) and store it for the winter. A seasonal water supply line is similar to an all-season setup but somewhat easier to install and is just as convenient for everyday use. The supply line connects to a cold-water pipe inside the house and runs through an exterior wall above the foundation, then down into a trench (left photo). At the house-end of the trench, the initial supply run connects to the underground line (typically PE tubing) inside a valve box. The box provides easy access to a T-fitting necessary for freeze- proofing the line each fall. The supply run is buried in a 10\"-deep trench (or per local code) and connects to copper tubing and a standard garden spigot inside the greenhouse.

In the tank, water and fertilizer are blended to a custom ratio and then distributed to plants at an adjustable rate via a network of hoses, drip pins, and Y-connect ors. NOTE: The spiral trellis supports hanging from the greenhouse roof are not part of the watering system. Overhead-sprinkler systems are attached to the main water supply and use sprinkler nozzles connected to PVC pipes installed above the benches. The system usually includes a water filter, which prevents the nozzles from clogging, and a pressure regulator. Set the system to water in the morning and during the hottest part of the day. Avoid watering late in the day so the plants will be dry before nightfall, when the temperature drops and dampness can cause disease. Drip-irrigation systems use drip emitters to water plants a drop at a time, when moisture is needed. Each plant has an emitter attached to feeder lines that connect to a drip line of PVC tubing or pipe. Unlike overhead sprinklers, drip irrigation ensures that the plant leaves stay dry. It also helps to conserve water. If you prefer to water plants from underneath, consider capillary mats. These feltlike mats are placed on top of the bench (which is first lined with plastic) and under the plants, with one end of the mat set into a reservoir attached to the bench. The reservoir If your greenhouse is fairly small and you enjoy tending plants daily—pinching off a spent bloom here, propping up a leaning stem there—you might enjoy watering by hand, either with a watering can (which is laborious, no matter how small the greenhouse) or with a wand attachment on a hose. Hand-watering helps you to pay close attention to plants and cater to their individual needs. You’ll quickly notice signs of over- or under-watering and can adjust accordingly. However, hand-watering isn’t always practical. That's why many greenhouse gardeners use an automatic system such as overhead sprinkling and drip irrigation. This approach is convenient, especially when you’re not at home. Greenhouse suppliers sell kits as well as individual parts for automated watering systems. Be sure your system includes a timer that can be set to deliver water at specific times of the day, for a set duration, and on specific days of the week. You can also incorporate water heaters and fertilizer injectors into your system. Watering & Misting Systems"},{"pageNumber":31,"pageContent":"29 GREENHOUSES of about 50 percent to 65 percent are ideal—and dramatically decreases the temperature by as much as 20 degrees Fahrenheit. Misting systems are available through greenhouse suppliers. You can buy a complete system, which may include nozzles, tubing, PVC pipe, a humidistat, and sometimes a hard-water filter and a pressure gauge. Or you can buy the parts separately to create a customized system. The size of the greenhouse will determine the size of the system. Larger greenhouses need more nozzles and in turn more tubing and pipe. Humidistats can automatically turn on misters and humidifiers when the humidity drops below a set level. You might also want to invest in a device to boost the water pressure. Higher pressure produces a finer mist, which cools more quickly. Suppliers recommend placing the nozzles about 2 feet apart around the perimeter of the greenhouse, between the wall and the benches. Place the nozzles underneath the benches so the mist doesn’t drench the plants. As with watering, avoid misting late in the day. Wet leaves and cold, humid air can encourage disease. ensures that the mat is constantly moist. Moisture from the mat is drawn up into the soil and to the plant roots when the soil is drying out. Unlike drip irrigation and overhead sprinkling, capillary-mat watering systems do not require electricity, pipes, or tubing. However, unless they are treated, the mats will need regular cleaning to prevent mildew and bacteria buildup. To ensure that the system works properly, it’s important that the bench be level. Regardless of the watering system you choose, use lukewarm water. Cold water can shock the roots, especially if the soil is warm. If you’re hand-watering, let the water sit in the greenhouse so it warms up to ambient temperature. (Keep it out of the sun, though—you don’t want it to get too hot). Wand watering and automatic systems can benefit from an installed water heater. Misting When the temperature inside the greenhouse rises and the vents open, they release humidity. Misting increases humidity, which most plants love—levels Misting is a very gentle method of providing moisture to plants. Misting heads mounted on spray poles (inset) can be controlled manually or automatically. In addition to maintaining a constant state of moistness for plants, a misting system will give your greenhouse a tropical environment that many gardeners enjoy."},{"pageNumber":32,"pageContent":"30 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES The three types of light bulbs used in greenhouses are incandescent bulbs, fluorescent tubes, and high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, which include metal halide (MH) or high-pressure sodium (HPS). Each has advantages and disadvantages, which is why greenhouse gardeners often use a combination of two or more types to achieve light that is as close to natural as possible. Incandescent Ordinary tungsten incandescent bulbs are inexpensive, readily available, and a good source of red rays, but they are deficient in blue light. They can be useful for extending daylight for some plants and for supplementing low light levels, but they are not an efficient primary source of light. Incandescent lights produce a lot of heat—hanging them too close to plants can burn foliage, but if you hang them at a safe distance, they don’t provide enough intensity for plant growth. The average life span of an incandescent bulb is about 1,000 hours. Fluorescent Fluorescent tubes are more expensive than incandescent bulbs, but the higher cost is amply offset by their longevity and efficiency: bulb life for The most basic greenhouses use only the sunlight nature provides to grow plants in a warmer environment than the plants would experience outdoors, but a greenhouse can be much more than that. If you’re willing and able to run power to the structure—or if it’s connected to your home—you can add lights that will not only extend growing days and growing seasons but will also allow you to care for your plants after dark. In fact, supplemental artificial lighting is key to turning a two- or three-season greenhouse into a four-season garden structure. Supplementing natural light with artificial light can be tricky. Natural light is made up of a spectrum of colors that you can see (the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet colors of the rainbow) and those you can’t see (infrared and ultraviolet). Plants absorb light from the red and blue ends of the spectrum—blue light promotes plant growth; light from the red end of the spectrum encourages flowering and budding. The red-blue light combination is easily achieved when the source is the sun but a little more difficult when you’re using artificial lighting. Intensity is also important: Lights that are set too far away or that don’t provide enough brightness (measured in lumens or foot-candles) will produce weak, spindly plants. The right lighting in a greenhouse increases the number of hours you can work in the structure each day and expands the growing season and growing hours of plants. Lighting"},{"pageNumber":33,"pageContent":"31 GREENHOUSES Ordinary incandescent lights aren’t particulary good sources of growth-promoting light, but they can help heat a greenhouse. And their attractive warm light also turns a greenhouse into a nighttime landscape design feature. fluorescents is about 10,000 hours, and they provide the same amount of light as incandescents with only one-quarter to one-third the amount of energy. They also produce much less he at than incandescent bulbs. Fluorescent bulbs (or “lamps,” as they’re called by the lighting industry) come in a variety of colors and temperature ranges, including full-spectrum light. Cool white lamps, which produce orange, yellow-green, blue, and a little red light, are the most popular choice. To provide seedlings and plants with a nearly full spectrum of light, many growers combine one cool white lamp and one soft (or warm) white lamp in the same fixture. Due to their energy efficiency and low heat output, fluorescent-tube fixtures are great for ambient lights that you might leave running for long periods, as well as for task lighting. They’re also the best all-around choice for starting seedlings and growing small plants. The downside to using fluorescents as grow lights is that they must be hung very close to the plant—from 2 to 8 inches, depending on the plant—to be effective. This makes them most useful for propagation and low-growing plants. HID High-intensity discharge (HID) lights work by sending an electrical charge through a pressurized gas tube. There are two types: high-pressure sodium (HPS), which produces light in a narrow yellow-orange- red band, and metal halide (MH), which produces a broader range of light waves but tends to be more toward the white-blue-violet end of the spectrum. Fluorescent is a better source of growth-stimulating light for your greenhouse. It must, however, be hung relatively close to plants in order to spur growth. Novice growers tend to use metal halide lights if they’re using grow lights at all. But more experienced greenhouse gardeners, and those who grow throughout the year, may use a combination: MH lights to start plants off and encourage early growth and bushiness, then switching to HPS as the plants mature, because HPS light encourages flowering and fruiting. In fact, although most fixtures do not allow for bulbs to be interchanged, convertible fixtures are available that do allow the gardener to switch between bulbs. HID lights of both types are very expensive, but they last a long, long time. A standard 400-watt HID bulb can provide 20,000 hours of lighting. These bulbs also light a large area: that single bulb will provide enough light for 16 square feet of plants. HID lights do, however, produce a go od amount of heat. Hang them high in the greenhouse, and provide plenty of ventilation in warmer months. LED Grow Lights As lighting technology continues to evolve, light- emitting diodes (LEDs) are growing in popularity and use. Manufacturers have developed special LED grow lights that include both blue and red light waves, effectively serving all the needs of plants—from initial growth through mature budding, flowering, and fruiting. The big bonus of these bulbs is that they last almost as long as HID lights do but cost a fraction of the price. The lights can be used with conventional fixtures and provide wide, diffuse illumination that prevents the light from ever burning plant leaves."},{"pageNumber":34,"pageContent":"32 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES A portable space heater may be all the supplemental heat your greenhouse requires. Use it with caution, and make sure yours shuts off automatically if it overheats or is knocked over. In most climates, an electric heater with an automatic thermostat will be sufficient to protect tender plants on cold nights. Electricity is an expensive heating option, however, so it’s best reserved for moderate heating needs. be sure the fan doesn’t blow warm air directly on the plant leaves; they may scorch. Gas heaters usually cost more than electric and most areas require that a licensed professional hook them up, but heating bills will be lower than if you use an electric heater. Gas heaters operate much like a furnace: a thermostat turns on the heat when the temperature drops below its setting. You can help to distribute the heat by using a fan with the heater. If you plan to use a gas heater, install the gas line when you’re building the foundation. It is also important to ensure that the heater is vented to the outside and that fresh air is available for combustion. Poor ventilation can cause dangerous carbon-monoxide buildup. Propane, oil, and kerosene heaters also need to be vented, and if you’re using kerosene, be sure it’s high- grade. Another option is hot-water heating, in which the water circulates through pipes set around the perimeter of the greenhouse under the benches. You can also consider overhead infrared heat lamps and soil-heating cables as sources of heat. Novice greenhouse gardeners can gain knowledge and extend their growing season with a basic lean- to or tiny kit greenhouse. But if you’re going to take advantage of the full potential inherent in greenhouse gardening, you’ll need to heat the greenhouse. There are several ways to do that. Some techniques, such as using a heat sink, are usually meant as a complement to a main heat source. In any case, the most common and simplest way to heat your greenhouse is with a heater. The two main types are electric and fuel fired (gas, propane, kerosene, or oil). Electric heaters are inexpensive and easy to install. They provide adequate heat for a small greenhouse in a temperate climate and are useful for three-season greenhouses. However, they are expensive to operate (although relative costs are constantly changing) and do not provide sufficient heat for use in cold regions. Electric units can also distribute heat unevenly, making it too warm in some areas of the greenhouse and too cold in others. Placing a heater at each end of the greenhouse can help. If you use an electric heater, Heating"},{"pageNumber":35,"pageContent":"33 GREENHOUSES greenhouse and adding up the totals. Here’s an example, using 380 square feet for the greenhouse area and 45 degrees Fahrenheit as the difference between the coldest nighttime temperature (10 degrees Fahrenheit) and the desired nighttime greenhouse temperature (55 degrees Fahrenheit). 380 square feet × 45 × 1.1 = 18,810 Btu. If the greenhouse is insulated or uses double- glazed glass or twin-wall polycarbonate, you can deduct 30 percent from the total Btu required; if it’s triple-glazed, deduct 50 percent. You can deduct as much as 60 percent if the greenhouse is double-glazed and attached to a house wall. Oil, gas, kerosene, and other fuel- operated heaters must be vented to the outside and have a source of fresh air for combustion. Heat is measured in British thermal units (Btu), the amount of heat required to raise one pound of water 1 degree Fahrenheit. To determine how many Btu of heat output are required for your greenhouse, use the following formula. Area (the total square footage of the greenhouse panels) × difference (the difference between the coldest nighttime temperature in your area and the minimum nighttime temperature required by your plants) × 1.1 (the heat-loss factor of the glazing; 1.1 is an average) equals Btu. Calculate the area by multiplying the length by the height of each wall and roof panel in the Calculating Heat Needs • Heaters must be equipped with an automatic shut-off switch. • Position several thermometers at bench level throughout the greenhouse so you can check that heat is evenly distributed. • Do not place thermometers or thermostats in direct sunlight. • Install an alarm to warn you if the temperature drops dangerously low. Set the temperature warning high enough to give you time to remedy the problem before plants die. • Use a backup generator to supply power to electric heaters during power outages.

Plant low-growing plants around the foundation, or prop hay bales or burlap bags filled with dry leaves against the walls. Heat Sinks Heat sinks absorb solar energy during the day and radiate it back into the greenhouse at night. Stone, tile, and brick floors and walls are good collectors of heat, but to be really effective, they should be insulated from underneath. Piles of rocks can act as heat sink, but the best option is a blue- or black- painted barrel or drum full of water. Place a few of them around the greenhouse. If you have an attached greenhouse, painting the house wall a dark color can cause it to radiate solar heat back into the greenhouse at night. A light-colored wall, on the other hand, can help reflect heat and light back into the greenhouse during the day. This heat sink system uses solar energy to heat the greenhouse. Air heated by the sun is drawn in by the fan and blown into the rock pile, which also absorbs solar heat. Heat is radiated back into the greenhouse after the sun goes down. On cold, cloudy days and at night, solar heat is lost. Even if you have supplemental heating, holding onto that heat is essential to maintaining an optimal climate. Insulating the greenhouse and making use of heat sinks are the most effective means of conserving heat, but don’t overlook heat thieves such as cracks and gaps. Be sure the glazing is tight, and seal any opening that lets in cold air. If you built a concrete foundation, it may have polystyrene board installed between the concrete and the soil. Concrete rapidly loses heat if the ground around it is cold, and polystyrene insulation helps to reduce this heat loss. You can use polystyrene board or bubble insulation (similar to bubble wrap used for shipping) to temporarily insulate the walls of the greenhouse. Simply attach the material to the greenhouse frame beneath the benches before winter and remove it in the summer. You can also insulate Conserving Heat"},{"pageNumber":37,"pageContent":"35 GREENHOUSES A heating and cooling thermostat is perhaps the most important greenhouse control device. The thermostat will control heat sources and automatic ventilaters to cool the greenhouse when temperatures climb into the danger zone for overheating plants. • Reduce the temperature by 5°. Growth may be slowed, but plants will survive. • Make sure the greenhouse is as airtight as possible. • To prevent drafts, add a storm door. • Mulch the soil in raised benches to insulate it during cool seasons. Consider watering tropical foliage plants and other warm-season plants with water warmed to 65°F. • Insulate all water- or steam-heating supply lines. • At night, hang black cloth horizontally from the greenhouse ceiling as close to the plants and benches as possible to prevent the warm air from escaping through the roof. • If the greenhouse uses automatic vents that are controlled by a separate thermostat, set that thermostat 5° or 10° higher than the heater thermostat to keep the vents from opening when the heat is on. • Install an alarm system that will go off when the temperature goes above or below the safe range or when there is a power failure. • Make use of the heat exhausted by your clothes dryer by running the vent into your greenhouse. • Plant a “shelter belt” of evergreens on the windward side of the greenhouse to reduce heating costs. (But be sure it is far enough away that it doesn’t cast shade on the greenhouse.) When you landscape your property, you consider its microclimates: the sunny, sheltered corner; the cool, shady spot beneath the trees; that strip along the back that always catches the breeze. Your greenhouse has microclimates, too. It’s warmer near the roof and cooler at floor level; some spots are shaded and others receive strong, direct light; and down near the wall vents, it’s cool and breezy. Like the plants in a garden, greenhouse plants have differing light, heat, soil, and moisture requirements. Before you place them in the greenhouse, take stock of the microclimates, and group plants according to their needs. SMART HEAT CONSERVATION MICROCLIMATES"},{"pageNumber":38,"pageContent":"36 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Whether your plants thrive depends on how well you control their environment. Adequate sunlight is a good start, but ventilation is just as important. It expels hot air, reduces humidity, and provides air circulation, which is essential even during winter to move cold, stagnant air around, keep diseases at bay, and avoid condensation problems. You have two main options for greenhouse ventilation: vents and fans. Because hot air rises, roof vents are the most common choice. They should be staggered on both sides of the ridgeline to allow a gentle, even exchange of air and proper circulation. Roof vents are often used in conjunction with wall vents or louvers. Opening the wall vents results in a more aggressive air exchange and cools the greenhouse much faster than using roof vents alone. On hot days, you can open the greenhouse door to let more air inside. Also consider running small fans to enhance circulation. Vents can be opened and closed manually, but this requires constant temperature monitoring, which is inconvenient and can leave plants wilting in the Automatic openers sense heat buildup and open vents. Some openers are controlled by standard thermostats, while others are solar-powered. heat if you are away. It’s far easier—and safer—to use automatic vent openers. These can be thermostat- controlled and operated by a motor, which turns on at a set temperature, or they can be solar-powered. Unlike thermostat-controlled vent openers, which require electricity, solar-powered openers use a cylinder filled with wax, which expands as the temperature rises and pushes a rod that opens the vent. When the temperature drops, the wax shrinks and the vent closes. How far the vent opens is dictated by temperature: the higher the temperature, the wider the vent opens to let in more air. A fan ventilator is a good idea if you have a large greenhouse. The fan is installed in the back opposite the greenhouse door, and a louvered vent is set into the door wall. At a set temperature, a thermostat mounted in the middle of the greenhouse activates the fan, and the louvered vent opens. Cool air is drawn in through the vent, and the fan expels the warm air. The fan should be powerful enough to provide a complete air exchange every 1 to 1.5 minutes. Ventilation Greenhouse manufacturers rarely include enough vents in kits, so be sure to buy more. To determine the square footage of venting your greenhouse should have, multiply the square footage of the floor by 0.2.

Shade cloth is usually woven or knitted from fiberglass or polyethylene and is available in many colors, although green, black, gray, and white are most common. You can also find shade cloth in silver, which, like white, reflects heat and sunlight and keeps the greenhouse cooler than darker colors. Shade cloth also varies in density, usually from 20 percent to 80 percent. The higher the density of the cloth, the more light it blocks (60 percent density blocks 60 percent of the light). Be careful when choosing shade density; too little light will slow plants’ growth. Shade cloth can be simply thrown over the greenhouse and tied down when shading is needed, but this hampers airflow through the vents (unless you cut the cloth to size and install it in sections). Better ventilation is achieved by suspending the cloth 4 to 9 inches above the exterior glazing. Be sure the vents are open when you do this. Greenhouse shade suppliers can provide framework kits. Although vents and fans are the first line of defense when the temperature inside the greenhouse starts to climb, other cooling methods such as misting, humidifying, evaporative cooling, and shading can also help to maintain the ideal growing environment. Cooling is crucial during summer, but it can be just as important on a sunny winter day. Shades By blocking direct sunlight, shades protect plants from sunburn and prevent the greenhouse from getting too hot. They can be installed on the exterior or hung from cables inside the greenhouse. Both methods block the sun, but only exterior shades prevent solar energy from penetrating the glazing, thereby keeping the air inside the greenhouse cooler. When choosing shades, be sure they are UV stabilized for longevity. Roof shades, along with vents, help prevent a greenhouse from overheating in direct sunlight. Here, a combination of circulating fans and cloth shades mounted on the interior of the south- facing glass helps protect plants. Cooling Professional greenhouse growers with large operations typically apply greenhouse shading compound to the glazing of their structures so they can control heat entry and protect their plants. Similar to paint, shading compound contains ground pigments that reflect the sun’s rays. The compound is sprayed onto the glazing with an airless sprayer (you can use a hand-sprayer for a small greenhouse). Sold in 5-gallon buckets, it is diluted with water at an 8 to 1 ratio for plenty of coverage. Some types are designed to be easily removed with water and a fine nylon broom so you can make adjustments as needed. Other formulations are intended to be permanent.

But additional cooling devices may be necessary. In addition to cloth, roll-up greenhouse shades may be constructed from aluminum, bamboo, or wood. They are convenient because you roll them up when they’re not needed, and they last longer than shade cloth, but they are more expensive. Evaporative Coolers Evaporative coolers (also called swamp coolers) cool the air by using a fan to push or pull air through a water-saturated pad. A portable cooler might be sufficient for a small greenhouse; larger greenhouses will benefit from a unit cooler placed outside. Used when the humidity outside is less than 40 percent, these units draw dry outside air through the saturated pad, where it is cooled. The air travels through the greenhouse and exits via a vent on the opposite side. It’s a good idea to use an algaecide with these coolers. Liquid Shading Some greenhouse gardeners choose to paint liquid-shading compounds (sometimes called whitewashing) over the outside glazing. These compounds are inexpensive and easy to apply, but they can be unattractive and tend to wash off in the rain. Liquid shading can be thinned or layered to the Louvered and roll-up shades help to block the sun in this greenhouse. level desired, and the residue can be brushed off at the end of summer.

Set benches about 2 inches from the greenhouse walls to provide airflow, and avoid placing benches near any heat source. Bench width is determined by the length of your reach, so if you are short, you may want benches to be narrow. The same concept applies to height: although the average bench is about 28 to 32 inches, yours can be higher or lower to suit your height and reach. (If they need to be wheelchair-accessible, lower them even more.) If you have access to benches from both sides, you can double their width. Several options are available for bench tops. Wood slats are sturdy and attractive, and they provide good drainage and airflow. Use pressure-treated or rot- resistant wood, such as cedar, keeping in mind that cedar benches can be expensive. Wire mesh costs less, is low-maintenance, and also provides good airflow, but be sure that it is strong enough to support heavy plants. Plastic-coated wire-mesh tops are available. These are similar to (if not the same as) the closet shelving found in home stores. Usually white, they have the advantage of reflecting light within the greenhouse. Almost any greenhouse can benefit from the right workbench in the right area. But choose carefully, because the weight and messiness of some plants means only certain workbenches will do. How you lay out benches depends on your needs and the size of your greenhouse. Most average-size greenhouses can accommod ate a bench along each wall, with an aisle down the middle for access. If you have enough space along one endwall, you can install more benches to create a U shape. Another option is to arrange the benches in a peninsula pattern. Shorter benches are set at right angles to the outside walls, with narrow aisles in between, leaving space for a wider aisle down the middle. You can also use a single, wider bench along a side wall and leave space for portable benches and taller plants against the other wall. A larger greenhouse can accommodate three benches with two aisles. Regardless of the layout you choose, it’s best to run workbenches east to west so plants receive even light distribution throughout the day. Use the space as efficiently as possible, and don’t inadvertently block the door. Allow enough room in the aisles to move around comfortably; make them wider if you need Workbenches & Storage"},{"pageNumber":43,"pageContent":"41 GREENHOUSES For space efficiency, potting benches can double as storage containers. Here, the potting benches include spaces for mixing and storing soils for potting. Slatted covers make it easy to keep the bench-tops tidy. buying a potting tray that you can move around and use as needed. Unless you have a separate place to store tools and equipment, you’ll need to find room for them in the greenhouse. To determine how much space you’ll need, first list all of the equipment necessary to operate the greenhouse: everything from labels, string, and gardening gloves to bags of soil, pots, trash cans, and tools. If you will use harmful chemicals, be sure to include a lockable storage area. Just as in your home, finding storage space in the greenhouse can be a challenge. Look first to shady areas. If the greenhouse has a kneewall, the area under the benches can provide a good deal of storage space. Shelves can also provide storage space for lightweight items. Be creative and make efficient use of any area where plants won’t grow to create accessible yet tidy storage for equipment. You can also choose solid tops made of wood, plastic, or metal. Solid wood tops should be made from pressure-treated wood, and metal tops should be galvanized to prevent rust. Solid tops provide less air circulation than slatted or mesh tops, but they retain heat better in winter and are necessary if you use a capillary-mat watering system. The greenhouse framing material will determine whether you can install shelves. Shelves can easily be added to a wood-framed greenhouse, and many aluminum greenhouse ki t manufacturers provide predrilled framing, along with optional accessories for installing shelves. Keep in mind that even if shelves are wire mesh, they can cast shade onto the plants below.

Glazed terra cotta pots hold moisture better than unglazed pots and don’t show mineral deposits. Terra cotta pots are more expensive than plastic pots. Practical and inexpensive, plastic pots hold moisture better than terra cotta pots, so you don’t have to water plants as often. Gardeners who plan to start seeds and propagate plants often use plastic trays, flats, and cell packs, although peat pots, cubes, and plugs are also available for starting seeds. If you’re a container gardener, you are already familiar with the vast array of pots available at garden centers. For greenhouse gardening, however, pot choices are narrowed to two types: terra cotta and plastic. Terra cotta pots are attractive and heavier than plastic, which means they are less likely to be knocked over. In addition, they are porous—because water evaporates through the clay, the risk of overwatering is lower. However, you will have to water plants more often and clean the pots regularly to remove deposits Terra cotta containers are preferable if your plants will live in the pot permanently. If you are only starting plants for transplant, inexpensive plastic pots and trays are a good choice.

Hydroponic growing medium, which holds plants in place, can be made of polystyrene balls, expanded clay pellets, gravel, pea stone, perlite, vermiculite, rock wool, or coconut fibers. The simplest method is to place growing medium into a pot and add a nutrient solution once or twice a day. A more complex system involves using computer-controlled pumps to automatically flush plants’ roots with nutrient solution as necessary for maximum growth. Many vegetables and herbs that are suitable for greenhouse growing are also good candidates for a hydroponic environment. Testing different species and judging their success can be a fun process. Root systems grow through the plant support medium and down into the water below. Here, the water is contained in a child’s plastic wading pool. Lettuces are probably the most common hydroponically grown vegetable. They often are shipped with the root system intact for greater longevity.

It’s a great starter option for novice greenhouse gardeners. A hoophouse is a simple greenhouse made by wrapping clear plastic over a series of U-shape frames. See page 102. Some greenhouse designs are so simple that construction requires only a weekend or two. The foundation can be an anchored wooden frame or, for a more permanent structure, a concrete base. Hoophouse Economical and versatile, a hoop-style greenhouse (also called a hoophouse or a quonset house) is constructed of PVC or metal pipes that are bent into an inverted U shape, attached to a base, and connected at the top by a ridgepole. A hoophouse is usually covered with plastic sheeting. A door can be set at one end, and there may be an exhaust fan or flap vent that can be rolled up for ventilation. Because the hoop greenhouse is lightweight, it is not a good choice in areas with strong winds. (For instructions on building a hoophouse, see pages 102 to 107.)

March day can heat a cold frame to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius), so be sure to monitor the temperature inside, and prop up or remove the cover when necessary. On cold nights, especially when frost is predicted, cover the box with burlap, old quilts, or fallen leaves for insulation. An inexpensive foray into greenhouse gardening, a cold frame is practical for starting early plants and hardening off seedlings. It is basically a box set on the ground and topped with glass or plastic. Although mechanized models with thermostatically controlled atmospheres and sashes that automatically open and close are available, you can easily build a basic cold frame—or several, in a range of sizes (see page 178). Just be sure to make the back side of the frame about twice the height of the front so that the glazing can be slanted on top. Also ensure that the frame is tall enough to accommodate the ultimate height of the plants growing inside. The frame can be made of brick, plastic, wood, or other materials, and it should be built to keep drafts out and the soil in. Most important, the soil inside must be fertile, well tilled, and free of weeds. If the frame is permanently sited, position it to receive maximum light during winter and spring and to offer protection from wind. An ideal spot is against the wall of a greenhouse or another structure. Ventilation is important; more plants in a cold frame die from heat and drought than from cold. A bright Cold Frames Similar in construction to cold frames (but not as common), hotbeds have been around since Roman times. Emperor Tiberius directed his gardeners to grow cucumbers in dung-filled carts that were wheeled outside during the day and brought into a rudimentary “greenhouse” at night so that he had a supply of the vegetables year-round. This type of garden incorporates horse or chicken manure, which releases heat as it decomposes. The manure is set within the bed frame below ground level and is then topped with a layer of soil. (If you prefer, you can forgo the manure and lay heating cables between soil layers.) To prevent overheating, ventilate a hotbed as you would a cold frame.

This sunroom blends beautifully with the house. Large windows and doors open onto the terrace or garden. A high roof, which might be all glass, lets in abundant natural light. Decorative architectural features announce that this place is different from the rest of the house—separate, but in harmony. Like the conservatories of old, sunrooms can be used for growing plants and flowers indoors, but they are just as often used as sitting rooms, from which to admire the plantings outside the windows. The sunroom can be a grand conservatory—an ornamented, plant-filled glass palace attached to an equally grand home. Or it can be a modest room containing little more than a few potted plants and a comfortable reading chair. Grand or modest, the sunroom is neither wholly of the house nor of the garden; it is a link between the two, a place in which you can feel a part of the garden but with all of the comforts of home. A greenhouse can certainly satisfy the desire to grow a profusion of plants year-round, but it’s not everyone’s cup of tea. Even the most avid gardener will agree that operating and maintaining a greenhouse requires a major commitment—in a greenhouse, the plants depend solely on you for their well-being. The sunroom, on the other hand, allows you to surround yourself with flowers and plants in a sunny, light-filled room that is designed primarily for your comfort. Like the greenhouse, the sunroom’s roots are found in the orangeries and conservatories built on the grand estates of Europe. In the nineteenth-century conservatory, fashionable women gathered under the glass in exotic, palm-filled surroundings for tea.

If you’re looking for a greenhouse project that blends with the look and character of your home, your best bet is to design and build one yourself. The custom greenhouse seen in this project is designed and scaled to fit lean-to-style against a south-facing wall on an 1890s-era Victorian house. The principal design details that make it blend are the kneewall, which uses the same narrow wood lapsiding as the house, and the custom windows and door, which feature an arch element that is also present in the house trim. At roughly 6 × 9 feet in floorplan, the greenhouse is on the small side. But a space-conserving built-in-bench helps the gardener who designed the greenhouse get maximum usage from this small space. The glazing on the greenhouse is ¼-inch-thick clear polycarbonate (See Resources, page 236). The roof panels are also clear ¼-inch polycarbonate, but with a hollow twin-wall construction that resists shattering and limits condensation. The roof vents are operated by lift arms with integral thermometers. When the air temperature inside the greenhouse hits around 85 degrees, the vents pop open automatically. The windows and the door are custom-made by sandwiching polycarbonate panels between wood frames. To allow for movement of the materials, the frames are bolted together through oversized bolt holes. All but one of the windows are hinged on the tops so they can swing open to enhance ventilation. The greenhouse seen here features a poured concrete slab that is set apart from the house by an isolation joint. The back wall studs and roof panels are not connected to the house either, thus the greenhouse is technically a freestanding structure. Gaps between the greenhouse and the house are covered with various flashings, each of which is connected to one of the structures only. This has several advantages: primarily, it allows the structure to move and shift slightly (thereby avoiding cracking of glazing and roof panels) as the soil conditions and temperature change. And if the structure is small enough and has adequate setback distance from your property lines, you likely will not need a building permit. If the greenhouse were connected to the house, you would be required to dig full frost footings, as well.

An automatic lifter arm contains a sensor that causes your roof window vents to raise when the interior temperature reaches a preset level—usually around 100°F. The glazing and roof panels in this custom greenhouse are made from ¼\"-thick polycarbonate panels. The roof panels have vertical walls and are hollow, which makes them more dimensionally stable and less likely to crack than clear panels (a big benefit for roof). The ¼\"-thick, clear polycarbonate used for the window and door glazing is very durable too. Standard 1 ⁄ 8 \"-thick clear acrylic can be used for roofs or glazing. It is relatively inexpensive and sold at most building centers. But it has a shorter lifespan than polycarbonate.

For most DIYers, metal re-mesh is an easy reinforcement material to work with. It is sold in 5 × 50' rolls and in 4 × 8' sheets. Prop the re-mesh on some small stones or bolsters. The edges of the reinforcement should be at least 4 to 6\" away from the sides, and no closer than 1\" to the concrete surface. Build the three-sided concrete form and position it on top of the subbase. Screw the three 2 × 4s together with deck screws and then tack a 1 × 4 or 2 × 4 across the top, back ends of the sides. Square and level the forms and then drive wood stakes outside the 2 × 4 members. Attach the form to the stakes with deck screws driven through the stakes and into the form boards. NOTE: The slab seen here is sized so there is a concrete apron of 2 to 3\" around the structure, resembling a foundation wall. Some builders prefer to size the slab so the corner posts are flush with the slab edges, allowing you to cover the gap at the concrete surface with siding. Install a 4 to 6\" thick layer of compactible gravel to create a stable subbase. Tamp the gravel with a hand tamper or rental compactor. The tamped surface should slope away from the house at a very shallow rate—about 1 ⁄ 16 \" per foot. Insert an isolation board strip (usually made of asphalt-impregnated fiberboard) between the slab area and the foundation wall to keep the structures separate. Stake out the installation area for the greenhouse. Strip off vegetation and then excavate for the subbase material and that portion of the slab you want to be underground. For drainage reasons, plan your slab so at least 1 to 2\" of the concrete is above grade.

Standoff posts that elevate the post bottom slightly will greatly reduce the amount of water the post end will wick up from the footing. Set J-bolts into the concrete after it sets up and after you have rounded the edges with an edger tool. Make sure to follow your plan closely for the J-bolt positions. Cover the concrete with sheet plastic and allow it to dry overnight before removing the forms. Pour concrete into the form. For a slab of the dimensions shown (4\" thick by 68 × 84\") approximately 15 cu. ft. (½ yard) of concrete is required (thirty 60-pound bags of dry mix).

Test frequently to make sure the corners are square and the edges are flush with the post edges. Remove the posts for trimming to final height, making sure to note which post belongs in which base. Marking and cutting in this manner ensures that the tops of all posts will be level even though the slab slopes away from the house. Precutting posts to the same length will result in a roof structure that is not flat. Reinstall the posts in the anchors and fasten with joist hanger nails or 16d galvanized nails. Tack the posts in the standoff post bases with a couple of deck screws, making sure they are resting cleanly on the standoff pads. Also brace the posts with 2 × 4 braces so they are plumb.

Install back wall studs between the back sill plate and the back cap plates, spaced 16\" on center. Do not attach these studs to the house—they must remain isolated from it structurally. Add intermediate 4 × 4 posts between the sills and the undersides of the doubled cap plates. These posts should be situated directly above kneewall studs. The posts are spaced so the distances between posts will create uniform-width bays for the windows. Add 1 × 6 sills to the tops of the 2 × 4 kneewalls. The sills will cover the edges of the exterior siding, so make the interior edges flush with interior wall studs and cap plate. Build stud walls for the kneewalls between posts.

The twin-wall corrugated polycarbonate panels seen here are fastened directly to the rafters. A panel seaming strip with channels on each edge is fastened to the center rafter to create a transition between the two abutting panels. Install the strip first so you can take more accurate width measurements for cutting the panels. Also seal the roof structure with paint before installing the roof panels. The charcoal colored paint seen here recalls the color of wrought iron, which was used frequently to construct greenhouses and related Victorian structures, such as orangeries. Paint the structure prior to adding roof panels and windows with glazing. Two coats of exterior paint is an adequate finish for an exterior lumber product, such as this cedar siding. A base coat of primer is always a good idea. Install the siding on the kneewall. Generally, it is a good idea to install siding that matches the house siding.

A greenhouse also can be a quick-and-easy, temporary structure that serves a purpose and then disappears. The wood-framed greenhouse seen here fits somewhere between these two types. The sturdy wood construction will hold up for many seasons. The plastic sheeting covering will last one to five seasons, depending on the materials you choose. It is easy to replace when it starts to degrade. The 5-foot-high walls in this design provide ample space for installing and working on a conventional- height potting table. The walls also provide some space for plants to grow. For a door, this plan simply employs a sheet of weighted plastic that can be tied out of the way for entry and exit. If you plan to go in and out of the greenhouse frequently, you can purchase a prefabricated greenhouse door from a greenhouse materials supplier. To allow for ventilation in hot weather, we built a wood-frame vent cover that fits over one rafter bay and can be propped open easily.

Kits are usually very easy to assemble because all parts are prefabricated and the lightweight materials are easy to handle. The quality of kit greenhouses varies widely, though, and buying from a reputable manufacturer will help ensure that you get many years of service from your greenhouse. If you live in a snowy climate, you may need to either provide extra support within the greenhouse or be ready to remove snow whenever there is a significant snowfall because the lightweight aluminum frame members can easily bend under a heavy load. Before buying a kit, make sure to check on how snowfall may affect it. Kit greenhouses are offered by many different manufacturers, and the exact assembly technique you use will depend on the specifics of your kit. Make sure you read the printed instructions carefully, as they may vary from this project. The kit we’re demonstrating here is made from aluminum frame pieces and transparent polycarbonate panels and is designed to be installed over a subbase of gravel about 5 inches thick. Other kits may have different subbase requirements. When you purchase your kit, make sure to uncrate it and examine all the parts before you begin. Make sure all the pieces are there and that there are no damaged panels or bent frame members. A perfectly flat and level base is crucial to any kit greenhouse, so make sure to work carefully. Try to do the work on a dry day with no wind, as the panels and frame pieces can be hard to manage on a windy day. Never try to build a kit greenhouse by yourself. At least one helper is mandatory, and you’ll do even better with two or three. Construction of a kit greenhouse consists of four basic steps: laying the base, assembling the frame, assembling the windows and doors, and attaching the panels.

Establish layout lines for the gravel subbase, using stakes or batterboards and mason’s string. The excavation area for the subbase should be at least 2\" wider and longer than the outside dimensions of the greenhouse kit base. Make sure the layout is perfectly square (the lines are perpendicular to one another) by measuring diagonally between opposing corners: the layout is square when the measurements are equal.

Then attach corner brackets to the rear studs, and construct the back top plate by attaching the rear braces to the corners and joining the braces together with stud connectors. With some kits you need to go backward to go forward. Because the individual parts of your kit depend upon one another for support, you may be required to tack all the parts together with bolts first and then undo and remake individual connections as you go before you can finalize them.

In many agricultural areas you will see hoophouses snaking across vast fields of seedlings, protecting the delicate plants at their most vulnerable stages. Because they are portable and easy to disassemble, they can be removed when the plants are established and less vulnerable. While hoophouses are not intended as inexpensive substitutes for real greenhouses, they do serve an important agricultural purpose. And building your own is a fun project that the whole family can enjoy. The hoophouse shown here is essentially a Quonset- style frame of bent ¾-inch PVC tubing draped with sheet plastic. Each semicircular frame is actually made from two 10-foot lengths of tubing that fit into a plastic fitting at the apex of the curve. PVC tubes tend to stay together simply by friction-fitting into the fittings, so you don’t normally need to solvent glue the connections (this is important to the easy-to-disassemble and store feature). If you experience problems with the frame connections separating, try cutting 4- to 6-inch-long pieces of ½-inch (outside diameter) PVC tubing and inserting them into the tubes and fittings like splines. This will stiffen the connections. PVC Hoophouse A hoophouse is a temporary agricultural structure designed to be low-cost and portable. Also called Quonset houses and tunnel houses, hoophouses provide shelter and shade (depending on the film you use) and protection from wind and the elements. They will boost heat during the day, but are less efficient than paneled greenhouses for extending the growing season."},{"pageNumber":105,"pageContent":"PVC HOOPHOUSE • Space frame hoops about 3' apart. • Leave ridge members a fraction of an inch (not more than ¼\") shorter than the span, which will cause the structure to be slightly shorter on top than at the base. This helps stabilize the structure. • Orient the structure so the wall faces into the prevailing wind rather than the end openings. • If you are using long-lasting greenhouse fabric for the cover, protect the investment by spray-painting the frame hoops with primer so there is no plastic-to-plastic contact. • Because hoophouses are temporary structures that are designed to be disassembled or moved regularly, you do not need to include a base. • Hoophouses can act a lot like boat sails and will fly away if they’re not anchored securely. Be sure to stake each hoop to the ground at both ends (with 30\" or longer stakes), and carefully weight down the cover with boards (as shown here) or piles of dirt. • Clip the hoophouse covers to the end frames. Clips fastened at the intermediate hoops will either fly off or tear the plastic cover in windy conditions. ½\" CPVC pipes Ridge pole section Plastic sheeting T-fitting Cross fitting 1\" PE pipes ¾\" PVC pipes TOOLS & MATERIALS Hand sledge Plastic tubing cutter or hacksaw Wood or rubber mallet Circular saw Stapler Drill Utility knife Stakes and mason’s string Eye and ear protection Tape measure Work gloves (5) ½\" × 10' CPVC pipes (14) ¾\" × 10' PVC pipes (3) ¾\" PVC cross fittings (2) ¾\" PVC T-fittings 16 × 24' clear or translucent plastic sheeting (4) 16' pressure-treated 2 × 4s 2½\" deck screws (1) 1\" × 6' PE tubing (black, flexible) BUILDING A HOOPHOUSE"},{"pageNumber":106,"pageContent":"104 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Sheet plastic is an inexpensive material for creating a greenhouse. Obviously, it is less durable than polycarbonate, fiberglass or glass panels. But UV-stabilized films at least 6-mil thick can be rated to withstand four years or more of exposure. Inexpensive polyethylene sheeting (the kind you find at hardware stores) will hold up for a year or two, but it becomes brittle when exposed to sunlight. Some greenhouse builders prefer to use clear plastic sheeting to maximize the sunlight penetration, but the cloudiness of translucent poly makes it effective for diffusing light and preventing overheating. For the highest quality film coverings, look for film rated for greenhouse and agricultural use. Plastic tubing and fittings used to build this hoophouse include: light-duty ¾\" PVC tubing for the frame (do not use CPVC—it is too rigid and won’t bend properly); ½\" CPVC supply tubing for the frame stakes (rigidity is good here); polyethylene (PE) tubing for the cover clips; T-fittings and cross fittings to join the frame members. 6-mil UV-stabilized film 3- to 4-mil translucent polyethylene 3- to 4-mil clear polyethylene ¾\" PVC supply tubing (frame) ½\" CPVC supply tubing (stakes) PE tubing for clips ¾\" T-fitting ¾\" cross fitting"},{"pageNumber":107,"pageContent":"1 2 3 105 GREENHOUSE PROJECTS Join the two legs for each frame hoop with a fitting. Use a T-fitting for the end hoop frames and a cross fitting for the intermediate hoop frames. No priming or solvent gluing is necessary. (The friction-fit should be sufficient, but it helps if you tap on the end of the fitting with a mallet to seat it.) Cut a 30\"-long stake from ½\" CPVC pipe for each leg of each frame hoop. Plastic pipe is easy to cut with a plastic tubing cutter or a hacksaw. Mark the layout strings at 36\" intervals, using tape or a marker. Drive a stake at each marked location, using a hand sledge or hammer. Keep the stakes plumb and drive them in 20\" deep, so only 10\" is above ground. Lay out the installation area, using stakes and mason’s string. Stake the four corners to create a rectangle that is 10' wide and 15' long. To make sure the layout is square (the strings are perpendicular), measure diagonally between opposing corner stakes: when the measurements are equal, the layout is square.

Staple one edge of the cover to one of the 2 × 4s, keeping the material taut and flat as you work from one end to the other Add the ridge pole sections to tie together the hoop frames. The correct length for the ridge poles depends on the socket depth of the fitting you use, so you’ll have to measure the fittings and calculate length of the ridge pieces. If necessary, tap the end of each ridge piece with a wood or rubber mallet to seat it fully in the fitting socket. Continue adding hoop frames until you reach the other end of the structure. Wait until all the hoop frames are in place before you begin installing the ridge poles. Make sure the cross fittings on the intermediate hoop frames are aligned correctly to accept the ridge poles. Slip the open end of one hoop-frame leg over a corner stake so the pipe is flush against the ground. Then bend the pipes so you can fit the other leg end over the stake at the opposite corner. If you experience problems with the pipes pulling out of the top fitting, simply tape the joints temporarily until the structure frame is completed."},{"pageNumber":109,"pageContent":"8 9 10 107 GREENHOUSE PROJECTS OPTION: Make doors by clipping a piece of cover material to each end. (It’s best to do this before attaching the main cover.) Then cut a slit down the center of the end material. You can tie or tape the door material to the sides when you want it open and weigh down the pieces with a board or brick to keep the door shut. This solution is low-tech but effective. Secure the cover at the ends with 6\" lengths of 1\" PE tubing. Cut the tubing pieces to length, then slit them lengthwise to create simple clips. Use at least six clips at each end of the house. Do not use clips on the intermediate hoops. Pull the cover taut on the other side of the house, and repeat the process of stapling it to one board then sandwiching with the other. Lay another 2 × 4 over the first so their ends and edges are flush and the cover material is sandwiched in between. Fasten the two boards together with 2½\" deck screws driven every 24\" or so.

The front facade is dominated by windows—four 29- × 72- inch windows on the roof, plus four 29- × 18-inch windows on the front wall. When appointed as a greenhouse, two long planting tables inside the shed let you water and tend to plants without flooding the floor. If gardening isn’t in your plans, you can omit the tables and cover the entire floor with plywood, or perhaps fill in between the floor timbers with pavers or stones. Some other details that make this 10- × 12-foot shed stand out are the homemade Dutch door, with top and bottom halves that you can open together or independently, and its traditional saltbox shape. The roof covering shown here consists of standard asphalt shingles, but cedar shingles make for a nice upgrade. Because sunlight plays a central role in this shed design, consider the location and orientation carefully. To avoid shadows from nearby structures, maintain a distance between the shed and the structure that’s at least 2½ times the height of the obstruction. With all of that sunlight, the temperature inside the shed is another important consideration. You may want to install some roof vents to release hot air and water vapor. Building the Shed-Style Greenhouse involves a few unconventional construction steps. First, the side walls are framed in two parts: You build the square portion of the endwalls first, then move onto the roof framing. After the rafters are up, you complete the “rake,” or angled, sections of the side walls. This makes it easy to measure for each wall stud, rather than having to calculate the lengths beforehand. Second, the shed’s 4 × 4 floor structure also serves as its foundation. The plywood floor decking goes on after the walls are installed, rather than before. Shed-Style Greenhouse With slight modifications, many ordinary sheds can be redesigned as greenhouses. The addition of glass roof panels turns this shed design into an effective greenhouse.

The common element all types share is that their walls and usually their roofs are made of clear panel glazing that allows light in and traps it, raising the ambient room temperature to more comfortable levels in cooler times of year. Some of these structures are designed for gardening-related activities; others are meant for enjoyment or entertainment. Some are freestanding, others are attached to a house. If it is custom-built for you by a professional contractor, a sunroom can be quite expensive. But there is another option: a sunroom in a box. You can have a complete, do-it-yourself sunroom kit delivered to your home in cardboard boxes. A good deal of assembly is required, of course, but with a few basic tools and a helper, most people with basic DIY skills can complete the job in a weekend. The key features of this sun porch (manufactured by SunPorch Structures Inc., see Resources page 236) are its easy installation and its versatility. First, it’s designed to install right on top of an existing concrete patio slab or a wood deck, eliminating the extensive site-prep work required with a custom project. If you don’t have a patio or deck in place, you can build an inexpensive foundation with landscape timbers to support the sunroom structure, then create a floor inside using brick pavers, stone, wood decking tiles, or other suitable material. The sunroom manufacturer and your local building department can help you with the planning and construction details. The sunroom’s versatility is apparent in both its design and use. Its modular construction allows you to specify the height, width, and length of the structure to fit your needs and your house. Other modifications can be made at the factory to accommodate special installation requirements, such as installing the room to fit against the roof eave of your house or even slightly above the eave. The standard room design includes two matching endwalls and a front wall. If your sunroom will fit into a corner where two house walls meet, simply order the room without one of the endwalls. The sizes of endwalls also can be adjusted to fit other house configurations. Operable and removable windows make this sunroom versatile to use. In cooler months, all the windows can be closed against the cold to keep the sun’s heat inside. As the weather warms up, you can open either the top or bottom window sash to capture the breezes. And in the summer, you can take the windows out completely to convert the sunroom into a fully screened patio room. Sun Porch Kit It’s up to you to gain legal approval for your sunroom project. Contact your city’s building department to learn what its rules are. Some municipalities require permits and inspections for DIY sunrooms, while others exclude structures that are installed over existing patios or decks and do not change the home’s footprint. In any case, you should also consult with a qualified building professional to make sure your patio, deck, or other foundation can safely support a sunroom. A DIY sunroom kit comes with all of the parts precut and predrilled for your own custom design. Assembling the kit is a relatively easy task that most couples can accomplish in a weekend.

Precisely fitted wall shades are convenient for reducing glare and heat gain right where you need it. They’re also great for adding privacy when and where you want it without blocking all of your sunroom views. Optional roof vents allow hot air to escape and help to flush the interior of the sunroom with fresh air. Adjustable covers let you control the rate of airflow.

If the maximum height of the sun porch brings it up against or within 6\" of the bottom of the eave overhang, extend the fascia on the eave downward and fill in with boards or siding between the cornice and the back post for the sun porch. The ledger for the sun porch can be attached directly to the fascia board as long as the highest point of the sun-porch roof remains slightly lower than the roof covering. Be sure to attach the ledger so the lag screws hit into the ends of the rafter tails. If the sun porch is slightly taller than the roof eaves, you can add a ledger that’s taller than the fascia, but it cannot extend more than a couple of inches higher.

Also install 2 × 4 vertical nailers beneath the ends of the edges for attaching the walls to the house. Ledgers also may be mounted to rafter ends in the eave area (see previous page). Sun porch kits with nonglass panels can be mounted on practically any hard surface because they are light enough that they do not require a reinforced floor. You do need to make sure the floor is level, however (see next page), and that the base channels you lay out create square corners. Without roof vents, hot air is trapped in the sunroom, making it uncomfortable for users and inhospitable to plants. A single roof vent creates an escape route for hot air, allowing you to regulate the temperature and keep the room cooler during hot weather. Multiple roof vents increase the ventilation efficiency, but increase the chances for leaks.

The sunroom shown in this project (see Resources, page 236) is a three-season porch that encloses a second-story walk-out deck. The room is a modular kit that was custom-fabricated to the homeowner’s exact design and then assembled on site. Except for some custom framing work where the rooflines intersect, the installation was accomplished in a single day. Built from rigid PVC panels that fit into aluminum frames, this sunroom measures 14 × 14 feet with a 10-foot gable peak. The sidewalls are 7 feet high. The underlying deck area is covered with plywood sheathing that will become a substrate for the finished floor—here, vinyl tiles. The glazing on the windows of the room is a clear vinyl fabric that can stretch to absorb impact and accommodate seasonal changes in framework dimensions. The installers featured in this project are professional carpenters contracted by the sunroom seller. Custom sunrooms such as this can be ordered and installed by do-it-yourselfers as well. As a percentage of the total package price you won’t save a lot by doing the labo r yourself, however. Although they are not seen in the photos, a number of electrical receptacles were installed in the sunroom floor. The feeder cables run back to the house through conduit in the deck joist cavities, because the solid foam panels in the walls and ceilings do not readily accept cables.

Here, the exterior wall that will support the ridge is set back 18\" from a pair of bay windows that are covered by the same roof. This means that the cap plate for the bearing wall that will support the ridge pole is lower than the bottom of the pole.

Repurposing waste materials into a backyard plant- growing structure is a common-sense approach for the environment and your pocketbook, keeping waste out of the landfill and putting it to an ecologically productive use. It doesn’t hurt that reusing waste materials can also mean saving a bundle of money. Along the way, you may well expand your gardening repertoire. There are many ways to upcycle materials into a greenhouse or other plant-care structure. The first step, though, is to understand exactly what “upcycling” means. Upcycling is the more efficient cousin to recycling. Recycling involves using a lot of energy to break waste materials, such as plastic bottles, down into their fundamental ingredients and reform those ingredients into new consumer goods (or even the same consumer goods). Upcycling, on the other hand, is reusing waste materials in their current forms as building blocks for something completely different. This isn’t a new or novel concept—the back-to-the-land movement and homesteaders across the country have been turning one man’s trash into another’s treasure for decades. The variety of “trash” that can be upcycled for use as cold frames, greenhouses, hoophouses, or similar garden structures is simply astounding. The structural principles behind greenhouses and cold frames naturally lend themselves to building with a host of repurposed materials. The creative gardener can upcycle straw bales, plastic bottles, old windows, old tires, and even pruned tree branches. Special Section: Upcycled Greenhouses & Cold Frames"},{"pageNumber":152,"pageContent":"150 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Y ou need look no further than the local landfill to see how the volume of our waste material is overwhelming our ability to contain it. Efficient reuse of that material starts with filling a need. Looking to build a full-blown greenhouse from reclaimed waste? That will probably entail finding an outside source for reclaimed lumber and old windows. But if your needs are more modest—such as a cloche, a simple cold frame, or even a quick and easy raised bed—everything you require may be right in your own backyard, in the recycling bin, or the back of the garage. Plastic gallon jugs, plumbing odds and ends, and lumber scraps can all be efficiently upcycled. Once you’ve got an idea of the structure or structures you want to build, it’s time to search for the appropriate raw materials. The ideal is always “free.” Check Craigslist (craigslist.org), the Freecycle Network ( freecycle. org), and the postings on local co-op or community bulletin boards for free materials. The best source for free upcycle materials is the most unpleasant: dumpster diving. Look behind large stores for discarded pallets. Check the dumpsters at large- scale demo projects—such as a tear-down of a Where to Start Greenhouses, cold frames, and hoophouses are all fine for entire beds or large areas of the garden, but if you want to protect just one or a few plants, a cloche can be the perfect solution. Cloche is the French word for “bell,” and the first cloches were bell-shaped glass jars that produce-market vendors used to grow vegetables out of season for Parisian restaurants and farmers’ markets. Today, manufacturers offer many lightweight, low-cost versions, from basic plastic “solar bells” to aluminum-and-plastic lantern cloches. But really, a plastic milk jug or liter bottle will do the job just as well. In addition, the screw-top lid on most plastic bottles gives a bit more control over how hot the plant gets. (In a traditional cloche, you prop up the side to vent and cool the plant.) Keep in mind, however, that no matter what you use as a cloche, it’s meant to simply extend the frost date of the plant, not grow it throughout the winter. condemned building. You’ll find usable wood, old windows, and possibly even plumbing scraps on the worksites of major remodeling projects. (Always ask before going into a dumpster on private property or a job site.) If you can’t find the material you need for free, you can often buy it at very low cost. Check the local Yellow Pages for salvage companies, or visit local Habitat ReStore outlets. The rules of upcycling are simple and straightforward. 1. Don’t scavenge from private property. 2. Safety first. Don’t use unsafe materials or methods, and don’t create unsafe structures from upcycled materials. 3. Don’t create more waste than you reuse. 4. Use whatever materials you recycle in as close to original form as possible. 5. The end product must have a functional purpose. CULTIVATION UNDER CLOCHE UPCYCLING RULES"},{"pageNumber":153,"pageContent":"151 SPECIAL SECTION: UPCYCLED GREENHOUSES & COLD FRAMES The Materials I f you use your imagination, almost anything in the garbage can find a purpose elsewhere. But some materials are naturally better suited to repurposing for greenhouses and gardens than others. Plastic bottles: There is an epidemic of plastic bottles in America. Vastly more are produced than are recycled, and they constitute much of the waste quickly filling landfills (not to mention covering the ocean). Bottle plastic doesn’t break down, so if a bottle isn’t reused or recycled, it will remain forever wherever it lands. But the translucent structure and the fact that plastic doesn’t breathe make this material ideal for repurposing in the garden. Plastic bottles can be used as simple cloches (see the box on page 150), filled with poor-quality soil, dirt, or other material and stacked to create garden walls, and even used in the walls Plastic bottles have largely become an environmental disaster. But they can be put to good use in the garden, protecting small, vulnerable plants from cold snaps and extreme temperature variations. The cap provides a vent that allows you to release hot air and humidity as necessary. of a greenhouse. The bad news about bottles is also good news for upcyclers: they’re everywhere, and few people will complain if you collect them from recycling or garbage bins! (Make sure this is not illegal in your community; in some locales, recycled materials are a revenue stream for the civil government.) Pallets: Used wherever goods are transported in bulk (which is to say everywhere), pallets are almost as ubiquitous as plastic bottles. One broken board or cracked brace means a pallet is unusable for its intended purpose, but it may still be usable for your greenhouse. Pallets can be used whole, as a solid, level surface that can serve as the floor or workbench of a greenhouse, or they can be modified and used to make potting tables, garden chairs, and even side walls for a greenhouse. Avoid using pallets that have been treated with preservatives, fungicides, or other Modifying a pallet like this —removing the center rails and replacing them with 6-mil polyethylene sheeting—is one of the many ways you can upcycle these handy throwaways. This crude “window” can be used as a building block to form walls and a roof for a greenhouse."},{"pageNumber":154,"pageContent":"152 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES chemicals, and avoid those with paint on them if you can. On the other hand, keep an eye out for the mark “HT”—that stands for “Heat Treated,” which means the pallet has been processed to kill any pathogens. Wood: Old fence wood, rescued deck boards, discarded clapboard siding, and broken lumber can all benefit the garden. Reclaimed wood can be used in greenhouses, cold frames, and many other structures. The chances are that you’ll have to adapt the wood to your purpose, but a little sanding, ripping, or sawing is a small price to pay for free wood. Even wood scraps can be handy. Leftover 2 × 4 sections can be laminated together to form long 4 × 4 timbers for greenhouse foundations, skids, or raised bed walls. Cut down damaged 2× wood for the slotted tops of greenhouse workbenches or to use as stakes for the frame of a hoophouse. If you’re reclaiming wood from a much older building or any that has been around for decades, keep in mind that the wood may be actual size rather than nominal size—in other words, what looks like a 4 × 4 may actually be 4 inches by 4 inches, rather than 3½ inches by 3½ inches. That may mean adjusting building plans. Be leery of any wood that might have been treated with chemicals. For instance, old railroad track ties were once quite popular for garden bed borders, until gardeners realized that most of these have been treated with toxic, heavy-metal-based preservatives. The best woods to reclaim are naturally pest- and rot-resistant varieties—specifically cedar and redwood, or any hardwood. Windows: Old windows are obvious choices for crafting a greenhouse or cold frame. It’s fairly easy to find old storm windows or double-hung units that have been replaced with insulated windows. Look on Craigslist, or touch base with local window contractors. The one drawback is that you can never be sure of what size you’ll get, so be ready to adapt your plans. Wood-framed windows are the easiest to upcycle because it’s much simpler to drill, saw, or modify wood. Metal and vinyl frame windows can work, but you’ll need carbide drill bits and a bit more patience. Single-pane wind ows without mullions are the best option, because they cast the least amount of shadow on plants. If you’re using reclaimed windows for a greenhouse, you’ll also want the windows to be as airtight as possible; your garden may be better served if you take a little time and recaulk the windows before integrating them into a cold frame or greenhouse. Tires: Discarded car and truck tires represent an environmental disaster. Not only do they take up a lot of room in landfills (and in many unofficial, illegal dumpsites), they are also slow to break down. Worse still, waste tires represent a significant fire hazard. The good news? It’s not hard to find discarded tires, and you can put them to work with little effort. The thick rubber surface of even worn tires is a great insulator. It also absorbs and holds heat, making it a fantastic choice for a raised bed in a greenhouse, where it will absorb heat all day and release it slowly at night. A tire is also a great way to protect a tender plant or plants. Make a crude cold frame out of a tire by Old, discarded windows are the environmentally conscious greenhouse gardener’s treasure. They can easily be turned into a simple cold frame, or combined to create a nearly free greenhouse. You don’t have to look far to find secondhand wood that can be reused in garden structures, but take steps to ensure old, potentially toxic paint and finishes are removed before you upcycle reclaimed wood."},{"pageNumber":155,"pageContent":"153 SPECIAL SECTION: UPCYCLED GREENHOUSES & COLD FRAMES A used tire makes a wonderful raised bed that can be placed where it is most convenient for the gardener. Inside a greenhouse, the rubber becomes a heat sink that releases heat after the sun goes down. placing it over a plant and topping it with an old window (cut away the side walls with a reciprocating saw to increase the planting area). Lay the window across the tire and use a bolster to prop it up when you need to ventilate or cool the plant (or just cover the top with plastic sheet secured with bricks). You can also use a tire as a quick and easy potato bed. Fill the tire with soil and plant the seed potatoes. When the first growth breaks through the surface, stack another tire on top and fill with soil. Buckets: Buckets, specifically 5-gallon buckets, are used to hold everything from bulk food ingredients to drywall compound and much more. They are also incredibly durable and won’t break down in landfills. You can use buckets as beds for deep-rooted plants and even tree saplings, and they also make effective heat sinks. Paint the bucket black, fill it with water, and let the sun warm it all day; at night, it will slowly release heat, preventing the greenhouse from cooling too fast or too much. Stones: All kinds of reclaimed stone and brick can be put to good use in the greenhouse and garden. Use flagstone or brick—especially darker colors—for the floor of a greenhouse to incorporate a natural heat sink. A brick or stone floor is also a stunning addition to any greenhouse and one that creates a stable surface on which to stand and work. You can make wonderfully eye-catching raised beds inside or outside of a greenhouse with field stones or other irregularly shaped, uncut stones. A black bucket filled with river rock or trap stone can be an efficient heat sink. Reclaimed granite “curbstones” can serve as a tremendous foundation for a permanent greenhouse. They also make attractive walls for raised beds. It might look like a chaotic mess of plumbing leftovers, but this is actually a cold frame or greenhouse frame just waiting to be rescued and assembled. Plumbing pipe: A pile of old plumbing pipe and connectors might look like a mess, but look again. Plastic pipe can be used to fashion hoophouses and row cover frames. Old metal plumbing pipes and elbows can be repurposed into frames for cold frames and even for greenhouses. Any pipe can be crafted into a serviceable trellis to use along the back wall of a greenhouse for vining or tall-growing plants."},{"pageNumber":156,"pageContent":"154 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES S eparating your recyclables and putting them out in the proper bin on the proper day is certainly an environmentally conscientious step in the right direction. But the rubber really hits the road when you put waste materials to work in your own garden so that they never enter the waste stream and no fuel is burned in transportation or the recycling process itself. The projects that follow use a range of reclaimed materials in some surprisingly innovative ways. You can take these right off the page and build them yourself or use them as points of departure for imagining new projects that reuse your remodeling leftovers and garage debris. In either case, keep in mind that even as you break down materials to make them work for the structure you’re building, the scraps are reusable. Cutting down a PVC pipe for a hoophouse? Cut the scraps into stakes to use for a raised bed. Have leftover lumber that’s too short to use for framing or a greenhouse floor? Keep it handy for when you want to build shelves or a small potting table. Upcycled Projects Straw bales are growing in popularity as a medium for gardening, but they can also serve as excellent insulated walls for a cold-weather cold frame that you can assemble in minutes and move at a whim. There are several ways to create the cold frame, but in every case, you start by building a stepped frame with a shorter wall on the south side. Then it’s just a matter of deciding on your glazing material, which can be a totally opportunistic decision. For example, do you have an old single-pane window that you meant to take to the dump? Don’t. Lay it with one long edge resting on the north wall of your bales, nestled into between the two side walls. Prop the window up as necessary to vent or cool down the plants inside. You can use the same idea with a role of plastic sheeting over a plumbing pipe or lumber scrap frame—just roll the sheet up or down as needed to modulate the temperature inside the cold frame. An old window (or two) is the perfect partner for straw bales,creating an easy, quick, and efficient cold frame. Construct the cold frame so the face is sloped to face the best sun exposure. A STRAW-BALE COLD FRAME"},{"pageNumber":157,"pageContent":"155 SPECIAL SECTION: UPCYCLED GREENHOUSES & COLD FRAMES Building panels out of plastic bottles may be a bit labor intensive, but it’s a perfect upcycle use. Passive solar panels made from ordinary clear plastic bottles can be used for everything from a top cover for a cold frame box to the entire wall and roof panels for full greenhouse. No matter what the scale, it’s also a wonderful school project or weekend event for a group of kids because the actual work itself is so simple, plus it’s a hands-on way to teach them the importance of recycling and reusing. The more kids, the merrier. Start by collecting the bottles you need. It’s easy to find them in abundance in curbside recycling bins on collection day, inside the dumpsters in back of restaurants, or in the garbage cans at outdoor music events or other public gatherings. (As noted previously, make sure this is legal where you live.) It’s essential to clean the bottles inside and out to avoid attracting insects. Strip any labels off the plastic to ensure that a maximum amount of light passes through. Begin by creating whatever kind of frame for greenhouse structure you’re planning. At the large end of the scale, you can frame out a simple gable or shed-roof greenhouse using reclaimed wood, scraps leftover from other projects, or other material you have on hand. The greenhouse shouldn’t be large—the finished project will have too many gaps for air and water penetration for the structure to function as a fully fledged greenhouse. However, on sunny days, it will be able to maintain an interior temperature about 40 degrees warmer than the outside air. Once you have built whatever frame you are using, you can begin assembling the simple columns that will compose various panels. You can use poles made from ¾-inch to 1-inch dowels, leftover metal conduit, bamboo canes, straight and thin branches, rebar, or even wire. No matter what you make them from, the poles need to be long enough to span the frame members. Cut the bottoms of the bottles off and thread them onto the pole, nesting each additional bottle over the one below. Attached the completed poles to the framing at each end with pipe clamps. As mentioned, the resulting surfaces will necessarily have gaps, but the cumulative effect of the enclosure will be to allow light through while keeping temperatures high. Once you cut the bottoms off of the plastic bottles, they’ll stack easily on whatever you’re using for a pole. In our example, the plastic-bottle panel will be used as a simple cold-frame top to cover a small raised bed garden. USING CLEAR PLASTIC BOTTLES FOR GREENHOUSE PANELS"},{"pageNumber":158,"pageContent":"156 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES O ld, discarded windows are just about the most obvious choice for reuse in upcycled greenhouses. As homeowners across the country upgrade to insulated windows, older windows are relegated to the junk heap. These include wood-framed units that have seen better days, aluminum-framed storm windows that are no longer needed, and even vinyl- clad insulated windows that have come to the end of their lifespan. You can find them in dumpsters, piled up on remodeling job sites, for sale cheaply through salvage companies, and online through various sources—often for free. The trick to reusing these windows for a greenhouse is that you have to take what you get. Sizes vary, sometimes radically. The design shown here is typical, featuring a small footprint and a simple shed roof. The recycled windows used are 28 inches wide by 62 inches high; the larger windows are used in the walls, and the smaller are used in the roof. In both cases, these instructions assume wood-framed units. Wood framing is always best when it comes to adapting old glazing to a new hobby greenhouse, but you have to make sure that the wood is in good shape. The lumber used is all of common sizes and should be readily available through salvage companies or from job sites. The design can be scaled up or adapted to different sizes of windows fairly easily, as the framing details have intentionally been left somewhat crude to allow adaptation without a lot of fuss. A kneewall base ensures that no matter what windows you reuse, they’ll be well supported. We’ve also used fiberglass panels, which are widely available and simple to install, for the roof. When creating a design such as this, using mostly recycled materials, it’s a great idea to lay the windows and framing studs out on a big, flat work surface— for example, a garage floor or expanse of lawn. If you’re not necessarily good with the nitty-gritty of detailed measurements and nominal lumber sizes, this can be a way to verify that everything will fit and to make quick adjustments without having to tear things apart. Whatever the case, it’s always wisest to try to find multiple windows in the same size; cobbling together windows of odd sizes throughout the structure can lead to a nightmare and create an unstable and unsafe greenhouse. That said, any upcycling project involves certain compromises. This greenhouse will not be as airtight as most polycarbonate panel or plastic-film kit greenhouses would be (and certainly not as much of a high-quality custom structure), so it is at best going to serve you as a three-season structure—it just wouldn’t be cost effective to heat it over a cold winter. You can make the structure a little more efficient by recaulking the window panes in wood-framed windows and covering smaller openings or gaps between the windows in the roof and the wall top plates with plastic.

Depending on where you live, you’ll realize an extra six to eight weeks of growing time—a chance to get a big head start on your garden and harden off seedlings. This cold frame will do the job well without taking a bite out of your pocketbook. It is built with reclaimed 1 × 6 cedar fence boards and scrap pressure-treated 2 × 4 braces, and the top is a 24 × 36-inch salvaged wood-frame window. But keep in mind that you can use this design as a baseline; this is somewhat smaller than most cold frames, which makes it more portable, but it may not be suited to a large garden bed. It’s easy to alter the measurements to suit whatever window you happen to use—or even a glass door. You can also use a vinyl-clad window or aluminum-framed unit, although they will both make the box less attractive in the garden. Or, for a sturdier box, use 2 × 6 reclaimed lumber. That will make the cold frame much less portable but better suited to take abuse from the elements, pets, and small children. The design here includes mitered top edges along the length of the front and back frame members, which allows the window to close flush to the surface. If you aren’t equipped to make those miters or just prefer to avoid the extra work, switch the frame configuration so that the sides are positioned inside the front and back frames.

It follows many of the guiding principles of the Old-Window Greenhouse (page 156)—it’s lightweight, it’s easy to assemble, it uses mostly upcycled components, and it should be exceedingly inexpensive to build. There are tradeoffs, of course. This hoophouse is somewhat less durable than it would be if it were made with PVC hoops and thicker, clear, new lumber. If durability is important to you, you might want to upgrade to 2× lumber in place of the 1× members specified, and it would definitely be a good idea to anchor the hoophouse if you live in a region where strong winds or curious wildlife are factors. The goal throughout is to make the most of scraps and project odds and ends. You may have even better ideas than the upcycled materials specified in this project. Don’t be afraid to be imaginative. The baseboards may come from old deck fascia, torn-down fences, or clapboard siding from a defunct building. Branches serve as the hoops, and they will probably be the most challenging building material to find. If you don’t have mature trees that need pruning in your yard, you can usually find suitable branches in a forest or woods. (Consider it a good reason for a hike!) If possible, look for ideal branches are at least 10 feet long, green enough to be supple and flexible, and roughly the same diameter all along their length. Ideal branches are hard to find, though, and it is perfectly acceptable to form each hoop from shorter branches bent over from each side and lashed together at the top. This is the method used in our example. Don’t be fooled by the modest footprint of this hoophouse. There is enough room inside to grow an ample bed of edibles or ornamentals, and the height allows for tall plants. If, however, you’d prefer to cover a larger area, it’s simple to scale the structure up. Just increase it in foot increments, adding one branch hoop per foot. Tree Branch Hoophouse Look for green, freshly cut branches ¾ to 1\" in diameter. If you can find 10-footers, that's perfect; otherwise, lash shorter ones together as shown in this project.

Bamboo poles are lightweight, strong, and naturally decay-resistant. And because it’s a giant grass and in its natural form, bamboo looks right at home in any greenhouse. In this easy project, you’ll learn the traditional technique of constructing with natural bamboo poles and lashing twine. The trellis shown is freestanding and is held upright with rebar rods driven into the ground. It’s easy enough to find bamboo in plentiful amounts because it’s rugged and invasive. The thin canes you need for this project should be simple to come by (we painted the bamboo in this project red to show detail), although if you can’t find any, you’ll be able to buy the bamboo. Bamboo poles are sold through online retailers, local bamboo suppliers (where available), import stores, and some garden centers. The poles come in sizes ranging from about ¼ to 5 inches in diameter and in lengths up to 20 feet or so. Of course, the diameters are approximate and variable, since this is a natural product. For this project, the vertical supports are 1½ inches in diameter and the horizontal and vertical crosspieces are 1 inch in diameter. While bamboo can survive many years of exposure to the elements, a bamboo trellis is lightweight enough that you can simply pull it off of its supports and store it over winter. Ground contact or burial of bamboo poles does lead to premature rot, so it’s a good idea to prop up the trellis poles on stones or brick to prevent ground contact. A small pile of stones nicely hides the rebar and creates an attractive base around each support pole. Bamboo Trellis A bamboo trellis like this is great for bolstering any climbing plant. You can build a taller version for pole beans and other aggressive climbers or add more crosspieces or weave kite string between poles to support delicate vines.

All of the projects will make your garden a more productive and enjoyable place to work. Keep in mind that many of these projects can be executed with materials left over from a greenhouse project.

Basically, a cold frame is a box set on the ground and topped with glass or plastic. Although mechanized models with thermostatically controlled atmospheres and sashes that automatically open and close are available, you can easily build a basic cold frame yourself from materials you probably already have around the house. The back of the frame should be about twice as tall as the front so the lid slopes to a favorable angle for capturing sunrays. Build the frame tall enough to accommodate the maximum height of the plants before they are removed. The frame can be made of brick, block, plastic, wood, or just about any material you have on hand. It should be built to keep drafts out and soil in. If the frame is permanently sited, position it facing south to receive maximum light during winter and spring and to offer protection from wind. Partially burying it takes advantage of the insulation from the earth, but it also can cause water to collect, and the direct soil contact will shorten the lifespan of the wood frame parts. Locating your frame near a wall, rock, or building adds additional insulation and protection from the elements. Keep an inexpensive thermometer in a shaded spot inside the frame for quick reference. A bright spring day can heat a cold frame to as warm as 100 degrees Fahrenheit, so prop up or remove the cover as necessary to prevent overheating. And remember, the more you vent, the more you should water. On cold nights, especially when frost is predicted, cover the box with burlap, old quilts, or leaves to keep it warm inside.

But when your planting needs outgrow a basic backyard cold frame with a window-sash roof, it makes sense to look to the greenhouse for more comprehensive design inspiration. This jumbo version offers over 17 square feet of planting area and combines the convenience of a cold frame with the full sun exposure of a greenhouse. Plus, there’s ample height under the cold frame’s canopy for growing taller plants. The canopy pivots on hinges and can be propped all the way up or partially opened to several different positions for ventilating the interior to control temperature. The hinges can be separated just like door hinges (in fact, they are door hinges), so you can remove the canopy for the off season, if desired. Clear polycarbonate roofing panels make the canopy lightweight yet durable, while admitting up to 90 percent of the sun’s UV rays (depending on the panels you choose). The base of the cold frame is a simple rectangle made with 2 × 6 lumber. You can pick it up and set it over an existing bed of plantings, or give it a permanent home, perhaps including a foundation of bricks or patio pavers to protect the wood from ground moisture. For additional frost protection and richer soil for your seedlings, dig down a foot or so inside the cold frame and work in a thick layer of mulch. Because all sides of the canopy have clear glazing, you don’t have to worry about orienting the cold frame toward the sun; as virtually all of the interior space is equally exposed to light. Jumbo Cold Frame A cold frame can extend the growing season in your garden to almost—or truly—year-round.

But if you live in a home with a smaller lot, your foray into gardening will take more planning. It will require you to make extremely efficient use of your gardening space to achieve the volume of produce you want. In many cases, this challenge is addressed by sowing your plants in raised garden beds. Raised garden beds offer several advantages over planting at ground level. When segregated, soil can be amended in a more targeted way to support high density plantings. Also, in raised garden beds, soil doesn’t suffer compaction under foot traffic or machinery, so plant roots are free to spread and breathe more easily. Vegetables and flowers planted at high densities in raised beds are placed far enough apart to avoid overcrowding but close enough to shade and choke out weeds. In raised beds, you can also water plants easily with soaker hoses, which deliver water to soil and roots rather than spraying leaves and inviting disease. Raised garden beds can easily be customized to fit the space you have available. Just make sure you can reach the center easily. If you can only access your raised bed from one side, it’s best to build it no wider than 3 feet. Beds that you can access from both sides can be as wide as 6 feet, as long as you can reach the center. You can build your raised bed as long as you’d like. TIP: For low-growing plants, position the bed with a north-south orientation, so both sides of the bed will be exposed to direct sunlight. For taller plants, position the bed east-west. Raised Planting Bed Raised garden beds are easy to weed, simple to water, and the soil quality is easier to control, ensuring that your vegetable plants yield bountiful fresh produce. Your garden beds can be built at any height up to waist-level. It’s best not to build them much taller than that, however, to make sure you can reach the center of your bed."},{"pageNumber":191,"pageContent":"1 2 3 189 GREENHOUSE COMPANION PROJECTS Line the bed with landscape fabric to contain the soil and help keep weeds out of the bed.

Containment of the soil also prevents erosion, helps with weed encroachment, and improves water drainage. For many urban gardeners, a raised bed is the best—and often only—way to grow vegetables and other crop plants in tight spaces. Another advantage of a raised bed is that the frame around the bed provides a structure for adding covers to protect plants from cold, wind, and snow, or to erect netting to keep out pests. The simple cover frame shown here is much like a hoophouse structure used by farmers to shelter rows of crops on a temporary basis. Ours is made with PVC pipe and is easy to disassemble for storage at the end of the season. The lightweight frame is perfect for a canopy of plastic sheeting (for warmth in colder weather), spun fleece (for insect protection), or deer netting (to deter deer or any other hungry critters). The raised bed frame is made with a single course of 2 × 10 lumber. You can use smaller lumber for a shallower bed, or go higher with more courses and taller corner posts. Unless your bed will be used strictly for ornamental plants (not food), don’t use pressure-treated lumber, due to the risk of chemical contamination. Instead, choose a naturally decay-resistant species such as all-heart redwood, cedar, cypress, or Douglas fir. Raised Planting Bed & Cover Filled with carefully prepared soil, a raised bed offers high yields in a relatively small space. This simple, inexpensive bed design includes wood cleats installed along its top edges—a handy feature for clamping down covers of all types."},{"pageNumber":195,"pageContent":"RAISED PLANTING BED & COVER 2 × 10 4 × 4 2 × 4 ¾ × ¾\" trim ¾\" PVC pipe Uncovered Covered Level Permanent marker Hacksaw or pipe cutter Eye and ear protection Work gloves (2) 10' 2 × 10 (1) 8' 2 × 10 Deck screws (3½\", 1¼\") TOOLS & MATERIALS Tape measure Hammer Circular saw Square or straightedge Drill and countersink bit and 3 ⁄ 16 \" twist bit Reciprocating saw or handsaw Hand sledge (1) 8' 4 × 4 (1) 8' 2 × 4 (1) 8' 1 × 4 (7) ¾\"-dia. × 10' PVC pipe (6) 1½\" #8 stainless-steel machine bolts and wing nuts Cover material (8 × 14') (12) spring clamps"},{"pageNumber":196,"pageContent":"1 2 3 4 194 THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO DIY GREENHOUSES Set the bed frame into place, then measure diagonally between opposing corners to check for square: the frame is square when the measurements are equal. TIP: For general soil preparation, turn over the soil beneath the bed and add compost or manure, as desired, before setting down the frame. Create the corner posts by cutting the 8' 4 × 4 into four pieces roughly 24\" each. Trim the ends of each post to a point, using a reciprocating saw or handsaw. Assemble the frame by setting the sides over the ends of the end pieces so they are flush at the top and outside edges.

Fit a rib over the top of the ridge pole at each hole location. Insert the bolt through the rib and ridge and secure with a wing nut. The wing nuts allow for quick disassembly of the frame. Prepare the cover frame ribs by cutting six ¾\"-diameter PVC pipes to length at 96\", using a hacksaw or tubing cutter. Then, make a mark at the midpoint (48\") of each rib, and drill a 3 ⁄ 16 \" hole straight through the pipe at each mark. Mark and drill the ridge pole for the cover frame, using one of the 10' PVC pipes. Make a mark 1\" from each end, then mark every 24\" in between. The marks should form a straight line down the length of the pipe. At each mark, drill a 3 ⁄ 16 \"-diameter hole straight down through the pipe. For a more secure frame that is less likely to blow away, anchor the ¾\" tubing onto pieces of ½\" CPVC tubing that are set into holes drilled into the raised bed walls. A ¾\" bit should makes holes that are sized just right for the CPVC tubes, but drill a hole in a scrap piece first and test the fit. For extra holding power and to prevent the holes from filling with water, squeeze caulk into the hole before inserting the CPVC pipe.

Starting your own seeds can save money over buying established plants each growing season. And in many cases, it also lets you grow less-common varieties that might not be locally available in plant form. This accessory is particularly useful if you have a modest greenhouse without supplied heating, or live in a particularly cold area with long winters. This simple starter rack is perfect for a basement or utility room. The basic structure is built with 2 × 4s and has shelves made from ½-inch plywood. Plants that need the warmest temperatures should go on the upper shelf. Each shelf of the rack measures 24 × 48 inches— plenty of room for four full-size seedling flats. Two fluorescent shop lights illuminate each shelf and are fully height-adjustable so you can raise or lower them as needed to provide plants with the right amounts of light and heat at different stages of development (see page 30 for tips on choosing light bulbs for your fixtures). Because seeds and seedlings can require as much as 20 hours of light per day, it’s most convenient to control the lights with an automatic timer. This should be plugged into a GFCI-protected receptacle, due to all of the water used in the area. Even so, it’s best to remove flats before misting or watering, to keep water away from the lights. As with many projects in this book, you can easily modify the dimensions of the rack as shown to suit your specific needs. For a smaller unit, switch to 2-foot or 3-foot lights and resize the shelves accordingly, or make the shelves half as deep and use a single fixture for each. For a larger rack, you can make the shelves square and hang four 4-foot lights over each shelf. This easy-to-build starter rack (left) holds up to 12 full-size seedling flats or trays and can be located practically anywhere with an accessible electrical outlet. The top shelf offers a handy space for storing extra flats and other supplies. Wire utility shelving (above) offers an easy-to-assemble alternative to building your own rack. Most inexpensive units are only 14\" deep and can accommodate one row of seedling flats per shelf.

That’s why almost any sizable greenhouse is furnished with some kind of workbench running down both long sides of the building. Benches hold plants at a comfortable level, saving your back and your knees during those many hours of tending and watering. They also make for healthier plants, keeping them above the cooler air near the floor and, with permeable bench tops, allowing airflow and even some light to reach them from below. In this project, you’ll learn how to build a basic, easily adaptable worktable, to which you can add the top and shelf surfaces of your choice. Made with 2 × 4 lumber, the bench frame is simple, inexpensive, and durable. And because it’s put together with screws, you can easily disassemble the main parts for compact off-season storage (a great feature for temporary hoophouse gardeners). Several good options for top and shelf surfaces are shown on page 205. Regarding adaptability, you might want to change the dimensions of the bench as shown to suit your needs and/or fit the available space in your greenhouse. Simply add or subtract whatever you need to modify the bench width, length, or height. You can also add a second shelf to double the storage space for seedling flats and other short items, or to keep garden tools conveniently close to the bench top.

It can also be easily adapted to different gardeners—made lower or higher, longer, or deeper as need dictates. That makes it much more valuable than any prefab potting bench you can buy. The design includes a handy lower shelf to keep potting materials off the greenhouse floor and a wonderful compartment beneath removable slats where you can blend your own batches of potting mix.

But sometimes, all you really want from your work area is a big, broad surface with plenty of room to spread out and get busy. This workhorse of a bench is modeled after the most-used workspace in any home: the kitchen countertop. At 36 inches tall, the bench is the same height as most kitchen counters, and at 28 inches wide, it’s slightly deeper than standard countertops—but not so deep that you can’t easily reach across to the other side. The symmetrical configuration allows you to push any part of the bench against a greenhouse wall and still get plenty of light penetration. There’s also no need to worry about a moisture- laden greenhouse environment. The understructure is made with moisture-resistant, pressure-treated lumber, and the top is made up of composite decking boards that won’t split, rot, or splinter and require no protective finish. Of course, if you’ve always wished your kitchen counters were a bit higher or lower, you can simply add or subtract a few inches from the given dimension for the bench legs. You can also change the length of the bench to fit a small greenhouse, if necessary.

It actually combines two work benches in one: a regular waist- level bench to fill seed trays or pots and a longer, lower bench that can hold supplies or plants while still allowing a maximum of sunlight to reflect back and penetrate deeply into the greenhouse. As a plus, it’s constructed of materials that are ideal for the moisture-heavy environment and temperature fluctuations common to any greenhouse. What makes this potting bench different from most other potting benches is that the work surfaces are at appropriate heights for gardening tasks. The work surface is 30 inches high, making it easier to reach down into pots. The low work surface is just over a foot high, so you won’t have to lift heavy objects such as large pots or bags of soil. In addition to the high-low work surfaces, this bench also features a shelf and hook rail to keep small supplies and tools within reach, yet still off the main work area. A potting bench gets wet and it gets dirty, so rot- and moisture- resistant materials were chosen to build this bench. The frame is made with pressure-treated pine lumber, and the work surfaces are composite deck boards. The composite material provides a smooth surface that will not splinter and is easy to clean.

First, and most important, it moves the crop up and out of the way of rabbits, slugs, and other destructive pests. Second, it’s portable, so it can be moved to follow or avoid the sun, or brought into the garage on frosty nights. Third, it can be set up on convenient but barren spots like decks, patios, and driveways. Fourth, it allows you to garden at a comfortable height, saving wear and tear on knees and backs. Fifth, you can easily replace the growing media every year and precisely control moisture and fertilizer, giving you better, more predictable yields. And finally, it provides accessible gardening for those in wheelchairs. The frame of this lettuce table, which will be in contact with the soil, can be made from cedar, redwood, or any other naturally rot-resistant wood. It is left unfinished on the inside. Pressure-treated wood is used for the rest of the framework because it’s less expensive and will resist decay for decades. The galvanized hardware cloth across the bottom is an inexpensive way to support the weight of the soil; you can substitute cedar boards, galvanized metal flashing, or any other rot-res istant, nontoxic material that can hold the weight. No matter what you use to hold the weight, the soil is held in place with heavy- duty landscape fabric or aluminum screen mesh. Lettuce Table The lettuce table can be used to grow more than lettuce. It simply draws its name from its original purpose, which is to provide a shallow bed for growing lettuces in an easy-to-reach spot that can be moved easily around your yard.

The design showcases the wood in an incredibly useful greenhouse planter perfect for training edibles to grow vertically. Because the 2 × 2 lattice trellis is attached to the planter, not permanently fastened to a wall or railing, it can be moved easily to follow changing sunlight patterns within the greenhouse or even shuttled outside in warmer months to make room for other plants or just to give the planter’s occupants some outside exposure. You may even want to consider installing wheels or casters on the base for greater mobility. Building the trellis planter is a very simple job. The trellis portion is made entirely of strips of 2 × 2 cedar, fashioned together in a crosshatch pattern. The planter bin is a basic wood box, with panel sides and a two-board bottom with drainage holes that rests on a scalloped base. The trellis is screwed permanently to the back of the planter bin. All manner of plants can be grown vertically in a greenhouse environment, including some surprising candidates, such as tomatoes, zucchini, and even miniature melon varieties. By training edibles that normally sprawl to climb up the more orderly surface of a trellis like this, you’ll free up room in your greenhouse, make it easier to tend the growing plants, and increase airflow—preventing disease in the process.

Attach the side cleats flush with the tops of the side boards. Step 3: Build the Planter Base 1. The planter base is scalloped to create feet at th e corners. 2. Cut the base front and back (B) and the base ends (C) to length. To draw the contours for the scallops on the front and back boards, set the point of a compass at the bottom edge of the base front, 5\" in from one end. Set the compass to a 2½\" radius and draw a curve to mark the curved end of the cutout. Draw a straight line to connect the tops of the curves, 2½\" up from the bottom of the board, to complete the scalloped cutout. 3. Make the cutout with a jigsaw, then sand any rough spots. Use the board as a template for marking a matching cutout on the base back. 4. Draw a similar cutout on one base end, except with the point of the compass 3½\" in from the ends. Cut out both end pieces with a jigsaw. 5. Draw reference lines for wood screws ¾\" from the ends of the base front and back. Drill three evenly spaced pilot holes through the lines. Counterbore the holes. Fasten the base ends between the base front and back by driving three evenly spaced deck screws at each joint. Step 1: Build the Planter Bin 1. Cut the box slats (A) and cleats (L, M) to length. A rrange the slats edge-to-edge in two groups of four and two groups of two, with tops and bottoms flush. 2. Center a long cleat (L) at the top of each set of four slats, so the distance from each end of the cleat to the end of the panel is the same. Attach the cleats to the four-slat panels by driving 1 5 ⁄ 8 \" deck screws (photo 1) through the cleats and into the slats. 3. Lay the short cleats (M) at the tops of the two-slat panels. Attach them to the slats the same way. 4. Arrange all four panels into a box shape and apply moisture-resistant wood glue to the joints. Attach the panels by driving 1 5 ⁄ 8 \" deck screws through the four- slat panels and into the ends of the two-slat panels. Step 2: Install the Bin Bottom 1. Cut the bottom boards (N) to length. Set the bin ups ide down on your work surface, and mark reference lines on the inside faces of the panels, 7 ⁄ 8 \" in fr om the bottom of the bin. Insert the bottom boards into the bin, aligned with the reference lines to create a 7 ⁄ 8 \" recess. Scraps of 1× cedar can be put beneath the bottom boards as spacers. 2. Drill 1 ⁄ 8 \" pilot holes through the panels. Counterbore the holes slightly with a counterbore bit.

Lay the end posts and center post together side by side with their bottom edges flush so you can gang-mark the rail positions. 3. Use a square as a guide for drawing lines across all three posts, 18\" up from the bottom. Draw the next line 7½\" up from the first. Draw additional lines across the posts, spaced 7½\" apart. 4. Cut two 7\"-wide scrap blocks and use them to separate the posts as you assemble the trellis. Attach the rails to the posts in the sequence shown in the Diagram, using 2½\" screws (photo 4). Alternate from the fronts to the backs of the posts when installing the rails. Step 7: Apply Finishing Touches 1. Fasten the trellis to the back of the planter bin so th e bottoms of the posts rest on the top edge of the base. Drill pilot holes in the posts. Counterbore the holes. Drive 2½\" deck screws through the posts and into the cap frame. With a 1\"-diameter spade bit, drill a pair of drainage holes in each bottom board. Stain the project with an exterior wood stain. Step 4: Attach the Bin to the Base 1. Set the base frame and planter bin on their backs. P osition the planter bin inside the base so it extends 7 ⁄ 8 \" past the top of the base. 2. Drive 1 5 ⁄ 8 \" deck screws through the planter bin and into the base to secure the parts (photo 2). Step 5: Make the Cap Frame 1. Cut the cap front (D), cap ends (E), and cap back (F) to l ength. Cut 45° miters at one end of each cap end and at both ends of the cap front. 2. Join the mitered corners by drilling pilot holes through the joints (photo 3). Counterbore the holes. Fasten the pieces with glue and 2½\" deck screws. Clamp the cap front and cap ends to the front of your worktable to hold them while you drive the screws. 3. Fasten the cap back between the cap ends with deck screws, making sure the back edges are flush. Set the cap frame on the planter bin so the back edges are flush. Drill pilot holes and counterbore them. Drive 2½\" deck screws through the cap frame and into the side and end cleats. Step 6: Make the Trellis 1.

Planting in containers makes it possible to cultivate a garden just about anywhere. A container garden can be as simple as a small flowering annual planted in a single 4-inch pot or as elaborate as a variety of shrubs, flowering plants, and ornamental grasses planted in a large stationary planter. This planter project combines a couple of different container options to create a larger garden in a relatively small space. The base is an 18 × 30-inch planter box that is large enough to hold several small plants, a couple of medium-sized plants, or one large plant. It features a trellis back that can be covered by climbing plants. In addition to the planter and trellis, this project features two plant hangers that extend out from the back posts. Adding a couple of hanging plant baskets further extends the garden display without increasing the space taken up by the planter. This project is easiest to build with a table saw, miter saw, jigsaw, and drill/driver.

Finish the project by sliding the window sash into place. Drill three 1\" holes for ventilation in each 1 × 6\" board equally spaced along the length of the board, leaving 5\" of room on each end for the posts. Staple leftover insect mesh behind the ventilation holes on the inside of the frame. Assemble the box. Attach the wider boards for the frame by driving 2\" screws through the faces of the 1 × 8\" boards into the ends of the 1 × 6\" boards. There will be a difference in height between these pairs of boards so that the window sash can sit flush in the recess created.

Then, multiply that number by 5⁄9. For example, 77°F - 32 = 45. 45 × 5⁄9 = 25°C. To convert degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, multiply the Celsius temperature reading by 9⁄5. Then, add 32. For example, 25°C × 9⁄5 = 45. 45 + 32 = 77°F.

Common nails are best suited to framing work where strength is important. Box nails are smaller in diameter than common nails, which makes them easier to drive and less likely to split wood. Use box nails for light work and thin materials. Most common and box nails have a cement or vinyl coating that improves their holding power. LBS.
