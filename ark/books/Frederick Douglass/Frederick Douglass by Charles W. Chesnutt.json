Includes bibliographical references(p.).PrefaceFrederick Douglass lived so long, and played so conspicuous a part on theworld's stage, that it would be impossible, in a work of the size of this, to domore than touch upon the salient features of his career, to suggest the respectsin which he influenced the course of events in his lifetime, and to epitomizefor the readers of another generation the judgment of his contemporaries as tohis genius and his character.Douglass's fame as an orator has long been secure. His position as the championof an oppressed race, and at the same time an example of its possibilities, was,in his own generation, as picturesque as it was unique; and his life may servefor all time as an incentive to aspiring souls who would fight the battles andwin the love of mankind. The average American of to-day who sees, when hisattention is called to it, and deplores, if he be a thoughtful and just man, thedeep undertow of race prejudice that retards the progress of the colored peopleof our own generation, cannot, except by reading the painful records of thepast, conceive of the mental and spiritual darkness to which slavery, as theinexorable condition of its existence, condemned its victims and, in a lessmeasure, their oppressors, or of the blank wall of proscription and scorn bywhich free people of color were shut up in a moral and social Ghetto, the gatesof which have yet not been entirely torn down.From this night of slavery Douglass emerged, passed through the limbo ofprejudice which he encountered as a freeman, and took his place in history. \"Asfew of the world's great men have ever had so checkered and diversified acareer,\" says Henry Wilson, \"so it may at least be plausibly claimed that no manrepresents in himself more conflicting ideas and interests. His life is, initself, an epic which finds few to equal it in the realms of either romance orreality.\" It was, after all, no misfortune for humanity that Frederick Douglassfelt the iron hand of slavery; for his genius changed the drawbacks of color andcondition into levers by which he raised himself and his people.The materials for this work have been near at hand, though there is a vastamount of which lack of space must prevent the use. Acknowledgment is here madeto members of the Douglass family for aid in securing the photograph from whichthe frontispiece is reproduced.The more the writer has studied the records of Douglass's life, the more it hasappealed to his imagination and his heart. He can claim no special qualificationfor this task, unless perhaps it be a profound and in some degree a personalsympathy with every step of Douglass's upward career. Belonging to a latergeneration, he was only privileged to see the man and hear the orator after hislife-work was substantially completed, but often enough then to appreciatesomething of the strength and eloquence by which he impressed hiscontemporaries. If by this brief sketch the writer can revive among the readersof another generation a tithe of the interest that Douglass created for himselfwhen he led the forlorn hope of his race for freedom and opportunity, his laborwill be amply repaid.Charles W.

Such a man was Frederick Douglass,and the example of one who thus rose to eminence by sheer force of character andtalents that neither slavery nor caste proscription could crush must ever remainas a shining illustration of the essential superiority of manhood toenvironment. Circumstances made Frederick Douglass a slave, but they could notprevent him from becoming a freeman and a leader among mankind.The early life of Douglass, as detailed by himself from the platform in vigorousand eloquent speech, and as recorded in the three volumes written by himself atdifferent periods of his career, is perhaps the completest indictment of theslave system ever presented at the bar of public opinion. Fanny Kemble's Journalof a Residence on a Georgian Plantation, kept by her in the very year ofDouglass's escape from bondage, but not published until 1863, too late tocontribute anything to the downfall of slavery, is a singularly clear revelationof plantation life from the standpoint of an outsider entirely unbiased byAmerican prejudice. Frederick Douglass's Narrative is the same story told fromthe inside. They coincide in the main facts; and in the matter of detail, likethe two slightly differing views of a stereoscopic picture, they bring out intobold relief the real character of the peculiar institution. Uncle Tom's Cabinlent to the structure of fact the decorations of humor, a dramatic plot, andcharacters to whose fate the touch of creative genius gave a living interest.But, after all, it was not Uncle Tom, nor Topsy, nor Miss Ophelia, nor Eliza,nor little Eva that made the book the power it proved to stir the hearts of men,but the great underlying tragedy then already rapidly approaching a bloodyclimax.Frederick Douglass was born in February, l8l7,—as nearly as the date could bedetermined in after years, when it became a matter of public interest,—atTuckahoe, near Easton, Talbot County, on the eastern shore of Maryland, a barrenand poverty-stricken district, which possesses in the birth of Douglass its soletitle to distinction. His mother was a negro slave, tall, erect, andwell-proportioned, of a deep black and glossy complexion, with regular features,and manners of a natural dignity and sedateness. Though a field hand andcompelled to toil many hours a day, she had in some mysterious way learned toread, being the only person of color in Tuckahoe, slave or free, who possessedthat accomplishment. His father was a white man. It was in the nature of thingsthat in after years attempts should be made to analyze the sources of Douglass'stalent, and that the question should be raised whether he owed it to the blackor the white half of his mixed ancestry. But Douglass himself, who knew his ownmother and grandmother, ascribed such powers as he possessed to the negro halfof his blood; and, as to it certainly he owed the experience which gave hisanti-slavery work its peculiar distinction and value, he doubtless believed itonly fair that the credit for what he accomplished should go to those who neededit most and could justly be proud of it. He never knew with certainty who hiswhite father was, for the exigencies of slavery separated the boy from hismother before the subject of his paternity became of interest to him; and inafter years his white father never claimed the honor, which might have given hima place in history.Douglass's earliest recollections centered around the cabin of his grandmother,Betsey Bailey, who seems to have been something of a privileged character on theplantation, being permitted to live with her husband, Isaac, in a cabin of theirown, charged with only the relatively light duty of looking after a number ofyoung children, mostly the offspring of her own five daughters, and providingfor her own support.It is impossible in a work of the scope of this to go into very elaborate detailwith reference to this period of Douglass's life, however interesting it mightbe. The real importance of his life to us of another generation lies in what heaccomplished toward the world's progress, which he only began to influenceseveral years after his escape from slavery. Enough ought to be stated, however,to trace his development from slave to freeman, and his preparation for theplatform where he secured his hearing and earned his fame.Douglass was born the slave of one Captain Aaron Anthony, a man of someconsequence in eastern Maryland, the manager or chief clerk of one ColonelLloyd, the head for that generation of an old, exceedingly wealthy, and highlyhonored family in Maryland, the possessor of a stately mansion and one of thelargest and most fertile plantations in the State. Captain Anthony, though onlythe satellite of this great man, himself owned several farms and a number ofslaves. At the age of seven Douglass was taken from the cabin of his grandmotherat Tuckahoe to his masters residence on Colonel Lloyd's plantation.Up to this time he had never, to his recollection, seen his mother. All hisimpressions of her were derived from a few brief visits made to him at ColonelLloyd's plantation, most of them at night. These fleeting visits of the motherwere important events in the life of the child, now no longer under the care ofhis grandmother, but turned over to the tender mercies of his master's cook,with whom he does not seem to have been a favorite. His mother died when he waseight or nine years old. Her son did not see her during her illness, nor learnof it until after her death. It was always a matter of grief to him that he didnot know her better, and that he could not was one of the sins of slavery thathe never forgave.On Colonel Lloyd's plantation Douglass spent four years of the slave life ofwhich his graphic description on the platform stirred humane hearts to righteousjudgment of an unrighteous institution. It is enough to say that this lad, withkeen eyes and susceptible feelings, was an eye-witness of all the evils to whichslavery gave birth. Its extremes of luxury and misery could be found within thelimits of one estate. He saw the field hand driven forth at dawn to labor untildark. He beheld every natural affection crushed when inconsistent with slavery,or warped and distorted to fit the necessities and promote the interests of theinstitution. He heard the unmerited strokes of the lash on the backs of others,and felt them on his own. In the wild songs of the slaves he read, beneath theirsenseless jargon or their fulsome praise of \"old master,\" the often unconsciousnote of grief and despair. He perceived, too, the debasing effects of slaveryupon master and slave alike, crushing all semblance of manhood in the one, andin the other substituting passion for judgment, caprice for justice, andindolence and effeminacy for the more virile virtues of freemen. Doubtless thegentle hand of time will some time spread the veil of silence over this painfulpast; but, while we are still gathering its evil aftermath, it is well enoughthat we do not forget the origin of so many of our civic problems.When Douglass was ten years old, he was sent from the Lloyd plantation toBaltimore, to live with one Hugh Auld, a relative of his master. Here he enjoyedthe high privilege, for a slave, of living in the house with his master'sfamily. In the capacity of house boy it was his duty to run errands and takecare of a little white boy, Tommy Auld, the son of his mistress for the timebeing, Mrs. Sophia Auld. Mrs. Auld was of a religious turn of mind; and, fromhearing her reading the Bible aloud frequently, curiosity prompted the boy toask her to teach him to read. She complied, and found him an apt pupil, untilher husband learned of her unlawful and dangerous conduct, and put an end to theinstruction. But the evil was already done, and the seed thus sown brought forthfruit in the after career of the orator and leader of men. The mere fact thathis master wished to prevent his learning made him all the more eager to acquireknowledge. In after years, even when most bitter in his denunciation of thepalpable evils of slavery, Douglass always acknowledged the debt he owed to thisgood lady who innocently broke the laws and at the same time broke the chainsthat held a mind in bondage.Douglass lived in the family of Hugh Auld at Baltimore for seven years. Duringthis time the achievement that had the greatest influence upon his future washis learning to read and write. His mistress had given him a start. His ownefforts gained the rest. He carried in his pocket a blue-backed Webster'sSpelling Book, and, as occasion offered, induced his young white playmates, bythe bribes of childhood, to give him lessons in spelling. When he was aboutthirteen, he began to feel deeply the moral yoke of slavery and to seek forknowledge of the means to escape it. One book seems to have had a markedinfluence upon his life at this epoch. He obtained, somehow, a copy of TheColumbian Orator, containing some of the choicest masterpieces of Englishoratory, in which he saw liberty praised and oppression condemned; and theglowing periods of Pitt and Fox and Sheridan and our own Patrick Henry stirredto life in the heart of this slave boy the genius for oratory which did notburst forth until years afterward. The worldly wisdom of denying to slaves thekey to knowledge is apparent when it is said that Douglass first learned from anewspaper that there were such people as abolitionists, who were opposed tohuman bondage and sought to make all men free. At about this same periodDouglass's mind fell under religious influences. He was converted, professedfaith in Jesus Christ, and began to read the Bible. He had dreamed of libertybefore; he now prayed for it, and trusted in God. But, with the shrewd commonsense which marked his whole life and saved it from shipwreck in more than oneinstance, he never forgot that God helps them that help themselves, and so nevermissed an opportunity to acquire the knowledge that would prepare him forfreedom and give him the means of escape from slavery.Douglass had learned to read, partly from childish curiosity and the desire tobe able to do what others around him did; but it was with a definite end in viewthat he learned to write. By the slave code it was unlawful for a slave to gobeyond the limits of his own neighborhood without the written permission of hismaster. Douglass's desire to write grew mainly out of the fact that in order toescape from bondage, which he had early determined to do, he would probably needsuch a \"pass,\" as this written permission was termed, and could write it himselfif he but knew how. His master for the time being kept a ship-yard, and in thisand neighboring establishments of the same kind the boy spent much of his time.He noticed that the carpenters, after dressing pieces of timber, marked themwith certain letters to indicate their positions in the vessel. By askingquestions of the workmen he learned the names of these letters and theirsignificance. He got up writing matches with sticks upon the ground with thelittle white boys, copied the italics in his spelling-book, and in the secrecyof the attic filled up all the blank spaces of his young master's oldcopy-books. In time he learned to write, and thus again demonstrated the powerof the mind to overleap the bounds that men set for it and work out the destinyto which God designs it.II.It was the curious fate of Douglass to pass through almost every phase ofslavery, as though to prepare him the more thoroughly for his future career.Shortly after he went to Baltimore, his master, Captain Anthony, died intestate,and his property was divided between his two children. Douglass, with the otherslaves, was part of the personal estate, and was sent for to be appraised anddisposed of in the division. He fell to the share of Mrs. Lucretia Auld, hismasters daughter, who sent him back to Baltimore, where, after a month'sabsence, he resumed his life in the household of Mrs. Hugh Auld, thesister-in-law of his legal mistress. Owing to a family misunderstanding, he wastaken, in March, 1833, from Baltimore back to St. Michaels.His mistress, Lucretia Auld, had died in the mean time; and the new household inwhich he found himself, with Thomas Auld and his second wife, Rowena, at itshead, was distinctly less favorable to the slave boy's comfort than the homewhere he had lived in Baltimore. Here he saw hardships of the life in bondagethat had been less apparent in a large city. It is to be feared that Douglasswas not the ideal slave, governed by the meek and lowly spirit of Uncle Tom. Heseems, by his own showing, to have manifested but little appreciation of thewise oversight, the thoughtful care, and the freedom from responsibility withwhich slavery claimed to hedge round its victims, and he was inclined to spurnthe rod rather than to kiss it. A tendency to insubordination, due partly to thefreer life he had led in Baltimore, got him into disfavor with a master easilydispleased; and, not proving sufficiently amenable to the discipline of the homeplantation, he was sent to a certain celebrated negro-breaker by the name ofEdward Covey, one of the poorer whites who, as overseers and slave-catchers, andin similar unsavory capacities, earned a living as parasites on the system ofslavery. Douglass spent a year under Coveys ministrations, and his life theremay be summed up in his own words: \"I had neither sufficient time in which toeat nor to sleep, except on Sundays. The overwork and the brutal chastisementsof which I was the victim, combined with that ever-gnawing and soul-destroyingthought, 'I am a slave,—a slave for life,' rendered me a living embodiment ofmental and physical wretchedness.\"But even all this did not entirely crush the indomitable spirit of a mandestined to achieve his own freedom and thereafter to help win freedom for arace. In August, 1834, after a particularly atrocious beating, which left himwounded and weak from loss of blood, Douglass escaped the vigilance of theslave-breaker and made his way back to his own master to seek protection. Themaster, who would have lost his slave's wages for a year if he had broken thecontract with Covey before the year's end, sent Douglass back to his taskmaster.Anticipating the most direful consequences, Douglass made the desperateresolution to resist any further punishment at Covey's hands. After a fight oftwo hours Covey gave up his attempt to whip Frederick, and thenceforth laidhands on him no more. That Covey did not invoke the law, which made death thepunishment of the slave who resisted his master, was probably due to shame athaving been worsted by a negro boy, or to the prudent consideration that therewas no profit to be derived from a dead negro. Strength of character,re-enforced by strength of muscle, thus won a victory over brute force thatsecured for Douglass comparative immunity from abuse during the remaining monthsof his year's service with Covey.The next year, 1835, Douglass was hired out to a Mr. William Freeland, who livednear St. Michael's, a gentleman who did not forget justice or humanity, so faras they were consistent with slavery, even in dealing with bond-servants. HereDouglass led a comparatively comfortable life. He had enough to eat, was notoverworked, and found the time to conduct a surreptitious Sunday-school, wherehe tried to help others by teaching his fellow-slaves to read the Bible.III.The manner of Douglass's escape from Maryland was never publicly disclosed byhim until the war had made slavery a memory and the slave-catcher a thing of thepast. It was the theory of the anti-slavery workers of the time that thepublication of the details of escapes or rescues from bondage seldom reached theears of those who might have learned thereby to do likewise, but merelyfurnished the master class with information that would render other escapes moredifficult and bring suspicion or punishment upon those who had assistedfugitives. That this was no idle fear there is abundant testimony in the annalsof the period. But in later years, when there was no longer any danger ofunpleasant consequences, and when it had become an honor rather than a disgraceto have assisted a distressed runaway, Douglass published in detail the story ofhis flight. It would not compare in dramatic interest with many other celebratedescapes from slavery or imprisonment. He simply masqueraded as a sailor,borrowed a sailors \"protection,\" or certificate that he belonged to the navy,took the train to Baltimore in the evening, and rode in the negro car until hereached New York City. There were many anxious moments during this journey. The\"protection\" he carried described a man somewhat different from him, but theconductor did not examine it carefully. Fear clutched at the fugitive's heartwhenever he neared a State border line. He saw several persons whom he knew;but, if they recognized him or suspected his purpose, they made no sign. Alittle boldness, a little address, and a great deal of good luck carried himsafely to his journey's end.Douglass arrived in New York on September 4, 1838, having attained only a fewmonths before what would have been in a freeman his legal majority. But, thoughlanded in a free State, he was by no means a free man. He was still a piece ofproperty, and could be reclaimed by the law's aid if his whereabouts werediscovered. While local sentiment at the North afforded a measure of protectionto fugitives, and few were ever returned to bondage compared with the numberthat escaped, yet the fear of recapture was ever with them, darkening theirlives and impeding their pursuit of happiness.But even the partial freedom Douglass had achieved gave birth to a thousanddelightful sensations. In his autobiography he describes this dawn of libertythus:\"A new world had opened up to me. I lived more in one day than in a year of myslave life. I felt as one might feel upon escape from a den of hungry lions. Mychains were broken, and the victory brought me unspeakable joy.\"But one cannot live long on joy; and, while his chains were broken, he was notbeyond the echo of their clanking. He met on the streets, within a few hoursafter his arrival in New York, a man of his own color, who informed him that NewYork was full of Southerners at that season of the year, and that slave-huntersand spies were numerous, that old residents of the city were not safe, and thatany recent fugitive was in imminent danger. After this cheerful communicationDouglass's informant left him, evidently fearing that Douglass himself might bea slave-hunting spy. There were negroes base enough to play this role. In asailor whom he encountered he found a friend. This Good Samaritan took him homefor the night, and accompanied him next day to a Mr. David Ruggles, a coloredman, the secretary of the New York Vigilance Committee and an active antislaveryworker. Mr. Ruggles kept him concealed for several days, during which time thewoman Douglass loved, a free woman, came on from Baltimore; and they weremarried. He had no money in his pocket, and nothing to depend upon but hishands, which doubtless seemed to him quite a valuable possession, as he knewthey had brought in an income of several hundred dollars a year to their formerowner.Douglass's new friends advised him to go to New Bedford, Massachusetts, wherewhaling fleets were fitted out, and where he might hope to find work at histrade of ship-calker. It was believed, too, that he would be safer there, as theanti-slavery sentiment was considered too strong to permit a fugitive slave'sbeing returned to the South.When Douglass, accompanied by his wife, arrived in New Bedford, a Mr. NathanJohnson, a colored man to whom he had been recommended, received him kindly,gave him shelter and sympathy, and lent him a small sum of money to redeem hismeagre baggage, which had been held by the stage-driver as security for anunpaid balance of the fare to New Bedford. In his autobiography Douglasscommends Mr. Johnson for his \"noble-hearted hospitality and manly character.\"In New York Douglass had changed his name in order the better to hide hisidentity from any possible pursuer. Douglass's name was another tie that boundhim to his race. He has been called \"Douglass\" by the writer because that wasthe name he took for himself, as he did his education and his freedom; and as\"Douglass\" he made himself famous. As a slave, he was legally entitled to butone name,—Frederick. From his grandfather, Isaac Bailey, a freeman, he hadderived the surname Bailey. His mother, with unconscious sarcasm, had called thelittle slave boy Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey. The bearer of thisimposing string of appellations had, with a finer sense of fitness, cut it downto Frederick Bailey. In New York he had called himself Frederick Johnson; but,finding when he reached New Bedford that a considerable portion of the coloredpopulation of the city already rejoiced in this familiar designation, he fell inwith the suggestion of his host, who had been reading Scott's Lady of the Lake,and traced an analogy between the runaway slave and the fugitive chieftain, thatthe new freeman should call himself Douglass, after the noble Scot of that name[Douglas]. The choice proved not inappropriate, for this modern Douglass foughtas valiantly in his own cause and with his own weapons as ever any Douglass[Douglas] fought with flashing steel in border foray.Here, then, in a New England town, Douglass began the life of a freeman, fromwhich, relieved now of the incubus of slavery, he soon emerged into the careerfor which, in the providence of God, he seemed by his multiform experience tohave been especially fitted. He did not find himself, even in Massachusetts,quite beyond the influence of slavery. While before the law of the State he wasthe equal of any other man, caste prejudice prevented him from finding work athis trade of calker; and he therefore sought employment as a laborer. This hefound easily, and for three years worked at whatever his hands found to do. Thehardest toil was easy to him, the heaviest burdens were light; for the moneythat he earned went into his own pocket. If it did not remain there long, he atleast had the satisfaction of spending it and of enjoying what it purchased.During these three years he was learning the lesson of liberty and unconsciouslycontinuing his training for the work of an anti-slavery agitator. He became asubscriber to the Liberator, each number of which he devoured with eagerness. Heheard William Lloyd Garrison lecture, and became one of his most devoteddisciples. He attended every anti-slavery meeting in New Bedford, and now andthen spoke on the subject of slavery in humble gatherings of his own people.IVIn 1841 Douglass entered upon that epoch of his life which brought the hithertoobscure refugee prominently before the public, and in which his services asanti-slavery orator and reformer constitute his chief claim to enduringrecollection. Millions of negroes whose lives had been far less bright thanDouglass's had lived and died in slavery. Thousands of fugitives under assumednames were winning a precarious livelihood in the free States and trembling inconstant fear of the slave-catcher. Some of these were doing noble work inassisting others to escape from bondage. Mr. Siebert, in his UndergroundRailroad, mentions one fugitive slave, John Mason by name, who assisted thirteenhundred others to escape from Kentucky. Another picturesque fugitive was HarrietTubman, who devoted her life to this work with a courage, skill, and successthat won her a wide reputation among the friends of freedom. A number of freecolored men in the North, a few of them wealthy and cultivated, lent their timeand their means to this cause. But it was reserved for Douglass, by virtue ofhis marvellous gift of oratory, to become pre-eminently the personalrepresentative of his people for a generation.In 1841 the Massachusetts Anti-slavery Society, which had been for some littletime weakened by faction, arranged its differences, and entered upon a campaignof unusual activity, which found expression in numerous meetings throughout thefree States, mainly in New England. On August 15 of that year a meeting was heldat Nantucket, Massachusetts. The meeting was conducted by John A. Collins, atthat time general agent of the society, and was addressed by William LloydGarrison and other leading abolitionists. Douglass had taken a holiday and comefrom New Bedford to attend this convention, without the remotest thought oftaking part except as a spectator. The proceedings were interesting, and arousedthe audience to a high state of feeling. There was present in the meeting acertain abolitionist, by name William C. Coffin, who had heard Douglass speak inthe little negro Sunday-school at New Bedford, and who knew of his recent escapefrom slavery. To him came the happy inspiration to ask Douglass to speak a fewwords to the convention by way of personal testimony. Collins introduced thespeaker as \"a graduate from slavery, with his diploma written upon his back.\"Douglass himself speaks very modestly about this, his first public appearance.He seems, from his own account, to have suffered somewhat from stage fright,which was apparently his chief memory concerning it. The impressions of others,however, allowing a little for the enthusiasm of the moment, are a safer guideas to the effect of Douglass's first speech. Parker Pillsbury reported that,\"though it was late in the evening when the young man closed his remarks, noneseemed to know or care for the hour…. The crowded congregation had been wroughtup almost to enchantment during the whole long evening, particularly by some ofthe utterances of the last speaker [Douglass], as he turned over the terribleapocalypse of his experience in slavery.\" Mr. Garrison bore testimony to \"theextraordinary emotion it exerted on his own mind and to the powerful impressionit exerted upon a crowded auditory.\" \"Patrick Henry,\" he declared, \"had nevermade a more eloquent speech than the one they had just listened to from the lipsof the hunted fugitive.\" Upon Douglass and his speech as a text Mr. Garrisondelivered one of the sublimest and most masterly efforts of his life; and thenand there began the friendship between the fugitive slave and the great agitatorwhich opened the door for Douglass to a life of noble usefulness, and secured tothe anti-slavery cause one of its most brilliant and effective orators.At Garrison's instance Collins offered Douglass employment as lecturer for theAnti-slavery Society, though the idea of thus engaging him doubtless occurred tomore than one of the abolition leaders who heard his Nantucket speech. Douglasswas distrustful of his own powers. Only three years out of slavery, with littlelearning and no experience as a public speaker, painfully aware of the prejudicewhich must be encountered by men of his color, fearful too of the publicity thatmight reveal his whereabouts to his legal owner, who might reclaim his propertywherever found, he yielded only reluctantly to Mr. Collins's proposition, andagreed at first upon only a three months' term of service.Most of the abolitionists were, or meant to be, consistent in their practice ofwhat they preached; and so, when Douglass was enrolled as one of the little bandof apostles, they treated him literally as a man and a brother. Their homes,their hearts, and their often none too well-filled purses were open to him. Inthis new atmosphere his mind expanded, his spirit took on high courage, and heread and studied diligently, that he might make himself worthy of hisopportunity to do something for his people.During the remainder of 1841 Douglass travelled and lectured in EasternMassachusetts with George Foster, in the interest of the two leading abolitionjournals, the Anti-slavery Standard and the Liberator, and also lectured inRhode Island against the proposed Dorr constitution, which sought to limit theright of suffrage to white male citizens only, thus disfranchising colored menwho had theretofore voted. With Foster and Pillsbury and Parker[1] and Monroe[2]and Abby Kelly [Kelley][3] he labored to defeat the Dorr constitution and at thesame time promote the abolition gospel. The proposed constitution was defeated,and colored men who could meet the Rhode Island property qualification were leftin possession of the right to vote.[Footnote 1: Editor's Note to Dover Edition: Reverend Theodore Parker(1810-1860) was a Unitarian minister who graduated from the Harvard DivinitySchool and was active in the Boston area.][Footnote 2: Editor's Note to Dover Edition: James Monroe (1821-1898), a NewEnglander with a Quaker mother; in 1839 he became an Abolitionist lecturerinstead of enrolling in college.][Footnote 3: Editor's Note to Dover Edition: Abigail Kelley Foster (1811-1887),who married another Abolitionist, Stephen Foster, in 1845, was a Quaker oratorand organizer on behalf of the abolition of slavery and for women's right tovote.]Douglass had plunged into this new work, after the first embarrassment wore off,with all the enthusiasm of youth and hope. But, except among the little band ofGarrisonians and their sympathizers, his position did not relieve him from thedisabilities attaching to his color. The feeling toward the negro in New Englandin 1841 was but little different from that in the State of Georgia to-day. Menof color were regarded and treated as belonging to a distinctly inferior orderof creation. At hotels and places of public resort they were refusedentertainment. On railroads and steamboats they were herded off by themselves inmean and uncomfortable cars. If welcomed in churches at all, they were carefullyrestricted to the negro pew. As in the Southern States to-day, no distinctionwas made among them in these respects by virtue of dress or manners or cultureor means; but all were alike discriminated against because of their dark skins.Some of Douglass's abolition friends, among whom he especially mentions WendellPhillips and two others of lesser note, won their way to his heart by at alltimes refusing to accept privileges that were denied to their swarthy companion.Douglass resented proscription wherever met with, and resisted it with forcewhen the odds were not too overwhelming. More than once he was beaten andmaltreated by railroad conductors and brakemen. For a time the Eastern Railroadran its cars through Lynn, Massachusetts, without stopping, because Douglass,who resided at that time in Lynn, insisted on riding in the white people's car,and made trouble when interfered with. Often it was impossible for theabolitionists to secure a meeting-place; and in several instances Douglassparaded the streets with a bell, like a town crier, to announce that he wouldlecture in the open air.Some of Douglass's friends, it must be admitted, were at times rather extreme intheir language, and perhaps stirred up feelings that a more temperate vocabularywould not have aroused. None of them ever hesitated to call a spade a spade, andsome of them denounced slavery and all its sympathizers with the vigor andpicturesqueness of a Muggletonian or Fifth Monarchy man of Cromwell's timeexecrating his religious adversaries. And, while it was true enough that theChurch and the State were, generally speaking, the obsequious tools of slavery,it was not easy for an abolitionist to say so in vehement language withoutincurring the charge of treason or blasphemy,—an old trick of bigotry andtyranny to curb freedom of thought and freedom of speech. The little personalidiosyncrasies which some of the reformers affected, such as long hair in themen and short hair in the women,—there is surely some psychological reason whyreformers run to such things,—served as convenient excuses for gibes andunseemly interruptions at their public meetings. On one memorable occasion, atSyracuse, New York, in November, 1842, Douglass and his fellows narrowly escapedtar and feathers. But, although Douglass was vehemently denunciatory of slaveryin all its aspects, his twenty years of training in that hard school haddeveloped in him a vein of prudence that saved him from these verbalexcesses,—perhaps there was also some element of taste involved,—and thus madehis arguments more effective than if he had alienated his audiences byindiscriminate attacks on all the institutions of society. No one could justlyaccuse Frederick Douglass of cowardice or self-seeking; yet he was opportunistenough to sacrifice the immaterial for the essential, and to use the best meansat hand to promote the ultimate object sought, although the means thus offeredmight not be the ideal instrument. It was doubtless this trait that ledDouglass, after he separated from his abolitionist friends, to modify his viewsupon the subject of disunion and the constitutionality of slavery, and tosupport political parties whose platforms by no means expressed the full measureof his convictions.In 1843 the New England Anti-slavery Society resolved, at its annual meeting inthe spring, to stir the Northern heart and rouse the national conscience by aseries of one hundred conventions in New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, Ohio,Indiana, and Pennsylvania. Douglass was assigned as one of the agents for theconduct of this undertaking. Among those associated in this work, which extendedover five months, were John A. Collins, the president of the society, who mappedout the campaign; James Monroe; George Bradburn; William A. White; Charles L.Remond, a colored orator, born in Massachusetts, who rendered effective servicein the abolition cause; and Sidney Howard Gay, at that time managing editor ofthe National Anti-slavery Standard and later of the New York Tribune and the NewYork Evening Post.The campaign upon which this little band of missionaries set out was noinconsiderable one. They were not going forth to face enthusiastic crowds ofsupporters, who would meet them with brass bands and shouts of welcome. Theywere more likely to be greeted with hisses and cat-calls, sticks and stones,stale eggs and decayed cabbages, hoots and yells of derision, and decorations oftar and feathers.In some towns of Vermont slanderous reports were made in advance of theirarrival, their characters were assailed, and their aims and objectsmisrepresented. In Syracuse, afterward distinguished for its strong anti-slaverysentiment, the abolitionists were compelled to hold their meetings in the publicpark, from inability to procure a house in which to speak; and only after theirconvention was well under way were they offered the shelter of a dilapidated andabandoned church. In Rochester they met with a more hospitable reception. Theindifference of Buffalo so disgusted Douglass's companions that they shook thedust of the city from their feet, and left Douglass, who was accustomed tocoldness and therefore undaunted by it, to tread the wine-press alone. He spokein an old post-office for nearly a week, to such good purpose that a church wasthrown open to him; and on a certain Sunday, in the public park, he held andthrilled by his eloquence an audience of five thousand people.On leaving Buffalo, Douglass joined the other speakers, and went with them toClinton County, Ohio, where, under a large tent, a mass meeting was held ofabolitionists who had come from widely scattered points. During an excursionmade about this time to Pennsylvania to attend a convention at Norristown, anattempt was made to lynch him at Manayunk; but his usual good fortune servedhim, and he lived to be threatened by higher powers than a pro-slavery mob.When the party of reformers reached Indiana, where the pro-slavery spirit wasalways strong, the State having been settled largely by Southerners, theircampaign of education became a running fight, in which Douglass, whose dark skinattracted most attention, often got more than his share. His strength andaddress brought him safely out of many an encounter; but in a struggle with amob at Richmond, Indiana, he was badly beaten and left unconscious on theground. A good Quaker took him home in his wagon, his wife bound up Douglass'swounds and nursed him tenderly,—the Quakers were ever the consistent friends offreedom,—but for the lack of proper setting he carried to the grave a stiff handas the result of this affray. He had often been introduced to audiences as \"agraduate from slavery with his diploma written upon his back\": from Indiana hereceived the distinction of a post-graduate degree.V.It can easily be understood that such a man as Douglass, thrown thus intostimulating daily intercourse with some of the brightest minds of hisgeneration, all animated by a high and noble enthusiasm for liberty andhumanity,—such men as Garrison and Phillips and Gay and Monroe and manyothers,—should have developed with remarkable rapidity those reserves ofcharacter and intellect which slavery had kept in repression. And yet, whileaware of his wonderful talent for oratory, he never for a moment let thisknowledge turn his head or obscure the consciousness that he had brought withhim out of slavery of some of the disabilities of that status. Naturally, hisexpanding intelligence sought a wider range of expression; and his simplenarrative of the wrongs of slavery gave way sometimes to a discussion of itsphilosophy. His abolitionist friends would have preferred him to stick a littlemore closely to the old line,—to furnish the experience while they provided theargument. But the strong will that slavery had not been able to break was notalways amenable to politic suggestion. Douglass's style and vocabulary and logicimproved so rapidly that people began to question his having been a slave. Hisappearance, speech, and manner differed so little in material particulars fromthose of his excellent exemplars that many people were sceptical of hisantecedents. Douglass had, since his escape from slavery, carefully kept silentabout the place he came from and his master's name and the manner of his escape,for the very good reason that their revelation would have informed his master ofhis whereabouts and rendered his freedom precarious; for the fugitive slave lawwas in force, and only here and there could local public sentiment haveprevented its operation. Confronted with the probability of losing hisusefulness, as the \"awful example,\" Douglass took the bold step of publishing inthe spring of 1845 the narrative of his experience as a slave, giving names ofpeople and places, and dates as nearly as he could recall them. His abolitionistfriends doubted the expediency of this step; and Wendell Phillips advised him tothrow the manuscript into the fire, declaring that the government ofMassachusetts had neither the power nor the will to protect him from theconsequences of his daring.The pamphlet was widely read. It was written in a style of graphic simplicity,and was such an exposé of slavery as exasperated its jealous supporters andbeneficiaries. Douglass soon had excellent reasons to fear that he would berecaptured by force or guile and returned to slavery or a worse fate. Theprospect was not an alluring one; and hence, to avoid an involuntary visit tothe scenes of his childhood, he sought liberty beyond the sea, where men of hiscolor have always enjoyed a larger freedom than in their native land.In 1845 Douglass set sail for England on board the Cambria, of the Cunard Line,accompanied by James N. Buffum, a prominent abolitionist of Lynn, Massachusetts.On the same steamer were the Hutchinson family, who lent their sweet songs tothe anti-slavery crusade. Douglass's color rendered him ineligible for cabinpassage, and he was relegated to the steerage. Nevertheless, he became quite thelion of the vessel, made the steerage fashionable, was given the freedom of theship, and invited to lecture on slavery. This he did to the satisfaction of allthe passengers except a few young men from New Orleans and Georgia, who, true tothe instincts of their caste, made his strictures on the South a personalmatter, and threatened to throw him overboard. Their zeal was diminished by anorder of the captain to put them in irons. They sulked in their cabins, however,and rushed into print when they reached Liverpool, thus giving Douglass the veryintroduction he needed to the British public, which was promptly informed, byhimself and others, of the true facts in regard to the steamer speech and thespeaker.VI.The two years Douglass spent in Great Britain upon this visit were active andfruitful ones, and did much to bring him to that full measure of developmentscarcely possible for him in slave-ridden America. For while the Englishgovernment had fostered slavery prior to the Revolution, and had only a fewyears before Douglass's visit abolished it in its own colonies, this wretchedsystem had never fastened its clutches upon the home islands. Slaves had beenbrought to England, it is true, and carried away; but, when the right to removethem was questioned in court, Lord Chief Justice Mansfield, with an abundance ofargument and precedent to support a position similar to that of Justice Taney inthe Dred Scott case, had taken the contrary view, and declared that the air ofEngland was free, and the slave who breathed it but once ceased thereby to be aslave. History and humanity have delivered their verdict on these two decisions,and time is not likely to disturb it.A few days after landing at Liverpool, Douglass went to Ireland, where theagitation for the repeal of the union between Great Britain and Ireland was infull swing, under the leadership of Daniel O'Connell, the great Irish orator.O'Connell had denounced slavery in words of burning eloquence. The Garrisonianabolitionists advocated the separation of the free and slave States as the onlymeans of securing some part of the United States to freedom. The American andIrish disunionists were united by a strong bond of sympathy. Douglass was soonreferred to as \"the black O'Connell,\" and lectured on slavery and on temperanceto large and enthusiastic audiences. He was introduced to O'Connell, andexchanged compliments with him. A public breakfast was given him at Cork, and asoiree by Father Matthew, the eminent leader of the great temperance crusadewhich at that time shared with the repeal agitation the public interest ofIreland. A reception to Douglass and his friend Buffum was held in St. PatricksTemperance Hall, where they were greeted with a special song of welcome, writtenfor the occasion. On January 6, 1846, a public breakfast was given Douglass atBelfast, at which the local branch of the British and Foreign Anti-slaverySociety presented him with a Bible bound in gold.After four months in Ireland, where he delivered more than fifty lectures,Douglass and his friend Buffum left Ireland, on January 10, 1846, for Scotland,where another important reform was in progress. It was an epoch of rebellionagainst the established order of things. The spirit of revolt was in the air.The disruption movement in the Established Church of Scotland, led by the famousDr. Chalmers, had culminated in 1843 in the withdrawal of four hundred andseventy ministers, who gave up the shelter and security of the Establishment forthe principle that a congregation should choose its own pastor, and organizedthemselves into the Free Protesting Church, commonly called the Free Kirk. Anappeal had been issued to the Presbyterian churches of the world for aid toestablish a sustentation fund for the use of the new church. Among thecontributions from the United States was one from a Presbyterian church inCharleston, South Carolina. Just before this contribution arrived a SouthCarolina judge had condemned a Northern man to death for aiding the escape of afemale slave. This incident had aroused horror and indignation throughout GreatBritain. Lord Brougham had commented on it in the House of Lords, and Lord ChiefJustice Denham had characterized it \"in the name of all the judges of England\"as a \"horrible iniquity.\" O'Connell had rejected profferred contributions fromthe Southern States, and an effort was made in Scotland to have the SouthCarolina money sent back. The attempt failed ultimately; but the agitation onthe subject was for a time very fierce, and gave Douglass and his friends theopportunity to strike many telling blows at slavery. He had never minced hiswords in the United States, and he now handled without gloves the governmentwhose laws had driven him from its borders.From Scotland Douglass went to England, where he found still another greatreform movement nearing a triumphant conclusion. The Anti-corn Law League, aftermany years of labor, under the leadership of Richard Cobden and John Bright, forthe abolition of the protective tariff on wheat and other kinds of grain forfood, had brought its agitation to a successful issue; and on June 26, 1846, theCorn Laws were repealed. The generous enthusiasm for reform of one kind oranother that pervaded the British Islands gave ready sympathy and support to theabolitionists in their mission. The abolition of slavery in the colonies hadbeen decreed by Parliament in 1833, but the old leaders in that reform had notlost their zeal for liberty. George Thompson, who with Clarkson and Wilberforcehad led the British abolitionists, invited Garrison over to help reorganize theanti-slavery sentiment of Great Britain against American slavery; and in August,1846, Garrison went to England, in that year evidently a paradise of reformers.During the week beginning May 17, 1846, Douglass addressed respectively theannual meeting of the British and Foreign Anti-slavery Society, a peaceconvention, a suffrage extension meeting, and a temperance convention, and spokealso at a reception where efforts were made to induce him to remain in England,and money subscribed to bring over his family. As will be seen hereafter, hechose the alternative of returning to the United States.On August 7, 1846, Douglass addressed the World's Temperance Convention, held atCovent Garden Theatre, London. There were many speakers, and the time allottedto each was brief; but Douglass never lost an opportunity to attack slavery, andhe did so on this occasion over the shoulder of temperance. He stated that hewas not a delegate to the convention, because those whom he might haverepresented were placed beyond the pale of American temperance societies eitherby slavery or by an inveterate prejudice against their color. He referred to themobbing of a procession of colored temperance societies in Philadelphia severalyears before, the burning of one of their churches, and the wrecking of theirbest temperance hall. These remarks brought out loud protests and calls fororder from the American delegates present, who manifested the usual Americansensitiveness to criticism, especially on the subject of slavery; but the housesustained Douglass, and demanded that he go on. Douglass was denounced for thisin a letter to the New York papers by Rev. Dr. Cox, one of the Americandelegates.Douglass's reply to this letter gave him the better of the controversy. Hesometimes expressed the belief, founded on long experience, that doctors ofdivinity were, as a rule, among the most ardent supporters of slavery. Dr. Cox,who seems at least to have met the description, was also a delegate to theEvangelical Alliance, which met in London, August 19, 1846, with a membership ofone thousand delegates from fifty different evangelical sects throughout theworld. The question was raised in the convention whether or not fellowshipshould be held with slaveholders. Dr. Cox and the other Americans held that itshould, and their views ultimately prevailed. Douglass made some tellingspeeches at Anti-slavery League meetings, in denunciation of the cowardice ofthe Alliance, and won a wide popularity.Douglass remained in England two years. Not only did this visit give him a greatopportunity to influence British public opinion against slavery, but thematerial benefits to himself were inestimable. He had left the United States aslave before the law, denied every civil right and every social privilege,literally a man without a country, and forced to cross the Atlantic among thecattle in the steerage of the steamboat. During his sojourn in Great Britain anEnglish lady, Mrs. Ellen Richardson, of Newcastle, had raised seven hundred andfifty dollars, which was paid over to Hugh Auld, of Maryland, to secureDouglass's legal manumission; and, not content with this generous work, the samelarge-hearted lady had raised by subscription about two thousand five hundreddollars, which Douglass carried back to the United States as a free gift, andused to start his newspaper. He had met in Europe, as he said in a farewellspeech, men quite as white as he had ever seen in the United States and of quiteas noble exterior, and had seen in their faces no scorn of his complexion. Hehad travelled over the four kingdoms, and had encountered no sign of disrespect.He had been lionized in London, had spoken every night of his last month there,and had declined as many more invitations. He had shaken hands with thevenerable Clarkson, and had breakfasted with the philosopher Combe, the authorof The Constitution of Man. He had won the friendship of John Bright, had brokenbread with Sir John Bowring, had been introduced to Lord Brougham, the brilliantleader of the Liberal party, and had listened to his wonderful eloquence. He hadmet Douglas Jerrold, the famous wit, and had been entertained by the poetWilliam Howitt, who made a farewell speech in his honor. Everywhere he haddenounced slavery, everywhere hospitable doors had opened wide to receive him,everywhere he had made friends for himself and his cause. A slave and an outcastat home, he had been made to feel himself a gentleman, had been the companion ofgreat men and good women. Urged to remain in this land of freedom, and offeredaid to establish himself in life there, his heart bled for his less fortunatebrethren in captivity; and, with the God-speed of his English friends ringing inhis ears, he went back to America,—to scorn, to obloquy, to ostracism, but afterall to the work to which he had been ordained, and which he was so wellqualified to perform."},{"pageContent":"VII.Douglass landed April 20, 1847. He returned to the United States with theintention of publishing the newspaper for which his English friends had sokindly furnished the means; but his plan meeting with opposition from hisabolitionist friends, who thought the platform offered him a better field forusefulness, he deferred the enterprise until near the end of the year. In themean time he plunged again into the thick of the anti-slavery agitation. We findhim lecturing in May in the Broadway Tabernacle, New York, and writing lettersto the anti-slavery papers. In June he was elected president of the New EnglandAnti-slavery Convention. In August and September he went on a lecturing tourwith Garrison and others through Pennsylvania and Ohio. On this tour the partyattended the commencement exercises of Oberlin College, famous for itsanti-slavery principles and practice, and spoke to immense meetings at variousplaces in Ohio and New York. Their cause was growing in popular favor; and, inplaces where formerly they had spoken out of doors because of the difficulty ofsecuring a place of meeting, they were now compelled to speak in the open air,because the churches and halls would not contain their audiences.On December 3, 1847, the first number of the North Star appeared. Douglass'sabolitionist friends had not yet become reconciled to this project, and hispersistence in it resulted in a temporary coldness between them. They verynaturally expected him to be guided by their advice. They had found him on thewharf at New Bedford, and given him his chance in life; and they may easily bepardoned for finding it presumptuous in him to disregard their advice and adopta new line of conduct without consulting them. Mr. Garrison wrote in a letter tohis wife from Cleveland, \"It will also greatly surprise our friends in Boston tohear that in regard to his prospect of establishing a paper here, to be calledthe North Star, he never opened his lips to me on the subject nor asked myadvice in any particular whatever.\" But Samuel May Jr., in a letter written toone of Douglass's English friends, in which he mentions this charge of Garrison,adds, \"It is only common justice to Frederick Douglass to inform you that thisis a mistake; that, on the contrary, he did speak to Mr. Garrison about it, justbefore he was taken ill at Cleveland.\" The probability is that Douglass had hismind made up, and did not seek advice, and that Mr. Garrison did not attach muchimportance to any casual remark Douglass may have made upon the subject. In afoot-note to the Life and Times of Garrison it is stated:—\"This enterprise was not regarded with favor by the leading abolitionists, whoknew only too well the precarious support which a fifth anti-slavery paper,edited by a colored man, must have, and who appreciated to the full Douglass'sunrivalled powers as a lecturer in the field … As anticipated, it nearly provedthe ruin of its projector; but by extraordinary exertions it was kept alive,not, however, on the platform of Garrisonian abolitionism. The necessary supportcould only be secured by a change of principles in accordance with Mr.Douglass's immediate (political abolition) environment.\"Douglass's own statement does not differ very widely from this, except that hedoes not admit the mercenary motive for his change of principles. It was indeference, however, to the feelings of his former associates that the North Starwas established at Rochester instead of in the East, where the field foranti-slavery papers was already fully occupied. In Rochester, then as now thecentre of a thrifty, liberal, and progressive population, Douglass gradually wonthe sympathy and support which such an enterprise demanded.The North Star, in size, typography, and interest, compared favorably with theother weeklies of the day, and lived for seventeen years. It had, however, its\"ups and downs.\" At one time the editor had mortgaged his house to pay therunning expenses; but friends came to his aid, his debts were paid, and thecirculation of the paper doubled. In My Bondage and My Freedom Douglass givesthe names of numerous persons who helped him in these earlier years of editorialeffort, among whom were a dozen of the most distinguished public men of his day.After the North Star had been in existence several years, its name was changedto Frederick Douglass's Paper, to give it a more distinctive designation, thenewspaper firmament already scintillating with many other \"Stars.\"In later years Douglass speaks of this newspaper enterprise as one of the wisestthings he ever undertook. To paraphrase Lord Bacon's famous maxim, much readingof life and of books had made him a full man, and much speaking had made him aready man. The attempt to put facts and arguments into literary form tended tomake him more logical in reasoning and more exact in statement. One of theeffects of Douglass's editorial responsibility and the influences brought tobear upon him by reason of it, was a change in his political views. Until hebegan the publication of the North Star and for several years thereafter, hewas, with the rest of the Garrisonians, a pronounced disunionist. He held to theGarrisonian doctrine that the pro-slavery Constitution of the United States wasa \"league with death and a covenant with hell,\" maintained that anti-slavery menshould not vote under it, and advocated the separation of the free States as theonly means of preventing the utter extinction of freedom by the ever-advancingencroachments of the slave power. In Rochester he found himself in the regionwhere the Liberty party, under the leadership of James G. Birney, Salmon P.Chase, Gerrit Smith, and others, had its largest support. The Liberty partymaintained that slavery could be fought best with political weapons, that by thepower of the ballot slavery could be confined strictly within its constitutionallimits and prevented from invading new territory, and that it could beextinguished by the respective States whenever the growth of public opiniondemanded it. One wing of the party took the more extreme ground that slavery wascontrary to the true intent and meaning of the Constitution, and demanded thatthe country should return to the principles of liberty upon which it wasfounded. Though the more radical abolitionists were for a time bitterly opposedto these views, yet the Liberty party was the natural outgrowth of the abolitionagitation. Garrison and Phillips and Douglass and the rest had planted, Birneyand Gerrit Smith and Chase and the rest watered, and the Union party, led by thegreat emancipator, garnered the grain after a bloody harvest.Several influences must have co-operated to modify Douglass's political views.The moral support and occasional financial aid given his paper by members of theLiberty party undoubtedly predisposed him favorably to their opinions. Hisretirement as agent of the Anti-slavery Society and the coolness resultingtherefrom had taken him out of the close personal contact with those ferventspirits who had led the van in the struggle for liberty. Their zeal had beenmore disinterested, perhaps, than Douglass's own; for, after all, they had nopersonal stake in the outcome, while to Douglass and his people the abolition ofslavery was a matter of life and death. Serene in the high altitude of theirconvictions, the Garrisonians would accept no halfway measures, would compromiseno principles, and, if their right arm offended them, would cut it off withsublime fortitude and cast it into the fire. They wanted a free country, wherethe fleeing victim of slavery could find a refuge. Douglass perceived theimmense advantage these swarming millions would gain through being free in theStates where they already were. He had always been minded to do the best thingpossible. When a slave, he had postponed his escape until it seemed entirelyfeasible. When denied cabin passage on steamboats, he had gone in the steerageor on deck. When he had been refused accommodation in a hotel, he had sought itunder any humble roof that offered. It would have been a fine thing in theabstract to refuse the half-loaf, but in that event we should have had noFrederick Douglass. It was this very vein of prudence, keeping always in viewthe object to be attained, and in a broad, non-Jesuitical sense subordinatingthe means to the end, that enabled Douglass to prolong his usefulness ageneration after the abolition of slavery. Douglass in his Life and Times stateshis own case as follows:\"After a time, a careful reconsideration of the subject convinced me that therewas no necessity for dissolving the union between the Northern and SouthernStates; that to seek this dissolution was no part of my duty as an abolitionist;that to abstain from voting was to refuse to exercise a legitimate and powerfulmeans for abolishing slavery; and that the Constitution of the United States notonly contained no guarantees in favor of slavery, but, on the contrary, was inits letter and spirit an anti-slavery instrument, demanding the abolition ofslavery as a condition of its own existence, as the supreme law of the land.\"This opinion was not exactly the opinion of the majority of the Liberty party,which did not question the constitutionality of slavery in the slave States.Neither was it the opinion of the Supreme Court, which in the Dred Scott caseheld that the Constitution guaranteed not only the right to hold slaves, but tohold them in free States. Nevertheless, entertaining the views he did, Douglasswas able to support the measures which sought to oppose slavery throughpolitical action. In August, 1848, while his Garrisonian views were as yetunchanged, he had been present as a spectator at the Free Soil Convention atBuffalo. In his Life and Times he says of this gathering: \"This BuffaloConvention of Free Soilers, however low their standard, did lay the foundationof a grand superstructure. It was a powerful link in the chain of events bywhich the slave system has been abolished, the slave emancipated, and thecountry saved from dismemberment.\" In 1851 Douglass announced that hissympathies were with the voting abolitionists, and thenceforth he supported byvoice and pen Hale, Fremont, and Lincoln, the successive candidates of the newparty.Douglass's political defection very much intensified the feeling against himamong his former coadjutors. The Garrisonians, with their usual plain speaking,did not hesitate to say what they thought of Douglass. Their three papers, theLiberator, the Standard, and the Freeman, assailed Douglass fiercely, andcharged him with treachery, inconsistency, ingratitude, and all the other crimesso easily imputed to one who changes his opinions. Garrison and Phillips andothers of his former associates denounced him as a deserter, and attributed hischange of heart to mercenary motives. Douglass seems to have borne himself withrare dignity and moderation in this trying period. He realized perfectly wellthat he was on the defensive, and that the burden devolved upon him to justifyhis change of front. This he seems to have attempted vigorously, but by argumentrather than invective. Even during the height of the indignation against himDouglass disclaimed any desire to antagonize his former associates. He simplyrealized that there was more than one way to fight slavery,—which knew a dozenways to maintain itself,—and had concluded to select the one that seemed mostpractical. He was quite willing that his former friends should go their own way.\"No personal assaults,\" he wrote to George Thompson, the English abolitionist,who wrote to him for an explanation of the charges made against him, \"shall everlead me to forget that some, who in America have often made me the subject ofpersonal abuse, are in their own way earnestly working for the abolition ofslavery.\"In later years, when political action had resulted in abolition, some of theseharsh judgments were modified, and Douglass and his earlier friends met in peaceand harmony. The debt he owed to William Lloyd Garrison he ever delighted toacknowledge. His speech on the death of Garrison breathes in every word the loveand honor in which he held him. In one of the last chapters of his Life andTimes he makes a sweeping acknowledgment of his obligations to the men and womenwho rendered his career possible.\"It was my good fortune,\" he writes, \"to get out of slavery at the right time,to be speedily brought in contact with that circle of highly cultivated men andwomen, banded together for the overthrow of slavery, of which William LloydGarrison was the acknowledged leader. To these friends, earnest, courageous,inflexible, ready to own me as a man and a brother, against all the scorn,contempt, and derision of a slavery-polluted atmosphere, I owe my success inlife.\"VIII.Events moved rapidly in the decade preceding the war. In 1850 the new FugitiveSlave Law brought discouragement to the hearts of the friends of liberty.Douglass's utterances during this period breathed the fiery indignation which hefelt when the slave-driver's whip was heard cracking over the free States, andall citizens were ordered to aid in the enforcement of this inhuman statute whencalled upon. This law really defeated its own purpose. There were thousands ofconservative Northern men, who, recognizing the constitutional guarantees ofslavery and the difficulty of abolishing it unless the South should take theinitiative, were content that it should be preserved intact so long as itremained a local institution. But when the attempt was made to make the Northwash the South's dirty linen, and transform every man in the Northern Statesinto a slave-catcher, it wrought a revulsion of feeling that aroused widespreadsympathy for the slave and strengthened the cause of freedom amazingly.Thousands of escaped slaves were living in Northern communities. Some of themhad acquired homes, had educated their children, and in some States had becomecitizens and voters. Already social pariahs, restricted generally to meniallabor, bearing the burdens of poverty and prejudice, they now had thrust beforethem the spectre of the kidnapper, the slave-catcher with his affidavit, and theUnited States [Supreme] Court, which was made by this law the subservient toolof tyranny. This law gave Douglass and the other abolitionists a new text. Itwas a set-back to their cause; but they were not entirely disheartened, for theysaw in it the desperate expedients by which it was sought to bolster up aninstitution already doomed by the advancing tide of civilization.The loss of slaves had become a serious drain upon the border States. The numberof refugees settled in the North was, of course, largely a matter of estimate.Runaway slaves were not apt to advertise their status, but rather to conceal it,so that most estimates were more likely to be under than over the truth. HenryWilson places the number in the free States at twenty thousand. There were inBoston in 1850, according to a public statement of Theodore Parker, from four tosix hundred; and in other New England towns, notably New Bedford, the number waslarge. Other estimates place the figures much higher. Mr. Siebert, in hisUnderground Railroad, after a careful calculation from the best obtainable data,puts the number of fugitives aided in Ohio alone at forty thousand in the thirtyyears preceding 1860, and in the same period nine thousand in the city ofPhiladelphia alone, which was one of the principal stations of the undergroundrailroad and the home of William Still, whose elaborate work on the UndergroundRailroad gives the details of many thrilling escapes.In the work of assisting runaway slaves Douglass found congenial employment. Itwas exciting and dangerous, but inspiring and soul-satisfying. He kept a room inhis house always ready for fugitives, having with him as many as eleven at atime. He would keep them over night, pay their fare on the train for Canada, andgive them half a dollar extra. And Canada, to her eternal honor be it said,received these assisted emigrants, with their fifty cents apiece, of alien race,debauched by slavery, gave them welcome and protection, refused to enter intodiplomatic relations for their rendition to bondage, and spoke well of them asmen and citizens when Henry Clay and the other slave [pro-slavery] leadersdenounced them as the most worthless of their class. The example of Canada maybe commended to those persons in the United States, of little faith, who,because in thirty years the emancipated race have not equalled the white man inachievement, are fearful lest nothing good can be expected of them.In the stirring years of the early fifties Douglass led a busy life. He had eachweek to fill the columns of his paper and raise the money to pay its expenses.Add to this his platform work and the underground railroad work, which consistednot only in personal aid to the fugitives, but in raising money to pay theirexpenses, and his time was very adequately employed. In every anti-slaverymeeting his face was welcome, and his position as a representative of his ownpeculiar people was daily strengthened.When Uncle Tom's Cabin, in 1852, set the world on fire over the wrongs of theslave,—or rather the wrongs of slavery, for that wonderful book did not portraythe negro as the only sufferer from this hoary iniquity,—Mrs. Stowe, in her newcapacity as a champion of liberty, conceived the plan of raising a fund for thebenefit of the colored race, and in 1853 invited Douglass to visit her atAndover, Massachusetts, where she consulted with him in reference to theestablishment of an industrial institute or trades school for colored youth,with a view to improving their condition in the free States. Douglass approvedheartily of this plan, and through his paper made himself its sponsor. When,later on, Mrs. Stowe abandoned the project, Douglass was made the subject ofsome criticism, though he was not at all to blame for Mrs. Stowes altered plans.In our own time the value of such institutions has been widely recognized, andthe success of those at Hampton and Tuskegee has stimulated anew the interest inindustrial education as one important factor in the elevation of the coloredrace.In the years from 1853 to 1860 the slave power, inspired with divine madness,rushed headlong toward its doom. The arbitrary enforcement of the Fugitive SlaveAct; the struggle between freedom and slavery in Kansas; the Dred Scottdecision, by which a learned and subtle judge, who had it within his power toenlarge the boundaries of human liberty and cover his own name with glory,deliberately and laboriously summarized and dignified with the sanction of acourt of last resort all the most odious prejudices that had restricted theopportunities of the colored people; the repeal of the Missouri Compromise; theJohn Brown raid; the [1855] assault on [Massachusetts antislavery U.S. Senator]Charles Sumner,—each of these incidents has been, in itself, the subject of morethan one volume. Of these events the Dred Scott decision was the mostdisheartening. Douglass was not proof against the universal gloom, and began tofeel that there was little hope of the peaceful solution of the question ofslavery. It was in one of his darker moments that old Sojourner Truth, whoseface appeared in so many anti-slavery gatherings, put her famous question, whichbreathed a sublime and childlike faith in God, even when his hand seemedheaviest on her people: \"Frederick,\" she asked, \"is God dead?\" The orator pausedimpressively, and then thundered in a voice that thrilled his audience withprophetic intimations, \"No, God is not dead; and therefore it is that slaverymust end in blood!\"During this period John Brown stamped his name indelibly upon American history.It was almost inevitable that a man of the views, activities, and prominence ofDouglass should become acquainted with John Brown. Their first meeting, however,was in 1847, more than ten years before the tragic episode at Harpers Ferry. Atthat time Brown was a merchant at Springfield, Massachusetts, whither Douglasswas invited to visit him. In his Life and Times he describes Brown as aprosperous merchant, who in his home lived with the utmost abstemiousness, inorder that he might save money for the great scheme he was already revolving.\"His wife believed in him, and his children observed him with reverence. Hisarguments seemed to convince all, his appeals touched all, and his willimpressed all. Certainly, I never felt myself in the presence of strongerreligious influence than while in this man's house.\" There in his own home,where Douglass stayed as his guest, Brown outlined a plan which in substantiallythe same form he held dear to his heart for a decade longer. This plan, brieflystated, was to establish camps at certain easily defended points in theAllegheny Mountains; to send emissaries down to the plantations in the lowlands,starting in Virginia, and draw off the slaves to these mountain fastnesses; tomaintain bands of them there, if possible, as a constant menace to slavery andan example of freedom; or, if that were impracticable, to lead them to Canadafrom time to time by the most available routes. Wild as this plan may seem inthe light of the desperate game subsequently played by slavery, it did not atthe time seem impracticable to such level-headed men as Theodore Parker andThomas Wentworth Higginson.Douglass's views were very much colored by his association with Brown; but, withhis usual prudence and foresight, he pointed out the difficulties of this plan.From the time of their first meeting the relations of the two men were friendlyand confidential. Captain Brown had his scheme ever in mind, and succeeded inconvincing Douglass and others that it would subserve a useful purpose,—that,even if it resulted in failure, it would stir the conscience of the nation to ajuster appreciation of the iniquity of slavery.The Kansas troubles, however, turned Brown's energies for a time into adifferent channel. After Kansas had been secured to freedom, he returned withrenewed ardor to his old project. He stayed for three weeks at Douglass's houseat Rochester, and while there carried on an extensive correspondence withsympathizers and supporters, and thoroughly demonstrated to all with whom heconversed that he was a man of one all-absorbing idea.In 1859, very shortly before the raid at Harpers Ferry, Douglass met Brown byappointment, in an abandoned stone quarry near Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. JohnBrown was already an outlaw, with a price upon his head; for a traitor hadbetrayed his plan the year before, and he had for this reason deferred itsexecution for a year. The meeting was surrounded by all the mystery andconducted with all the precautions befitting a meeting of conspirators. Brownhad changed the details of his former plan, and told Douglass of hisdetermination to take Harpers Ferry. Douglass opposed the measure vehemently,pointing out its certain and disastrous failure. Brown met each argument withanother, and was not to be swayed from his purpose. They spent more than a daytogether discussing the details of the movement. When the more practicalDouglass declined to take part in Brown's attempt, the old man threw his armsaround his swarthy friend, in a manner typical of his friendship for the darkrace, and said: \"Come with me, Douglass, I will defend you with my life. I wantyou for a special purpose. When I strike, the bees will begin to swarm, and Ishall want you to help hive them.\" But Douglass would not be persuaded. Hisabandonment of his old friend on the eve of a desperate enterprise wascriticised by some, who, as Douglass says, \"kept even farther from this braveand heroic man than I did.\" John Brown went forth to meet a felon's fate andwear a martyr's crown: Douglass lived to fight the battles of his race for yearsto come. There was room for both, and each played the part for which he was bestadapted. It would have strengthened the cause of liberty very little forDouglass to die with Brown.It is quite likely, however, that he narrowly escaped Brown's fate. When theraid at Harpers Ferry had roused the country, Douglass, with other leadingNorthern men, was indicted in Virginia for complicity in the affair. Brown'scorrespondence had fallen into the hands of the Virginia authorities, andcertain letters seemed to implicate Douglass. A trial in Virginia meant almostcertain death. Governor Wise, of Virginia, would have hung him with cheerfulalacrity, and publicly expressed his desire to do so. Douglass, with timelywarning that extradition papers had been issued for his arrest, escaped toCanada. He had previously planned a second visit to England, and the John Brownaffair had delayed his departure by some days. He sailed from Quebec, November12, 1859.After a most uncomfortable winter voyage of fourteen days Douglass found himselfagain in England, an object of marked interest and in very great demand as aspeaker. Six months he spent on the hospitable shores of Great Britain,lecturing on John Brown, on slavery and other subjects, and renewing thefriendships of former years. Being informed of the death of his youngestdaughter, he cut short his visit, which he had meant to extend to France, andreturned to the United States. So rapid had been the course of events since hisdeparture that the excitement over the John Brown raid had subsided. The firstLincoln campaign was in active progress; and the whole country quivered withvague anticipation of the impending crisis which was to end the conflict ofirreconcilable principles, and sweep slavery out of the path of civilization andprogress. Douglass plunged into the campaign with his accustomed zeal, and didwhat he could to promote the triumph of the Republican party. Lincoln waselected, and in a few short months the country found itself in the midst of war.God was not dead, and slavery was to end in blood.IX.Ever mindful of his people and seeking always to promote their welfare, Douglasswas one of those who urged, in all his addresses at this period, the abolitionof slavery and the arming of the negroes as the most effective means of crushingthe rebellion. In 1862 he delivered a series of lectures in New England underthe auspices of the recently formed Emancipation League, which contended forabolition as a military necessity.The first or conditional emancipation proclamation was issued in September,1862; and shortly afterward Douglass published a pamphlet for circulation inGreat Britain, entitled The Slave's Appeal to Great Britain, in which he urgedthe English people to refuse recognition of the independence of the ConfederateStates. He always endeavored in his public utterances to remove the doubts andfears of those who were tempted to leave the negroes in slavery because of thedifficulty of disposing of them after they became free. Douglass, with thesimple, direct, primitive sense of justice that had always marked his mind, tookthe only true ground for the solution of the race problems of that or any otherepoch,-that the situation should be met with equal and exact justice, and thathis people should be allowed to do as they pleased with themselves, \"subjectonly to the same great laws which apply to other men.\" He was a conspicuousfigure at the meeting in Tremont Temple, Boston, on January 1, 1863, when theEmancipation Proclamation, hourly expected by an anxious gathering, finallyflashed over the wires. Douglass was among the first to suggest the employmentof colored troops in the Union army. In spite of all assertions to the contrary,he foresaw in the war the end of slavery. He perceived that by the enlistment ofcolored men not only would the Northern arms be strengthened, but his peoplewould win an opportunity to exercise one of the highest rights of freemen, andby valor on the field of battle to remove some of the stigma that slavery hadplaced upon them. He strove through every channel at his command to impress hisviews upon the country; and his efforts helped to swell the current of opinionwhich found expression, after several intermediate steps, in the enlistment oftwo colored regiments by Governor Andrew, the famous war governor ofMassachusetts, a State foremost in all good works. When Mr. Lincoln had grantedpermission for the recruiting of these regiments, Douglass issued through hispaper a stirring appeal, which was copied in the principal journals of the UnionStates, exhorting his people to rally to this call, to seize this opportunity tostrike a blow at slavery and win the gratitude of the country and the blessingsof liberty for themselves and their posterity.Douglass exerted himself personally in procuring enlistments, his two sons [hisyoungest and his oldest], Charles and Lewis, being [among] the first in New Yorkto enlist; for the two Massachusetts regiments were recruited all over theNorth. Lewis H. Douglass, sergeant-major in the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, wasamong the foremost on the ramparts at Fort Wagner. Both these sons of Douglasssurvived the war, and are now well known and respected citizens of Washington,D.C. The Fifty-fourth Massachusetts, under the gallant but ill-fated ColonelShaw, won undying glory in the conflict; and the heroic deeds of the officersand men of this regiment are fittingly commemorated in the noble monument by St.Gaudens, recently erected on Boston Common, to stand as an inspiration offreedom and patriotism for the future and as testimony that a race which forgenerations had been deprived of arms and liberty could worthily bear the oneand defend the other.Douglass was instrumental in persuading the government to put colored soldierson an equal footing with white soldiers, both as to pay and protection. In thecourse of these efforts he was invited to visit President Lincoln. He describesthis memorable interview in detail in his Life and Times. The President welcomedhim with outstretched hands, put him at once at his ease, and listened patientlyand attentively to all that he had to say. Douglass maintained that coloredsoldiers should receive the same pay as white soldiers, should be protected andexchanged as prisoners, and should be rewarded, by promotion, for deeds ofvalor. The President suggested some of the difficulties to be overcome; but bothhe and Secretary of War Stanton, whom Douglass also visited, assured him that inthe end his race should be justly treated. Stanton, before the close of theinterview with him, promised Douglass a commission as assistant adjutant toGeneral Lorenzo Thomas, then recruiting colored troops in the MississippiValley. But Stanton evidently changed his mind, since the commission, somewhatto Douglass's chagrin, never came to hand.When McClellan had been relieved by Grant, and the new leader of the Unionforces was fighting the stubbornly contested campaign of the Wilderness,President Lincoln again sent for Douglass, to confer with him with reference tobringing slaves in the rebel States within the Union lines, so that in the eventof premature peace as many slaves as possible might be free. Douglass undertook,at the President's suggestion, to organize a band of colored scouts to go amongthe negroes and induce them to enter the Union lines. The plan was never carriedout, owing to the rapid success of the Union arms; but the interview greatlyimpressed Douglass with the sincerity of the President's conviction againstslavery and his desire to see the war result in its overthrow. What the coloredrace may have owed to the services, in such a quarter, of such an advocate asDouglass, brave, eloquent, high-principled, and an example to Lincoln of whatthe enslaved race was capable of, can only be imagined. That Lincoln was deeplyimpressed by these interviews is a matter of history.Douglass supported vigorously the nomination of Lincoln for a second term, andwas present at his [March 4] inauguration. And a few days later, while theinspired words of the inaugural address, long bracketed with the noblest ofhuman utterances, were still ringing in his ears, he spoke at the meeting heldin Rochester to mourn the death of the martyred President, and made one of hismost eloquent and moving addresses. It was a time that wrung men's hearts, andnone more than the strong-hearted man's whose race had found its liberty throughhim who lay dead at Washington, slain by the hand of an assassin whom slaveryhad spawned.X.With the fall of slavery and the emancipation of the colored race the heroicepoch of Douglass's career may be said to have closed. The text upon which he solong had preached had been expunged from the national bible; and he had been aone-text preacher, a one-theme orator. He felt the natural reaction which comeswith relief from high mental or physical tension, and wondered, somewhat sadly,what he should do with himself, and how he should earn a living. The sameconsiderations, in varying measure, applied to others of the anti-slaveryreformers. Some, unable to escape the reforming habit, turned their attention todifferent social evils, real or imaginary. Others, sufficiently supplied withthis worlds goods for their moderate wants, withdrew from public life. Douglasswas thinking of buying a farm and retiring to rural solitudes, when a new careeropened up for him in the lyceum lecture field. The North was favorably disposedtoward colored men. They had acquitted themselves well during the war, and hadshown becoming gratitude to their deliverers. The once despised abolitionistswere now popular heroes. Douglass's checkered past seemed all the more romanticin the light of the brighter present, like a novel with a pleasant ending; andthose who had hung thrillingly upon his words when he denounced slavery nowlistened with interest to what he had to say upon other topics. He spokesometimes on Woman Suffrage, of which he was always a consistent advocate. Hismost popular lecture was one on \"Self-made Men.\" Another on \"Ethnology,\" inwhich he sought a scientific basis for his claim for the negro's equality withthe white man, was not so popular—with white people. The wave of enthusiasmwhich had swept the enfranchised slaves into what seemed at that time the safeharbor of constitutional right was not, after all, based on abstract doctrinesof equality of intellect, but on an inspiring sense of justice (long dormantunder the influence of slavery, but thoroughly awakened under the moral stressof the war), which conceded to every man the right of a voice in his owngovernment and the right to an equal opportunity in life to develop such powersas he possessed, however great or small these might be.But Douglass's work in direct behalf of his race was not yet entirely done. Infact, he realized very distinctly the vast amount of work that would benecessary to lift his people up to the level of their enlarged opportunities;and, as may be gathered from some of his published utterances, he foresaw thatthe process would be a long one, and that their friends might weary sometimes ofwaiting, and that there would be reactions toward slavery which would robemancipation of much of its value. It was the very imminence of such backwardsteps, in the shape of various restrictive and oppressive laws promptly enactedby the old slave States under President Johnson's administration, that ledDouglass to urge the enfranchisement of the freedmen. He maintained that in afree country there could be no safe or logical middle ground between the statusof freeman and that of serf. There has been much criticism because the negro, itis said, acquired the ballot prematurely. There seemed imperative reasons,besides that of political expediency, for putting the ballot in his hands.Recent events have demonstrated that this necessity is as great now as then. Theassumption that negroes—under which generalization are included all men ofcolor, regardless of that sympathy to which kinship at least should entitle manyof them—are unfit to have a voice in government is met by the words of Lincoln,which have all the weight of a political axiom: \"No man can be safely trusted togovern other men without their consent.\" The contention that a class whoconstitute half the population of a State shall be entirely unrepresented in itscouncils, because, forsooth, their will there expressed may affect thegovernment of another class of the same general population, is as repugnant tojustice and human rights as was the institution of slavery itself. Such acondition of affairs has not the melodramatic and soul-stirring incidents ofchattel slavery, but its effects can be as far-reaching and as debasing. Therehas been some manifestation of its possible consequences in the recent outbreaksof lynching and other race oppression in the South. The practicaldisfranchisement of the colored people in several States, and the apparentacquiescence by the Supreme Court in the attempted annulment, by restrictive andoppressive laws, of the war amendments to the Constitution, have brought aforetaste of what might be expected should the spirit of the Dred Scott decisionbecome again the paramount law of the land.On February 7, 1866, Douglass acted as chief spokesman of a committee of leadingcolored men of the country, who called upon President Johnson to urge theimportance of enfranchisement. Mr. Johnson, true to his Southern instincts, wascoldly hostile to the proposition, recounted all the arguments against it, andrefused the committee an opportunity to reply. The matter was not left with Mr.Johnson, however; and the committee turned its attention to the leadingRepublican statesmen, in whom they found more impressionable material. Under theleadership of Senators Sumner, Wilson, Wade, and others, the matter was fullyargued in Congress, the Democratic party being in opposition, as always innational politics, to any measure enlarging the rights or liberties of thecolored race.In September, 1866, Douglass was elected a delegate from Rochester to theNational Loyalists' Convention at Philadelphia, called to consider the momentousquestions of government growing out of the war. While he had often attendedanti-slavery conventions as the representative of a small class ofabolitionists, his election to represent a large city in a national conventionwas so novel a departure from established usage as to provoke surprise andcomment all over the country. On the way to Philadelphia he was waited upon by acommittee of other delegates, who came to his seat on the train and urged uponhim the impropriety of his taking a seat as a delegate. Douglass listenedpatiently, but declined to be moved by their arguments. He replied that he hadbeen duly elected a delegate from Rochester, and he would represent that city inthe convention. A procession of the members and friends of the convention was totake place on its opening day. Douglass was solemnly warned that, if he walkedin the procession, he would probably be mobbed. But he had been mobbed before,more than once, and had lived through it; and he promptly presented himself atthe place of assembly. His reception by his fellow-delegates was not cordial,and he seemed condemned to march alone in the procession, when Theodore Tilton,at that time editor of the Independent, paired off with him, and marched by hisside through the streets of the Quaker City. The result was gratifying alike toDouglass and the friends of liberty and progress. He was cheeredenthusiastically all along the line of march, and became as popular in theconvention as he had hitherto been neglected.A romantic incident of this march was a pleasant meeting, on the street, with adaughter of Mrs. Lucretia Auld, the mistress who had treated him kindly duringhis childhood on the Lloyd plantation. The Aulds had always taken an interest inDouglass's career,—he had, indeed, given the family a wide though not altogetherenviable reputation in his books and lectures,—and this good lady had followedthe procession for miles, that she might have the opportunity to speak to hergrandfather's former slave and see him walk in the procession.In the convention \"the ever-ready and imperial Douglass,\" as Colonel Higginsondescribes him, spoke in behalf of his race. The convention, however, dividedupon the question of negro suffrage, and adjourned without decisive action. Butunder President Grant's administration the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, andby the solemn sanction of the Constitution the ballot was conferred upon theblack men upon the same terms as those upon which it was enjoyed by the whites.XI.It is perhaps fitting, before we take leave of Douglass, to give some estimateof the remarkable oratory which gave him his hold upon the past generation. For,while his labors as editor and in other directions were of great value to thecause of freedom, it is upon his genius as an orator that his fame mustultimately rest.While Douglass's color put him in a class by himself among great orators, andalthough his slave past threw around him an element of romance that added charmto his eloquence, these were mere incidental elements of distinction. The Northwas full of fugitive slaves, and more than one had passionately proclaimed hiswrongs. There were several colored orators who stood high in the councils of theabolitionists and did good service for the cause of humanity.Douglass possessed, in large measure, the physical equipment most impressive inan orator. He was a man of magnificent figure, tall, strong, his head crownedwith a mass of hair which made a striking element of his appearance. He haddeep-set and flashing eyes, a firm, well-moulded chin, a countenance somewhatsevere in repose, but capable of a wide range of expression. His voice was richand melodious, and of great carrying power. One writer, who knew him in theearly days of his connection with the abolitionists, says of him, in Johnson'sSketches of Lynn:\"He was not then the polished orator he has since become, but even at that earlydate he gave promise of the grand part he was to play in the conflict which wasto end in the destruction of the system that had so long cursed his race…. Hewas more than six feet in height; and his majestic form, as he rose to speak,straight as an arrow, muscular yet lithe and graceful, his flashing eye, andmore than all his voice, that rivalled Webster's in its richness and in thedepth and sonorousness of its cadences, made up such an ideal of an orator asthe listeners never forgot. And they never forgot his burning words, his pathos,nor the rich play of his humor.\"The poet William Howitt said of him on his departure from England in 1847, \"Hehas appeared in this country before the most accomplished audiences, who weresurprised, not only at his talent, but at his extraordinary information.\"In Ireland he was introduced as \"the black O'Connell,\"—a high compliment; forO'Connell was at that time the idol of the Irish people. In Scotland they calledhim the \"black Douglass [Douglas],\" after his prototype in The Lady of the Lake,because of his fìre and vigor. In Rochester he was called the \"swarthy Ajax,\"from his indignant denunciation and defiance of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850,which came like a flash of lightning to blast the hopes of the anti-slaverypeople.Douglass possessed in unusual degree the faculty of swaying his audience,sometimes against their maturer judgment. There is something in the argumentfrom first principles which, if presented with force and eloquence, never failsto appeal to those who are not blinded by self-interest or deep-seatedprejudice. Douglass's argument was that of the Declaration ofIndependence,—\"that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by theirCreator with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, andthe pursuit of happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments areinstituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of thegoverned.\" The writer may be pardoned for this quotation; for there are timeswhen we seem to forget that now and here, no less than in ancient Rome, \"eternalvigilance is the price of liberty.\" Douglass brushed aside all sophistries aboutConstitutional guarantees, and vested rights, and inferior races, and, havingpostulated the right of men to be free, maintained that negroes were men, andoffered himself as a proof of his assertion,—an argument that few had thetemerity to deny. If it were answered that he was only half a negro, he wouldreply that slavery made no such distinction, and as a still more irrefutableargument would point to his friend, Samuel R. Ward, who often accompanied him onthe platform,—an eloquent and effective orator, of whom Wendell Phillips saidthat \"he was so black that, if he would shut his eyes, one could not see him.\"It was difficult for an auditor to avoid assent to such arguments, presentedwith all the force and fire of genius, relieved by a ready wit, a contagioushumor, and a tear-compelling power rarely excelled.\"As a speaker,\" says one of his contemporaries, \"he has few equals. It is notdeclamation, but oratory, power of description. He watches the tide ofdiscussion, and dashes into it at once with all the tact of the forum or thebar. He has art, argument, sarcasm, pathos,—all that first-rate men show intheir master efforts.\"His readiness was admirably illustrated in the running debate with CaptainRynders, a ward politician and gambler of New York, who led a gang of roughswith the intention of breaking up the meeting of the American Anti-slaverySociety in New York City, May 7, 1850. The newspapers had announced the proposedmeeting in language calculated to excite riot. Rynders packed the meeting withrowdies, and himself occupied a seat on the platform. Some remark by Mr.Garrison, the first speaker, provoked a demonstration of hostility. When thiswas finally quelled by a promise to permit one of the Rynders party to reply,Mr. Garrison finished his speech. He was followed by a prosy individual, whobranded the negro as brother to the monkey. Douglass, perceiving that thespeaker was wearying even his own friends, intervened at an opportune moment,captured the audience by a timely display of wit, and then improved the occasionby a long and effective speech. When Douglass offered himself as a refutation ofthe last speaker's argument, Rynders replied that Douglass was half white.Douglass thereupon greeted Rynders as his half-brother, and made this expressionthe catchword of his speech. When Rynders interrupted from time to time, he wassilenced with a laugh. He appears to have been a somewhat philosophic scoundrel,with an appreciation of humor that permitted the meeting to proceed to anorderly close. Douglass's speech was the feature of the evening. \"That giftedman,\" said Garrison, in whose Life and Times a graphic description of thisfamous meeting is given, \"effectually put to shame his assailants by his wit andeloquence.\"A speech delivered by Douglass at Concord, New Hampshire, is thus described byanother writer: \"He gradually let out the outraged humanity that was laboring inhim, in indignant and terrible speech…. There was great oratory in his speech,but more of dignity and earnestness than what we call eloquence. He was aninsurgent slave, taking hold on the rights of speech, and charging on histyrants the bondage of his race.\"In Holland's biography of Douglass extracts are given from letters ofdistinguished contemporaries who knew the orator. Colonel T.W. Higginson writesthus: \"I have hardly heard his equal, in grasp upon an audience, in dramaticpresentation, in striking at the pith of an ethical question, and in single[signal] illustrations and examples.\" Another writes, in reference to theimpromptu speech delivered at the meeting at Rochester on the death of Lincoln:\"I have heard Webster and Clay in their best moments, Channing and Beecher intheir highest inspirations. I never heard truer eloquence. I never sawprofounder impression.\"The published speeches of Douglass, of which examples may be found scatteredthroughout his various autobiographies, reveal something of the powers thuscharacterized, though, like other printed speeches, they lose by being put intype. But one can easily imagine their effect upon a sympathetic or receptiveaudience, when delivered with flashing eye and deep-toned resonant voice by aman whose complexion and past history gave him the highest right to describe anddenounce the iniquities of slavery and contend for the rights of a race. Inlater years, when brighter days had dawned for his people, and age had dimmedthe recollection of his sufferings and tempered his animosities, he became morecharitable to his old enemies; but in the vigor of his manhood, with the memoryof his wrongs and those of his race fresh upon him, he possessed thatindispensable quality of the true reformer: he went straight to the root of theevil, and made no admissions and no compromises. Slavery for him was conceivedin greed, born in sin, cradled in shame, and worthy of utter and relentlesscondemnation. He had the quality of directness and simplicity. When Collinswould have turned the abolition influence to the support of a communisticscheme, Douglass opposed it vehemently. Slavery was the evil they were fighting,and their cause would be rendered still more unpopular if they ran after strangegods.When Garrison pleaded for the rights of man, when Phillips with golden eloquencepreached the doctrine of humanity and progress, men approved and applauded. WhenParker painted the moral baseness of the times, men acquiesced shamefacedly.When Channing preached the gospel of love, they wished the dream might become areality. But, when Douglass told the story of his wrongs and those of hisbrethren in bondage, they felt that here indeed was slavery embodied, here wasan argument for freedom that could not be gainsaid, that the race that couldproduce in slavery such a man as Frederick Douglass must surely be worthy offreedom.What Douglass's platform utterances in later years lacked of the vehemence andfire of his earlier speeches, they made up in wisdom and mature judgment. Thereis a note of exultation in his speeches just after the war. Jehovah hadtriumphed, his people were free. He had seen the Red Sea of blood open and letthem pass, and engulf the enemy who pursued them.Among the most noteworthy of Douglass's later addresses were the oration at theunveiling of the Freedmen's Monument to Abraham Lincoln in Washington in 1876,which may be found in his Life and Times; the address on Decoration Day, NewYork, 1878; his eulogy on Wendell Phillips, printed in Austin's Life and Timesof Wendell Phillips; and the speech on the death of Garrison, June, 1879. Helectured in the Parker Fraternity Course in Boston, delivered numerous addressesto gatherings of colored men, spoke at public dinners and woman suffragemeetings, and retained his hold upon the interest of the public down to the veryday of his death.XII.With the full enfranchisement of his people, Douglass entered upon what may becalled the third epoch of his career, that of fruition. Not every worthy lifereceives its reward in this world; but Douglass, having fought the good fight,was now singled out, by virtue of his prominence, for various honors andemoluments at the hands of the public. He was urged by many friends to take uphis residence in some Southern district and run for Congress; but from modestyor some doubt of his fitness—which one would think he need not have felt—and theconsideration that his people needed an advocate at the North to keep alivethere the friendship and zeal for liberty that had accomplished so much for hisrace, he did not adopt the suggestion.In 1860 [1870] Douglass moved to Washington, and began [took over] thepublication of the New National Era, a weekly paper devoted to the interests ofthe colored race. The venture did not receive the support hoped for; and thepaper was turned over to Douglass's two [oldest] sons, Lewis and Frederick, andwas finally abandoned [in 1874], Douglass having sunk about ten thousand dollarsin the enterprise. Later newspapers for circulation among the colored peoplehave proved more successful; and it ought to be a matter of interest that therace which thirty years ago could not support one publication, edited by itsmost prominent man, now maintains several hundred newspapers which make theirappearance regularly.In 1871 Douglass was elected president of the Freedmans Bank. This ill-starredventure was then apparently in the full tide of prosperity, and promised to be agreat lever in the uplifting of the submerged race. Douglass, soon after hiselection as president, discovered the insolvency of the institution, andinsisted that it be closed up. The negro was in the hands of his friends, andwas destined to suffer for their mistakes as well as his own.Other honors that fell to Douglass were less empty than the presidency of abankrupt bank. In 1870 he was appointed by President Grant a member of the SantoDomingo Commission, the object of which was to arrange terms for the annexationof the mulatto republic to the Union. Some of the best friends of the coloredrace, among them Senator Sumner, opposed this step; but Douglass maintained thatto receive Santo Domingo as a State would add to its strength and importance.The scheme ultimately fell through, whether for the good or ill of Santo Domingocan best be judged when the results of more recent annexation schemes [1898:Puerto Rico, Guam, the Philippines, Hawaii, and de facto Cuba] become apparent.Douglass went to Santo Domingo on an American man-of-war, in the company ofthree other commissioners. In his Life and Times he draws a pleasing contrastbetween some of his earlier experiences in travelling, and the terms of cordialintimacy upon which, as the representative of a nation which a few years beforehad denied him a passport, he was now received in the company of able anddistinguished gentlemen.On his return to the United States Douglass received from President Grant anappointment as member of the legislative council, or upper house of thelegislature, of the District of Columbia, where he served for a short time,until other engagements demanded his resignation, [one of] his son[s] beingappointed to fill out his term. To this appointment Douglass owed the title of\"Honorable,\" subsequently applied to him.In 1872 Douglass presided over and addressed a convention of colored men at NewOrleans, and urged them to support President Grant for renomination. He waselected a presidential elector for New York, and on the meeting of the electoralcollege in Albany, after Grant's triumphant re-election, received a further markof confidence and esteem in the appointment at the hands of his fellow-electorsto carry the sealed vote to Washington. Douglass sought no personal reward forhis services in this campaign, but to his influence was due the appointment ofseveral of his friends to higher positions than had ever theretofore been heldin this country by colored men.When R. B. Hayes was nominated for President, Douglass again took the stump, andreceived as a reward the honorable and lucrative office of Marshal of the UnitedStates for the District of Columbia. This appointment was not agreeable to thewhite people of the District, whose sympathies were largely pro-slavery; and aneffort was made to have its confirmation defeated in the Senate. The appointmentwas confirmed, however; and Douglass served his term of four years, in spite ofnumerous efforts to bring about his removal.In 1879 the hard conditions under which the negroes in the South were compelledto live led to a movement to promote an exodus of the colored people to theNorth and West, in the search for better opportunities. The white people of theSouth, alarmed at the prospect of losing their labor, were glad to welcomeDouglass when he went among them to oppose this movement, which he at that timeconsidered detrimental to the true interests of the colored population.Under the Garfield administration Douglass was appointed in May, 1881, recorderof deeds for the District of Columbia. He held this very lucrative officethrough the terms of Presidents Garfìeld and Arthur and until removed byPresident Cleveland in 1886, having served nearly a year after Cleveland'sinauguration. In 1889 he was appointed by President Harrison as ministerresident and consul-general to the Republic of Hayti, in which capacity he acteduntil 1891, when he resigned and returned permanently to Washington. The writerhas heard him speak with enthusiasm of the substantial progress made by theHaytians in the arts of government and civilization, and with indignation ofwhat he considered slanders against the island, due to ignorance or prejudice.When it was suggested to Douglass that the Haytians were given to revolution asa mode of expressing disapproval of their rulers, he replied that a four years'rebellion had been fought and two Presidents assassinated in the United Statesduring a comparatively peaceful political period in Hayti. His last officialconnection with the Black Republic was at the World's Columbian Exposition atChicago in 1893, where he acted as agent in charge of the Haytian Building andthe very creditable exhibit therein contained. His stately figure, which age hadnot bowed, his strong dark face, and his head of thick white hair made him oneof the conspicuous features of the Exposition; and many a visitor took advantageof the occasion to recall old acquaintance made in the stirring anti-slaverydays.In 1878 he revisited the Lloyd plantation in Maryland, where he had spent partof his youth, and an affecting meeting took place between him and Thomas Auld,whom he had once called master. Once in former years he had been sought out bythe good lady who in his childhood had taught him to read. Nowhere more than inhis own accounts of these meetings does the essentially affectionate andforgiving character of Douglass and his race become apparent, and one cannotrefrain from thinking that a different state of affairs might prevail in theSouthern States if other methods than those at present in vogue were used toregulate the relations between the two races and their various admixtures thatmake up the Southern population.In June, 1879, a bronze bust of Douglass was erected in Sibley Hall of RochesterUniversity as a tribute to one who had shed lustre on the city. In 1882 occurredthe death of Douglass's first wife, whom he had married in New York immediatelyafter his escape from slavery, and who had been his faithful companion throughso many years of stress and struggle. In the same year his Life and Times waspublished. In 1884 he married Miss Helen Pitts, a white woman of culture andrefinement. There was some criticism of this step by white people who did notapprove of the admixture of the races, and by colored persons who thought theirleader had slighted his own people when he overlooked the many worthy andaccomplished women among them. But Douglass, to the extent that he noticed thesestrictures at all, declared that he had devoted his life to breaking down thecolor line, and that he did not know any more effectual way to accomplish it;that he was white by half his blood, and, as he had given most of his life tohis mothers race, he claimed the right to dispose of the remnant as he saw fit.The latter years of his life were spent at his beautiful home known asCedar Hill, on Anacostia Heights, near Washington, amid all \"that which should accompany old age, As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends.\"He possessed strong and attractive social qualities, and his home formed a Meccafor the advanced and aspiring of his race. He was a skilful violinist, andderived great pleasure from the valuable instrument he possessed. A wholesomeatmosphere always surrounded him. He had never used tobacco or strong liquors,and was clean of speech and pure in life.He died at his home in Washington, February 20, 1895. He had been perfectly wellduring the day, and was supposed to be in excellent health. He had attended boththe forenoon and afternoon sessions of the Women's National Council, then insession at Washington, and had been a conspicuous figure in the audience. On hisreturn home, while speaking to his wife in the hallway of his house, he suddenlyfell, and before assistance could be given he had passed away.His death brought forth many expressions from the press of the land, reflectingthe high esteem in which he had been held by the public for a generation. Invarious cities meetings were held, at which resolutions of sorrow andappreciation were passed, and delegations appointed to attend his funeral. Inthe United States Senate a resolution was offered reciting that in the person ofthe late Frederick Douglass death had borne away a most illustrious citizen, andpermitting the body to lie in state in the rotunda of the Capitol on Sunday. Theimmediate consideration of the resolution was asked for. Mr. Gorman, ofMaryland, the State which Douglass honored by his birth, objected; and theresolution went over.Douglass's funeral took place on February 25, 1895, at the Metropolitan AfricanMethodist Episcopal Church in Washington, and was the occasion of a greateroutpouring of colored people than had taken place in Washington since theunveiling of the Lincoln emancipation statue in 1878. The body was taken fromCedar Hill to the church at half-past nine in the morning; and from that houruntil noon thousands of persons, including many white people, passed in doublefile through the building and viewed the body, which was in charge of a guard ofhonor composed of members of a colored camp of the Sons of Veterans. The churchwas crowded when the services began, and several thousands could not obtainadmittance. Delegations, one of them a hundred strong, were present from a dozencities. Among the numerous floral tributes was a magnificent shield of roses,orchids, and palms, sent by the Haytian government through its minister. Anothertribute was from the son of his old master. Among the friends of the deceasedpresent were Senators Sherman and Hoar, Justice Harlan of the Supreme Court,Miss Susan B. Anthony, and Miss May Wright Sewall, president of the Women'sNational Council. The temporary pall-bearers were ex-Senator B. K. Bruce andother prominent colored men of Washington. The sermon was preached by Rev. J. G.Jenifer. John E. Hutchinson, the last of the famous Hutchinson family ofabolition singers, who with his sister accompanied Douglass on his first voyageto England, sang two requiem solos, and told some touching stories of theirold-time friendship. The remains were removed to Douglass's former home inRochester, where he was buried with unusual public honors.In November, 1894, a movement was begun in Rochester, under the leadership of J.W. Thompson, with a view to erect a monument in memory of the colored soldiersand sailors who had fallen during the Civil War. This project had the heartysupport and assistance of Douglass; and upon his death the plan was changed, anda monument to Douglass himself decided upon. A contribution of one thousanddollars from the Haytian government and an appropriation of three thousanddollars from the State of New York assured the success of the plan. September15, 1898, was the date set for the unveiling of the monument; but, owing todelay in the delivery of the statue, only a part of the contemplated exercisestook place. The monument, complete with the exception of the statue which was tosurmount it, was formally turned over to the city, the presentation speech beingmade by Charles P. Lee of Rochester. A solo and chorus composed for the occasionwere sung, an original poem read by T. Thomas Fortune, and addresses deliveredby John C. Dancy and John H. Smyth. Joseph H. Douglass, a talented grandson ofthe orator, played a violin solo, and Miss Susan B. Anthony recalled somereminiscences of Douglass in the early anti-slavery days.In June, 1899, the bronze statue of Douglass, by Sidney W. Edwards, wasinstalled with impressive ceremonies. The movement thus to perpetuate the memoryof Douglass had taken rise among a little band of men of his own race, but thewhole people of Rochester claimed the right to participate in doing honor totheir distinguished fellow-citizen. The city assumed a holiday aspect. A paradeof military and civic societies was held, and an appropriate programme renderedat the unveiling of the monument. Governor Roosevelt of New York delivered anaddress; and the occasion took a memorable place in the annals of Rochester, ofwhich city Douglass had said, \"I shall always feel more at home there thananywhere else in this country.\"In March, 1895, a few weeks after the death of Douglass, Theodore Tilton, hispersonal friend for many years, published in Paris, of which city he was then aresident, a volume of Sonnets to the Memory of Frederick Douglass, from whichthe following lines are quoted as the estimate of a contemporary and a fittingepilogue to this brief sketch of so long and full a life: \"I knew the noblest giants of my day, And he was of them—strong amid the strong: But gentle too: for though he suffered wrong, Yet the wrong-doer never heard him say, 'Thee also do I hate.' … A lover's lay— No dirge—no doleful requiem song— Is what I owe him; for I loved him long; As dearly as a younger brother may. Proud is the happy grief with which I sing; For, O my Country! in the paths of men There never walked a grander man than he! He was a peer of princes—yea, a king! Crowned in the shambles and the prison-pen! The noblest Slave that ever God set free!\"BibliographyThe only original sources of information concerning the early life of FrederickDouglass are the three autobiographies published by him at various times; andthe present writer, like all others who have written of Mr. Douglass, has had todepend upon this personal record for the incidents of Mr. Douglass's life inslavery. As to the second period of his life, his public career as anti-slaveryorator and agitator, the sources of information are more numerous and varied.The biographies of noted abolitionists whose lives ran from time to time inparallel lines with his make very full reference to Douglass's services in theircommon cause, the one giving the greatest detail being the very complete andadmirable Life and Times of William Lloyd Garrison, by his sons, which is ineffect an exhaustive history of the Garrisonian movement for abolition.The files of the Liberator, Mr. Garrison's paper, which can be found in a numberof the principal public libraries of the country, constitute a vast storehouseof information concerning the labors of the American Anti-slavery Society, withwhich Douglass was identified from 1843 to 1847, the latter being the year inwhich he gave up his employment as agent of the society and established hispaper at Rochester. Many letters from Mr. Douglass's pen appeared in theLiberator during this period.Mr. Douglass's own memories are embraced in three separate volumes, published atwide intervals, each succeeding volume being a revision of the preceding work,with various additions and omissions.I.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ELECTRONIC WORKS.Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm conceptof a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. Forthirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with onlya loose network of volunteer support.Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions, allof which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice isincluded. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with anyparticular paper edition.Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number,often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped),HTML and others.Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the oldfilename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed. VERSIONS based onseparate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etextnumbers.Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: http://www.gutenberg.netThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, including how tomake donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to helpproduce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hearabout new eBooks.EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filedin directories based on their release date. If you want to download any of theseeBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize thefollowing addresses and just download by the etext year. http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06 (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are filed ina different way. The year of a release date is no longer part of the directorypath. The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to thefilename). The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to allbut the last digit in the filename. For example an eBook of filename 10234 wouldbe found at: http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234or filename 24689 would be found at: http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689An alternative method of locating eBooks: http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL"}]
