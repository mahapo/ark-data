The natureand character of slavery have been subjects of an almost endless variety ofartistic representation; and after the brilliant achievements in that field, andwhile those achievements are yet fresh in the memory of the million, he whowould add another to the legion, must possess the charm of transcendentexcellence, or apologize for something worse than rashness. The reader is,therefore, assured, with all due promptitude, that his attention is not invitedto a work of ART, but to a work of FACTS—Facts, terrible and almost incredible,it may be yet FACTS, nevertheless.I am authorized to say that there is not a fictitious name nor place in thewhole volume; but that names and places are literally given, and that everytransaction therein described actually transpired.Perhaps the best Preface to this volume is furnished in the following letter ofMr. Douglass, written in answer to my urgent solicitation for such a work:  ROCHESTER, N. Y. July 2, 1855.DEAR FRIEND: I have long entertained, as you very well know, a somewhat positiverepugnance to writing or speaking anything for the public, which could, with anydegree of plausibilty, make me liable to the imputation of seeking personalnotoriety, for its own sake. Entertaining that feeling very sincerely, andpermitting its control, perhaps, quite unreasonably, I have often refused tonarrate my personal experience in public anti-slavery meetings, and insympathizing circles, when urged to do so by friends, with whose views andwishes, ordinarily, it were a pleasure to comply. In my letters and speeches, Ihave generally aimed to discuss the question of Slavery in the light offundamental principles, and upon facts, notorious and open to all; making, Itrust, no more of the fact of my own former enslavement, than circumstancesseemed absolutely to require. I have never placed my opposition to slavery on abasis so narrow as my own enslavement, but rather upon the indestructible andunchangeable laws of human nature, every one of which is perpetually andflagrantly violated by the slave system. I have also felt that it was best forthose having histories worth the writing—or supposed to be so—to commit suchwork to hands other than their own. To write of one’s self, in such a manner asnot to incur the imputation of weakness, vanity, and egotism, is a work withinthe ability of but few; and I have little reason to believe that I belong tothat fortunate few.These considerations caused me to hesitate, when first you kindly urged me toprepare for publication a full account of my life as a slave, and my life as afreeman.Nevertheless, I see, with you, many reasons for regarding my autobiography asexceptional in its character, and as being, in some sense, naturally beyond thereach of those reproaches which honorable and sensitive minds dislike to incur.It is not to illustrate any heroic achievements of a man, but to vindicate ajust and beneficent principle, in its application to the whole human family, byletting in the light of truth upon a system, esteemed by some as a blessing, andby others as a curse and a crime. I agree with you, that this system is now atthe bar of public opinion—not only of this country, but of the whole civilizedworld—for judgment. Its friends have made for it the usual plea—“not guilty;”the case must, therefore, proceed. Any facts, either from slaves, slaveholders,or by-standers, calculated to enlighten the public mind, by revealing the truenature, character, and tendency of the slave system, are in order, and canscarcely be innocently withheld.I see, too, that there are special reasons why I should write my own biography,in preference to employing another to do it. Not only is slavery on trial, butunfortunately, the enslaved people are also on trial. It is alleged, that theyare, naturally, inferior; that they are so low in the scale of humanity, and soutterly stupid, that they are unconscious of their wrongs, and do not apprehendtheir rights. Looking, then, at your request, from this stand-point, and wishingeverything of which you think me capable to go to the benefit of my afflictedpeople, I part with my doubts and hesitation, and proceed to furnish you thedesired manuscript; hoping that you may be able to make such arrangements forits publication as shall be best adapted to accomplish that good which you soenthusiastically anticipate.FREDERICK DOUGLASSThere was little necessity for doubt and hesitation on the part of Mr. Douglass,as to the propriety of his giving to the world a full account of himself. A manwho was born and brought up in slavery, a living witness of its horrors; whooften himself experienced its cruelties; and who, despite the depressinginfluences surrounding his birth, youth and manhood, has risen, from a dark andalmost absolute obscurity, to the distinguished position which he now occupies,might very well assume the existence of a commendable curiosity, on the part ofthe public, to know the facts of his remarkable history.EDITORINTRODUCTIONWhen a man raises himself from the lowest condition in society to the highest,mankind pay him the tribute of their admiration; when he accomplishes thiselevation by native energy, guided by prudence and wisdom, their admiration isincreased; but when his course, onward and upward, excellent in itself,furthermore proves a possible, what had hitherto been regarded as an impossible,reform, then he becomes a burning and a shining light, on which the aged maylook with gladness, the young with hope, and the down-trodden, as arepresentative of what they may themselves become. To such a man, dear reader,it is my privilege to introduce you.The life of Frederick Douglass, recorded in the pages which follow, is notmerely an example of self-elevation under the most adverse circumstances; it is,moreover, a noble vindication of the highest aims of the American anti-slaverymovement. The real object of that movement is not only to disenthrall, it is,also, to bestow upon the Negro the exercise of all those rights, from thepossession of which he has been so long debarred.But this full recognition of the colored man to the right, and the entireadmission of the same to the full privileges, political, religious and social,of manhood, requires powerful effort on the part of the enthralled, as well ason the part of those who would disenthrall them. The people at large must feelthe conviction, as well as admit the abstract logic, of human equality; theNegro, for the first time in the world’s history, brought in full contact withhigh civilization, must prove his title first to all that is demanded for him;in the teeth of unequal chances, he must prove himself equal to the mass ofthose who oppress him—therefore, absolutely superior to his apparent fate, andto their relative ability. And it is most cheering to the friends of freedom,today, that evidence of this equality is rapidly accumulating, not from theranks of the half-freed colored people of the free states, but from the verydepths of slavery itself; the indestructible equality of man to man isdemonstrated by the ease with which black men, scarce one remove frombarbarism—if slavery can be honored with such a distinction—vault into the highplaces of the most advanced and painfully acquired civilization. Ward andGarnett, Wells Brown and Pennington, Loguen and Douglass, are banners on theouter wall, under which abolition is fighting its most successful battles,because they are living exemplars of the practicability of the most radicalabolitionism; for, they were all of them born to the doom of slavery, some ofthem remained slaves until adult age, yet they all have not only won equality totheir white fellow citizens, in civil, religious, political and social rank, butthey have also illustrated and adorned our common country by their genius,learning and eloquence.The characteristics whereby Mr. Douglass has won first rank among theseremarkable men, and is still rising toward highest rank among living Americans,are abundantly laid bare in the book before us. Like the autobiography of HughMiller, it carries us so far back into early childhood, as to throw light uponthe question, “when positive and persistent memory begins in the human being.”And, like Hugh Miller, he must have been a shy old-fashioned child, occasionallyoppressed by what he could not well account for, peering and poking about amongthe layers of right and wrong, of tyrant and thrall, and the wonderfulness ofthat hopeless tide of things which brought power to one race, and unrequitedtoil to another, until, finally, he stumbled upon his “first-found Ammonite,”hidden away down in the depths of his own nature, and which revealed to him thefact that liberty and right, for all men, were anterior to slavery and wrong.When his knowledge of the world was bounded by the visible horizon on Col.Lloyd’s plantation, and while every thing around him bore a fixed, iron stamp,as if it had always been so, this was, for one so young, a notable discovery.To his uncommon memory, then, we must add a keen and accurate insight into menand things; an original breadth of common sense which enabled him to see, andweigh, and compare whatever passed before him, and which kindled a desire tosearch out and define their relations to other things not so patent, but whichnever succumbed to the marvelous nor the supernatural; a sacred thirst forliberty and for learning, first as a means of attaining liberty, then as an endin itself most desirable; a will; an unfaltering energy and determination toobtain what his soul pronounced desirable; a majestic self-hood; determinedcourage; a deep and agonizing sympathy with his embruted, crushed and bleedingfellow slaves, and an extraordinary depth of passion, together with that rarealliance between passion and intellect, which enables the former, when deeplyroused, to excite, develop and sustain the latter.With these original gifts in view, let us look at his schooling; the fearfuldiscipline through which it pleased God to prepare him for the high calling onwhich he has since entered—the advocacy of emancipation by the people who arenot slaves. And for this special mission, his plantation education was betterthan any he could have acquired in any lettered school. What he needed, wasfacts and experiences, welded to acutely wrought up sympathies, and these hecould not elsewhere have obtained, in a manner so peculiarly adapted to hisnature. His physical being was well trained, also, running wild until advancedinto boyhood; hard work and light diet, thereafter, and a skill in handicraft inyouth.For his special mission, then, this was, considered in connection with hisnatural gifts, a good schooling; and, for his special mission, he doubtless“left school” just at the proper moment. Had he remained longer in slavery—hadhe fretted under bonds until the ripening of manhood and its passions, until thedrear agony of slave-wife and slave-children had been piled upon his alreadybitter experiences—then, not only would his own history have had anothertermination, but the drama of American slavery would have been essentiallyvaried; for I cannot resist the belief, that the boy who learned to read andwrite as he did, who taught his fellow slaves these precious acquirements as hedid, who plotted for their mutual escape as he did, would, when a man at bay,strike a blow which would make slavery reel and stagger. Furthermore, blows andinsults he bore, at the moment, without resentment; deep but suppressed emotionrendered him insensible to their sting; but it was afterward, when the memory ofthem went seething through his brain, breeding a fiery indignation at hisinjured self-hood, that the resolve came to resist, and the time fixed when toresist, and the plot laid, how to resist; and he always kept his self-pledgedword. In what he undertook, in this line, he looked fate in the face, and had acool, keen look at the relation of means to ends. Henry Bibb, to avoidchastisement, strewed his master’s bed with charmed leaves and was whipped.Frederick Douglass quietly pocketed a like fetiche, compared his muscles withthose of Covey—and whipped him.In the history of his life in bondage, we find, well developed, that inherentand continuous energy of character which will ever render him distinguished.What his hand found to do, he did with his might; even while conscious that hewas wronged out of his daily earnings, he worked, and worked hard. At his dailylabor he went with a will; with keen, well set eye, brawny chest, lithe figure,and fair sweep of arm, he would have been king among calkers, had that been hismission.It must not be overlooked, in this glance at his education, that Mr. Douglasslacked one aid to which so many men of mark have been deeply indebted—he hadneither a mother’s care, nor a mother’s culture, save that which slaverygrudgingly meted out to him. Bitter nurse! may not even her features relax withhuman feeling, when she gazes at such offspring! How susceptible he was to thekindly influences of mother-culture, may be gathered from his own words, on page57: “It has been a life-long standing grief to me, that I know so little of mymother, and that I was so early separated from her. The counsels of her lovemust have been beneficial to me. The side view of her face is imaged on mymemory, and I take few steps in life, without feeling her presence; but theimage is mute, and I have no striking words of hers treasured up.”From the depths of chattel slavery in Maryland, our author escaped into thecaste-slavery of the north, in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Here he foundoppression assuming another, and hardly less bitter, form; of that veryhandicraft which the greed of slavery had taught him, his half-freedom deniedhim the exercise for an honest living; he found himself one of a class—freecolored men—whose position he has described in the following words:“Aliens are we in our native land. The fundamental principles of the republic,to which the humblest white man, whether born here or elsewhere, may appeal withconfidence, in the hope of awakening a favorable response, are held to beinapplicable to us. The glorious doctrines of your revolutionary fathers, andthe more glorious teachings of the Son of God, are construed and applied againstus. We are literally scourged beyond the beneficent range of both authorities,human and divine. * * * * American humanity hates us, scorns us, disowns anddenies, in a thousand ways, our very personality. The outspread wing of Americanchristianity, apparently broad enough to give shelter to a perishing world,refuses to cover us. To us, its bones are brass, and its features iron. Inrunning thither for shelter and succor, we have only fled from the hungryblood-hound to the devouring wolf—from a corrupt and selfish world, to a hollowand hypocritical church.”—Speech before American and Foreign Anti-SlaverySociety, May, 1854.Four years or more, from 1837 to 1841, he struggled on, in New Bedford, sawingwood, rolling casks, or doing what labor he might, to support himself and youngfamily; four years he brooded over the scars which slavery and semi-slavery hadinflicted upon his body and soul; and then, with his wounds yet unhealed, hefell among the Garrisonians—a glorious waif to those most ardent reformers. Ithappened one day, at Nantucket, that he, diffidently and reluctantly, was led toaddress an anti-slavery meeting. He was about the age when the younger Pittentered the House of Commons; like Pitt, too, he stood up a born orator.William Lloyd Garrison, who was happily present, writes thus of Mr. Douglass’maiden effort; “I shall never forget his first speech at the convention—theextraordinary emotion it excited in my own mind—the powerful impression itcreated upon a crowded auditory, completely taken by surprise. * * * I think Inever hated slavery so intensely as at that moment; certainly, my perception ofthe enormous outrage which is inflicted by it on the godlike nature of itsvictims, was rendered far more clear than ever. There stood one in physicalproportions and stature commanding and exact—in intellect richly endowed—innatural eloquence a prodigy.” 1[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-1]It is of interest to compare Mr. Douglass’s account of this meeting with Mr.Garrison’s. Of the two, I think the latter the most correct. It must have been agrand burst of eloquence! The pent up agony, indignation and pathos of an abusedand harrowed boyhood and youth, bursting out in all their freshness andoverwhelming earnestness!This unique introduction to its great leader, led immediately to the employmentof Mr. Douglass as an agent by the American Anti-Slavery Society. So far as hisself-relying and independent character would permit, he became, after thestrictest sect, a Garrisonian. It is not too much to say, that he formed acomplement which they needed, and they were a complement equally necessary tohis “make-up.” With his deep and keen sensitiveness to wrong, and his wonderfulmemory, he came from the land of bondage full of its woes and its evils, andpainting them in characters of living light; and, on his part, he found, toldout in sound Saxon phrase, all those principles of justice and right andliberty, which had dimly brooded over the dreams of his youth, seeking definiteforms and verbal expression. It must have been an electric flashing of thought,and a knitting of soul, granted to but few in this life, and will be a life-longmemory to those who participated in it. In the society, moreover, of WendellPhillips, Edmund Quincy, William Lloyd Garrison, and other men of earnest faithand refined culture, Mr. Douglass enjoyed the high advantage of their assistanceand counsel in the labor of self-culture, to which he now addressed himself withwonted energy. Yet, these gentlemen, although proud of Frederick Douglass,failed to fathom, and bring out to the light of day, the highest qualities ofhis mind; the force of their own education stood in their own way: they did notdelve into the mind of a colored man for capacities which the pride of race ledthem to believe to be restricted to their own Saxon blood. Bitter and vindictivesarcasm, irresistible mimicry, and a pathetic narrative of his own experiencesof slavery, were the intellectual manifestations which they encouraged him toexhibit on the platform or in the lecture desk.A visit to England, in 1845, threw Mr. Douglass among men and women of earnestsouls and high culture, and who, moreover, had never drank of the bitter watersof American caste. For the first time in his life, he breathed an atmospherecongenial to the longings of his spirit, and felt his manhood free andunrestricted. The cordial and manly greetings of the British and Irish audiencesin public, and the refinement and elegance of the social circles in which hemingled, not only as an equal, but as a recognized man of genius, were,doubtless, genial and pleasant resting places in his hitherto thorny andtroubled journey through life. There are joys on the earth, and, to thewayfaring fugitive from American slavery or American caste, this is one of them.But his sojourn in England was more than a joy to Mr. Douglass. Like theplatform at Nantucket, it awakened him to the consciousness of new powers thatlay in him. From the pupilage of Garrisonism he rose to the dignity of a teacherand a thinker; his opinions on the broader aspects of the great Americanquestion were earnestly and incessantly sought, from various points of view, andhe must, perforce, bestir himself to give suitable answer. With that prompt andtruthful perception which has led their sisters in all ages of the world togather at the feet and support the hands of reformers, the gentlewomen ofEngland 2[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-2]were foremost to encourage and strengthen him to carve out for himself a pathfitted to his powers and energies, in the life-battle against slavery and casteto which he was pledged. And one stirring thought, inseparable from the Britishidea of the evangel of freedom, must have smote his ear from every side— Hereditary bondmen! know ye not Who would be free, themselves mast strike the blow?The result of this visit was, that on his return to the United States, heestablished a newspaper. This proceeding was sorely against the wishes and theadvice of the leaders of the American Anti-Slavery Society, but our author hadfully grown up to the conviction of a truth which they had once promulged, butnow forgotten, to wit: that in their own elevation—self-elevation—colored menhave a blow to strike “on their own hook,” against slavery and caste. Differingfrom his Boston friends in this matter, diffident in his own abilities,reluctant at their dissuadings, how beautiful is the loyalty with which he stillclung to their principles in all things else, and even in this.Now came the trial hour. Without cordial support from any large body of men orparty on this side the Atlantic, and too far distant in space and immediateinterest to expect much more, after the much already done, on the other side, hestood up, almost alone, to the arduous labor and heavy expenditure of editor andlecturer. The Garrison party, to which he still adhered, did not want a colorednewspaper—there was an odor of caste about it; the Liberty party could hardly beexpected to give warm support to a man who smote their principles as with ahammer; and the wide gulf which separated the free colored people from theGarrisonians, also separated them from their brother, Frederick Douglass.The arduous nature of his labors, from the date of the establishment of hispaper, may be estimated by the fact, that anti-slavery papers in the UnitedStates, even while organs of, and when supported by, anti-slavery parties, have,with a single exception, failed to pay expenses. Mr. Douglass has maintained,and does maintain, his paper without the support of any party, and even in theteeth of the opposition of those from whom he had reason to expect counsel andencouragement. He has been compelled, at one and the same time, and almostconstantly, during the past seven years, to contribute matter to its columns aseditor, and to raise funds for its support as lecturer. It is within bounds tosay, that he has expended twelve thousand dollars of his own hard earned money,in publishing this paper, a larger sum than has been contributed by any oneindividual for the general advancement of the colored people. There had beenmany other papers published and edited by colored men, beginning as far back as1827, when the Rev. Samuel E. Cornish and John B. Russworm (a graduate ofBowdoin college, and afterward Governor of Cape Palmas) published the Freedom’sJournal, in New York City; probably not less than one hundred newspaperenterprises have been started in the United States, by free colored men, bornfree, and some of them of liberal education and fair talents for this work; but,one after another, they have fallen through, although, in several instances,anti-slavery friends contributed to their support. 3[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-3] Ithad almost been given up, as an impracticable thing, to maintain a colorednewspaper, when Mr. Douglass, with fewest early advantages of all hiscompetitors, essayed, and has proved the thing perfectly practicable, and,moreover, of great public benefit. This paper, in addition to its power inholding up the hands of those to whom it is especially devoted, also affordsirrefutable evidence of the justice, safety and practicability of ImmediateEmancipation; it further proves the immense loss which slavery inflicts on theland while it dooms such energies as his to the hereditary degradation ofslavery.It has been said in this Introduction, that Mr. Douglass had raised himself byhis own efforts to the highest position in society. As a successful editor, inour land, he occupies this position. Our editors rule the land, and he is one ofthem. As an orator and thinker, his position is equally high, in the opinion ofhis countrymen. If a stranger in the United States would seek its mostdistinguished men—the movers of public opinion—he will find their namesmentioned, and their movements chronicled, under the head of “BY MAGNETICTELEGRAPH,” in the daily papers. The keen caterers for the public attention, setdown, in this column, such men only as have won high mark in the public esteem.During the past winter—1854-5—very frequent mention of Frederick Douglass wasmade under this head in the daily papers; his name glided as often—this weekfrom Chicago, next week from Boston—over the lightning wires, as the name of anyother man, of whatever note. To no man did the people more widely nor moreearnestly say, “Tell me thy thought!” And, somehow or other, revolution seemedto follow in his wake. His were not the mere words of eloquence which Kossuthspeaks of, that delight the ear and then pass away. No! They were work-able,do-able words, that brought forth fruits in the revolution in Illinois, and inthe passage of the franchise resolutions by the Assembly of New York.And the secret of his power, what is it? He is a Representative American man—atype of his countrymen. Naturalists tell us that a full grown man is a resultantor representative of all animated nature on this globe; beginning with the earlyembryo state, then representing the lowest forms of organic life, 4[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-4]and passing through every subordinate grade or type, until he reaches the lastand highest—manhood. In like manner, and to the fullest extent, has FrederickDouglass passed through every gradation of rank comprised in our nationalmake-up, and bears upon his person and upon his soul every thing that isAmerican. And he has not only full sympathy with every thing American; hisproclivity or bent, to active toil and visible progress, are in the strictlynational direction, delighting to outstrip “all creation.”Nor have the natural gifts, already named as his, lost anything by his severetraining. When unexcited, his mental processes are probably slow, but singularlyclear in perception, and wide in vision, the unfailing memory bringing up allthe facts in their every aspect; incongruities he lays hold of incontinently,and holds up on the edge of his keen and telling wit. But this wit neverdescends to frivolity; it is rigidly in the keeping of his truthful commonsense, and always used in illustration or proof of some point which could not soreadily be reached any other way. “Beware of a Yankee when he is feeding,” is ashaft that strikes home in a matter never so laid bare by satire before. “TheGarrisonian views of disunion, if carried to a successful issue, would onlyplace the people of the north in the same relation to American slavery whichthey now bear to the slavery of Cuba or the Brazils,” is a statement, in a fewwords, which contains the result and the evidence of an argument which mightcover pages, but could not carry stronger conviction, nor be stated in lesspregnable form. In proof of this, I may say, that having been submitted to theattention of the Garrisonians in print, in March, it was repeated before them attheir business meeting in May—the platform, par excellence, on which they invitefree fight, a l’outrance, to all comers. It was given out in the clear, ringingtones, wherewith the hall of shields was wont to resound of old, yet neitherGarrison, nor Phillips, nor May, nor Remond, nor Foster, nor Burleigh, with hissubtle steel of “the ice brook’s temper,” ventured to break a lance upon it! Thedoctrine of the dissolution of the Union, as a means for the abolition ofAmerican slavery, was silenced upon the lips that gave it birth, and in thepresence of an array of defenders who compose the keenest intellects in theland.“The man who is right is a majority” is an aphorism struck out by Mr. Douglassin that great gathering of the friends of freedom, at Pittsburgh, in 1852, wherehe towered among the highest, because, with abilities inferior to none, andmoved more deeply than any, there was neither policy nor party to trammel theoutpourings of his soul. Thus we find, opposed to all disadvantages which ablack man in the United States labors and struggles under, is this one vantageground—when the chance comes, and the audience where he may have a say, hestands forth the freest, most deeply moved and most earnest of all men.It has been said of Mr. Douglass, that his descriptive and declamatory powers,admitted to be of the very highest order, take precedence of his logical force.Whilst the schools might have trained him to the exhibition of the formulas ofdeductive logic, nature and circumstances forced him into the exercise of thehigher faculties required by induction. The first ninety pages of this “Life inBondage,” afford specimens of observing, comparing, and careful classifying, ofsuch superior character, that it is difficult to believe them the results of achild’s thinking; he questions the earth, and the children and the slaves aroundhim again and again, and finally looks to “God in the sky” for the why and thewherefore of the unnatural thing, slavery. “Yes, if indeed thou art, whereforedost thou suffer us to be slain?” is the only prayer and worship of theGod-forsaken Dodos in the heart of Africa. Almost the same was his prayer. Oneof his earliest observations was that white children should know their ages,while the colored children were ignorant of theirs; and the songs of the slavesgrated on his inmost soul, because a something told him that harmony in sound,and music of the spirit, could not consociate with miserable degradation.To such a mind, the ordinary processes of logical deduction are like provingthat two and two make four. Mastering the intermediate steps by an intuitiveglance, or recurring to them as Ferguson resorted to geometry, it goes down tothe deeper relation of things, and brings out what may seem, to some, merestatements, but which are new and brilliant generalizations, each resting on abroad and stable basis. Thus, Chief Justice Marshall gave his decisions, andthen told Brother Story to look up the authorities—and they never differed fromhim. Thus, also, in his “Lecture on the Anti-Slavery Movement,” delivered beforethe Rochester Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Society, Mr. Douglass presents a mass ofthought, which, without any showy display of logic on his part, requires anexercise of the reasoning faculties of the reader to keep pace with him. And his“Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered,” is full of new and freshthoughts on the dawning science of race-history.If, as has been stated, his intellection is slow, when unexcited, it is mostprompt and rapid when he is thoroughly aroused. Memory, logic, wit, sarcasm,invective pathos and bold imagery of rare structural beauty, well up as from acopious fountain, yet each in its proper place, and contributing to form awhole, grand in itself, yet complete in the minutest proportions. It is mostdifficult to hedge him in a corner, for his positions are taken so deliberately,that it is rare to find a point in them undefended aforethought. ProfessorReason tells me the following: “On a recent visit of a public nature, toPhiladelphia, and in a meeting composed mostly of his colored brethren, Mr.Douglass proposed a comparison of views in the matters of the relations andduties of ‘our people;’ he holding that prejudice was the result of condition,and could be conquered by the efforts of the degraded themselves. A gentlemanpresent, distinguished for logical acumen and subtlety, and who had devoted nosmall portion of the last twenty-five years to the study and elucidation of thisvery question, held the opposite view, that prejudice is innate andunconquerable. He terminated a series of well dove-tailed, Socratic questions toMr. Douglass, with the following: ‘If the legislature at Harrisburgh shouldawaken, to-morrow morning, and find each man’s skin turned black and his hairwoolly, what could they do to remove prejudice?’ ‘Immediately pass lawsentitling black men to all civil, political and social privileges,’ was theinstant reply—and the questioning ceased.”The most remarkable mental phenomenon in Mr. Douglass, is his style in writingand speaking. In March, 1855, he delivered an address in the assembly chamberbefore the members of the legislature of the state of New York. An eye witness 5[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-5]describes the crowded and most intelligent audience, and their rapt attention tothe speaker, as the grandest scene he ever witnessed in the capitol. Among thosewhose eyes were riveted on the speaker full two hours and a half, were ThurlowWeed and Lieutenant Governor Raymond; the latter, at the conclusion of theaddress, exclaimed to a friend, “I would give twenty thousand dollars, if Icould deliver that address in that manner.” Mr. Raymond is a first classgraduate of Dartmouth, a rising politician, ranking foremost in the legislature;of course, his ideal of oratory must be of the most polished and finisheddescription.The style of Mr. Douglass in writing, is to me an intellectual puzzle. Thestrength, affluence and terseness may easily be accounted for, because the styleof a man is the man; but how are we to account for that rare polish in his styleof writing, which, most critically examined, seems the result of careful earlyculture among the best classics of our language; it equals if it does notsurpass the style of Hugh Miller, which was the wonder of the British literarypublic, until he unraveled the mystery in the most interesting ofautobiographies. But Frederick Douglass was still calking the seams of Baltimoreclippers, and had only written a “pass,” at the age when Miller’s style wasalready formed.I asked William Whipper, of Pennsylvania, the gentleman alluded to above,whether he thought Mr. Douglass’s power inherited from the Negroid, or from whatis called the Caucasian side of his make up? After some reflection, he franklyanswered, “I must admit, although sorry to do so, that the Caucasianpredominates.” At that time, I almost agreed with him; but, facts narrated inthe first part of this work, throw a different light on this interestingquestion.We are left in the dark as to who was the paternal ancestor of our author; afact which generally holds good of the Romuluses and Remuses who are toinaugurate the new birth of our republic. In the absence of testimony from theCaucasian side, we must see what evidence is given on the other side of thehouse.“My grandmother, though advanced in years, * * * was yet a woman of power andspirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic and muscular.” (p. 46.)After describing her skill in constructing nets, her perseverance in using them,and her wide-spread fame in the agricultural way he adds, “It happened to her—asit will happen to any careful and thrifty person residing in an ignorant andimprovident neighborhood—to enjoy the reputation of being born to good luck.”And his grandmother was a black woman.“My mother was tall, and finely proportioned; of deep black, glossy complexion;had regular features; and among other slaves was remarkably sedate in hermanners.” “Being a field hand, she was obliged to walk twelve miles and return,between nightfall and daybreak, to see her children” (p. 54.) “I shall neverforget the indescribable expression of her countenance when I told her that Ihad had no food since morning. * * * There was pity in her glance at me, and afiery indignation at Aunt Katy at the same time; * * * * she read Aunt Katy alecture which she never forgot.” (p. 56.) “I learned after my mother’s death,that she could read, and that she was the only one of all the slaves and coloredpeople in Tuckahoe who enjoyed that advantage. How she acquired this knowledge,I know not, for Tuckahoe is the last place in the world where she would be aptto find facilities for learning.” (p. 57.) “There is, in Prichard’s NaturalHistory of Man, the head of a figure—on page 157—the features of which soresemble those of my mother, that I often recur to it with something of thefeeling which I suppose others experience when looking upon the pictures of deardeparted ones.” (p. 52.)The head alluded to is copied from the statue of Ramses the Great, an Egyptianking of the nineteenth dynasty. The authors of the Types of Mankind give a sideview of the same on page 148, remarking that the profile, “like Napoleon’s, issuperbly European!” The nearness of its resemblance to Mr. Douglass’ motherrests upon the evidence of his memory, and judging from his almost marvelousfeats of recollection of forms and outlines recorded in this book, thistestimony may be admitted.These facts show that for his energy, perseverance, eloquence, invective,sagacity, and wide sympathy, he is indebted to his Negro blood. The very marvelof his style would seem to be a development of that other marvel—how his motherlearned to read. The versatility of talent which he wields, in common withDumas, Ira Aldridge, and Miss Greenfield, would seem to be the result of thegrafting of the Anglo-Saxon on good, original, Negro stock. If the friends of“Caucasus” choose to claim, for that region, what remains after this analysis—towit: combination—they are welcome to it. They will forgive me for reminding themthat the term “Caucasian” is dropped by recent writers on Ethnology; for thepeople about Mount Caucasus, are, and have ever been, Mongols. The great “whiterace” now seek paternity, according to Dr. Pickering, in Arabia—“Arida Nutrix”of the best breed of horses &c. Keep on, gentlemen; you will find yourselves inAfrica, by-and-by. The Egyptians, like the Americans, were a mixed race, withsome Negro blood circling around the throne, as well as in the mud hovels.This is the proper place to remark of our author, that the same strongself-hood, which led him to measure strength with Mr. Covey, and to wrenchhimself from the embrace of the Garrisonians, and which has borne him throughmany resistances to the personal indignities offered him as a colored man,sometimes becomes a hyper-sensitiveness to such assaults as men of his mark willmeet with, on paper. Keen and unscrupulous opponents have sought, and notunsuccessfully, to pierce him in this direction; for well they know, that ifassailed, he will smite back.It is not without a feeling of pride, dear reader, that I present you with thisbook. The son of a self-emancipated bond-woman, I feel joy in introducing to youmy brother, who has rent his own bonds, and who, in his every relation—as apublic man, as a husband and as a father—is such as does honor to the land whichgave him birth. I shall place this book in the hands of the only child sparedme, bidding him to strive and emulate its noble example. You may do likewise. Itis an American book, for Americans, in the fullest sense of the idea. It showsthat the worst of our institutions, in its worst aspect, cannot keep downenergy, truthfulness, and earnest struggle for the right. It proves the justiceand practicability of Immediate Emancipation. It shows that any man in our land,“no matter in what battle his liberty may have been cloven down, * * * * nomatter what complexion an Indian or an African sun may have burned upon him,”not only may “stand forth redeemed and disenthralled,” but may also stand up acandidate for the highest suffrage of a great people—the tribute of theirhonest, hearty admiration.

CHILDHOODPLACE OF BIRTH—CHARACTER OF THE DISTRICT—TUCKAHOE—ORIGIN OF THENAME—CHOPTANK RIVER—TIME OF BIRTH—GENEALOGICAL TREES—MODE OFCOUNTING TIME—NAMES OF GRANDPARENTS—THEIR POSITION—GRANDMOTHERESPECIALLY ESTEEMED—“BORN TO GOOD LUCK”—SWEETPOTATOES—SUPERSTITION—THE LOG CABIN—ITS CHARMS—SEPARATINGCHILDREN—MY AUNTS—THEIR NAMES—FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF BEING A SLAVE—OLDMASTER—GRIEFS AND JOYS OF CHILDHOOD—COMPARATIVE HAPPINESS OF THESLAVE-BOY AND THE SON OF A SLAVEHOLDER.In Talbot county, Eastern Shore, Maryland, near Easton, the county town of thatcounty, there is a small district of country, thinly populated, and remarkablefor nothing that I know of more than for the worn-out, sandy, desert-likeappearance of its soil, the general dilapidation of its farms and fences, theindigent and spiritless character of its inhabitants, and the prevalence of agueand fever.The name of this singularly unpromising and truly famine stricken district isTuckahoe, a name well known to all Marylanders, black and white. It was given tothis section of country probably, at the first, merely in derision; or it maypossibly have been applied to it, as I have heard, because some one of itsearlier inhabitants had been guilty of the petty meanness of stealing a hoe—ortaking a hoe that did not belong to him. Eastern Shore men usually pronounce theword took, as tuck; Took-a-hoe, therefore, is, in Maryland parlance, Tuckahoe.But, whatever may have been its origin—and about this I will not bepositive—that name has stuck to the district in question; and it is seldommentioned but with contempt and derision, on account of the barrenness of itssoil, and the ignorance, indolence, and poverty of its people. Decay and ruinare everywhere visible, and the thin population of the place would have quittedit long ago, but for the Choptank river, which runs through it, from which theytake abundance of shad and herring, and plenty of ague and fever.It was in this dull, flat, and unthrifty district, or neighborhood, surroundedby a white population of the lowest order, indolent and drunken to a proverb,and among slaves, who seemed to ask, “Oh! what’s the use?” every time theylifted a hoe, that I—without any fault of mine was born, and spent the firstyears of my childhood.The reader will pardon so much about the place of my birth, on the score that itis always a fact of some importance to know where a man is born, if, indeed, itbe important to know anything about him. In regard to the time of my birth, Icannot be as definite as I have been respecting the place. Nor, indeed, can Iimpart much knowledge concerning my parents. Genealogical trees do not flourishamong slaves. A person of some consequence here in the north, sometimesdesignated father, is literally abolished in slave law and slave practice. It isonly once in a while that an exception is found to this statement. I never metwith a slave who could tell me how old he was. Few slave-mothers know anythingof the months of the year, nor of the days of the month. They keep no familyrecords, with marriages, births, and deaths. They measure the ages of theirchildren by spring time, winter time, harvest time, planting time, and the like;but these soon become undistinguishable and forgotten. Like other slaves, Icannot tell how old I am. This destitution was among my earliest troubles. Ilearned when I grew up, that my master—and this is the case with mastersgenerally—allowed no questions to be put to him, by which a slave might learnhis age. Such questions deemed evidence of impatience, and even of impudentcuriosity. From certain events, however, the dates of which I have sincelearned, I suppose myself to have been born about the year 1817.The first experience of life with me that I now remember—and I remember it buthazily—began in the family of my grandmother and grandfather. Betsey and IsaacBaily. They were quite advanced in life, and had long lived on the spot wherethey then resided. They were considered old settlers in the neighborhood, and,from certain circumstances, I infer that my grandmother, especially, was held inhigh esteem, far higher than is the lot of most colored persons in the slavestates. She was a good nurse, and a capital hand at making nets for catchingshad and herring; and these nets were in great demand, not only in Tuckahoe, butat Denton and Hillsboro, neighboring villages. She was not only good at makingthe nets, but was also somewhat famous for her good fortune in taking the fishesreferred to. I have known her to be in the water half the day. Grandmother waslikewise more provident than most of her neighbors in the preservation ofseedling sweet potatoes, and it happened to her—as it will happen to any carefuland thrifty person residing in an ignorant and improvident community—to enjoythe reputation of having been born to “good luck.” Her “good luck” was owing tothe exceeding care which she took in preventing the succulent root from gettingbruised in the digging, and in placing it beyond the reach of frost, by actuallyburying it under the hearth of her cabin during the winter months. In the timeof planting sweet potatoes, “Grandmother Betty,” as she was familiarly called,was sent for in all directions, simply to place the seedling potatoes in thehills; for superstition had it, that if “Grandmamma Betty but touches them atplanting, they will be sure to grow and flourish.” This high reputation was fullof advantage to her, and to the children around her. Though Tuckahoe had but fewof the good things of life, yet of such as it did possess grandmother got a fullshare, in the way of presents. If good potato crops came after her planting, shewas not forgotten by those for whom she planted; and as she was remembered byothers, so she remembered the hungry little ones around her.The dwelling of my grandmother and grandfather had few pretensions. It was a loghut, or cabin, built of clay, wood, and straw. At a distance it resembled—thoughit was smaller, less commodious and less substantial—the cabins erected in thewestern states by the first settlers. To my child’s eye, however, it was a noblestructure, admirably adapted to promote the comforts and conveniences of itsinmates. A few rough, Virginia fence-rails, flung loosely over the raftersabove, answered the triple purpose of floors, ceilings, and bedsteads. To besure, this upper apartment was reached only by a ladder—but what in the worldfor climbing could be better than a ladder? To me, this ladder was really a highinvention, and possessed a sort of charm as I played with delight upon therounds of it. In this little hut there was a large family of children: I darenot say how many. My grandmother—whether because too old for field service, orbecause she had so faithfully discharged the duties of her station in earlylife, I know not—enjoyed the high privilege of living in a cabin, separate fromthe quarter, with no other burden than her own support, and the necessary careof the little children, imposed. She evidently esteemed it a great fortune tolive so. The children were not her own, but her grandchildren—the children ofher daughters. She took delight in having them around her, and in attending totheir few wants. The practice of separating children from their mother, andhiring the latter out at distances too great to admit of their meeting, exceptat long intervals, is a marked feature of the cruelty and barbarity of the slavesystem. But it is in harmony with the grand aim of slavery, which, always andeverywhere, is to reduce man to a level with the brute. It is a successfulmethod of obliterating from the mind and heart of the slave, all just ideas ofthe sacredness of the family, as an institution.Most of the children, however, in this instance, being the children of mygrandmother’s daughters, the notions of family, and the reciprocal duties andbenefits of the relation, had a better chance of being understood than wherechildren are placed—as they often are in the hands of strangers, who have nocare for them, apart from the wishes of their masters. The daughters of mygrandmother were five in number. Their names were JENNY, ESTHER, MILLY,PRISCILLA, and HARRIET. The daughter last named was my mother, of whom thereader shall learn more by-and-by.Living here, with my dear old grandmother and grandfather, it was a long timebefore I knew myself to be a slave. I knew many other things before I knew that.Grandmother and grandfather were the greatest people in the world to me; andbeing with them so snugly in their own little cabin—I supposed it be theirown—knowing no higher authority over me or the other children than the authorityof grandmamma, for a time there was nothing to disturb me; but, as I grew largerand older, I learned by degrees the sad fact, that the “little hut,” and the loton which it stood, belonged not to my dear old grandparents, but to some personwho lived a great distance off, and who was called, by grandmother, “OLDMASTER.” I further learned the sadder fact, that not only the house and lot, butthat grandmother herself, (grandfather was free,) and all the little childrenaround her, belonged to this mysterious personage, called by grandmother, withevery mark of reverence, “Old Master.” Thus early did clouds and shadows beginto fall upon my path. Once on the track—troubles never come singly—I was notlong in finding out another fact, still more grievous to my childish heart. Iwas told that this “old master,” whose name seemed ever to be mentioned withfear and shuddering, only allowed the children to live with grandmother for alimited time, and that in fact as soon as they were big enough, they werepromptly taken away, to live with the said “old master.” These were distressingrevelations indeed; and though I was quite too young to comprehend the fullimport of the intelligence, and mostly spent my childhood days in gleesomesports with the other children, a shade of disquiet rested upon me.The absolute power of this distant “old master” had touched my young spirit withbut the point of its cold, cruel iron, and left me something to brood over afterthe play and in moments of repose. Grandmammy was, indeed, at that time, all theworld to me; and the thought of being separated from her, in any considerabletime, was more than an unwelcome intruder. It was intolerable.Children have their sorrows as well as men and women; and it would be well toremember this in our dealings with them. SLAVE-children are children, and proveno exceptions to the general rule. The liability to be separated from mygrandmother, seldom or never to see her again, haunted me. I dreaded the thoughtof going to live with that mysterious “old master,” whose name I never heardmentioned with affection, but always with fear. I look back to this as among theheaviest of my childhood’s sorrows. My grandmother! my grandmother! and thelittle hut, and the joyous circle under her care, but especially she, who madeus sorry when she left us but for an hour, and glad on her return,—how could Ileave her and the good old home?But the sorrows of childhood, like the pleasures of after life, are transient.It is not even within the power of slavery to write indelible sorrow, at asingle dash, over the heart of a child. The tear down childhood’s cheek that flows, Is like the dew-drop on the rose— When next the summer breeze comes by, And waves the bush—the flower is dry.There is, after all, but little difference in the measure of contentment felt bythe slave-child neglected and the slaveholder’s child cared for and petted. Thespirit of the All Just mercifully holds the balance for the young.The slaveholder, having nothing to fear from impotent childhood, easily affordsto refrain from cruel inflictions; and if cold and hunger do not pierce thetender frame, the first seven or eight years of the slave-boy’s life are aboutas full of sweet content as those of the most favored and petted white childrenof the slaveholder. The slave-boy escapes many troubles which befall and vex hiswhite brother. He seldom has to listen to lectures on propriety of behavior, oron anything else. He is never chided for handling his little knife and forkimproperly or awkwardly, for he uses none. He is never reprimanded for soilingthe table-cloth, for he takes his meals on the clay floor. He never has themisfortune, in his games or sports, of soiling or tearing his clothes, for hehas almost none to soil or tear. He is never expected to act like a nice littlegentleman, for he is only a rude little slave. Thus, freed from all restraint,the slave-boy can be, in his life and conduct, a genuine boy, doing whatever hisboyish nature suggests; enacting, by turns, all the strange antics and freaks ofhorses, dogs, pigs, and barn-door fowls, without in any manner compromising hisdignity, or incurring reproach of any sort. He literally runs wild; has nopretty little verses to learn in the nursery; no nice little speeches to makefor aunts, uncles, or cousins, to show how smart he is; and, if he can onlymanage to keep out of the way of the heavy feet and fists of the older slaveboys, he may trot on, in his joyous and roguish tricks, as happy as any littleheathen under the palm trees of Africa. To be sure, he is occasionally reminded,when he stumbles in the path of his master—and this he early learns toavoid—that he is eating his “white bread,” and that he will be made to “seesights” by-and-by. The threat is soon forgotten; the shadow soon passes, and oursable boy continues to roll in the dust, or play in the mud, as bests suits him,and in the veriest freedom. If he feels uncomfortable, from mud or from dust,the coast is clear; he can plunge into the river or the pond, without theceremony of undressing, or the fear of wetting his clothes; his little tow-linenshirt—for that is all he has on—is easily dried; and it needed ablution as muchas did his skin. His food is of the coarsest kind, consisting for the most partof cornmeal mush, which often finds it way from the wooden tray to his mouth inan oyster shell. His days, when the weather is warm, are spent in the pure, openair, and in the bright sunshine. He always sleeps in airy apartments; he seldomhas to take powders, or to be paid to swallow pretty little sugar-coated pills,to cleanse his blood, or to quicken his appetite. He eats no candies; gets nolumps of loaf sugar; always relishes his food; cries but little, for nobodycares for his crying; learns to esteem his bruises but slight, because others soesteem them. In a word, he is, for the most part of the first eight years of hislife, a spirited, joyous, uproarious, and happy boy, upon whom troubles fallonly like water on a duck’s back. And such a boy, so far as I can now remember,was the boy whose life in slavery I am now narrating.CHAPTER II. REMOVED FROM MY FIRST HOMETHE NAME “OLD MASTER” A TERROR—COLONEL LLOYD’S PLANTATION—WYERIVER—WHENCE ITS NAME—POSITION OF THE LLOYDS—HOME ATTRACTION—MEETOFFERING—JOURNEY FROM TUCKAHOE TO WYE RIVER—SCENE ON REACHING OLDMASTER’S—DEPARTURE OF GRANDMOTHER—STRANGE MEETING OF SISTERS ANDBROTHERS—REFUSAL TO BE COMFORTED—SWEET SLEEP.That mysterious individual referred to in the first chapter as an object ofterror among the inhabitants of our little cabin, under the ominous title of“old master,” was really a man of some consequence. He owned several farms inTuckahoe; was the chief clerk and butler on the home plantation of Col. EdwardLloyd; had overseers on his own farms; and gave directions to overseers on thefarms belonging to Col. Lloyd. This plantation is situated on Wye river—theriver receiving its name, doubtless, from Wales, where the Lloyds originated.They (the Lloyds) are an old and honored family in Maryland, exceedinglywealthy. The home plantation, where they have resided, perhaps for a century ormore, is one of the largest, most fertile, and best appointed, in the state.About this plantation, and about that queer old master—who must be somethingmore than a man, and something worse than an angel—the reader will easilyimagine that I was not only curious, but eager, to know all that could be known.Unhappily for me, however, all the information I could get concerning himincreased my great dread of being carried thither—of being separated from anddeprived of the protection of my grandmother and grandfather. It was, evidently,a great thing to go to Col. Lloyd’s; and I was not without a little curiosity tosee the place; but no amount of coaxing could induce in me the wish to remainthere. The fact is, such was my dread of leaving the little cabin, that I wishedto remain little forever, for I knew the taller I grew the shorter my stay. Theold cabin, with its rail floor and rail bedsteads upstairs, and its clay floordownstairs, and its dirt chimney, and windowless sides, and that most curiouspiece of workmanship dug in front of the fireplace, beneath which grandmammyplaced the sweet potatoes to keep them from the frost, was MY HOME—the only homeI ever had; and I loved it, and all connected with it. The old fences around it,and the stumps in the edge of the woods near it, and the squirrels that ran,skipped, and played upon them, were objects of interest and affection. There,too, right at the side of the hut, stood the old well, with its stately andskyward-pointing beam, so aptly placed between the limbs of what had once been atree, and so nicely balanced that I could move it up and down with only onehand, and could get a drink myself without calling for help. Where else in theworld could such a well be found, and where could such another home be met with?Nor were these all the attractions of the place. Down in a little valley, notfar from grandmammy’s cabin, stood Mr. Lee’s mill, where the people came oftenin large numbers to get their corn ground. It was a watermill; and I never shallbe able to tell the many things thought and felt, while I sat on the bank andwatched that mill, and the turning of that ponderous wheel. The mill-pond, too,had its charms; and with my pinhook, and thread line, I could get nibbles, if Icould catch no fish. But, in all my sports and plays, and in spite of them,there would, occasionally, come the painful foreboding that I was not long toremain there, and that I must soon be called away to the home of old master.I was A SLAVE—born a slave and though the fact was in comprehensible to me, itconveyed to my mind a sense of my entire dependence on the will of somebody Ihad never seen; and, from some cause or other, I had been made to fear thissomebody above all else on earth. Born for another’s benefit, as the firstlingof the cabin flock I was soon to be selected as a meet offering to the fearfuland inexorable demigod, whose huge image on so many occasions haunted mychildhood’s imagination. When the time of my departure was decided upon, mygrandmother, knowing my fears, and in pity for them, kindly kept me ignorant ofthe dreaded event about to transpire. Up to the morning (a beautiful summermorning) when we were to start, and, indeed, during the whole journey—a journeywhich, child as I was, I remember as well as if it were yesterday—she kept thesad fact hidden from me. This reserve was necessary; for, could I have knownall, I should have given grandmother some trouble in getting me started. As itwas, I was helpless, and she—dear woman!—led me along by the hand, resisting,with the reserve and solemnity of a priestess, all my inquiring looks to thelast.The distance from Tuckahoe to Wye river—where my old master lived—was fulltwelve miles, and the walk was quite a severe test of the endurance of my younglegs. The journey would have proved too severe for me, but that my dear oldgrandmother—blessings on her memory!—afforded occasional relief by “toting” me(as Marylanders have it) on her shoulder. My grandmother, though advanced inyears—as was evident from more than one gray hair, which peeped from between theample and graceful folds of her newly-ironed bandana turban—was yet a woman ofpower and spirit. She was marvelously straight in figure, elastic, and muscular.I seemed hardly to be a burden to her. She would have “toted” me farther, butthat I felt myself too much of a man to allow it, and insisted on walking.Releasing dear grandmamma from carrying me, did not make me altogetherindependent of her, when we happened to pass through portions of the somberwoods which lay between Tuckahoe and Wye river. She often found me increasingthe energy of my grip, and holding her clothing, lest something should come outof the woods and eat me up. Several old logs and stumps imposed upon me, and gotthemselves taken for wild beasts. I could see their legs, eyes, and ears, or Icould see something like eyes, legs, and ears, till I got close enough to themto see that the eyes were knots, washed white with rain, and the legs werebroken limbs, and the ears, only ears owing to the point from which they wereseen. Thus early I learned that the point from which a thing is viewed is ofsome importance.As the day advanced the heat increased; and it was not until the afternoon thatwe reached the much dreaded end of the journey. I found myself in the midst of agroup of children of many colors; black, brown, copper colored, and nearlywhite. I had not seen so many children before. Great houses loomed up indifferent directions, and a great many men and women were at work in the fields.All this hurry, noise, and singing was very different from the stillness ofTuckahoe. As a new comer, I was an object of special interest; and, afterlaughing and yelling around me, and playing all sorts of wild tricks, they (thechildren) asked me to go out and play with them. This I refused to do,preferring to stay with grandmamma. I could not help feeling that our beingthere boded no good to me. Grandmamma looked sad. She was soon to lose anotherobject of affection, as she had lost many before. I knew she was unhappy, andthe shadow fell from her brow on me, though I knew not the cause.All suspense, however, must have an end; and the end of mine, in this instance,was at hand. Affectionately patting me on the head, and exhorting me to be agood boy, grandmamma told me to go and play with the little children. “They arekin to you,” said she; “go and play with them.” Among a number of cousins werePhil, Tom, Steve, and Jerry, Nance and Betty.Grandmother pointed out my brother PERRY, my sister SARAH, and my sister ELIZA,who stood in the group. I had never seen my brother nor my sisters before; and,though I had sometimes heard of them, and felt a curious interest in them, Ireally did not understand what they were to me, or I to them. We were brothersand sisters, but what of that? Why should they be attached to me, or I to them?Brothers and sisters we were by blood; but slavery had made us strangers. Iheard the words brother and sisters, and knew they must mean something; butslavery had robbed these terms of their true meaning. The experience throughwhich I was passing, they had passed through before. They had already beeninitiated into the mysteries of old master’s domicile, and they seemed to lookupon me with a certain degree of compassion; but my heart clave to mygrandmother. Think it not strange, dear reader, that so little sympathy offeeling existed between us. The conditions of brotherly and sisterly feelingwere wanting—we had never nestled and played together. My poor mother, like manyother slave-women, had many children, but NO FAMILY! The domestic hearth, withits holy lessons and precious endearments, is abolished in the case of aslave-mother and her children. “Little children, love one another,” are wordsseldom heard in a slave cabin.I really wanted to play with my brother and sisters, but they were strangers tome, and I was full of fear that grandmother might leave without taking me withher. Entreated to do so, however, and that, too, by my dear grandmother, I wentto the back part of the house, to play with them and the other children. Play,however, I did not, but stood with my back against the wall, witnessing theplaying of the others. At last, while standing there, one of the children, whohad been in the kitchen, ran up to me, in a sort of roguish glee, exclaiming,“Fed, Fed! grandmammy gone! grandmammy gone!” I could not believe it; yet,fearing the worst, I ran into the kitchen, to see for myself, and found it evenso. Grandmammy had indeed gone, and was now far away, “clean” out of sight. Ineed not tell all that happened now. Almost heart-broken at the discovery, Ifell upon the ground, and wept a boy’s bitter tears, refusing to be comforted.My brother and sisters came around me, and said, “Don’t cry,” and gave mepeaches and pears, but I flung them away, and refused all their kindly advances.I had never been deceived before; and I felt not only grieved at parting—as Isupposed forever—with my grandmother, but indignant that a trick had been playedupon me in a matter so serious.It was now late in the afternoon. The day had been an exciting and wearisomeone, and I knew not how or where, but I suppose I sobbed myself to sleep. Thereis a healing in the angel wing of sleep, even for the slave-boy; and its balmwas never more welcome to any wounded soul than it was to mine, the first nightI spent at the domicile of old master. The reader may be surprised that Inarrate so minutely an incident apparently so trivial, and which must haveoccurred when I was not more than seven years old; but as I wish to give afaithful history of my experience in slavery, I cannot withhold a circumstancewhich, at the time, affected me so deeply. Besides, this was, in fact, my firstintroduction to the realities of slavery.CHAPTER III. PARENTAGEMY FATHER SHROUDED IN MYSTERY—MY MOTHER—HER PERSONALAPPEARANCE—INTERFERENCE OF SLAVERY WITH THE NATURAL AFFECTIONS OFMOTHER AND CHILDREN—SITUATION OF MY MOTHER—HER NIGHTLY VISITS TO HERBOY—STRIKING INCIDENT—HER DEATH—HER PLACE OF BURIAL.If the reader will now be kind enough to allow me time to grow bigger, andafford me an opportunity for my experience to become greater, I will tell himsomething, by-and-by, of slave life, as I saw, felt, and heard it, on Col.Edward Lloyd’s plantation, and at the house of old master, where I had now,despite of myself, most suddenly, but not unexpectedly, been dropped. Meanwhile,I will redeem my promise to say something more of my dear mother.I say nothing of father, for he is shrouded in a mystery I have never been ableto penetrate. Slavery does away with fathers, as it does away with families.Slavery has no use for either fathers or families, and its laws do not recognizetheir existence in the social arrangements of the plantation. When they doexist, they are not the outgrowths of slavery, but are antagonistic to thatsystem. The order of civilization is reversed here. The name of the child is notexpected to be that of its father, and his condition does not necessarily affectthat of the child. He may be the slave of Mr. Tilgman; and his child, when born,may be the slave of Mr. Gross. He may be a freeman; and yet his child may be achattel. He may be white, glorying in the purity of his Anglo-Saxon blood; andhis child may be ranked with the blackest slaves. Indeed, he may be, and oftenis, master and father to the same child. He can be father without being ahusband, and may sell his child without incurring reproach, if the child be by awoman in whose veins courses one thirty-second part of African blood. My fatherwas a white man, or nearly white. It was sometimes whispered that my master wasmy father.But to return, or rather, to begin. My knowledge of my mother is very scanty,but very distinct. Her personal appearance and bearing are ineffaceably stampedupon my memory. She was tall, and finely proportioned; of deep black, glossycomplexion; had regular features, and, among the other slaves, was remarkablysedate in her manners. There is in Prichard’s Natural History of Man, the headof a figure—on page 157—the features of which so resemble those of my mother,that I often recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose othersexperience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones.Yet I cannot say that I was very deeply attached to my mother; certainly not sodeeply as I should have been had our relations in childhood been different. Wewere separated, according to the common custom, when I was but an infant, and,of course, before I knew my mother from any one else.The germs of affection with which the Almighty, in his wisdom and mercy, armsthe hopeless infant against the ills and vicissitudes of his lot, had beendirected in their growth toward that loving old grandmother, whose gentle handand kind deportment it was in the first effort of my infantile understanding tocomprehend and appreciate. Accordingly, the tenderest affection which abeneficent Father allows, as a partial compensation to the mother for the painsand lacerations of her heart, incident to the maternal relation, was, in mycase, diverted from its true and natural object, by the envious, greedy, andtreacherous hand of slavery. The slave-mother can be spared long enough from thefield to endure all the bitterness of a mother’s anguish, when it adds anothername to a master’s ledger, but not long enough to receive the joyous rewardafforded by the intelligent smiles of her child. I never think of this terribleinterference of slavery with my infantile affections, and its diverting themfrom their natural course, without feelings to which I can give no adequateexpression.I do not remember to have seen my mother at my grandmother’s at any time. Iremember her only in her visits to me at Col. Lloyd’s plantation, and in thekitchen of my old master. Her visits to me there were few in number, brief induration, and mostly made in the night. The pains she took, and the toil sheendured, to see me, tells me that a true mother’s heart was hers, and thatslavery had difficulty in paralyzing it with unmotherly indifference.My mother was hired out to a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from oldmaster’s, and, being a field hand, she seldom had leisure, by day, for theperformance of the journey. The nights and the distance were both obstacles toher visits. She was obliged to walk, unless chance flung into her way anopportunity to ride; and the latter was sometimes her good luck. But she alwayshad to walk one way or the other. It was a greater luxury than slavery couldafford, to allow a black slave-mother a horse or a mule, upon which to traveltwenty-four miles, when she could walk the distance. Besides, it is deemed afoolish whim for a slave-mother to manifest concern to see her children, and, inone point of view, the case is made out—she can do nothing for them. She has nocontrol over them; the master is even more than the mother, in all matterstouching the fate of her child. Why, then, should she give herself any concern?She has no responsibility. Such is the reasoning, and such the practice. Theiron rule of the plantation, always passionately and violently enforced in thatneighborhood, makes flogging the penalty of failing to be in the field beforesunrise in the morning, unless special permission be given to the absentingslave. “I went to see my child,” is no excuse to the ear or heart of theoverseer.One of the visits of my mother to me, while at Col. Lloyd’s, I remember veryvividly, as affording a bright gleam of a mother’s love, and the earnestness ofa mother’s care.“I had on that day offended “Aunt Katy,” (called “Aunt” by way of respect,) thecook of old master’s establishment. I do not now remember the nature of myoffense in this instance, for my offenses were numerous in that quarter, greatlydepending, however, upon the mood of Aunt Katy, as to their heinousness; but shehad adopted, that day, her favorite mode of punishing me, namely, making me gowithout food all day—that is, from after breakfast. The first hour or two afterdinner, I succeeded pretty well in keeping up my spirits; but though I made anexcellent stand against the foe, and fought bravely during the afternoon, I knewI must be conquered at last, unless I got the accustomed reenforcement of aslice of corn bread, at sundown. Sundown came, but no bread, and, in its stead,their came the threat, with a scowl well suited to its terrible import, that she“meant to starve the life out of me!” Brandishing her knife, she chopped off theheavy slices for the other children, and put the loaf away, muttering, all thewhile, her savage designs upon myself. Against this disappointment, for I wasexpecting that her heart would relent at last, I made an extra effort tomaintain my dignity; but when I saw all the other children around me with merryand satisfied faces, I could stand it no longer. I went out behind the house,and cried like a fine fellow! When tired of this, I returned to the kitchen, satby the fire, and brooded over my hard lot. I was too hungry to sleep. While Isat in the corner, I caught sight of an ear of Indian corn on an upper shelf ofthe kitchen. I watched my chance, and got it, and, shelling off a few grains, Iput it back again. The grains in my hand, I quickly put in some ashes, andcovered them with embers, to roast them. All this I did at the risk of getting abrutual thumping, for Aunt Katy could beat, as well as starve me. My corn wasnot long in roasting, and, with my keen appetite, it did not matter even if thegrains were not exactly done. I eagerly pulled them out, and placed them on mystool, in a clever little pile. Just as I began to help myself to my very drymeal, in came my dear mother. And now, dear reader, a scene occurred which wasaltogether worth beholding, and to me it was instructive as well as interesting.The friendless and hungry boy, in his extremest need—and when he did not dare tolook for succor—found himself in the strong, protecting arms of a mother; amother who was, at the moment (being endowed with high powers of manner as wellas matter) more than a match for all his enemies. I shall never forget theindescribable expression of her countenance, when I told her that I had had nofood since morning; and that Aunt Katy said she “meant to starve the life out ofme.” There was pity in her glance at me, and a fiery indignation at Aunt Katy atthe same time; and, while she took the corn from me, and gave me a large gingercake, in its stead, she read Aunt Katy a lecture which she never forgot. Mymother threatened her with complaining to old master in my behalf; for thelatter, though harsh and cruel himself, at times, did not sanction the meanness,injustice, partiality and oppressions enacted by Aunt Katy in the kitchen. Thatnight I learned the fact, that I was, not only a child, but somebody’s child.The “sweet cake” my mother gave me was in the shape of a heart, with a rich,dark ring glazed upon the edge of it. I was victorious, and well off for themoment; prouder, on my mother’s knee, than a king upon his throne. But mytriumph was short. I dropped off to sleep, and waked in the morning only to findmy mother gone, and myself left at the mercy of the sable virago, dominant in myold master’s kitchen, whose fiery wrath was my constant dread.I do not remember to have seen my mother after this occurrence. Death soon endedthe little communication that had existed between us; and with it, I believe, alife judging from her weary, sad, down-cast countenance and mute demeanor—fullof heartfelt sorrow. I was not allowed to visit her during any part of her longillness; nor did I see her for a long time before she was taken ill and died.The heartless and ghastly form of slavery rises between mother and child, evenat the bed of death. The mother, at the verge of the grave, may not gather herchildren, to impart to them her holy admonitions, and invoke for them her dyingbenediction. The bond-woman lives as a slave, and is left to die as a beast;often with fewer attentions than are paid to a favorite horse. Scenes of sacredtenderness, around the death-bed, never forgotten, and which often arrest thevicious and confirm the virtuous during life, must be looked for among the free,though they sometimes occur among the slaves. It has been a life-long, standinggrief to me, that I knew so little of my mother; and that I was so earlyseparated from her. The counsels of her love must have been beneficial to me.The side view of her face is imaged on my memory, and I take few steps in life,without feeling her presence; but the image is mute, and I have no strikingwords of her’s treasured up.I learned, after my mother’s death, that she could read, and that she was theonly one of all the slaves and colored people in Tuckahoe who enjoyed thatadvantage. How she acquired this knowledge, I know not, for Tuckahoe is the lastplace in the world where she would be apt to find facilities for learning. Ican, therefore, fondly and proudly ascribe to her an earnest love of knowledge.That a “field hand” should learn to read, in any slave state, is remarkable; butthe achievement of my mother, considering the place, was very extraordinary;and, in view of that fact, I am quite willing, and even happy, to attribute anylove of letters I possess, and for which I have got—despite of prejudices onlytoo much credit, not to my admitted Anglo-Saxon paternity, but to the nativegenius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated mother—a woman, who belongedto a race whose mental endowments it is, at present, fashionable to hold indisparagement and contempt.Summoned away to her account, with the impassable gulf of slavery between usduring her entire illness, my mother died without leaving me a single intimationof who my father was. There was a whisper, that my master was my father; yet itwas only a whisper, and I cannot say that I ever gave it credence. Indeed, I nowhave reason to think he was not; nevertheless, the fact remains, in all itsglaring odiousness, that, by the laws of slavery, children, in all cases, arereduced to the condition of their mothers. This arrangement admits of thegreatest license to brutal slaveholders, and their profligate sons, brothers,relations and friends, and gives to the pleasure of sin, the additionalattraction of profit. A whole volume might be written on this single feature ofslavery, as I have observed it.One might imagine, that the children of such connections, would fare better, inthe hands of their masters, than other slaves. The rule is quite the other way;and a very little reflection will satisfy the reader that such is the case. Aman who will enslave his own blood, may not be safely relied on for magnanimity.Men do not love those who remind them of their sins unless they have a mind torepent—and the mulatto child’s face is a standing accusation against him who ismaster and father to the child. What is still worse, perhaps, such a child is aconstant offense to the wife. She hates its very presence, and when aslaveholding woman hates, she wants not means to give that hate telling effect.Women—white women, I mean—are IDOLS at the south, not WIVES, for the slave womenare preferred in many instances; and if these idols but nod, or lift a finger,woe to the poor victim: kicks, cuffs and stripes are sure to follow. Masters arefrequently compelled to sell this class of their slaves, out of deference to thefeelings of their white wives; and shocking and scandalous as it may seem for aman to sell his own blood to the traffickers in human flesh, it is often an actof humanity toward the slave-child to be thus removed from his mercilesstormentors.It is not within the scope of the design of my simple story, to comment uponevery phase of slavery not within my experience as a slave.But, I may remark, that, if the lineal descendants of Ham are only to beenslaved, according to the scriptures, slavery in this country will soon becomean unscriptural institution; for thousands are ushered into the world, annually,who—like myself—owe their existence to white fathers, and, most frequently, totheir masters, and master’s sons. The slave-woman is at the mercy of thefathers, sons or brothers of her master. The thoughtful know the rest.After what I have now said of the circumstances of my mother, and my relationsto her, the reader will not be surprised, nor be disposed to censure me, when Itell but the simple truth, viz: that I received the tidings of her death with nostrong emotions of sorrow for her, and with very little regret for myself onaccount of her loss. I had to learn the value of my mother long after her death,and by witnessing the devotion of other mothers to their children.There is not, beneath the sky, an enemy to filial affection so destructive asslavery. It had made my brothers and sisters strangers to me; it converted themother that bore me, into a myth; it shrouded my father in mystery, and left mewithout an intelligible beginning in the world.My mother died when I could not have been more than eight or nine years old, onone of old master’s farms in Tuckahoe, in the neighborhood of Hillsborough. Hergrave is, as the grave of the dead at sea, unmarked, and without stone or stake.CHAPTER IV. A GENERAL SURVEY OF THE SLAVE PLANTATIONISOLATION OF LLOYD S PLANTATION—PUBLIC OPINION THERE NO PROTECTION TOTHE SLAVE—ABSOLUTE POWER OF THE OVERSEER—NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL CHARMSOF THE PLACE—ITS BUSINESS-LIKE APPEARANCE—SUPERSTITION ABOUT THEBURIAL GROUND—GREAT IDEAS OF COL. LLOYD—ETIQUETTE AMONG SLAVES—THECOMIC SLAVE DOCTOR—PRAYING AND FLOGGING—OLD MASTER LOSING ITSTERRORS—HIS BUSINESS—CHARACTER OF AUNT KATY—SUFFERINGS FROMHUNGER—OLD MASTER’S HOME—JARGON OF THE PLANTATION—GUINEASLAVES—MASTER DANIEL—FAMILY OF COL. LLOYD—FAMILY OF CAPT.ANTHONY—HIS SOCIAL POSITION—NOTIONS OF RANK AND STATION.It is generally supposed that slavery, in the state of Maryland, exists in itsmildest form, and that it is totally divested of those harsh and terriblepeculiarities, which mark and characterize the slave system, in the southern andsouth-western states of the American union. The argument in favor of thisopinion, is the contiguity of the free states, and the exposed condition ofslavery in Maryland to the moral, religious and humane sentiment of the freestates.I am not about to refute this argument, so far as it relates to slavery in thatstate, generally; on the contrary, I am willing to admit that, to this generalpoint, the arguments is well grounded. Public opinion is, indeed, an unfailingrestraint upon the cruelty and barbarity of masters, overseers, andslave-drivers, whenever and wherever it can reach them; but there are certainsecluded and out-of-the-way places, even in the state of Maryland, seldomvisited by a single ray of healthy public sentiment—where slavery, wrapt in itsown congenial, midnight darkness, can, and does, develop all its malign andshocking characteristics; where it can be indecent without shame, cruel withoutshuddering, and murderous without apprehension or fear of exposure.Just such a secluded, dark, and out-of-the-way place, is the “home plantation”of Col. Edward Lloyd, on the Eastern Shore, Maryland. It is far away from allthe great thoroughfares, and is proximate to no town or village. There isneither school-house, nor town-house in its neighborhood. The school-house isunnecessary, for there are no children to go to school. The children andgrand-children of Col. Lloyd were taught in the house, by a private tutor—a Mr.Page a tall, gaunt sapling of a man, who did not speak a dozen words to a slavein a whole year. The overseers’ children go off somewhere to school; and they,therefore, bring no foreign or dangerous influence from abroad, to embarrass thenatural operation of the slave system of the place. Not even themechanics—through whom there is an occasional out-burst of honest and tellingindignation, at cruelty and wrong on other plantations—are white men, on thisplantation. Its whole public is made up of, and divided into, threeclasses—SLAVEHOLDERS, SLAVES and OVERSEERS. Its blacksmiths, wheelwrights,shoemakers, weavers, and coopers, are slaves. Not even commerce, selfish andiron-hearted at it is, and ready, as it ever is, to side with the strong againstthe weak—the rich against the poor—is trusted or permitted within its secludedprecincts. Whether with a view of guarding against the escape of its secrets, Iknow not, but it is a fact, the every leaf and grain of the produce of thisplantation, and those of the neighboring farms belonging to Col. Lloyd, aretransported to Baltimore in Col. Lloyd’s own vessels; every man and boy on boardof which—except the captain—are owned by him. In return, everything brought tothe plantation, comes through the same channel. Thus, even the glimmering andunsteady light of trade, which sometimes exerts a civilizing influence, isexcluded from this “tabooed” spot.Nearly all the plantations or farms in the vicinity of the “home plantation” ofCol. Lloyd, belong to him; and those which do not, are owned by personal friendsof his, as deeply interested in maintaining the slave system, in all its rigor,as Col. Lloyd himself. Some of his neighbors are said to be even more stringentthan he. The Skinners, the Peakers, the Tilgmans, the Lockermans, and theGipsons, are in the same boat; being slaveholding neighbors, they may havestrengthened each other in their iron rule. They are on intimate terms, andtheir interests and tastes are identical.Public opinion in such a quarter, the reader will see, is not likely to veryefficient in protecting the slave from cruelty. On the contrary, it mustincrease and intensify his wrongs. Public opinion seldom differs very widelyfrom public practice. To be a restraint upon cruelty and vice, public opinionmust emanate from a humane and virtuous community. To no such humane andvirtuous community, is Col. Lloyd’s plantation exposed. That plantation is alittle nation of its own, having its own language, its own rules, regulationsand customs. The laws and institutions of the state, apparently touch itnowhere. The troubles arising here, are not settled by the civil power of thestate. The overseer is generally accuser, judge, jury, advocate and executioner.The criminal is always dumb. The overseer attends to all sides of a case.There are no conflicting rights of property, for all the people are owned by oneman; and they can themselves own no property. Religion and politics are alikeexcluded. One class of the population is too high to be reached by the preacher;and the other class is too low to be cared for by the preacher. The poor havethe gospel preached to them, in this neighborhood, only when they are able topay for it. The slaves, having no money, get no gospel. The politician keepsaway, because the people have no votes, and the preacher keeps away, because thepeople have no money. The rich planter can afford to learn politics in theparlor, and to dispense with religion altogether.In its isolation, seclusion, and self-reliant independence, Col. Lloyd’splantation resembles what the baronial domains were during the middle ages inEurope. Grim, cold, and unapproachable by all genial influences from communitieswithout, there it stands; full three hundred years behind the age, in all thatrelates to humanity and morals.This, however, is not the only view that the place presents. Civilization isshut out, but nature cannot be. Though separated from the rest of the world;though public opinion, as I have said, seldom gets a chance to penetrate itsdark domain; though the whole place is stamped with its own peculiar, ironlikeindividuality; and though crimes, high-handed and atrocious, may there becommitted, with almost as much impunity as upon the deck of a pirate ship—it is,nevertheless, altogether, to outward seeming, a most strikingly interestingplace, full of life, activity, and spirit; and presents a very favorablecontrast to the indolent monotony and languor of Tuckahoe. Keen as was my regretand great as was my sorrow at leaving the latter, I was not long in adaptingmyself to this, my new home. A man’s troubles are always half disposed of, whenhe finds endurance his only remedy. I found myself here; there was no gettingaway; and what remained for me, but to make the best of it? Here were plenty ofchildren to play with, and plenty of places of pleasant resort for boys of myage, and boys older. The little tendrils of affection, so rudely andtreacherously broken from around the darling objects of my grandmother’s hut,gradually began to extend, and to entwine about the new objects by which I nowfound myself surrounded.There was a windmill (always a commanding object to a child’s eye) on LongPoint—a tract of land dividing Miles river from the Wye a mile or more from myold master’s house. There was a creek to swim in, at the bottom of an open flatspace, of twenty acres or more, called “the Long Green”—a very beautifulplay-ground for the children.In the river, a short distance from the shore, lying quietly at anchor, with hersmall boat dancing at her stern, was a large sloop—the Sally Lloyd; called bythat name in honor of a favorite daughter of the colonel. The sloop and the millwere wondrous things, full of thoughts and ideas. A child cannot well look atsuch objects without thinking.Then here were a great many houses; human habitations, full of the mysteries oflife at every stage of it. There was the little red house, up the road, occupiedby Mr. Sevier, the overseer. A little nearer to my old master’s, stood a verylong, rough, low building, literally alive with slaves, of all ages, conditionsand sizes. This was called “the Longe Quarter.” Perched upon a hill, across theLong Green, was a very tall, dilapidated, old brick building—the architecturaldimensions of which proclaimed its erection for a different purpose—now occupiedby slaves, in a similar manner to the Long Quarter. Besides these, there werenumerous other slave houses and huts, scattered around in the neighborhood,every nook and corner of which was completely occupied. Old master’s house, along, brick building, plain, but substantial, stood in the center of theplantation life, and constituted one independent establishment on the premisesof Col. Lloyd.Besides these dwellings, there were barns, stables, store-houses, andtobacco-houses; blacksmiths’ shops, wheelwrights’ shops, coopers’ shops—allobjects of interest; but, above all, there stood the grandest building my eyeshad then ever beheld, called, by every one on the plantation, the “Great House.”This was occupied by Col. Lloyd and his family. They occupied it; I enjoyed it.The great house was surrounded by numerous and variously shaped out-buildings.There were kitchens, wash-houses, dairies, summer-house, green-houses,hen-houses, turkey-houses, pigeon-houses, and arbors, of many sizes and devices,all neatly painted, and altogether interspersed with grand old trees, ornamentaland primitive, which afforded delightful shade in summer, and imparted to thescene a high degree of stately beauty. The great house itself was a large,white, wooden building, with wings on three sides of it. In front, a largeportico, extending the entire length of the building, and supported by a longrange of columns, gave to the whole establishment an air of solemn grandeur. Itwas a treat to my young and gradually opening mind, to behold this elaborateexhibition of wealth, power, and vanity. The carriage entrance to the house wasa large gate, more than a quarter of a mile distant from it; the intermediatespace was a beautiful lawn, very neatly trimmed, and watched with the greatestcare. It was dotted thickly over with delightful trees, shrubbery, and flowers.The road, or lane, from the gate to the great house, was richly paved with whitepebbles from the beach, and, in its course, formed a complete circle around thebeautiful lawn. Carriages going in and retiring from the great house, made thecircuit of the lawn, and their passengers were permitted to behold a scene ofalmost Eden-like beauty. Outside this select inclosure, were parks, where asabout the residences of the English nobility—rabbits, deer, and other wild game,might be seen, peering and playing about, with none to molest them or make themafraid. The tops of the stately poplars were often covered with the red-wingedblack-birds, making all nature vocal with the joyous life and beauty of theirwild, warbling notes. These all belonged to me, as well as to Col. Edward Lloyd,and for a time I greatly enjoyed them.A short distance from the great house, were the stately mansions of the dead, aplace of somber aspect. Vast tombs, embowered beneath the weeping willow and thefir tree, told of the antiquities of the Lloyd family, as well as of theirwealth. Superstition was rife among the slaves about this family burying ground.Strange sights had been seen there by some of the older slaves. Shrouded ghosts,riding on great black horses, had been seen to enter; balls of fire had beenseen to fly there at midnight, and horrid sounds had been repeatedly heard.Slaves know enough of the rudiments of theology to believe that those go to hellwho die slaveholders; and they often fancy such persons wishing themselves backagain, to wield the lash. Tales of sights and sounds, strange and terrible,connected with the huge black tombs, were a very great security to the groundsabout them, for few of the slaves felt like approaching them even in the daytime. It was a dark, gloomy and forbidding place, and it was difficult to feelthat the spirits of the sleeping dust there deposited, reigned with the blest inthe realms of eternal peace.The business of twenty or thirty farms was transacted at this, called, by way ofeminence, “great house farm.” These farms all belonged to Col. Lloyd, as did,also, the slaves upon them. Each farm was under the management of an overseer.As I have said of the overseer of the home plantation, so I may say of theoverseers on the smaller ones; they stand between the slave and all civilconstitutions—their word is law, and is implicitly obeyed.The colonel, at this time, was reputed to be, and he apparently was, very rich.His slaves, alone, were an immense fortune. These, small and great, could nothave been fewer than one thousand in number, and though scarcely a month passedwithout the sale of one or more lots to the Georgia traders, there was noapparent diminution in the number of his human stock: the home plantation merelygroaned at a removal of the young increase, or human crop, then proceeded aslively as ever. Horse-shoeing, cart-mending, plow-repairing, coopering,grinding, and weaving, for all the neighboring farms, were performed here, andslaves were employed in all these branches. “Uncle Tony” was the blacksmith;“Uncle Harry” was the cartwright; “Uncle Abel” was the shoemaker; and all thesehad hands to assist them in their several departments.These mechanics were called “uncles” by all the younger slaves, not because theyreally sustained that relationship to any, but according to plantationetiquette, as a mark of respect, due from the younger to the older slaves.Strange, and even ridiculous as it may seem, among a people so uncultivated, andwith so many stern trials to look in the face, there is not to be found, amongany people, a more rigid enforcement of the law of respect to elders, than theymaintain. I set this down as partly constitutional with my race, and partlyconventional. There is no better material in the world for making a gentleman,than is furnished in the African. He shows to others, and exacts for himself,all the tokens of respect which he is compelled to manifest toward his master. Ayoung slave must approach the company of the older with hat in hand, and woebetide him, if he fails to acknowledge a favor, of any sort, with the accustomed“tank’ee,” &c. So uniformly are good manners enforced among slaves, I can easilydetect a “bogus” fugitive by his manners.Among other slave notabilities of the plantation, was one called by everybodyUncle Isaac Copper. It is seldom that a slave gets a surname from anybody inMaryland; and so completely has the south shaped the manners of the north, inthis respect, that even abolitionists make very little of the surname of aNegro. The only improvement on the “Bills,” “Jacks,” “Jims,” and “Neds” of thesouth, observable here is, that “William,” “John,” “James,” “Edward,” aresubstituted. It goes against the grain to treat and address a Negro precisely asthey would treat and address a white man. But, once in a while, in slavery as inthe free states, by some extraordinary circumstance, the Negro has a surnamefastened to him, and holds it against all conventionalities. This was the casewith Uncle Isaac Copper. When the “uncle” was dropped, he generally had theprefix “doctor,” in its stead. He was our doctor of medicine, and doctor ofdivinity as well. Where he took his degree I am unable to say, for he was notvery communicative to inferiors, and I was emphatically such, being but a boyseven or eight years old. He was too well established in his profession topermit questions as to his native skill, or his attainments. One qualificationhe undoubtedly had—he was a confirmed cripple; and he could neither work, norwould he bring anything if offered for sale in the market. The old man, thoughlame, was no sluggard. He was a man that made his crutches do him good service.He was always on the alert, looking up the sick, and all such as were supposedto need his counsel. His remedial prescriptions embraced four articles. Fordiseases of the body, Epsom salts and castor oil; for those of the soul, theLord’s Prayer, and hickory switches!I was not long at Col. Lloyd’s before I was placed under the care of DoctorIssac Copper. I was sent to him with twenty or thirty other children, to learnthe “Lord’s Prayer.” I found the old gentleman seated on a huge three-leggedoaken stool, armed with several large hickory switches; and, from his position,he could reach—lame as he was—any boy in the room. After standing awhile tolearn what was expected of us, the old gentleman, in any other than a devotionaltone, commanded us to kneel down. This done, he commenced telling us to sayeverything he said. “Our Father”—this was repeated after him with promptness anduniformity; “Who art in heaven”—was less promptly and uniformly repeated; andthe old gentleman paused in the prayer, to give us a short lecture upon theconsequences of inattention, both immediate and future, and especially thosemore immediate. About these he was absolutely certain, for he held in his righthand the means of bringing all his predictions and warnings to pass. On heproceeded with the prayer; and we with our thick tongues and unskilled ears,followed him to the best of our ability. This, however, was not sufficient toplease the old gentleman. Everybody, in the south, wants the privilege ofwhipping somebody else. Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his country,and, therefore, seldom found any means of keeping his disciples in order shortof flogging. “Say everything I say;” and bang would come the switch on some poorboy’s undevotional head. “What you looking at there”—“Stop that pushing”—anddown again would come the lash.The whip is all in all. It is supposed to secure obedience to the slaveholder,and is held as a sovereign remedy among the slaves themselves, for every form ofdisobedience, temporal or spiritual. Slaves, as well as slaveholders, use itwith an unsparing hand. Our devotions at Uncle Isaac’s combined too much of thetragic and comic, to make them very salutary in a spiritual point of view; andit is due to truth to say, I was often a truant when the time for attending thepraying and flogging of Doctor Isaac Copper came on.The windmill under the care of Mr. Kinney, a kind hearted old Englishman, was tome a source of infinite interest and pleasure. The old man always seemed pleasedwhen he saw a troop of darkey little urchins, with their tow-linen shirtsfluttering in the breeze, approaching to view and admire the whirling wings ofhis wondrous machine. From the mill we could see other objects of deep interest.These were, the vessels from St. Michael’s, on their way to Baltimore. It was asource of much amusement to view the flowing sails and complicated rigging, asthe little crafts dashed by, and to speculate upon Baltimore, as to the kind andquality of the place. With so many sources of interest around me, the reader maybe prepared to learn that I began to think very highly of Col. L.‘s plantation.It was just a place to my boyish taste. There were fish to be caught in thecreek, if one only had a hook and line; and crabs, clams and oysters were to becaught by wading, digging and raking for them. Here was a field for industry andenterprise, strongly inviting; and the reader may be assured that I entered uponit with spirit.Even the much dreaded old master, whose merciless fiat had brought me fromTuckahoe, gradually, to my mind, parted with his terrors. Strange enough, hisreverence seemed to take no particular notice of me, nor of my coming. Insteadof leaping out and devouring me, he scarcely seemed conscious of my presence.The fact is, he was occupied with matters more weighty and important than eitherlooking after or vexing me. He probably thought as little of my advent, as hewould have thought of the addition of a single pig to his stock!As the chief butler on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, his duties were numerous andperplexing. In almost all important matters he answered in Col. Lloyd’s stead.The overseers of all the farms were in some sort under him, and received the lawfrom his mouth. The colonel himself seldom addressed an overseer, or allowed anoverseer to address him. Old master carried the keys of all store houses;measured out the allowance for each slave at the end of every month;superintended the storing of all goods brought to the plantation; dealt out theraw material to all the handicraftsmen; shipped the grain, tobacco, and allsaleable produce of the plantation to market, and had the general oversight ofthe coopers’ shop, wheelwrights’ shop, blacksmiths’ shop, and shoemakers’ shop.Besides the care of these, he often had business for the plantation whichrequired him to be absent two and three days.Thus largely employed, he had little time, and perhaps as little disposition, tointerfere with the children individually. What he was to Col. Lloyd, he madeAunt Katy to him. When he had anything to say or do about us, it was said ordone in a wholesale manner; disposing of us in classes or sizes, leaving allminor details to Aunt Katy, a person of whom the reader has already received novery favorable impression. Aunt Katy was a woman who never allowed herself toact greatly within the margin of power granted to her, no matter how broad thatauthority might be. Ambitious, ill-tempered and cruel, she found in her presentposition an ample field for the exercise of her ill-omened qualities. She had astrong hold on old master she was considered a first rate cook, and she reallywas very industrious. She was, therefore, greatly favored by old master, and asone mark of his favor, she was the only mother who was permitted to retain herchildren around her. Even to these children she was often fiendish in herbrutality. She pursued her son Phil, one day, in my presence, with a hugebutcher knife, and dealt a blow with its edge which left a shocking gash on hisarm, near the wrist. For this, old master did sharply rebuke her, and threatenedthat if she ever should do the like again, he would take the skin off her back.Cruel, however, as Aunt Katy was to her own children, at times she was notdestitute of maternal feeling, as I often had occasion to know, in the bitterpinches of hunger I had to endure. Differing from the practice of Col. Lloyd,old master, instead of allowing so much for each slave, committed the allowancefor all to the care of Aunt Katy, to be divided after cooking it, amongst us.The allowance, consisting of coarse corn-meal, was not very abundant—indeed, itwas very slender; and in passing through Aunt Katy’s hands, it was made moreslender still, for some of us. William, Phil and Jerry were her children, and itis not to accuse her too severely, to allege that she was often guilty ofstarving myself and the other children, while she was literally cramming herown. Want of food was my chief trouble the first summer at my old master’s.Oysters and clams would do very well, with an occasional supply of bread, butthey soon failed in the absence of bread. I speak but the simple truth, when Isay, I have often been so pinched with hunger, that I have fought with thedog—“Old Nep”—for the smallest crumbs that fell from the kitchen table, and havebeen glad when I won a single crumb in the combat. Many times have I followed,with eager step, the waiting-girl when she went out to shake the table cloth, toget the crumbs and small bones flung out for the cats. The water, in which meathad been boiled, was as eagerly sought for by me. It was a great thing to getthe privilege of dipping a piece of bread in such water; and the skin taken fromrusty bacon, was a positive luxury. Nevertheless, I sometimes got full meals andkind words from sympathizing old slaves, who knew my sufferings, and receivedthe comforting assurance that I should be a man some day. “Never mind,honey—better day comin’,” was even then a solace, a cheering consolation to mein my troubles. Nor were all the kind words I received from slaves. I had afriend in the parlor, as well, and one to whom I shall be glad to do justice,before I have finished this part of my story.I was not long at old master’s, before I learned that his surname was Anthony,and that he was generally called “Captain Anthony”—a title which he probablyacquired by sailing a craft in the Chesapeake Bay. Col. Lloyd’s slaves nevercalled Capt. Anthony “old master,” but always Capt. Anthony; and me they called“Captain Anthony Fred.” There is not, probably, in the whole south, a plantationwhere the English language is more imperfectly spoken than on Col. Lloyd’s. Itis a mixture of Guinea and everything else you please. At the time of which I amnow writing, there were slaves there who had been brought from the coast ofAfrica. They never used the “s” in indication of the possessive case. “Cap’nAnt’ney Tom,” “Lloyd Bill,” “Aunt Rose Harry,” means “Captain Anthony’s Tom,”“Lloyd’s Bill,” &c. “Oo you dem long to?” means, “Whom do you belong to?” “Oodem got any peachy?” means, “Have you got any peaches?” I could scarcelyunderstand them when I first went among them, so broken was their speech; and Iam persuaded that I could not have been dropped anywhere on the globe, where Icould reap less, in the way of knowledge, from my immediate associates, than onthis plantation. Even “MAS’ DANIEL,” by his association with his father’sslaves, had measurably adopted their dialect and their ideas, so far as they hadideas to be adopted. The equality of nature is strongly asserted in childhood,and childhood requires children for associates. Color makes no difference with achild. Are you a child with wants, tastes and pursuits common to children, notput on, but natural? then, were you black as ebony you would be welcome to thechild of alabaster whiteness. The law of compensation holds here, as well aselsewhere. Mas’ Daniel could not associate with ignorance without sharing itsshade; and he could not give his black playmates his company, without givingthem his intelligence, as well. Without knowing this, or caring about it, at thetime, I, for some cause or other, spent much of my time with Mas’ Daniel, inpreference to spending it with most of the other boys.Mas’ Daniel was the youngest son of Col. Lloyd; his older brothers were Edwardand Murray—both grown up, and fine looking men. Edward was especially esteemedby the children, and by me among the rest; not that he ever said anything to usor for us, which could be called especially kind; it was enough for us, that henever looked nor acted scornfully toward us. There were also three sisters, allmarried; one to Edward Winder; a second to Edward Nicholson; a third to Mr.Lownes.The family of old master consisted of two sons, Andrew and Richard; hisdaughter, Lucretia, and her newly married husband, Capt. Auld. This was thehouse family. The kitchen family consisted of Aunt Katy, Aunt Esther, and ten ora dozen children, most of them older than myself. Capt. Anthony was notconsidered a rich slaveholder, but was pretty well off in the world. He ownedabout thirty “head” of slaves, and three farms in Tuckahoe. The most valuablepart of his property was his slaves, of whom he could afford to sell one everyyear. This crop, therefore, brought him seven or eight hundred dollars a year,besides his yearly salary, and other revenue from his farms.The idea of rank and station was rigidly maintained on Col. Lloyd’s plantation.Our family never visited the great house, and the Lloyds never came to our home.Equal non-intercourse was observed between Capt. Anthony’s family and that ofMr. Sevier, the overseer.Such, kind reader, was the community, and such the place, in which my earliestand most lasting impressions of slavery, and of slave-life, were received; ofwhich impressions you will learn more in the coming chapters of this book."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V. GRADUAL INITIATION TO THE MYSTERIES OF SLAVERYGROWING ACQUAINTANCE WITH OLD MASTER—HIS CHARACTER—EVILS OFUNRESTRAINED PASSION—APPARENT TENDERNESS—OLD MASTER A MAN OFTROUBLE—CUSTOM OF MUTTERING TO HIMSELF—NECESSITY OF BEING AWARE OFHIS WORDS—THE SUPPOSED OBTUSENESS OF SLAVE-CHILDREN—BRUTALOUTRAGE—DRUNKEN OVERSEER—SLAVEHOLDER’S IMPATIENCE—WISDOM OF APPEALINGTO SUPERIORS—THE SLAVEHOLDER S WRATH BAD AS THAT OF THE OVERSEER—ABASE AND SELFISH ATTEMPT TO BREAK UP A COURTSHIP—A HARROWING SCENE.Although my old master—Capt. Anthony—gave me at first, (as the reader will havealready seen) very little attention, and although that little was of aremarkably mild and gentle description, a few months only were sufficient toconvince me that mildness and gentleness were not the prevailing or governingtraits of his character. These excellent qualities were displayed onlyoccasionally. He could, when it suited him, appear to be literally insensible tothe claims of humanity, when appealed to by the helpless against an aggressor,and he could himself commit outrages, deep, dark and nameless. Yet he was not bynature worse than other men. Had he been brought up in a free state, surroundedby the just restraints of free society—restraints which are necessary to thefreedom of all its members, alike and equally—Capt. Anthony might have been ashumane a man, and every way as respectable, as many who now oppose the slavesystem; certainly as humane and respectable as are members of society generally.The slaveholder, as well as the slave, is the victim of the slave system. Aman’s character greatly takes its hue and shape from the form and color ofthings about him. Under the whole heavens there is no relation more unfavorableto the development of honorable character, than that sustained by theslaveholder to the slave. Reason is imprisoned here, and passions run wild. Likethe fires of the prairie, once lighted, they are at the mercy of every wind, andmust burn, till they have consumed all that is combustible within theirremorseless grasp. Capt. Anthony could be kind, and, at times, he even showed anaffectionate disposition. Could the reader have seen him gently leading me bythe hand—as he sometimes did—patting me on the head, speaking to me in soft,caressing tones and calling me his “little Indian boy,” he would have deemed hima kind old man, and really, almost fatherly. But the pleasant moods of aslaveholder are remarkably brittle; they are easily snapped; they neither comeoften, nor remain long. His temper is subjected to perpetual trials; but, sincethese trials are never borne patiently, they add nothing to his natural stock ofpatience.Old master very early impressed me with the idea that he was an unhappy man.Even to my child’s eye, he wore a troubled, and at times, a haggard aspect. Hisstrange movements excited my curiosity, and awakened my compassion. He seldomwalked alone without muttering to himself; and he occasionally stormed about, asif defying an army of invisible foes. “He would do this, that, and the other;he’d be d—d if he did not,”—was the usual form of his threats. Most of hisleisure was spent in walking, cursing and gesticulating, like one possessed by ademon. Most evidently, he was a wretched man, at war with his own soul, and withall the world around him. To be overheard by the children, disturbed him verylittle. He made no more of our presence, than of that of the ducks and geesewhich he met on the green. He little thought that the little black urchinsaround him, could see, through those vocal crevices, the very secrets of hisheart. Slaveholders ever underrate the intelligence with which they have tograpple. I really understood the old man’s mutterings, attitudes and gestures,about as well as he did himself. But slaveholders never encourage that kind ofcommunication, with the slaves, by which they might learn to measure the depthsof his knowledge. Ignorance is a high virtue in a human chattel; and as themaster studies to keep the slave ignorant, the slave is cunning enough to makethe master think he succeeds. The slave fully appreciates the saying, “whereignorance is bliss, ‘tis folly to be wise.” When old master’s gestures wereviolent, ending with a threatening shake of the head, and a sharp snap of hismiddle finger and thumb, I deemed it wise to keep at a respectable distance fromhim; for, at such times, trifling faults stood, in his eyes, as momentousoffenses; and, having both the power and the disposition, the victim had only tobe near him to catch the punishment, deserved or undeserved.One of the first circumstances that opened my eyes to the cruelty and wickednessof slavery, and the heartlessness of my old master, was the refusal of thelatter to interpose his authority, to protect and shield a young woman, who hadbeen most cruelly abused and beaten by his overseer in Tuckahoe. This overseer—aMr. Plummer—was a man like most of his class, little better than a human brute;and, in addition to his general profligacy and repulsive coarseness, thecreature was a miserable drunkard. He was, probably, employed by my old master,less on account of the excellence of his services, than for the cheap rate atwhich they could be obtained. He was not fit to have the management of a droveof mules. In a fit of drunken madness, he committed the outrage which broughtthe young woman in question down to my old master’s for protection. This youngwoman was the daughter of Milly, an own aunt of mine. The poor girl, on arrivingat our house, presented a pitiable appearance. She had left in haste, andwithout preparation; and, probably, without the knowledge of Mr. Plummer. Shehad traveled twelve miles, bare-footed, bare-necked and bare-headed. Her neckand shoulders were covered with scars, newly made; and not content with marringher neck and shoulders, with the cowhide, the cowardly brute had dealt her ablow on the head with a hickory club, which cut a horrible gash, and left herface literally covered with blood. In this condition, the poor young woman camedown, to implore protection at the hands of my old master. I expected to see himboil over with rage at the revolting deed, and to hear him fill the air withcurses upon the brutual Plummer; but I was disappointed. He sternly told her, inan angry tone, he “believed she deserved every bit of it,” and, if she did notgo home instantly, he would himself take the remaining skin from her neck andback. Thus was the poor girl compelled to return, without redress, and perhapsto receive an additional flogging for daring to appeal to old master against theoverseer.Old master seemed furious at the thought of being troubled by such complaints. Idid not, at that time, understand the philosophy of his treatment of my cousin.It was stern, unnatural, violent. Had the man no bowels of compassion? Was hedead to all sense of humanity? No. I think I now understand it. This treatmentis a part of the system, rather than a part of the man. Were slaveholders tolisten to complaints of this sort against the overseers, the luxury of owninglarge numbers of slaves, would be impossible. It would do away with the officeof overseer, entirely; or, in other words, it would convert the master himselfinto an overseer. It would occasion great loss of time and labor, leaving theoverseer in fetters, and without the necessary power to secure obedience to hisorders. A privilege so dangerous as that of appeal, is, therefore, strictlyprohibited; and any one exercising it, runs a fearful hazard. Nevertheless, whena slave has nerve enough to exercise it, and boldly approaches his master, witha well-founded complaint against an overseer, though he may be repulsed, and mayeven have that of which he complains repeated at the time, and, though he may bebeaten by his master, as well as by the overseer, for his temerity, in the endthe policy of complaining is, generally, vindicated by the relaxed rigor of theoverseer’s treatment. The latter becomes more careful, and less disposed to usethe lash upon such slaves thereafter. It is with this final result in view,rather than with any expectation of immediate good, that the outraged slave isinduced to meet his master with a complaint. The overseer very naturallydislikes to have the ear of the master disturbed by complaints; and, either uponthis consideration, or upon advice and warning privately given him by hisemployers, he generally modifies the rigor of his rule, after an outbreak of thekind to which I have been referring.Howsoever the slaveholder may allow himself to act toward his slave, and,whatever cruelty he may deem it wise, for example’s sake, or for thegratification of his humor, to inflict, he cannot, in the absence of allprovocation, look with pleasure upon the bleeding wounds of a defenselessslave-woman. When he drives her from his presence without redress, or the hopeof redress, he acts, generally, from motives of policy, rather than from ahardened nature, or from innate brutality. Yet, let but his own temper bestirred, his own passions get loose, and the slave-owner will go far beyond theoverseer in cruelty. He will convince the slave that his wrath is far moreterrible and boundless, and vastly more to be dreaded, than that of theunderling overseer. What may have been mechanically and heartlessly done by theoverseer, is now done with a will. The man who now wields the lash isirresponsible. He may, if he pleases, cripple or kill, without fear ofconsequences; except in so far as it may concern profit or loss. To a man ofviolent temper—as my old master was—this was but a very slender and inefficientrestraint. I have seen him in a tempest of passion, such as I have justdescribed—a passion into which entered all the bitter ingredients of pride,hatred, envy, jealousy, and the thrist(sic) for revenge.The circumstances which I am about to narrate, and which gave rise to thisfearful tempest of passion, are not singular nor isolated in slave life, but arecommon in every slaveholding community in which I have lived. They areincidental to the relation of master and slave, and exist in all sections ofslave-holding countries.The reader will have noticed that, in enumerating the names of the slaves wholived with my old master, Esther is mentioned. This was a young woman whopossessed that which is ever a curse to the slave-girl; namely—personal beauty.She was tall, well formed, and made a fine appearance. The daughters of Col.Lloyd could scarcely surpass her in personal charms. Esther was courted by NedRoberts, and he was as fine looking a young man, as she was a woman. He was theson of a favorite slave of Col. Lloyd. Some slaveholders would have been glad topromote the marriage of two such persons; but, for some reason or other, my oldmaster took it upon him to break up the growing intimacy between Esther andEdward. He strictly ordered her to quit the company of said Roberts, telling herthat he would punish her severely if he ever found her again in Edward’scompany. This unnatural and heartless order was, of course, broken. A woman’slove is not to be annihilated by the peremptory command of any one, whose breathis in his nostrils. It was impossible to keep Edward and Esther apart. Meet theywould, and meet they did. Had old master been a man of honor and purity, hismotives, in this matter, might have been viewed more favorably. As it was, hismotives were as abhorrent, as his methods were foolish and contemptible. It wastoo evident that he was not concerned for the girl’s welfare. It is one of thedamning characteristics of the slave system, that it robs its victims of everyearthly incentive to a holy life. The fear of God, and the hope of heaven, arefound sufficient to sustain many slave-women, amidst the snares and dangers oftheir strange lot; but, this side of God and heaven, a slave-woman is at themercy of the power, caprice and passion of her owner. Slavery provides no meansfor the honorable continuance of the race. Marriage as imposing obligations onthe parties to it—has no existence here, except in such hearts as are purer andhigher than the standard morality around them. It is one of the consolations ofmy life, that I know of many honorable instances of persons who maintained theirhonor, where all around was corrupt.Esther was evidently much attached to Edward, and abhorred—as she had reason todo—the tyrannical and base behavior of old master. Edward was young, and finelooking, and he loved and courted her. He might have been her husband, in thehigh sense just alluded to; but WHO and what was this old master? His attentionswere plainly brutal and selfish, and it was as natural that Esther should loathehim, as that she should love Edward. Abhorred and circumvented as he was, oldmaster, having the power, very easily took revenge. I happened to see thisexhibition of his rage and cruelty toward Esther. The time selected wassingular. It was early in the morning, when all besides was still, and beforeany of the family, in the house or kitchen, had left their beds. I saw but fewof the shocking preliminaries, for the cruel work had begun before I awoke. Iwas probably awakened by the shrieks and piteous cries of poor Esther. Mysleeping place was on the floor of a little, rough closet, which opened into thekitchen; and through the cracks of its unplaned boards, I could distinctly seeand hear what was going on, without being seen by old master. Esther’s wristswere firmly tied, and the twisted rope was fastened to a strong staple in aheavy wooden joist above, near the fireplace. Here she stood, on a bench, herarms tightly drawn over her breast. Her back and shoulders were bare to thewaist. Behind her stood old master, with cowskin in hand, preparing hisbarbarous work with all manner of harsh, coarse, and tantalizing epithets. Thescreams of his victim were most piercing. He was cruelly deliberate, andprotracted the torture, as one who was delighted with the scene. Again and againhe drew the hateful whip through his hand, adjusting it with a view of dealingthe most pain-giving blow. Poor Esther had never yet been severely whipped, andher shoulders were plump and tender. Each blow, vigorously laid on, broughtscreams as well as blood. “Have mercy; Oh! have mercy” she cried; “I won’t do sono more;” but her piercing cries seemed only to increase his fury. His answersto them are too coarse and blasphemous to be produced here. The whole scene,with all its attendants, was revolting and shocking, to the last degree; andwhen the motives of this brutal castigation are considered,—language has nopower to convey a just sense of its awful criminality. After laying on somethirty or forty stripes, old master untied his suffering victim, and let her getdown. She could scarcely stand, when untied. From my heart I pitied her,and—child though I was—the outrage kindled in me a feeling far from peaceful;but I was hushed, terrified, stunned, and could do nothing, and the fate ofEsther might be mine next. The scene here described was often repeated in thecase of poor Esther, and her life, as I knew it, was one of wretchedness.CHAPTER VI. TREATMENT OF SLAVES ON LLOYD’S PLANTATIONEARLY REFLECTIONS ON SLAVERY—PRESENTIMENT OF ONE DAY BEING AFREEMAN—COMBAT BETWEEN AN OVERSEER AND A SLAVEWOMAN—THE ADVANTAGESOF RESISTANCE—ALLOWANCE DAY ON THE HOME PLANTATION—THE SINGINGOF SLAVES—AN EXPLANATION—THE SLAVES FOOD AND CLOTHING—NAKEDCHILDREN—LIFE IN THE QUARTER—DEPRIVATION OF SLEEP—NURSING CHILDRENCARRIED TO THE FIELD—DESCRIPTION OF THE COWSKIN—THE ASH-CAKE—MANNEROF MAKING IT—THE DINNER HOUR—THE CONTRAST.The heart-rending incidents, related in the foregoing chapter, led me, thusearly, to inquire into the nature and history of slavery. Why am I a slave? Whyare some people slaves, and others masters? Was there ever a time this was notso? How did the relation commence? These were the perplexing questions whichbegan now to claim my thoughts, and to exercise the weak powers of my mind, forI was still but a child, and knew less than children of the same age in the freestates. As my questions concerning these things were only put to children alittle older, and little better informed than myself, I was not rapid inreaching a solid footing. By some means I learned from these inquiries that“God, up in the sky,” made every body; and that he made white people to bemasters and mistresses, and black people to be slaves. This did not satisfy me,nor lessen my interest in the subject. I was told, too, that God was good, andthat He knew what was best for me, and best for everybody. This was lesssatisfactory than the first statement; because it came, point blank, against allmy notions of goodness. It was not good to let old master cut the flesh offEsther, and make her cry so. Besides, how did people know that God made blackpeople to be slaves? Did they go up in the sky and learn it? or, did He comedown and tell them so? All was dark here. It was some relief to my hard notionsof the goodness of God, that, although he made white men to be slaveholders, hedid not make them to be bad slaveholders, and that, in due time, he would punishthe bad slaveholders; that he would, when they died, send them to the bad place,where they would be “burnt up.” Nevertheless, I could not reconcile the relationof slavery with my crude notions of goodness.Then, too, I found that there were puzzling exceptions to this theory of slaveryon both sides, and in the middle. I knew of blacks who were not slaves; I knewof whites who were not slaveholders; and I knew of persons who were nearlywhite, who were slaves. Color, therefore, was a very unsatisfactory basis forslavery.Once, however, engaged in the inquiry, I was not very long in finding out thetrue solution of the matter. It was not color, but crime, not God, but man, thatafforded the true explanation of the existence of slavery; nor was I long infinding out another important truth, viz: what man can make, man can unmake. Theappalling darkness faded away, and I was master of the subject. There wereslaves here, direct from Guinea; and there were many who could say that theirfathers and mothers were stolen from Africa—forced from their homes, andcompelled to serve as slaves. This, to me, was knowledge; but it was a kind ofknowledge which filled me with a burning hatred of slavery, increased mysuffering, and left me without the means of breaking away from my bondage. Yetit was knowledge quite worth possessing. I could not have been more than sevenor eight years old, when I began to make this subject my study. It was with mein the woods and fields; along the shore of the river, and wherever my boyishwanderings led me; and though I was, at that time, quite ignorant of theexistence of the free states, I distinctly remember being, even then, moststrongly impressed with the idea of being a freeman some day. This cheeringassurance was an inborn dream of my human nature a constant menace toslavery—and one which all the powers of slavery were unable to silence orextinguish.Up to the time of the brutal flogging of my Aunt Esther—for she was my ownaunt—and the horrid plight in which I had seen my cousin from Tuckahoe, who hadbeen so badly beaten by the cruel Mr. Plummer, my attention had not been called,especially, to the gross features of slavery. I had, of course, heard ofwhippings and of savage rencontres between overseers and slaves, but I hadalways been out of the way at the times and places of their occurrence. My playsand sports, most of the time, took me from the corn and tobacco fields, wherethe great body of the hands were at work, and where scenes of cruelty wereenacted and witnessed. But, after the whipping of Aunt Esther, I saw many casesof the same shocking nature, not only in my master’s house, but on Col. Lloyd’splantation. One of the first which I saw, and which greatly agitated me, was thewhipping of a woman belonging to Col. Lloyd, named Nelly. The offense allegedagainst Nelly, was one of the commonest and most indefinite in the wholecatalogue of offenses usually laid to the charge of slaves, viz: “impudence.”This may mean almost anything, or nothing at all, just according to the capriceof the master or overseer, at the moment. But, whatever it is, or is not, if itgets the name of “impudence,” the party charged with it is sure of a flogging.This offense may be committed in various ways; in the tone of an answer; inanswering at all; in not answering; in the expression of countenance; in themotion of the head; in the gait, manner and bearing of the slave. In the caseunder consideration, I can easily believe that, according to all slaveholdingstandards, here was a genuine instance of impudence. In Nelly there were all thenecessary conditions for committing the offense. She was a bright mulatto, therecognized wife of a favorite “hand” on board Col. Lloyd’s sloop, and the motherof five sprightly children. She was a vigorous and spirited woman, and one ofthe most likely, on the plantation, to be guilty of impudence. My attention wascalled to the scene, by the noise, curses and screams that proceeded from it;and, on going a little in that direction, I came upon the parties engaged in theskirmish. Mr. Siever, the overseer, had hold of Nelly, when I caught sight ofthem; he was endeavoring to drag her toward a tree, which endeavor Nelly wassternly resisting; but to no purpose, except to retard the progress of theoverseer’s plans. Nelly—as I have said—was the mother of five children; three ofthem were present, and though quite small (from seven to ten years old, I shouldthink) they gallantly came to their mother’s defense, and gave the overseer anexcellent pelting with stones. One of the little fellows ran up, seized theoverseer by the leg and bit him; but the monster was too busily engaged withNelly, to pay any attention to the assaults of the children. There were numerousbloody marks on Mr. Sevier’s face, when I first saw him, and they increased asthe struggle went on. The imprints of Nelly’s fingers were visible, and I wasglad to see them. Amidst the wild screams of the children—“Let my mammy go”—“letmy mammy go”—there escaped, from between the teeth of the bullet-headedoverseer, a few bitter curses, mingled with threats, that “he would teach thed—d b—h how to give a white man impudence.” There is no doubt that Nelly feltherself superior, in some respects, to the slaves around her. She was a wife anda mother; her husband was a valued and favorite slave. Besides, he was one ofthe first hands on board of the sloop, and the sloop hands—since they had torepresent the plantation abroad—were generally treated tenderly. The overseernever was allowed to whip Harry; why then should he be allowed to whip Harry’swife? Thoughts of this kind, no doubt, influenced her; but, for whatever reason,she nobly resisted, and, unlike most of the slaves, seemed determined to makeher whipping cost Mr. Sevier as much as possible. The blood on his (and her)face, attested her skill, as well as her courage and dexterity in using hernails. Maddened by her resistance, I expected to see Mr. Sevier level her to theground by a stunning blow; but no; like a savage bull-dog—which he resembledboth in temper and appearance—he maintained his grip, and steadily dragged hisvictim toward the tree, disregarding alike her blows, and the cries of thechildren for their mother’s release. He would, doubtless, have knocked her downwith his hickory stick, but that such act might have cost him his place. It isoften deemed advisable to knock a man slave down, in order to tie him, but it isconsidered cowardly and inexcusable, in an overseer, thus to deal with a woman.He is expected to tie her up, and to give her what is called, in southernparlance, a “genteel flogging,” without any very great outlay of strength orskill. I watched, with palpitating interest, the course of the preliminarystruggle, and was saddened by every new advantage gained over her by theruffian. There were times when she seemed likely to get the better of the brute,but he finally overpowered her, and succeeded in getting his rope around herarms, and in firmly tying her to the tree, at which he had been aiming. Thisdone, and Nelly was at the mercy of his merciless lash; and now, what followed,I have no heart to describe. The cowardly creature made good his every threat;and wielded the lash with all the hot zest of furious revenge. The cries of thewoman, while undergoing the terrible infliction, were mingled with those of thechildren, sounds which I hope the reader may never be called upon to hear. WhenNelly was untied, her back was covered with blood. The red stripes were all overher shoulders. She was whipped—severely whipped; but she was not subdued, forshe continued to denounce the overseer, and to call him every vile name. He hadbruised her flesh, but had left her invincible spirit undaunted. Such floggingsare seldom repeated by the same overseer. They prefer to whip those who are mosteasily whipped. The old doctrine that submission is the very best cure foroutrage and wrong, does not hold good on the slave plantation. He is whippedoftenest, who is whipped easiest; and that slave who has the courage to stand upfor himself against the overseer, although he may have many hard stripes at thefirst, becomes, in the end, a freeman, even though he sustain the formalrelation of a slave. “You can shoot me but you can’t whip me,” said a slave toRigby Hopkins; and the result was that he was neither whipped nor shot. If thelatter had been his fate, it would have been less deplorable than the living andlingering death to which cowardly and slavish souls are subjected. I do not knowthat Mr. Sevier ever undertook to whip Nelly again. He probably never did, forit was not long after his attempt to subdue her, that he was taken sick, anddied. The wretched man died as he had lived, unrepentant; and it was said—withhow much truth I know not—that in the very last hours of his life, his rulingpassion showed itself, and that when wrestling with death, he was utteringhorrid oaths, and flourishing the cowskin, as though he was tearing the fleshoff some helpless slave. One thing is certain, that when he was in health, itwas enough to chill the blood, and to stiffen the hair of an ordinary man, tohear Mr. Sevier talk. Nature, or his cruel habits, had given to his face anexpression of unusual savageness, even for a slave-driver. Tobacco and rage hadworn his teeth short, and nearly every sentence that escaped their compressedgrating, was commenced or concluded with some outburst of profanity. Hispresence made the field alike the field of blood, and of blasphemy. Hated forhis cruelty, despised for his cowardice, his death was deplored by no oneoutside his own house—if indeed it was deplored there; it was regarded by theslaves as a merciful interposition of Providence. Never went there a man to thegrave loaded with heavier curses. Mr. Sevier’s place was promptly taken by a Mr.Hopkins, and the change was quite a relief, he being a very different man. Hewas, in all respects, a better man than his predecessor; as good as any man canbe, and yet be an overseer. His course was characterized by no extraordinarycruelty; and when he whipped a slave, as he sometimes did, he seemed to take noespecial pleasure in it, but, on the contrary, acted as though he felt it to bea mean business. Mr. Hopkins stayed but a short time; his place much to theregret of the slaves generally—was taken by a Mr. Gore, of whom more will besaid hereafter. It is enough, for the present, to say, that he was noimprovement on Mr. Sevier, except that he was less noisy and less profane.I have already referred to the business-like aspect of Col. Lloyd’s plantation.This business-like appearance was much increased on the two days at the end ofeach month, when the slaves from the different farms came to get their monthlyallowance of meal and meat. These were gala days for the slaves, and there wasmuch rivalry among them as to who should be elected to go up to the great housefarm for the allowance, and, indeed, to attend to any business at this (forthem) the capital. The beauty and grandeur of the place, its numerous slavepopulation, and the fact that Harry, Peter and Jake the sailors of thesloop—almost always kept, privately, little trinkets which they bought atBaltimore, to sell, made it a privilege to come to the great house farm. Beingselected, too, for this office, was deemed a high honor. It was taken as a proofof confidence and favor; but, probably, the chief motive of the competitors forthe place, was, a desire to break the dull monotony of the field, and to getbeyond the overseer’s eye and lash. Once on the road with an ox team, and seatedon the tongue of his cart, with no overseer to look after him, the slave wascomparatively free; and, if thoughtful, he had time to think. Slaves aregenerally expected to sing as well as to work. A silent slave is not liked bymasters or overseers. “Make a noise,” “make a noise,” and “bear a hand,” are thewords usually addressed to the slaves when there is silence amongst them. Thismay account for the almost constant singing heard in the southern states. Therewas, generally, more or less singing among the teamsters, as it was one means ofletting the overseer know where they were, and that they were moving on with thework. But, on allowance day, those who visited the great house farm werepeculiarly excited and noisy. While on their way, they would make the dense oldwoods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild notes. These were notalways merry because they were wild. On the contrary, they were mostly of aplaintive cast, and told a tale of grief and sorrow. In the most boisterousoutbursts of rapturous sentiment, there was ever a tinge of deep melancholy. Ihave never heard any songs like those anywhere since I left slavery, except whenin Ireland. There I heard the same wailing notes, and was much affected by them.It was during the famine of 1845-6. In all the songs of the slaves, there wasever some expression in praise of the great house farm; something which wouldflatter the pride of the owner, and, possibly, draw a favorable glance from him. I am going away to the great house farm, O yea! O yea! O yea! My old master is a good old master, O yea! O yea! O yea!This they would sing, with other words of their own improvising—jargon toothers, but full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought, that themere hearing of those songs would do more to impress truly spiritual-minded menand women with the soul-crushing and death-dealing character of slavery, thanthe reading of whole volumes of its mere physical cruelties. They speak to theheart and to the soul of the thoughtful. I cannot better express my sense ofthem now, than ten years ago, when, in sketching my life, I thus spoke of thisfeature of my plantation experience:I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meanings of those rude, andapparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle, so that I neithersaw or heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale which wasthen altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones, loud, long anddeep, breathing the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with thebitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer toGod for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes alwaysdepressed my spirits, and filled my heart with ineffable sadness. The mererecurrence, even now, afflicts my spirit, and while I am writing these lines, mytears are falling. To those songs I trace my first glimmering conceptions of thedehumanizing character of slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Thosesongs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathiesfor my brethren in bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with a sense of thesoul-killing power of slavery, let him go to Col. Lloyd’s plantation, and, onallowance day, place himself in the deep, pine woods, and there let him, insilence, thoughtfully analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers ofhis soul, and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because “there is noflesh in his obdurate heart.”The remark is not unfrequently made, that slaves are the most contended andhappy laborers in the world. They dance and sing, and make all manner of joyfulnoises—so they do; but it is a great mistake to suppose them happy because theysing. The songs of the slave represent the sorrows, rather than the joys, of hisheart; and he is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved by itstears. Such is the constitution of the human mind, that, when pressed toextremes, it often avails itself of the most opposite methods. Extremes meet inmind as in matter. When the slaves on board of the “Pearl” were overtaken,arrested, and carried to prison—their hopes for freedom blasted—as they marchedin chains they sang, and found (as Emily Edmunson tells us) a melancholy reliefin singing. The singing of a man cast away on a desolate island, might be asappropriately considered an evidence of his contentment and happiness, as thesinging of a slave. Sorrow and desolation have their songs, as well as joy andpeace. Slaves sing more to make themselves happy, than to express theirhappiness.It is the boast of slaveholders, that their slaves enjoy more of the physicalcomforts of life than the peasantry of any country in the world. My experiencecontradicts this. The men and the women slaves on Col. Lloyd’s farm, received,as their monthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pickled pork, or theirequivalent in fish. The pork was often tainted, and the fish was of the poorestquality—herrings, which would bring very little if offered for sale in anynorthern market. With their pork or fish, they had one bushel of Indianmeal—unbolted—of which quite fifteen per cent was fit only to feed pigs. Withthis, one pint of salt was given; and this was the entire monthly allowance of afull grown slave, working constantly in the open field, from morning untilnight, every day in the month except Sunday, and living on a fraction more thana quarter of a pound of meat per day, and less than a peck of corn-meal perweek. There is no kind of work that a man can do which requires a better supplyof food to prevent physical exhaustion, than the field-work of a slave. So muchfor the slave’s allowance of food; now for his raiment. The yearly allowance ofclothing for the slaves on this plantation, consisted of two tow-linenshirts—such linen as the coarsest crash towels are made of; one pair of trowsersof the same material, for summer, and a pair of trowsers and a jacket of woolen,most slazily put together, for winter; one pair of yarn stockings, and one pairof shoes of the coarsest description. The slave’s entire apparel could not havecost more than eight dollars per year. The allowance of food and clothing forthe little children, was committed to their mothers, or to the older slavewomenhaving the care of them. Children who were unable to work in the field, hadneither shoes, stockings, jackets nor trowsers given them. Their clothingconsisted of two coarse tow-linen shirts—already described—per year; and whenthese failed them, as they often did, they went naked until the next allowanceday. Flocks of little children from five to ten years old, might be seen on Col.Lloyd’s plantation, as destitute of clothing as any little heathen on the westcoast of Africa; and this, not merely during the summer months, but during thefrosty weather of March. The little girls were no better off than the boys; allwere nearly in a state of nudity.As to beds to sleep on, they were known to none of the field hands; nothing buta coarse blanket—not so good as those used in the north to cover horses—wasgiven them, and this only to the men and women. The children stuck themselves inholes and corners, about the quarters; often in the corner of the huge chimneys,with their feet in the ashes to keep them warm. The want of beds, however, wasnot considered a very great privation. Time to sleep was of far greaterimportance, for, when the day’s work is done, most of the slaves have theirwashing, mending and cooking to do; and, having few or none of the ordinaryfacilities for doing such things, very many of their sleeping hours are consumedin necessary preparations for the duties of the coming day.The sleeping apartments—if they may be called such—have little regard to comfortor decency. Old and young, male and female, married and single, drop down uponthe common clay floor, each covering up with his or her blanket,—the onlyprotection they have from cold or exposure. The night, however, is shortened atboth ends. The slaves work often as long as they can see, and are late incooking and mending for the coming day; and, at the first gray streak ofmorning, they are summoned to the field by the driver’s horn.More slaves are whipped for oversleeping than for any other fault. Neither agenor sex finds any favor. The overseer stands at the quarter door, armed withstick and cowskin, ready to whip any who may be a few minutes behind time. Whenthe horn is blown, there is a rush for the door, and the hindermost one is sureto get a blow from the overseer. Young mothers who worked in the field, wereallowed an hour, about ten o’clock in the morning, to go home to nurse theirchildren. Sometimes they were compelled to take their children with them, and toleave them in the corner of the fences, to prevent loss of time in nursing them.The overseer generally rides about the field on horseback. A cowskin and ahickory stick are his constant companions. The cowskin is a kind of whip seldomseen in the northern states. It is made entirely of untanned, but dried, oxhide, and is about as hard as a piece of well-seasoned live oak. It is made ofvarious sizes, but the usual length is about three feet. The part held in thehand is nearly an inch in thickness; and, from the extreme end of the butt orhandle, the cowskin tapers its whole length to a point. This makes it quiteelastic and springy. A blow with it, on the hardest back, will gash the flesh,and make the blood start. Cowskins are painted red, blue and green, and are thefavorite slave whip. I think this whip worse than the “cat-o’nine-tails.” Itcondenses the whole strength of the arm to a single point, and comes with aspring that makes the air whistle. It is a terrible instrument, and is so handy,that the overseer can always have it on his person, and ready for use. Thetemptation to use it is ever strong; and an overseer can, if disposed, alwayshave cause for using it. With him, it is literally a word and a blow, and, inmost cases, the blow comes first.As a general rule, slaves do not come to the quarters for either breakfast ordinner, but take their “ash cake” with them, and eat it in the field. This wasso on the home plantation; probably, because the distance from the quarter tothe field, was sometimes two, and even three miles.The dinner of the slaves consisted of a huge piece of ash cake, and a smallpiece of pork, or two salt herrings. Not having ovens, nor any suitable cookingutensils, the slaves mixed their meal with a little water, to such thicknessthat a spoon would stand erect in it; and, after the wood had burned away tocoals and ashes, they would place the dough between oak leaves and lay itcarefully in the ashes, completely covering it; hence, the bread is called ashcake. The surface of this peculiar bread is covered with ashes, to the depth ofa sixteenth part of an inch, and the ashes, certainly, do not make it verygrateful to the teeth, nor render it very palatable. The bran, or coarse part ofthe meal, is baked with the fine, and bright scales run through the bread. Thisbread, with its ashes and bran, would disgust and choke a northern man, but itis quite liked by the slaves. They eat it with avidity, and are more concernedabout the quantity than about the quality. They are far too scantily providedfor, and are worked too steadily, to be much concerned for the quality of theirfood. The few minutes allowed them at dinner time, after partaking of theircoarse repast, are variously spent. Some lie down on the “turning row,” and goto sleep; others draw together, and talk; and others are at work with needle andthread, mending their tattered garments. Sometimes you may hear a wild, hoarselaugh arise from a circle, and often a song. Soon, however, the overseer comesdashing through the field. “Tumble up! Tumble up, and to work, work,” is thecry; and, now, from twelve o’clock (mid-day) till dark, the human cattle are inmotion, wielding their clumsy hoes; hurried on by no hope of reward, no sense ofgratitude, no love of children, no prospect of bettering their condition;nothing, save the dread and terror of the slave-driver’s lash. So goes one day,and so comes and goes another.But, let us now leave the rough usage of the field, where vulgar coarseness andbrutal cruelty spread themselves and flourish, rank as weeds in the tropics;where a vile wretch, in the shape of a man, rides, walks, or struts about,dealing blows, and leaving gashes on broken-spirited men and helpless women, forthirty dollars per month—a business so horrible, hardening and disgraceful,that, rather, than engage in it, a decent man would blow his own brains out—andlet the reader view with me the equally wicked, but less repulsive aspects ofslave life; where pride and pomp roll luxuriously at ease; where the toil of athousand men supports a single family in easy idleness and sin. This is thegreat house; it is the home of the LLOYDS! Some idea of its splendor has alreadybeen given—and, it is here that we shall find that height of luxury which is theopposite of that depth of poverty and physical wretchedness that we have justnow been contemplating. But, there is this difference in the two extremes; viz:that in the case of the slave, the miseries and hardships of his lot are imposedby others, and, in the master’s case, they are imposed by himself. The slave isa subject, subjected by others; the slaveholder is a subject, but he is theauthor of his own subjection. There is more truth in the saying, that slavery isa greater evil to the master than to the slave, than many, who utter it,suppose. The self-executing laws of eternal justice follow close on the heels ofthe evil-doer here, as well as elsewhere; making escape from all its penaltiesimpossible. But, let others philosophize; it is my province here to relate anddescribe; only allowing myself a word or two, occasionally, to assist the readerin the proper understanding of the facts narrated.CHAPTER VII. LIFE IN THE GREAT HOUSECOMFORTS AND LUXURIES—ELABORATE EXPENDITURE—HOUSE SERVANTS—MENSERVANTS AND MAID SERVANTS—APPEARANCES—SLAVE ARISTOCRACY—STABLE ANDCARRIAGE HOUSE—BOUNDLESS HOSPITALITY—FRAGRANCE OF RICH DISHES—THEDECEPTIVE CHARACTER OF SLAVERY—SLAVES SEEM HAPPY—SLAVESAND SLAVEHOLDERS ALIKE WRETCHED—FRETFUL DISCONTENTOF SLAVEHOLDERS—FAULT-FINDING—OLD BARNEY—HISPROFESSION—WHIPPING—HUMILIATING SPECTACLE—CASE EXCEPTIONAL—WILLIAMWILKS—SUPPOSED SON OF COL. LLOYD—CURIOUS INCIDENT—SLAVES PREFER RICHMASTERS TO POOR ONES.The close-fisted stinginess that fed the poor slave on coarse corn-meal andtainted meat; that clothed him in crashy tow-linen, and hurried him to toilthrough the field, in all weathers, with wind and rain beating through histattered garments; that scarcely gave even the young slave-mother time to nurseher hungry infant in the fence corner; wholly vanishes on approaching the sacredprecincts of the great house, the home of the Lloyds. There the scripturalphrase finds an exact illustration; the highly favored inmates of this mansionare literally arrayed “in purple and fine linen,” and fare sumptuously everyday! The table groans under the heavy and blood-bought luxuries gathered withpainstaking care, at home and abroad. Fields, forests, rivers and seas, are madetributary here. Immense wealth, and its lavish expenditure, fill the great housewith all that can please the eye, or tempt the taste. Here, appetite, not food,is the great desideratum. Fish, flesh and fowl, are here in profusion. Chickens,of all breeds; ducks, of all kinds, wild and tame, the common, and the hugeMuscovite; Guinea fowls, turkeys, geese, and pea fowls, are in their severalpens, fat and fatting for the destined vortex. The graceful swan, the mongrels,the black-necked wild goose; partridges, quails, pheasants and pigeons; choicewater fowl, with all their strange varieties, are caught in this huge familynet. Beef, veal, mutton and venison, of the most select kinds and quality, rollbounteously to this grand consumer. The teeming riches of the Chesapeake bay,its rock, perch, drums, crocus, trout, oysters, crabs, and terrapin, are drawnhither to adorn the glittering table of the great house. The dairy, too,probably the finest on the Eastern Shore of Maryland—supplied by cattle of thebest English stock, imported for the purpose, pours its rich donations offragant cheese, golden butter, and delicious cream, to heighten the attractionof the gorgeous, unending round of feasting. Nor are the fruits of the earthforgotten or neglected. The fertile garden, many acres in size, constituting aseparate establishment, distinct from the common farm—with its scientificgardener, imported from Scotland (a Mr. McDermott) with four men under hisdirection, was not behind, either in the abundance or in the delicacy of itscontributions to the same full board. The tender asparagus, the succulentcelery, and the delicate cauliflower; egg plants, beets, lettuce, parsnips,peas, and French beans, early and late; radishes, cantelopes, melons of allkinds; the fruits and flowers of all climes and of all descriptions, from thehardy apple of the north, to the lemon and orange of the south, culminated atthis point. Baltimore gathered figs, raisins, almonds and juicy grapes fromSpain. Wines and brandies from France; teas of various flavor, from China; andrich, aromatic coffee from Java, all conspired to swell the tide of high life,where pride and indolence rolled and lounged in magnificence and satiety.Behind the tall-backed and elaborately wrought chairs, stand the servants, menand maidens—fifteen in number—discriminately selected, not only with a view totheir industry and faithfulness, but with special regard to their personalappearance, their graceful agility and captivating address. Some of these arearmed with fans, and are fanning reviving breezes toward the over-heated browsof the alabaster ladies; others watch with eager eye, and with fawn-like stepanticipate and supply wants before they are sufficiently formed to be announcedby word or sign.These servants constituted a sort of black aristocracy on Col. Lloyd’splantation. They resembled the field hands in nothing, except in color, and inthis they held the advantage of a velvet-like glossiness, rich and beautiful.The hair, too, showed the same advantage. The delicate colored maid rustled inthe scarcely worn silk of her young mistress, while the servant men were equallywell attired from the over-flowing wardrobe of their young masters; so that, indress, as well as in form and feature, in manner and speech, in tastes andhabits, the distance between these favored few, and the sorrow andhunger-smitten multitudes of the quarter and the field, was immense; and this isseldom passed over.Let us now glance at the stables and the carriage house, and we shall find thesame evidences of pride and luxurious extravagance. Here are three splendidcoaches, soft within and lustrous without. Here, too, are gigs, phaetons,barouches, sulkeys and sleighs. Here are saddles and harnesses—beautifullywrought and silver mounted—kept with every care. In the stable you will find,kept only for pleasure, full thirty-five horses, of the most approved blood forspeed and beauty. There are two men here constantly employed in taking care ofthese horses. One of these men must be always in the stable, to answer everycall from the great house. Over the way from the stable, is a house builtexpressly for the hounds—a pack of twenty-five or thirty—whose fare would havemade glad the heart of a dozen slaves. Horses and hounds are not the onlyconsumers of the slave’s toil. There was practiced, at the Lloyd’s, ahospitality which would have astonished and charmed any health-seeking northerndivine or merchant, who might have chanced to share it. Viewed from his owntable, and not from the field, the colonel was a model of generous hospitality.His house was, literally, a hotel, for weeks during the summer months. At thesetimes, especially, the air was freighted with the rich fumes of baking, boiling,roasting and broiling. The odors I shared with the winds; but the meats wereunder a more stringent monopoly except that, occasionally, I got a cake fromMas’ Daniel. In Mas’ Daniel I had a friend at court, from whom I learned manythings which my eager curiosity was excited to know. I always knew when companywas expected, and who they were, although I was an outsider, being the property,not of Col. Lloyd, but of a servant of the wealthy colonel. On these occasions,all that pride, taste and money could do, to dazzle and charm, was done.Who could say that the servants of Col. Lloyd were not well clad and cared for,after witnessing one of his magnificent entertainments? Who could say that theydid not seem to glory in being the slaves of such a master? Who, but a fanatic,could get up any sympathy for persons whose every movement was agile, easy andgraceful, and who evinced a consciousness of high superiority? And who wouldever venture to suspect that Col. Lloyd was subject to the troubles of ordinarymortals? Master and slave seem alike in their glory here? Can it all be seeming?Alas! it may only be a sham at last! This immense wealth; this gilded splendor;this profusion of luxury; this exemption from toil; this life of ease; this seaof plenty; aye, what of it all? Are the pearly gates of happiness and sweetcontent flung open to such suitors? far from it! The poor slave, on his hard,pine plank, but scantily covered with his thin blanket, sleeps more soundly thanthe feverish voluptuary who reclines upon his feather bed and downy pillow.Food, to the indolent lounger, is poison, not sustenance. Lurking beneath alltheir dishes, are invisible spirits of evil, ready to feed the self-deludedgormandizers which aches, pains, fierce temper, uncontrolled passions,dyspepsia, rheumatism, lumbago and gout; and of these the Lloyds got their fullshare. To the pampered love of ease, there is no resting place. What is pleasanttoday, is repulsive tomorrow; what is soft now, is hard at another time; what issweet in the morning, is bitter in the evening. Neither to the wicked, nor tothe idler, is there any solid peace: “Troubled, like the restless sea.”I had excellent opportunities of witnessing the restless discontent and thecapricious irritation of the Lloyds. My fondness for horses—not peculiar to memore than to other boys attracted me, much of the time, to the stables. Thisestablishment was especially under the care of “old” and “young” Barney—fatherand son. Old Barney was a fine looking old man, of a brownish complexion, whowas quite portly, and wore a dignified aspect for a slave. He was, evidently,much devoted to his profession, and held his office an honorable one. He was afarrier as well as an ostler; he could bleed, remove lampers from the mouths ofthe horses, and was well instructed in horse medicines. No one on the farm knew,so well as Old Barney, what to do with a sick horse. But his gifts andacquirements were of little advantage to him. His office was by no means anenviable one. He often got presents, but he got stripes as well; for in nothingwas Col. Lloyd more unreasonable and exacting, than in respect to the managementof his pleasure horses. Any supposed inattention to these animals were sure tobe visited with degrading punishment. His horses and dogs fared better than hismen. Their beds must be softer and cleaner than those of his human cattle. Noexcuse could shield Old Barney, if the colonel only suspected something wrongabout his horses; and, consequently, he was often punished when faultless. Itwas absolutely painful to listen to the many unreasonable and fretful scoldings,poured out at the stable, by Col. Lloyd, his sons and sons-in-law. Of thelatter, he had three—Messrs. Nicholson, Winder and Lownes. These all lived atthe great house a portion of the year, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping theservants when they pleased, which was by no means unfrequently. A horse wasseldom brought out of the stable to which no objection could be raised. “Therewas dust in his hair;” “there was a twist in his reins;” “his mane did not liestraight;” “he had not been properly grained;” “his head did not look well;”“his fore-top was not combed out;” “his fetlocks had not been properly trimmed;”something was always wrong. Listening to complaints, however groundless, Barneymust stand, hat in hand, lips sealed, never answering a word. He must make noreply, no explanation; the judgment of the master must be deemed infallible, forhis power is absolute and irresponsible. In a free state, a master, thuscomplaining without cause, of his ostler, might be told—“Sir, I am sorry Icannot please you, but, since I have done the best I can, your remedy is todismiss me.” Here, however, the ostler must stand, listen and tremble. One ofthe most heart-saddening and humiliating scenes I ever witnessed, was thewhipping of Old Barney, by Col. Lloyd himself. Here were two men, both advancedin years; there were the silvery locks of Col. L., and there was the bald andtoil-worn brow of Old Barney; master and slave; superior and inferior here, butequals at the bar of God; and, in the common course of events, they must bothsoon meet in another world, in a world where all distinctions, except thosebased on obedience and disobedience, are blotted out forever. “Uncover yourhead!” said the imperious master; he was obeyed. “Take off your jacket, you oldrascal!” and off came Barney’s jacket. “Down on your knees!” down knelt the oldman, his shoulders bare, his bald head glistening in the sun, and his aged kneeson the cold, damp ground. In his humble and debasing attitude, the master—thatmaster to whom he had given the best years and the best strength of hislife—came forward, and laid on thirty lashes, with his horse whip. The old manbore it patiently, to the last, answering each blow with a slight shrug of theshoulders, and a groan. I cannot think that Col. Lloyd succeeded in marring theflesh of Old Barney very seriously, for the whip was a light, riding whip; butthe spectacle of an aged man—a husband and a father—humbly kneeling before aworm of the dust, surprised and shocked me at the time; and since I have grownold enough to think on the wickedness of slavery, few facts have been of morevalue to me than this, to which I was a witness. It reveals slavery in its truecolor, and in its maturity of repulsive hatefulness. I owe it to truth, however,to say, that this was the first and the last time I ever saw Old Barney, or anyother slave, compelled to kneel to receive a whipping.I saw, at the stable, another incident, which I will relate, as it isillustrative of a phase of slavery to which I have already referred in anotherconnection. Besides two other coachmen, Col. Lloyd owned one named William, who,strangely enough, was often called by his surname, Wilks, by white and coloredpeople on the home plantation. Wilks was a very fine looking man. He was aboutas white as anybody on the plantation; and in manliness of form, and comelinessof features, he bore a very striking resemblance to Mr. Murray Lloyd. It waswhispered, and pretty generally admitted as a fact, that William Wilks was a sonof Col. Lloyd, by a highly favored slave-woman, who was still on the plantation.There were many reasons for believing this whisper, not only in William’sappearance, but in the undeniable freedom which he enjoyed over all others, andhis apparent consciousness of being something more than a slave to his master.It was notorious, too, that William had a deadly enemy in Murray Lloyd, whom heso much resembled, and that the latter greatly worried his father withimportunities to sell William. Indeed, he gave his father no rest until he didsell him, to Austin Woldfolk, the great slave-trader at that time. Beforeselling him, however, Mr. L. tried what giving William a whipping would do,toward making things smooth; but this was a failure. It was a compromise, anddefeated itself; for, immediately after the infliction, the heart-sickenedcolonel atoned to William for the abuse, by giving him a gold watch and chain.Another fact, somewhat curious, is, that though sold to the remorselessWoldfolk, taken in irons to Baltimore and cast into prison, with a view to beingdriven to the south, William, by some means—always a mystery to me—outbid allhis purchasers, paid for himself, and now resides in Baltimore, a FREEMAN. Isthere not room to suspect, that, as the gold watch was presented to atone forthe whipping, a purse of gold was given him by the same hand, with which toeffect his purchase, as an atonement for the indignity involved in selling hisown flesh and blood. All the circumstances of William, on the great house farm,show him to have occupied a different position from the other slaves, and,certainly, there is nothing in the supposed hostility of slaveholders toamalgamation, to forbid the supposition that William Wilks was the son of EdwardLloyd. Practical amalgamation is common in every neighborhood where I have beenin slavery.Col. Lloyd was not in the way of knowing much of the real opinions and feelingsof his slaves respecting him. The distance between him and them was far toogreat to admit of such knowledge. His slaves were so numerous, that he did notknow them when he saw them. Nor, indeed, did all his slaves know him. In thisrespect, he was inconveniently rich. It is reported of him, that, while ridingalong the road one day, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual wayof speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south: “Well, boy,who do you belong to?” “To Col. Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does thecolonel treat you well?” “No, sir,” was the ready reply. “What? does he work youtoo hard?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, don’t he give enough to eat?” “Yes, sir, he givesme enough, such as it is.” The colonel, after ascertaining where the slavebelonged, rode on; the slave also went on about his business, not dreaming thathe had been conversing with his master. He thought, said and heard nothing moreof the matter, until two or three weeks afterwards. The poor man was theninformed by his overseer, that, for having found fault with his master, he wasnow to be sold to a Georgia trader. He was immediately chained and handcuffed;and thus, without a moment’s warning he was snatched away, and forever sunderedfrom his family and friends, by a hand more unrelenting than that of death. Thisis the penalty of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plainquestions. It is partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquiredof as to their condition and the character of their masters, almost invariablysay they are contented, and that their masters are kind. Slaveholders have beenknown to send spies among their slaves, to ascertain, if possible, their viewsand feelings in regard to their condition. The frequency of this had the effectto establish among the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head.They suppress the truth rather than take the consequence of telling it, and, inso doing, they prove themselves a part of the human family. If they haveanything to say of their master, it is, generally, something in his favor,especially when speaking to strangers. I was frequently asked, while a slave, ifI had a kind master, and I do not remember ever to have given a negative reply.Nor did I, when pursuing this course, consider myself as uttering what wasutterly false; for I always measured the kindness of my master by the standardof kindness set up by slaveholders around us. However, slaves are like otherpeople, and imbibe similar prejudices. They are apt to think their conditionbetter than that of others. Many, under the influence of this prejudice, thinktheir own masters are better than the masters of other slaves; and this, too, insome cases, when the very reverse is true. Indeed, it is not uncommon for slaveseven to fall out and quarrel among themselves about the relative kindness oftheir masters, contending for the superior goodness of his own over that ofothers. At the very same time, they mutually execrate their masters, when viewedseparately. It was so on our plantation. When Col. Lloyd’s slaves met those ofJacob Jepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; Col.Lloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson’s slaves thathe was the smartest, man of the two. Col. Lloyd’s slaves would boost his abilityto buy and sell Jacob Jepson; Mr. Jepson’s slaves would boast his ability towhip Col. Lloyd. These quarrels would almost always end in a fight between theparties; those that beat were supposed to have gained the point at issue. Theyseemed to think that the greatness of their masters was transferable tothemselves. To be a SLAVE, was thought to be bad enough; but to be a poor man’sslave, was deemed a disgrace, indeed."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII. A CHAPTER OF HORRORSAUSTIN GORE—A SKETCH OF HIS CHARACTER—OVERSEERS AS A CLASS—THEIRPECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS—THE MARKED INDIVIDUALITY OF AUSTINGORE—HIS SENSE OF DUTY—HOW HE WHIPPED—MURDER OF POOR DENBY—HOW ITOCCURRED—SENSATION—HOW GORE MADE PEACE WITH COL. LLOYD—THE MURDERUNPUNISHED—ANOTHER DREADFUL MURDER NARRATED—NO LAWS FOR THE PROTECTIONOF SLAVES CAN BE ENFORCED IN THE SOUTHERN STATES.As I have already intimated elsewhere, the slaves on Col. Lloyd’s plantation,whose hard lot, under Mr. Sevier, the reader has already noticed and deplored,were not permitted to enjoy the comparatively moderate rule of Mr. Hopkins. Thelatter was succeeded by a very different man. The name of the new overseer wasAustin Gore. Upon this individual I would fix particular attention; for underhis rule there was more suffering from violence and bloodshed than had—accordingto the older slaves ever been experienced before on this plantation. I confess,I hardly know how to bring this man fitly before the reader. He was, it is true,an overseer, and possessed, to a large extent, the peculiar characteristics ofhis class; yet, to call him merely an overseer, would not give the reader a fairnotion of the man. I speak of overseers as a class. They are such. They are asdistinct from the slaveholding gentry of the south, as are the fishwomen ofParis, and the coal-heavers of London, distinct from other members of society.They constitute a separate fraternity at the south, not less marked than is thefraternity of Park Lane bullies in New York. They have been arranged andclassified by that great law of attraction, which determines the spheres andaffinities of men; which ordains, that men, whose malign and brutal propensitiespredominate over their moral and intellectual endowments, shall, naturally, fallinto those employments which promise the largest gratification to thosepredominating instincts or propensities. The office of overseer takes this rawmaterial of vulgarity and brutality, and stamps it as a distinct class ofsouthern society. But, in this class, as in all other classes, there arecharacters of marked individuality, even while they bear a general resemblanceto the mass. Mr. Gore was one of those, to whom a general characterization woulddo no manner of justice. He was an overseer; but he was something more. With themalign and tyrannical qualities of an overseer, he combined something of thelawful master. He had the artfulness and the mean ambition of his class; but hewas wholly free from the disgusting swagger and noisy bravado of his fraternity.There was an easy air of independence about him; a calm self-possession, and asternness of glance, which might well daunt hearts less timid than those of poorslaves, accustomed from childhood and through life to cower before a driver’slash. The home plantation of Col. Lloyd afforded an ample field for the exerciseof the qualifications for overseership, which he possessed in such an eminentdegree.Mr. Gore was one of those overseers, who could torture the slightest word orlook into impudence; he had the nerve, not only to resent, but to punish,promptly and severely. He never allowed himself to be answered back, by a slave.In this, he was as lordly and as imperious as Col. Edward Lloyd, himself; actingalways up to the maxim, practically maintained by slaveholders, that it isbetter that a dozen slaves suffer under the lash, without fault, than that themaster or the overseer should seem to have been wrong in the presence of theslave. Everything must be absolute here. Guilty or not guilty, it is enough tobe accused, to be sure of a flogging. The very presence of this man Gore waspainful, and I shunned him as I would have shunned a rattlesnake. His piercing,black eyes, and sharp, shrill voice, ever awakened sensations of terror amongthe slaves. For so young a man (I describe him as he was, twenty-five or thirtyyears ago) Mr. Gore was singularly reserved and grave in the presence of slaves.He indulged in no jokes, said no funny things, and kept his own counsels. Otheroverseers, how brutal soever they might be, were, at times, inclined to gainfavor with the slaves, by indulging a little pleasantry; but Gore was neverknown to be guilty of any such weakness. He was always the cold, distant,unapproachable overseer of Col. Edward Lloyd’s plantation, and needed no higherpleasure than was involved in a faithful discharge of the duties of his office.When he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty, and feared noconsequences. What Hopkins did reluctantly, Gore did with alacrity. There was astern will, an iron-like reality, about this Gore, which would have easily madehim the chief of a band of pirates, had his environments been favorable to sucha course of life. All the coolness, savage barbarity and freedom from moralrestraint, which are necessary in the character of a pirate-chief, centered, Ithink, in this man Gore. Among many other deeds of shocking cruelty which heperpetrated, while I was at Mr. Lloyd’s, was the murder of a young colored man,named Denby. He was sometimes called Bill Denby, or Demby; (I write from sound,and the sounds on Lloyd’s plantation are not very certain.) I knew him well. Hewas a powerful young man, full of animal spirits, and, so far as I know, he wasamong the most valuable of Col. Lloyd’s slaves. In something—I know not what—heoffended this Mr. Austin Gore, and, in accordance with the custom of the latter,he under took to flog him. He gave Denby but few stripes; the latter broke awayfrom him and plunged into the creek, and, standing there to the depth of hisneck in water, he refused to come out at the order of the overseer; whereupon,for this refusal, Gore shot him dead! It is said that Gore gave Denby threecalls, telling him that if he did not obey the last call, he would shoot him.When the third call was given, Denby stood his ground firmly; and this raisedthe question, in the minds of the by-standing slaves—“Will he dare to shoot?”Mr. Gore, without further parley, and without making any further effort toinduce Denby to come out of the water, raised his gun deliberately to his face,took deadly aim at his standing victim, and, in an instant, poor Denby wasnumbered with the dead. His mangled body sank out of sight, and only his warm,red blood marked the place where he had stood.This devilish outrage, this fiendish murder, produced, as it was well calculatedto do, a tremendous sensation. A thrill of horror flashed through every soul onthe plantation, if I may except the guilty wretch who had committed thehell-black deed. While the slaves generally were panic-struck, and howling withalarm, the murderer himself was calm and collected, and appeared as thoughnothing unusual had happened. The atrocity roused my old master, and he spokeout, in reprobation of it; but the whole thing proved to be less than a ninedays’ wonder. Both Col. Lloyd and my old master arraigned Gore for his crueltyin the matter, but this amounted to nothing. His reply, or explanation—as Iremember to have heard it at the time was, that the extraordinary expedient wasdemanded by necessity; that Denby had become unmanageable; that he had set adangerous example to the other slaves; and that, without some such promptmeasure as that to which he had resorted, were adopted, there would be an end toall rule and order on the plantation. That very convenient covert for all mannerof cruelty and outrage that cowardly alarm-cry, that the slaves would “take theplace,” was pleaded, in extenuation of this revolting crime, just as it had beencited in defense of a thousand similar ones. He argued, that if one slaverefused to be corrected, and was allowed to escape with his life, when he hadbeen told that he should lose it if he persisted in his course, the other slaveswould soon copy his example; the result of which would be, the freedom of theslaves, and the enslavement of the whites. I have every reason to believe thatMr. Gore’s defense, or explanation, was deemed satisfactory—at least to Col.Lloyd. He was continued in his office on the plantation. His fame as an overseerwent abroad, and his horrid crime was not even submitted to judicialinvestigation. The murder was committed in the presence of slaves, and they, ofcourse, could neither institute a suit, nor testify against the murderer. Hisbare word would go further in a court of law, than the united testimony of tenthousand black witnesses.All that Mr. Gore had to do, was to make his peace with Col. Lloyd. This done,and the guilty perpetrator of one of the most foul murders goes unwhipped ofjustice, and uncensured by the community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived inSt. Michael’s, Talbot county, when I left Maryland; if he is still alive heprobably yet resides there; and I have no reason to doubt that he is now ashighly esteemed, and as greatly respected, as though his guilty soul had neverbeen stained with innocent blood. I am well aware that what I have now writtenwill by some be branded as false and malicious. It will be denied, not only thatsuch a thing ever did transpire, as I have now narrated, but that such a thingcould happen in Maryland. I can only say—believe it or not—that I have saidnothing but the literal truth, gainsay it who may.I speak advisedly when I say this,—that killing a slave, or any colored person,in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by the courts orthe community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, ship carpenter, of St. Michael’s, killed twoslaves, one of whom he butchered with a hatchet, by knocking his brains out. Heused to boast of the commission of the awful and bloody deed. I have heard himdo so, laughingly, saying, among other things, that he was the only benefactorof his country in the company, and that when “others would do as much as he haddone, we should be relieved of the d—d niggers.”As an evidence of the reckless disregard of human life where the life is that ofa slave I may state the notorious fact, that the wife of Mr. Giles Hicks, wholived but a short distance from Col. Lloyd’s, with her own hands murdered mywife’s cousin, a young girl between fifteen and sixteen years of age—mutilatingher person in a most shocking manner. The atrocious woman, in the paroxysm ofher wrath, not content with murdering her victim, literally mangled her face,and broke her breast bone. Wild, however, and infuriated as she was, she tookthe precaution to cause the slave-girl to be buried; but the facts of the casecoming abroad, very speedily led to the disinterment of the remains of themurdered slave-girl. A coroner’s jury was assembled, who decided that the girlhad come to her death by severe beating. It was ascertained that the offense forwhich this girl was thus hurried out of the world, was this: she had been setthat night, and several preceding nights, to mind Mrs. Hicks’s baby, and havingfallen into a sound sleep, the baby cried, waking Mrs. Hicks, but not theslave-girl. Mrs. Hicks, becoming infuriated at the girl’s tardiness, aftercalling several times, jumped from her bed and seized a piece of fire-wood fromthe fireplace; and then, as she lay fast asleep, she deliberately pounded in herskull and breast-bone, and thus ended her life. I will not say that this mosthorrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It did produce asensation; but, incredible to tell, the moral sense of the community was bluntedtoo entirely by the ordinary nature of slavery horrors, to bring the murderessto punishment. A warrant was issued for her arrest, but, for some reason orother, that warrant was never served. Thus did Mrs. Hicks not only escapecondign punishment, but even the pain and mortification of being arraignedbefore a court of justice.Whilst I am detailing the bloody deeds that took place during my stay on Col.Lloyd’s plantation, I will briefly narrate another dark transaction, whichoccurred about the same time as the murder of Denby by Mr. Gore.On the side of the river Wye, opposite from Col. Lloyd’s, there lived a Mr. BealBondley, a wealthy slaveholder. In the direction of his land, and near theshore, there was an excellent oyster fishing ground, and to this, some of theslaves of Col. Lloyd occasionally resorted in their little canoes, at night,with a view to make up the deficiency of their scanty allowance of food, by theoysters that they could easily get there. This, Mr. Bondley took it into hishead to regard as a trespass, and while an old man belonging to Col. Lloyd wasengaged in catching a few of the many millions of oysters that lined the bottomof that creek, to satisfy his hunger, the villainous Mr. Bondley, lying inambush, without the slightest ceremony, discharged the contents of his musketinto the back and shoulders of the poor old man. As good fortune would have it,the shot did not prove mortal, and Mr. Bondley came over, the next day, to seeCol. Lloyd—whether to pay him for his property, or to justify himself for whathe had done, I know not; but this I can say, the cruel and dastardly transactionwas speedily hushed up; there was very little said about it at all, and nothingwas publicly done which looked like the application of the principle of justiceto the man whom chance, only, saved from being an actual murderer. One of thecommonest sayings to which my ears early became accustomed, on Col. Lloyd’splantation and elsewhere in Maryland, was, that it was “worth but half a cent tokill a nigger, and a half a cent to bury him;” and the facts of my experience gofar to justify the practical truth of this strange proverb. Laws for theprotection of the lives of the slaves, are, as they must needs be, utterlyincapable of being enforced, where the very parties who are nominally protected,are not permitted to give evidence, in courts of law, against the only class ofpersons from whom abuse, outrage and murder might be reasonably apprehended.While I heard of numerous murders committed by slaveholders on the EasternShores of Maryland, I never knew a solitary instance in which a slaveholder waseither hung or imprisoned for having murdered a slave. The usual pretext forkilling a slave is, that the slave has offered resistance. Should a slave, whenassaulted, but raise his hand in self defense, the white assaulting party isfully justified by southern, or Maryland, public opinion, in shooting the slavedown. Sometimes this is done, simply because it is alleged that the slave hasbeen saucy. But here I leave this phase of the society of my early childhood,and will relieve the kind reader of these heart-sickening details.CHAPTER IX. PERSONAL TREATMENTMISS LUCRETIA—HER KINDNESS—HOW IT WAS MANIFESTED—“IKE”—A BATTLEWITH HIM—THE CONSEQUENCES THEREOF—MISS LUCRETIA’S BALSAM—BREAD—HOWI OBTAINED IT—BEAMS OF SUNLIGHT AMIDST THE GENERAL DARKNESS—SUFFERINGFROM COLD—HOW WE TOOK OUR MEALS—ORDERS TO PREPAREFOR BALTIMORE—OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT OF QUITTING THEPLANTATION—EXTRAORDINARY CLEANSING—COUSIN TOM’S VERSION OFBALTIMORE—ARRIVAL THERE—KIND RECEPTION GIVEN ME BY MRS. SOPHIAAULD—LITTLE TOMMY—MY NEW POSITION—MY NEW DUTIES—A TURNING POINT INMY HISTORY.I have nothing cruel or shocking to relate of my own personal experience, whileI remained on Col. Lloyd’s plantation, at the home of my old master. Anoccasional cuff from Aunt Katy, and a regular whipping from old master, such asany heedless and mischievous boy might get from his father, is all that I canmention of this sort. I was not old enough to work in the field, and, therebeing little else than field work to perform, I had much leisure. The most I hadto do, was, to drive up the cows in the evening, to keep the front yard clean,and to perform small errands for my young mistress, Lucretia Auld. I havereasons for thinking this lady was very kindly disposed toward me, and, althoughI was not often the object of her attention, I constantly regarded her as myfriend, and was always glad when it was my privilege to do her a service. In afamily where there was so much that was harsh, cold and indifferent, theslightest word or look of kindness passed, with me, for its full value. MissLucretia—as we all continued to call her long after her marriage—had bestowedupon me such words and looks as taught me that she pitied me, if she did notlove me. In addition to words and looks, she sometimes gave me a piece of breadand butter; a thing not set down in the bill of fare, and which must have beenan extra ration, planned aside from either Aunt Katy or old master, solely outof the tender regard and friendship she had for me. Then, too, I one day gotinto the wars with Uncle Able’s son, “Ike,” and had got sadly worsted; in fact,the little rascal had struck me directly in the forehead with a sharp piece ofcinder, fused with iron, from the old blacksmith’s forge, which made a cross inmy forehead very plainly to be seen now. The gash bled very freely, and I roaredvery loudly and betook myself home. The coldhearted Aunt Katy paid no attentioneither to my wound or my roaring, except to tell me it served me right; I had nobusiness with Ike; it was good for me; I would now keep away “from dem Lloydniggers.” Miss Lucretia, in this state of the case, came forward; and, in quitea different spirit from that manifested by Aunt Katy, she called me into theparlor (an extra privilege of itself) and, without using toward me any of thehard-hearted and reproachful epithets of my kitchen tormentor, she quietly actedthe good Samaritan. With her own soft hand she washed the blood from my head andface, fetched her own balsam bottle, and with the balsam wetted a nice piece ofwhite linen, and bound up my head. The balsam was not more healing to the woundin my head, than her kindness was healing to the wounds in my spirit, made bythe unfeeling words of Aunt Katy. After this, Miss Lucretia was my friend. Ifelt her to be such; and I have no doubt that the simple act of binding up myhead, did much to awaken in her mind an interest in my welfare. It is quitetrue, that this interest was never very marked, and it seldom showed itself inanything more than in giving me a piece of bread when I was hungry; but this wasa great favor on a slave plantation, and I was the only one of the children towhom such attention was paid. When very hungry, I would go into the back yardand play under Miss Lucretia’s window. When pretty severely pinched by hunger, Ihad a habit of singing, which the good lady very soon came to understand as apetition for a piece of bread. When I sung under Miss Lucretia’s window, I wasvery apt to get well paid for my music. The reader will see that I now had twofriends, both at important points—Mas’ Daniel at the great house, and MissLucretia at home. From Mas’ Daniel I got protection from the bigger boys; andfrom Miss Lucretia I got bread, by singing when I was hungry, and sympathy whenI was abused by that termagant, who had the reins of government in the kitchen.For such friendship I felt deeply grateful, and bitter as are my recollectionsof slavery, I love to recall any instances of kindness, any sunbeams of humanetreatment, which found way to my soul through the iron grating of my house ofbondage. Such beams seem all the brighter from the general darkness into whichthey penetrate, and the impression they make is vividly distinct and beautiful.As I have before intimated, I was seldom whipped—and never severely—by my oldmaster. I suffered little from the treatment I received, except from hunger andcold. These were my two great physical troubles. I could neither get asufficiency of food nor of clothing; but I suffered less from hunger than fromcold. In hottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost in a state ofnudity; no shoes, no stockings, no jacket, no trowsers; nothing but coarsesackcloth or tow-linen, made into a sort of shirt, reaching down to my knees.This I wore night and day, changing it once a week. In the day time I couldprotect myself pretty well, by keeping on the sunny side of the house; and inbad weather, in the corner of the kitchen chimney. The great difficulty was, tokeep warm during the night. I had no bed. The pigs in the pen had leaves, andthe horses in the stable had straw, but the children had no beds. They lodgedanywhere in the ample kitchen. I slept, generally, in a little closet, withouteven a blanket to cover me. In very cold weather. I sometimes got down the bagin which corn meal was usually carried to the mill, and crawled into that.Sleeping there, with my head in and feet out, I was partly protected, though notcomfortable. My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen withwhich I am writing might be laid in the gashes. The manner of taking our mealsat old master’s, indicated but little refinement. Our corn-meal mush, whensufficiently cooled, was placed in a large wooden tray, or trough, like thoseused in making maple sugar here in the north. This tray was set down, either onthe floor of the kitchen, or out of doors on the ground; and the children werecalled, like so many pigs; and like so many pigs they would come, and literallydevour the mush—some with oyster shells, some with pieces of shingles, and nonewith spoons. He that eat fastest got most, and he that was strongest got thebest place; and few left the trough really satisfied. I was the most unlucky ofany, for Aunt Katy had no good feeling for me; and if I pushed any of the otherchildren, or if they told her anything unfavorable of me, she always believedthe worst, and was sure to whip me.As I grew older and more thoughtful, I was more and more filled with a sense ofmy wretchedness. The cruelty of Aunt Katy, the hunger and cold I suffered, andthe terrible reports of wrong and outrage which came to my ear, together withwhat I almost daily witnessed, led me, when yet but eight or nine years old, towish I had never been born. I used to contrast my condition with theblack-birds, in whose wild and sweet songs I fancied them so happy! Theirapparent joy only deepened the shades of my sorrow. There are thoughtful days inthe lives of children—at least there were in mine when they grapple with all thegreat, primary subjects of knowledge, and reach, in a moment, conclusions whichno subsequent experience can shake. I was just as well aware of the unjust,unnatural and murderous character of slavery, when nine years old, as I am now.Without any appeal to books, to laws, or to authorities of any kind, it wasenough to accept God as a father, to regard slavery as a crime.I was not ten years old when I left Col. Lloyd’s plantation for Balitmore(sic).I left that plantation with inexpressible joy. I never shall forget the ecstacywith which I received the intelligence from my friend, Miss Lucretia, that myold master had determined to let me go to Baltimore to live with Mr. Hugh Auld,a brother to Mr. Thomas Auld, my old master’s son-in-law. I received thisinformation about three days before my departure. They were three of thehappiest days of my childhood. I spent the largest part of these three days inthe creek, washing off the plantation scurf, and preparing for my new home. Mrs.Lucretia took a lively interest in getting me ready. She told me I must get allthe dead skin off my feet and knees, before I could go to Baltimore, for thepeople there were very cleanly, and would laugh at me if I looked dirty; and,besides, she was intending to give me a pair of trowsers, which I should not puton unless I got all the dirt off. This was a warning to which I was bound totake heed; for the thought of owning a pair of trowsers, was great, indeed. Itwas almost a sufficient motive, not only to induce me to scrub off the mange (aspig drovers would call it) but the skin as well. So I went at it in goodearnest, working for the first time in the hope of reward. I was greatlyexcited, and could hardly consent to sleep, lest I should be left. The tiesthat, ordinarily, bind children to their homes, were all severed, or they neverhad any existence in my case, at least so far as the home plantation of Col. L.was concerned. I therefore found no severe trail at the moment of my departure,such as I had experienced when separated from my home in Tuckahoe. My home at myold master’s was charmless to me; it was not home, but a prison to me; onparting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving anything which I could haveenjoyed by staying. My mother was now long dead; my grandmother was far away, sothat I seldom saw her; Aunt Katy was my unrelenting tormentor; and my twosisters and brothers, owing to our early separation in life, and thefamily-destroying power of slavery, were, comparatively, strangers to me. Thefact of our relationship was almost blotted out. I looked for home elsewhere,and was confident of finding none which I should relish less than the one I wasleaving. If, however, I found in my new home to which I was going with suchblissful anticipations—hardship, whipping and nakedness, I had the questionableconsolation that I should not have escaped any one of these evils by remainingunder the management of Aunt Katy. Then, too, I thought, since I had enduredmuch in this line on Lloyd’s plantation, I could endure as much elsewhere, andespecially at Baltimore; for I had something of the feeling about that citywhich is expressed in the saying, that being “hanged in England, is better thandying a natural death in Ireland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore.My cousin Tom—a boy two or three years older than I—had been there, and thoughnot fluent (he stuttered immoderately) in speech, he had inspired me with thatdesire, by his eloquent description of the place. Tom was, sometimes, Capt.Auld’s cabin boy; and when he came from Baltimore, he was always a sort of heroamongst us, at least till his Baltimore trip was forgotten. I could never tellhim of anything, or point out anything that struck me as beautiful or powerful,but that he had seen something in Baltimore far surpassing it. Even the greathouse itself, with all its pictures within, and pillars without, he had thehardihood to say “was nothing to Baltimore.” He bought a trumpet (worth sixpence) and brought it home; told what he had seen in the windows of stores; thathe had heard shooting crackers, and seen soldiers; that he had seen a steamboat;that there were ships in Baltimore that could carry four such sloops as the“Sally Lloyd.” He said a great deal about the market-house; he spoke of thebells ringing; and of many other things which roused my curiosity very much;and, indeed, which heightened my hopes of happiness in my new home.We sailed out of Miles river for Baltimore early on a Saturday morning. Iremember only the day of the week; for, at that time, I had no knowledge of thedays of the month, nor, indeed, of the months of the year. On setting sail, Iwalked aft, and gave to Col. Lloyd’s plantation what I hoped would be the lastlook I should ever give to it, or to any place like it. My strong aversion tothe great farm, was not owing to my own personal suffering, but the dailysuffering of others, and to the certainty that I must, sooner or later, beplaced under the barbarous rule of an overseer, such as the accomplished Gore,or the brutal and drunken Plummer. After taking this last view, I quitted thequarter deck, made my way to the bow of the sloop, and spent the remainder ofthe day in looking ahead; interesting myself in what was in the distance, ratherthan what was near by or behind. The vessels, sweeping along the bay, were veryinteresting objects. The broad bay opened like a shoreless ocean on my boyishvision, filling me with wonder and admiration.Late in the afternoon, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the state, stoppingthere not long enough to admit of my going ashore. It was the first large town Ihad ever seen; and though it was inferior to many a factory village in NewEngland, my feelings, on seeing it, were excited to a pitch very little belowthat reached by travelers at the first view of Rome. The dome of the state housewas especially imposing, and surpassed in grandeur the appearance of the greathouse. The great world was opening upon me very rapidly, and I was eagerlyacquainting myself with its multifarious lessons.We arrived in Baltimore on Sunday morning, and landed at Smith’s wharf, not farfrom Bowly’s wharf. We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep, for theBaltimore market; and, after assisting in driving them to the slaughter house ofMr. Curtis, on Loudon Slater’s Hill, I was speedily conducted by Rich—one of thehands belonging to the sloop—to my new home in Alliciana street, near Gardiner’sship-yard, on Fell’s Point. Mr. and Mrs. Hugh Auld, my new mistress and master,were both at home, and met me at the door with their rosy cheeked little son,Thomas, to take care of whom was to constitute my future occupation. In fact, itwas to “little Tommy,” rather than to his parents, that old master made apresent of me; and though there was no legal form or arrangement entered into, Ihave no doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Auld felt that, in due time, I should be thelegal property of their bright-eyed and beloved boy, Tommy. I was struck withthe appearance, especially, of my new mistress. Her face was lighted with thekindliest emotions; and the reflex influence of her countenance, as well as thetenderness with which she seemed to regard me, while asking me sundry littlequestions, greatly delighted me, and lit up, to my fancy, the pathway of myfuture. Miss Lucretia was kind; but my new mistress, “Miss Sophy,” surpassed herin kindness of manner. Little Thomas was affectionately told by his mother, that“there was his Freddy,” and that “Freddy would take care of him;” and I was toldto “be kind to little Tommy”—an injunction I scarcely needed, for I had alreadyfallen in love with the dear boy; and with these little ceremonies I wasinitiated into my new home, and entered upon my peculiar duties, with not acloud above the horizon.I may say here, that I regard my removal from Col. Lloyd’s plantation as one ofthe most interesting and fortunate events of my life. Viewing it in the light ofhuman likelihoods, it is quite probable that, but for the mere circumstance ofbeing thus removed before the rigors of slavery had fastened upon me; before myyoung spirit had been crushed under the iron control of the slave-driver,instead of being, today, a FREEMAN, I might have been wearing the galling chainsof slavery. I have sometimes felt, however, that there was something moreintelligent than chance, and something more certain than luck, to be seen in thecircumstance. If I have made any progress in knowledge; if I have cherished anyhonorable aspirations, or have, in any manner, worthily discharged the duties ofa member of an oppressed people; this little circumstance must be allowed itsdue weight in giving my life that direction. I have ever regarded it as thefirst plain manifestation of that Divinity that shapes our ends, Rough hew them as we will.I was not the only boy on the plantation that might have been sent to live inBaltimore. There was a wide margin from which to select. There were boysyounger, boys older, and boys of the same age, belonging to my old master someat his own house, and some at his farm—but the high privilege fell to my lot.I may be deemed superstitious and egotistical, in regarding this event as aspecial interposition of Divine Providence in my favor; but the thought is apart of my history, and I should be false to the earliest and most cherishedsentiments of my soul, if I suppressed, or hesitated to avow that opinion,although it may be characterized as irrational by the wise, and ridiculous bythe scoffer. From my earliest recollections of serious matters, I date theentertainment of something like an ineffaceable conviction, that slavery wouldnot always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and this conviction, likea word of living faith, strengthened me through the darkest trials of my lot.This good spirit was from God; and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise.CHAPTER X. LIFE IN BALTIMORECITY ANNOYANCES—PLANTATION REGRETS—MY MISTRESS, MISS SOPHA—HERHISTORY—HER KINDNESS TO ME—MY MASTER, HUGH AULD—HIS SOURNESS—MYINCREASED SENSITIVENESS—MY COMFORTS—MY OCCUPATION—THE BANEFUL EFFECTSOF SLAVEHOLDING ON MY DEAR AND GOOD MISTRESS—HOW SHE COMMENCED TEACHINGME TO READ—WHY SHE CEASED TEACHING ME—CLOUDS GATHERING OVER MYBRIGHT PROSPECTS—MASTER AULD’S EXPOSITION OF THE TRUE PHILOSOPHY OFSLAVERY—CITY SLAVES—PLANTATION SLAVES—THE CONTRAST—EXCEPTIONS—MR.HAMILTON’S TWO SLAVES, HENRIETTA AND MARY—MRS. HAMILTON’S CRUELTREATMENT OF THEM—THE PITEOUS ASPECT THEY PRESENTED—NO POWER MUST COMEBETWEEN THE SLAVE AND THE SLAVEHOLDER.Once in Baltimore, with hard brick pavements under my feet, which almost raisedblisters, by their very heat, for it was in the height of summer; walled in onall sides by towering brick buildings; with troops of hostile boys ready topounce upon me at every street corner; with new and strange objects glaring uponme at every step, and with startling sounds reaching my ears from alldirections, I for a time thought that, after all, the home plantation was a moredesirable place of residence than my home on Alliciana street, in Baltimore. Mycountry eyes and ears were confused and bewildered here; but the boys were mychief trouble. They chased me, and called me “Eastern Shore man,” till really Ialmost wished myself back on the Eastern Shore. I had to undergo a sort of moralacclimation, and when that was over, I did much better. My new mistress happilyproved to be all she seemed to be, when, with her husband, she met me at thedoor, with a most beaming, benignant countenance. She was, naturally, of anexcellent disposition, kind, gentle and cheerful. The supercilious contempt forthe rights and feelings of the slave, and the petulance and bad humor whichgenerally characterize slaveholding ladies, were all quite absent from kind“Miss” Sophia’s manner and bearing toward me. She had, in truth, never been aslaveholder, but had—a thing quite unusual in the south—depended almost entirelyupon her own industry for a living. To this fact the dear lady, no doubt, owedthe excellent preservation of her natural goodness of heart, for slavery canchange a saint into a sinner, and an angel into a demon. I hardly knew how tobehave toward “Miss Sopha,” as I used to call Mrs. Hugh Auld. I had been treatedas a pig on the plantation; I was treated as a child now. I could not evenapproach her as I had formerly approached Mrs. Thomas Auld. How could I hangdown my head, and speak with bated breath, when there was no pride to scorn me,no coldness to repel me, and no hatred to inspire me with fear? I therefore soonlearned to regard her as something more akin to a mother, than a slaveholdingmistress. The crouching servility of a slave, usually so acceptable a quality tothe haughty slaveholder, was not understood nor desired by this gentle woman. Sofar from deeming it impudent in a slave to look her straight in the face, assome slaveholding ladies do, she seemed ever to say, “look up, child; don’t beafraid; see, I am full of kindness and good will toward you.” The handsbelonging to Col. Lloyd’s sloop, esteemed it a great privilege to be the bearersof parcels or messages to my new mistress; for whenever they came, they weresure of a most kind and pleasant reception. If little Thomas was her son, andher most dearly beloved child, she, for a time, at least, made me something likehis half-brother in her affections. If dear Tommy was exalted to a place on hismother’s knee, “Feddy” was honored by a place at his mother’s side. Nor did helack the caressing strokes of her gentle hand, to convince him that, thoughmotherless, he was not friendless. Mrs. Auld was not only a kind-hearted woman,but she was remarkably pious; frequent in her attendance of public worship, muchgiven to reading the bible, and to chanting hymns of praise, when alone. Mr.Hugh Auld was altogether a different character. He cared very little aboutreligion, knew more of the world, and was more of the world, than his wife. Heset out, doubtless to be—as the world goes—a respectable man, and to get on bybecoming a successful ship builder, in that city of ship building. This was hisambition, and it fully occupied him. I was, of course, of very littleconsequence to him, compared with what I was to good Mrs. Auld; and, when hesmiled upon me, as he sometimes did, the smile was borrowed from his lovelywife, and, like all borrowed light, was transient, and vanished with the sourcewhence it was derived. While I must characterize Master Hugh as being a verysour man, and of forbidding appearance, it is due to him to acknowledge, that hewas never very cruel to me, according to the notion of cruelty in Maryland. Thefirst year or two which I spent in his house, he left me almost exclusively tothe management of his wife. She was my law-giver. In hands so tender as hers,and in the absence of the cruelties of the plantation, I became, both physicallyand mentally, much more sensitive to good and ill treatment; and, perhaps,suffered more from a frown from my mistress, than I formerly did from a cuff atthe hands of Aunt Katy. Instead of the cold, damp floor of my old master’skitchen, I found myself on carpets; for the corn bag in winter, I now had a goodstraw bed, well furnished with covers; for the coarse corn-meal in the morning,I now had good bread, and mush occasionally; for my poor tow-lien shirt,reaching to my knees, I had good, clean clothes. I was really well off. Myemployment was to run errands, and to take care of Tommy; to prevent his gettingin the way of carriages, and to keep him out of harm’s way generally. Tommy, andI, and his mother, got on swimmingly together, for a time. I say for a time,because the fatal poison of irresponsible power, and the natural influence ofslavery customs, were not long in making a suitable impression on the gentle andloving disposition of my excellent mistress. At first, Mrs. Auld evidentlyregarded me simply as a child, like any other child; she had not come to regardme as property. This latter thought was a thing of conventional growth. Thefirst was natural and spontaneous. A noble nature, like hers, could not,instantly, be wholly perverted; and it took several years to change the naturalsweetness of her temper into fretful bitterness. In her worst estate, however,there were, during the first seven years I lived with her, occasional returns ofher former kindly disposition.The frequent hearing of my mistress reading the bible for she often read aloudwhen her husband was absent soon awakened my curiosity in respect to thismystery of reading, and roused in me the desire to learn. Having no fear of mykind mistress before my eyes, (she had then given me no reason to fear,) Ifrankly asked her to teach me to read; and, without hesitation, the dear womanbegan the task, and very soon, by her assistance, I was master of the alphabet,and could spell words of three or four letters. My mistress seemed almost asproud of my progress, as if I had been her own child; and, supposing that herhusband would be as well pleased, she made no secret of what she was doing forme. Indeed, she exultingly told him of the aptness of her pupil, of herintention to persevere in teaching me, and of the duty which she felt it toteach me, at least to read the bible. Here arose the first cloud over myBaltimore prospects, the precursor of drenching rains and chilling blasts.Master Hugh was amazed at the simplicity of his spouse, and, probably for thefirst time, he unfolded to her the true philosophy of slavery, and the peculiarrules necessary to be observed by masters and mistresses, in the management oftheir human chattels. Mr. Auld promptly forbade continuance of her instruction;telling her, in the first place, that the thing itself was unlawful; that it wasalso unsafe, and could only lead to mischief. To use his own words, further, hesaid, “if you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell;” “he should knownothing but the will of his master, and learn to obey it.” “if you teach thatnigger—speaking of myself—how to read the bible, there will be no keeping him;”“it would forever unfit him for the duties of a slave;” and “as to himself,learning would do him no good, but probably, a great deal of harm—making himdisconsolate and unhappy.” “If you learn him now to read, he’ll want to know howto write; and, this accomplished, he’ll be running away with himself.” Such wasthe tenor of Master Hugh’s oracular exposition of the true philosophy oftraining a human chattel; and it must be confessed that he very clearlycomprehended the nature and the requirements of the relation of master andslave. His discourse was the first decidedly anti-slavery lecture to which ithad been my lot to listen. Mrs. Auld evidently felt the force of his remarks;and, like an obedient wife, began to shape her course in the direction indicatedby her husband. The effect of his words, on me, was neither slight nortransitory. His iron sentences—cold and harsh—sunk deep into my heart, andstirred up not only my feelings into a sort of rebellion, but awakened within mea slumbering train of vital thought. It was a new and special revelation,dispelling a painful mystery, against which my youthful understanding hadstruggled, and struggled in vain, to wit: the white man’s power to perpetuatethe enslavement of the black man. “Very well,” thought I; “knowledge unfits achild to be a slave.” I instinctively assented to the proposition; and from thatmoment I understood the direct pathway from slavery to freedom. This was justwhat I needed; and I got it at a time, and from a source, whence I leastexpected it. I was saddened at the thought of losing the assistance of my kindmistress; but the information, so instantly derived, to some extent compensatedme for the loss I had sustained in this direction. Wise as Mr. Auld was, heevidently underrated my comprehension, and had little idea of the use to which Iwas capable of putting the impressive lesson he was giving to his wife. Hewanted me to be a slave; I had already voted against that on the home plantationof Col. Lloyd. That which he most loved I most hated; and the very determinationwhich he expressed to keep me in ignorance, only rendered me the more resolutein seeking intelligence. In learning to read, therefore, I am not sure that I donot owe quite as much to the opposition of my master, as to the kindlyassistance of my amiable mistress. I acknowledge the benefit rendered me by theone, and by the other; believing, that but for my mistress, I might have grownup in ignorance.I had resided but a short time in Baltimore, before I observed a markeddifference in the manner of treating slaves, generally, from which I hadwitnessed in that isolated and out-of-the-way part of the country where I beganlife. A city slave is almost a free citizen, in Baltimore, compared with a slaveon Col. Lloyd’s plantation. He is much better fed and clothed, is less dejectedin his appearance, and enjoys privileges altogether unknown to the whip-drivenslave on the plantation. Slavery dislikes a dense population, in which there isa majority of non-slaveholders. The general sense of decency that must pervadesuch a population, does much to check and prevent those outbreaks of atrociouscruelty, and those dark crimes without a name, almost openly perpetrated on theplantation. He is a desperate slaveholder who will shock the humanity of hisnon-slaveholding neighbors, by the cries of the lacerated slaves; and very fewin the city are willing to incur the odium of being cruel masters. I found, inBaltimore, that no man was more odious to the white, as well as to the coloredpeople, than he, who had the reputation of starving his slaves. Work them, flogthem, if need be, but don’t starve them. These are, however, some painfulexceptions to this rule. While it is quite true that most of the slaveholders inBaltimore feed and clothe their slaves well, there are others who keep up theircountry cruelties in the city.An instance of this sort is furnished in the case of a family who lived directlyopposite to our house, and were named Hamilton. Mrs. Hamilton owned two slaves.Their names were Henrietta and Mary. They had always been house slaves. One wasaged about twenty-two, and the other about fourteen. They were a fragile coupleby nature, and the treatment they received was enough to break down theconstitution of a horse. Of all the dejected, emaciated, mangled and excoriatedcreatures I ever saw, those two girls—in the refined, church going and Christiancity of Baltimore were the most deplorable. Of stone must that heart be made,that could look upon Henrietta and Mary, without being sickened to the core withsadness. Especially was Mary a heart-sickening object. Her head, neck andshoulders, were literally cut to pieces. I have frequently felt her head, andfound it nearly covered over with festering sores, caused by the lash of hercruel mistress. I do not know that her master ever whipped her, but I have oftenbeen an eye witness of the revolting and brutal inflictions by Mrs. Hamilton;and what lends a deeper shade to this woman’s conduct, is the fact, that, almostin the very moments of her shocking outrages of humanity and decency, she wouldcharm you by the sweetness of her voice and her seeming piety. She used to sitin a large rocking chair, near the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin,such as I have elsewhere described; and I speak within the truth when I say,that these girls seldom passed that chair, during the day, without a blow fromthat cowskin, either upon their bare arms, or upon their shoulders. As theypassed her, she would draw her cowskin and give them a blow, saying, “movefaster, you black jip!” and, again, “take that, you black jip!” continuing, “ifyou don’t move faster, I will give you more.” Then the lady would go on, singingher sweet hymns, as though her righteous soul were sighing for the holy realmsof paradise.Added to the cruel lashings to which these poor slave-girls weresubjected—enough in themselves to crush the spirit of men—they were, really,kept nearly half starved; they seldom knew what it was to eat a full meal,except when they got it in the kitchens of neighbors, less mean and stingy thanthe psalm-singing Mrs. Hamilton. I have seen poor Mary contending for the offal,with the pigs in the street. So much was the poor girl pinched, kicked, cut andpecked to pieces, that the boys in the street knew her only by the name of“pecked,” a name derived from the scars and blotches on her neck, head andshoulders.It is some relief to this picture of slavery in Baltimore, to say—what is butthe simple truth—that Mrs. Hamilton’s treatment of her slaves was generallycondemned, as disgraceful and shocking; but while I say this, it must also beremembered, that the very parties who censured the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton,would have condemned and promptly punished any attempt to interfere with Mrs.Hamilton’s right to cut and slash her slaves to pieces. There must be no forcebetween the slave and the slaveholder, to restrain the power of the one, andprotect the weakness of the other; and the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton is as justlychargeable to the upholders of the slave system, as drunkenness is chargeable onthose who, by precept and example, or by indifference, uphold the drinkingsystem."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI. “A CHANGE CAME O’ER THE SPIRIT OF MY DREAM”HOW I LEARNED TO READ—MY MISTRESS—HER SLAVEHOLDING DUTIES—THEIRDEPLORABLE EFFECTS UPON HER ORIGINALLY NOBLE NATURE—THE CONFLICT IN HERMIND—HER FINAL OPPOSITION TO MY LEARNING TO READ—TOO LATE—SHE HADGIVEN ME THE INCH, I WAS RESOLVED TO TAKE THE ELL—HOW I PURSUEDMY EDUCATION—MY TUTORS—HOW I COMPENSATED THEM—WHAT PROGRESS IMADE—SLAVERY—WHAT I HEARD SAID ABOUT IT—THIRTEEN YEARS OLD—THEColumbian Orator—A RICH SCENE—A DIALOGUE—SPEECHES OF CHATHAM,SHERIDAN, PITT AND FOX—KNOWLEDGE EVER INCREASING—MY EYESOPENED—LIBERTY—HOW I PINED FOR IT—MY SADNESS—THE DISSATISFACTION OFMY POOR MISTRESS—MY HATRED OF SLAVERY—ONE UPAS TREE OVERSHADOWED USBOTH.I lived in the family of Master Hugh, at Baltimore, seven years, during whichtime—as the almanac makers say of the weather—my condition was variable. Themost interesting feature of my history here, was my learning to read and write,under somewhat marked disadvantages. In attaining this knowledge, I wascompelled to resort to indirections by no means congenial to my nature, andwhich were really humiliating to me. My mistress—who, as the reader has alreadyseen, had begun to teach me was suddenly checked in her benevolent design, bythe strong advice of her husband. In faithful compliance with this advice, thegood lady had not only ceased to instruct me, herself, but had set her face as aflint against my learning to read by any means. It is due, however, to mymistress to say, that she did not adopt this course in all its stringency at thefirst. She either thought it unnecessary, or she lacked the depravityindispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness. It was, at least, necessaryfor her to have some training, and some hardening, in the exercise of theslaveholder’s prerogative, to make her equal to forgetting my human nature andcharacter, and to treating me as a thing destitute of a moral or an intellectualnature. Mrs. Auld—my mistress—was, as I have said, a most kind andtender-hearted woman; and, in the humanity of her heart, and the simplicity ofher mind, she set out, when I first went to live with her, to treat me as shesupposed one human being ought to treat another.It is easy to see, that, in entering upon the duties of a slaveholder, somelittle experience is needed. Nature has done almost nothing to prepare men andwomen to be either slaves or slaveholders. Nothing but rigid training, longpersisted in, can perfect the character of the one or the other. One cannoteasily forget to love freedom; and it is as hard to cease to respect thatnatural love in our fellow creatures. On entering upon the career of aslaveholding mistress, Mrs. Auld was singularly deficient; nature, which fitsnobody for such an office, had done less for her than any lady I had known. Itwas no easy matter to induce her to think and to feel that the curly-headed boy,who stood by her side, and even leaned on her lap; who was loved by littleTommy, and who loved little Tommy in turn; sustained to her only the relation ofa chattel. I was more than that, and she felt me to be more than that. I couldtalk and sing; I could laugh and weep; I could reason and remember; I could loveand hate. I was human, and she, dear lady, knew and felt me to be so. How couldshe, then, treat me as a brute, without a mighty struggle with all the noblepowers of her own soul. That struggle came, and the will and power of thehusband was victorious. Her noble soul was overthrown; but, he that overthrew itdid not, himself, escape the consequences. He, not less than the other parties,was injured in his domestic peace by the fall.When I went into their family, it was the abode of happiness and contentment.The mistress of the house was a model of affection and tenderness. Her ferventpiety and watchful uprightness made it impossible to see her without thinkingand feeling—“that woman is a Christian.” There was no sorrow nor suffering forwhich she had not a tear, and there was no innocent joy for which she did not asmile. She had bread for the hungry, clothes for the naked, and comfort forevery mourner that came within her reach. Slavery soon proved its ability todivest her of these excellent qualities, and her home of its early happiness.Conscience cannot stand much violence. Once thoroughly broken down, who is hethat can repair the damage? It may be broken toward the slave, on Sunday, andtoward the master on Monday. It cannot endure such shocks. It must stand entire,or it does not stand at all. If my condition waxed bad, that of the family waxednot better. The first step, in the wrong direction, was the violence done tonature and to conscience, in arresting the benevolence that would haveenlightened my young mind. In ceasing to instruct me, she must begin to justifyherself to herself; and, once consenting to take sides in such a debate, she wasriveted to her position. One needs very little knowledge of moral philosophy, tosee where my mistress now landed. She finally became even more violent in heropposition to my learning to read, than was her husband himself. She was notsatisfied with simply doing as well as her husband had commanded her, but seemedresolved to better his instruction. Nothing appeared to make my poormistress—after her turning toward the downward path—more angry, than seeing me,seated in some nook or corner, quietly reading a book or a newspaper. I have hadher rush at me, with the utmost fury, and snatch from my hand such newspaper orbook, with something of the wrath and consternation which a traitor might besupposed to feel on being discovered in a plot by some dangerous spy.Mrs. Auld was an apt woman, and the advice of her husband, and her ownexperience, soon demonstrated, to her entire satisfaction, that education andslavery are incompatible with each other. When this conviction was thoroughlyestablished, I was most narrowly watched in all my movements. If I remained in aseparate room from the family for any considerable length of time, I was sure tobe suspected of having a book, and was at once called upon to give an account ofmyself. All this, however, was entirely too late. The first, and never to beretraced, step had been taken. In teaching me the alphabet, in the days of hersimplicity and kindness, my mistress had given me the “inch,” and now, noordinary precaution could prevent me from taking the “ell.”Seized with a determination to learn to read, at any cost, I hit upon manyexpedients to accomplish the desired end. The plea which I mainly adopted, andthe one by which I was most successful, was that of using my young whiteplaymates, with whom I met in the streets as teachers. I used to carry, almostconstantly, a copy of Webster’s spelling book in my pocket; and, when sent oferrands, or when play time was allowed me, I would step, with my young friends,aside, and take a lesson in spelling. I generally paid my tuition fee to theboys, with bread, which I also carried in my pocket. For a single biscuit, anyof my hungry little comrades would give me a lesson more valuable to me thanbread. Not every one, however, demanded this consideration, for there were thosewho took pleasure in teaching me, whenever I had a chance to be taught by them.I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three of those little boys, asa slight testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them, but prudenceforbids; not that it would injure me, but it might, possibly, embarrass them;for it is almost an unpardonable offense to do any thing, directly orindirectly, to promote a slave’s freedom, in a slave state. It is enough to say,of my warm-hearted little play fellows, that they lived on Philpot street, verynear Durgin & Bailey’s shipyard.Although slavery was a delicate subject, and very cautiously talked about amonggrown up people in Maryland, I frequently talked about it—and that veryfreely—with the white boys. I would, sometimes, say to them, while seated on acurb stone or a cellar door, “I wish I could be free, as you will be when youget to be men.” “You will be free, you know, as soon as you are twenty-one, andcan go where you like, but I am a slave for life. Have I not as good a right tobe free as you have?” Words like these, I observed, always troubled them; and Ihad no small satisfaction in wringing from the boys, occasionally, that freshand bitter condemnation of slavery, that springs from nature, unseared andunperverted. Of all consciences let me have those to deal with which have notbeen bewildered by the cares of life. I do not remember ever to have met with aboy, while I was in slavery, who defended the slave system; but I have often hadboys to console me, with the hope that something would yet occur, by which Imight be made free. Over and over again, they have told me, that “they believedI had as good a right to be free as they had;” and that “they did not believeGod ever made any one to be a slave.” The reader will easily see, that suchlittle conversations with my play fellows, had no tendency to weaken my love ofliberty, nor to render me contented with my condition as a slave.When I was about thirteen years old, and had succeeded in learning to read,every increase of knowledge, especially respecting the FREE STATES, addedsomething to the almost intolerable burden of the thought—I AM A SLAVE FOR LIFE.To my bondage I saw no end. It was a terrible reality, and I shall never be ableto tell how sadly that thought chafed my young spirit. Fortunately, orunfortunately, about this time in my life, I had made enough money to buy whatwas then a very popular school book, viz: the Columbian Orator. I bought thisaddition to my library, of Mr. Knight, on Thames street, Fell’s Point,Baltimore, and paid him fifty cents for it. I was first led to buy this book, byhearing some little boys say they were going to learn some little pieces out ofit for the Exhibition. This volume was, indeed, a rich treasure, and everyopportunity afforded me, for a time, was spent in diligently perusing it. Amongmuch other interesting matter, that which I had perused and reperused withunflagging satisfaction, was a short dialogue between a master and his slave.The slave is represented as having been recaptured, in a second attempt to runaway; and the master opens the dialogue with an upbraiding speech, charging theslave with ingratitude, and demanding to know what he has to say in his owndefense. Thus upbraided, and thus called upon to reply, the slave rejoins, thathe knows how little anything that he can say will avail, seeing that he iscompletely in the hands of his owner; and with noble resolution, calmly says, “Isubmit to my fate.” Touched by the slave’s answer, the master insists upon hisfurther speaking, and recapitulates the many acts of kindness which he hasperformed toward the slave, and tells him he is permitted to speak for himself.Thus invited to the debate, the quondam slave made a spirited defense ofhimself, and thereafter the whole argument, for and against slavery, was broughtout. The master was vanquished at every turn in the argument; and seeing himselfto be thus vanquished, he generously and meekly emancipates the slave, with hisbest wishes for his prosperity. It is scarcely neccessary(sic) to say, that adialogue, with such an origin, and such an ending—read when the fact of my beinga slave was a constant burden of grief—powerfully affected me; and I could nothelp feeling that the day might come, when the well-directed answers made by theslave to the master, in this instance, would find their counterpart in myself.This, however, was not all the fanaticism which I found in this ColumbianOrator. I met there one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches, on the subject ofCatholic Emancipation, Lord Chatham’s speech on the American war, and speechesby the great William Pitt and by Fox. These were all choice documents to me, andI read them, over and over again, with an interest that was ever increasing,because it was ever gaining in intelligence; for the more I read them, thebetter I understood them. The reading of these speeches added much to my limitedstock of language, and enabled me to give tongue to many interesting thoughts,which had frequently flashed through my soul, and died away for want ofutterance. The mighty power and heart-searching directness of truth, penetratingeven the heart of a slaveholder, compelling him to yield up his earthlyinterests to the claims of eternal justice, were finely illustrated in thedialogue, just referred to; and from the speeches of Sheridan, I got a bold andpowerful denunciation of oppression, and a most brilliant vindication of therights of man. Here was, indeed, a noble acquisition. If I ever wavered underthe consideration, that the Almighty, in some way, ordained slavery, and willedmy enslavement for his own glory, I wavered no longer. I had now penetrated thesecret of all slavery and oppression, and had ascertained their true foundationto be in the pride, the power and the avarice of man. The dialogue and thespeeches were all redolent of the principles of liberty, and poured floods oflight on the nature and character of slavery. With a book of this kind in myhand, my own human nature, and the facts of my experience, to help me, I wasequal to a contest with the religious advocates of slavery, whether among thewhites or among the colored people, for blindness, in this matter, is notconfined to the former. I have met many religious colored people, at the south,who are under the delusion that God requires them to submit to slavery, and towear their chains with meekness and humility. I could entertain no such nonsenseas this; and I almost lost my patience when I found any colored man weak enoughto believe such stuff. Nevertheless, the increase of knowledge was attended withbitter, as well as sweet results. The more I read, the more I was led to abhorand detest slavery, and my enslavers. “Slaveholders,” thought I, “are only aband of successful robbers, who left their homes and went into Africa for thepurpose of stealing and reducing my people to slavery.” I loathed them as themeanest and the most wicked of men. As I read, behold! the very discontent sographically pre dicted by Master Hugh, had already come upon me. I was no longerthe light-hearted, gleesome boy, full of mirth and play, as when I landed firstat Baltimore. Knowledge had come; light had penetrated the moral dungeon where Idwelt; and, behold! there lay the bloody whip, for my back, and here was theiron chain; and my good, kind master, he was the author of my situation. Therevelation haunted me, stung me, and made me gloomy and miserable. As I writhedunder the sting and torment of this knowledge, I almost envied my fellow slavestheir stupid contentment. This knowledge opened my eyes to the horrible pit, andrevealed the teeth of the frightful dragon that was ready to pounce upon me, butit opened no way for my escape. I have often wished myself a beast, or abird—anything, rather than a slave. I was wretched and gloomy, beyond my abilityto describe. I was too thoughtful to be happy. It was this everlasting thinkingwhich distressed and tormented me; and yet there was no getting rid of thesubject of my thoughts. All nature was redolent of it. Once awakened by thesilver trump of knowledge, my spirit was roused to eternal wakefulness. Liberty!the inestimable birthright of every man, had, for me, converted every objectinto an asserter of this great right. It was heard in every sound, and beheld inevery object. It was ever present, to torment me with a sense of my wretchedcondition. The more beautiful and charming were the smiles of nature, the morehorrible and desolate was my condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, and Iheard nothing without hearing it. I do not exaggerate, when I say, that itlooked from every star, smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and movedin every storm.I have no doubt that my state of mind had something to do with the change in thetreatment adopted, by my once kind mistress toward me. I can easily believe,that my leaden, downcast, and discontented look, was very offensive to her. Poorlady! She did not know my trouble, and I dared not tell her. Could I have freelymade her acquainted with the real state of my mind, and given her the reasonstherefor, it might have been well for both of us. Her abuse of me fell upon melike the blows of the false prophet upon his ass; she did not know that an angelstood in the way; and—such is the relation of master and slave I could not tellher. Nature had made us friends; slavery made us enemies. My interests were in adirection opposite to hers, and we both had our private thoughts and plans. Sheaimed to keep me ignorant; and I resolved to know, although knowledge onlyincreased my discontent. My feelings were not the result of any marked crueltyin the treatment I received; they sprung from the consideration of my being aslave at all. It was slavery—not its mere incidents—that I hated. I had beencheated. I saw through the attempt to keep me in ignorance; I saw thatslaveholders would have gladly made me believe that they were merely actingunder the authority of God, in making a slave of me, and in making slaves ofothers; and I treated them as robbers and deceivers. The feeding and clothing mewell, could not atone for taking my liberty from me. The smiles of my mistresscould not remove the deep sorrow that dwelt in my young bosom. Indeed, these, intime, came only to deepen my sorrow. She had changed; and the reader will seethat I had changed, too. We were both victims to the same overshadowingevil—she, as mistress, I, as slave. I will not censure her harshly; she cannotcensure me, for she knows I speak but the truth, and have acted in my oppositionto slavery, just as she herself would have acted, in a reverse of circumstances.CHAPTER XII. RELIGIOUS NATURE AWAKENEDABOLITIONISTS SPOKEN OF—MY EAGERNESS TO KNOW WHAT THIS WORD MEANT—MYCONSULTATION OF THE DICTIONARY—INCENDIARY INFORMATION—HOW AND WHEREDERIVED—THE ENIGMA SOLVED—NATHANIEL TURNER’S INSURRECTION—THECHOLERA—RELIGION—FIRST AWAKENED BY A METHODIST MINISTER NAMEDHANSON—MY DEAR AND GOOD OLD COLORED FRIEND, LAWSON—HIS CHARACTER ANDOCCUPATION—HIS INFLUENCE OVER ME—OUR MUTUAL ATTACHMENT—THE COMFORTI DERIVED FROM HIS TEACHING—NEW HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS—HEAVENLYLIGHT AMIDST EARTHLY DARKNESS—THE TWO IRISHMEN ON THE WHARF—THEIRCONVERSATION—HOW I LEARNED TO WRITE—WHAT WERE MY AIMS.Whilst in the painful state of mind described in the foregoing chapter, almostregretting my very existence, because doomed to a life of bondage, so goaded andso wretched, at times, that I was even tempted to destroy my own life, I waskeenly sensitive and eager to know any, and every thing that transpired, havingany relation to the subject of slavery. I was all ears, all eyes, whenever thewords slave, slavery, dropped from the lips of any white person, and theoccasions were not unfrequent when these words became leading ones, in high,social debate, at our house. Every little while, I could hear Master Hugh, orsome of his company, speaking with much warmth and excitement about“abolitionists.” Of who or what these were, I was totally ignorant. I found,however, that whatever they might be, they were most cordially hated and soundlyabused by slaveholders, of every grade. I very soon discovered, too, thatslavery was, in some sort, under consideration, whenever the abolitionists werealluded to. This made the term a very interesting one to me. If a slave, forinstance, had made good his escape from slavery, it was generally alleged, thathe had been persuaded and assisted by the abolitionists. If, also, a slavekilled his master—as was sometimes the case—or struck down his overseer, or setfire to his master’s dwelling, or committed any violence or crime, out of thecommon way, it was certain to be said, that such a crime was the legitimatefruits of the abolition movement. Hearing such charges often repeated, I,naturally enough, received the impression that abolition—whatever else it mightbe—could not be unfriendly to the slave, nor very friendly to the slaveholder. Itherefore set about finding out, if possible, who and what the abolitionistswere, and why they were so obnoxious to the slaveholders. The dictionaryafforded me very little help. It taught me that abolition was the “act ofabolishing;” but it left me in ignorance at the very point where I most wantedinformation—and that was, as to the thing to be abolished. A city newspaper, theBaltimore American, gave me the incendiary information denied me by thedictionary. In its columns I found, that, on a certain day, a vast number ofpetitions and memorials had been presented to congress, praying for theabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and for the abolition of theslave trade between the states of the Union. This was enough. The vindictivebitterness, the marked caution, the studied reverse, and the cumbrous ambiguity,practiced by our white folks, when alluding to this subject, was now fullyexplained. Ever, after that, when I heard the words “abolition,” or “abolitionmovement,” mentioned, I felt the matter one of a personal concern; and I drewnear to listen, when I could do so, without seeming too solicitous and prying.There was HOPE in those words. Ever and anon, too, I could see some terribledenunciation of slavery, in our papers—copied from abolition papers at thenorth—and the injustice of such denunciation commented on. These I read withavidity. I had a deep satisfaction in the thought, that the rascality ofslaveholders was not concealed from the eyes of the world, and that I was notalone in abhorring the cruelty and brutality of slavery. A still deeper train ofthought was stirred. I saw that there was fear, as well as rage, in the mannerof speaking of the abolitionists. The latter, therefore, I was compelled toregard as having some power in the country; and I felt that they might,possibly, succeed in their designs. When I met with a slave to whom I deemed itsafe to talk on the subject, I would impart to him so much of the mystery as Ihad been able to penetrate. Thus, the light of this grand movement broke in uponmy mind, by degrees; and I must say, that, ignorant as I then was of thephilosophy of that movement, I believe in it from the first—and I believed init, partly, because I saw that it alarmed the consciences of slaveholders. Theinsurrection of Nathaniel Turner had been quelled, but the alarm and terror hadnot subsided. The cholera was on its way, and the thought was present, that Godwas angry with the white people because of their slaveholding wickedness, and,therefore, his judgments were abroad in the land. It was impossible for me notto hope much from the abolition movement, when I saw it supported by theAlmighty, and armed with DEATH!Previous to my contemplation of the anti-slavery movement, and its probableresults, my mind had been seriously awakened to the subject of religion. I wasnot more than thirteen years old, when I felt the need of God, as a father andprotector. My religious nature was awakened by the preaching of a whiteMethodist minister, named Hanson. He thought that all men, great and small, bondand free, were sinners in the sight of God; that they were, by nature, rebelsagainst His government; and that they must repent of their sins, and bereconciled to God, through Christ. I cannot say that I had a very distinctnotion of what was required of me; but one thing I knew very well—I waswretched, and had no means of making myself otherwise. Moreover, I knew that Icould pray for light. I consulted a good colored man, named Charles Johnson;and, in tones of holy affection, he told me to pray, and what to pray for. Iwas, for weeks, a poor, brokenhearted mourner, traveling through the darknessand misery of doubts and fears. I finally found that change of heart which comesby “casting all one’s care” upon God, and by having faith in Jesus Christ, asthe Redeemer, Friend, and Savior of those who diligently seek Him.After this, I saw the world in a new light. I seemed to live in a new world,surrounded by new objects, and to be animated by new hopes and desires. I lovedall mankind—slaveholders not excepted; though I abhorred slavery more than ever.My great concern was, now, to have the world converted. The desire for knowledgeincreased, and especially did I want a thorough acquaintance with the contentsof the bible. I have gathered scattered pages from this holy book, from thefilthy street gutters of Baltimore, and washed and dried them, that in themoments of my leisure, I might get a word or two of wisdom from them. While thusreligiously seeking knowledge, I became acquainted with a good old colored man,named Lawson. A more devout man than he, I never saw. He drove a dray for Mr.James Ramsey, the owner of a rope-walk on Fell’s Point, Baltimore. This man notonly prayed three time a day, but he prayed as he walked through the streets, athis work—on his dray everywhere. His life was a life of prayer, and his words(when he spoke to his friends,) were about a better world. Uncle Lawson livednear Master Hugh’s house; and, becoming deeply attached to the old man, I wentoften with him to prayer-meeting, and spent much of my leisure time with him onSunday. The old man could read a little, and I was a great help to him, inmaking out the hard words, for I was a better reader than he. I could teach him“the letter,” but he could teach me “the spirit;” and high, refreshing times wehad together, in singing, praying and glorifying God. These meetings with UncleLawson went on for a long time, without the knowledge of Master Hugh or mymistress. Both knew, how ever, that I had become religious, and they seemed torespect my conscientious piety. My mistress was still a professor of religion,and belonged to class. Her leader was no less a person than the Rev. BeverlyWaugh, the presiding elder, and now one of the bishops of the MethodistEpiscopal church. Mr. Waugh was then stationed over Wilk street church. I amcareful to state these facts, that the reader may be able to form an idea of theprecise influences which had to do with shaping and directing my mind.In view of the cares and anxieties incident to the life she was then leading,and, especially, in view of the separation from religious associations to whichshe was subjected, my mistress had, as I have before stated, become lukewarm,and needed to be looked up by her leader. This brought Mr. Waugh to our house,and gave me an opportunity to hear him exhort and pray. But my chief instructor,in matters of religion, was Uncle Lawson. He was my spiritual father; and Iloved him intensely, and was at his house every chance I got.This pleasure was not long allowed me. Master Hugh became averse to my going toFather Lawson’s, and threatened to whip me if I ever went there again. I nowfelt myself persecuted by a wicked man; and I would go to Father Lawson’s,notwithstanding the threat. The good old man had told me, that the “Lord had agreat work for me to do;” and I must prepare to do it; and that he had beenshown that I must preach the gospel. His words made a deep impression on mymind, and I verily felt that some such work was before me, though I could notsee how I should ever engage in its performance. “The good Lord,” he said,“would bring it to pass in his own good time,” and that I must go on reading andstudying the scriptures. The advice and the suggestions of Uncle Lawson, werenot without their influence upon my character and destiny. He threw my thoughtsinto a channel from which they have never entirely diverged. He fanned myalready intense love of knowledge into a flame, by assuring me that I was to bea useful man in the world. When I would say to him, “How can these things be andwhat can I do?” his simple reply was, “Trust in the Lord.” When I told him that“I was a slave, and a slave FOR LIFE,” he said, “the Lord can make you free, mydear. All things are possible with him, only have faith in God.” “Ask, and itshall be given.” “If you want liberty,” said the good old man, “ask the Lord forit, in faith, AND HE WILL GIVE IT TO YOU.”Thus assured, and cheered on, under the inspiration of hope, I worked and prayedwith a light heart, believing that my life was under the guidance of a wisdomhigher than my own. With all other blessings sought at the mercy seat, I alwaysprayed that God would, of His great mercy, and in His own good time, deliver mefrom my bondage.I went, one day, on the wharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading alarge scow of stone, or ballast I went on board, unasked, and helped them. Whenwe had finished the work, one of the men came to me, aside, and asked me anumber of questions, and among them, if I were a slave. I told him “I was aslave, and a slave for life.” The good Irishman gave his shoulders a shrug, andseemed deeply affected by the statement. He said, “it was a pity so fine alittle fellow as myself should be a slave for life.” They both had much to sayabout the matter, and expressed the deepest sympathy with me, and the mostdecided hatred of slavery. They went so far as to tell me that I ought to runaway, and go to the north; that I should find friends there, and that I would beas free as anybody. I, however, pretended not to be interested in what theysaid, for I feared they might be treacherous. White men have been known toencourage slaves to escape, and then—to get the reward—they have kidnapped them,and returned them to their masters. And while I mainly inclined to the notionthat these men were honest and meant me no ill, I feared it might be otherwise.I nevertheless remembered their words and their advice, and looked forward to anescape to the north, as a possible means of gaining the liberty for which myheart panted. It was not my enslavement, at the then present time, that mostaffected me; the being a slave for life, was the saddest thought. I was tooyoung to think of running away immediately; besides, I wished to learn how towrite, before going, as I might have occasion to write my own pass. I now notonly had the hope of freedom, but a foreshadowing of the means by which I might,some day, gain that inestimable boon. Meanwhile, I resolved to add to myeducational attainments the art of writing.After this manner I began to learn to write: I was much in the ship yard—MasterHugh’s, and that of Durgan & Bailey—and I observed that the carpenters, afterhewing and getting a piece of timber ready for use, wrote on it the initials ofthe name of that part of the ship for which it was intended. When, for instance,a piece of timber was ready for the starboard side, it was marked with a capital“S.” A piece for the larboard side was marked “L;” larboard forward, “L. F.;”larboard aft, was marked “L. A.;” starboard aft, “S. A.;” and starboard forward“S. F.” I soon learned these letters, and for what they were placed on thetimbers.My work was now, to keep fire under the steam box, and to watch the ship yardwhile the carpenters had gone to dinner. This interval gave me a fineopportunity for copying the letters named. I soon astonished myself with theease with which I made the letters; and the thought was soon present, “if I canmake four, I can make more.” But having made these easily, when I met boys aboutBethel church, or any of our play-grounds, I entered the lists with them in theart of writing, and would make the letters which I had been so fortunate as tolearn, and ask them to “beat that if they could.” With playmates for myteachers, fences and pavements for my copy books, and chalk for my pen and ink,I learned the art of writing. I, however, afterward adopted various methods ofimproving my hand. The most successful, was copying the italics in Webster’sspelling book, until I could make them all without looking on the book. By thistime, my little “Master Tommy” had grown to be a big boy, and had written over anumber of copy books, and brought them home. They had been shown to theneighbors, had elicited due praise, and were now laid carefully away. Spendingmy time between the ship yard and house, I was as often the lone keeper of thelatter as of the former. When my mistress left me in charge of the house, I hada grand time; I got Master Tommy’s copy books and a pen and ink, and, in theample spaces between the lines, I wrote other lines, as nearly like his aspossible. The process was a tedious one, and I ran the risk of getting aflogging for marring the highly prized copy books of the oldest son. In additionto those opportunities, sleeping, as I did, in the kitchen loft—a room seldomvisited by any of the family—I got a flour barrel up there, and a chair; andupon the head of that barrel I have written (or endeavored to write) copyingfrom the bible and the Methodist hymn book, and other books which hadaccumulated on my hands, till late at night, and when all the family were in bedand asleep. I was supported in my endeavors by renewed advice, and by holypromises from the good Father Lawson, with whom I continued to meet, and pray,and read the scriptures. Although Master Hugh was aware of my going there, Imust say, for his credit, that he never executed his threat to whip me, forhaving thus, innocently, employed-my leisure time.CHAPTER XIII. THE VICISSITUDES OF SLAVE LIFEDEATH OF OLD MASTER’S SON RICHARD, SPEEDILY FOLLOWED BY THAT OF OLDMASTER—VALUATION AND DIVISION OF ALL THE PROPERTY, INCLUDING THESLAVES—MY PRESENCE REQUIRED AT HILLSBOROUGH TO BE APPRAISED ANDALLOTTED TO A NEW OWNER—MY SAD PROSPECTS AND GRIEF—PARTING—THE UTTERPOWERLESSNESS OF THE SLAVES TO DECIDE THEIR OWN DESTINY—A GENERALDREAD OF MASTER ANDREW—HIS WICKEDNESS AND CRUELTY—MISS LUCRETIA MY NEWOWNER—MY RETURN TO BALTIMORE—JOY UNDER THE ROOF OF MASTER HUGH—DEATHOF MRS. LUCRETIA—MY POOR OLD GRANDMOTHER—HER SAD FATE—THE LONE COTIN THE WOODS—MASTER THOMAS AULD’S SECOND MARRIAGE—AGAIN REMOVED FROMMASTER HUGH’S—REASONS FOR REGRETTING THE CHANGE—A PLAN OF ESCAPEENTERTAINED.I must now ask the reader to go with me a little back in point of time, in myhumble story, and to notice another circumstance that entered into my slaveryexperience, and which, doubtless, has had a share in deepening my horror ofslavery, and increasing my hostility toward those men and measures thatpractically uphold the slave system.It has already been observed, that though I was, after my removal from Col.Lloyd’s plantation, in form the slave of Master Hugh, I was, in fact, and inlaw, the slave of my old master, Capt. Anthony. Very well.In a very short time after I went to Baltimore, my old master’s youngest son,Richard, died; and, in three years and six months after his death, my old masterhimself died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and his daughter, Lucretia, to sharehis estate. The old man died while on a visit to his daughter, in Hillsborough,where Capt. Auld and Mrs. Lucretia now lived. The former, having given up thecommand of Col. Lloyd’s sloop, was now keeping a store in that town.Cut off, thus unexpectedly, Capt. Anthony died intestate; and his property mustnow be equally divided between his two children, Andrew and Lucretia.The valuation and the division of slaves, among contending heirs, is animportant incident in slave life. The character and tendencies of the heirs, aregenerally well understood among the slaves who are to be divided, and all havetheir aversions and preferences. But, neither their aversions nor theirpreferences avail them anything.On the death of old master, I was immediately sent for, to be valued and dividedwith the other property. Personally, my concern was, mainly, about my possibleremoval from the home of Master Hugh, which, after that of my grandmother, wasthe most endeared to me. But, the whole thing, as a feature of slavery, shockedme. It furnished me anew insight into the unnatural power to which I wassubjected. My detestation of slavery, already great, rose with this newconception of its enormity.That was a sad day for me, a sad day for little Tommy, and a sad day for my dearBaltimore mistress and teacher, when I left for the Eastern Shore, to be valuedand divided. We, all three, wept bitterly that day; for we might be parting, andwe feared we were parting, forever. No one could tell among which pile ofchattels I should be flung. Thus early, I got a foretaste of that painfuluncertainty which slavery brings to the ordinary lot of mortals. Sickness,adversity and death may interfere with the plans and purposes of all; but theslave has the added danger of changing homes, changing hands, and of havingseparations unknown to other men. Then, too, there was the intensifieddegradation of the spectacle. What an assemblage! Men and women, young and old,married and single; moral and intellectual beings, in open contempt of theirhumanity, level at a blow with horses, sheep, horned cattle and swine! Horsesand men—cattle and women—pigs and children—all holding the same rank in thescale of social existence; and all subjected to the same narrow inspection, toascertain their value in gold and silver—the only standard of worth applied byslaveholders to slaves! How vividly, at that moment, did the brutalizing powerof slavery flash before me! Personality swallowed up in the sordid idea ofproperty! Manhood lost in chattelhood!After the valuation, then came the division. This was an hour of high excitementand distressing anxiety. Our destiny was now to be fixed for life, and we had nomore voice in the decision of the question, than the oxen and cows that stoodchewing at the haymow. One word from the appraisers, against all preferences orprayers, was enough to sunder all the ties of friendship and affection, and evento separate husbands and wives, parents and children. We were all appalledbefore that power, which, to human seeming, could bless or blast us in a moment.Added to the dread of separation, most painful to the majority of the slaves, weall had a decided horror of the thought of falling into the hands of MasterAndrew. He was distinguished for cruelty and intemperance.Slaves generally dread to fall into the hands of drunken owners. Master Andrewwas almost a confirmed sot, and had already, by his reckless mismanagement andprofligate dissipation, wasted a large portion of old master’s property. To fallinto his hands, was, therefore, considered merely as the first step toward beingsold away to the far south. He would spend his fortune in a few years, and hisfarms and slaves would be sold, we thought, at public outcry; and we should behurried away to the cotton fields, and rice swamps, of the sunny south. This wasthe cause of deep consternation.The people of the north, and free people generally, I think, have lessattachment to the places where they are born and brought up, than have theslaves. Their freedom to go and come, to be here and there, as they list,prevents any extravagant attachment to any one particular place, in their case.On the other hand, the slave is a fixture; he has no choice, no goal, nodestination; but is pegged down to a single spot, and must take root here, ornowhere. The idea of removal elsewhere, comes, generally, in the shape of athreat, and in punishment of crime. It is, therefore, attended with fear anddread. A slave seldom thinks of bettering his condition by being sold, and hencehe looks upon separation from his native place, with none of the enthusiasmwhich animates the bosoms of young freemen, when they contemplate a life in thefar west, or in some distant country where they intend to rise to wealth anddistinction. Nor can those from whom they separate, give them up with thatcheerfulness with which friends and relations yield each other up, when theyfeel that it is for the good of the departing one that he is removed from hisnative place. Then, too, there is correspondence, and there is, at least, thehope of reunion, because reunion is possible. But, with the slave, all thesemitigating circumstances are wanting. There is no improvement in his conditionprobable,—no correspondence possible,—no reunion attainable. His going out intothe world, is like a living man going into the tomb, who, with open eyes, seeshimself buried out of sight and hearing of wife, children and friends of kindredtie.In contemplating the likelihoods and possibilities of our circumstances, Iprobably suffered more than most of my fellow servants. I had known what it wasto experience kind, and even tender treatment; they had known nothing of thesort. Life, to them, had been rough and thorny, as well as dark. They had—mostof them—lived on my old master’s farm in Tuckahoe, and had felt the reign of Mr.Plummer’s rule. The overseer had written his character on the living parchmentof most of their backs, and left them callous; my back (thanks to my earlyremoval from the plantation to Baltimore) was yet tender. I had left a kindmistress at Baltimore, who was almost a mother to me. She was in tears when weparted, and the probabilities of ever seeing her again, trembling in the balanceas they did, could not be viewed without alarm and agony. The thought of leavingthat kind mistress forever, and, worse still, of being the slave of AndrewAnthony—a man who, but a few days before the division of the property, had, inmy presence, seized my brother Perry by the throat, dashed him on the ground,and with the heel of his boot stamped him on the head, until the blood gushedfrom his nose and ears—was terrible! This fiendish proceeding had no betterapology than the fact, that Perry had gone to play, when Master Andrew wantedhim for some trifling service. This cruelty, too, was of a piece with hisgeneral character. After inflicting his heavy blows on my brother, on observingme looking at him with intense astonishment, he said, “That is the way I willserve you, one of these days;” meaning, no doubt, when I should come into hispossession. This threat, the reader may well suppose, was not very tranquilizingto my feelings. I could see that he really thirsted to get hold of me. But I wasthere only for a few days. I had not received any orders, and had violated none,and there was, therefore, no excuse for flogging me.At last, the anxiety and suspense were ended; and they ended, thanks to a kindProvidence, in accordance with my wishes. I fell to the portion of Mrs.Lucretia—the dear lady who bound up my head, when the savage Aunt Katy wasadding to my sufferings her bitterest maledictions.Capt. Thomas Auld and Mrs. Lucretia at once decided on my return to Baltimore.They knew how sincerely and warmly Mrs. Hugh Auld was attached to me, and howdelighted Mr. Hugh’s son would be to have me back; and, withal, having noimmediate use for one so young, they willingly let me off to Baltimore.I need not stop here to narrate my joy on returning to Baltimore, nor that oflittle Tommy; nor the tearful joy of his mother; nor the evidentsaticfaction(sic) of Master Hugh. I was just one month absent from Baltimore,before the matter was decided; and the time really seemed full six months.One trouble over, and on comes another. The slave’s life is full of uncertainty.I had returned to Baltimore but a short time, when the tidings reached me, thatmy friend, Mrs. Lucretia, who was only second in my regard to Mrs. Hugh Auld,was dead, leaving her husband and only one child—a daughter, named Amanda.Shortly after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, strange to say, Master Andrew died,leaving his wife and one child. Thus, the whole family of Anthonys was sweptaway; only two children remained. All this happened within five years of myleaving Col. Lloyd’s.No alteration took place in the condition of the slaves, in consequence of thesedeaths, yet I could not help feeling less secure, after the death of my friend,Mrs. Lucretia, than I had done during her life. While she lived, I felt that Ihad a strong friend to plead for me in any emergency. Ten years ago, whilespeaking of the state of things in our family, after the events just named, Iused this language:Now all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in the hands ofstrangers—strangers who had nothing to do in accumulating it. Not a slave wasleft free. All remained slaves, from youngest to oldest. If any one thing in myexperience, more than another, served to deepen my conviction of the infernalcharacter of slavery, and to fill me with unutterable loathing of slaveholders,it was their base ingratitude to my poor old grandmother. She had served my oldmaster faithfully from youth to old age. She had been the source of all hiswealth; she had peopled his plantation with slaves; she had become agreat-grandmother in his service. She had rocked him in infancy, attended him inchildhood, served him through life, and at his death wiped from his icy brow thecold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. She was nevertheless left aslave—a slave for life—a slave in the hands of strangers; and in their hands shesaw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, likeso many sheep, without being gratified with the small privilege of a singleword, as to their or her own destiny. And, to cap the climax of their baseingratitude and fiendish barbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, havingoutlived my old master and all his children, having seen the beginning and endof all of them, and her present owners finding she was of but little value, herframe already racked with the pains of old age, and complete helplessness faststealing over her once active limbs, they took her to the woods, built her alittle hut, put up a little mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to theprivilege of supporting herself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtuallyturning her out to die! If my poor old grandmother now lives, she lives tosuffer in utter loneliness; she lives to remember and mourn over the loss ofchildren, the loss of grandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren. Theyare, in the language of the slave’s poet, Whittier—"},{"pageContent":" Gone, gone, sold and gone, To the rice swamp dank and lone, Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings, Where the noisome insect stings, Where the fever-demon strews Poison with the falling dews, Where the sickly sunbeams glare Through the hot and misty air:— Gone, gone, sold and gone To the rice swamp dank and lone, From Virginia hills and waters— Woe is me, my stolen daughters!The hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who once sangand danced in her presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in the darkness ofage, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices of her children, she hears byday the moans of the dove, and by night the screams of the hideous owl. All isgloom. The grave is at the door. And now, when weighed down by the pains andaches of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the beginning andending of human existence meet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combinetogether—at this time, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of thattenderness and affection which children only can exercise toward a decliningparent—my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve children, is leftall alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers.Two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married his secondwife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton, the eldest daughter of Mr. William Hamilton,a rich slaveholder on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, who lived about five milesfrom St. Michael’s, the then place of my master’s residence.Not long after his marriage, Master Thomas had a misunderstanding with MasterHugh, and, as a means of punishing his brother, he ordered him to send me home.As the ground of misunderstanding will serve to illustrate the character ofsouthern chivalry, and humanity, I will relate it.Among the children of my Aunt Milly, was a daughter, named Henny. When quite achild, Henny had fallen into the fire, and burnt her hands so bad that they wereof very little use to her. Her fingers were drawn almost into the palms of herhands. She could make out to do something, but she was considered hardly worththe having—of little more value than a horse with a broken leg. Thisunprofitable piece of human property, ill shapen, and disfigured, Capt. Auldsent off to Baltimore, making his brother Hugh welcome to her services.After giving poor Henny a fair trial, Master Hugh and his wife came to theconclusion, that they had no use for the crippled servant, and they sent herback to Master Thomas. Thus, the latter took as an act of ingratitude, on thepart of his brother; and, as a mark of his displeasure, he required him to sendme immediately to St. Michael’s, saying, if he cannot keep “Hen,” he shall nothave “Fred.”Here was another shock to my nerves, another breaking up of my plans, andanother severance of my religious and social alliances. I was now a big boy. Ihad become quite useful to several young colored men, who had made me theirteacher. I had taught some of them to read, and was accustomed to spend many ofmy leisure hours with them. Our attachment was strong, and I greatly dreaded theseparation. But regrets, especially in a slave, are unavailing. I was only aslave; my wishes were nothing, and my happiness was the sport of my masters.My regrets at now leaving Baltimore, were not for the same reasons as when Ibefore left that city, to be valued and handed over to my proper owner. My homewas not now the pleasant place it had formerly been. A change had taken place,both in Master Hugh, and in his once pious and affectionate wife. The influenceof brandy and bad company on him, and the influence of slavery and socialisolation upon her, had wrought disastrously upon the characters of both. Thomaswas no longer “little Tommy,” but was a big boy, and had learned to assume theairs of his class toward me. My condition, therefore, in the house of MasterHugh, was not, by any means, so comfortable as in former years. My attachmentswere now outside of our family. They were felt to those to whom I impartedinstruction, and to those little white boys from whom I received instruction.There, too, was my dear old father, the pious Lawson, who was, in christiangraces, the very counterpart of “Uncle” Tom. The resemblance is so perfect, thathe might have been the original of Mrs. Stowe’s christian hero. The thought ofleaving these dear friends, greatly troubled me, for I was going without thehope of ever returning to Baltimore again; the feud between Master Hugh and hisbrother being bitter and irreconcilable, or, at least, supposed to be so.In addition to thoughts of friends from whom I was parting, as I supposed,forever, I had the grief of neglected chances of escape to brood over. I had putoff running away, until now I was to be placed where the opportunities forescaping were much fewer than in a large city like Baltimore.On my way from Baltimore to St. Michael’s, down the Chesapeake bay, oursloop—the “Amanda”—was passed by the steamers plying between that city andPhiladelphia, and I watched the course of those steamers, and, while going toSt. Michael’s, I formed a plan to escape from slavery; of which plan, andmatters connected therewith the kind reader shall learn more hereafter.CHAPTER XIV.

There were a few comfortable dwellings init, but the place, as a whole, wore a dull, slovenly, enterprise-forsakenaspect. The mass of the buildings were wood; they had never enjoyed theartificial adornment of paint, and time and storms had worn off the bright colorof the wood, leaving them almost as black as buildings charred by aconflagration.St. Michael’s had, in former years, (previous to 1833, for that was the year Iwent to reside there,) enjoyed some reputation as a ship building community, butthat business had almost entirely given place to oyster fishing, for theBaltimore and Philadelphia markets—a course of life highly unfavorable tomorals, industry, and manners. Miles river was broad, and its oyster fishinggrounds were extensive; and the fishermen were out, often, all day, and a partof the night, during autumn, winter and spring. This exposure was an excuse forcarrying with them, in considerable quanties(sic), spirituous liquors, the thensupposed best antidote for cold. Each canoe was supplied with its jug of rum;and tippling, among this class of the citizens of St. Michael’s, became general.This drinking habit, in an ignorant population, fostered coarseness, vulgarityand an indolent disregard for the social improvement of the place, so that itwas admitted, by the few sober, thinking people who remained there, that St.Michael’s had become a very unsaintly, as well as unsightly place, before I wentthere to reside.I left Baltimore for St. Michael’s in the month of March, 1833. I know the year,because it was the one succeeding the first cholera in Baltimore, and was theyear, also, of that strange phenomenon, when the heavens seemed about to partwith its starry train. I witnessed this gorgeous spectacle, and was awe-struck.The air seemed filled with bright, descending messengers from the sky. It wasabout daybreak when I saw this sublime scene. I was not without the suggestion,at the moment, that it might be the harbinger of the coming of the Son of Man;and, in my then state of mind, I was prepared to hail Him as my friend anddeliverer. I had read, that the “stars shall fall from heaven”; and they werenow falling. I was suffering much in my mind. It did seem that every time theyoung tendrils of my affection became attached, they were rudely broken by someunnatural outside power; and I was beginning to look away to heaven for the restdenied me on earth.But, to my story. It was now more than seven years since I had lived with MasterThomas Auld, in the family of my old master, on Col. Lloyd’s plantation. We werealmost entire strangers to each other; for, when I knew him at the house of myold master, it was not as a master, but simply as “Captain Auld,” who hadmarried old master’s daughter. All my lessons concerning his temper anddisposition, and the best methods of pleasing him, were yet to be learnt.Slaveholders, however, are not very ceremonious in approaching a slave; and myignorance of the new material in shape of a master was but transient. Nor was mymistress long in making known her animus. She was not a “Miss Lucretia,” tracesof whom I yet remembered, and the more especially, as I saw them shining in theface of little Amanda, her daughter, now living under a step-mother’sgovernment. I had not forgotten the soft hand, guided by a tender heart, thatbound up with healing balsam the gash made in my head by Ike, the son of Abel.Thomas and Rowena, I found to be a well-matched pair. He was stingy, and she wascruel; and—what was quite natural in such cases—she possessed the ability tomake him as cruel as herself, while she could easily descend to the level of hismeanness. In the house of Master Thomas, I was made—for the first time in sevenyears to feel the pinchings of hunger, and this was not very easy to bear.For, in all the changes of Master Hugh’s family, there was no change in thebountifulness with which they supplied me with food. Not to give a slave enoughto eat, is meanness intensified, and it is so recognized among slaveholdersgenerally, in Maryland. The rule is, no matter how coarse the food, only letthere be enough of it. This is the theory, and—in the part of Maryland I camefrom—the general practice accords with this theory. Lloyd’s plantation was anexception, as was, also, the house of Master Thomas Auld.All know the lightness of Indian corn-meal, as an article of food, and caneasily judge from the following facts whether the statements I have made of thestinginess of Master Thomas, are borne out. There were four slaves of us in thekitchen, and four whites in the great house Thomas Auld, Mrs. Auld, Hadaway Auld(brother of Thomas Auld) and little Amanda. The names of the slaves in thekitchen, were Eliza, my sister; Priscilla, my aunt; Henny, my cousin; andmyself. There were eight persons in the family. There was, each week, one halfbushel of corn-meal brought from the mill; and in the kitchen, corn-meal wasalmost our exclusive food, for very little else was allowed us. Out of thisbushel of corn-meal, the family in the great house had a small loaf everymorning; thus leaving us, in the kitchen, with not quite a half a peck per week,apiece. This allowance was less than half the allowance of food on Lloyd’splantation. It was not enough to subsist upon; and we were, therefore, reducedto the wretched necessity of living at the expense of our neighbors. We werecompelled either to beg, or to steal, and we did both. I frankly confess, thatwhile I hated everything like stealing, as such, I nevertheless did not hesitateto take food, when I was hungry, wherever I could find it. Nor was this practicethe mere result of an unreasoning instinct; it was, in my case, the result of aclear apprehension of the claims of morality. I weighed and considered thematter closely, before I ventured to satisfy my hunger by such means.Considering that my labor and person were the property of Master Thomas, andthat I was by him deprived of the necessaries of life necessaries obtained by myown labor—it was easy to deduce the right to supply myself with what was my own.It was simply appropriating what was my own to the use of my master, since thehealth and strength derived from such food were exerted in his service. To besure, this was stealing, according to the law and gospel I heard from St.Michael’s pulpit; but I had already begun to attach less importance to whatdropped from that quarter, on that point, while, as yet, I retained my reverencefor religion. It was not always convenient to steal from master, and the samereason why I might, innocently, steal from him, did not seem to justify me instealing from others. In the case of my master, it was only a question ofremoval—the taking his meat out of one tub, and putting it into another; theownership of the meat was not affected by the transaction. At first, he owned itin the tub, and last, he owned it in me. His meat house was not always open.There was a strict watch kept on that point, and the key was on a large bunch inRowena’s pocket. A great many times have we, poor creatures, been severelypinched with hunger, when meat and bread have been moulding under the lock,while the key was in the pocket of our mistress. This had been so when she knewwe were nearly half starved; and yet, that mistress, with saintly air, wouldkneel with her husband, and pray each morning that a merciful God would blessthem in basket and in store, and save them, at last, in his kingdom. But Iproceed with the argument.It was necessary that right to steal from others should be established; and thiscould only rest upon a wider range of generalization than that which supposedthe right to steal from my master.It was sometime before I arrived at this clear right. The reader will get someidea of my train of reasoning, by a brief statement of the case. “I am,” thoughtI, “not only the slave of Thomas, but I am the slave of society at large.Society at large has bound itself, in form and in fact, to assist Master Thomasin robbing me of my rightful liberty, and of the just reward of my labor;therefore, whatever rights I have against Master Thomas, I have, equally,against those confederated with him in robbing me of liberty. As society hasmarked me out as privileged plunder, on the principle of self-preservation I amjustified in plundering in turn. Since each slave belongs to all; all must,therefore, belong to each.”I shall here make a profession of faith which may shock some, offend others, andbe dissented from by all. It is this: Within the bounds of his just earnings, Ihold that the slave is fully justified in helping himself to the gold andsilver, and the best apparel of his master, or that of any other slaveholder;and that such taking is not stealing in any just sense of that word.The morality of free society can have no application to slave society.Slaveholders have made it almost impossible for the slave to commit any crime,known either to the laws of God or to the laws of man. If he steals, he takeshis own; if he kills his master, he imitates only the heroes of the revolution.Slaveholders I hold to be individually and collectively responsible for all theevils which grow out of the horrid relation, and I believe they will be so heldat the judgment, in the sight of a just God. Make a man a slave, and you rob himof moral responsibility. Freedom of choice is the essence of all accountability.But my kind readers are, probably, less concerned about my opinions, than aboutthat which more nearly touches my personal experience; albeit, my opinions have,in some sort, been formed by that experience.Bad as slaveholders are, I have seldom met with one so entirely destitute ofevery element of character capable of inspiring respect, as was my presentmaster, Capt. Thomas Auld.When I lived with him, I thought him incapable of a noble action. The leadingtrait in his character was intense selfishness. I think he was fully aware ofthis fact himself, and often tried to conceal it. Capt. Auld was not a bornslaveholder—not a birthright member of the slaveholding oligarchy. He was only aslaveholder by marriage-right; and, of all slaveholders, these latter are, byfar, the most exacting. There was in him all the love of domination, the prideof mastery, and the swagger of authority, but his rule lacked the vital elementof consistency. He could be cruel; but his methods of showing it were cowardly,and evinced his meanness rather than his spirit. His commands were strong, hisenforcement weak.Slaves are not insensible to the whole-souled characteristics of a generous,dashing slaveholder, who is fearless of consequences; and they prefer a masterof this bold and daring kind—even with the risk of being shot down for impudenceto the fretful, little soul, who never uses the lash but at the suggestion of alove of gain.Slaves, too, readily distinguish between the birthright bearing of the originalslaveholder and the assumed attitudes of the accidental slaveholder; and whilethey cannot respect either, they certainly despise the latter more than theformer.The luxury of having slaves wait upon him was something new to Master Thomas;and for it he was wholly unprepared. He was a slaveholder, without the abilityto hold or manage his slaves. We seldom called him “master,” but generallyaddressed him by his “bay craft” title—“Capt. Auld.” It is easy to see that suchconduct might do much to make him appear awkward, and, consequently, fretful.His wife was especially solicitous to have us call her husband “master.” Is yourmaster at the store?”—“Where is your master?”—“Go and tell your master”—“I willmake your master acquainted with your conduct”—she would say; but we were inaptscholars. Especially were I and my sister Eliza inapt in this particular. AuntPriscilla was less stubborn and defiant in her spirit than Eliza and myself;and, I think, her road was less rough than ours.In the month of August, 1833, when I had almost become desperate under thetreatment of Master Thomas, and when I entertained more strongly than ever theoft-repeated determination to run away, a circumstance occurred which seemed topromise brighter and better days for us all. At a Methodist camp-meeting, heldin the Bay Side (a famous place for campmeetings) about eight miles from St.Michael’s, Master Thomas came out with a profession of religion. He had longbeen an object of interest to the church, and to the ministers, as I had seen bythe repeated visits and lengthy exhortations of the latter. He was a fish quiteworth catching, for he had money and standing. In the community of St. Michael’she was equal to the best citizen. He was strictly temperate; perhaps, fromprinciple, but most likely, from interest. There was very little to do for him,to give him the appearance of piety, and to make him a pillar in the church.Well, the camp-meeting continued a week; people gathered from all parts of thecounty, and two steamboat loads came from Baltimore. The ground was happilychosen; seats were arranged; a stand erected; a rude altar fenced in, frontingthe preachers’ stand, with straw in it for the accommodation of mourners. Thislatter would hold at least one hundred persons. In front, and on the sides ofthe preachers’ stand, and outside the long rows of seats, rose the first classof stately tents, each vieing with the other in strength, neatness, and capacityfor accommodating its inmates. Behind this first circle of tents was another,less imposing, which reached round the camp-ground to the speakers’ stand.Outside this second class of tents were covered wagons, ox carts, and vehiclesof every shape and size. These served as tents to their owners. Outside ofthese, huge fires were burning, in all directions, where roasting, and boiling,and frying, were going on, for the benefit of those who were attending to theirown spiritual welfare within the circle. Behind the preachers’ stand, a narrowspace was marked out for the use of the colored people. There were no seatsprovided for this class of persons; the preachers addressed them, “over theleft,” if they addressed them at all. After the preaching was over, at everyservice, an invitation was given to mourners to come into the pen; and, in somecases, ministers went out to persuade men and women to come in. By one of theseministers, Master Thomas Auld was persuaded to go inside the pen. I was deeplyinterested in that matter, and followed; and, though colored people were notallowed either in the pen or in front of the preachers’ stand, I ventured totake my stand at a sort of half-way place between the blacks and whites, where Icould distinctly see the movements of mourners, and especially the progress ofMaster Thomas.“If he has got religion,” thought I, “he will emancipate his slaves; and if heshould not do so much as this, he will, at any rate, behave toward us morekindly, and feed us more generously than he has heretofore done.” Appealing tomy own religious experience, and judging my master by what was true in my owncase, I could not regard him as soundly converted, unless some such good resultsfollowed his profession of religion.But in my expectations I was doubly disappointed; Master Thomas was MasterThomas still. The fruits of his righteousness were to show themselves in no suchway as I had anticipated. His conversion was not to change his relation towardmen—at any rate not toward BLACK men—but toward God. My faith, I confess, wasnot great. There was something in his appearance that, in my mind, cast a doubtover his conversion. Standing where I did, I could see his every movement. Iwatched narrowly while he remained in the little pen; and although I saw thathis face was extremely red, and his hair disheveled, and though I heard himgroan, and saw a stray tear halting on his cheek, as if inquiring “which wayshall I go?”—I could not wholly confide in the genuineness of his conversion.The hesitating behavior of that tear-drop and its loneliness, distressed me, andcast a doubt upon the whole transaction, of which it was a part. But peoplesaid, “Capt. Auld had come through,” and it was for me to hope for the best. Iwas bound to do this, in charity, for I, too, was religious, and had been in thechurch full three years, although now I was not more than sixteen years old.Slaveholders may, sometimes, have confidence in the piety of some of theirslaves; but the slaves seldom have confidence in the piety of their masters. “Hecant go to heaven with our blood in his skirts,” is a settled point in the creedof every slave; rising superior to all teaching to the contrary, and standingforever as a fixed fact. The highest evidence the slaveholder can give the slaveof his acceptance with God, is the emancipation of his slaves. This is proofthat he is willing to give up all to God, and for the sake of God. Not to dothis, was, in my estimation, and in the opinion of all the slaves, an evidenceof half-heartedness, and wholly inconsistent with the idea of genuineconversion. I had read, also, somewhere in the Methodist Discipline, thefollowing question and answer:“Question. What shall be done for the extirpation of slavery?“Answer. We declare that we are much as ever convinced of the great evil ofslavery; therefore, no slaveholder shall be eligible to any official station inour church.”These words sounded in my ears for a long time, and encouraged me to hope. But,as I have before said, I was doomed to disappointment. Master Thomas seemed tobe aware of my hopes and expectations concerning him. I have thought, beforenow, that he looked at me in answer to my glances, as much as to say, “I willteach you, young man, that, though I have parted with my sins, I have not partedwith my sense. I shall hold my slaves, and go to heaven too.”Possibly, to convince us that we must not presume too much upon his recentconversion, he became rather more rigid and stringent in his exactions. Therealways was a scarcity of good nature about the man; but now his wholecountenance was soured over with the seemings of piety. His religion, therefore,neither made him emancipate his slaves, nor caused him to treat them withgreater humanity. If religion had any effect on his character at all, it madehim more cruel and hateful in all his ways. The natural wickedness of his hearthad not been removed, but only reinforced, by the profession of religion. Do Ijudge him harshly? God forbid. Facts are facts. Capt. Auld made the greatestprofession of piety. His house was, literally, a house of prayer. In themorning, and in the evening, loud prayers and hymns were heard there, in whichboth himself and his wife joined; yet, no more meal was brought from the mill,no more attention was paid to the moral welfare of the kitchen; and nothing wasdone to make us feel that the heart of Master Thomas was one whit better than itwas before he went into the little pen, opposite to the preachers’ stand, on thecamp ground.Our hopes (founded on the discipline) soon vanished; for the authorities let himinto the church at once, and before he was out of his term of probation, I heardof his leading class! He distinguished himself greatly among the brethren, andwas soon an exhorter. His progress was almost as rapid as the growth of thefabled vine of Jack’s bean. No man was more active than he, in revivals. Hewould go many miles to assist in carrying them on, and in getting outsidersinterested in religion. His house being one of the holiest, if not the happiestin St. Michael’s, became the “preachers’ home.” These preachers evidently likedto share Master Thomas’s hospitality; for while he starved us, he stuffed them.Three or four of these ambassadors of the gospel—according to slavery—have beenthere at a time; all living on the fat of the land, while we, in the kitchen,were nearly starving. Not often did we get a smile of recognition from theseholy men. They seemed almost as unconcerned about our getting to heaven, as theywere about our getting out of slavery. To this general charge there was oneexception—the Rev. GEORGE COOKMAN. Unlike Rev. Messrs. Storks, Ewry, Hickey,Humphrey and Cooper (all whom were on the St. Michael’s circuit) he kindly tookan interest in our temporal and spiritual welfare. Our souls and our bodies wereall alike sacred in his sight; and he really had a good deal of genuineanti-slavery feeling mingled with his colonization ideas. There was not a slavein our neighborhood that did not love, and almost venerate, Mr. Cookman. It waspretty generally believed that he had been chiefly instrumental in bringing oneof the largest slaveholders—Mr. Samuel Harrison—in that neighborhood, toemancipate all his slaves, and, indeed, the general impression was, that Mr.Cookman had labored faithfully with slaveholders, whenever he met them, toinduce them to emancipate their bondmen, and that he did this as a religiousduty. When this good man was at our house, we were all sure to be called in toprayers in the morning; and he was not slow in making inquiries as to the stateof our minds, nor in giving us a word of exhortation and of encouragement. Greatwas the sorrow of all the slaves, when this faithful preacher of the gospel wasremoved from the Talbot county circuit. He was an eloquent preacher, andpossessed what few ministers, south of Mason Dixon’s line, possess, or dare toshow, viz: a warm and philanthropic heart. The Mr. Cookman, of whom I speak, wasan Englishman by birth, and perished while on his way to England, on board theill-fated “President”. Could the thousands of slaves in Maryland know the fateof the good man, to whose words of comfort they were so largely indebted, theywould thank me for dropping a tear on this page, in memory of their favoritepreacher, friend and benefactor.But, let me return to Master Thomas, and to my experience, after his conversion.In Baltimore, I could, occasionally, get into a Sabbath school, among the freechildren, and receive lessons, with the rest; but, having already learned bothto read and to write, I was more of a teacher than a pupil, even there. When,however, I went back to the Eastern Shore, and was at the house of MasterThomas, I was neither allowed to teach, nor to be taught. The wholecommunity—with but a single exception, among the whites—frowned upon everythinglike imparting instruction either to slaves or to free colored persons. Thatsingle exception, a pious young man, named Wilson, asked me, one day, if I wouldlike to assist him in teaching a little Sabbath school, at the house of a freecolored man in St. Michael’s, named James Mitchell. The idea was to me adelightful one, and I told him I would gladly devote as much of my Sabbath as Icould command, to that most laudable work. Mr. Wilson soon mustered up a dozenold spelling books, and a few testaments; and we commenced operations, with sometwenty scholars, in our Sunday school. Here, thought I, is something worthliving for; here is an excellent chance for usefulness; and I shall soon have acompany of young friends, lovers of knowledge, like some of my Baltimorefriends, from whom I now felt parted forever.Our first Sabbath passed delightfully, and I spent the week after very joyously.I could not go to Baltimore, but I could make a little Baltimore here. At oursecond meeting, I learned that there was some objection to the existence of theSabbath school; and, sure enough, we had scarcely got at work—good work, simplyteaching a few colored children how to read the gospel of the Son of God—when inrushed a mob, headed by Mr. Wright Fairbanks and Mr. Garrison West—twoclass-leaders —and Master Thomas; who, armed with sticks and other missiles,drove us off, and commanded us never to meet for such a purpose again. One ofthis pious crew told me, that as for my part, I wanted to be another Nat Turner;and if I did not look out, I should get as many balls into me, as Nat did intohim. Thus ended the infant Sabbath school, in the town of St. Michael’s. Thereader will not be surprised when I say, that the breaking up of my Sabbathschool, by these class-leaders, and professedly holy men, did not serve tostrengthen my religious convictions. The cloud over my St. Michael’s home grewheavier and blacker than ever.It was not merely the agency of Master Thomas, in breaking up and destroying mySabbath school, that shook my confidence in the power of southern religion tomake men wiser or better; but I saw in him all the cruelty and meanness, afterhis conversion, which he had exhibited before he made a profession of religion.His cruelty and meanness were especially displayed in his treatment of myunfortunate cousin, Henny, whose lameness made her a burden to him. I have noextraordinary personal hard usage toward myself to complain of, against him, butI have seen him tie up the lame and maimed woman, and whip her in a manner mostbrutal, and shocking; and then, with blood-chilling blasphemy, he would quotethe passage of scripture, “That servant which knew his lord’s will, and preparednot himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with manystripes.” Master would keep this lacerated woman tied up by her wrists, to abolt in the joist, three, four and five hours at a time. He would tie her upearly in the morning, whip her with a cowskin before breakfast; leave her tiedup; go to his store, and, returning to his dinner, repeat the castigation;laying on the rugged lash, on flesh already made raw by repeated blows. Heseemed desirous to get the poor girl out of existence, or, at any rate, off hishands. In proof of this, he afterwards gave her away to his sister Sarah (Mrs.Cline) but, as in the case of Master Hugh, Henny was soon returned on his hands.Finally, upon a pretense that he could do nothing with her (I use his own words)he “set her adrift, to take care of herself.” Here was a recently converted man,holding, with tight grasp, the well-framed, and able bodied slaves left him byold master—the persons, who, in freedom, could have taken care of themselves;yet, turning loose the only cripple among them, virtually to starve and die.No doubt, had Master Thomas been asked, by some pious northern brother, why hecontinued to sustain the relation of a slaveholder, to those whom he retained,his answer would have been precisely the same as many other religiousslaveholders have returned to that inquiry, viz: “I hold my slaves for their owngood.”Bad as my condition was when I lived with Master Thomas, I was soon toexperience a life far more goading and bitter. The many differences springing upbetween myself and Master Thomas, owing to the clear perception I had of hischaracter, and the boldness with which I defended myself against his capriciouscomplaints, led him to declare that I was unsuited to his wants; that my citylife had affected me perniciously; that, in fact, it had almost ruined me forevery good purpose, and had fitted me for everything that was bad. One of mygreatest faults, or offenses, was that of letting his horse get away, and godown to the farm belonging to his father-in-law. The animal had a liking forthat farm, with which I fully sympathized. Whenever I let it out, it would godashing down the road to Mr. Hamilton’s, as if going on a grand frolic. My horsegone, of course I must go after it. The explanation of our mutual attachment tothe place is the same; the horse found there good pasturage, and I found thereplenty of bread. Mr. Hamilton had his faults, but starving his slaves was notamong them. He gave food, in abundance, and that, too, of an excellent quality.In Mr. Hamilton’s cook—Aunt Mary—I found a most generous and considerate friend.She never allowed me to go there without giving me bread enough to make good thedeficiencies of a day or two. Master Thomas at last resolved to endure mybehavior no longer; he could neither keep me, nor his horse, we liked so well tobe at his father-in-law’s farm. I had now lived with him nearly nine months, andhe had given me a number of severe whippings, without any visible improvement inmy character, or my conduct; and now he was resolved to put me out—as hesaid—“to be broken.”There was, in the Bay Side, very near the camp ground, where my master got hisreligious impressions, a man named Edward Covey, who enjoyed the execratedreputation, of being a first rate hand at breaking young Negroes. This Covey wasa poor man, a farm renter; and this reputation (hateful as it was to the slavesand to all good men) was, at the same time, of immense advantage to him. Itenabled him to get his farm tilled with very little expense, compared with whatit would have cost him without this most extraordinary reputation. Someslaveholders thought it an advantage to let Mr. Covey have the government oftheir slaves a year or two, almost free of charge, for the sake of the excellenttraining such slaves got under his happy management! Like some horse breakers,noted for their skill, who ride the best horses in the country without expense,Mr. Covey could have under him, the most fiery bloods of the neighborhood, forthe simple reward of returning them to their owners, well broken. Added to thenatural fitness of Mr. Covey for the duties of his profession, he was said to“enjoy religion,” and was as strict in the cultivation of piety, as he was inthe cultivation of his farm. I was made aware of his character by some who hadbeen under his hand; and while I could not look forward to going to him with anypleasure, I was glad to get away from St. Michael’s. I was sure of gettingenough to eat at Covey’s, even if I suffered in other respects. This, to ahungry man, is not a prospect to be regarded with indifference.CHAPTER XV.

The latter had been as good as his word, and had committed me,without reserve, to the mastery of Mr. Edward Covey. Eight or ten years had nowpassed since I had been taken from my grandmother’s cabin, in Tuckahoe; andthese years, for the most part, I had spent in Baltimore, where—as the readerhas already seen—I was treated with comparative tenderness. I was now about tosound profounder depths in slave life. The rigors of a field, less tolerablethan the field of battle, awaited me. My new master was notorious for his fierceand savage disposition, and my only consolation in going to live with him was,the certainty of finding him precisely as represented by common fame. There wasneither joy in my heart, nor elasticity in my step, as I started in search ofthe tyrant’s home. Starvation made me glad to leave Thomas Auld’s, and the cruellash made me dread to go to Covey’s. Escape was impossible; so, heavy and sad, Ipaced the seven miles, which separated Covey’s house from St. Michael’s—thinkingmuch by the solitary way—averse to my condition; but thinking was all I coulddo. Like a fish in a net, allowed to play for a time, I was now drawn rapidly tothe shore, secured at all points. “I am,” thought I, “but the sport of a powerwhich makes no account, either of my welfare or of my happiness. By a law whichI can clearly comprehend, but cannot evade nor resist, I am ruthlessly snatchedfrom the hearth of a fond grandmother, and hurried away to the home of amysterious ‘old master;’ again I am removed from there, to a master inBaltimore; thence am I snatched away to the Eastern Shore, to be valued with thebeasts of the field, and, with them, divided and set apart for a possessor; thenI am sent back to Baltimore; and by the time I have formed new attachments, andhave begun to hope that no more rude shocks shall touch me, a difference arisesbetween brothers, and I am again broken up, and sent to St. Michael’s; and now,from the latter place, I am footing my way to the home of a new master, where, Iam given to understand, that, like a wild young working animal, I am to bebroken to the yoke of a bitter and life-long bondage.”With thoughts and reflections like these, I came in sight of a smallwood-colored building, about a mile from the main road, which, from thedescription I had received, at starting, I easily recognized as my new home. TheChesapeake bay—upon the jutting banks of which the little wood-colored house wasstanding—white with foam, raised by the heavy north-west wind; Poplar Island,covered with a thick, black pine forest, standing out amid this half ocean; andKent Point, stretching its sandy, desert-like shores out into the foam-cestedbay—were all in sight, and deepened the wild and desolate aspect of my new home.The good clothes I had brought with me from Baltimore were now worn thin, andhad not been replaced; for Master Thomas was as little careful to provide usagainst cold, as against hunger. Met here by a north wind, sweeping through anopen space of forty miles, I was glad to make any port; and, therefore, Ispeedily pressed on to the little wood-colored house. The family consisted ofMr. and Mrs. Covey; Miss Kemp (a broken-backed woman) a sister of Mrs. Covey;William Hughes, cousin to Edward Covey; Caroline, the cook; Bill Smith, a hiredman; and myself. Bill Smith, Bill Hughes, and myself, were the working force ofthe farm, which consisted of three or four hundred acres. I was now, for thefirst time in my life, to be a field hand; and in my new employment I foundmyself even more awkward than a green country boy may be supposed to be, uponhis first entrance into the bewildering scenes of city life; and my awkwardnessgave me much trouble. Strange and unnatural as it may seem, I had been at my newhome but three days, before Mr. Covey (my brother in the Methodist church) gaveme a bitter foretaste of what was in reserve for me. I presume he thought, thatsince he had but a single year in which to complete his work, the sooner hebegan, the better. Perhaps he thought that by coming to blows at once, we shouldmutually better understand our relations. But to whatever motive, direct orindirect, the cause may be referred, I had not been in his possession threewhole days, before he subjected me to a most brutal chastisement. Under hisheavy blows, blood flowed freely, and wales were left on my back as large as mylittle finger. The sores on my back, from this flogging, continued for weeks,for they were kept open by the rough and coarse cloth which I wore for shirting.The occasion and details of this first chapter of my experience as a field hand,must be told, that the reader may see how unreasonable, as well as how cruel, mynew master, Covey, was. The whole thing I found to be characteristic of the man;and I was probably treated no worse by him than scores of lads who hadpreviously been committed to him, for reasons similar to those which induced mymaster to place me with him. But, here are the facts connected with the affair,precisely as they occurred.On one of the coldest days of the whole month of January, 1834, I was ordered,at day break, to get a load of wood, from a forest about two miles from thehouse. In order to perform this work, Mr. Covey gave me a pair of unbroken oxen,for, it seems, his breaking abilities had not been turned in this direction; andI may remark, in passing, that working animals in the south, are seldom so welltrained as in the north. In due form, and with all proper ceremony, I wasintroduced to this huge yoke of unbroken oxen, and was carefully told which was“Buck,” and which was “Darby”—which was the “in hand,” and which was the “offhand” ox. The master of this important ceremony was no less a person than Mr.Covey, himself; and the introduction was the first of the kind I had ever had.My life, hitherto, had led me away from horned cattle, and I had no knowledge ofthe art of managing them. What was meant by the “in ox,” as against the “offox,” when both were equally fastened to one cart, and under one yoke, I couldnot very easily divine; and the difference, implied by the names, and thepeculiar duties of each, were alike Greek to me. Why was not the “off ox” calledthe “in ox?” Where and what is the reason for this distinction in names, whenthere is none in the things themselves? After initiating me into the “woa,”“back” “gee,” “hither”—the entire spoken language between oxen and driver—Mr.Covey took a rope, about ten feet long and one inch thick, and placed one end ofit around the horns of the “in hand ox,” and gave the other end to me, tellingme that if the oxen started to run away, as the scamp knew they would, I musthold on to the rope and stop them. I need not tell any one who is acquaintedwith either the strength of the disposition of an untamed ox, that this orderwas about as unreasonable as a command to shoulder a mad bull! I had neverdriven oxen before, and I was as awkward, as a driver, as it is possible toconceive. It did not answer for me to plead ignorance, to Mr. Covey; there wassomething in his manner that quite forbade that. He was a man to whom a slaveseldom felt any disposition to speak. Cold, distant, morose, with a face wearingall the marks of captious pride and malicious sternness, he repelled alladvances. Covey was not a large man; he was only about five feet ten inches inheight, I should think; short necked, round shoulders; of quick and wiry motion,of thin and wolfish visage; with a pair of small, greenish-gray eyes, set wellback under a forehead without dignity, and constantly in motion, and floatinghis passions, rather than his thoughts, in sight, but denying them utterance inwords. The creature presented an appearance altogether ferocious and sinister,disagreeable and forbidding, in the extreme. When he spoke, it was from thecorner of his mouth, and in a sort of light growl, like a dog, when an attemptis made to take a bone from him. The fellow had already made me believe him evenworse than he had been presented. With his directions, and without stopping toquestion, I started for the woods, quite anxious to perform my first exploit indriving, in a creditable manner. The distance from the house to the woods gate afull mile, I should think—was passed over with very little difficulty; foralthough the animals ran, I was fleet enough, in the open field, to keep pacewith them; especially as they pulled me along at the end of the rope; but, onreaching the woods, I was speedily thrown into a distressing plight. The animalstook fright, and started off ferociously into the woods, carrying the cart, fulltilt, against trees, over stumps, and dashing from side to side, in a manneraltogether frightful. As I held the rope, I expected every moment to be crushedbetween the cart and the huge trees, among which they were so furiously dashing.After running thus for several minutes, my oxen were, finally, brought to astand, by a tree, against which they dashed themselves with great violence,upsetting the cart, and entangling themselves among sundry young saplings. Bythe shock, the body of the cart was flung in one direction, and the wheels andtongue in another, and all in the greatest confusion. There I was, all alone, ina thick wood, to which I was a stranger; my cart upset and shattered; my oxenentangled, wild, and enraged; and I, poor soul! but a green hand, to set allthis disorder right. I knew no more of oxen than the ox driver is supposed toknow of wisdom. After standing a few moments surveying the damage and disorder,and not without a presentiment that this trouble would draw after it others,even more distressing, I took one end of the cart body, and, by an extra outlayof strength, I lifted it toward the axle-tree, from which it had been violentlyflung; and after much pulling and straining, I succeeded in getting the body ofthe cart in its place. This was an important step out of the difficulty, and itsperformance increased my courage for the work which remained to be done. Thecart was provided with an ax, a tool with which I had become pretty wellacquainted in the ship yard at Baltimore. With this, I cut down the saplings bywhich my oxen were entangled, and again pursued my journey, with my heart in mymouth, lest the oxen should again take it into their senseless heads to cut up acaper. My fears were groundless. Their spree was over for the present, and therascals now moved off as soberly as though their behavior had been natural andexemplary. On reaching the part of the forest where I had been, the day before,chopping wood, I filled the cart with a heavy load, as a security againstanother running away. But, the neck of an ox is equal in strength to iron. Itdefies all ordinary burdens, when excited. Tame and docile to a proverb, whenwell trained, the ox is the most sullen and intractable of animals when but halfbroken to the yoke.I now saw, in my situation, several points of similarity with that of the oxen.They were property, so was I; they were to be broken, so was I. Covey was tobreak me, I was to break them; break and be broken—such is life.Half the day already gone, and my face not yet homeward! It required only twoday’s experience and observation to teach me, that such apparent waste of timewould not be lightly overlooked by Covey. I therefore hurried toward home; but,on reaching the lane gate, I met with the crowning disaster for the day. Thisgate was a fair specimen of southern handicraft. There were two huge posts,eighteen inches in diameter, rough hewed and square, and the heavy gate was sohung on one of these, that it opened only about half the proper distance. Onarriving here, it was necessary for me to let go the end of the rope on thehorns of the “in hand ox;” and now as soon as the gate was open, and I let go ofit to get the rope, again, off went my oxen—making nothing of their load—fulltilt; and in doing so they caught the huge gate between the wheel and the cartbody, literally crushing it to splinters, and coming only within a few inches ofsubjecting me to a similar crushing, for I was just in advance of the wheel whenit struck the left gate post. With these two hair-breadth escape, I thought Icould sucessfully(sic) explain to Mr. Covey the delay, and avert apprehendedpunishment. I was not without a faint hope of being commended for the sternresolution which I had displayed in accomplishing the difficult task—a taskwhich, I afterwards learned, even Covey himself would not have undertaken,without first driving the oxen for some time in the open field, preparatory totheir going into the woods. But, in this I was disappointed. On coming to him,his countenance assumed an aspect of rigid displeasure, and, as I gave him ahistory of the casualties of my trip, his wolfish face, with his greenish eyes,became intensely ferocious. “Go back to the woods again,” he said, mutteringsomething else about wasting time. I hastily obeyed; but I had not gone far onmy way, when I saw him coming after me. My oxen now behaved themselves withsingular propriety, opposing their present conduct to my representation of theirformer antics. I almost wished, now that Covey was coming, they would dosomething in keeping with the character I had given them; but no, they hadalready had their spree, and they could afford now to be extra good, readilyobeying my orders, and seeming to understand them quite as well as I did myself.On reaching the woods, my tormentor—who seemed all the way to be remarking uponthe good behavior of his oxen—came up to me, and ordered me to stop the cart,accompanying the same with the threat that he would now teach me how to breakgates, and idle away my time, when he sent me to the woods. Suiting the actionto the word, Covey paced off, in his own wiry fashion, to a large, black gumtree, the young shoots of which are generally used for ox goads, they beingexceedingly tough. Three of these goads, from four to six feet long, he cut off,and trimmed up, with his large jack-knife. This done, he ordered me to take offmy clothes. To this unreasonable order I made no reply, but sternly refused totake off my clothing. “If you will beat me,” thought I, “you shall do so over myclothes.” After many threats, which made no impression on me, he rushed at mewith something of the savage fierceness of a wolf, tore off the few and thinlyworn clothes I had on, and proceeded to wear out, on my back, the heavy goadswhich he had cut from the gum tree. This flogging was the first of a series offloggings; and though very severe, it was less so than many which came after it,and these, for offenses far lighter than the gate breaking.I remained with Mr. Covey one year (I cannot say I lived with him) and duringthe first six months that I was there, I was whipped, either with sticks orcowskins, every week. Aching bones and a sore back were my constant companions.Frequent as the lash was used, Mr. Covey thought less of it, as a means ofbreaking down my spirit, than that of hard and long continued labor. He workedme steadily, up to the point of my powers of endurance. From the dawn of day inthe morning, till the darkness was complete in the evening, I was kept at hardwork, in the field or the woods. At certain seasons of the year, we were allkept in the field till eleven and twelve o’clock at night. At these times, Coveywould attend us in the field, and urge us on with words or blows, as it seemedbest to him. He had, in his life, been an overseer, and he well understood thebusiness of slave driving. There was no deceiving him. He knew just what a manor boy could do, and he held both to strict account. When he pleased, he wouldwork himself, like a very Turk, making everything fly before him. It was,however, scarcely necessary for Mr. Covey to be really present in the field, tohave his work go on industriously. He had the faculty of making us feel that hewas always present. By a series of adroitly managed surprises, which hepracticed, I was prepared to expect him at any moment. His plan was, never toapproach the spot where his hands were at work, in an open, manly and directmanner. No thief was ever more artful in his devices than this man Covey. Hewould creep and crawl, in ditches and gullies; hide behind stumps and bushes,and practice so much of the cunning of the serpent, that Bill Smith andI—between ourselves—never called him by any other name than “the snake.” Wefancied that in his eyes and his gait we could see a snakish resemblance. Onehalf of his proficiency in the art of Negro breaking, consisted, I should think,in this species of cunning. We were never secure. He could see or hear us nearlyall the time. He was, to us, behind every stump, tree, bush and fence on theplantation. He carried this kind of trickery so far, that he would sometimesmount his horse, and make believe he was going to St. Michael’s; and, in thirtyminutes afterward, you might find his horse tied in the woods, and thesnake-like Covey lying flat in the ditch, with his head lifted above its edge,or in a fence corner, watching every movement of the slaves! I have known himwalk up to us and give us special orders, as to our work, in advance, as if hewere leaving home with a view to being absent several days; and before he gothalf way to the house, he would avail himself of our inattention to hismovements, to turn short on his heels, conceal himself behind a fence corner ora tree, and watch us until the going down of the sun. Mean and contemptible asis all this, it is in keeping with the character which the life of a slaveholderis calculated to produce. There is no earthly inducement, in the slave’scondition, to incite him to labor faithfully. The fear of punishment is the solemotive for any sort of industry, with him. Knowing this fact, as the slaveholderdoes, and judging the slave by himself, he naturally concludes the slave will beidle whenever the cause for this fear is absent. Hence, all sorts of pettydeceptions are practiced, to inspire this fear.But, with Mr. Covey, trickery was natural. Everything in the shape of learningor religion, which he possessed, was made to conform to this semi-lyingpropensity. He did not seem conscious that the practice had anything unmanly,base or contemptible about it. It was a part of an important system, with him,essential to the relation of master and slave. I thought I saw, in his veryreligious devotions, this controlling element of his character. A long prayer atnight made up for the short prayer in the morning; and few men could seem moredevotional than he, when he had nothing else to do.Mr. Covey was not content with the cold style of family worship, adopted inthese cold latitudes, which begin and end with a simple prayer. No! the voice ofpraise, as well as of prayer, must be heard in his house, night and morning. Atfirst, I was called upon to bear some part in these exercises; but the repeatedflogging given me by Covey, turned the whole thing into mockery. He was a poorsinger, and mainly relied on me for raising the hymn for the family, and when Ifailed to do so, he was thrown into much confusion. I do not think that he everabused me on account of these vexations. His religion was a thing altogetherapart from his worldly concerns. He knew nothing of it as a holy principle,directing and controlling his daily life, making the latter conform to therequirements of the gospel. One or two facts will illustrate his characterbetter than a volume of generalties(sic).I have already said, or implied, that Mr. Edward Covey was a poor man. He was,in fact, just commencing to lay the foundation of his fortune, as fortune isregarded in a slave state. The first condition of wealth and respectabilitythere, being the ownership of human property, every nerve is strained, by thepoor man, to obtain it, and very little regard is had to the manner of obtainingit. In pursuit of this object, pious as Mr. Covey was, he proved himself to beas unscrupulous and base as the worst of his neighbors. In the beginning, he wasonly able—as he said—“to buy one slave;” and, scandalous and shocking as is thefact, he boasted that he bought her simply “as a breeder.” But the worst is nottold in this naked statement. This young woman (Caroline was her name) wasvirtually compelled by Mr. Covey to abandon herself to the object for which hehad purchased her; and the result was, the birth of twins at the end of theyear. At this addition to his human stock, both Edward Covey and his wife,Susan, were ecstatic with joy. No one dreamed of reproaching the woman, or offinding fault with the hired man—Bill Smith—the father of the children, for Mr.Covey himself had locked the two up together every night, thus inviting theresult.But I will pursue this revolting subject no further. No better illustration ofthe unchaste and demoralizing character of slavery can be found, than isfurnished in the fact that this professedly Christian slaveholder, amidst allhis prayers and hymns, was shamelessly and boastfully encouraging, and actuallycompelling, in his own house, undisguised and unmitigated fornication, as ameans of increasing his human stock. I may remark here, that, while this factwill be read with disgust and shame at the north, it will be laughed at, assmart and praiseworthy in Mr. Covey, at the south; for a man is no morecondemned there for buying a woman and devoting her to this life of dishonor,than for buying a cow, and raising stock from her. The same rules are observed,with a view to increasing the number and quality of the former, as of thelatter.I will here reproduce what I said of my own experience in this wretched place,more than ten years ago:If at any one time of my life, more than another, I was made to drink thebitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my staywith Mr. Covey. We were worked all weathers. It was never too hot or too cold;it could never rain, blow, snow, or hail too hard for us to work in the field.Work, work, work, was scarcely more the order of the day than the night. Thelongest days were too short for him, and the shortest nights were too long forhim. I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there; but a few months ofhis discipline tamed me. Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken inbody, soul and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed; my intellectlanguished; the disposition to read departed; the cheerful spark that lingeredabout my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a mantransformed into a brute!Sunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beast-like stupor,between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times, I would rise up, aflash of energetic freedom would dart through my soul, accompanied with a faintbeam of hope, flickered for a moment, and then vanished. I sank down again,mourning over my wretched condition. I was sometimes prompted to take my life,and that of Covey, but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear. Mysufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake bay, whose broad bosom wasever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe. Those beautifulvessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to meso many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretchedcondition. I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer’s Sabbath, stood allalone upon the banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heart andtearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean. Thesight of these always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compelutterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out mysoul’s complaint in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude ofships:“You are loosed from your moorings, and free; I am fast in my chains, and am aslave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloodywhip! You are freedom’s swift-winged angels, that fly around the world; I amconfined in bands of iron! O, that I were free! O, that I were on one of yourgallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas! betwixt me and you theturbid waters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could also go! Could I but swim! If Icould fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make a brute! The glad ship isgone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in the hottest hell of unendingslavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me be free! Is there any God? Whyam I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it. Get caught, or get clear,I’ll try it. I had as well die with ague as with fever. I have only one life tolose. I had as well be killed running as die standing. Only think of it; onehundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes! God helping me, Iwill. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I will take to the water.This very bay shall yet bear me into freedom. The steamboats steered in anorth-east coast from North Point. I will do the same; and when I get to thehead of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straight through Delawareinto Pennsylvania. When I get there, I shall not be required to have a pass; Iwill travel without being disturbed. Let but the first opportunity offer, andcome what will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under the yoke. I amnot the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear as much as any ofthem. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to some one. It may bethat my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when I get free. Thereis a better day coming.”I shall never be able to narrate the mental experience through which it was mylot to pass during my stay at Covey’s. I was completely wrecked, changed andbewildered; goaded almost to madness at one time, and at another reconcilingmyself to my wretched condition. Everything in the way of kindness, which I hadexperienced at Baltimore; all my former hopes and aspirations for usefulness inthe world, and the happy moments spent in the exercises of religion, contrastedwith my then present lot, but increased my anguish.I suffered bodily as well as mentally. I had neither sufficient time in which toeat or to sleep, except on Sundays. The overwork, and the brutal chastisementsof which I was the victim, combined with that ever-gnawing and soul-devouringthought—“I am a slave—a slave for life—a slave with no rational ground to hopefor freedom”—rendered me a living embodiment of mental and physicalwretchedness."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XVI. ANOTHER PRESSURE OF THE TYRANT’S VICEEXPERIENCE AT COVEY’S SUMMED UP—FIRST SIX MONTHS SEVERER THANTHE SECOND—PRELIMINARIES TO THE CHANCE—REASONS FOR NARRATING THECIRCUMSTANCES—SCENE IN TREADING YARD—TAKEN ILL—UNUSUAL BRUTALITYOF COVEY—ESCAPE TO ST. MICHAEL’S—THE PURSUIT—SUFFERING IN THEWOODS—DRIVEN BACK AGAIN TO COVEY’S—BEARING OF MASTER THOMAS—THE SLAVEIS NEVER SICK—NATURAL TO EXPECT SLAVES TO FEIGN SICKNESS—LAZINESS OFSLAVEHOLDERS.The foregoing chapter, with all its horrid incidents and shocking features, maybe taken as a fair representation of the first six months of my life at Covey’s.The reader has but to repeat, in his own mind, once a week, the scene in thewoods, where Covey subjected me to his merciless lash, to have a true idea of mybitter experience there, during the first period of the breaking process throughwhich Mr. Covey carried me. I have no heart to repeat each separate transaction,in which I was victim of his violence and brutality. Such a narration would filla volume much larger than the present one. I aim only to give the reader atruthful impression of my slave life, without unnecessarily affecting him withharrowing details.As I have elsewhere intimated that my hardships were much greater during thefirst six months of my stay at Covey’s, than during the remainder of the year,and as the change in my condition was owing to causes which may help the readerto a better understanding of human nature, when subjected to the terribleextremities of slavery, I will narrate the circumstances of this change,although I may seem thereby to applaud my own courage. You have, dear reader,seen me humbled, degraded, broken down, enslaved, and brutalized, and youunderstand how it was done; now let us see the converse of all this, and how itwas brought about; and this will take us through the year 1834.On one of the hottest days of the month of August, of the year just mentioned,had the reader been passing through Covey’s farm, he might have seen me at work,in what is there called the “treading yard”—a yard upon which wheat is troddenout from the straw, by the horses’ feet. I was there, at work, feeding the“fan,” or rather bringing wheat to the fan, while Bill Smith was feeding. Ourforce consisted of Bill Hughes, Bill Smith, and a slave by the name of Eli; thelatter having been hired for this occasion. The work was simple, and requiredstrength and activity, rather than any skill or intelligence, and yet, to oneentirely unused to such work, it came very hard. The heat was intense andoverpowering, and there was much hurry to get the wheat, trodden out that day,through the fan; since, if that work was done an hour before sundown, the handswould have, according to a promise of Covey, that hour added to their night’srest. I was not behind any of them in the wish to complete the day’s work beforesundown, and, hence, I struggled with all my might to get the work forward. Thepromise of one hour’s repose on a week day, was sufficient to quicken my pace,and to spur me on to extra endeavor. Besides, we had all planned to go fishing,and I certainly wished to have a hand in that. But I was disappointed, and theday turned out to be one of the bitterest I ever experienced. About threeo’clock, while the sun was pouring down his burning rays, and not a breeze wasstirring, I broke down; my strength failed me; I was seized with a violentaching of the head, attended with extreme dizziness, and trembling in everylimb. Finding what was coming, and feeling it would never do to stop work, Inerved myself up, and staggered on until I fell by the side of the wheat fan,feeling that the earth had fallen upon me. This brought the entire work to adead stand. There was work for four; each one had his part to perform, and eachpart depended on the other, so that when one stopped, all were compelled tostop. Covey, who had now become my dread, as well as my tormentor, was at thehouse, about a hundred yards from where I was fanning, and instantly, uponhearing the fan stop, he came down to the treading yard, to inquire into thecause of our stopping. Bill Smith told him I was sick, and that I was unablelonger to bring wheat to the fan.I had, by this time, crawled away, under the side of a post-and-rail fence, inthe shade, and was exceeding ill. The intense heat of the sun, the heavy dustrising from the fan, the stooping, to take up the wheat from the yard, togetherwith the hurrying, to get through, had caused a rush of blood to my head. Inthis condition, Covey finding out where I was, came to me; and, after standingover me a while, he asked me what the matter was. I told him as well as I could,for it was with difficulty that I could speak. He then gave me a savage kick inthe side, which jarred my whole frame, and commanded me to get up. The man hadobtained complete control over me; and if he had commanded me to do any possiblething, I should, in my then state of mind, have endeavored to comply. I made aneffort to rise, but fell back in the attempt, before gaining my feet. The brutenow gave me another heavy kick, and again told me to rise. I again tried torise, and succeeded in gaining my feet; but upon stooping to get the tub withwhich I was feeding the fan, I again staggered and fell to the ground; and Imust have so fallen, had I been sure that a hundred bullets would have piercedme, as the consequence. While down, in this sad condition, and perfectlyhelpless, the merciless Negro breaker took up the hickory slab, with whichHughes had been striking off the wheat to a level with the sides of the halfbushel measure (a very hard weapon) and with the sharp edge of it, he dealt me aheavy blow on my head which made a large gash, and caused the blood to runfreely, saying, at the same time, “If you have got the headache, I’ll cure you.”This done, he ordered me again to rise, but I made no effort to do so; for I hadmade up my mind that it was useless, and that the heartless monster might now dohis worst; he could but kill me, and that might put me out of my misery. Findingme unable to rise, or rather despairing of my doing so, Covey left me, with aview to getting on with the work without me. I was bleeding very freely, and myface was soon covered with my warm blood. Cruel and merciless as was the motivethat dealt that blow, dear reader, the wound was fortunate for me. Bleeding wasnever more efficacious. The pain in my head speedily abated, and I was soon ableto rise. Covey had, as I have said, now left me to my fate; and the questionwas, shall I return to my work, or shall I find my way to St. Michael’s, andmake Capt. Auld acquainted with the atrocious cruelty of his brother Covey, andbeseech him to get me another master? Remembering the object he had in view, inplacing me under the management of Covey, and further, his cruel treatment of mypoor crippled cousin, Henny, and his meanness in the matter of feeding andclothing his slaves, there was little ground to hope for a favorable receptionat the hands of Capt. Thomas Auld. Nevertheless, I resolved to go straight toCapt. Auld, thinking that, if not animated by motives of humanity, he might beinduced to interfere on my behalf from selfish considerations. “He cannot,”thought I, “allow his property to be thus bruised and battered, marred anddefaced; and I will go to him, and tell him the simple truth about the matter.”In order to get to St. Michael’s, by the most favorable and direct road, I mustwalk seven miles; and this, in my sad condition, was no easy performance. I hadalready lost much blood; I was exhausted by over exertion; my sides were sorefrom the heavy blows planted there by the stout boots of Mr. Covey; and I was,in every way, in an unfavorable plight for the journey. I however watched mychance, while the cruel and cunning Covey was looking in an opposite direction,and started off, across the field, for St. Michael’s. This was a daring step; ifit failed, it would only exasperate Covey, and increase the rigors of mybondage, during the remainder of my term of service under him; but the step wastaken, and I must go forward. I succeeded in getting nearly half way across thebroad field, toward the woods, before Mr. Covey observed me. I was stillbleeding, and the exertion of running had started the blood afresh. “Come back!Come back!” vociferated Covey, with threats of what he would do if I did notreturn instantly. But, disregarding his calls and his threats, I pressed ontoward the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow. Seeing no signs of mystopping, Covey caused his horse to be brought out and saddled, as if heintended to pursue me. The race was now to be an unequal one; and, thinking Imight be overhauled by him, if I kept the main road, I walked nearly the wholedistance in the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoid detection andpursuit. But, I had not gone far, before my little strength again failed me, andI laid down. The blood was still oozing from the wound in my head; and, for atime, I suffered more than I can describe. There I was, in the deep woods, sickand emaciated, pursued by a wretch whose character for revolting cruelty beggarsall opprobrious speech—bleeding, and almost bloodless. I was not without thefear of bleeding to death. The thought of dying in the woods, all alone, and ofbeing torn to pieces by the buzzards, had not yet been rendered tolerable by mymany troubles and hardships, and I was glad when the shade of the trees, and thecool evening breeze, combined with my matted hair to stop the flow of blood.After lying there about three quarters of an hour, brooding over the singularand mournful lot to which I was doomed, my mind passing over the whole scale orcircle of belief and unbelief, from faith in the overruling providence of God,to the blackest atheism, I again took up my journey toward St. Michael’s, moreweary and sad than in the morning when I left Thomas Auld’s for the home of Mr.Covey. I was bare-footed and bare-headed, and in my shirt sleeves. The way wasthrough bogs and briers, and I tore my feet often during the journey. I was fullfive hours in going the seven or eight miles; partly, because of thedifficulties of the way, and partly, because of the feebleness induced by myillness, bruises and loss of blood. On gaining my master’s store, I presented anappearance of wretchedness and woe, fitted to move any but a heart of stone.From the crown of my head to the sole of my feet, there were marks of blood. Myhair was all clotted with dust and blood, and the back of my shirt was literallystiff with the same. Briers and thorns had scarred and torn my feet and legs,leaving blood marks there. Had I escaped from a den of tigers, I could not havelooked worse than I did on reaching St. Michael’s. In this unhappy plight, Iappeared before my professedly Christian master, humbly to invoke theinterposition of his power and authority, to protect me from further abuse andviolence. I had begun to hope, during the latter part of my tedious journeytoward St. Michael’s, that Capt. Auld would now show himself in a nobler lightthan I had ever before seen him. I was disappointed. I had jumped from a sinkingship into the sea; I had fled from the tiger to something worse. I told him allthe circumstances, as well as I could; how I was endeavoring to please Covey;how hard I was at work in the present instance; how unwilling I sunk down underthe heat, toil and pain; the brutal manner in which Covey had kicked me in theside; the gash cut in my head; my hesitation about troubling him (Capt. Auld)with complaints; but, that now I felt it would not be best longer to concealfrom him the outrages committed on me from time to time by Covey. At first,master Thomas seemed somewhat affected by the story of my wrongs, but he soonrepressed his feelings and became cold as iron. It was impossible—as I stoodbefore him at the first—for him to seem indifferent. I distinctly saw his humannature asserting its conviction against the slave system, which made cases likemine possible; but, as I have said, humanity fell before the systematic tyrannyof slavery. He first walked the floor, apparently much agitated by my story, andthe sad spectacle I presented; but, presently, it was his turn to talk. He beganmoderately, by finding excuses for Covey, and ending with a full justificationof him, and a passionate condemnation of me. “He had no doubt I deserved theflogging. He did not believe I was sick; I was only endeavoring to get rid ofwork. My dizziness was laziness, and Covey did right to flog me, as he haddone.” After thus fairly annihilating me, and rousing himself by his owneloquence, he fiercely demanded what I wished him to do in the case!With such a complete knock-down to all my hopes, as he had given me, andfeeling, as I did, my entire subjection to his power, I had very little heart toreply. I must not affirm my innocence of the allegations which he had piled upagainst me; for that would be impudence, and would probably call down freshviolence as well as wrath upon me. The guilt of a slave is always, andeverywhere, presumed; and the innocence of the slaveholder or the slaveemployer, is always asserted. The word of the slave, against this presumption,is generally treated as impudence, worthy of punishment. “Do you contradict me,you rascal?” is a final silencer of counter statements from the lips of a slave.Calming down a little in view of my silence and hesitation, and, perhaps, from arapid glance at the picture of misery I presented, he inquired again, “what Iwould have him do?” Thus invited a second time, I told Master Thomas I wishedhim to allow me to get a new home and to find a new master; that, as sure as Iwent back to live with Mr. Covey again, I should be killed by him; that he wouldnever forgive my coming to him (Capt. Auld) with a complaint against him(Covey); that, since I had lived with him, he almost crushed my spirit, and Ibelieved that he would ruin me for future service; that my life was not safe inhis hands. This, Master Thomas (my brother in the church) regarded as“nonsence(sic).” “There was no danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me; he was a goodman, industrious and religious, and he would not think of removing me from thathome; besides,” said he and this I found was the most distressing thought of allto him—“if you should leave Covey now, that your year has but half expired, Ishould lose your wages for the entire year. You belong to Mr. Covey for oneyear, and you must go back to him, come what will. You must not trouble me withany more stories about Mr. Covey; and if you do not go immediately home, I willget hold of you myself.” This was just what I expected, when I found he hadprejudged the case against me. “But, Sir,” I said, “I am sick and tired, and Icannot get home to-night.” At this, he again relented, and finally he allowed meto remain all night at St. Michael’s; but said I must be off early in themorning, and concluded his directions by making me swallow a huge dose of epsomsalts—about the only medicine ever administered to slaves.It was quite natural for Master Thomas to presume I was feigning sickness toescape work, for he probably thought that were he in the place of a slave withno wages for his work, no praise for well doing, no motive for toil but thelash—he would try every possible scheme by which to escape labor. I say I haveno doubt of this; the reason is, that there are not, under the whole heavens, aset of men who cultivate such an intense dread of labor as do the slaveholders.The charge of laziness against the slave is ever on their lips, and is thestanding apology for every species of cruelty and brutality. These men literally“bind heavy burdens, grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; butthey, themselves, will not move them with one of their fingers.”My kind readers shall have, in the next chapter—what they were led, perhaps, toexpect to find in this—namely: an account of my partial disenthrallment from thetyranny of Covey, and the marked change which it brought about.CHAPTER XVII. THE LAST FLOGGINGA SLEEPLESS NIGHT—RETURN TO COVEY’S—PURSUED BY COVEY—THECHASE DEFEATED—VENGEANCE POSTPONED—MUSINGS IN THE WOODS—THEALTERNATIVE—DEPLORABLE SPECTACLE—NIGHT IN THE WOODS—EXPECTEDATTACK—ACCOSTED BY SANDY, A FRIEND, NOT A HUNTER—SANDY’SHOSPITALITY—THE “ASH CAKE” SUPPER—THE INTERVIEW WITH SANDY—HISADVICE—SANDY A CONJURER AS WELL AS A CHRISTIAN—THE MAGIC ROOT—STRANGEMEETING WITH COVEY—HIS MANNER—COVEY’S SUNDAY FACE—MY DEFENSIVERESOLVE—THE FIGHT—THE VICTORY, AND ITS RESULTS.Sleep itself does not always come to the relief of the weary in body, and thebroken in spirit; especially when past troubles only foreshadow comingdisasters. The last hope had been extinguished. My master, who I did not ventureto hope would protect me as a man, had even now refused to protect me as hisproperty; and had cast me back, covered with reproaches and bruises, into thehands of a stranger to that mercy which was the soul of the religion heprofessed. May the reader never spend such a night as that allotted to me,previous to the morning which was to herald my return to the den of horrors fromwhich I had made a temporary escape.I remained all night—sleep I did not—at St. Michael’s; and in the morning(Saturday) I started off, according to the order of Master Thomas, feeling thatI had no friend on earth, and doubting if I had one in heaven. I reached Covey’sabout nine o’clock; and just as I stepped into the field, before I had reachedthe house, Covey, true to his snakish habits, darted out at me from a fencecorner, in which he had secreted himself, for the purpose of securing me. He wasamply provided with a cowskin and a rope; and he evidently intended to tie meup, and to wreak his vengeance on me to the fullest extent. I should have beenan easy prey, had he succeeded in getting his hands upon me, for I had taken norefreshment since noon on Friday; and this, together with the pelting,excitement, and the loss of blood, had reduced my strength. I, however, dartedback into the woods, before the ferocious hound could get hold of me, and buriedmyself in a thicket, where he lost sight of me. The corn-field afforded mecover, in getting to the woods. But for the tall corn, Covey would haveovertaken me, and made me his captive. He seemed very much chagrined that he didnot catch me, and gave up the chase, very reluctantly; for I could see his angrymovements, toward the house from which he had sallied, on his foray.Well, now I am clear of Covey, and of his wrathful lash, for present. I am inthe wood, buried in its somber gloom, and hushed in its solemn silence; hid fromall human eyes; shut in with nature and nature’s God, and absent from all humancontrivances. Here was a good place to pray; to pray for help for deliverance—aprayer I had often made before. But how could I pray? Covey could pray—Capt.Auld could pray—I would fain pray; but doubts (arising partly from my ownneglect of the means of grace, and partly from the sham religion whicheverywhere prevailed, cast in my mind a doubt upon all religion, and led me tothe conviction that prayers were unavailing and delusive) prevented my embracingthe opportunity, as a religious one. Life, in itself, had almost becomeburdensome to me. All my outward relations were against me; I must stay here andstarve (I was already hungry) or go home to Covey’s, and have my flesh torn topieces, and my spirit humbled under the cruel lash of Covey. This was thepainful alternative presented to me. The day was long and irksome. My physicalcondition was deplorable. I was weak, from the toils of the previous day, andfrom the want of food and rest; and had been so little concerned about myappearance, that I had not yet washed the blood from my garments. I was anobject of horror, even to myself. Life, in Baltimore, when most oppressive, wasa paradise to this. What had I done, what had my parents done, that such a lifeas this should be mine? That day, in the woods, I would have exchanged mymanhood for the brutehood of an ox.Night came. I was still in the woods, unresolved what to do. Hunger had not yetpinched me to the point of going home, and I laid myself down in the leaves torest; for I had been watching for hunters all day, but not being molested duringthe day, I expected no disturbance during the night. I had come to theconclusion that Covey relied upon hunger to drive me home; and in this I wasquite correct—the facts showed that he had made no effort to catch me, sincemorning.During the night, I heard the step of a man in the woods. He was coming towardthe place where I lay. A person lying still has the advantage over one walkingin the woods, in the day time, and this advantage is much greater at night. Iwas not able to engage in a physical struggle, and I had recourse to the commonresort of the weak. I hid myself in the leaves to prevent discovery. But, as thenight rambler in the woods drew nearer, I found him to be a friend, not anenemy; it was a slave of Mr. William Groomes, of Easton, a kind hearted fellow,named “Sandy.” Sandy lived with Mr. Kemp that year, about four miles from St.Michael’s. He, like myself had been hired out by the year; but, unlike myself,had not been hired out to be broken. Sandy was the husband of a free woman, wholived in the lower part of “Potpie Neck,” and he was now on his way through thewoods, to see her, and to spend the Sabbath with her.As soon as I had ascertained that the disturber of my solitude was not an enemy,but the good-hearted Sandy—a man as famous among the slaves of the neighborhoodfor his good nature, as for his good sense I came out from my hiding place, andmade myself known to him. I explained the circumstances of the past two days,which had driven me to the woods, and he deeply compassionated my distress. Itwas a bold thing for him to shelter me, and I could not ask him to do so; for,had I been found in his hut, he would have suffered the penalty of thirty-ninelashes on his bare back, if not something worse. But Sandy was too generous topermit the fear of punishment to prevent his relieving a brother bondman fromhunger and exposure; and, therefore, on his own motion, I accompanied him to hishome, or rather to the home of his wife—for the house and lot were hers. Hiswife was called up—for it was now about midnight—a fire was made, some Indianmeal was soon mixed with salt and water, and an ash cake was baked in a hurry torelieve my hunger. Sandy’s wife was not behind him in kindness—both seemed toesteem it a privilege to succor me; for, although I was hated by Covey and by mymaster, I was loved by the colored people, because they thought I was hated formy knowledge, and persecuted because I was feared. I was the only slave now inthat region who could read and write. There had been one other man, belonging toMr. Hugh Hamilton, who could read (his name was “Jim”), but he, poor fellow,had, shortly after my coming into the neighborhood, been sold off to the farsouth. I saw Jim ironed, in the cart, to be carried to Easton for sale—pinionedlike a yearling for the slaughter. My knowledge was now the pride of my brotherslaves; and, no doubt, Sandy felt something of the general interest in me onthat account. The supper was soon ready, and though I have feasted since, withhonorables, lord mayors and aldermen, over the sea, my supper on ash cake andcold water, with Sandy, was the meal, of all my life, most sweet to my taste,and now most vivid in my memory.Supper over, Sandy and I went into a discussion of what was possible for me,under the perils and hardships which now overshadowed my path. The question was,must I go back to Covey, or must I now tempt to run away? Upon a careful survey,the latter was found to be impossible; for I was on a narrow neck of land, everyavenue from which would bring me in sight of pursuers. There was the Chesapeakebay to the right, and “Pot-pie” river to the left, and St. Michael’s and itsneighborhood occupying the only space through which there was any retreat.I found Sandy an old advisor. He was not only a religious man, but he professedto believe in a system for which I have no name. He was a genuine African, andhad inherited some of the so-called magical powers, said to be possessed byAfrican and eastern nations. He told me that he could help me; that, in thosevery woods, there was an herb, which in the morning might be found, possessingall the powers required for my protection (I put his thoughts in my ownlanguage); and that, if I would take his advice, he would procure me the root ofthe herb of which he spoke. He told me further, that if I would take that rootand wear it on my right side, it would be impossible for Covey to strike me ablow; that with this root about my person, no white man could whip me. He saidhe had carried it for years, and that he had fully tested its virtues. He hadnever received a blow from a slaveholder since he carried it; and he neverexpected to receive one, for he always meant to carry that root as a protection.He knew Covey well, for Mrs. Covey was the daughter of Mr. Kemp; and he (Sandy)had heard of the barbarous treatment to which I was subjected, and he wanted todo something for me.Now all this talk about the root, was to me, very absurd and ridiculous, if notpositively sinful. I at first rejected the idea that the simple carrying a rooton my right side (a root, by the way, over which I walked every time I went intothe woods) could possess any such magic power as he ascribed to it, and I was,therefore, not disposed to cumber my pocket with it. I had a positive aversionto all pretenders to “divination.” It was beneath one of my intelligence tocountenance such dealings with the devil, as this power implied. But, with allmy learning—it was really precious little—Sandy was more than a match for me.“My book learning,” he said, “had not kept Covey off me” (a powerful argumentjust then) and he entreated me, with flashing eyes, to try this. If it did me nogood, it could do me no harm, and it would cost me nothing, any way. Sandy wasso earnest, and so confident of the good qualities of this weed, that, to pleasehim, rather than from any conviction of its excellence, I was induced to takeit. He had been to me the good Samaritan, and had, almost providentially, foundme, and helped me when I could not help myself; how did I know but that the handof the Lord was in it? With thoughts of this sort, I took the roots from Sandy,and put them in my right hand pocket.This was, of course, Sunday morning. Sandy now urged me to go home, with allspeed, and to walk up bravely to the house, as though nothing had happened. Isaw in Sandy too deep an insight into human nature, with all his superstition,not to have some respect for his advice; and perhaps, too, a slight gleam orshadow of his superstition had fallen upon me. At any rate, I started off towardCovey’s, as directed by Sandy. Having, the previous night, poured my griefs intoSandy’s ears, and got him enlisted in my behalf, having made his wife a sharerin my sorrows, and having, also, become well refreshed by sleep and food, Imoved off, quite courageously, toward the much dreaded Covey’s. Singularlyenough, just as I entered his yard gate, I met him and his wife, dressed intheir Sunday best—looking as smiling as angels—on their way to church. Themanner of Covey astonished me. There was something really benignant in hiscountenance. He spoke to me as never before; told me that the pigs had got intothe lot, and he wished me to drive them out; inquired how I was, and seemed analtered man. This extraordinary conduct of Covey, really made me begin to thinkthat Sandy’s herb had more virtue in it than I, in my pride, had been willing toallow; and, had the day been other than Sunday, I should have attributed Covey’saltered manner solely to the magic power of the root. I suspected, however, thatthe Sabbath, and not the root, was the real explanation of Covey’s manner. Hisreligion hindered him from breaking the Sabbath, but not from breaking my skin.He had more respect for the day than for the man, for whom the day wasmercifully given; for while he would cut and slash my body during the week, hewould not hesitate, on Sunday, to teach me the value of my soul, or the way oflife and salvation by Jesus Christ.All went well with me till Monday morning; and then, whether the root had lostits virtue, or whether my tormentor had gone deeper into the black art thanmyself (as was sometimes said of him), or whether he had obtained a specialindulgence, for his faithful Sabbath day’s worship, it is not necessary for meto know, or to inform the reader; but, this I may say—the pious and benignantsmile which graced Covey’s face on Sunday, wholly disappeared on Monday. Longbefore daylight, I was called up to go and feed, rub, and curry the horses. Iobeyed the call, and would have so obeyed it, had it been made at anearilier(sic) hour, for I had brought my mind to a firm resolve, during thatSunday’s reflection, viz: to obey every order, however unreasonable, if it werepossible, and, if Mr. Covey should then undertake to beat me, to defend andprotect myself to the best of my ability. My religious views on the subject ofresisting my master, had suffered a serious shock, by the savage persecution towhich I had been subjected, and my hands were no longer tied by my religion.Master Thomas’s indifference had served the last link. I had now to this extent“backslidden” from this point in the slave’s religious creed; and I soon hadoccasion to make my fallen state known to my Sunday-pious brother, Covey.Whilst I was obeying his order to feed and get the horses ready for the field,and when in the act of going up the stable loft for the purpose of throwing downsome blades, Covey sneaked into the stable, in his peculiar snake-like way, andseizing me suddenly by the leg, he brought me to the stable floor, giving mynewly mended body a fearful jar. I now forgot my roots, and remembered my pledgeto stand up in my own defense. The brute was endeavoring skillfully to get aslip-knot on my legs, before I could draw up my feet. As soon as I found what hewas up to, I gave a sudden spring (my two day’s rest had been of much service tome,) and by that means, no doubt, he was able to bring me to the floor soheavily. He was defeated in his plan of tying me. While down, he seemed to thinkhe had me very securely in his power. He little thought he was—as the rowdiessay—“in” for a “rough and tumble” fight; but such was the fact. Whence came thedaring spirit necessary to grapple with a man who, eight-and-forty hours before,could, with his slightest word have made me tremble like a leaf in a storm, I donot know; at any rate, I was resolved to fight, and, what was better still, Iwas actually hard at it. The fighting madness had come upon me, and I found mystrong fingers firmly attached to the throat of my cowardly tormentor; asheedless of consequences, at the moment, as though we stood as equals before thelaw. The very color of the man was forgotten. I felt as supple as a cat, and wasready for the snakish creature at every turn. Every blow of his was parried,though I dealt no blows in turn. I was strictly on the defensive, preventing himfrom injuring me, rather than trying to injure him. I flung him on the groundseveral times, when he meant to have hurled me there. I held him so firmly bythe throat, that his blood followed my nails. He held me, and I held him.All was fair, thus far, and the contest was about equal. My resistance wasentirely unexpected, and Covey was taken all aback by it, for he trembled inevery limb. “Are you going to resist, you scoundrel?” said he. To which, Ireturned a polite “Yes sir;” steadily gazing my interrogator in the eye, to meetthe first approach or dawning of the blow, which I expected my answer would callforth. But, the conflict did not long remain thus equal. Covey soon cried outlustily for help; not that I was obtaining any marked advantage over him, or wasinjuring him, but because he was gaining none over me, and was not able, singlehanded, to conquer me. He called for his cousin Hughs, to come to hisassistance, and now the scene was changed. I was compelled to give blows, aswell as to parry them; and, since I was, in any case, to suffer for resistance,I felt (as the musty proverb goes) that “I might as well be hanged for an oldsheep as a lamb.” I was still defensive toward Covey, but aggressive towardHughs; and, at the first approach of the latter, I dealt a blow, in mydesperation, which fairly sickened my youthful assailant. He went off, bendingover with pain, and manifesting no disposition to come within my reach again.The poor fellow was in the act of trying to catch and tie my right hand, andwhile flattering himself with success, I gave him the kick which sent himstaggering away in pain, at the same time that I held Covey with a firm hand.Taken completely by surprise, Covey seemed to have lost his usual strength andcoolness. He was frightened, and stood puffing and blowing, seemingly unable tocommand words or blows. When he saw that poor Hughes was standing half bent withpain—his courage quite gone the cowardly tyrant asked if I “meant to persist inmy resistance.” I told him “I did mean to resist, come what might;” that I hadbeen by him treated like a brute, during the last six months; and that I shouldstand it no longer. With that, he gave me a shake, and attempted to drag metoward a stick of wood, that was lying just outside the stable door. He meant toknock me down with it; but, just as he leaned over to get the stick, I seizedhim with both hands by the collar, and, with a vigorous and sudden snatch, Ibrought my assailant harmlessly, his full length, on the not overcleanground—for we were now in the cow yard. He had selected the place for the fight,and it was but right that he should have all the advantges(sic) of his ownselection.By this time, Bill, the hiredman, came home. He had been to Mr. Hemsley’s, tospend the Sunday with his nominal wife, and was coming home on Monday morning,to go to work. Covey and I had been skirmishing from before daybreak, till now,that the sun was almost shooting his beams over the eastern woods, and we werestill at it. I could not see where the matter was to terminate. He evidently wasafraid to let me go, lest I should again make off to the woods; otherwise, hewould probably have obtained arms from the house, to frighten me. Holding me,Covey called upon Bill for assistance. The scene here, had something comic aboutit. “Bill,” who knew precisely what Covey wished him to do, affected ignorance,and pretended he did not know what to do. “What shall I do, Mr. Covey,” saidBill. “Take hold of him—take hold of him!” said Covey. With a toss of his head,peculiar to Bill, he said, “indeed, Mr. Covey I want to go to work.” “This isyour work,” said Covey; “take hold of him.” Bill replied, with spirit, “Mymaster hired me here, to work, and not to help you whip Frederick.” It was nowmy turn to speak. “Bill,” said I, “don’t put your hands on me.” To which hereplied, “My GOD! Frederick, I ain’t goin’ to tech ye,” and Bill walked off,leaving Covey and myself to settle our matters as best we might.But, my present advantage was threatened when I saw Caroline (the slave-woman ofCovey) coming to the cow yard to milk, for she was a powerful woman, and couldhave mastered me very easily, exhausted as I now was. As soon as she came intothe yard, Covey attempted to rally her to his aid. Strangely—and, I may add,fortunately—Caroline was in no humor to take a hand in any such sport. We wereall in open rebellion, that morning. Caroline answered the command of her masterto “take hold of me,” precisely as Bill had answered, but in her, it was atgreater peril so to answer; she was the slave of Covey, and he could do what hepleased with her. It was not so with Bill, and Bill knew it. Samuel Harris, towhom Bill belonged, did not allow his slaves to be beaten, unless they wereguilty of some crime which the law would punish. But, poor Caroline, likemyself, was at the mercy of the merciless Covey; nor did she escape the direeffects of her refusal. He gave her several sharp blows.Covey at length (two hours had elapsed) gave up the contest. Letting me go, hesaid—puffing and blowing at a great rate—“Now, you scoundrel, go to your work; Iwould not have whipped you half so much as I have had you not resisted.” Thefact was, he had not whipped me at all. He had not, in all the scuffle, drawn asingle drop of blood from me. I had drawn blood from him; and, even without thissatisfaction, I should have been victorious, because my aim had not been toinjure him, but to prevent his injuring me.During the whole six months that I lived with Covey, after this transaction, henever laid on me the weight of his finger in anger. He would, occasionally, sayhe did not want to have to get hold of me again—a declaration which I had nodifficulty in believing; and I had a secret feeling, which answered, “You neednot wish to get hold of me again, for you will be likely to come off worse in asecond fight than you did in the first.”Well, my dear reader, this battle with Mr. Covey—undignified as it was, and as Ifear my narration of it is—was the turning point in my “life as a slave.” Itrekindled in my breast the smouldering embers of liberty; it brought up myBaltimore dreams, and revived a sense of my own manhood. I was a changed beingafter that fight. I was nothing before; I WAS A MAN NOW. It recalled to life mycrushed self-respect and my self-confidence, and inspired me with a reneweddetermination to be A FREEMAN. A man, without force, is without the essentialdignity of humanity. Human nature is so constituted, that it cannot honor ahelpless man, although it can pity him; and even this it cannot do long, if thesigns of power do not arise.He can only understand the effect of this combat on my spirit, who has himselfincurred something, hazarded something, in repelling the unjust and cruelaggressions of a tyrant. Covey was a tyrant, and a cowardly one, withal. Afterresisting him, I felt as I had never felt before. It was a resurrection from thedark and pestiferous tomb of slavery, to the heaven of comparative freedom. Iwas no longer a servile coward, trembling under the frown of a brother worm ofthe dust, but, my long-cowed spirit was roused to an attitude of manlyindependence. I had reached the point, at which I was not afraid to die. Thisspirit made me a freeman in fact, while I remained a slave in form. When a slavecannot be flogged he is more than half free. He has a domain as broad as his ownmanly heart to defend, and he is really “a power on earth.” While slaves prefertheir lives, with flogging, to instant death, they will always find Christiansenough, like unto Covey, to accommodate that preference. From this time, untilthat of my escape from slavery, I was never fairly whipped. Several attemptswere made to whip me, but they were always unsuccessful. Bruises I did get, as Ishall hereafter inform the reader; but the case I have been describing, was theend of the brutification to which slavery had subjected me.The reader will be glad to know why, after I had so grievously offended Mr.Covey, he did not have me taken in hand by the authorities; indeed, why the lawof Maryland, which assigns hanging to the slave who resists his master, was notput in force against me; at any rate, why I was not taken up, as is usual insuch cases, and publicly whipped, for an example to other slaves, and as a meansof deterring me from committing the same offense again. I confess, that the easymanner in which I got off, for a long time, a surprise to me, and I cannot, evennow, fully explain the cause.The only explanation I can venture to suggest, is the fact, that Covey was,probably, ashamed to have it known and confessed that he had been mastered by aboy of sixteen. Mr. Covey enjoyed the unbounded and very valuable reputation, ofbeing a first rate overseer and Negro breaker. By means of this reputation, hewas able to procure his hands for very trifling compensation, and with verygreat ease. His interest and his pride mutually suggested the wisdom of passingthe matter by, in silence. The story that he had undertaken to whip a lad, andhad been resisted, was, of itself, sufficient to damage him; for his bearingshould, in the estimation of slaveholders, be of that imperial order that shouldmake such an occurrence impossible. I judge from these circumstances, that Coveydeemed it best to give me the go-by. It is, perhaps, not altogether creditableto my natural temper, that, after this conflict with Mr. Covey, I did, at times,purposely aim to provoke him to an attack, by refusing to keep with the otherhands in the field, but I could never bully him to another battle. I had made upmy mind to do him serious damage, if he ever again attempted to lay violenthands on me. Hereditary bondmen, know ye not Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow?CHAPTER XVIII.

Igladly left the snakish Covey, although he was now as gentle as a lamb. My homefor the year 1835 was already secured—my next master was already selected. Thereis always more or less excitement about the matter of changing hands, but I hadbecome somewhat reckless. I cared very little into whose hands I fell—I meant tofight my way. Despite of Covey, too, the report got abroad, that I was hard towhip; that I was guilty of kicking back; that though generally a good temperedNegro, I sometimes “got the devil in me.” These sayings were rife in Talbotcounty, and they distinguished me among my servile brethren. Slaves, generally,will fight each other, and die at each other’s hands; but there are few who arenot held in awe by a white man. Trained from the cradle up, to think and feelthat their masters are superior, and invested with a sort of sacredness, thereare few who can outgrow or rise above the control which that sentimentexercises. I had now got free from it, and the thing was known. One bad sheepwill spoil a whole flock. Among the slaves, I was a bad sheep. I hated slavery,slaveholders, and all pertaining to them; and I did not fail to inspire otherswith the same feeling, wherever and whenever opportunity was presented. Thismade me a marked lad among the slaves, and a suspected one among theslaveholders. A knowledge of my ability to read and write, got pretty widelyspread, which was very much against me.The days between Christmas day and New Year’s, are allowed the slaves asholidays. During these days, all regular work was suspended, and there wasnothing to do but to keep fires, and look after the stock. This time wasregarded as our own, by the grace of our masters, and we, therefore used it, orabused it, as we pleased. Those who had families at a distance, were nowexpected to visit them, and to spend with them the entire week. The youngerslaves, or the unmarried ones, were expected to see to the cattle, and attend toincidental duties at home. The holidays were variously spent. The sober,thinking and industrious ones of our number, would employ themselves inmanufacturing corn brooms, mats, horse collars and baskets, and some of thesewere very well made. Another class spent their time in hunting opossums, coons,rabbits, and other game. But the majority spent the holidays in sports, ballplaying, wrestling, boxing, running foot races, dancing, and drinking whisky;and this latter mode of spending the time was generally most agreeable to theirmasters. A slave who would work during the holidays, was thought, by his master,undeserving of holidays. Such an one had rejected the favor of his master. Therewas, in this simple act of continued work, an accusation against slaves; and aslave could not help thinking, that if he made three dollars during theholidays, he might make three hundred during the year. Not to be drunk duringthe holidays, was disgraceful; and he was esteemed a lazy and improvident man,who could not afford to drink whisky during Christmas.The fiddling, dancing and “jubilee beating,” was going on in all directions.This latter performance is strictly southern. It supplies the place of a violin,or of other musical instruments, and is played so easily, that almost every farmhas its “Juba” beater. The performer improvises as he beats, and sings his merrysongs, so ordering the words as to have them fall pat with the movement of hishands. Among a mass of nonsense and wild frolic, once in a while a sharp hit isgiven to the meanness of slaveholders. Take the following, for an example:"},{"pageContent":" We raise de wheat, Dey gib us de corn; We bake de bread, Dey gib us de cruss; We sif de meal, Dey gib us de huss; We peal de meat, Dey gib us de skin, And dat’s de way Dey takes us in. We skim de pot, Dey gib us the liquor, And say dat’s good enough for nigger. Walk over! walk over! Tom butter and de fat; Poor nigger you can’t get over dat;  Walk over!This is not a bad summary of the palpable injustice and fraud of slavery,giving—as it does—to the lazy and idle, the comforts which God designed shouldbe given solely to the honest laborer. But to the holiday’s.Judging from my own observation and experience, I believe these holidays to beamong the most effective means, in the hands of slaveholders, of keeping downthe spirit of insurrection among the slaves.To enslave men, successfully and safely, it is necessary to have their mindsoccupied with thoughts and aspirations short of the liberty of which they aredeprived. A certain degree of attainable good must be kept before them. Theseholidays serve the purpose of keeping the minds of the slaves occupied withprospective pleasure, within the limits of slavery. The young man can go wooing;the married man can visit his wife; the father and mother can see theirchildren; the industrious and money loving can make a few dollars; the greatwrestler can win laurels; the young people can meet, and enjoy each other’ssociety; the drunken man can get plenty of whisky; and the religious man canhold prayer meetings, preach, pray and exhort during the holidays. Before theholidays, these are pleasures in prospect; after the holidays, they becomepleasures of memory, and they serve to keep out thoughts and wishes of a moredangerous character. Were slaveholders at once to abandon the practice ofallowing their slaves these liberties, periodically, and to keep them, the yearround, closely confined to the narrow circle of their homes, I doubt not thatthe south would blaze with insurrections. These holidays are conductors orsafety valves to carry off the explosive elements inseparable from the humanmind, when reduced to the condition of slavery. But for these, the rigors ofbondage would become too severe for endurance, and the slave would be forced upto dangerous desperation. Woe to the slaveholder when he undertakes to hinder orto prevent the operation of these electric conductors. A succession ofearthquakes would be less destructive, than the insurrectionary fires whichwould be sure to burst forth in different parts of the south, from suchinterference.Thus, the holidays, became part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrongs andinhumanity of slavery. Ostensibly, they are institutions of benevolence,designed to mitigate the rigors of slave life, but, practically, they are afraud, instituted by human selfishness, the better to secure the ends ofinjustice and oppression. The slave’s happiness is not the end sought, but,rather, the master’s safety. It is not from a generous unconcern for the slave’slabor that this cessation from labor is allowed, but from a prudent regard tothe safety of the slave system. I am strengthened in this opinion, by the fact,that most slaveholders like to have their slaves spend the holidays in such amanner as to be of no real benefit to the slaves. It is plain, that everythinglike rational enjoyment among the slaves, is frowned upon; and only those wildand low sports, peculiar to semi-civilized people, are encouraged. All thelicense allowed, appears to have no other object than to disgust the slaves withtheir temporary freedom, and to make them as glad to return to their work, asthey were to leave it. By plunging them into exhausting depths of drunkennessand dissipation, this effect is almost certain to follow. I have knownslaveholders resort to cunning tricks, with a view of getting their slavesdeplorably drunk. A usual plan is, to make bets on a slave, that he can drinkmore whisky than any other; and so to induce a rivalry among them, for themastery in this degradation. The scenes, brought about in this way, were oftenscandalous and loathsome in the extreme. Whole multitudes might be foundstretched out in brutal drunkenness, at once helpless and disgusting. Thus, whenthe slave asks for a few hours of virtuous freedom, his cunning master takesadvantage of his ignorance, and cheers him with a dose of vicious and revoltingdissipation, artfully labeled with the name of LIBERTY. We were induced todrink, I among the rest, and when the holidays were over, we all staggered upfrom our filth and wallowing, took a long breath, and went away to our variousfields of work; feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go from that which ourmasters artfully deceived us into the belief was freedom, back again to the armsof slavery. It was not what we had taken it to be, nor what it might have been,had it not been abused by us. It was about as well to be a slave to master, asto be a slave to rum and whisky.I am the more induced to take this view of the holiday system, adopted byslaveholders, from what I know of their treatment of slaves, in regard to otherthings. It is the commonest thing for them to try to disgust their slaves withwhat they do not want them to have, or to enjoy. A slave, for instance, likesmolasses; he steals some; to cure him of the taste for it, his master, in manycases, will go away to town, and buy a large quantity of the poorest quality,and set it before his slave, and, with whip in hand, compel him to eat it, untilthe poor fellow is made to sicken at the very thought of molasses. The samecourse is often adopted to cure slaves of the disagreeable and inconvenientpractice of asking for more food, when their allowance has failed them. The samedisgusting process works well, too, in other things, but I need not cite them.When a slave is drunk, the slaveholder has no fear that he will plan aninsurrection; no fear that he will escape to the north. It is the sober,thinking slave who is dangerous, and needs the vigilance of his master, to keephim a slave. But, to proceed with my narrative.On the first of January, 1835, I proceeded from St. Michael’s to Mr. WilliamFreeland’s, my new home. Mr. Freeland lived only three miles from St. Michael’s,on an old worn out farm, which required much labor to restore it to anythinglike a self-supporting establishment.I was not long in finding Mr. Freeland to be a very different man from Mr.Covey. Though not rich, Mr. Freeland was what may be called a well-bred southerngentleman, as different from Covey, as a well-trained and hardened Negro breakeris from the best specimen of the first families of the south. Though Freelandwas a slaveholder, and shared many of the vices of his class, he seemed alive tothe sentiment of honor. He had some sense of justice, and some feelings ofhumanity. He was fretful, impulsive and passionate, but I must do him thejustice to say, he was free from the mean and selfish characteristics whichdistinguished the creature from which I had now, happily, escaped. He was open,frank, imperative, and practiced no concealments, disdaining to play the spy. Inall this, he was the opposite of the crafty Covey.Among the many advantages gained in my change from Covey’s toFreeland’s—startling as the statement may be—was the fact that the lattergentleman made no profession of religion. I assert most unhesitatingly, that thereligion of the south—as I have observed it and proved it—is a mere covering forthe most horrid crimes; the justifier of the most appalling barbarity; asanctifier of the most hateful frauds; and a secure shelter, under which thedarkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal abominations fester and flourish.Were I again to be reduced to the condition of a slave, next to that calamity, Ishould regard the fact of being the slave of a religious slaveholder, thegreatest that could befall me. For all slaveholders with whom I have ever met,religious slaveholders are the worst. I have found them, almost invariably, thevilest, meanest and basest of their class. Exceptions there may be, but this istrue of religious slaveholders, as a class. It is not for me to explain thefact. Others may do that; I simply state it as a fact, and leave thetheological, and psychological inquiry, which it raises, to be decided by othersmore competent than myself. Religious slaveholders, like religious persecutors,are ever extreme in their malice and violence. Very near my new home, on anadjoining farm, there lived the Rev. Daniel Weeden, who was both pious and cruelafter the real Covey pattern. Mr. Weeden was a local preacher of the ProtestantMethodist persuasion, and a most zealous supporter of the ordinances ofreligion, generally. This Weeden owned a woman called “Ceal,” who was a standingproof of his mercilessness. Poor Ceal’s back, always scantily clothed, was keptliterally raw, by the lash of this religious man and gospel minister. The mostnotoriously wicked man—so called in distinction from church members—could hirehands more easily than this brute. When sent out to find a home, a slave wouldnever enter the gates of the preacher Weeden, while a sinful sinner needed ahand. Be have ill, or behave well, it was the known maxim of Weeden, that it isthe duty of a master to use the lash. If, for no other reason, he contended thatthis was essential to remind a slave of his condition, and of his master’sauthority. The good slave must be whipped, to be kept good, and the bad slavemust be whipped, to be made good. Such was Weeden’s theory, and such was hispractice. The back of his slave-woman will, in the judgment, be the swiftestwitness against him.While I am stating particular cases, I might as well immortalize another of myneighbors, by calling him by name, and putting him in print. He did not thinkthat a “chiel” was near, “taking notes,” and will, doubtless, feel quite angryat having his character touched off in the ragged style of a slave’s pen. I begto introduce the reader to REV. RIGBY HOPKINS. Mr. Hopkins resides betweenEaston and St. Michael’s, in Talbot county, Maryland. The severity of this manmade him a perfect terror to the slaves of his neighborhood. The peculiarfeature of his government, was, his system of whipping slaves, as he said, inadvance of deserving it. He always managed to have one or two slaves to whip onMonday morning, so as to start his hands to their work, under the inspiration ofa new assurance on Monday, that his preaching about kindness, mercy, brotherlylove, and the like, on Sunday, did not interfere with, or prevent him fromestablishing his authority, by the cowskin. He seemed to wish to assure them,that his tears over poor, lost and ruined sinners, and his pity for them, didnot reach to the blacks who tilled his fields. This saintly Hopkins used toboast, that he was the best hand to manage a Negro in the county. He whipped forthe smallest offenses, by way of preventing the commission of large ones.The reader might imagine a difficulty in finding faults enough for such frequentwhipping. But this is because you have no idea how easy a matter it is to offenda man who is on the look-out for offenses. The man, unaccustomed toslaveholding, would be astonished to observe how many foggable offenses thereare in the slaveholder’s catalogue of crimes; and how easy it is to commit anyone of them, even when the slave least intends it. A slaveholder, bent onfinding fault, will hatch up a dozen a day, if he chooses to do so, and each oneof these shall be of a punishable description. A mere look, word, or motion, amistake, accident, or want of power, are all matters for which a slave may bewhipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied with his condition? It issaid, that he has the devil in him, and it must be whipped out. Does he answerloudly, when spoken to by his master, with an air of self-consciousness? Then,must he be taken down a button-hole lower, by the lash, well laid on. Does heforget, and omit to pull off his hat, when approaching a white person? Then, hemust, or may be, whipped for his bad manners. Does he ever venture to vindicatehis conduct, when harshly and unjustly accused? Then, he is guilty of impudence,one of the greatest crimes in the social catalogue of southern society. To allowa slave to escape punishment, who has impudently attempted to exculpate himselffrom unjust charges, preferred against him by some white person, is to be guiltyof great dereliction of duty. Does a slave ever venture to suggest a better wayof doing a thing, no matter what? He is, altogether, too officious—wise abovewhat is written—and he deserves, even if he does not get, a flogging for hispresumption. Does he, while plowing, break a plow, or while hoeing, break a hoe,or while chopping, break an ax? No matter what were the imperfections of theimplement broken, or the natural liabilities for breaking, the slave can bewhipped for carelessness. The reverend slaveholder could always find somethingof this sort, to justify him in using the lash several times during the week.Hopkins—like Covey and Weeden—were shunned by slaves who had the privilege (asmany had) of finding their own masters at the end of each year; and yet, therewas not a man in all that section of country, who made a louder profession ofreligion, than did MR. RIGBY HOPKINS.But, to continue the thread of my story, through my experience when at Mr.William Freeland’s.My poor, weather-beaten bark now reached smoother water, and gentler breezes. Mystormy life at Covey’s had been of service to me. The things that would haveseemed very hard, had I gone direct to Mr. Freeland’s, from the home of MasterThomas, were now (after the hardships at Covey’s) “trifles light as air.” I wasstill a field hand, and had come to prefer the severe labor of the field, to theenervating duties of a house servant. I had become large and strong; and hadbegun to take pride in the fact, that I could do as much hard work as some ofthe older men. There is much rivalry among slaves, at times, as to which can dothe most work, and masters generally seek to promote such rivalry. But some ofus were too wise to race with each other very long. Such racing, we had thesagacity to see, was not likely to pay. We had our times for measuring eachother’s strength, but we knew too much to keep up the competition so long as toproduce an extraordinary day’s work. We knew that if, by extraordinary exertion,a large quantity of work was done in one day, the fact, becoming known to themaster, might lead him to require the same amount every day. This thought wasenough to bring us to a dead halt when over so much excited for the race.At Mr. Freeland’s, my condition was every way improved. I was no longer the poorscape-goat that I was when at Covey’s, where every wrong thing done was saddledupon me, and where other slaves were whipped over my shoulders. Mr. Freeland wastoo just a man thus to impose upon me, or upon any one else.It is quite usual to make one slave the object of especial abuse, and to beathim often, with a view to its effect upon others, rather than with anyexpectation that the slave whipped will be improved by it, but the man with whomI now was, could descend to no such meanness and wickedness. Every man here washeld individually responsible for his own conduct.This was a vast improvement on the rule at Covey’s. There, I was the generalpack horse. Bill Smith was protected, by a positive prohibition made by his richmaster, and the command of the rich slaveholder is LAW to the poor one; Hugheswas favored, because of his relationship to Covey; and the hands hiredtemporarily, escaped flogging, except as they got it over my poor shoulders. Ofcourse, this comparison refers to the time when Covey could whip me.Mr. Freeland, like Mr. Covey, gave his hands enough to eat, but, unlike Mr.Covey, he gave them time to take their meals; he worked us hard during the day,but gave us the night for rest—another advantage to be set to the credit of thesinner, as against that of the saint. We were seldom in the field after dark inthe evening, or before sunrise in the morning. Our implements of husbandry wereof the most improved pattern, and much superior to those used at Covey’s.Nothwithstanding the improved condition which was now mine, and the manyadvantages I had gained by my new home, and my new master, I was still restlessand discontented. I was about as hard to please by a master, as a master is byslave. The freedom from bodily torture and unceasing labor, had given my mind anincreased sensibility, and imparted to it greater activity. I was not yetexactly in right relations. “How be it, that was not first which is spiritual,but that which is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual.” When entombedat Covey’s, shrouded in darkness and physical wretchedness, temporal wellbeingwas the grand desideratum; but, temporal wants supplied, the spirit puts in itsclaims. Beat and cuff your slave, keep him hungry and spiritless, and he willfollow the chain of his master like a dog; but, feed and clothe him well—workhim moderately—surround him with physical comfort—and dreams of freedom intrude.Give him a bad master, and he aspires to a good master; give him a good master,and he wishes to become his own master. Such is human nature. You may hurl a manso low, beneath the level of his kind, that he loses all just ideas of hisnatural position; but elevate him a little, and the clear conception of rightsarises to life and power, and leads him onward. Thus elevated, a little, atFreeland’s, the dreams called into being by that good man, Father Lawson, whenin Baltimore, began to visit me; and shoots from the tree of liberty began toput forth tender buds, and dim hopes of the future began to dawn.I found myself in congenial society, at Mr. Freeland’s. There were Henry Harris,John Harris, Handy Caldwell, and Sandy Jenkins. 6[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-6]Henry and John were brothers, and belonged to Mr. Freeland. They were bothremarkably bright and intelligent, though neither of them could read. Now formischief! I had not been long at Freeland’s before I was up to my old tricks. Iearly began to address my companions on the subject of education, and theadvantages of intelligence over ignorance, and, as far as I dared, I tried toshow the agency of ignorance in keeping men in slavery. Webster’s spelling bookand the Columbian Orator were looked into again. As summer came on, and the longSabbath days stretched themselves over our idleness, I became uneasy, and wanteda Sabbath school, in which to exercise my gifts, and to impart the littleknowledge of letters which I possessed, to my brother slaves. A house was hardlynecessary in the summer time; I could hold my school under the shade of an oldoak tree, as well as any where else. The thing was, to get the scholars, and tohave them thoroughly imbued with the desire to learn. Two such boys were quicklysecured, in Henry and John, and from them the contagion spread. I was not longbringing around me twenty or thirty young men, who enrolled themselves, gladly,in my Sabbath school, and were willing to meet me regularly, under the trees orelsewhere, for the purpose of learning to read. It was surprising with what easethey provided themselves with spelling books. These were mostly the cast offbooks of their young masters or mistresses. I taught, at first, on our own farm.All were impressed with the necessity of keeping the matter as private aspossible, for the fate of the St. Michael’s attempt was notorious, and fresh inthe minds of all. Our pious masters, at St. Michael’s, must not know that a fewof their dusky brothers were learning to read the word of God, lest they shouldcome down upon us with the lash and chain. We might have met to drink whisky, towrestle, fight, and to do other unseemly things, with no fear of interruptionfrom the saints or sinners of St. Michael’s.But, to meet for the purpose of improving the mind and heart, by learning toread the sacred scriptures, was esteemed a most dangerous nuisance, to beinstantly stopped. The slaveholders of St. Michael’s, like slaveholderselsewhere, would always prefer to see the slaves engaged in degrading sports,rather than to see them acting like moral and accountable beings.Had any one asked a religious white man, in St. Michael’s, twenty years ago, thenames of three men in that town, whose lives were most after the pattern of ourLord and Master, Jesus Christ, the first three would have been as follows: GARRISON WEST, Class Leader. WRIGHT FAIRBANKS, Class Leader. THOMAS AULD, Class Leader.And yet, these were men who ferociously rushed in upon my Sabbath school, at St.Michael’s, armed with mob-like missiles, and I must say, I thought him aChristian, until he took part in bloody by the lash. This same Garrison West wasmy class leader, and I must say, I thought him a Christian, until he took partin breaking up my school. He led me no more after that. The plea for thisoutrage was then, as it is now and at all times—the danger to good order. If theslaves learnt to read, they would learn something else, and something worse. Thepeace of slavery would be disturbed; slave rule would be endangered. I leave thereader to characterize a system which is endangered by such causes. I do notdispute the soundness of the reasoning. It is perfectly sound; and, if slaverybe right, Sabbath schools for teaching slaves to read the bible are wrong, andought to be put down. These Christian class leaders were, to this extent,consistent. They had settled the question, that slavery is right, and, by thatstandard, they determined that Sabbath schools are wrong. To be sure, they wereProtestant, and held to the great Protestant right of every man to “search thescriptures” for himself; but, then, to all general rules, there are exceptions.How convenient! What crimes may not be committed under the doctrine of the lastremark. But, my dear, class leading Methodist brethren, did not condescend togive me a reason for breaking up the Sabbath school at St. Michael’s; it wasenough that they had determined upon its destruction. I am, however, digressing.After getting the school cleverly into operation, the second time holding it inthe woods, behind the barn, and in the shade of trees—I succeeded in inducing afree colored man, who lived several miles from our house, to permit me to holdmy school in a room at his house. He, very kindly, gave me this liberty; but heincurred much peril in doing so, for the assemblage was an unlawful one. I shallnot mention, here, the name of this man; for it might, even now, subject him topersecution, although the offenses were committed more than twenty years ago. Ihad, at one time, more than forty scholars, all of the right sort; and many ofthem succeeded in learning to read. I have met several slaves from Maryland, whowere once my scholars; and who obtained their freedom, I doubt not, partly inconsequence of the ideas imparted to them in that school. I have had variousemployments during my short life; but I look back to none with moresatisfaction, than to that afforded by my Sunday school. An attachment, deep andlasting, sprung up between me and my persecuted pupils, which made parting fromthem intensely grievous; and, when I think that most of these dear souls are yetshut up in this abject thralldom, I am overwhelmed with grief.Besides my Sunday school, I devoted three evenings a week to my fellow slaves,during the winter. Let the reader reflect upon the fact, that, in this christiancountry, men and women are hiding from professors of religion, in barns, in thewoods and fields, in order to learn to read the holy bible. Those dear souls,who came to my Sabbath school, came not because it was popular or reputable toattend such a place, for they came under the liability of having forty stripeslaid on their naked backs. Every moment they spend in my school, they were underthis terrible liability; and, in this respect, I was sharer with them. Theirminds had been cramped and starved by their cruel masters; the light ofeducation had been completely excluded; and their hard earnings had been takento educate their master’s children. I felt a delight in circumventing thetyrants, and in blessing the victims of their curses.The year at Mr. Freeland’s passed off very smoothly, to outward seeming. Not ablow was given me during the whole year. To the credit of Mr.Freeland—irreligious though he was—it must be stated, that he was the bestmaster I ever had, until I became my own master, and assumed for myself, as Ihad a right to do, the responsibility of my own existence and the exercise of myown powers. For much of the happiness—or absence of misery—with which I passedthis year with Mr. Freeland, I am indebted to the genial temper and ardentfriendship of my brother slaves. They were, every one of them, manly, generousand brave, yes; I say they were brave, and I will add, fine looking. It isseldom the lot of mortals to have truer and better friends than were the slaveson this farm. It is not uncommon to charge slaves with great treachery towardeach other, and to believe them incapable of confiding in each other; but I mustsay, that I never loved, esteemed, or confided in men, more than I did in these.They were as true as steel, and no band of brothers could have been more loving.There were no mean advantages taken of each other, as is sometimes the casewhere slaves are situated as we were; no tattling; no giving each other badnames to Mr. Freeland; and no elevating one at the expense of the other. Wenever undertook to do any thing, of any importance, which was likely to affecteach other, without mutual consultation. We were generally a unit, and movedtogether. Thoughts and sentiments were exchanged between us, which might well becalled very incendiary, by oppressors and tyrants; and perhaps the time has noteven now come, when it is safe to unfold all the flying suggestions which arisein the minds of intelligent slaves. Several of my friends and brothers, if yetalive, are still in some part of the house of bondage; and though twenty yearshave passed away, the suspicious malice of slavery might punish them for evenlistening to my thoughts.The slaveholder, kind or cruel, is a slaveholder still—the every hour violatorof the just and inalienable rights of man; and he is, therefore, every hoursilently whetting the knife of vengeance for his own throat. He never lisps asyllable in commendation of the fathers of this republic, nor denounces anyattempted oppression of himself, without inviting the knife to his own throat,and asserting the rights of rebellion for his own slaves.The year is ended, and we are now in the midst of the Christmas holidays, whichare kept this year as last, according to the general description previouslygiven.CHAPTER XIX.

The mind naturally occupies itself with the mysteries of life in allits phases—the ideal, the real and the actual. Sober people look both ways atthe beginning of the year, surveying the errors of the past, and providingagainst possible errors of the future. I, too, was thus exercised. I had littlepleasure in retrospect, and the prospect was not very brilliant.“Notwithstanding,” thought I, “the many resolutions and prayers I have made, inbehalf of freedom, I am, this first day of the year 1836, still a slave, stillwandering in the depths of spirit-devouring thralldom. My faculties and powersof body and soul are not my own, but are the property of a fellow mortal, in nosense superior to me, except that he has the physical power to compel me to beowned and controlled by him. By the combined physical force of the community, Iam his slave—a slave for life.” With thoughts like these, I was perplexed andchafed; they rendered me gloomy and disconsolate. The anguish of my mind may notbe written.At the close of the year 1835, Mr. Freeland, my temporary master, had bought meof Capt. Thomas Auld, for the year 1836. His promptness in securing my services,would have been flattering to my vanity, had I been ambitious to win thereputation of being a valuable slave. Even as it was, I felt a slight degree ofcomplacency at the circumstance. It showed he was as well pleased with me as aslave, as I was with him as a master. I have already intimated my regard for Mr.Freeland, and I may say here, in addressing northern readers—where is no selfishmotive for speaking in praise of a slaveholder—that Mr. Freeland was a man ofmany excellent qualities, and to me quite preferable to any master I ever had.But the kindness of the slavemaster only gilds the chain of slavery, anddetracts nothing from its weight or power. The thought that men are made forother and better uses than slavery, thrives best under the gentle treatment of akind master. But the grim visage of slavery can assume no smiles which canfascinate the partially enlightened slave, into a forgetfulness of his bondage,nor of the desirableness of liberty.I was not through the first month of this, my second year with the kind andgentlemanly Mr. Freeland, before I was earnestly considering and advising plansfor gaining that freedom, which, when I was but a mere child, I had ascertainedto be the natural and inborn right of every member of the human family. Thedesire for this freedom had been benumbed, while I was under the brutalizingdominion of Covey; and it had been postponed, and rendered inoperative, by mytruly pleasant Sunday school engagements with my friends, during the year 1835,at Mr. Freeland’s. It had, however, never entirely subsided. I hated slavery,always, and the desire for freedom only needed a favorable breeze, to fan itinto a blaze, at any moment. The thought of only being a creature of the presentand the past, troubled me, and I longed to have a future—a future with hope init. To be shut up entirely to the past and present, is abhorrent to the humanmind; it is to the soul—whose life and happiness is unceasing progress—what theprison is to the body; a blight and mildew, a hell of horrors. The dawning ofthis, another year, awakened me from my temporary slumber, and roused into lifemy latent, but long cherished aspirations for freedom. I was now not onlyashamed to be contented in slavery, but ashamed to seem to be contented, and inmy present favorable condition, under the mild rule of Mr. F., I am not surethat some kind reader will not condemn me for being over ambitious, and greatlywanting in proper humility, when I say the truth, that I now drove from me allthoughts of making the best of my lot, and welcomed only such thoughts as led meaway from the house of bondage. The intense desires, now felt, to be free,quickened by my present favorable circumstances, brought me to the determinationto act, as well as to think and speak. Accordingly, at the beginning of thisyear 1836, I took upon me a solemn vow, that the year which had now dawned uponme should not close, without witnessing an earnest attempt, on my part, to gainmy liberty. This vow only bound me to make my escape individually; but the yearspent with Mr. Freeland had attached me, as with “hooks of steel,” to my brotherslaves. The most affectionate and confiding friendship existed between us; and Ifelt it my duty to give them an opportunity to share in my virtuousdetermination by frankly disclosing to them my plans and purposes. Toward Henryand John Harris, I felt a friendship as strong as one man can feel for another;for I could have died with and for them. To them, therefore, with a suitabledegree of caution, I began to disclose my sentiments and plans; sounding them,the while on the subject of running away, provided a good chance should offer. Iscarcely need tell the reader, that I did my very best to imbue the minds of mydear friends with my own views and feelings. Thoroughly awakened, now, and witha definite vow upon me, all my little reading, which had any bearing on thesubject of human rights, was rendered available in my communications with myfriends. That (to me) gem of a book, the Columbian Orator, with its eloquentorations and spicy dialogues, denouncing oppression and slavery—telling of whathad been dared, done and suffered by men, to obtain the inestimable boon ofliberty—was still fresh in my memory, and whirled into the ranks of my speechwith the aptitude of well trained soldiers, going through the drill. The factis, I here began my public speaking. I canvassed, with Henry and John, thesubject of slavery, and dashed against it the condemning brand of God’s eternaljustice, which it every hour violates. My fellow servants were neitherindifferent, dull, nor inapt. Our feelings were more alike than our opinions.All, however, were ready to act, when a feasible plan should be proposed. “Showus how the thing is to be done,” said they, “and all is clear.”We were all, except Sandy, quite free from slaveholding priestcraft. It was invain that we had been taught from the pulpit at St. Michael’s, the duty ofobedience to our masters; to recognize God as the author of our enslavement; toregard running away an offense, alike against God and man; to deem ourenslavement a merciful and beneficial arrangement; to esteem our condition, inthis country, a paradise to that from which we had been snatched in Africa; toconsider our hard hands and dark color as God’s mark of displeasure, and aspointing us out as the proper subjects of slavery; that the relation of masterand slave was one of reciprocal benefits; that our work was not more serviceableto our masters, than our master’s thinking was serviceable to us. I say, it wasin vain that the pulpit of St. Michael’s had constantly inculcated theseplausible doctrine. Nature laughed them to scorn. For my own part, I had nowbecome altogether too big for my chains. Father Lawson’s solemn words, of what Iought to be, and might be, in the providence of God, had not fallen dead on mysoul. I was fast verging toward manhood, and the prophecies of my childhood werestill unfulfilled. The thought, that year after year had passed away, and myresolutions to run away had failed and faded—that I was still a slave, and aslave, too, with chances for gaining my freedom diminished and stilldiminishing—was not a matter to be slept over easily; nor did I easily sleepover it.But here came a new trouble. Thoughts and purposes so incendiary as those I nowcherished, could not agitate the mind long, without danger of making themselvesmanifest to scrutinizing and unfriendly beholders. I had reason to fear that mysable face might prove altogether too transparent for the safe concealment of myhazardous enterprise. Plans of greater moment have leaked through stone walls,and revealed their projectors. But, here was no stone wall to hide my purpose. Iwould have given my poor, tell tale face for the immoveable countenance of anIndian, for it was far from being proof against the daily, searching glances ofthose with whom I met.It is the interest and business of slaveholders to study human nature, with aview to practical results, and many of them attain astonishing proficiency indiscerning the thoughts and emotions of slaves. They have to deal not withearth, wood, or stone, but with men; and, by every regard they have for theirsafety and prosperity, they must study to know the material on which they are atwork. So much intellect as the slaveholder has around him, requires watching.Their safety depends upon their vigilance. Conscious of the injustice and wrongthey are every hour perpetrating, and knowing what they themselves would do ifmade the victims of such wrongs, they are looking out for the first signs of thedread retribution of justice. They watch, therefore, with skilled and practicedeyes, and have learned to read, with great accuracy, the state of mind and heartof the slaves, through his sable face. These uneasy sinners are quick to inquireinto the matter, where the slave is concerned. Unusual sobriety, apparentabstraction, sullenness and indifference—indeed, any mood out of the commonway—afford ground for suspicion and inquiry. Often relying on their superiorposition and wisdom, they hector and torture the slave into a confession, byaffecting to know the truth of their accusations. “You have got the devil inyou,” say they, “and we will whip him out of you.” I have often been put thus tothe torture, on bare suspicion. This system has its disadvantages as well astheir opposite. The slave is sometimes whipped into the confession of offenseswhich he never committed. The reader will see that the good old rule—“a man isto be held innocent until proved to be guilty”—does not hold good on the slaveplantation. Suspicion and torture are the approved methods of getting at thetruth, here. It was necessary for me, therefore, to keep a watch over mydeportment, lest the enemy should get the better of me.But with all our caution and studied reserve, I am not sure that Mr. Freelanddid not suspect that all was not right with us. It did seem that he watched usmore narrowly, after the plan of escape had been conceived and discussed amongstus. Men seldom see themselves as others see them; and while, to ourselves,everything connected with our contemplated escape appeared concealed, Mr.Freeland may have, with the peculiar prescience of a slaveholder, mastered thehuge thought which was disturbing our peace in slavery.I am the more inclined to think that he suspected us, because, prudent as wewere, as I now look back, I can see that we did many silly things, very wellcalculated to awaken suspicion. We were, at times, remarkably buoyant, singinghymns and making joyous exclamations, almost as triumphant in their tone as ifwe reached a land of freedom and safety. A keen observer might have detected inour repeated singing of O Canaan, sweet Canaan, I am bound for the land of Canaan,something more than a hope of reaching heaven. We meant to reach the north—andthe north was our Canaan. I thought I heard them say, There were lions in the way, I don’t expect to Star Much longer here. Run to Jesus—shun the danger— I don’t expect to stay Much longer here.was a favorite air, and had a double meaning. In the lips of some, it meant theexpectation of a speedy summons to a world of spirits; but, in the lips of ourcompany, it simply meant, a speedy pilgrimage toward a free state, anddeliverance from all the evils and dangers of slavery.I had succeeded in winning to my (what slaveholders would call wicked) scheme, acompany of five young men, the very flower of the neighborhood, each one of whomwould have commanded one thousand dollars in the home market. At New Orleans,they would have brought fifteen hundred dollars a piece, and, perhaps, more. Thenames of our party were as follows: Henry Harris; John Harris, brother to Henry;Sandy Jenkins, of root memory; Charles Roberts, and Henry Bailey. I was theyoungest, but one, of the party. I had, however, the advantage of them all, inexperience, and in a knowledge of letters. This gave me great influence overthem. Perhaps not one of them, left to himself, would have dreamed of escape asa possible thing. Not one of them was self-moved in the matter. They all wantedto be free; but the serious thought of running away, had not entered into theirminds, until I won them to the undertaking. They all were tolerably well off—forslaves—and had dim hopes of being set free, some day, by their masters. If anyone is to blame for disturbing the quiet of the slaves and slave-masters of theneighborhood of St. Michael’s, I am the man. I claim to be the instigator of thehigh crime (as the slaveholders regard it) and I kept life in it, until lifecould be kept in it no longer.Pending the time of our contemplated departure out of our Egypt, we met often bynight, and on every Sunday. At these meetings we talked the matter over; toldour hopes and fears, and the difficulties discovered or imagined; and, like menof sense, we counted the cost of the enterprise to which we were committingourselves.These meetings must have resembled, on a small scale, the meetings ofrevolutionary conspirators, in their primary condition. We were plotting againstour (so called) lawful rulers; with this difference that we sought our own good,and not the harm of our enemies. We did not seek to overthrow them, but toescape from them. As for Mr. Freeland, we all liked him, and would have gladlyremained with him, as freeman. LIBERTY was our aim; and we had now come to thinkthat we had a right to liberty, against every obstacle even against the lives ofour enslavers.We had several words, expressive of things, important to us, which weunderstood, but which, even if distinctly heard by an outsider, would convey nocertain meaning. I have reasons for suppressing these pass-words, which thereader will easily divine. I hated the secrecy; but where slavery is powerful,and liberty is weak, the latter is driven to concealment or to destruction.The prospect was not always a bright one. At times, we were almost tempted toabandon the enterprise, and to get back to that comparative peace of mind, whicheven a man under the gallows might feel, when all hope of escape had vanished.Quiet bondage was felt to be better than the doubts, fears and uncertainties,which now so sadly perplexed and disturbed us.The infirmities of humanity, generally, were represented in our little band. Wewere confident, bold and determined, at times; and, again, doubting, timid andwavering; whistling, like the boy in the graveyard, to keep away the spirits.To look at the map, and observe the proximity of Eastern Shore, Maryland, toDelaware and Pennsylvania, it may seem to the reader quite absurd, to regard theproposed escape as a formidable undertaking. But to understand, some one hassaid a man must stand under. The real distance was great enough, but theimagined distance was, to our ignorance, even greater. Every slaveholder seeksto impress his slave with a belief in the boundlessness of slave territory, andof his own almost illimitable power. We all had vague and indistinct notions ofthe geography of the country.The distance, however, is not the chief trouble. The nearer are the lines of aslave state and the borders of a free one, the greater the peril. Hiredkidnappers infest these borders. Then, too, we knew that merely reaching a freestate did not free us; that, wherever caught, we could be returned to slavery.We could see no spot on this side the ocean, where we could be free. We hadheard of Canada, the real Canaan of the American bondmen, simply as a country towhich the wild goose and the swan repaired at the end of winter, to escape theheat of summer, but not as the home of man. I knew something of theology, butnothing of geography. I really did not, at that time, know that there was astate of New York, or a state of Massachusetts. I had heard of Pennsylvania,Delaware and New Jersey, and all the southern states, but was ignorant of thefree states, generally. New York city was our northern limit, and to go there,and be forever harassed with the liability of being hunted down and returned toslavery—with the certainty of being treated ten times worse than we had everbeen treated before was a prospect far from delightful, and it might well causesome hesitation about engaging in the enterprise. The case, sometimes, to ourexcited visions, stood thus: At every gate through which we had to pass, we sawa watchman; at every ferry, a guard; on every bridge, a sentinel; and in everywood, a patrol or slave-hunter. We were hemmed in on every side. The good to besought, and the evil to be shunned, were flung in the balance, and weighedagainst each other. On the one hand, there stood slavery; a stern reality,glaring frightfully upon us, with the blood of millions in his pollutedskirts—terrible to behold—greedily devouring our hard earnings and feedinghimself upon our flesh. Here was the evil from which to escape. On the otherhand, far away, back in the hazy distance, where all forms seemed but shadows,under the flickering light of the north star—behind some craggy hill orsnow-covered mountain—stood a doubtful freedom, half frozen, beckoning us to hericy domain. This was the good to be sought. The inequality was as great as thatbetween certainty and uncertainty. This, in itself, was enough to stagger us;but when we came to survey the untrodden road, and conjecture the many possibledifficulties, we were appalled, and at times, as I have said, were upon thepoint of giving over the struggle altogether.The reader can have little idea of the phantoms of trouble which flit, in suchcircumstances, before the uneducated mind of the slave. Upon either side, we sawgrim death assuming a variety of horrid shapes. Now, it was starvation, causingus, in a strange and friendless land, to eat our own flesh. Now, we werecontending with the waves (for our journey was in part by water) and weredrowned. Now, we were hunted by dogs, and overtaken and torn to pieces by theirmerciless fangs. We were stung by scorpions—chased by wild beasts—bitten bysnakes; and, worst of all, after having succeeded in swimmingrivers—encountering wild beasts—sleeping in the woods—suffering hunger, cold,heat and nakedness—we supposed ourselves to be overtaken by hired kidnappers,who, in the name of the law, and for their thrice accursed reward, would,perchance, fire upon us—kill some, wound others, and capture all. This darkpicture, drawn by ignorance and fear, at times greatly shook our determination,and not unfrequently caused us to"},{"pageContent":" Rather bear those ills we had Than fly to others which we knew not of.I am not disposed to magnify this circumstance in my experience, and yet I thinkI shall seem to be so disposed, to the reader. No man can tell the intense agonywhich is felt by the slave, when wavering on the point of making his escape. Allthat he has is at stake; and even that which he has not, is at stake, also. Thelife which he has, may be lost, and the liberty which he seeks, may not begained.Patrick Henry, to a listening senate, thrilled by his magic eloquence, and readyto stand by him in his boldest flights, could say, GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE MEDEATH, and this saying was a sublime one, even for a freeman; but, incomparablymore sublime, is the same sentiment, when practically asserted by men accustomedto the lash and chain—men whose sensibilities must have become more or lessdeadened by their bondage. With us it was a doubtful liberty, at best, that wesought; and a certain, lingering death in the rice swamps and sugar fields, ifwe failed. Life is not lightly regarded by men of sane minds. It is precious,alike to the pauper and to the prince—to the slave, and to his master; and yet,I believe there was not one among us, who would not rather have been shot down,than pass away life in hopeless bondage.In the progress of our preparations, Sandy, the root man, became troubled. Hebegan to have dreams, and some of them were very distressing. One of these,which happened on a Friday night, was, to him, of great significance; and I amquite ready to confess, that I felt somewhat damped by it myself. He said, “Idreamed, last night, that I was roused from sleep, by strange noises, like thevoices of a swarm of angry birds, that caused a roar as they passed, which fellupon my ear like a coming gale over the tops of the trees. Looking up to seewhat it could mean,” said Sandy, “I saw you, Frederick, in the claws of a hugebird, surrounded by a large number of birds, of all colors and sizes. These wereall picking at you, while you, with your arms, seemed to be trying to protectyour eyes. Passing over me, the birds flew in a south-westerly direction, and Iwatched them until they were clean out of sight. Now, I saw this as plainly as Inow see you; and furder, honey, watch de Friday night dream; dare is sumpon init, shose you born; dare is, indeed, honey.”I confess I did not like this dream; but I threw off concern about it, byattributing it to the general excitement and perturbation consequent upon ourcontemplated plan of escape. I could not, however, shake off its effect at once.I felt that it boded me no good. Sandy was unusually emphatic and oracular, andhis manner had much to do with the impression made upon me.The plan of escape which I recommended, and to which my comrades assented, wasto take a large canoe, owned by Mr. Hamilton, and, on the Saturday nightprevious to the Easter holidays, launch out into the Chesapeake bay, and paddlefor its head—a distance of seventy miles with all our might. Our course, onreaching this point, was, to turn the canoe adrift, and bend our steps towardthe north star, till we reached a free state.There were several objections to this plan. One was, the danger from gales onthe bay. In rough weather, the waters of the Chesapeake are much agitated, andthere is danger, in a canoe, of being swamped by the waves. Another objectionwas, that the canoe would soon be missed; the absent persons would, at once, besuspected of having taken it; and we should be pursued by some of the fastsailing bay craft out of St. Michael’s. Then, again, if we reached the head ofthe bay, and turned the canoe adrift, she might prove a guide to our track, andbring the land hunters after us.These and other objections were set aside, by the stronger ones which could beurged against every other plan that could then be suggested. On the water, wehad a chance of being regarded as fishermen, in the service of a master. On theother hand, by taking the land route, through the counties adjoining Delaware,we should be subjected to all manner of interruptions, and many verydisagreeable questions, which might give us serious trouble. Any white man isauthorized to stop a man of color, on any road, and examine him, and arrest him,if he so desires.By this arrangement, many abuses (considered such even by slaveholders) occur.Cases have been known, where freemen have been called upon to show their freepapers, by a pack of ruffians—and, on the presentation of the papers, theruffians have torn them up, and seized their victim, and sold him to a life ofendless bondage.The week before our intended start, I wrote a pass for each of our party, givingthem permission to visit Baltimore, during the Easter holidays. The pass ranafter this manner: This is to certify, that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my servant, John, full liberty to go to Baltimore, to spend the Easter holidays.   W.H. Near St. Michael’s, Talbot county, MarylandAlthough we were not going to Baltimore, and were intending to land east ofNorth Point, in the direction where I had seen the Philadelphia steamers go,these passes might be made useful to us in the lower part of the bay, whilesteering toward Baltimore. These were not, however, to be shown by us, until allother answers failed to satisfy the inquirer. We were all fully alive to theimportance of being calm and self-possessed, when accosted, if accosted weshould be; and we more times than one rehearsed to each other how we shouldbehave in the hour of trial.These were long, tedious days and nights. The suspense was painful, in theextreme. To balance probabilities, where life and liberty hang on the result,requires steady nerves. I panted for action, and was glad when the day, at theclose of which we were to start, dawned upon us. Sleeping, the night before, wasout of the question. I probably felt more deeply than any of my companions,because I was the instigator of the movement. The responsibility of the wholeenterprise rested on my shoulders. The glory of success, and the shame andconfusion of failure, could not be matters of indifference to me. Our food wasprepared; our clothes were packed up; we were all ready to go, and impatient forSaturday morning—considering that the last morning of our bondage.I cannot describe the tempest and tumult of my brain, that morning. The readerwill please to bear in mind, that, in a slave state, an unsuccessful runaway isnot only subjected to cruel torture, and sold away to the far south, but he isfrequently execrated by the other slaves. He is charged with making thecondition of the other slaves intolerable, by laying them all under thesuspicion of their masters—subjecting them to greater vigilance, and imposinggreater limitations on their privileges. I dreaded murmurs from this quarter. Itis difficult, too, for a slavemaster to believe that slaves escaping have notbeen aided in their flight by some one of their fellow slaves. When, therefore,a slave is missing, every slave on the place is closely examined as to hisknowledge of the undertaking; and they are sometimes even tortured, to make themdisclose what they are suspected of knowing of such escape.Our anxiety grew more and more intense, as the time of our intended departurefor the north drew nigh. It was truly felt to be a matter of life and death withus; and we fully intended to fight as well as run, if necessity should occur forthat extremity. But the trial hour was not yet to come. It was easy to resolve,but not so easy to act. I expected there might be some drawing back, at thelast. It was natural that there should be; therefore, during the interveningtime, I lost no opportunity to explain away difficulties, to remove doubts, todispel fears, and to inspire all with firmness. It was too late to look back;and now was the time to go forward. Like most other men, we had done the talkingpart of our work, long and well; and the time had come to act as if we were inearnest, and meant to be as true in action as in words. I did not forget toappeal to the pride of my comrades, by telling them that, if after havingsolemnly promised to go, as they had done, they now failed to make the attempt,they would, in effect, brand themselves with cowardice, and might as well sitdown, fold their arms, and acknowledge themselves as fit only to be slaves. Thisdetestable character, all were unwilling to assume. Every man except Sandy (he,much to our regret, withdrew) stood firm; and at our last meeting we pledgedourselves afresh, and in the most solemn manner, that, at the time appointed, wewould certainly start on our long journey for a free country. This meeting wasin the middle of the week, at the end of which we were to start.Early that morning we went, as usual, to the field, but with hearts that beatquickly and anxiously. Any one intimately acquainted with us, might have seenthat all was not well with us, and that some monster lingered in our thoughts.Our work that morning was the same as it had been for several days past—drawingout and spreading manure. While thus engaged, I had a sudden presentiment, whichflashed upon me like lightning in a dark night, revealing to the lonely travelerthe gulf before, and the enemy behind. I instantly turned to Sandy Jenkins, whowas near me, and said to him, “Sandy, we are betrayed; something has just toldme so.” I felt as sure of it, as if the officers were there in sight. Sandysaid, “Man, dat is strange; but I feel just as you do.” If my mother—then longin her grave—had appeared before me, and told me that we were betrayed, I couldnot, at that moment, have felt more certain of the fact.In a few minutes after this, the long, low and distant notes of the hornsummoned us from the field to breakfast. I felt as one may be supposed to feelbefore being led forth to be executed for some great offense. I wanted nobreakfast; but I went with the other slaves toward the house, for form’s sake.My feelings were not disturbed as to the right of running away; on that point Ihad no trouble, whatever. My anxiety arose from a sense of the consequences offailure.In thirty minutes after that vivid presentiment came the apprehended crash. Onreaching the house, for breakfast, and glancing my eye toward the lane gate, theworst was at once made known. The lane gate off Mr. Freeland’s house, is nearlya half mile from the door, and shaded by the heavy wood which bordered the mainroad. I was, however, able to descry four white men, and two colored men,approaching. The white men were on horseback, and the colored men were walkingbehind, and seemed to be tied. “It is all over with us,” thought I, “we aresurely betrayed.” I now became composed, or at least comparatively so, andcalmly awaited the result. I watched the ill-omened company, till I saw thementer the gate. Successful flight was impossible, and I made up my mind tostand, and meet the evil, whatever it might be; for I was not without a slighthope that things might turn differently from what I at first expected. In a fewmoments, in came Mr. William Hamilton, riding very rapidly, and evidently muchexcited. He was in the habit of riding very slowly, and was seldom known togallop his horse. This time, his horse was nearly at full speed, causing thedust to roll thick behind him. Mr. Hamilton, though one of the most resolute menin the whole neighborhood, was, nevertheless, a remarkably mild spoken man; and,even when greatly excited, his language was cool and circumspect. He came to thedoor, and inquired if Mr. Freeland was in. I told him that Mr. Freeland was atthe barn. Off the old gentleman rode, toward the barn, with unwonted speed.Mary, the cook, was at a loss to know what was the matter, and I did not professany skill in making her understand. I knew she would have united, as readily asany one, in cursing me for bringing trouble into the family; so I held my peace,leaving matters to develop themselves, without my assistance. In a few moments,Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland came down from the barn to the house; and, just asthey made their appearance in the front yard, three men (who proved to beconstables) came dashing into the lane, on horseback, as if summoned by a signrequiring quick work. A few seconds brought them into the front yard, where theyhastily dismounted, and tied their horses. This done, they joined Mr. Freelandand Mr. Hamilton, who were standing a short distance from the kitchen. A fewmoments were spent, as if in consulting how to proceed, and then the whole partywalked up to the kitchen door. There was now no one in the kitchen but myselfand John Harris. Henry and Sandy were yet at the barn. Mr. Freeland came insidethe kitchen door, and with an agitated voice, called me by name, and told me tocome forward; that there was some gentlemen who wished to see me. I steppedtoward them, at the door, and asked what they wanted, when the constablesgrabbed me, and told me that I had better not resist; that I had been in ascrape, or was said to have been in one; that they were merely going to take mewhere I could be examined; that they were going to carry me to St. Michael’s, tohave me brought before my master. They further said, that, in case the evidenceagainst me was not true, I should be acquitted. I was now firmly tied, andcompletely at the mercy of my captors. Resistance was idle. They were five innumber, armed to the very teeth. When they had secured me, they next turned toJohn Harris, and, in a few moments, succeeded in tying him as firmly as they hadalready tied me. They next turned toward Henry Harris, who had now returned fromthe barn. “Cross your hands,” said the constables, to Henry. “I won’t” saidHenry, in a voice so firm and clear, and in a manner so determined, as for amoment to arrest all proceedings. “Won’t you cross your hands?” said Tom Graham,the constable. “No I won’t,” said Henry, with increasing emphasis. Mr. Hamilton,Mr. Freeland, and the officers, now came near to Henry. Two of the constablesdrew out their shining pistols, and swore by the name of God, that he shouldcross his hands, or they would shoot him down. Each of these hired ruffians nowcocked their pistols, and, with fingers apparently on the triggers, presentedtheir deadly weapons to the breast of the unarmed slave, saying, at the sametime, if he did not cross his hands, they would “blow his d—d heart out of him.”“Shoot! shoot me!” said Henry. “You can’t kill me but once. Shoot!—shoot! and bed—d. I won’t be tied.” This, the brave fellow said in a voice as defiant andheroic in its tone, as was the language itself; and, at the moment of sayingthis, with the pistols at his very breast, he quickly raised his arms, anddashed them from the puny hands of his assassins, the weapons flying in oppositedirections. Now came the struggle. All hands was now rushed upon the bravefellow, and, after beating him for some time, they succeeded in overpowering andtying him. Henry put me to shame; he fought, and fought bravely. John and I hadmade no resistance. The fact is, I never see much use in fighting, unless thereis a reasonable probability of whipping somebody. Yet there was something almostprovidential in the resistance made by the gallant Henry. But for thatresistance, every soul of us would have been hurried off to the far south. Justa moment previous to the trouble with Henry, Mr. Hamilton mildly said—and thisgave me the unmistakable clue to the cause of our arrest—“Perhaps we had nowbetter make a search for those protections, which we understand Frederick haswritten for himself and the rest.” Had these passes been found, they would havebeen point blank proof against us, and would have confirmed all the statementsof our betrayer. Thanks to the resistance of Henry, the excitement produced bythe scuffle drew all attention in that direction, and I succeeded in flinging mypass, unobserved, into the fire. The confusion attendant upon the scuffle, andthe apprehension of further trouble, perhaps, led our captors to forego, for thepresent, any search for “those protections” which Frederick was said to havewritten for his companions; so we were not yet convicted of the purpose to runaway; and it was evident that there was some doubt, on the part of all, whetherwe had been guilty of such a purpose.Just as we were all completely tied, and about ready to start toward St.Michael’s, and thence to jail, Mrs. Betsey Freeland (mother to William, who wasvery much attached—after the southern fashion—to Henry and John, they havingbeen reared from childhood in her house) came to the kitchen door, with herhands full of biscuits—for we had not had time to take our breakfast thatmorning—and divided them between Henry and John. This done, the lady made thefollowing parting address to me, looking and pointing her bony finger at me.“You devil! you yellow devil! It was you that put it into the heads of Henry andJohn to run away. But for you, you long legged yellow devil, Henry and Johnwould never have thought of running away.” I gave the lady a look, which calledforth a scream of mingled wrath and terror, as she slammed the kitchen door, andwent in, leaving me, with the rest, in hands as harsh as her own broken voice.Could the kind reader have been quietly riding along the main road to or fromEaston, that morning, his eye would have met a painful sight. He would have seenfive young men, guilty of no crime, save that of preferring liberty to a life ofbondage, drawn along the public highway—firmly bound together—tramping throughdust and heat, bare-footed and bare-headed—fastened to three strong horses,whose riders were armed to the teeth, with pistols and daggers—on their way toprison, like felons, and suffering every possible insult from the crowds ofidle, vulgar people, who clustered around, and heartlessly made their failurethe occasion for all manner of ribaldry and sport. As I looked upon this crowdof vile persons, and saw myself and friends thus assailed and persecuted, Icould not help seeing the fulfillment of Sandy’s dream. I was in the hands ofmoral vultures, and firmly held in their sharp talons, and was hurried awaytoward Easton, in a south-easterly direction, amid the jeers of new birds of thesame feather, through every neighborhood we passed. It seemed to me (and thisshows the good understanding between the slaveholders and their allies) thatevery body we met knew the cause of our arrest, and were out, awaiting ourpassing by, to feast their vindictive eyes on our misery and to gloat over ourruin. Some said, I ought to be hanged, and others, I ought to be burnt, others,I ought to have the “hide” taken from my back; while no one gave us a kind wordor sympathizing look, except the poor slaves, who were lifting their heavy hoes,and who cautiously glanced at us through the post-and-rail fences, behind whichthey were at work. Our sufferings, that morning, can be more easily imaginedthan described. Our hopes were all blasted, at a blow. The cruel injustice, thevictorious crime, and the helplessness of innocence, led me to ask, in myignorance and weakness “Where now is the God of justice and mercy? And why havethese wicked men the power thus to trample upon our rights, and to insult ourfeelings?” And yet, in the next moment, came the consoling thought, “The day ofoppressor will come at last.” Of one thing I could be glad—not one of my dearfriends, upon whom I had brought this great calamity, either by word or look,reproached me for having led them into it. We were a band of brothers, and neverdearer to each other than now. The thought which gave us the most pain, was theprobable separation which would now take place, in case we were sold off to thefar south, as we were likely to be. While the constables were looking forward,Henry and I, being fastened together, could occasionally exchange a word,without being observed by the kidnappers who had us in charge. “What shall I dowith my pass?” said Henry. “Eat it with your biscuit,” said I; “it won’t do totear it up.” We were now near St. Michael’s. The direction concerning the passeswas passed around, and executed. “Own nothing!” said I. “Own nothing!” waspassed around and enjoined, and assented to. Our confidence in each other wasunshaken; and we were quite resolved to succeed or fail together—as much afterthe calamity which had befallen us, as before.On reaching St. Michael’s, we underwent a sort of examination at my master’sstore, and it was evident to my mind, that Master Thomas suspected thetruthfulness of the evidence upon which they had acted in arresting us; and thathe only affected, to some extent, the positiveness with which he asserted ourguilt. There was nothing said by any of our company, which could, in any manner,prejudice our cause; and there was hope, yet, that we should be able to returnto our homes—if for nothing else, at least to find out the guilty man or womanwho had betrayed us.To this end, we all denied that we had been guilty of intended flight. MasterThomas said that the evidence he had of our intention to run away, was strongenough to hang us, in a case of murder. “But,” said I, “the cases are not equal.If murder were committed, some one must have committed it—the thing is done! Inour case, nothing has been done! We have not run away. Where is the evidenceagainst us? We were quietly at our work.” I talked thus, with unusual freedom,to bring out the evidence against us, for we all wanted, above all things, toknow the guilty wretch who had betrayed us, that we might have somethingtangible upon which to pour the execrations. From something which dropped, inthe course of the talk, it appeared that there was but one witness againstus—and that that witness could not be produced. Master Thomas would not tell uswho his informant was; but we suspected, and suspected one person only. Severalcircumstances seemed to point SANDY out, as our betrayer. His entire knowledgeof our plans his participation in them—his withdrawal from us—his dream, and hissimultaneous presentiment that we were betrayed—the taking us, and the leavinghim—were calculated to turn suspicion toward him; and yet, we could not suspecthim. We all loved him too well to think it possible that he could have betrayedus. So we rolled the guilt on other shoulders.We were literally dragged, that morning, behind horses, a distance of fifteenmiles, and placed in the Easton jail. We were glad to reach the end of ourjourney, for our pathway had been the scene of insult and mortification. Such isthe power of public opinion, that it is hard, even for the innocent, to feel thehappy consolations of innocence, when they fall under the maledictions of thispower. How could we regard ourselves as in the right, when all about usdenounced us as criminals, and had the power and the disposition to treat us assuch.In jail, we were placed under the care of Mr. Joseph Graham, the sheriff of thecounty. Henry, and John, and myself, were placed in one room, and Henry Bailyand Charles Roberts, in another, by themselves. This separation was intended todeprive us of the advantage of concert, and to prevent trouble in jail.Once shut up, a new set of tormentors came upon us. A swarm of imps, in humanshape the slave-traders, deputy slave-traders, and agents of slave-traders—thatgather in every country town of the state, watching for chances to buy humanflesh (as buzzards to eat carrion) flocked in upon us, to ascertain if ourmasters had placed us in jail to be sold. Such a set of debased and villainouscreatures, I never saw before, and hope never to see again. I felt myselfsurrounded as by a pack of fiends, fresh from perdition. They laughed, leered,and grinned at us; saying, “Ah! boys, we’ve got you, havn’t we? So you wereabout to make your escape? Where were you going to?” After taunting us, andpeering at us, as long as they liked, they one by one subjected us to anexamination, with a view to ascertain our value; feeling our arms and legs, andshaking us by the shoulders to see if we were sound and healthy; impudentlyasking us, “how we would like to have them for masters?” To such questions, wewere, very much to their annoyance, quite dumb, disdaining to answer them. Forone, I detested the whisky-bloated gamblers in human flesh; and I believe I wasas much detested by them in turn. One fellow told me, “if he had me, he wouldcut the devil out of me pretty quick.”These Negro buyers are very offensive to the genteel southern Christian public.They are looked upon, in respectable Maryland society, as necessary, butdetestable characters. As a class, they are hardened ruffians, made such bynature and by occupation. Their ears are made quite familiar with the agonizingcry of outraged and woe-smitted humanity. Their eyes are forever open to humanmisery. They walk amid desecrated affections, insulted virtue, and blastedhopes. They have grown intimate with vice and blood; they gloat over the wildestillustrations of their soul-damning and earth-polluting business, and are moralpests. Yes; they are a legitimate fruit of slavery; and it is a puzzle to makeout a case of greater villainy for them, than for the slaveholders, who makesuch a class possible. They are mere hucksters of the surplus slave produce ofMaryland and Virginia coarse, cruel, and swaggering bullies, whose verybreathing is of blasphemy and blood.Aside from these slave-buyers, who infested the prison, from time to time, ourquarters were much more comfortable than we had any right to expect they wouldbe. Our allowance of food was small and coarse, but our room was the best in thejail—neat and spacious, and with nothing about it necessarily reminding us ofbeing in prison, but its heavy locks and bolts and the black, iron lattice-workat the windows. We were prisoners of state, compared with most slaves who areput into that Easton jail. But the place was not one of contentment. Bolts, barsand grated windows are not acceptable to freedom-loving people of any color. Thesuspense, too, was painful. Every step on the stairway was listened to, in thehope that the comer would cast a ray of light on our fate. We would have giventhe hair off our heads for half a dozen words with one of the waiters in Sol.Lowe’s hotel. Such waiters were in the way of hearing, at the table, theprobable course of things. We could see them flitting about in their whitejackets in front of this hotel, but could speak to none of them.Soon after the holidays were over, contrary to all our expectations, Messrs.Hamilton and Freeland came up to Easton; not to make a bargain with the “Georgiatraders,” nor to send us up to Austin Woldfolk, as is usual in the case ofrun-away salves, but to release Charles, Henry Harris, Henry Baily and JohnHarris, from prison, and this, too, without the infliction of a single blow. Iwas now left entirely alone in prison. The innocent had been taken, and theguilty left. My friends were separated from me, and apparently forever. Thiscircumstance caused me more pain than any other incident connected with ourcapture and imprisonment. Thirty-nine lashes on my naked and bleeding back,would have been joyfully borne, in preference to this separation from these, thefriends of my youth. And yet, I could not but feel that I was the victim ofsomething like justice. Why should these young men, who were led into thisscheme by me, suffer as much as the instigator? I felt glad that they wereleased from prison, and from the dread prospect of a life (or death I shouldrather say) in the rice swamps. It is due to the noble Henry, to say, that heseemed almost as reluctant to leave the prison with me in it, as he was to betied and dragged to prison. But he and the rest knew that we should, in all thelikelihoods of the case, be separated, in the event of being sold; and since wewere now completely in the hands of our owners, we all concluded it would bebest to go peaceably home.Not until this last separation, dear reader, had I touched those profounderdepths of desolation, which it is the lot of slaves often to reach. I wassolitary in the world, and alone within the walls of a stone prison, left to afate of life-long misery. I had hoped and expected much, for months before, butmy hopes and expectations were now withered and blasted. The ever dreaded slavelife in Georgia, Louisiana and Alabama—from which escape is next to impossiblenow, in my loneliness, stared me in the face. The possibility of ever becominganything but an abject slave, a mere machine in the hands of an owner, had nowfled, and it seemed to me it had fled forever. A life of living death, besetwith the innumerable horrors of the cotton field, and the sugar plantation,seemed to be my doom. The fiends, who rushed into the prison when we were firstput there, continued to visit me, and to ply me with questions and with theirtantalizing remarks. I was insulted, but helpless; keenly alive to the demandsof justice and liberty, but with no means of asserting them. To talk to thoseimps about justice and mercy, would have been as absurd as to reason with bearsand tigers. Lead and steel are the only arguments that they understand.After remaining in this life of misery and despair about a week, which, by theway, seemed a month, Master Thomas, very much to my surprise, and greatly to myrelief, came to the prison, and took me out, for the purpose, as he said, ofsending me to Alabama, with a friend of his, who would emancipate me at the endof eight years. I was glad enough to get out of prison; but I had no faith inthe story that this friend of Capt. Auld would emancipate me, at the end of thetime indicated. Besides, I never had heard of his having a friend in Alabama,and I took the announcement, simply as an easy and comfortable method ofshipping me off to the far south. There was a little scandal, too, connectedwith the idea of one Christian selling another to the Georgia traders, while itwas deemed every way proper for them to sell to others. I thought this friend inAlabama was an invention, to meet this difficulty, for Master Thomas was quitejealous of his Christian reputation, however unconcerned he might be about hisreal Christian character. In these remarks, however, it is possible that I doMaster Thomas Auld injustice. He certainly did not exhaust his power upon me, inthe case, but acted, upon the whole, very generously, considering the nature ofmy offense. He had the power and the provocation to send me, without reserve,into the very everglades of Florida, beyond the remotest hope of emancipation;and his refusal to exercise that power, must be set down to his credit.After lingering about St. Michael’s a few days, and no friend from Alabamamaking his appearance, to take me there, Master Thomas decided to send me backagain to Baltimore, to live with his brother Hugh, with whom he was now atpeace; possibly he became so by his profession of religion, at the camp-meetingin the Bay Side. Master Thomas told me that he wished me to go to Baltimore, andlearn a trade; and that, if I behaved myself properly, he would emancipate me attwenty-five! Thanks for this one beam of hope in the future. The promise had butone fault; it seemed too good to be true.CHAPTER XX. APPRENTICESHIP LIFENOTHING LOST BY THE ATTEMPT TO RUN AWAY—COMRADES IN THEIR OLDHOMES—REASONS FOR SENDING ME AWAY—RETURN TO BALTIMORE—CONTRASTBETWEEN TOMMY AND THAT OF HIS COLORED COMPANION—TRIALS IN GARDINER’SSHIP YARD—DESPERATE FIGHT—ITS CAUSES—CONFLICT BETWEEN WHITE AND BLACKLABOR—DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTRAGE—COLORED TESTIMONY NOTHING—CONDUCT OFMASTER HUGH—SPIRIT OF SLAVERY IN BALTIMORE—MY CONDITION IMPROVES—NEWASSOCIATIONS—SLAVEHOLDER’S RIGHT TO TAKE HIS WAGES—HOW TO MAKE ACONTENTED SLAVE.Well! dear reader, I am not, as you may have already inferred, a loser by thegeneral upstir, described in the foregoing chapter. The little domesticrevolution, notwithstanding the sudden snub it got by the treachery ofsomebody—I dare not say or think who—did not, after all, end so disastrously, aswhen in the iron cage at Easton, I conceived it would. The prospect, from thatpoint, did look about as dark as any that ever cast its gloom over the vision ofthe anxious, out-looking, human spirit. “All is well that ends well.” Myaffectionate comrades, Henry and John Harris, are still with Mr. WilliamFreeland. Charles Roberts and Henry Baily are safe at their homes. I have not,therefore, any thing to regret on their account. Their masters have mercifullyforgiven them, probably on the ground suggested in the spirited little speech ofMrs. Freeland, made to me just before leaving for the jail—namely: that they hadbeen allured into the wicked scheme of making their escape, by me; and that, butfor me, they would never have dreamed of a thing so shocking! My friends hadnothing to regret, either; for while they were watched more closely on accountof what had happened, they were, doubtless, treated more kindly than before, andgot new assurances that they would be legally emancipated, some day, providedtheir behavior should make them deserving, from that time forward. Not a blow,as I learned, was struck any one of them. As for Master William Freeland, good,unsuspecting soul, he did not believe that we were intending to run away at all.Having given—as he thought—no occasion to his boys to leave him, he could notthink it probable that they had entertained a design so grievous. This, however,was not the view taken of the matter by “Mas’ Billy,” as we used to call thesoft spoken, but crafty and resolute Mr. William Hamilton. He had no doubt thatthe crime had been meditated; and regarding me as the instigator of it, hefrankly told Master Thomas that he must remove me from that neighborhood, or hewould shoot me down. He would not have one so dangerous as “Frederick” tamperingwith his slaves. William Hamilton was not a man whose threat might be safelydisregarded. I have no doubt that he would have proved as good as his word, hadthe warning given not been promptly taken. He was furious at the thought of sucha piece of high-handed theft, as we were about to perpetrate the stealing of ourown bodies and souls! The feasibility of the plan, too, could the first stepshave been taken, was marvelously plain. Besides, this was a new idea, this useof the bay. Slaves escaping, until now, had taken to the woods; they had neverdreamed of profaning and abusing the waters of the noble Chesapeake, by makingthem the highway from slavery to freedom. Here was a broad road of destructionto slavery, which, before, had been looked upon as a wall of security byslaveholders. But Master Billy could not get Mr. Freeland to see mattersprecisely as he did; nor could he get Master Thomas so excited as he washimself. The latter—I must say it to his credit—showed much humane feeling inhis part of the transaction, and atoned for much that had been harsh, cruel andunreasonable in his former treatment of me and others. His clemency was quiteunusual and unlooked for. “Cousin Tom” told me that while I was in jail, MasterThomas was very unhappy; and that the night before his going up to release me,he had walked the floor nearly all night, evincing great distress; that verytempting offers had been made to him, by the Negro-traders, but he had rejectedthem all, saying that money could not tempt him to sell me to the far south. Allthis I can easily believe, for he seemed quite reluctant to send me away, atall. He told me that he only consented to do so, because of the very strongprejudice against me in the neighborhood, and that he feared for my safety if Iremained there.Thus, after three years spent in the country, roughing it in the field, andexperiencing all sorts of hardships, I was again permitted to return toBaltimore, the very place, of all others, short of a free state, where I mostdesired to live. The three years spent in the country, had made some differencein me, and in the household of Master Hugh. “Little Tommy” was no longer littleTommy; and I was not the slender lad who had left for the Eastern Shore justthree years before. The loving relations between me and Mas’ Tommy were brokenup. He was no longer dependent on me for protection, but felt himself a man,with other and more suitable associates. In childhood, he scarcely considered meinferior to himself certainly, as good as any other boy with whom he played; butthe time had come when his friend must become his slave. So we were cold, and weparted. It was a sad thing to me, that, loving each other as we had done, wemust now take different roads. To him, a thousand avenues were open. Educationhad made him acquainted with all the treasures of the world, and liberty hadflung open the gates thereunto; but I, who had attended him seven years, and hadwatched over him with the care of a big brother, fighting his battles in thestreet, and shielding him from harm, to an extent which had induced his motherto say, “Oh! Tommy is always safe, when he is with Freddy,” must be confined toa single condition. He could grow, and become a MAN; I could grow, though Icould not become a man, but must remain, all my life, a minor—a mere boy. ThomasAuld, Junior, obtained a situation on board the brig “Tweed,” and went to sea. Iknow not what has become of him; he certainly has my good wishes for his welfareand prosperity. There were few persons to whom I was more sincerely attachedthan to him, and there are few in the world I would be more pleased to meet.Very soon after I went to Baltimore to live, Master Hugh succeeded in getting mehired to Mr. William Gardiner, an extensive ship builder on Fell’s Point. I wasplaced here to learn to calk, a trade of which I already had some knowledge,gained while in Mr. Hugh Auld’s ship-yard, when he was a master builder.Gardiner’s, however, proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishment ofthat object. Mr. Gardiner was, that season, engaged in building two largeman-of-war vessels, professedly for the Mexican government. These vessels wereto be launched in the month of July, of that year, and, in failure thereof, Mr.G. would forfeit a very considerable sum of money. So, when I entered theship-yard, all was hurry and driving. There were in the yard about one hundredmen; of these about seventy or eighty were regular carpenters—privileged men.Speaking of my condition here I wrote, years ago—and I have now no reason tovary the picture as follows:There was no time to learn any thing. Every man had to do that which he knew howto do. In entering the ship-yard, my orders from Mr. Gardiner were, to dowhatever the carpenters commanded me to do. This was placing me at the beck andcall of about seventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters. Their wordwas to be my law. My situation was a most trying one. At times I needed a dozenpair of hands. I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute. Threeor four voices would strike my ear at the same moment. It was—“Fred., come helpme to cant this timber here.” “Fred., come carry this timber yonder.”—“Fred.,bring that roller here.”—“Fred., go get a fresh can of water.”—“Fred., come helpsaw off the end of this timber.”—“Fred., go quick and get the crow bar.”—“Fred.,hold on the end of this fall.”—“Fred., go to the blacksmith’s shop, and get anew punch.”—“Hurra, Fred.! run and bring me a cold chisel.”—“I say, Fred., bear a hand, andget up a fire as quick as lightning under that steam-box.”—“Halloo, nigger!come, turn this grindstone.”—“Come, come! move, move! and bowse this timberforward.”—“I say, darkey, blast your eyes, why don’t you heat up somepitch?”—“Halloo! halloo! halloo!” (Three voices at the same time.) “Comehere!—Go there!—Hold on where you are! D—n you, if you move, I’ll knock yourbrains out!”Such, dear reader, is a glance at the school which was mine, during, the firsteight months of my stay at Baltimore. At the end of the eight months, MasterHugh refused longer to allow me to remain with Mr. Gardiner. The circumstancewhich led to his taking me away, was a brutal outrage, committed upon me by thewhite apprentices of the ship-yard. The fight was a desperate one, and I cameout of it most shockingly mangled. I was cut and bruised in sundry places, andmy left eye was nearly knocked out of its socket. The facts, leading to thisbarbarous outrage upon me, illustrate a phase of slavery destined to become animportant element in the overthrow of the slave system, and I may, thereforestate them with some minuteness. That phase is this: the conflict of slaverywith the interests of the white mechanics and laborers of the south. In thecountry, this conflict is not so apparent; but, in cities, such as Baltimore,Richmond, New Orleans, Mobile, &c., it is seen pretty clearly. The slaveholders,with a craftiness peculiar to themselves, by encouraging the enmity of the poor,laboring white man against the blacks, succeeds in making the said white manalmost as much a slave as the black slave himself. The difference between thewhite slave, and the black slave, is this: the latter belongs to oneslaveholder, and the former belongs to all the slaveholders, collectively. Thewhite slave has taken from him, by indirection, what the black slave has takenfrom him, directly, and without ceremony. Both are plundered, and by the sameplunderers. The slave is robbed, by his master, of all his earnings, above whatis required for his bare physical necessities; and the white man is robbed bythe slave system, of the just results of his labor, because he is flung intocompetition with a class of laborers who work without wages. The competition,and its injurious consequences, will, one day, array the nonslaveholding whitepeople of the slave states, against the slave system, and make them the mosteffective workers against the great evil. At present, the slaveholders blindthem to this competition, by keeping alive their prejudice against the slaves,as men—not against them as slaves. They appeal to their pride, often denouncingemancipation, as tending to place the white man, on an equality with Negroes,and, by this means, they succeed in drawing off the minds of the poor whitesfrom the real fact, that, by the rich slave-master, they are already regarded asbut a single remove from equality with the slave. The impression is cunninglymade, that slavery is the only power that can prevent the laboring white manfrom falling to the level of the slave’s poverty and degradation. To make thisenmity deep and broad, between the slave and the poor white man, the latter isallowed to abuse and whip the former, without hinderance. But—as I havesuggested—this state of facts prevails mostly in the country. In the city ofBaltimore, there are not unfrequent murmurs, that educating the slaves to bemechanics may, in the end, give slavemasters power to dispense with the servicesof the poor white man altogether. But, with characteristic dread of offendingthe slaveholders, these poor, white mechanics in Mr. Gardiner’sship-yard—instead of applying the natural, honest remedy for the apprehendedevil, and objecting at once to work there by the side of slaves—made a cowardlyattack upon the free colored mechanics, saying they were eating the bread whichshould be eaten by American freemen, and swearing that they would not work withthem. The feeling was, really, against having their labor brought intocompetition with that of the colored people at all; but it was too much tostrike directly at the interest of the slaveholders; and, therefore provingtheir servility and cowardice they dealt their blows on the poor, coloredfreeman, and aimed to prevent him from serving himself, in the evening of life,with the trade with which he had served his master, during the more vigorousportion of his days. Had they succeeded in driving the black freemen out of theship-yard, they would have determined also upon the removal of the black slaves.The feeling was very bitter toward all colored people in Baltimore, about thistime (1836), and they—free and slave suffered all manner of insult and wrong.Until a very little before I went there, white and black ship carpenters workedside by side, in the ship yards of Mr. Gardiner, Mr. Duncan, Mr. Walter Price,and Mr. Robb. Nobody seemed to see any impropriety in it. To outward seeming,all hands were well satisfied. Some of the blacks were first rate workmen, andwere given jobs requiring highest skill. All at once, however, the whitecarpenters knocked off, and swore that they would no longer work on the samestage with free Negroes. Taking advantage of the heavy contract resting upon Mr.Gardiner, to have the war vessels for Mexico ready to launch in July, and of thedifficulty of getting other hands at that season of the year, they swore theywould not strike another blow for him, unless he would discharge his freecolored workmen.Now, although this movement did not extend to me, in form, it did reach me, infact. The spirit which it awakened was one of malice and bitterness, towardcolored people generally, and I suffered with the rest, and suffered severely.My fellow apprentices very soon began to feel it to be degrading to work withme. They began to put on high looks, and to talk contemptuously and maliciouslyof “the Niggers;” saying, that “they would take the country,” that “they oughtto be killed.” Encouraged by the cowardly workmen, who, knowing me to be aslave, made no issue with Mr. Gardiner about my being there, these young men didtheir utmost to make it impossible for me to stay. They seldom called me to doany thing, without coupling the call with a curse, and Edward North, the biggestin every thing, rascality included, ventured to strike me, whereupon I pickedhim up, and threw him into the dock. Whenever any of them struck me, I struckback again, regardless of consequences. I could manage any of them singly, and,while I could keep them from combining, I succeeded very well. In the conflictwhich ended my stay at Mr. Gardiner’s, I was beset by four of them at once—NedNorth, Ned Hays, Bill Stewart, and Tom Humphreys. Two of them were as large asmyself, and they came near killing me, in broad day light. The attack was madesuddenly, and simultaneously. One came in front, armed with a brick; there wasone at each side, and one behind, and they closed up around me. I was struck onall sides; and, while I was attending to those in front, I received a blow on myhead, from behind, dealt with a heavy hand-spike. I was completely stunned bythe blow, and fell, heavily, on the ground, among the timbers. Taking advantageof my fall, they rushed upon me, and began to pound me with their fists. I letthem lay on, for a while, after I came to myself, with a view of gainingstrength. They did me little damage, so far; but, finally, getting tired of thatsport, I gave a sudden surge, and, despite their weight, I rose to my hands andknees. Just as I did this, one of their number (I know not which) planted a blowwith his boot in my left eye, which, for a time, seemed to have burst myeyeball. When they saw my eye completely closed, my face covered with blood, andI staggering under the stunning blows they had given me, they left me. As soonas I gathered sufficient strength, I picked up the hand-spike, and, madlyenough, attempted to pursue them; but here the carpenters interfered, andcompelled me to give up my frenzied pursuit. It was impossible to stand againstso many.Dear reader, you can hardly believe the statement, but it is true, and,therefore, I write it down: not fewer than fifty white men stood by, and sawthis brutal and shameless outrage committed, and not a man of them allinterposed a single word of mercy. There were four against one, and that one’sface was beaten and battered most horribly, and no one said, “that is enough;”but some cried out, “Kill him—kill him—kill the d—d nigger! knock his brainsout—he struck a white person.” I mention this inhuman outcry, to show thecharacter of the men, and the spirit of the times, at Gardiner’s ship yard, and,indeed, in Baltimore generally, in 1836. As I look back to this period, I amalmost amazed that I was not murdered outright, in that ship yard, so murderouswas the spirit which prevailed there. On two occasions, while there, I came nearlosing my life. I was driving bolts in the hold, through the keelson, with Hays.In its course, the bolt bent. Hays cursed me, and said that it was my blow whichbent the bolt. I denied this, and charged it upon him. In a fit of rage heseized an adze, and darted toward me. I met him with a maul, and parried hisblow, or I should have then lost my life. A son of old Tom Lanman (the latter’sdouble murder I have elsewhere charged upon him), in the spirit of his miserablefather, made an assault upon me, but the blow with his maul missed me. After theunited assault of North, Stewart, Hays and Humphreys, finding that thecarpenters were as bitter toward me as the apprentices, and that the latter wereprobably set on by the former, I found my only chances for life was in flight. Isucceeded in getting away, without an additional blow. To strike a white man,was death, by Lynch law, in Gardiner’s ship yard; nor was there much of anyother law toward colored people, at that time, in any other part of Maryland.The whole sentiment of Baltimore was murderous.After making my escape from the ship yard, I went straight home, and related thestory of the outrage to Master Hugh Auld; and it is due to him to say, that hisconduct—though he was not a religious man—was every way more humane than that ofhis brother, Thomas, when I went to the latter in a somewhat similar plight,from the hands of “Brother Edward Covey.” He listened attentively to mynarration of the circumstances leading to the ruffianly outrage, and gave manyproofs of his strong indignation at what was done. Hugh was a rough, butmanly-hearted fellow, and, at this time, his best nature showed itself.The heart of my once almost over-kind mistress, Sophia, was again melted in pitytoward me. My puffed-out eye, and my scarred and blood-covered face, moved thedear lady to tears. She kindly drew a chair by me, and with friendly, consolingwords, she took water, and washed the blood from my face. No mother’s hand couldhave been more tender than hers. She bound up my head, and covered my woundedeye with a lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation for themurderous assault, and my suffering, that it furnished and occasion for themanifestation, once more, of the orignally(sic) characteristic kindness of mymistress. Her affectionate heart was not yet dead, though much hardened by timeand by circumstances.As for Master Hugh’s part, as I have said, he was furious about it; and he gaveexpression to his fury in the usual forms of speech in that locality. He pouredcurses on the heads of the whole ship yard company, and swore that he would havesatisfaction for the outrage. His indignation was really strong and healthy;but, unfortunately, it resulted from the thought that his rights of property, inmy person, had not been respected, more than from any sense of the outragecommitted on me as a man. I inferred as much as this, from the fact that hecould, himself, beat and mangle when it suited him to do so. Bent on havingsatisfaction, as he said, just as soon as I got a little the better of mybruises, Master Hugh took me to Esquire Watson’s office, on Bond street, Fell’sPoint, with a view to procuring the arrest of those who had assaulted me. Herelated the outrage to the magistrate, as I had related it to him, and seemed toexpect that a warrant would, at once, be issued for the arrest of the lawlessruffians.Mr. Watson heard it all, and instead of drawing up his warrant, he inquired.—“Mr. Auld, who saw this assault of which you speak?”“It was done, sir, in the presence of a ship yard full of hands.”“Sir,” said Watson, “I am sorry, but I cannot move in this matter except uponthe oath of white witnesses.\"“But here’s the boy; look at his head and face,” said the excited Master Hugh;“they show what has been done.”But Watson insisted that he was not authorized to do anything, unless whitewitnesses of the transaction would come forward, and testify to what had takenplace. He could issue no warrant on my word, against white persons; and, if Ihad been killed in the presence of a thousand blacks, their testimony, combinedwould have been insufficient to arrest a single murderer. Master Hugh, for once,was compelled to say, that this state of things was too bad; and he left theoffice of the magistrate, disgusted.Of course, it was impossible to get any white man to testify against myassailants. The carpenters saw what was done; but the actors were but the agentsof their malice, and only what the carpenters sanctioned. They had cried, withone accord, “Kill the nigger!” “Kill the nigger!” Even those who may have pitiedme, if any such were among them, lacked the moral courage to come and volunteertheir evidence. The slightest manifestation of sympathy or justice toward aperson of color, was denounced as abolitionism; and the name of abolitionist,subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities. “D—n abolitionists,” and “Killthe niggers,” were the watch-words of the foul-mouthed ruffians of those days.Nothing was done, and probably there would not have been any thing done, had Ibeen killed in the affray. The laws and the morals of the Christian city ofBaltimore, afforded no protection to the sable denizens of that city.Master Hugh, on finding he could get no redress for the cruel wrong, withdrew mefrom the employment of Mr. Gardiner, and took me into his own family, Mrs. Auldkindly taking care of me, and dressing my wounds, until they were healed, and Iwas ready to go again to work.While I was on the Eastern Shore, Master Hugh had met with reverses, whichoverthrew his business; and he had given up ship building in his own yard, onthe City Block, and was now acting as foreman of Mr. Walter Price. The best hecould now do for me, was to take me into Mr. Price’s yard, and afford me thefacilities there, for completing the trade which I had began to learn atGardiner’s. Here I rapidly became expert in the use of my calking tools; and, inthe course of a single year, I was able to command the highest wages paid tojourneymen calkers in Baltimore.The reader will observe that I was now of some pecuniary value to my master.During the busy season, I was bringing six and seven dollars per week. I have,sometimes, brought him as much as nine dollars a week, for the wages were adollar and a half per day.After learning to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own contracts, andcollected my own earnings; giving Master Hugh no trouble in any part of thetransactions to which I was a party.Here, then, were better days for the Eastern Shore slave. I was now free fromthe vexatious assalts(sic) of the apprentices at Mr. Gardiner’s; and free fromthe perils of plantation life, and once more in a favorable condition toincrease my little stock of education, which had been at a dead stand since myremoval from Baltimore. I had, on the Eastern Shore, been only a teacher, whenin company with other slaves, but now there were colored persons who couldinstruct me. Many of the young calkers could read, write and cipher. Some ofthem had high notions about mental improvement; and the free ones, on Fell’sPoint, organized what they called the “East Baltimore Mental ImprovementSociety.” To this society, notwithstanding it was intended that only freepersons should attach themselves, I was admitted, and was, several times,assigned a prominent part in its debates. I owe much to the society of theseyoung men.The reader already knows enough of the ill effects of good treatment on a slave,to anticipate what was now the case in my improved condition. It was not longbefore I began to show signs of disquiet with slavery, and to look around formeans to get out of that condition by the shortest route. I was living amongfree men; and was, in all respects, equal to them by nature and by attainments.Why should I be a slave? There was no reason why I should be the thrall of anyman.Besides, I was now getting—as I have said—a dollar and fifty cents per day. Icontracted for it, worked for it, earned it, collected it; it was paid to me,and it was rightfully my own; and yet, upon every returning Saturday night, thismoney—my own hard earnings, every cent of it—was demanded of me, and taken fromme by Master Hugh. He did not earn it; he had no hand in earning it; why, then,should he have it? I owed him nothing. He had given me no schooling, and I hadreceived from him only my food and raiment; and for these, my services weresupposed to pay, from the first. The right to take my earnings, was the right ofthe robber. He had the power to compel me to give him the fruits of my labor,and this power was his only right in the case. I became more and moredissatisfied with this state of things; and, in so becoming, I only gave proofof the same human nature which every reader of this chapter in mylife—slaveholder, or nonslaveholder—is conscious of possessing.To make a contented slave, you must make a thoughtless one. It is necessary todarken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, to annihilate hispower of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies in slavery. Theman that takes his earnings, must be able to convince him that he has a perfectright to do so. It must not depend upon mere force; the slave must know noHigher Law than his master’s will. The whole relationship must not onlydemonstrate, to his mind, its necessity, but its absolute rightfulness. If therebe one crevice through which a single drop can fall, it will certainly rust offthe slave’s chain."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXI.

There are reasons for thissuppression, which I trust the reader will deem altogether valid. It may beeasily conceived, that a full and complete statement of all facts pertaining tothe flight of a bondman, might implicate and embarrass some who may have,wittingly or unwittingly, assisted him; and no one can wish me to involve anyman or woman who has befriended me, even in the liability of embarrassment ortrouble.Keen is the scent of the slaveholder; like the fangs of the rattlesnake, hismalice retains its poison long; and, although it is now nearly seventeen yearssince I made my escape, it is well to be careful, in dealing with thecircumstances relating to it. Were I to give but a shadowy outline of theprocess adopted, with characteristic aptitude, the crafty and malicious amongthe slaveholders might, possibly, hit upon the track I pursued, and involve someone in suspicion which, in a slave state, is about as bad as positive evidence.The colored man, there, must not only shun evil, but shun the very appearance ofevil, or be condemned as a criminal. A slaveholding community has a peculiartaste for ferreting out offenses against the slave system, justice there beingmore sensitive in its regard for the peculiar rights of this system, than forany other interest or institution. By stringing together a train of events andcircumstances, even if I were not very explicit, the means of escape might beascertained, and, possibly, those means be rendered, thereafter, no longeravailable to the liberty-seeking children of bondage I have left behind me. Noantislavery man can wish me to do anything favoring such results, and noslaveholding reader has any right to expect the impartment of such information.While, therefore, it would afford me pleasure, and perhaps would materially addto the interest of my story, were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity which Iknow to exist in the minds of many, as to the manner of my escape, I mustdeprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious of the gratification, whichsuch a statement of facts would afford. I would allow myself to suffer under thegreatest imputations that evil minded men might suggest, rather than exculpatemyself by explanation, and thereby run the hazards of closing the slightestavenue by which a brother in suffering might clear himself of the chains andfetters of slavery.The practice of publishing every new invention by which a slave is known to haveescaped from slavery, has neither wisdom nor necessity to sustain it. Had notHenry Box Brown and his friends attracted slaveholding attention to the mannerof his escape, we might have had a thousand Box Browns per annum. The singularlyoriginal plan adopted by William and Ellen Crafts, perished with the firstusing, because every slaveholder in the land was apprised of it. The salt waterslave who hung in the guards of a steamer, being washed three days and threenights—like another Jonah—by the waves of the sea, has, by the publicity givento the circumstance, set a spy on the guards of every steamer departing fromsouthern ports.I have never approved of the very public manner, in which some of our westernfriends have conducted what they call the “Under-ground Railroad,” but which, Ithink, by their open declarations, has been made, most emphatically, the“Upper-ground Railroad.” Its stations are far better known to the slaveholdersthan to the slaves. I honor those good men and women for their noble daring, inwillingly subjecting themselves to persecution, by openly avowing theirparticipation in the escape of slaves; nevertheless, the good resulting fromsuch avowals, is of a very questionable character. It may kindle an enthusiasm,very pleasant to inhale; but that is of no practical benefit to themselves, norto the slaves escaping. Nothing is more evident, than that such disclosures area positive evil to the slaves remaining, and seeking to escape. In publishingsuch accounts, the anti-slavery man addresses the slaveholder, not the slave; hestimulates the former to greater watchfulness, and adds to his facilities forcapturing his slave. We owe something to the slaves, south of Mason and Dixon’sline, as well as to those north of it; and, in discharging the duty of aidingthe latter, on their way to freedom, we should be careful to do nothing whichwould be likely to hinder the former, in making their escape from slavery. Suchis my detestation of slavery, that I would keep the merciless slaveholderprofoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. He should beleft to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, everready to snatch, from his infernal grasp, his trembling prey. In pursuing hisvictim, let him be left to feel his way in the dark; let shades of darkness,commensurate with his crime, shut every ray of light from his pathway; and lethim be made to feel, that, at every step he takes, with the hellish purpose ofreducing a brother man to slavery, he is running the frightful risk of havinghis hot brains dashed out by an invisible hand.But, enough of this. I will now proceed to the statement of those facts,connected with my escape, for which I am alone responsible, and for which no onecan be made to suffer but myself.My condition in the year (1838) of my escape, was, comparatively, a free andeasy one, so far, at least, as the wants of the physical man were concerned; butthe reader will bear in mind, that my troubles from the beginning, have beenless physical than mental, and he will thus be prepared to find, after what isnarrated in the previous chapters, that slave life was adding nothing to itscharms for me, as I grew older, and became better acquainted with it. Thepractice, from week to week, of openly robbing me of all my earnings, kept thenature and character of slavery constantly before me. I could be robbed byindirection, but this was too open and barefaced to be endured. I could see noreason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my honest toilinto the purse of any man. The thought itself vexed me, and the manner in whichMaster Hugh received my wages, vexed me more than the original wrong. Carefullycounting the money and rolling it out, dollar by dollar, he would look me in theface, as if he would search my heart as well as my pocket, and reproachfully askme, “Is that all?”—implying that I had, perhaps, kept back part of my wages; or,if not so, the demand was made, possibly, to make me feel, that, after all, Iwas an “unprofitable servant.” Draining me of the last cent of my hard earnings,he would, however, occasionally—when I brought home an extra large sum—dole outto me a sixpence or a shilling, with a view, perhaps, of kindling up mygratitude; but this practice had the opposite effect—it was an admission of myright to the whole sum. The fact, that he gave me any part of my wages, wasproof that he suspected that I had a right to the whole of them. I always feltuncomfortable, after having received anything in this way, for I feared that thegiving me a few cents, might, possibly, ease his conscience, and make him feelhimself a pretty honorable robber, after all!Held to a strict account, and kept under a close watch—the old suspicion of myrunning away not having been entirely removed—escape from slavery, even inBaltimore, was very difficult. The railroad from Baltimore to Philadelphia wasunder regulations so stringent, that even free colored travelers were almostexcluded. They must have free papers; they must be measured and carefullyexamined, before they were allowed to enter the cars; they only went in the daytime, even when so examined. The steamboats were under regulations equallystringent. All the great turnpikes, leading northward, were beset withkidnappers, a class of men who watched the newspapers for advertisements forrunaway slaves, making their living by the accursed reward of slave hunting.My discontent grew upon me, and I was on the look-out for means of escape. Withmoney, I could easily have managed the matter, and, therefore, I hit upon theplan of soliciting the privilege of hiring my time. It is quite common, inBaltimore, to allow slaves this privilege, and it is the practice, also, in NewOrleans. A slave who is considered trustworthy, can, by paying his master adefinite sum regularly, at the end of each week, dispose of his time as helikes. It so happened that I was not in very good odor, and I was far from beinga trustworthy slave. Nevertheless, I watched my opportunity when Master Thomascame to Baltimore (for I was still his property, Hugh only acted as his agent)in the spring of 1838, to purchase his spring supply of goods, and applied tohim, directly, for the much-coveted privilege of hiring my time. This requestMaster Thomas unhesitatingly refused to grant; and he charged me, with somesternness, with inventing this stratagem to make my escape. He told me, “I couldgo nowhere but he could catch me; and, in the event of my running away, I mightbe assured he should spare no pains in his efforts to recapture me.” Herecounted, with a good deal of eloquence, the many kind offices he had done me,and exhorted me to be contented and obedient. “Lay out no plans for the future,”said he. “If you behave yourself properly, I will take care of you.” Now, kindand considerate as this offer was, it failed to soothe me into repose. In spiteof Master Thomas, and, I may say, in spite of myself, also, I continued tothink, and worse still, to think almost exclusively about the injustice andwickedness of slavery. No effort of mine or of his could silence thistrouble-giving thought, or change my purpose to run away.About two months after applying to Master Thomas for the privilege of hiring mytime, I applied to Master Hugh for the same liberty, supposing him to beunacquainted with the fact that I had made a similar application to MasterThomas, and had been refused. My boldness in making this request, fairlyastounded him at the first. He gazed at me in amazement. But I had many goodreasons for pressing the matter; and, after listening to them awhile, he did notabsolutely refuse, but told me he would think of it. Here, then, was a gleam ofhope. Once master of my own time, I felt sure that I could make, over and abovemy obligation to him, a dollar or two every week. Some slaves have made enough,in this way, to purchase their freedom. It is a sharp spur to industry; and someof the most enterprising colored men in Baltimore hire themselves in this way.After mature reflection—as I must suppose it was Master Hugh granted me theprivilege in question, on the following terms: I was to be allowed all my time;to make all bargains for work; to find my own employment, and to collect my ownwages; and, in return for this liberty, I was required, or obliged, to pay himthree dollars at the end of each week, and to board and clothe myself, and buymy own calking tools. A failure in any of these particulars would put an end tomy privilege. This was a hard bargain. The wear and tear of clothing, the losingand breaking of tools, and the expense of board, made it necessary for me toearn at least six dollars per week, to keep even with the world. All who areacquainted with calking, know how uncertain and irregular that employment is. Itcan be done to advantage only in dry weather, for it is useless to put wet oakuminto a seam. Rain or shine, however, work or no work, at the end of each weekthe money must be forthcoming.Master Hugh seemed to be very much pleased, for a time, with this arrangement;and well he might be, for it was decidedly in his favor. It relieved him of allanxiety concerning me. His money was sure. He had armed my love of liberty witha lash and a driver, far more efficient than any I had before known; and, whilehe derived all the benefits of slaveholding by the arrangement, without itsevils, I endured all the evils of being a slave, and yet suffered all the careand anxiety of a responsible freeman. “Nevertheless,” thought I, “it is avaluable privilege another step in my career toward freedom.” It was somethingeven to be permitted to stagger under the disadvantages of liberty, and I wasdetermined to hold on to the newly gained footing, by all proper industry. I wasready to work by night as well as by day; and being in the enjoyment ofexcellent health, I was able not only to meet my current expenses, but also tolay by a small sum at the end of each week. All went on thus, from the month ofMay till August; then—for reasons which will become apparent as I proceed—mymuch valued liberty was wrested from me.During the week previous to this (to me) calamitous event, I had madearrangements with a few young friends, to accompany them, on Saturday night, toa camp-meeting, held about twelve miles from Baltimore. On the evening of ourintended start for the camp-ground, something occurred in the ship yard where Iwas at work, which detained me unusually late, and compelled me either todisappoint my young friends, or to neglect carrying my weekly dues to MasterHugh. Knowing that I had the money, and could hand it to him on another day, Idecided to go to camp-meeting, and to pay him the three dollars, for the pastweek, on my return. Once on the camp-ground, I was induced to remain one daylonger than I had intended, when I left home. But, as soon as I returned, I wentstraight to his house on Fell street, to hand him his (my) money. Unhappily, thefatal mistake had been committed. I found him exceedingly angry. He exhibitedall the signs of apprehension and wrath, which a slaveholder may be surmised toexhibit on the supposed escape of a favorite slave. “You rascal! I have a greatmind to give you a severe whipping. How dare you go out of the city withoutfirst asking and obtaining my permission?” “Sir,” said I, “I hired my time andpaid you the price you asked for it. I did not know that it was any part of thebargain that I should ask you when or where I should go.”“You did not know, you rascal! You are bound to show yourself here everySaturday night.” After reflecting, a few moments, he became somewhat cooleddown; but, evidently greatly troubled, he said, “Now, you scoundrel! you havedone for yourself; you shall hire your time no longer. The next thing I shallhear of, will be your running away. Bring home your tools and your clothes, atonce. I’ll teach you how to go off in this way.”Thus ended my partial freedom. I could hire my time no longer; and I obeyed mymaster’s orders at once. The little taste of liberty which I had had—although asthe reader will have seen, it was far from being unalloyed—by no means enhancedmy contentment with slavery. Punished thus by Master Hugh, it was now my turn topunish him. “Since,” thought I, “you will make a slave of me, I will await yourorders in all things;” and, instead of going to look for work on Monday morning,as I had formerly done, I remained at home during the entire week, without theperformance of a single stroke of work. Saturday night came, and he called uponme, as usual, for my wages. I, of course, told him I had done no work, and hadno wages. Here we were at the point of coming to blows. His wrath had beenaccumulating during the whole week; for he evidently saw that I was making noeffort to get work, but was most aggravatingly awaiting his orders, in allthings. As I look back to this behavior of mine, I scarcely know what possessedme, thus to trifle with those who had such unlimited power to bless or to blastme. Master Hugh raved and swore his determination to “get hold of me;” but,wisely for him, and happily for me, his wrath only employed those very harmless,impalpable missiles, which roll from a limber tongue. In my desperation, I hadfully made up my mind to measure strength with Master Hugh, in case he shouldundertake to execute his threats. I am glad there was no necessity for this; forresistance to him could not have ended so happily for me, as it did in the caseof Covey. He was not a man to be safely resisted by a slave; and I freely own,that in my conduct toward him, in this instance, there was more folly thanwisdom. Master Hugh closed his reproofs, by telling me that, hereafter, I needgive myself no uneasiness about getting work; that he “would, himself, see togetting work for me, and enough of it, at that.” This threat I confess had someterror in it; and, on thinking the matter over, during the Sunday, I resolved,not only to save him the trouble of getting me work, but that, upon the thirdday of September, I would attempt to make my escape from slavery. The refusal toallow me to hire my time, therefore, hastened the period of flight. I had threeweeks, now, in which to prepare for my journey.Once resolved, I felt a certain degree of repose, and on Monday, instead ofwaiting for Master Hugh to seek employment for me, I was up by break of day, andoff to the ship yard of Mr. Butler, on the City Block, near the draw-bridge. Iwas a favorite with Mr. B., and, young as I was, I had served as his foreman onthe float stage, at calking. Of course, I easily obtained work, and, at the endof the week—which by the way was exceedingly fine I brought Master Hugh nearlynine dollars. The effect of this mark of returning good sense, on my part, wasexcellent. He was very much pleased; he took the money, commended me, and toldme I might have done the same thing the week before. It is a blessed thing thatthe tyrant may not always know the thoughts and purposes of his victim. MasterHugh little knew what my plans were. The going to camp-meeting without askinghis permission—the insolent answers made to his reproaches—the sulky deportmentthe week after being deprived of the privilege of hiring my time—had awakened inhim the suspicion that I might be cherishing disloyal purposes. My object,therefore, in working steadily, was to remove suspicion, and in this I succeededadmirably. He probably thought I was never better satisfied with my condition,than at the very time I was planning my escape. The second week passed, andagain I carried him my full week’s wages—nine dollars; and so well pleased washe, that he gave me TWENTY-FIVE CENTS! and “bade me make good use of it!” I toldhim I would, for one of the uses to which I meant to put it, was to pay my fareon the underground railroad.Things without went on as usual; but I was passing through the same internalexcitement and anxiety which I had experienced two years and a half before. Thefailure, in that instance, was not calculated to increase my confidence in thesuccess of this, my second attempt; and I knew that a second failure could notleave me where my first did—I must either get to the far north, or be sent tothe far south. Besides the exercise of mind from this state of facts, I had thepainful sensation of being about to separate from a circle of honest and warmhearted friends, in Baltimore. The thought of such a separation, where the hopeof ever meeting again is excluded, and where there can be no correspondence, isvery painful. It is my opinion, that thousands would escape from slavery who nowremain there, but for the strong cords of affection that bind them to theirfamilies, relatives and friends. The daughter is hindered from escaping, by thelove she bears her mother, and the father, by the love he bears his children;and so, to the end of the chapter. I had no relations in Baltimore, and I saw noprobability of ever living in the neighborhood of sisters and brothers; but thethought of leaving my friends, was among the strongest obstacles to my runningaway. The last two days of the week—Friday and Saturday—were spent mostly incollecting my things together, for my journey. Having worked four days thatweek, for my master, I handed him six dollars, on Saturday night. I seldom spentmy Sundays at home; and, for fear that something might be discovered in myconduct, I kept up my custom, and absented myself all day. On Monday, the thirdday of September, 1838, in accordance with my resolution, I bade farewell to thecity of Baltimore, and to that slavery which had been my abhorrence fromchildhood.How I got away—in what direction I traveled—whether by land or by water; whetherwith or without assistance—must, for reasons already mentioned, remainunexplained.LIFE AS A FREEMANCHAPTER XXII.

There is nothing very striking or peculiar about my career as afreeman, when viewed apart from my life as a slave. The relation subsistingbetween my early experience and that which I am now about to narrate, is,perhaps, my best apology for adding another chapter to this book.Disappearing from the kind reader, in a flying cloud or balloon (pardon thefigure), driven by the wind, and knowing not where I should land—whether inslavery or in freedom—it is proper that I should remove, at once, all anxiety,by frankly making known where I alighted. The flight was a bold and perilousone; but here I am, in the great city of New York, safe and sound, without lossof blood or bone. In less than a week after leaving Baltimore, I was walkingamid the hurrying throng, and gazing upon the dazzling wonders of Broadway. Thedreams of my childhood and the purposes of my manhood were now fulfilled. A freestate around me, and a free earth under my feet! What a moment was this to me! Awhole year was pressed into a single day. A new world burst upon my agitatedvision. I have often been asked, by kind friends to whom I have told my story,how I felt when first I found myself beyond the limits of slavery; and I mustsay here, as I have often said to them, there is scarcely anything about which Icould not give a more satisfactory answer. It was a moment of joyous excitement,which no words can describe. In a letter to a friend, written soon afterreaching New York. I said I felt as one might be supposed to feel, on escapingfrom a den of hungry lions. But, in a moment like that, sensations are toointense and too rapid for words. Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, maybe described, but joy and gladness, like the rainbow of promise, defy alike thepen and pencil.For ten or fifteen years I had been dragging a heavy chain, with a huge blockattached to it, cumbering my every motion. I had felt myself doomed to drag thischain and this block through life. All efforts, before, to separate myself fromthe hateful encumbrance, had only seemed to rivet me the more firmly to it.Baffled and discouraged at times, I had asked myself the question, May not this,after all, be God’s work? May He not, for wise ends, have doomed me to this lot?A contest had been going on in my mind for years, between the clearconsciousness of right and the plausible errors of superstition; between thewisdom of manly courage, and the foolish weakness of timidity. The contest wasnow ended; the chain was severed; God and right stood vindicated. I was AFREEMAN, and the voice of peace and joy thrilled my heart.Free and joyous, however, as I was, joy was not the only sensation Iexperienced. It was like the quick blaze, beautiful at the first, but whichsubsiding, leaves the building charred and desolate. I was soon taught that Iwas still in an enemy’s land. A sense of loneliness and insecurity oppressed mesadly. I had been but a few hours in New York, before I was met in the streetsby a fugitive slave, well known to me, and the information I got from himrespecting New York, did nothing to lessen my apprehension of danger. Thefugitive in question was “Allender’s Jake,” in Baltimore; but, said he, I am“WILLIAM DIXON,” in New York! I knew Jake well, and knew when Tolly Allender andMr. Price (for the latter employed Master Hugh as his foreman, in his shipyardon Fell’s Point) made an attempt to recapture Jake, and failed. Jake told me allabout his circumstances, and how narrowly he escaped being taken back toslavery; that the city was now full of southerners, returning from the springs;that the black people in New York were not to be trusted; that there were hiredmen on the lookout for fugitives from slavery, and who, for a few dollars, wouldbetray me into the hands of the slave-catchers; that I must trust no man with mysecret; that I must not think of going either on the wharves to work, or to aboarding-house to board; and, worse still, this same Jake told me it was not inhis power to help me. He seemed, even while cautioning me, to be fearing lest,after all, I might be a party to a second attempt to recapture him. Under theinspiration of this thought, I must suppose it was, he gave signs of a wish toget rid of me, and soon left me his whitewash brush in hand—as he said, for hiswork. He was soon lost to sight among the throng, and I was alone again, an easyprey to the kidnappers, if any should happen to be on my track.New York, seventeen years ago, was less a place of safety for a runaway slavethan now, and all know how unsafe it now is, under the new fugitive slave bill.I was much troubled. I had very little money enough to buy me a few loaves ofbread, but not enough to pay board, outside a lumber yard. I saw the wisdom ofkeeping away from the ship yards, for if Master Hugh pursued me, he wouldnaturally expect to find me looking for work among the calkers. For a time,every door seemed closed against me. A sense of my loneliness and helplessnesscrept over me, and covered me with something bordering on despair. In the midstof thousands of my fellowmen, and yet a perfect stranger! In the midst of humanbrothers, and yet more fearful of them than of hungry wolves! I was withouthome, without friends, without work, without money, and without any definiteknowledge of which way to go, or where to look for succor.Some apology can easily be made for the few slaves who have, after making goodtheir escape, turned back to slavery, preferring the actual rule of theirmasters, to the life of loneliness, apprehension, hunger, and anxiety, whichmeets them on their first arrival in a free state. It is difficult for a freemanto enter into the feelings of such fugitives. He cannot see things in the samelight with the slave, because he does not, and cannot, look from the same pointfrom which the slave does. “Why do you tremble,” he says to the slave “you arein a free state;” but the difficulty is, in realizing that he is in a freestate, the slave might reply. A freeman cannot understand why the slave-master’sshadow is bigger, to the slave, than the might and majesty of a free state; butwhen he reflects that the slave knows more about the slavery of his master thanhe does of the might and majesty of the free state, he has the explanation. Theslave has been all his life learning the power of his master—being trained todread his approach—and only a few hours learning the power of the state. Themaster is to him a stern and flinty reality, but the state is little more than adream. He has been accustomed to regard every white man as the friend of hismaster, and every colored man as more or less under the control of his master’sfriends—the white people. It takes stout nerves to stand up, in suchcircumstances. A man, homeless, shelterless, breadless, friendless, andmoneyless, is not in a condition to assume a very proud or joyous tone; and injust this condition was I, while wandering about the streets of New York cityand lodging, at least one night, among the barrels on one of its wharves. I wasnot only free from slavery, but I was free from home, as well. The reader willeasily see that I had something more than the simple fact of being free to thinkof, in this extremity.I kept my secret as long as I could, and at last was forced to go in search ofan honest man—a man sufficiently human not to betray me into the hands ofslave-catchers. I was not a bad reader of the human face, nor long in selectingthe right man, when once compelled to disclose the facts of my condition to someone.I found my man in the person of one who said his name was Stewart. He was asailor, warm-hearted and generous, and he listened to my story with a brother’sinterest. I told him I was running for my freedom—knew not where to go—moneyalmost gone—was hungry—thought it unsafe to go the shipyards for work, andneeded a friend. Stewart promptly put me in the way of getting out of mytrouble. He took me to his house, and went in search of the late David Ruggles,who was then the secretary of the New York Vigilance Committee, and a veryactive man in all anti-slavery works. Once in the hands of Mr. Ruggles, I wascomparatively safe. I was hidden with Mr. Ruggles several days. In the meantime,my intended wife, Anna, came on from Baltimore—to whom I had written, informingher of my safe arrival at New York—and, in the presence of Mrs. Mitchell and Mr.Ruggles, we were married, by Rev. James W. C. Pennington.Mr. Ruggles 7[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-7]was the first officer on the under-ground railroad with whom I met afterreaching the north, and, indeed, the first of whom I ever heard anything.Learning that I was a calker by trade, he promptly decided that New Bedford wasthe proper place to send me. “Many ships,” said he, “are there fitted out forthe whaling business, and you may there find work at your trade, and make a goodliving.” Thus, in one fortnight after my flight from Maryland, I was safe in NewBedford, regularly entered upon the exercise of the rights, responsibilities,and duties of a freeman.I may mention a little circumstance which annoyed me on reaching New Bedford. Ihad not a cent of money, and lacked two dollars toward paying our fare fromNewport, and our baggage not very costly—was taken by the stage driver, and helduntil I could raise the money to redeem it. This difficulty was soon surmounted.Mr. Nathan Johnson, to whom we had a line from Mr. Ruggles, not only received uskindly and hospitably, but, on being informed about our baggage, promptly loanedme two dollars with which to redeem my little property. I shall ever be deeplygrateful, both to Mr. and Mrs. Nathan Johnson, for the lively interest they werepleased to take in me, in this hour of my extremest need. They not only gavemyself and wife bread and shelter, but taught us how to begin to secure thosebenefits for ourselves. Long may they live, and may blessings attend them inthis life and in that which is to come!Once initiated into the new life of freedom, and assured by Mr. Johnson that NewBedford was a safe place, the comparatively unimportant matter, as to whatshould be my name, came up for considertion(sic). It was necessary to have aname in my new relations. The name given me by my beloved mother was no lesspretentious than “Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey.” I had, however, beforeleaving Maryland, dispensed with the Augustus Washington, and retained the nameFrederick Bailey. Between Baltimore and New Bedford, however, I had severaldifferent names, the better to avoid being overhauled by the hunters, which Ihad good reason to believe would be put on my track. Among honest men an honestman may well be content with one name, and to acknowledge it at all times and inall places; but toward fugitives, Americans are not honest. When I arrived atNew Bedford, my name was Johnson; and finding that the Johnson family in NewBedford were already quite numerous—sufficiently so to produce some confusion inattempts to distinguish one from another—there was the more reason for makinganother change in my name. In fact, “Johnson” had been assumed by nearly everyslave who had arrived in New Bedford from Maryland, and this, much to theannoyance of the original “Johnsons” (of whom there were many) in that place.Mine host, unwilling to have another of his own name added to the community inthis unauthorized way, after I spent a night and a day at his house, gave me mypresent name. He had been reading the “Lady of the Lake,” and was pleased toregard me as a suitable person to wear this, one of Scotland’s many famousnames. Considering the noble hospitality and manly character of Nathan Johnson,I have felt that he, better than I, illustrated the virtues of the greatScottish chief. Sure I am, that had any slave-catcher entered his domicile, witha view to molest any one of his household, he would have shown himself like himof the “stalwart hand.”The reader will be amused at my ignorance, when I tell the notions I had of thestate of northern wealth, enterprise, and civilization. Of wealth andrefinement, I supposed the north had none. My Columbian Orator, which was almostmy only book, had not done much to enlighten me concerning northern society. Theimpressions I had received were all wide of the truth. New Bedford, especially,took me by surprise, in the solid wealth and grandeur there exhibited. I hadformed my notions respecting the social condition of the free states, by what Ihad seen and known of free, white, non-slaveholding people in the slave states.Regarding slavery as the basis of wealth, I fancied that no people could becomevery wealthy without slavery. A free white man, holding no slaves, in thecountry, I had known to be the most ignorant and poverty-stricken of men, andthe laugh ing stock even of slaves themselves—called generally by them, inderision, “poor white trash.” Like the non-slaveholders at the south, in holdingno slaves, I suppose the northern people like them, also, in poverty anddegradation. Judge, then, of my amazement and joy, when I found—as I didfind—the very laboring population of New Bedford living in better houses, moreelegantly furnished—surrounded by more comfort and refinement—than a majority ofthe slaveholders on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. There was my friend, Mr.Johnson, himself a colored man (who at the south would have been regarded as aproper marketable commodity), who lived in a better house—dined at a richerboard—was the owner of more books—the reader of more newspapers—was moreconversant with the political and social condition of this nation and theworld—than nine-tenths of all the slaveholders of Talbot county, Maryland. YetMr. Johnson was a working man, and his hands were hardened by honest toil. Here,then, was something for observation and study. Whence the difference? Theexplanation was soon furnished, in the superiority of mind over simple bruteforce. Many pages might be given to the contrast, and in explanation of itscauses. But an incident or two will suffice to show the reader as to how themystery gradually vanished before me.My first afternoon, on reaching New Bedford, was spent in visiting the wharvesand viewing the shipping. The sight of the broad brim and the plain, Quakerdress, which met me at every turn, greatly increased my sense of freedom andsecurity. “I am among the Quakers,” thought I, “and am safe.” Lying at thewharves and riding in the stream, were full-rigged ships of finest model, readyto start on whaling voyages. Upon the right and the left, I was walled in bylarge granite-fronted warehouses, crowded with the good things of this world. Onthe wharves, I saw industry without bustle, labor without noise, and heavy toilwithout the whip. There was no loud singing, as in southern ports, where shipsare loading or unloading—no loud cursing or swearing—but everything went on assmoothly as the works of a well adjusted machine. How different was all thisfrom the nosily fierce and clumsily absurd manner of labor-life in Baltimore andSt. Michael’s! One of the first incidents which illustrated the superior mentalcharacter of northern labor over that of the south, was the manner of unloadinga ship’s cargo of oil. In a southern port, twenty or thirty hands would havebeen employed to do what five or six did here, with the aid of a single oxattached to the end of a fall. Main strength, unassisted by skill, is slavery’smethod of labor. An old ox, worth eighty dollars, was doing, in New Bedford,what would have required fifteen thousand dollars worth of human bones andmuscles to have performed in a southern port. I found that everything was donehere with a scrupulous regard to economy, both in regard to men and things, timeand strength. The maid servant, instead of spending at least a tenth part of hertime in bringing and carrying water, as in Baltimore, had the pump at her elbow.The wood was dry, and snugly piled away for winter. Woodhouses, in-door pumps,sinks, drains, self-shutting gates, washing machines, pounding barrels, were allnew things, and told me that I was among a thoughtful and sensible people. Tothe ship-repairing dock I went, and saw the same wise prudence. The carpentersstruck where they aimed, and the calkers wasted no blows in idle flourishes ofthe mallet. I learned that men went from New Bedford to Baltimore, and boughtold ships, and brought them here to repair, and made them better and morevaluable than they ever were before. Men talked here of going whaling on a fouryears’ voyage with more coolness than sailors where I came from talked of goinga four months’ voyage.I now find that I could have landed in no part of the United States, where Ishould have found a more striking and gratifying contrast to the condition ofthe free people of color in Baltimore, than I found here in New Bedford. Nocolored man is really free in a slaveholding state. He wears the badge ofbondage while nominally free, and is often subjected to hardships to which theslave is a stranger; but here in New Bedford, it was my good fortune to see apretty near approach to freedom on the part of the colored people. I was takenall aback when Mr. Johnson—who lost no time in making me acquainted with thefact—told me that there was nothing in the constitution of Massachusetts toprevent a colored man from holding any office in the state. There, in NewBedford, the black man’s children—although anti-slavery was then far frompopular—went to school side by side with the white children, and apparentlywithout objection from any quarter. To make me at home, Mr. Johnson assured methat no slaveholder could take a slave from New Bedford; that there were menthere who would lay down their lives, before such an outrage could beperpetrated. The colored people themselves were of the best metal, and wouldfight for liberty to the death.Soon after my arrival in New Bedford, I was told the following story, which wassaid to illustrate the spirit of the colored people in that goodly town: Acolored man and a fugitive slave happened to have a little quarrel, and theformer was heard to threaten the latter with informing his master of hiswhereabouts. As soon as this threat became known, a notice was read from thedesk of what was then the only colored church in the place, stating thatbusiness of importance was to be then and there transacted. Special measures hadbeen taken to secure the attendance of the would-be Judas, and had provedsuccessful. Accordingly, at the hour appointed, the people came, and thebetrayer also. All the usual formalities of public meetings were scrupulouslygone through, even to the offering prayer for Divine direction in the duties ofthe occasion. The president himself performed this part of the ceremony, and Iwas told that he was unusually fervent. Yet, at the close of his prayer, the oldman (one of the numerous family of Johnsons) rose from his knees, deliberatelysurveyed his audience, and then said, in a tone of solemn resolution, “Well,friends, we have got him here, and I would now recommend that you young menshould just take him outside the door and kill him.” With this, a large body ofthe congregation, who well understood the business they had come there totransact, made a rush at the villain, and doubtless would have killed him, hadhe not availed himself of an open sash, and made good his escape. He has nevershown his head in New Bedford since that time. This little incident is perfectlycharacteristic of the spirit of the colored people in New Bedford. A slave couldnot be taken from that town seventeen years ago, any more than he could be sotaken away now. The reason is, that the colored people in that city are educatedup to the point of fighting for their freedom, as well as speaking for it.Once assured of my safety in New Bedford, I put on the habiliments of a commonlaborer, and went on the wharf in search of work. I had no notion of living onthe honest and generous sympathy of my colored brother, Johnson, or that of theabolitionists. My cry was like that of Hood’s laborer, “Oh! only give me work.”Happily for me, I was not long in searching. I found employment, the third dayafter my arrival in New Bedford, in stowing a sloop with a load of oil for theNew York market. It was new, hard, and dirty work, even for a calker, but I wentat it with a glad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master—a tremendousfact—and the rapturous excitement with which I seized the job, may not easily beunderstood, except by some one with an experience like mine. The thoughts—“I canwork! I can work for a living; I am not afraid of work; I have no Master Hugh torob me of my earnings”—placed me in a state of independence, beyond seekingfriendship or support of any man. That day’s work I considered the real startingpoint of something like a new existence. Having finished this job and got my payfor the same, I went next in pursuit of a job at calking. It so happened thatMr. Rodney French, late mayor of the city of New Bedford, had a ship fitting outfor sea, and to which there was a large job of calking and coppering to be done.I applied to that noblehearted man for employment, and he promptly told me to goto work; but going on the float-stage for the purpose, I was informed that everywhite man would leave the ship if I struck a blow upon her. “Well, well,”thought I, “this is a hardship, but yet not a very serious one for me.” Thedifference between the wages of a calker and that of a common day laborer, wasan hundred per cent in favor of the former; but then I was free, and free towork, though not at my trade. I now prepared myself to do anything which came tohand in the way of turning an honest penny; sawed wood—dug cellars—shoveledcoal—swept chimneys with Uncle Lucas Debuty—rolled oil casks on thewharves—helped to load and unload vessels—worked in Ricketson’s candle works—inRichmond’s brass foundery, and elsewhere; and thus supported myself and familyfor three years.The first winter was unusually severe, in consequence of the high prices offood; but even during that winter we probably suffered less than many who hadbeen free all their lives. During the hardest of the winter, I hired out fornine dolars(sic) a month; and out of this rented two rooms for nine dollars perquarter, and supplied my wife—who was unable to work—with food and somenecessary articles of furniture. We were closely pinched to bring our wantswithin our means; but the jail stood over the way, and I had a wholesome dreadof the consequences of running in debt. This winter past, and I was up with thetimes—got plenty of work—got well paid for it—and felt that I had not done afoolish thing to leave Master Hugh and Master Thomas. I was now living in a newworld, and was wide awake to its advantages. I early began to attend themeetings of the colored people of New Bedford, and to take part in them. I wassomewhat amazed to see colored men drawing up resolutions and offering them forconsideration. Several colored young men of New Bedford, at that period, gavepromise of great usefulness. They were educated, and possessed what seemed tome, at the time, very superior talents. Some of them have been cut down bydeath, and others have removed to different parts of the world, and some remainthere now, and justify, in their present activities, my early impressions ofthem.Among my first concerns on reaching New Bedford, was to become united with thechurch, for I had never given up, in reality, my religious faith. I had becomelukewarm and in a backslidden state, but I was still convinced that it was myduty to join the Methodist church. I was not then aware of the powerfulinfluence of that religious body in favor of the enslavement of my race, nor didI see how the northern churches could be responsible for the conduct of southernchurches; neither did I fully understand how it could be my duty to remainseparate from the church, because bad men were connected with it. Theslaveholding church, with its Coveys, Weedens, Aulds, and Hopkins, I could seethrough at once, but I could not see how Elm Street church, in New Bedford,could be regarded as sanctioning the Christianity of these characters in thechurch at St. Michael’s. I therefore resolved to join the Methodist church inNew Bedford, and to enjoy the spiritual advantage of public worship. Theminister of the Elm Street Methodist church, was the Rev. Mr. Bonney; andalthough I was not allowed a seat in the body of the house, and was proscribedon account of my color, regarding this proscription simply as an accommodationof the uncoverted congregation who had not yet been won to Christ and hisbrotherhood, I was willing thus to be proscribed, lest sinners should be drivenaway form the saving power of the gospel. Once converted, I thought they wouldbe sure to treat me as a man and a brother. “Surely,” thought I, “theseChristian people have none of this feeling against color. They, at least, haverenounced this unholy feeling.” Judge, then, dear reader, of my astonishment andmortification, when I found, as soon I did find, all my charitable assumptionsat fault.An opportunity was soon afforded me for ascertaining the exact position of ElmStreet church on that subject. I had a chance of seeing the religious part ofthe congregation by themselves; and although they disowned, in effect, theirblack brothers and sisters, before the world, I did think that where none butthe saints were assembled, and no offense could be given to the wicked, and thegospel could not be “blamed,” they would certainly recognize us as children ofthe same Father, and heirs of the same salvation, on equal terms withthemselves.The occasion to which I refer, was the sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, that mostsacred and most solemn of all the ordinances of the Christian church. Mr. Bonneyhad preached a very solemn and searching discourse, which really proved him tobe acquainted with the inmost secerts(sic) of the human heart. At the close ofhis discourse, the congregation was dismissed, and the church remained topartake of the sacrament. I remained to see, as I thought, this holy sacramentcelebrated in the spirit of its great Founder.There were only about a half dozen colored members attached to the Elm Streetchurch, at this time. After the congregation was dismissed, these descended fromthe gallery, and took a seat against the wall most distant from the altar.Brother Bonney was very animated, and sung very sweetly, “Salvation ‘tis ajoyful sound,” and soon began to administer the sacrament. I was anxious toobserve the bearing of the colored members, and the result was most humiliating.During the whole ceremony, they looked like sheep without a shepherd. The whitemembers went forward to the altar by the bench full; and when it was evidentthat all the whites had been served with the bread and wine, BrotherBonney—pious Brother Bonney—after a long pause, as if inquiring whether all thewhites members had been served, and fully assuring himself on that importantpoint, then raised his voice to an unnatural pitch, and looking to the cornerwhere his black sheep seemed penned, beckoned with his hand, exclaiming, “Comeforward, colored friends! come forward! You, too, have an interest in the bloodof Christ. God is no respecter of persons. Come forward, and take this holysacrament to your comfort.” The colored members poor, slavish souls wentforward, as invited. I went out, and have never been in that church since,although I honestly went there with a view to joining that body. I found itimpossible to respect the religious profession of any who were under thedominion of this wicked prejudice, and I could not, therefore, feel that injoining them, I was joining a Christian church, at all. I tried other churchesin New Bedford, with the same result, and finally, I attached myself to a smallbody of colored Methodists, known as the Zion Methodists. Favored with theaffection and confidence of the members of this humble communion, I was soonmade a classleader and a local preacher among them. Many seasons of peace andjoy I experienced among them, the remembrance of which is still precious,although I could not see it to be my duty to remain with that body, when I foundthat it consented to the same spirit which held my brethren in chains.In four or five months after reaching New Bedford, there came a young man to me,with a copy of the Liberator, the paper edited by WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, andpublished by ISAAC KNAPP, and asked me to subscribe for it. I told him I had butjust escaped from slavery, and was of course very poor, and remarked further,that I was unable to pay for it then; the agent, however, very willingly took meas a subscriber, and appeared to be much pleased with securing my name to hislist. From this time I was brought in contact with the mind of William LloydGarrison. His paper took its place with me next to the bible.The Liberator was a paper after my own heart. It detested slavery exposedhypocrisy and wickedness in high places—made no truce with the traffickers inthe bodies and souls of men; it preached human brotherhood, denouncedoppression, and, with all the solemnity of God’s word, demanded the completeemancipation of my race. I not only liked—I loved this paper, and its editor. Heseemed a match for all the oponents(sic) of emancipation, whether they spoke inthe name of the law, or the gospel. His words were few, full of holy fire, andstraight to the point. Learning to love him, through his paper, I was preparedto be pleased with his presence. Something of a hero worshiper, by nature, herewas one, on first sight, to excite my love and reverence.Seventeen years ago, few men possessed a more heavenly countenance than WilliamLloyd Garrison, and few men evinced a more genuine or a more exalted piety. Thebible was his text book—held sacred, as the word of the Eternal Father—sinlessperfection—complete submission to insults and injuries—literal obedience to theinjunction, if smitten on one side to turn the other also. Not only was Sunday aSabbath, but all days were Sabbaths, and to be kept holy. All sectarism falseand mischievous—the regenerated, throughout the world, members of one body, andthe HEAD Christ Jesus. Prejudice against color was rebellion against God. Of allmen beneath the sky, the slaves, because most neglected and despised, werenearest and dearest to his great heart. Those ministers who defended slaveryfrom the bible, were of their “father the devil”; and those churches whichfellowshiped slaveholders as Christians, were synagogues of Satan, and ournation was a nation of liars. Never loud or noisy—calm and serene as a summersky, and as pure. “You are the man, the Moses, raised up by God, to deliver hismodern Israel from bondage,” was the spontaneous feeling of my heart, as I sataway back in the hall and listened to his mighty words; mighty in truth—mightyin their simple earnestness.I had not long been a reader of the Liberator, and listener to its editor,before I got a clear apprehension of the principles of the anti-slaverymovement. I had already the spirit of the movement, and only needed tounderstand its principles and measures. These I got from the Liberator, and fromthose who believed in that paper. My acquaintance with the movement increased myhope for the ultimate freedom of my race, and I united with it from a sense ofdelight, as well as duty.Every week the Liberator came, and every week I made myself master of itscontents. All the anti-slavery meetings held in New Bedford I promptly attended,my heart burning at every true utterance against the slave system, and everyrebuke of its friends and supporters. Thus passed the first three years of myresidence in New Bedford. I had not then dreamed of the posibility(sic) of mybecoming a public advocate of the cause so deeply imbedded in my heart. It wasenough for me to listen—to receive and applaud the great words of others, andonly whisper in private, among the white laborers on the wharves, and elsewhere,the truths which burned in my breast."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXIII. INTRODUCED TO THE ABOLITIONISTSFIRST SPEECH AT NANTUCKET—MUCH SENSATION—EXTRAORDINARY SPEECH OFMR. GARRISON—AUTHOR BECOMES A PUBLIC LECTURER—FOURTEEN YEARSEXPERIENCE—YOUTHFUL ENTHUSIASM—A BRAND NEW FACT—MATTER OF MY AUTHOR’SSPEECH—COULD NOT FOLLOW THE PROGRAMME—FUGITIVE SLAVESHIP DOUBTED—TOSETTLE ALL DOUBT I WRITE MY EXPERIENCE OF SLAVERY—DANGER OF RECAPTUREINCREASED.In the summer of 1841, a grand anti-slavery convention was held in Nantucket,under the auspices of Mr. Garrison and his friends. Until now, I had taken noholiday since my escape from slavery. Having worked very hard that spring andsummer, in Richmond’s brass foundery—sometimes working all night as well as allday—and needing a day or two of rest, I attended this convention, neversupposing that I should take part in the proceedings. Indeed, I was not awarethat any one connected with the convention even so much as knew my name. I was,however, quite mistaken. Mr. William C. Coffin, a prominent abolitionst(sic) inthose days of trial, had heard me speaking to my colored friends, in the littleschool house on Second street, New Bedford, where we worshiped. He sought me outin the crowd, and invited me to say a few words to the convention. Thus soughtout, and thus invited, I was induced to speak out the feelings inspired by theoccasion, and the fresh recollection of the scenes through which I had passed asa slave. My speech on this occasion is about the only one I ever made, of whichI do not remember a single connected sentence. It was with the utmost difficultythat I could stand erect, or that I could command and articulate two wordswithout hesitation and stammering. I trembled in every limb. I am not sure thatmy embarrassment was not the most effective part of my speech, if speech itcould be called. At any rate, this is about the only part of my performance thatI now distinctly remember. But excited and convulsed as I was, the audience,though remarkably quiet before, became as much excited as myself. Mr. Garrisonfollowed me, taking me as his text; and now, whether I had made an eloquentspeech in behalf of freedom or not, his was one never to be forgotten by thosewho heard it. Those who had heard Mr. Garrison oftenest, and had known himlongest, were astonished. It was an effort of unequaled power, sweeping down,like a very tornado, every opposing barrier, whether of sentiment or opinion.For a moment, he possessed that almost fabulous inspiration, often referred tobut seldom attained, in which a public meeting is transformed, as it were, intoa single individuality—the orator wielding a thousand heads and hearts at once,and by the simple majesty of his all controlling thought, converting his hearersinto the express image of his own soul. That night there were at least onethousand Garrisonians in Nantucket! A(sic) the close of this great meeting, Iwas duly waited on by Mr. John A. Collins—then the general agent of theMassachusetts anti-slavery society—and urgently solicited by him to become anagent of that society, and to publicly advocate its anti-slavery principles. Iwas reluctant to take the proffered position. I had not been quite three yearsfrom slavery—was honestly distrustful of my ability—wished to be excused;publicity exposed me to discovery and arrest by my master; and other objectionscame up, but Mr. Collins was not to be put off, and I finally consented to goout for three months, for I supposed that I should have got to the end of mystory and my usefulness, in that length of time.Here opened upon me a new life a life for which I had had no preparation. I wasa “graduate from the peculiar institution,\" Mr. Collins used to say, whenintroducing me, “with my diploma written on my back!” The three years of myfreedom had been spent in the hard school of adversity. My hands had beenfurnished by nature with something like a solid leather coating, and I hadbravely marked out for myself a life of rough labor, suited to the hardness ofmy hands, as a means of supporting myself and rearing my children.Now what shall I say of this fourteen years’ experience as a public advocate ofthe cause of my enslaved brothers and sisters? The time is but as a speck, yetlarge enough to justify a pause for retrospection—and a pause it must only be.Young, ardent, and hopeful, I entered upon this new life in the full gush ofunsuspecting enthusiasm. The cause was good; the men engaged in it were good;the means to attain its triumph, good; Heaven’s blessing must attend all, andfreedom must soon be given to the pining millions under a ruthless bondage. Mywhole heart went with the holy cause, and my most fervent prayer to the AlmightyDisposer of the hearts of men, were continually offered for its early triumph.“Who or what,” thought I, “can withstand a cause so good, so holy, soindescribably glorious. The God of Israel is with us. The might of the Eternalis on our side. Now let but the truth be spoken, and a nation will start forthat the sound!” In this enthusiastic spirit, I dropped into the ranks offreedom’s friends, and went forth to the battle. For a time I was made to forgetthat my skin was dark and my hair crisped. For a time I regretted that I couldnot have shared the hardships and dangers endured by the earlier workers for theslave’s release. I soon, however, found that my enthusiasm had been extravagant;that hardships and dangers were not yet passed; and that the life now before me,had shadows as well as sunbeams.Among the first duties assigned me, on entering the ranks, was to travel, incompany with Mr. George Foster, to secure subscribers to the Anti-slaveryStandard and the Liberator. With him I traveled and lectured through the easterncounties of Massachusetts. Much interest was awakened—large meetings assembled.Many came, no doubt, from curiosity to hear what a Negro could say in his owncause. I was generally introduced as a “chattel”—a“thing”—a piece of southern“property”—the chairman assuring the audience that it could speak. Fugitiveslaves, at that time, were not so plentiful as now; and as a fugitive slavelecturer, I had the advantage of being a “brand new fact”—the first one out. Upto that time, a colored man was deemed a fool who confessed himself a runawayslave, not only because of the danger to which he exposed himself of beingretaken, but because it was a confession of a very low origin! Some of mycolored friends in New Bedford thought very badly of my wisdom for thus exposingand degrading myself. The only precaution I took, at the beginning, to preventMaster Thomas from knowing where I was, and what I was about, was thewithholding my former name, my master’s name, and the name of the state andcounty from which I came. During the first three or four months, my speecheswere almost exclusively made up of narrations of my own personal experience as aslave. “Let us have the facts,” said the people. So also said Friend GeorgeFoster, who always wished to pin me down to my simple narrative. “Give us thefacts,” said Collins, “we will take care of the philosophy.” Just here arosesome embarrassment. It was impossible for me to repeat the same old story monthafter month, and to keep up my interest in it. It was new to the people, it istrue, but it was an old story to me; and to go through with it night afternight, was a task altogether too mechanical for my nature. “Tell your story,Frederick,” would whisper my then revered friend, William Lloyd Garrison, as Istepped upon the platform. I could not always obey, for I was now reading andthinking. New views of the subject were presented to my mind. It did notentirely satisfy me to narrate wrongs; I felt like denouncing them. I could notalways curb my moral indignation for the perpetrators of slaveholding villainy,long enough for a circumstantial statement of the facts which I felt almosteverybody must know. Besides, I was growing, and needed room. “People won’tbelieve you ever was a slave, Frederick, if you keep on this way,” said FriendFoster. “Be yourself,” said Collins, “and tell your story.” It was said to me,“Better have a little of the plantation manner of speech than not; ‘tis not bestthat you seem too learned.” These excellent friends were actuated by the best ofmotives, and were not altogether wrong in their advice; and still I must speakjust the word that seemed to me the word to be spoken by me.At last the apprehended trouble came. People doubted if I had ever been a slave.They said I did not talk like a slave, look like a slave, nor act like a slave,and that they believed I had never been south of Mason and Dixon’s line. “Hedon’t tell us where he came from—what his master’s name was—how he got away—northe story of his experience. Besides, he is educated, and is, in this, acontradiction of all the facts we have concerning the ignorance of the slaves.”Thus, I was in a pretty fair way to be denounced as an impostor. The committeeof the Massachusetts anti-slavery society knew all the facts in my case, andagreed with me in the prudence of keeping them private. They, therefore, neverdoubted my being a genuine fugitive; but going down the aisles of the churchesin which I spoke, and hearing the free spoken Yankees saying, repeatedly, “He’snever been a slave, I’ll warrant ye,” I resolved to dispel all doubt, at nodistant day, by such a revelation of facts as could not be made by any otherthan a genuine fugitive.In a little less than four years, therefore, after becoming a public lecturer, Iwas induced to write out the leading facts connected with my experience inslavery, giving names of persons, places, and dates—thus putting it in the powerof any who doubted, to ascertain the truth or falsehood of my story of being afugitive slave. This statement soon became known in Maryland, and I had reasonto believe that an effort would be made to recapture me.It is not probable that any open attempt to secure me as a slave could havesucceeded, further than the obtainment, by my master, of the money value of mybones and sinews. Fortunately for me, in the four years of my labors in theabolition cause, I had gained many friends, who would have suffered themselvesto be taxed to almost any extent to save me from slavery. It was felt that I hadcommitted the double offense of running away, and exposing the secrets andcrimes of slavery and slaveholders. There was a double motive for seeking myreenslavement—avarice and vengeance; and while, as I have said, there was littleprobability of successful recapture, if attempted openly, I was constantly indanger of being spirited away, at a moment when my friends could render me noassistance. In traveling about from place to place—often alone I was muchexposed to this sort of attack. Any one cherishing the design to betray me,could easily do so, by simply tracing my whereabouts through the anti-slaveryjournals, for my meetings and movements were promptly made known in advance. Mytrue friends, Mr. Garrison and Mr. Phillips, had no faith in the power ofMassachusetts to protect me in my right to liberty. Public sentiment and thelaw, in their opinion, would hand me over to the tormentors. Mr. Phillips,especially, considered me in danger, and said, when I showed him the manuscriptof my story, if in my place, he would throw it into the fire. Thus, the readerwill observe, the settling of one difficulty only opened the way for another;and that though I had reached a free state, and had attained position for publicusefulness, I ws(sic) still tormented with the liability of losing my liberty.How this liability was dispelled, will be related, with other incidents, in thenext chapter.CHAPTER XXIV. TWENTY-ONE MONTHS IN GREAT BRITAINGOOD ARISING OUT OF UNPROPITIOUS EVENTS—DENIED CABINPASSAGE—PROSCRIPTION TURNED TO GOOD ACCOUNT—THE HUTCHINSON FAMILY—THEMOB ON BOARD THE “CAMBRIA”—HAPPY INTRODUCTION TO THE BRITISHPUBLIC—LETTER ADDRESSED TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON—TIME ANDLABORS WHILE ABROAD—FREEDOM PURCHASED—MRS. HENRY RICHARDSON—FREEPAPERS—ABOLITIONISTS DISPLEASED WITH THE RANSOM—HOW MY ENERGIESWERE DIRECTED—RECEPTION SPEECH IN LONDON—CHARACTER OF THE SPEECHDEFENDED—CIRCUMSTANCES EXPLAINED—CAUSES CONTRIBUTING TO THE SUCCESS OFMY MISSION—FREE CHURCH OF SCOTLAND—TESTIMONIAL.The allotments of Providence, when coupled with trouble and anxiety, oftenconceal from finite vision the wisdom and goodness in which they are sent; and,frequently, what seemed a harsh and invidious dispensation, is converted byafter experience into a happy and beneficial arrangement. Thus, the painfulliability to be returned again to slavery, which haunted me by day, and troubledmy dreams by night, proved to be a necessary step in the path of knowledge andusefulness. The writing of my pamphlet, in the spring of 1845, endangered myliberty, and led me to seek a refuge from republican slavery in monarchicalEngland. A rude, uncultivated fugitive slave was driven, by stern necessity, tothat country to which young American gentlemen go to increase their stock ofknowledge, to seek pleasure, to have their rough, democratic manners softened bycontact with English aristocratic refinement. On applying for a passage toEngland, on board the “Cambria”, of the Cunard line, my friend, James N. Buffum,of Lynn, Massachusetts, was informed that I could not be received on board as acabin passenger. American prejudice against color triumphed over Britishliberality and civilization, and erected a color test and condition for crossingthe sea in the cabin of a British vessel. The insult was keenly felt by my whitefriends, but to me, it was common, expected, and therefore, a thing of no greatconsequence, whether I went in the cabin or in the steerage. Moreover, I feltthat if I could not go into the first cabin, first-cabin passengers could comeinto the second cabin, and the result justified my anticipations to the fullestextent. Indeed, I soon found myself an object of more general interest than Iwished to be; and so far from being degraded by being placed in the secondcabin, that part of the ship became the scene of as much pleasure andrefinement, during the voyage, as the cabin itself. The Hutchinson Family,celebrated vocalists—fellow-passengers—often came to my rude forecastle deck,and sung their sweetest songs, enlivening the place with eloquent music, as wellas spirited conversation, during the voyage. In two days after leaving Boston,one part of the ship was about as free to me as another. My fellow-passengersnot only visited me, but invited me to visit them, on the saloon deck. My visitsthere, however, were but seldom. I preferred to live within my privileges, andkeep upon my own premises. I found this quite as much in accordance with goodpolicy, as with my own feelings. The effect was, that with the majority of thepassengers, all color distinctions were flung to the winds, and I found myselftreated with every mark of respect, from the beginning to the end of the voyage,except in a single instance; and in that, I came near being mobbed, forcomplying with an invitation given me by the passengers, and the captain of the“Cambria,” to deliver a lecture on slavery. Our New Orleans and Georgiapassengers were pleased to regard my lecture as an insult offered to them, andswore I should not speak. They went so far as to threaten to throw me overboard,and but for the firmness of Captain Judkins, probably would have (under theinspiration of slavery and brandy) attempted to put their threats intoexecution. I have no space to describe this scene, although its tragic and comicpeculiarities are well worth describing. An end was put to the melee, by thecaptain’s calling the ship’s company to put the salt water mobocrats in irons.At this determined order, the gentlemen of the lash scampered, and for the restof the voyage conducted themselves very decorously.This incident of the voyage, in two days after landing at Liverpool, brought meat once before the British public, and that by no act of my own. The gentlemenso promptly snubbed in their meditated violence, flew to the press to justifytheir conduct, and to denounce me as a worthless and insolent Negro. This coursewas even less wise than the conduct it was intended to sustain; for, besidesawakening something like a national interest in me, and securing me an audience,it brought out counter statements, and threw the blame upon themselves, whichthey had sought to fasten upon me and the gallant captain of the ship.Some notion may be formed of the difference in my feelings and circumstances,while abroad, from the following extract from one of a series of lettersaddressed by me to Mr. Garrison, and published in the Liberator. It was writtenon the first day of January, 1846:MY DEAR FRIEND GARRISON: Up to this time, I have given no direct expression ofthe views, feelings, and opinions which I have formed, respecting the characterand condition of the people of this land. I have refrained thus, purposely. Iwish to speak advisedly, and in order to do this, I have waited till, I trust,experience has brought my opinions to an intelligent maturity. I have been thuscareful, not because I think what I say will have much effect in shaping theopinions of the world, but because whatever of influence I may possess, whetherlittle or much, I wish it to go in the right direction, and according to truth.I hardly need say that, in speaking of Ireland, I shall be influenced by noprejudices in favor of America. I think my circumstances all forbid that. I haveno end to serve, no creed to uphold, no government to defend; and as to nation,I belong to none. I have no protection at home, or resting-place abroad. Theland of my birth welcomes me to her shores only as a slave, and spurns withcontempt the idea of treating me differently; so that I am an outcast from thesociety of my childhood, and an outlaw in the land of my birth. “I am a strangerwith thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.” That men should bepatriotic, is to me perfectly natural; and as a philosophical fact, I am able togive it an intellectual recognition. But no further can I go. If ever I had anypatriotism, or any capacity for the feeling, it was whipped out of me longsince, by the lash of the American soul-drivers.In thinking of America, I sometimes find myself admiring her bright blue sky,her grand old woods, her fertile fields, her beautiful rivers, her mighty lakes,and star-crowned mountains. But my rapture is soon checked, my joy is soonturned to mourning. When I remember that all is cursed with the infernal spiritof slaveholding, robbery, and wrong; when I remember that with the waters of hernoblest rivers, the tears of my brethren are borne to the ocean, disregarded andforgotten, and that her most fertile fields drink daily of the warm blood of myoutraged sisters; I am filled with unutterable loathing, and led to reproachmyself that anything could fall from my lips in praise of such a land. Americawill not allow her children to love her. She seems bent on compelling those whowould be her warmest friends, to be her worst enemies. May God give herrepentance, before it is too late, is the ardent prayer of my heart. I willcontinue to pray, labor, and wait, believing that she cannot always beinsensible to the dictates of justice, or deaf to the voice of humanity.My opportunities for learning the character and condition of the people of thisland have been very great. I have traveled almost from the Hill of Howth to theGiant’s Causeway, and from the Giant’s Causway, to Cape Clear. During thesetravels, I have met with much in the chara@@ and condition of the people toapprove, and much to condemn; much that @@thrilled me with pleasure, and verymuch that has filled me with pain. I @@ @@t, in this letter, attempt to give anydescription of those scenes which have given me pain. This I will do hereafter.I have enough, and more than your subscribers will be disposed to read at onetime, of the bright side of the picture. I can truly say, I have spent some ofthe happiest moments of my life since landing in this country. I seem to haveundergone a transformation. I live a new life. The warm and generous cooperationextended to me by the friends of my despised race; the prompt and liberal mannerwith which the press has rendered me its aid; the glorious enthusiasm with whichthousands have flocked to hear the cruel wrongs of my down-trodden andlong-enslaved fellow-countrymen portrayed; the deep sympathy for the slave, andthe strong abhorrence of the slaveholder, everywhere evinced; the cordialitywith which members and ministers of various religious bodies, and of variousshades of religious opinion, have embraced me, and lent me their aid; the kindof hospitality constantly proffered to me by persons of the highest rank insociety; the spirit of freedom that seems to animate all with whom I come incontact, and the entire absence of everything that looked like prejudice againstme, on account of the color of my skin—contrasted so strongly with my long andbitter experience in the United States, that I look with wonder and amazement onthe transition. In the southern part of the United States, I was a slave,thought of and spoken of as property; in the language of the LAW, “held, taken,reputed, and adjudged to be a chattel in the hands of my owners and possessors,and their executors, administrators, and assigns, to all intents, constructions,and purposes whatsoever.” (Brev. Digest, 224). In the northern states, afugitive slave, liable to be hunted at any moment, like a felon, and to behurled into the terrible jaws of slavery—doomed by an inveterate prejudiceagainst color to insult and outrage on every hand (Massachusetts out of thequestion)—denied the privileges and courtesies common to others in the use ofthe most humble means of conveyance—shut out from the cabins onsteamboats—refused admission to respectable hotels—caricatured, scorned,scoffed, mocked, and maltreated with impunity by any one (no matter how blackhis heart), so he has a white skin. But now behold the change! Eleven days and ahalf gone, and I have crossed three thousand miles of the perilous deep. Insteadof a democratic government, I am under a monarchical government. Instead of thebright, blue sky of America, I am covered with the soft, grey fog of the EmeraldIsle. I breathe, and lo! the chattel becomes a man. I gaze around in vain forone who will question my equal humanity, claim me as his slave, or offer me aninsult. I employ a cab—I am seated beside white people—I reach the hotel—I enterthe same door—I am shown into the same parlor—I dine at the same table and noone is offended. No delicate nose grows deformed in my presence. I find nodifficulty here in obtaining admission into any place of worship, instruction,or amusement, on equal terms with people as white as any I ever saw in theUnited States. I meet nothing to remind me of my complexion. I find myselfregarded and treated at every turn with the kindness and deference paid to whitepeople. When I go to church, I am met by no upturned nose and scornful lip totell me, “We don’t allow niggers in here!”I remember, about two years ago, there was in Boston, near the south-west cornerof Boston Common, a menagerie. I had long desired to see such a collection as Iunderstood was being exhibited there. Never having had an opportunity while aslave, I resolved to seize this, my first, since my escape. I went, and as Iapproached the entrance to gain admission, I was met and told by thedoor-keeper, in a harsh and contemptuous tone, “We don’t allow niggers in here.”I also remember attending a revival meeting in the Rev. Henry Jackson’smeeting-house, at New Bedford, and going up the broad aisle to find a seat, Iwas met by a good deacon, who told me, in a pious tone, “We don’t allow niggersin here!” Soon after my arrival in New Bedford, from the south, I had a strongdesire to attend the Lyceum, but was told, “They don’t allow niggers in here!”While passing from New York to Boston, on the steamer Massachusetts, on thenight of the 9th of December, 1843, when chilled almost through with the cold, Iwent into the cabin to get a little warm. I was soon touched upon the shoulder,and told, “We don’t allow niggers in here!” On arriving in Boston, from ananti-slavery tour, hungry and tired, I went into an eating-house, near myfriend, Mr. Campbell’s to get some refreshments. I was met by a lad in a whiteapron, “We don’t allow niggers in here!” A week or two before leaving the UnitedStates, I had a meeting appointed at Weymouth, the home of that glorious band oftrue abolitionists, the Weston family, and others. On attempting to take a seatin the omnibus to that place, I was told by the driver (and I never shall forgethis fiendish hate). “I don’t allow niggers in here!” Thank heaven for therespite I now enjoy! I had been in Dublin but a few days, when a gentleman ofgreat respectability kindly offered to conduct me through all the publicbuildings of that beautiful city; and a little afterward, I found myself diningwith the lord mayor of Dublin. What a pity there was not some Americandemocratic Christian at the door of his splendid mansion, to bark out at myapproach, “They don’t allow niggers in here!” The truth is, the people here knownothing of the republican Negro hate prevalent in our glorious land. Theymeasure and esteem men according to their moral and intellectual worth, and notaccording to the color of their skin. Whatever may be said of the aristocracieshere, there is none based on the color of a man’s skin. This species ofaristocracy belongs preeminently to “the land of the free, and the home of thebrave.” I have never found it abroad, in any but Americans. It sticks to themwherever they go. They find it almost as hard to get rid of, as to get rid oftheir skins.The second day after my arrival at Liverpool, in company with my friend, Buffum,and several other friends, I went to Eaton Hall, the residence of the Marquis ofWestminster, one of the most splendid buildings in England. On approaching thedoor, I found several of our American passengers, who came out with us in the“Cambria,” waiting for admission, as but one party was allowed in the house at atime. We all had to wait till the company within came out. And of all the faces,expressive of chagrin, those of the Americans were preeminent. They looked assour as vinegar, and as bitter as gall, when they found I was to be admitted onequal terms with themselves. When the door was opened, I walked in, on an equalfooting with my white fellow-citizens, and from all I could see, I had as muchattention paid me by the servants that showed us through the house, as any witha paler skin. As I walked through the building, the statuary did not fall down,the pictures did not leap from their places, the doors did not refuse to open,and the servants did not say, “We don’t allow niggers in here!”A happy new-year to you, and all the friends of freedom.My time and labors, while abroad were divided between England, Ireland,Scotland, and Wales. Upon this experience alone, I might write a book twice thesize of this, My Bondage and My Freedom. I visited and lectured in nearly allthe large towns and cities in the United Kingdom, and enjoyed many favorableopportunities for observation and information. But books on England areabundant, and the public may, therefore, dismiss any fear that I am meditatinganother infliction in that line; though, in truth, I should like much to write abook on those countries, if for nothing else, to make grateful mention of themany dear friends, whose benevolent actions toward me are ineffaceably stampedupon my memory, and warmly treasured in my heart. To these friends I owe myfreedom in the United States. On their own motion, without any solicitation fromme (Mrs. Henry Richardson, a clever lady, remarkable for her devotion to everygood work, taking the lead), they raised a fund sufficient to purchase myfreedom, and actually paid it over, and placed the papers 8[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-8] ofmy manumission in my hands, before they would tolerate the idea of my returningto this, my native country. To this commercial transaction I owe my exemptionfrom the democratic operation of the Fugitive Slave Bill of 1850. But for this,I might at any time become a victim of this most cruel and scandalous enactment,and be doomed to end my life, as I began it, a slave. The sum paid for myfreedom was one hundred and fifty pounds sterling.Some of my uncompromising anti-slavery friends in this country failed to see thewisdom of this arrangement, and were not pleased that I consented to it, even bymy silence. They thought it a violation of anti-slavery principles—conceding aright of property in man—and a wasteful expenditure of money. On the other hand,viewing it simply in the light of a ransom, or as money extorted by a robber,and my liberty of more value than one hundred and fifty pounds sterling, I couldnot see either a violation of the laws of morality, or those of economy, in thetransaction.It is true, I was not in the possession of my claimants, and could have easilyremained in England, for the same friends who had so generously purchased myfreedom, would have assisted me in establishing myself in that country. To this,however, I could not consent. I felt that I had a duty to perform—and that was,to labor and suffer with the oppressed in my native land. Considering,therefore, all the circumstances—the fugitive slave bill included—I think thevery best thing was done in letting Master Hugh have the hundred and fiftypounds sterling, and leaving me free to return to my appropriate field of labor.Had I been a private person, having no other relations or duties than those of apersonal and family nature, I should never have consented to the payment of solarge a sum for the privilege of living securely under our glorious republicanform of government. I could have remained in England, or have gone to some othercountry; and perhaps I could even have lived unobserved in this. But to this Icould not consent. I had already become some what notorious, and withal quite asunpopular as notorious; and I was, therefore, much exposed to arrest andrecapture.The main object to which my labors in Great Britain were directed, was theconcentration of the moral and religious sentiment of its people againstAmerican slavery. England is often charged with having established slavery inthe United States, and if there were no other justification than this, forappealing to her people to lend their moral aid for the abolition of slavery, Ishould be justified. My speeches in Great Britain were wholly extemporaneous,and I may not always have been so guarded in my expressions, as I otherwiseshould have been. I was ten years younger then than now, and only seven yearsfrom slavery. I cannot give the reader a better idea of the nature of mydiscourses, than by republishing one of them, delivered in Finsbury chapel,London, to an audience of about two thousand persons, and which was published inthe London Universe, at the time. 9[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-9]Those in the United States who may regard this speech as being harsh in itsspirit and unjust in its statements, because delivered before an audiencesupposed to be anti-republican in their principles and feelings, may view thematter differently, when they learn that the case supposed did not exist. It sohappened that the great mass of the people in England who attended andpatronized my anti-slavery meetings, were, in truth, about as good republicansas the mass of Americans, and with this decided advantage over the latter—theyare lovers of republicanism for all men, for black men as well as for white men.They are the people who sympathize with Louis Kossuth and Mazzini, and with theoppressed and enslaved, of every color and nation, the world over. Theyconstitute the democratic element in British politics, and are as much opposedto the union of church and state as we, in America, are to such an union. At themeeting where this speech was delivered, Joseph Sturge—a world-widephilanthropist, and a member of the society of Friends—presided, and addressedthe meeting. George William Alexander, another Friend, who has spent more thanan Ameriacn(sic) fortune in promoting the anti-slavery cause in differentsections of the world, was on the platform; and also Dr. Campbell (now of theBritish Banner) who combines all the humane tenderness of Melanchthon, with thedirectness and boldness of Luther. He is in the very front ranks ofnon-conformists, and looks with no unfriendly eye upon America. George Thompson,too, was there; and America will yet own that he did a true man’s work inrelighting the rapidly dying-out fire of true republicanism in the Americanheart, and be ashamed of the treatment he met at her hands. Coming generationsin this country will applaud the spirit of this much abused republican friend offreedom. There were others of note seated on the platform, who would gladlyingraft upon English institutions all that is purely republican in theinstitutions of America. Nothing, therefore, must be set down against thisspeech on the score that it was delivered in the presence of those who cannotappreciate the many excellent things belonging to our system of government, andwith a view to stir up prejudice against republican institutions.Again, let it also be remembered—for it is the simple truth—that neither in thisspeech, nor in any other which I delivered in England, did I ever allow myselfto address Englishmen as against Americans. I took my stand on the high groundof human brotherhood, and spoke to Englishmen as men, in behalf of men. Slaveryis a crime, not against Englishmen, but against God, and all the members of thehuman family; and it belongs to the whole human family to seek its suppression.In a letter to Mr. Greeley, of the New York Tribune, written while abroad, Isaid:I am, nevertheless aware that the wisdom of exposing the sins of one nation inthe ear of another, has been seriously questioned by good and clear-sightedpeople, both on this and on your side of the Atlantic. And the thought is notwithout weight on my own mind. I am satisfied that there are many evils whichcan be best removed by confining our efforts to the immediate locality wheresuch evils exist. This, however, is by no means the case with the system ofslavery. It is such a giant sin—such a monstrous aggregation of iniquity—sohardening to the human heart—so destructive to the moral sense, and so wellcalculated to beget a character, in every one around it, favorable to its owncontinuance,—that I feel not only at liberty, but abundantly justified, inappealing to the whole world to aid in its removal.But, even if I had—as has been often charged—labored to bring Americaninstitutions generally into disrepute, and had not confined my labors strictlywithin the limits of humanity and morality, I should not have been withoutillustrious examples to support me. Driven into semi-exile by civil andbarbarous laws, and by a system which cannot be thought of without a shudder, Iwas fully justified in turning, if possible, the tide of the moral universeagainst the heaven-daring outrage.Four circumstances greatly assisted me in getting the question of Americanslavery before the British public. First, the mob on board the “Cambria,”already referred to, which was a sort of national announcement of my arrival inEngland. Secondly, the highly reprehensible course pursued by the Free Church ofScotland, in soliciting, receiving, and retaining money in its sustentation fundfor supporting the gospel in Scotland, which was evidently the ill-gotten gainof slaveholders and slave-traders. Third, the great Evangelical Alliance—orrather the attempt to form such an alliance, which should include slaveholdersof a certain description—added immensely to the interest felt in the slaveryquestion. About the same time, there was the World’s Temperance Convention,where I had the misfortune to come in collision with sundry American doctors ofdivinity—Dr. Cox among the number—with whom I had a small controversy.It has happened to me—as it has happened to most other men engaged in a goodcause—often to be more indebted to my enemies than to my own skill or to theassistance of my friends, for whatever success has attended my labors. Greatsurprise was expressed by American newspapers, north and south, during my stayin Great Britain, that a person so illiterate and insignificant as myself couldawaken an interest so marked in England. These papers were not the only partiessurprised. I was myself not far behind them in surprise. But the very contemptand scorn, the systematic and extravagant disparagement of which I was theobject, served, perhaps, to magnify my few merits, and to render me of someaccount, whether deserving or not. A man is sometimes made great, by thegreatness of the abuse a portion of mankind may think proper to heap upon him.Whether I was of as much consequence as the English papers made me out to be, ornot, it was easily seen, in England, that I could not be the ignorant andworthless creature, some of the American papers would have them believe I was.Men, in their senses, do not take bowie-knives to kill mosquitoes, nor pistolsto shoot flies; and the American passengers who thought proper to get up a mobto silence me, on board the “Cambria,” took the most effective method of tellingthe British public that I had something to say.But to the second circumstance, namely, the position of the Free Church ofScotland, with the great Doctors Chalmers, Cunningham, and Candlish at its head.That church, with its leaders, put it out of the power of the Scotch people toask the old question, which we in the north have often most wickedly asked—“Whathave we to do with slavery?” That church had taken the price of blood into itstreasury, with which to build free churches, and to pay free church ministersfor preaching the gospel; and, worse still, when honest John Murray, of BowlienBay—now gone to his reward in heaven—with William Smeal, Andrew Paton, FrederickCard, and other sterling anti-slavery men in Glasgow, denounced the transactionas disgraceful and shocking to the religious sentiment of Scotland, this church,through its leading divines, instead of repenting and seeking to mend themistake into which it had fallen, made it a flagrant sin, by undertaking todefend, in the name of God and the bible, the principle not only of taking themoney of slave-dealers to build churches, but of holding fellowship with theholders and traffickers in human flesh. This, the reader will see, brought upthe whole question of slavery, and opened the way to its full discussion,without any agency of mine. I have never seen a people more deeply moved thanwere the people of Scotland, on this very question. Public meeting succeededpublic meeting. Speech after speech, pamphlet after pamphlet, editorial aftereditorial, sermon after sermon, soon lashed the conscientious Scotch people intoa perfect furore. “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was indignantly cried out, fromGreenock to Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh to Aberdeen. George Thompson, ofLondon, Henry C. Wright, of the United States, James N. Buffum, of Lynn,Massachusetts, and myself were on the anti-slavery side; and Doctors Chalmers,Cunningham, and Candlish on the other. In a conflict where the latter could havehad even the show of right, the truth, in our hands as against them, must havebeen driven to the wall; and while I believe we were able to carry theconscience of the country against the action of the Free Church, the battle, itmust be confessed, was a hard-fought one. Abler defenders of the doctrine offellowshiping slaveholders as christians, have not been met with. In defendingthis doctrine, it was necessary to deny that slavery is a sin. If driven fromthis position, they were compelled to deny that slaveholders were responsiblefor the sin; and if driven from both these positions, they must deny that it isa sin in such a sense, and that slaveholders are sinners in such a sense, as tomake it wrong, in the circumstances in which they were placed, to recognize themas Christians. Dr. Cunningham was the most powerful debater on the slavery sideof the question; Mr. Thompson was the ablest on the anti-slavery side. A sceneoccurred between these two men, a parallel to which I think I never witnessedbefore, and I know I never have since. The scene was caused by a singleexclamation on the part of Mr. Thompson.The general assembly of the Free Church was in progress at Cannon Mills,Edinburgh. The building would hold about twenty-five hundred persons; and onthis occasion it was densely packed, notice having been given that DoctorsCunningham and Candlish would speak, that day, in defense of the relations ofthe Free Church of Scotland to slavery in America. Messrs. Thompson, Buffum,myself, and a few anti-slavery friends, attended, but sat at such a distance,and in such a position, that, perhaps we were not observed from the platform.The excitement was intense, having been greatly increased by a series ofmeetings held by Messrs. Thompson, Wright, Buffum, and myself, in the mostsplendid hall in that most beautiful city, just previous to the meetings of thegeneral assembly. “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” stared at us from every street corner;“SEND BACK THE MONEY!” in large capitals, adorned the broad flags of thepavement; “SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was the chorus of the popular street songs;“SEND BACK THE MONEY!” was the heading of leading editorials in the dailynewspapers. This day, at Cannon Mills, the great doctors of the church were togive an answer to this loud and stern demand. Men of all parties and all sectswere most eager to hear. Something great was expected. The occasion was great,the men great, and great speeches were expected from them.In addition to the outside pressure upon Doctors Cunningham and Candlish, therewas wavering in their own ranks. The conscience of the church itself was not atease. A dissatisfaction with the position of the church touching slavery, wassensibly manifest among the members, and something must be done to counteractthis untoward influence. The great Dr. Chalmers was in feeble health, at thetime. His most potent eloquence could not now be summoned to Cannon Mills, asformerly. He whose voice was able to rend asunder and dash down the granitewalls of the established church of Scotland, and to lead a host in solemnprocession from it, as from a doomed city, was now old and enfeebled. Besides,he had said his word on this very question; and his word had not silenced theclamor without, nor stilled the anxious heavings within. The occasion wasmomentous, and felt to be so. The church was in a perilous condition. A changeof some sort must take place in her condition, or she must go to pieces. Tostand where she did, was impossible. The whole weight of the matter fell onCunningham and Candlish. No shoulders in the church were broader than theirs;and I must say, badly as I detest the principles laid down and defended by them,I was compelled to acknowledge the vast mental endowments of the men. Cunninghamrose; and his rising was the signal for almost tumultous applause. You will saythis was scarcely in keeping with the solemnity of the occasion, but to me itserved to increase its grandeur and gravity. The applause, though tumultuous,was not joyous. It seemed to me, as it thundered up from the vast audience, likethe fall of an immense shaft, flung from shoulders already galled by itscrushing weight. It was like saying, “Doctor, we have borne this burden longenough, and willingly fling it upon you. Since it was you who brought it uponus, take it now, and do what you will with it, for we are too weary to bear it.[“no close”].Doctor Cunningham proceeded with his speech, abounding in logic, learning, andeloquence, and apparently bearing down all opposition; but at the moment—thefatal moment—when he was just bringing all his arguments to a point, and thatpoint being, that neither Jesus Christ nor his holy apostles regardedslaveholding as a sin, George Thompson, in a clear, sonorous, but rebukingvoice, broke the deep stillness of the audience, exclaiming, HEAR! HEAR! HEAR!The effect of this simple and common exclamation is almost incredible. It was asif a granite wall had been suddenly flung up against the advancing current of amighty river. For a moment, speaker and audience were brought to a dead silence.Both the doctor and his hearers seemed appalled by the audacity, as well as thefitness of the rebuke. At length a shout went up to the cry of “Put him out!”Happily, no one attempted to execute this cowardly order, and the doctorproceeded with his discourse. Not, however, as before, did the learned doctorproceed. The exclamation of Thompson must have reechoed itself a thousand timesin his memory, during the remainder of his speech, for the doctor neverrecovered from the blow.The deed was done, however; the pillars of the church—the proud, Free Church ofScotland—were committed and the humility of repentance was absent. The FreeChurch held on to the blood-stained money, and continued to justify itself inits position—and of course to apologize for slavery—and does so till this day.She lost a glorious opportunity for giving her voice, her vote, and her exampleto the cause of humanity; and to-day she is staggering under the curse of theenslaved, whose blood is in her skirts. The people of Scotland are, to this day,deeply grieved at the course pursued by the Free Church, and would hail, as arelief from a deep and blighting shame, the “sending back the money” to theslaveholders from whom it was gathered.One good result followed the conduct of the Free Church; it furnished anoccasion for making the people of Scotland thoroughly acquainted with thecharacter of slavery, and for arraying against the system the moral andreligious sentiment of that country. Therefore, while we did not succeed inaccomplishing the specific object of our mission, namely—procure the sendingback of the money—we were amply justified by the good which really did resultfrom our labors.Next comes the Evangelical Alliance. This was an attempt to form a union of allevangelical Christians throughout the world. Sixty or seventy American divinesattended, and some of them went there merely to weave a world-wide garment withwhich to clothe evangelical slaveholders. Foremost among these divines, was theRev. Samuel Hanson Cox, moderator of the New School Presbyterian GeneralAssembly. He and his friends spared no pains to secure a platform broad enoughto hold American slaveholders, and in this partly succeeded. But the question ofslavery is too large a question to be finally disposed of, even by theEvangelical Alliance. We appealed from the judgment of the Alliance, to thejudgment of the people of Great Britain, and with the happiest effect. Thiscontroversy with the Alliance might be made the subject of extended remark, butI must forbear, except to say, that this effort to shield the Christiancharacter of slaveholders greatly served to open a way to the British ear foranti-slavery discussion, and that it was well improved.The fourth and last circumstance that assisted me in getting before the Britishpublic, was an attempt on the part of certain doctors of divinity to silence meon the platform of the World’s Temperance Convention. Here I was brought intopoint blank collison with Rev. Dr. Cox, who made me the subject not only ofbitter remark in the convention, but also of a long denunciatory letterpublished in the New York Evangelist and other American papers. I replied to thedoctor as well as I could, and was successful in getting a respectful hearingbefore the British public, who are by nature and practice ardent lovers of fairplay, especially in a conflict between the weak and the strong.Thus did circumstances favor me, and favor the cause of which I strove to be theadvocate. After such distinguished notice, the public in both countries wascompelled to attach some importance to my labors. By the very ill usage Ireceived at the hands of Dr. Cox and his party, by the mob on board the“Cambria,” by the attacks made upon me in the American newspapers, and by theaspersions cast upon me through the organs of the Free Church of Scotland, Ibecame one of that class of men, who, for the moment, at least, “have greatnessforced upon them.” People became the more anxious to hear for themselves, and tojudge for themselves, of the truth which I had to unfold. While, therefore, itis by no means easy for a stranger to get fairly before the British public, itwas my lot to accomplish it in the easiest manner possible.Having continued in Great Britain and Ireland nearly two years, and being aboutto return to America—not as I left it, a slave, but a freeman—leading friends ofthe cause of emancipation in that country intimated their intention to make me atestimonial, not only on grounds of personal regard to myself, but also to thecause to which they were so ardently devoted. How far any such thing could havesucceeded, I do not know; but many reasons led me to prefer that my friendsshould simply give me the means of obtaining a printing press and printingmaterials, to enable me to start a paper, devoted to the interests of myenslaved and oppressed people. I told them that perhaps the greatest hinderanceto the adoption of abolition principles by the people of the United States, wasthe low estimate, everywhere in that country, placed upon the Negro, as a man;that because of his assumed natural inferiority, people reconciled themselves tohis enslavement and oppression, as things inevitable, if not desirable. Thegrand thing to be done, therefore, was to change the estimation in which thecolored people of the United States were held; to remove the prejudice whichdepreciated and depressed them; to prove them worthy of a higher consideration;to disprove their alleged inferiority, and demonstrate their capacity for a moreexalted civilization than slavery and prejudice had assigned to them. I furtherstated, that, in my judgment, a tolerably well conducted press, in the hands ofpersons of the despised race, by calling out the mental energies of the raceitself; by making them acquainted with their own latent powers; by enkindlingamong them the hope that for them there is a future; by developing their moralpower; by combining and reflecting their talents—would prove a most powerfulmeans of removing prejudice, and of awakening an interest in them. I furtherinformed them—and at that time the statement was true—that there was not, in theUnited States, a single newspaper regularly published by the colored people;that many attempts had been made to establish such papers; but that, up to thattime, they had all failed. These views I laid before my friends. The result was,nearly two thousand five hundred dollars were speedily raised toward starting mypaper. For this prompt and generous assistance, rendered upon my baresuggestion, without any personal efforts on my part, I shall never cease to feeldeeply grateful; and the thought of fulfilling the noble expectations of thedear friends who gave me this evidence of their confidence, will never cease tobe a motive for persevering exertion.Proposing to leave England, and turning my face toward America, in the spring of1847, I was met, on the threshold, with something which painfully reminded me ofthe kind of life which awaited me in my native land. For the first time in themany months spent abroad, I was met with proscription on account of my color. Afew weeks before departing from England, while in London, I was careful topurchase a ticket, and secure a berth for returning home, in the “Cambria”—thesteamer in which I left the United States—paying therefor the round sum of fortypounds and nineteen shillings sterling. This was first cabin fare. But on goingaboard the Cambria, I found that the Liverpool agent had ordered my berth to begiven to another, and had forbidden my entering the saloon! This contemptibleconduct met with stern rebuke from the British press. For, upon the point ofleaving England, I took occasion to expose the disgusting tyranny, in thecolumns of the London Times. That journal, and other leading journals throughoutthe United Kingdom, held up the outrage to unmitigated condemnation. So good anopportunity for calling out a full expression of British sentiment on thesubject, had not before occurred, and it was most fully embraced. The resultwas, that Mr. Cunard came out in a letter to the public journals, assuring themof his regret at the outrage, and promising that the like should never occuragain on board his steamers; and the like, we believe, has never since occurredon board the steamships of the Cunard line.It is not very pleasant to be made the subject of such insults; but if all suchnecessarily resulted as this one did, I should be very happy to bear, patiently,many more than I have borne, of the same sort. Albeit, the lash of proscription,to a man accustomed to equal social position, even for a time, as I was, has asting for the soul hardly less severe than that which bites the flesh and drawsthe blood from the back of the plantation slave. It was rather hard, afterhaving enjoyed nearly two years of equal social privileges in England, oftendining with gentlemen of great literary, social, political, and religiouseminence never, during the whole time, having met with a single word, look, orgesture, which gave me the slightest reason to think my color was an offense toanybody—now to be cooped up in the stern of the “Cambria,” and denied the rightto enter the saloon, lest my dark presence should be deemed an offense to someof my democratic fellow-passengers. The reader will easily imagine what musthave been my feelings."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XXV. VARIOUS INCIDENTSNEWSPAPER ENTERPRISE—UNEXPECTED OPPOSITION—THE OBJECTIONS TO IT—THEIRPLAUSIBILITY ADMITTED—MOTIVES FOR COMING TO ROCHESTER—DISCIPLE OF MR.GARRISON—CHANGE OF OPINION—CAUSES LEADING TO IT—THE CONSEQUENCES OFTHE CHANGE—PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR—AMUSING CONDESCENSION—“JIM CROWCARS”—COLLISIONS WITH CONDUCTORS AND BRAKEMEN—TRAINS ORDERED NOT TOSTOP AT LYNN—AMUSING DOMESTIC SCENE—SEPARATE TABLES FOR MASTER ANDMAN—PREJUDICE UNNATURAL—ILLUSTRATIONS—IN HIGH COMPANY—ELEVATION OFTHE FREE PEOPLE OF COLOR—PLEDGE FOR THE FUTURE.I have now given the reader an imperfect sketch of nine years’ experience infreedom—three years as a common laborer on the wharves of New Bedford, fouryears as a lecturer in New England, and two years of semi-exile in Great Britainand Ireland. A single ray of light remains to be flung upon my life during thelast eight years, and my story will be done.A trial awaited me on my return from England to the United States, for which Iwas but very imperfectly prepared. My plans for my then future usefulness as ananti-slavery advocate were all settled. My friends in England had resolved toraise a given sum to purchase for me a press and printing materials; and Ialready saw myself wielding my pen, as well as my voice, in the great work ofrenovating the public mind, and building up a public sentiment which should, atleast, send slavery and oppression to the grave, and restore to “liberty and thepursuit of happiness” the people with whom I had suffered, both as a slave andas a freeman. Intimation had reached my friends in Boston of what I intended todo, before my arrival, and I was prepared to find them favorably disposed towardmy much cherished enterprise. In this I was mistaken. I found them veryearnestly opposed to the idea of my starting a paper, and for several reasons.First, the paper was not needed; secondly, it would interfere with my usefulnessas a lecturer; thirdly, I was better fitted to speak than to write; fourthly,the paper could not succeed. This opposition, from a quarter so highly esteemed,and to which I had been accustomed to look for advice and direction, caused menot only to hesitate, but inclined me to abandon the enterprise. All previousattempts to establish such a journal having failed, I felt that probably Ishould but add another to the list of failures, and thus contribute anotherproof of the mental and moral deficiencies of my race. Very much that was saidto me in respect to my imperfect literary acquirements, I felt to be mostpainfully true. The unsuccessful projectors of all the previous colorednewspapers were my superiors in point of education, and if they failed, howcould I hope for success? Yet I did hope for success, and persisted in theundertaking. Some of my English friends greatly encouraged me to go forward, andI shall never cease to be grateful for their words of cheer and generous deeds.I can easily pardon those who have denounced me as ambitious and presumptuous,in view of my persistence in this enterprise. I was but nine years from slavery.In point of mental experience, I was but nine years old. That one, in suchcircumstances, should aspire to establish a printing press, among an educatedpeople, might well be considered, if not ambitious, quite silly. My Americanfriends looked at me with astonishment! “A wood-sawyer” offering himself to thepublic as an editor! A slave, brought up in the very depths of ignorance,assuming to instruct the highly civilized people of the north in the principlesof liberty, justice, and humanity! The thing looked absurd. Nevertheless, Ipersevered. I felt that the want of education, great as it was, could beovercome by study, and that knowledge would come by experience; and further(which was perhaps the most controlling consideration). I thought that anintelligent public, knowing my early history, would easily pardon a large shareof the deficiencies which I was sure that my paper would exhibit. The mostdistressing thing, however, was the offense which I was about to give my Bostonfriends, by what seemed to them a reckless disregard of their sage advice. I amnot sure that I was not under the influence of something like a slavishadoration of my Boston friends, and I labored hard to convince them of thewisdom of my undertaking, but without success. Indeed, I never expect tosucceed, although time has answered all their original objections. The paper hasbeen successful. It is a large sheet, costing eighty dollars per week—has threethousand subscribers—has been published regularly nearly eight years—and bidsfair to stand eight years longer. At any rate, the eight years to come are asfull of promise as were the eight that are past.It is not to be concealed, however, that the maintenance of such a journal,under the circumstances, has been a work of much difficulty; and could all theperplexity, anxiety, and trouble attending it, have been clearly foreseen, Imight have shrunk from the undertaking. As it is, I rejoice in having engaged inthe enterprise, and count it joy to have been able to suffer, in many ways, forits success, and for the success of the cause to which it has been faithfullydevoted. I look upon the time, money, and labor bestowed upon it, as being amplyrewarded, in the development of my own mental and moral energies, and in thecorresponding development of my deeply injured and oppressed people.From motives of peace, instead of issuing my paper in Boston, among my NewEngland friends, I came to Rochester, western New York, among strangers, wherethe circulation of my paper could not interfere with the local circulation ofthe Liberator and the Standard; for at that time I was, on the anti-slaveryquestion, a faithful disciple of William Lloyd Garrison, and fully committed tohis doctrine touching the pro-slavery character of the constitution of theUnited States, and the non-voting principle, of which he is the known anddistinguished advocate. With Mr. Garrison, I held it to be the first duty of thenon-slaveholding states to dissolve the union with the slaveholding states; andhence my cry, like his, was, “No union with slaveholders.” With these views, Icame into western New York; and during the first four years of my labor here, Iadvocated them with pen and tongue, according to the best of my ability.About four years ago, upon a reconsideration of the whole subject, I becameconvinced that there was no necessity for dissolving the “union between thenorthern and southern states;” that to seek this dissolution was no part of myduty as an abolitionist; that to abstain from voting, was to refuse to exercisea legitimate and powerful means for abolishing slavery; and that theconstitution of the United States not only contained no guarantees in favor ofslavery, but, on the contrary, it is, in its letter and spirit, an anti-slaveryinstrument, demanding the abolition of slavery as a condition of its ownexistence, as the supreme law of the land.Here was a radical change in my opinions, and in the action logically resultingfrom that change. To those with whom I had been in agreement and in sympathy, Iwas now in opposition. What they held to be a great and important truth, I nowlooked upon as a dangerous error. A very painful, and yet a very natural, thingnow happened. Those who could not see any honest reasons for changing theirviews, as I had done, could not easily see any such reasons for my change, andthe common punishment of apostates was mine.The opinions first entertained were naturally derived and honestly entertained,and I trust that my present opinions have the same claims to respect. Broughtdirectly, when I escaped from slavery, into contact with a class ofabolitionists regarding the constitution as a slaveholding instrument, andfinding their views supported by the united and entire history of everydepartment of the government, it is not strange that I assumed the constitutionto be just what their interpretation made it. I was bound, not only by theirsuperior knowledge, to take their opinions as the true ones, in respect to thesubject, but also because I had no means of showing their unsoundness. But forthe responsibility of conducting a public journal, and the necessity imposedupon me of meeting opposite views from abolitionists in this state, I should inall probability have remained as firm in my disunion views as any other discipleof William Lloyd Garrison.My new circumstances compelled me to re-think the whole subject, and to study,with some care, not only the just and proper rules of legal interpretation, butthe origin, design, nature, rights, powers, and duties of civil government, andalso the relations which human beings sustain to it. By such a course of thoughtand reading, I was conducted to the conclusion that the constitution of theUnited States—inaugurated “to form a more perfect union, establish justice,insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote thegeneral welfare, and secure the blessing of liberty”—could not well have beendesigned at the same time to maintain and perpetuate a system of rapine andmurder, like slavery; especially, as not one word can be found in theconstitution to authorize such a belief. Then, again, if the declared purposesof an instrument are to govern the meaning of all its parts and details, as theyclearly should, the constitution of our country is our warrant for the abolitionof slavery in every state in the American Union. I mean, however, not to argue,but simply to state my views. It would require very many pages of a volume likethis, to set forth the arguments demonstrating the unconstitutionality and thecomplete illegality of slavery in our land; and as my experience, and not myarguments, is within the scope and contemplation of this volume, I omit thelatter and proceed with the former.I will now ask the kind reader to go back a little in my story, while I bring upa thread left behind for convenience sake, but which, small as it is, cannot beproperly omitted altogether; and that thread is American prejudice againstcolor, and its varied illustrations in my own experience.When I first went among the abolitionists of New England, and began to travel, Ifound this prejudice very strong and very annoying. The abolitionists themselveswere not entirely free from it, and I could see that they were nobly strugglingagainst it. In their eagerness, sometimes, to show their contempt for thefeeling, they proved that they had not entirely recovered from it; oftenillustrating the saying, in their conduct, that a man may “stand up so straightas to lean backward.” When it was said to me, “Mr. Douglass, I will walk tomeeting with you; I am not afraid of a black man,” I could not helpthinking—seeing nothing very frightful in my appearance—“And why should you be?”The children at the north had all been educated to believe that if they werebad, the old black man—not the old devil—would get them; and it was evidence ofsome courage, for any so educated to get the better of their fears.The custom of providing separate cars for the accommodation of coloredtravelers, was established on nearly all the railroads of New England, a dozenyears ago. Regarding this custom as fostering the spirit of caste, I made it arule to seat myself in the cars for the accommodation of passengers generally.Thus seated, I was sure to be called upon to betake myself to the “Jim Crowcar.” Refusing to obey, I was often dragged out of my seat, beaten, and severelybruised, by conductors and brakemen. Attempting to start from Lynn, one day, forNewburyport, on the Eastern railroad, I went, as my custom was, into one of thebest railroad carriages on the road. The seats were very luxuriant andbeautiful. I was soon waited upon by the conductor, and ordered out; whereupon Idemanded the reason for my invidious removal. After a good deal of parleying, Iwas told that it was because I was black. This I denied, and appealed to thecompany to sustain my denial; but they were evidently unwilling to committhemselves, on a point so delicate, and requiring such nice powers ofdiscrimination, for they remained as dumb as death. I was soon waited on by halfa dozen fellows of the baser sort (just such as would volunteer to take abull-dog out of a meeting-house in time of public worship), and told that I mustmove out of that seat, and if I did not, they would drag me out. I refused tomove, and they clutched me, head, neck, and shoulders. But, in anticipation ofthe stretching to which I was about to be subjected, I had interwoven myselfamong the seats. In dragging me out, on this occasion, it must have cost thecompany twenty-five or thirty dollars, for I tore up seats and all. So great wasthe excitement in Lynn, on the subject, that the superintendent, Mr. Stephen A.Chase, ordered the trains to run through Lynn without stopping, while I remainedin that town; and this ridiculous farce was enacted. For several days the trainswent dashing through Lynn without stopping. At the same time that they excludeda free colored man from their cars, this same company allowed slaves, in companywith their masters and mistresses, to ride unmolested.After many battles with the railroad conductors, and being roughly handled innot a few instances, proscription was at last abandoned; and the “Jim Crowcar”—set up for the degradation of colored people—is nowhere found in NewEngland. This result was not brought about without the intervention of thepeople, and the threatened enactment of a law compelling railroad companies torespect the rights of travelers. Hon. Charles Francis Adams performed signalservice in the Massachusetts legislature, in bringing this reformation; and tohim the colored citizens of that state are deeply indebted.Although often annoyed, and sometimes outraged, by this prejudice against color,I am indebted to it for many passages of quiet amusement. A half-cured subjectof it is sometimes driven into awkward straits, especially if he happens to geta genuine specimen of the race into his house.In the summer of 1843, I was traveling and lecturing, in company with William A.White, Esq., through the state of Indiana. Anti-slavery friends were not veryabundant in Indiana, at that time, and beds were not more plentiful thanfriends. We often slept out, in preference to sleeping in the houses, at somepoints. At the close of one of our meetings, we were invited home with akindly-disposed old farmer, who, in the generous enthusiasm of the moment,seemed to have forgotten that he had but one spare bed, and that his guests werean ill-matched pair. All went on pretty well, till near bed time, when signs ofuneasiness began to show themselves, among the unsophisticated sons anddaughters. White is remarkably fine looking, and very evidently a borngentleman; the idea of putting us in the same bed was hardly to be tolerated;and yet, there we were, and but the one bed for us, and that, by the way, was inthe same room occupied by the other members of the family. White, as well as I,perceived the difficulty, for yonder slept the old folks, there the sons, and alittle farther along slept the daughters; and but one other bed remained. Whoshould have this bed, was the puzzling question. There was some whisperingbetween the old folks, some confused looks among the young, as the time forgoing to bed approached. After witnessing the confusion as long as I liked, Irelieved the kindly-disposed family by playfully saying, “Friend White, havinggot entirely rid of my prejudice against color, I think, as a proof of it, Imust allow you to sleep with me to-night.” White kept up the joke, by seeming toesteem himself the favored party, and thus the difficulty was removed. If wewent to a hotel, and called for dinner, the landlord was sure to set one tablefor White and another for me, always taking him to be master, and me theservant. Large eyes were generally made when the order was given to remove thedishes from my table to that of White’s. In those days, it was thought strangethat a white man and a colored man could dine peaceably at the same table, andin some parts the strangeness of such a sight has not entirely subsided.Some people will have it that there is a natural, an inherent, and an invinciblerepugnance in the breast of the white race toward dark-colored people; and somevery intelligent colored men think that their proscription is owing solely tothe color which nature has given them. They hold that they are rated accordingto their color, and that it is impossible for white people ever to look upondark races of men, or men belonging to the African race, with other thanfeelings of aversion. My experience, both serious and mirthful, combats thisconclusion. Leaving out of sight, for a moment, grave facts, to this point, Iwill state one or two, which illustrate a very interesting feature of Americancharacter as well as American prejudice. Riding from Boston to Albany, a fewyears ago, I found myself in a large car, well filled with passengers. The seatnext to me was about the only vacant one. At every stopping place we took in newpassengers, all of whom, on reaching the seat next to me, cast a disdainfulglance upon it, and passed to another car, leaving me in the full enjoyment of ahole form. For a time, I did not know but that my riding there was prejudicialto the interest of the railroad company. A circumstance occurred, however, whichgave me an elevated position at once. Among the passengers on this train wasGov. George N. Briggs. I was not acquainted with him, and had no idea that I wasknown to him, however, I was, for upon observing me, the governor left hisplace, and making his way toward me, respectfully asked the privilege of a seatby my side; and upon introducing himself, we entered into a conversation verypleasant and instructive to me. The despised seat now became honored. Hisexcellency had removed all the prejudice against sitting by the side of a Negro;and upon his leaving it, as he did, on reaching Pittsfield, there were at leastone dozen applicants for the place. The governor had, without changing my skin asingle shade, made the place respectable which before was despicable.A similar incident happened to me once on the Boston and New Bedford railroad,and the leading party to it has since been governor of the state ofMassachusetts. I allude to Col. John Henry Clifford. Lest the reader may fancy Iam aiming to elevate myself, by claiming too much intimacy with great men, Imust state that my only acquaintance with Col. Clifford was formed while I washis hired servant, during the first winter of my escape from slavery. I owe ithim to say, that in that relation I found him always kind and gentlemanly. Butto the incident. I entered a car at Boston, for New Bedford, which, with theexception of a single seat was full, and found I must occupy this, or stand up,during the journey. Having no mind to do this, I stepped up to the man havingthe next seat, and who had a few parcels on the seat, and gently asked leave totake a seat by his side. My fellow-passenger gave me a look made up of reproachand indignation, and asked me why I should come to that particular seat. Iassured him, in the gentlest manner, that of all others this was the seat forme. Finding that I was actually about to sit down, he sang out, “O! stop, stop!and let me get out!” Suiting the action to the word, up the agitated man got,and sauntered to the other end of the car, and was compelled to stand for mostof the way thereafter. Halfway to New Bedford, or more, Col. Clifford,recognizing me, left his seat, and not having seen me before since I had ceasedto wait on him (in everything except hard arguments against his pro-slaveryposition), apparently forgetful of his rank, manifested, in greeting me,something of the feeling of an old friend. This demonstration was not lost onthe gentleman whose dignity I had, an hour before, most seriously offended. Col.Clifford was known to be about the most aristocratic gentleman in Bristolcounty; and it was evidently thought that I must be somebody, else I should nothave been thus noticed, by a person so distinguished. Sure enough, after Col.Clifford left me, I found myself surrounded with friends; and among the number,my offended friend stood nearest, and with an apology for his rudeness, which Icould not resist, although it was one of the lamest ever offered. With suchfacts as these before me—and I have many of them—I am inclined to think thatpride and fashion have much to do with the treatment commonly extended tocolored people in the United States. I once heard a very plain man say (and hewas cross-eyed, and awkwardly flung together in other respects) that he shouldbe a handsome man when public opinion shall be changed.Since I have been editing and publishing a journal devoted to the cause ofliberty and progress, I have had my mind more directed to the condition andcircumstances of the free colored people than when I was the agent of anabolition society. The result has been a corresponding change in the dispositionof my time and labors. I have felt it to be a part of my mission—under agracious Providence to impress my sable brothers in this country with theconviction that, notwithstanding the ten thousand discouragements and thepowerful hinderances, which beset their existence in thiscountry—notwithstanding the blood-written history of Africa, and her children,from whom we have descended, or the clouds and darkness (whose stillness andgloom are made only more awful by wrathful thunder and lightning) nowovershadowing them—progress is yet possible, and bright skies shall yet shineupon their pathway; and that “Ethiopia shall yet reach forth her hand unto God.”Believing that one of the best means of emancipating the slaves of the south isto improve and elevate the character of the free colored people of the north Ishall labor in the future, as I have labored in the past, to promote the moral,social, religious, and intellectual elevation of the free colored people; neverforgetting my own humble orgin(sic), nor refusing, while Heaven lends meability, to use my voice, my pen, or my vote, to advocate the great and primarywork of the universal and unconditional emancipation of my entire race.RECEPTION SPEECH 10[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-10].AT FINSBURY CHAPEL, MOORFIELDS, ENGLAND, MAY 12,1846Mr. Douglass rose amid loud cheers, and said: I feel exceedingly glad of theopportunity now afforded me of presenting the claims of my brethren in bonds inthe United States, to so many in London and from various parts of Britain, whohave assembled here on the present occasion. I have nothing to commend me toyour consideration in the way of learning, nothing in the way of education, toentitle me to your attention; and you are aware that slavery is a very badschool for rearing teachers of morality and religion. Twenty-one years of mylife have been spent in slavery—personal slavery—surrounded by degradinginfluences, such as can exist nowhere beyond the pale of slavery; and it willnot be strange, if under such circumstances, I should betray, in what I have tosay to you, a deficiency of that refinement which is seldom or ever found,except among persons that have experienced superior advantages to those which Ihave enjoyed. But I will take it for granted that you know something about thedegrading influences of slavery, and that you will not expect great things fromme this evening, but simply such facts as I may be able to advance immediatelyin connection with my own experience of slavery.Now, what is this system of slavery? This is the subject of my lecture thisevening—what is the character of this institution? I am about to answer theinquiry, what is American slavery? I do this the more readily, since I havefound persons in this country who have identified the term slavery with thatwhich I think it is not, and in some instances, I have feared, in so doing, haverather (unwittingly, I know) detracted much from the horror with which the termslavery is contemplated. It is common in this country to distinguish every badthing by the name of slavery. Intemperance is slavery; to be deprived of theright to vote is slavery, says one; to have to work hard is slavery, saysanother; and I do not know but that if we should let them go on, they would saythat to eat when we are hungry, to walk when we desire to have exercise, or tominister to our necessities, or have necessities at all, is slavery. I do notwish for a moment to detract from the horror with which the evil of intemperanceis contemplated—not at all; nor do I wish to throw the slightest obstruction inthe way of any political freedom that any class of persons in this country maydesire to obtain. But I am here to say that I think the term slavery issometimes abused by identifying it with that which it is not. Slavery in theUnited States is the granting of that power by which one man exercises andenforces a right of property in the body and soul of another. The condition of aslave is simply that of the brute beast. He is a piece of property—a marketablecommodity, in the language of the law, to be bought or sold at the will andcaprice of the master who claims him to be his property; he is spoken of,thought of, and treated as property. His own good, his conscience, hisintellect, his affections, are all set aside by the master. The will and thewishes of the master are the law of the slave. He is as much a piece of propertyas a horse. If he is fed, he is fed because he is property. If he is clothed, itis with a view to the increase of his value as property. Whatever of comfort isnecessary to him for his body or soul that is inconsistent with his beingproperty, is carefully wrested from him, not only by public opinion, but by thelaw of the country. He is carefully deprived of everything that tends in theslightest degree to detract from his value as property. He is deprived ofeducation. God has given him an intellect; the slaveholder declares it shall notbe cultivated. If his moral perception leads him in a course contrary to hisvalue as property, the slaveholder declares he shall not exercise it. Themarriage institution cannot exist among slaves, and one-sixth of the populationof democratic America is denied its privileges by the law of the land. What isto be thought of a nation boasting of its liberty, boasting of its humanity,boasting of its Christianity, boasting of its love of justice and purity, andyet having within its own borders three millions of persons denied by law theright of marriage?—what must be the condition of that people? I need not lift upthe veil by giving you any experience of my own. Every one that can put twoideas together, must see the most fearful results from such a state of things asI have just mentioned. If any of these three millions find for themselvescompanions, and prove themselves honest, upright, virtuous persons to eachother, yet in these cases—few as I am bound to confess they are—the virtuouslive in constant apprehension of being torn asunder by the mercilessmen-stealers that claim them as their property. This is American slavery; nomarriage—no education—the light of the gospel shut out from the dark mind of thebondman—and he forbidden by law to learn to read. If a mother shall teach herchildren to read, the law in Louisiana proclaims that she may be hanged by theneck. If the father attempt to give his son a knowledge of letters, he may bepunished by the whip in one instance, and in another be killed, at thediscretion of the court. Three millions of people shut out from the light ofknowledge! It is easy for you to conceive the evil that must result from such astate of things.I now come to the physical evils of slavery. I do not wish to dwell at lengthupon these, but it seems right to speak of them, not so much to influence yourminds on this question, as to let the slaveholders of America know that thecurtain which conceals their crimes is being lifted abroad; that we are openingthe dark cell, and leading the people into the horrible recesses of what theyare pleased to call their domestic institution. We want them to know that aknowledge of their whippings, their scourgings, their brandings, theirchainings, is not confined to their plantations, but that some Negro of theirshas broken loose from his chains—has burst through the dark incrustation ofslavery, and is now exposing their deeds of deep damnation to the gaze of thechristian people of England.The slaveholders resort to all kinds of cruelty. If I were disposed, I havematter enough to interest you on this question for five or six evenings, but Iwill not dwell at length upon these cruelties. Suffice it to say, that all ofthe peculiar modes of torture that were resorted to in the West India islands,are resorted to, I believe, even more frequently, in the United States ofAmerica. Starvation, the bloody whip, the chain, the gag, the thumb-screw,cat-hauling, the cat-o’-nine-tails, the dungeon, the blood-hound, are all inrequisition to keep the slave in his condition as a slave in the United States.If any one has a doubt upon this point, I would ask him to read the chapter onslavery in Dickens’s Notes on America. If any man has a doubt upon it, I havehere the “testimony of a thousand witnesses,” which I can give at any length,all going to prove the truth of my statement. The blood-hound is regularlytrained in the United States, and advertisements are to be found in the southernpapers of the Union, from persons advertising themselves as blood-houndtrainers, and offering to hunt down slaves at fifteen dollars a piece,recommending their hounds as the fleetest in the neighborhood, never known tofail. Advertisements are from time to time inserted, stating that slaves haveescaped with iron collars about their necks, with bands of iron about theirfeet, marked with the lash, branded with red-hot irons, the initials of theirmaster’s name burned into their flesh; and the masters advertise the fact oftheir being thus branded with their own signature, thereby proving to the world,that, however damning it may appear to non-slavers, such practices are notregarded discreditable among the slaveholders themselves. Why, I believe if aman should brand his horse in this country—burn the initials of his name intoany of his cattle, and publish the ferocious deed here—that the unitedexecrations of Christians in Britain would descend upon him. Yet in the UnitedStates, human beings are thus branded. As Whittier says— ... Our countrymen in chains, The whip on woman’s shrinking flesh, Our soil yet reddening with the stains Caught from her scourgings warm and fresh.The slave-dealer boldly publishes his infamous acts to the world. Of all thingsthat have been said of slavery to which exception has been taken byslaveholders, this, the charge of cruelty, stands foremost, and yet there is nocharge capable of clearer demonstration, than that of the most barbarousinhumanity on the part of the slaveholders toward their slaves. And all this isnecessary; it is necessary to resort to these cruelties, in order to make theslave a slave, and to keep him a slave. Why, my experience all goes to prove thetruth of what you will call a marvelous proposition, that the better you treat aslave, the more you destroy his value as a slave, and enhance the probability ofhis eluding the grasp of the slaveholder; the more kindly you treat him, themore wretched you make him, while you keep him in the condition of a slave. Myexperience, I say, confirms the truth of this proposition. When I was treatedexceedingly ill; when my back was being scourged daily; when I was whippedwithin an inch of my life—life was all I cared for. “Spare my life,” was mycontinual prayer. When I was looking for the blow about to be inflicted upon myhead, I was not thinking of my liberty; it was my life. But, as soon as the blowwas not to be feared, then came the longing for liberty. If a slave has a badmaster, his ambition is to get a better; when he gets a better, he aspires tohave the best; and when he gets the best, he aspires to be his own master. Butthe slave must be brutalized to keep him as a slave. The slaveholder feels thisnecessity. I admit this necessity. If it be right to hold slaves at all, it isright to hold them in the only way in which they can be held; and this can bedone only by shutting out the light of education from their minds, andbrutalizing their persons. The whip, the chain, the gag, the thumb-screw, theblood-hound, the stocks, and all the other bloody paraphernalia of the slavesystem, are indispensably necessary to the relation of master and slave. Theslave must be subjected to these, or he ceases to be a slave. Let him know thatthe whip is burned; that the fetters have been turned to some useful andprofitable employment; that the chain is no longer for his limbs; that theblood-hound is no longer to be put upon his track; that his master’s authorityover him is no longer to be enforced by taking his life—and immediately he walksout from the house of bondage and asserts his freedom as a man. The slaveholderfinds it necessary to have these implements to keep the slave in bondage; findsit necessary to be able to say, “Unless you do so and so; unless you do as I bidyou—I will take away your life!”Some of the most awful scenes of cruelty are constantly taking place in themiddle states of the Union. We have in those states what are called theslave-breeding states. Allow me to speak plainly. Although it is harrowing toyour feelings, it is necessary that the facts of the case should be stated. Wehave in the United States slave-breeding states. The very state from which theminister from our court to yours comes, is one of these states—Maryland, wheremen, women, and children are reared for the market, just as horses, sheep, andswine are raised for the market. Slave-rearing is there looked upon as alegitimate trade; the law sanctions it, public opinion upholds it, the churchdoes not condemn it. It goes on in all its bloody horrors, sustained by theauctioneer’s block. If you would see the cruelties of this system, hear thefollowing narrative. Not long since the following scene occurred. A slave-womanand a slaveman had united themselves as man and wife in the absence of any lawto protect them as man and wife. They had lived together by the permission, notby right, of their master, and they had reared a family. The master found itexpedient, and for his interest, to sell them. He did not ask them their wishesin regard to the matter at all; they were not consulted. The man and woman werebrought to the auctioneer’s block, under the sound of the hammer. The cry wasraised, “Here goes; who bids cash?” Think of it—a man and wife to be sold! Thewoman was placed on the auctioneer’s block; her limbs, as is customary, werebrutally exposed to the purchasers, who examined her with all the freedom withwhich they would examine a horse. There stood the husband, powerless; no rightto his wife; the master’s right preeminent. She was sold. He was next brought tothe auctioneer’s block. His eyes followed his wife in the distance; and helooked beseechingly, imploringly, to the man that had bought his wife, to buyhim also. But he was at length bid off to another person. He was about to beseparated forever from her he loved. No word of his, no work of his, could savehim from this separation. He asked permission of his new master to go and takethe hand of his wife at parting. It was denied him. In the agony of his soul herushed from the man who had just bought him, that he might take a farewell ofhis wife; but his way was obstructed, he was struck over the head with a loadedwhip, and was held for a moment; but his agony was too great. When he was letgo, he fell a corpse at the feet of his master. His heart was broken. Suchscenes are the everyday fruits of American slavery. Some two years since, theHon. Seth. M. Gates, an anti-slavery gentleman of the state of New York, arepresentative in the congress of the United States, told me he saw with his owneyes the following circumstances. In the national District of Columbia, overwhich the star-spangled emblem is constantly waving, where orators are everholding forth on the subject of American liberty, American democracy, Americanrepublicanism, there are two slave prisons. When going across a bridge, leadingto one of these prisons, he saw a young woman run out, bare-footed andbare-headed, and with very little clothing on. She was running with all speed tothe bridge he was approaching. His eye was fixed upon her, and he stopped to seewhat was the matter. He had not paused long before he saw three men run outafter her. He now knew what the nature of the case was; a slave escaping fromher chains—a young woman, a sister—escaping from the bondage in which she hadbeen held. She made her way to the bridge, but had not reached, ere from theVirginia side there came two slaveholders. As soon as they saw them, herpursuers called out, “Stop her!” True to their Virginian instincts, they came tothe rescue of their brother kidnappers, across the bridge. The poor girl now sawthat there was no chance for her. It was a trying time. She knew if she wentback, she must be a slave forever—she must be dragged down to the scenes ofpollution which the slaveholders continually provide for most of the poor,sinking, wretched young women, whom they call their property. She formed herresolution; and just as those who were about to take her, were going to puthands upon her, to drag her back, she leaped over the balustrades of the bridge,and down she went to rise no more. She chose death, rather than to go back intothe hands of those christian slaveholders from whom she had escaped.Can it be possible that such things as these exist in the United States? Are notthese the exceptions? Are any such scenes as this general? Are not such deedscondemned by the law and denounced by public opinion? Let me read to you a fewof the laws of the slaveholding states of America. I think no better exposure ofslavery can be made than is made by the laws of the states in which slaveryexists. I prefer reading the laws to making any statement in confirmation ofwhat I have said myself; for the slaveholders cannot object to this testimony,since it is the calm, the cool, the deliberate enactment of their wisest heads,of their most clear-sighted, their own constituted representatives. “If morethan seven slaves together are found in any road without a white person, twentylashes a piece; for visiting a plantation without a written pass, ten lashes;for letting loose a boat from where it is made fast, thirty-nine lashes for thefirst offense; and for the second, shall have cut off from his head one ear; forkeeping or carrying a club, thirty-nine lashes; for having any article for sale,without a ticket from his master, ten lashes; for traveling in any other thanthe most usual and accustomed road, when going alone to any place, forty lashes;for traveling in the night without a pass, forty lashes.” I am afraid you do notunderstand the awful character of these lashes. You must bring it before yourmind. A human being in a perfect state of nudity, tied hand and foot to a stake,and a strong man standing behind with a heavy whip, knotted at the end, eachblow cutting into the flesh, and leaving the warm blood dripping to the feet;and for these trifles. “For being found in another person’s negro-quarters,forty lashes; for hunting with dogs in the woods, thirty lashes; for being onhorseback without the written permission of his master, twenty-five lashes; forriding or going abroad in the night, or riding horses in the day time, withoutleave, a slave may be whipped, cropped, or branded in the cheek with the letterR. or otherwise punished, such punishment not extending to life, or so as torender him unfit for labor.” The laws referred to, may be found by consultingBrevard’s Digest; Haywood’s Manual; Virginia Revised Code; Prince’s Digest;Missouri Laws; Mississippi Revised Code. A man, for going to visit his brethren,without the permission of his master—and in many instances he may not have thatpermission; his master, from caprice or other reasons, may not be willing toallow it—may be caught on his way, dragged to a post, the branding-iron heated,and the name of his master or the letter R branded into his cheek or on hisforehead. They treat slaves thus, on the principle that they must punish forlight offenses, in order to prevent the commission of larger ones. I wish you tomark that in the single state of Virginia there are seventy-one crimes for whicha colored man may be executed; while there are only three of these crimes,which, when committed by a white man, will subject him to that punishment. Thereare many of these crimes which if the white man did not commit, he would beregarded as a scoundrel and a coward. In the state of Maryland, there is a lawto this effect: that if a slave shall strike his master, he may be hanged, hishead severed from his body, his body quartered, and his head and quarters set upin the most prominent places in the neighborhood. If a colored woman, in thedefense of her own virtue, in defense of her own person, should shield herselffrom the brutal attacks of her tyrannical master, or make the slightestresistance, she may be killed on the spot. No law whatever will bring the guiltyman to justice for the crime.But you will ask me, can these things be possible in a land professingChristianity? Yes, they are so; and this is not the worst. No; a darker featureis yet to be presented than the mere existence of these facts. I have to informyou that the religion of the southern states, at this time, is the greatsupporter, the great sanctioner of the bloody atrocities to which I havereferred. While America is printing tracts and bibles; sending missionariesabroad to convert the heathen; expending her money in various ways for thepromotion of the gospel in foreign lands—the slave not only lies forgotten,uncared for, but is trampled under foot by the very churches of the land. Whathave we in America? Why, we have slavery made part of the religion of the land.Yes, the pulpit there stands up as the great defender of this cursedinstitution, as it is called. Ministers of religion come forward and torture thehallowed pages of inspired wisdom to sanction the bloody deed. They stand forthas the foremost, the strongest defenders of this “institution.” As a proof ofthis, I need not do more than state the general fact, that slavery has existedunder the droppings of the sanctuary of the south for the last two hundredyears, and there has not been any war between the religion and the slavery ofthe south. Whips, chains, gags, and thumb-screws have all lain under thedroppings of the sanctuary, and instead of rusting from off the limbs of thebondman, those droppings have served to preserve them in all their strength.Instead of preaching the gospel against this tyranny, rebuke, and wrong,ministers of religion have sought, by all and every means, to throw in theback-ground whatever in the bible could be construed into opposition to slavery,and to bring forward that which they could torture into its support. This Iconceive to be the darkest feature of slavery, and the most difficult to attack,because it is identified with religion, and exposes those who denounce it to thecharge of infidelity. Yes, those with whom I have been laboring, namely, the oldorganization anti-slavery society of America, have been again and againstigmatized as infidels, and for what reason? Why, solely in consequence of thefaithfulness of their attacks upon the slaveholding religion of the southernstates, and the northern religion that sympathizes with it. I have found itdifficult to speak on this matter without persons coming forward and saying,“Douglass, are you not afraid of injuring the cause of Christ? You do not desireto do so, we know; but are you not undermining religion?” This has been said tome again and again, even since I came to this country, but I cannot be inducedto leave off these exposures. I love the religion of our blessed Savior. I lovethat religion that comes from above, in the “wisdom of God,” which is firstpure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated, full of mercy and goodfruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy. I love that religion thatsends its votaries to bind up the wounds of him that has fallen among thieves. Ilove that religion that makes it the duty of its disciples to visit the fatherless and the widow in their affliction. I love that religion that is based uponthe glorious principle, of love to God and love to man; which makes itsfollowers do unto others as they themselves would be done by. If you demandliberty to yourself, it says, grant it to your neighbors. If you claim a rightto think for yourself, it says, allow your neighbors the same right. If youclaim to act for yourself, it says, allow your neighbors the same right. It isbecause I love this religion that I hate the slaveholding, the woman-whipping,the mind-darkening, the soul-destroying religion that exists in the southernstates of America. It is because I regard the one as good, and pure, and holy,that I cannot but regard the other as bad, corrupt, and wicked. Loving the one Imust hate the other; holding to the one I must reject the other.I may be asked, why I am so anxious to bring this subject before the Britishpublic—why I do not confine my efforts to the United States? My answer is,first, that slavery is the common enemy of mankind, and all mankind should bemade acquainted with its abominable character. My next answer is, that the slaveis a man, and, as such, is entitled to your sympathy as a brother. All thefeelings, all the susceptibilities, all the capacities, which you have, he has.He is a part of the human family. He has been the prey—the common prey—ofChristendom for the last three hundred years, and it is but right, it is butjust, it is but proper, that his wrongs should be known throughout the world. Ihave another reason for bringing this matter before the British public, and itis this: slavery is a system of wrong, so blinding to all around, so hardeningto the heart, so corrupting to the morals, so deleterious to religion, sosapping to all the principles of justice in its immediate vicinity, that thecommunity surrounding it lack the moral stamina necessary to its removal. It isa system of such gigantic evil, so strong, so overwhelming in its power, that noone nation is equal to its removal. It requires the humanity of Christianity,the morality of the world to remove it. Hence, I call upon the people of Britainto look at this matter, and to exert the influence I am about to show theypossess, for the removal of slavery from America. I can appeal to them, asstrongly by their regard for the slaveholder as for the slave, to labor in thiscause. I am here, because you have an influence on America that no other nationcan have. You have been drawn together by the power of steam to a marvelousextent; the distance between London and Boston is now reduced to some twelve orfourteen days, so that the denunciations against slavery, uttered in London thisweek, may be heard in a fortnight in the streets of Boston, and reverberatingamidst the hills of Massachusetts. There is nothing said here against slaverythat will not be recorded in the United States. I am here, also, because theslaveholders do not want me to be here; they would rather that I were not here.I have adopted a maxim laid down by Napoleon, never to occupy ground which theenemy would like me to occupy. The slaveholders would much rather have me, if Iwill denounce slavery, denounce it in the northern states, where their friendsand supporters are, who will stand by and mob me for denouncing it. They feelsomething as the man felt, when he uttered his prayer, in which he made out amost horrible case for himself, and one of his neighbors touched him and said,“My friend, I always had the opinion of you that you have now expressed foryourself—that you are a very great sinner.” Coming from himself, it was all verywell, but coming from a stranger it was rather cutting. The slaveholders feltthat when slavery was denounced among themselves, it was not so bad; but let oneof the slaves get loose, let him summon the people of Britain, and make known tothem the conduct of the slaveholders toward their slaves, and it cuts them tothe quick, and produces a sensation such as would be produced by nothing else.The power I exert now is something like the power that is exerted by the man atthe end of the lever; my influence now is just in proportion to the distancethat I am from the United States. My exposure of slavery abroad will tell moreupon the hearts and consciences of slaveholders, than if I was attacking them inAmerica; for almost every paper that I now receive from the United States, comesteeming with statements about this fugitive Negro, calling him a “glib-tonguedscoundrel,” and saying that he is running out against the institutions andpeople of America. I deny the charge that I am saying a word against theinstitutions of America, or the people, as such. What I have to say is againstslavery and slaveholders. I feel at liberty to speak on this subject. I have onmy back the marks of the lash; I have four sisters and one brother now under thegalling chain. I feel it my duty to cry aloud and spare not. I am not averse tohaving the good opinion of my fellow creatures. I am not averse to being kindlyregarded by all men; but I am bound, even at the hazard of making a large classof religionists in this country hate me, oppose me, and malign me as they havedone—I am bound by the prayers, and tears, and entreaties of three millions ofkneeling bondsmen, to have no compromise with men who are in any shape or formconnected with the slaveholders of America. I expose slavery in this country,because to expose it is to kill it. Slavery is one of those monsters of darknessto whom the light of truth is death. Expose slavery, and it dies. Light is toslavery what the heat of the sun is to the root of a tree; it must die under it.All the slaveholder asks of me is silence. He does not ask me to go abroad andpreach in favor of slavery; he does not ask any one to do that. He would not saythat slavery is a good thing, but the best under the circumstances. Theslaveholders want total darkness on the subject. They want the hatchway shutdown, that the monster may crawl in his den of darkness, crushing human hopesand happiness, destroying the bondman at will, and having no one to reprove orrebuke him. Slavery shrinks from the light; it hateth the light, neither comethto the light, lest its deeds should be reproved. To tear off the mask from thisabominable system, to expose it to the light of heaven, aye, to the heat of thesun, that it may burn and wither it out of existence, is my object in coming tothis country. I want the slaveholder surrounded, as by a wall of anti-slaveryfire, so that he may see the condemnation of himself and his system glaring downin letters of light. I want him to feel that he has no sympathy in England,Scotland, or Ireland; that he has none in Canada, none in Mexico, none among thepoor wild Indians; that the voice of the civilized, aye, and savage world isagainst him. I would have condemnation blaze down upon him in every direction,till, stunned and overwhelmed with shame and confusion, he is compelled to letgo the grasp he holds upon the persons of his victims, and restore them to theirlong-lost rights."},{"pageContent":"DR. CAMPBELL’S REPLYFrom Rev. Dr. Campbell’s brilliant reply we extract the following: FREDERICKDOUGLASS, “the beast of burden,” the portion of “goods and chattels,” therepresentative of three millions of men, has been raised up! Shall I say theman? If there is a man on earth, he is a man. My blood boiled within me when Iheard his address tonight, and thought that he had left behind him threemillions of such men.We must see more of this man; we must have more of this man. One would havetaken a voyage round the globe some forty years back—especially since theintroduction of steam—to have heard such an exposure of slavery from the lips ofa slave. It will be an era in the individual history of the present assembly.Our children—our boys and girls—I have tonight seen the delightful sympathy oftheir hearts evinced by their heaving breasts, while their eyes sparkled withwonder and admiration, that this black man—this slave—had so much logic, so muchwit, so much fancy, so much eloquence. He was something more than a man,according to their little notions. Then, I say, we must hear him again. We havegot a purpose to accomplish. He has appealed to the pulpit of England. TheEnglish pulpit is with him. He has appealed to the press of England; the pressof England is conducted by English hearts, and that press will do him justice.About ten days hence, and his second master, who may well prize “such a piece ofgoods,” will have the pleasure of reading his burning words, and his firstmaster will bless himself that he has got quit of him. We have to create publicopinion, or rather, not to create it, for it is created already; but we have tofoster it; and when tonight I heard those magnificent words—the words of Curran,by which my heart, from boyhood, has ofttimes been deeply moved—I rejoice tothink that they embody an instinct of an Englishman’s nature. I heard, withinexpressible delight, how they told on this mighty mass of the citizens of themetropolis.Britain has now no slaves; we can therefore talk to the other nations now, as wecould not have talked a dozen years ago. I want the whole of the London ministryto meet Douglass. For as his appeal is to England, and throughout England, Ishould rejoice in the idea of churchmen and dissenters merging all sectionaldistinctions in this cause. Let us have a public breakfast. Let the ministersmeet him; let them hear him; let them grasp his hand; and let him enlist theirsympathies on behalf of the slave. Let him inspire them with abhorrence of theman-stealer—the slaveholder. No slaveholding American shall ever my cross mydoor. No slaveholding or slavery-supporting minister shall ever pollute mypulpit. While I have a tongue to speak, or a hand to write, I will, to theutmost of my power, oppose these slaveholding men. We must have Douglass amongstus to aid in fostering public opinion.The great conflict with slavery must now take place in America; and while theyare adding other slave states to the Union, our business is to step forward andhelp the abolitionists there. It is a pleasing circumstance that such a body ofmen has risen in America, and whilst we hurl our thunders against her slavers,let us make a distinction between those who advocate slavery and those whooppose it. George Thompson has been there. This man, Frederick Douglass, hasbeen there, and has been compelled to flee. I wish, when he first set foot onour shores, he had made a solemn vow, and said, “Now that I am free, and in thesanctuary of freedom, I will never return till I have seen the emancipation ofmy country completed.” He wants to surround these men, the slaveholders, as by awall of fire; and he himself may do much toward kindling it. Let him travel overthe island—east, west, north, and south—everywhere diffusing knowledge andawakening principle, till the whole nation become a body of petitioners toAmerica. He will, he must, do it. He must for a season make England his home. Hemust send for his wife. He must send for his children. I want to see the sonsand daughters of such a sire. We, too, must do something for him and them worthyof the English name. I do not like the idea of a man of such mental dimensions,such moral courage, and all but incomparable talent, having his own small wants,and the wants of a distant wife and children, supplied by the poor profits ofhis publication, the sketch of his life. Let the pamphlet be bought by tens ofthousands. But we will do something more for him, shall we not?It only remains that we pass a resolution of thanks to Frederick Douglass, theslave that was, the man that is! He that was covered with chains, and that isnow being covered with glory, and whom we will send back a gentleman.LETTER TO HIS OLD MASTER. 11[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-14.htm.html#linknote-11].TO MY OLD MASTER, THOMAS AULDSIR—The long and intimate, though by no means friendly, relation which unhappilysubsisted between you and myself, leads me to hope that you will easily accountfor the great liberty which I now take in addressing you in this open and publicmanner. The same fact may remove any disagreeable surprise which you mayexperience on again finding your name coupled with mine, in any other way thanin an advertisement, accurately describing my person, and offering a large sumfor my arrest. In thus dragging you again before the public, I am aware that Ishall subject myself to no inconsiderable amount of censure. I shall probably becharged with an unwarrantable, if not a wanton and reckless disregard of therights and properties of private life. There are those north as well as southwho entertain a much higher respect for rights which are merely conventional,than they do for rights which are personal and essential. Not a few there are inour country, who, while they have no scruples against robbing the laborer of thehard earned results of his patient industry, will be shocked by the extremelyindelicate manner of bringing your name before the public. Believing this to bethe case, and wishing to meet every reasonable or plausible objection to myconduct, I will frankly state the ground upon which I justfy(sic) myself in thisinstance, as well as on former occasions when I have thought proper to mentionyour name in public. All will agree that a man guilty of theft, robbery, ormurder, has forfeited the right to concealment and private life; that thecommunity have a right to subject such persons to the most complete exposure.However much they may desire retirement, and aim to conceal themselves and theirmovements from the popular gaze, the public have a right to ferret them out, andbring their conduct before the proper tribunals of the country forinvestigation. Sir, you will undoubtedly make the proper application of thesegenerally admitted principles, and will easily see the light in which you areregarded by me; I will not therefore manifest ill temper, by calling you hardnames. I know you to be a man of some intelligence, and can readily determinethe precise estimate which I entertain of your character. I may thereforeindulge in language which may seem to others indirect and ambiguous, and yet bequite well understood by yourself.I have selected this day on which to address you, because it is the anniversaryof my emancipation; and knowing no better way, I am led to this as the best modeof celebrating that truly important events. Just ten years ago this beautifulSeptember morning, yon bright sun beheld me a slave—a poor degradedchattel—trembling at the sound of your voice, lamenting that I was a man, andwishing myself a brute. The hopes which I had treasured up for weeks of a safeand successful escape from your grasp, were powerfully confronted at this lasthour by dark clouds of doubt and fear, making my person shake and my bosom toheave with the heavy contest between hope and fear. I have no words to describeto you the deep agony of soul which I experienced on that never-to-be-forgottenmorning—for I left by daylight. I was making a leap in the dark. Theprobabilities, so far as I could by reason determine them, were stoutly againstthe undertaking. The preliminaries and precautions I had adopted previously, allworked badly. I was like one going to war without weapons—ten chances of defeatto one of victory. One in whom I had confided, and one who had promised meassistance, appalled by fear at the trial hour, deserted me, thus leaving theresponsibility of success or failure solely with myself. You, sir, can neverknow my feelings. As I look back to them, I can scarcely realize that I havepassed through a scene so trying. Trying, however, as they were, and gloomy aswas the prospect, thanks be to the Most High, who is ever the God of theoppressed, at the moment which was to determine my whole earthly career, Hisgrace was sufficient; my mind was made up. I embraced the golden opportunity,took the morning tide at the flood, and a free man, young, active, and strong,is the result.I have often thought I should like to explain to you the grounds upon which Ihave justified myself in running away from you. I am almost ashamed to do sonow, for by this time you may have discovered them yourself. I will, however,glance at them. When yet but a child about six years old, I imbibed thedetermination to run away. The very first mental effort that I now remember onmy part, was an attempt to solve the mystery—why am I a slave? and with thisquestion my youthful mind was troubled for many days, pressing upon me moreheavily at times than others. When I saw the slave-driver whip a slave-woman,cut the blood out of her neck, and heard her piteous cries, I went away into thecorner of the fence, wept and pondered over the mystery. I had, through somemedium, I know not what, got some idea of God, the Creator of all mankind, theblack and the white, and that he had made the blacks to serve the whites asslaves. How he could do this and be good, I could not tell. I was not satisfiedwith this theory, which made God responsible for slavery, for it pained megreatly, and I have wept over it long and often. At one time, your first wife,Mrs. Lucretia, heard me sighing and saw me shedding tears, and asked of me thematter, but I was afraid to tell her. I was puzzled with this question, till onenight while sitting in the kitchen, I heard some of the old slaves talking oftheir parents having been stolen from Africa by white men, and were sold here asslaves. The whole mystery was solved at once. Very soon after this, my AuntJinny and Uncle Noah ran away, and the great noise made about it by yourfather-in-law, made me for the first time acquainted with the fact, that therewere free states as well as slave states. From that time, I resolved that Iwould some day run away. The morality of the act I dispose of as follows: I ammyself; you are yourself; we are two distinct persons, equal persons. What youare, I am. You are a man, and so am I. God created both, and made us separatebeings. I am not by nature bond to you, or you to me. Nature does not make yourexistence depend upon me, or mine to depend upon yours. I cannot walk upon yourlegs, or you upon mine. I cannot breathe for you, or you for me; I must breathefor myself, and you for yourself. We are distinct persons, and are each equallyprovided with faculties necessary to our individual existence. In leaving you, Itook nothing but what belonged to me, and in no way lessened your means forobtaining an honest living. Your faculties remained yours, and mine becameuseful to their rightful owner. I therefore see no wrong in any part of thetransaction. It is true, I went off secretly; but that was more your fault thanmine. Had I let you into the secret, you would have defeated the enterpriseentirely; but for this, I should have been really glad to have made youacquainted with my intentions to leave.You may perhaps want to know how I like my present condition. I am free to say,I greatly prefer it to that which I occupied in Maryland. I am, however, by nomeans prejudiced against the state as such. Its geography, climate, fertility,and products, are such as to make it a very desirable abode for any man; and butfor the existence of slavery there, it is not impossible that I might again takeup my abode in that state. It is not that I love Maryland less, but freedommore. You will be surprised to learn that people at the north labor under thestrange delusion that if the slaves were emancipated at the south, they wouldflock to the north. So far from this being the case, in that event, you wouldsee many old and familiar faces back again to the south. The fact is, there arefew here who would not return to the south in the event of emancipation. We wantto live in the land of our birth, and to lay our bones by the side of ourfathers; and nothing short of an intense love of personal freedom keeps us fromthe south. For the sake of this, most of us would live on a crust of bread and acup of cold water.Since I left you, I have had a rich experience. I have occupied stations which Inever dreamed of when a slave. Three out of the ten years since I left you, Ispent as a common laborer on the wharves of New Bedford, Massachusetts. It wasthere I earned my first free dollar. It was mine. I could spend it as I pleased.I could buy hams or herring with it, without asking any odds of anybody. Thatwas a precious dollar to me. You remember when I used to make seven, or eight,or even nine dollars a week in Baltimore, you would take every cent of it fromme every Saturday night, saying that I belonged to you, and my earnings also. Inever liked this conduct on your part—to say the best, I thought it a littlemean. I would not have served you so. But let that pass. I was a little awkwardabout counting money in New England fashion when I first landed in New Bedford.I came near betraying myself several times. I caught myself saying phip, forfourpence; and at one time a man actually charged me with being a runaway,whereupon I was silly enough to become one by running away from him, for I wasgreatly afraid he might adopt measures to get me again into slavery, a conditionI then dreaded more than death.I soon learned, however, to count money, as well as to make it, and got onswimmingly. I married soon after leaving you; in fact, I was engaged to bemarried before I left you; and instead of finding my companion a burden, she wastruly a helpmate. She went to live at service, and I to work on the wharf, andthough we toiled hard the first winter, we never lived more happily. Afterremaining in New Bedford for three years, I met with William Lloyd Garrison, aperson of whom you have possibly heard, as he is pretty generally known amongslaveholders. He put it into my head that I might make myself serviceable to thecause of the slave, by devoting a portion of my time to telling my own sorrows,and those of other slaves, which had come under my observation. This was thecommencement of a higher state of existence than any to which I had everaspired. I was thrown into society the most pure, enlightened, and benevolent,that the country affords. Among these I have never forgotten you, but haveinvariably made you the topic of conversation—thus giving you all the notorietyI could do. I need not tell you that the opinion formed of you in these circlesis far from being favorable. They have little respect for your honesty, and lessfor your religion.But I was going on to relate to you something of my interesting experience. Ihad not long enjoyed the excellent society to which I have referred, before thelight of its excellence exerted a beneficial influence on my mind and heart.Much of my early dislike of white persons was removed, and their manners,habits, and customs, so entirely unlike what I had been used to in thekitchen-quarters on the plantations of the south, fairly charmed me, and gave mea strong disrelish for the coarse and degrading customs of my former condition.I therefore made an effort so to improve my mind and deportment, as to besomewhat fitted to the station to which I seemed almost providentially called.The transition from degradation to respectability was indeed great, and to getfrom one to the other without carrying some marks of one’s former condition, istruly a difficult matter. I would not have you think that I am now entirelyclear of all plantation peculiarities, but my friends here, while they entertainthe strongest dislike to them, regard me with that charity to which my past lifesomewhat entitles me, so that my condition in this respect is exceedinglypleasant. So far as my domestic affairs are concerned, I can boast of ascomfortable a dwelling as your own. I have an industrious and neat companion,and four dear children—the oldest a girl of nine years, and three fine boys, theoldest eight, the next six, and the youngest four years old. The three oldestare now going regularly to school—two can read and write, and the other canspell, with tolerable correctness, words of two syllables. Dear fellows! theyare all in comfortable beds, and are sound asleep, perfectly secure under my ownroof. There are no slaveholders here to rend my heart by snatching them from myarms, or blast a mother’s dearest hopes by tearing them from her bosom. Thesedear children are ours—not to work up into rice, sugar, and tobacco, but towatch over, regard, and protect, and to rear them up in the nurture andadmonition of the gospel—to train them up in the paths of wisdom and virtue,and, as far as we can, to make them useful to the world and to themselves. Oh!sir, a slaveholder never appears to me so completely an agent of hell, as when Ithink of and look upon my dear children. It is then that my feelings rise abovemy control. I meant to have said more with respect to my own prosperity andhappiness, but thoughts and feel ings which this recital has quickened, unfit meto proceed further in that direction. The grim horrors of slavery rise in alltheir ghastly terror before me; the wails of millions pierce my heart and chillmy blood. I remember the chain, the gag, the bloody whip; the death-like gloomovershadowing the broken spirit of the fettered bondman; the appalling liabilityof his being torn away from wife and children, and sold like a beast in themarket. Say not that this is a picture of fancy. You well know that I wearstripes on my back, inflicted by your direction; and that you, while we werebrothers in the same church, caused this right hand, with which I am now penningthis letter, to be closely tied to my left, and my person dragged, at thepistol’s mouth, fifteen miles, from the Bay Side to Easton, to be sold like abeast in the market, for the alleged crime of intending to escape from yourpossession. All this, and more, you remember, and know to be perfectly true, notonly of yourself, but of nearly all of the slaveholders around you.At this moment, you are probably the guilty holder of at least three of my owndear sisters, and my only brother, in bondage. These you regard as yourproperty. They are recorded on your ledger, or perhaps have been sold to humanflesh-mongers, with a view to filling our own ever-hungry purse. Sir, I desireto know how and where these dear sisters are. Have you sold them? or are theystill in your possession? What has become of them? are they living or dead? Andmy dear old grandmother, whom you turned out like an old horse to die in thewoods—is she still alive? Write and let me know all about them. If mygrandmother be still alive, she is of no service to you, for by this time shemust be nearly eighty years old—too old to be cared for by one to whom she hasceased to be of service; send her to me at Rochester, or bring her toPhiladelphia, and it shall be the crowning happiness of my life to take care ofher in her old age. Oh! she was to me a mother and a father, so far as hard toilfor my comfort could make her such. Send me my grandmother! that I may watchover and take care of her in her old age. And my sisters—let me know all aboutthem. I would write to them, and learn all I want to know of them, withoutdisturbing you in any way, but that, through your unrighteous conduct, they havebeen entirely deprived of the power to read and write. You have kept them inutter ignorance, and have therefore robbed them of the sweet enjoyments ofwriting or receiving letters from absent friends and relatives. Your wickednessand cruelty, committed in this respect on your fellow-creatures, are greaterthan all the stripes you have laid upon my back or theirs. It is an outrage uponthe soul, a war upon the immortal spirit, and one for which you must giveaccount at the bar of our common Father and Creator.The responsibility which you have assumed in this regard is truly awful, and howyou could stagger under it these many years is marvelous. Your mind must havebecome darkened, your heart hardened, your conscience seared and petrified, oryou would have long since thrown off the accursed load, and sought relief at thehands of a sin-forgiving God. How, let me ask, would you look upon me, were I,some dark night, in company with a band of hardened villains, to enter theprecincts of your elegant dwelling, and seize the person of your own lovelydaughter, Amanda, and carry her off from your family, friends, and all the lovedones of her youth—make her my slave—compel her to work, and I take herwages—place her name on my ledger as property—disregard her personalrights—fetter the powers of her immortal soul by denying her the right andprivilege of learning to read and write—feed her coarsely—clothe her scantily,and whip her on the naked back occasionally; more, and still more horrible,leave her unprotected—a degraded victim to the brutal lust of fiendishoverseers, who would pollute, blight, and blast her fair soul—rob her of alldignity—destroy her virtue, and annihilate in her person all the graces thatadorn the character of virtuous womanhood? I ask, how would you regard me, ifsuch were my conduct? Oh! the vocabulary of the damned would not afford a wordsufficiently infernal to express your idea of my God-provoking wickedness. Yet,sir, your treatment of my beloved sisters is in all essential points preciselylike the case I have now supposed. Damning as would be such a deed on my part,it would be no more so than that which you have committed against me and mysisters.I will now bring this letter to a close; you shall hear from me again unless youlet me hear from you. I intend to make use of you as a weapon with which toassail the system of slavery—as a means of concentrating public attention on thesystem, and deepening the horror of trafficking in the souls and bodies of men.I shall make use of you as a means of exposing the character of the Americanchurch and clergy—and as a means of bringing this guilty nation, with yourself,to repentance. In doing this, I entertain no malice toward you personally. Thereis no roof under which you would be more safe than mine, and there is nothing inmy house which you might need for your comfort, which I would not readily grant.Indeed, I should esteem it a privilege to set you an example as to how mankindought to treat each other. I am your fellow-man, but not your slave.THE NATURE OF SLAVERY. EXTRACT FROM A LECTURE ON SLAVERY, AT ROCHESTER,December 1, 1850More than twenty years of my life were consumed in a state of slavery. Mychildhood was environed by the baneful peculiarities of the slave system. I grewup to manhood in the presence of this hydra headed monster—not as a master—notas an idle spectator—not as the guest of the slaveholder—but as A SLAVE, eatingthe bread and drinking the cup of slavery with the most degraded of mybrother-bondmen, and sharing with them all the painful conditions of theirwretched lot. In consideration of these facts, I feel that I have a right tospeak, and to speak strongly. Yet, my friends, I feel bound to speak truly.Goading as have been the cruelties to which I have been subjected—bitter as havebeen the trials through which I have passed—exasperating as have been, and stillare, the indignities offered to my manhood—I find in them no excuse for theslightest departure from truth in dealing with any branch of this subject.First of all, I will state, as well as I can, the legal and social relation ofmaster and slave. A master is one—to speak in the vocabulary of the southernstates—who claims and exercises a right of property in the person of afellow-man. This he does with the force of the law and the sanction of southernreligion. The law gives the master absolute power over the slave. He may workhim, flog him, hire him out, sell him, and, in certain contingencies, kill him,with perfect impunity. The slave is a human being, divested of allrights—reduced to the level of a brute—a mere “chattel” in the eye of thelaw—placed beyond the circle of human brotherhood—cut off from his kind—hisname, which the “recording angel” may have enrolled in heaven, among the blest,is impiously inserted in a master’s ledger, with horses, sheep, and swine. Inlaw, the slave has no wife, no children, no country, and no home. He can ownnothing, possess nothing, acquire nothing, but what must belong to another. Toeat the fruit of his own toil, to clothe his person with the work of his ownhands, is considered stealing. He toils that another may reap the fruit; he isindustrious that another may live in idleness; he eats unbolted meal thatanother may eat the bread of fine flour; he labors in chains at home, under aburning sun and biting lash, that another may ride in ease and splendor abroad;he lives in ignorance that another may be educated; he is abused that anothermay be exalted; he rests his toil-worn limbs on the cold, damp ground thatanother may repose on the softest pillow; he is clad in coarse and tatteredraiment that another may be arrayed in purple and fine linen; he is shelteredonly by the wretched hovel that a master may dwell in a magnificent mansion; andto this condition he is bound down as by an arm of iron.From this monstrous relation there springs an unceasing stream of most revoltingcruelties. The very accompaniments of the slave system stamp it as the offspringof hell itself. To ensure good behavior, the slaveholder relies on the whip; toinduce proper humility, he relies on the whip; to rebuke what he is pleased toterm insolence, he relies on the whip; to supply the place of wages as anincentive to toil, he relies on the whip; to bind down the spirit of the slave,to imbrute and destroy his manhood, he relies on the whip, the chain, the gag,the thumb-screw, the pillory, the bowie knife the pistol, and the blood-hound.These are the necessary and unvarying accompaniments of the system. Whereverslavery is found, these horrid instruments are also found. Whether on the coastof Africa, among the savage tribes, or in South Carolina, among the refined andcivilized, slavery is the same, and its accompaniments one and the same. Itmakes no difference whether the slaveholder worships the God of the Christians,or is a follower of Mahomet, he is the minister of the same cruelty, and theauthor of the same misery. Slavery is always slavery; always the same foul,haggard, and damning scourge, whether found in the eastern or in the westernhemisphere.There is a still deeper shade to be given to this picture. The physicalcruelties are indeed sufficiently harassing and revolting; but they are as a fewgrains of sand on the sea shore, or a few drops of water in the great ocean,compared with the stupendous wrongs which it inflicts upon the mental, moral,and religious nature of its hapless victims. It is only when we contemplate theslave as a moral and intellectual being, that we can adequately comprehend theunparalleled enormity of slavery, and the intense criminality of theslaveholder. I have said that the slave was a man. “What a piece of work is man!How noble in reason! How infinite in faculties! In form and moving how expressand admirable! In action how like an angel! In apprehension how like a God! Thebeauty of the world! The paragon of animals!”The slave is a man, “the image of God,” but “a little lower than the angels;”possessing a soul, eternal and indestructible; capable of endless happiness, orimmeasurable woe; a creature of hopes and fears, of affections and passions, ofjoys and sorrows, and he is endowed with those mysterious powers by which mansoars above the things of time and sense, and grasps, with undying tenacity, theelevating and sublimely glorious idea of a God. It is such a being that issmitten and blasted. The first work of slavery is to mar and deface thosecharacteristics of its victims which distinguish men from things, and personsfrom property. Its first aim is to destroy all sense of high moral and religiousresponsibility. It reduces man to a mere machine. It cuts him off from hisMaker, it hides from him the laws of God, and leaves him to grope his way fromtime to eternity in the dark, under the arbitrary and despotic control of afrail, depraved, and sinful fellow-man. As the serpent-charmer of India iscompelled to extract the deadly teeth of his venomous prey before he is able tohandle him with impunity, so the slaveholder must strike down the conscience ofthe slave before he can obtain the entire mastery over his victim.It is, then, the first business of the enslaver of men to blunt, deaden, anddestroy the central principle of human responsibility. Conscience is, to theindividual soul, and to society, what the law of gravitation is to the universe.It holds society together; it is the basis of all trust and confidence; it isthe pillar of all moral rectitude. Without it, suspicion would take the place oftrust; vice would be more than a match for virtue; men would prey upon eachother, like the wild beasts of the desert; and earth would become a hell.Nor is slavery more adverse to the conscience than it is to the mind. This isshown by the fact, that in every state of the American Union, where slaveryexists, except the state of Kentucky, there are laws absolutely prohibitory ofeducation among the slaves. The crime of teaching a slave to read is punishablewith severe fines and imprisonment, and, in some instances, with death itself.Nor are the laws respecting this matter a dead letter. Cases may occur in whichthey are disregarded, and a few instances may be found where slaves may havelearned to read; but such are isolated cases, and only prove the rule. The greatmass of slaveholders look upon education among the slaves as utterly subversiveof the slave system. I well remember when my mistress first announced to mymaster that she had dis covered that I could read. His face colored at once withsurprise and chagrin. He said that “I was ruined, and my value as a slavedestroyed; that a slave should know nothing but to obey his master; that to givea negro an inch would lead him to take an ell; that having learned how to read,I would soon want to know how to write; and that by-and-by I would be runningaway.” I think my audience will bear witness to the correctness of thisphilosophy, and to the literal fulfillment of this prophecy.It is perfectly well understood at the south, that to educate a slave is to makehim discontened(sic) with slavery, and to invest him with a power which shallopen to him the treasures of freedom; and since the object of the slaveholder isto maintain complete authority over his slave, his constant vigilance isexercised to prevent everything which militates against, or endangers, thestability of his authority. Education being among the menacing influences, and,perhaps, the most dangerous, is, therefore, the most cautiously guarded against.It is true that we do not often hear of the enforcement of the law, punishing asa crime the teaching of slaves to read, but this is not because of a want ofdisposition to enforce it. The true reason or explanation of the matter is this:there is the greatest unanimity of opinion among the white population in thesouth in favor of the policy of keeping the slave in ignorance. There is,perhaps, another reason why the law against education is so seldom violated. Theslave is too poor to be able to offer a temptation sufficiently strong to inducea white man to violate it; and it is not to be supposed that in a communitywhere the moral and religious sentiment is in favor of slavery, many martyrswill be found sacrificing their liberty and lives by violating those prohibitoryenactments.As a general rule, then, darkness reigns over the abodes of the enslaved, and“how great is that darkness!”We are sometimes told of the contentment of the slaves, and are entertained withvivid pictures of their happiness. We are told that they often dance and sing;that their masters frequently give them wherewith to make merry; in fine, thatthey have little of which to complain. I admit that the slave does sometimessing, dance, and appear to be merry. But what does this prove? It only proves tomy mind, that though slavery is armed with a thousand stings, it is not ableentirely to kill the elastic spirit of the bondman. That spirit will rise andwalk abroad, despite of whips and chains, and extract from the cup of natureoccasional drops of joy and gladness. No thanks to the slaveholder, nor toslavery, that the vivacious captive may sometimes dance in his chains; his verymirth in such circumstances stands before God as an accusing angel against hisenslaver.It is often said, by the opponents of the anti-slavery cause, that the conditionof the people of Ireland is more deplorable than that of the American slaves.Far be it from me to underrate the sufferings of the Irish people. They havebeen long oppressed; and the same heart that prompts me to plead the cause ofthe American bondman, makes it impossible for me not to sympathize with theoppressed of all lands. Yet I must say that there is no analogy between the twocases. The Irishman is poor, but he is not a slave. He may be in rags, but he isnot a slave. He is still the master of his own body, and can say with the poet,“The hand of Douglass is his own.” “The world is all before him, where tochoose;” and poor as may be my opinion of the British parliament, I cannotbelieve that it will ever sink to such a depth of infamy as to pass a law forthe recapture of fugitive Irishmen! The shame and scandal of kidnapping willlong remain wholly monopolized by the American congress. The Irishman has notonly the liberty to emigrate from his country, but he has liberty at home. Hecan write, and speak, and cooperate for the attainment of his rights and theredress of his wrongs.The multitude can assemble upon all the green hills and fertile plains of theEmerald Isle; they can pour out their grievances, and proclaim their wantswithout molestation; and the press, that “swift-winged messenger,” can bear thetidings of their doings to the extreme bounds of the civilized world. They havetheir “Conciliation Hall,” on the banks of the Liffey, their reform clubs, andtheir newspapers; they pass resolutions, send forth addresses, and enjoy theright of petition. But how is it with the American slave? Where may he assemble?Where is his Conciliation Hall? Where are his newspapers? Where is his right ofpetition? Where is his freedom of speech? his liberty of the press? and hisright of locomotion? He is said to be happy; happy men can speak. But ask theslave what is his condition—what his state of mind—what he thinks ofenslavement? and you had as well address your inquiries to the silent dead.There comes no voice from the enslaved. We are left to gather his feelings byimagining what ours would be, were our souls in his soul’s stead.If there were no other fact descriptive of slavery, than that the slave is dumb,this alone would be sufficient to mark the slave system as a grand aggregationof human horrors.Most who are present, will have observed that leading men in this country havebeen putting forth their skill to secure quiet to the nation. A system ofmeasures to promote this object was adopted a few months ago in congress. Theresult of those measures is known. Instead of quiet, they have produced alarm;instead of peace, they have brought us war; and so it must ever be.While this nation is guilty of the enslavement of three millions of innocent menand women, it is as idle to think of having a sound and lasting peace, as it isto think there is no God to take cognizance of the affairs of men. There can beno peace to the wicked while slavery continues in the land. It will becondemned; and while it is condemned there will be agitation. Nature must ceaseto be nature; men must become monsters; humanity must be transformed;Christianity must be exterminated; all ideas of justice and the laws of eternalgoodness must be utterly blotted out from the human soul—ere a system so fouland infernal can escape condemnation, or this guilty republic can have a sound,enduring peace.INHUMANITY OF SLAVERY. EXTRACT FROM A LECTURE ON SLAVERY, AT ROCHESTER,December 8, 1850The relation of master and slave has been called patriarchal, and only second inbenignity and tenderness to that of the parent and child. This representation isdoubtless believed by many northern people; and this may account, in part, forthe lack of interest which we find among persons whom we are bound to believe tobe honest and humane. What, then, are the facts? Here I will not quote my ownexperience in slavery; for this you might call one-sided testimony. I will notcite the declarations of abolitionists; for these you might pronounceexaggerations. I will not rely upon advertisements cut from newspapers; forthese you might call isolated cases. But I will refer you to the laws adopted bythe legislatures of the slave states. I give you such evidence, because itcannot be invalidated nor denied. I hold in my hand sundry extracts from theslave codes of our country, from which I will quote. * * *Now, if the foregoing be an indication of kindness, what is cruelty? If this beparental affection, what is bitter malignity? A more atrocious and blood-thirstystring of laws could not well be conceived of. And yet I am bound to say thatthey fall short of indicating the horrible cruelties constantly practiced in theslave states.I admit that there are individual slaveholders less cruel and barbarous than isallowed by law; but these form the exception. The majority of slaveholders findit necessary, to insure obedience, at times, to avail themselves of the utmostextent of the law, and many go beyond it. If kindness were the rule, we shouldnot see advertisements filling the columns of almost every southern newspaper,offering large rewards for fugitive slaves, and describing them as being brandedwith irons, loaded with chains, and scarred by the whip. One of the most tellingtestimonies against the pretended kindness of slaveholders, is the fact thatuncounted numbers of fugitives are now inhabiting the Dismal Swamp, preferringthe untamed wilderness to their cultivated homes—choosing rather to encounterhunger and thirst, and to roam with the wild beasts of the forest, running thehazard of being hunted and shot down, than to submit to the authority of kindmasters.I tell you, my friends, humanity is never driven to such an unnatural course oflife, without great wrong. The slave finds more of the milk of human kindness inthe bosom of the savage Indian, than in the heart of his Christian master. Heleaves the man of the bible, and takes refuge with the man of the tomahawk. Herushes from the praying slaveholder into the paws of the bear. He quits thehomes of men for the haunts of wolves. He prefers to encounter a life of trial,however bitter, or death, however terrible, to dragging out his existence underthe dominion of these kind masters.The apologists for slavery often speak of the abuses of slavery; and they tellus that they are as much opposed to those abuses as we are; and that they wouldgo as far to correct those abuses and to ameliorate the condition of the slaveas anybody. The answer to that view is, that slavery is itself an abuse; that itlives by abuse; and dies by the absence of abuse. Grant that slavery is right;grant that the relations of master and slave may innocently exist; and there isnot a single outrage which was ever committed against the slave but what findsan apology in the very necessity of the case. As we said by a slaveholder (theRev. A. G. Few) to the Methodist conference, “If the relation be right, themeans to maintain it are also right;” for without those means slavery could notexist. Remove the dreadful scourge—the plaited thong—the galling fetter—theaccursed chain—and let the slaveholder rely solely upon moral and religiouspower, by which to secure obedience to his orders, and how long do you suppose aslave would remain on his plantation? The case only needs to be stated; itcarries its own refutation with it.Absolute and arbitrary power can never be maintained by one man over the bodyand soul of another man, without brutal chastisement and enormous cruelty.To talk of kindness entering into a relation in which one party is robbed ofwife, of children, of his hard earnings, of home, of friends, of society, ofknowledge, and of all that makes this life desirable, is most absurd, wicked,and preposterous.I have shown that slavery is wicked—wicked, in that it violates the great law ofliberty, written on every human heart—wicked, in that it violates the firstcommand of the decalogue—wicked, in that it fosters the most disgustinglicentiousness—wicked, in that it mars and defaces the image of God by cruel andbarbarous inflictions—wicked, in that it contravenes the laws of eternaljustice, and tramples in the dust all the humane and heavenly precepts of theNew Testament.The evils resulting from this huge system of iniquity are not confined to thestates south of Mason and Dixon’s line. Its noxious influence can easily betraced throughout our northern borders. It comes even as far north as the stateof New York. Traces of it may be seen even in Rochester; and travelers have toldme it casts its gloomy shadows across the lake, approaching the very shores ofQueen Victoria’s dominions.The presence of slavery may be explained by—as it is the explanation of—themobocratic violence which lately disgraced New York, and which still morerecently disgraced the city of Boston. These violent demonstrations, theseoutrageous invasions of human rights, faintly indicate the presence and power ofslavery here. It is a significant fact, that while meetings for almost anypurpose under heaven may be held unmolested in the city of Boston, that in thesame city, a meeting cannot be peaceably held for the purpose of preaching thedoctrine of the American Declaration of Independence, “that all men are createdequal.” The pestiferous breath of slavery taints the whole moral atmosphere ofthe north, and enervates the moral energies of the whole people.The moment a foreigner ventures upon our soil, and utters a natural repugnanceto oppression, that moment he is made to feel that there is little sympathy inthis land for him. If he were greeted with smiles before, he meets with frownsnow; and it shall go well with him if he be not subjected to that peculiarlyfining method of showing fealty to slavery, the assaults of a mob.Now, will any man tell me that such a state of things is natural, and that suchconduct on the part of the people of the north, springs from a consciousness ofrectitude? No! every fibre of the human heart unites in detestation of tyranny,and it is only when the human mind has become familiarized with slavery, isaccustomed to its injustice, and corrupted by its selfishness, that it fails torecord its abhorrence of slavery, and does not exult in the triumphs of liberty.The northern people have been long connected with slavery; they have been linkedto a decaying corpse, which has destroyed the moral health. The union of thegovernment; the union of the north and south, in the political parties; theunion in the religious organizations of the land, have all served to deaden themoral sense of the northern people, and to impregnate them with sentiments andideas forever in conflict with what as a nation we call genius of Americaninstitutions. Rightly viewed, this is an alarming fact, and ought to rally allthat is pure, just, and holy in one determined effort to crush the monster ofcorruption, and to scatter “its guilty profits” to the winds. In a high moralsense, as well as in a national sense, the whole American people are responsiblefor slavery, and must share, in its guilt and shame, with the most obduratemen-stealers of the south.While slavery exists, and the union of these states endures, every Americancitizen must bear the chagrin of hearing his country branded before the world asa nation of liars and hypocrites; and behold his cherished flag pointed at withthe utmost scorn and derision. Even now an American abroad is pointed out in thecrowd, as coming from a land where men gain their fortunes by “the blood ofsouls,” from a land of slave markets, of blood-hounds, and slave-hunters; and,in some circles, such a man is shunned altogether, as a moral pest. Is it nottime, then, for every American to awake, and inquire into his duty with respectto this subject?Wendell Phillips—the eloquent New England orator—on his return from Europe, in1842, said, “As I stood upon the shores of Genoa, and saw floating on the placidwaters of the Mediterranean, the beautiful American war ship Ohio, with hermasts tapering proportionately aloft, and an eastern sun reflecting her nobleform upon the sparkling waters, attracting the gaze of the multitude, my firstimpulse was of pride, to think myself an American; but when I thought that thefirst time that gallant ship would gird on her gorgeous apparel, and wake frombeneath her sides her dormant thunders, it would be in defense of the Africanslave trade, I blushed in utter shame for my country.”Let me say again, slavery is alike the sin and the shame of the American people;it is a blot upon the American name, and the only national reproach which needmake an American hang his head in shame, in the presence of monarchicalgovernments.With this gigantic evil in the land, we are constantly told to look at home; ifwe say ought against crowned heads, we are pointed to our enslaved millions; ifwe talk of sending missionaries and bibles abroad, we are pointed to threemillions now lying in worse than heathen darkness; if we express a word ofsympathy for Kossuth and his Hungarian fugitive brethren, we are pointed to thathorrible and hell-black enactment, “the fugitive slave bill.”Slavery blunts the edge of all our rebukes of tyranny abroad—the criticisms thatwe make upon other nations, only call forth ridicule, contempt, and scorn. In aword, we are made a reproach and a by-word to a mocking earth, and we mustcontinue to be so made, so long as slavery continues to pollute our soil.We have heard much of late of the virtue of patriotism, the love of country,&c., and this sentiment, so natural and so strong, has been impiously appealedto, by all the powers of human selfishness, to cherish the viper which isstinging our national life away. In its name, we have been called upon to deepenour infamy before the world, to rivet the fetter more firmly on the limbs of theenslaved, and to become utterly insensible to the voice of human woe that iswafted to us on every southern gale. We have been called upon, in its name, todesecrate our whole land by the footprints of slave-hunters, and even to engageourselves in the horrible business of kidnapping.I, too, would invoke the spirit of patriotism; not in a narrow and restrictedsense, but, I trust, with a broad and manly signification; not to cover up ournational sins, but to inspire us with sincere repentance; not to hide our shamefrom the the(sic) world’s gaze, but utterly to abolish the cause of that shame;not to explain away our gross inconsistencies as a nation, but to remove thehateful, jarring, and incongruous elements from the land; not to sustain anegregious wrong, but to unite all our energies in the grand effort to remedythat wrong.I would invoke the spirit of patriotism, in the name of the law of the livingGod, natural and revealed, and in the full belief that “righteousness exalteth anation, while sin is a reproach to any people.” “He that walketh righteously,and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shakethhis hands from the holding of bribes, he shall dwell on high, his place ofdefense shall be the munitions of rocks, bread shall be given him, his watershall be sure.”We have not only heard much lately of patriotism, and of its aid being invokedon the side of slavery and injustice, but the very prosperity of this people hasbeen called in to deafen them to the voice of duty, and to lead them onward inthe pathway of sin. Thus has the blessing of God been converted into a curse. Inthe spirit of genuine patriotism, I warn the American people, by all that isjust and honorable, to BEWARE!I warn them that, strong, proud, and prosperous though we be, there is a powerabove us that can “bring down high looks; at the breath of whose mouth ourwealth may take wings; and before whom every knee shall bow;” and who can tellhow soon the avenging angel may pass over our land, and the sable bondmen now inchains, may become the instruments of our nation’s chastisement! Withoutappealing to any higher feeling, I would warn the American people, and theAmerican government, to be wise in their day and generation. I exhort them toremember the history of other nations; and I remind them that America cannotalways sit “as a queen,” in peace and repose; that prouder and strongergovernments than this have been shattered by the bolts of a just God; that thetime may come when those they now despise and hate, may be needed; when thosewhom they now compel by oppression to be enemies, may be wanted as friends. Whathas been, may be again. There is a point beyond which human endurance cannot go.The crushed worm may yet turn under the heel of the oppressor. I warn them,then, with all solemnity, and in the name of retributive justice, to look totheir ways; for in an evil hour, those sable arms that have, for the last twocenturies, been engaged in cultivating and adorning the fair fields of ourcountry, may yet become the instruments of terror, desolation, and death,throughout our borders.It was the sage of the Old Dominion that said—while speaking of the possibilityof a conflict between the slaves and the slaveholders—“God has no attribute thatcould take sides with the oppressor in such a contest. I tremble for my countrywhen I reflect that God is just, and that his justice cannot sleep forever.”Such is the warning voice of Thomas Jefferson; and every day’s experience sinceits utterance until now, confirms its wisdom, and commends its truth."},{"pageContent":"WHAT TO THE SLAVE IS THE FOURTH OF JULY?. EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION, ATRochester, July 5, 1852Fellow-Citizens—Pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speakhere to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your nationalindependence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of naturaljustice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I,therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, andto confess the benefits, and express devout gratitude for the blessings,resulting from your independence to us?Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could betruthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and myburden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold that a nation’s sympathycould not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, thatwould not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid andselfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation’sjubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am notthat man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the “lameman leap as an hart.”But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of thedisparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this gloriousanniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distancebetween us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice, are not enjoyed incommon. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence,bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight thatbrought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. ThisFourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a manin fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him tojoin you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do youmean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is aparallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy theexample of a nation whose crimes, towering up to heaven, were thrown down by thebreath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-daytake up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people.“By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we rememberedZion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, theythat carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted usrequired of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we singthe Lord’s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my righthand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to theroof of my mouth.”Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultous joy, I hear the mournful wail ofmillions, whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are to-day rendered moreintolerable by the jubilant shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I do notfaithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, “may my righthand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!” Toforget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in with the populartheme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would make me areproach before God and the world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, isAMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from theslave’s point of view. Standing there, identified with the American bondman,making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that thecharacter and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on thisFourth of July. Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to theprofessions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous andrevolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnlybinds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed andbleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which isoutraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of theconstitution and the bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare tocall in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command,everything that serves to perpetuate slavery—the great sin and shame of America!“I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;” I will use the severest language Ican command; and yet not one word shall escape me that any man, whose judgmentis not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart a slaveholder, shall notconfess to be right and just.But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstancethat you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression onthe public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuademore and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, Isubmit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in theanti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do thepeople of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is aman? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholdersthemselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. Theyacknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There areseventy-two crimes in the state of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man(no matter how ignorant he be), subject him to the punishment of death; whileonly two of these same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment.What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual,and responsible being. The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted inthe fact that southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding,under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or write.When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field,then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in yourstreets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fishof the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish theslave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the Negro race. Isit not astonishing that, while we are plowing, planting, and reaping, using allkinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, buildingships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver, and gold; that, whilewe are reading, writing, and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants, andsecretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors,editors, orators, and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner ofenterprises common to other men—digging gold in California, capturing the whalein the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hillside, living, moving,acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives, and children,and, above all, confessing and worshiping the Christian’s God, and lookinghopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave—we are called upon to provethat we are men!Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightfulowner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue thewrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for republicans? Is it to be settledby the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with greatdifficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hardto be understood? How should I look to-day in the presence of Americans,dividing and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right tofreedom, speaking of it relatively and positively, negatively and affirmatively?To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to yourunderstanding. There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that does notknow that slavery is wrong for him.What! am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of theirliberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations totheir fellow-men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash,to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction,to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to burn their flesh, tostarve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that asystem, thus marked with blood and stained with pollution, is wrong? No; I willnot. I have better employment for my time and strength than such arguments wouldimply.What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God didnot establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemyin the thought. That which is inhuman cannot be divine. Who can reason on such aproposition! They that can, may! I cannot. The time for such argument is past.At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. Oh!had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I would to-day pour out afiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and sternrebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentleshower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. Thefeeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must beroused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of thenation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimedand denounced.What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that revealsto him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty towhich he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; yourboasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity;your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants,brass-fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery;your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religiousparade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, andhypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation ofsavages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shockingand bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies anddespotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out everyabuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of theevery-day practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, forrevolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival.THE INTERNAL SLAVE TRADE. EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION, AT ROCHESTER, JULY5, 1852Take the American slave trade, which, we are told by the papers, is especiallyprosperous just now. Ex-senator Benton tells us that the price of men was neverhigher than now. He mentions the fact to show that slavery is in no danger. Thistrade is one of the peculiarities of American institutions. It is carried on inall the large towns and cities in one-half of this confederacy; and millions arepocketed every year by dealers in this horrid traffic. In several states thistrade is a chief source of wealth. It is called (in contradistinction to theforeign slave trade) “the internal slave trade.” It is, probably, called so,too, in order to divert from it the horror with which the foreign slave trade iscontemplated. That trade has long since been denounced by this government aspiracy. It has been denounced with burning words, from the high places of thenation, as an execrable traffic. To arrest it, to put an end to it, this nationkeeps a squadron, at immense cost, on the coast of Africa. Everywhere in thiscountry, it is safe to speak of this foreign slave trade as a most inhumantraffic, opposed alike to the laws of God and of man. The duty to extirpate anddestroy it is admitted even by our doctors of divinity. In order to put an endto it, some of these last have consented that their colored brethren (nominallyfree) should leave this country, and establish themselves on the western coastof Africa. It is, however, a notable fact, that, while so much execration ispoured out by Americans, upon those engaged in the foreign slave trade, the menengaged in the slave trade between the states pass without condemnation, andtheir business is deemed honorable.Behold the practical operation of this internal slave trade—the American slavetrade sustained by American politics and American religion! Here you will seemen and women reared like swine for the market. You know what is a swine-drover?I will show you a man-drover. They inhabit all our southern states. Theyperambulate the country, and crowd the highways of the nation with droves ofhuman stock. You will see one of these human-flesh-jobbers, armed with pistol,whip, and bowie-knife, driving a company of a hundred men, women, and children,from the Potomac to the slave market at New Orleans. These wretched people areto be sold singly, or in lots, to suit purchasers. They are food for thecotton-field and the deadly sugar-mill. Mark the sad procession as it moveswearily along, and the inhuman wretch who drives them. Hear his savage yells andhis blood-chilling oaths, as he hurries on his affrighted captives. There, seethe old man, with locks thinned and gray. Cast one glance, if you please, uponthat young mother, whose shoulders are bare to the scorching sun, her brinytears falling on the brow of the babe in her arms. See, too, that girl ofthirteen, weeping, yes, weeping, as she thinks of the mother from whom she hasbeen torn. The drove moves tardily. Heat and sorrow have nearly consumed theirstrength. Suddenly you hear a quick snap, like the discharge of a rifle; thefetters clank, and the chain rattles simultaneously; your ears are saluted witha scream that seems to have torn its way to the center of your soul. The crackyou heard was the sound of the slave whip; the scream you heard was from thewoman you saw with the babe. Her speed had faltered under the weight of herchild and her chains; that gash on her shoulder tells her to move on. Followthis drove to New Orleans. Attend the auction; see men examined like horses; seethe forms of women rudely and brutally exposed to the shocking gaze of Americanslave-buyers. See this drove sold and separated forever; and never forget thedeep, sad sobs that arose from that scattered multitude. Tell me, citizens,where, under the sun, can you witness a spectacle more fiendish and shocking.Yet this is but a glance at the American slave trade, as it exists at thismoment, in the ruling part of the United States.I was born amid such sights and scenes. To me the American slave trade is aterrible reality. When a child, my soul was often pierced with a sense of itshorrors. I lived on Philpot street, Fell’s Point, Baltimore, and have watchedfrom the wharves the slave ships in the basin, anchored from the shore, withtheir cargoes of human flesh, waiting for favorable winds to waft them down theChesapeake. There was, at that time, a grand slave mart kept at the head ofPratt street, by Austin Woldfolk. His agents were sent into every town andcounty in Maryland, announcing their arrival through the papers, and on flaminghand-bills, headed, “cash for negroes.” These men were generally well dressed,and very captivating in their manners; ever ready to drink, to treat, and togamble. The fate of many a slave has depended upon the turn of a single card;and many a child has been snatched from the arms of its mothers by bargainsarranged in a state of brutal drunkenness.The flesh-mongers gather up their victims by dozens, and drive them, chained, tothe general depot at Baltimore. When a sufficient number have been collectedhere, a ship is chartered, for the purpose of conveying the forlorn crew toMobile or to New Orleans. From the slave-prison to the ship, they are usuallydriven in the darkness of night; for since the anti-slavery agitation a certaincaution is observed.In the deep, still darkness of midnight, I have been often aroused by the dead,heavy footsteps and the piteous cries of the chained gangs that passed our door.The anguish of my boyish heart was intense; and I was often consoled, whenspeaking to my mistress in the morning, to hear her say that the custom was verywicked; that she hated to hear the rattle of the chains, and the heart-rendingcries. I was glad to find one who sympathized with me in my horror.Fellow citizens, this murderous traffic is to-day in active operation in thisboasted republic. In the solitude of my spirit, I see clouds of dust raised onthe highways of the south; I see the bleeding footsteps; I hear the doleful wailof fettered humanity, on the way to the slave markets, where the victims are tobe sold like horses, sheep, and swine, knocked off to the highest bidder. ThereI see the tenderest ties ruthlessly broken, to gratify the lust, caprice, andrapacity of the buyers and sellers of men. My soul sickens at the sight. Is this the land your fathers loved? The freedom which they toiled to win? Is this the earth whereon they moved? Are these the graves they slumber in?But a still more inhuman, disgraceful, and scandalous state of things remains tobe presented. By an act of the American congress, not yet two years old, slaveryhas been nationalized in its most horrible and revolting form. By that act,Mason and Dixon’s line has been obliterated; New York has become as Virginia;and the power to hold, hunt, and sell men, women, and children as slaves,remains no longer a mere state institution, but is now an institution of thewhole United States. The power is coextensive with the star-spangled banner andAmerican christianity. Where these go, may also go the merciless slave-hunter.Where these are, man is not sacred. He is a bird for the sportsman’s gun. Bythat most foul and fiendish of all human decrees, the liberty and person ofevery man are put in peril. Your broad republican domain is a hunting-ground formen. Not for thieves and robbers, enemies of society, merely, but for men guiltyof no crime. Your law-makers have commanded all good citizens to engage in thishellish sport. Your president, your secretary of state, your lords, nobles, andecclesiastics, enforce as a duty you owe to your free and glorious country andto your God, that you do this accursed thing. Not fewer than forty Americanshave within the past two years been hunted down, and without a moment’s warning,hurried away in chains, and consigned to slavery and excruciating torture. Someof these have had wives and children dependent on them for bread; but of this noaccount was made. The right of the hunter to his prey, stands superior to theright of marriage, and to all rights in this republic, the rights of Godincluded! For black men there are neither law, justice, humanity, nor religion.The fugitive slave law makes MERCY TO THEM A CRIME; and bribes the judge whotries them. An American judge GETS TEN DOLLARS FOR EVERY VICTIM HE CONSIGNS toslavery, and five, when he fails to do so. The oath of an(sic) two villains issufficient, under this hell-black enactment, to send the most pious andexemplary black man into the remorseless jaws of slavery! His own testimony isnothing. He can bring no witnesses for himself. The minister of American justiceis bound by the law to hear but one side, and that side is the side of theoppressor. Let this damning fact be perpetually told. Let it be thundered aroundthe world, that, in tyrant-killing, king hating, people-loving, democratic,Christian America, the seats of justice are filled with judges, who hold theiroffice under an open and palpable bribe, and are bound, in deciding in the caseof a man’s liberty, to hear only his accusers!In glaring violation of justice, in shameless disregard of the forms ofadministering law, in cunning arrangement to entrap the defenseless, and indiabolical intent, this fugitive slave law stands alone in the annals oftyrannical legislation. I doubt if there be another nation on the globe havingthe brass and the baseness to put such a law on the statute-book. If any man inthis assembly thinks differently from me in this matter, and feels able todisprove my statements, I will gladly confront him at any suitable time andplace he may select.THE SLAVERY PARTY. EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH DELIVERED BEFORE THE A. A. S.Society, in New York, May, 1853.Sir, it is evident that there is in this country a purely slavery party—a partywhich exists for no other earthly purpose but to promote the interests ofslavery. The presence of this party is felt everywhere in the republic. It isknown by no particular name, and has assumed no definite shape; but its branchesreach far and wide in the church and in the state. This shapeless and namelessparty is not intangible in other and more important respects. That party, sir,has determined upon a fixed, definite, and comprehensive policy toward the wholecolored population of the United States. What that policy is, it becomes us asabolitionists, and especially does it become the colored people themselves, toconsider and to understand fully. We ought to know who our enemies are, wherethey are, and what are their objects and measures. Well, sir, here is my versionof it—not original with me—but mine because I hold it to be true.I understand this policy to comprehend five cardinal objects. They are these:1st. The complete suppression of all anti-slavery discussion. 2d. Theexpatriation of the entire free people of color from the United States. 3d. Theunending perpetuation of slavery in this republic. 4th. The nationalization ofslavery to the extent of making slavery respected in every state of the Union.5th. The extension of slavery over Mexico and the entire South American states.Sir, these objects are forcibly presented to us in the stern logic of passingevents; in the facts which are and have been passing around us during the lastthree years. The country has been and is now dividing on these grand issues. Intheir magnitude, these issues cast all others into the shade, depriving them ofall life and vitality. Old party ties are broken. Like is finding its like oneither side of these great issues, and the great battle is at hand. For thepresent, the best representative of the slavery party in politics is thedemocratic party. Its great head for the present is President Pierce, whoseboast it was, before his election, that his whole life had been consistent withthe interests of slavery, that he is above reproach on that score. In hisinaugural address, he reassures the south on this point. Well, the head of theslave power being in power, it is natural that the pro slavery elements shouldcluster around the administration, and this is rapidly being done. Afraternization is going on. The stringent protectionists and the free-tradersstrike hands. The supporters of Fillmore are becoming the supporters of Pierce.The silver-gray whig shakes hands with the hunker democrat; the former onlydiffering from the latter in name. They are of one heart, one mind, and theunion is natural and perhaps inevitable. Both hate Negroes; both hate progress;both hate the “higher law;” both hate William H. Seward; both hate the freedemocratic party; and upon this hateful basis they are forming a union ofhatred. “Pilate and Herod are thus made friends.” Even the central organ of thewhig party is extending its beggar hand for a morsel from the table of slaverydemocracy, and when spurned from the feast by the more deserving, it pockets theinsult; when kicked on one side it turns the other, and preseveres in itsimportunities. The fact is, that paper comprehends the demands of the times; itunderstands the age and its issues; it wisely sees that slavery and freedom arethe great antagonistic forces in the country, and it goes to its own side.Silver grays and hunkers all understand this. They are, therefore, rapidlysinking all other questions to nothing, compared with the increasing demands ofslavery. They are collecting, arranging, and consolidating their forces for theaccomplishment of their appointed work.The keystone to the arch of this grand union of the slavery party of the UnitedStates, is the compromise of 1850. In that compromise we have all the objects ofour slaveholding policy specified. It is, sir, favorable to this view of thedesigns of the slave power, that both the whig and the democratic party bentlower, sunk deeper, and strained harder, in their conventions, preparatory tothe late presidential election, to meet the demands of the slavery party than atany previous time in their history. Never did parties come before the northernpeople with propositions of such undisguised contempt for the moral sentimentand the religious ideas of that people. They virtually asked them to unite in awar upon free speech, and upon conscience, and to drive the Almighty presencefrom the councils of the nation. Resting their platforms upon the fugitive slavebill, they boldly asked the people for political power to execute the horribleand hell-black provisions of that bill. The history of that election reveals,with great clearness, the extent to which slavery has shot its leprousdistillment through the life-blood of the nation. The party most thoroughlyopposed to the cause of justice and humanity, triumphed; while the partysuspected of a leaning toward liberty, was overwhelmingly defeated, some sayannihilated.But here is a still more important fact, illustrating the designs of the slavepower. It is a fact full of meaning, that no sooner did the democratic slaveryparty come into power, than a system of legislation was presented to thelegislatures of the northern states, designed to put the states in harmony withthe fugitive slave law, and the malignant bearing of the national governmenttoward the colored inhabitants of the country. This whole movement on the partof the states, bears the evidence of having one origin, emanating from one head,and urged forward by one power. It was simultaneous, uniform, and general, andlooked to one end. It was intended to put thorns under feet already bleeding; tocrush a people already bowed down; to enslave a people already but half free; ina word, it was intended to discourage, dishearten, and drive the free coloredpeople out of the country. In looking at the recent black law of Illinois, oneis struck dumb with its enormity. It would seem that the men who enacted thatlaw, had not only banished from their minds all sense of justice, but all senseof shame. It coolly proposes to sell the bodies and souls of the blacks toincrease the intelligence and refinement of the whites; to rob every blackstranger who ventures among them, to increase their literary fund.While this is going on in the states, a pro-slavery, political board of healthis established at Washington. Senators Hale, Chase, and Sumner are robbed of apart of their senatorial dignity and consequence as representing sovereignstates, because they have refused to be inoculated with the slavery virus. Amongthe services which a senator is expected by his state to perform, are many thatcan only be done efficiently on committees; and, in saying to these honorablesenators, you shall not serve on the committees of this body, the slavery partytook the responsibility of robbing and insulting the states that sent them. Itis an attempt at Washington to decide for the states who shall be sent to thesenate. Sir, it strikes me that this aggression on the part of the slave powerdid not meet at the hands of the proscribed senators the rebuke which we had aright to expect would be administered. It seems to me that an opportunity waslost, that the great principle of senatorial equality was left undefended, at atime when its vindication was sternly demanded. But it is not to the purpose ofmy present statement to criticise the conduct of our friends. I am persuadedthat much ought to be left to the discretion of anti slavery men in congress,and charges of recreancy should never be made but on the most sufficientgrounds. For, of all the places in the world where an anti-slavery man needs theconfidence and encouragement of friends, I take Washington to be that place.Let me now call attention to the social influences which are operating andcooperating with the slavery party of the country, designed to contribute to oneor all of the grand objects aimed at by that party. We see here the black manattacked in his vital interests; prejudice and hate are excited against him;enmity is stirred up between him and other laborers. The Irish people,warm-hearted, generous, and sympathizing with the oppressed everywhere, whenthey stand upon their own green island, are instantly taught, on arriving inthis Christian country, to hate and despise the colored people. They are taughtto believe that we eat the bread which of right belongs to them. The cruel lieis told the Irish, that our adversity is essential to their prosperity. Sir, theIrish-American will find out his mistake one day. He will find that in assumingour avocation he also has assumed our degradation. But for the present we aresufferers. The old employments by which we have heretofore gained ourlivelihood, are gradually, and it may be inevitably, passing into other hands.Every hour sees us elbowed out of some employment to make room perhaps for somenewly-arrived emigrants, whose hunger and color are thought to give them a titleto especial favor. White men are becoming house-servants, cooks, and stewards,common laborers, and flunkeys to our gentry, and, for aught I see, they adjustthemselves to their stations with all becoming obsequiousness. This fact provesthat if we cannot rise to the whites, the whites can fall to us. Now, sir, lookonce more. While the colored people are thus elbowed out of employment; whilethe enmity of emigrants is being excited against us; while state after stateenacts laws against us; while we are hunted down, like wild game, and oppressedwith a general feeling of insecurity—the American colonization society—that oldoffender against the best interests and slanderer of the colored people—awakensto new life, and vigorously presses its scheme upon the consideration of thepeople and the government. New papers are started—some for the north and somefor the south—and each in its tone adapting itself to its latitude. Government,state and national, is called upon for appropriations to enable the society tosend us out of the country by steam! They want steamers to carry letters andNegroes to Africa. Evidently, this society looks upon our “extremity as itsopportunity,” and we may expect that it will use the occasion well. They do notdeplore, but glory, in our misfortunes.But, sir, I must hasten. I have thus briefly given my view of one aspect of thepresent condition and future prospects of the colored people of the UnitedStates. And what I have said is far from encouraging to my afflicted people. Ihave seen the cloud gather upon the sable brows of some who hear me. I confessthe case looks black enough. Sir, I am not a hopeful man. I think I am apt evento undercalculate the benefits of the future. Yet, sir, in this seeminglydesperate case, I do not despair for my people. There is a bright side to almostevery picture of this kind; and ours is no exception to the general rule. If theinfluences against us are strong, those for us are also strong. To the inquiry,will our enemies prevail in the execution of their designs. In my God and in mysoul, I believe they will not. Let us look at the first object sought for by theslavery party of the country, viz: the suppression of anti slavery discussion.They desire to suppress discussion on this subject, with a view to the peace ofthe slaveholder and the security of slavery. Now, sir, neither the principle northe subordinate objects here declared, can be at all gained by the slave power,and for this reason: It involves the proposition to padlock the lips of thewhites, in order to secure the fetters on the limbs of the blacks. The right ofspeech, precious and priceless, cannot, will not, be surrendered to slavery. Itssuppression is asked for, as I have said, to give peace and security toslaveholders. Sir, that thing cannot be done. God has interposed an insuperableobstacle to any such result. “There can be no peace, saith my God, to thewicked.” Suppose it were possible to put down this discussion, what would itavail the guilty slaveholder, pillowed as he is upon heaving bosoms of ruinedsouls? He could not have a peaceful spirit. If every anti-slavery tongue in thenation were silent—every anti-slavery organization dissolved—every anti-slaverypress demolished—every anti slavery periodical, paper, book, pamphlet, or whatnot, were searched out, gathered, deliberately burned to ashes, and their ashesgiven to the four winds of heaven, still, still the slaveholder could have “nopeace.” In every pulsation of his heart, in every throb of his life, in everyglance of his eye, in the breeze that soothes, and in the thunder that startles,would be waked up an accuser, whose cause is, “Thou art, verily, guiltyconcerning thy brother.”THE ANTI-SLAVERY MOVEMENT. EXTRACTS FROM A LECTURE BEFORE VARIOUSAnti-Slavery Bodies, in the Winter of 1855.A grand movement on the part of mankind, in any direction, or for any purpose,moral or political, is an interesting fact, fit and proper to be studied. It issuch, not only for those who eagerly participate in it, but also for those whostand aloof from it—even for those by whom it is opposed. I take theanti-slavery movement to be such an one, and a movement as sublime and gloriousin its character, as it is holy and beneficent in the ends it aims toaccomplish. At this moment, I deem it safe to say, it is properly engrossingmore minds in this country than any other subject now before the Americanpeople. The late John C. Calhoun—one of the mightiest men that ever stood up inthe American senate—did not deem it beneath him; and he probably studied it asdeeply, though not as honestly, as Gerrit Smith, or William Lloyd Garrison. Heevinced the greatest familiarity with the subject; and the greatest efforts ofhis last years in the senate had direct reference to this movement. His eagleeye watched every new development connected with it; and he was ever prompt toinform the south of every important step in its progress. He never allowedhimself to make light of it; but always spoke of it and treated it as a matterof grave import; and in this he showed himself a master of the mental, moral,and religious constitution of human society. Daniel Webster, too, in the betterdays of his life, before he gave his assent to the fugitive slave bill, andtrampled upon all his earlier and better convictions—when his eye was yetsingle—he clearly comprehended the nature of the elements involved in thismovement; and in his own majestic eloquence, warned the south, and the country,to have a care how they attempted to put it down. He is an illustration that itis easier to give, than to take, good advice. To these two men—the greatest mento whom the nation has yet given birth—may be traced the two great facts of thepresent—the south triumphant, and the north humbled. Their names may standthus—Calhoun and domination—Webster and degradation. Yet again. If to theenemies of liberty this subject is one of engrossing interest, vastly more soshould it be such to freedom’s friends. The latter, it leads to the gates of allvaluable knowledge—philanthropic, ethical, and religious; for it brings them tothe study of man, wonderfully and fearfully made—the proper study of man throughall time—the open book, in which are the records of time and eternity.Of the existence and power of the anti-slavery movement, as a fact, you need noevidence. The nation has seen its face, and felt the controlling pressure of itshand. You have seen it moving in all directions, and in all weathers, and in allplaces, appearing most where desired least, and pressing hardest where mostresisted. No place is exempt. The quiet prayer meeting, and the stormy halls ofnational debate, share its presence alike. It is a common intruder, and ofcourse has the name of being ungentlemanly. Brethren who had long sung, in themost affectionate fervor, and with the greatest sense of security, Together let us sweetly live—together let us die,have been suddenly and violently separated by it, and ranged in hostile attitudetoward each other. The Methodist, one of the most powerful religiousorganizations of this country, has been rent asunder, and its strongest bolts ofdenominational brotherhood started at a single surge. It has changed the tone ofthe northern pulpit, and modified that of the press. A celebrated divine, who,four years ago, was for flinging his own mother, or brother, into theremorseless jaws of the monster slavery, lest he should swallow up the Union,now recognizes anti-slavery as a characteristic of future civilization. Signsand wonders follow this movement; and the fact just stated is one of them. Partyties are loosened by it; and men are compelled to take sides for or against it,whether they will or not. Come from where he may, or come for what he may, he iscompelled to show his hand. What is this mighty force? What is its history? andwhat is its destiny? Is it ancient or modern, transient or permanent? Has itturned aside, like a stranger and a sojourner, to tarry for a night? or has itcome to rest with us forever? Excellent chances are here for speculation; andsome of them are quite profound. We might, for instance, proceed to inquire notonly into the philosophy of the anti-slavery movement, but into the philosophyof the law, in obedience to which that movement started into existence. We mightdemand to know what is that law or power, which, at different times, disposesthe minds of men to this or that particular object—now for peace, and now forwar—now for free dom, and now for slavery; but this profound question I leave tothe abolitionists of the superior class to answer. The speculations which mustprecede such answer, would afford, perhaps, about the same satisfaction as thelearned theories which have rained down upon the world, from time to time, as tothe origin of evil. I shall, therefore, avoid water in which I cannot swim, anddeal with anti-slavery as a fact, like any other fact in the history of mankind,capable of being described and understood, both as to its internal forces, andits external phases and relations.[After an eloquent, a full, and highly interesting exposition of the nature,character, and history of the anti-slavery movement, from the insertion of whichwant of space precludes us, he concluded in the following happy manner.]Present organizations may perish, but the cause will go on. That cause has alife, distinct and independent of the organizations patched up from time to timeto carry it forward. Looked at, apart from the bones and sinews and body, it isa thing immortal. It is the very essence of justice, liberty, and love. Themoral life of human society, it cannot die while conscience, honor, and humanityremain. If but one be filled with it, the cause lives. Its incarnation in anyone individual man, leaves the whole world a priesthood, occupying the highestmoral eminence even that of disinterested benevolence. Whoso has ascended hisheight, and has the grace to stand there, has the world at his feet, and is theworld’s teacher, as of divine right. He may set in judgment on the age, upon thecivilization of the age, and upon the religion of the age; for he has a test, asure and certain test, by which to try all institutions, and to measure all men.I say, he may do this, but this is not the chief business for which he isqualified. The great work to which he is called is not that of judgment. Likethe Prince of Peace, he may say, if I judge, I judge righteous judgment; stillmainly, like him, he may say, this is not his work. The man who has thoroughlyembraced the principles of justice, love, and liberty, like the true preacher ofChristianity, is less anxious to reproach the world of its sins, than to win itto repentance. His great work on earth is to exemplify, and to illustrate, andto ingraft those principles upon the living and practical understandings of allmen within the reach of his influence. This is his work; long or short hisyears, many or few his adherents, powerful or weak his instrumentalities,through good report, or through bad report, this is his work. It is to snatchfrom the bosom of nature the latent facts of each individual man’s experience,and with steady hand to hold them up fresh and glowing, enforcing, with all hispower, their acknowledgment and practical adoption. If there be but one such manin the land, no matter what becomes of abolition societies and parties, therewill be an anti-slavery cause, and an anti-slavery movement. Fortunately forthat cause, and fortunately for him by whom it is espoused, it requires noextraordinary amount of talent to preach it or to receive it when preached. Thegrand secret of its power is, that each of its principles is easily renderedappreciable to the faculty of reason in man, and that the most unenlightenedconscience has no difficulty in deciding on which side to register itstestimony. It can call its preachers from among the fishermen, and raise them topower. In every human breast, it has an advocate which can be silent only whenthe heart is dead. It comes home to every man’s understanding, and appealsdirectly to every man’s conscience. A man that does not recognize and approvefor himself the rights and privileges contended for, in behalf of the Americanslave, has not yet been found. In whatever else men may differ, they are alikein the apprehension of their natural and personal rights. The difference betweenabolitionists and those by whom they are opposed, is not as to principles. Allare agreed in respect to these. The manner of applying them is the point ofdifference.The slaveholder himself, the daily robber of his equal brother, discourseseloquently as to the excellency of justice, and the man who employs a brutaldriver to flay the flesh of his negroes, is not offended when kindness andhumanity are commended. Every time the abolitionist speaks of justice, theanti-abolitionist assents says, yes, I wish the world were filled with adisposition to render to every man what is rightfully due him; I should then getwhat is due me. That’s right; let us have justice. By all means, let us havejustice. Every time the abolitionist speaks in honor of human liberty, hetouches a chord in the heart of the anti-abolitionist, which responds inharmonious vibrations. Liberty—yes, that is evidently my right, and let himbeware who attempts to invade or abridge that right. Every time he speaks oflove, of human brotherhood, and the reciprocal duties of man and man, theanti-abolitionist assents—says, yes, all right—all true—we cannot have suchideas too often, or too fully expressed. So he says, and so he feels, and onlyshows thereby that he is a man as well as an anti-abolitionist. You have only tokeep out of sight the manner of applying your principles, to get them endorsedevery time. Contemplating himself, he sees truth with absolute clearness anddistinctness. He only blunders when asked to lose sight of himself. In his owncause he can beat a Boston lawyer, but he is dumb when asked to plead the causeof others. He knows very well whatsoever he would have done unto himself, but isquite in doubt as to having the same thing done unto others. It is just here,that lions spring up in the path of duty, and the battle once fought in heavenis refought on the earth. So it is, so hath it ever been, and so must it everbe, when the claims of justice and mercy make their demand at the door of humanselfishness. Nevertheless, there is that within which ever pleads for the rightand the just.In conclusion, I have taken a sober view of the present anti-slavery movement. Iam sober, but not hopeless. There is no denying, for it is everywhere admitted,that the anti-slavery question is the great moral and social question now beforethe American people. A state of things has gradually been developed, by whichthat question has become the first thing in order. It must be met. Herein is myhope. The great idea of impartial liberty is now fairly before the Americanpeople. Anti-slavery is no longer a thing to be prevented. The time forprevention is past. This is great gain. When the movement was younger andweaker—when it wrought in a Boston garret to human apprehension, it might havebeen silently put out of the way. Things are different now. It has grown toolarge—its friends are too numerous—its facilities too abundant—its ramificationstoo extended—its power too omnipotent, to be snuffed out by the contingencies ofinfancy. A thousand strong men might be struck down, and its ranks still beinvincible. One flash from the heart-supplied intellect of Harriet Beecher Stowecould light a million camp fires in front of the embattled host of slavery,which not all the waters of the Mississippi, mingled as they are with blood,could extinguish. The present will be looked to by after coming generations, asthe age of anti-slavery literature—when supply on the gallop could not keep pacewith the ever growing demand—when a picture of a Negro on the cover was a helpto the sale of a book—when conservative lyceums and other American literaryassociations began first to select their orators for distinguished occasionsfrom the ranks of the previously despised abolitionists. If the anti-slaverymovement shall fail now, it will not be from outward opposition, but from inwarddecay. Its auxiliaries are everywhere. Scholars, authors, orators, poets, andstatesmen give it their aid. The most brilliant of American poets volunteer inits service. Whittier speaks in burning verse to more than thirty thousand, inthe National Era. Your own Longfellow whispers, in every hour of trial anddisappointment, “labor and wait.” James Russell Lowell is reminding us that “menare more than institutions.” Pierpont cheers the heart of the pilgrim in searchof liberty, by singing the praises of “the north star.” Bryant, too, is with us;and though chained to the car of party, and dragged on amidst a whirl ofpolitical excitement, he snatches a moment for letting drop a smiling verse ofsympathy for the man in chains. The poets are with us. It would seem almostabsurd to say it, considering the use that has been made of them, that we haveallies in the Ethiopian songs; those songs that constitute our national music,and without which we have no national music. They are heart songs, and thefinest feelings of human nature are expressed in them. “Lucy Neal,” “OldKentucky Home,” and “Uncle Ned,” can make the heart sad as well as merry, andcan call forth a tear as well as a smile. They awaken the sympathies for theslave, in which antislavery principles take root, grow, and flourish. Inaddition to authors, poets, and scholars at home, the moral sense of thecivilized world is with us. England, France, and Germany, the three great lightsof modern civilization, are with us, and every American traveler learns toregret the existence of slavery in his country. The growth of intelligence, theinfluence of commerce, steam, wind, and lightning are our allies. It would beeasy to amplify this summary, and to swell the vast conglomeration of ourmaterial forces; but there is a deeper and truer method of measuring the powerof our cause, and of comprehending its vitality. This is to be found in itsaccordance with the best elements of human nature. It is beyond the power ofslavery to annihilate affinities recognized and established by the Almighty. Theslave is bound to mankind by the powerful and inextricable net-work of humanbrotherhood. His voice is the voice of a man, and his cry is the cry of a man indistress, and man must cease to be man before he can become insensible to thatcry. It is the righteous of the cause—the humanity of the cause—whichconstitutes its potency. As one genuine bankbill is worth more than a thousandcounterfeits, so is one man, with right on his side, worth more than a thousandin the wrong. “One may chase a thousand, and put ten thousand to flight.” It is,therefore, upon the goodness of our cause, more than upon all other auxiliaries,that we depend for its final triumph.Another source of congratulations is the fact that, amid all the efforts made bythe church, the government, and the people at large, to stay the onward progressof this movement, its course has been onward, steady, straight, unshaken, andunchecked from the beginning. Slavery has gained victories large and numerous;but never as against this movement—against a temporizing policy, and againstnorthern timidity, the slave power has been victorious; but against the spreadand prevalence in the country, of a spirit of resistance to its aggression, andof sentiments favorable to its entire overthrow, it has yet accomplishednothing. Every measure, yet devised and executed, having for its object thesuppression of anti-slavery, has been as idle and fruitless as pouring oil toextinguish fire. A general rejoicing took place on the passage of “thecompromise measures” of 1850. Those measures were called peace measures, andwere afterward termed by both the great parties of the country, as well as byleading statesmen, a final settlement of the whole question of slavery; butexperience has laughed to scorn the wisdom of pro-slavery statesmen; and theirfinal settlement of agitation seems to be the final revival, on a broader andgrander scale than ever before, of the question which they vainly attempted tosuppress forever. The fugitive slave bill has especially been of positiveservice to the anti-slavery movement. It has illustrated before all the peoplethe horrible character of slavery toward the slave, in hunting him down in afree state, and tearing him away from wife and children, thus setting its claimshigher than marriage or parental claims. It has revealed the arrogant andoverbearing spirit of the slave states toward the free states; despising theirprinciples—shocking their feelings of humanity, not only by bringing before themthe abominations of slavery, but by attempting to make them parties to thecrime. It has called into exercise among the colored people, the hunted ones, aspirit of manly resistance well calculated to surround them with a bulwark ofsympathy and respect hitherto unknown. For men are always disposed to respectand defend rights, when the victims of oppression stand up manfully forthemselves.There is another element of power added to the anti-slavery movement, of greatimportance; it is the conviction, becoming every day more general and universal,that slavery must be abolished at the south, or it will demoralize and destroyliberty at the north. It is the nature of slavery to beget a state of things allaround it favorable to its own continuance. This fact, connected with the systemof bondage, is beginning to be more fully realized. The slave-holder is notsatisfied to associate with men in the church or in the state, unless he canthereby stain them with the blood of his slaves. To be a slave-holder is to be apropagandist from necessity; for slavery can only live by keeping down theunder-growth morality which nature supplies. Every new-born white babe comesarmed from the Eternal presence, to make war on slavery. The heart of pity,which would melt in due time over the brutal chastisements it sees inflicted onthe helpless, must be hardened. And this work goes on every day in the year, andevery hour in the day.What is done at home is being done also abroad here in the north. And even nowthe question may be asked, have we at this moment a single free state in theUnion? The alarm at this point will become more general. The slave power must goon in its career of exactions. Give, give, will be its cry, till the timiditywhich concedes shall give place to courage, which shall resist. Such is thevoice of experience, such has been the past, such is the present, and such willbe that future, which, so sure as man is man, will come. Here I leave thesubject; and I leave off where I began, consoling myself and congratulating thefriends of freedom upon the fact that the anti-slavery cause is not a new thingunder the sun; not some moral delusion which a few years’ experience may dispel.It has appeared among men in all ages, and summoned its advocates from allranks. Its foundations are laid in the deepest and holiest convictions, and fromwhatever soul the demon, selfishness, is expelled, there will this cause take upits abode. Old as the everlasting hills; immovable as the throne of God; andcertain as the purposes of eternal power, against all hinderances, and againstall delays, and despite all the mutations of human instrumentalities, it is thefaith of my soul, that this anti-slavery cause will triumph."},{"pageContent":"FOOTNOTES1 (return[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-0.htm.html#linknoteref-1])[ Letter, Introduction to Life of Frederick Douglass, Boston, 1841.]2 (return[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-0.htm.html#linknoteref-2])[ One of these ladies, impelled by the same noble spirit which carried MissNightingale to Scutari, has devoted her time, her untiring energies, to a greatextent her means, and her high literary abilities, to the advancement andsupport of Frederick Douglass’ Paper, the only organ of the downtrodden, editedand published by one of themselves, in the United States.]3 (return[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-0.htm.html#linknoteref-3])[ Mr. Stephen Myers, of Albany, deserves mention as one of the most perseveringamong the colored editorial fraternity.]4 (return[@public@vhost@g@gutenberg@html@files@202@202-h@202-h-0.htm.html#linknoteref-4])[ The German physiologists have even discovered vegetable matter—starch—in thehuman body.
