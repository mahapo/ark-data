This presumptive negro was evenpresent at the London World's Temperance Convention, last year; and in spite ofall the efforts of the American Delegates to prevent it, he palmed off hisAbolition bombast upon an audience of 7000 persons! Of this high-handed measurehe now makes his boast in New-York, one of the hot-beds of Abolitionism. TheReport is given exactly as published in the New-York Tribune. The reader willmake his own comments.Mr. Douglass was introduced to the audience by Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Esq.,President of the American Anti-Slavery Society, and, upon taking the platform,was greeted with enthusiastic and long-continued applause by the vast concoursewhich filled the spacious Tabernacle to overflowing. As soon as the audiencebecame silent, Mr. D. with, at first, a slight degree of embarrassment,addressed them as follows:\"I am very glad to be here. I am very glad to be present at thisAnniversary—glad again to mingle my voice with those with whom I have stoodidentified, with those with whom I have labored, for the last seven years, forthe purpose of undoing the burdens of my brethren, and hastening the day oftheir emancipation.I do not doubt but that a large portion of this audience will be disappointed,both by the manner and the matter of what I shall this day set forth. Theextraordinary and unmerited eulogies which have been showered upon me, here andelsewhere, have done much to create expectations which, I am well aware, I cannever hope to gratify. I am here, a simple man, knowing what I have experiencedin Slavery, knowing it to be a bad system, and desiring, by all Christian means,to seek its overthrow. I am not here to please you with an eloquent speech, witha refined and logical address, but to speak to you the sober truths of a heartoverborne with gratitude to God that we have in this land, cursed as it is withSlavery, so noble a band to second my efforts and the efforts of others in thenoble work of undoing the Yoke of Bondage, with which the majority of the Statesof this Union are now unfortunately cursed.Since the last time I had the pleasure of mingling my voice with the voices ofmy friends on this platform, many interesting and even trying events haveoccurred to me. I have experienced, within the last eighteen or twenty months,many incidents, all of which it would be interesting to communicate to you; butmany of these I shall be compelled to pass over at this time, and confine myremarks to giving a general outline of the manner and spirit with which I havebeen hailed abroad, and welcomed at the different places which I have visitedduring my absence of twenty months.You are aware, doubtless, that my object in going from this country, was to getbeyond the reach of the clutch of the man who claimed to own me as his property.I had written a book giving a history of that portion of my life spent in thegall and bitterness and degradation of Slavery, and in which I also identifiedmy oppressors as the perpetrators of some of the most atrocious crimes. This haddeeply incensed them against me, and stirred up within them the purpose ofrevenge, and my whereabouts being known, I believed it necessary for me, if Iwould preserve my liberty, to leave the shores of America, and take up my abodein some other land, at least until the excitement occasioned by the publicationof my Narrative had subsided. I went to England, Monarchical England, to get ridof Democratic Slavery, and I must confess that, at the very threshold, I wassatisfied that I had gone to the right place. Say what you will of England—ofthe degradation—of the poverty—and there is much of it there—say what you willof the oppression and suffering going on in England at this time, there isLiberty there—there is Freedom there, not only for the white man, but for theblack man also. The instant I stepped upon the shore, and looked into the facesof the crowd around me, I saw in every man a recognition of my manhood, and anabsence, a perfect absence, of everything like that disgusting hate with whichwe are pursued in this country. [Cheers.] I looked around in vain to see in anyman's face a token of the slightest aversion to me on account of my complexion.Even the cabmen demeaned themselves to me as they did to other men, and the verydogs and pigs of old England treated me as a man! I cannot, however, my friends,dwell upon this anti-Prejudice, or rather the many illustrations of the absenceof Prejudice against Color in England—but will proceed, at once, to defend theRight and Duty of invoking English aid and English sympathy for the overthrow ofAmerican Slavery, for the education of Colored Americans, and to forward inevery way, the interests of humanity; inasmuch as the right of appealing toEngland for aid in overthrowing Slavery in this country, has been called inquestion, in public meetings and by the press, in this city.I cannot agree with my friend Mr. Garrison in relation to my love and attachmentto this land. I have no love for America, as such; I have no patriotism. I haveno country. What country have I? The Institutions of this country do not knowme—do not recognize me as a man. I am not thought of, spoken of, in anydirection, out of the Anti-Slavery ranks, as a man. I am not thought of orspoken of, except as a piece of property belonging to some ChristianSlaveholder, and all the Religious and Political Institutions of this Countryalike pronounce me a Slave and a chattel. Now, in such a country as this Icannot have patriotism. The only thing that links me to this land is my family,and the painful consciousness that here there are 3,000,000 of my fellowcreatures groaning beneath the iron rod of the worst despotism that could bedevised even in Pandemonium,—that here are men and brethren who are identifiedwith me by their complexion, identified with me by their hatred of Slavery,identified with me by their love and aspirations for Liberty, identified with meby the stripes upon their backs, their inhuman wrongs and cruel sufferings.This, and this only, attaches me to this land, and brings me here to plead withyou, and with this country at large, for the disenthrallment of my oppressedcountrymen, and to overthrow this system of Slavery which is crushing them tothe earth. How can I love a country that dooms 3,000,000 of my brethren, some ofthem my own kindred, my own brothers, my own sisters, who are now clanking thechains of Slavery upon the plains of the South, whose warm blood is now makingfat the soil of Maryland and of Alabama, and over whose crushed spirits rollsthe dark shadow of Oppression, shutting out and extinguishing forever thecheering rays of that bright Sun of Liberty, lighted in the souls of all God'schildren by the omnipotent hand of Deity itself? How can I, I say, love acountry thus cursed, thus bedewed with the blood of my brethren? A Country, theChurch of which, and the Government of which, and the Constitution of which arein favor of supporting and perpetuating this monstrous system of injustice andblood? I have not, I cannot have, any love for this country, as such, or for itsConstitution. I desire to see it overthrown as speedily as possible and itsConstitution shivered in a thousand fragments, rather than this foul curseshould continue to remain as now. [Hisses and cheers.]In all this, my friends, let me make myself understood. I do not hate America asagainst England, or against any other country or land. I love Humanity all overthe globe. I am anxious to see Righteousness prevail in all directions. I amanxious to see Slavery overthrown here; but, I never appealed to Englishmen in amanner calculated to awaken feelings of hatred or disgust, or to inflame theirprejudices toward America as a nation, or in a manner provocative of nationaljealousy or ill-will; but I always appealed to their conscience—to the higherand nobler feelings of the people of that country, to enlist them in this cause.I always appealed to their manhood, that which preceded their being Englishmen,(to quote an expression of my friend Phillips,) I appealed to them as men, and Ihad a right to do so. They are men, and the Slave is a man, and we have a rightto call upon all men to assist in breaking his bonds, let them be born when andlive where they may.But it is asked, 'What good will this do?' or 'What good has it done?' 'Have younot irritated, have you not annoyed your American friends and the Americanpeople rather than done them good?' I admit that we have irritated them. Theydeserve to be irritated. I am anxious to irritate the American people on thisquestion. As it is in physics, so in morals, there are cases which demandirritation and counter-irritation. The conscience of the American public needsthis irritation, and I would blister it all over from centre to circumference,until it gives signs of a purer and a better life than it is now manifesting tothe world.But why expose the sins of one nation in the eyes of another? Why attempt tobring one people under the odium of another people? There is much force in thisquestion. I admit that there are sins in almost every country which can be bestremoved by means confined exclusively to their immediate locality. But suchevils and such sins pre-suppose the existence of a moral power in theirimmediate locality sufficient to accomplish the work of renovation. But, where,pray, can we go to find moral power in this nation sufficient to overthrowSlavery? To what institution, to what party shall we apply for aid? I say weadmit that there are evils which can be best removed by influences confined totheir immediate locality. But in regard to American Slavery it is not so. It issuch a giant crime, so darkening to the soul, so blinding in its moralinfluence, so well calculated to blast and corrupt all the humane principles ofour nature, so well adapted to infuse its own accursed spirit into all aroundit, that the people among whom it exists have not the moral power to abolish it.Shall we go to the Church for this influence? We have heard its characterdescribed. Shall we go to Politicians or Political Parties? Have they the moralpower necessary to accomplish this mighty task? They have not. What are theydoing at this moment? Voting supplies for Slavery—voting supplies for theextension, the stability, the perpetuation of Slavery in this land. What is thepress doing? The same. The pulpit? Almost the same. I do not flatter myself thatthere is moral power in the land sufficient to overthrow Slavery, and I welcomethe aid of England. And that aid will come. The growing intercourse betweenEngland and this country, by means of steam navigation, the relaxation of theprotective system in various countries in Europe, gives us an opportunity tobring in the aid, the moral and Christian aid of those living on the other sideof the Atlantic. We welcome it in the language of the resolution. We entreat ourBritish friends to continue to send their remonstrances across the deep againstSlavery in this land. And these remonstrances will have a powerful effect here.Sir, the Americans may tell of their ability, and I have no doubt they have it,to keep back the invader's hosts, to repulse the strongest force that itsenemies may send against this country. It may boast, and rightly boast of itscapacity to build its ramparts so high that no foe can hope to scale them—torender them so impregnable as to defy the assaults of the world. But, sir, thereis one thing it cannot resist, come from what quarter it may. It cannot resistTRUTH. You cannot build your forts so strong, nor your ramparts so high, nor armyourselves so powerfully, as to be able to withstand the overwhelming MORALSENTIMENT against Slavery now flowing into this land. For example: Prejudiceagainst Color is continually becoming weaker in this land; and why? Because thewhole European Continent denounces this sentiment as unworthy a lodgment in thebreast of an enlightened community. And the American abroad dares not now, evenin a public conveyance, to lift his voice in defence of this disgustingprejudice.I do not mean to say that there are no practices abroad which deserve to receivean influence, favorable to their extermination, from America. I am most glad toknow that Democratic Freedom—not the bastard Democracy which, while loud in itsprotestations of regard for Liberty and Equality, builds up Slavery, and, in thename of Freedom fights the battles of Despotism—is making great strides inEurope. We see, abroad, in England especially, happy indications of the progressof American principles. A little while ago England was cursed by a Cornmonopoly—by that giant monopoly which snatched from the mouths of the famishingPoor the bread which you sent from this land. The community—the people ofEngland demanded its destruction, and they have triumphed! We have aided them,and they aid us, and the mission of the two nations, henceforth, is to serveeach other.Sir, it is said that, when abroad, I misrepresented my country on this question.I am not aware of any misrepresentation. I stated facts and facts only. Agentleman of your own City, Rev. Dr. Cox, has taken particular pains tostigmatize me as having introduced the subject of Slavery illegitimately intothe World's Temperance Convention. But what was the fact? I went to thatConvention, not as a Delegate—I went into it by the invitation of a Committee ofthe Convention. I suppose most of you know the circumstances, but I wish to sayone word in relation to the spirit and the principle which animated me at thatmeeting. I went into it at the invitation of the Committee, and spoke not onlyat their urgent request, but by public announcement. I stood on the platform onthe evening referred to, and heard some eight or ten Americans address the 7,000people assembled in that vast Hall. I heard them speak of the Temperancemovement in the land. I heard them eulogize the Temperance Societies in thehighest terms, calling on England to follow their example (and England mayfollow them with advantage to herself;) but I heard no reference made to the3,000,000 of people in this country who are denied the privilege, not only ofTemperance, but of all other Societies. I heard not a word of the AmericanSlaves, who, if seven of them were found together at a Temperance meeting or anyother place, would be scourged and beaten by their cruel tyrants. Yes,nine-and-thirty lashes is the penalty required to be inflicted by the law if anyof the Slaves get together in a number exceeding seven, for any purpose, howeverpeaceable or laudable. And while these American gentlemen were extending theirhands to me, and saying, 'How do you do, Mr. Douglass? I am most happy to meetyou here,' &c. &c. I knew that, in America, they would not have touched me witha pair of tongues. I felt, therefore, that that was the place and the time tocall to remembrance the 3,000,000 of Slaves, whom I aspired to represent on thatoccasion. I did so, not maliciously, but with a desire, only, to subserve thebest interests of my race. I besought the American Delegates who had at firstresponded to my speech with shouts of applause, when they should arrive at home,to extend the borders of their Temperance Societies, so as to include the500,000 Colored People in the Northern States of the Union. I also called tomind the facts in relation to the mob that occurred in the City of Philadelphiain the year 1842. I stated these facts to show to the British public howdifficult it is for a colored man in this country to do anything to elevatehimself or his race from the state of degradation in which they are plunged; howdifficult it is for him to be virtuous or temperate, or anything but a menial,an outcast. You all remember the circumstances of the mob to which I havealluded. A number of intelligent, philanthropic, manly colored men, desirous ofsnatching their colored brethren from the fangs of intemperance, formedthemselves into a procession and walked through the streets of Philadelphia withappropriate banners, and badges, and mottoes. I stated the fact that thatprocession was not allowed to proceed far, in the City of Philadelphia—theAmerican City of Brotherly Love, the city of all others loudest in its boasts offreedom and liberty—before these noble-minded men were assaulted by thecitizens, their banners torn in shreds and themselves trampled in the dust, andinhumanly beaten, and all their bright and fond hopes and anticipations inbehalf of their friends and their race blasted by the wanton cruelty of theirwhite fellow citizens. And all this was done for no other reason than that theyhad presumed to walk through the streets with Temperance banners and badges,like human beings.The statement of this fact caused the whole Convention to break forth in onegeneral expression of intense disgust at such atrocious and inhuman conduct.This disturbed the composure of some of our American representatives, who, inserious alarm, caught hold of the skirts of my coat, and attempted to make medesist from my exposition of the situation of the colored race in this country.There was one Doctor of Divinity there—the ugliest man that I ever saw in mylife—who almost tore the skirts of my coat off, so vehement was he in hisfriendly attempts to induce me to yield the floor. But fortunately the audiencecame to my rescue, and demanded that I should go on, and I did go on, and, Itrust, discharged my duty to my brethren in bonds and the cause of HumanLiberty, in a manner not altogether unworthy the occasion.I have been accused of dragging the question of Slavery into the Convention. Ihad a right to do so. It was the World's Convention—not the Convention of anysect or number of sects—not the convention of any particular Nation—not a man'snor a woman's Convention, not a black man's nor a white man's Convention, butthe World's Convention, the convention of ALL, black as well as white, bond aswell as free. And I stood there, as I thought, a representative of 3,000,000 ofmen whom I had left in rags and wretchedness to be devoured by the accursedInstitution which stands by them, as with a drawn sword, ever ready to fall upontheir devoted and defenceless heads. I felt, as I said to Dr. Cox, that it wasdemanded of me by Conscience, to speak out boldly in behalf of those whom I hadleft behind. [Cheers.] And, sir, (I think I may say this, without subjectingmyself to the charge of egotism) I deem it very fortunate for the friends of theSlave, that Mr. Garrison and myself were there just at that time. Sir, theChurches in this country have long repined at the position of the Churches inEngland on the subject of Slavery. They have sought many opportunities to doaway the prejudices of the English Churches against American Slavery. Why, sir,at this time there were not far from Seventy Ministers of the Gospel fromChristian America, in England, pouring their leprous pro-slavery distilment intothe ears of the people of that country, and by their prayers, their conversationand their public speeches, seeking to darken the British mind on the subject ofSlavery, and to create in the English public the same cruel and heartless apathythat prevails in this country in relation to the Slave, his wrongs and hisrights. I knew them by their continuous slandering of my race, and at this time,and under these circumstances, I deemed it a happy interposition of God, inbehalf of my oppressed, and misrepresented, and slandered people, that one oftheir number should be able to break his chains and burst up through the darkincrustations of malice and hate and degradation which had been thrown overthem, and stand before the British public to open to them the secrets of theprison-house of bondage in America. [Cheers.] Sir, the Slave sends no Delegatesto the Evangelical Alliance. [Cheers.] The Slave sends no Delegates to theWorld's Temperance Convention. Why? Because chains are upon his arms, andfetters fast bind his limbs. He must be driven out to be sold at auction by someChristian Slaveholder, and the money for which his soul is bartered must beappropriated to spread the Gospel among the Heathen.Sir, I feel it is good to be here. There is always work to be done. Slavery iseverywhere. Slavery goes out in the Cambria and comes back in the Cambria.Slavery was in the Evangelical Alliance, looking saintly in the person of Rev.Doctor Smythe; it was in the World's Temperance Convention, in the person ofRev. Mr. Kirk. Dr. Marsh went about saying, in so many words, that theunfortunate Slaveholders in America were so peculiarly situated, so environed byuncontrollable circumstances that they could not liberate their slaves; that ifthey were to emancipate them they would be, in many instances, cast into prison.Sir, it did me good to go around on the heels of this gentleman. I was glad tofollow him around for the sake of my country, for the country is not, after all,so bad as Rev. Dr. Marsh represented it to be. My fellow countrymen, what thinkye he said of you, on the other side of the Atlantic? He said you were not onlypro-Slavery, but that you actually aided the Slaveholder in holding his Slavessecurely in his grasp; that, in fact, you compelled him to be a Slaveholder.This I deny. You are not so bad as that. You do not compel the Slaveholder to bea Slaveholder.And Rev. Doctor Cox, too, talked a great deal over there, and among otherthings, he said that 'many Slave-holders—dear Christian men!—were sincerelyanxious to get rid of their slaves;' and to show how difficult it is for them toget rid of their human chattels, he put the following case: A man living in aState, the laws of which compel all persons emancipating their slaves to removethem beyond its limits, wishes to liberate his slaves; but he is too poor totransport them beyond the confines of the State in which he resides; thereforehe cannot emancipate them—he is necessarily a slaveholder. But, sir, there wasone fact, which I happened, fortunately, to have on hand just at that time,which completely neutralized this very affecting statement of the Doctor's. Itso happens that Messrs. Gerrit Smith and Arthur Tappan have advertised for theespecial benefit of this afflicted class of Slaveholders, that they have setapart the sum of $10,000, to be appropriated in aiding them to remove theiremancipated Slaves beyond the jurisdiction of the State, and that the moneywould be forthcoming on application being made for it; but no such applicationwas ever made. This shows that however truthful the statements of thesegentlemen may be concerning the things of the world to come, they are lamentablyreckless in their statements concerning things appertaining to this world. I donot mean to say that they would designedly tell that which is false; but theydid make the statements which I have ascribed to them.And Doct. Cox and others charge me with having stirred up warlike feeling whileabroad. This charge, also, I deny. The whole of my arguments and the whole of myappeals, while I was abroad, were in favor of any thing else than war. Iembraced every opportunity to propagate the principles of Peace while I was inGreat Britain. I confess, honestly, that were I not a Peace man, were I abeliever in fighting at all, I should have gone through England, saying toEnglishmen, as Englishmen, 'There are 3,000,000 of men across the Atlantic whoare whipped, scourged, robbed of themselves, denied every privilege, denied theright to read the Word of the God who made them, trampled under foot, denied allthe rights of human beings; go to their rescue; shoulder your muskets, buckle onyour knapsacks, and in the invincible cause of Human Rights and UniversalLiberty, go forth, and the laurels which you shall win will be as fadeless andas imperishable as the eternal aspirations of the human soul after that Freedomwhich every being made after God's image instinctively feels is his birthright.'This would have been my course had I been a war man. That such was not mycourse, I appeal to my whole career while abroad to determine.Weapons of war we have cast from the battle:Truth is our armor—our watchword is Love;Hushed be the sword, and the musketry's rattle,All our equipments are drawn from above.Praise then the God of Truth,Hoary age and ruddy youth.Long may our rally beLove, Light and Liberty;Ever our banner the banner of Peace.\"Mr. Douglass took his seat in the midst of the most enthusiastic andoverwhelming applause in which the whole of the vast assembly appeared heartilyto join.[Transcriber's Note: This text has been transcribed from Library of Congressscans of a pamphlet printed in Baltimore MD which has minor damage at the outerlower corners.
