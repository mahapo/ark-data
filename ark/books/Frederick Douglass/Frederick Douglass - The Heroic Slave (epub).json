The brig carried 13sailors and crew, 6 white passengers, numerous boxes of tobacco, and 135 slaves,worth about $100,000 (around $3 million in 2014 currency). Eight days later, asthe Creole sailed through the northern Bahamas, 19 slaves rose up in revolt.Within a few hours they had taken control of the ship and forced a crewman tosail the brig to the Bahamas. They put into port on New Providence at Nassau,the largest settlement in the Bahamas, populated chiefly by blacks who had beenfreed by Great Britain’s 1833 Emancipation Act. The Creole reached Nassau on 9November. The mutineers appealed to the British authorities, who within a weekhad freed the 116 slaves not participating in the rebellion, but detained themutineers; in March 1842, they, too, were freed. The rebellion was comparativelycivil: 1 crewman and 2 slaves were killed. Taking into account the numbersliberated versus those killed, it was one of the most successful slave revoltsin North America.1 [introfn.html#introfn_1]Twelve years after the rebellion, Frederick Douglass published The Heroic Slave,a historical novella about the Creole mutiny, in the 1853 Autographs forFreedom, a fund-raising volume edited by Julia Griffiths, a British friend andthe managing editor of his newspaper.2 [introfn.html#introfn_2] Douglass thenserialized the novella in March 1853 in his newspaper, Frederick Douglass’Paper. His only work of fiction, The Heroic Slave is one of the earliestexamples of African American fiction, and it is part of an American canon thatwas profoundly shaped by the historical fiction of Sir Walter Scott, JamesFenimore Cooper, Catharine Maria Sedgwick, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and many others.The Creole rebellion not only was important in American history and politics,but also had an impact on Douglass’s career, moving him toward a more radicalposition on the uses of violence to achieve black freedom. In The Heroic Slave,Douglass addressed the abolitionist movement, the trans-Atlantic history ofslavery, interracial friendship, black leadership, and the relationship betweenjournalism, fiction, and history. With his skillful use of setting, point ofview, and stylized theatrical dialogue, Douglass also offered a rousing goodread, making one almost lament that this was his only work of fiction. It is notsurprising that over the past thirty years, The Heroic Slave has emerged as anessential text in the nineteenth-century American literary canon. This culturaland critical edition provides, for the first time, an authoritative text of TheHeroic Slave, along with primary and secondary materials that will help readersexplore the novella’s historical, biographical, and literary contexts.The Creole mutiny electrified the nation and helped escalate sectional tensionsover slavery. Southerners (and some northerners) were outraged that Britishauthorities chose to free U.S. slaves, especially those who had taken violentaction against their masters. They viewed the British as endorsing slaveinsurrections—their worst nightmare—while also denying Americans their legalright to the domestic slave trade. In response, many southerners demanded warwith England and threatened to start it themselves. The abolitionist newspaperthe Liberator, reprinting an article from the Portsmouth, New Hampshire Journal,summed up their position by imagining a particularly boisterous southerner whoannounces to the nation: “‘If you will not go to war to defend us in this rightof slave-trading, we will begin the fight ourselves, and plunge you into a war,whether you will or no.’”3 [introfn.html#introfn_3]Additionally fueling southern fury was the decision by the U.S. Supreme Courtjust a few months before the Creole rebellion to liberate 54 African slaves who,having been illegally imported to Cuba, mutinied on the Spanish slaver Amistadbefore drifting into Long Island Sound. The leaders of the rebellion were jailedin Connecticut, and between 1839 and 1841 became celebrities of sorts as theywere interviewed in their cells and then involved in court trials that made themsympathetic to many northerners. The charismatic leader of the rebellion,Cinqué, a Mendi village leader from West Africa, helped make the Amistad a causecélèbre in the United States and abroad. The black abolitionist Robert Purvisargued that Cinqué helped inspire the leader of the Creole rebellion (see thePurvis selection in part 4 [part04.html#part04] of this volume). In both theAmistad decision and the Creole case, many southerners, along with proslaverynortherners, concluded that judges in England and the United States endorsedslaves’ rights to rebel against their masters.4 [introfn.html#introfn_4]The Creole mutiny underscored for southern planters that their peculiarinstitution was under siege. Although they produced two-thirds of the world’scotton and were the wealthiest Americans, they nevertheless felt deeplythreatened by the swift rise of antislavery sentiment throughout the New World.For millennia, slavery had been an almost unquestioned institution, recognizedas a byproduct of civilization. When the United States was founded, slavery waslegal everywhere in the New World. But in little more than two generations, thenorthern states and most of Central and South America had emancipated theirslaves. Southern slave owners increasingly saw themselves as living on an islandof slavery in a growing sea of freedom, and it horrified them.Southern leaders sought to reverse this trend. Envisioning a future slave empirethat would extend into the Caribbean, they succeeded in annexing the slaverepublic of Texas in 1845, which helped spark a war with Mexico that broughtmillions more acres of slave territory into the United States. Additionally,many leaders wanted to annex the slave colony of Cuba. To support their dreamsof expansion, southern writers articulated a powerful proslavery ideology,drawing heavily on the Bible and other canonical texts, from Aristotle and St.Augustine to John Locke and Thomas Carlyle, to support their claim that slaverywas socially and ethically beneficial to the expanding nation.5[introfn.html#introfn_5]Because they recognized how powerful antislavery testimony could be, southernpoliticians did everything they could to censor antislavery writings andspeeches. Their efforts to suppress civil liberties in the northern free stateslargely failed. But throughout the slave states, where there already was a defacto understanding that antislavery thought was anathema, they banned thecirculation of antislavery literature and criminalized antislavery utterances.In the U.S. Congress, southern politicians during the 1830s worked with theirnorthern allies to implement the “gag rule,” a procedure that automaticallytabled thousands of antislavery petitions in an effort to prevent debates overslavery in the House and Senate. This effort to cut off debate, which wasstrongly opposed by the former president and now congressman John Quincy Adams,further heightened sectional tensions and produced exactly what southernersdidn’t want, which was more debate about slavery in Congress.6[introfn.html#introfn_6]Ironically, southerners’ outrage over the Creole rebellion helped repeal the gagrule, which had been implemented in 1836. Joshua Giddings, an antislaverycongressman from Ohio, joined with John Quincy Adams to protest the suppressionof antislavery debate. In the wake of the Creole uprising, Giddings proposedresolutions supporting the black rebels. In response, southern congressmancensured Giddings, who immediately chose to resign in protest. Two months later,his constituents expressed their outrage over the suppression of free speech byreelecting Giddings in a landslide. When he reissued his resolutions,southerners no longer tried to silence him, having recognized that “gagging”politicians greatly antagonized northern voters. Although the gag rule remainedon the books until 1844, it “morally ceased to operate” after the controversyover Giddings’s resolutions.7 [introfn.html#introfn_7]Southerners’ belligerent responses to the Creole mutiny highlighted toantislavery northerners the degree to which the “Slave Power,” an oligarchy ofthe South’s most powerful leaders, sought to nationalize slavery. Southernersexpected the federal government (and foreign powers) to support their peculiarinstitution. But antislavery northerners viewed such support as an affront todemocratic and Christian values. William Ellery Channing, among the nation’smost prominent ministers and intellectuals, was especially troubled by northern“doughface” politicians, who placated southerners as an expression of theirloyalty to the Union. Southerners expected the federal government “to spread ashield over American slavery abroad as well as at home,” he noted in The Duty ofthe Free States, or Remarks Suggested by the Case of the Creole (1842). Such aperspective contradicted American jurisprudence and morality, Channingemphasized. Slavery was neither a national institution, nor could it be“recognized by the law of nations.”8 [introfn.html#introfn_8]Borrowing from William Blackstone, the British legal theorist who profoundlyshaped American jurisprudence, Channing and other antislavery leaders arguedthat the natural law of freedom trumped positive law, except in localmunicipalities and states. The Somerset case of 1772, which freed all slaves whoset foot in England, did not recognize property in human beings. And the SlaveryAbolition Act of 1833, which freed all slaves in the British West Indies (andnearly all the rest of the empire), including non-British slaves who arrivedthere, operated according to a similar legal understanding. The articulation of“freedom national,” which was emphasized by Channing and others in the wake ofthe Creole rebellion, would become a foundational platform of the RepublicanParty when it formed during the 1850s.9 [introfn.html#introfn_9]Antislavery northerners, who were dismayed by southerners’ attacks on theBritish for harboring the Creole rebels, were equally dismayed by DanielWebster’s insistence that the British either return the slaves to their legalowners or else pay some form of restitution. Webster, the secretary of stateunder President John Tyler and a former Whig senator from Massachusetts, hadlong been regarded in New England as a great “champion of liberty.”10[introfn.html#introfn_10] But in his official letter to Edward Everett, the U.S.minister to England, he argued that the British had illegally freed the Creoleslaves, whom he regarded as murderers, and that it was therefore incumbent uponBritain to make amends to the slaves’ owners. Whatever Webster may have thoughtof slavery itself, he believed that the Constitution and other U.S. legaldocuments protected southern slave owners and that U.S. law should be honored onthe high seas. Webster quickly softened his attack on the British whilenegotiating a treaty with Lord Ashburton over boundary disputes. As a result,the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 did not prevent Britain from declaringfuture slave rebels free upon reaching British soil. Nevertheless, manyantislavery northerners concluded, well before the Compromise of 1850, thatWebster valued the Union more than freedom and could no longer be trusted on theslavery issue.11 [introfn.html#introfn_11]When it came to freedom, antislavery northerners saw in the black leaders of theCreole parallels with the nation’s revolutionary heroes, especially given theresonant American Revolutionary name of the principal leader of the rebellion,Madison Washington. As reported in numerous antislavery newspapers, Washingtonwas a Virginia slave who had escaped to Canada and then returned to theplantation in an attempt to free his wife, only to be captured and reenslaved.He was subsequently sold as a “dangerous slave” to the trader Thomas McCargo,who put him aboard the Creole with other slaves to sell in New Orleans. Toantislavery northerners, Washington’s heroic and essentially nonviolent attemptto rescue his wife resembled his leadership during the rebellion, in which hecoupled his desire for freedom with clemency toward his former captors. Even theCreole’s crew acknowledged that Washington had spared the lives of the ship’scaptain, a French sailor, McCargo, another trader, and McCargo’s son. Anewspaper article headlined “The Hero Mutineers,” published in the 7 January1842 issue of the Liberator, can be taken as representative of abolitionists’sentiment toward Washington; the anonymous author called him “the master spirit”of the rebellion and likened him to the American Revolutionary founders whosenames he bore. Such journalistic portrayals encouraged slaves to strike fortheir freedom and suggested that rebel slaves were as worthy of citizenship aswhites. No wonder that, in the wake of the Creole mutiny, two lines from LordByron’s Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage (canto 2; 1812) became a common refrain formany black and some white radicals, including Frederick Douglass: “Hereditarybondsmen! know ye not / Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow?”Douglass used the line as an epigraph in The Heroic Slave, omitting therestrictive “hereditary”: all bondsmen seeking freedom must strike the blow.12[introfn.html#introfn_12]Frederick Douglass and Madison Washington became public heroes at almostprecisely the same time. Washington was front-page news beginning in December1841, after the crew of the Creole returned to New Orleans. He was immediatelycast as a hero by antislavery northerners; and when stories of his attempt toliberate his wife became known in the spring of 1842, he was further celebrated.Douglass, after escaping from slavery in Maryland in 1838, settled in NewBedford, Massachusetts, with his wife, Anna Murray, a free black woman. Alreadyliterate and skilled as an orator, he preached in the city’s AME Zion churchwhile earning money as a day laborer. He subscribed to the Liberator, the Bostonorgan of the American Anti-Slavery Society, edited by the great abolitionistleader William Lloyd Garrison. He read the Liberator as devoutly as his Bible,“mastering” its contents each week. As he later remarked: “The paper became mymeat and my drink.”13 [introfn.html#introfn_13] In August 1841 he attended anational abolitionist convention in Nantucket, where he spoke to a mostly whiteaudience of five hundred people. On the strength of his speech, he was hired asa full-time paid lecturer for the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, anauxiliary of the Garrisonian-controlled American Anti-Slavery Society. InDecember 1841, the same month that the Liberator featured news of the Creolemutiny, a journalist termed Douglass “a hero” when describing his performance asa speaker: “This is an extraordinary man. He was cut out for a hero…. He has the‘heart to conceive, the head to contrive, and the hand to execute.’” Theassessment echoed descriptions of Madison Washington from antislaveryjournalists. In fact, Douglass would portray Washington in The Heroic Slave inalmost identical terms: “He had the head to conceive, and the hand toexecute.”14 [introfn.html#introfn_14]Douglass resembled Madison Washington in other ways as well. Both were givennames “unfit for a slave, but finely expressive for a hero,” as the newspaperarticle “The Hero Mutineers” said of the latter. Douglass had been bornFrederick Augustus Washington Bailey, his two middle names reflecting greatrepublican leaders. Like most fugitives, he had discarded his surname afterreaching free soil, taking on the new surname “Douglass”—the Scottish lord inSir Walter Scott’s poem The Lady of the Lake (1810)—as a way of marking hissocial ascent.15 [introfn.html#introfn_15]Then, too, they were both large, strong men who had fought their way to freedomwhile displaying leniency toward their oppressors. Madison Washington commencedthe mutiny by throwing off two men who had seized him. The turning point inDouglass’s life as a slave, as he often noted, was his famous fight with EdwardCovey, a “slave breaker” from Maryland’s Eastern Shore, to whom he had beenhired out. During their epic, two-hour battle, Douglass could probably havekilled Covey. But he went “strictly on the defensive,” as he later wrote, andafter two hours Covey gave up, having been “mastered by a boy of sixteen.” Theeffect was extraordinary; as Douglass noted in his Narrative of the Life ofFrederick Douglass, an American Slave (1845) and My Bondage and My Freedom(1855): “I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, theday had passed forever when I could be a slave in fact.” Covey never whipped himagain. A slave who refused to be flogged was already more than “half free.”16[introfn.html#introfn_16]Douglass, who would have read accounts of the Creole rebellion in theabolitionist press, greatly admired Washington’s heroism. This was no doubtpartly owing to their similarities. But it was also an age of hero worship.Having read Thomas Carlyle’s hugely influential book on heroes, Douglassacknowledged that he, too, was a hero-worshipper, and Washington would emerge asone of his heroes.17 [introfn.html#introfn_17] In the first few years after therebellion, however, Douglass felt constrained against publicly lionizingWashington. His first public mention of Washington in a speech was in 1845, morethan three years after the uprising.18 [introfn.html#introfn_18] This silencestemmed partly from Douglass’s commitment during this time to the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society’s emphasis on moral suasion as the sole means of endingslavery. Pacifism was the defining doctrine of the society, and Garrison and hisassociates did not hesitate to criticize abolitionists—notably, blacks andLiberty Party members—who condoned or sanctioned militancy. For example, whenthe black abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet, a minister and Liberty Partymember, celebrated Madison Washington as a revolutionary hero in an address atan 1843 black convention, the American Anti-Slavery Society rebuked him: “Trustnot the counsels that lead you to the shedding of blood.” Douglass, who was atthe convention, also dissented from Garnet’s militancy. There was “too muchphysical force” in his address, he said. He wanted “to try the moral means alittle longer,” adding that Garnet’s address would lead to “insurrection,” whichwould be a “catastrophe.”19 [introfn.html#introfn_19]Two years later, Douglass offered a dramatically different perspective on theCreole rebellion. During an October 1845 speech in Cork, Ireland, he transformedWashington from a violent insurrectionary into a revolutionary hero, echoingGarnet’s praise for the man. “Madison Washington had in imitation of GeorgeWashington gained liberty,” he proclaimed, but white Americans “branded him asbeing a thief, robber and murderer.”20 [introfn.html#introfn_20] Developing theparallels between American Revolutionary heroes and Washington, he claimed thatthe condemnation of Washington, which was rife among southerners (and among manynortherners, too) stemmed largely from racism, which kept them from seeing howMadison Washington acted in the tradition of such celebrated Virginia patriotsas Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, and George Washington.Why this profound shift? Much had changed for Douglass between 1843 and 1845. InMay 1845 he published his Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, whichmade him nationally famous, virtually a household name; but it also greatlyjeopardized his freedom. Fearing fugitive slave hunters, he fled to the BritishIsles for protection. No longer under the watchful eye of the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society’s leaders, he could now speak his mind more openly. He hadalready been reprimanded by the society, as he later remarked in My Bondage andMy Freedom, “for insubordination to my superiors,” and he had discovered thatmost white abolitionists were not immune to the racial prejudice that pervadedthe country. Many white colleagues patronized him: just “give us the facts,”said one, and “we will take care of the philosophy.” But in the British Isles,Douglass experienced “a perfect absence of everything like that disgusting hatewith which we are pursued in America.” Similarly, while many white Americanstreated the Creole rebels as murderers, most Britons viewed them as heroes. Asone British editorial writer proclaimed, they were as “justified in theiractions as prisoners of war.”21 [introfn.html#introfn_21]After spending nearly two years touring the Britain Isles as an antislaverylecturer, Douglass was tempted to remain there permanently. He was so popular inBritain that he regularly filled auditoriums, some of which held over seventhousand people. Often in his speeches he invoked the heroism of MadisonWashington and his fellow rebels. British sympathizers purchased Douglass’sfreedom, much as they had given Washington his liberty; and they raised anadditional $2,000 as a cushion for Douglass against financial worries. Afterreturning to the United States, Douglass used that money to purchase a printingpress so that he could start up his own newspaper, the North Star, a decisionthat frayed his relationship with Garrison, the editor of the Liberator.Reunited with his family, Douglass moved to Rochester, New York, which lacked anabolitionist newspaper and yet was a Liberty Party stronghold and a hub on theUnderground Railroad.In Rochester, Douglass befriended people who had personally known MadisonWashington. As a result of these friendships, he no doubt heard more storiesabout Washington. Hiram Wilson, a Quaker abolitionist living in Canada, hadopened his home to Washington; and Douglass got to know him through theirinvolvement in the Western New York Anti-Slavery Society. Lindley Murray Moore,a Rochester abolitionist, had harbored Washington as well, and had also raisedmoney to help him on his journey back to Virginia to free his wife. Douglass andMoore lectured at many of the same events, including Rochester’s 1852Independence Day celebration, where Douglass gave his famous speech “What to theSlave Is the Fourth of July?” And Moore contributed an essay to Autographs forFreedom, the collection of antislavery writings in which The Heroic Slave wasfirst published.22 [introfn.html#introfn_22]Douglass’s remarks on Washington between 1843 and the publication of The HeroicSlave in 1853 (which can be traced in part 3 [part03.html#part03] of thisvolume) reveal his growing fascination with the Creole rebellion. That interestparalleled his loss of faith in peaceful means for ending slavery. Events in thelate 1840s, and then the passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, radicalizedcountless abolitionists, such as John Brown, who became a friend of Douglass’s.In moving to Rochester, Douglass effectively abandoned the paternalisticinfluences of the American Anti-Slavery Society, which advocated nonresistanceand considered politics, government, and violence equally corrupt. Initially,his newspaper sought to bridge the divide between nonresistance and the LibertyParty, which justified the use of force by calling on every loyal American tointerfere with slavery wherever it existed. But in 1851, Douglass officiallyturned his paper into an organ of the Liberty Party, changing its name from theNorth Star to Frederick Douglass’ Paper and switching his loyalties fromGarrison to Gerrit Smith, a founder of the Liberty Party and its three-timepresidential candidate (he was also a wealthy benefactor who helped Douglasswith some of the funding for his newspaper). Significantly, Gerrit Smith,William Lloyd Garrison, and Madison Washington are the only three historicalfigures in The Heroic Slave. Smith is described as “a devoted friend” of blacks,who would receive Washington “gladly.”23 [introfn.html#introfn_23]Inspired by the Creole rebels, Douglass planned a trip to Nassau in February1852, no doubt hoping to meet with Madison Washington. According to articles inhis newspaper and in the New York Tribune, the purpose of the trip was to obtain“antislavery impressions” that would give him “ample materials” for writing anaccount of the rebellion. Included among these materials would have been thewords of Madison Washington, for the article in Frederick Douglass’ Paper noted:“Nassau is the home of the heroes of the Creole. Madison Washington himself isthere.” Although Douglass ended up not visiting Nassau, his plans suggest hiscontinuing deep fascination with Washington—a fascination that eventuallyinspired him to write The Heroic Slave.24 [introfn.html#introfn_24]The publication of The Heroic Slave in Autographs for Freedom (January 1853; seefigure 1 [intro.html#fig1]) coincided with the legal settlement of the Creolemutiny. Britain refused to pay restitution for the liberated slaves, but agreedto establish an Anglo-American claims commission to assess the case. The umpire,Joshua Bates, was a Boston partner in the House of Baring, a British financialfirm that had financed the Louisiana Purchase. On 8 February 1853, Bates ruledthat the authorities at Nassau had violated “the established law of nations” andthat southern claimants were entitled to compensation for the loss of theirproperty. Two years later, Britain paid the former owners a fair market value of$110,000 for their slaves. At the very moment when the legal system declared avictory for southerners, Douglass offered a literary brief declaring victory forthe rebel slaves. From this perspective, he emphasized that fiction was moreeffective than law in representing the truth of the Creole affair.images [../images/f0xxv-01.jpg]1. Autographs for Freedom (1853), title page. Collection of John Stauffer.What are the truths that Douglass explores in The Heroic Slave? One is thatfiction has the potential to be more honest, or authentic, than nonfictionnarratives of the Creole rebellion, a number of which are included in thisedition. The journalistic accounts of Madison Washington, both proslavery andantislavery, based their assessments of him on scant evidence—primarily,depositions taken by whites aboard the Creole. And this evidence wasconflicting: Washington could reasonably be construed as either a temperaterevolutionary hero fighting for his and his compatriots’ freedom, or a tyrant.According to some accounts of the rebellion, at its outset he shouted to hisfellow rebels, “We have begun, and must go through,” followed by a threat to theother 116 slaves: “Come up, every one of you! If you don’t lend a hand, I willkill you all, and throw you overboard.” In describing Washington as a hero,antislavery journalists ignored evidence of such coercive threats. Douglassavoids the conundrum of parsing the scant historical record by acknowledging atthe very beginning of The Heroic Slave that “glimpses” of Washington “are allthat can now be presented”: “We peer into the dark, and wish even for theblinding flash, or the light of northern skies to reveal him. But alas! he isstill enveloped in darkness.” Having made this concession, Douglass goes on toportray Washington as a sublimely fascinating fictional character based on thehistorical record.25 [introfn.html#introfn_25]Douglass had long recognized that truth telling was, along with rhetoric (theart of persuasion), one of the abolitionists’ most potent weapons againstslavery. Historical fiction enabled him to couple honesty with his rhetoricalgifts. His planned trip to Nassau in February 1852 hints that he may have hopedto write a nonfiction account of the Creole rebellion, based on interviews withWashington and other participants, before recognizing, right around the time ofthe 20 March 1852 publication of Uncle Tom’s Cabin, that he could do even morethrough the power of fiction. Stowe’s novel, which Douglass greatly admired,sold an unprecedented 10,000 copies in its first week of publication, in largepart because serialization of the novel in the antislavery weekly the NationalEra from June 1851 to April 1852 had sparked interest in the book. Uncle Tom’sCabin sold 300,000 copies in its first year and became the publishing phenomenonof the nineteenth century. As Douglass would do in The Heroic Slave, Stowecharacterizes her narrative as one based on historical facts: the narratordeclares in the final chapter that the “separate incidents that compose thenarrative are, to a very great extent, authentic, occurring, many of them,either under her own observation, or that of her personal friends.” Stowefurther authenticated her novel by publishing A Key to Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1853),which presented the “facts and documents upon which the story was founded.”26[introfn.html#introfn_26]Douglass was one of the first newspaper editors to recognize the degree to whichStowe’s novel was converting millions of northerners into antislavery advocateswho would resist the Fugitive Slave Law and heed the “higher law” of God. InApril 1852, his newspaper included an in-house review of Uncle Tom’s Cabin(probably by the managing editor, Julia Griffiths), which concluded: “We doubtif abler arguments have ever been presented in favor of the ‘Higher Law’ theory,than may be found here.” Over the next two years, Douglass publicized andpromoted Stowe’s novel, hoping that Stowe would donate money earned from hernovel and antislavery tours to help him create a black mechanics institute inRochester. Flattered by Douglass’s attention, Stowe not only contributed a poemto the volume of antislavery writings in which The Heroic Slave appeared butalso gave the volume its title, as reported in the 13 August 1852 issue ofFrederick Douglass’ Paper: “The gifted authoress of ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin’ haschristened it ‘Autographs for Freedom.’” In essence, the success of Uncle Tom’sCabin paved the way for The Heroic Slave, the first historical fiction by anAfrican American.27 [introfn.html#introfn_27] And though Stowe never gaveDouglass the funds he was hoping for, they had a genuinely productive literaryrelationship. In The Heroic Slave, Douglass departs from Stowe’s idealization ofthe nonviolent, Christlike Uncle Tom by depicting a black-skinned hero who ismore than willing to use violence to gain his freedom from slavery. And inStowe’s second antislavery novel, Dred (1856), she responds to Douglass’sconception of a more activist black heroism by creating her own black-skinnedrevolutionary hero, Dred, who, like Madison Washington, adopts violence in hiswar against white enslavers.28 [introfn.html#introfn_28]A second large truth, or insight, that Douglass emphasizes in The Heroic Slave,going against the grain of his 1840s commitment to Garrisonian moral suasion, isthe productive confluence between slave resistance and abolitionism. By the late1840s and early 1850s, Douglass had come to recognize that slave resistancecould play a crucial role in the antislavery movement. Slave resistance hadinspired the formation of the first abolition societies by calling attention tothe barbarities of the slave system that gave rise to such violence. As anex-slave who often still defined himself as a fugitive, Douglass understood thatslavery was what he called “a state of war” between master and slave. Therecould thus be no peace in the nation until slavery was abolished. The Creolerebellion had highlighted for him the problem of insisting upon pacifism as thesole means of ending slavery.29 [introfn.html#introfn_29]Douglass’s Madison Washington seems to embody the essential abolitionistdoctrine of slave resistance, summarized in Romans 13: “Resistance to tyrants isobedience to God.”30 [introfn.html#introfn_30] But he isn’t simply physical inhis resistance; he is eloquent as well. The only hint in the historical recordof Washington’s oratorical skills is his brief, arresting address to his fellowmutineers to commence the rebellion, followed by his threat to the slaves. Fromthe historical silences, Douglass uses fiction to give Washington the voice thatdominates the novella. Washington’s eloquent defense of his rebelliousnessenables Mr. Listwell, the white hero, to empathize with him. Mr. List-well isaptly named; he can “listen well” to what this black leader has to say. In part1 [part01.html#part01] of the novella, Listwell is politically transformed aftereavesdropping on Washington’s eloquent words. Washington’s “soliloquy” rang“through the chambers of his soul, and vibrated through his entire frame.” “Fromthis hour,” Listwell vows, “I am an abolitionist.” Washington even comes closeto converting Tom Grant, the overseer on the Creole, who was modeled on thehistorical William Merritt (see Merritt’s deposition in part 2[part02.html#part02] of this volume). “The fellow loomed up before me,” Grantsays of Washington. “I forgot his blackness in the dignity of his manner, andthe eloquence of his speech. It seemed as if the souls of both the great dead(whose names he bore) had entered him.”31 [introfn.html#introfn_31] Douglasssuggests that rebellion alone will not convert whites into viewing blacks asequals and citizens. Effective abolitionism required rebellion plustruth-telling eloquence. His hero unites both rebelliousness and eloquence inorder to undermine slavery and racism, much as Douglass was trying to do.With his emphasis on the interracial dynamic of Washington’s eloquence, Douglassapproaches black rebellion very differently from Herman Melville, whose BenitoCereno (1855) is the other great novella of black rebellion at sea publishedduring the 1850s. Whereas Washington gains the allegiance of the main whitecharacter in The Heroic Slave, in ways that Douglass hoped would gain theallegiance of his white readers, Melville chose to create a black rebel, Babo,who speaks ironically and archly and then, when captured, chooses not to speakat all. Melville works through irony and indirection; Douglass, consistent withhis commitment to abolitionism, works more directly in articulating his themes.But different as the novellas may seem, they are similarly committed to the useof theatrical form, in the sense that both works present blacks as performers inwhite slave culture. Melville philosophically explores the psychologicalinterdependence of masters and slaves; Douglass more directly challenges whitemastery.32 [introfn.html#introfn_32]There is a third large truth or insight in The Heroic Slave: slave rebels andabolitionists were willing to embrace any society in which they could live asfree and equal citizens. In his historical accounts and novella, Douglasspresents Madison Washington as “protected” by the British lion’s “mighty pawfrom the talons and the beak of the American eagle.” Though Douglass invokesAmerican Revolutionary ideals, his novella displays no overarching orunconditional loyalty to the United States; instead, it is an uncompromisingcritique of American society and liberal (that is, white male) democracy. Thestate of Virginia, in part 3 [part03.html#part03] of the novella, is presentedas having descended from the glory days of the American Revolution to the pointof being identified with spittoons and heavy drinking, a place where intemperateracist whites delude themselves into a sense of self-worth by thinking ofthemselves as superior to blacks. By emphasizing the fallenness of Americanculture and ideals, The Heroic Slave offers a powerful vision of blacknationalism when the blacks of Nassau embrace the African Americans of theCreole. Douglass and his fictional hero would ideally prefer to remain in theUnited States, for it is their birthplace and the home of their families andfriends. But the novella suggests that if this were not the case, that if thenation continued to fail to live up to its democratic ideals, then newnationalist realignments would be in order.33 [introfn.html#introfn_33]The black nationalism that emerges at the end of The Heroic Slave may seem atodds with the conventional understanding of Frederick Douglass, who is oftencast as a “representative American,” an integrationist, a non-emigrationist, and(after the Civil War) a Republican party hack. But Douglass had a long-standingfascination with black history and black nations; he considered the possibilityof immigrating to Haiti in the late 1850s, when he was especially disillusionedabout the prospects for blacks in the United States; and near the end of hislife, he held a consulship in Haiti and then represented Haiti at the 1893World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.34 [introfn.html#introfn_34] With itsemphasis on violence and black community, The Heroic Slave speaks to values thatDouglass had long embraced but had tempered while working for the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society. Moreover, the novella offers insights that are at oddswith the traditional historiography of abolitionism, which conceives of themovement as primarily white and nonviolent. Douglass recognized thatabolitionists were radical critics rather than boosters of American society, andthat blacks had absolutely crucial roles in the movement. Even Listwell, thewhite abolitionist, who can seem relatively passive, becomes implicated in blackviolence and transnationalist dissent when he decides, at the very last minute,to give Washington “three strong files.”35 [introfn.html#introfn_35] In theversion of events presented in The Heroic Slave, without those files Washingtonwould have found it difficult to act; but without having listened to Washingtonin the first place, Listwell would not have offered those files. In this way,Douglass points to the crucial role played by black oppositional voices in theabolitionist movement. Through the friendship between Listwell and Washington,he also points to the multiracial possibilities of the novella’stransnationalist vision.Appearing in the 1853 Autographs for Freedom, which had American and Britisheditions, and then serialized in Frederick Douglass’s Paper, The Heroic Slavehad a considerable readership at the time of its publication. As an indicationof its popularity, there was even a pirated edition, probably published in1853.36 [introfn.html#introfn_36] After that printing, there are just a fewreferences to the novella before 1975, when Philip S. Foner included it in theSupplement to his five-volume The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass(1950–75). In Frederick Douglass: The Colored Orator (1891), Frederick MayHolland commented briefly on The Heroic Slave: “Early in 1853 he [Douglass]published in his own paper a highly wrought story, which had already appeared in‘Autographs for Freedom,’ entitled ‘The Heroic Slave.’ It is based on actualadventures of Madison Washington, who set himself free by his own courage someten years earlier.” Presumably, these remarks would have inspired some admirersof Douglass’s writing to seek out his novella. Three decades later, The HeroicSlave made an odd appearance in Alain Locke’s The New Negro: An Interpretation(1925), an influential collection of essays on black art and culture publishedat the height of the Harlem Renaissance. The illustration accompanying WilliamStanley Braithwaite’s chapter, titled “The Negro in American Literature,”depicts the cover page of the pirated edition of The Heroic Slave (see figure 2[intro.html#fig2]). Over the course of his essay, Braithwaite refers toDouglass’s autobiographies but not The Heroic Slave, so the illustration offeredjust a tantalizing glimpse of a Douglass text that probably most readers of TheNew Negro knew nothing about. It wasn’t until Foner’s 1975 reprinting of thenovella that The Heroic Slave, over 120 years after its initial publication, wasagain widely disseminated.37 [introfn.html#introfn_37]images [../images/fxxxiv-01.jpg]2. Pirated edition of The Heroic Slave, from Alain Locke, The New Negro (1925).Widener Library, Harvard University.This cultural and critical edition of The Heroic Slave brings the novella to anew generation of readers. We begin with an authoritative text of The HeroicSlave, which corrects the errors in the first printing in Autographs for Freedomand draws on Douglass’s newspaper printing and the British edition of Autographsas well. In part 2 [part02.html#part02], we offer a representative selection ofcontemporary responses to the Creole rebellion, including newspaper reportage,depositions, and political writings. Many of these texts served as importantsources for Douglass, who spoke or wrote about Madison Washington a number oftimes from 1845 to 1861. Part 3 [part03.html#part03] collects virtuallyeverything Douglass had to say about the rebellion during that sixteen-yearperiod. Douglass wasn’t the only writer with an interest in the Creolerebellion. Part 4 [part04.html#part04] presents six narratives of the uprising,including several that have not been republished since their first appearance inthe nineteenth century. These narratives help us better understand what Douglasschose to emphasize and leave out in his own telling of the story. Storytellingis key to Robert B. Stepto’s 1982 discussion of The Heroic Slave, and thatessay, which initiated modern scholarship on Douglass’s novella, heads thecluster of criticism in part 5 [part05.html#part05] of the volume. Here criticsaddress gender, black nationalism, violence, and other important topics,including matters of literary form and artistry. As the selected bibliography atthe end of the volume indicates, The Heroic Slave has emerged as a major text inDouglass’s canon, a novella that continues to engage readers with its compellingvision of reform, black revolution, and the quest for human freedom."},{"pageContent":"1.

She has been dignified by some the mother ofstatesmen. History has not been sparing in recording their names, or inblazoning their deeds. Her high position in this respect, has given her anenviable distinction among her sister States. With Virginia for his birth-place,even a man of ordinary parts, on account of the general partiality for her sons,easily rises to eminent stations. Men, not great enough to attract specialattention in their native States, have, like a certain distinguished citizen inthe State of New York, sighed and repined that they were not born in Virginia.2[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_2] Yet not all the great ones of the Old Dominion have, bythe fact of their birth-place, escaped undeserved obscurity.3[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_3] By some strange neglect, one of the truest, manliest, andbravest of her children,—one who, in after years, will, I think, command the penof genius to set his merits forth, holds now no higher place in the records ofthat grand old Commonwealth than is held by a horse or an ox. Let those accountfor it who can, but there stands the fact, that a man who loved liberty as wellas did Patrick Henry,—who deserved it as much as Thomas Jefferson,—and whofought for it with a valor as high, an arm as strong, and against odds as great,as he who led all the armies of the American colonies through the great war forfreedom and independence, lives now only in the chattel records of his nativeState.4 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_4]Glimpses of this great character are all that can now be presented. He isbrought to view only by a few transient incidents, and these afford but partialsatisfaction. Like a guiding star on a stormy night, he is seen through theparted clouds and the howling tempests; or, like the gray peak of a menacingrock on a perilous coast, he is seen by the quivering flash of angry lightning,and he again disappears covered with mystery.Curiously, earnestly, anxiously we peer into the dark, and wish even for theblinding flash, or the light of northern skies to reveal him. But alas! he isstill enveloped in darkness, and we return from the pursuit like a wearied anddisheartened mother, (after a tedious and unsuccessful search for a lost child,)who returns weighed down with disappointment and sorrow. Speaking of marks,traces, possibles, and probabilities, we come before our readers.In the spring of 1835, on a Sabbath morning, within hearing of the solemn pealsof the church bells at a distant village, a Northern traveller through the Stateof Virginia drew up his horse to drink at a sparkling brook, near the edge of adark pine forest. While his weary and thirsty steed drew in the grateful water,the rider caught the sound of a human voice, apparently engaged in earnestconversation.Following the direction of the sound, he descried, among the tall pines, the manwhose voice had arrested his attention. “To whom can he be speaking?” thoughtthe traveller. “He seems to be alone.” The circumstance interested him much, andhe became intensely curious to know what thoughts and feelings, or, it might be,high aspirations, guided those rich and mellow accents. Tieing his horse at ashort distance from the brook, he stealthily drew near the solitary speaker;and, concealing himself by the side of a huge fallen tree, he distinctly heardthe following soliloquy:—“What, then, is life to me? it is aimless and worthless, and worse thanworthless. Those birds, perched on yon swinging boughs, in friendly conclave,sounding forth their merry notes in seeming worship of the rising sun, thoughliable to the sportsman’s fowling-piece, are still my superiors. They live free,though they may die slaves. They fly where they list by day, and retire infreedom at night. But what is freedom to me, or I to it? I am a slave,—born aslave, an abject slave,—even before I made part of this breathing world, thescourge was platted for my back; the fetters were forged for my limbs. How meana thing am I. That accursed and crawling snake, that miserable reptile, that hasjust glided into its slimy home, is freer and better off than I. He escaped myblow, and is safe. But here am I, a man,—yes, a man!—with thoughts and wishes,with powers and faculties as far as angel’s flight above that hated reptile,—yethe is my superior, and scorns to own me as his master, or to stop to take myblows. When he saw my uplifted arm, he darted beyond my reach, and turned togive me battle. I dare not do as much as that. I neither run nor fight, but domeanly stand, answering each heavy blow of a cruel master with doleful wails andpiteous cries. I am galled with irons; but even these are more tolerable thanthe consciousness, the galling consciousness of cowardice and indecision. Can itbe that I dare not run away? Perish the thought, I dare do any thing which maybe done by another. When that young man struggled with the waves for life, andothers stood back appalled in helpless horror, did I not plunge in, forgetful oflife, to save his? The raging bull from whom all others fled, pale with fright,did I not keep at bay with a single pitchfork? Could a coward do that? No,—no,—Iwrong myself,—I am no coward. Liberty I will have, or die in the attempt to gainit. This working that others may live in idleness! This cringing submission toinsolence and curses! This living under the constant dread and apprehension ofbeing sold and transferred, like a mere brute, is too much for me. I will standit no longer. What others have done, I will do. These trusty legs, or thesesinewy arms shall place me among the free. Tom escaped; so can I. The North Starwill not be less kind to me than to him.5 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_5] I will followit. I will at least make the trial. I have nothing to lose. If I am caught, Ishall only be a slave. If I am shot, I shall only lose a life which is a burdenand a curse. If I get clear, (as something tells me I shall,) liberty, theinalienable birth-right of every man, precious and priceless, will be mine. Myresolution is fixed. I shall be free.”At these words the traveller raised his head cautiously and noiselessly, andcaught, from his hiding-place, a full view of the unsuspecting speaker. Madison(for that was the name of our hero) was standing erect, a smile of satisfactionrippled upon his expressive countenance, like that which plays upon the face ofone who has but just solved a difficult problem, or vanquished a malignant foe;for at that moment he was free, at least in spirit. The future gleamed brightlybefore him, and his fetters lay broken at his feet. His air was triumphant.Madison was of manly form. Tall, symmetrical, round, and strong. In hismovements he seemed to combine, with the strength of the lion, the lion’selasticity. His torn sleeves disclosed arms like polished iron. His face was“black, but comely.”6 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_6] His eye, lit with emotion, keptguard under a brow as dark and as glossy as the raven’s wing. His wholeappearance betokened Herculean strength; yet there was nothing savage orforbidding in his aspect.7 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_7] A child might play in hisarms, or dance on his shoulders. A giant’s strength, but not a giant’s heart wasin him. His broad mouth and nose spoke only of good nature and kindness. But hisvoice, that unfailing index of the soul, though full and melodious, had that init which could terrify as well as charm. He was just the man you would choosewhen hardships were to be endured, or danger to be encountered,—intelligent andbrave. He had the head to conceive, and the hand to execute. In a word, he wasone to be sought as a friend, but to be dreaded as an enemy.As our traveller gazed upon him, he almost trembled at the thought of hisdangerous intrusion. Still he could not quit the place. He had long desired tosound the mysterious depths of the thoughts and feelings of a slave. He was not,therefore, disposed to allow so providential an opportunity to pass unimproved.He resolved to hear more; so he listened again for those mellow and mournfulaccents which, he says, made such an impression upon him as can never be erased.He did not have to wait long. There came another gush from the same fullfountain; now bitter, and now sweet. Scathing denunciations of the cruelty andinjustice of slavery; heart-touching narrations of his own personal suffering,intermingled with prayers to the God of the oppressed for help and deliverance,were followed by presentations of the dangers and difficulties of escape, andformed the burden of his eloquent utterances; but his high resolution clung tohim,—for he ended each speech by an emphatic declaration of his purpose to befree. It seemed that the very repetition of this, imparted a glow to hiscountenance. The hope of freedom seemed to sweeten, for a season, the bitter cupof slavery, and to make it, for a time, tolerable; for when in the verywhirlwind of anguish,—when his heart’s cord seemed screwed up to snappingtension, hope sprung up and soothed his troubled spirit. Fitfully he wouldexclaim, “How can I leave her? Poor thing! What can she do when I am gone? Oh!oh! ‘tis impossible that I can leave poor Susan!”8 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_8]A brief pause intervened. Our traveller raised his head, and saw again thesorrow-smitten slave. His eye was fixed upon the ground. The strong manstaggered under a heavy load. Recovering himself, he argued thus aloud: “All isuncertain here. To-morrow’s sun may not rise before I am sold, and separatedfrom her I love. What, then, could I do for her? I should be in more hopelessslavery, and she no nearer to liberty,—whereas if I were free,—my arms my own,—Imight devise the means to rescue her.”This said, Madison cast around a searching glance, as if the thought of beingoverheard had flashed across his mind. He said no more, but, with measuredsteps, walked away, and was lost to the eye of our traveller amidst thewildering woods.Long after Madison had left the ground, Mr. Listwell (our traveller) remained inmotionless silence, meditating on the extraordinary revelations to which he hadlistened. He seemed fastened to the spot, and stood half hoping, half fearingthe return of the sable preacher to his solitary temple. The speech of Madisonrung through the chambers of his soul, and vibrated through his entire frame.“Here is indeed a man,” thought he, “of rare endowments,—a child of God,—guiltyof no crime but the color of his skin,—hiding away from the face of humanity,and pouring out his thoughts and feelings, his hopes and resolutions to thelonely woods; to him those distant church bells have no grateful music. He shunsthe church, the altar, and the great congregation of christian worshippers, andwanders away to the gloomy forest, to utter in the vacant air complaints andgriefs, which the religion of his times and his country can neither console norrelieve. Goaded almost to madness by the sense of the injustice done him, heresorts hither to give vent to his pent up feelings, and to debate with himselfthe feasibility of plans, plans of his own invention, for his own deliverance.From this hour I am an abolitionist. I have seen enough and heard enough, and Ishall go to my home in Ohio resolved to atone for my past indifference to thisill-starred race, by making such exertions as I shall be able to do, for thespeedy emancipation of every slave in the land.”PART II.“The gaudy, blabbling and remorseful dayIs crept into the bosom of the sea;And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jadesThat drag the tragic melancholy night;Who with their drowsy, slow, and flagging wingsClip dead men’s graves, and from their misty jawsBreathe foul contagions, darkness in the air.”Shakspeare.9 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_9]FIVE years after the foregoing singular occurrence, in the winter of 1840, Mr.and Mrs. Listwell sat together by the fireside of their own happy home, in theState of Ohio. The children were all gone to bed. A single lamp burnt brightlyon the centre-table. All was still and comfortable within; but the night wascold and dark; a heavy wind sighed and moaned sorrowfully around the house andbarn, occasionally bringing against the clattering windows a stray leaf from thelarge oak trees that embowered their dwelling. It was a night for strange noisesand for strange fancies. A whole wilderness of thought might pass through one’smind during such an evening. The smouldering embers, partaking of the spirit ofthe restless night, became fruitful of varied and fantastic pictures, andrevived many bygone scenes and old impressions. The happy pair seemed to sit insilent fascination, gazing on the fire. Suddenly this reverie was interrupted bya heavy growl. Ordinarily such an occurrence would have scarcely provoked asingle word, or excited the least apprehension. But there are certain seasonswhen the slightest sound sends a jar through all the subtle chambers of themind; and such a season was this. The happy pair started up, as if some suddendanger had come upon them. The growl was from their trusty watch-dog.“What can it mean? certainly no one can be out on such a night as this,” saidMrs. Listwell.“The wind has deceived the dog, my dear; he has mistaken the noise of fallingbranches, brought down by the wind, for that of the footsteps of persons comingto the house. I have several times to-night thought that I heard the sound offootsteps. I am sure, however, that it was but the wind. Friends would not belikely to come out at such an hour, or such a night; and thieves are too lazyand self-indulgent to expose themselves to this biting frost; but should therebe any one about, our brave old Monte, who is on the lookout, will not be slowin sounding the alarm.”Saying this they quietly left the window, whither they had gone to learn thecause of the menacing growl, and re-seated themselves by the fire, as ifreluctant to leave the slowly expiring embers, although the hour was late. A fewminutes only intervened after resuming their seats, when again their sobermeditations were disturbed. Their faithful dog now growled and barked furiously,as if assailed by an advancing foe. Simultaneously the good couple arose, andstood in mute expectation. The contest without seemed fierce and violent. Itwas, however, soon over,—the barking ceased, for, with true canine instinct,Monte quickly discovered that a friend, not an enemy of the family, was comingto the house, and instead of rushing to repel the supposed intruder, he was nowat the door, whimpering and dancing for the admission of himself and his newlymade friend.Mr. Listwell knew by this movement that all was well; he advanced and opened thedoor, and saw by the light that streamed out into the darkness, a tall manadvancing slowly towards the house, with a stick in one hand, and a small bundlein the other. “It is a traveller,” thought he, “who has missed his way, and iscoming to inquire the road. I am glad we did not go to bed earlier,—I have feltall the evening as if somebody would be here to-night.”The man had now halted a short distance from the door, and looked prepared alikefor flight or battle. “Come in, sir, don’t be alarmed, you have probably lostyour way.”Slightly hesitating, the traveller walked in; not, however, without regardinghis host with a scrutinizing glance. “No, sir,” said he, “I have come to ask youa greater favor.”Instantly Mr. Listwell exclaimed, (as the recollection of the Virginia forestscene flashed upon him,) “Oh, sir, I know not your name, but I have seen yourface, and heard your voice before. I am glad to see you. I know all. You areflying for your liberty,—be seated,—be seated,—banish all fear. You are safeunder my roof.”This recognition, so unexpected, rather disconcerted and disquieted the noblefugitive. The timidity and suspicion of persons escaping from slavery are easilyawakened, and often what is intended to dispel the one, and to allay the other,has precisely the opposite effect. It was so in this case. Quickly observing theunhappy impression made by his words and action, Mr. Listwell assumed a morequiet and inquiring aspect, and finally succeeded in removing the apprehensionswhich his very natural and generous salutation had aroused.Thus assured, the stranger said, “Sir, you have rightly guessed, I am, indeed, afugitive from slavery. My name is Madison,—Madison Washington my mother used tocall me. I am on my way to Canada, where I learn that persons of my color areprotected in all the rights of men;10 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_10] and my object incalling upon you was, to beg the privilege of resting my weary limbs for thenight in your barn. It was my purpose to have continued my journey till morning;but the piercing cold, and the frowning darkness compelled me to seek shelter;and, seeing a light through the lattice of your window, I was encouraged to comehere to beg the privilege named. You will do me a great favor by affording meshelter for the night.”“A resting-place, indeed, sir, you shall have; not, however, in my barn, but inthe best room of my house. Consider yourself, if you please, under the roof of afriend; for such I am to you, and to all your deeply injured race.”While this introductory conversation was going on, the kind lady had revived thefire, and was diligently preparing supper; for she, not less than her husband,felt for the sorrows of the oppressed and hunted ones of the earth, and wasalways glad of an opportunity to do them a service. A bountiful repast wasquickly prepared, and the hungry and toil-worn bondman was cordially invited topartake thereof. Gratefully he acknowledged the favor of his benevolentbenefactress; but appeared scarcely to understand what such hospitality couldmean. It was the first time in his life that he had met so humane and friendly agreeting at the hands of persons whose color was unlike his own; yet it wasimpossible for him to doubt the charitableness of his new friends, or thegenuineness of the welcome so freely given; and he therefore, with many thanks,took his seat at the table with Mr. and Mrs. Listwell, who, desirous to make himfeel at home, took a cup of tea themselves, while urging upon Madison the bestthat the house could afford.Supper over, all doubts and apprehensions banished, the three drew around theblazing fire, and a conversation commenced which lasted till long aftermidnight.“Now,” said Madison to Mr. Listwell, “I was a little surprised and alarmed whenI came in, by what you said; do tell me, sir, why you thought you had seen myface before, and by what you knew me to be a fugitive from slavery; for I amsure that I never was before in this neighborhood, and I certainly sought toconceal what I supposed to be the manner of a fugitive slave.”Mr. Listwell at once frankly disclosed the secret; describing the place where hefirst saw him; rehearsing the language which he (Madison) had used; referring tothe effect which his manner and speech had made upon him; declaring theresolution he there formed to be an abolitionist; telling how often he hadspoken of the circumstance, and the deep concern he had ever since felt to knowwhat had become of him; and whether he had carried out the purpose to make hisescape, as in the woods he declared he would do.“Ever since that morning,” said Mr. Listwell, “you have seldom been absent frommy mind, and though now I did not dare to hope that I should ever see you again,I have often wished that such might be my fortune; for, from that hour, yourface seemed to be daguerreotyped on my memory.”11 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_11]Madison looked quite astonished, and felt amazed at the narration to which hehad listened. After recovering himself he said, “I well remember that morning,and the bitter anguish that wrung my heart; I will state the occasion of it. Ihad, on the previous Saturday, suffered a cruel lashing; had been tied up to thelimb of a tree, with my feet chained together, and a heavy iron bar placedbetween my ankles. Thus suspended, I received on my naked back forty stripes,and was kept in this distressing position three or four hours, and was then letdown, only to have my torture increased; for my bleeding back, gashed by thecow-skin, was washed by the overseer with old brine, partly to augment mysuffering, and partly, as he said, to prevent inflammation. My crime was that Ihad stayed longer at the mill, the day previous, than it was thought I ought tohave done, which, I assured my master and the overseer, was no fault of mine;but no excuses were allowed. ‘Hold your tongue, you impudent rascal,’ met myevery explanation. Slave-holders are so imperious when their passions areexcited, as to construe every word of the slave into insolence. I could donothing but submit to the agonizing infliction. Smarting still from the wounds,as well as from the consciousness of being whipt for no cause, I took advantageof the absence of my master, who had gone to church, to spend the time in thewoods, and brood over my wretched lot. Oh, sir, I remember it well,—and cannever forget it.”“But this was five years ago; where have you been since?”“I will try to tell you,” said Madison. “Just four weeks after that Sabbathmorning, I gathered up the few rags of clothing I had, and started, as Isupposed, for the North and for freedom. I must not stop to describe my feelingson taking this step. It seemed like taking a leap into the dark. The thought ofleaving my poor wife and two little children caused me indescribable anguish;but consoling myself with the reflection that once free, I could, possibly,devise ways and means to gain their freedom also, I nerved myself up to make theattempt.12 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_12] I started, but ill-luck attended me; forafter being out a whole week, strange to say, I still found myself on mymaster’s grounds; the third night after being out, a season of clouds and rainset in, wholly preventing me from seeing the North Star, which I had trusted asmy guide, not dreaming that clouds might intervene between us.“This circumstance was fatal to my project, for in losing my star, I lost myway; so when I supposed I was far towards the North, and had almost gained myfreedom, I discovered myself at the very point from which I had started. It wasa severe trial, for I arrived at home in great destitution; my feet were sore,and in travelling in the dark, I had dashed my foot against a stump, and starteda nail, and lamed myself. I was wet and cold; one week had exhausted all mystores; and when I landed on my master’s plantation, with all my work to do overagain,—hungry, tired, lame, and bewildered,—I almost cursed the day that I wasborn. In this extremity I approached the quarters. I did so stealthily, althoughin my desperation I hardly cared whether I was discovered or not. Peepingthrough the rents of the quarters, I saw my fellow-slaves seated by a warm fire,merrily passing away the time, as though their hearts knew no sorrow. Although Ienvied their seeming contentment, all wretched as I was, I despised the cowardlyacquiescence in their own degradation which it implied, and felt a kind of prideand glory in my own desperate lot. I dared not enter the quarters,—for wherethere is seeming contentment with slavery, there is certain treachery tofreedom. I proceeded towards the great house, in the hope of catching a glimpseof my poor wife, whom I knew might be trusted with my secrets even on thescaffold. Just as I reached the fence which divided the field from the garden, Isaw a woman in the yard, who in the darkness I took to be my wife; but a nearerapproach told me it was not she. I was about to speak; had I done so, I wouldnot have been here this night; for an alarm would have been sounded, and thehunters been put on my track. Here were hunger, cold, thirst, disappointment,and chagrin, confronted only by the dim hope of liberty. I tremble to think ofthat dreadful hour. To face the deadly cannon’s mouth in warm blood unterrified,is, I think, a small achievement, compared with a conflict like this with gauntstarvation. The gnawings of hunger conquers by degrees, till all that a man hashe would give in exchange for a single crust of bread. Thank God, I was notquite reduced to this extremity.“Happily for me, before the fatal moment of utter despair, my good wife made herappearance in the yard. It was she; I knew her step. All was well now. I was,however, afraid to speak lest I should frighten her. Yet speak I did; and, to mygreat joy, my voice was known. Our meeting can be more easily imagined thandescribed. For a time hunger, thirst, weariness, and lameness were forgotten.But it was soon necessary for her to return to the house. She being ahouse-servant, her absence from the kitchen, if discovered, might have excitedsuspicion. Our parting was like tearing the flesh from my bones; yet it was thepart of wisdom for her to go. She left me with the purpose of meeting me atmidnight in the very forest where you last saw me. She knew the place well, asone of my melancholy resorts, and could easily find it, though the night wasdark.“I hastened away, therefore, and concealed myself, to await the arrival of mygood angel. As I lay there among the leaves, I was strongly tempted to returnagain to the house of my master and give myself up; but remembering my solemnpledge on that memorable Sunday morning, I was able to linger out the two longhours between ten and midnight. I may well call them long hours. I have enduredmuch hardship; I have encountered many perils; but the anxiety of those twohours, was the bitterest I ever experienced. True to her word, my wife cameladen with provisions, and we sat down on the side of a log, at that dark andlonesome hour of the night. I cannot say we talked; our feelings were too greatfor that; yet we came to an understanding that I should make the woods my home,for if I gave myself up, I should be whipped and sold away; and if I started forthe North, I should leave a wife doubly dear to me. We mutually determined,therefore, that I should remain in the vicinity. In the dismal swamps I lived,sir, five long years,—a cave for my home during the day.13[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_13] I wandered about at night with the wolf and thebear,—sustained by the promise that my good Susan would meet me in the pinewoods at least once a week. This promise was redeemed, I assure you, to theletter, greatly to my relief. I had partly become contented with my mode oflife, and had made up my mind to spend my days there; but the wilderness thatsheltered me thus long took fire, and refused longer to be my hiding-place.“I will not harrow up your feelings by portraying the terrific scene of thisawful conflagration. There is nothing to which I can liken it. It was horriblyand indescribably grand. The whole world seemed on fire, and it appeared to methat the day of judgment had come; that the burning bowels of the earth hadburst forth, and that the end of all things was at hand. Bears and wolves,scorched from their mysterious hiding-places in the earth, and all the wildinhabitants of the untrodden forest, filled with a common dismay, ran forth,yelling, howling, bewildered amidst the smoke and flame. The very heavens seemedto rain down fire through the towering trees; it was by the merest chance that Iescaped the devouring element. Running before it, and stopping occasionally totake breath, I looked back to behold its frightful ravages, and to drink in itssavage magnificence. It was awful, thrilling, solemn, beyond compare. When aidedby the fitful wind, the merciless tempest of fire swept on, sparkling, creaking,cracking, curling, roaring, out-doing in its dreadful splendor a thousandthunderstorms at once. From tree to tree it leaped, swallowing them up in itslurid, baleful glare; and leaving them leafless, limbless, charred, and lifelessbehind. The scene was overwhelming, stunning,—nothing was spared,—cattle, tameand wild, herds of swine and of deer, wild beasts of every name and kind,—hugenight-birds, bats, and owls, that had retired to their homes in lofty tree-topsto rest, perished in that fiery storm. The long-winged buzzard and croakingraven mingled their dismal cries with those of the countless myriads of smallbirds that rose up to the skies, and were lost to the sight in clouds of smokeand flame. Oh, I shudder when I think of it! Many a poor wandering fugitive,who, like myself, had sought among wild beasts the mercy denied by our fellowmen, saw, in helpless consternation, his dwelling-place and city of refugereduced to ashes forever.14 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_14] It was this grandconflagration that drove me hither; I ran alike from fire and from slavery.”After a slight pause, (for both speaker and hearers were deeply moved by theabove recital,) Mr. Listwell, addressing Madison, said, “If it does not wearyyou too much, do tell us something of your journeyings since this disastrousburning,—we are deeply interested in everything which can throw light on thehardships of persons escaping from slavery; we could hear you talk all night;are there no incidents that you could relate of your travels hither? or are theysuch that you do not like to mention them?”“For the most part, sir, my course has been uninterrupted; and, considering thecircumstances, at times even pleasant. I have suffered little for want of food;but I need not tell you how I got it. Your moral code may differ from mine, asyour customs and usages are different. The fact is, sir, during my flight, Ifelt myself robbed by society of all my just rights; that I was in an enemy’sland, who sought both my life and my liberty. They had transformed me into abrute; made merchandise of my body, and, for all the purposes of my flight,turned day into night,—and guided by my own necessities, and in contempt oftheir conventionalities, I did not scruple to take bread where I could get it.”“And just there you were right,” said Mr. Listwell; “I once had doubts on thispoint myself, but a conversation with Gerrit Smith, (a man, by the way, that Iwish you could see, for he is a devoted friend of your race, and I know he wouldreceive you gladly,) put an end to all my doubts on this point. But do not letme interrupt you.”15 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_15]“I had but one narrow escape during my whole journey,” said Madison.“Do let us hear of it,” said Mr. Listwell.“Two weeks ago,” continued Madison, “after travelling all night, I was overtakenby daybreak, in what seemed to me an almost interminable wood. I deemed itunsafe to go farther, and, as usual, I looked around for a suitable tree inwhich to spend the day. I liked one with a bushy top, and found one just to mymind. Up I climbed, and hiding myself as well as I could, I, with this strap,(pulling one out of his old coat-pocket,) lashed myself to a bough, andflattered myself that I should get a good night’s sleep that day; but in this Iwas soon disappointed. I had scarcely got fastened to my natural hammock, when Iheard the voices of a number of persons, apparently approaching the part of thewoods where I was. Upon my word, sir, I dreaded more these human voices than Ishould have done those of wild beasts. I was at a loss to know what to do. If Idescended, I should probably be discovered by the men; and if they had dogs Ishould, doubtless, be ‘treed.’ It was an anxious moment, but hardships anddangers have been the accompaniments of my life; and have, perhaps, imparted tome a certain hardness of character, which, to some extent, adapts me to them. Inmy present predicament, I decided to hold my place in the tree-top, and abidethe consequences. But here I must disappoint you; for the men, who were allcolored, halted at least a hundred yards from me, and began with their axes, inright good earnest, to attack the trees. The sound of their laughing axes waslike the report of as many well-charged pistols. By and by there came down atleast a dozen trees with a terrible crash. They leaped upon the fallen treeswith an air of victory. I could see no dog with them, and felt myselfcomparatively safe, though I could not forget the possibility that some freak orfancy might bring the axe a little nearer my dwelling than comported with mysafety.“There was no sleep for me that day, and I wished for night. You may imaginethat the thought of having the tree attacked under me was far from agreeable,and that it very easily kept me on the look-out. The day was not withoutdiversion. The men at work seemed to be a gay set; and they would often make thewoods resound with that uncontrolled laughter for which we, as a race, areremarkable. I held my place in the tree till sunset,—saw the men put on theirjackets to be off. I observed that all left the ground except one, whom I sawsitting on the side of a stump, with his head bowed, and his eyes apparentlyfixed on the ground. I became interested in him. After sitting in the positionto which I have alluded ten or fifteen minutes, he left the stump, walkeddirectly towards the tree in which I was secreted, and halted almost under thesame. He stood for a moment and looked around, deliberately and reverently tookoff his hat, by which I saw that he was a man in the evening of life, slightlybald and quite gray. After laying down his hat carefully, he knelt and prayedaloud, and such a prayer, the most fervent, earnest, and solemn, to which Ithink I ever listened. After reverently addressing the Almighty, as theall-wise, all-good, and the common Father of all mankind, he besought God forgrace, for strength, to bear up under, and to endure, as a good soldier, all thehardships and trials which beset the journey of life, and to enable him to livein a manner which accorded with the gospel of Christ. His soul now broke out inhumble supplication for deliverance from bondage. ‘O thou,’ said he, ‘thathearest the raven’s cry,16 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_16] take pity on poor me! Odeliver me! O deliver me! in mercy, O God, deliver me from the chains andmanifold hardships of slavery! With thee, O Father, all things are possible.17[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_17] Thou canst stand and measure the earth. Thou hast beheldand drove asunder the nations,—all power is in thy hand,—thou didst say of old,“I have seen the affliction of my people, and am come to deliver them,”18[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_18]—‘Oh look down upon our afflictions, and have mercy uponus.’ But I cannot repeat his prayer, nor can I give you an idea of its deeppathos. I had given but little attention to religion, and had but little faithin it; yet, as the old man prayed, I felt almost like coming down and kneel byhis side, and mingle my broken complaint with his.“He had already gained my confidence; as how could it be otherwise? I knewenough of religion to know that the man who prays in secret is far more likelyto be sincere than he who loves to pray standing in the street, or in the greatcongregation. When he arose from his knees, like another Zacheus,19[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_19] I came down from the tree. He seemed a little alarmed atfirst, but I told him my story, and the good man embraced me in his arms, andassured me of his sympathy.“I was now about out of provisions, and thought I might safely ask him to helpme replenish my store. He said he had no money; but if he had, he would freelygive it me. I told him I had one dollar; it was all the money I had in theworld. I gave it to him, and asked him to purchase some crackers and cheese, andto kindly bring me the balance; that I would remain in or near that place, andwould come to him on his return, if he would whistle. He was gone only about anhour. Meanwhile, from some cause or other, I know not what, (but as you shallsee very wisely,) I changed my place. On his return I started to meet him; butit seemed as if the shadow of approaching danger fell upon my spirit, andchecked my progress. In a very few minutes, closely on the heels of the old man,I distinctly saw fourteen men, with something like guns in their hands.”“Oh! the old wretch!” exclaimed Mrs. Listwell, “he had betrayed you, had he?”“I think not,” said Madison, “I cannot believe that the old man was to blame. Heprobably went into a store, asked for the articles for which I sent, andpresented the bill I gave him; and it is so unusual for slaves in the country tohave money, that fact, doubtless, excited suspicion, and gave rise to inquiry. Ican easily believe that the truthfulness of the old man’s character compelledhim to disclose the facts; and thus were these blood-thirsty men put on mytrack. Of course I did not present myself; but hugged my hiding-place securely.If discovered and attacked, I resolved to sell my life as dearly as possible.“After searching about the woods silently for a time, the whole company gatheredaround the old man; one charged him with lying, and called him an old villain;said he was a thief; charged him with stealing money; said if he did notinstantly tell where he got it, they would take the shirt from his old back, andgive him thirty-nine lashes.“‘I did not steal the money,’ said the old man, ‘it was given me, as I told youat the store; and if the man who gave it me is not here, it is not my fault.’“‘Hush! you lying old rascal; we’ll make you smart for it. You shall not leavethis spot until you have told where you got that money.’“They now took hold of him, and began to strip him; while others went to getsticks with which to beat him. I felt, at the moment, like rushing out in themidst of them; but considering that the old man would be whipped the more forhaving aided a fugitive slave, and that, perhaps, in the melée20[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_20] he might be killed outright, I disobeyed this impulse.They tied him to a tree, and began to whip him. My own flesh crept at everyblow, and I seem to hear the old man’s piteous cries even now. They laidthirty-nine lashes on his bare back, and were going to repeat that number, whenone of the company besought his comrades to desist. ‘You’ll kill the d——d oldscoundrel! You’ve already whipt a dollar’s worth out of him, even if he stoleit!’ ‘O yes,’ said another, ‘let him down. He’ll never tell us another lie, I’llwarrant ye!’ With this, one of the company untied the old man, and bid him goabout his business.“The old man left, but the company remained as much as an hour, scouring thewoods. Round and round they went, turning up the underbrush, and peering aboutlike so many bloodhounds. Two or three times they came within six feet of whereI lay. I tell you I held my stick with a firmer grasp than I did in coming up toyour house to-night. I expected to level one of them at least. Fortunately,however, I eluded their pursuit, and they left me alone in the woods.“My last dollar was now gone, and you may well suppose I felt the loss of it;but the thought of being once again free to pursue my journey, prevented thatdepression which a sense of destitution causes; so swinging my little bundle onmy back, I caught a glimpse of the Great Bear (which ever points the way to mybeloved star,) and I started again on my journey.21 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_21] WhatI lost in money I made up at a hen-roost that same night, upon which Ifortunately came.”“But you did’nt eat your food raw? How did you cook it?” said Mrs. Listwell.“O no, Madam,” said Madison, turning to his little bundle;—”I had the means ofcooking.” Here he took out of his bundle an old-fashioned tinder-box, and takingup a piece of a file, which he brought with him, he struck it with a heavyflint, and brought out at least a dozen sparks at once. “I have had this oldbox,” said he, “more than five years. It is the only property saved from thefire in the dismal swamp. It has done me good service. It has given me the meansof broiling many a chicken!”It seemed quite a relief to Mrs. Listwell to know that Madison had, at least,lived upon cooked food. Women have a perfect horror of eating uncooked food.By this time thoughts of what was best to be done about getting Madison toCanada, began to trouble Mr. Listwell; for the laws of Ohio were very stringentagainst any one who should aid, or who were found aiding a slave to escapethrough that State.22 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_22] A citizen, for the simple act oftaking a fugitive slave in his carriage, had just been stripped of all hisproperty, and thrown penniless upon the world. Notwithstanding this, Mr.Listwell was determined to see Madison safely on his way to Canada. “Giveyourself no uneasiness,” said he to Madison, “for if it cost my farm, I shallsee you safely out of the States, and on your way to a land of liberty. ThankGod that there is such a land so near us! You will spend to-morrow with us, andto-morrow night I will take you in my carriage to the Lake.23[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_23] Once upon that, and you are safe.”“Thank you! thank you,” said the fugitive; “I will commit myself to your care.”For the first time during five years, Madison enjoyed the luxury of resting hislimbs on a comfortable bed, and inside a human habitation. Looking at the whitesheets, he said to Mr. Listwell, “What, sir! you don’t mean that I shall sleepin that bed?”“Oh yes, oh yes.”After Mr. Listwell left the room, Madison said he really hesitated whether ornot he should lie on the floor; for that was far more comfortable and invitingthan any bed to which he had been used.We pass over the thoughts and feelings, the hopes and fears, the plans andpurposes, that revolved in the mind of Madison during the day that he wassecreted at the house of Mr. Listwell. The reader will be content to know thatnothing occurred to endanger his liberty, or to excite alarm. Many were thelittle attentions bestowed upon him in his quiet retreat and hiding-place. Inthe evening, Mr. Listwell, after treating Madison to a new suit of winterclothes, and replenishing his exhausted purse with five dollars, all in silver,brought out his two-horse wagon, well provided with buffaloes, and silentlystarted off with him to Cleveland.24 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_24] They arrived therewithout interruption, a few minutes before sunrise the next morning. Fortunatelythe steamer Admiral lay at the wharf, and was to start for Canada at nineo’clock.25 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_25] Here the last anticipated danger wassurmounted. It was feared that just at this point the hunters of men might be onthe look-out, and, possibly, pounce upon their victim. Mr. Listwell saw thecaptain of the boat; cautiously sounded him on the matter of carryingliberty-loving passengers, before he introduced his precious charge. This done,Madison was conducted on board. With usual generosity this true subject of theemancipating queen26 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_26] welcomed Madison, and assured himthat he should be safely landed in Canada, free of charge. Madison now felthimself no more a piece of merchandise, but a passenger, and, like any otherpassenger, going about his business, carrying with him what belonged to him, andnothing which rightfully belonged to anybody else.Wrapped in his new winter suit, snug and comfortable, a pocket full of silver,safe from his pursuers, embarked for a free country, Madison gave every sign ofsincere gratitude, and bade his kind benefactor farewell, with such a grip ofthe hand as bespoke a heart full of honest manliness, and a soul that knew howto appreciate kindness. It need scarcely be said that Mr. Listwell was deeplymoved by the gratitude and friendship he had excited in a nature so noble asthat of the fugitive. He went to his home that day with a joy and gratificationwhich knew no bounds. He had done something “to deliver the spoiled out of thehands of the spoiler,”27 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_27] he had given bread to thehungry, and clothes to the naked;28 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_28] he had befriended aman to whom the laws of his country forbade all friendship,—and in proportion tothe odds against his righteous deed, was the delightful satisfaction thatgladdened his heart. On reaching home, he exclaimed, “He is safe,—he is safe,—heis safe,”—and the cup of his joy was shared by his excellent lady. The followingletter was received from Madison a few days after:“WINDSOR, CANADA WEST, DEC. 16, 1840.My dear Friend,—for such you truly are:—Madison is out of the woods at last; I nestle in the mane of the British lion,protected by his mighty paw from the talons and the beak of the Americaneagle.29 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_29] I AM FREE, and breathe an atmosphere too purefor slaves, slave-hunters, or slave-holders. My heart is full. As many thanks toyou, sir, and to your kind lady, as there are pebbles on the shores of LakeErie; and may the blessing of God rest upon you both. You will never beforgotten by your profoundly grateful friend,MADISON WASHINGTON.”PART III.—His head was with his heart,And that was far away!Childe Harold.30 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_30]JUST upon the edge of the great road from Petersburg, Virginia, to Richmond,31[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_31] and only about fifteen miles from the latter place,there stands a somewhat ancient and famous public tavern, quite notorious in itsbetter days, as being the grand resort for most of the leading gamblers,horse-racers, cock-fighters, and slave-traders from all the country round about.This old rookery, the nucleus of all sorts of birds, mostly those of ill omen,has, like everything else peculiar to Virginia, lost much of its ancientconsequence and splendor; yet it keeps up some appearance of gaiety and highlife, and is still frequented, even by respectable travellers, who areunacquainted with its past history and present condition.32[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_32] Its fine old portico looks well at a distance, and givesthe building an air of grandeur. A nearer view, however, does little to sustainthis pretension. The house is large, and its style imposing, but time anddissipation, unfailing in their results, have made ineffaceable marks upon it,and it must, in the common course of events, soon be numbered with the thingsthat were. The gloomy mantle of ruin is, already, out-spread to envelop it, andits remains, even but now remind one of a human skull, after the flesh hasmingled with the earth. Old hats and rags fill the places in the upper windowsonce occupied by large panes of glass, and the moulding boards along the roofinghave dropped off from their places, leaving holes and crevices in the rentedwall for bats and swallows to build their nests in. The platform of the portico,which fronts the highway is a rickety affair, its planks are loose, and in someplaces entirely gone, leaving effective man-traps in their stead for nocturnalramblers. The wooden pillars, which once supported it, but which now hang asencumbrances, are all rotten, and tremble with the touch. A part of the stable,a fine old structure in its day, which has given comfortable shelter to hundredsof the noblest steeds of “the Old Dominion” at once, was blown down many yearsago, and never has been, and probably never will be, rebuilt. The doors of thebarn are in wretched condition; they will shut with a little human strength tohelp their worn out hinges, but not otherwise. The side of the great buildingseen from the road is much discolored in sundry places by slops poured from theupper windows, rendering it unsightly and offensive in other respects. Three orfour great dogs, looking as dull and gloomy as the mansion itself, lie stretchedout along the door-sills under the portico; and double the number of loafers,some of them completely rum-ripe, and others ripening, dispose themselves likeso many sentinels about the front of the house. These latter understand thescience of scraping acquaintance to perfection. They know every-body, and almostevery-body knows them. Of course, as their title implies, they have no regularemployment. They are (to use an expressive phrase) hangers on, or still better,they are what sailors would denominate holders-on to the slack,33[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_33] in every-body’s mess, and in no-body’s watch. They are,however, as good as the newspaper for the events of the day, and they sell theirknowledge almost as cheap. Money they seldom have; yet they always have capitalthe most reliable. They make their way with a succeeding traveller byintelligence gained from a preceding one. All the great names of Virginia theyknow by heart, and have seen their owners often. The history of the house isfolded in their lips, and they rattle off stories in connection with it, equalto the guides at Dryburgh Abbey.34 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_34] He must be a shrewdman, and well skilled in the art of evasion, who gets out of the hands of thesefellows without being at the expense of a treat.It was at this old tavern, while on a second visit to the State of Virginia in1841, that Mr. Listwell, unacquainted with the fame of the place, turned aside,about sunset, to pass the night. Riding up to the house, he had scarcelydismounted, when one of the half dozen bar-room fraternity met and addressed himin a manner exceedingly bland and accommodating.“Fine evening, sir.”“Very fine,” said Mr. Listwell. “This is a tavern, I believe?”“O yes, sir, yes; although you may think it looks a little the worse for wear,it was once as good a house as any in Virginy. I make no doubt if ye spend thenight here, you’ll think it a good house yet; for there aint a moreaccommodating man in the country than you’ll find the landlord.”Listwell. “The most I want is a good bed for myself, and a full manger for myhorse. If I get these, I shall be quite satisfied.”Loafer. “Well, I alloys like to hear a gentleman talk for his horse; and justbecase the horse can’t talk for itself. A man that don’t care about his beast,and don’t look arter it when he’s travelling, aint much in my eye anyhow. Now,sir, I likes a horse, and I’ll guarantee your horse will be taken good care onhere. That old stable, for all you see it looks so shabby now, once shelteredthe great Eclipse, when he run here agin Batchelor and Jumping Jemmy.35[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_35] Them was fast horses, but he beat ’em both.”Listwell. “Indeed.”Loafer. “Well, I rather reckon you’ve travelled a right smart distance to-day,from the look of your horse?”Listwell. “Forty miles only.”Loafer. “Well! I’ll be darned if that aint a pretty good only. Mister, thatbeast of yours is a singed cat, I warrant you. I never see’d a creature likethat that was’nt good on the road. You’ve come about forty miles, then?”Listwell. “Yes, yes, and a pretty good pace at that.”Loafer. “You’re somewhat in a hurry, then, I make no doubt? I reckon I couldguess if I would, what you’re going to Richmond for? It would’nt be much of aguess either; for it’s rumored hereabouts, that there’s to be the greatest saleof niggers at Richmond to-morrow that has taken place there in a long time; andI’ll be bound you’re a going there to have a hand in it.”Listwell. “Why, you must think, then, that there’s money to be made at thatbusiness?”Loafer. “Well, ‘pon my honor, sir, I never made any that way myself; but itstands to reason that it’s a money making business; for almost all otherbusiness in Virginia is dropped to engage in this. One thing is sartain, I neversee’d a nigger-buyer yet that had’nt a plenty of money, and he was’nt as freewith it as water. I has known one on ’em to treat as high as twenty times in anight; and, ginerally speaking, they’s men of edication, and knows all about thegovernment. The fact is, sir, I alloys like to hear ’em talk, bekase I alloyscan learn something from them.”Listwell. “What may I call your name, sir?”Loafer. “Well, now, they calls me Wilkes. I’m known all around by the gentlementhat comes here. They all knows old Wilkes.”Listwell. “Well, Wilkes, you seem to be acquainted here, and I see you have astrong liking for a horse. Be so good as to speak a kind word for mine to thehostler to-night, and you’ll not lose anything by it.”Loafer. “Well, sir, I see you don’t say much, but you’ve got an insight intothings. It’s alloys wise to get the good will of them that’s acquainted about atavern; for a man don’t know when he goes into a house what may happen, or howmuch he may need a friend.” Here the loafer gave Mr. Listwell a significantgrin, which expressed a sort of triumphant pleasure at having, as he supposed,by his tact succeeded in placing so fine appearing a gentleman under obligationsto him.The pleasure, however, was mutual; for there was something so insinuating in theglance of this loquacious customer, that Mr. Listwell was very glad to get quitof him, and to do so more successfully, he ordered his supper to be brought tohim in his private room, private to the eye, but not to the ear. This room wasdirectly over the bar, and the plastering being off, nothing but pine boards andnaked laths separated him from the disagreeable company below,—he could easilyhear what was said in the bar-room, and was rather glad of the advantage itafforded, for, as you shall see, it furnished him important hints as to themanner and deportment he should assume during his stay at that tavern.Mr. Listwell says he had got into his room but a few moments, when he heard theofficious Wilkes below, in a tone of disappointment, exclaim, “Whar’s thatgentleman?” Wilkes was evidently expecting to meet with his friend at thebar-room, on his return, and had no doubt of his doing the handsome thing. “Hehas gone to his room,” answered the landlord, “and has ordered his supper to bebrought to him.”Here some one shouted out, “Who is he, Wilkes? Where’s he going?”“Well, now, I’ll be hanged if I know; but I’m willing to make any man a bet ofthis old hat agin a five dollar bill, that that gent is as full of money as adog is of fleas. He’s going down to Richmond to buy niggers, I make no doubt.He’s no fool, I warrant ye.”“Well, he acts d——d strange,” said another, “anyhow. I likes to see a man, whenhe comes up to a tavern, to come straight into the bar-room, and show that he’sa man among men. Nobody was going to bite him.”“Now, I don’t blame him a bit for not coming in here. That man knows hisbusiness, and means to take care on his money,” answered Wilkes.“Wilkes, you’re a fool. You only say that, becase you hope to get a few coppersout on him.”“You only measure my corn by your half-bushel, I won’t say that you’re only madbecase I got the chance of speaking to him first.”“O Wilkes! you’re known here. You’ll praise up any body that will give you acopper; besides, ‘tis my opinion that that fellow who took his long slab-sidesup stairs, for all the world just like a half-scared woman, afraid to lookhonest men in the face, is a Northerner, and as mean as dish-water.”“Now what will you bet of that,” said Wilkes.The speaker said, “I make no bets with you, ‘kase you can get that fellow upstairs there to say anything.”“Well,” said Wilkes, “I am willing to bet any man in the company that thatgentleman is a nigger-buyer. He did’nt tell me so right down, but I reckon Iknows enough about men to give a pretty clean guess as to what they are arter.”The dispute as to who Mr. Listwell was, what his business, where he was going,etc., was kept up with much animation for some time, and more than oncethreatened a serious disturbance of the peace. Wilkes had his friends as well ashis opponents. After this sharp debate, the company amused themselves bydrinking whiskey, and telling stories. The latter consisting of quarrels,fights, rencontres,36 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_36] and duels, in which distinguishedpersons of that neighborhood, and frequenters of that house, had been actors.Some of these stories were frightful enough, and were told, too, with a relishwhich bespoke the pleasure of the parties with the horrid scenes they portrayed.It would not be proper here to give the reader any idea of the vulgarity anddark profanity which rolled, as “a sweet morsel,”37 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_37]under these corrupt tongues. A more brutal set of creatures, perhaps, nevercongregated.Disgusted, and a little alarmed withal, Mr. Listwell, who was not accustomed tosuch entertainment, at length retired, but not to sleep. He was too much wroughtupon by what he had heard to rest quietly, and what snatches of sleep he got,were interrupted by dreams which were anything than pleasant. At eleven o’clock,there seemed to be several hundreds of persons crowding into the house. A loudand confused clamour, cursing and cracking of whips, and the noise of chainsstartled him from his bed; for a moment he would have given the half of his farmin Ohio to have been at home. This uproar was kept up with undulating course,till near morning. There was loud laughing,—loud singing,—loud cursing,—and yetthere seemed to be weeping and mourning in the midst of all. Mr. Listwell saidhe had heard enough during the forepart of the night to convince him that abuyer of men and women stood the best chance of being respected. And he,therefore, thought it best to say nothing which might undo the favorable opinionthat had been formed of him in the bar-room by at least one of the fraternitythat swarmed about it. While he would not avow himself a purchaser of slaves, hedeemed it not prudent to disavow it. He felt that he might, properly, refuse tocast such a pearl before parties which, to him, were worse than swine.38[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_38] To reveal himself, and to impart a knowledge of his realcharacter and sentiments would, to say the least, be imparting intelligence withthe certainty of seeing it and himself both abused. Mr. Listwell confesses, thatthis reasoning did not altogether satisfy his conscience, for, hating slavery ashe did, and regarding it to be the immediate duty of every man to cry outagainst it, “without compromise and without concealment,”39[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_39] it was hard for him to admit to himself the possibilityof circumstances wherein a man might, properly, hold his tongue on the subject.Having as little of the spirit of a martyr as Erasmus,40 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_40]he concluded, like the latter, that it was wiser to trust the mercy of God forhis soul, than the humanity of slave-traders for his body. Bodily fear, notconscientious scruples, prevailed.In this spirit he rose early in the morning, manifesting no surprise at what hehad heard during the night. His quondam41 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_41] friend wassoon at his elbow, boring him with all sorts of questions. All, however,directed to find out his character, business, residence, purposes, anddestination. With the most perfect appearance of good nature and carelessness,Mr. Listwell evaded these meddlesome inquiries, and turned conversation togeneral topics, leaving himself and all that specially pertained to him, out ofdiscussion. Disengaging himself from their troublesome companionship, he madehis way towards an old bowling-alley, which was connected with the house, andwhich, like all the rest, was in very bad repair.On reaching the alley Mr. Listwell saw, for the first time in his life, aslave-gang on their way to market. A sad sight truly. Here were one hundred andthirty human beings,—children of a common Creator—guilty of no crime—men andwomen, with hearts, minds, and deathless spirits, chained and fettered, andbound for the market, in a christian country,—in a country boasting of itsliberty, independence, and high civilization! Humanity converted intomerchandise, and linked in iron bands, with no regard to decency or humanity!All sizes, ages, and sexes, mothers, fathers, daughters, brothers, sisters,—allhuddled together, on their way to market to be sold and separated from home, andfrom each other forever. And all to fill the pockets of men too lazy to work foran honest living, and who gain their fortune by plundering the helpless, andtrafficking in the souls and sinews of men. As he gazed upon this revolting andheart-rending scene, our informant said he almost doubted the existence of a Godof justice! And he stood wondering that the earth did not open and swallow upsuch wickedness.In the midst of these reflections, and while running his eye up and down thefettered ranks, he met the glance of one whose face he thought he had seenbefore. To be resolved, he moved towards the spot. It was MADISON WASHINGTON!Here was a scene for the pencil! Had Mr. Listwell been confronted by one risenfrom the dead, he could not have been more appalled. He was completely stunned.A thunderbolt could not have struck him more dumb. He stood, for a few moments,as motionless as one petrified; collecting himself, he at length exclaimed,“Madison! is that you?”The noble fugitive, but little less astonished than himself, answered cheerily,“O yes, sir, they’ve got me again.”Thoughtless of consequences for the moment, Mr. Listwell ran up to his oldfriend, placing his hands upon his shoulders, and looked him in the face!Speechless they stood gazing at each other as if to be doubly resolved thatthere was no mistake about the matter, till Madison motioned his friend away,intimating a fear lest the keepers should find him there, and suspect him oftampering with the slaves.“They will soon be out to look after us. You can come when they go to breakfast,and I will tell you all.”Pleased with this arrangement, Mr. Listwell passed out of the alley; but onlyjust in time to save himself, for, while near the door, he observed three menmaking their way to the alley. The thought occurred to him to await theirarrival, as the best means of diverting the ever ready suspicions of the guilty.While the scene between Mr. Listwell and his friend Madison was going on, theother slaves stood as mute spectators,—at a loss to know what all this couldmean. As he left, he heard the man chained to Madison ask, “Who is thatgentleman?”“He is a friend of mine. I cannot tell you now. Suffice it to say he is afriend. You shall hear more of him before long, but mark me! whatever shall passbetween that gentleman and me, in your hearing, I pray you will say nothingabout it. We are all chained here together,—ours is a common lot; and thatgentleman is not less your friend than mine.” At these words, all mysterious asthey were, the unhappy company gave signs of satisfaction and hope. It seemsthat Madison, by that mesmeric power which is the invariable accompaniment ofgenius, had already won the confidence of the gang, and was a sort ofgeneral-in-chief among them.By this time the keepers arrived. A horrid trio, well fitted for theirdemoniacal work. Their uncombed hair came down over foreheads “villainouslylow,”42 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_42] and with eyes, mouths, and noses to match.“Hallo! hallo!” they growled out as they entered. “Are you all there?”“All here,” said Madison.“Well, well, that’s right! your journey will soon be over. You’ll be in Richmondby eleven to-day, and then you’ll have an easy time on it.”“I say, gal, what in the devil are you crying about?” said one of them. “I’llgive you something to cry about, if you don’t mind.” This was said to a girl,apparently not more than twelve years old, who had been weeping bitterly. Shehad, probably, left behind her a loving mother, affectionate sisters, brothers,and friends, and her tears were but the natural expression of her sorrow, andthe only solace. But the dealers in human flesh have no respect for such sorrow.They look upon it as a protest against their cruel injustice, and they areprompt to punish it.This is a puzzle not easily solved. How came he here? what can I do for him? mayI not even now be in some way compromised in this affair? were thoughts thattroubled Mr. Listwell, and made him eager for the promised opportunity ofspeaking to Madison.The bell now sounded for breakfast, and keepers and drivers, with pistols andbowie-knives gleaming from their belts, hurried in, as if to get the bestplaces. Taking the chance now afforded, Mr. Listwell hastened back to thebowling-alley. Reaching Madison, he said, “Now do tell me all about the matter.Do you know me?”“Oh, yes,” said Madison, “I know you well, and shall never forget you nor thatcold and dreary night you gave me shelter. I must be short,” he continued, “forthey’ll soon be out again. This, then, is the story in brief. On reachingCanada, and getting over the excitement of making my escape, sir, my thoughtsturned to my poor wife, who had well deserved my love by her virtuous fidelityand undying affection for me. I could not bear the thought of leaving her in thecruel jaws of slavery, without making an effort to rescue her. First, I tried toget money to buy her; but oh! the process was too slow. I despaired ofaccomplishing it. She was in all my thoughts by day, and my dreams by night. Attimes I could almost hear her voice, saying, ‘O Madison! Madison! will you thenleave me here? can you leave me here to die? No! no! you will come! you willcome!’ I was wretched. I lost my appetite. I could neither work, eat, nor sleep,till I resolved to hazard my own liberty, to gain that of my wife! But I must beshort. Six weeks ago I reached my old master’s place. I laid about theneighborhood nearly a week, watching my chance, and, finally, I ventured uponthe desperate attempt to reach my poor wife’s room by means of a ladder. Ireached the window, but the noise in raising it frightened my wife, and shescreamed and fainted. I took her in my arms, and was descending the ladder, whenthe dogs began to bark furiously, and before I could get to the woods the whitefolks were roused. The cool night air soon restored my wife, and she readilyrecognized me. We made the best of our way to the woods, but it was now toolate,—the dogs were after us as though they would have torn us to pieces. It wasall over with me now! My old master and his two sons ran out with loaded rifles,and before we were out of gunshot, our ears were assailed with ‘Stop! stop! orbe shot down.’ Nevertheless we ran on. Seeing that we gave no heed to theircalls, they fired, and my poor wife fell by my side dead, while I received but aslight flesh wound. I now became desperate, and stood my ground, and awaitedtheir attack over her dead body. They rushed upon me, with their rifles in hand.I parried their blows, and fought them ‘till I was knocked down andoverpowered.”“Oh! it was madness to have returned,” said Mr. Listwell.“Sir, I could not be free with the galling thought that my poor wife was still aslave. With her in slavery, my body, not my spirit, was free. I was taken to thehouse,—chained to a ring-bolt,—my wounds dressed. I was kept there three days.All the slaves, for miles around, were brought to see me. Many slave-holderscame with their slaves, using me as proof of the completeness of their power,and of the impossibility of slaves getting away. I was taunted, jeered at, andberated by them, in a manner that pierced me to the soul. Thank God, I was ableto smother my rage, and to bear it all with seeming composure. After my woundswere nearly healed, I was taken to a tree and stripped, and I received sixtylashes on my naked back. A few days after, I was sold to a slave-trader, andplaced in this gang for the New Orleans market.”43 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_43]“Do you think your master would sell you to me?”“O no, sir! I was sold on condition of my being taken South. Their motive isrevenge.”“Then, then,” said Mr. Listwell, “I fear I can do nothing for you. Put yourtrust in God, and bear your sad lot with the manly fortitude which becomes aman. I shall see you at Richmond, but don’t recognize me.” Saying this, Mr.Listwell handed Madison ten dollars; said a few words to the other slaves;received their hearty “God bless you,” and made his way to the house.Fearful of exciting suspicion by too long delay, our friend went to thebreakfast table, with the air of one who half reproved the greediness of thosewho rushed in at the sound of the bell. A cup of coffee was all that he couldmanage. His feelings were too bitter and excited, and his heart was too fullwith the fate of poor Madison (whom he loved as well as admired) to relish hisbreakfast; and although he sat long after the company had left the table, hereally did little more than change the position of his knife and fork. Thestrangeness of meeting again one whom he had met on two several occasionsbefore, under extraordinary circumstances, was well calculated to suggest theidea that a supernatural power, a wakeful providence, or an inexorable fate, hadlinked their destiny together; and that no efforts of his could disentangle himfrom the mysterious web of circumstances which enfolded him.On leaving the table, Mr. Listwell nerved himself up and walked firmly into thebar-room. He was at once greeted again by that talkative chatter-box, Mr.Wilkes.“Them’s a likely set of niggers in the alley there,” said Wilkes.“Yes, they’re fine looking fellows, one of them I should like to purchase, andfor him I would be willing to give a handsome sum.”Turning to one of his comrades, and with a grin of victory, Wilkes said, “Aha,Bill, did you hear that? I told you I know’d that gentleman wanted to buyniggers, and would bid as high as any purchaser in the market.”“Come, come,” said Listwell, “don’t be too loud in your praise, you are oldenough to know that prices rise when purchasers are plenty.”“That’s a fact,” said Wilkes, “I see you knows the ropes—and there’s not a manin old Virginy whom I’d rather help to make a good bargain than you, sir.”Mr. Listwell here threw a dollar at Wilkes, (which the latter caught with adexterous hand,) saying, “Take that for your kind good will.”Wilkes held up the dollar to his right eye, with a grin of victory, and turnedto the morose grumbler in the corner who had questioned the liberality of a manof whom he knew nothing.Mr. Listwell now stood as well with the company as any other occupant of thebar-room.We pass over the hurry and bustle, the brutal vociferations of the slave-driversin getting their unhappy gang in motion for Richmond; and we need not narrateevery application of the lash to those who faltered in the journey. Mr. Listwellfollowed the train at a long distance, with a sad heart; and on reachingRichmond, left his horse at a hotel, and made his way to the wharf in thedirection of which he saw the slave-coffle driven. He was just in time to seethe whole company embark for New Orleans. The thought struck him that, whilemixing with the multitude, he might do his friend Madison one last service, andhe stept into a hardware store and purchased three strong files. These he tookwith him, and standing near the small boat, which lay in waiting to bear thecompany by parcels to the side of the brig that lay in the stream, he managed,as Madison passed him, to slip the files into his pocket, and at once dartedback among the crowd.All the company now on board, the imperious voice of the captain sounded, andinstantly a dozen hardy seamen were in the rigging, hurrying aloft to unfurl thebroad canvas of our Baltimore built American Slaver.44 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_44]The sailors hung about the ropes, like so many black cats, now in theround-tops, now in the cross-trees, now on the yard-arms; all was bluster andactivity. Soon the broad fore topsail, the royal and top gallant sail werespread to the breeze. Round went the heavy windlass, clank, clank went thefall-bit,—the anchors weighed,—jibs, mainsails, and topsails hauled to the wind,and the long, low, black slaver, with her cargo of human flesh, careened andmoved forward to the sea.45 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_45]Mr. Listwell stood on the shore, and watched the slaver till the last speck ofher upper sails faded from sight, and announced the limit of human vision.“Farewell! farewell! brave and true man! God grant that brighter skies may smileupon your future than have yet looked down upon your thorny pathway.”Saying this to himself, our friend lost no time in completing his business, andin making his way homewards, gladly shaking off from his feet the dust of OldVirginia.PART IV.Oh, where’s the slave so lowlyCondemn’d to chains unholy,Who could he burstHis bonds at firstWould pine beneath them slowly?Moore.46 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_46] ———Know ye notWho would be free, themselves must strike the blow.Childe Harold.47 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_47]WHAT a world of inconsistency, as well as of wickedness, is suggested by thesmooth and gliding phrase, AMERICAN SLAVE TRADE; and how strange and perverse isthat moral sentiment which loathes, execrates, and brands as piracy and asdeserving of death the carrying away into captivity men, women, and childrenfrom the African coast; but which is neither shocked nor disturbed by a similartraffic, carried on with the same motives and purposes, and characterized byeven more odious peculiarities on the coast of our MODEL REPUBLIC. We execrateand hang the wretch guilty of this crime on the coast of Guinea,48[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_48] while we respect and applaud the guilty participators inthis murderous business on the enlightened shores of the Chesapeake. Theinconsistency is so flagrant and glaring, that it would seem to cast a doubt onthe doctrine of the innate moral sense of mankind.Just two months after the sailing of the Virginia slave brig, which the readerhas seen move off to sea so proudly with her human cargo for the New Orleansmarket, there chanced to meet, in the Marine Coffee-house at Richmond, a companyof ocean birds,49 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_49] when the following conversation, whichthrows some light on the subsequent history, not only of Madison Washington, butof the hundred and thirty human beings with whom we last saw him chained.“I say, shipmate, you had rather rough weather on your late passage to Orleans?”said Jack Williams, a regular old salt, tauntingly, to a trim, compact, manlylooking person, who proved to be the first mate of the slave brig in question.50[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_50]“Foul play, as well as foul weather,” replied the firmly knit personage,evidently but little inclined to enter upon a subject which terminated soingloriously to the captain and officers of the American slaver.“Well, betwixt you and me,” said Williams, “that whole affair on board of theCreole was miserably and disgracefully managed. Those black rascals got theupper hand of ye altogether; and, in my opinion, the whole disaster was theresult of ignorance of the real character of darkies in general.51[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_51] With half a dozen resolute white men, (I say it notboastingly,) I could have had the rascals in irons in ten minutes, not becauseI’m so strong, but I know how to manage ’em. With my back against the caboose,52[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_52] I could, myself, have flogged a dozen of them; and had Ibeen on board, by every monster of the deep, every black devil of ’em all wouldhave had his neck stretched from the yard-arm. Ye made a mistake in yer mannerof fighting ’em. All that is needed in dealing with a set of rebellious darkies,is to show that yer not afraid of ’em. For my own part, I would not honor adozen niggers by pointing a gun at one on ’em,—a good stout whip, or a stiffrope’s end, is better than all the guns at Old Point53 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_53]to quell a nigger insurrection. Why, sir, to take a gun to a nigger is the bestway you can select to tell him you are afraid of him, and the best way ofinviting his attack.”This speech made quite a sensation among the company, and a part of themindicated solicitude for the answer which might be made to it. Our first matereplied, “Mr. Williams, all that you’ve now said sounds very well here on shore,where, perhaps, you have studied negro character. I do not profess to understandthe subject as well as yourself; but it strikes me, you apply the same rule indissimilar cases. It is quite easy to talk of flogging niggers here on land,where you have the sympathy of the community, and the whole physical force ofthe government, State and national, at your command; and where, if a negro shalllift his hand against a white man, the whole community, with one accord, areready to unite in shooting him down. I say, in such circumstances, it’s easy totalk of flogging negroes and of negro cowardice; but, sir, I deny that the negrois, naturally, a coward, or that your theory of managing slaves will stand thetest of salt water. It may do very well for an overseer, a contemptiblehireling, to take advantage of fears already in existence, and which hispresence has no power to inspire; to swagger about whip in hand, and discourseon the timidity and cowardice of negroes; for they have a smooth sea and a fairwind. It is one thing to manage a company of slaves on a Virginia plantation,and quite another thing to quell an insurrection on the lonely billows of theAtlantic, where every breeze speaks of courage and liberty. For the negro to actcowardly on shore, may be to act wisely; and I’ve some doubts whether you, Mr.Williams, would find it very convenient were you a slave in Algiers, to raiseyour hand against the bayonets of a whole government.”“By George, shipmate,” said Williams, “you’re coming rather too near. EitherI’ve fallen very low in your estimation, or your notions of negro courage havegot up a button-hole too high. Now I more than ever wish I’d been on board ofthat luckless craft. I’d have given ye practical evidence of the truth of mytheory. I don’t doubt there’s some difference in being at sea. But a nigger’s anigger, on sea or land; and is a coward, find him where you will; a drop ofblood from one on ’em will skeer a hundred. A knock on the nose, or a kick onthe shin, will tame the wildest ‘darkey’ you can fetch me. I say again, and willstand by it, I could, with half a dozen good men, put the whole nineteen on ’emin irons, and have carried them safe to New Orleans too.54[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_54] Mind, I don’t blame you, but I do say, and everygentleman here will bear me out in it, that the fault was somewhere, or themniggers would never have got off as they have done. For my part I[part01.html#part01] feel ashamed to have the idea go abroad, that a ship loadof slaves can’t be safely taken from Richmond to New Orleans. I should like,merely to redeem the character of Virginia sailors, to take charge of a shipload on ’em to-morrow.”Williams went on in this strain, occasionally casting an imploring glance at thecompany for applause for his wit, and sympathy for his contempt of negrocourage. He had, evidently, however, waked up the wrong passenger; for besidesbeing in the right, his opponent carried that in his eye which marked him a mannot to be trifled with.“Well, sir,” said the sturdy mate, “you can select your own method fordistinguishing yourself;—the path of ambition in this direction is quite open toyou in Virginia, and I’ve no doubt that you will be highly appreciated andcompensated for all your valiant achievements in that line; but for myself,while I do not profess to be a giant, I have resolved never to set my foot onthe deck of a slave ship, either as officer, or common sailor again; I have gotenough of it.”“Indeed! indeed!” exclaimed Williams, derisively.“Yes, indeed,” echoed the mate; “but don’t misunderstand me. It is not the highvalue that I set upon my life that makes me say what I have said; yet I’mresolved never to endanger my life again in a cause which my conscience does notapprove. I dare say here what many men feel, but dare not speak, that this wholeslave-trading business is a disgrace and scandal to Old Virginia.”“Hold! hold on! shipmate,” said Williams, “I hardly thought you’d have shownyour colors so soon,—I’ll be hanged if you’re not as good an abolitionist asGarrison himself.”55 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_55]The mate now rose from his chair, manifesting some excitement. “What do youmean, sir,” said he, in a commanding tone. “That man does not live who shalloffer me an insult with impunity.”The effect of these words was marked; and the company clustered around.Williams, in an apologetic tone, said, “Shipmate! keep your temper. I mean’t noinsult. We all know that Tom Grant is no coward, and what I said about yourbeing an abolitionist was simply this: you might have put down them blackmutineers and murderers, but your conscience held you back.”“In that, too,” said Grant, “you were mistaken. I did all that any man withequal strength and presence of mind could have done. The fact is, Mr. Williams,you underrate the courage as well as the skill of these negroes, and further,you do not seem to have been correctly informed about the case in hand at all.”“All I know about it is,” said Williams, “that on the ninth day after you leftRichmond, a dozen or two of the niggers ye had on board, came on deck and tookthe ship from you;—had her steered into a British port, where, by the by, everywooly head of them went ashore and was free. Now I take this to be adiscreditable piece of business, and one demanding explanation.”“There are a great many discreditable things in the world,” said Grant. “For aship to go down under a calm sky is, upon the first flush of it, disgracefuleither to sailors or caulkers.56 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_56] But when we learn, thatby some mysterious disturbance in nature, the waters parted beneath, andswallowed the ship up, we lose our indignation and disgust in lamentation of thedisaster, and in awe of the Power which controls the elements.”“Very true, very true,” said Williams, “I should be very glad to have anexplanation which would relieve the affair of its present discreditablefeatures. I have desired to see you ever since you got home, and to learn fromyou a full statement of the facts in the case. To me the whole thing seemsunaccountable. I cannot see how a dozen or two of ignorant negroes, not one ofwhom had ever been to sea before, and all of them were closely ironed betweendecks, should be able to get their fetters off, rush out of the hatchway in opendaylight, kill two white men, the one the captain and the other their master,and then carry the ship into a British port, where every ‘darkey’ of them wasset free. There must have been great carelessness, or cowardice somewhere!”The company which had listened in silence during most of this discussion, nowbecame much excited. One said, I agree with Williams; and several said the thinglooks black enough. After the temporary tumultuous exclamations had subsided,—“I see,” said Grant, “how you regard this case, and how difficult it will be forme to render our ship’s company blameless in your eyes. Nevertheless, I willstate the facts precisely as they came under my own observation. Mr. Williamsspeaks of ‘ignorant negroes,’ and, as a general rule, they are ignorant; but hadhe been on board the Creole as I was, he would have seen cause to admit thatthere are exceptions to this general rule. The leader of the mutiny in questionwas just as shrewd a fellow as ever I met in my life, and was as well fitted tolead in a dangerous enterprise as any one white man in ten thousand. The name ofthis man, strange to say, (ominous of greatness,) was MADISON WASHINGTON. In theshort time he had been on board, he had secured the confidence of every officer.The negroes fairly worshipped him. His manner and bearing were such, that no onecould suspect him of a murderous purpose. The only feeling with which weregarded him was, that he was a powerful, good-disposed negro. He seldom spaketo any one, and when he did speak, it was with the utmost propriety. His wordswere well chosen, and his pronunciation equal to that of any schoolmaster. Itwas a mystery to us where he got his knowledge of language; but as little wassaid to him, none of us knew the extent of his intelligence and ability till itwas too late. It seems he brought three files with him on board, and must havegone to work upon his fetters the first night out; and he must have worked wellat that; for on the day of the rising, he got the irons off eighteen besideshimself.“The attack began just about twilight in the evening. Apprehending a squall, Ihad commanded the second mate to order all hands on deck, to take in sail. A fewminutes before this I had seen Madison’s head above the hatchway, looking outupon the white-capped waves at the leeward. I think I never saw him look moregood-natured. I stood just about midship, on the larboard side. The captain waspacing the quarter-deck on the starboard side, in company with Mr. Jameson, theowner of most of the slaves on board.57 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_57] Both were armed.I had just told the men to lay aloft, and was looking to see my orders obeyed,when I heard the discharge of a pistol on the starboard side; and turningsuddenly around, the very deck seemed covered with fiends from the pit. Thenineteen negroes were all on deck, with their broken fetters in their hands,rushing in all directions. I put my hand quickly in my pocket to draw out myjack-knife; but before I could draw it, I was knocked senseless to the deck.When I came to myself, (which I did in a few minutes, I suppose, for it was yetquite light,) there was not a white man on deck. The sailors were all aloft inthe rigging, and dared not come down. Captain Clarke and Mr. Jameson laystretched on the quarter-deck,—both dying,—while Madison himself stood at thehelm unhurt.58 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_58]“I was completely weakened by the loss of blood, and had not recovered from thestunning blow which felled me to the deck; but it was a little too much for me,even in my prostrate condition, to see our good brig commanded by a blackmurderer. So I called out to the men to come down and take the ship, or die inthe attempt. Suiting the action to the word, I started aft. You murderousvillain, said I, to the imp at the helm, and rushed upon him to deal him a blow,when he pushed me back with his strong, black arm, as though I had been a boy oftwelve. I looked around for the men. They were still in the rigging. Not one hadcome down. I started towards Madison again. The rascal now told me to standback. ‘Sir,’ said he, ‘your life is in my hands. I could have killed you a dozentimes over during this last half hour, and could kill you now. You call me ablack murderer. I am not a murderer. God is my witness that LIBERTY, not malice,is the motive for this night’s work. I have done no more to those dead menyonder, than they would have done to me in like circumstances. We have struckfor our freedom, and if a true man’s heart be in you, you will honor us for thedeed. We have done that which you applaud your fathers for doing, and if we aremurderers, so were they.’“I felt little disposition to reply to this impudent speech. By heaven, itdisarmed me. The fellow loomed up before me. I forgot his blackness in thedignity of his manner, and the eloquence of his speech. It seemed as if thesouls of both the great dead (whose names he bore) had entered him. To thesailors in the rigging he said: ‘Men! the battle is over,—your captain is dead.I have complete command of this vessel. All resistance to my authority will bein vain. My men have won their liberty, with no other weapons but their ownBROKEN FETTERS. We are nineteen in number. We do not thirst for your blood, wedemand only our rightful freedom. Do not flatter yourselves that I am ignorantof chart or compass. I know both. We are now only about sixty miles fromNassau.59 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_59] Come down, and do your duty. Land us inNassau, and not a hair of your heads shall be hurt.’“I shouted, Stay where you are, men,—when a sturdy black fellow ran at me with ahandspike, and would have split my head open, but for the interference ofMadison, who darted between me and the blow. ‘I know what you are up to,’ saidthe latter to me. ‘You want to navigate this brig into a slave port, where youwould have us all hanged; but you’ll miss it; before this brig shall touch aslave-cursed shore while I am on board, I will myself put a match to themagazine, and blow her, and be blown with her, into a thousand fragments. Now Ihave saved your life twice within these last twenty minutes,—for, when you layhelpless on deck, my men were about to kill you. I held them in check. And ifyou now (seeing I am your friend and not your enemy) persist in your resistanceto my authority, I give you fair warning YOU SHALL DIE.’“Saying this to me, he cast a glance into the rigging where the terror-strickensailors were clinging, like so many frightened monkeys, and commanded them tocome down, in a tone from which there was no appeal; for four men stood by withmuskets in hand, ready at the word of command to shoot them down.“I now became satisfied that resistance was out of the question; that my bestpolicy was to put the brig into Nassau, and secure the assistance of theAmerican consul at that port. I felt sure that the authorities would enable usto secure the murderers, and bring them to trial.“By this time the apprehended squall had burst upon us. The wind howledfuriously,—the ocean was white with foam, which, on account of the darkness, wecould see only by the quick flashes of lightning that darted occasionally fromthe angry sky. All was alarm and confusion. Hideous cries came up from the slavewomen. Above the roaring billows a succession of heavy thunder rolled along,swelling the terrific din. Owing to the great darkness, and a sudden shift ofthe wind, we found ourselves in the trough of the sea. When shipping a heavy seaover the starboard bow, the bodies of the captain and Mr. Jameson were washedoverboard. For awhile we had dearer interests to look after than slave property.A more savage thunder-gust never swept the ocean. Our brig rolled and creaked asif every bolt would be started, and every thread of oakum would be pressed outof the seams. To the pumps! to the pumps! I cried, but not a sailor would quithis grasp. Fortunately this squall soon passed over, or we must have been foodfor sharks.“During all the storm, Madison stood firmly at the helm,—his keen eye fixed uponthe binnacle.60 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_60] He was not indifferent to the dreadfulhurricane; yet he met it with the equanimity of an old sailor. He was silent butnot agitated. The first words he uttered after the storm had slightly subsided,were characteristic of the man. ‘Mr. Mate, you cannot write the bloody laws ofslavery on those restless billows. The ocean, if not the land, is free.’ Iconfess, gentlemen, I felt myself in the presence of a superior man; one who,had he been a white man, I would have followed willingly and gladly in anyhonorable enterprise. Our difference of color was the only ground for differenceof action. It was not that his principles were wrong in the abstract; for theyare the principles of 1776.61 [ch01fn.html#ch01fn_61] But I could not bringmyself to recognize their application to one whom I deemed my inferior.“But to my story. What happened now is soon told. Two hours after the frightfultempest had spent itself, we were plump at the wharf in Nassau. I sent two ofour men immediately to our consul with a statement of facts, requesting hisinterference in our behalf. What he did, or whither he did anything, I don’tknow; but, by order of the authorities, a company of black soldiers came onboard, for the purpose, as they said, of protecting the property.62[ch01fn.html#ch01fn_62] These impudent rascals, when I called on them to assistme in keeping the slaves on board, sheltered themselves adroitly under theirinstructions only to protect property,—and said they did not recognize personsas property. I told them that by the laws of Virginia and the laws of the UnitedStates, the slaves on board were as much property as the barrels of flour in thehold. At this the stupid blockheads showed their ivory, rolled up their whiteeyes in horror, as if the idea of putting men on a footing with merchandise wererevolting to their humanity. When these instructions were understood among thenegroes, it was impossible for us to keep them on board. They deliberatelygathered up their baggage before our eyes, and, against our remonstrances,poured through the gangway,—formed themselves into a procession on thewharf,—bid farewell to all on board, and, uttering the wildest shouts ofexultation, they marched, amidst the deafening cheers of a multitude ofsympathizing spectators, under the triumphant leadership of their heroic chiefand deliverer, MADISON WASHINGTON.”images [../images/f0052-01.jpg]3.

He helped recruit Douglass into the lecturing ranks of the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society, and in 1845 he published Douglass’s Narrative.

While a few other editions of Douglass’snovella have been reprinted in modern times, none of their texts of The HeroicSlave have been guided by the principles of textual editing. Other editions havereproduced an electronic facsimile or have reset the text of one of the work’sthree earliest printings. Such an “uncritical” preparation of a text overlooksthe corruptions of the author’s intentions by contemporary copy editors,compositors, or bookbinders. It also ignores any “authoritative” corrections orrevisions that Douglass might have instructed for later printings of his work.Instead, our goal for this edition is to recover and reproduce a text thataccurately reflects Douglass’s intentions for The Heroic Slave.The first step in our work on The Heroic Slave was to discover as much aspossible about its publication history. Our research uncovered three potentiallyauthoritative texts for the novella: the first edition of Autographs forFreedom, published in late December 1852 (copyrighted 1853) by the Boston firmof John P. Jewett; the second, printed serially in Frederick Douglass’ Paper on4, 11, 18, and 25 March 1853; and the third, a British edition of Autographs forFreedom, published by the London firm of Low, Son & Company and John Casselllater in the spring of 1853.images [../images/f0054-01.jpg]4. The Heroic Slave, in Frederick Douglass’ Paper, 4 March 1853. WidenerLibrary, Harvard University.Based on our critical reading and the collation of potentially authoritativetexts of The Heroic Slave, and on an analysis of external evidence, the editorsselected the Boston edition of Autographs for Freedom as the copy-text to becritically edited. The present text was reproduced as carefully as possible fromits original published source, and then checked against the two subsequentversions. The editors strove to preserve the distinctive features, dubbed“accidentals” by textual scholars, of the work that Douglass intended to makeavailable to his readers, so the original spelling, punctuation, capitalization,paragraphing, and other distinctive stylistic usages are reproduced here,although the possibility exists that many such features were introduced by acopy editor or compositor. The editors then compared or collated these threetexts and compiled a list of variations in the texts.Since the editors’ goal was to provide the text of The Heroic Slave as Douglassintended it for his 1853 readers, we made only twenty-seven alterations, oremendations, to the original Boston-published Autographs for Freedom text. Mostwere intended to correct errors made by the original compositors and were basedon intensive study of the subsequent two authoritative texts of the novella. Asmaller number of our emendations are what textual editors call “substantives”:changes of capitalization, punctuation, or spelling to correct grammaticalerrors that, the editors believe, Douglass could not have intended, because theyproduce confusion or provide misinformation. Where possible, Douglass’s usageelsewhere in the novella or his other contemporary writings guided suchemendations.

The Creole rebellion got lessattention than the one on the Amistad because the rebels escaped to the BritishBahamas and thus were not available for newspaper interviews or other forms ofpublicity. Still, there was considerable interest in the case. The Creole was anAmerican slaver, after all, and southerners were disturbed by the specter ofblack revolt (and the loss of human property), while antislavery northerners sawin both the Amistad and the Creole rebellions clear indications of blacks’desire for freedom. Because the British refused to return the slaves to slavery,the rebellion exacerbated tensions between Britain and the United States duringthe time that President John Tyler’s secretary of state, Daniel Webster, wasnegotiating the North American boundary issues central to the Webster-AshburtonTreaty, eventually signed in August 1842. Additionally, the rebellion and itsaftermath added to existing tensions among northern and southern politiciansabout the role that the federal government should play in protecting the rightsof slave owners.This section presents contemporary newspaper, diplomatic, and politicalresponses to the Creole rebellion. The emphasis is on those texts that Douglassread or clearly knew about. Douglass followed all aspects of the case. He was anavid reader of William Lloyd Garrison’s antislavery newspaper, the Liberator,and of African American newspapers; five of the ten selections in this sectioncome from antislavery newspapers, including Garrison’s reprinting of the whitecrew’s deposition about the case, known as the “Protest,” which first appearedin a New Orleans newspaper. In addition, this section reprints an excerpt fromanother formal deposition by the white officers and seamen, printed as a U.S.Senate document, and three texts that focus on the diplomatic and politicalimplications of the case, including Daniel Webster’s widely disseminated letterabout the Creole rebellion (which Douglass regularly attacked in his speechesabout the uprising). The concluding selection, from Henry Highland Garnet’s“Address to the Slaves of the United States,” points to the symbolic importancethat the Creole would come to assume for nineteenth-century African Americansinspired by the histories and legacies of black rebellion against the slavepower."},{"pageContent":"“ANOTHER AMISTAD CASE—WHAT WILL GROW OUT OF IT?”News of the 7 November 1841 revolt on the Creole initially came from the 8December 1841 issue of the New Orleans Advertiser, which published the lengthydeposition—known as the “Protest”—that white officers and seamen gave to a NewOrleans notary shortly after the Creole arrived in New Orleans on 2 December1841. Southern newspapers summarized or reprinted the “Protest” as part of acampaign to compel the British to return the slaves to their owners. Northernantislavery newspapers printed the “Protest” with the very different aim ofcelebrating the black slaves for their heroic actions. (See the Liberator’sversion below.) Drawing on the “Protest,” on 23 December 1845 the NationalAnti-Slavery Standard published an article, “An American Cinquez,” that directlylinked the Creole rebellion to the Amistad slave rebellion of 1839, led byJoseph Cinqué. Two days later, the Colored American, based in New York City andthe leading African American newspaper of the time, published “Another AmistadCase,” which also drew on the “Protest.” The text here is taken from the 25December 1841 issue of the Colored American.It appears that on the 27th of Oct., the brig Creole left Richmond, Va.,1[ch03fn.html#ch03fn_1] with 135 slaves, for New Orleans, where they were to besold—that on the night of the 7th of November, a large number of the slavesarose, killed their owner, or the man who had them in charge, and one otherpassenger,2 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_2] seriously wounded the captain and mate, whoboth fled to the rigging, and finally succeeded in taking full charge of thevessel. The next morning they called the captain and mate down from the rigging,who obeyed; when the mate gave himself up to them, one of the colored men put apistol to his breast and promised to spare him only on condition that he wouldtake them to an English Island, who promised to do so, and accordingly took thevessel to Nassau, New Providence.3 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_3] Upon arriving atNassau, nineteen of the slaves were recognized as among the revolters, and weredetained in temporary durance by the Governor,4 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_4] whorefused, however, to send them to the United States; the remainder of them wereset at liberty, as on English soil slaves cannot breathe.5[ch03fn.html#ch03fn_5] A vessel being about to embark for Jamaica, withemigrants, many of them took passage in her; the rest are employed at Nassau.Another paper states that four women and one small boy came to New Orleans inthe Creole,—very foolish women. One or two of the colored men died from woundsreceived in the affray on board.6 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_6] It is evident theseslaves prepared themselves for the battle before they left Richmond, else whenceall their implements of war.Now here is another Amistad case,7 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_7] a very exciting onetoo, and more trouble in the camp between this country and England. This countrywill demand them to be given up, at least the slaveholders will. England willnot listen for one moment in the case of the 114, most of whom have gone toJamaica. They are safe—she never will at all surrender one of them up. Of the 19detained as revolters, England may pause a moment, as to whether to give them upor not, she may, and she may not. Our Supreme Court has just given them aprecedent in the Africans of the Amistad, she may follow so illustrious anexample.8 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_8] But this country has adopted other precedents,in refusing to deliver up her mail robbers, and her murderers, who had takenrefuge under our government from Canada.9 [ch03fn.html#ch03fn_9] England willnever do for us, what we have in like circumstance refused to do for them,especially in the case of men fighting to deliver themselves from chattelslavery. The Southern papers are already in a great rage about this case; weadvise then to keep cool, not to be too wrathy, they may be glad yet to backout. John Bull won’t be frightened. We advise old Virginia to be careful how sheships her slaves to the South.

By printing the pieces together in the 25 December 1841 issue oftheir newspaper, the source of the text below, the editors of the ColoredAmerican provided their readers with the story of the Creole from the time ofthe rebellion at sea to the immediate aftermath in Nassau.The New Orleans Advertiser of the 8th1 [ch04fn.html#ch04fn_1] contains theProtest of the Officers and crew of the brig Creole against the “winds andwaves, and the dangers of the sea generally, but more especially against theinsurrection of the nineteen slaves, and the illegal action of the Britishauthorities at Nassau in regard to the remainder of the slaves on board saidvessel.” The protest recounts all the particulars of the mutiny, which, as wehave already given, we shall not repeat. Only nineteen of the slaves had anypart in the mutiny; the rest were afraid of them and remained forward of themainmast.The occurrences after reaching Nassau have not been so generally published. Theofficer, Gifford,2 [ch04fn.html#ch04fn_2] called upon the Governor of theBahamas who, at his request, sent a guard of twenty-four negro soldiers on theship to keep the slaves and cargo on board. Capt. Fitzgeralt, who commanded thetroops, told the slaves that they were very foolish in not killing all thewhites on board.On the 10th of November, three magistrates came on board and examined all thewhite persons. The vessel was surrounded by boats filled with men armed withclubs. The nineteen were taken into custody, and the Attorney General3[ch04fn.html#ch04fn_3] said to the others, “My friends, you have been detained ashort time on board the Creole for the purpose of ascertaining the individualswho were concerned in this mutiny and murder. They have been identified and willbe detained, the rest of you are free and at liberty to go on shore and whereyou please.”Then addressing the prisoners, he said, “Men, there are nineteen of you who havebeen identified as having been engaged in the murder of Mr. Hewell, and in anattempt to kill the captain and others. You will be detained and lodged inprison for a time, in order that we may communicate with the English Government,and ascertain whether your trial shall take place here or elsewhere.”Mr. Gifford, the officer in command, protested against allowing the armed boatsto come alongside and the slaves to go ashore. The Attorney General, in reply,told him that he had better make no objection, for if he did there might bebloodshed. He then stepped into his boat with one of the magistrates andwithdrew into the stream. At a signal from another magistrate on board theCreole, the armed boats came along side and the slaves on board got into them.Three cheers were given and the boats went ashore, where thousands were waitingto receive them. The mutineers were taken ashore in a barge.On the 15th, the Attorney General wrote to the Captain of the Creole4[ch04fn.html#ch04fn_4] demanding the baggage of the passengers. Gifford, thecommanding officer, replied that the slaves being themselves property had nobaggage, and that moreover, he could land nothing without a permit from theCustom House and an order from the American Consul5 [ch04fn.html#ch04fn_5]—theAttorney got the permit, but not the order, and put an officer on board theCreole who took away such baggage and property as he chose to consider asbelonging to the slaves. The master of the Creole made no resistance.The next day the Captain of the Creole proposed to sell his surplus provisionsto pay his expenses. The collector of the Customs refused to allow them to belanded unless the Captain would enter the slaves as passengers. This wasrefused.A plan was formed by the American Consul, with Capt. Woodside of the Americanvessel Louisa, to rescue the Creole from the British officer and take her toIndian Key6 [ch04fn.html#ch04fn_6] where was a U.S. vessel of war.“Accordingly,” says the Protest, “on the morning of the 12th of November,Captain Woodside, with his men in a boat, rowed to the Creole. Muskets andcutlasses were obtained from the brig Congress. Every effort had been made, inconcert with the Consul, to purchase arms of the dealers at Nassau, but they allrefused to sell. The arms were wrapped in the American flag and concealed in thebottom of the boat, as said boat approached the Creole. A negro, who had watchedthe loading of the boat, followed her, and gave the alarm to the British officeron the Creole. As the boat came up to the Creole, the officer called to them,‘Keep off, or I will fire into you.’ His company of twenty-four men were thenall standing on deck and drawn up in a line fronting Captain Woodside’s boat,and were ready with loaded muskets and fixed bayonets for an engagement. CaptainWoodside was forced to withdraw, and the plan was prevented from being executed,the said British officer remaining in command of the Creole. The officers andcrew of the Louisa and Congress, and the American Consul were warmly interestedin the plan, and everything possible was done for its success.”On the day the slaves were liberated, the American Consul requested of theGovernor a guard to protect the vessel until he could write to the Florida coastand put her in charge of a United States ship of war. This was refused. He thenasked a guard until the crews of the American ships then in port could becollected and put on board the Creole, to take her to New Orleans. This was alsorefused. A proposition was then finally made to the Governor, that the Americanseamen then in port and in American vessels should go on board the Creole and befurnished with arms by the Governor to defend the vessel and cargo, (except thenineteen slaves who were to be left behind,) on her voyage to New Orleans. Thisalso the Governor refused. On the 13th the Consul on behalf of the master of thebrig Creole and all interested, proposed to the Governor to permit the nineteenmutineers to be sent to the United States on board the Creole for trial; andthis too was refused."},{"pageContent":"1.

P., where the authorities confined nineteenof the mutineers, and forcibly liberated nearly all the slaves.In August 1841, Frederick Douglass became a paid lecturer for William LloydGarrison’s Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, and he would have initiallyfollowed reports about the Creole rebellion in Garrison’s antislavery newspaper,the Liberator. In late December, Garrison reprinted the “Protest,” which hadfirst appeared in the 8 December 1841 issue of the New-Orleans Advertiser. The“Protest”—a deposition offered by five of the white officers and seamen of theCreole to a New Orleans notary public—was meant to underscore the barbarity ofthe black rebels and to make the case for reparations from the British (and forcompensation from the ship’s insurers). But for antislavery leaders likeGarrison and Douglass, what came across most forcefully in the whites’ accountof the rebellion was the blacks’ heroic quest for freedom. In the longer,complete version of the “Protest,” the white deponents voice their frustrationwith the British and discuss their failed efforts, once in Nassau, to regaincontrol of the Creole. This opening section, taken from the 31 December 1841issue of the Liberator, offers a dramatic account of the uprising itself and ofMadison Washington’s role as leader.By this public instrument of protest be it known that, on the second day ofDecember, eighteen hundred and forty one; before me, William Young Lewis, notarypublic in and for the city of New-Orleans, duly commissioned and sworn:Personally came and appeared Zephaniah C. Gifford, acting master of the Americanbrig called the Creole, of Richmond, who declared that the said vessel sailedfrom the port of Norfolk, in the state of Virginia, on the thirteenth day ofOctober last past, laden with manufactured tobacco in boxes and slaves, thenunder command of Captain Robert Ensor, bound for the port of New-Orleans, in theState of Louisiana.That when about 130 miles to the North Northeast of the Hole-in-the-Wall,1[ch05fn.html#ch05fn_1] the slaves, or part thereof on board said vessel, rose onthe officers, crew and passengers, killed one passenger, severely wounded thecaptain, this appearer,2 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_2] and a part of the crew;compelled said appearer, then first mate, to navigate said vessel to Nassau, inthe Island of New-Providence, where she arrived, and a portion of theringleaders of said insurrection were confined in prison, and the remainder ofsaid slaves liberated by the British authorities of said Island: and requiredme, notary, to make record of the same, intending more at leisure to detailparticulars.And this day again appeared the said acting master, together with LuciusStevens, acting mate; William Devereux, cook and steward; Henry Speck, JohnSilvy, Jaques Lecomte, Francis Foxwell, and Blair Curtiss, seamen—all of, andbelonging to said vessel, who, being severally sworn according to law, todeclare the truth, did depose and say—That said vessel started as aforesaid, she was tight and strong, well manned,and provided in every respect, and equipped for carrying slaves:That said vessel left Richmond on the 25th day of October, 1841, with about 102slaves on board:That about 90 of said slaves were shipped on board on the 20th of said month, ofwhich 41 were shipped by Robert Lumkin, about 39 by John R. Hewell, 9 byNathaniel Matthews, and 1 by Wm. Robinson; that from that time, about one of twoper day were put on board by John R. Hewell, until about the said 25th day ofOctober, so as to make the whole number of 135 slaves.The men and women slaves were divided. The men were all placed in the forwardhold of the brig, except old Lewis and servant of Mr. Thomas McCargo, who staidin the cabin, as assistant servant, and the women in the hold aft, except sixfemale servants, who were taken in the cabin. Between them was the cargo of thebrig, consisting of boxes of tobacco.The slaves were permitted to go on deck, but the men were not allowed at nightto go in the hold aft where the women were.On the 30th of October, the brig left Hampton Roads for New-Orleans.3[ch05fn.html#ch05fn_3] The slaves were all under the superintendence of WilliamHenry Merritt, a passenger. John R. Hewell had the particular charge of theslaves of Thomas McCargo—Theophilus McCargo being considered too young andinexperienced4 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_4]—and the general charge of the otherslaves, all being under the master of the vessel. The slaves were all carefullywatched. They were perfectly obedient and quiet, and showed no signs of mutinyand disturbance, until Sunday, the 7th of Nov. about 9 P.M. in lat. 27, 46, N.lon. 75 20 W.The captain, supposing that they were nearer Abaco than they were, had orderedthe brig to be laid to, which was done. A good breeze was blowing at the time,and the sky was a little hazy, with trade clouds flying.Mr. Gifford was on watch. He was told by Elijah Morris,5 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_5]one of the slaves of Thomas McCargo, that one of the men had gone aft among thewomen. Mr. Gifford then called Mr. Merritt, who was in the cabin, and informedhim of the fact. Mr. Merritt came up and went to the main hatch, which was theentrance to the after hold, and asked two or three of the slaves who were near,if any of the men were down in that hold, and he was informed that they were.Mr. Merritt then waited until Mr. Gifford procured a match, and then Mr. Merrittwent down in the hold and lighted it. Mr. Gifford stood over the hatchway. Onstriking a light, Merritt found Madison Washington, a very large and strongslave of Thomas McCargo, standing at his back. Merritt said to Madison, ‘Is itpossible that you are down here? You are the last man on board the brig Iexpected to find here.’ Madison replied, ‘Yes, sir, it is me,’ and instantlyjumped to the hatchway, and got on deck, saying, ‘I am going up, I cannot stayhere.’ He did this in spite of the resistance of Gifford and Merritt, who bothtried to keep him back, and laid hold of him for that purpose.Madison ran forward, and Elijah Morris fired a pistol, the ball of which grazedthe back part of Gifford’s head. Madison then shouted, ‘We have begun, and mustgo through. Rush, boys, rush aft, and we have them!’ and calling to the slavesbelow, he said—’Come up, every one of you! If you don’t lend a hand, I will killyou all, and throw you overboard.’Gifford now ran to the cabin, and aroused the Captain and others who wereasleep, and the passangers, viz:—Theophilus McCargo, Jacob Miller,6[ch05fn.html#ch05fn_6] John R. Hewell; the second mate Lucius Stevens; thesteward Wm. Devereux, a free colored man; and the slave Lewis, belonging to Mr.T. McCargo, acting as assistant steward.7 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_7] The slavesrushed aft, and surrounded the cabin. Merritt, hearing the report of the pistol,blew out his light and came from the hold. In doing this, he was caught by oneof the negroes, who cried out, ‘Kill him! he is one of them;’ and the otherslaves immediately rushed upon him. One of them attempted to strike Merritt witha handspike;8 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_8] but missed him, and knocked down the negrowho was holding Merritt. Merritt then escaped to the cabin.Hewell, at this moment, jumped out of his berth, in his drawers, seized amusket, ran to the companion way of the cabin, and after some struggling fired.The negroes instantly wrenched the musket from Hewell’s hands. Hewell thenseized a handspike, and defended himself from the slaves who pursued him. Theythought he had another musket, and retreated a little. He advanced, and theyfell upon him with clubs, handspikes and knives. He was knocked down and stabbedin not less than twenty places; but he rose, got away from them, and staggeredback to the cabin, exclaiming, ‘I am dead—the negroes have killed me!’It is believed that no more than four or five of the negroes had knives. BenBlacksmith,9 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_9] had the bowie knife he wrested from thecaptain, and stabbed Hewell with it. Madison had a jack knife, which appeared tohave been taken from Hewell. Morris had a sheath knife, which he had taken fromthe forecastle, and which belonged to Henry Speck.10 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_10]Gifford, after arousing the persons in the cabin, ran on deck, and up themain-rigging to the main-top. Merritt tried to get through the sky-light of thecabin, but could not, without being discovered. The negroes crowded around thesky-light outside, and the door of the cabin. Merritt then hid himself in one ofthe berths, and three of the female house servants covered him with blankets,and sat on the edge of the berth, crying and praying. Theophilus McCargo dressedhimself on the alarm being given. Hewell, after being wounded, staggered intosaid McCargo’s state-room, where he fell and expired in about half an hour. Hisbody was thrown overboard by order of Madison, Ben Blacksmith and Elijah Morris.McCargo got his two pistols out, and fired one of them at the negroes, then inthe cabin; the other missed fire, and McCargo having no ammunition, put hispistols away. After the affray, the sheath-knife of Henry Speck was found inElijah Morris’s possession, and that of Foxwell in the possession of anothernegro, both covered with blood to the handles.Jacob Miller, William Devereux and the slave Lewis, on the alarm being given,concealed themselves in one of the state rooms. Elijah Morris called all whowere concealed in the cabin to come forward, or they should have instant death.Miller came out first and said—’Here I am, do what you please.’ Devereux andLewis next came out, and begged for their lives. Madison stood at the door, andordered them to be sent to the hold. Stevens got up on the alarm being given andran out. Saw Hewell in the affray, and waited in the cabin till Hewell died, andthen secreted himself in one of the state rooms, and when they commenced thesearch for Merritt, made his escape through the cabin. They forced the musketthey had reloaded, struck at him with knives and handspikes, and chased him intothe rigging. He escaped to the fore-yard.On the alarm being given, the captain called all hands to get up and fight.Henry Speck, one of the crew, was knocked down with a handspike. The helmsmanwas a Frenchman.11 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_11] Elijah Morris and Pompey Garrison12[ch05fn.html#ch05fn_12] were going to kill him, when Madison told them theyshould not kill him, because he was a Frenchman, and could not speak English; sothey spared his life. Blair Curtis, one of the crew, came aft into the cabin andconcealed himself in the state room with Stevens, and escaped with him to thefore royal yard.The captain fought with his bowie knife along-side of Hewell. The captain wasengaged in the fight from eight to ten minutes, until the negroes got him down,in the starboard scuppers.13 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_13] He then made his escape tothe maintop, being stabbed in several places, and much bruised with blows fromsticks of wood found about the brig. After the captain got into the maintop, hefainted from the loss of blood, and Gifford fastened him with the rigging toprevent him from falling, as the vessel was then rolling heavily.The captain’s wife, her child and niece, then came and begged for their lives,14[ch05fn.html#ch05fn_14] and Ben Blacksmith sent them to the hold. Ben thencalled out for Merritt, and exclaimed that all who had secreted him should bekilled. The two female servants then left the berth where Merritt was concealed,and were sent down to the hold by Ben. Jim and Lewis, negroes, belonging toThomas McCargo, then ran to Theophilus McCargo, who asked Jim if the others weregoing to kill him. Jim and Lewis exclaimed that ‘master, HE should not bekilled,’ and clung around him, begging Morris and Ben, who were then close withtheir knives in their hands, not to kill him. They consented, and ordered him tobe taken to the hold. Jim and Lewis went voluntarily with Theophilus McCargo tothe hold.After a great deal of search, Merritt was found, and Ben Blacksmith and Elijahdragged him from his berth. They and several others surrounded him with knives,half handspikes, muskets and pistols, raised their weapons to kill him, and maderoom for him to fall.On his representing that he had been the mate of a vessel, that he was the onlyperson who could navigate for them, and on Mary, a woman servant belonging toMcCargo, urging said Madison Washington to interfere, Madison ordered them tostop and allow Merritt to have a conversation with him. This took place in astate room.Madison said he wanted to go to Liberia.15 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_15] Merrittrepresented that they had not water and provisions for that voyage. BenBlacksmith, D. Ruffin16 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_16] and several of the slaves thensaid that they wanted to go to the British Islands. They did not want to go anywhere else but where Mr. Lumpkin’s negroes went last year, alluding to theshipwreck of schooner Hermosa on Abaco, and the taking of the slaves on boardthat vessel, by the English wreckers, to Nassau, in the Island ofNew-Providence.17 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_17]Merritt then got his chart and explained to them the route, and read to them theCoast Pilot,18 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_18] and they agreed that if he would navigatethem, they would save his life—otherwise death would be his portion. PompeyGarrison had been to New Orleans and knew the route. D. Ruffin and GeorgePortlock19 [ch05fn.html#ch05fn_19] knew the letters of the compass. They thenset Merritt free, and demanded the time of night, which was half past oneo’clock, A.M. by Merritt’s watch. The vessel was then put in Merritt’s charge.20[ch05fn.html#ch05fn_20]The nineteen slaves confined at Nassau, are the only slaves who took any part inthe affray.

In the 7 January 1842 issue of theLiberator (the source of the text below), he published an account of therebellion that had first appeared, in a slightly different form, in December1841 issues of the New York Evangelist and the New York Journal of Commerce.In publishing the Protest of the officers and crew of the Creole, we have wishedto place an important providential event in such a manner before our readers, asto enable them to give it the most thorough consideration. Like the death ofLovejoy1 [ch06fn.html#ch06fn_1] and the case of the Amistad captives, it forms apart of that train of high providences by which God is developing to this nationthe nature of slavery—its deleterious influence, and the absolute necessity ofits abolition. The Protest is from the officers and crew of the Creole, givenbefore a Notary Public, in New-Orleans, and cannot be supposed to represent intoo favorable colors the conduct of the mutineers. We hope every reader of theEvangelist will give it a thorough perusal.We read it with surprise and admiration. Whether we consider the force andpresence of mind displayed, the clemency exercised, the unsleeping vigilancemaintained, or the sublime reliance on the justice of their cause, as theyapproached Nassau, we confess that we can think of nothing in the long range ofhistory which gives a nobler impression.Of the 135 slaves confined in the hold, only 19 appear to have taken any activepart in the revolt. Of these 19, four appear to have been the chief agents.2[ch06fn.html#ch06fn_2] Of these, one who wore a name unfit for a slave, butfinely expressive for a hero, seems to have been the master spirit—that name wasMadison Washington! By the way, we have always thought it a singular, nay, adangerous practice, to confer such emphatic names upon men in bondage.It does not appear whether the mutineers had previously digested their plan, ornot. If they had, they betrayed remarkable fidelity and efficiency in bringingit to an issue. If not, the leaders, and especially Madison Washington,manifested astonishing presence of mind and decision of character, in hismovement. His reply to Merritt, when found in the hold where the women werekept—his escape to the deck, in spite of the united resistance of Merritt andGifford—his commanding attitude and daring orders, when he stood a freeman onthe slaver’s deck, and his perfect preparation for the grand alternative ofliberty or death, which stood before him, are splendid exemplifications of thetrue heroic.3 [ch06fn.html#ch06fn_3]His generous leniency towards his prisoners, his oppressors—men who werecarrying him and 134 others, from a condition of slavery already intolerable, toone which threatened still more galling chains, is another remarkable feature.He spared the life of the poor Frenchman,4 [ch06fn.html#ch06fn_4] because hecould not speak English, and the captain’s life, at the entreaty of his wife andchildren. He dressed the wounds of the poor sailors who had fought against him;he spared the life of Merritt and also of young Theophilus McCargo;5[ch06fn.html#ch06fn_5] and when he had command of the cabin, invited the whitesto partake of its refreshments. All his movements show that malice and revengeformed no part of his motives.Yet this leniency was accompanied with the most vigorous and efficient measures.How nobly he seems, when making Merritt pledge, at the mouth of the musket, atone o’clock at night, to navigate the vessel to New Providence; when commandingthe captain and Merritt to have no communication; when placing the sailors onduty at their usual posts, and subjecting them to the same necessary restrictionof non-intercourse; when pacing the deck with his three brave associates untilmorning, with his knife drawn, and his eye upon every spot where the leastdanger could arise! To heighten the moral grandeur of the scene, remember thathe did not know how many of the remaining slaves might side against him; andeven feared he should have to quell an insurrection against the new authority.The 19 consulted together, kept their counsels to themselves—and, so far as wecan learn, exercised complete self-control over their passions, and maintaineduninterrupted harmony of purpose and action.But nothing in the whole affair appears so sublimely affecting as their conducton arriving at Nassau. They divested themselves of all their arms, even castingthem into the sea, and came before the British authorities defenceless—confidingin the justice of their cause, and in the protection of free and righteousinstitutions against the claims of their oppressors! Noble men! Here was nosense of guilt, no meanness, no deception. They only wished to say emphatically,what they did; that they only sought to obtain their freedom. This act of theirsis a splendid tribute to the British Government, and is a brighter gem in thediadem of her sovereign, than the victory of any battle field. It was confidencein law, sustained by power, and founded on unquestionable justice. Take italtogether, it was morally magnificent. The liberty which saluted them onlanding, by the triumphant shouts of thousands that welcomed them, must havebeen a glorious reward to these men for their brave and perilous achievement.In these remarks, our readers will perceive that we have done little more thanto translate, in the appropriate language of freedom, the statements of theProtest, written by their enemies. The case before us is important, however, aswe suggested at first, on account of its providential relations to the greatquestion of abolition. It differs from that of the Amistad captives in one grandpoint, viz: that these by law were slaves, while those were not.6[ch06fn.html#ch06fn_6] The public at large, and the supreme voice of immutablelaw, pronounced the Mendians innocent, nay, extolled their conduct. The publicis now called upon to decide upon another case, divided from that of theMendians only by the narrow line of a law, in its nature confessedly unjust, andabominable to every intelligent freeman.The claim of property in their flesh and bones and souls, asserted byslaveholding law, was not, could not have been binding on the slaves themselves.There are only two grand reasons which render it the duty of men, in anycircumstances, to submit to the enforcement of such an ignominious claim onthemselves and their offspring. One is the hope of obtaining deliverance bypatient waiting, and the other is the impossibility of obtaining it byinsurrection. These two reasons rest over the condition of our Southern slavesat large, and sustain the true abolition doctrine of doing nothing to encourage,but every thing to discourage insurrection.But these reasons in the case of the Creole slaves, had vanished. Before them,there was a splendid prospect, by valorous resistance, of immediate andperpetual liberty. Again we repeat it, the restraining reasons had vanished, andboth law and gospel justified their rising.Admitting the truth of these positions, (and they will be sustained by the voiceof the American public, and of British law,) the institution of slavery willstand out before our people in the most appalling aspect. We do not wish to pushthe subject too far, at present. But we wish to enquire, whether, if GreatBritain refuses to give up these ‘murderers,’ the American people are preparedto enforce the demand against her? We wish to enquire if our readers havereflected on that portion of the Report of the Secretary of the Navy, whichpoints out the danger of our Southern coast in case of war with Great Britain,arising from the existence of slavery?7 [ch06fn.html#ch06fn_7] We wish ourreaders would reflect on these possibilities, and thus discern how great anational risk we run, by the direful bearings of this detestable institution,entrenched in the protection of a system of government, by nature perfectlyaverse to it.We suggest these reflections, in order to show the reader the necessity of usingevery possible means to bring about voluntary emancipation. By all the love wehave for the American Union—by all the respect we cherish for the principles ofuniversal law—by all the horror we entertain of war between two such governmentsas those of Great Britain and the United States, and by the dread with which weregard the spirit of insurrection, as well as by all the immense systems ofinterests, embossed in the destinies of three millions of slaves, and all theintermingled relations of the church of God, we beseech, as if all these werebeseeching, that our readers will universally realize the necessity of the mostkind, wise, urgent and immediate exertions, to accomplish their cheerful andvoluntary emancipation. We have no time to lose. The voice of Providence speakssternly against our delay. If we have arguments, let us set them all in order;if we have tears, let us bid them flow; if we have eloquence, let us consecrateit to the service; if we have philosophy, let us learn to discern anddiscriminate on this subject; and if we have religion, let us send up continualprayer before God, that he will overrule all this matter in tender mercy, andbring us to a happy issue of justice, freedom and perpetual union."},{"pageContent":"1.

MERRITTWhen the Creole arrived at the British colony of Nassau, Bahamas, MadisonWashington and his fellow rebels were initially jailed by British authorities.But the British refused to return the slaves to the Creole’s white officers (andeventually freed Washington and his compatriots), thus setting off a diplomaticincident. To make the case for the return of the slaves, the white officers,sailors, and slave traders told their stories in November 1841 to the New Yorklawyer and diplomat John F. Bacon (1789–1862), who at the time was U.S. consulin Nassau. From the point of view of Bacon and other U.S officials, the blackswere murderous rebels who should be returned to their white owners, butantislavery people who read the same depositions tended to regard the blacks asresourceful, freedom loving, and compassionate.

The deposition of the slave trader William H. Merritt, whosejob on the Creole was to oversee the slaves, is of particular interest becauseaspects of his account clearly had an impact on Douglass’s conception of TomGrant in The Heroic Slave. Douglass may have read Merritt’s full deposition inSenate Document 51; he almost certainly knew the shorter version of Merritt’sstory given in the New Orleans “Protest.”CONSULATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,Nassau, Bahamas, November 9, 1841.Personally appeared before me, John. F. Bacon, consul of the United States ofAmerica at Nassau, Bahamas, William H. Merritt, who, being sworn, deposeth andsaith: That he was a passenger on board the brig Creole, which sailed fromHampton roads on the 27th October, 1841, bound to New Orleans.1[ch07fn.html#ch07fn_1] That he had no interest in the vessel or cargo, but inconsideration of his attending to the slaves during the passage, he was to becharged nothing for his passage. That, on Sunday evening, November 7th, about 9o’clock, was called by Mr. Gifford, the chief mate2 [ch07fn.html#ch07fn_2];that, on going to the cabin door, Mr. Gifford stated there was a man in themainhold with the females. Deponent went to the grate of the hatch, where heremained until Mr. Gifford got the lamp and matches; then had the grate takenoff; entered the hold, and struck the light, and discovered that the person wasMadison Washington, who was head cook of the slaves, and said to him: “Doctor,you are the last person I should expect to find here, and that would disobey theorders of the ship;” to which he only replied, “Yes, sir.” He then got out ofthe hold, deponent trying to prevent him by laying hold of his leg, but havingthe lamp in one hand, could not hold him. After getting on deck, he ran forwardand called for his men to assist him. Deponent blew out the light, and attemptedto get to the cabin; but as soon as he got on deck was attacked by one of theslaves, and held by the shoulder, while another came up with a piece of wood,with two or three more following, who said, “That is he, kill him, by God;”which the one that had the piece of wood attempted to do, but hit the one thatheld deponent, on the head, on which he made his escape and retreated to thecabin; also heard the report of a gun or pistol forward. Does not know whetherthe mate had previously been to the cabin. Saw the captain go on deck. Saw Mr.Hewell3 [ch07fn.html#ch07fn_3] come out of his state-room with a musket, and goto the cabin door, and forbid the slaves from coming down, at the same timetrying to prevent them with the musket, which had no bayonet on it. The slavesattempted to force their way, and hove a handspike into the cabin, on which, Mr.Hewell fired off the gun to intimidate them, as he thinks there was nothing butpowder in it; thinks no one was hurt by the discharge. The slaves then obtainedpossession of the musket, when Mr. Hewell seized the handspike, and made thesame show of defence; on which, one of the slaves said, “He has another gun,”and Mr. Hewell replied he had. The slaves then returned from the cabin door, andMr. Hewell went on deck, but soon returned to the cabin, took hold of the sideof the table, and said, “I am stabbed;” on which he sidled away, and fellapparently helpless on the floor. Did not see Mr. Hewell afterward. Deponentthen attempted to get out of the skylight, but on account of the noise on deck,and the number of slaves there, desisted, and attempted to conceal himself inone of the after berths, where he was covered over with some bedclothes, and twocolored females sitting on him. While there, deponent heard persons come down inthe cabin, and some say, “Take it on deck,” when some seemed to go on deck. Soonthey returned, and the cabin seemed to be full of slaves, searching for persons,and saying, “Come out here, damn you.” Heard them say, “Don’t hurt thesteward—don’t hurt Jacob, or Mrs. Ensor.”4 [ch07fn.html#ch07fn_4] Some one said,“Where is Merritt? bring him out.” Those discovered were taken on deck, to wit,Mrs. Ensor, the steward, and Jacob. The women that concealed him then becomingalarmed, left him, and he got under the mattress. Deponent was soon afterdiscovered, hauled out, and menaced with instant death, by a man called BenBlacksmith,5 [ch07fn.html#ch07fn_5] holding a bowie-knife over him, in companywith others. Madison Washington, however, interceded for him, and his life wasspared, on condition he would navigate the vessel to any port they mightrequire. He supposed, and the slaves seemed to think, also, that the captain andmates were all murdered. Their treatment was afterward kind toward deponent, andthey desired him to take charge of the vessel. After the slaves had discoveredthe captain and mates were aloft, they said they should be killed, but deponentpersuaded them to save their lives. Gifford was the first that came down, andsubsequently the captain was brought down; second mate, also. The captain, hiswife, and second mate, were confined in the forehold. The first mate was allowedto do duty, at deponent’s solicitation. As contradictory orders were given bythe slaves in reference to the destination of the vessel, and in navigating her,he desired that certain persons might be selected for that purpose; on which,Madison Washington, Ben Blacksmith, and Doctor Ruffin, were selected for thatpurpose.6 [ch07fn.html#ch07fn_6] Deponent can identify, by sight, several othersbesides those named by him, as taking an active part in the murder and mutiny.WM.

Articles based on oral accountsappeared in the Friend of Man, the National Anti-Slavery Standard, and the 10June 1842 issue of the Liberator, the source of the text below (which drew onthe earlier pieces). In these articles, Washington is presented as a loyalhusband who, after escaping to Canada, chose to return to Virginia in search ofhis wife. Some recent critics are suspicious of these stories, claiming that thedomestic tale may have been invented to make Washington more appealing to awider audience. But similar stories about Washington were told by three men whoclaimed to have helped Washington on his way back to Virginia: Hiram Wilson(1803–1864), an abolitionist from New Hampshire who worked with fugitive slavesin Canada; Lindley Murray Moore (1788–1871), a Rochester-based Quakerabolitionist; and Robert Purvis (1810–1898), a prominent black abolitionist ofPhiladelphia. For Purvis’s 1889 account of Washington’s return for his wife, see“A Priceless Picture” in part 4 [part04.html#part04].This name will be remembered as belonging to the leader of the ‘ImmortalNineteen,’ who fought for and obtained their liberty on board the Creole.Madison was the ‘very large and strong slave’ found in the after cabin, whobeing seized by both the master and mate, shook them off, and in spite of theirendeavors—together with those of a third sailor who stood over thehatchway—forced a passage, and rushing on deck, cried, ‘We have begun, and mustgo through!’1 [ch08fn.html#ch08fn_1]This scene on the Creole deck was but one chapter in the history of MadisonWashington. Nothing could be more absurd than to suppose that this occasion madeMadison, and not Madison made the occasion. A new clue to the character of thishero of the Creole has just been furnished us.About eighteen months since, Madison was in Canada. He there bore this samename. He staid awhile in the family of Hiram Wilson, who describes him, like the‘Creole protestants,’ as a very large and strong slave. Madison had been sometime in Canada—long enough to love and rejoice in British liberty. But he lovedhis wife, who was left a slave in Virginia, still more. At length, Madisonresolved on rescuing her from slavery. Although strongly dissuaded by hisfriends from making the attempt in person, he would not listen, but crossed theline into this State.2 [ch08fn.html#ch08fn_2] At Rochester, he fell in withfriend Lindley Murray Moore, who collected ten dollars to aid him in his journeytowards Virginia. So strong was Madison’s determination, that at this time heassured his friends he would have his wife or lose his life.As he passed along, he was heard from at Utica and in Albany. The next account,he stands a freeman on the deck of the Creole—the master-spirit of the noblenineteen!We infer, of course, that Madison, in attempting to liberate his wife, washimself re-enslaved. And as it is the custom with slaveholders in the morenorthern slave States, to send the fugitive when secured by them to the extremeSouth—lest he escape again—lest he communicate to other slaves the incidents ofhis day of freedom—as an example that shall strike terror to the breast of hisfellows—he is sold to the southern market. So Madison, we suppose, was captured,and as a dangerous slave, sold for New-Orleans, and shipped with his 134 fellowsufferers.The sequel we all know. Madison Washington is again a freeman under the dominionof Queen Victoria.3 [ch08fn.html#ch08fn_3] Long may he remain free! Onequestion, however, we greatly wish to have answered. Is he still without hisbeloved wife? Remember it was Madison’s visit ‘aft among the women’ that led tothe first act of violence on the Creole. Might not his wife have been thereamong the women?4 [ch08fn.html#ch08fn_4] Yes, and this grave Creole matter mayprove to have been but a part only of that grand game, in which the higheststake was the liberty of his dear wife.

Webster and Tyler believed that the Britishhad acted illegally in freeing the slaves, whom they regarded as murderers, andthus wanted the British to indemnify the slaves’ owners for their loss ofproperty. At the time, Webster was in the midst of the negotiations that wouldresult in the Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842, so he was especially concernedabout resolving the Creole case amicably. When he saw that he would fail in hiseffort to compel the British to offer compensation, he downplayed the incidentso that he could secure the treaty, which helped set the borders between theUnited States and British North America. Webster and Everett were two of themost notable politicians and orators of the antebellum period, and both werefrom Massachusetts. Though neither was an enthusiast of slavery, they believedthat the South’s right to hold slaves was constitutionally guaranteed andcentral to the survival of the Union. Webster’s commitment to the Union wouldeventually lead him to support the Fugitive Slave Act, part of the Compromise of1850, which he hoped would forestall a civil war. Webster’s letter to Everettfirst appeared in Senate Documents, 27th Congress, 2nd session (1842), document137, 2–7, the source of the text below, and was subsequently reprinted in Niles’National Register 61 (1842) and other newspapers and journals of the period.Mr. Webster to Mr. EverettDEPARTMENT OF STATE, January 29, 1842I regret to be obliged to acquaint you with a very serious occurrence, whichrecently took place in a port of one of the Bahama islands.It appears that the brig “Creole,” of Richmond, Virginia, Ensor, master, boundto New Orleans, sailed from Hampton Roads on the 27th of October last, with acargo of merchandise, principally tobacco, and slaves (about one hundred andthirty-five in number); that on the evening of the 7th of November, some of theslaves rose upon the crew of the vessel, murdered a passenger, named Hewell, whoowned some of the negroes, wounded the captain dangerously, and the first mateand two of the crew severely; that the slaves soon obtained complete possessionof the brig, which, under their direction, was taken into the port of Nassau, inthe island of New Providence, where she arrived on the morning of the 9th of thesame month; that at the request of the American consul in that place, theGovernor ordered a guard on board, to prevent the escape of the mutineers, andwith a view to an investigation of the circumstances of the case; that suchinvestigation was accordingly made by two British magistrates, and that anexamination also took place by the consul; that on the report of themagistrates, nineteen of the slaves were imprisoned by the local authorities ashaving been concerned in the mutiny and murder, and their surrender to theconsul, to be sent to the United States for trial for these crimes, was refused,on the ground that the Governor wished first to communicate with the Governmentin England on the subject; that through the interference of the colonialauthorities, and even before the military guard was removed, the greater numberof the remaining slaves were liberated, and encouraged to go beyond the power ofthe master of the vessel, or the American consul, by proceedings which neitherof them could control. This is the substance of the case, as stated in twoprotests, one made at Nassau and one at New Orleans, and the consul’s letters,together with sundry depositions taken by him, copies of all which papers areherewith transmitted.The British Government cannot but see that this case, as presented in thesepapers, is one calling loudly for redress. The “Creole” was passing from oneport of the United States to another, in a voyage perfectly lawful, withmerchandise on board, and also with slaves, or persons bound to service, nativesof America, and belonging to American citizens, and which are recognised asproperty by the Constitution of the United States in those States in whichslavery exists. In the course of the voyage, some of the slaves rose upon themaster and crew, subdued them, murdered one man, and caused the vessel to becarried into Nassau. The vessel was thus taken to a British port, notvoluntarily by those who had the lawful authority over her, but forcibly andviolently, against the master’s will, and with the consent of nobody but themutineers and murderers; for there is no evidence that these outrages werecommitted with the concurrence of any of the slaves, except those actuallyengaged in them. Under these circumstances, it would seem to have been the plainand obvious duty of the authorities at Nassau, the port of a friendly Power, toassist the American consul in putting an end to the captivity of the master andcrew, restoring to them the control of the vessel, and enabling them to resumetheir voyage, and to take the mutineers and murderers to their own country toanswer for their crimes before the proper tribunal. One cannot conceive how anyother course could justly be adopted, or how the duties imposed by that part ofthe code regulating the intercourse of friendly states, which is generallycalled the comity of nations, could otherwise be fulfilled. Here was noviolation of British law attempted or intended on the part of the master of the“Creole,” nor any infringement of the principles of the law of nations. Thevessel was lawfully engaged in passing from port to port in the United States.By violence and crime she was carried, against the master’s will, out of hercourse, and into the port of a friendly Power. All was the result of force.Certainly, ordinary comity and hospitality entitled him to such assistance fromthe authorities of the place as should enable him to resume and prosecute hisvoyage, and bring the offenders to justice. But, instead of this, if the factsbe as represented in these papers, not only did the authorities give no aid forany such purpose, but they did actually interfere to set free the slaves, and toenable them to disperse themselves beyond the reach of the master of the vesselor their owners. A proceeding like this cannot but cause deep feeling in theUnited States. It has been my purpose to write you at length upon this subject,in order that you might lay before the Government of her Majesty fully andwithout reserve, the views entertained upon it by that of the United States, andthe grounds on which those views are taken. But the early return of the packetprecludes the opportunity of going thus into the case of this despatch; and asLord Ashburton may shortly be expected here, it may be better to enter fullyinto it with him, if his powers shall be broad enough to embrace it.1[ch09fn.html#ch09fn_1] Some knowledge of the case will have reached Englandbefore his departure, and very probably his Government may have given himinstructions. But I request, nevertheless, that you lose no time in calling LordAberdeen’s2 [ch09fn.html#ch09fn_2] attention to it in a general manner, andgiving him a narrative of the transaction, such as may be framed from the papersnow communicated with a distinct declaration that if the facts turn out asstated, this Government thinks it a clear case for indemnification.You will see that in his letter of the 7th January, 1837, to Mr. Stevenson,respecting the claim for compensation in the cases of the “Comet,” “Encomium,”and “Enterprise,” Lord Palmerston says that “his Majesty’s Government is ofopinion that the rule by which these claims should be decided, is, that thoseclaimants must be considered entitled to compensation who were lawfully inpossession of their slaves within the British territory, and who were disturbedin their legal possession of those slaves by functionaries of the BritishGovernment.”3 [ch09fn.html#ch09fn_3] This admission is broad enough to cover thecase of the “Creole,” if its circumstances are correctly stated. But it does notextend to what we consider the true doctrine, according to the laws and usagesof nations; and, therefore, cannot be acquiesced in as the exactly correctgeneral rule. It appears to this Government that not only is no unfriendlyinterference by the local authorities to be allowed, but that aid and succorshould be extended in these, as in other cases which may arise, affecting therights and interests of citizens of friendly states.We know no ground on which it is just to say that these colored people had comewithin, and were within, British territory, in such sense as that of the laws ofEngland affecting and regulating the conditions of persons could properly actupon them. As has been already said, they were not there voluntarily; no humanbeing belonging to the vessel was within British territory of his own accord,except the mutineers. There being no importation, nor intent of importation,what right had the British authorities to inquire into the cargo of the vessel,or the condition of persons on board? These persons might be slaves for life;they might be slaves for a term of years, under a system of apprenticeship; theymight be bound to service by their own voluntary act; they might be inconfinement for crimes committed; they might be prisoners of war; or they mightbe free. How could the British authorities look into and decide any of thesequestions? Or, indeed, what duty or power, according to the principles ofnational intercourse, had they to inquire at all? If, indeed, without unfriendlyinterference, and notwithstanding the fulfillment of all of their duties ofcomity and assistance, by these authorities, the master of the vessel could notretain the persons, or prevent their escape, then it would be a differentquestion altogether, whether resort could be had to British tribunals, or thepower of the Government in any of its branches, to compel their apprehension andrestoration. No one complains that English law shall decide the condition of allpersons actually incorporated with [the] British population, unless there betreaty stipulation making other provision for special cases. But in the case ofthe “Creole” the colored persons were still on board an American vessel, thatvessel having been forcibly put out of the course of her voyage by mutiny; themaster desiring still to resume it, and calling upon the consul of hisGovernment resident at the place and upon the local authorities to enable him soto do, by freeing him from the imprisonment to which mutiny and murder hadsubjected him, and furnishing him with such necessary aid and assistance as areusual in ordinary cases of distress at sea. These persons, then, cannot beregarded as being mixed with the British people, or as having changed theircharacter at all, either in regard to country or personal condition. It was nomore than just to consider the vessel as still on her voyage, and entitled tothe succor due to other cases of distress, whether arising from accident oroutrage. And that no other view of the subject can be true is evident from thevery awkward position in which the local authorities have placed theirGovernment in respect to the mutineers still held in imprisonment. What is to bedone with them? How are they to be punished? The English Government willprobably not undertake their trial or punishment; and of what use would it be tosend them to the United States, separated from their ship, and at a period solate as that, if they should be sent, before proceedings could be institutedagainst them, the witnesses might be scattered over half the globe. One of thehighest offences known to human law is thus likely to go altogether unpunished.In the note of Lord Palmerston to Mr. Stevenson, above referred to, his lordshipsaid that, “slavery being now abolished throughout the British empire, there canbe no well-founded claim for compensation in respect of slaves who, under anycircumstances, may come into the British colonies, any more than there would bewith respect to slaves who might be brought into the United Kingdom.” I haveonly to remark upon this, that the Government of the United States sees noground for any distinction founded on an alteration of British law in thecolonics. We do not consider that the question depends at all on the state ofBritish law. It is not that in such cases the active agency of British law isinvoked and refused; it is, that unfriendly interference is deprecated, andthose good offices and friendly assistances expected which a Government usuallyaffords to citizens of a friendly Power when instances occur of disaster anddistress. All that the United States require in those cases, they would expectin the ports of England, as well as in those of her colonies. Surely, theinfluence of local law cannot affect the relations of nations in any such matteras this. Suppose an American vessel, with slaves lawfully on board, were to becaptured by a British cruiser, as belonging to some belligerent, while theUnited States were at peace; suppose such prize carried into England, and theneutrality of the vessel fully made out in the proceedings in Admiralty, and arestoration consequently decreed—in such case, must not the slaves be restored,exactly in the condition in which they were when the capture was made? Would anyone contend that the fact of their having been carried into England by force setthem free?No alteration of her own local laws can either increase or diminish, or any wayaffect, the duty of the English Government and its colonial authorities in suchcases, as such duty exists according to the law, the comity, and the usages ofnations. The persons on board the “Creole” could only have been regarded asAmericans passing from one part of the United States to another, within thereach of British authority only for the moment, and this only by force andviolence. To seek to give either to persons or property thus brought withinreach an English character, or to impart to either English privileges, or tosubject either to English burdens or liabilities, cannot, in the opinion of theGovernment of the United States, be justified.Suppose that by the law of England all blacks were slaves, and incapable of anyother condition; if persons of that color, free in the United States, should, inattempting to pass from one port to another in their own country, be thrown bystress of weather within British jurisdiction, and there detained for an hour ora day, would it be reasonable that the British authority should be made to actupon their condition, and to make them slaves! Or suppose that an article ofmerchandise, opium for instance, should be declared by the laws of the UnitedStates to be a nuisance, a poison—a thing in which no property could lawfullyexist or be asserted; and suppose that an English ship with such a cargo onboard, bound from one English port to another, should be driven by stress ofweather, or by mutiny of the crew, into the ports of the United States, would itbe just and reasonable that such cargo should receive its character fromAmerican law, and be thrown overboard and destroyed by the authorities? It is invain that any attempt is made to answer these suggestions by appealing togeneral principles of humanity. This is a point in regard to which nations mustbe permitted to act upon different view, if they entertain different views,under their actually existing condition, and yet hold commercial intercoursewith one another, or not hold any such intercourse at all. It may be added, thatall attempts by the Government of one nation to force the influence of its lawson that of another, for any object whatsoever, generally defeat their ownpurposes, by producing dissatisfaction, resentment, and exasperation. Better isit, far better in all respects, that each nation should be left withoutinterference or annoyance, direct or indirect, to its undoubted right ofexercising its own regard to all things belonging to its domestic interests anddomestic duties.There are two general considerations, of the highest practical importance, towhich you will, in the proper manner, invite the attention of her Majesty’sGovernment.The first is, that, as civilization has made progress in the world, theintercourse of nations has become more and more independent of different formsof government and different systems of law or religion. It is not now, as it wasin ancient times, that every foreigner is considered as therefore an enemy, andthat, as soon as he comes into the country, he may be lawfully treated as aslave; nor is the modern intercourse of states carried on mainly, or at all, forthe purpose of imposing, by one nation on another, new forms of civilgovernment, new rules of property, or new modes of domestic regulation. Thegreat communities of the world are regarded as wholly independent, each entitledto maintain its own system of law and Government, while all, in their mutualintercourse, are understood to submit to the established rules and principlesgoverning such intercourse. And the perfecting of this system of communicationamong nations requires the strictest application of the doctrine ofnon-intervention of any with the domestic concerns of others.The other is, that the United States and England, now by far the two greatestcommercial nations in the world, touch each other both by sea and land at almostinnumerable points, and with systems of general jurisprudence essentially alike,yet differing in the forms of their government and in their laws respectingpersonal servitude; and that so widely does this last-mentioned differenceextend its influence, that without the exercise to the fullest extent of thedoctrine of non-interference and mutual abstinence from anything affecting eachother’s domestic regulations, the peace of the two countries, and therefore thepeace of the world, will be always in danger.The Bahamas (British possessions) push themselves near to the shores of theUnited States, and thus lie almost directly in the track of that great part oftheir coasting traffic, which, doubling the cape of Florida, connects the citiesof the Atlantic with the ports and harbors on the gulf of Mexico and the greatcommercial emporium on the Mississippi. The seas in which these Britishpossessions are situated are seas of shallow water, full of reefs and sandbars,subject to violent action of the winds, and to the agitations caused by the gulfstream. They must always, therefore, be of dangerous navigation, and accidentsmust be expected frequently to occur, such as will cause American vessels to bewrecked on British islands, or compel them to seek shelter in British ports. Itis quite essential that the manner in which such vessels, their crews, andcargoes, in whatever such cargoes consist, are to be treated, in these cases ofmisfortune and distress, should be clearly and fully known.You are acquainted with the correspondence which took place a few years ago,between the American and English Governments, respecting the cases of the“Enterprise,” the “Comet,” and the “Encomium.” I call your attention to theJournal of the Senate of the United States, containing resolutions unanimouslyadopted by that body respecting those cases.4 [ch09fn.html#ch09fn_4] Theseresolutions, I believe, have already been brought to the notice of her Majesty’sGovernment, but it may be well that both the resolutions themselves and thedebates upon them should be again adverted to. You will find the resolutions, ofcourse, among the documents regularly transmitted to the legation, and thedebates in the newspapers with which it has also been supplied from thisDepartment.You will avail yourself of an early opportunity of communicating to LordAberdeen, in the manner which you may deem most expedient, the substance of thisdespatch; and you will receive further instructions respecting the case of the“Creole,” unless it shall become the subject of discussion at Washington.In all your communications with her Majesty’s Government, you will seek toimpress it with a full conviction of the dangerous importance to the peace ofthe two countries of occurrences of this kind, and the delicate nature of thequestions to which they give rise.I am, sir, your obedient servant,DANIEL WEBSTER.EDWARD EVERETT, Esq., &c., &c."},{"pageContent":"1.

An important influence on Ralph Waldo Emerson and others in theTranscendentalist movement, the Boston-based Channing began arguing againstslavery during the 1830s, most notably in his Slavery (1835). His two-volume TheDuty of the Free States, or Remarks Suggested by the Case of the Creole (Boston:William Crosby, 1842), the source of the text below, refuted numerous legalaspects of Webster’s letter, but the main point that he underscored again andagain is that slavery is a creature only of municipal (state or local) law,whereas the natural law of nations—which many defined as “higher law”—decreesthat a human being cannot be regarded as property. Channing died less than sixmonths after completing the manuscript of The Duty of the Free States in lateMarch 1842.I respectfully ask your attention, fellow-citizens of the Free States, to asubject of great and pressing importance. The case of the Creole, taken byitself, or separated from the principles which are complicated with it, howeverit might engage my feelings, would not have moved me to the present address. Iam not writing to plead the cause of a hundred or more men, scattered throughthe West Indies, and claimed as slaves. In a world abounding with so much wrongand wo, we at this distance can spend but a few thoughts on these strangers. Irejoice that they are free; I trust that they will remain so; and with thesefeelings, I dismiss them from my thoughts. The case of the Creole involves greatand vital principles, and as such I now invite to it your seriousconsideration….This document1 [ch10fn.html#ch10fn_1] I propose to examine, and I shall do sochiefly for two reasons: First, because it maintains morally unsound andpernicious doctrines, and is fitted to deprave the public mind; and secondly,because it tends to commit the free states to the defence and support ofslavery. This last point is at this moment of peculiar importance. The freestates are gradually and silently coming more and more into connexion withslavery; are unconsciously learning to regard it as a national interest; and areabout to pledge their wealth and strength, their bones and muscles and lives, toits defence. Slavery is mingling more and more with the politics of the country,determining more and more the individuals who shall hold office, and the greatmeasures on which the public weal depends. It is time for the free states towake up to the subject; to weigh it deliberately; to think of it, not casually,when some startling fact forces it up into notice, but with earnest, continued,solemn attention; to inquire into their duties in regard to it; to lay downtheir principles; to mark out their course; and to resolve on acquittingthemselves righteously towards God, towards the South, and towards themselves.The North has never come to this great matter in earnest. We have trifled withit. We have left things to take their course. We have been too much absorbed inpecuniary interests, to watch the bearing of slavery on government. Perhaps wehave wanted the spirit, the manliness, to look the subject fully in the face.Accordingly, the slave-power has been allowed to stamp itself on the nationalpolicy, and to fortify itself with the national arm. For the pecuniary injury toour prosperity which may be traced to this source, I care little or nothing.There is a higher view of the case. There is a more vital question to be settledthan that of interest, the question of duty; and to this my remarks will beconfined….In regard to the reasonings and doctrines of the document, it is a happycircumstance, that they come within the comprehension of the mass of the people.The case of the Creole is a simple one, which requires no extensive legal studyto be understood. A man who has had little connexion with public affairs, is asable to decide on it as the bulk of politicians. The elements of the case are sofew, and the principles on which its determination rests, are so obvious, thatnothing but a sound moral judgment is necessary to the discussion. Nothing candarken it but legal subtlety. None can easily doubt it, but those who surrenderconscience and reason to arbitrary rules.The question between the American and English governments turns mainly on onepoint. The English government does not recognize within its bounds any propertyin man. It maintains, that slavery rests wholly on local municipal legislation;that it is an institution not sustained and enforced by the law of nature, andstill more, that it is repugnant to this law; and that of course no man, whoenters the territory or is placed under the jurisdiction of England, can beregarded as a slave, but must be treated as free. The law creating slavery, itis maintained, has and can have no force beyond the state which creates it. Noother nation can be bound by it. Whatever validity this ordinance, whichdeprives a man of all his rights, may have within the jurisdiction of thecommunity in which it had its birth, it can have no validity any where else.This is the principle on which the English government founds itself.This principle is so plain, that it has been established and is acted upon amongourselves, and in the neighboring British provinces. When a slave is brought byhis master into Massachusetts, he is pronounced free, on the ground that the lawof slavery has no force beyond the state which ordains it, and that the right ofevery man to liberty is recognized as one of the fundamental laws of thecommonwealth. A slave flying from his master to this commonwealth is indeedrestored, but not on account of the validity of the legislation of the South onthis point, but solely on the ground of a positive provision of the constitutionof the United States; and he is delivered, not as a slave, but as a “person heldto service by law in another state.”2 [ch10fn.html#ch10fn_2] We should not thinkfor a moment of restoring a slave flying to us from Cuba or Turkey. We recognizeno right of a foreign master on this soil. The moment he brings his slave here,his claim vanishes into air; and this takes place because we recognize freedomas the right of every human being….I repeat it, for the truth deserves reiteration, that all nations are bound torespect the rights of every human being. This is God’s law, as old as the world.No local law can touch it. No ordinance of a particular state, degrading a setof men to chattels, can absolve all nations from the obligation of regarding theinjured beings as men, or bind them to send back the injured to their chains.The character of a slave, attached to a man by a local government, is not andcannot be incorporated into his nature. It does not cling to him, go where hewill. The scar of slavery on his back does not reach his soul. The arbitraryrelation between him and his master cannot suspend the primitive indestructiblerelation by which God binds him to his kind.The idea that a particular state may fix, enduringly, this stigma on a humanbeing, and can bind the most just and generous men to respect it, should berejected with scorn and indignation. It reminds us of those horrible fictions,in which some demon is described as stamping an indelible mark of hell on hishelpless victims. It was the horrible peculiarity of the world in the reign ofTiberius,3 [ch10fn.html#ch10fn_3] that it had become one vast prison. Theunhappy man, on whom the blighting suspicion of the tyrant had fallen, couldfind no shelter or escape through the whole civilized regions of the globe.Every where his sentence followed him like fate. And can the law of a despot, orof a chamber of despots, extend now the same fearful doom to the ends of theearth? Can a little state at the South spread its web of cruel, wrongfullegislation over both continents? Do all communities become spell-bound by a lawin a single country creating slavery? Must they become the slave’s jailers? Mustthey be less merciful than the storm which drives off the bondman from thedetested shore of servitude and casts him on the soil of freedom? Must even thatsoil become tainted by an ordinance passed perhaps in another hemisphere? Hasoppression this terrible omnipresence? Must the whole earth register theslave-holders’ decree? Then the earth is blighted indeed. Then, as some ancientsects taught, it is truly the empire of the Principle of Evil, of the power ofDarkness. Then God is dethroned here; for where injustice and oppression areomnipotent, God has no empire.I have thus stated the great principle on which the English authorities acted inthe case of the Creole, and on which all nations are bound to act. Slavery isthe creature of a local law, having power not a hand-breadth beyond thejurisdiction of the country which ordains it. Other nations know nothing of it,are bound to pay it no heed. I might add that other nations are bound totolerate it within the bounds of a particular state, only on the grounds onwhich they suffer a particular state to establish bloody superstitions, to usethe rack in jurisprudence, or to practice other enormities. They might morejustifiably put down slavery where it exists, than enforce a foreign slave codewithin their own bounds. Such is the impregnable principle which we of the freestates should recognize and earnestly sustain."},{"pageContent":"1. [ch10.html#ch10fn-1] Webster’s letter to Everett of 29 January 1842.2.

Giddings (1795–1864) of Ohio. When southerners and theirnorthern supporters (known as “doughfaces”) failed in their effort to censureAdams, Giddings felt emboldened to address the Creole rebellion. With the helpof the prominent abolitionist Theodore Dwight Weld (1803–1895), who formulatedsome of his language, Giddings drew up a series of resolutions offering supportfor the Creole rebels and questioning the legality of slavery beyond thejurisdiction of the slave states. Giddings proposed the resolutions on the Housefloor on 21 March 1842. Making use of an arcane procedural move, southernleaders refused either to table or to vote on the resolutions, which allowedthem to put forth a resolution the very next day to censure Giddings. Thatcensure passed on a vote of 125–60, with the entire Democratic Party and mostsouthern Whigs voting against Giddings. In response, Giddings resigned from theHouse in protest, only to be reelected by his constituents in a special electionon 5 May 1842. Giddings and Adams continued their campaign against the gagrules, which were eventually repealed on 3 December 1844. Giddings’s resolutionson the Creole rebellion and Virginia congressman John Minor Botts’s censureresolution are taken from the Congressional Globe, 27th Congress, 2nd session,21–22 March, 1842.Mr. GIDDINGS said he had a series of resolutions upon a subject which had calledforth some interest in the other end of the Capitol, and in the nation. Hedesired to lay them before the country, and would call them up for action at thenext opportunity.The resolutions were read as follows:Resolved, That, prior to the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, each of theseveral States composing this Union exercised full and exclusive jurisdictionover the subject of slavery within its own territory, and possessed full powerto continue or abolish it at pleasure.Resolved, That by adopting the Constitution, no part of the aforesaid powerswere delegated to the Federal Government, but were reserved by and still pertainto each of the several States.Resolved, That by the 8th section of the 1st article of the Constitution, eachof the several States surrendered to the Federal Government all jurisdictionover the subjects of commerce and navigation upon the high seas.Resolved, That slavery being an abridgment of the natural rights of man, canexist only by force of positive municipal law, and is necessarily confined tothe territorial jurisdiction of the power creating it.Resolved, That when a ship belonging to the citizens of any State of the Unionleaves the waters and territory of such State and enters upon the high seas, thepersons on board cease to be subject to the slave laws of such State, andtherefore are governed in their relations to each other by, and are amenable to,the laws of the United States.Resolved, That when the brig Creole, on her late passage for New Orleans, leftthe territorial jurisdiction of Virginia, the slave laws of that State ceased tohave jurisdiction over the persons on board such brig, and such persons becameamenable only to the laws of the United States.Resolved, That the persons on board the said ship, in resuming their naturalrights of personal liberty, violated no law of the United States, incurred nolegal penalty, and are justly liable to no punishment.Resolved, That all attempts to regain possession of, or to re-enslave saidpersons, are unauthorized by the Constitution or laws of the United States, andare incompatible with our national honor.Resolved, That all attempts to exert our national influence in favor of thecoastwise slave trade, or to place this nation in the attitude of maintaining a“commerce in human beings,” are subversive of the rights and injurious to thefeelings and the interests of the free States; are unauthorized by theConstitution and prejudicial to our national character.Mr. BOTTS … then asked leave … to offer a resolution— …Whereas the Hon. JOSHUA R. GIDDINGS, the member from the 16th Congressionaldistrict of the State of Ohio, has this day presented to the House a series ofresolutions touching the most important interests connected with a large portionof the Union, now a subject of negotiation between the United States and GreatBritain of the most delicate nature, the result of which may eventually involvethose nations, and perhaps the whole civilized world in war:And whereas it is the duty of every good citizen, and particularly everyselected agent and representative of the people to discountenance all efforts tocreate excitement, dissatisfaction, and division among the people of the UnitedStates at such a time, and under such circumstances, which is the only effect tobe accomplished by the introduction of sentiments before the legislative body ofthe country, hostile to the grounds assumed by the high functionary having incharge this important and delicate trust:And whereas mutiny and murder are therein justified and approved in termsshocking to all sense of law, order, and humanity; thereforeResolved, That this House holds the conduct of the said member as altogetherunwarranted, and unwarrantable, and deserving the severe condemnation of thepeople of this country, and of this body in particular."},{"pageContent":"HENRY HIGHLAND GARNETFROM “AN ADDRESS TO THE SLAVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA”On 16 August 1843, at the National Convention of Colored Citizens held atBuffalo, New York, the African American Presbyterian minister Henry HighlandGarnet (1815–1882) addressed the approximately seventy delegates in attendance.Rejecting the nonviolent, moral-suasion approach championed by William LloydGarrison and his supporters, including Frederick Douglass, Garnet, in “AnAddress to the Slaves,” celebrated slave resistance as an act of patriotism andself-defense, invoking such black freedom fighters as Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner,and Madison Washington. This speech marks the first notable invocation ofWashington beyond the newspaper accounts of 1841 and 1842, showing that he hadentered the pantheon of black revolutionary heroes. Garnet came under fire fromthe Garrisonian abolitionists who made up most of the delegates, and after muchdebate the “Address” failed by one vote in winning the endorsement of thesubcommittee charged with formulating the convention’s recommendations forfuture action. Douglass, who was on that committee, voted against Garnet’sspeech. By the mid-1840s, however, Douglass had moved much closer to Garnet’sposition, in part because of his shared admiration for the rebels of the Creole.In his speeches on Washington of the late 1840s (which are excerpted in the nextsection), he could be just as vociferous as Garnet in calling for slaveresistance. The text below of the closing paragraphs of Garnet’s speech is takenfrom Walker’s Appeal, with a Brief Sketch of His Life.

In the name of the merciful God! and by all that life is worth,let it no longer be a debatable question, whether it is better to choose LIBERTYor DEATH!1 [ch12fn.html#ch12fn_1]In 1822, Denmark Veazie, of South Carolina, formed a plan for the liberation ofhis fellow men. In the whole history of human efforts to overthrow slavery, amore complicated and tremendous plan was never formed. He was betrayed by thetreachery of his own people, and died a martyr to freedom.2[ch12fn.html#ch12fn_2] Many a brave hero fell, but History, faithful to her hightrust, will transcribe his name on the same monument with Moses, Hampden, Tell,Bruce, and Wallace, Touissaint L’Ouverture, Lafayette and Washington.3[ch12fn.html#ch12fn_3] That tremendous movement shook the whole empire ofslavery. The guilty soul thieves were overwhelmed with fear. It is a matter offact, that at that time, and in consequence of the threatened revolution, theslave states talked strongly of emancipation. But they blew but one blast of thetrumpet of freedom, and then laid it aside. As these men became quiet, theslaveholders ceased to talk about emancipation: and now, behold your conditionto-day! Angels sigh over it, and humanity has long since exhausted her tears inweeping on your account!The patriotic Nathaniel Turner4 [ch12fn.html#ch12fn_4] followed Denmark Veazie.He was goaded to desperation by wrong and injustice. By Despotism, his name hasbeen recorded on the list of infamy, but future generations will number himamong the noble and brave.Next arose the immortal Joseph Cinque, the hero of the Amistad.5[ch12fn.html#ch12fn_5] He was a native African, and by the help of God heemancipated a whole ship-load of his fellow men on the high seas. And he nowsings of liberty on the sunny hills of Africa, and beneath his native palmtrees, where he hears the lion roar, and feels himself as free as that king ofthe forest. Next arose Madison Washington, that bright star of freedom, and tookhis station in the constellation of freedom. He was a slave on board the brigCreole, of Richmond, bound to New Orleans, that great slave mart, with a hundredand four others. Nineteen struck for liberty or death. But one life was taken,and the whole were emancipated, and the vessel was carried into Nassau, NewProvidence. Noble men! Those who have fallen in freedom’s conflict, theirmemories will be cherished by the true hearted, and the God-fearing, in allfuture generations; those who are living, their names are surrounded by a haloof glory.We do not advise you to attempt a revolution with the sword, because it would beINEXPEDIENT. Your numbers are too small, and moreover the rising spirit of theage, and the spirit of the gospel, are opposed to war and bloodshed. But fromthis moment cease to labor for tyrants who will not remunerate you. Let everyslave throughout the land do this, and the days of slavery are numbered. Youcannot be more oppressed than you have been—you cannot suffer greater crueltiesthan you have already. Rather DIE FREEMEN, THAN LIVE TO BE SLAVES. Remember thatyou are THREE MILLIONS.It is in your power so to torment the God-cursed slaveholders, that they will beglad to let you go free. If the scale was turned, and black men were themasters, and white men the slaves, every destructive agent and element would beemployed to lay the oppressor low. Danger and death would hang over their headsday and night. Yes, the tyrants would meet with plagues more terrible than thoseof Pharaoh. But you are a patient people. You act as though you were made forthe special use of these devils. You act as though your daughters were born topamper the lusts of your masters and overseers. And worse than all, you tamelysubmit, while your lords tear your wives from your embraces, and defile thembefore your eyes. In the name of God we ask, are you men? Where is the blood ofyour fathers? Has it all run out of your veins? Awake, awake; millions of voicesare calling you! Your dead fathers speak to you from their graves. Heaven, aswith a voice of thunder, calls on you to arise from the dust.Let your motto be RESISTANCE! RESISTANCE! RESISTANCE!—No oppressed people haveever secured their liberty without resistance. What kind of resistance you hadbetter make, you must decide by the circumstances that surround you, andaccording to the suggestion of expediency. Brethren, adieu. Trust in the livingGod.

But beginning in the fall of1845, when he commenced a nearly two-year antislavery lecture tour in GreatBritain and Ireland, Douglass regularly referred to Madison Washington and theCreole rebellion in his speeches, praising both the bravery of the Creole rebelsand the courage of the British in refusing to return the former slaves to theirU.S. owners. Douglass’s British tour of 1845–47 was motivated by his need toleave the United States after the May 1845 publication of his Narrative, forsuddenly the celebrated author—who was still legally a slave—was vulnerable tofugitive slave hunters. (Douglass was bought out of slavery in 1846 by hisBritish admirers.) Speaking in Ireland, Scotland, and England, Douglass no doubtidentified with Washington as a person who took refuge with the British, and onseveral occasions he made the connection himself. Increasingly, he expressed hisadmiration for Washington as a black who was willing to use violence to bringabout his and his compatriots’ freedom. As a lecturer in William LloydGarrison’s antislavery organization, Douglass from 1841 to 1845 had generallyfollowed Garrison in advocating moral suasion over violence. But by the late1840s, he was arguing that violent rebellion could well be an appropriateresponse to the violence of slavery. In 1851, he publicly broke with Garrison,and in his writings of the 1850s, including The Heroic Slave, he celebratedblack rebels as belonging in the heroic tradition of the Americanrevolutionaries of 1776 and the Haitian revolutionaries of the 1790s and early1800s.The eight selections in part 3 [part03.html#part03] follow Douglass from hisfirst known remarks on the Creole rebellion in 1845 to his last, in an 1861essay applauding the resourceful militancy of William Stillman. Though hisfamous 1852 speech, “What to the Slave Is the Fourth of July?,” does not referto the Creole rebellion, it is included here for its evocation of the AmericanRevolutionary violence that gave birth to a country that was founded on theegalitarian ideals of Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence and yet had becomea nation of slavery. Douglass drew on these ironies for his novella, publishedjust six months later, about a black man with the American Revolutionary name ofMadison Washington."},{"pageContent":"FREDERICK DOUGLASSFROM “AMERICAN PREJUDICE AGAINST COLOR”Douglass’s first extant remarks on Madison Washington came at the end of alecture delivered in Cork, Ireland, on 23 October 1845. Still legally a slave,Douglass had fled the United States out of concern that his new celebrity statusas the author of the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An AmericanSlave (May 1845) would leave him vulnerable to capture by fugitive slavehunters. Embraced as an antislavery speaker in Great Britain, he identified withWashington as a fugitive who had wide support in antislavery circles in GreatBritain, along with the tacit support of the British government. Douglass usedthe occasion of the speech to challenge U.S. whites’ antiblack racism and tosupport slaves’ right to resist all forms of tyranny. The speech was reported inthe 27 October 1845 issue of the Cork Examiner; the excerpt below is taken fromThe Frederick Douglass Papers: Series One: Speeches, Debates, and Interviews:Volume 1: 1841–46, edited by John W. Blassingame et al. (New Haven, Conn.: YaleUniversity Press, 1979), which draws on the Cork Examiner printing.My friends, there are charges brought against coloured men not alone ofintellectual inferiority, but of want of affection for each other. I do knowthat their affections are exceedingly strong. Why, but a short time ago we had aglorious illustration of affection in the heart of a black man—Maddison1[ch13fn.html#ch13fn_1] Washington, he has made some noise in the world by thatact of his, it has been made the ground of some diplomacy:—he fled from Virginiafor his freedom—he ran from American republican slavery, to monarchical liberty,and preferred the one decidedly to the other—he left his wife and little ones inslavery—he made up his mind to leave them, for he felt that in Virginia he wasalways subject to be removed from them; he ran off to Canada, he was there fortwo years, but there in misery; for his wife was perpetually before him, he saidwithin himself—I can’t be free while my wife’s a slave. He left Canada to makean effort to save his wife and children, he arrived at Troy where he met withMr. Garrett;2 [ch13fn.html#ch13fn_2] a highly intellectual black man, whoadmonished [him] not to go, it would be perfectly fruitless. He went on howeverto Virginia where he was immediately taken, put with a gang of slaves on boardthe brig Creole, destined for Southern America. After being out nine days, hecould sometimes see the iron-hearted owners contemplating joyfully the amount ofmoney they should gain by reaching the market before it was glutted.On the 9th day Maddison Washington succeeded in getting off his irons, andreaching his head above the hatchway he seemed inspired with the love offreedom, with the determination to get it or die in the attempt. As he came tothe resolution he darted out of the hatchway, seized a handspike, felled theCaptain—and found himself with his companions masters of the ship. He saved asufficient number of the lives of those who governed the ship to reach theBritish Islands; there they were emancipated. This soon was found out at theother side of the Atlantic and our Congress was thrown into an uproar thatMaddison Washington had in imitation of George Washington gained liberty. Theybranded him as being a thief, robber and murderer; they insisted on the BritishGovernment giving him back. The British Lion refused to send the bondsmen back.They did send Lord Ashburton3 [ch13fn.html#ch13fn_3] as politely as possible totell them that they were not to be the mere watchdogs of American slaveowners;and Washington with his 130 brethren are free. We are branded as not loving ourbrother and race. Why did Maddison Washington leave Canada where he might befree, and run the risk of going to Virginia? It has been said that it is nonebut those persons who have a mixture of European blood who distinguishthemselves. This is not true. I know that the most intellectual and moralcolored man that is now in our country is a man in whose veins no European bloodcourses—’tis the Rev. Mr. Garrett; and there is the Rev. Theodore Wright4[ch13fn.html#ch13fn_4]—people who have no taint of European blood, yet they areas respectable and intelligent, they possess as elegant manners as I see amongalmost any class of people. Indeed my friends those very Americans are indebtedto us for their own liberty at the present time, the first blood that gushed atLexington, at the battle field of Worcester, and Bunker Hill (applause).5[ch13fn.html#ch13fn_5] General Jackson has to own that he owes his farm on thebanks of the Mobile to the strong hand of the Negro.

On 1 May 1846, Douglasstook up this theme in a lecture at the Music Hall in Edinburgh beforeapproximately 2,000 people. The speech was reported in the 7 May 1846 issue ofthe Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury and other newspapers in Edinburgh and Glasgow.The excerpt below is taken from volume 1 of The Frederick Douglass Papers, whichdraws on the printing in the Caledonian Mercury.Mr. Douglas[s] was received with much applause. He said, that one of thegreatest drawbacks to the progress of the Anti-Slavery cause in the UnitedStates was the inveterate prejudices which existed against the colouredpopulation. They were looked on in every place as beasts rather than men; and tobe connected in any manner with a slave—or even with a coloured freeman—wasconsidered as humbling and degrading.Amongst all ranks of society in that country, the poor outcast coloured man wasnot regarded as possessing a moral or intellectual sensibility, and allconsidered themselves entitled to insult and outrage his feelings with impunity.Thanks to the labours of the abolitionists, however, that feeling was now brokenin upon, and was, to a certain extent, giving way; but the distinction was stillso broad as to draw a visible line of demarcation between the two classes. Ifthe coloured man went to the church to worship God, he must occupy a certainplace assigned for him; as if the coloured skin was designed to be the mark ofan inferior mind, and subject its possessor to the contumely, insult, anddisdain of many a white man, with a heart as black as the exterior of thedespised negro—(cheers).Mr. Douglas[s] then alluded to the case of Maddison1 [ch15fn.html#ch15fn_1]Washington, an American slave, who with some others escaped from bondage, butwas retaken, and put on board the brig Creole. They had not been more than sevenor eight days at sea when Maddison resolved to make another effort to regain hislost freedom. He communicated to some of his fellow-captives his plan ofoperations; and in the night following carried them into effect. He got on deck,and seizing a handspike, struck down the captain and mate, secured the crew, andcheered on his associates in the cause of liberty; and in ten minutes was masterof the ship—(cheers). The vessel was then taken to a British port (NewProvidence), and when there the crew applied to the British resident for aidagainst the mutineers. The Government refused—(cheers)—they refused to take allthe men as prisoners; but they gave them this aid—they kept 19 as prisoners, onthe ground of mutiny, and gave the remaining 130 their liberty—(loud cheers).They were free men the moment they put their foot on British soil, and theirfreedom was acknowledged by the judicature of the land—(cheers).But this was not relished by brother Jonathan2 [ch15fn.html#ch15fn_2]—heconsidered it as a grievous outrage—a national insult; and instructed Mr.Webster, who was then Secretary of State, to demand compensation from theBritish Government for the injury done; and characterised the noble MaddisonWashington as being a murderer, a tyrant, and a mutineer. And all this for thepunishment of an act, which, according to all the doctrines “professed” byAmericans, ought to have been honoured and rewarded—(cheers). It was consideredno crime for America, as a nation, to rise up and assert her freedom in thefields of fight; but when the poor African made a stroke for his liberty it wasdeclared to be a crime, and he [was] punished as a villain—what was an outrageon the part of the black man was an honour and a glory to the white; and in theSenate of that country—”the home of the brave and the land of the free”—therewere not wanting the Clays, the Prestons,3 [ch15fn.html#ch15fn_3] and theCalhouns, to stand up and declare that it was a national insult to set theslaves at liberty, and demand reparation—these men who were at all times readyto weep tears of red hot iron—(cheers and laughter)—for the oppressed.Monarchical nations of Europe—now talked about being ready to go to all lengthsin defence of the national honour and present an unbroken front to England’smight—(loud cheers). But the British Government, undismayed by the vapouring ofthe slaveholders, sent Lord Ashburton to tell them—just in a civilway—(laughter)—that they should have no compensation, and that the slaves shouldnot be returned to them—(loud cheers)—thus giving practical effect to the greatcommand—”Break the bonds, and let the oppressed go free”4[ch15fn.html#ch15fn_4]—(great cheering)."},{"pageContent":"1.

I am glad, saidMr. Douglass, to be once more in Faneuil Hall, and to address those whom Iregard as among the enslavers of myself and my brethren. What I have to say maynot be very pleasant to those who venerate the Constitution, but, nevertheless,I must say to you that, by the support you give to that instrument, you are theenslavers of my southern brethren and sisters.

The taunt comes with an ill grace from you. Youstand eighteen millions strong, united, educated, armed, ready to put us down;we are weak, ignorant, degraded, unarmed, and three millions! Under thesecircumstances, what can we hope to effect? We call upon you to get out of thisrelation,—to stand away from the slaveholders’ side, and give us fair play. Sayto the slaveholders—’If you will imbrue your hands in the blood of yourbrethren, if you will crush and chain your fellow-men, do it at your own riskand peril!’ Would you but do this, oh, men of the North, I know there is aspirit among the slaves which would not much longer brook their degradation andtheir bondage. There are many Madison Washingtons and Nathaniel Turners in theSouth, who would assert their right to liberty, if you would take your feet fromtheir necks, and your sympathy and aid from their oppressors.Mr. D. spoke of Nathaniel Turner, a noble, brave and generous soul—patient,disinterested, and fearless of suffering. How was he treated, for endeavoring togain his own liberty, and that of his enslaved brethren, by the self-same meanswhich the Revolutionary fathers employed? When taken by his enemies, he wasstripped naked, and compelled to walk barefooted, some thirty yards, overburning coals, and, when he reached the end, he fell, pierced by a hundredAmerican bullets!1 [ch16fn.html#ch16fn_1] I say to you, exclaimed Mr. Douglass,get out of this position of body-guard to slavery!

In 1847, Liberia became anindependent nation, but it continued its association with the ACS. During thesummer of 1848, Liberia’s first president, J. J. Roberts, toured New York Cityand, with the support of the ACS, tried to entice free blacks to immigrate tohis country. Douglass and other abolitionists, black and white, were infuriatedby what they regarded as the ACS’s racist agenda of trying to create a whiteAmerica by insisting that Africa was blacks’ “natural” home. At the 1849meeting, Douglass reiterated his opposition to the ACS, arguing for AfricanAmericans’ rights to citizenship in their native country while warning of thepossibility of black violence from the Madison Washingtons of the United States.The minutes of the meeting were published in an article titled “GreatAnti-Colonization Meeting in New York,” which appeared in the 11 May 1849 issueof Douglass’s North Star, the source of the excerpt below.The cry of the slave goes up to heaven, to God, and unless the American peopleshall break every yoke, and let the oppressed go free, that spirit in man whichabhors chains, and will not be restrained by them, will lead those sable armsthat have long been engaged in cultivating, beautifying and adorning the South,to spread death and devastation there. (Great applause.) Some men go for theabolition of Slavery by peaceable means. So do I; I am a peace man; but Irecognize in the Southern States at this moment, as has been remarked here, astate of war. Sir, I know that I am speaking now, not to this audience alone,for I see reporters here, and I learn that what is spoken here is to bepublished, and will be read by Colonizationists and perhaps by slaveholders. Iwant them to know that at least one colored man in the Union, peace man thoughhe is, would greet with joy the glad news should it come here tomorrow, that aninsurrection had broken out in the Southern States (Great Applause.) I want themto know that a black man cherishes the sentiment—that one of the fugitive slavesholds it, and that it is not impossible that some other black men (A voice—weare all so here,) may have occasion at some time or other, to put this theoryinto practice. Sir, I want to alarm the slaveholders, and not to alarm them bymere declamation or by mere bold assertions, but to show them that there isreally danger in persisting in the crime of continuing Slavery in this land. Iwant them to know that there are some Madison Washingtons in this country(Applause.) The American people have been accustomed to regard us as inferiorbeings. The Colonization Society has told them that we are inferior beings, andthat in consequence of our calm and tame submission to the yoke which they haveimposed upon us; to their chains, fetters, gags, lashes, whipping-posts,dungeons and blood-hounds, we must be regarded as inferior—that there is nofight in us,—and that is evidence enough to prove that God intended us to retainthe position which we now occupy. I want to prevent them from laying thisflattering unaction to their souls. There are colored persons who hold otherviews, who entertain other feelings, with respect to this matter.As an illustration of the spirit that is in the black man, let me refer to thestory of Madison Washington. The treatment of that man by this Government wassuch as to disgrace it in the eyes of the civilized world. He escaped some yearsago from Virginia, and succeeded in reaching Canada, where, nestled in the maneof the British Lion, the American Eagle might scream in vain above him, from hisbloody beak and talons he was free. There he could repose in quiet and peace.But he remembered that he had left in bondage a wife, and in the true spirit ofa noble minded and noble hearted man, he said; while my wife is a slave I cannotbe free. I will leave the shores of Canada, and God being my helper, I will goto Virginia, and snatch my wife from the bloody hands of the oppressor. He wentto Virginia, against the entreaties of friends, against the advice of my friendGurney,1 [ch17fn.html#ch17fn_1] whom to name here ought to secure a round ofapplause. (Loud applause.) He went, contrary to the advice of another—I wasgoing to say, a nobler hero, but I can scarcely recognize a nobler one thanGurney. Robert Purvis2 [ch17fn.html#ch17fn_2] was the man: he advised him not togo, and for a time he was inclined to listen to his counsel. He told him itwould be of no use for him to go, for that as sure as he went he would only behimself enslaved, and could of course do nothing towards freeing his wife. Underthe influence of his counsel he consented not to go; but when he left the houseof Purvis, the thoughts of his wife in Slavery came back to his mind to troublehis peace and disturb his slumbers. So he resolved again to take no counseleither on the one hand or the other, but to go back to Virginia and rescue hiswife if possible. That was a noble resolve (applause;) and the result was stillmore noble. On reaching there he was unfortunately arrested and thrown intoprison and put under heavy irons. At the appointed time he was brought manacledupon the auctioneer’s block, and sold to a New Orleans trader. We see nothingmore of Madison Washington, until we see him at the head of a gang of onehundred slaves destined for the Southern market. He, together with the rest ofthe gang, were driven on board the brig Creole, at Richmond, and placed beneaththe hatchway, in irons; the slave-dealer—I sometimes think I see him—walking thedeck of that ship freighted with human misery, quietly smoking his segar, calmlyand coolly calculating the value of human flesh beneath the hatchway. The firstday passed away—the second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh passed, andthere was nothing on board to disturb the repose of this iron-hearted monster.He was quietly hoping for a pleasant breeze to waft him to the New Orleansmarket before it should be glutted with human flesh. On the 8th day it seemsthat Madison Washington succeeded in getting off one of his irons, for he hadbeen at work all the while. The same day he succeeded in getting the irons offthe hands of some seventeen or eighteen others. When the slaveholders came downbelow they found their human chattels apparently all with their irons on, butthey were broken. About twilight on the ninth day, Madison, it seems, reachedhis head above the hatchway, looked out on the swelling billows of the Atlantic,and feeling the breeze that coursed over its surface, was inspired with thespirit of freedom. He leapt from beneath the hatchway, gave a cry like an eagleto his comrades beneath, saying, we must go through (Great Applause.) Suitingthe action to the word, in an instant his guilty master was prostrate on thedeck, and in a very few minutes Madison Washington, a black man, with woollyhead, high cheek bones, protruding lip, distended nostril, and retreatingforehead,3 [ch17fn.html#ch17fn_3] had the mastery of that ship, and under hisdirection, that brig was brought safely into the port of Nassau, New Providence(Applause.)Sir, I thank God that there is some part of his footstool upon which the bloodystatutes of Slavery cannot be written. They cannot be written on the proud,towering billows of the Atlantic. The restless waves will not permit thosebloody statutes to be recorded there. This part of God’s domain is free, and Ihope that ere long our own soil will be also free. (Applause.)"},{"pageContent":"1.

He spoke on 5 July because of a tradition among black and whiteabolitionists to postpone Fourth of July celebrations as a way of highlightingthe nation’s failure to live up to the egalitarian ideals of the Declaration ofIndependence. By year’s end, when Douglass had composed The Heroic Slave, he hadcome to conceive of Madison Washington as, in part, a black rebel in theJeffersonian tradition, but one who was willing to fight for the principles thatthe slaveholding Jefferson and the nation itself had been willing to abandon.Douglass published the speech as a pamphlet in 1852, and then in 1855 published“Extract from the Oration” (several key pages from the longer work) in theappendix to his second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom (New York andAuburn: Miller, Orton, and Mulligan, 1855), the source of the text below.Fellow-Citizens—Pardon me, and allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speakhere to-day? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your nationalindependence? Are the great principles of political freedom and of naturaljustice, embodied in that Declaration of Independence, extended to us? and am I,therefore, called upon to bring our humble offering to the national altar, andto confess the benefits, and express devout gratitude for the blessings,resulting from your independence to us?Would to God, both for your sakes and ours, that an affirmative answer could betruthfully returned to these questions! Then would my task be light, and myburden easy and delightful. For who is there so cold that a nation’s sympathycould not warm him? Who so obdurate and dead to the claims of gratitude, thatwould not thankfully acknowledge such priceless benefits? Who so stolid andselfish, that would not give his voice to swell the hallelujahs of a nation’sjubilee, when the chains of servitude had been torn from his limbs? I am notthat man. In a case like that, the dumb might eloquently speak, and the “lameman leap as an hart.”1 [ch18fn.html#ch18fn_1]But, such is not the state of the case. I say it with a sad sense of thedisparity between us. I am not included within the pale of this gloriousanniversary! Your high independence only reveals the immeasurable distancebetween us. The blessings in which you this day rejoice, are not enjoyed incommon. The rich inheritance of justice, liberty, prosperity, and independence,bequeathed by your fathers, is shared by you, not by me. The sunlight thatbrought life and healing to you, has brought stripes and death to me. ThisFourth of July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a manin fetters into the grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him tojoin you in joyous anthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do youmean, citizens, to mock me, by asking me to speak to-day? If so, there is aparallel to your conduct. And let me warn you that it is dangerous to copy theexample of a nation whose crimes, towering up to heaven, were thrown down by thebreath of the Almighty, burying that nation in irrecoverable ruin! I can to-daytake up the plaintive lament of a peeled and woe-smitten people.“By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we rememberedZion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, theythat carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted usrequired of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we singthe Lord’s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my righthand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to theroof of my mouth.”2 [ch18fn.html#ch18fn_2]Fellow-citizens, above your national, tumultuous joy, I hear the mournful wailof millions, whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, are to-day renderedmore intolerable by the jubilant shouts that reach them. If I do forget, if I donot faithfully remember those bleeding children of sorrow this day, “may myright hand forget her cunning, and may my tongue cleave to the roof of mymouth!” To forget them, to pass lightly over their wrongs, and to chime in withthe popular theme, would be treason most scandalous and shocking, and would makeme a reproach before God and the world. My subject, then, fellow-citizens, isAMERICAN SLAVERY. I shall see this day and its popular characteristics from theslave’s point of view. Standing there, identified with the American bondman,making his wrongs mine, I do not hesitate to declare, with all my soul, that thecharacter and conduct of this nation never looked blacker to me than on thisFourth of July. Whether we turn to the declarations of the past, or to theprofessions of the present, the conduct of the nation seems equally hideous andrevolting. America is false to the past, false to the present, and solemnlybinds herself to be false to the future. Standing with God and the crushed andbleeding slave on this occasion, I will, in the name of humanity which isoutraged, in the name of liberty which is fettered, in the name of theconstitution and the bible, which are disregarded and trampled upon, dare tocall in question and to denounce, with all the emphasis I can command,everything that serves to perpetuate slavery—the great sin and shame of America!“I will not equivocate; I will not excuse;”3 [ch18fn.html#ch18fn_3] I will usethe severest language I can command; and yet not one word shall escape me thatany man, whose judgment is not blinded by prejudice, or who is not at heart aslaveholder, shall not confess to be right and just.But I fancy I hear some one of my audience say, it is just in this circumstancethat you and your brother abolitionists fail to make a favorable impression onthe public mind. Would you argue more, and denounce less, would you persuademore and rebuke less, your cause would be much more likely to succeed. But, Isubmit, where all is plain there is nothing to be argued. What point in theanti-slavery creed would you have me argue? On what branch of the subject do thepeople of this country need light? Must I undertake to prove that the slave is aman? That point is conceded already. Nobody doubts it. The slaveholdersthemselves acknowledge it in the enactment of laws for their government. Theyacknowledge it when they punish disobedience on the part of the slave. There areseventy-two crimes in the state of Virginia, which, if committed by a black man,(no matter how ignorant he be,) subject him to the punishment of death; whileonly two of these same crimes will subject a white man to the like punishment.What is this but the acknowledgement that the slave is a moral, intellectual,and responsible being. The manhood of the slave is conceded. It is admitted inthe fact that southern statute books are covered with enactments forbidding,under severe fines and penalties, the teaching of the slave to read or write.When you can point to any such laws, in reference to the beasts of the field,then I may consent to argue the manhood of the slave. When the dogs in yourstreets, when the fowls of the air, when the cattle on your hills, when the fishof the sea, and the reptiles that crawl, shall be unable to distinguish theslave from a brute, then will I argue with you that the slave is a man!For the present, it is enough to affirm the equal manhood of the negro race. Isit not astonishing that, while we are plowing, planting, and reaping, using allkinds of mechanical tools, erecting houses, constructing bridges, buildingships, working in metals of brass, iron, copper, silver, and gold; that, whilewe are reading, writing, and cyphering, acting as clerks, merchants, andsecretaries, having among us lawyers, doctors, ministers, poets, authors,editors, orators, and teachers; that, while we are engaged in all manner ofenterprises common to other men—digging gold in California, capturing the whalein the Pacific, feeding sheep and cattle on the hillside, living, moving,acting, thinking, planning, living in families as husbands, wives, and children,and, above all, confessing and worshiping the christian’s God, and lookinghopefully for life and immortality beyond the grave—we are called upon to provethat we are men!Would you have me argue that man is entitled to liberty? that he is the rightfulowner of his own body? You have already declared it. Must I argue thewrongfulness of slavery? Is that a question for republicans? Is it to be settledby the rules of logic and argumentation, as a matter beset with greatdifficulty, involving a doubtful application of the principle of justice, hardto be understood? How should I look to-day in the presence of Americans,dividing and subdividing a discourse, to show that men have a natural right tofreedom, speaking of it relatively and positively, negatively and affirmatively?To do so, would be to make myself ridiculous, and to offer an insult to yourunderstanding. There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven that does notknow that slavery is wrong for him.What! am I to argue that it is wrong to make men brutes, to rob them of theirliberty, to work them without wages, to keep them ignorant of their relations totheir fellow-men, to beat them with sticks, to flay their flesh with the lash,to load their limbs with irons, to hunt them with dogs, to sell them at auction,to sunder their families, to knock out their teeth, to burn their flesh, tostarve them into obedience and submission to their masters? Must I argue that asystem, thus marked with blood and stained with pollution, is wrong? No; I willnot. I have better employment for my time and strength than such arguments wouldimply.What, then, remains to be argued? Is it that slavery is not divine; that God didnot establish it; that our doctors of divinity are mistaken? There is blasphemyin the thought. That which is inhuman cannot be divine. Who can reason on such aproposition! They that can, may; I cannot. The time for such argument is past.At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed. Oh!had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear, I would to-day pour out afiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach, withering sarcasm, and sternrebuke. For it is not light that is needed, but fire; it is not the gentleshower, but thunder. We need the storm, the whirlwind, and the earthquake. Thefeeling of the nation must be quickened; the conscience of the nation must beroused; the propriety of the nation must be startled; the hypocrisy of thenation must be exposed; and its crimes against God and man must be proclaimedand denounced.What to the American slave is your Fourth of July? I answer, a day that revealsto him, more than all other days in the year, the gross injustice and cruelty towhich he is the constant victim. To him, your celebration is a sham; yourboasted liberty, an unholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity;your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants,brass-fronted impudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery;your prayers and hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religiousparade and solemnity, are to him mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, andhypocrisy—a thin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation ofsavages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty of practices more shockingand bloody, than are the people of these United States, at this very hour.Go where you may, search where you will, roam through all the monarchies anddespotisms of the old world, travel through South America, search out everyabuse, and when you have found the last, lay your facts by the side of theevery-day practices of this nation, and you will say with me, that, forrevolting barbarity and shameless hypocrisy, America reigns without a rival."},{"pageContent":"1.

Douglassgave his speech “West India Emancipation” on 3 August 1857 before approximatelyone thousand people, predominately African Americans, at an amphitheater in theOntario County Agricultural Society fairgrounds in Canandaigua, New York. Thespeech was published shortly thereafter in a pamphlet, Two Speeches, byFrederick Douglass; One on West India Emancipation, Delivered at Canandaigua,August 4th, and the Other on the Dred Scott Decision, Delivered in New York onthe Occasion of the Anniversary of the American Abolition Society, May, 1857(Rochester, N.Y., 1857), the source of the excerpt below. (The 4 August date inthe title is incorrect.) Typically, West Indian emancipation speeches praisedBritish leaders for their enlightened action and called on U.S. leaders tofollow their example. But Douglass shifts the emphasis in this speech, creditingthe blacks of the West Indies with bringing about their own emancipation throughtheir use of violent resistance. By invoking Madison Washington and other blackrebels, Douglass calls on blacks to continue to exert similar pressure in theUnited States.Let me give you a word of the philosophy of reform. The whole history of theprogress of human liberty shows that all concessions yet made to her augustclaims, have been born of earnest struggle. The conflict has been exciting,agitating, all-absorbing, and for the time being, putting all other tumults tosilence. It must do this or it does nothing. If there is no struggle there is noprogress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, aremen who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunderand lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may beboth moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothingwithout a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any peoplewill quietly submit to and you have found out the exact measure of injustice andwrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they areresisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants areprescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress. In the light of theseideas, Negroes will be hunted at the North, and held and flogged at the South solong as they submit to those devilish outrages, and make no resistance, eithermoral or physical. Men may not get all they pay for in this world, but they mustcertainly pay for all they get. If we ever get free from the oppressions andwrongs heaped upon us, we must pay for their removal. We must do this by labor,by suffering, by sacrifice, and if needs be, by our lives and the lives ofothers.Hence, my friends, every mother who, like Margaret Garner, plunges a knife intothe bosom of her infant to save it from the hell of our Christian Slavery,should be held and honored as a benefactress.1 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_1] Everyfugitive from slavery who like the noble William Thomas at Wilkesbarre, prefersto perish in a river made red by his own blood, to submission to the hell houndswho were hunting and shooting him, should be esteemed as a glorious martyr,worthy to be held in grateful memory by our people.2 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_2] Thefugitive Horace, at Mechanicsburgh, Ohio, the other day, who taught the slavecatchers from Kentucky that it was safer to arrest white men than to arrest him,did a most excellent service to our cause.3 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_3] Parker andhis noble band of fifteen at Christiana, who defended themselves from thekidnappers with prayers and pistols, are entitled to the honor of making thefirst successful resistance to the Fugitive Slave Bill.4 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_4]But for that resistance, and the rescue of Jerry, and Shadrack, the man-hunterswould have hunted our hills and valleys here with the same freedom with whichthey now hunt their own dismal swamps.5 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_5]There was an important lesson in the conduct of that noble Krooman in New York,the other day, who, supposing that the American Christians were about to enslavehim, betook himself to the mast head, and with knife in hand, said he would cuthis throat before he would be made a slave.6 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_6] JosephCinque on the deck of the Amistad, did that which should make his name dear tous.7 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_7] He bore nature’s burning protest against slavery.Madison Washington who struck down his oppressor on the deck of the Creole, ismore worthy to be remembered than the colored man who shot Pitcaren at BunkerHill.8 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_8]My friends, you will observe that I have taken a wide range, and you think it isabout time that I should answer the special objection to this celebration. Ithink so too. This, then, is the truth concerning the inauguration of freedom inthe British West Indies. Abolition was the act of the British Government. Themotive which led the Government to act, no doubt was mainly a philanthropic one,entitled to our highest admiration and gratitude. The National Religion, thejustice, and humanity, cried out in thunderous indignation against the foulabomination, and the government yielded to the storm. Nevertheless a share ofthe credit of the result falls justly to the slaves themselves. “Though slaves,they were rebellious slaves.” They bore themselves well. They did not hug theirchains, but according to their opportunities, swelled the general protestagainst oppression. What Wilberforce9 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_9] was endeavoring towin from the British Senate by his magic eloquence, the Slaves themselves wereendeavoring to gain by outbreaks and violence. The combined action of one andthe other wrought out the final result. While one showed that slavery was wrong,the other showed that it was dangerous as well as wrong. Mr. Wilberforce, peaceman though he was, and a model of piety, availed himself of this element tostrengthen his case before the British Parliament, and warned the Britishgovernment of the danger of continuing slavery in the West Indies. There is nodoubt that the fear of the consequences, acting with a sense of the moral evilof slavery led to its abolition. The spirit of freedom was abroad in theIslands. Insurrection for freedom kept the planters in a constant state of alarmand trepidation. A standing army was necessary to keep the slaves in theirchains. This state of facts could not be without weight in deciding the questionof freedom in these countries.I am aware that the rebellious disposition of the slaves was said to arise outof the discussions which the abolitionists were carrying on at home, and it isnot necessary to refute this alleged explanation. All that I contend for isthis: that the slaves of the West Indies did fight for their freedom, and thatthe fact of their discontent was known in England, and that it assisted inbringing about that state of public opinion which finally resulted in theiremancipation. And if this be true, the objection is answered.Again, I am aware that the insurrectionary movements of the slaves were held bymany to be prejudicial to their cause. This is said now of such movements at theSouth. The answer is that abolition followed close on the heels of insurrectionin the West Indies, and Virginia was never nearer emancipation than when GeneralTurner10 [ch19fn.html#ch19fn_10] kindled the fires of insurrection atSouthampton.Sir, I have now more than filled up the measure of my time. I thank you for thepatient attention given to what I have had to say. I have aimed, as I said atthe beginning, to express a few thoughts having some relation to the greatinterests of freedom both in this country and in the British West Indies, and Ihave said all that I meant to say, and the time will not permit me to say more."},{"pageContent":"1.

The farmer, Udney Hyde, was initially arrested by the marshals butthen freed by a local court.4. [ch19.html#ch19fn-4] The Fugitive Slave Act, which was part of the Compromiseof 1850, made it illegal to assist or harbor fugitive slaves.

Parker, a former slave, along withsome of his neighbors, fought back against Gorsuch and the white men who hadaccompanied him, killing Gorsuch.

On 1October 1851, in Syracuse, New York, abolitionists freed a runaway slave fromMissouri known as Jerry and helped him reach the safety of Canada; and on 15February 1851, a runaway slave from Virginia known as Shadrach was captured inBoston and then freed by blacks who crowded into the courthouse.

Tillmanwas the steward and cook on the Long Island–based schooner S. J. Waring, whichwas seized on its way to Uruguay by the Jeff Davis, a privately owned ship witha crew authorized by the Confederacy to attack northern ships and positions. Onthe night of 16 July 1861, Tillman killed several of the privateers, gainedcontrol of the S. J. Waring, and guided it back to New York Harbor, where he wasgreeted as a hero. Two weeks later, the popular Harper’s Weekly ran an articleabout the revolt, including several illustrations of Tillman (see figure 5[ch20.html#fig5]). For Douglass, Tillman exhibited virtues shared by MadisonWashington and other black rebels he admired. Tillman’s bravery and militaryskills led Douglass to redouble his efforts to convince Lincoln to recruitAfrican Americans for the Union army. “A Black Hero” appeared in the August 1861issue of Douglass’s Monthly, the source of the text below.While our Government still refuses to acknowledge the just claims of the negro,and takes all possible pains to assure ‘our Southern brethren’ that it does notintend to interfere in any way with this kind of property; while the assistanceof colored citizens in suppressing the slaveholders’ rebellion is peremptorilyand insultingly declined; while even Republicans still deny and reject theirnatural allies and unite with pro-slavery Democrats in recognizing their allegedinferiority—it has happened that one of the most daring and heroic deeds—onewhich will be likely to inflict the heaviest blow upon the piratical enterprizesof JEFF. DAVIS1 [ch20fn.html#ch20fn_1]—has been struck by an obscure negro. Allknow the story of this achievement: The schooner ‘S.J. Waring,’ bound toMontevideo,2 [ch20fn.html#ch20fn_2] having on board a valuable cargo, when,scarcely beyond the waters of New York, was captured by the privateer ‘Jeff.Davis.’ The captain and the mate of the Waring were sent home, and a prize crew,consisting of five men, were put on board of her. Three of the original crew,two seamen and WILLIAM TILLMAN, the colored steward, besides a passenger, wereretained. TILLMAN, our hero, very soon ascertained from conversations which hewas not intended to hear, that the vessel was to be taken to Charleston, andthat he himself was to be sold as a slave. The pirates had chuckled over theirlast item of their good luck; but, unfortunately for them, they had a man todeal with, one whose brave heart and nerves of steel stood athwart theirinfernal purposes.images [../images/f0139-01.jpg]5. “The Attack on the Second Mate,” engraving of William Tillman, Harper’sWeekly, 3 August 1861. Widener Library, Harvard University.TILLMAN took an early occasion to make known to his fellow prisoners thedevilish purpose of the pirates, and declared that they should never succeed ingetting him to Charleston alive. Only one of his fellow prisoners, a Germannamed STEDDING, consented to take part in the dangerous task of recapturing thevessel. He watched anxiously for a favorable moment to slay the pirates and gainhis freedom. So vigilant, however, were the prize captain and crew, that it wasnot until they had nearly reached the waters of Charleston, in the very jaws ofa fate which he dreaded more than death, that an opportunity offered. They werewithin fifty miles of Charleston; night and sleep had come down upon them—foreven pirates have to sleep. STEDDING, the German, discovered that NOW was thetime, and passing the word to TILLMAN, the latter began his fearful work—killingthe pirate captain, mate and second mate, and thus making himself master of theship with no other weapon than a common hatchet, and doing his work so well thatthe whole was accomplished in seven minutes, including the giving the bodies ofthe pirates to the sharks. The other two men were secured, but afterwardsreleased on condition that they would help to work the ship back to New York.Here was a grand difficulty, even after the essential had been accomplished, onebefore which a man less hopeful and brave than TILLMAN would have faltered.Neither himself nor his companions possessed any knowledge of navigation, andthey might have fallen upon shores quite as unfriendly as those from which theywere escaping, or they might have been overtaken by pirates as savage as thosewhose bodies they had given to the waves. But, despite of possible shipwreck anddeath, they managed safely to reach New York, TILLMAN humorously remarking thathe came home as captain of the vessel in which he went out as steward.When we consider all the circumstances of this transaction, we cannot fail toperceive in TILLMAN a degree of personal valor and presence of mind equal tothose displayed by the boldest deeds recorded in history. The soldier whomarches to the battle field with all inspirations of numbers, music, popularapplause, ‘the pomp and circumstance of glorious war,’3 [ch20fn.html#ch20fn_3]is brave; but he who, like TILLMAN, has no one to share danger with him, inwhose surroundings there is nothing to steel his arm or fire his heart, who hasto draw from his own bosom the stern confidence required for the performance ofthe task of man-slaying, is braver. The soldier knows that even in case ofdefeat there are stronger probabilities in his favor than against him. TILLMAN,on the other side, was almost alone against five, and well knew that if hefailed, an excruciating death would be the consequence. He was on the perilousocean, at the mercy of the winds and waves, with whose powers he was as wellacquainted as he was conscious of his inability by skill and knowledge to defythem. How much nerve, moreover, does it not require in a man unaccustomed tobloodshed, a stranger to the sights and scenes of the battle field, to strikethus for liberty! TILLMAN is described as anything but a sanguinary man. Hiswhole conduct in sparing the lives of part of the pirate crew proves that thedescription of his good-natured and gentle disposition is no exaggeration of hisvirtues. Love of liberty alone inspired him and supported him, as it hadinspired DENMARK VESEY, NATHANIEL TURNER, MADISON WASHINGTON, TOUSSAINTL’OUVERTURE, SHIELDS GREEN, COPELAND,4 [ch20fn.html#ch20fn_4] and other negroheroes before him, and he walked to his work of self-deliverance with a step asfirm and dauntless as the noblest Roman of them all.5 [ch20fn.html#ch20fn_5]Well done for TILLMAN! The N. Y. Tribune well says of him, that the nation isindebted to him for the first vindication of its honor on the sea. When willthis nation cease to disparage the negro race? When will they become sensible ofthe force of this irresistible TILLMAN argument?"},{"pageContent":"1.

Some of the accounts draw on thehistorical record, some draw on Douglass, and some draw on each other; WilliamWells Brown’s chapters on Madison Washington in his black histories of the 1860swere particularly influential. Genre is important to representations ofWashington and the Creole rebellion. Whereas Douglass clearly made use offictional techniques, the writers that follow vary in their approaches. WilliamC. Nell’s short sketch of Madison Washington for his 1855 history of blackrevolutionaries works with the known facts. Samuel Ringgold Ward writes aboutWashington in his 1855 autobiography, and he too stays close to the historicalrecord. William Wells Brown, however, in his 1863 and 1867 histories of blackfreedom fighters of the Americas (which focus on African Americans and the CivilWar) goes the route of Douglass in using fictional techniques to create a livelyhistorical narrative. Lydia Maria Child draws on Brown, but in her 1865educational anthology for freedpeople, she uses the rebellion to offer lessonsfor domestic life. Later in the nineteenth century, Robert Purvis approached therebellion through the mode of personal reminiscence, providing new informationabout Washington and himself. Approximately ten years later, Pauline E. Hopkinsoffered fresh perspectives on Brown’s and perhaps Douglass’s accounts, usingfictional techniques to reimagine the Creole rebellion and its genderimplications. For Hopkins, who was writing at the turn into the twentiethcentury, the Creole rebellion remained a compelling moment in a usable AfricanAmerican historical past."},{"pageContent":"WILLIAM C. NELL“MADISON WASHINGTON”The Boston-based African American William Cooper Nell (1816–1874) was a staunchGarrisonian. From 1847 to 1851, he served as assistant editor of Douglass’snewspaper the North Star, and was its original publisher; but when Douglassbroke with Garrison in 1851, Nell resigned from the paper. Like Douglass, Nellbelieved that African Americans should have all the rights of U.S. citizenship,and to that end he campaigned to integrate Boston’s public schools. To supporthis argument for black citizenship, he turned to history, writing two books thatsought to demonstrate blacks’ crucial military contributions to the UnitedStates: Services of Colored Americans in the Wars of 1776 and 1812 (Boston:Prentiss & Sawyer, 1851) and The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution,with Sketches of Several Distinguished Colored Persons: To Which Is Added aBrief Survey of the Condition and Prospects of Colored Americans (Boston: RobertF. Wallcut, 1855); the latter had an introduction by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The1851 volume focused on blacks’ participation in the wars that helped found andsustain the nation; the 1855 volume, from which this selection is taken, took amore aggressive (and decidedly non-Garrisionian) stance in adding admiringaccounts of such black rebels as Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner, David Walker, andMadison Washington.An American slaver, named the Creole, well manned and provided in every respect,and equipped for carrying slaves, sailed from Virginia to New Orleans, on the30th October, 1841, with a cargo of one hundred and thirty-five slaves. Wheneight days out, a portion of the slaves, under the direction of one of theirnumber, named MADISON WASHINGTON, succeeded, after a slight struggle, in gainingcommand of the vessel. The sagacity, bravery and humanity of this man do honorto his name; and, but for his complexion, would excite universal admiration. Ofthe twelve white men employed on board the well-manned slaver, only one fell avictim to their atrocious business. This man, after discharging his musket atthe negroes, rushed forward with a handspike, which, in the darkness of theevening, they mistook for another musket; he was stabbed with a bowie knifewrested from the captain. Two of the sailors were wounded, and their wounds weredressed by the negroes. The captain was also injured, and he was put into theforehold, and his wounds dressed; and his wife, child and niece were unmolested.It does not appear that the blacks committed a single act of robbery, or treatedtheir captives with the slightest unnecessary harshness; and they declared, atthe time, that all they had done was for their freedom. The vessel was carriedinto Nassau, and the British authorities at that place refused to consign theliberated slaves again to bondage, or even to surrender the “mutineers andmurderers” to perish on Southern gibbets."},{"pageContent":"SAMUEL RINGGOLD WARD“MEN AND WOMEN OF MARK”The black abolitionist Samuel Ringgold Ward (1817–ca. 1866) began his career asan antislavery lecturer for William Lloyd Garrison but broke with him in 1840 toembrace the religious and political abolitionism of the American and ForeignAnti-Slavery Society. In 1849 and 1850, he debated Douglass on whether theConstitution was a proslavery or antislavery document. Influenced by Garrison,Douglass in these debates argued that the Constitution was a proslaverydocument, but by 1851 he had adopted Ward’s politically pragmatic view that itwas antislavery. By the early 1850s, Douglass had also publicly rejectedGarrison’s insistence on nonviolent moral suasion and found himself morecongenial with Ward’s position on the value of violent black resistance. In1851, Ward joined the Syracuse Vigilance Committee and helped free the fugitiveslave William “Jerry” McHenry from federal custody. Disillusioned with theUnited States, he moved to Canada and eventually to Jamaica. Ward’s account ofMadison Washington and the Creole rebellion is taken from the chapter“Resistance to Slave Policy” in his Autobiography of a Fugitive Negro: HisAnti-Slavery Labours in the United States, Canada, & England (London: John Snow,1855).The slaves advertised as having run away, or as having been arrested uponsuspicion of being runaways—as any one may see in any Southern newspaper,political or religious—are men and women of mark. “Large frames” are ascribed tothem; “intelligent countenances;” “can read a little;” “may pass, or attempt topass, as a freeman;” “a good mechanic;” “had a bold look;” “above the middleheight, very ingenious, may pass for white;” “very intelligent.” No one who hasseen such advertisements can fail to be struck with them. A mulattress left hermaster, Mr. Devonport, in Syracuse, in 1839, who “had no traces of Africanorigin”: as advertised. Mr. D. said she was worth 2,500 dollars, nearly £500.Such are the slaves who run away, as a rule. I do not deny that some of“inferior lots” come too, but such as those described form the rule.Then, as fugitives, when we recollect what they must undergo in every part oftheir exodus, we can but see them as among the most admirable of any race. Thefugitive exercises patience, fortitude, and perseverance, connected with and fedby an ardent and unrestrained and resistless love of liberty, such as cause mento be admired everywhere—that is, white men everywhere, but in the UnitedStates. The lonely, toiling journey; the endurance of the excitement fromconstant danger; the hearing of the yell and howl of the bloodhound; theknowledge of close, hot pursuit; the dread of capture, and the determination notto be taken alive—all these, furnaces of trial as they are, purify and ennoblethe man who has to pass through them. All these are inseparable from theordinary incidents in the northward passage of the fugitive: and when he reachesus, he is, first, what the raw material of nature was; and, secondly, what theimproving process of flight has made him. Both have fitted him the more highlyto appreciate, the more fully to enjoy, and the more wisely to use, that forwhich he came to us, for which he was willing to endure all things, for which,indeed, he would have yielded life itself—liberty.Let me illustrate these points by a few facts. A Negro, Madison Washington byname—a name, a pair of names, of which he was well worthy—was a slave inVirginia. He determined to be free. He fled to Canada and became free. There thenoble fellow was dissatisfied—so dissatisfied, that he determined to leave freeCanada, and return to Virginia: and wherefore? His wife was there, a slave.Freedom was too sweet to be enjoyed without her. That she was a slave marred hisjoys. She must share them, even at the risk of his losing them. So in 1841 hewent back to Virginia, to the neighbourhood in which his wife lived, lingeredabout in the woods, and sent word to her of his whereabouts; others wereunfortunately informed as well, and he was captured, taken to Washington, andsold to a Negro-trader. One scarcely knows which most to admire—the heroism thisman displayed in the freeing of himself, or the noble manliness that risked allfor the freedom of his wife. One cannot help thinking that, as his captors ledMadison Washington to the slave pen, they must have been smitten with thethought that they were handling a man far superior to themselves. When a load ofNegroes had been made up, Madison Washington, with a large number of others—119,I think—was put on board the schooner “Creole,” to sail out of the mouth of thePotomac River and southwards to the Gulf of Mexico, up the Mississippi, and toNew Orleans, the great slave-buying port of America. But on the night of the 9thof November, 1841, Madison Washington and two others, named respectively PompeyGarrison, and Ben Blacksmith, arose upon the captain and crew, leading all theother slaves after them, and gave the captain the alternative of sailing thevessel into a British port, one of the Bahamas, or of going overboard. Thecaptain, wisely and safely for himself, chose the former; and these three braveblacks, naturally distrusting the forced promise of the Yankee captain, stoodsentry over him until he did steer the “Creole” into the port of Nassau, islandof New Providence, touching which they became freemen. The United StatesGovernment, through the Honourable Edward Everett, demanded of Lord Palmerstongold to pay for these men.1 [ch22fn.html#ch22fn_1] The Court of St. James2[ch22fn.html#ch22fn_2] entertained the demand—not one moment.

Over the years, he also became a man ofletters, writing novels, plays, autobiographies, travel narratives, andhistories. Among his published works are Narrative of William W. Brown, AFugitive Slave (1847); Clotel (1853), generally regarded as the first novel byan African American; The Escape; or, A Leap for Freedom. A Drama in Five Acts(1858); and My Southern Home; or, The South and Its People (1880). Initiallylinked with William Lloyd Garrison, who published his Narrative, Brown soon wenthis own way, and during the late 1850s he became involved with the movementencouraging blacks to immigrate to Haiti. But with the coming of the Civil War,he abandoned that cause and argued for blacks’ rights to citizenship in theUnited States. To make his case, he wrote a series of histories showing blacks’contributions to the nation, emphasizing the important role of black soldiers inthe Civil War. But he also highlighted blacks’ willingness to use violence togain their freedom, and in both The Black Man: His Antecedents, His Genius, andHis Achievements (1863) and The Negro in the American Rebellion: His Heroism andHis Fidelity (Boston: Lee & Shepard, 1867), the source of the text below, hepresents portraits of a number of revolutionary blacks. He first wrote aboutMadison Washington in The Black Man, and that chapter influenced Lydia MariaChild’s account of the Creole rebellion in her 1865 The Freedmen’s Book. For his1867 chapter on Washington, Brown added new material, connecting Washington withsuch black revolutionary heroes as Denmark Vesey and Nat Turner.The revolt on board of the brig “Creole,” on the high seas, by a number ofslaves who had been shipped for the Southern market, in the year 1841, createdat the time a profound sensation throughout the country. Before entering uponit, however, I will introduce to the reader the hero of the occasion.Among the great number of fugitive slaves who arrived in Canada towards theclose of the year 1840, was one whose tall figure, firm step, and piercing eyeattracted at once the attention of all who beheld him. Nature had treated him asa favorite. His expressive countenance painted and reflected every emotion ofhis soul. There was a fascination in the gaze of his finely cut eyes that no onecould withstand. Born of African parentage, with no mixture in his blood, he wasone of the handsomest of his race. His dignified, calm, and unaffected featuresannounced at a glance that he was endowed with genius, and created to guide hisfellow-men. He called himself Madison Washington, and said that his birthplacewas in the “Old Dominion.”1 [ch23fn.html#ch23fn_1] He might have beentwenty-five years; but very few slaves have any correct idea of their age.Madison was not poorly dressed, and had some money at the end of his journey,which showed that he was not from amongst the worst-used slaves of the South. Heimmediately sought employment at a neighboring farm, where he remained somemonths. A strong, able-bodied man, and a good worker, and apparently satisfiedwith his situation, his employer felt that he had a servant who would stay withhim a long while. The farmer would occasionally raise a conversation, and try todraw from Madison some account of his former life, but in this he failed; forthe fugitive was a man of few words, and kept his own secrets. His leisure hourswere spent in learning to read and write; and in this he seemed to take theutmost interest. He appeared to take no interest in the sports and amusementsthat occupied the attention of others. Six months had not passed ere Madisonbegan to show signs of discontent. In vain his employer tried to discover thecause.“Do I not pay you enough, and treat you in a becoming manner?” asked Mr. Dicksonone day when the fugitive seemed in a very desponding mood.“Yes, sir,” replied Madison.“Then why do you appear so dissatisfied of late?”“Well, sir,” said the fugitive, “since you have treated me with such kindness,and seem to take so much interest in me, I will tell you the reason why I havechanged, and appear to you to be dissatisfied. I was born in slavery, in theState of Virginia. From my earliest recollections I hated slavery, anddetermined to be free. I have never yet called any man master, though I havebeen held by three different men who claimed me as their property. The birds inthe trees and the wild beasts of the forest made me feel that I, like them,ought to be free. My feelings were all thus centred in the one idea of liberty,of which I thought by day and dreamed by night. I had scarcely reached mytwentieth year, when I became acquainted with the angelic being who has sincebecome my wife. It was my intention to have escaped with her before we weremarried, but circumstances prevented.“I took her to my bosom as my wife, and then resolved to make the attempt. But,unfortunately, my plans were discovered; and, to save myself from being caughtand sold off to the far South, I escaped to the woods, where I remained duringmany weary months. As I could not bring my wife away, I would not come withouther. Another reason for remaining was that I hoped to get up an insurrection ofthe slaves, and thereby be the means of their liberation. In this, too, Ifailed. At last it was agreed, between my wife and I, that I should escape toCanada, get employment, save my earnings, and with it purchase her freedom. Withthe hope of attaining this end, I came into your service. I am now satisfied,that, with the wages I can command here, it will take me not less than fiveyears to obtain by my labor the amount sufficient to purchase the liberty of mydear Susan. Five years will be too long for me to wait; for she may die, or besold away, ere I can raise the money. This, sir, makes me feel low spirited; andI have come to the rash determination to return to Virginia for my wife.”The recital of the story had already brought tears to the eyes of the farmer,ere the fugitive had concluded. In vain did Mr. Dickson try to persuade Madisonto give up the idea of going back into the very grasp of the tyrant, and riskingthe loss of his own freedom without securing that of his wife. The heroic manhad made up his mind, and nothing could move him. Receiving the amount of wagesdue him from his employer, Madison turned his face once more towards the South.Supplied with papers purporting to have been made out in Virginia, andcertifying to his being a freeman, the fugitive had no difficulty in reachingthe neighborhood of his wife. But these “free papers” were only calculated toserve him where he was not known. Madison had also provided himself with files,saws, and other implements, with which to cut his way out of any prison intowhich he might be cast. These instruments were so small as to be easilyconcealed in the lining of his clothing; and, armed with them, the fugitive feltsure he should escape again were he ever captured. On his return, Madison met,in the State of Ohio, many of those whom he had seen on his journey to Canada;and all tried to prevail upon him to give up the rash attempt. But to every onehe would reply, “Liberty is worth nothing to me while my wife is a slave.” Whennear his former home, and unable to travel in open day without being detected,Madison betook himself to the woods during the day, and travelled by night. Atlast he arrived at the old farm at night, and hid away in the nearest forest.Here he remained several days, filled with hope and fear, without being able toobtain any information about his wife. One evening, during this suspense,Madison heard the singing of a company of slaves, the sound of which appearednearer and nearer, until he became convinced that it was a gang going to acorn-shucking; and the fugitive resolved that he would join it, and see if hecould get any intelligence of his wife.In Virginia, as well as in most of the other corn-raising slave-States, there isa custom of having what is termed “a corn-shucking,” to which slaves from theneighboring plantations, with the consent of their masters, are invited. At theconclusion of the shucking, a supper is provided by the owner of the corn; andthus, together with the bad whiskey which is freely circulated on suchoccasions, the slaves are made to feel very happy. Four or five companies of menmay be heard in different directions, and at the same time, approaching theplace of rendezvous, slaves joining the gangs along the roads as they pass theirmasters’ farms. Madison came out upon the highway; and, as the company camealong singing, he fell into the ranks, and joined in the song. Through thedarkness of the night he was able to keep from being recognized by the remainderof the company, while he learned from the general conversation the mostimportant news of the day.Although hungry and thirsty, the fugitive dared not go to the supper-table forfear of recognition. However, before he left the company that night, he gainedinformation enough to satisfy him that his wife was still with her old master;and he hoped to see her, if possible, on the following night. The sun hadscarcely set the next evening, ere Madison was wending his way out of theforest, and going towards the home of his loved one, if the slave can be said tohave a home. Susan, the object of his affections, was indeed a woman every wayworthy of his love. Madison knew well where to find the room usually occupied byhis wife, and to that spot he made his way on arriving at the plantation; but,in his zeal and enthusiasm, and his being too confident of success, he committeda blunder which nearly cost him his life. Fearful that if he waited until a latehour, Susan would be asleep, and in awakening her she would in her fright alarmthe household, Madison ventured to her room too early in the evening, before thewhites in the “great house”2 [ch23fn.html#ch23fn_2] had retired. Observed by theoverseer, a sufficient number of whites were called in, and the fugitive securedere he could escape with his wife; but the heroic slave did not yield until hewith a club had laid three of his assailants upon the ground with his manlyblows; and not then until weakened by loss of blood. Madison was at once takento Richmond, and sold to a slave-trader, then making up a gang of slaves for theNew-Orleans market.The brig “Creole,” owned by Johnson & Eperson of Richmond, and commanded byCapt. Enson, lay at the Richmond dock, waiting for her cargo, which usuallyconsisted of tobacco, hemp, flax, and slaves. There were two cabins for theslaves,—one for the men, the other for the women. The men were generally kept inchains while on the voyage; but the women were usually unchained, and allowed toroam at pleasure in their own cabin. On the 27th of October, 1841, “The Creole”sailed from Hampton Roads, bound for New Orleans, with her full load of freight,a hundred and thirty-five slaves, and three passengers, besides the crew. Fortyof the slaves were owned by Thomas McCargo, nine belonged to Henry Hewell, andthe remainder were held by Johnson & Eperson. Hewell had once been an overseerfor McCargo, and on this occasion was acting as his agent.Among the slaves owned by Johnson & Eperson, was Madison Washington. He washeavily ironed, and chained down to the floor of the cabin occupied by the men,which was in the forward hold. As it was known by Madison’s purchasers that hehad once escaped, and had been in Canada, they kept a watchful eye over him. Thetwo cabins were separated, so that the men and women had no communicationwhatever during the passage.Although rather gloomy at times, Madison on this occasion seemed very cheerful,and his owners thought that he had repented of the experience he had undergoneas a runaway, and in the future would prove a more easily-governed chattel. But,from the first hour that he had entered the cabin of “The Creole,” Madison hadbeen busily engaged in the selection of men who were to act parts in the greatdrama. He picked out each one as if by intuition. Every thing was done at nightand in the dark, as far as the preparation was concerned. The miniature saws andfiles were faithfully used when the whites were asleep.In the other cabin, among the slave-women, was one whose beauty at onceattracted attention. Though not tall, she yet had a majestic figure. Herwell-moulded shoulders, prominent bust, black hair which hung in ringlets, mildblue eyes, finely-chiselled mouth, with a splendid set of teeth, a turned andwell-rounded chin, skin marbled with the animation of life, and veined by bloodgiven to her by her master, she stood as the representative of two races. Withonly one-eighth of African blood, she was what is called at the South an“octoroon.” It was said that her grandfather had served his country in theRevolutionary War, as well as in both Houses of Congress. This was Susan, thewife of Madison. Few slaves, even among the best-used house-servants, had sogood an opportunity to gain general information as she.Accustomed to travel with her mistress, Susan had often been to Richmond,Norfolk, White-Sulphur Springs, and other places of resort for the aristocracyof the Old Dominion. Her language was far more correct than that of most slavesin her position. Susan was as devoted to Madison as she was beautiful andaccomplished.After the arrest of her husband, and his confinement in Richmond jail, it wassuspected that Susan had long been in possession of the knowledge of hiswhereabouts when in Canada, and knew of his being in the neighborhood; and forthis crime it was resolved that she should be sold, and sent off to a Southernplantation, where all hope of escape would be at an end. Each was not aware thatthe other was on board “The Creole;” for Madison and Susan were taken to theirrespective cabins at different times. On the ninth day out, “The Creole”encountered a rough sea, and most of the slaves were sick, and therefore werenot watched with that vigilance that they had been since she first sailed. Thiswas the time for Madison and his accomplices to work, and nobly did they performtheir duty. Night came on, the first watch had just been summoned, the windblowing high, when Madison succeeded in reaching the quarter-deck, followed byeighteen others, all of whom sprang to different parts of the vessel, seizingwhatever they could wield as weapons. The crew were nearly all on deck. Capt.Enson and Mr. Merritt, the first mate, were standing together, while Hewell wasseated on the companion,3 [ch23fn.html#ch23fn_3] smoking a cigar. The appearanceof the slaves all at once, and the loud voice and commanding attitude of theirleader, so completely surprised the whites, that—“They spake not a word;But, like dumb statues or breathless stones,Stared at each other, and looked deadly pale.”4 [ch23fn.html#ch23fn_4]The officers were all armed; but so swift were the motions of Madison that theyhad nearly lost command of the vessel before they attempted to use them.Hewell, the greater part of whose life had been spent on the plantation in thecapacity of a negro-driver, and who knew that the defiant looks of these menmeant something, was the first to start. Drawing his old horse-pistol from underhis coat, he fired at one of the blacks, and killed him. The next moment Hewelllay dead upon the deck, for Madison had struck him with a capstan bar.5[ch23fn.html#ch23fn_5] The fight now became general, the white passengers, aswell as all the crew, taking part. The battle was Madison’s element, and heplunged into it without any care for his own preservation or safety. He was aninstrument of enthusiasm, whose value and whose place was in his inspiration.“If the fire of heaven was in my hands, I would throw it at those cowardlywhites,” said he to his companions, before leaving their cabin. But in this hedid not mean revenge, only the possession of his freedom and that of hisfellow-slaves. Merritt and Gifford, the first and second mates of the vessel,both attacked the heroic slave at the same time. Both were stretched out uponthe deck with a single blow each, but were merely wounded: they were disabled,and that was all that Madison cared for for the time being. The sailors ran upthe rigging for safety, and a moment more he that had worn the fetters an hourbefore was master of the brig “Creole.” His commanding attitude and daringorders, now that he was free, and his perfect preparation for the grandalternative of liberty or death which stood before him, are splendidexemplifications of the true heroic. After his accomplices had covered theslaver’s deck, Madison forbade the shedding of more blood, and ordered thesailors to come down, which they did, and with his own hands dressed theirwounds. A guard was placed over all except Merritt, who was retained to navigatethe vessel. With a musket doubly charged, and pointed at Merritt’s breast, theslaves made him swear that he would safely take the brig into a British port.All things now secure, and the white men in chains or under guard, Madisonordered that the fetters should be severed from the limbs of those slaves whostill wore them. The next morning “Capt. Washington” (for such was the name henow bore) ordered the cook to provide the best breakfast that the storeroomcould furnish, intending to surprise his fellow-slaves, and especially thefemales, whom he had not yet seen. But little did he think that the woman forwhom he had risked his liberty and life would meet him at the breakfast-table.The meeting of the hero and his beautiful and accomplished wife, the tears ofjoy shed, and the hurrahs that followed from the men, can better be imaginedthan described. Madison’s cup of joy was filled to the brim. He had not onlygained his own liberty, and that of one hundred and thirty-four others, but hisdear Susan was safe. Only one man, Hewell, had been killed. Capt. Enson, andothers who were wounded, soon recovered, and were kindly treated by Madison, andfor which they proved ungrateful; for, on the second night, Capt. Enson, Mr.Gifford, and Merritt, took advantage of the absence of Madison from the deck,and attempted to retake the vessel. The slaves, exasperated at this treachery,fell upon the whites with deadly weapons. The captain and his men fled to thecabin, pursued by the blacks. Nothing but the heroism of the negro leader savedthe lives of the white men on this occasion; for, as the slaves were rushinginto the cabin, Madison threw himself between them and their victims,exclaiming, “Stop! no more blood. My life, that was perilled for your liberty, Iwill lay down for the protection of these men. They have proved themselvesunworthy of life which we granted them; still let us be magnanimous.” By thekind heart and noble bearing of Madison, the vile slave-traders were againpermitted to go unwhipped of justice. This act of humanity raised the uncouthson of Africa far above his Anglo-Saxon oppressors.The next morning “The Creole” landed at Nassau, New Providence, where the nobleand heroic slaves were warmly greeted by the inhabitants, who at once offeredprotection, and extended hospitality to them.But the noble heroism of Madison Washington and his companions found no applausefrom the Government, then in the hands of the slaveholders. Daniel Webster, thenSecretary of State, demanded of the British authorities the surrender of thesemen, claiming that they were murderers and pirates: the English, however, couldnot see the point.Had the “Creole” revolters been white, and committed their noble act of heroismin another land, the people of the United States would have been the first torecognize their claims. The efforts of Denmark Vesey, Nat Turner,6[ch23fn.html#ch23fn_6] and Madison Washington to strike the chains of slaveryfrom the limbs of their enslaved race will live in history, and will warn alltyrants to beware of the wrath of God and the strong arm of man.Every iniquity that society allows to subsist for the benefit of the oppressoris a sword with which she herself arms the oppressed. Right is the mostdangerous of weapons: woe to him who leaves it to his enemies."},{"pageContent":"1. [ch23.html#ch23fn-1] Virginia.2.

Born in Massachusetts, she began her writing career with thenovel Hobomok: A Tale of Early Times (1824), which shocked readers for itspositive representation of an interracial romance between a white woman and anIndian man. In 1833, she published An Appeal in Favor of That Class of AmericansCalled Africans, which called for immediate emancipation. Over the course of herlong career, Child remained committed to antislavery and antiracist reforms. Hershort story “The Quadroons” (1842) was an important source for William WellsBrown’s Clotel (1853), the first novel by an African American, and in 1860 shehelped Harriet Jacobs edit Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861). Childwrote “Madison Washington” for The Freedmen’s Book (Boston: Ticknor and Fields,1865), which she edited and which is the source of the text below. Among thewriters included in Child’s anthology were Frederick Douglass, Harriet BeecherStowe, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Harriet Jacobs. Child also wrote abiographical sketch of Frederick Douglass for the volume.This man was a slave, born in Virginia. His lot was more tolerable than that ofmany who are doomed to bondage; but from his early youth he always longed to befree. Nature had in fact made him too intelligent and energetic to be contentedin Slavery. Perhaps he would have attempted to escape sooner than he did, had henot become in love with a beautiful octoroon slave named Susan. She was thedaughter of her master, and the blood of the white race predominated in severalof her ancestors. Her eyes were blue, and her glossy dark hair fell in soft,silky ringlets. Her lover was an unmixed black, and he also was handsome. Hisfeatures were well formed, and his large dark eyes were very bright andexpressive. He had a manly air, his motions were easy and dignified, andaltogether he looked like a being that would never consent to wear a chain.If he had hated Slavery before, he naturally hated it worse after he had marriedSusan; for a handsome woman, who is a slave, is constantly liable to insult andwrong, from which an enslaved husband has no power to protect her. They laidplans to escape; but unfortunately their intention was discovered before theycould carry it into effect. To avoid being sold to the far South, where he couldhave no hopes of ever rejoining his beloved Susan, he ran to the woods, where heremained concealed several months, suffering much from privation and anxiety.His wife knew where he was, and succeeded in conveying some messages to him,without being detected. She persuaded him not to wait for a chance to take herwith him, but to go to Canada and earn money enough to buy her freedom, and thenshe would go to him.He travelled only in the night, and by careful management, after a good deal ofhardship, he reached the Northern States, and passed into Canada. There he lethimself out to work on the farm of a man named Dickson. He was so strong,industrious, intelligent, and well behaved, that the farmer hoped to keep him along time in his employ. He never mentioned that he was born a slave; for theidea was always hateful to him, and he thought also that circumstances mightarise which would render it prudent to keep his own secret. He showed littleinclination for conversation, and occupied every leisure moment in learning toread and write. He remained there half a year, without any tidings from hiswife; for there are many difficulties in the way of slaves communicating witheach other at a distance. He became sad and restless. His employer noticed it,and tried to cheer him up. One day he said to him: “Madison, you seem to bediscontented. What have you to complain of? Do you think you are not treatedwell here? Or are you dissatisfied with the wages I give you?”“I have no complaint to make of my treatment, sir,” replied Madison. “You havebeen just and kind to me; and since you manifest so much interest in me, I willtell you what it is that makes me so gloomy.”He then related his story, and told how his heart was homesick for his dearSusan. He said she was so handsome that they would ask a high price for her, andhe had been calculating that it would take him years to earn enough to buy her;meanwhile, he knew not what might happen to her. There was no law to protect aslave, and he feared all sorts of things; especially, he was afraid they mightsell her to the far South, where he could never trace her. So he said he hadmade up his mind to go back to Virginia and try to bring her away. Mr. Dicksonurged him not to attempt it. He reminded him of the dangers he would incur: thathe would run a great risk of getting back into Slavery, and that perhaps hehimself would be sold to the far South, where he never would be able tocommunicate with his wife. But Madison replied, “I am well aware of that, sir;but freedom does me no good unless Susan can share it with me.”He accordingly left his safe place of refuge, and started for Virginia. He hadfree-papers made out, which he thought would protect him till he arrived in theneighborhood where he was known. He also purchased several small files and saws,which he concealed in the lining of his clothes. With these tools he thought hecould effect his escape from prison, if he should be taken up on the suspicionof being a runaway slave. Passing through the State of Ohio, he met several whohad previously seen him on his way to Canada. They all tried to persuade him notto go back to Virginia; telling him there were nine chances out of ten that hewould get caught and carried back into Slavery again. But his answer always was,“Freedom does me no good while my wife is a slave.”When he came to the region where he was known, he hid in woods and swamps duringthe day, and travelled only in the night. At last he came in sight of hismaster’s farm, and hid himself in the woods near by. There he remained severaldays, in a dreadful state of suspense and anxiety. He could not contrive anymeans to obtain information concerning his wife. He was afraid they might havesold her, for fear she would follow him. He prowled about in the night, in hopesof seeing some old acquaintance, who would tell him whether she was still at theold place; but he saw no one whom he could venture to trust. At last fortunefavored him. One evening he heard many voices singing, and he knew by theirsongs that they were slaves. As they passed up the road, he came out from thewoods and joined them. There were so many of them that the addition of one morewas not noticed. He found that they were slaves from several plantations, whohad permits from their masters to go to a corn-shucking. They were merry, forthey were expecting to have a lively time and a comfortable supper. Being amoonless evening, they could not see Madison’s face, and he was careful not tolet them discover who he was. He went with them to the corn-shucking; and,keeping himself in the shadow all the time, he contrived, in the course ofconversation, to find out all he wanted to know. Susan was not sold, and she wasliving in the same house where he had left her. He was hungry, for he had beenseveral days without food, except such as he could pick up in the woods; but hedid not dare to show his face at the supper, where dozens would be sure torecognize him. So he skulked away into the woods again, happy in theconsciousness that his Susan was not far off.He resolved to attempt to see her the next night. He was afraid to tap at herwindow after all the people in the Great House were abed and asleep; for, as shesupposed he was in Canada, he thought she might be frightened and call somebody.He therefore ventured to approach her room in the evening. Unfortunately, theoverseer saw him, and called a number of whites, who rushed into the room justas he entered it. He fought hard, and knocked down three of them in his effortsto escape. But they struck at him with their bowie-knives till he was so faintwith loss of blood that he could resist no longer. They chained him and carriedhim to Richmond, where he was placed in the jail. His prospects were now drearyenough. His long-cherished hope of being reunited to his dear wife vanished awayin the darkness of despair.There was a slave-trader in Richmond buying a gang of slaves for the market ofNew Orleans. Madison Washington was sold to him, and carried on board the brigCreole, owned by Johnson and Eperson, of Richmond, and commanded by CaptainEnson. The brig was lying at the dock waiting for her cargo, which consisted oftobacco, hemp, flax, and slaves. There were two separate cabins for the slaves:one for the men and the other for the women. Some of the poor creatures belongedto Johnson and Eperson, some to Thomas McCargo, and some to Henry Hewell. Eachhad a little private history of separation and sorrow. There was many a bleedingheart there, beside the noble heart that was throbbing in the bosom of MadisonWashington. His purchasers saw that he was intelligent, and they knew that hewas sold for having escaped to Canada. He was therefore chained to the floor ofthe cabin and closely watched. He seemed quiet and even cheerful, and theyconcluded that he was reconciled to his fate. On the contrary, he was neverfurther from such a state of mind. He closely observed the slaves who were inthe cabin with him. His discriminating eye soon selected those whom he couldtrust. To them he whispered that there were more than a hundred slaves on board,and few whites. He had his saws and files still hidden in the lining of hisclothes. These were busily used to open their chains, while the captain and crewwere asleep. They still continued to wear their chains, and no one suspectedthat they could slip their hands and feet out at their pleasure.When the Creole had been nine days out they encountered rough weather. Most ofthe slaves were sea-sick, and therefore were not watched so closely as usual. Onthe night of November 7, 1841, the wind was blowing hard. The captain and matewere on deck, and nearly all the crew. Mr. Henry Hewell, one of the owners ofthe cargo of slaves, who had formerly been a slave-driver on a plantation, wasseated on the companion, smoking a cigar. The first watch had just beensummoned, when Madison Washington sprang on deck, followed by eighteen otherslaves. They seized whatever they could find to use as weapons. Hewell drew apistol from under his coat, fired at one of the slaves and killed him. MadisonWashington struck at him with a capstan-bar, and he fell dead at his feet. Thefirst and second mates both attacked Madison at once. His strong arms threw themupon the deck wounded, but not killed. He fought for freedom, not for revenge;and as soon as they had disarmed the whites and secured them safely, he calledout to his accomplices not to shed blood. With his own hands he dressed thewounds of the crew, and told them they had nothing to fear if they would obeyhis orders. The man who had been a chained slave half an hour before was nowmaster of the vessel, and his grateful companions called him Captain Washington.Being ignorant of navigation, he told Merritt, the first mate, that he shouldhave the freedom of the deck, if he would take an oath to carry the brigfaithfully into the nearest port of the British West Indies; and he was afraidto do otherwise.The next morning Captain Washington ordered the cook to prepare the bestbreakfast the store-room could furnish, for it was his intention to give all thefreed slaves a good meal. The women, who had been greatly frightened by thetumult the night before, were glad enough to come out of their close cabin intothe fresh air. And who do you think was among them? Susan, the beautiful youngwife of Madison, was there! She had been accused of communicating with herhusband in Canada, and being therefore considered a dangerous person, she hadbeen sold to the slave-trader to be carried to the market of New Orleans.Neither of them knew that the other was on board. With a cry of surprise and joythey rushed into each other’s arms. The freed slaves threw up their caps andhurrahed again and again, till the sea-gulls wondered at the noise. O, it was ajoyful, joyful time! Captain Washington was repaid for all he had suffered. Hehad gained his own liberty, after having struggled for it in vain for years; hehad freed a hundred and thirty-four of his oppressed brethren and sisters; andhe had his beloved Susan in his arms, carrying her to a land where the lawswould protect their domestic happiness. He felt richer at that moment than anyking with a golden crown upon his head.There had been but two lives lost. One white man was killed in the affray, andhe was the slave-driver who shot down one of the slaves. Captain Enson andothers who were wounded were kindly cared for by Captain Washington. They provedungrateful, and tried to regain possession of the vessel and the slaves. Theblacks were so exasperated by this attempt, that they wanted to kill all thewhites on board. But Captain Washington called out to them: “We have got ourliberty, and that is all we have been fighting for. Let no more blood be shed! Ihave promised to protect these men. They have shown that they are not worthy ofit; but let us be magnanimous.”Next morning the Creole arrived at Nassau, in the island of New Providence.Captain Washington and his companions sprang out upon free soil. There he andhis beloved Susan are living under the protection of laws which make nodistinctions on account of complexion."},{"pageContent":"ROBERT PURVIS“A PRICELESS PICTUREHISTORY OF SINQUE, THE HERO OF THE AMISTAD”In 1889, the Philadelphia-based African American Robert Purvis (1810–1898), whohad played a key role in the antislavery movement, told a reporter from thePhiladelphia Inquirer the story of his 1841 encounter with Madison Washington.Frederick Douglass had mentioned that encounter in his anticolonization speechof April 1849 (excerpted in this volume). For the first time, Purvis offered anaccount that directly linked Washington to the Amistad rebellion of July 1839.In that rebellion, Africans on board the Cuban slave ship Amistad killed anumber of their captors, took control of the ship, and guided it to Long Island,New York, where it was seized by the U.S. Navy. The leader of the rebellion,Cinqué (the Philadelphia Inquirer adopts an alternative spelling), and some ofhis compatriots were arrested and held for two years in jails in New Haven,Connecticut, before former president John Quincy Adams (1767–1848) convinced theU.S. Supreme Court to grant the rebels their freedom. Purvis, who was wealthy,was so inspired by the Amistad rebellion that he commissioned the New Haven–bornartist Nathaniel Jocelyn (1796–1881) to paint a portrait of Cinqué (see figure 6[ch25.html#fig6]). According to Purvis, the painting arrived at his Philadelphiahome on the same day that Washington was passing through on his way from Canadato Virginia. Purvis’s story may not be completely historically reliable, but itremains important for offering a strong link between the Amistad and Creolerebellions. For many African Americans of the nineteenth century, these tworebellions constituted part of a heroic legacy of black resistance to slavery.The article appeared in the 26 December 1889 issue of the Philadelphia Inquirer,the source of the text below.Do you know that that painting was the cause of freeing several hundred slavesand settling forever the rights of freedom to slaves who sought refuge onBritish soil?”Robert Purvis, the old-time Abolitionist, Independent Republican and Reformer,asked this question of an INQUIRER reporter in the sitting room of Mr. Purvis’residence, at the northwest corner of Sixteenth and Mount Vernon streets,yesterday. The painting referred to hangs on the south wall of the room directlyabove Mr. Purvis’ desk. It is the half-length representation of a full-bloodedAfrican negro. The right side of the body is nude and the other side is coveredby a strip of white cloth. The right hand grasps a heavy spear. The man ispowerful and athletic looking, but the face wears an unusually intelligentexpression. The forehead is high and broad; the eyes bright and fearless; thechin strong, and the picture gives one the impression of being the faithfullikeness of a brave, intrepid leader, with strong arms, iron will and superbintellect.“The history of that picture has never been fully written,” continued Mr.Purvis, “though some events which have since become a part of the history ofthis country, and of Great Britain, too, might be traced to it. The paintingrepresents ‘Sinque, the Hero of the Amistad.’ I had it painted almost fiftyyears ago, by Nathaniel Jocelyn, then a well-known artist, whom I sent to NewHaven to obtain sittings from Sinque. Only a few weeks ago I received a letterfrom a gentleman in New Haven, stating that he had in his possession anengraving copied from the picture by John Sartain,1 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_1] andhaving just learned that I was the owner of the original painting, he wrote toask me its history.”images [../images/f0170-01.jpg]6. Nathaniel Jocelyn, Cinque, 1839. Oil on canvas. The New Haven Museum.HISTORY OF THE PAINTINGMr. Purvis’ visitor expressed himself as anxious to hear the history of thepainting, which is only one of many interesting relics in the distinguishedAbolitionist’s residence.“Well, it’s a long story, but I think an excellent one,” began Mr. Purvis. “Youhave doubtless read of the treaty which was formed in the days of our earlystruggles in the Anti-Slavery cause, between this country, England and Spain,and, I think, Germany for the suppression of the African slave trade.2[ch25fn.html#ch25fn_2] Poverty-stricken Spain assented to the treaty with greatreluctance, as it meant a large reduction in that country’s revenue. All of thenations stood by this treaty except Spain, and she surreptitiously carried onthe business of supplying Cuba with slaves from the coast of Africa. The pricessecured for these slaves were so high that even if only one slave vessel in sixescaped capture by the English and other cruisers on the African coast, andsucceeded in landing the human cargo in Cuba a large profit would be realized.As the Cubans worked their slaves eighteen or twenty hours a day, and as aslave’s life averaged there but seven years, there was always a large demand.“It was in the year 1840, I think, that one of these vessels succeeded inlanding a cargo of slaves in Havana. There were about thirty-five men and threewomen. They were all bought by two planters, Don Pedro and Montez, who lived onthe island of Principe.3 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_3] Montez’s body servant was ayoung slave whom he had captured a year or two before this. The boy was namedAntonio, and he had learned to speak Spanish very well. Among these slaves wasSinque, the subject of that painting. He had been captured by a rival tribe ofsavages in the Mendi country4 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_4] and had been taken to thecoast and delivered to the slave traders.CAPTURING THE “AMISTAD”“Don Pedro and Montez owned a small vessel named the Amistad, which they used tocarry the slaves from Havana to their sugar cane plantations on the Island ofPrincipe. These slaves, including the three women, were placed on board theAmistad. They were put below decks and fettered. When the vessel had been outtwo days, Sinque, although unable to get his own fetters off, assisted theothers and succeeded in freeing them of their chains. They armed themselves withshort knives, which were to be used to cut the sugar cane, and, springing ondeck, seized the vessel and killed the captain and steward, who made resistance.The crew of three or four men became frightened, sprang overboard and weredrowned. Montez resisted, but Sinque cut him slightly across the head, notdesiring to kill him, and he finally surrendered. Don Pedro submitted quietlyand was not harmed.“Then Sinque showed his wonderful sagacity and ability. He was ignorant of therules of navigation, but he determined to take his people back to their Africanhomes. He used Antonio, the body servant of Montez, as an interpreter andthrough him told Montez that if he wished to escape with his life he would haveto navigate the vessel back to African shores. Montez agreed and Sinque watchedhim night and day, even sleeping by his side, but the Cuban deceived him. Heknew how to ‘box the compass,’ which makes it appear that a vessel is going in adirection exactly opposite to that which is it really bound, and he made for theUnited States.“I well recollect a newspaper item that went the rounds of the press at thattime, stating that ‘a small vessel, moving in a listless way and evidentlyfilled with blacks, had been seen lying off New London, Conn.’ This was finallyreported to the government, which sent a cruiser, under command of CaptainGedney, to find the suspicious craft.SINQUE’S DESPERATE RESISTANCE“Meanwhile the limited allowance of bread and provisions on board the Amistadhad become exhausted, and Sinque and several companions got into a small boatand rowed ashore to get more supplies. While they were gone Captain Gedneysighted the Amistad and boarded her. Montez immediately demanded his protectionand told him how the slaves had seized the vessel. Captain Gedney ordered a fileof marines on board and seized the slaves. He awaited the return of Sinque, who,as he approached the Amistad in the row-boat, was confronted with a file ofmarines with leveled muskets.“His companions surrendered, but when the marines lowered a boat to take them onboard Sinque refused to go, and finally jumped overboard. He swam around untilhe became exhausted and was then unable to resist, but Captain Gedney saidafterward that even in the moment of his surrender Sinque ‘sat upon the waterlike a king.’ He was lifted on board and with the captured slaves was taken toNew Haven and placed in prison. The Spanish Government demanded their return toCuba as murderers and as property. Abolitionists throughout the entire countrybecame interested in the case and the demand was resisted. They held that if theslaves had been imported from Africa in violation of the treaty they should notbe surrendered to Spain.“Then began a law suit in the United States District Court of New Haven thatinterested the whole civilized world. After a year’s imprisonment, during whichthe good people of New Haven, particularly the ladies, became interested in theblacks and taught them to read and speak a little English, and in a fewinstances even to write it, the case came up. While it was pending President VanBuren5 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_5] meanly ordered a vessel of war on duty off NewHaven, with instructions that if the black people were found to have beenimported as slaves, they were not to be molested as an appeal would be taken tothe Supreme Court, but if the decision be that they were legitimate Spanishproperty, they were to be put on board the vessel at once and hurried off toCuba before their case could be taken to the Supreme Court.VICTORY FOR THE AFRICANS“Well, the case was so one-sided that there was no doubt. Many of the slaveswere unable to speak English, and it was overwhelmingly shown that they wereimported Africans, that the decision of the court was in their favor. TheSpanish Minister carried the case to the Supreme Court, and after another year’sdelay it came up once more. Again the prisoners won by a unanimous decision ofthis high tribunal. It was about this time that my admiration for this manSinque’s courage led me to send Nathaniel Jocelyn down to New Haven to securethis painting.“While the case was pending before the Supreme Court ex-President John QuincyAdams, who, although not an Abolitionist, saw the injustice of Spain’s demand,volunteered his services to defend these poor Africans. When the decisionagainst Spain was announced the blacks were set free and brought East, wherethey were cared for by the Abolitionists. I had twenty-two at my house at onetime. The men were afterwards sent back to their own country. The three womenremained here and they were sent to Oberlin6 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_6] to receive acollegiate education. One of them, named Morgrew, afterwards turned out to be ascholarly, intelligent woman and did excellent work among her people as amissionary. Sinque returned on the vessel with his comrades but did not go backto Africa. He left the ship at Sierra Leone and engaged in the business ofselling tobacco. I never heard of him afterwards and don’t know whether he isdead or alive.INSPIRED BY SINQUE’S EXAMPLE“Now comes the strange part of the story. I was at that time in charge of thework of assisting fugitive slaves to escape. Among the slaves who came into mykeeping in this way was a man named Madison Washington. We sent him to Canada,but, to my astonishment, on the day that I received this painting Washingtonreturned and came to my house and asked me to help him secure the release of hiswife, who he had left in slavery two years previous. He had openedcorrespondence with a young white man in the South,7 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_7] whomhe trusted implicitly and who had promised to bring his wife from the plantationduring the Christmas holidays and deliver her to Washington at a certain spotwhere they were to meet.“I showed Washington this painting and he asked me who it represented. I toldhim the story of Sinque, and he became intensely interested. He drank in everyword and greatly admired the hero’s courage and intelligence. Well, Washingtonwent South to get his wife, and never came back. How he was betrayed or who itwas that betrayed him I never knew until some years later, when I learned thathe was captured while escaping with his wife, and put on board a vessel boundfrom Virginia to New Orleans.LORD PALMERSTON’S BRAVE WORDS“During the voyage Madison Washington, inspired by the example of Sinque,secured his release, killed the captain, freed the other slaves, numbering abouttwo hundred, and compelled the mate to navigate the vessel into English waters.He landed them at Nassau, English province. At the insistence of the South, thisGovernment demanded from Great Britain the immediate return of these slaves asmurderers and as property. The authorities of Nassau refused to send them back,but detained them by putting them in prison, and referred the matter to the homegovernment.“Lord Palmerston was then Prime Minister of England,8 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_8] andhe settled the question then and forever by replying that ‘England knows of noact, even to the taking of life, that can be construed as a crime, whencommitted in pursuit of the natural and inalienable right of freedom.’ TheUnited States recognized the justice of this decision, and never pushed itsclaim.9 [ch25fn.html#ch25fn_9]“And all this grew out of the inspiration caused by Madison Washington’s sightof this little picture.EXHIBITED AT THE ACADEMY“But that is not all that this painting has accomplished.

Mr. Sartain was much interested inthe painting, and he asked that it be sent to the Academy of Fine Arts,10[ch25fn.html#ch25fn_10] of which he and the painter, Mr. Jocelyn, were members.“The picture was sent, and within the next twenty-four hours I received a letterfrom Mr. Nagle, of the managers, stating that pictures of that character couldnot be placed on the walls of the Academy. This offended Mr. Sartain, Mr.Jocelyn and other members who sympathized with them, and they seceded from theAcademy. A bitter fight followed between the managers and seceders, whichfinally resulted in victory for the latter. They returned to the Academy, whenthe managers finally yielded and placed the picture on the walls of thatinstitution. Their principal objection to the painting was that its subject wasa hero, and they considered that a black man had no right to be a hero.“Such is the history of the painting of ‘Sinque the Hero of the Amistad,’”concluded Mr. Purvis. “It only cost me two hundred and sixty odd dollars, but Iwould not part with it now for that many thousands.

HOPKINS“A DASH FOR LIBERTY”Born in Portland, Maine, and raised in Boston, the African American novelist andeditor Pauline E. Hopkins (1859–1930) is best known for her four novelspublished at the turn of the twentieth century: Contending Forces (1900),Hagar’s Daughter (1901), Winona (1902), and Of One Blood (1902). All exceptContending Forces were serialized in the Colored American Magazine, where sheworked as literary editor. In 1901 she began publishing in the magazine a seriesof sketches that she called “Heroes and Heroines in Black.” Her fictionalizedaccount of the Creole rebellion, “A Dash for Liberty,” appeared in the August1901 issue of the Colored American Magazine, the source of the text below. Atthe time of its publication, Hopkins gave the story a subtitle, “Founded on anarticle written by Col. T. W. Higginson, for the Atlantic Monthly, June 1861,”but the noted editor of the Atlantic Monthly never wrote on Madison Washington.His June 1861 essay was on the black conspirator Denmark Vesey, who allegedlyplotted to burn Charleston, South Carolina, to the ground in an effort toliberate the city’s black slaves. Perhaps the essay inspired Hopkins to considerMadison Washington in the tradition of Vesey, as William Wells Brown did at theend of his chapter on the Creole rebellion in The Negro in the AmericanRebellion. Hopkins admired Douglass and Brown, but it is unclear whether she hadread Douglass’s The Heroic Slave (she seems more familiar with Brown’s accountsin The Black Man and The Negro in the American Rebellion). More than otherauthors writing on the Creole, she presents Washington’s wife as activelyengaged in the rebellion. Hopkins lost her job at the Colored American Magazinein 1904 when Booker T. Washington gained control of the magazine and fired thosechallenging his accommodationist approach to race relations. Hopkins continuedto work in journalism, and in subsequent years cofounded her own publishinghouse and magazine, both of which were short-lived, while working as astenographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.So, Madison, you are bound to try it?”“Yes, sir,” was the respectful reply.There was silence between the two men for a space, and Mr. Dickson drove hishorse to the end of the furrow he was making and returned slowly to the startingpoint, and the sombre figure awaiting him.“Do I not pay you enough, and treat you well?” asked the farmer as he halted.“Yes, sir.”“Then why not stay here and let well enough alone?”“Liberty is worth nothing to me while my wife is a slave.”“We will manage to get her to you in a year or two.”The man smiled and sadly shook his head. “A year or two would mean forever,situated as we are, Mr. Dickson. It is hard for you to understand; you white menare all alike where you are called upon to judge a Negro’s heart,” he continuedbitterly. “Imagine yourself in my place; how would you feel? The relentless heelof oppression in the States will have ground my rights as a husband into thedust, and have driven Susan to despair in that time. A white man may take uparms to defend a bit of property; but a black man has no right to his wife, hisliberty or his life against his master! This makes me low-spirited, Mr. Dickson,and I have determined to return to Virginia for my wife. My feelings are centredin the idea of liberty,” and as he spoke he stretched his arms toward the deepblue of the Canadian sky in a magnificent gesture. Then with a deep-drawn breaththat inflated his mighty chest, he repeated the word: “Liberty! I think of it byday and dream of it by night; and I shall only taste it in all its sweetnesswhen Susan shares it with me.”Madison was an unmixed African, of grand physique, and one of the handsomest ofhis race. His dignified, calm and unaffected bearing marked him as a leaderamong his fellows. His features bore the stamp of genius. His firm step andpiercing eye attracted the attention of all who met him. He had arrived inCanada along with many other fugitives during the year 1840, and being a strong,able-bodied man, and a willing worker, had sought and obtained employment on Mr.Dickson’s farm.After Madison’s words, Mr. Dickson stood for some time in meditative silence.“Madison,” he said at length, “there’s desperate blood in your veins, and if youget back there and are captured, you’ll do desperate deeds.”“Well, put yourself in my place: I shall be there single-handed. I have a wifewhom I love, and whom I will protect. I hate slavery, I hate the laws that makemy country a nursery for it. Must I be denied the right of aggressive defenseagainst those who would overpower and crush me by superior force?”“I understand you fully, Madison; it is not your defense but your rashness thatI fear. Promise me that you will be discreet, and not begin an attack.” Madisonhesitated. Such a promise seemed to him like surrendering a part of thoseindividual rights for which he panted. Mr. Dickson waited. Presently the Negrosaid significantly: “I promise not to be indiscreet.”There were tears in the eyes of the kind-hearted farmer as he pressed Madison’shand.“God speed and keep you and the wife you love; may she prove worthy.”In a few days, Madison received the wages due him, and armed with tiny saws andfiles to cut a way to liberty, if captured, turned his face toward the South.It was late in the fall of 1840 when Madison found himself again at home in thefair Virginia State. The land was blossoming into ripe maturity, and the smilingfields lay waiting for the harvester.The fugitive, unable to travel in the open day, had hidden himself for threeweeks in the shadow of the friendly forest near his old home, filled with hopeand fear, unable to obtain any information about the wife he hoped to rescuefrom slavery. After weary days and nights, he had reached the most perilous partof his mission. Tonight there would be no moon and the clouds threatened astorm; to his listening ears the rising wind bore the sound of laughter andsinging. He drew back into the deepest shadow. The words came distinctly to hisears as the singers neared his hiding place.“All dem purty gals will be dar,Shuck dat corn before you eat.Dey will fix it fer us rare,Shuck dat corn before you eat.I know dat supper will be big,Shuck dat corn before you eat.I think I smell a fine roast pig,Shuck dat corn before you eat.Stuff dat coon an’ bake him down,I spec some niggers dar from town.Shuck dat corn before you eat.Please cook dat turkey nice an’ brown.By de side of dat turkey I’ll be foun,’Shuck dat corn before you eat.”1 [ch26fn.html#ch26fn_1]“Don’t talk about dat turkey; he’ll be gone before we git dar.”“He’s talkin,’ ain’t he?”“Las’ time I shucked corn, turkey was de toughes’ meat I eat fer many a day;you’s got to have teef sharp lak a saw to eat it.”“S’pose you ain’t got no teef, den what you gwine ter do?”“Why ef you ain’t got no teef you muss gum it!”“Ha, ha, ha!”Madison glided in and out among the trees, listening until he was sure that itwas a gang going to a corn-shucking, and he resolved to join it, and get, ifpossible some news of Susan. He came out upon the highway, and as the companyreached his hiding place, he fell into the ranks and joined in the singing. Thedarkness hid his identity from the company while he learned from theirconversation the important events of the day.On they marched by the light of weird, flaring pine knots, singing their merrycadences, in which the noble minor strains habitual to Negro music, sounded thedepths of sadness, glancing off in majestic harmony, that touched the very gatesof paradise in suppliant prayer.It was close to midnight; the stars had disappeared and a steady rain wasfalling when, by a circuitous route, Madison reached the mansion where he hadlearned that his wife was still living. There were lights in the windows. Mirthat the great house kept company with mirth at the quarters.The fugitive stole noiselessly under the fragrant magnolia trees and paused,asking himself what he should do next. As he stood there he heard the hoof-beatsof the mounted patrol, far in the distance, die into silence. Cautiously he drewnear the house and crept around to the rear of the building directly beneath thewindow of his wife’s sleeping closet. He swung himself up and tried it; ityielded to his touch. Softly he raised the sash, and softly he crept into theroom. His foot struck against an object and swept it to the floor. It fell witha loud crash. In an instant the door opened. There was a rush of feet, andMadison stood at bay. The house was aroused; lights were brought.“I knowed ‘twas him!” cried the overseer in triumph. “I heern him a-gettin’ inthe window, but I kept dark till he knocked my gun down; then I grabbed him! Iknowed this room’d trap him ef we was patient about it.”Madison shook his captor off and backed against the wall. His grasp tightened onthe club in his hand; his nerves were like steel, his eyes flashed fire.“Don’t kill him,” shouted Judge Johnson, as the overseer’s pistol gleamed in thelight. “Five hundred dollars for him alive!”With a crash, Madison’s club descended on the head of the nearest man; again,and yet again, he whirled it around, doing frightful execution each time itfell. Three of the men who had responded to the overseer’s cry for help were onthe ground, and he himself was sore from many wounds before, weakened by loss ofblood, Madison finally succumbed.The brig “Creole” lay at the Richmond dock taking on her cargo of tobacco, hemp,flax and slaves. The sky was cloudless, and the blue waters rippled but slightlyunder the faint breeze. There was on board the confusion incident to departure.In the hold and on deck men were hurrying to and fro, busy and excited, makingthe final preparations for the voyage. The slaves came aboard in two gangs:first the men, chained like cattle, were marched to their quarters in the hold;then came the women to whom more freedom was allowed.In spite of the blue sky and the bright sunlight that silvered the water thescene was indescribably depressing and sad. The procession of gloomy-faced menand weeping women seemed to be descending into a living grave.The captain and the first mate were standing together at the head of the gangwayas the women stepped aboard. Most were very plain and bore the marks ofservitude, a few were neat and attractive in appearances; but one was a womanwhose great beauty immediately attracted attention; she was an octoroon.2[ch26fn.html#ch26fn_2] It was a tradition that her grandfather had served in theRevolutionary War, as well as in both Houses of Congress. That was nothing,however, at a time when the blood of the proudest F. F. V.’s3[ch26fn.html#ch26fn_3] was freely mingled with that of the African slaves ontheir plantations. Who wonders that Virginia has produced great men of colorfrom among the exbondmen, or, that illustrious black men proudly point toVirginia as a birthplace? Posterity rises to the plane that their ancestorsbequeath, and the most refined, the wealthiest and the most intellectual whitesof that proud State have not hesitated to amalgamate with the Negro.“What a beauty!” exclaimed the captain as the line of women paused a momentopposite him.“Yes,” said the overseer in charge of the gang. “She’s as fine a piece of fleshas I have had in trade for many a day.”“What’s the price?” demanded the captain.“Oh, way up. Two or three thousand. She’s a lady’s maid, well-educated, and cansing and dance. We’ll get it in New Orleans. Like to buy?”“You don’t suit my pile,”4 [ch26fn.html#ch26fn_4] was the reply, as his eyesfollowed the retreating form of the handsome octoroon. “Give her a cabin toherself; she ought not to herd with the rest,” he continued, turning to themate.He turned with a meaning laugh to execute the order.The “Creole” proceeded slowly on her way towards New Orleans. In the men’scabin, Madison Monroe5 [ch26fn.html#ch26fn_5] lay chained to the floor andheavily ironed. But from the first moment on board ship he had been busilyengaged in selecting men who could be trusted in the dash for liberty that hewas determined to make. The miniature files and saws which he still woreconcealed in his clothing were faithfully used in the darkness of night. The manwas at peace, although he had caught no glimpse of the dearly loved Susan. Whenthe body suffers greatly, the strain upon the heart becomes less tense, and awelcome calmness had stolen over the prisoner’s soul.On the ninth day out the brig encountered a rough sea, and most of the slaveswere sick, and therefore not watched with very great vigilance. This was thetime for action, and it was planned that they should rise that night. Night cameon; the first watch was summoned; the wind was blowing high. Along the narrowpassageway that separated the men’s quarters from the women’s, a man wascreeping.The octoroon lay upon the floor of her cabin, apparently sleeping, when a shadowdarkened the door, and the captain stepped into the room, casting bold glancesat the reclining figure. Profound silence reigned. One might have fancied one’sself on a deserted vessel, but for the sound of an occasional footstep on thedeck above, and the murmur of voices in the opposite hold.She lay stretched at full length with her head resting upon her arm, a positionthat displayed to the best advantage the perfect symmetry of her superb figure;the dim light of a lantern played upon the long black ringlets, finely-chiselledmouth and well-rounded chin, upon the marbled skin veined by her master’sblood,—representative of two races, to which did she belong?For a moment the man gazed at her in silence; then casting a glance around him,he dropped upon one knee and kissed the sleeping woman full upon the mouth.With a shriek the startled sleeper sprang to her feet. The woman’s heart stoodstill with horror; she recognized the intruder as she dashed his face aside withboth hands.“None of that, my beauty,” growled the man, as he reeled back with an oath, andthen flung himself forward and threw his arm about her slender waist. “Why didyou think you had a private cabin, and all the delicacies of the season? Not tobehave like a young catamount,6 [ch26fn.html#ch26fn_6] I warrant you.”The passion of terror and desperation lent the girl such strength that the manwas forced to relax his hold slightly. Quick as a flash, she struck him astinging blow across the eyes, and as he staggered back, she sprang out of thedoorway, making for the deck with the evident intention of going overboard.“God have mercy!” broke from her lips as she passed the men’s cabin, closelyfollowed by the captain.“Hold on, girl; we’ll protect you!” shouted Madison, and he stooped, seized theheavy padlock which fastened the iron ring that encircled his ankle to the ironbar, and stiffening the muscles, wrenched the fastening apart, and hurled itwith all his force straight at the captain’s head.His aim was correct. The padlock hit the captain not far from the left temple.The blow stunned him. In a moment Madison was upon him and had seized hisweapons, another moment served to handcuff the unconscious man.“If the fire of Heaven were in my hands, I would throw it at these cowardlywhites. Follow me: it is liberty or death!”7 [ch26fn.html#ch26fn_7] he shoutedas he rushed for the quarter-deck. Eighteen others followed him, all of whomseized whatever they could wield as weapons.The crew were all on deck; the three passengers were seated on the companionsmoking. The appearance of the slaves all at once completely surprised thewhites.So swift were Madison’s movements that at first the officers made no attempt touse their weapons; but this was only for an instant. One of the passengers drewhis pistol, fired, and killed one of the blacks. The next moment he lay deadupon the deck from a blow with a piece of a capstan bar in Madison’s hand. Thefight then became general, passengers and crew taking part.The first and second mates were stretched out upon the deck with a single bloweach. The sailors ran up the rigging for safety, and in short time Madison wasmaster of the “Creole.”After his accomplices had covered the slaver’s deck, the intrepid leader forbadethe shedding of more blood. The sailors came down to the deck, and their woundswere dressed. All the prisoners were heavily ironed and well guarded except themate, who was to navigate the vessel; with a musket doubly charged pointed athis breast, he was made to swear to take the brig into a British port.By one splendid and heroic stroke, the daring Madison had not only gained hisown liberty, but that of one hundred and thirty-four others.The next morning all the slaves who were still fettered, were released, and thecook was ordered to prepare the best breakfast that the stores would permit;this was to be a fête in honor of the success of the revolt and as a surprise tothe females, whom the men had not yet seen.As the women filed into the captain’s cabin, where the meal was served, weeping,singing and shouting over their deliverance, the beautiful octoroon with onewild, half-frantic cry of joy sprang towards the gallant leader.“Madison!”“My God! Susan! My wife!”She was locked to his breast; she clung to him convulsively. Unnerved at last bythe revulsion to more than relief and ecstacy, she broke into wild sobs, whilethe astonished company closed around them with loud hurrahs.Madison’s cup of joy was filled to the brim. He clasped her to him in silence,and humbly thanked Heaven for its blessing and mercy.The next morning the “Creole” landed at Nassau, New Providence, where the slaveswere offered protection and hospitality.Every act of oppression is a weapon for the oppressed.

Critics have deepened our appreciation of the novella’s aestheticsand explored its racial politics (Douglass’s views on black resistance andnationalism in particular). There has also been work on Douglass’s use ofhistorical sources, his awareness of the larger diplomatic context surroundingthe Creole revolt, his interest in interracial friendship, and his interactionswith other writers of the time, such as Harriet Beecher Stowe. Critics havedebated key aspects of The Heroic Slave. Though an admirer of the novella,Richard Yarborough took Douglass to task for his emphasis on black maleleadership, while Maggie Montesinos Sale, Celeste-Marie Bernier, and othersdeveloped alternative perspectives on gender in the novella. The sevenselections in this section, running from Stepto’s pioneering essay on Douglass’sartful storytelling to Carrie Hyde’s consideration of meteorological motifs,provide a sampling of the major work on The Heroic Slave published over the lastthree decades.

At the end of the volume, we also providea selected bibliography of work on The Heroic Slave and the Creole rebellion."},{"pageContent":"ROBERT B. STEPTOFROM “STORYTELLING IN EARLY AFRO-AMERICAN FICTION”1 [ch27fn.html#ch27fn_1]The novella is full of craft, especially of the sort which combines artfulnesswith a certain fabulistic usefulness. Appropriately enough, evidence ofDouglass’ craft is available in the novella’s attention to both theme andcharacter. In Part 1 [part01.html#part01] of “The Heroic Slave,” we are told ofthe “double state” of Virginia and introduced not only to Madison Washington butalso to Mr. Listwell, who figures as the model abolitionist in the story. Themeticulous development of the Virginia theme and of the portrait of Mr.Listwell, much more than the portrayal of Washington as a hero, is the stuff ofuseful art-making in Douglass’ novella.The theme of the duality or “doubleness” of Virginia begins in the novella’svery first sentence: “The State of Virginia is famous in American annals for themultitudinous array of her statesmen and heroes.” The rest of the paragraphcontinues as follows:She has been dignified by some the mother of statesmen. History has not beensparing in recording their names, or in blazoning their deeds. Her high positionin this respect, has given her an enviable distinction among her sister States.With Virginia for his birth-place, even a man of ordinary parts, on account ofthe general partiality for her sons, easily rises to eminent stations. Men, notgreat enough to attract special attention in their native States, have, like acertain distinguished citizen in the State of New York, sighed and repined thatthey were not born in Virginia. Yet not all the great ones of the Old Dominionhave, by the fact of their birthplace, escaped undeserved obscurity. By somestrange neglect, one of the truest, manliest, and bravest of her children,—onewho, in after years, will, I think, command the pen of genius to set his meritsforth—holds now no higher place in the records of that grand old Commonwealththan is held by a horse or an ox. Let those account for it who can, but therestands the fact, that a man who loved liberty as well as did Patrick Henry—whodeserved it as much as Thomas Jefferson—and who fought for it with a valor ashigh, an arm as strong, and against odds as great as he who led all the armiesof the American colonies through the great war for freedom and independence,lives now only in the chattel records of his native state.2[ch27fn.html#ch27fn_2]At least two features here are worthy of note. The paragraph as a whole, butespecially its initial sentences, can be seen as significant revoicing of theconventional opening of a slave narrative. Slave narratives usually begin withthe phrase “I was born”; this is true of Douglass’ 1845 Narrative and true also,as James Olney reminds us, of the narratives of Henry Bibb, Henry “Box” Brown,William Wells Brown, John Thompson, Samuel Ringgold Ward, James W. C.Pennington, Austin Steward, James Roberts, and many, many other former slaves.3[ch27fn.html#ch27fn_3] In “The Heroic Slave,” however, Douglass transforms “Iwas born” into the broader assertion that in Virginia many heroes have beenborn. After that, he then works his way to the central point that a certainone—an unknown hero who lives now only in the chattel records and not thehistory books—has been born. Douglass knows the slave narrative convention,partly because he has used it himself; but more to the point, he seems to havean understanding of how to exploit its rhetorical usefulness in terms ofproclaiming the existence and identity of an individual without merely employingit verbatim. This is clear evidence, I think, of a first step, albeit a smallone, toward the creation of an Afro-American fiction based upon the conventionsof the slave narratives. That Douglass himself was quite possibly thinking inthese terms while writing is suggested by his persistent reference to the“chattel records” which must, in effect, be transformed by “the pen of genius”so that his hero’s merits may be set forth—indeed, set free. If by this Douglassmeans that his hero’s story must be liberated from the realm—the text—of brutalfact, and more, that texts must be created to compete with other texts, thenit’s safe to say that he brought to the creation of “The Heroic Slave” all theintentions, if not all the skills, of the self-conscious writer.The other key feature of the paragraph pertains more directly to the novella’sVirginia theme. I refer here to the small yet delightfully artful riddle whichpermits a certain ingenious closure of the paragraph. After declaring that hishero loved liberty as much as did Patrick Henry, and deserved it as much asThomas Jefferson, Douglass refuses to name the third famous son of Virginia withwhom his hero is to be compared. He speaks only of “he who led all the armies ofthe American colonies through the great war for freedom and independence.” Ofcourse, as any school boy or girl knows, the mystery man is Washington. And thatis the answer—and point—to Douglass’ funny-sad joke about the “double state” ofVirginia as well: his mystery man is also a hero named Washington. Thus,Douglass advances his comparison of heroic statesmen and heroic chattel, anddoes so quite ingenuously by both naming and not naming them in such a way thatwe are led to discover that statesmen and slaves may share the same name and beheroes and Virginians alike. Rhetoric and meaning conjoin in a verysophisticated way in this passage, thus providing us with an indication of howseriously and ambitiously Douglass will take the task of composing the rest ofthe novella.“The Heroic Slave” is divided into four parts, and in each Virginia becomes lessand less of a setting (especially of a demographic or even historical sort) andmore of a ritual ground—a “charged field” as Victor Turner would say—forsymbolic encounters between slaves and abolitionists or Virginians andVirginians. For example, in Part I [part01.html#part01], the encounter betweenMr. Listwell, our soon-to-be abolitionist, and Madison Washington, oursoon-to-be fugitive slave, takes place in a magnificent Virginia forest. Inaccord with many familiar notions regarding the transformational powers ofnature in its purest state, both men leave the sylvan glen determined andresolved to become an abolitionist and a free man respectively. Thus, theVirginia forest is established as a very particular space within the figurativegeography of the novella, one which will receive further definition as weencounter other spaces which necessarily involve very different rituals forslave and abolitionist alike and one to which we’ll return precisely because, asthe point of departure, it is the only known point of return.Part II [part02.html#part02] of “The Heroic Slave” takes place in Ohio. Listwelllives there and has the opportunity to aid an escaping slave who turns out to benone other than Madison Washington. This change in setting from Virginia to Ohioassists in the development of the Virginia theme chiefly because it givesDouglass the opportunity to stress the point that something truly happened toeach man in that “sacred” forest, one happy result being that their paths didcross once again in the cause of freedom. As Listwell and Washington conversewith each other before Listwell’s hearth, and each man tells his story ofself-transformation in the forest and what happened thereafter, we aretransported back to the forest, however briefly and indirectly. By the end ofPart II [part02.html#part02], it becomes clear in the context of the emergingnovella that Ohio, as a free state, is an increasingly symbolic state to beachieved through acts of fellowship initiated however indirectly before. Ohioand that part of Virginia which we know only as “the forest” become separate butone, much as our heroic slave and model abolitionist become separate but one asthey talk and truly hear each other.4 [ch27fn.html#ch27fn_4]In Part III [part03.html#part03], the return to Virginia and the forest is farmore direct and in keeping with the brutal realities of life in the antebellumSouth. Listwell is back in Virginia on business, and so is Washington, who hascome surreptitiously in quest of his wife still in slavery. Having portrayedVirginia’s heaven—the forest replete with pathways to freedom—Douglass nowoffers Virginia’s hell. As one might imagine, given Douglass’ zeal fortemperance and the abolition of slavery, hell is a tavern full of drunkards,knaves, and traders of human flesh. Hell’s first circle is the yard adjacent tothe tavern where slaves on their way to market are “stabled” while thesoul-driver drinks a dram. Its second circle is the remaining fifteen miles toRichmond where a slave auction awaits. The third circle may be sale to a newVirginia master and a long walk to a new plantation, or it may be a horrificre-encounter with middle passage, in the form of a “cruise” aboard aBaltimore-built slaver bound for New Orleans. If the latter, many other circlesof Hell await, for there will be another auction, another sale, another master,another long walk, and perhaps yet another auction.The point to Part III [part03.html#part03] is that while Washington has returnedto Virginia, lost his wife in their escape attempt, and been re-enslaved,Listwell is also there and able to provide the means by which Washington mayfree himself—and others. The suggestion is that it is quite one thing to aid anescaping slave in Ohio and quite another to assist one in deepest, darkestVirginia. Listwell rises to the occasion and, immediately after the slaveauction in Richmond, slips Washington several files for the chains binding him.What Washington and the rest do once on board the Creole is, of course, a matterof historical record.One might think that the fourth and last part of “The Heroic Slave” would betotally devoted to a vivid narration of swashbuckling valor aboard the highseas. This is not the case. The scene is once again Virginia; the time is setsome time after the revolt on the Creole; the place is a “Marine Coffee-house”in Richmond; and the conversation is quite provocatively between two whiteVirginia sailors, obviously neither statesmen nor slaves.5[ch27fn.html#ch27fn_5] One of the sailors had shipped on the Creole, the otherhad not. The conversation takes a sharp turn when the latter sailor, JackWilliams, makes it clear that, “For my part I [part01.html#part01] feel ashamedto have the idea go abroad, that a ship load of slaves can’t be safely takenfrom Richmond to New Orleans. I should like, merely to redeem the character ofVirginia sailors, to take charge of a ship load of ’em to-morrow” (p. 186). TomGrant, who had been on the Creole, soon replies, “I dare say here what many menfeel, but dare not speak, that this whole slave-trading business is a disgraceand scandal to Old Virginia” (pp. 186–87). The conversation goes on, and beforeit’s done, Tom Grant has indeed told the story of the revolt led by MadisonWashington.6 [ch27fn.html#ch27fn_6] The point is, however, that Tom Grant, notthe narrator, tells this story, and he does so in such a way that it is clearthat he has become a transformed man as a result of living through the episode.Thus, Douglass ends his novella by creating the dialogue between Virginiansabout the “state” of Virginia which was effectively prefigured in the novella’sfirst paragraph. The duality or doubleness of Virginia (and indeed of America)first offered as an assertion and then in the form of a riddle now assumes afull-blown literary form. More to the point, perhaps, is the fact that TomGrant—the sailor who was forced to listen, if you will, to both the speech andaction of Madison Washington—has become something of an abolitionist (though hebristles at the suggestion) and, most certainly, something of a white Southernstoryteller of a tale of black freedom. This particular aspect of Grant’stransformation is keeping with what happens to our white Northerner, Mr.Listwell. What we see here, then, is an expression within Douglass’ narrativedesign of the signal idea that freedom for slaves can transform the South andthe North and hence the nation.This brings us to Mr. Listwell, whose creation is possibly the polemical andliterary achievement of the novella. In many ways, his name is his story and hisstory his name. He is indeed a “Listwell” in that he enlists as an abolitionistand does well by the cause—in fact, he does magnificently. He is also a“Listwell” in that he listens well; he is, in the context of his relations withMadison Washington and in accord with the aesthetics of storytelling, a modelstorylistener and hence an agent, in many senses of the term, for the continuingperformance of the story he and Washington increasingly share and “tell”together. Of course, Douglass’ point is that both features of Listwell’s“listing” are connected and, ideally, inextricably bound: one cannot be a goodabolitionist without being a good listener, with the reverse often being true aswell.Douglass’ elaborate presentation of these ideas begins in Part I[part01.html#part01] of “The Heroic Slave” when Washington apostrophizes in theVirginia forest on his plight as an abject slave and unknowingly is overheard byListwell. At the end of his speech, the storyteller slave vows to gain freedomand the storylistener white Northerner vows to become an abolitionist so that hemight aid slaves such as the one he has just overheard. This is storytelling ofa sort conducted at a distance. Both storyteller and storylistener are present,and closure of a kind occurs in that both performers resolve to embark on newjourneys or careers. But, of course, the teller (slave) doesn’t know yet that hehas a listener (abolitionist, brother in the cause), and the listener doesn’tknow yet what role he will play in telling the story that has just begun. Inthis way, Douglass spins three primary narrative threads: one is thestoryteller/slave’s journey to freedom; another is thestorylistener/abolitionist’s journey to service; the third is the resolution orconsummation of purposeful human brotherhood between slave and abolitionist, asit may be most particularly achieved through the communal aesthetic ofstorytelling.In Part II [part02.html#part02], the three primary threads reappear in anadvanced state. Washington has escaped and is indeed journeying to freedom;Listwell is now a confirmed abolitionist whose references to conversations withother abolitionists suggest that he is actively involved; and Washington andListwell are indeed in the process of becoming brothers in the struggle, bothbecause they befriend each other on a cold night and because, once settledbefore Listwell’s fire, they engage for long hours in storytelling. Severalfeatures of their storytelling are worth remarking upon. One is that Washington,as the storyteller, actually tells two stories about his adventures in theVirginia forest, one about a thwarted escape attempt and the resulting limbo heenters while neither slave nor free, and the other about how he finally breaksout of limbo, reasserting his desire for freedom.7 [ch27fn.html#ch27fn_7] Theimportance of this feature is that it occasions a repetition of the novella’s“primary” forest episode which creates in turn a narrative rhythm which wecommonly associate with oral storytelling. While it would be stretching thingsto say that this is an African residual in the novella, we are on safe ground,however, in suggesting that in creating this particular episode Douglass isdrawing deeply on his knowledge of storytelling amongst slaves.Another pertinent feature is that Listwell, as the storylistener, is both a goodlistener and, increasingly, a good prompter of Washington’s stories. Early on,Listwell says, “But this was five years ago; where have you been since?”Washington replies, “I will try to tell you,” and to be sure storytellingensues. Other examples of this abound. In one notable instance, in response toWashington’s explanation as to why he stole food while in flight, Listwellasserts, “And just there you were right…. I once had doubts on this pointmyself, but a conversation with Gerrit Smith, (a man, by the way, that I wishyou could see, for he is a devoted friend of your race, and I know he wouldreceive you gladly,) put an end to all my doubts on this point. But do not letme interrupt you” (p. 160). Listwell interrupts, but his is what we might call agood interruption, for he authenticates the slave’s rationale for stealinginstead of questioning it. In this way, Listwell’s remarks advance both storyand cause, which is exactly what he’s supposed to do now that he’s anabolitionist.8 [ch27fn.html#ch27fn_8]Resolution of this episode takes the form of a letter from Washington toListwell, written in Canada a few short days after both men have told storiesinto the night. It begins, “My dear Friend,—for such you truly are:— … Madisonis out of the woods at last….” The language here takes us back to the initialencounter in the Virginia forest between Washington and Listwell,—back to a timewhen they weren’t acquaintances, let alone friends—nor on their respectivejourneys to freedom and service. In examining the essential differences betweenWashington’s apostrophe to no apparent listener and his warm letter to a dearfriend, we are drawn to the fact that in each case, a simple voice cries out,but in the second instance a listener is not only addressed but remembered andhence recreated. The great effect is that a former slave’s conventional token offreedom and literacy bound and found in Canada takes on certain indeliblestorytelling properties.From this point on in “The Heroic Slave” little more needs to be establishedbetween Washington and Listwell, either as fugitive slave and abolitionist or asstoryteller and listener, except the all important point that their bond is trueand that Listwell will indeed come to Washington’s aid in Virginia just aspromptly as he did before in the North. In a sense their story is over, but inanother respect it isn’t: there remains the issue, endemic to both oral andwritten art, of how their story will live on with full flavor and purpose. Onone hand, the story told by Washington and Listwell lives on in a direct,apparent way in the rebellion aboard the Creole, the resulting dialogue betweenthe two Virginia sailors who debate the state of their State, and thetransformation of one of the sailors, Tom Grant, into a teller of the story. Onthe other, the story lives on in another way which draws the seemingly distantnarrator into the communal bonds of storytelling and the cause.Late in the novella, in Part III [part03.html#part03], the narrator employs thephrase “Mr. Listwell says” and soon thereafter refers to Listwell as “ourinformant.” These phrases suggest rather clearly that Listwell has told hisshared tale to the narrator and that he has thus been a storyteller as well as astorylistener all along. The other point to be made is, of course, that thenarrator has been at some earlier point a good storylistener, meaning in partthat he can now tell a slave’s tale well because he was willing to hear itbefore making it his own tale to tell. What’s remarkable about this narrativestrategy is how it serves Douglass’ needs both as a novelist and as a blackpublic figure under pressure. Here was a theory of narrative distilled from therelations between tellers and listeners in the black and white worlds Douglassknew best; here was an answer to all who cried, “Frederick, tell your story”—andthen couldn’t or wouldn’t hear him."},{"pageContent":"1.

Douglass himself plants this idea whenhe remarks in “Slavery, the Slumbering Volcano” that Washington debated withGurney how advisable it would be to attempt to rescue his wife from slavery. [Aselection from that speech, also called “Address at the Great Anti-ColonizationMeeting,” is included in this volume. Eds.]5. [ch27.html#ch27fn-5] Placing the sailors in a “Marine Coffee-house” ispossibly both an awkward and a revealing touch. To be sure, such establishmentsexisted, but one cannot help but feel that a tavern would be a more “natural”setting. The braggadocio and general belligerence of Jack Williams, for example,suggest the behavior of a man whose cup contains a headier brew than coffee ortea. Of course, the problem for Douglass was that, given his advocacy oftemperance, he could not easily situate Tom Grant, the reformed sailor and avoice of reason, in one of the Devil’s haunts. This is quite likely an instancewhere Douglass’ politics and penchant for realism conflicted in a way he had notencountered before he attempted prose fiction.6. [ch27.html#ch27fn-6] Early in Part IV, Tom Grant is referred to as “our firstmate” (p. 185). This suggests that Grant is loosely modeled upon ZephaniahGifford, the actual first mate of the Creole. Gifford gave many depositions onthe revolt and hence told Washington’s story many times. See Howard Jones, “ThePeculiar Institution and National Honor: The Case of the Creole Slave Revolt,”Civil War History, 21 (March 1975), pp. 34 ff.7. [ch27.html#ch27fn-7] These two stories of immersion in and ascent from a kindof limbo are central to the history of Afro-American letters, chiefly becausethey so conspicuously prefigure the trope of hibernation most accessible to themodern reader in Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, published almost exactly onehundred years later. Madison Washington’s cave in the realm between theplantation and the world beyond—”In the dismal swamps I lived, sir, five longyears,—a cave for my home during day. I wandered at night with the wolf and thebear,—sustained by the promise that my good Susan would meet me in the pinewoods, at least once a week”—anticipates the Invisible Man’s hole in the regionbetween black and white Manhattan. Once Washington’s wolf and bear become in themind’s eye, brer wolf and brer bear, this particular contour in Afro-Americanliterary history is visible and complete.8. [ch27.html#ch27fn-8] This brief and seemingly utilitarian passage in thenovella becomes remarkable when one realizes that Douglass is also about thetask of composing a salute or “praise song” for a new friend in the cause,Gerrit Smith. “The Heroic Slave,” we must recall, was Douglass’ contribution toan anthology collected for the purposes of raising funds for the newlyestablished Frederick Douglass’ Paper. The Paper was created when Douglass’North Star merged with Gerrit Smith’s Liberty Party Paper and Smith committedhimself to subsidizing the new publication. Listwell’s praise of Smith in thenovella is, in effect, both a tribute and a “thank you note” from Douglass tohis new business partner. And it is something else as well: praise for Smith andnot, say, Garrison is a clear signal from Douglass that he has broken with theGarrisonian abolitionists and aligned himself with new friends. His praise forSmith took an even grander form when Douglass dedicated My Bondage and MyFreedom: “To Honorable Gerrit Smith, as a slight token of esteem for hischaracter, admiration for his genius and benevolence, affection for his person,and gratitude for his friendship, and as a small but most sincere acknowledgmentof his pre-eminent services in behalf of the rights and liberties of anafflicted, despised and deeply outraged people, by ranking slavery with piracyand murder, and by denying it either a legal or constitutional existence, thisvolume is respectfully dedicated, by his faithful and firmly attached friend,Frederick Douglass.” The doffing of the cap in “The Heroic Slave” became, withintwo years, a full and reverent bow."},{"pageContent":"WILLIAM L. ANDREWSFROM “THE NOVELIZATION OF VOICE IN EARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN NARRATIVE”1[ch28fn.html#ch28fn_1]In June 1842 the Liberator published what it called “Madison Washington: AnotherChapter in His History,” in which it brought a few new facts to light aboutWashington’s activities before the Creole affair. The Liberator cited a messagefrom a Canadian abolitionist, Hiram Wilson, who said Washington had been livingin Canada for “some time” while planning a trip to Virginia to rescue hisenslaved wife. There was evidence from abolitionists in New York who had givenWashington money to defray his expenses on his journey south. But as to what hadhappened when the black man arrived in Virginia, the Liberator could onlyspeculate. It inferred that in the process of trying to free his wife,Washington had been apprehended and “sold for New-Orleans,” an explanation thatwould account for why he was part of the human cargo of the New Orleans–boundCreole. But what about the fate of his wife? The Liberator remembered from thedepositions of a year earlier that the discovery of Washington in the slavewomen’s cabin had led to the first violent acts of the slave revolt. “Might nothis wife have been there among the women?” And if so, might not the entireinsurrection “prove to have been but part of that great game, in which thehighest stake was the liberty of [Washington’s] dear wife?” Clearly, a romanticdimension to Washington’s story was something the Liberator wanted to read intothe scanty facts it had amassed about his pre-Creole past. This effort by theLiberator to infer a romantic plot underlying the Creole incidents testifies tothe strong desire of American abolitionism for a story, if not the story, aboutWashington that would realize him as a powerful symbol of black antislaveryheroism.In speeches during the late 1840s Douglass did his part to keep the memory ofMadison Washington alive. But it was not until passage of the Fugitive Slave Lawin 1850 that Douglass became sufficiently militant on the justifiability ofviolence against slaveholders to treat Washington as the epitome of the “heroicslave.” Still, Douglass could not write a narrative tribute to Washingtonwithout facing the problem that the Liberator had posed a decade before: how tomake a “history” of the fragmentary information available on Washington. Tenfruitless years had passed since the Liberator asked that someone get the factsabout Washington in the conventional way, in a narrative “from his own lips.” Itmust have become plain to Douglass that for the example of Washington ever to beexploited in antislavery discourse, someone else would have to do Washington’snarrating for him. But in order for there to be any narrating, there would haveto be a story of Washington to tell. Without a story that explained andjustified the climactic action on the Creole, that action would lose much of itspower to dictate the terms of its own interpretation. Thus the task of thenarrator of The Heroic Slave became primarily to make Washington narratable, toempower in and through an authenticating story, in a history, that whichWashington truly represented—the revolutionary, not the blindly rampaging,slave.Douglass’s approach to the problem of how to make Washington a part of historywas novel. He made the lack of knowledge about Washington, as opposed to thewealth of historical information about other champions of liberty from Virginia,the gambit of his text. Unlike typical slave narrators, who promised the readerfacts based on the most intimate knowledge of their subjects, the narrator ofThe Heroic Slave promises his reader only “marks, traces, possibles, andprobabilities” relating to a subject that “is still enveloped in darkness”(474). The identity of the subject of The Heroic Slave is not specified in theopening paragraphs of the text. The only biographical fact brought out about theunnamed slave in question is that he is Virginia-born. Like the illustriousPatrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington, all the “great ones ofthe Old Dominion” whose names and deeds have been emblazoned in “Americanannals,” this unnamed slave was “a man who loved liberty.” And yet while“history has not been sparing in recording their names,” the slave’s name “livesnow only in the chattel records of his native State.”There could be no more apt way for the first fictive narrator in AfricanAmerican literature to establish intercourse with his white reading audience.What sort of authority should be granted to your “history,” he asks, if itcelebrates as heroes of liberty slave owners like Henry and Washington whileignoring a slave who “deserved” and “fought for” his liberty every bit asheroically as these men did? To what sources must we go to find the real“history” of the struggle for freedom in Virginia? As long as freedom-lovingslaves exist only in records of chattel, they will be disqualified from theirrightful place in “history,” the authoritative record of people of consequence.Obviously then, the aim of the narrator of The Heroic Slave is first to liberatehis slave hero from all the records that chattelize him and then to make him apart of history so that his real significance as a son of Virginia can berecognized.Since the “chattel records” are necessarily commodified and hence perverse andincomplete, the narrator who would do this service to Virginia history must“command the pen of genius.” Instead of simply recording the known, he mustpenetrate the unknown, the “marks, traces, possibles, and probabilities” left bythe fragmentary “chattel records.” The narrator of The Heroic Slave does not goso far as to say that the “genius” he will employ will be that of the novelist,but one cannot escape this implication, nor does the narrator want the reader tomiss it. If, in writing the history of a slave the narrator is compelled tocreate what might be called a “fiction of factual representation” (White 121),he wants it clear that Virginia’s “chattel records” leave him no alternative. Tohistoricize, to realize this son of Virginia in history, it is necessary tofictionalize him. The entire narrative enterprise of The Heroic Slave rests onthe reader’s accepting the paradoxical necessity of the fictiveness ofWashington’s history.As a storyteller, the narrator of The Heroic Slave plays a number of roles afterjustifying the fictiveness of his work. Because Robert B. Stepto has given closeattention to the storytelling dimension of Douglass’s text, I do not devote moreof my discussion to it here. Suffice it to say that after the introduction tothe story, the narrator makes no effort to authenticate any specific contentionmade about Washington in the rest of the narrative. The narrator offers no meansof distinguishing between facts, “possibles,” and “probabilities.” Bystructuring the story around speeches that he seems merely to report verbatim tothe reader, the narrator gives the narration an appearance of objectivity. Ashis source for most of the speeches and much of the behavior of Washington, henames a Mr. Listwell, whom he also claims as a personal acquaintance. Thisdisclosure lends to the narration of the first three parts of the text aconsistent and plausible point of view. We seem to be reading one of thosenarratives “told by X [Listwell] to Y [the narrator] apropos of Z [Washington]”that make up “the very fabric of our ‘experience’” in the real world (Genette239).2 [ch28fn.html#ch28fn_2] In ways like these, the narrator of The HeroicSlave tries to make Washington’s story sound objectively told without holdinghimself accountable for the authenticity of anything in particular said by orabout Washington.In taking these steps to objectify the narrating of The Heroic Slave, Douglassfinesses the problem of authenticating what that narrating voice actually says.Unlike in the traditional slave narrative, which predicates the narrator’sauthority on authentication provided by the facts in the text or thetestimonials that preface and append the text, in The Heroic Slave the authorityof the narrator is insisted on from the start by him alone. Indeed, his right totell his story in his own way, free from the obligation to limit himself only tothe few facts available to him, is insisted on before any narrating actuallytakes place. Herein lies the fundamental importance of The Heroic Slave to theevolution of African American narrative from “natural” to “fictive” discourse:priority in The Heroic Slave is given to the empowering of a mode of fictivediscourse whose authority does not depend on the authentication of what isasserted in that discourse. The authority of fictive discourse in AfricanAmerican narrative depends on a sabotaging of the presumed authoritativeplenitude of history as “natural” discourse so that the right of the fictive tosupplement (that is, to subvert) “history” can be declared and then exploited.WORKS CITEDDouglass, Frederick. “The Heroic Slave.” The Life and Writings of FrederickDouglass.

Inhis 1845 narrative, critics have noted, he downplays the role played by femaleslaves in his life. As David Leverenz points out, Douglass’s wife, Anna, “seemsan afterthought. He introduces her to his readers as a rather startlingappendage to his escape and marries her almost in the same breath.”4[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_4] At first glance, Douglass’s treatment of black women in“The Heroic Slave” would appear to differ considerably from that in hisnarrative. Not only does Madison allude frequently to his wife, Susan, but it isher support that enables him to hide in the wilderness for five years. Inaddition, he is recaptured after his successful flight from slavery because hedecides to return to Virginia to rescue her. However, not only do we receive nodescription of Susan whatsoever but, more significantly, she is renderedvoiceless in a text marked, as Henry Louis Gates notes, by “a major emphasis onthe powers of the human voice,” on the potency of speech acts.5[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_5] Finally, Douglass has Susan murdered during her attemptto escape with her husband. Her disappearance from the text at this point simplyreinforces Washington’s heroic isolation.One way to appreciate fully the strategies underlying the characterization ofMadison Washington in “The Heroic Slave” is to compare the novella not just withDouglass’s own comments in his 1849 speech6 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_6] but withthree other literary dramatizations of the incident—by William Wells Brown in1863, by Lydia Maria Child in 1866, and by Pauline E. Hopkins in 1901.7[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_7] The most significant ways in which Brown, Child, andHopkins revise Douglass’s rendering of the Creole revolt involve the handling ofviolence in the story, the depiction of Susan, Madison’s wife, and the role ofwhites.8 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_8]First, Brown, Child, and Hopkins all treat Madison Washington’s violence moredirectly than does Douglass in “The Heroic Slave.” In describing Washington’srecapture, for example, Brown does not qualify the slave’s fierce resistance:Observed by the overseer, … the fugitive [was] secured ere he could escape withhis wife; but the heroic slave did not yield until he with a club had laid threeof his assailants upon the ground with his manly blows; and not then untilweakened by loss of blood.9 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_9]In depicting the revolt itself, both Brown and Douglass stress Washington’sdetermination to shed no more blood than is absolutely necessary. However, Browndiffers sharply from Douglass by locating his hero at the very center of theviolence:Drawing his old horse pistol from under his coat, he [a white “negro-driver”]fired at one of the blacks and killed him. The next moment [he] lay dead uponthe deck, for Madison had struck him with a capstan bar…. The battle wasMadison’s element, and he plunged into it without any care for his ownpreservation or safety. He was an instrument of enthusiasm, whose value andwhose place was in his inspiration. “If the fire of heaven was in my hands, Iwould throw it at these cowardly whites,” said he to his companions, beforeleaving their cabin. But in this he did not mean revenge, only the possession ofhis freedom and that of his fellow-slaves. Merritt and Gifford, the first andsecond mates of the vessel, both attacked the heroic slave at the same time.Both were stretched out upon the deck with a single blow each, but were merelywounded; they were disabled, and that was all that Madison cared for for thetime being.10 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_10]Like Douglass in “The Heroic Slave,” Brown, Child, and Hopkins all portrayMadison Washington as a superman, but their hero is one whose strength, courage,and power find unmistakably violent outlet.In their treatment of Susan, Madison’s wife, Brown, Child, and Hopkins againrevise Douglass quite extensively. In contrast to the faceless character weencounter in “The Heroic Slave,” William Wells Brown’s Susan receives an evenmore elaborate description than does Washington himself:In the other cabin, among the slave women, was one whose beauty at onceattracted attention. Though not tall, she yet had a majestic figure. Herwell-moulded shoulders, prominent bust, black hair which hung in ringlets, mildblue eyes, finely-chiselled mouth, with a splendid set of teeth, a turned andwell-rounded chin, skin marbled with the animation of life, and veined by bloodgiven to her by her master, she stood as the representative of two races. Withonly one eighth of African, she was what is called at the south an “octoroon.”It was said that her grandfather had served his country in the revolutionarywar, as well as in both houses of Congress. This was Susan, the wife ofMadison.11 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_11]Furthermore, Brown arranges for Susan to be among the freed blacks when herhusband takes over the Creole. Susan’s death before the revolt in “The HeroicSlave” reflects both Douglass’s lack of interest in incorporating a sentimentalreunion into his happy ending and his conception of Washington as an isolatedmale protagonist. In Brown’s vision of Washington’s successful heroic action,liberation leads to a restoration of the integrity of the domestic circle, theblack family unit; in Douglass’s, it does not.12 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_12]Although similar in phrasing to Brown’s, Child’s depiction of Susan manifests anadded concern with the beautiful slave as the embodiment of endangeredwomanhood. Child describes Susan’s peculiar plight this way: “[A] handsomewoman, who is a slave, is constantly liable to insult and wrong, from which anenslaved husband has no power to protect her.”13 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_13]Hopkins, in turn, both corrects and elaborates on Child’s comment not only byshowing that Madison Monroe (as she calls her hero) does, in fact, save his wifefrom sexual assault but also by making Susan almost as much the protagonist ofthe story as Madison. In Hopkins’s rendering, most of the drama on board theCreole centers not on the revolt but on the white captain’s attempted rape ofSusan, which coincidentally occurs on the same night that Madison has plannedhis uprising.14 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_14] Even the syntax of the emotional reunionscene reinforces Hopkins’s focus on Susan: “She was locked to his breast; sheclung to him convulsively. Unnerved at last by the revulsion to more than reliefand ecstasy, she broke into wild sobs, while the astonished company closedaround them with loud hurrahs.”15 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_15] On the one hand,Hopkins implicitly rejects Douglass’s obsession with masculine heroism as shegives Susan not only a voice in the text but also force—the first act of blackviolent resistance aboard the Creole is Susan’s striking the white captain whenhe kisses her in her sleep. On the other hand, by having Madison fortuitouslyappear and interrupt the assault on Susan like some white knight rushing to theaid of his damsel, Hopkins ultimately falls back on the conventions of thesentimental romance. Hopkins does succeed in reinserting the black female into afield of action dominated, in Douglass’s fiction, by the male. However, inclaiming for Susan a conventional role generally denied black women, shenecessarily endorses the accompanying male paradigm in her depiction of Madison,a paradigm drawn from the same set of gender constructions that providesDouglass with his heroic model.Finally, of the four versions of the Creole incident under consideration here,Douglass’s places the greatest emphasis upon the role played by whites in theprotagonist’s life. Granted, for much of “The Heroic Slave,” Madison Washingtonis the epitome of manly self-reliance. At key points in the text, however,Douglass qualifies the isolated nature of the protagonist’s liberatory strugglenot by creating ties between Madison and a black community but rather bydeveloping a close relationship between Washington and a white northerner namedListwell. As Robert Stepto suggests, Douglass probably modeled Listwell on theabolitionist James Gurney.16 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_16] Yet, Douglass claims in his1849 speech on the Creole incident, another abolitionist, Robert Purvis, alsoplayed an important role as Washington’s friend and advisor. Douglass’s decisionto incorporate the white Gurney and not the black Purvis into his story reflectshis desire to reach and move white readers. Like George Harris’s formeremployer, Mr. Wilson, in Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Listwell gives the white audience afigure with whom to identify; as Listwell comes to endorse Washington’sbehavior—to evolve literally before our eyes into an abolitionist—Douglass hopesthat the white reader will too.In none of the three later versions of the revolt do we encounter a whitecharacter who plays the central role that Listwell does in “The Heroic Slave.”Brown, Child, and Hopkins all depict a sympathetic white named Dickson, whoemploys Madison after he first escapes; but there is no great intimacy betweenthe men. Furthermore, whereas Douglass has Listwell slip Washington the filesand saws that he subsequently uses to free himself and his fellow slaves onboard the Creole, Brown, Child, and Hopkins each tells us that Madison obtainsthese implements on his own, before he returns to Virginia in the ill-fatedattempt to free his wife. By having Listwell provide Washington with the meansof his escape, Douglass doubtless intends the white audience to see that theyshould not only sympathize with the slaves’ plight but work actively to helpthem gain their freedom. As a result, however, he implies that even the mostself-reliant and gifted black male slave needs white assistance.In composing “The Heroic Slave,” Frederick Douglass could have easily taken astrictly documentary approach. The unadorned story of Madison Washington’sexploits certainly contained sufficient drama and courageous action to hold anaudience. Moreover, Douglass’s writing to that point had been primarilyjournalistic; the novella would have hardly seemed the form with which he wouldhave felt most comfortable. In depicting Washington in fiction, however,Douglass ambitiously set out to do more than demonstrate the slave’sdetermination to be free; he sought to transform his black male protagonist intoa heroic exemplar who would both win white converts to the antislavery struggleand firmly establish the reality of black manhood. The route that Douglass chosein order to achieve these goals was to master the codes of Anglo-Americanbourgeois white masculinity, and his own internalization of the values informingmainstream masculine paradigms made this strategy relatively easy to adopt. Inaddition, as Robert Stepto observes, the act of fictionalizing this story ofsuccessful violent male resistance to slavery offered Douglass the opportunitynot only to express his ideological independence from Garrison but also topresent a potent alternative to the model of the black male hero as victimpromoted so successfully in Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin.17 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_17]Ultimately, however, Douglass’s ambitious agenda was undermined by his intuitivesense that he could challenge white preconceptions regarding race only so farwithout alienating the audience that he sought to win and by problems inherentin the masculine ideal that he so eagerly endorsed.Douglass’s strategies for appealing to white readers in “The Heroic Slave” wereflawed in at least three important ways. The first involves the extent to whichhis representation of Madison Washington as the embodiment of black manhoodinevitably emphasizes the distance between his hero and the average slave. Incelebrating this unusually self-aware, courageous, aggressive, conventionallyeducated, and charismatic figure, Douglass never explains his attractivecapacities in terms that would encourage the reader to extrapolate a generalsense of the black potential for heroic action from the extraordinarily endowedWashington. The gap between Douglass’s protagonist and less gifted blacks iswidened even further by the presence of Listwell. That the one character bothemotionally and intellectually closest to Washington is white indicates theextent to which Madison’s strengths and capabilities, training, and mannerdistinguish him from other slaves and thereby weaken his usefulness as acounterargument against claims that most blacks were inferior to whites.A second problem derives from Douglass’s attempt, in William Andrews’s words,“to domesticate a violence that easily could have been judged as alien andthreatening to everything from Christian morality to the law of the highseas.”18 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_18] Employing a common abolitionist gambit,Douglass works to establish a link between Washington’s rebellion and theAmerican War of Independence. However, doing so, Andrews contends, precipitatesDouglass and other antislavery writers into a troublesome conceptual trap: “Evenas they violate the ideals of Uncle Tom’s pacifism and declare blacks free frombloodguiltiness for killing their masters, they justify such actions by anappeal to the authorizing mythology of an oppressive culture.”19[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_19] That is, the very figures whose patriotic heritageDouglass claims for his hero won their fame by working to establish a socialorder in which the enslavement of blacks like Madison was a crucial component.In his careful packaging of Washington’s manly heroism, Douglass also choosesnot to dramatize a single act of physical violence performed by his protagonist.One might argue that this approach reinforces the statesmanlike quality thatDouglass may have been striving to imbue in his portrayal of Washington—afterall, how often do depictions (literary and otherwise) of George Washington fullyconvey the violent nature of his heroism? Ultimately, however, Douglass’scaution here strips his fictional slave rebel of much of his radical, subversiveforce. As Douglass knew from personal experience, revolution usually entailsviolence, and black self-assertion in the face of racist attempts atdehumanization often necessitates a direct and forceful assault upon the verystructures of social power that provide most whites (especially white males)with a sense of self-worth, security, and potency.In his public statements regarding the Creole revolt both before and after hewrote “The Heroic Slave,” Douglass apparently felt little need to undermine theimplications of the black militancy that Madison Washington embodied. We havealready examined his celebration of Washington’s heroism in his 1849 speech.20[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_20] In commenting on West Indian emancipation eight yearslater, Douglass goes even further:Joseph Cinque on the deck of the Amistad, did that which should make his namedear to us. He bore nature’s burning protest against slavery. Madison Washingtonwho struck down his oppressor on the deck of the Creole, is more worthy to beremembered than the colored man who shot Pitcairn at Bunker Hill.21[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_21]Granted, the exhaustion of Douglass’s patience with the limited efficacy ofmoral suasion as an antislavery tactic surely informs this quite remarkablerepudiation of the popular appeal to an American patriotic past as a way tovalidate black slave violence. I would argue, however, that there was somethingabout the mode of fiction itself (and possibly about autobiography as well) thatstifled the radical nature of Douglass’s anger. The “controlled aggression” thatDonald Gibson sees as informing every aspect of Douglass’s Narrative underliesthe depiction of Madison Washington in “The Heroic Slave” as well.22[ch29fn.html#ch29fn_22] The key may lie in what Houston Baker describes as the“task of transmuting an authentic, unwritten self—a self that exists outside theconventional literary discourse structure of a white reading public—into aliterary representation.” Baker continues: “The simplest, and perhaps the mosteffective, way of proceeding is for the narrator to represent his ‘authentic’self as a figure embodying the public virtues and values esteemed by hisintended audience.”23 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_23] Baker’s argument applies withparticular force to “The Heroic Slave,” for it appears that the freer rein theform offered Douglass in his depiction of the exemplary black male heroparadoxically also confronted him more directly than possibly ever before withthe restrictions imposed by the expectations of the whites to whom he wasappealing.The third weakness in his attempt to use fiction to shape his white reader’sattitudes toward slavery is structural in nature. That is, by rendering theCreole revolt through the recollections of a white sailor, Douglass cuts us offnot just from Washington’s heroic violence but from his emotional responses tothe dramatic events in which he plays such a crucial part. William Wells Brown’sstraightforward depiction of Washington’s rebellious behavior in his sketchdramatizes by contrast the extent to which Madison’s role in “The Heroic Slave”is primarily catalytic, as Douglass emphasizes through shifts in point of viewhis impact upon the whites around him. Such elaborate formal manipulationsresult in what Raymond Hedin terms “an emphatically structured fiction,” whichserves to convey a sense of the writer’s control and thus to permit a release ofanger in a rational and somewhat unthreatening manner.24 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_24]As one result of this strategy, at the end of the novella Washington stands notas the embodiment of expressive, forceful self-determination, but as an objectof white discourse, a figure whose self-assertive drive to tell his own story—toreclaim, in a sense, his own subjectivity—is ultimately subordinated by Douglassto a secondhand rendition by a white sailor who did not even witness the fullrange of Washington’s heroic action. This decentering of the black voice in “TheHeroic Slave” may be the greatest casualty of Douglass’s polemical appeal towhite sympathies.Finally, like the majority of nineteenth-century black spokespersons, Douglasswas unable or unwilling to call into question the white bourgeois paradigm ofmanhood itself. Consequently, his celebration of black heroism was subvertedfrom the outset by the racist, sexist, and elitist assumptions upon which theAngle-American male ideal was constructed and that so thoroughly permeated thepatriarchal structure of slavery. As Valerie Smith points out, “Within hiscritique of American cultural practices, then, is an affirmation of itsdefinitions of manhood and power.” That is, “Douglass … attempts to articulate aradical position using the discourse he shares with those against whom hespeaks. What begins as an indictment of mainstream practice actuallyauthenticates one of its fundamental assumptions.”25 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_25] Itshould go without saying that one can scarcely imagine how Douglass might haveextricated himself from the conceptual briar patch into which he had fallen,given both the political purposes to which he directed his fiction and theextent to which he sought validation in the most conventional, gender-specificterms for himself in particular and for black men in general from a whitesociety unwilling to acknowledge the complex humanity of blacks in anyunqualified way. The dilemma so powerfully rendered in Douglass’s attempt todramatize the Madison Washington story in fiction is one that has plagued mostAfro-American fiction writers—and, indeed, most Afro-American thinkers—over thepast century and a half.26 [ch29fn.html#ch29fn_26] His failures do not qualifythe boldness of his attempt, and one can argue that the short-term benefits ofhis approach must be taken into account in assessing the overall success of hisenterprise. Ultimately, however, Douglass’s “The Heroic Slave” may be mostvaluable insofar as it enables us to understand better the complex internal andexternal obstacles to a balanced, complex depiction of black men and women inAfro-American fiction. If nothing else, it leaves us wondering whether the toolsof the master can ever be used to achieve the complete liberation of the slave."},{"pageContent":"1.

For example, Brown’s description of Washington is farmore ethnically specific than Douglass’s: “Born of African parentage, with nomixture in his blood, he was one of the handsomest of his race” (Brown,“Washington,” 75). This emphasis on Washington’s African background recallsBrown’s treatment of Jerome in the 1864 Clotelle, A Tale of the Southern States,published one year after The Black Man appeared. It must be noted that there areseveral instances where Brown, Child, and Hopkins employ remarkably similarphrasing. Brown had appropriated material from Child before, in the firstedition of Clotel (1853). There is evidence of extensive borrowing here aswell—either by Brown from an earlier version of Child’s sketch or by Child fromBrown’s in The Black Man, or by both Brown and Child from an earlier text byanother writer…. Pauline Hopkins was familiar with the work of both Brown (whomshe had met personally) and Child, and thus would likely have encountered theirversions of the Creole revolt.

This transformation worked toconvince Douglass’s resisting readers that whatever negative connotations theymay have associated with Washington’s “blackness” insignificantly compare withhis bravery, eloquence, willingness to die for liberty, moral restraint, andrationality. I suggest that the principal factor determining whether or not theyheard his implicit call for abolition, and accepted his assertion that “we havedone that which you applaud your fathers for doing,” depended upon whether ornot they found his display of masculinity compelling.2 [ch30fn.html#ch30fn_2]In order to grasp why masculinity was so important, we need to recall that themost obvious, yet the most fundamental feature of the revolutionary republicansubject was masculine gender. At the time of the Revolution, this subject didnot have an explicit class or racial marking, although material conditions andsocial, political, and economic practices determined that typically elite men ofEuropean descent were authorized by what Locke called “Political Power.” Classand slavery were masked by the apparently universal address to “all men,” andrace had not yet come to play the central ideological role that it would in thenineteenth century. Douglass appropriated a late-eighteenth-century notion ofmanhood, or republican male virtue, characterized by bravery, eloquence, moralrestraint, concern for the common good, and a willingness to die for liberty,and transported it into a different historical context, a different social andpolitical field in which racial difference had become one of the most salientways of signifying relations of power. Like other political orators and writersof his own time, Douglass chose for his heroic model not nineteenth-centurynation-builders like Andrew Jackson or Zachary Taylor, or unionists like DanielWebster and Henry Clay, but republican revolutionaries. Antebellum politicalrhetoric instead favored Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington.But by connecting their known history with the activities of an enslaved man,the opening paragraph of The Heroic Slave challenges the legal, social, andeconomic strategies of dominant groups that defined the national politicalcommunity—the inheritors and rightful claimants of the rhetoric of theRevolution—as free, white, and male. This definition denied authorization toslave rebellion, as Douglass points out:The state of Virginia is famous in American annals for the multitudinous arrayof her statesmen and heroes…. History has not been sparing in recording theirnames, or in blazoning their deeds…. By some strange neglect, one of the truest,manliest, and bravest of her children … a man who loved liberty as well as didPatrick Henry,—who deserved it as much as Thomas Jefferson,—and who fought forit with a valor as high, an arm as strong, and against odds as great, as he wholed all the armies of the American colonies through the great war for freedomand independence, lives now only in the chattel records of his native State.(25)In creating this connection, this passage asserts that the revolutionaryalliance was inherently contradictory because it did not include enslaved peoplefrom the Southern colonies, and it suggests a newly configured alliance.Rather than a founding father in blackface, Douglass’s Madison Washingtonconstituted a new position based on masculine gender, which asserted as morefundamental than racial difference or differences in class or status, gendersolidarity among men.3 [ch30fn.html#ch30fn_3] From this position, Douglassasserted a new meaning for revolutionary rhetoric, not simply the abolition ofU.S. slavery, but the equivalence of the struggle of enslaved men with that ofthe republic’s masculine founders. Like other political abolitionists, thismeaning recast the Revolution as an arrested struggle for general emancipation.But this interpretation also challenged those paternalistic white abolitionistswho recognized slavery as evil and anti-Christian, but who did not imagineslaves or African Americans more generally as equal members of the nationalcommunity.This challenge presents the possibility of a new national alliance, based on acommon masculinity, one that includes the founders and those slave rebels whohave broken their fetters and claimed their freedom.4 [ch30fn.html#ch30fn_4]This alliance does not “accurately” portray the founders, in that although manyof them were aware of a theoretical contradiction between their fight for theirown liberty and their status as slaveholders, most did little during theirlifetimes actually either to bring about abolition or to emancipate their ownslaves. Rather Douglass’s (re)vision centralizes what enslaved people andabolitionists considered most valuable and laudable in the Revolution, andmarginalizes those acts of the founders that they considered worthless. Thisrhetorical strategy reimagines the history of the Revolution in the service of aradical agenda, one that projects not just freedom for British colonists, butequality for enslaved men as the goal of the original fight for liberty.The Heroic Slave develops this argument by asserting that the Virginia of 1841,now an immoral and deteriorating society, differs dramatically from the Virginiaof the founders. At the beginning of part 3 [part03.html#part03], the narratordescribes the following scene:Just upon the edge of the great road from Petersburg, Virginia, to Richmond, …there stands a somewhat ancient and famous public tavern, quite notorious in itsbetter days…. Its fine old portico looks well at a distance, and gives thebuilding an air of grandeur. A nearer view, however, does little to sustain thisimpression…. The gloomy mantle of ruin is, already, out-spread to envelop it,and its remains, even but now remind one of a human skull, after the flesh hasmingled with the earth. (47)The “fine old portico” with its “air of grandeur,” actually decays at the core,no more than a covering for a fleshless skull. This condition results, onelearns several pages later, from a change in the state’s economic interest,since “almost all other business in Virginia [has been] dropped to engage in[the slave trade]” (50). By juxtaposing past and present, this image undercutsthe authority of those present-day sons of Virginia who trade in human flesh,while simultaneously renovating the memory of the revolutionary fathers. Thisdescription metaphorically represents the festering contradiction at the heartof the republic, the result of slavery in a supposedly free society.Although Douglass self-consciously characterizes The Heroic Slave as createdfrom “marks, traces, possibles, and probabilities” (25–26)—all that the Creolearchive provides him with—he also presents the story as more trustworthy thanthe annals of history because it more accurately mirrors the text’s notion ofthe founders’ true ideals. The text describes the tavern’s inhabitants, forexample, as “hangers-on” and “corrupt tongues” whose stories are not recordedbecause they only tell “of quarrels, fights, recontes, and duels,” and are fullof “vulgarity and dark profanity” (52). The text’s reference to these unrecordedstories asserts simultaneously the irrelevance of the tavern’s inhabitants’stories and the greater significance of the one the text tells. Rather than areason to question the validity of the narrative presented, thisself-consciousness indicts dominant systems of record keeping and historymaking, thereby undermining systems of evaluation that separate MadisonWashington from James Madison and George Washington. Taken altogether, thetavern passages and the references to the scarcity of historical data representMadison Washington as a more rightful heir of the legacy of Old Virginia thanthose currently in power; the demise of the tavern and its inhabitants makesspace for, even calls for, the emergence of a new order.WORKS CITEDDouglass, Frederick.

He offered a critique of white interpretationswhich positioned the black male slave body as the most accurate measure ofindividual experience by emphasizing the additional importance of language inrepresentations of black male consciousness. Douglass’s structural compositionof The Heroic Slave demonstrates the complex narrative processes by which hedisplays and (re)presents the black male body. Overall, he resists itsstraightforward appropriation as an object for consumption by a white audienceby reclaiming the importance of the black male body as symbolic, rhetoricalfigure. He juxtaposes the physical spectacle of the slave with a superlativeperformance of black male intellectual prowess in Madison Washington’s exemplarycommand of language.While Madison is conventionally feminized in his rhetorical speech, ‘I neitherrun nor fight, but do meanly stand, answering each heavy blow of a cruel masterwith doleful wails and piteous cries’;2 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_2] upon his decisionto have ‘Liberty … or die in the attempt to gain it,’3 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_3]his stature immediately assumes heroic and exaggeratedly ‘masculine’ dimensions:hence Douglass’s introduction of Washington in sculptured proportions,emblematic of a classical model. Variously characterized throughout The HeroicSlave as ‘our hero,’ the ‘strong man’ and ‘a sort of general-in-chief among them[the slaves],’4 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_4] Douglass’s description of Washingtonreads:Madison was of manly form. Tall, symmetrical, round, and strong…. His tornsleeves disclosed arms like polished iron. His face was ‘black, but comely.’ Hiseye, lit with emotion, kept guard under a brow as dark and as glossy as theraven’s wing. His whole appearance betokened Herculean strength; yet there wasnothing savage or forbidding in his aspect…. His broad mouth and nose spoke onlyof good nature and kindness. But his voice, that unfailing index of the soul,though full and melodious, had that in it which could terrify as well as charm.5[ch31fn.html#ch31fn_5]Douglass’s references to Hercules confirm Washington’s statuesque and monumentalsignificance, while his evocation of ‘the raven’s wing’ communicates racialdifference. Douglass’s physical representations of the archetypal black maleheroic figure in his written material on the Creole revolt resist conventions ofminstrelsy. His emphasis upon black physical prowess, ‘arms like polished iron,’is qualified by a preoccupation with rhetorical persuasion, as contained withinWashington’s ‘full and melodious’ voice, which undermines associations of blackslave heroism with ‘savagery.’ Furthermore, Douglass’s construction of the maleslave figure contains conventionally feminized motifs. For example, suchreferences as ‘A child might play in his arms’6 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_6] introducematernal considerations in The Heroic Slave’s depiction of the black male slavemodel, which complicate any strict definitions of Douglass’s narrative design asprescriptively masculine.Douglass’s descriptions of Washington throughout The Heroic Slave are in directcontrast to those provided in his speeches, including for example his earlieraddress, ‘Slavery, the Slumbering Volcano’ (1849). Given before a black audiencein New York to protest against the American Colonization Society, this speechconsiders Washington’s heroism along diametrically opposed lines: ‘Suiting theaction to the word … in a very few minutes Madison Washington, a black man, withwoolly head, high cheekbones, protruding lip, distended nostril, and retreatingforehead, had the mastery of that ship.’7 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_7] Upon firstreading, it would appear that Douglass subscribes to the conventional markersfor black representation provided by racist discourse and minstrelsy caricature:‘woolly head’ and ‘protruding lip.’ However, he ultimately subverts white raciststereotypes as they are used positively in order to situate the black male bodywithin an explicitly separatist framework. His use of an exaggerated,unambiguous and highly stylized form draws attention to debates surroundingDouglass’s manipulation of theatricality, minstrelsy and varied positioning ofaudience. In contrast to The Heroic Slave, in which he seeks to convince a whitereadership of black equal manhood by ignoring racial difference, in hisoratorical material Douglass celebrates the black male body even as representedby racist discourse, in order to produce generic black role models for a blackaudience. Indeed, the key phrase, ‘suiting the action to the word,’ confirmsDouglass’s explicit connection between moral suasion and political activism,while it articulates his recognition of the necessity for practical efforts byhis black audience to secure emancipation.Douglass’s incorporation of the black female slave figure into The Heroic Slaveis a source of much ambiguity and accounts for much of the critical controversysurrounding this text.8 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_8] His explanation of Washington’sreturn to the South to rescue his wife from slavery borrows heavily fromcontemporary speculation in the abolitionist press. Both The Liberator’s‘Madison Washington: Another Chapter in His History’ (1842) and the NationalAnti-Slavery Standard’s similarly titled ‘Madison Washington’ (1842) focusedupon the unnamed figure of Washington’s wife as stimulus to black malerebellion. The first argued that ‘This grave Creole matter may prove to havebeen but a part only of that grand game, in which the highest stake was theliberty of his dear wife,’ while the second summarized the public consequencesof domestic relationships: ‘We would give much to learn whether she was on boardthe Creole. It would be curious indeed, if this little sub-plot of domestic loveshould set in motion a great game of nations, with England and the United Statesfor actors.’9 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_9] This interest in the possible existence ofWashington’s wife not only encourages sensationalism by adding romance to analready adventurous tale but also confirms abolitionist preoccupations withdomesticity and their interests in convincing a white audience concerning thesanctity of the black domestic unit and the extent of its violation by slavery.Thus, Douglass extends the evident preoccupation in the abolitionist press withwriting Washington’s wife into the historical record by naming her into being inThe Heroic Slave as Susan Washington. He characterizes her in passive terms: asthe black hero’s ‘Poor thing!,’ ‘my good angel’ and ‘my poor wife, whom I knewmight be trusted with my secrets even on the scaffold.’10[ch31fn.html#ch31fn_10] The fact of Douglass’s authorship confirms thesignificance of this text for documenting black male narrative strategies forrepresenting the black female body. Thus, Washington’s account to the whiteabolitionist Listwell of his failed rescue attempt betrays Douglass’sideological emphasis:My wife … screamed and fainted … the white folks were roused…. It was all overwith me now! … Seeing that we gave no heed to their calls, they fired, and mypoor wife fell by my side dead, while I received but a slight flesh wound. I nowbecame desperate, and stood my ground, and awaited their attack over her deadbody.11 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_11]The preferred critical interpretation of this moment argues for theinvincibility of the black male body, set against the vulnerability of the blackfemale slave.12 [ch31fn.html#ch31fn_12] However, it is possible to argue insupport of the different view that Susan Washington’s body facilitates Madison’sphysical liberation in this text. The Heroic Slave offers a clear discrepancybetween Susan as Madison’s property, ‘my poor wife,’ and authorial interest inthe symbolic importance of the black female slave’s body, ‘her dead body.’Douglass questions and extends the available conventions within which black maleand female slave bodies are presented and defined."},{"pageContent":"1.

WILSONFROM “TRANSNATIONALISM, FREDERICK DOUGLASS, AND ‘THE HEROIC SLAVE’”1[ch32fn.html#ch32fn_1]One of the ironies, or tragedies, of “The Heroic Slave” is that while Douglasswants to impress on his readers the intrinsic eligibility of African Americansfor citizenship, the protagonist can find refuge only in another country. Thisirony makes the work an eerie precursor to James Baldwin. Yet for Douglass toappeal to his audience, he must privilege 1776 and the Declaration ofIndependence as constitutive elements of American nationalism. He therefore hasboth Tom Grant and Washington position the events aboard the Creole as similarto those that inspired the American Revolution. Despite Grant’s earlieradmission that Washington and company were motivated by the “principles of 1776”(163), Washington, while laying no less a claim to the national narrative, ismore conscious that the cultural apparatus that shapes the narrative is usuallyregulated by those in possession of political authority.God is my witness that LIBERTY, not malice, is the motive for this night’s work.I have done no more to those dead men yonder than they would have done to me inlike circumstances. We have struck for our freedom, and if a true man’s heart bein you, you will honor us for the deed. We have done that which you applaud yourfathers for doing, and if we are murderers, so were they. (161)Douglass knew that the underlying impulses of both 1776 and the Declaration ofIndependence were global. A year earlier in his Fourth of July speech, headmitted that while he drew “encouragement from the Declaration ofIndependence,” his spirit was also “cheered by the obvious tendencies of theage” (128). Hence, one of the tasks of “The Heroic Slave” is to make manifestand ubiquitous what the Declaration says is self-evident. Philosophically, hemay feel that all people are born equal or that they all possess the same rightto “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,” but he recognizes that suchontological presuppositions must be politically guaranteed. As author, he usescontrast to underscore his position: what is only property in the United Statesis recognized as a person in British Canada. What should be self-evident inAmerica is truly self-evident in the British Commonwealth.Notwithstanding his frequent appeals to the Declaration of Independencethroughout “The Heroic Slave,” ultimately Douglass is not convinced of itsproper implementation in the United States and must instead depend on the lawsof another nation. The closing scene of part 4 [part04.html#part04], in whichGrant details the events aboard the Creole when they land at Nassau, illustratesthat one’s rights must be legally inscribed by a nation. At the marinecoffeehouse in Richmond, Grant informs a company of sailors that after a stormon the high seas, Washington leaned toward him and stated, “Mr. mate, you cannotwrite the bloody laws of slavery on those restless billows. The ocean, if notthe land, is free” (162–63). The debate between state law versus natural law isarticulated in a conversation between Grant and Jack Williams. Williamsmaintains that the events aboard the Creole were the result of mismanagement bythe white crew. Grant’s retort discloses the violent apparatuses that supportthe institution of slavery:It is quite easy to talk of flogging niggers here on land, where you have thesympathy of the community, and the whole physical force of the government, Stateand national, at your command…. It is one thing to manage a company of slaves onthe plantation, and quite another to quell an insurrection on the lonely billowsof the Atlantic, where every breeze speaks of courage and liberty. (158)Every breeze of the Atlantic may have spoken of “courage and liberty,” but theocean turns out to be no more free than Virginian soil, since the freedom ofWashington and his company is not secured until they are within the pale of theBritish empire.Although oceans are the liminal spaces among nations and seem to have no statejurisdiction, they are far from neutral territories.2 [ch32fn.html#ch32fn_2]Grant and the rest of the crew of the Creole are operating not under maritimelogic but under the laws of Virginia and the United States. The Creole is afloating, self-contained microcosm of the nation carrying with it the nation’spolitical and legal mandates. Grant assumes that, on reaching Nassau, he canfind recourse with the American consul at port. He is disappointed to hear that“they did not recognize persons as property.” His chagrin is exacerbated by hisbelief that the laws of the United States—specifically, the Fugitive SlaveLaw—should be enforceable in other nations: “I told them that by the laws ofVirginia and the laws of the United States, the slaves on board were as muchproperty as the barrels of flour in the hold” (163). Douglass embellishes theirony here by having a company of black soldiers arrive at the port to protectthe ship’s property. That a company of black soldiers, presumably armed,represent the state accentuates the contrast he has established between theUnited States and its professed ideals. But if the Bahamas are an idealizedterritory and Nassau, a place where blacks are freed, is a more perfect statethan the United States, why does “The Heroic Slave” not close with the pragmaticidea that the Bahamas should be the destination of every black American? If yourinalienable rights are withheld in the United States, why not move to where theyare protected? What is it, finally, that compels Douglass to champion Washingtonas a distinctly American hero and to retain faith that the spirit of onefounding document, the Declaration of Independence, will ultimately refashionthe other, the Constitution?Douglass depicts Tom Grant in such a manner as to recall the earlier conversionof Listwell. Whereas Listwell was captivated by Washington’s rhetoricaleloquence, Grant is captivated by Washington’s display of physical restraint.Whereas Listwell pledged to remain true to the abolitionist crusade, Grantpromises to abandon the business of slavery. Through Listwell, Douglass is ableto envisage an idealized, converted white American who acts on his moral beliefsirrespective of legal codes. Douglass does not imbue Grant with a similar senseof moral indignation concerning slavery; instead, Grant is persuaded byWashington’s overwhelming presence. Throughout “The Heroic Slave” the size andstrength of the protagonist are detailed but rarely exposed in action, as thoughto figure a violent black masculinity only to contain it by the man’s higher,cerebral nature. Despite Washington’s physical presence, Douglass mitigates theviolence aboard the Creole by refusing to describe it. Instead, he underscoresWashington’s benevolence.3 [ch32fn.html#ch32fn_3] He was surely attempting topreempt accusations of wanton black violence. His audiences may have wantedslavery expelled, but only the most fervent abolitionists advocated violentinsurrection. Grant’s conversion is less a result of Washington’s sympathy thana result of Washington’s oratorical skill:I felt little disposition to reply to this impudent speech. By heaven, itdisarmed me. The fellow loomed up before me. I forgot his blackness in thedignity of his manner, and the eloquence of his speech. It seemed as if thesouls of both the great dead (whose names he bore) had entered him. (161)Although Grant submits that he “forgot” Washington’s blackness, the black man’sspeaking ability did not convince him of racial equality, as it did Listwell.Once again Douglass emphasizes the power of speech. Grant confesses thatWashington’s words “disarmed” him. Although conceded in a figurative sense, thedisarming here parallels the earlier physical disarming of the crew. They areheld captive by Washington physically and orally—equally. In Virginia, Grantsubsequently announces to the men seated about him, “I dare say here what manymen feel, but dare not speak, that this whole slave-trading business is adisgrace and scandal to Old Virginia” (159). Douglass’s maneuver at this momentis subtle. Instead of having the narrator or even Washington condemn Virginia’sparticipation in slavery, Douglass uses the recently converted Grant for such astatement.Both Grant and Williams contest the legacy of Virginia. Astonished that theinsurrection succeeded, Williams is equally concerned that the reputation ofVirginian sailors will be tarnished: “For my part I [part01.html#part01] feelashamed to have the idea go abroad, that a ship load of slaves can’t be safelytaken from Richmond to New Orleans. I should like, merely to redeem thecharacter of Virginia sailors, to take charge of a ship load on ’em to-morrow”(158; emphasis mine). His frustration reveals how his disappointment regardingthe disruption of the dominant racial hierarchy and his allegiance to Virginiaare utterly enmeshed, and it reveals how one’s regional affinities can supersedeone’s national affiliation. The tête-à-tête between Grant and Williams exposesmore than two men vying to identify the true character of Virginia. ThatListwell is a resident of Ohio—one of the free states—presumably accounts forhis swift conversion, but, with Grant, Douglass offers the conversion of a manwho not only had roots in the gateway to the South but was fully entangled inthe business of slavery. With Grant’s disavowal of slavery Douglass implies thathad the founding fathers atoned for their sin of owning slaves, they could havereemerged as rehabilitated Tom Grants. Imperfect and belated as his conversionis, Grant arrives as the son to redeem the fathers.If Grant is furnished to redeem the founding fathers, that redemption occurs inthe text only when the black body acts as a forfeiture that reifies theboundaries of the United States as a site of white hegemony. Althoughincreasingly characterized as an American, from his adoption of certain speechcadences to being recognized (in the sense that Fanon theorizes recognition) byListwell and Grant, Washington ultimately is displaced from the United States.This displacement is as much textual as it is actual. Although he never assumesthe position of narrator in “The Heroic Slave,” the number of lines dedicated tohis words is markedly reduced in part 4 [part04.html#part04]. Instead, theconcluding section features the conversation between Grant and Williams. Thoughhis articulations in and of themselves are resonant, Washington speaks only fourtimes here, and his voice is heard through and by the mouth of Grant. The effectcreated in this last section is the removal of the black physical presence fromthe United States. Only Grant and Williams are left, preoccupied with theproject of national history.“The Heroic Slave” is an imperfect allegory, not because it fails to locateWashington as a particular register in the literary precincts of the Americanhistorical romance but because it can only nominally approximate the issue ofcolonial and postcolonial anxiety. Its function as historical romance seeminglyundercuts its potential as a postcolonial text, as when Grant superimposesquestions of French imperialism onto the question of slavery in the UnitedStates: “For the negro to act cowardly on shore, may be to act wisely; and I’vesome doubts whether you, Mr. Williams, would find it very convenient were you aslave in Algiers, to raise your hand against the bayonets of a whole government”(158). The final image of the text, of the cohort not returning to the UnitedStates but remaining in Nassau, overwhelmingly conveys much of the postcolonialcondition of being without a home, of being an exile. “The Heroic Slave” endsnot with a depiction of the United States as a “trans-national America,” asRandolph Bourne would later call it, but with a displaced cadre of transnationalblacks whose affiliations and affinities are determined less by their referenceto the United States than by their relationship to other blacks in thediaspora—a sentiment that Douglass himself earlier announced when he wrote toWilliam Lloyd Garrison, “[A]s to nation, I belong to none” (17).WORKS CITEDAndrews, William L., ed.

Still hecould not quit the place. He had long desired to sound the mysterious depths ofthe thoughts and feelings of a slave. He was not, therefore, disposed to allowso providential an opportunity to pass unimproved” (HS, 179, emphasis mine).Here, what might otherwise have been an assumed good—an opportunity tocommunicate the feelings and humanity of a slave to white abolitionistreaders—is given a notably sinister connotation in the depiction of Listwell’sovereager and almost eroticized surveillance of the “unsuspecting speaker.”If, as some critics have suggested, Douglass’s fragmentary depiction of hisprotagonist is conditioned in part by the limited historical sources on MadisonWashington,5 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_5] this indirection also eschews the type ofostensibly benevolent spectatorship (exemplified by Listwell) that permeatesabolitionism. By making, “the lack of knowledge about Washington” the gambit ofhis text (as William Andrews observes),6 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_6] Douglass turnsthe fact of historiographical obscurity into an occasion for questioning themodel of agency that underwrites biographical narratives of history. Of course,this is not to suggest that Madison Washington’s evocative name did not helpabolitionists situate the Creole insurrection firmly within the tradition of theAmerican Revolution, for it did. As the New York Evangelist commented, Madison“wore a name unfit for a slave but finely expressive for a hero.”7[ch33fn.html#ch33fn_7] Still, without relinquishing either the heroic stature ofMadison’s actions or the rhetorically powerful link to the Revolution, thenovella insistently displaces biographical (or at least character-bound)expectations with unstable natural metaphors.Douglass forswears the possibility of fathoming Madison’s character before thenovella proper has even begun.Curiously, earnestly, anxiously we peer into the dark, and wish even for theblinding flash, or the light of northern skies to reveal him. But alas! he isstill enveloped in darkness, and we return from the pursuit like a wearied anddisheartened mother, (after a tedious and unsuccessful search for a lost child,)who returns weighed down with disappointment and sorrow. Speaking of marks,traces, possibles, and probabilities, we come before our readers. (HS, 175–76)With Madison’s interior motivations insistently undisclosed, the narrative usesmetaphors of natural phenomena to contextualize actions that (without the causalexplanation of intentions) appear not only inscrutable but also erratic. Thoughglimpsed only in fits and starts—”through the parted clouds and howling tempests… the quivering flash of angry lightening” (HS, 175)—what we know mostemphatically about Madison derives from the organizing correspondences betweenhis character and nature. “The Heroic Slave,” in this way, refrains from thetype of exceptionalist individualism that its title leads us to expect—insteadestablishing Madison’s moral character by elaborating its basic comparabilitywith the natural world.The proliferation of natural imagery in “The Heroic Slave” shapes more than thepresentation of Madison’s character. Natural phenomena (clouds, conflagrations,and storms) also provide the logic and impetus for the novella’s highly episodicstructure. Although Madison first attempts to escape just weeks after his forestsoliloquy, “a season of clouds and rain set in, wholly preventing me from seeingthe North Star, which I had trusted as my guide, not dreaming that clouds mightintervene between us” (HS, 189, emphasis mine). This “circumstance,” Madisonexplains, “was fatal to my project, for in losing my star, I lost my way; sowhen I supposed I was far towards the North, and had almost gained my freedom, Idiscovered myself at the very point from which I had started” (HS, 189–90).Nature, here, is a practical obstacle to freedom rather than a metaphor for itsinevitability. The passage, however, does not belie the novella’s use of naturalimagery as a figure for natural rights. Instead, it underscores, as Peter Meyersargues in another context, that Douglass’s imagination of natural law as“self-executing” “did not betray a naive or willful idealism … More painfullythan most, he was mindful that the dynamism of nature and history broughtreversals for ill as for good.”8 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_8] Douglass’s attention tothe erratic character of natural phenomena in “The Heroic Slave” has a similareffect—suggesting that despite its rhetorical and political force, the discourseof natural law does not have the same empirical self-evidence as the physicallaws that govern nature. Douglass, however, does more than emplot theprerogatives of natural law; he takes the very restlessness of nature as a modelfor liberty and reform.RESTLESS LIBERTIESThe plot of “The Heroic Slave” does not develop as a consequence of Madison’sindividual agency, but through the sporadic shifts of weather, which structureand contain the virtual world of the novella. Although a “season of clouds”frustrates Madison’s initial attempt to reach the North, he is later forced backon his journey by a wildfire that drives him out of his hiding place in theneighboring swamps.The whole world seemed on fire, and it appeared to me that the day of judgmenthad come; that the burning bowels of the earth had burst forth, and the end ofall things was at hand…. The very heavens seemed to rain down fire through thetowering trees; it was by the merest chance that I escaped the devouringelement. Running before it, and stopping occasionally to take breath, I lookedback to behold its frightful ravages, and to drink in its savage magnificence.It was awful, thrilling, solemn, beyond compare. When aided by the fitful wind,the merciless tempest of fire swept on, sparkling, creaking, cracking, curling,roaring, out-doing in its dreadful splendor a thousand thunderstorms at once….It was this grand conflagration that drove me hither; I ran alike from fire andfrom slavery (HS, 193–94, emphasis mine).Employing the rhetoric of millennialism, Douglass presents the fire as a divine“judgment” against slavery, which returns Madison on his journey for freedom.Admittedly, the depiction of Madison as all but bereft of agency generatestensions in a text that tacitly invokes heroism as a condition for politicallegitimacy. However, by depicting nature as the principle agent, Douglass isable to suggest that the opposition to slavery is more fundamental than theactions of any one individual or group.This insistent downplaying of human agency is most dramatic in therepresentation of the revolt onboard the Creole. The force of theinsurrectionists is diminished, on a formal level, by the fact that the revoltis narrated only retrospectively, and narrated, moreover, by a sailor who wasunconscious during the event in question. The details of the revolt emerge inthe course of a dialogue between two white sailors in a Richmond coffeehouse.Jack Williams, “a regular old salt” “tauntingly” addresses the “first mate” ofthe Creole: “I say, shipmate, you had rather rough weather on your late passageto Orleans?” (HS, 226). The fictional mate, named Tom Grant, replies “Foul play,as well as foul weather” (HS, 226). Williams speaks of bad weather during theinsurrection, but it is worth noting that the premise of the squall is one ofthe fictional elements of Douglass’s portrayal. The weather during the revoltwas, in fact, unremarkable—there was, to quote the Congressional report, “afresh breeze, and the sky [was] a little hazy, with trade-clouds flying.”9[ch33fn.html#ch33fn_9] Douglass invented the squall, but this fictionalizationalso responded to the diplomatic history of the revolt—and to [Daniel] Webster’simagined “stress[es] of weather,” in particular.10 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_10] Weknow that Douglass was familiar with Webster’s letters, because he refers tothem explicitly in two of his speeches.11 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_11] The squall,then, can be seen as a rewriting of Webster, which strategically reappropriatesnatural metaphors as a figure for natural rights.In a spirit not unlike Webster’s, the “old salt” Williams insists that the realcause of that “whole affair” could not possibly rest solely with the slaves. The“whole disaster,” Williams declares, “was the result of ignorance of the realcharacter of darkies in general…. All that is needed in dealing with a set ofrebellious darkies, is to show that yer not afraid of ’em” (HS, 226–27). Had thesailors lost control of the ship as a result of the weather alone, Williamscontinues to suggest, that at least would have “relieve[d] the affair of itspresent discreditable features” (HS, 231). Acts of nature, as Grant remarks, areseen as unavoidable, and thus more legitimate. “For a ship to go down under acalm sky is, upon the first flush of it, disgraceful either to sailors orcaulkers. But when we learn, that by some mysterious disturbance in nature, thewaters parted beneath, and swallowed the ship up, we lose our indignation anddisgust in lamentation of the disaster, and in awe of the Power which controlsthe elements” (HS, 231). By establishing a parallel between “foul play” and“foul weather,” the premise of the squall allows Douglass to maintain the agencyof the slaves, while also suggesting that the revolt (and the resultingemancipation of the slaves) was prompted by an underlying “disturbance innature.”12 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_12]The retrospective narration of the revolt distances the reader from its dramaand urgency, but this remove facilitates Douglass’s effort to present Madison’sheroism in the more authoritative terms of relative disinterestedness. TomGrant—who discerns Madison to be “a superior man” but is unwilling to concedethat the “principles of 1776” apply to men he deems inferior on the basis of“color” (HS, 238)—is pivotal to the ideological authority of “The Heroic Slave”for this very reason.13 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_13] Offering an intermediary betweenListwell’s avowed (if still fairly anemic)14 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_14]abolitionism and Williams’s blatant bigotry, Grant models a form of conciliatoryidentification with Madison.15 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_15] The fact that thepresentation of Madison’s heroism is never free from white mediation in thenovella—whether in Grant’s reluctant admission of respect, or in the(fabricated) fact that Listwell provides Madison with the files that he uses tofree himself and the other slaves (HS, 223; 235)16 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_16]—hasoften been regarded as the novella’s failure fully to imagine blackself-determination.17 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_17] However, the decision to narratethe revolt not only retrospectively, but also dialogically, does not therebyreproduce the ideologically compromised assumptions of the novella’s whitecharacters. Instead, the narrative’s reliance on figures of mediation tacitlyidentifies public perception (not the capacity of slaves) as the principalobstacle to emancipation. Douglass’s suggestive naming of Grant, which has goneunremarked in scholarship, echoes this emphasis—suggesting that rights (evenwhen conceptualized as natural) still require social and legal recognition.Despite the fact that both of the venues in which “The Heroic Slave” initiallyappeared—an antislavery gift book and Douglass’s newspaper—were likely toattract readers who already self-identified as abolitionists, the textself-consciously addresses itself to the unconverted reader. The conversationbetween Grant and Williams provides a formal mechanism for defamiliarizingcommonplace stereotypes about the innate servility of slaves. Grant responds toWilliams’s imputation that the sailors could have prevented the revolt throughbetter management by arguing that the outward submission is strategic andconditioned by context.I deny that the negro is, naturally, a coward, or that your theory of managingslaves will stand the test of salt water…. It is one thing to manage a companyof slaves on a Virginia plantation, and quite another thing to quell aninsurrection on the lonely billows of the Atlantic, where every breeze speaks ofcourage and liberty. For the negro to act cowardly on shore, may be to actwisely; and I’ve some doubts whether you, Mr. Williams, would find it veryconvenient were you a slave in Algiers, to raise your hand against the bayonetsof a whole government (HS, 228).By contrasting the state of Virginia with the open ocean, Grant intimates thatslavery, far from natural, can be maintained only in the artificial environs ofa plantation. For this reason, as Grant’s alternate scenario of Algerianenslavement dramatizes, slavery can as easily claim white auditors as it doesthe subjects of their curiosity.The more general perspectival distance from the insurrectionists helps enforcethe objective tone of these pointed remarks, but it becomes more problematic inthe representation of the revolt itself. As if to take its formal aesthetic ofmediation and opacity to a comic extreme, at the beginning of the revolt, Grant,our only eyewitness, is “knocked senseless to the deck” (HS, 234). When heregains consciousness after an uncertain interval, the violent struggle andsubsequent reversal of power have already occurred. Grant explains, “When I cameto myself, (which I did in a few minutes, I suppose, for it was yet quitelight,) there was not a white man on deck. The sailors were all aloft in therigging, and dared not come down. Captain Clarke and Mr. Jameson lay stretchedon the quarter-deck,—both dying,—while Madison himself stood at the helm unhurt”(HS, 234, emphasis mine).Critics tend to suggest that Douglass uses the premise of Grant’sunconsciousness to minimize the scene of violence and so facilitate theidealization of Madison as a hero,18 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_18] but violence, it isworth stressing, is not absent so much as displaced onto the portentous figureof the squall.By this time the apprehended squall had burst upon us. The wind howledfuriously,—the ocean was white with foam, which, on account of the darkness, wecould see only by the quick flashes of lightning that darted occasionally fromthe angry sky. All was alarm and confusion. Hideous cries came up from the slavewomen. Above the roaring billows a succession of heavy thunder rolled along,swelling the terrific din. Owing to the great darkness, and a sudden shift ofthe wind, we found ourselves in the trough of the sea. When shipping a heavy seaover the starboard bow, the bodies of the captain and Mr. Jameson were washedoverboard…. A more savage thunder-gust never swept the ocean. (HS, 236–37)Recalling the constellation of natural metaphors that organizes the ellipticalpresentation of Madison in the preface—”howling tempests,” “the menacing rock ona perilous coast” and “angry lightning” (HS, 175)—Douglass uses the squall toboth express and contain the uncomfortable violence of the revolt. With theirprecise physical condition undisclosed, and with causality eclipsed in thepassive voice, we are thus told that “the bodies of the captain and Mr. Jamesonwere washed overboard.” Admittedly less gory than the official account of theinsurrection (which includes a knife fight and a shooting), the squall,nonetheless, is not only sublime, but “furious,” “terrific,” “hideous.” “TheHeroic Slave,” in this respect, does not repress the violence of theinsurrection so much as reconfigure its underlying cause. Douglass presents therevolt as an effect of nature—more fundamental, if also more fitful, than theactions of an individual agent.Evoking a long tradition of representing national turmoil through the figure ofthe ship of state tossed to and fro at sea, Douglass uses the ocean as asymbolic counterpoint to extant national law. This is particularly emphatic inthe passage that appears to have served as the prototype for MadisonWashington’s often quoted proclamation in “The Heroic Slave” that “you cannotwrite the bloody laws of slavery on those restless billows. The ocean, if notthe land, is free” (HS, 237).19 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_19] In his 1849 speech—whosetitle, “Slavery, the Slumbering Volcano,” itself imagines emancipation as animminent natural force—Douglass uses the “restless waves” of the ocean as arhetorical directive for reform:Sir, I thank God that there is some part of his footstool upon which the bloodystatutes of Slavery cannot be written. They cannot be written on the proud,towering billows of the Atlantic. The restless waves will not permit thosebloody statutes to be recorded there; those foaming billows forbid it; old oceangnawing with its hungry surges upon our rockbound coast preaches a lesson toAmerican soil: ‘You may bind chains upon the limbs of your people if you will;you may place the yoke upon them if you will; you may brand them with irons; youmay write out your statutes and preserve them in the archives of the nation ifyou will; but the moment they mount the surface of our unsteady waves, thosestatutes are obliterated, and the slave stands redeemed, disenthralled.’ Thispart of God’s domain then is free, and I hope that ere long our own soil willalso be free.20 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_20]Douglass conceptualizes the ocean as an explicitly denationalizing force. TheAtlantic is not only outside of the nation proper; it erodes the coasts thatgive it form. The analogy between the soil and the laws is significant in thisrespect. For in underscoring the link between territoriality and positive law,Douglass presents the ocean as a model for an essentially anarchic freedom.Freedom here, as is so often the case, is an expressly negative concept,imagined alternately as baptism and destruction.The Atlantic—as the personification of natural law—didactically “preaches alesson to American soil,” but it remains an episodic force, unsteady andtransient. Drawing together the archetypal liberal tropes of the state of natureand the founding scene of revolution, Douglass represents the ocean as apolitical tabula rasa that is both a precondition for constructing politicalideals and, if they are not fulfilled, for periodically dissolving and reformingindividual communities. Thus, as much as Douglass might idealize the ocean as anextra-national utopian space (which if not “nowhere” is still foremost not thenation),21 [ch33fn.html#ch33fn_21] his ultimate objective is not properlytransnational or cosmopolitan, as several recent critics have suggested.22[ch33fn.html#ch33fn_22] Instead, Douglass prescriptively uses the universalizingrhetoric of natural law as a model for national reform."},{"pageContent":"1.

[ch33.html#ch33fn-12] As Krista Walter notes, Grant’s counterfactual exampleof ships foundering as a result of natural forces indicates that he can “plainlysee the hand of Providence” in the revolt (“Trappings of Nationalism inFrederick Douglass’s The Heroic Slave,” African American Review 34.2 [2000]:240).13.

Wilson, “On NativeGround: Transnationalism, Frederick Douglass, and ‘The Heroic Slave,’” PMLA121.2 (2006): 461.14. [ch33.html#ch33fn-14] The fact that Listwell allows himself to be mistakenas a slaveholder while in the South (in order to avoid disagreeable disputationswith the locals) is one of several passages that emphasize his self-interestedcomplacency (HS, 214).15. [ch33.html#ch33fn-15] As Walter notes, Grant functions as a “figure for thereluctant reader” (“Trappings,” 239).16. [ch33.html#ch33fn-16] Before the actual revolt in 1841, the slaves on theCreole, in fact, were neither chained nor fettered.17. [ch33.html#ch33fn-17] The problem, as William Andrews phrases it, is thetext’s “rhetorical dependence on white precedents for the sanctioning of acts ofblack violence”; see To Tell a Free Story: The First Century of Afro-AmericanAutobiography, 1760–1865 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 187.18. [ch33.html#ch33fn-18] Maggie Sale, for example, argues that “Douglassdisarms gendered, racialist discourses that would figure Washington as a ‘blackmurderer’ or raging savage.” However, the evasion of violence has led manycritics to suggest that the tale is too conciliatory in its address. RichardYarborough observes that Douglass “strips his fictional slave rebel of much ofhis radical, subversive force,” while Ivy Wilson argues that by narrating therevolt indirectly through a white sailor the story reproduces the authenticatinglogic of the white abolitionist preface. Without ignoring these tensions, Iwould like to suggest that this indirection is not a symptomatic omissionconfined to the depiction of insurrectionary violence, but something thatDouglass insists on self-consciously throughout “The Heroic Slave”—and whichsignificantly informs his conception of the project of liberty. Sale, “To Makethe Past Useful,” 51–2; Yarborough, “Race, Violence, and Manhood: The MasculineIdeal in Frederick Douglass’s ‘The Heroic Slave,’” in Frederick Douglass: NewLiterary and Historical Essays, ed. Eric J. Sundquist (New York: CambridgeUniversity Press, 1990, 166–88, esp. 181; Wilson, “On Native Ground,” 461.19. [ch33.html#ch33fn-19] Douglass’s characterization of the “restless[ness]” ofthe ocean echoes one of the most compelling passages in William ElleryChanning’s book-length consideration of the implications of the Creole revolt.“The sea is the exclusive property of no nation … No state can write its laws onthat restless surface.” William E. Channing, The Duty of the Free States, orRemarks Suggested by the Case of the Creole (Boston: William Crosby & Company,1842), 28.20. [ch33.html#ch33fn-20] Douglass Papers, 2:158.21. [ch33.html#ch33fn-21] As Carl Schmidt suggests in his discussion of theutopian character of the oceanic order, implicit in More’s Utopia (1516) “and inthe profound and productive formulation of the word Utopia, was the possibilityof an enormous destruction of all orientations based on the old nomos of theearth…. Utopia did not mean any simple and general nowhere (or erewhon), but aU-topos, which, by comparison even with its negation, A-topos, has a strongernegation in relation to topos.” Carl Schmidt, The Nomos of the Earth in theInternational Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum, Trans. G. L. Ulmen (New York:Telos Press Publishing, 2006), 178.22. [ch33.html#ch33fn-22] As William Boelhower notes, the Creole case and itsdepiction in “The Heroic Slave” have “become a flashpoint for tracingAtlantic-world trajectories” (“The Rise of the New Atlantic Studies Matrix,”American Literary History 20, no. 1 [2007], 83–101, esp. 97). See also Ivy G.Wilson, “On Native Ground: Transnationalism, Frederick Douglass, and ‘The HeroicSlave,’” PMLA 121, no. 2 (2006): 453–68.
