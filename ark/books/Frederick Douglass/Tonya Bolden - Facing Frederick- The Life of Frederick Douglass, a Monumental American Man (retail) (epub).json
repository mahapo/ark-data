Photography allowed those who couldn’t afford to have theirportraits painted to have images of themselves. Frederick also believed thatphotographs satisfied “a deep-seated want” in people—namely, to “see themselvesas others see them, and as they will be seen by those [who] shall come afterthem.”Frederick called Louis Daguerre, one of the fathers of photography, “the greatdiscoverer of modern times.” Daguerre’s process, perfected in 1839, about a yearafter Frederick escaped slavery, involved polishing a silver-plated copper sheetto a mirror shine, then treating that sheet with mercury vapor that rendered alight-sensitive surface onto which an image was directly exposed. The endresult, a daguerreotype (da·guerre·o·type), was a one-of-a-kind image withincredibly sharp details. Because it is fragile (and silver is prone totarnish), a daguerreotype was sealed under glass and placed in a protectivecase. So was the ambrotype (am·bro·type, from a Greek word for “immortal”)introduced in early 1850s. Producing an ambrotype involved exposing images ontothin sheets of glass.Often cased but not so fragile was the tintype, an image printed on blackenediron. The tintype was developed in the mid-1850s, as was the carte de visite (orcdv or calling card). This 2½-by-4-inch photograph was produced by placing anegative onto a paper coated with an albumen (al·bu·men, or egg white) and saltemulsion. The image was affixed to card stock. The cabinet card (usually analbumen print) was mounted on larger card stock, generally 6¼ by 4¼ inches.In Facing Frederick, as you learn of a legend’s life, you will encounter morethan a dozen photographs of the man who so loved photography and who wasphotographed many, many times. These photographs (with specifics provided incaptions) include one taken when Douglass was in his early twenties and onetaken not long before he died at the age of seventy-seven.Image [../images/common2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f00viii-01.jpg]The earliest known photograph of Frederick (daguerreotype, c. 1841).CHAPTER 1Image [../images/common4.jpg]A SOUL TO ASPIREFrederick faced a dilemma in mid-1846. He could sit tight and not rock the boat,or he could captain his own ship.Nearly eight years had passed since he’d made his great escape. Nearly fivesince he’d begun his rise from obscure laborer to renowned warrior for the“sacred cause.”But what if his new venture failed despite his fame? A blow, yes, but would itdefeat someone who had triumphed over slavery as he had? And after that,Frederick’s early days of freedom in the whaling town of New Bedford,Massachusetts, had not been easy.One day sawing wood, another digging a cellar. Now driving a carriage orshoveling coal. Now being a chimney sweep or hoisting casks of whale oil down atthe docks. Odd job after odd job, with him scrimping to keep food on the tablealong with a place to call home, at the start two small rooms on Elm Streetfacing Buzzards Bay.Image [../images/f0002-01.jpg]Detail from South-Eastern View of New Bedford, Mass. (c. 1839). When thishand-colored engraving appeared, Frederick, a Southerner, was probably stilladjusting to New England culture.A few months after he settled in New Bedford, the Liberator came intoFrederick’s life. He scrimped even more to afford a yearly subscription ($2.50)to this leading antislavery newspaper. The four-page weekly became “my meat andmy drink. My soul was set all on fire. Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds—itsscathing denunciations of slaveholders—its faithful exposures of slavery . . .sent a thrill of joy through my soul, such as I had never felt before!”Soul on fire, Frederick frequented local antislavery meetings. Early on just alistener, then gradually speaking up, orating. Growing bolder and more engaged,he went to meetings in other towns. The life-changing trip came on Tuesday,August 10, 1841, when he boarded the paddle-wheel steamer Telegraph bound fornearby Nantucket, site of a Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society (MASS)convention.Frederick wasn’t the only black person at the three-day event held inNantucket’s library, the elegant Athenaeum. His friend Jeremiah B. Sanderson, abarber, and more than a dozen other New Bedford blacks made the journey.Residents of the island’s black section of town also turned out to listen to anarray of speakers. One was flinty William Lloyd Garrison, editor of theLiberator, Frederick’s meat and drink. Garrison, like a god to Frederick, was aMASS founder and its driving force.Image [../images/f0004-01.jpg]William Lloyd Garrison (daguerreotype, c. 1850). Garrison—apprenticed at agefourteen to the editor of his hometown paper, the Newburyport Herald—was in hismid-twenties when he launched the Liberator in January 1831. In January 1832 hecofounded the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society (originally the New EnglandAnti-Slavery Society).When Frederick boarded the Telegraph he had no plans for any speechmaking. AfterJ. B. Sanderson addressed the crowd on day two, Frederick still remained anobserver. But then that evening a white man who had heard him speak in NewBedford urged him to say a few words.As Frederick faced the overwhelmingly white crowd of five hundred, his tonguewas tied; there were shackles on his mind. “I felt myself a slave.” In a speechlost to history, he ultimately stopped stammering, trembling, found his voice,his way, his roar. With his entrancing baritone voice, he soared.When Frederick finished, William Lloyd Garrison sprang to his feet and led thecrowd in an impromptu call-and-response.GARRISON: “Have we been listening to a thing, a piece of property, or to a man?”THE CROWD: “A man! A man!”GARRISON: “And should such a man be held a slave in a republican and Christianland?”THE CROWD: “No, no! Never, never!”GARRISON: “Shall such a man ever be sent back to slavery from the soil of oldMassachusetts?”In his book Acts of the Anti-Slavery Apostles, white minister Parker Pillsburysaid this is what happened next: “Almost the whole assembly sprang with oneaccord to their feet and the walls and the roof of the Athenaeum seemed toshudder with the ‘No, no!’”Frederick spoke again the next day, and before the convention was over, MASSinvited him to join its roster of lecturers. What’s more, with MASS’s help, hesoon moved into a cottage of his own in the small town of Lynn. This future shoecapital of the world was about ten miles north of downtown Boston, where theLiberator and MASS were headquartered at 25 Cornhill Street.Image [../images/common5.jpg]A roll of thunder, a holy wonder, lionlike Frederick became MASS’s mostin-demand black speaker. In his mission to win souls to the sacred cause ofending slavery and to rouse converts to higher heights of activism, he deliveredover a hundred speeches a year.New England was his main stomping ground, but Frederick also spoke in New Yorkand Pennsylvania, and as far west as Indiana. Sometimes he journeyed solo—bytrain, by stagecoach, on horseback. At other times with Garrison, Bostonaristocrat Wendell Phillips, and other white abolitionists, as well as blackones, such as the freeborn Salem dandy Charles Remond, a barber by trade. For atime Frederick was MASS’s only black speaker born enslaved.THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY MAN.HE WAS CUT OUT FOR A HERO.—N. P. ROGERS, a white abolitionist and newspaperman in Concord, New HampshireWhen addressing a crowd of twenty, fifty, hundreds, in a barn or church, townhall or tavern—and often without notes—Frederick captivated audiences withaccounts of cruelties suffered and seen. He tore to shreds Southern propagandathat enslaved people were content and well cared for. He stressed that slaverydegraded both the enslaved and the enslaver. He denounced churches that failedto support the sacred cause and damned those with slaveholders in their pulpitsand pews. The idea of a Christian slaveholder was ludicrous, argued Frederick,who was by no means irreligious. He became a Christian as an adolescent; as aman, a lay preacher at New Bedford’s African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Zionchurch. And this preacher man spoke just as eloquently, just as forcefully, onthe undue burdens borne by free blacks in the North as he did on slavery.Image [../images/f0007-01.jpg]Detail from Charles Lenox Remond (daguerreotype, c. 1851). Remond, MASS’s firstblack lecturer, was the son of successful entrepreneurs (barbering,hairdressing, catering). Remond, who was about eight years older than Frederick,no doubt had much to teach him when the two began lecturing together.By and large blacks in the North were limited to the lowest-paying jobs. Theright to serve on a jury, the right to sue over being wronged—generally none ofthat was allowed. At a time when only men had the right to vote, usually theonly black men who had it, too, were those who owned a certain amount ofproperty. What’s more, free blacks frequently had to contend with physicalassaults from whites—even children making their way to school—for some perceivedslight. Or simply because they were black.HE WAS MORE THAN SIX FEET IN HEIGHT, AND HIS MAJESTIC FORM, AS HE ROSE TO SPEAK,STRAIGHT AS AN ARROW, MUSCULAR, YET LITHE AND GRACEFUL, HIS FLASHING EYE, ANDMORE THAN ALL, HIS VOICE, THAT RIVALED [STATESMAN DANIEL] WEBSTER’S IN ITSRICHNESS, AND IN THE DEPTH AND SONOROUSNESS OF ITS CADENCES, MADE UP SUCH ANIDEAL OF AN ORATOR AS THE LISTENERS NEVER FORGOT.—DAVID NEWHALL JOHNSON, a white resident of LynnTo a crowd in Plymouth, Massachusetts, Frederick charged that for the most partwhite Northerners could only tolerate blacks “in their proper place!”(underfoot). Such people “will not allow that we have a head to think, and aheart to feel, and a soul to aspire. They treat us not as men, but as dogs . . .and expect us to run and do their bidding.” Racism put blacks in a double bind.“You degrade us, and then ask why we are degraded—you shut our mouths, and thenask why we don’t speak—you close your colleges and seminaries against us, andthen ask why we don’t know more.”“Twin-monsters of darkness”—that’s what Frederick called slavery and racism. Andwhen it came to racism, as with slavery, he spoke from experience.Early on in New Bedford (population about 3,000), Frederick had worked odd jobsinstead of plying his trade as a caulker at a shipyard, because white caulkersthreatened to quit if he was hired. So instead of earning two dollars a day, heearned about one. (Thankfully, he eventually found steady work at a candleworksand oil refinery, then at a brass foundry, where he often nailed a newspaper toa post near his bellows so that he could read as he worked.)Later, while he was out lecturing, time and again train conductors orderedFrederick into the car for black people (usually the freight car). He sometimesresisted but then relented. More than once, when he stood his ground, he wasroughed up and thrown off the train.For a trip to Pittsfield, New Hampshire, Frederick was denied a seat inside thestagecoach and forced to ride on its roof with the driver. During the breakbetween lectures in Pittsfield’s church, he sat on a gravestone in its cemeteryfor a while. Alone. In the rain. With nothing to eat, while others lunched intheir homes or at the tavern, which had turned Frederick away. (Ironically, itwas proslavery politician Moses Norris Jr., not an abolitionist, who welcomedhim into his house.)In Pendleton, Indiana, in the summer of 1843, the racism was near deadly.Ruffians attacked Frederick and two white colleagues as he addressed a crowd ona platform in the woods.Big sticks and stones. Fists and feet. Frederick defended himself as best hecould but was knocked unconscious and left with a broken right hand. Because thebones were not set properly, that hand plagued him for the rest of his life.After Pendleton, it was no easy thing for Frederick to write.But write he must! He was tired of talk that he was a fake. Though he was knownto show audiences his whip-scarred back, some people doubted that he had beenenslaved.Someone so dignified?Someone so well-spoken?A fugitive slave? How could that be?Frederick hoped his autobiography would put an end to all that. In the winter of1844 he picked up his pen.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Frederick’s writing wasn’t flawless. When he put pen to paper, “immediately”sometimes came out as “emmeadiately,” “enemies” as “eneimeis” and “wrote” as“worte.” Any one of his colleagues could edit his prose, but only he could tellhis story. And after several years on the lecture circuit, Frederick knew how tohold people’s attention.The book began simply, straightforward: “I was born in Tuckahoe, nearHillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton, in Talbot County, Maryland.”The narrative moved on to reveal a life that was tangled, tortured.Frederick wrote of seeing his mother only a few times. Shortly after he wasborn, she was sent to work on a farm twelve miles away; then she died when hewas about eight.Frederick wrote of never knowing which white man was his father and of knowingnothing about the circumstances under which he was conceived.Frederick wrote of having at one point a closet floor for a bed.He wrote of days of howling hunger, of feet cracked from the cold, of facingdown suicidal thoughts with “the hope of being free.” And there were summerSundays spent standing on the banks of Chesapeake Bay, “with saddened heart andtearful eye,” yearning to be free as he watched ship after ship move “off to themighty ocean.”More than once young Frederick saw his aunt Hester whipped upon her naked backuntil her blood pooled on the floor. Later he faced physical and psychologicalabuse from Edward Covey, wheat farmer and notorious slave breaker. At Covey’splace, sixteen-year-old Frederick worked in the fields—binding blades of grain,hauling them to the fan for winnowing—sometimes sunup to past dark, sometimesunder an August sun’s relentless rays, sometimes to the point of passing out.And there were beatings meant to crush his spirit, reduce him to a brute, butnever succeeding. At least not for long. And never after the day he fought Coveyback and beat him badly, so badly the man never again laid a hand on him.Frederick wrote, too, of his 1836 New Year’s resolution, shortly before heturned eighteen: to get free! With a handful of friends he devised a plan, butthen the authorities found out about it and he landed in jail, gripped by fearof being sold into a Deep South state like Georgia, where slavery was generallymore brutal, where he knew not a soul.With pathos and passion Frederick wrote of being treated like a thing, passedaround on a white person’s wish or whim or because of a change in the wind.Now, from babyhood, living with his grandparents on a farm in Tuckahoe.Now, at age six, taken twelve miles away to the Wye House plantation in Eastonto run errands, sweep yards, do other domestic work—seeing some siblings for thefirst time.Now, at age eight, taken more than fifty miles away up Chesapeake Bay toBaltimore to be playmate/plaything to a ship’s carpenter’s son and, when older,to do menial work at a shipyard.Nearly eight years later, back across the bay and some eighty miles away to St.Michaels.Hired out to cruel Covey for a year.Hired out to another farmer for a year.Then back to Baltimore and handed over to a shipbuilder in Fell’s Point to learnto be a caulker, an apprenticeship that had him at the “beck and call” of someseventy-five men. Eighteen-year-old Frederick couldn’t even learn a trade inpeace. A gang of white apprentices jumped him one day. With handspikes. Withsticks and stones. With carpenters shouting, “Kill him! Kill him!” And he almostlost an eye.Frederick faced abuse after abuse for twenty long years.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Image [../images/f0014-01.jpg]Captain Thomas Auld (unknown medium, c. 1870). Thomas Auld—brother of HughAuld—inherited Frederick after his wife, Lucretia, died. She had inheritedFrederick after the death of her father, Captain Aaron Anthony, Frederick’sowner at birth. From boyhood Frederick believed that Anthony was his father.Along with grim, gory, and gruesome things witnessed and endured, Frederickwrote of rare delights.His Baltimore mistress teaching him his ABCs—until her husband, Master HughAuld, put a stop to that.His getting white pals on that city’s Philpot Street to continue where mistressleft off.Glorious, too, was the day when, around age thirteen, he finally had fifty cents(from shining shoes on the sly) to buy a used copy of The Columbian Orator, amanual on the art of public speaking and a rhapsody to liberty and justice.“On the Starry Heavens” . . . “The Dignity of Human Nature” . . . “Dialoguebetween a Master and Slave.’’ The gifted, enterprising boy feasted on thisthree-hundred-page book’s more than eighty speeches, dialogues, and essays inhis quest for a finer mind, for better reading skills—skills he later passed onin clandestine schools for friends doing their best to bear up under bondagelike him.Though not in great detail, Frederick recounted his escape from Baltimore onSeptember 3, 1838. How did he feel when he reached free soil? Like an “unarmedmariner” saved from a pirate’s pursuit by a “friendly man-of-war.”Reader. Teacher. Self-emancipator. Orator. Twenty-seven-year-old Frederick addedauthor to his accomplishments in the spring of 1845. His autobiography,Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, was finished!And it met with thunderous applause.Image [../images/common2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0017-01.jpg]Daguerreotype, c. August 1, 1843: Frederick will continue to appear clean-shavenin photographs until the early 1850s.CHAPTER 2Image [../images/common4.jpg]ONE THE WORLD OVERMASS published Narrative, and the Liberator gave it fabulous fanfare.On Friday, May 9, 1845, the newspaper reported that the book would soon be out.It also announced that Frederick’s book opened with a preface by William LloydGarrison, followed by a tribute from Wendell Phillips. The Liberator then ranGarrison’s roughly 3,300-word preface. Like Phillips’ letter, it vouched for thebook’s authenticity.Two weeks later the Liberator announced that Frederick’s Narrative was availableat 25 Cornhill for fifty cents a copy. The paper also ran an excerpt from thebook, something it would do again and again.Advertised in newspapers as far west as Wisconsin Territory, Frederick’s125-page book sold about 4,500 copies within three months. It was the mostriveting and therefore bestselling of the roughly two dozen slave narrativespublished in the United States up to that point. Frederick was even more famousnow.With increased fame, Frederick faced increased danger. Like other blacks, he hadlived in fear of being kidnapped and sold into slavery. There was always thepossibility of his last owner getting a lead on his whereabouts and sendingslave catchers after him. That’s why he used aliases: first Frederick Stanley,then Frederick Johnson, and finally Frederick Douglass.I HOPE WE SHALL SOME WAY OR OTHER GET A FEW COPIES OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS’NARRATIVE. YOUR EXTRACTS FROM IT ARE MOST INTERESTING.—to Garrison from JAMES HAUGHTON, a white reformer in Dublin, IrelandIn his lectures, Frederick said little about the who and where of his captivity.But in Narrative he revealed where he was born. He gave the names of hisdifferent owners and other taskmasters. And his real name, too. So it was nowpublic knowledge that the abolitionist Frederick Douglass was originallyFrederick Bailey. And he had been so bold as to send a copy of Narrative toThomas Auld, the person who still legally owned him. The upshot was thatFrederick, the fugitive, would not be hard to find. It was no secret that helived in Lynn. Also, his lectures were advertised.IT IS THE MOST THRILLING WORK WHICH THE AMERICAN PRESS EVER ISSUED—AND THE MOSTIMPORTANT.

I HAVE MANY TIMES HEARD THE AUTHOR VIVIDLY PORTRAY THE EVILS OFSLAVERY. . . .

Into his steamer trunk went three-piecesuits, toiletries, and other necessaries for the journey, along with copies ofNarrative to sell at his talks. He also packed slaveholders’ tools of torture,including a whip and chains.Frederick received the royal treatment in the British Isles, where he visitedscores of cities in Ireland, Scotland, and England (and at least one, Wrexham,in Wales), delivering speech after speech after speech. When he left the Statesaboard the steamship Cambria, he thought he’d be away for a few months at most,but his stay lasted much longer. This man cut out for a hero was also cut outfor traveling. He toured the British Isles for nearly two years.FREDERICK DOUGLASS, THE FUGITIVE SLAVE, WHOSE NARRATIVE HAS BEEN SO EXTENSIVELYREAD, WAS AMONG THE PASSENGERS THAT LEFT BOSTON ON SATURDAY, IN THE CAMBRIA. HEWILL SPEND SEVERAL MONTHS IN GREAT BRITAIN, WHERE HE WILL NO DOUBT BE SOMETHINGOF A “LION.”—WORCESTER’S MASSACHUSETTS SPYDuring his more than six hundred days across the Atlantic, Frederick never saton a gravestone in the rain while others comfortably lunched. He lodged in thehomes of leading citizens, in fine hotels. Letters to Garrison, which he rightlyassumed would be reprinted in the Liberator, recounted examples of thefirst-class treatment he received, such as the breakfast for him in Cork,Ireland, in the fall of 1845. The venue, Lloyd’s, was one of the city’s finesthotels. Distinguished guests included Cork’s mayor, Richard Dowden Richard.Image [../images/f0022-01.jpg]The Anti-Slavery Society Convention, 1840 (oil on canvas, 1841). About fourhundred delegates were in London for this June 12–23 event to promote theabolition of slavery the world over. Charles Lenox Remond and Wendell Phillipswere among the American delegates. The white man addressing the crowd isEngland’s Thomas Clarkson, who spent most of his adult life fighting for the endof the Atlantic slave trade (achieved in law, if not in practice, in 1808) andfor the end of slavery. The black man seated in the foreground is HenryBeckford, a Jamaican schoolteacher who spent more than twenty years in slavery.Had Frederick been an active abolitionist in 1840, he might have attended thisconvention, which, sadly, allowed female abolitionists only to observe.WE ARE HIGHLY GRATIFIED TO FIND THAT ANOTHER ANTISLAVERY MEETING WILL BE HELD INTHE INDEPENDENT CHAPEL, ON THIS (MONDAY) EVENING [OCTOBER 27, 1845]. WE ARE GLADTHAT THE PEOPLE WILL HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF LISTENING TO A MAN—WHO IS ASAMIABLE AND INTERESTING IN PRIVATE AND SOCIAL LIFE, AS HE IS ORIGINAL ANDELOQUENT IN HIS CAPACITY OF PUBLIC LECTURER.—CORK EXAMINER, IrelandRarely facing racism, Frederick was reborn. He felt so free. To chat withrelatives of the Scottish poet Robert Burns when in Ayr. To marvel atEdinburgh’s monument to the wondrous writer Sir Walter Scott. To visit London’sart galleries, botanic gardens, and other attractions. Thanks to Garrison’s goodfriend the English orator George Thompson, while in London Frederick had afront-row seat to a three-hour debate in Parliament. He couldn’t imagine havingan opportunity like that in the U.S. Congress.Grand, too, was the day Frederick met Daniel O’Connell, the Irish Catholics’“Liberator” or “Emancipator.” For years this big, bulky, magnetic man andriveting speaker had crusaded for the repeal of England’s anti–Roman Catholiclaws, such as those barring Catholics from serving in Parliament. After hebecame a member of Parliament, O’Connell campaigned for Ireland’s independencefrom Britain, which officially santioned only Protestantism.Image [../images/f0025-01.jpg]Detail from Daniel O’Connell (oil on millboard, 1834).Frederick admired O’Connell’s devotion to his people, reveled in his fightingspirit. He was grateful to him, too. Like George Thompson, O’Connell had beenamong the activists who for years crusaded for the abolition of slavery in theBritish Empire, which finally began in 1833. Also like Thompson, O’Connellagitated for the end of slavery in the States.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Along with the pleasant, Frederick faced worrisome, even depressing things, too.In a letter to Garrison from Montrose, Scotland, in the winter of 1846, herevealed that in Dublin he dreaded stepping foot outside his host’s home becausethe streets were “almost literally alive with beggars . . . some of them merestumps of men, without feet, without legs, without hands, without arms—andothers still more horribly deformed.” The sight of filthy, ragged childrenfending for themselves was equally heartbreaking. When Frederick got a look atsome poor people’s huts—“I see much here to remind me of my former condition.”Scenes of squalor and suffering, a year into a great hunger that plagued Irishpeasants, brought home the idea that “the cause of humanity is one the worldover. He who really and truly feels for the American slave cannot steel hisheart to the woes of others; and he who thinks himself an abolitionist, yetcannot enter into the wrongs of others, has yet to find a true foundation forhis anti-slavery faith.”Image [../images/common5.jpg]Frederick had his own demons to deal with as well. He suffered one of his “fitsof melancholy” that spring. Lucky for him, when out for a walk he spotted in ashop window a violin, an instrument he loved to play. After he bought this “oldfiddle,” he hurried back to his hotel room. Ten minutes into a Scottish jig hisdepression began to lift. “They say music is good for insane people,” he wroteto a friend in Lynn. And he believed everybody was more or less insane “attimes.”Events back home also had Frederick down. On May 13, 1846, the United Statesdeclared war on Mexico. The pretext was a border dispute between Mexico andTexas that had escalated into skirmishes between Mexican and American soldiers.Like other abolitionists, Frederick frowned on this war as nothing but a way forslaveholding President James Polk and his fellow slaveholders to get more landfor slavery’s expansion. The war was about out-and-out “robbery of Mexico,”Frederick wrote to a friend in the States.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Frederick was more than a celebrity lecturer and sightseer while abroad. He wasalso a man of business. With his supply of Narrative dwindling, he oversaw thepublication of a new edition shortly after he arrived in Ireland. Published inDublin in late September 1845, it had a printing of 2,000 copies.“Well, all my books went last night at one blow,” Frederick informed his printer(and sometime host), Richard Webb, from Belfast in early December 1845. “I wantmore. I want more.” And more books he got, but then a few weeks later, writingfrom Glasgow, Scotland, Frederick asked Webb to send him three hundred copies.By then Webb was scheduled to print another 2,000 copies of Narrative. “Get asgood, and if you can get better paper than that used in the first edition,”instructed Frederick.Image [../images/f0028-01.jpg]View of Edinburgh from the Ramparts of the Castle, Looking East (watercolor withgum arabic over pencil on paper, c. 1846). Far left is the towering gothicmemorial to Walter Scott, whose hero in his narrative poem Lady of the Lake isScottish revolutionary James Douglas. Frederick took that man’s surname at theurging of a friend in New Bedford. Why he added a second “s” is unknown.Image [../images/common5.jpg]With those Dublin editions of Narrative, Frederick didn’t only earn extra money(about $750 from the first edition alone)—he also learned a little abouttypesetting, paper, and other facets of publishing. And while he told Garrisonabout his publishing venture, Frederick didn’t consult with him or anyone elseat MASS about the changes he made. Chief among them was the preface he penned,in which he explained the reasons for his trip: to keep clear of slave catchers,to broaden his horizons, and to lecture on the horrors of slavery.Frederick’s preface preceded Garrison’s and Phillips’ testimonials. By makinghis the first voice readers heard, Frederick was taking a giant step in his roadto independence. Resentment had been building for a while.MASS had one of its white members, James Buffum, accompany Frederick to theBritish Isles and keep tabs on him. Also Frederick found out that someGarrisonians worried that he was becoming spoiled by all the attention lavishedon him. What’s more, Frederick knew that Maria Weston Chapman, Garrison’s righthand, had written to Richard Webb of her concern that for Frederick the tour wasall about him and his book and not about MASS. Even more insulting, Chapman hadasked Webb to be watchful when Frederick collected money intended for MASS,suggesting that either he was inept at handling money or he had sticky fingers.Or both.Even before he left for the British Isles, Frederick was getting fed up with thepaternalism and we-know-best attitude of many white Garrisonians. He had beenurged repeatedly to stick to the script when lecturing—just tell his story andleave the analysis to the white speakers. “We will take care of the philosophy”was how one man put it. Frederick had also been pressed to spice his talks withplantation dialect to avoid coming across as too learned.By the time he reached the British Isles, Frederick was sick of some whitecolleagues seeing him in such narrow terms. A fugitive slave who gave greatspeeches. Not truly as an equal, or as a man. A man who devoured books, losinghimself in works of New Englanders Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry WadsworthLongfellow, Scotland’s Robert Burns and Thomas Carlyle, England’s John Miltonand William Shakespeare. Frederick also relished the work of the English rebelpoet Lord Byron. A passage from Byron’s 1812 epic poem Childe Harold’sPilgrimage became a motto: “Hereditary bondsmen! Know ye not / Who would be freethemselves must strike the blow?”And there was Frederick’s mind, ever searching, ever seeking. He was no longerin lockstep with every aspect of Garrison’s brand of abolitionism. If, in fact,he had never fully embraced it, then he was tired of faking it.Garrison championed Disunion: a call for the free states to break away from theslave states. “No Union with Slaveholders!” Garrison practically shouted fromthe rooftops, believing slaves states a corrupting influence on free states.But if the free states jettisoned the slave states, wouldn’t Frederick’s 3million brethren in bondage be essentially abandoned?Garrison also advocated moral suasion—appeals to people’s hearts and minds—asthe only way to bring about an end to slavery. Never violence.In a July 1846 letter to British reformer Elizabeth Pease penned in Belfast,Frederick—probably born of violence, subjected to violence so many times, andsomeone who resorted to violence himself—wrote that, no, he did notcategorically repudiate all use of physical force.Politics? Heaven forbid! said Garrison. He condemned the U.S. Constitution as aproslavery document. He called it—as he called the North-South union—a “covenantwith death and an agreement with hell.” The Constitution had made a deal withthe devil (slaveholders), for example, with its clause allowing an enslavedperson to be counted as three-fifths of a person and thereby allowing slavestates not as much representation in Congress as they wanted but more than mostNortherners wanted them to have. Die-hard Garrisonians contended that withslaveholders in control of the government and the government upholding slavery,the government was fundamentally evil. It was therefore immoral to vote or holdpolitical office. Garrisonians regarded a political abolitionist—someone whosought to bring about change by working within the system—as a disgrace.But Frederick now had a new hero in Daniel O’Connell.Image [../images/common5.jpg]William Lloyd Garrison had been imprisoned for the sacred cause, was almostlynched for the sacred cause, had bounties placed upon his head for the sacredcause, had been burned in effigy. Garrison had done so much for Frederick—been amentor, at moments like a father—but “I was growing, and needed room.”So there Frederick was in mid-1846 wrestling with whether or not to sit tightand not rock the boat or captain his own ship. By the fall, and still abroad, hemade up his mind to strike out on his own. He knew some Garrisonians would callhim an ingrate. Arrogant, even. But if he didn’t go his own way—how stultifying.Frederick hadn’t broken free from slavery to be yoked in freedom.And he had his freedom—his legal liberty—on December 5, 1846. Friends in GreatBritain had purchased it for a little over $711 from Hugh Auld, whose brother,Thomas, had sold him the rights to Frederick back in the fall of 1845.A few months after Frederick had his freedom, on Tuesday, March 30, 1847, therewas a farewell soiree for him at the posh London Tavern. George Thompsonpresided over the party. Guests included English author William Howitt and RungoBapogee, an emissary of an East Indian prince, the raja of Satara.Among those invited but unable to attend was the Bishop of Norwich, alreadyscheduled to be somewhere else. So was writer Charles Dickens. When he sent hisregrets, Dickens said, “I trust I need hardly say that I feel a warm interest inany occasion designed as a denunciation of slavery and a mark of sympathy withany one who has escaped from its tremendous wrongs and horrors.”At that soiree, Frederick thanked his supporters for his freedom and for all thehospitality in a nearly 13,000-word speech he called “the free upgushings of aheart overborne with grateful emotions at the remembrance of the kindness I havereceived in this country from the day I landed until the present moment.”That kindness included a fund-raising drive already under way to help him starta newspaper, the North Star, his “ship.”But before he did that, Frederick needed to spend some time with his wife andchildren.Image [../images/common2.jpg]"},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0036-01.jpg]This c. 1850 photograph is a copy of a c. 1847 daguerreotype.CHAPTER 3Image [../images/common4.jpg]SHIPS UPON A STORMY SEAWhen Frederick returned to Lynn in late April 1847, he faced a son who wasclueless as to who his father was. Two-and-a-half-year old Charley had been tenmonths old when Frederick went abroad.Frederick’s other two sons, Lewis and Frederick Jr., six and five, rememberedhim just fine. He was within fifty yards of his home when they came “running anddancing” toward him. His oldest, Rosetta, nearly eight, surely would have racedto meet her father, too, but she was at school in Albany, New York, more than150 miles due west of Lynn, where she boarded with two white family friends (andabolitionists), the sisters Abigail and Lydia Mott.As for Frederick’s wife, Anna, was she standing in the doorway beaming? How shereacted at the sight of her husband after nearly two years is a mystery. So is alot about this woman, of whom Frederick wrote very little.It was freeborn Anna, a laundress and housekeeper in Baltimore, who taught himto play the violin. And without her, Frederick might never have made that greatescape, posing as a free sailor in a red shirt, blue trousers, black tie, andtarpaulin hat.Anna provided the sailor’s disguise and money Frederick needed for a sailor’sprotection pass and to take a train from Baltimore to Havre de Grace, Maryland,for a ferry across the Susquehanna River to catch a train to Wilmington,Delaware, to get a steamboat to Philadelphia, where he boarded another train.Next stop, New York City. There he spent several days homeless—andterrified—until a black man steered him to Underground Railroad stationmasterDavid Ruggles.As promised, Frederick wrote to Anna from New York City. As planned, shepromptly joined him. Straightaway they married. When the newlyweds left for NewBedford in mid-September on Ruggles’ advice (too many slave catchers in New YorkCity), they didn’t go empty-handed. They had five dollars from Ruggles andAnna’s bounty: along with clothing, she had brought dishes, cutlery, andbedding, among other needful things. Chances are Anna brought a little moneywith her, too. And during their early days in New Bedford, Frederick wasn’tmaking ends meet alone. Anna, equally industrious, took in laundry and did otherdomestic work.As Frederick’s star rose, Anna rarely traveled with him, never craved thelimelight, but stayed in the shadows. About five years older than him and notliterate, Anna was apparently content to take care of hearth and home—and mostimportant, of Frederick. When he was on the road, she sent him fresh changes ofclothes. Even when she had help with the family’s laundry, only she could“smooth the tucks in father’s linen,” remembered daughter Rosetta. “It was herpleasure to know that when he stood up before an audience that his linen wasimmaculate and that she had made it so.” Anna also contributed to the sacredcause by participating in sewing circles in which women gathered to make toys,quilts, shawls, and other items to be sold at antislavery fairs.Image [../images/f0040-01.jpg]A flyer for an antislavery fair in Boston (c. December 1856).Just as Frederick never wrote of the critical role Anna played in his escape, henever told the world how she managed during his long absence and the pleasantsurprise that awaited him when he returned home: a bank book showing deposits ofthe money he had periodically sent, along with deposits of money Anna had earneddoing piecework for local shoe factories. And she did this despite being sickly.“My dear Anna is not well,” Frederick wrote an English friend upon his return.But his wife, who “seldom enjoys good health,” was in better shape than heexpected, well enough to go with him to Albany in a few days to see theirdaughter. In that same letter he hinted that he was pressing on with his plansto start his own newspaper.For that, Frederick faced stiff opposition from many Garrisonians. They arguedthat he couldn’t pull it off, that there was no need for another antislaverypaper, and that he was most needed as a lecturer.They also tried to dissuade him by offering him a job as a correspondent for theNational Anti-Slavery Standard, the official weekly of MASS’s parentorganization, which Garrison had also helped form and of which he was president:the American Anti-Slavery Society headquartered in New York City (and for whichFrederick also lectured). In a letter to Garrison, a Standard editor, EdmundQuincy, called Frederick cocky for asking for $2.50 per article (over the $1Quincy thought sufficient). Quincy eventually gave in but stipulated thatFrederick couldn’t earn more than a hundred dollars a year from this work.Frederick began writing for the Standard while on the road. Never mind that histhroat was troubling him, in early August 1847 he packed his bags and set out totour Pennsylvania, Ohio, then New York State. During his nearly three months onthe road, and once again away from his family, Frederick traveled over threethousand miles and delivered more than 150 speeches. As before, he sometimestraveled solo, sometimes with Garrison and others.When Frederick returned to Lynn in early October, he was on course to launch theNorth Star, buoyed all the more after he went through a pile of mail. An October1, 1847, letter from J. D. Carr, founder of a famous biscuit company inCarlisle, England, contained a bank draft for a little over £445. This money,raised by British supporters, translated into $2,175 (equivalent to about$55,000 today). In thanking Carr a month later, Frederick told him that he hadalready bought “an excellent and elegant [printing] press, and nearly all thenecessary printing materials.”Image [../images/f0042-01.jpg]Rochester (hand-colored engraving, c. 1850). Residents Amy and Isaac Post urgedFrederick to relocate to their city upon learning that he planned to start hisown newspaper.New venture. New venue. Frederick settled on Rochester, New York, about fourhundred miles west of Boston. Nicknamed the “Young Lion of the West,” Rochesterhad begun to boom with the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825. Unlike Boston,Rochester was a hotbed of political abolitionism.Leaving Anna and their boys in Lynn, Frederick moved to Rochester in the fall of1847. He boarded with a black friend, Charles Joiner, a “clothes scourer” (orcleaner) who lived at 48 Atwater Street, about a fifteen-minute walk from whereFrederick rented office space in downtown Rochester.Nothing grand. Just a single room on the second floor of 25 Buffalo Street, theTalman Building (now 25 East Main Street). White attorney Henry Hunter and D. D.T. Moore, the white publisher and proprietor of the Genesee Farmer, a monthlyjournal, were among Frederick’s fellow tenants in the Talman Building, where thefirst issue of the North Star rolled off the press on December 3, 1847.Subscription price: $2 a year.[FREDERICK] NEVER OPENED TO ME HIS LIPS ON THE SUBJECT [OF THE NORTH STAR], NORASKED MY ADVICE. . . . HIS CONDUCT . . . HAS BEEN IMPULSIVE, INCONSIDERATE, ANDHIGHLY INCONSISTENT.—WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, in Cleveland, Ohio, to his wife, Helen“The object of the North Star will be to attack Slavery in all its forms andaspects; advocate Universal Emancipation; exalt the standard of Public Morality;promote the moral and intellectual improvement of the colored people; and hastenthe day of FREEDOM to the three millions of our enslaved fellow countrymen.”This was the North Star’s mission statement.“Right is of no sex—Truth is of no color—God is the Father of us all, and all weare Brethren.” This was the initial motto of the four-page weekly, whichFrederick expected thousands of souls to look to for direction just as thousandsescaping slavery looked to the firmament’s North Star in their perilous journeyto a free state.Image [../images/f0045-01.jpg]From the first issue of the North Star.Image [../images/f0046-01.jpg]Detail from William Cooper Nell (photograph of an engraving, date unknown). As ateen, this son of a middle-class couple was secretary of a Garrisonian youthgroup. He also worked for the Liberator as a messenger and printer’s apprentice.In the early 1840s, he was at the forefront of Boston’s equal school rightsmovement (achieved in 1855 and today known as the school desegregationmovement). Nell wrote two of the first histories of blacks in America. Thebest-known one is The Colored Patriots of the American Revolution (1855).Working with Frederick on his North Star was printer John Dick, a whiteEnglishman. Serving as publisher (the person in charge of the actual productionof the paper) was black Bostonian William C. Nell, another writer for theLiberator and MASS lecturer. Frederick also had a coeditor, someone he’d metduring his August–October tour: physician Martin Delany of Pittsburgh,Pennsylvania, editor of the soon-to-be-defunct Mystery, the first black-ownednewspaper west of the Allegheny Mountains.That first issue of the North Star included a report on a recent blackconvention in Troy, New York, and a notice of Rochester’s upcoming antislaveryfair. The featured article was Frederick’s nearly 3,000-word open letter toKentucky slaveholder Senator Henry Clay. Frederick pummeled the senator forgiving yet another speech pushing his pet project: colonization, getting morefree blacks to leave the country, preferably for Liberia, West Africa.THE [FIRST ISSUE] OF THE NORTH STAR IS JUST WHAT IT SHOULD BE—A BEACON LIGHT OFLIBERTY.—DAVID RUGGLES, Northampton, MassachusettsIn weeks to come the North Star offered reports on anti-slavery meetings,speeches by abolitionists, and notices of upcoming lectures by Frederick andother abolitionists. There was news of fugitive slaves captured and of slavecatchers thwarted. There were reports on “colorphobia,” as experienced inPhiladelphia by David Peck, the first black graduate of an American medicalschool (Chicago’s Rush Medical College, in spring 1847). When Dr. Peck turned upto review and possibly bid on medical books at the auction house M. Thomas &Sons, he was asked to leave because of the color of his skin.The twin monsters of darkness were not Frederick’s only concerns. His papercarried items on prison reform (including the abolition of the death penalty),environmental issues, the connection between dreams while sleeping and physicalhealth, and the campaign against the consumption of alcohol, a movement known astemperance. There were also articles on noble souls like Dorothea Dix, whoadvocated for the humane treatment of the mentally ill. The North Star carriedpoetry as well.I HASTEN TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE RISING OF THE NORTH STAR. . . . I HAVE READIT ALL WITH ENTIRE SATISFACTION—MUCH OF IT WITH DELIGHT. . . . I HOPE YOU WILLWRITE ANOTHER LETTER TO HENRY CLAY, AND EXPOSE HIS FOLLY ON THE SUBJECT OFCOLONIZATION.—SAMUEL J. MAY, a white reformer and Unitarian minister in Syracuse, New YorkFrederick’s paper also ran letters from Martin Delany about events in his neckof the woods. After shuttering the Mystery, in March 1848 Delany embarked on aneight-month tour of western Pennsylvania and Ohio to lecture, gather news forthe North Star, and, more important, raise an army of subscribers in the region.Other correspondents included James McCune Smith, a graduate of the Universityof Glasgow (1837) and the first black licensed physician to practice in theUnited States. Yet another correspondent was noted lecturer William Wells Brown,who had escaped from slavery in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1834. Two years afterpublishing Frederick’s Narrative, MASS published Narrative of William W. Brown,a Fugitive Slave, a book almost as popular as Frederick’s.WE REGARD [FREDERICK DOUGLASS] AS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF LIVING MEN.IT WOULD SEEM AS IF PROVIDENCE HAD RAISED HIM UP TO DELIVER HIS RACE FROMBONDAGE.—CLEVELAND TRUE DEMOCRAT, a white-owned newspaperOf course, the North Star always carried Frederick’s thoughts on current events.The uprisings against tyrannical regimes that rocked Italy, France, and otherEuropean nations beginning in January 1848: Frederick was ecstatic. During theRevolutions of 1848—also known as the Springtime of the Peoples—all Frenchmengained the right to vote, and in Austria serfdom was abolished. Frederick longedfor a storm of reform to rush onto America’s shores: “We live in times whichhave no parallel in the history of the world,” he declared. “Kingdoms, realms,empires, and republics roll to and fro like ships upon a stormy sea. . . . Thegrand conflict of the angel Liberty with the monster Slavery has at last come.The globe shakes with the contest.”Image [../images/common5.jpg]No doubt convinced that his newspaper was here to stay, in February 1848,Frederick moved his family to Rochester. In April, he purchased a two-story,nine-room brick house at 4 Alexander Street, about a twenty-minute walk from hisoffice.At 4 Alexander Street, chess and checkers were played; Frederick was heardsinging and playing the violin (and Rosetta played the piano when school let outfor the summer).Anna cultivated a gorgeous garden at 4 Alexander Street. Gardening was one ofher prime delights, probably second only to seeing to Frederick’s every need andthose of his guests when it came to food and drink. But not much conversation.She typically did not partake in drawing-room talk, especially if those guestswere white and doubly so if they were the ones who looked down their noses ather. Instead, she would retire to the kitchen or to another part of the house.Frederick’s sanctuary was a spartan upstairs room where he kept “a list of thewords he found it hard to spell,” remembered former next-door neighbor JaneMarsh Parker. She was about twelve when Frederick bought the house from a whiteabolitionist, a sale that had many whites in the neighborhood cringing andcarrying on, but, said Parker, after Frederick and his family moved in folkscalmed down. “Frederick Douglass was a gentleman and a good neighbor. Mrs.Douglass chose seclusion and the children were models of behavior.”Perhaps in hopes of getting Anna to be more engaged in his public life,Frederick hired someone to teach her to read and write. It didn’t work out,however. But it seems that Anna could read a little. During a sewing circle,when a young lady cross-stitched “Fredrick Douglass” onto a bookmark, Annaquickly spotted the mistake, revealing, wrote Parker, “that there was one namein the world that she could read and spell.”The move to brawny, bustling Rochester, population nearing 36,000, was hard onAnna. She had liked the much smaller Lynn, where she had a small circle offriends. Shortly after the move, in a letter to Rosetta’s guardians in Albany,the Mott sisters, Frederick reported that Anna had “not been well—or very goodhumored since we came here.”He was soon in a bad mood, too. Several months after its launch, the North Starwas floundering.Image [../images/f0052-01.jpg]Frederick sat for this daguerreotype in May 1848 while in New York City for anAmerican Anti-Slavery Society convention. Sometimes Frederick parted his hair onthe left, sometimes on the right. Not until the mid-1850s did he settle on hisiconic hairstyle evocative of a lion’s mane."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4Image [../images/common4.jpg]THE VOICE OF INSPIRATIONMartin Delany failed to raise an army of subscribers, in part because one of hislittle girls fell ill, then died. Other agents scattered around the North hadalso been unable to bring in a steady flow of subscriptions. What’s more,Frederick had, as he himself admitted, “very foolishly” spent about a thousanddollars on his printing press and its paraphernalia. That “excellent andelegant” piece of machinery turned out to be a dud. After the first issue, theNorth Star was printed on another press in the Talman Building for roughlytwenty dollars per issue.“I fear I have miscalculated,” Frederick wrote in the spring of 1848 to JuliaGriffiths, one of his white English friends. He was referring to the support hethought his paper would get.Whereas printing, postage, and sundries cost roughly sixty dollars a week,subscriptions brought in only about twenty-five dollars a week, and ads frombookshops, clothing stores, grocers, and the like not that much. The North Starhad about seven hundred subscribers at a time when it needed thousands.Though dejected, Frederick wasn’t about to give up. He told Julia Griffiths hewas confident that if he could keep his newspaper afloat for a year, all wouldbe well. To that end Frederick plowed his own money into his paper—evenmortgaged his home. He also took on all the speaking engagements he could get.For striking out on his own, he had been dropped from the speakers’ bureaus ofboth MASS and the American Anti-Slavery Society. He now secured engagementshimself and with the help of other organizations, such as the Western New YorkAnti-Slavery Society, formed in Rochester and with offices in the TalmanBuilding. When Frederick wrote to Julia Griffiths, he had just returned fromlecturing in upstate New York, seeking subscribers every step of the way.In the May 5, 1848, issue of the North Star, Frederick appealed to the publicfor help. He begged people to make donations, as the paper could not yet surviveon subscriptions alone. Two weeks later, “a very encouraging list” of newsubscribers came in, “drops of the coming shower!”On top of the financial strain, Frederick was having issues again with histhroat, which led to a tonsillectomy on June 23. “Though I have suffered much bythe operation,” he told his readers a week later, he was feeling much better. Hehoped to be back at the helm of the North Star within a few days.When Frederick returned to work, the going was still tough. May’s trickle of newsubscribers did not bespeak a shower. Equally irksome: most of his subscriberswere white. In the mid-July 1848 issue of the North Star, Frederick lashed outat the black community. Too many blacks were apathetic, he griped. He estimatedthat of the half million blacks in the North, “not more than two thousand can besupposed to take any special interest in measures for our own elevation; andprobably not more than fifteen hundred take, read, and pay for an anti-slaverypaper.”Though burdened and busy trying to save his paper, the following week Frederickjourneyed down to Seneca Falls, New York, to attend a women’s rights conventionspearheaded by two early North Star subscribers, Elizabeth Cady Stanton andLucretia Mott, sister-in-law of Abigail and Lydia Mott.Frederick was the lone black person among some three hundred people who turnedout for the historic July 19–20 convention in Wesleyan Chapel, an abolitionistchurch. Along with thirty-one other men and sixty-eight women, he signed thecrowning achievement: the Declaration of Sentiments. Patterned after theDeclaration of Independence, it demanded that women have equal pay for equalwork and equality of opportunity in every walk of life—and the vote.Women’s suffrage almost didn’t make it into the Declaration of Sentiments. Manywomen feared that asking for the vote was going too far and would open them upto great scorn. A desperate Elizabeth Cady Stanton, aware of Frederick’s supportfor women’s suffrage, pressed him to speak.The vote, he said—“the power to choose rulers and make laws”—was “the right bywhich all others could be secured.” When Frederick finished, he had changedenough minds for women’s suffrage to make it into the Declaration of Sentiments,though barely.The next week the North Star proudly reported on Seneca Falls: “The speaking,addresses, and resolutions of this extraordinary meeting were almost whollyconducted by women . . . and their whole proceedings were characterized bymarked ability and dignity.” Seneca Falls was not the first time people calledfor women’s rights, but it was the first real convention for that cause, oneFrederick would continue to champion. And he stayed on the move.Two months after Seneca Falls, in early September 1848, Frederick was at anotherconvention. This one, over which he presided, was a three-day nationalconvention of black men held in Cleveland, Ohio. Martin Delany was among theroughly sixty delegates, along with William Howard Day, a recent graduate ofOhio’s Oberlin College, and John Jones, a Chicago tailor on his way to becomingone of the wealthiest blacks in the Midwest.Items on the agenda at that Cleveland convention included the upcomingpresidential election. Delegates gave the thumbs-down to both major-partycandidates: General Zachary Taylor (Whig) and Michigan senator Lewis Cass(Democrat).Zachary Taylor, “Old Rough and Ready,” who emerged from the Mexican–American Wara national hero, was a slave-holder with plantations in Louisiana andMississippi. Lewis Cass was a leading advocate for the doctrine of popularsovereignty: letting settlers decide whether to allow slavery in the nation’snew territory. That new territory was the 525,000 square miles acquired fromMexico back in February 1848, through the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, whichbrought the Mexican–American War to an end.Image [../images/f0058-01.jpg]Detail from William Howard Day (unknown photograph type, 1870). Born in New YorkCity and raised in Northampton, Massachusetts, Day was the third black person toearn a bachelor’s degree from Ohio’s Oberlin College, an abolitioniststronghold. In 1853 he launched a newspaper in Cleveland: the Aliened American.Finding Taylor and Cass repugnant, Frederick and company backed the Free SoilParty candidate, former president Martin Van Buren. Founded in August 1848 inBuffalo, New York, this party (a forerunner of the Republican Party), as itsname suggests, wanted slavery banned in the new territories. (Come November,Frederick’s candidate wouldn’t win the election. Zachary Taylor would.)During the Cleveland convention Frederick and his comrades rededicatedthemselves to black liberation and elevation. They vowed to keep crusading forthe abolition of slavery. They pledged to encourage and to help more blacks getan education (especially in business) and acquire skills. These men wanted tosee fewer black chambermaids and chimney sweeps and more black carpenters, shopowners, lawyers, physicians, and teachers.Image [../images/f0059-01.jpg]Detail from Portrait of John Jones (oil on canvas, c. 1865). Jones becamewealthy through his thriving tailoring business in Chicago, where he and hiswife, Mary Jones, were Underground Railroad workers. This abolitionist alsofought for the repeal of Illinois Black Codes, laws that curbed black civilrights (accomplished in March 1865).Keep looking up was the supreme sentiment in Frederick’s keynote address. “Thespirit of the age—the voice of inspiration—the deep longings of the humansoul—the conflict of right with wrong—the upward tendency of the oppressedthroughout the world, abound with evidence complete and ample, of the finaltriumph of right over wrong, of freedom over slavery, and equality over caste[racism].”Frederick asserted that no black person in the nation was free so long as anyremained in chains. “We are one people,” he declared. And that “we” who werefree needed to strive for more independence and self-sufficiency. “To bedependent is to be degraded,” he said. “Men may indeed pity us, but they cannotrespect us.” Then Frederick went hyperbolic.“The houses we live in are built by white men—the clothes we wear are made bywhite tailors—the hats on our heads are made by white hatters, and the shoes onour feet are made by white shoe-makers, and the food that we eat is raised andcultivated by white men. Now it is impossible that we should ever be respectedas a people while we are so universally and completely dependent upon white menfor the necessaries of life. We must make white persons as dependent upon us aswe are upon them.”Support black press! Frederick also urged. And read, read, read!—newspapersalong with books to sharpen the mind and to “put to silence and to shame” whitepropaganda that blacks were an inferior and cursed people.Following that invigorating convention, which garnered national coverage,Frederick returned to Rochester where he faced an outrage.Image [../images/common5.jpg]I get along pretty well,” Rosetta, now nine, began when her father inquiredabout school; there were tears in her eyes as she continued, “but Father, MissTracy does not allow me to go into the room with the other scholars because I amcolored.” Miss Tracy was Lucilia Tracy, principal of Seward Seminary, anexclusive all-girls school a short walk from Frederick’s home. Frederick hadenrolled Rosetta in Seward in protest of Rochester’s segregated public schools.(For his sons he hired a private tutor.) Rosetta, whom he once called “the pulseof my heart,” had started school when Frederick was out of town.Furious over his daughter’s foul treatment, Frederick demanded to speak with herclassmates. Miss Tracy, an abolitionist and supposedly a Christian, agreed onthe condition that if even one girl objected to Rosetta’s presence, she would beexpelled. After Miss Tracy learned that none of the white girls had a problembeing in a classroom (or on the playground) with Rosetta, she raised the bar.Now their parents had to be polled.The next day when Rosetta went to school, she was told to pack up her things andgo home. One parent, H. G. Warner, editor of the Rochester Courier, hadobjected. Rosetta would soon be a student again in Albany, more than two hundredmiles east of Rochester.Frederick, who now added the desegregation of Rochester public schools to hislist of crusades (achieved in 1857), didn’t let the matter rest. He fired off aletter to H. G. Warner, chastising him for attempting to “degrade an innocentchild by excluding her from the benefit of attending a respectable school.”Frederick also went public. He published the letter in his newspaper, still indire straits. But help was on the way from two very different people. One livedabout 3,300 miles away as the crow flies, the other about a hundred.Image [../images/common5.jpg]In the summer of 1849 Frederick’s English friend Julia Griffiths, with heryounger sister, Eliza, arrived in Rochester, ready and able to organizefund-raisers for the North Star and serve as its business manager. JuliaGriffiths was also equipped to help Frederick become the better writer andeditor that he wanted to be with tutorials on grammar and editing. (Though hecontinued to send in articles, Delany ceased to be the paper’s coeditor afterthe June 29, 1849, issue.)Julia Griffiths’ presence in Frederick’s life was grist for the gossip mill.They spent long hours together at the office. They were frequently seen in thestreets of Rochester, along with Eliza, strolling, arm in arm, as was the customthen (regardless of gender). What’s more, the Griffiths sisters lived withFrederick and his family, which on March 22, 1849, had a new addition: anothergirl, Annie.Tongues wagged even more after Eliza Griffiths married Frederick’s printer, JohnDick, in 1850 and the couple moved to Canada. Busybodies no doubt assumed thatwith Eliza out of the picture, Frederick and Julia would spend more timetogether. Alone. The National Anti-Slavery Standard would call Julia a“Jezebel.” Mostly Frederick ignored the gossipmongers and focused on saving theNorth Star—and on not falling apart himself. In late 1850 thirty-two-year-oldFrederick had a serious attack of what Griffiths told reformer Gerrit Smith wasthought to be inflammatory rheumatism. Also, Frederick had suffered three badfalls and was “incapable of using his limbs to any extent.”Image [../images/common5.jpg]The quick-tempered and combative Gerrit Smith, whom Garrison detested, was thatlifesaver closer to home. After breaking with the Garrisonians in 1840, thisresident of Peterboro, New York, had helped form the Liberty Party. Itchampioned political abolitionism along with moral suasion. And this white mantruly put his money—or rather his land—where his mouth was when it came to blackuplift. Starting in 1846, Smith, who possessed more than a half million acres,began giving blacks land in the Adirondacks: forty-acre lots, for a total of140,000 acres to some 3,000 people by 1850. Smith, who needed to unload some ofhis holdings to reduce his tax burden anyway, had not only charity but alsopolitics in mind. In New York State, only black men who owned real estate worthat least $250 could vote.Image [../images/f0064-01.jpg]Detail from Gerrit Smith (ambrotype, c. 1840s). Smith’s home in Peterboro, NewYork, was a station on the Underground Railroad. Frederick summed up Smith as a“great-hearted” man.When the North Star made its debut, Gerrit Smith had sent Frederick a letter ofcongratulations and money for a two-year subscription. He later made donations.Sometimes fifty dollars, sometimes more. A friend-ship formed, cultivatedthrough debates (by mail), chiefly about whether the U.S. Constitution wasproslavery.Between receiving Smith’s letters and reading works by other thinkers, Frederickcame to embrace the Constitution as an antislavery document. He saw with neweyes that its preamble stated that the document had been established to, amongother things, ensure “domestic tranquility,” “promote the general welfare” ofits people, and “secure the blessings of liberty.”When Frederick went public with his change of mind, he faced the wrath ofGarrisonians. And new horizons.Image [../images/f0065-01.jpg]From the June 18, 1850, issue of the North Star.

Garrison, among others, successfully arguedthat it should approve only those condemning the Constitution as proslavery.Image [../images/f0067-01.jpg]Frederick sports chin hair in this daguerreotype taken in August 1852, in Akron,Ohio, when he went to nearby Salem, Ohio, for the Western Anti-Slavery Society’sannual meeting. Other speakers included Sojourner Truth, who had escaped slaveryin upstate New York in 1826. Frederick first met Truth in the early 1840s whenshe lived in a commune in Northampton, Massachusetts.Frederick withdrew the North Star from consideration and announced that he nowviewed the Constitution as antislavery. And not only that. He also now believedthat abolitionists should use both moral suasion and political action in serviceto the sacred cause.Many Garrisonians, including friend Charles Remond, howled over Frederick’sshift to political abolitionism. Hostility increased several weeks later when onJune 26, 1851, the North Star, with a circulation up to more than 4,000, wasreplaced by Frederick Douglass’ Paper. “All Rights for All” its motto.Frederick Douglass’ Paper was a merger of the North Star and the GerritSmith–funded Liberty Party Paper published in Syracuse by John Thomas, a whiteman. Smith was the major financial backer of Frederick’s new weekly, for whichhe wore two hats: publisher and editor. (North Star publisher William C. Nell, aGarrison loyalist, had resigned.) John Thomas was Frederick’s assistant editor,and Julia Griffiths stayed on as business manager and fund-raiser (until 1855when she returned to England, where she married Reverend Henry O. Crofts).Frederick’s oldest boys, Lewis and Frederick Jr., eleven and nine, also workedon the paper, delivering and mailing it out, among other things. As always, Annacared for the children, the home, and Frederick’s linen. She also kept atradition: a special meal on publication day.Frederick had high hopes for his new paper and had very much wanted it to be amore handsome number. “The paper must be clean, white and strong,” he hadwritten Gerrit Smith in early June 1851. “The ink pure, black, and glossy.” Toget the paper off to a smart start he had asked Smith for two hundreddollars—“the rest I will raise myself.”IN BECOMING A VOTER IN THIS UNION, MR.

AS IN THIS COUNTRY IT HAS A PECULIAR SIGNIFICANCE, INCONNECTION WITH SLAVERY; BECAUSE OF ITS BREVITY; BECAUSE IT WHOLLY AVOIDS THEAPPEARANCE OF EGOTISM.—THE LIBERATORFor Frederick, raising his spirits was harder than raising money at times. Hestill had those bouts of melancholy. In late 1851 Griffiths (no longer living at4 Alexander Street) wrote to Gerrit Smith of her fear that Frederick was losing“his balance of mind.” She said he talked of “going crazy.” Also at that time,Frederick was suffering from an ulcerated throat.Still, in the pages of his newspaper and behind lecterns, Frederick keptcrusading against the twin monsters of darkness. Colonization schemes, too.Blacks had watered America’s soil with their tears, nourished it with theirblood, tilled it with their hands, said Frederick in an 1851 debate with twowhite men arguing that Jamaica, West Indies, was an ideal place for free blacksto go. Yes, blacks had it hard in the States, said Frederick, but this was home.“Amid all our afflictions there is an invincible determination to stay righthere.”Image [../images/f0071-01.jpg]From the June 8, 1855, issue of Frederick Douglass’ Paper, with the subtitle“Devoted to the Rights of All Mankind, Without Distinction of Color, Class, orClime.”Some blacks disagreed. The United States would never be a true home. They’dalways be outcasts. White hatred was too strong, too deep. Thousands of blackshad emigrated over the years (mostly to Liberia). And interest in emigration wasnow on the rise, thanks to the Compromise of 1850.Crafted by Senator Henry Clay, this series of laws sought to ease the tensionbetween slave and free states over the land acquired through theMexican–American War. The laws included admitting California as a free state andabolishing slave trading (but not slavery) in the District of Columbia—twothings Frederick could cheer. But with them came what he called “a hell-blackenactment”: a new, more vicious Fugitive Slave Law. Now anyone who aided peoplewho took their liberty could be fined up to a thousand dollars and imprisonedfor up to six months. What’s more, federal marshals had to assist slave catchersand could even dragoon other people into doing the same. With a black person’sword carrying no weight, free blacks were in greater jeopardy of being hauledinto slavery.After Clay’s compromise passed in September 1850, thousands of blacks—freeborn,freed, and self-emancipated—fled the States, most for Canada. This exodus surelyled to a spike in Frederick’s Underground Railroad work. He had been serving asa conductor and stationmaster since he moved to Rochester, about a hundred mileseast from St. Catherines in Canada West (present-day Ontario). Anna was on duty,too. As Rosetta remembered, she was “called up at all hours of the night, coldor hot as the case may be, to prepare supper for a hungry lot of fleeinghumanity.”Frederick and Anna aided about four hundred people over the years. He likened itto “an attempt to bail out the ocean with a teaspoon,” but one less person inbondage was a triumph still. White coworkers included Rochester pharmacist IsaacPost and his wife, Amy—both good friends; former head of the girls’ departmentof Canajoharie Academy Susan B. Anthony, another Rochester friend; and farmerGideon Pitts Jr. and his wife, Jane, in Honeoye, New York, about thirty milessouth of Rochester. Black conductors and stationmasters in upstate New Yorkincluded Frederick’s good friend Reverend Jermain Wesley Loguen, a native ofTennessee who, like Frederick, had been sired by a white man (his owner), hadescaped slavery in the 1830s when in his twenties, and would in a few years,write his autobiography.It is believed that “fleeing humanity” was brought to Frederick’s house at leastonce by Harriet Tubman, to whom he would one day write, “I have wrought in theday—you in the night. I have had the applause of the crowd and the satisfactionthat comes of being approved by the multitude, while the most that you have donehas been witnessed by a few trembling, scarred, and foot-sore bondmen and women,whom you have led out of the house of bondage, and whose heartfelt ‘God blessyou’ has been your only reward. The midnight sky and the silent stars have beenthe witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism.”This risky business of helping freedom-seekers became a little less so when in1852 Frederick moved his family from 4 Alexander Street to a secluded hillsidefarm near Rochester’s southern city line. This new home was on the South St.Paul Road (renamed South Avenue in the mid-1850s).As Frederick served on the Underground Railroad, as he lectured and wrote, as hegot his newspaper out, he had to reach deep into a reservoir of faith to keepgoing. Faith in the land of his birth. Faith that more white people would cometo their senses and recognize that people are of one blood. Faith, too, that Godwas on his side. Faith kept Frederick hoping on.All was not grim, even his famous speech on July 5, 1852, in Rochester’sCorinthian Hall, in which he essentially raised the question, “What to the slaveis the Fourth of July?”; in which he said to white people, “This Fourth [of]July is yours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn”; in which he said thatto an enslaved person “your celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, anunholy license; your national greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds ofrejoicing are empty and heartless; your denunciations of tyrants, brass frontedimpudence; your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; your prayers andhymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, andsolemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy—athin veil to cover up crimes which would disgrace a nation of savages”—even thatspeech closed on a note of hope.Frederick concluded with a recitation of Garrison’s poem “The Triumph ofFreedom,” a prayer for God to “speed” the year, the day, the hour “of jubilee,”the day of liberty. It ends: “And never from my chosen post, / Whate’er theperil or the cost, / Be driven.”Frederick remained the optimist after May 30, 1854, the day the Kansas-NebraskaAct cleared Congress. It repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, which, inadmitting Maine to the Union as a free state and Missouri as a slave state,banned slavery in the rest of the land acquired in the Louisiana Purchase (1803)above the parallel 36º 30'. This land included the territories of Kansas andNebraska. Now, said the Kansas–Nebraska Act, slavery in these lands would be amatter of popular sovereignty.Two months after passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act, in a commencement addressat Ohio’s Western Reserve College, Frederick was still keeping hope alive: “Theten thousand horrors of slavery, striking hard upon the sensitive soul, havebruised, and battered, and stung, but have not killed. The poor bondsman lifts asmiling face above the surface of a sea of agonies, hoping on, hoping ever.” Ifpeople in bondage were not in utter despair, how could he be?Frederick hoped on, hoped ever, while at work on his second autobiography, themore than 450-page My Bondage and My Freedom. New details about his youthincluded time spent with a Mr. Lawson, an elderly black man in Baltimore whodrove a dray and lived a “life of prayer.” Lawson, Frederick’s spiritual father,had told the lad that God had “a great work” for him to do.THIS MORNING IS THE THIRD DAY SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS’ . . .MY BONDAGE AND MY FREEDOM. WE LEARN FROM THE PUBLISHERS THAT NOT A SINGLE COPYOF THE FIRST EDITION REMAINS ON HAND. 5,000 COPIES COMPRISE THE EDITION, AND INTWO DAYS THE WHOLE ARE GONE.—AUBURN DAILY ADVERTISERNear the end of My Bondage, published in August 1855 with a dedication to GerritSmith and an introduction by good friend Dr. James McCune Smith, Frederick saidof the abolitionist movement, “I am sober, but not hopeless.” His hope lay inthe belief that the antislavery movement was unstoppable. If a thousand of hiscomrades were “struck down,” its ranks would remain “invincible.” In his closingline he wrote, “it is the faith of my soul that this anti-slavery cause willtriumph.”Frederick hoped on, hoped ever, after May 21, 1856, when proslavery forces laidwaste to Lawrence, Kansas, an anti-slavery stronghold.After May 22, when on the Senate floor South Carolina slaveholder RepresentativePreston Brooks used his walking stick to beat nearly to death Massachusettsabolitionist Senator Charles Sumner. Payback for Sumner’s insults againstSouthern soil and Brooks’ family in a recent speech, “Crime against Kansas,” acondemnation of forces working to keep that territory from being free soil.Frederick hoped on, hoped ever, after Preston Brooks was fined $300 but receivedno prison time for his crime against Sumner.Frederick’s hope was not dashed after March 6, 1857, when the U.S. Supreme Courthanded down its 7–2 Dred Scott decision. The Court denied Dred and Harriet Scotttheir freedom, freedom their attorney thought they could get because their ownerhad them living on free soil for quite a while (some of it in WisconsinTerritory). But, said Chief Justice Roger Taney, the Scotts had no standing infederal court as they were not—and even if free never could be—U.S. citizens.Added to that, neither the Declaration of Independence nor the Constitution gaveblack people rights, because they were a people “so far inferior that they hadno rights which the white man was bound to respect.” The ruling also said thatCongress had no right to ban slavery in the territories.“You will readily ask me how I am affected by this devilish decision—thisjudicial incarnation of wolfishness?” That was Frederick a month later in anearly 8,000-word speech in Rochester. His “hopes were never brighter than now.”Yes, the Supreme Court was a powerful institution, but “the Supreme Court of theAlmighty is greater.” Frederick believed outrage over the Dred Scott decisionwould result in a surge of support for the sacred cause.But other blacks insisted that the situation was hopeless, and emigration theonly recourse. New York’s Reverend Henry Highland Garnet was in this camp. In1858 Garnet formed the African Civilization Society, calling for the blackcommunity’s best and brightest to join him in building a cotton industry inAfrica’s upper Niger River region in present-day Nigeria.Frederick argued that Garnet’s Society—like Clay’s American ColonizationSociety—was based “upon the lying assumption that white and black people cannever live in the same land on terms of equality.” That upbraiding wasn’t inFrederick Douglass’ Paper but in the February 1859 Douglass’ Monthly, launchedin June 1858 as a four-page digest aimed at British readers. It became aseparate sixteen-page publication in January 1859, a month before Frederick’scritique of Garnet’s movement.Back in 1849, when Garnet promoted immigration to Jamaica, Frederick tried tosabotage his upcoming lecture tour in England in service of the Free Producemovement (a boycott of food and other items created by slave labor). Frederickbasically said, England Beware! Garnet’s motives were suspect, he asserted,because the man had never promoted the Free Produce movement in the States.Frederick also went to war with his former coeditor Martin Delany overemigration. His paper covered Delany’s convention on emigration in Clevelandduring the summer of 1854, but mostly in ways that belittled it. Delany was thenadvocating immigration to the Caribbean, Central America, or South America. Afew years and two more immigration conventions later, it was Africa. In mid-1859Delany went on an exploratory mission to Yoruba, most of which is in present-dayNigeria.The Caribbean, Central America, South America, Africa—Frederick thought it allabsurd. Black emigrationists were as wrongheaded as white colonizationists.Fueling the friction was Delany and Garnet’s unabashed pride in their skincolor. Both claimed that only African “blood” flowed through their veins, thusmaking them pure, unadulterated. Frederick, light skinned and half white, foundthat kind of talk irksome. “I thank God for making me a man simply,” heallegedly once scoffed, “but Delany always thanks him for making him a blackman.” For their part, Garnet and Delany thought Frederick craved friendshipswith white people overmuch.I KNEW, SIR, THAT IN YOUR HOT PURSUIT AFTER A WORTHLESS AND A TRANSIENT FAME,YOU WOULD SOMETIMES STOOP TO MEAN THINGS, BUT I NEVER DREAMED THAT YOU WOULDEVER SINK SO LOW, THAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO REACH UP, STANDING ON TIP-TOE, TO FINDTHAT LEVEL OF MEANNESS WHERE COMMON KNAVES ARE INCLINED TO PAUSE. AH, SIR, THEGREEN-EYED MONSTER HAS MADE YOU MAD.—HENRY HIGHLAND GARNET, in a letter to Frederick upbraiding him for besmirchingGarnet’s characterWhile Frederick clamored for free blacks to stay in the States and fight forliberty and justice, he was nowhere near as zealous as his friend John Brown,who cast himself as an avenging angel in a drama penned by God. When the two menfirst met back in late 1847, in Springfield, Massachusetts, where John Brownthen lived, Frederick was awestruck by the “lean, strong, and sinewy” Brown,whose bluish-gray eyes were “full of light and fire” when he spoke. Brown,nearly twenty years older, arrived in Rochester in late January 1858 and stayedin Frederick’s home for about a month. During that time he spent hours holed upin a bedroom working on his Provisional Constitution for the slavery-free statein the Allegheny Mountains he planned to found by force. Phase one was a raid onthe federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now in West Virginia), with aband of stouthearted men. That done, they’d rally enslaved people in the area toa great rebellion. As Brown worked on his plan, he found financial backing froma group of white men known as the “Secret Six.”Image [../images/f0082-01.jpg]Detail from Henry Highland Garnet (carte de visite, c. 1871). Like Frederick,Garnet was born in Maryland (New Market). He was nine when he escaped slaverywith his parents. The family settled in New York City, where his schoolmatesincluded Frederick’s good friend Dr. James McCune Smith. A graduate of theOneida Institute in Whitesboro, New York, Garnet pastored several Presbyterianchurches in the Northeast starting in 1842.“Come with me,” Brown pleaded with Frederick when they met in a stone quarrynear Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in early fall of 1859. Frederick didn’t thinkthe plan wise, didn’t think it would succeed. He told his friend no.Frederick was lecturing in Philadelphia’s National Hall on October 17, 1859,when someone interrupted with the news that John Brown’s raid, launched the daybefore, had failed. His guerrilla army of twenty-two men, five of whom wereblack and three of whom were his sons, were no match for a detachment ofMarines. Two of Brown’s sons and eight other men were dead; seven, including awounded John Brown, captured.Image [../images/f0083-01.jpg]Detail from Martin Robison Delany (carte de visite, c. 1863). Born free inCharles Town, Virginia (now in West Virginia), in 1833, Delany began a medicalapprenticeship with Dr. Andrew McDowell in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and laterstudied with other physicians. In the fall of 1850, along with Daniel Laing Jr.and Isaac Snowden (both of Boston), Delany became one of the first blacksadmitted to Harvard Medical School. They were expelled within a few months afterabout a quarter of their white classmates threatened to withdraw from the schoolif the black men stayed.And Frederick now faced the possibility of capture himself. The authorities haddiscovered a letter from him among Brown’s belongings. It had nothing to do withthe raid, but it was enough to charge Frederick as a coconspirator and issue awarrant for his arrest.Image [../images/f0084-01.jpg]Detail from John Brown, by unidentified photographer (daguerreotype, 1856). Theyear this photograph was taken was the year this New Englander led a massacre ofproslavery men who lived along Pottawatomie Creek in southern Kansas. Ithappened in May 1856, shortly after proslavery forces sacked Lawrence, Kansas,and Preston Brooks attacked Charles Sumner in the Senate.Frederick fled Philadelphia, making his way to Hoboken, New Jersey, where hestayed overnight with a friend. The morning papers had him in a panic. Thegovernment was leaving no stone unturned, as he later wrote, in “ferreting outand bringing to punishment all who were connected with the Harpers Ferryoutrage, and that search would be made for papers as well as persons.”Papers and persons.There were letters from John Brown in his locked desk drawer at home. Also acopy of Brown’s Provisional Constitution. Frederick quickly got a telegram to atrusted friend in Rochester: “Tell Lewis (my oldest son) to secure all theimportant papers in my high desk.” Lewis did as told. As Frederick later wrote,“The mark of the chisel with which the desk was opened is still on the drawer.”Frederick didn’t hide out in Hoboken for long. By a circuitous route he returnedto Rochester, then headed to Canada and finally to England, arriving there onNovember 24. Before he left the States, he drafted a letter to his readers,which ran in the November Douglass’ Monthly. In it, he swore he had neverencouraged John Brown’s raid, never promised to take part in it. He also saidthat he was scheduled to lecture in England long before Harpers Ferry. That wasthe last issue of his paper readers would see until he returned.About a week after Frederick reached England, on December 2, 1859, John Brown,found guilty of conspiracy, treason, and murder, was led to the gallows outsidea jail in Charles Town, Virginia. Said Frederick of his friend years later: “Hiszeal in the cause of my race was far greater than mine—it was as the burning sunto my taper light—mine was bounded by time, his stretched away to the boundlessshores of eternity. I could live for the slave, but he could die for him.”After learning that John Brown would hang, the great-hearted Gerrit Smith, amember of the “Secret Six,” suffered a mental breakdown and wound up in the NewYork State asylum in Utica, New York.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Frederick was in Glasgow, Scotland, when, in late March 1860, word of anothertragedy reached him, this one a thousand times more wrenching than Brown’sexecution and Smith’s breakdown. Frederick’s younger daughter, Annie, avoracious reader and a fine writer, stricken with a brain disease, had died onMarch 13. She had been buried three days later, six days before her eleventhbirthday.Throwing caution to the wind, Frederick caught the first steamer he could. Hereached Rochester in April, then lay low for a few weeks until the chargesagainst him as a John Brown accomplice were dropped.Image [../images/common5.jpg]While Frederick mourned Annie, “the light and life” of his house, he was nodoubt wrestling with the fact that in publishing two papers, he had bitten offmore than he could chew. “We shall speak to you weekly when we can, and monthlywhen we must,” he announced in the August 1860 Douglass’ Monthly, which carriedbelow the masthead a quote from the Old Testament book of Proverbs (mistakenlyattributed to Ecclesiastes in early issues): “Open thy mouth for the dumb, inthe cause of all such as are appointed to destruction; Open thy mouth, judgerighteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.” When he suspendedFrederick Douglass’ Paper, he thought it would be temporary and looked forwardto its making a comeback, but that never happened.In that same issue of Douglass’ Monthly in which he announced the weekly’ssuspension, Frederick, now forty-two, told his readers that he was having a hardtime hoping on, hoping ever. After thirty years of Americanabolition-ism—speeches, articles, rallies, petitions—“The future of theanti-slavery cause is shrouded in doubt and gloom.” Countless men and women haddone their utmost to make people aware of the horrors of slavery. Yet theabomination still existed. The problem wasn’t ignorance, he concluded. Notenough people gave a damn.Yet Frederick couldn’t withdraw from the field. The sacred cause was his life.So in the 1860 presidential election he backed the Republican Party’s candidate,Abraham Lincoln from Illinois. Never a slaveholder, Lincoln thought slaverywrong and vehemently opposed allowing it in the territories. He was, however,not an abolitionist—not advocating the immediate, unconditional end of slaverythroughout the land.Still, how could Frederick not root for Lincoln, given his opponents? NorthernDemocrats ran Illinois’s proslavery senator Stephen Douglas (father of theKansas-Nebraska Act); Southern Democrats backed the sitting vice president(under President James Buchanan), John Breckinridge of Kentucky, a slaveholder;and the newly minted Constitutional Union Party chose John Bell of Tennessee,also a slaveholder.The enemy of Frederick’s enemy was his friend. The slaveholding politicians whoruled the South and who supported Democrats detested Lincoln for his stanceagainst slavery’s expansion. They threatened that the slave states would secedeif he won the presidency. After he did, on November 6, 1860, these“Fire-Eaters,” as they were nicknamed, were in a frenzy.A tantrum to wheedle more compromises out of the North—that’s what Frederickthought when South Carolina seceded on December 20, 1860. He was sickened by theway many white Northerners wrung their hands when other states seceded.Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, all in January 1861, thenTexas on February 1. That was three days before a peace conference inWashington, D.C., in which politicians tried to devise ways to cobble the Unionback together.Frederick was glad the peace conference failed. The time for compromise wasover. There could be no reconciliation between freedom and slavery—no peacebetween proslavery and antislavery people. And if there was not “wisdom andvirtue enough in the land” to end slavery, “then the next best thing is to letthe South go to her own place and be made to drink the wine cup of wrath andfire, which her long career of cruelty, barbarism, and blood shall call downupon her guilty head.”After March 4, 1861—Inauguration Day—Frederick concluded that there was notwisdom and virtue enough in President Lincoln. In his address from the EastPortico of the Capitol, the new president stressed that he had no plans tomeddle with slavery in the states where it already existed. He vowed that hisadministration would uphold the Fugitive Slave Law. He practically begged thebreakaway states calling themselves the Confederate States of America to returnto the fold. There was one comfort for Frederick: He would soon get away fromthis weak-willed nation. A trip to Haiti was on his calendar.Image [../images/f0090-01.jpg]From the January 1861 Douglass’ Monthly. The lead article is about the attack inBoston’s Tremont Temple on Frederick and other abolitionists during acommemoration of the one-year anniversary of John Brown’s execution.Since late 1860 Douglass’ Monthly had carried ads and articles on the HaitianEmigration Bureau, funded by the government of Haiti, the first black republicin the Western Hemisphere. Based in Boston, the bureau was run by Scottishabolitionist and journalist James Redpath, a friend of John Brown’s. Redpath’slieutenants included Henry Highland Garnet and John Brown Jr. (who had notparticipated in his father’s raid).With hope flagging, Frederick no longer blasted every emigration scheme, and hewanted to check out Haiti for himself. He and his daughter, Rosetta, werescheduled to leave in late April 1861 for a ten-week trip, but then came aSouthern storm that stopped him from packing his bags.“This is no time for us to leave the country,” Frederick told his readers."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0092-01.jpg]A carte de visite taken on January 21, 1863, the day Frederick spoke atMichigan’s Hillsdale College. He chose a full-length pose instead of his usualhead-and-shoulders shot. He also opted for a prop: not surprisingly, a book.CHAPTER 6Image [../images/common4.jpg]WE ARE ALL LIBERATEDAs day dawned on Friday, April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union-heldFort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. Shot and shell steadily besieged thefort until its commandant surrendered on the afternoon of April 13. Two dayslater President Lincoln declared the breakaway states to be in rank rebellionand called for 75,000 troops to crush it. Within weeks Virginia, Arkansas,Tennessee, then North Carolina joined the Confederate States of America.With the outbreak of the Civil War, Frederick’s hopes soared.A war to save the Union! That’s what Lincoln and most white Northernersdeclared.Oh, no! said Frederick and other abolitionists, who saw things in biblical,apocalyptic terms. This was a war to end slavery—a great holy war at that, a warthat would climax with a cleansing and redemption of a wayward nation. So therewas no going to Haiti for Frederick. He had to stay and fight. As always, he didso with pen and tongue.Soul on fire once again, Frederick damned Lincoln for making Union soldiersreturn people who escaped slavery to their owners—even when those owners wererebels. He scolded Lincoln for not declaring black captives free and for noturging them to rise up! He lashed out at Lincoln for trying to entice slavestates that didn’t join the Confederacy—the border states of Delaware, Kentucky,Maryland, and Missouri—to consent to compensated gradual emancipation: let theU.S. government pay slaveholders to free people in due time. In his appeals tothe border states the president tried to convince them that most blacks wouldleave the country—something he advocated and another thing Frederick criticizedhim for.Frederick also blasted Lincoln for not allowing black men to join the UnionArmy. “The national edifice is on fire,” he raged in an editorial. “Every manwho can carry a bucket of water or remove a brick is wanted; but those who havethe care of the building, having a profound respect for the feeling of thenational burglars who set the building on fire, are determined that the flamesshall only be extinguished by [white hands]. . . .

He had often called them fiends,pirates, thieves. Now he cast them as even more monstrous, as evil incarnate. Inhis paper Frederick passed on reports of ghoulish goings-on in the Confederatestates: of rebels making candles “from tallow and fat fried from dead Yankees.”In a speech in upstate New York on the Fourth of July, 1862, in declaringslavery and only slavery the cause of the war—“its root and its sap, its trunkand its branches, and the bloody fruit it bears”—he told of Confederates making“drinking vessels” out of Union soldiers’ skulls and sticks for battlefielddrums out of their arm bones. With tales of such atrocities, whether true ornot, Frederick sought to whip up more hatred for rebels in the North and makethe point that without the Union, the rebel states would become even morebarbarous.DEAR SIR: —IN YOUR LAST ISSUE . . .

Frederick once againlectured with William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips, and other abolitionistswho had turned against him—and who now set aside their pacifism. Like them,despite his frustration with Lincoln, Frederick kept his hopes high that theSlave Power would be vanquished.As Frederick employed his pen and tongue perhaps more mightily than ever before,the jubilation came bit by bit.May 24, 1861: At Virginia’s Fort Monroe, Union General Benjamin Butler declaredthree black men who sought sanctuary at his fort “contraband of war”: enemyproperty of military value and so legal to keep. “Our government is taking awiser and more humane course towards those of the slaves who succeed in gettingwithin the lines of our army,” cheered Douglass’ Monthly.August 6, 1861: Lincoln signed the First Confiscation Act. It made Butler’sdecree the law of the land.April 16, 1862: Lincoln signed a bill that abolished slavery in the District ofColumbia. “I trust I am not dreaming,” wrote Frederick to Senator CharlesSumner. Frederick wasn’t pleased with the law’s provision for D.C. slaveholdersto be compensated for their human property (up to $300 per person) but he couldhardly repudiate this act, which could put close to $1 million intoslaveholders’ hands, because it liberated about 3,100 children and adults.July 17, 1862: Lincoln signed two bills that fortified Frederick’s faith in thefederal government. One (the Militia Act) gave Lincoln the power to let blackmen serve in the Union Army as laborers and in any other capacity that madesense to Lincoln. It also said that if any of these men were enslaved, theywould be declared free. The other law (the Second Confiscation Act) said allblack “contraband” would be freed. “At last there is some ground of hope for theslave, and for the country,” remarked Frederick to his readers.Six months later—a thunderbolt. On January 1, 1863, Lincoln issued theEmancipation Proclamation. Blacks enslaved in rebel-held territory were declaredfree. What’s more, black men could now serve as soldiers in the Union Army. Theconfiscation acts had inspired thousands of blacks, especially in the UpperSouth, to bolt to Union lines. The Emancipation Proclamation encouragedthousands more to do the same.“We are all liberated by this proclamation,” said Frederick in early February1863 in the jam-packed great hall of New York City’s Cooper Institute (nowCooper Union). “Everybody is liberated. The white man is liberated, the blackman is liberated.” This was one of many speeches he delivered that month atEmancipation Proclamation celebrations.A VERY LARGE AUDIENCE ASSEMBLED LAST EVENING [FEBRUARY 6, 1863], IN THE GREATHALL OF THE COOPER INSTITUTE TO LISTEN TO PERHAPS THE MOST ELOQUENT BLACK MAN INAMERICA, ON THE GREAT QUESTIONS OF THE DAY AND OF HIS RACE, THE PRESIDENT’SPROCLAMATION OF EMANCIPATION AND THE ARMING OF THE BLACK MAN.—NEW-YORK DAILY TRIBUNENow that black men could officially serve in the Union Army, Frederick leaped atthe chance to be a recruiting agent. In upstate New York, in downstate New York,and elsewhere in the North-east—“Men of color, to arms!” was his battle cry. Inspeech after speech, Frederick called on black men to enlist—to prove themselvesbrave and to liberate their now 4 million brethren in chains. When in New YorkCity, he sometimes worked with Henry Highland Garnet.Image [../images/f0100-01.jpg]From Harper’s Weekly, February 21, 1863: The Effects of the Proclamation—FreedNegroes Coming into Our Lines at Newbern, North Carolina. Depicted here is theday when more than a hundred blacks attached themselves to a Union regiment inNew Bern, North Carolina. “They said that it was known far and wide that thePresident has declared the slaves free,” wrote the soldier who made the drawingon which this engraving is based.Image [../images/f0102-01.jpg]The March 1863 issue of Douglass’ Monthly carried Frederick’s editorial, “Men ofColor, to Arms!” a passionate plea for black men to join the Union Army—“The daydawns—the morning star is bright upon the horizon! The iron gate of our prisonstands half open. One gallant rush from the North will fling it wide open, whilefour millions of our brothers and sisters shall march out into Liberty!” Thetitle of the editorial was the basis for recruiting posters like this one.Frederick didn’t always have the golden touch. Sometimes his soaring oratoryprompted only a few black men (or none) to enlist. Still, Frederick was proud ofhis work. Proud, too, to see his middle son, Frederick Jr., now nineteen, joinhim as a recruiter. Proud to see Lewis and Charley, twenty-one and seventeen,enlist in the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment. They were hisfirst recruits for this regiment, which made a daring but doomed assault on FortWagner, on South Carolina’s Morris Island, in mid-July 1863. Roughly half themen were wounded, captured, or killed. Lewis, a sergeant major, was among thewounded.“The grape and canister, shell and minnies swept us down like chaff,” Lewiswrote his parents two days after the battle, “still our men went on and on, andif we had been properly supported we would have held the Fort, but the whitetroops could not be made to come up.” (A gravely ill Charley had stayed behindwhen the 54th marched off to war. He later became a first sergeant in the 5thMassachusetts Cavalry.)The 54th’s assault on Fort Wagner wasn’t the only instance of black valor,making the Union Army’s racist pay policy all the more infuriating. AndFrederick had egg on his face.When recruiting, he had told black men what he had been told: black soldierswould receive the same pay as white soldiers. The War Department, however, hadreneged on the deal. Whereas a white private was paid thirteen dollars a monthand given free clothing, his black counterpart got ten dollars a month and wasdocked three dollars for his pants, sack coat, forage cap, and socks. Alsogalling: blacks weren’t allowed to rise in the ranks into the officer corps.Image [../images/f0104-01.jpg]Storming Fort Wagner (lithograph, 1890). This print applauds the valor ofFrederick’s son Lewis and other members of the 54th Massachusetts VolunteerInfantry Regiment on July 18, 1863.On August 10, 1863, Frederick went to Washington, D.C., to speak with Lincolnabout all this. By his account (Lincoln left no record of the meeting),Frederick was warmly received in the White House and the president listened inearnest to his grievances.When Frederick left the White House, he did so believing that Lincoln would dosomething about the grievances of black soldiers. Frederick also believed thathe would be the Union Army’s first black officer. That’s because while there hehad also talked with Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Stanton approachedFrederick about serving as assistant adjutant general under General LorenzoThomas, who was recruiting blacks in Union-held territory in Mississippi.What a moment, what a thrill, what a day like no other! The man who as a boyonce had a closet floor for a bed had had an audience with—had been listened toby—the president of the United States—and in the White House! And he was poisedto become the first black officer in the United States Army! The prospect of acommission, in part, prompted Frederick to close shop after sixteen years in thenewspaper business. He bade his readers adieu in the August 1863 Douglass’Monthly. But never fear, he told them, he would not be tossing his pen orholding his tongue.Then Frederick waited.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Not until almost a year later, in June 1864, did the War Department do right byblack soldiers on the issue of pay. As for Frederick’s commission, it nevercame. He could still serve under General Thomas, but not as an officer.Insulted, Frederick said no.The Union wouldn’t have its first black officer until February 1865: Frederick’sold friend and foe, Martin Delany, was made a major. By then the Union hadracked up victory after victory in battles on land and sea. By then GeneralWilliam Tecumseh Sherman had burned Atlanta nearly to the ground, made good onhis promise to make Georgia “howl” with his March to the Sea, then had his60,000-man army wreak havoc in the Carolinas. By the time Delany became a major,the Confederacy was on its last legs, in wreck and ruin. A few months later itwaved the white flag. Between battle deaths, disease, and other causes, the warhad claimed the lives of more than 600,000 souls, military and civilian.Hundreds of thousands sustained serious wounds.On Sunday, April 9, 1865, in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, the Confederacy’snumber one general, Robert E. Lee, surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant, the UnionArmy’s commander in chief. Fighting continued here and there awhile longer, butthe Civil War was over.Image [../images/f0107-01.jpg]Detail from Abraham Lincoln (albumen print, 1863). At Lincoln’s behest,Frederick returned to the White House in the summer of 1864 to discuss an ideaJohn Brown had called the Subterranean Pass Way. This Underground Railroad onsteroids, which wasn’t implemented, would have sent squads of black men South toliberate as many of their people as possible. The third and last time Fredericktalked with President Lincoln was on March 4, 1865, at a White House receptioncelebrating Lincoln’s second inauguration.On April 15 so was Lincoln’s life. The president died of a bullet to the brain,put there by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth the evening before. “Thecalamity was so sudden,” said Frederick in a speech months later, “so out ofjoint with the prevailing sense of security, involved such a transition from oneextreme of feeling to another, from the wildest joy and exultation of victory tothe very dust and ashes of sorrow and mourning, that few could at first believeit.”When Frederick uttered these words in late December 1865, he and other friendsof freedom had celebrated the abolition of slavery in the United States throughthe Thirteenth Amendment, officially added to the Constitution on December 18:“Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crimewhereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the UnitedStates, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.”After a quarter century of service to the sacred cause, what would Frederick,nearing fifty, do now?Image [../images/f0109-01.jpg]The Fall of Richmond, Va. on the Night of April 2d. 1865 (lithograph, 1865).With the imminent arrival of Union troops in defenseless Richmond, theConfederate capital, officials decided to evacuate the city, and some soldierstorched warehouses and other buildings."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0110-01.jpg]A c. 1865 carte de visite. In early 1864 Frederick switched from beard to walrusmustache.CHAPTER 7Image [../images/common4.jpg]A NEW WORLDSlavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot.”That’s what Frederick had declared four weeks after Appomattox, on May 10, 1865,in New York City’s Church of the Puritans. The occasion was the thirty-secondannual meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society, where William LloydGarrison called for the Society’s dissolution. With the abolition of slavery aforegone conclusion, the Society’s work was done, he contended.Frederick had no illusions that in peacetime blacks would suddenly cease to be adespised people. Unless the black man had the vote, Southern states could enactlaws to essentially usher in slavery by another name, make freedom “a delusion,a mockery.”Frederick wasn’t just worried about the fate of blacks in the South. The Northwas still steeped in racism, he reminded folks. A case in point: in Illinois,Indiana, and Ohio, blacks still couldn’t testify in a court of law againstwhites. “Where shall the black man look for . . . support, my friends, if theAmerican Anti-Slavery Society fails him?” With Wendell Phillips as president,the Society fought on for black political and civil rights.Image [../images/common5.jpg]When speaking out for black suffrage, Frederick had a crisp, biting response tothe charge that blacks were not ready for the vote: If the black man “knowsenough to pay taxes to support the government, he knows enough to vote; taxationand representation should go together. If he knows enough to shoulder a musketand fight for the flag, fight for the government, he knows enough to vote.” Mostdefinitely, Frederick’s postwar battle cry was The vote! The national vote! at atime when there was so much stacked against his people.Such as Lincoln’s successor, former vice president Andrew Johnson, a Democrat.Once a slaveholder in his native Tennessee, Johnson was an unabashed whitesupremacist. Shortly after he took the oath of office, he had told a colleague,“This is a country for white men, and by God, as long as I am President, itshall be a government for white men.”To that end, in May 1865 and with Congress not in session, Johnson issued aproclamation of amnesty. To be cleared of the charge of treason, the majority ofrebels merely had to pledge allegiance to the United States. Some, includingthose who owned more than $20,000 in real estate (more than $300,000 today), hadto make a personal appeal to the president for a pardon. (Before long, legionsof “$20,000 men” were pardoned.)In a second proclamation Johnson revealed to Frederick and the world how lenienthe would be when it came to Reconstruction, the process by which ex-Confederatestates were readmitted to the Union. He started with North Carolina. Afterappointing Democrat William Holden its provisional governor, Johnson had himhold a state convention to create a new state constitution that repealed theordinance of secession and ratified the Thirteenth Amendment. Only white mencould vote for convention delegates.By fall 1865, with the exception of Texas (which wouldn’t ratify the ThirteenthAmendment until 1870), every former rebel state was back in the Union. Worse,former Confederate states had instituted—or were poised to institute—“BlackCodes”: laws to subjugate blacks just as before. There were pass systems andcurfews. There were bans against blacks earning livelihoods as blacksmiths andother artisans. If authorities deemed black parents too poor to raise theirkids, they could force the children into apprenticeships (up to the age oftwenty-one for boys and eighteen for girls). Vicious, too, was the convict leasesystem, through which blacks jailed, often on trumped-up charges, could berented out to work on plantations and other white enterprises.Just as Frederick feared.Slavery by another name.The vote! The national vote!For most black Southerners the only help close at hand was the Bureau ofRefugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands. This social service agency, headed byUnion General Oliver O. Howard, was known as the Freedmen’s Bureau because mostof its clients had been enslaved. These people looked to the bureau for shelter,food, clothing, medical care, jobs—protection.The vote! The national vote!Image [../images/f0115-01.jpg]A c. 1863 ambrotype. Frederick especially had in mind men like the one seen herewhen he agitated for black male suffrage. This unidentified Union soldier poseswith his wife and daughters (in matching hats and coats).Even when a speech wasn’t explicitly about suffrage, Frederick often brought upthe issue. He did this in Baltimore in the fall of 1865, at the dedication of aninstitution devoted to black educational, social, and cultural uplift and namedin his honor: the Douglass Institute. It was located in a building onBaltimore’s East Lexington Street once occupied by Newton University, a buildinga group of blacks had purchased for $16,000. As “dismal as is the hour, troubledand convulsed as the times, we may congratulate ourselves upon the establishmentof this institution,” said Frederick on dedication day. The Institute came atthe right time, a time when the issue of suffrage was being hotly debated. Itwas just the thing to counter allegations of black inferiority and “incapacity.”And Frederick was hopeful that the white people of the North would do the rightthing—if not out of sheer decency then out of self-preservation: to keep the OldSouth from roaring back. “They gave us the bullet to save themselves; they willyet give the ballot to save themselves.” This was just a few weeks beforeConnecticut voters rejected a proposal to add black suffrage to their state’sconstitution. Fortunately for Frederick and like-minded folk, there were whitesin high places champing at the bit to make serious changes. Enter the RadicalRepublicans.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Because so many Democrats in Congress had joined the Confederacy, the Republicanparty controlled Congress during and after the war. Within that party there wasa dynamic and resolute group known as the Radicals: abolitionists intent onempowering black people and punishing the states that had rebelled. Outragedover what Johnson had done, when Congress came back into session in December1865, Senator Charles Sumner, Pennsylvania representative Thaddeus Stevens, andother Radicals were determined to wrest Reconstruction out of his hands. Forstarters, they saw to it that Congress refused to seat senators andrepresentatives from states readmitted under Johnson’s plan. These states werebasically kicked out of the Union.While Radicals worked on new, progressive legislation, Frederick kept on withhis battle cry. In early February 1866 he headed a delegation of black men whosecured a meeting with President Johnson, with everyone’s remarks made availableto the press.This delegation included Frederick’s son Lewis; John Jones of Chicago; WilliamWhipper, a successful entrepreneur from Pennsylvania; and George T. Downing,proprietor of a hotel and catering business in Newport, Rhode Island, andmanager of the House of Representatives dining room. The group’s goal wastwofold: to protest the virtually nonexistent enforcement of the ThirteenthAmendment, and to urge the president to support black suffrage. “You enfranchiseyour enemies and dis-franchise your friends,” said Frederick to Johnson, tryingto get him to see that as things stood, most black Southerners lived at themercy of whites just as in slavery. His lead argument, however, was this: Ifblack men could be taxed and drafted, and have other obligations to thegovernment, how then could they be deprived of the vote? Nothing Frederick oranyone else said moved Johnson, who blathered on about how giving the black manthe ballot would lead to a race war. He also suggested that perhaps blacksshould just leave the country. After the delegation left, the president railedagainst and cursed Frederick and the other black men to his private secretary.IT WOULD BE HARD TO SURPASS THE BRIEF ADDRESS OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS FOR FITNESSTO THE OCCASION AND POINT. IT WOULD BE HARD TO FIND A WORSE SPEECH THAN THEDIFFUSE, ILLOGICAL, CLUMSY, AND COARSE REPLY OF THE PRESIDENT.”—NATIONAL ANTISLAVERY STANDARDThe widely publicized meeting between the dignified delegation and the vulgarpresident generated support for Frederick’s new sacred cause in the halls ofCongress and on the street. Radical Republicans were ready to take more action.April 9, 1866: Over John-son’s veto, Congress passed a civil rights bill tocounter the Black Codes—all people born in the United States, except for NativeAmericans living on reservations, were now citizens of the United States andentitled to federal protection of their lives and property.PRESIDENT JOHNSON’S WELL-KNOWN COURTESY AND SELF-POSSESSION WERE PUT TO THE TESTTODAY BY THE VISITATION OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS AT THE HEAD OF THE GREAT COLOREDDELEGATION FROM THE NORTHERN CITIES. . . .

As well, the Fourteenth Amendment made a state’srepresentation in Congress contingent on the number of male voters agetwenty-one and older. If a state denied black men the vote, it would have fewerrepresentatives (and in several Southern states blacks outnumbered whites). Thisamendment, like all others, then had to be ratified by three-quarters of thestates.January 8, 1867: Congress granted D.C.’s male residents, twenty-one years orolder, the right to vote. (Exceptions included paupers and men with convictionsfor serious crimes.)March 2, 1867: Over Johnson’s veto Congress passed the First Reconstruction Act.The ex-rebel states were reduced to conquered territory and put under militaryrule. Ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment was now a condition ofreadmission into the Union. (The exception was Tennessee. Back in July 1866 ithad ratified this amendment and so was back in the Union.)Image [../images/common5.jpg]During these days of sweeping changes, The vote! The national vote! remainedFrederick’s battle cry.When in July 1868 the Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution—The vote! The national vote!As some Northern states granted black men the vote without propertyqualifications and others denied it—The vote! The national vote!Finally on February 26, 1869, Congress passed the Fifteenth Amendment: U.S.citizens could not be denied the state or federal vote “on account of race,color, or previous condition of servitude” (but not gender).Yes! Yes!Image [../images/common5.jpg]For his support of the Fifteenth Amendment Frederick faced the fury of somefeminists, more than a few of them friends. When urged to stand instead foruniversal suffrage—the national vote for men and women—I can’t! I can’t!Frederick still supported women’s suffrage. But he was a realist. Universalsuffrage didn’t have a chance at the time. He also maintained that it was moreimperative for black men to have the vote—that racism was a worse scourge andmore deadly than sexism.Frederick explained himself most passionately in May 1869 in New York City, atthe first annual meeting of the American Equal Rights Association (AERA): “Withus, the [suffrage] matter is a question of life and death, at least in fifteenStates of the Union. When women, because they are women, are hunted down throughthe cities of New York and New Orleans; when they are dragged from their housesand hung upon lamp-posts; when their children are torn from their arms, andtheir brains dashed upon the pavement; when they are objects of insult andoutrage at every turn; when they are in danger of having their homes burnt downover their heads; when their children are not allowed to enter schools; thenthey will have an urgency to obtain the ballot equal to our own.”THINK OF PATRICK AND SAMBO AND HANS AND YUNG TUNG WHO DO NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN A MONARCHY AND A REPUBLIC, WHO NEVER READ THE DECLARATION OFINDEPENDENCE OR WEBSTER’S SPELLING BOOK, MAKING LAWS FOR LYDIA MARIA CHILD,LUCRETIA MOTT, OR FANNY KEMBLE.—ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, disgusted over the possibility of immigrant and blackmen getting the national vote before educated, accomplished white womenWhen an audience member asked didn’t these horrible things happen to blackwomen, too—“Yes, yes, yes; it is true of the black woman, but not because she is a woman,but because she is black.”Image [../images/f0123-01.jpg]Representative Women (lithograph c. 1870). These seven white reformers are(clockwise from top): Lucretia Mott, AERA’s first president; Elizabeth CadyStanton; Mary Ashton Rice Livermore, who helped form the Civil War–eraequivalent of the Red Cross; Lydia Maria Child, writer and editor; Susan B.Anthony; and Sara Jane Clarke Lippincott, better known by her pen name, GraceGreenwood, the New York Times’ first woman journalist. Center: famed orator AnnaElizabeth Dickinson.In his AERA address Frederick wasn’t being overdramatic. Violence against blacksand their white allies was epidemic, especially in the former Confederatestates—even with federal troops stationed down there. White supremacist outfitssuch as the Ku Klux Klan killed and maimed, burned down homes and schools. Backin May 1866 it was mostly black blood that flowed in Memphis, Tennessee, duringa three-day white riot against blacks in and out of uniform. Over 40 dead. Twomonths after the Memphis Riot about the same number of blacks died in the NewOrleans Riot. And that was not the end of the troubles in Louisiana. Eightmonths before Frederick spoke at the AERA convention, in September 1868, therewas the Opelousas Massacre, which some sources say ended the lives of about 150blacks while others put the death toll at about 300.After the war, the Freedmen’s Bureau’s files bulged with reports ofwhite-on-black indiscriminate savagery: People were beaten, bludgeoned,beheaded. In one case a black man was attacked because he was too ill to work.Another was shot dead because he failed to tip his hat when passing by a whiteman.The North was no stranger to such barbarism. One of the nation’s worst riotsever had occurred during the summer of 1863 in New York City, when a whiteprotest against the draft turned violent. After four days of madness and mayhemin the New York City Draft Riots, with blacks the number one targets, more than100 people were dead and some 2,000 injured.Image [../images/common5.jpg]When Frederick, by now fifty-one, spoke at the AERA convention in May 1869,thirteen states had ratified the Fifteenth Amendment. Another fifteen wereneeded to meet the three-fourths requirement for an amendment to be added to theConstitution.The wait lasted through the summer and fall and into the winter of 1870. Itended on March 30, 1870, the day the Fifteenth Amendment was adopted into theConstitution! “Henceforth we live in a new world,” declared Frederick a monthlater at a celebration of the amendment in Albany’s Tweddle Hall, filled tocapacity. “At last, at last, the black man has a future.”By then ten of the eleven former Confederate states were back in the Union.Georgia, the exception, would be, too, that summer.And in this new world, Frederick had a new newspaper."},{"pageContent":"Image [../images/f0126-01.jpg]Carte de visite, c. 1871: Frederick was especially fond of the profile pose.CHAPTER 8Image [../images/common4.jpg]PROMISES IN YOUR CONSTITUTIONIn late summer 1870 Frederick took over an eight-month-old strugglingblack-owned D.C. weekly, the New Era. Renaming it the New National Era, hegeared up to spend a lot of time in the capital, about three hundred miles awayfrom Rochester. And wife Anna.The New National Era, at 418 11th Street NW, reported on the ongoingFranco-Prussian war, the national debt, and a debate over polygamy in Utah,among other things in its first issue, September 8, 1870. It also carriedupdates on public figures. Richard T. Greener, the first black Harvard graduate(1870) and in his twenties, was still on his sickbed in Boston. Gerrit Smith, inhis seventies and long since out of that insane asylum, was using his “wellpreserved mental and moral faculties” in the temperance movement. The paperinvited Martin Delany to drop a line.In the New National Era, as in his speeches, Frederick urged hard work andthrift, rallying blacks to amass money, to spend not on excessive finery andfrivolity but on homes, businesses, and income-producing investments. He calledon his people to do as he had done. And most definitely he had come a very longway.In slavery, Frederick’s captors made money off him and during those early daysof freedom his wages were meager—that is, until he embarked on a career as alecturer, earning on average $450 a year for about a hundred engagements in the1840s. By the late 1850s he typically charged $25 per speech. In the 1870s thatfee generally ranged from $75 to $125, and Frederick earned thousands of dollarsa year—sometimes one thousand in less than a month, as happened in earlyDecember 1872. For ten talks in upstate New York, western Pennsylvania, Ohio,Wisconsin, and Illinois, before the ten percent commission to his agent andlongtime friend James Redpath, Frederick earned $1,000 (nearly $20,000 today).Over the years Frederick had also invested in real estate as well as in stocksand bonds.Image [../images/f0128-01.jpg]Smithsonian Institution Building from Pennsylvania Ave, 1874 (photographicprint, 1874). The view is toward the south from the corner of Pennsylvania and11th Street.

The tall building on the left is Harvey’s, one of the city’s mostfamous restaurants. Frederick’s New National Era, at 418 11th Street, NW, isbehind Harvey’s. In the distance looms the Smithsonian “castle.”Given how well Frederick did for himself, it’s no wonder that one of hisfavorite and most popular speeches was “Self-Made Men,” a salute to people whobegan life with nothing and made something of themselves through—notconnections, not luck—but hard work when given half a chance. Self-improvementand amassing wealth were not an end but a means. Self-made men (and women) wereduty bound, he believed, to use their abilities and resources to improve theirworlds.It must have saddened Frederick that his own children, none of whom went tocollege, weren’t more successful. After the war Lewis and Frederick Jr. hadpursued various endeavors in Denver, Colorado, then in the nation’s capital, butwere stymied. One way Frederick came to their aid was by turning the NewNational Era over to them in 1873. By then both were married. While Lewis wasnot to have any children, Frederick Jr. would have seven and often ask hisfather for financial help.Image [../images/f0131-01.jpg]From the first issue of Frederick’s fourth newspaper.Charley, also a husband and father, had several government jobs, including as aclerk for the Freedmen’s Bureau and for the Treasury Department. But he, wholike his mother was rather sickly, often turned to his father when in debt.As for “the pulse” of Frederick’s heart, during the war Rosetta had marriedNathan Sprague, a member of the 54th Massachusetts, who had been born intoslavery. After the war Rosetta’s husband tried his hand at farming, at hackdriving, at this, at that. Nothing worked out for him. Frederick came to theirrescue, too. Sometimes with money. Sometimes by letting them and their childrenlive in his home.Image [../images/f0133-01.jpg]1 Frederick and Anna’s youngest son, Charles Remond (carte de visite, dateunknown).

After everyone wassafely out of the house, they tried, with the help of neighbors, to get as manyof their belongings as they could out onto the lawn.When Frederick arrived from Washington the next day, he faced utter devastation.The house, the barn and other outbuildings, coaches, buggies, everything but thehorses Rosetta’s husband managed to save—destroyed. “Scarcely a trace of thebuilding, except brick walls and stone foundations, is left,” Frederick informedNew National Era readers of his home. In a piece for a Rochester paper, hemourned the trees he had planted some twenty years earlier, “scorched andcharred beyond recovery.”A piano worth $500 was among the items saved but “much damaged.” Frederickcalculated that even after insurance he lost $4,000 to $5,000 (about $100,000today). Complete sets of his first three newspapers were among the pricelesslosses. When Frederick learned that firefighters suspected arson, he was livid,even more wounded—and soon done with Rochester, his home for twenty-five years.Frederick moved his family to Washington, D.C. Home was now a town house onCapitol Hill, at 316 A Street NE, a home he expanded in the fall of 1873 bybuying the adjoining house and breaking down the wall that divided theproperties.About two years after he settled in the capital, where he bought a gold watch atMermod and Jacquard Jewelry Company and clothing at Wm. S. Teel’s men’s shop,had shirts made at Philip T. Hall’s, and got gaiters at J. J. Georges’ shoeshop, Frederick was tapped to be president of the Freedman’s Savings and TrustCompany, better known as Freedman’s Bank, which Congress had created back inMarch 1865. Initially intended to help black servicemen rise in life, this bank,run by white men, attracted the pennies, nickels, dimes, and dollars of an arrayof black people. When Frederick, one of the bank’s boosters, became itspresident in March 1874, the bank had more than thirty branches in about a dozenstates and the District of Columbia. Frederick’s job came with a fancy office ina new four-story stone building on Pennsylvania Avenue, across the street fromthe White House. But all that glitters . . .Image [../images/f0135-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass in Front of His A Street NE Home (albumen print, 1878). Tothe right is Frederick in top hat and suit; on the far right is Rosetta and oneof her daughters.At the start, the Freedman’s Bank was limited to making safe and secureinvestments with depositors’ money. But in time the men who oversaw it beganmaking riskier investments to earn a higher rate of interest. Those investmentsincluded stock in railroad companies, many of which went belly up, triggering aneconomic downturn that started in September 1873. In the Panic of 1873, thefirst worldwide economic depression, thousands of businesses failed—includingscores of banks, because of investment losses and because of people rushing towithdraw their money.Why did Frederick, who knew nothing about banking, take the job—six months afterthe depression began? Did he believe his prestige would inspire great confidencein the bank? How much did he know about the bank’s state of affairs before hesaid yes?Image [../images/f0137-01.jpg]The Department of Justice (Freedman’s Bank Building) by unidentifiedphotographer, a photographic copy of a c. 1880 wood engraving.In late June 1874, the New National Era carried his letter to the bank’scustomers (of which he was one). The bad news: at the start of the year, thebank’s debts exceeded its assets by more than $200,000 (over $4 million today).The good news: the bank had sworn off risky investments and put a freeze onopening new branches. Cost-cutting measures included reducing some salaries. Thebank would not only survive, it would “flourish.” Frederick either wasdelusional or had been duped. On July 2 the bank shut its doors. Some 61,000people, with deposits ranging on average from five dollars to fifty, lost atotal of nearly $3.3 million. In years to come about half of those people wouldrecoup some money but not the full amount: about $540,000 as a group. Because ofwhat happened to the Freedman’s Bank, for years many blacks lived with a deepdistrust of banks, preferring to keep their money tucked under a mattress orinside a tin can or cigar box stashed in a hideaway.Three months after the Freedman’s Bank closed, the New National Era wasshuttered. Despite Frederick’s periodic cash infusions, his sons hadn’t beenable to make the paper profitable.After the Freedman’s Bank and the New National Era failed, Frederick didn’tretreat from public life. On he surged, still a much sought-after speaker. Andthere was plenty to rail against.Southern barbarism was still rampant despite enforcement acts President UlyssesS. Grant, a Republican, signed into law in the early 1870s. Known as the Ku KluxKlan Acts, they made it a federal crime to interfere with a person’s rights,especially the right to vote. Still, white violence against blacks—to keep themfrom exercising their rights, to keep them from pursuing dreams and aspirations,to keep them from living normal lives—continued with a vengeance. In Louisianathere was the Colfax Massacre on Easter Sunday, April 13, 1873, and theCoushatta Massacre on August 25, 1874. Months later, on December 7, inMississippi there was the Vicksburg Massacre.One ray of light came on March 1, 1875. President Grant signed off on a civilrights bill Senator Charles Sumner had introduced years earlier. This law madeit a crime for hotels, theaters, and other places of public accommodations todiscriminate against people because of their race, color, or previous conditionof servitude. Those who violated the Civil Rights Act of 1875 could be finedbetween $500 and $1,000 or jailed for thirty days.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Just as Frederick had stumped for Lincoln in 1860 and 1864, and for Grant in1868 and 1872, so, too, did he stump for the Republican Party’s presidentialcandidate, Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, in the year of the nation’scentennial. Hayes’ opponent was the Democrat Samuel Tilden, governor of NewYork.At the Republican National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, in June 1876,Frederick held the party’s feet to the fire in his address in Exposition Hall.“You say you have emancipated us. You have; and I thank you for it. You say youhave enfranchised us. You have; and I thank you for it. But what is youremancipation?—what is your enfranchisement? What does it all amount to, if theblack man, after having been made free by the letter of your law, is unable toexercise that freedom, and, after having been freed from the slaveholder’s lash,he is to be subject to the slaveholder’s shot-gun?” Despite the laws enactedduring Reconstruction, blacks were still orphans of the storm. “Do you mean tomake good to us the promises in your constitution?” Frederick thundered.Image [../images/f0141-01.jpg]From Frank Leslie’s Illustrated News, July 1, 1876: Ohio—The Republican NationalConvention at Cincinnati, June 14th, 15th and 16th (engraving). The conventionwas held in Exposition Hall.While millions of blacks saw no change for the better in their lives, Frederickreceived a prestigious post. About two weeks after Rutherford B. Hayes’inauguration in March 1877, the president appointed Frederick U.S. Marshal ofthe District of Columbia with oversight of the arrest of thieves and otherlawbreakers. A first for a black person.THERE IS NO MAN LIVING THAT I SHOULD SO REJOICE TO SEE HOLD THIS POSITION AT THECAPITAL OF THE NATION AS YOURSELF.—HARRIET JACOBS, writer, activist, and former resident of Rochester, at thattime residing in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

He was keeping hispart of the bargain made in the contested election of 1876 that included chargesof ballot box stuffing in parts of the South. Hayes became the president afterpolitical operatives made a backroom deal: in exchange for the presidency he’dremove troops from the South and end federal intervention there. He’d endReconstruction.Image [../images/f0143-01.jpg]The First Colored Senator and Representatives—in the 41st and 42nd Congress ofthe United States (lithograph, 1872).

Howcould blacks hold on to their rights now? During Reconstruction some six hundredblack men had served in state legislatures. Fifteen had served in Congress.After the Compromise of 1877 the nation would not see numbers like that againfor decades.Some people thought Frederick should resign as marshal given what Hayes did andalso because he was stripped of a traditional duty of a D.C. marshal:introducing dignitaries to the president in the White House. Despite thebetrayal (and the snub), Frederick remained loyal to the Republican Party andcampaigned for its next presidential candidate, James Garfield, another Ohioanwho defeated Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock, a Pennsylvanian, in the 1880election.WE BELIEVE THAT THE CRAZE FOR [HOLDING] OFFICE IS OUR BANE.

GREENER WILL KEEP HIS HEAD LEVEL AND HIMSELF FREE FROMENTANGLEMENTS.—D.C.’s black-owned weekly PEOPLE’S ADVOCATE on rumors that Richard T. Greener,dean of Howard University’s law school, was to be a member of PresidentGarfield’s cabinetPresident Garfield didn’t reappoint Frederick as D.C. marshal but gave him theless prestigious post of recorder of deeds: keeper of the district’s realestate–related records and documents. Like other officeholders, Frederick wasn’tabove nepotism, handing out jobs to relatives and friends. Daughter Rosetta andsons Lewis and Frederick Jr. were among his clerks at one point. So wasRosetta’s husband, after serving a year in prison for mail tampering while hewas a postal worker in Rochester. Another hire was Helen Pitts, daughter of thewhite couple Gideon and Jane Pitts of Honeoye, New York, Frederick’s formerfellow conductors on the Underground Railroad. Helen, a graduate of today’sMount Holyoke College, had moved to D.C. in 1880. Early on she stayed with anuncle, one of Frederick’s neighbors.By then Frederick no longer lived on Capitol Hill but across the Anacostia Riverin the suburb of Uniontown (renamed Anacostia in 1886). Frederick’s new home,high up on a hill, was a fifteen-acre estate with gardens and a croquet courtamong other splendors. Its white-frame Southern Gothic mansion would eventuallyhave twenty-one rooms. The view of the capital from Frederick’s place, which henamed Cedar Hill, was magnificent.It was almost always open house at Cedar Hill. A lot of people lived there, too,in the late 1870s: Rosetta and her five girls and one son (with her husband offin Omaha trying to make a go of another business, a bakery); Charley, now awidower, and his several children; and someone with whom Frederick had reunitedafter the war, his brother, Perry, who had taken the last name Downs.Image [../images/f0146-01.jpg]Snow at Cedar Hill in 1887 (unknown type of photograph). The young man (farright) might be one of Frederick’s grandchildren. This photograph was taken byhis son Charley on February 27, 1887.When Frederick lived in Rochester, he had built a small cottage on his landwhere Perry and his family lived for two years before moving back to Maryland.Years later, when Perry, five years older than Frederick, came to Cedar Hillwith a daughter, he was dying. “I am glad to have a shelter for him,” Frederickwrote a friend in April 1879. Perry died in 1880, sometime after June when thecensus showed him living with Frederick, as were several granddaughters, anephew, Nathan Sprague’s sister, Louisa, Frederick’s sister Kitty, and aservant.Perhaps the most frequent visitor to Cedar Hill was Ottilie Assing, a journalistfor a German newspaper who had translated My Bondage and My Freedom into German.Some historians maintain that this woman, who stayed at Cedar Hill for weeks ata time, was Frederick’s mistress for more than twenty years. Others contend thatthe affair was a figment of this mentally unstable woman’s imagination.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Of all the rooms in Cedar Hill, undoubtedly Frederick’s favorite was hisstudy/library adorned with images of luminaries and other accoutrements ofVictorian bourgeois culture and, of course, with books, books, books!—fromtravel books and histories to grammar books and collections of sermons andspeeches.When it came to current events, Frederick had subscriptions to a mix of black-and white-owned periodicals, from D.C.’s Evening Star, the Washington Post, andthe Christian Recorder to New York City’s Freeman, the Woman’s Journal out ofBoston, and Anti-Caste, a journal promoting brotherhood published in Somerset,England. Not surprisingly, Frederick was quite the joiner, with memberships inorganizations as different as the Republican National League, the National WomanSuffrage Association, and the American Peace Society. He was a giver, too.Virginia’s Manassas Industrial School for Colored Youth and the Washington FreeKindergarten were among the charities he supported over the years while livingat Cedar Hill.Image [../images/f0148-01.jpg]Detail from Anna M. Douglass (painting, 1922, based on a photograph). Born about1813, Anna was the daughter of Mary and Bambarra Murray, who were freed fromslavery shortly before she was born on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, in Denton. Annamoved seventy miles to Baltimore as a young woman and supported herself as ahousekeeper and laundress.During his days at Cedar Hill, Frederick worked on his third autobiography,bringing his life up-to-date with the nearly six-hundred-page Life and Times ofFrederick Douglass, published in the fall of 1881, when he was sixty-three.Less than a year later tragedy struck at Cedar Hill. Anna suffered a severestroke that paralyzed her left side. A few weeks later, on Wednesday, August 4,1882, Frederick’s wife of forty-four years died. According to her deathcertificate she was sixty-nine years old.After the death of his demure, dutiful, apparently never demanding wife,Frederick was adrift. Maybe move to Europe? Maybe . . . He faced hard daysahead. Hard physically, emotionally, mentally. Shortly before the one-yearanniversary of Anna’s death, he was in such a bad way that friends hustled himoff for a rest in Poland Springs, a resort town in Maine. When Frederickreturned, he was rejuvenated. And he wasn’t a widower for much longer.She was his employee. She was twenty years younger. And she was white. Jawsdropped when word spread that on the evening of Thursday, January 24, 1884,Frederick married one of his clerks, Helen Pitts. They were married in a privateceremony in the home of the Reverend Francis J. Grimké, pastor of one of thecity’s most prominent black churches, Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church. Theminister’s wife, Charlotte Forten Grimké, and two people in their home were theonly witnesses. Frederick’s children learned of the impending marriage onlyhours before.For remarrying—and to a white woman—Frederick faced their rage. And that ofother blacks, too.FRED DOUGLASS . . .

He recalled the attacks heaped upon him for marrying Helen, especiallyfrom blacks who made him out to be “a traitor to my race, as if I belonged toone race more than to another. . . . Happily their hard words did not kill me.”Image [../images/f0153-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass at His Desk in Haiti (albumen print, c. 1890). Frederick isnot asleep but engrossed in a book in the room that served as his office whilehe lived in Villa Tivoli in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Helen recalled that duringtheir time in Haiti, many nights Frederick got out of bed to “stand beneath theopen sky & commune with the stars.”During those seven years Frederick’s children never warmed to Helen—they calledher “Mrs. Douglass”—but they, especially Rosetta, couldn’t stop loving theirfather.As for the controversial couple, several months after they married, they went ona honeymoon, visiting more than a dozen cities in the Midwest, upstate New York,and New England. They went to the Thousand Islands of the St. Lawrence River andMontreal, too. Less than two years later, in 1886, and with Frederick no longerD.C.’s recorder of deeds, the couple took an even bigger trip, which Frederickcould well afford. Not counting Cedar Hill, his assets were valued at $85,000(about $2.2 million today).Image [../images/common5.jpg]At two oclk, or there about, the mountain coasts of dear old Ireland . . . cameinto view,” Frederick scribbled in his diary on Wednesday, September 22, 1886. Afew hours later the steamer City of Rome docked at Queen-stown Harbor, where heand Helen boarded a boat that took them across the Irish Sea to Liverpool. Theirgrand tour began!“Oct. 1st: We have now spent a week in Liverpool, have visited the artgalleries, the Free Library . . .”“Arrived in Paris Wednesday 20th October 1886 and rode to the Hotel Britanique .. .”“Jan 13: Arrived in Marseilles last night too dark to get a view of the bluewaters of the Mediteranian [sic].”“Jan 15th: Took train for Nice . . . Spent but one day here and pushed onthrough Mentone and several other interesting towns to Genova.”“Jan. 18th: Came to the old town of Pisa, saw the Leaning Tower.”January 19, 1887, was one of the grandest days—they arrived in Rome, the EternalCity. Frederick was speechless as he stood beneath the dome of St. Peter’sBasilica.Naples was next. Then nearby Pompeii, buried by nearly ten feet of ash andpumice when Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 CE.On Tuesday, February 8, the couple headed to the coastal town of Amalfi.Frederick declared the winding road “an ingeneering triumph.” He noted that“little and large vessels dot the whole coast with their white sails.” Unlikewhen he was a boy standing on the banks of Chesapeake Bay, the sight of thesesails didn’t bring him to tears, but was a “constant delight to the eye.”Image [../images/common5.jpg]During their travels, Frederick and Helen stayed in fine hotels and dined ingreat restaurants. They visited old friends of his, such as Julia GriffithsCrofts, now a widow, when in England. When in Rome Charles Remond’s threesisters, one of whom had a medical practice there. Frederick and Helen alsovisited friends of friends and made new friends. And they stayed on the go.Except on rainy days. Those were prime times for Frederick to write letters tofamily, who wouldn’t see him again for some time.“We decided to day to extend our visit to Egypt and Greece,” Frederick wrote inhis diary on February 11, 1887. “It is no small thing to see the land of Josephand his brethren and from which Moses led the children of Abraham out of thehouse of Bondage.”Bondage. That was how he began in life. Given that, he mused, what a strange andwonderful thing “that I should be plowing this classic sea and on my way to theland of Moses and the Pharaohs.” This was on the night of February 14, hisadopted birthday, chosen because his mother had called him her little valentine.“Aside from a cold and a little hint of sea sickness, I am quite well, strong,and cheerful,” he wrote.And plow on he did.MR. FREDERICK DOUGLASS HAS JUST RETURNED TO LONDON AFTER NINE MONTHS OF TRAVELON THE CONTINENT AND IN EGYPT. HE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN IN ENGLAND SEVERAL MONTHSBEFORE RETURNING HOME. . . . “IT WAS HERE,” SAID MR. DOUGLASS, “THAT FORTY-ONEYEARS AGO I RECEIVED THE BILL OF SALE OF MY OWN BODY. . . . THE MONEY WAS[RAISED] BY TWO SISTERS, ELLEN AND ANNA RICHARDSON, LIVING AT NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE.. . . ONE IS 79 AND THE OTHER OVER 80 YEARS OLD.” MR. DOUGLASS INTENDS TO VISITTHESE LADIES IN A FEW DAYS.—KANSAS CITY STARIn Egypt he visited mosques and tombs. He made the more than four-hundred-footclimb—at age sixty-nine!—up the Great Pyramid of Giza. He and Helen also enjoyeda five-day sail up Africa’s legendary Nile River. In Alexandria, Frederickmarveled at the site where the world’s largest library once stood.The Acropolis and the Parthenon were among the sights they drank in when thecouple reached Athens, Greece. After a few days there, they headed back toItaly, back to France, then on to England, arriving there in late spring 1887.Helen had to cut her trip short. Her mother was very ill. Frederick was acutelyaware that Helen’s father wouldn’t let him set foot into his house—that’s howmuch this abolitionist loathed the fact that his daughter had married a blackman—and so Frederick remained in England giving lectures, visiting friends, andfrequenting museums, art galleries, and the like. Before the summer was out,both he and Helen were back at Cedar Hill.Image [../images/common5.jpg]During those seven years of his second marriage, Frederick continued to be aforce. Continued to lecture. Continued to write. Continued to try to get peopleto see that humanity is one the world over. Continued to be the de factopresident of black America.Frederick also continued to lament the ground the nation had lost in theaftermath of Reconstruction. In the 1880s that loss included the Civil RightsAct of 1875: In October 1883, the U.S. Supreme Court declared itunconstitutional because only state and local governments—not Congress—couldlegislate against a park or hotel having discriminatory practices. The highcourt’s decision put the country on a course for entrenched segregation.“It has swept over the land like a moral cyclone, leaving moral desolation inits track,” said Frederick at a meeting in D.C.’s Lincoln Hall a week after theruling. “We feel it, as we felt the furious attempt, years ago, to force theaccursed system of slavery upon the soil of Kansas, the enactment of theFugitive Slave Bill, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, the Dred Scottdecision. I look upon it as one more shocking development of that moral weaknessin high places which has attended the conflict between the spirit of liberty andthe spirit of slavery from the beginning, and I venture to predict that it willbe so regarded by after-coming generations.”Six years later seventy-one-year-old Frederick vowed to keep fighting the goodfight at his surprise birthday party hosted by Washington’s Bethel LiterarySociety. “With the help of God,” he told the crowd, “while life shall endure,you shall find me faithful in the support of every movement and measure lookingto the enlightenment and improvement of our yet much oppressed, abused, andslandered people.”A year and a half later the man called the Sage of Anacostia, or the Lion ofAnacostia, found himself about to embark on a very different mission. In June1889 President Benjamin Harrison appointed Frederick minister resident andconsul general of Haiti. This time there was no Southern storm to keep him fromgoing to Haiti (though he did have to wait for some civil unrest there to diedown before he made the journey). That’s why his “Dear Rose,” as he called hisdaughter, received a letter from him on January 23, 1891, from the Haitiancapital, Port-au-Prince, where Frederick and Helen lived in a villa namedTivoli.In Haiti, Frederick’s main mission was to convince its dictator, General LouisMondestin Florvil Hyppolite, to allow the U.S. Navy to have a base in Haiti’sport town of Môle Saint-Nicolas.Image [../images/common5.jpg]Frederick was glad to be in Haiti, but the going was tough. He suffered from theheat at times. In that letter to Rosetta he said it was brutal. Still, he hadridden ten miles on horseback the previous day.He was also having a difficult time with French. “I am making progress but I amyet far behind and almost despair.” Almost being the operative word. He wasdetermined to keep at it. “My motto is toil and trust.”At age seventy-two, Frederick couldn’t toil as hard as he once had. There wastrouble with his eyesight along with his energy. And worries: several friendsand family members were ill, including Rosetta’s oldest, Hattie. Then inFebruary Helen came down with rheumatic fever and wasn’t out of danger untillate March. But toil on he did as best he could.“Still I keep on my legs and at work with my brain and pen as usual,” he wrotegranddaughter Fredericka in February 1891. One of his projects was puttingtogether a collection of his speeches, so that, “when I shall fall like a fadedleaf from a living tree, somebody will once in a while study my words andworks.”He also told Fredericka that he had recently heard from her cousin Joe and howhappy he was to know that the young man was still working hard on his violinskills. “I almost ache to hear you say that you find time to do the same. Youhave talent and have ability.” That said, he didn’t want his granddaughter toneglect her studies. A young black woman would have enough to “contend with inthe battle of life without having her hands tied as mine have been by a want ofeducation.” Twenty-year-old Fredericka (Rosetta’s fifth born) was attending theMechanics Institute in Rochester, New York. Her nineteen-year-old cousin Joe(Charley’s second born) was on his way to being hailed a “genius on the violin.”Image [../images/f0161-01.jpg]Page one of Frederick’s February 1891 letter to granddaughter Fredericka.Four months after that letter to Fredericka, Frederick resigned his post asminister resident to Haiti. Its government had refused to allow a U.S. navalbase in its country. Give the Americans an inch and they’ll take an ell—that wasthe fear. Part of Frederick was happy to see Haiti so protective of itsautonomy.Frederick was not happy about the production of the revised edition of Life andTimes, to which he had added another hundred pages in bringing his lifeup-to-date. The paper was cheap, the binding sloppy. And this book was nobestseller. But when it came out in late 1892, Frederick had experiencedsomething far more wounding than a lousy publisher. That summer Frederick Jr.,age fifty and employed by the Pension Bureau, died in his home in Hillsdale, aneighborhood in Anacostia.By then Frederick had attended many funerals, sent dozens of condolences.Several of his twenty-one grandchildren had died as babies, toddlers, and teens.Frederick Jr.’s wife, Virginia, had died while Frederick was in Haiti. So manyof the people he had fought with and against were also gone: Dr. James McCuneSmith had died in 1865, Isaac Post in 1872, Charles Remond in 1873, GerritSmith, William Nell, and Charles Sumner in 1874, William Lloyd Garrison and JohnJones in 1879, Lucretia Mott in 1880, Henry Highland Garnet in 1882, SojournerTruth in 1883, Wendell Phillips in 1884, Martin Delany in 1885, Amy Post in1889, and James Redpath in 1891. Now in July 1892 Frederick had lost a son.Image [../images/f0163-01.jpg]Cabinet card, May 10, 1894: Frederick is with grandson Joseph Henry Douglass,who became a celebrated concert violinist. Between spring 1888 and early winter1890 Joseph studied violin at the New England Conservatory for five semesters.He reportedly also studied at the Boston Conservatory.On the old lion lived. Teas. Dinners. Speaking engagements. Invitations todedicate schools and other institutions. The correspondence he received kept himplenty busy, too. Letters from old friends, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton.Letters from new friends, such as the spitfire Ida B. Wells, journalist andanti-lynching crusader. Frederick also received letters from strangers. Alibrarian in Van Buren, Arkansas, asked for a photograph of him to hang on thewalls of his library named in his honor. A professor wrote of a young artist wholonged to do a life-size painting of Frederick.Of course letters received meant letters to send, which Frederick sometimes fellbehind on. In one dated February 4, 1894, he apologized to a friend for hisdelayed response. “I have been of late much afflicted with weakness ofvision—unable to use my eyes but for brief periods,” he explained. Frederickalso had a bad case of “la grippe” (influenza). And he was tired. Back in 1893he had served as commissioner of Haiti’s pavilion at the World’s Faircelebrating the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus’ “discovery” of theNew World. Held in Chicago, the fair was dedicated in October 1892 but didn’tget under way until early 1893. The event, which was silent on the contributionsof black Americans, had Frederick and Helen living in Chicago for months. “I hadmuch talking to do during those eight months and at times I felt that my timehad come to ask for a rest,” said Frederick in that February 4, 1894, letter.Image [../images/f0165-01.jpg]Ida B. Wells (albumen print, c. 1893). Frederick applauded Wells for heranti-lynching crusade and adored her for her graciousness toward Helen when manyblack women gave her the cold shoulder. He wrote the introduction to Wells’pamphlet The Reason Why the Colored American Is Not in the World’s ColumbianExposition.A year later, Wednesday, February 20, 1895, was hardly a day of rest forFrederick, who had recently turned seventy-seven and had a summer home underconstruction in Maryland, overlooking the Chesapeake Bay. He spent most of thatWednesday at a meeting on women’s suffrage in the capital. That night he had aspeaking engagement at Hillsdale African Church near his home. He and Helen,having supped, were standing in Cedar Hill’s front hall waiting for a carriageto take them to Hillsdale when Frederick, after being quite animated, suddenlycollapsed and he—reader, teacher, orator, self-emancipator, abolitionist,author, editor, publisher, intellectual, civil rights activist, women’s rightsactivist, public servant, diplomat, statesman, humanitarian, husband, father,grandfather—Frederick, like a faded leaf, fell from a living tree.Image [../images/f0166-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass in His Study at Cedar Hill (albumen print, c. 1893).Frederick is surrounded by more than two thousand books.

Ifthere is no struggle there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedomand yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up theground, they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the oceanwithout the awful roar of its many waters.This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one, and it may beboth moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedes nothingwithout a demand. It never did and it never will. Find out just what any peoplewill quietly submit to and you have found the exact measure of injustice andwrong which will be imposed upon them, and these will continue till they areresisted with either words or blows, or with both. The limits of tyrants areprescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress . . . . Men may not getall they pay for in this world, but they must certainly pay for all they get. Ifwe ever get free from the oppressions and wrongs heaped upon us, we must pay fortheir removal. We must do this by labor, by suffering, by sacrifice, and ifneeds be, by our lives and the lives of others.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, August 3, 1857"},{"pageContent":"AUTHOR’S NOTEImage [../images/common6.jpg]Several years ago I had the honor of delivering the keynote address for theAnnual Community Meeting of the Frederick Douglass Memorial and HistoricalAssociation in Washington, D.C. Before the program a National Park Serviceranger treated me to a private tour of Frederick’s final home, Cedar Hill.Knowing about Frederick’s life and times is one thing, but to move about hishome—see his desk and spectacles, his violin, the family’s sitting room, theparlor for guests, the room in which he slept—that was an experience like noother.By the time I visited Cedar Hill, Frederick Douglass had appeared in several ofmy books; he would appear in future ones. As I wrote him into Maritcha, Cause:Reconstruction America, Emancipation Proclamation, and Capital Days, as Iquick-sketched him in Portraits of African-American Heroes, I always felt a tug,a soft longing to do a book on him. I wanted to get to know better this man who,as Elizabeth Cady Stanton so rightly said, was “majestic in his wrath,” this manwho, as poet Robert Hayden put it, was “superb in love and logic.” I yearned toknow in my heart, not just in my head, why so many schools, parks, bridges,streets, centers, housing developments, neighborhoods, associations bear hisname. Why so many statues and monuments?Image [../images/f0171-01.jpg]1 Frederick’s inkstand is set off by a stag’s antlers to hold his pen.2 Frederick’s top hat.3 A stereoscope with a stereo view card in place. Stereo view cards present aleft- and right-eye view of the same image. When seen through the stereoscope,the image appears to be 3-D.These are just a few of the hundreds of artifacts from Frederick’s life to befound at Cedar Hill. Declared a national historic building by Congress in 1962,Cedar Hill underwent extensive restoration. It opened to the public as theFrederick Douglass National Historic Site ten years later, on February 14,Frederick’s adopted birthday.Also during school visits when the name Frederick Douglass came up, I have oftenbeen saddened by young people’s responses as to who he was. Most had little moreto say than that he was an “escaped slave,” an abolitionist, and a greatspeaker.“Escaped slave?”Frederick, who lived for seventy-seven years, spent about a quarter of his lifein slavery. But why refer to someone who regained his liberty as an “escapedslave” as if “slave” was his everlasting identity as opposed to his legal statusfor a time?As William S. McFeely pointed out in his biography Frederick Douglass, Frederickonce told his colleague James Redpath, “I shall never get beyond FrederickDouglass the self-educated fugitive slave.” McFeely went on to say, “And indeedthe American public never let him escape from being thought of as a runawayslave. Most white people could not see him as other than that remarkable coloredfellow; in this Douglass shared an experience that every black intellectual inAmerica has faced.”It is my hope that Facing Frederick will inspire readers to take a good longlook at, and think more deeply about, a multifaceted, monumental man. A manutterly beyond category.Image [../images/f0173-01.jpg]Frederick facing left in a c. 1850 daguerreotype."},{"pageContent":"“FREDERICK DOUGLASS”BY ROBERT HAYDENWhen it is finally ours, this freedom, this liberty, this beautifuland terrible thing, needful to man as air,usable as earth; when it belongs at last to all,when it is truly instinct, brain matter, diastole, systole,reflex action; when it is finally won; when it is morethan the gaudy mumbo jumbo of politicians:this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negrobeaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a worldwhere none is lonely, none hunted, alien,this man, superb in love and logic, this manshall be remembered.
