Astonishing in its breadth and depth, and told with exceptionalsensitivity, this account of an epic life that intersected with black freedomand violent white backlash is also a story of rage and forgiveness, lonelinessand charisma, bitter discouragement and fervent faith. All the way through thissoaring, page-turning book, the piercing wisdom of the extraordinary Douglassechoes and endures into our own troubled century.”—Martha Hodes, author of Mourning Lincoln“David Blight’s magnificent book bares the radical fury and inner dilemmas thatdrove one of the greatest American lives. No scholar has known FrederickDouglass better, or written about him with such emotional as well as historicalacuity. It is a biography truly worthy of its eloquent, conflicted, elusive, andheroic subject.”—Sean Wilentz, George Henry Davis 1886 Professor of American History, PrincetonUniversity, and author of The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln“David Blight’s career-long fascination with Frederick Douglass has finallygiven historians the definitive biography of one of America’s leading prophetsof freedom. Blight’s work not only humanizes Douglass, it also reframes ourunderstanding of the nineteenth century through the lens of the life ofFrederick Douglass.”—Lonnie G. Bunch III, Director, National Museum of African American History andCulture“David Blight’s beautifully written Frederick Douglass uses previously unplumbedarchives to give us the deepest portrait yet of one of America’s greatestintellectuals. The radical thinker and revolutionary is revealed here in all hiscomplexity by a gifted and learned historian with an ear for Douglass’s oracularvoice and an eye for the tragedies of nineteenth-century America. This is abiography worthy of the man.”—Wendy Warren, author of New England Bound: Slavery and Colonization in EarlyAmerica“Good historians make the best biographers. David Blight, one of our finesthistorians, has skillfully placed Frederick Douglass into his time and place andgiven us a psychologically penetrating portrait enriched by new details groundedin thorough research. This is the best biography of Douglass ever written, theone Douglass has long deserved.”—James Oakes, author of The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass,Abraham Lincoln, and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics“Never before has Frederick Douglass’s life been portrayed with such scope andauthority. The whole arc is here—his endurance of and escape from slavery, hisexperience of quasi-freedom in the North, his shifting views of how abolitionmight be achieved, and, after the war was won, his keen awareness that thestruggle for full freedom was far from over. David Blight’s probing biographywill be indispensable for anyone hoping to understand this towering figure inthe central drama of American history.”—Andrew Delbanco, Alexander Hamilton Professor of American Studies, ColumbiaUniversity, and author of The War Before the War: Fugitive Slaves and theStruggle for America’s Soul from the Revolution to the Civil War“There is hardly a more important and symbolic figure in America’s never-endingstruggle to get the universal rights we proclaimed at our founding. With hischaracteristic brilliance, David Blight brings Frederick Douglass to life; nolonger is he merely a player in the drama of Afro-American liberation, but theavatar of all of our aspirations and dreams for a truly equal society.”—Ken Burns"},{"pageContent":"Thank you for downloading this Simon & Schuster ebook.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Get a FREE ebook when you join our mailing list.

He spoke of a history that iscentral to the larger American story, one that is both contradictory andextraordinary. He likened the African American experience to the infinite depthsof Shakespeare and Scripture. The “embrace of truth as best we can know it,”said the president, is “where real patriotism lies.” Naming some of the majorpivots of the country’s past, Obama wrapped his central theme in a remarkablesentence about the Civil War era: “We’ve buttoned up our Union blues to join thefight for our freedom, we’ve railed against injustice for decade upon decade, alifetime of struggle and progress and enlightenment that we see etched inFrederick Douglass’s mighty leonine gaze.”1 [notes.html#introfn_1a]How Americans react to Douglass’s gaze, indeed how we gaze back at his visage,and more important, how we read him, appropriate him, or engage his legacies,informs how we use our past to determine who we are. Douglass’s life and writingemerge from nearly the full scope of the nineteenth century, representative ofthe best and the worst in the American spirit. Douglass constantly probed theironies of America’s contradictions over slavery and race; few Americans usedShakespeare and the Bible to comprehend his story and that of his people as muchas Douglass; and there may be no better example of an American radical patriotthan the slave who became a lyrical prophet of freedom, natural rights, andhuman equality. Obama channeled Douglass in his dedication speech; knowingly ornot, so do many people today.Born Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey, a slave, in Talbot County, Maryland,in February 1818, the future Frederick Douglass was the son of Harriet Bailey,one of five daughters of Betsy Bailey, and with some likelihood his mother’swhite owner. He saw his mother for the last time in 1825, though he hardly knewher. She died the following year. Douglass lived twenty years as a slave andnearly nine years as a fugitive slave subject to recapture. From the 1840s tohis death in 1895 he attained international fame as an abolitionist, editor,orator of almost unparalleled stature, and the author of three autobiographiesthat are classics of the genre. As a public man he began his abolitionist careertwo decades before America would divide and fight a civil war over slavery thathe openly welcomed. Douglass was born in a backwater of the slave society of theSouth just as steamboats appeared in bays and on American rivers, and before thetelegraph, the railroad, and the rotary press changed human mobility andconsciousness. He died after the emergence of electric lights, the telephone,and the invention of the phonograph. The renowned orator and traveler loved andused most of these elements of modernity and technology.Douglass was the most photographed American of the nineteenth century, explainedin this book and especially by the intrepid research of three other scholars Irely upon.2 [notes.html#introfn_2a] Although it can never really be measured, hemay also have been, along with Mark Twain, the most widely traveled Americanpublic figure of his century. By the 1890s, in sheer miles and countless numbersof speeches, he had few rivals as a lecturer in the golden age of oratory. It islikely that more Americans heard Douglass speak than any other public figure ofhis times. Indeed, to see or hear Douglass became a kind of wonder of theAmerican world. He struggled as well, with the pleasures and perils of fame asmuch as anyone else in his century, with the possible exceptions of GeneralUlysses S. Grant or P. T. Barnum. Douglass’s dilemma with fame was a matter ofdecades, not merely of moments, and fraught with racism.The orator and writer lived to see and interpret black emancipation, to workactively for women’s rights long before they were achieved, to realize the civilrights triumphs and tragedies of Reconstruction, and to witness and contributeto America’s economic and international expansion in the Gilded Age. He lived tothe age of lynching and Jim Crow laws, when America collapsed into retreat fromthe very victories and revolutions in race relations he had helped to win. Heplayed a pivotal role in America’s Second Founding out of the apocalypse of theCivil War, and he very much wished to see himself as a founder and a defender ofthe Second American Republic.In one lifetime of antislavery, literary, and political activism Douglass wasmany things, and this set of apparent paradoxes make his story so attractive tobiographers, as well as to so many constituencies today. He was a radicalthinker and a proponent of classic nineteenth-century political liberalism; atdifferent times he hated and loved his country; he was a ferocious critic of theUnited States and all of its hypocrisies, but also, after emancipation, became agovernment bureaucrat, a diplomat, and a voice for territorial expansion; hestrongly believed in self-reliance and demanded an activist-interventionistgovernment at all levels to free slaves, defeat the Confederacy, and protectblack citizens against terror and discrimination. Douglass was a seriousconstitutional thinker, and few Americans have ever analyzed race with morepoignancy and nuance than this mostly self-taught genius with words. He was aradical editor, writer, and activist, informed by a hard-earned pragmatism.Douglass was Jim-Crowed more times than he could count, but loved theDeclaration of Independence, the natural-rights tradition, and especially thereinvented US Constitution fashioned in Reconstruction. He fought against mobviolence, but believed in certain kinds of revolutionary violence. In his owncareer he heroically tried to forge a livelihood with his voice and pen, butfundamentally was not a self-made man, an image and symbol he touted in a famousspeech, and through which modern conservatives have adopted him as a proponentof individualism. He truly believed women were equal and ought to have allfundamental rights, but he conducted his personal life sometimes as a patriarchin a difficult marriage and while overseeing a large, often dysfunctionalextended family.Context and timing are often all. As James Baldwin wrote in 1948, castingsentiment and celebration aside, “Frederick Douglass was first of all aman—honest within the limitations of his character and his time, quitefrequently misguided, sometimes pompous, gifted but not always a hero, and nosaint at all.” Baldwin’s unabashed bluntness is a good place for a biographer tobegin to make judgments from the sources. But so are the interpretations of avery different writer, the former neoconservative turned neoliberal journalistand political theorist Michael Lind. In 1995 Lind rejected both a leftistmulticulturalism and a conservative self-help individualism and called for a“new nationalism,” which he termed a “multiracial/mixed race Trans-America,”with Douglass as the model. Telescoping the orator though time, Lind calledDouglass “the greatest American of all time.”Indeed the old fugitive slave has become in the early twenty-first century amalleable figure adopted by all elements in the political spectrum, not least bycurrent Republicans, who have claimed Douglass—quite ahistorically—as their ownby elevating a single feature of his thought, black self-reliance, at theexpense of his enduring radicalism. At the unveiling ceremony of the statue ofDouglass in the US Capitol in 2013, chosen by the District of Columbia as one ofthe two representatives to which each state, and the District, are entitled,congressional Republicans walked around proudly sporting large buttons that readFREDERICK DOUGLASS WAS A REPUBLICAN.3 [notes.html#introfn_3a] Douglassdescendants present, as well as some of us scholars with, shall we say,different training and research, smiled and endured. Whose Douglass? is a modernquestion rife with meaning.This book seeks Douglass’s complexity in all its forms, but never sidesteps hisessential radicalism in a search for heroes we can hold dear and in common.Douglass was and is a hero; he has been all but adopted as a national figure inIreland, Scotland, and Britain. His Narrative is read all over the world. He hasappeared in countless murals, satirical political cartoons, twenty-first-centuryworks of fiction, in paintings, and in a great deal of poetry. The sheercomplexity of his thought and life makes him an icon held in some degree ofcommonality. He was brilliant, courageous, and possessed a truly uncommonendurance. He wrote many words that will last forever. His literary genius rankswith that of many of America’s greatest writers of his century. But he was alsovain, arrogant at times, and hypersensitive to slights. He did not take well torivals who challenged his position as the greatest spokesman of his race,although he also mentored many younger black writers and leaders. He liked beingon a pedestal and did not intend to get knocked off. Douglass was thoroughly andbeautifully human.Above all, Douglass is remembered most for telling his personal story—the slavewho willed his own freedom, mastered the master’s language, saw to the core ofthe meaning of slavery, both for individuals and for the nation, and thencaptured the multiple meanings of freedom—as idea and reality, of mind andbody—as perhaps no one else ever has in America.• • •This book exists because of my lifetime interest in Douglass. But I would nothave written it had I not encountered the extraordinary private collection ofDouglass material owned by Walter O. Evans of Savannah, Georgia. The Evanscollection, cited so many times in my notes, makes possible many new insightsinto the final third of Douglass’s life. The younger Douglass—the heroic escapedslave and emerging abolitionist—is better known, in part because of the author’sfirst two autobiographies. The older Douglass, from Reconstruction to the end ofhis life in 1895, has never been so accessible or rendered so fascinating andcomplicated as in the Evans collection. This biography is, I hope, the fullestaccount ever written of the last third of Douglass’s complex and epic life.Several primary themes inform and give texture to my portrait of Douglass.Douglass was a man of words; spoken and written language was the only majorweapon of protest, persuasion, or power that he ever possessed. Throughout I tryto demonstrate the origins and growth of this man’s amazing facility to find thewords to explain America’s racial condition as well as the human condition. Inone way, this book is the biography of a voice.The autobiographies are themselves a major theme of the book. Douglass wrote andrewrote his life in three remarkable autobiographies; all Douglass scholars aredeeply dependent upon them. But the first major problem in writing Douglass’sbiography is that the subject himself is in the way. The three narratives, overtwelve hundred pages in all, are infinitely rich as sources of his traumaticyouth and his public life of more than fifty years. In the memoirs he is aself-made hero who leaves a great deal unsaid, hidden from his readers and hisbiographers. Douglass invited us into his life over and over, and it is a richliterary and historical feast to read the music of Douglass’s words. But as hesits majestically at the head of the table, it is as if he slips out of the roomright when we so wish to know more—anything—about his more private thoughts,motivations, and memories of the many conflicts in his personal life.Confronting the autobiographer in Douglass is both a pleasure and a peril as hisbiographer.Another guiding theme is Douglass’s deep grounding in the Bible, especially theOld Testament. From his earliest speeches on the abolition circuit, through hispolitical emergence in the 1850s, in his stunning orations and editorials aboutthe Civil War as an apocalyptic break in history somehow under God’sintervention, to his nearly endless postwar lecture tours, Douglass rooted hisown story and especially the story of African Americans in the oldest and mostpowerful stories of the Hebrew prophets. In America the people had turned fromor never embraced their creeds or their God; the American Jerusalem, its templesand its horrid system of slavery, had to be destroyed; the nation had to faceexile or extinction and bloody retribution; and only then could the people andthe nation experience renewal, reinvention, and a possible new history. Douglasswas a living prophet of an American destruction, exile, war for its existence,and redemption. Jeremiah and Isaiah, as well as other prophets, were his guides;they gave him story, metaphor, resolve, and ancient wisdom in order to deliverhis ferocious critique of slavery and his country before emancipation, and thenhis strained but hopeful narrative of its future after 1865.It is easy to call Douglass a prophet; this book attempts to show how he meritsthat lofty title. “The prophet is human,” wrote the great Jewish theologianAbraham Heschel, “yet he employs notes one octave too high for our ears. Heexperiences moments that defy our understanding. He is neither ‘a singing saint’nor ‘a moralizing poet,’ but an assaulter of the mind. Often his words begin toburn where conscience ends.”4 [notes.html#introfn_4a] Careful readers ofDouglass will at times stop on passages that make them shudder or melt inrecognition, as their minds are assaulted or perhaps uplifted. This bookattempts to demonstrate how Douglass came by his King James cadences, as well ashow he used biblical story to break down and rebuild, as Jeremiah recollectedhis own charge, an American world. Douglass succeeded and failed, as did theprophets of old.From the middle of his turbulent life on, a primary theme of the book is howDouglass moved along crooked paths from a radical outsider, through time andtranscendent events, to a political insider. During the greatest pivot ofAmerican history—the Civil War era—this man of language reaped great change totransform from a radical abolitionist into a Republican Party functionary. Thesechanges are historical, inextricably linked to events and time, not merely amatter of moral growth or decline; and they provide a model for many otherleaders, particularly African American, who have undergone the same process inthe 150 years since. The outsider-to-insider story especially animates thesecond half of the book, and it caused one of Douglass’s most challengingpsychic dilemmas. He repeatedly faced the question of how uncompromisingradicalism could mix with a learned pragmatism to try to influence real power,to determine how to condemn the princes and their laws but also influence andeventually join them.Another theme that drives this book is the turbulent relationship of Douglass’spublic and private lives. Throughout I try to keep a balance between these tworegisters of any person’s story. In Douglass’s case, he married twice, first toAnna Murray Douglass, a black woman born free in Maryland who remained largelyilliterate but the center of his home life through many dislocations forforty-four years, and second to Helen Pitts Douglass, a highly educated whitewoman twenty years his junior and a remarkably compatible companion during hisfinal decade. Douglass sustained important friendships with two white Europeanwomen, Julia Griffiths from England and Ottilie Assing from Germany, both ofwhom became extremely important influences of differing kinds in his life. Mostimportant, though, Douglass and Anna had five children, four of whom lived intoadulthood. Among them they produced twenty-one grandchildren for the Douglasses.During the last quarter or so of the famous man’s life, this extended family,which came to include even some fictive kin and a variety of protégés, becamefinancially and often emotionally dependent on the patriarch of a clan often inconflict with itself. Douglass sustained backbreaking and health-threateninglecture tours in his older years in part to support this extended family and abig house on a hill in Washington, DC, near the centers of Gilded Age power thathe could only partially penetrate. This story is at once Douglass’s own uniquesaga and very modern. He experienced at least two emotional breakdowns in hislife, and both can be explained in great part by the treacherous character ofthis public-private divide.And finally, this book probes how Douglass was a many-sided intellectual, aneditor, a writer in numerous genres—memoir, short-form editorials, extendedspeeches, and one work of fiction. He wrote and spoke millions of words; histrove of commentary contains beauty, brilliant storytelling, sermons, politicalstump speeches, and assaults on the mind that are his legacy and the essentialreason we know him. In roughly the last forty years Douglass has more and morebeen treated by scholars as a political philosopher, a constitutional and legalanalyst, an author capable of prose poetry, a proponent of the natural-rightstradition, a self-conscious voice of and about the nature of memory, a religiousand theological thinker, a journalist, and an advocate of broader publiceducation. Today Douglass is taught and examined in law schools, in history,English, art, political science, and philosophy departments, in high schools,graduate schools, and community reading groups. In this book I try at all timesto balance as best I can the narrative of his life with analyses of his evolvingmind, to give his ideas a central place in his unforgettable story.• • •It is Douglass’s story, though, that lasts and gives and instructs. There is nogreater voice of America’s terrible transformation from slavery to freedom thanDouglass’s. For all who wish to escape from outward or inward captivity, theywould do well to feel the pulses of this life, and to read the words of thisvoice. And then go act in the world. In the final lines of My Bondage and MyFreedom in 1855, as the politics of the slavery crisis embroiled the nation,Douglass wrote that he would never forget his “own humble origins” nor cease“while Heaven lends me ability, to use my voice, my pen, or my vote, to advocatethe great and primary work of the universal and unconditional emancipation of myentire race.”5 [notes.html#introfn_5a] As we look upon Douglass’s leonine gazein our own time, we may recognize that such universal work continues."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 1--------------------------------------------------------------------------------FIRST THINGSGenealogical trees do not flourish among slaves.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1855Throughout the spring morning of April 14, 1876, a huge crowd, largely AfricanAmerican, began to assemble in the vicinity of Seventh and K Streets inWashington, DC. It had been eleven Aprils since the end of the Civil War, andeleven years to the day since the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. A paradeinvolving nearly every African American organization in the city was about tostep off at noon en route to the unveiling of an extraordinary monument toLincoln.1 [notes.html#ch1fn_1a] The city had witnessed many remarkable paradessince the end of the war, but this one would be different.The day was declared a public holiday in Washington, and flags above the Capitolas well as other government buildings flew at half-mast. At the head of theprocession rode a contingent of twenty-seven mounted police, followed by threecompanies of black militia troops, headed by the Philharmonic Band ofGeorgetown. Numerous other cornet bands, marching drum corps, youth clubs incolorful uniforms, and fraternal orders from both Washington and Baltimorefilled in the long line with pride and pomp. The Knights of St. Augustinecarried a large banner with a painting of the martyred Lincoln. Horse-drawncarriages carried, among others, the black, Virginia freeborn professor, anddean of the Howard University law school, John Mercer Langston, who wouldperform as master of ceremonies, and the orator of the day, a newly arrivedresident of Washington, the famed abolitionist and editor Frederick Douglass,who had grown up a slave across Chesapeake Bay on the Eastern Shore ofMaryland.2 [notes.html#ch1fn_2a] Langston and Douglass were soon to become openpolitical and personal rivals, but on this day they joined in one of the mostimportant public events of their lives.The procession moved westward along K Street to Seventeenth Street, then south afew blocks and through the grounds of the Executive Mansion (the White House,which in those days was not walled off by security), and on to PennsylvaniaAvenue. The parade traveled eastward directly toward the Capitol, turningbriefly right on First Street West, then around the south Capitol grounds toFirst Street East, and finally on to East Capitol Street. For eleven more blocksthe bands, marchers, and carriages passed throngs of people until they reachedEleventh Street, at the edge of fields and an emerging residential square. Thesetting was much better than on the Washington Mall, which at that time wasswampy and unhealthy, used in places as a dump.3 [notes.html#ch1fn_3a]A festive crowd awaited the parade, and a tall statue stood draped and concealedin flags and bunting. Next to the monument a stage and large speaker’s standawaited a distinguished array of guests. President Ulysses S. Grant, now nearingthe end of his second and final term in office, arrived before the paradereached the park and was accompanied by many US senators—including Oliver P.Morton, George Boutwell, John Sherman, and Blanche K. Bruce—members of thepresident’s cabinet, the justices of the US Supreme Court, many members of theHouse of Representatives, and a large contingent of other government officialsas well as some former Union generals. Near the platform, the Marine Band struckup “Hail, Columbia” as the speakers walked from their carriages and the hundredsof marchers found their places in the vast audience.4 [notes.html#ch1fn_4a]As the ceremony began, Bishop John M. Brown of the AME Church delivered aninvocation, and J. Henri Burch of Louisiana read the Emancipation Proclamation.At the conclusion of the reading, the band played “La Marseillaise.” Langstonintroduced James E. Yeatman, a St. Louis banker and head of the WesternSantitary Commission, the organization that had led the fund-raising among theformer slaves and black Civil War veterans of Missouri and elsewhere in thecountry who provided the nearly $20,000 that paid for the monument. Yeatmanexplained how a former slave woman, Charlotte Scott, had donated the first $5,and how the commission had sought the American sculptor Thomas Ball, who residedin Italy, to conceive and create the statue.5 [notes.html#ch1fn_5a]This remarkable monument, the Freedmen’s Memorial, as it became known, was manyyears in the making, the result of various designs and changes in purpose andmeaning. In Yeatman’s lengthy remarks, he told of Ball’s “labor of love,” his“tribute to American patriotism” through the “gratitude of the freed people.” Ina triumphal narrative, Yeatman described how Ball sent four photographs of hisoriginal model of a standing Lincoln and a kneeling slave to the SanitaryCommission, which in turn sent him a photograph of a former fugitive slave namedArcher Alexander, whom the sculptor then depicted, with muscular torso, lookingupward, his fist clenched, and in part breaking his own chains under thepresident’s guiding arm. Since Ball had been convinced by the commission and bythe image of Alexander to alter his conception from a “kneeling slave . . .represented as perfectly passive” (freedom given), to an “emancipated slave [as]agent in his own deliverance” (freedom seized), Yeatman concluded that themonument was an “ideal group . . . converted into the literal truth ofhistory.”6 [notes.html#ch1fn_6a]Image [../images/f0003-01.jpg]The Freedmen’s Memorial (Emancipation Monument). Unveiled April 1876,Washington, DC. It stands today in the middle of Lincoln Park. Thomas Ballsculptor.Such a ceremonial day in the spring sunshine, surrounded by the highestofficials of the federal government, at a monument unveiling unlike any otherthat had occurred in America, was hardly an occasion for literal truth, whetherin bronze or in words. But through all the pageantry would waft some powerfulsymbolic truths in unforgettable language. Langston stepped to the podium andasked President Grant to come forward to pull the cord and unveil the monument.As Grant stood still for a long moment, the entire crowd hushed in rapt silence.Not a good ceremonial speaker, the president delivered no remarks. As the flagsand draperies fell away, the throng broke into loud applause and shouts, cannonwere fired nearby in a field, and the band struck up “Hail to the Chief.” Thoseup close could see on the base of the monument the word EMANCIPATION, cut inlarge letters. Langston next read two congratulatory letters from people who hadplayed roles in bringing about the monument. A poem, “Lincoln,” written by ayoung black Washington poet, Cordelia Ray, was recited. Then, as parts of thecrowd had settled into chairs and others felt the spring breezes over theirheads, Langston finally introduced Douglass, orator of the day.7[notes.html#ch1fn_7a]Along with Langston and many other black leaders, Douglass had stronglysupported various efforts to build a major Lincoln and emancipation monumentsince at least September 1865. That month he had called for a humble memorialthat “would express one of the holiest sentiments of the human heart.” Hisremark came in the immediate post–Civil War period when many white sponsors ofsuch a Lincoln monument openly called on blacks to demonstrate “gratitude” fortheir liberation. Douglass had never been one to believe he had to prove hisgratitude or dignity or even his acumen to whites generally. He had longunderstood that a national monument to Lincoln would be a major civicundertaking as well as a statement about the place of black people in America.From his own visceral experience as a slave and fugitive slave who plotted hisown escape, he fully understood just how much freedom for black Americans wasboth seized and given. Douglass had long favored what he called a “people’smonument . . . without distinction of color,” a tribute that would reflect thestory of interracial abolitionism that he believed had helped bring Lincoln tothe Emancipation Proclamation, as well as to the new, potentially reimaginednation of 1865, devoted to a future of “common rights and common equality beforethe law.”8 [notes.html#ch1fn_8a]But as Douglass rose to speak in April 1876 to finally dedicate such a monument,he, the recognized voice of black America, had prepared a speech of remarkablehonesty, poignancy, and present-minded historical insight. “First things arealways interesting,” he declared, “and this is one of our first things. It isthe first time that, in this form and manner, we have sought to do honor to anAmerican great man.” Douglass made it clear that he spoke, at least at first,only as an African American, for his race. The event was a first for a secondreason that Douglass did not mention: black people had never before beenrepresented on a national monument.9 [notes.html#ch1fn_9a] In this chargedatmosphere of artistic and political firsts, on the eve of the nation’scentennial and amid the deeply disturbing decline and violent overthrow ofReconstruction in the South, Douglass struck notes both majestic and somber. Hisspeech assumed the tone of a requiem, tempered by modest celebration, restrainednationalism, and redemptive hope.African Americans had tenuously arrived finally and openly in the center of thecountry’s highest affairs. Douglass made it clear that the unveiling of thismonument to Lincoln and emancipation was a “national act,” performed by citizensin the place where “every pulsation of the national heart can be heard, felt,and reciprocated.” He insisted on an initial history lesson, referring to the“vast and wonderful change in our condition” (black freedom and citizenship). Nosuch open commemoration by blacks in Washington would have been tolerated beforethe Civil War’s transformations, without opening “flood-gates of wrath andviolence.” Douglass congratulated all, white and black, famous and ordinary, onthis “contrast between then and now.” The orator conditioned his audience forthe harder truths and starker metaphors to come by letting them feel the “longand dark history” of slavery as a matter of the past, replaced now by “liberty,progress, and enlightenment.”10 [notes.html#ch1fn_10a]No African American speaker had ever faced this kind of captive audience,composed of all the leadership of the federal government in one place; and nosuch speaker would ever again until Barack Obama was inaugurated president inJanuary 2009. Douglass, a master ironist about America, did not miss this momentof supreme symbolism. He named each contingent of every branch of the governmentsitting before him, including President Grant, Chief Justice Morrison Waite,senators and representatives, cabinet officials, all acknowledged as “wise andpatriotic.” In this moment, the government was something sacred and enduring,newly remade from recent near destruction, the protector of a reconsecratedfreedom for whites and blacks. The high officials may have smiled and felt theirchests swell at the former slave’s patriotic language. Douglass struck chords ofcivil religion as he described the “stately pillars and majestic dome of theCapitol” and the District’s springtime surroundings as “our church.” In this newAmerica, “all races, colors, and conditions of men” composed “our congregation.”“We the colored people,” proclaimed Douglass, “rejoicing in our blood-boughtfreedom,” now brought the same experience and sentiment, like all otherAmericans who lay in nearby Arlington Cemetery. “For the first time in thehistory of our people,” the orator proudly announced, “and in the history of thewhole American people, we join in this high worship.”11 [notes.html#ch1fn_11a]Then Douglass turned to the memory of Lincoln, and the speech assumed adifferent tone. While claiming a place for his people in honoring the martyredpresident, Douglass suddenly used words that may have shocked some in hisaudience: “It must be admitted, truth compels me to admit, even here in thepresence of the monument we have erected to his memory, Abraham Lincoln wasnot . . . either our man or our model. In his interests, in his associations, inhis habits of thought, and in his prejudices, he was a white man.” Douglass musthave caused some squirming in the chairs as he injected race so forthrightlyinto his rhetorical tribute. Grant might have inwardly flinched. It was asthough Douglass had decided to give voice to the kneeling slave on the statue,who would now say thank you as well as speak some bitter truths about a realhistory, and not merely allow the occasion to be one of proud, nationalself-congratulation. It was as though Douglass was saying—you gave me thisunique platform today, and I will therefore teach these lessons about the jaggedand tragic paths by which black people achieved freedom in the agony of war. “He[Lincoln] was preeminently the white man’s president,” Douglass continued in hisforceful baritone, “entirely devoted to the welfare of the white man. He wasready and willing at any time during the first years of his administration todeny, postpone, and sacrifice the rights of humanity in the colored people topromote the welfare of the white people of the country.”12[notes.html#ch1fn_12a]Douglass employed a stunning level of directness for such a ceremonial occasion.He did not merely turn his moment in the national sun into a reminiscence abouta good war and glorious outcomes. Lincoln’s growth to greatness and to the roleof Emancipator, he insisted, must first be seen through the disappointments ofhis first year in office. Douglass would not consider the triumphal memory of1865 without first pulling his audience through the pain of 1861. During thesecession crisis and into 1862, he remembered, Lincoln had promised to supportall constitutional protections of slavery in the Southern states. He “waswilling to pursue, recapture, and send back the fugitive slave to his master,” aposition Douglass had utterly condemned during the crisis. The formerabolitionist forgot nothing of Lincoln’s record on race and slavery, especiallythe episode in 1862 when in a meeting with five black ministers at the WhiteHouse, the president “strangely told us that we were to leave the land in whichwe were born,” or when “he told us he would save the Union with slavery” and“refused to retaliate our murder and torture as colored soldiers.”13[notes.html#ch1fn_13a] The litany of Lincoln’s sins against the cause ofabolition was long and ugly, especially for this celebratory moment. ButDouglass rejected empty politeness.Then came the most striking and lasting words of the speech. “The race to whichwe belong were not the special objects of his [Lincoln’s] consideration,”Douglass declared to the ages. “My white fellow-citizens . . . you are thechildren of Abraham Lincoln. We are at best only his stepchildren; children byadoption, children by forces of circumstances and necessity.” But one of thosestepchildren was lecturing the nation and its leaders on that April day. “Toyou,” he told whites in the audience, belonged the prime responsibility ofhonoring Lincoln. Then, he implored them to let the stepchildren have theirplace in the commemoration. “Despise not the humble offering we this dayunveil,” he pleaded, “for while Abraham Lincoln saved for you a country, hedelivered us from a bondage, according to Jefferson, one hour of which was worsethan ages of the oppression your fathers rose in rebellion to oppose.”14[notes.html#ch1fn_14a]Although blacks’ faith in Lincoln, who had “tarried long in the mountain,” hadbeen sorely tested, Douglass found a middle way, a historically balancedremembrance of Lincoln in this new moment of national trial. Through a“comprehensive view . . . in the stern logic of events, and in view of thedivinity that shapes our ends,” he said, blacks, despite grief and bewildermentat the president’s slow actions, concluded “that the hour and the man of ourredemption had somehow met in the person of Abraham Lincoln.” In Douglass’sanalysis, historical circumstance had in the end made Lincoln the “head of agreat movement.” Most important, Douglass used a refrain that formed theargument of his speech. “Under his rule,” he repeatedly declared, all manner ofgreat change came about: slaves were lifted from bondage to self-aware liberty;black men exchanged rags for Union soldiers’ uniforms; two hundred thousandmarched in the cause; the black republic of Haiti received recognition; thedomestic slave trade was abolished and a slave trader hanged as a pirate andmurderer; and the “Confederate States, based upon the idea that our race must beslaves . . . [was] battered to pieces and scattered to the four winds.” And“under his rule,” the “immortal paper,” the Emancipation Proclamation, emerged,“making slavery forever impossible in the United States.”15[notes.html#ch1fn_15a]Douglass had named the pain and betrayal of ages. Now he entered thecelebration. He remembered poignantly his own special experience of Emancipationnight, January 1, 1863, in Boston. He acknowledged that Lincoln had had to worktoward emancipation against virulently racist opposition and therefore had tofind the delicate method and timing for such a revolution. He recognized howdeeply intertwined Union and emancipation had become, not least because ofLincoln’s brilliant political statesmanship. Hence, “viewed from the genuineabolition ground, Mr. Lincoln seemed tardy, cold, dull, and indifferent; butmeasuring him from the sentiment of his country, a sentiment he was bound as astatesman to consult, he was swift, zealous, radical, and determined.”16[notes.html#ch1fn_16a] As the mature political activist and writer, observer ofworld-historical transformations and betrayals, Douglass had learned much aboutboth the burden and the uses of ambivalence.In the rhetorical twists and turns of this complex speech, Douglass had oneoverriding target—the declension and betrayal of Reconstruction in the South bythe federal government. “Under his rule and in due time” was Douglass’s way ofsaying not simply that Lincoln had personally saved and reimagined the Union, aswell as liberated the slaves, but that the entire nation had done so and carriedthe burden of responsibility. That black freedom and the fate of the Civil Warconstitutional amendments—the civic lives and personal survival of thefreedpeople—were on the line in the South at that very moment, and that Grantand the government had to be called to action, formed Douglass’s essentialsubject. But, it already seemed too late.By 1876, a pivotal general election year and the nation’s centennialcelebration, only three Southern states remained “unredeemed” by the whitecounterrevolution against Reconstruction. Each of them—Louisiana, SouthCarolina, and Florida—had Republican-controlled regimes teetering on the brinkof political extinction at the hands of terror, murder, and election fraudorganized in the service of the Democratic Party and white supremacy. Indeed,the white South’s revival and takeover of its political fate, and the systematicdestruction of black civil and political rights as well as economicindependence, had left a cloud of despair over what remained of anyReconstruction policy by the Grant administration. Worst of all, the experimentin racial democracy born of emancipation and the remaking of the USConstitution—the dream come true in 1865 and the legacy Douglass had for morethan ten years trumpeted as the long-term hope of his people—not only lay intatters; it had been crushed by widespread, unpunished violence. Many hundredsmurdered trying to vote or establish livelihoods, thousands more tortured orintimidated away from voting, and ballot boxes stuffed or stolen: this was thesorrowful state of American democracy in that spring of 1876.17[notes.html#ch1fn_17a] Each note of either cautionary woe or modest celebrationin Douglass’s dedication speech at the monument with Lincoln standingmajestically over the kneeling, subservient former slave needs to be consideredthrough this story of the impending fateful defeat of Reconstruction. At one andthe same time, the speech was Douglass’s careful statement of the great growthand change that Lincoln had presided over during the revolutionary war years anda lament over the apparent success of the counterrevolution against it.As he concluded, Douglass gave his audience a thoroughly mythic Lincoln, a giftfrom freed slaves to the nation’s best sense of itself, despite all the terroremanating from the South. He brought the Illinoisan into the community offreedmen—the president had been “a man of work, a son of toil . . . theplebeian . . . honest boatman” whose “moral training” came from labor. On thisanniversary of the assassination, Douglass culled that national nightmare forall its redemptive symbolism as well as power in the politics of memory.Lincoln’s murder, he declared, was not only the “hell-black . . . revenge” ofConfederate agents, but “the crowning crime of slavery” itself. AsReconstruction fell to new hell-black actions by ex-Confederates, Douglass spoketo and for the black people who had planned and provided this event. This was a“good work for our race today,” he announced, “fastening ourselves to aname . . . immortal,” and “defending ourselves” against all who would “scourgeus beyond the range of human brotherhood.”18 [notes.html#ch1fn_18a] Douglass’sFreedmen’s Memorial Address was the tortured effort of a national stepchild tofind the words that might still make the high and mighty of the United Stateshold the remaining lifeline to his people. It was an extraordinary “first thing”he dearly hoped would not be a last thing.• • •Douglass knew something of “toil” and “honest boatmen”; he was born a slavewithin yards of the Tuckahoe River on Maryland’s Eastern Shore. He traveled in asloop out the Wye and Miles Rivers and up the Chesapeake Bay to Baltimore as ayouth, and he crossed the Susquehanna and the Hudson in his epic escape fromslavery. He knew something of rivers.When the shad or herring were running, Betsy Bailey, Douglass’s grandmother, amaster fisherwoman, would often spend half days waist deep in the beautiful,nearly one-hundred-yard-wide Tuckahoe, tending and pulling her seine nets. Oneof the greatest stories in American history began in February 1818 at thenorthwest corner of a horseshoe bend in the Tuckahoe, just above its muddy banksand layers of lush reeds, around a humble cabin managed by Betsy, a slave, andher husband, Isaac Bailey, a free man. Douglass lived most of his life believingthat he had been born in 1817, but a handwritten inventory of slaves, kept byhis owner at birth, Aaron Anthony, recorded “Frederick Augustus, son of Harriet,Feby. 1818.” He may have been born in the grandparents’ cabin, or in slavequarters near the tenant farmer’s house not far away where his mother likelylived, or even in a field nearby. The land and the extended families of slaveswere part of the Holme Hill Farm, owned by Anthony, whom Douglass called “oldmaster.” Anthony owned some thirty people and adjoining farms of six hundredacres in all, although he did not live at Holme Hill; he was the managingoverseer of a much larger operation, the Wye plantation, some twelve miles tothe west.19 [notes.html#ch1fn_19a] By his brutal exercise of power, and possiblyby blood, Anthony was, and still is, a crucial and mysterious figure inDouglass’s story.Image [../images/f0010-01.jpg]Map of Talbot County, Maryland, with farm limits, by William H. Dilworth, 1858.It shows the Anthony farm on which Douglass was born at the horseshoe bend inthe Tuckahoe River.The district in which Douglass lived his first six years was known as Tuckahoe,in the northeast section of Talbot County, the whole of which was drained by thelarger Choptank River as it meandered to Chesapeake Bay. Douglass lateruncharitably described the area as “famine stricken” with a “worn-out, sandy,desert-like appearance of its soil.” But he could also remember with a sombernostalgia the “stillness of Tuckahoe,” and the “Kentucky Ravine,” as it waslocally known, which provided a path down to the river’s edge. The nearestvillages, and the first towns he ever saw, were Hillsboro just two miles upriverto the north of the Baileys’ cabin, and Denton, due east across the river inCaroline County, some five miles away. The boy enjoyed many hours of watchingthe commercial bustle and the great wheel around Lee’s Mill, just a mile northacross fields of corn.20 [notes.html#ch1fn_20a]Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey was the son of Harriet Bailey, one of Betsyand Isaac’s five enslaved daughters. The second of the multiple names, mostuncommon for a slave, can be attributed to his uncle Augustus, Harriet’sbrother, who had died two years before the boy’s birth. Washington? Perhaps hismother, lonely and sexually abused, with so little to provide for her newborn,sought in a moment of anguished pride to link this child to the father of thecountry, rather than to a father he could never really know. Frederick onlyrarely saw his mother in the first years of his life; his tender and lyricalremembrances of her are almost pure invention. He never saw her at hisgrandmother’s cabin, but recollected a handful of nighttime visits from hismother after he was transferred to the large Wye plantation at age six. Born in1792, Harriet gave birth to seven children between 1813 and 1825. Year afteryear, she was hired out to other farms, often as much as twelve miles away; butshe sometimes walked the distances to visit her children at night and trekkeddusty paths back to meet the overseer’s horn by morning. “My poor mother,”Douglass wrote, “like many other slave women, had many children, but NOFAMILY!”21 [notes.html#ch1fn_21a]Douglass’s knowledge of his mother, he maintained, was “scanty, but verydistinct. Her personal appearance and bearing are ineffaceably stamped upon mymemory.” As time passed in his autobiographical quest, Douglass’s mother grew instature, beauty, and influence. In 1845, he recollected that he had never seenher in daylight; but by 1855, she emerged from memory “tall and finelyproportioned; of deep black glossy complexion; had regular features, and, amongother slaves, was remarkably sedate in her manners.” What the cruelty of slaveryhad stolen from him, he seized back in his empowering imagination. Douglassfound a picture of an Egyptian king, Ramses, in James Cowles Prichard’s NaturalHistory of Man, “the features of which so resemble those of my mother, that Ioften recur to it with something of the feeling which I suppose othersexperience when looking upon the pictures of dear departed ones.”22[notes.html#ch1fn_22a] The mother he hardly knew became dignified, even regal,all but without gender, and one of many shields of protection he built aroundhimself as a storyteller.In a scene that became common in male slave narratives, Douglass told of thelast time he saw his mother. In 1825 (perhaps February), not long after he hadbeen taken to live with Anthony’s family at the Wye House, and under the stern,abusive rule of the cook, Aunt Katy, Douglass remembered a wonderful visit fromHarriet Bailey—at least while it lasted. Frederick had greatly annoyed Aunt Katyone day, and she promised as punishment to “starve the life out of me.” When allthe other children hanging around the kitchen received their warm corn bread,Katy purposely denied young Fred even a morsel. As he sat in a dark corner ofthe kitchen as the night wore on, hungry and stealing some Indian corn from ashelf, suddenly his mother appeared to save him. Harriet gave her boy a sweetginger cake and “read Aunt Katy a lecture she never forgot.” The cake was in the“shape of a heart, with a rich, dark ring glazed upon the edge of it,” implyingthat it may have been Valentine’s Day around the Anthony farms. Douglass calledthis a pivotal scene in his early life and converted it into both stingingantislavery propaganda, and an unforgettable expression of the personal pain andloss at the heart of his childhood. “That night I learned the fact,” heremembered, “that I was not only a child, but somebody’s child. . . . I wasvictorious . . . for the moment; prouder on my mother’s knee than a king uponhis throne.” But the moment was brief. He dropped off to blissful sleep; in themorning his mother had gone back to her field hand’s duty miles away. It was thelast time he saw Harriet Bailey; she died sometime the next year in 1826, herillness and her grave unknown. Douglass implies that he was told of his mother’sillness as she deteriorated out at the Holme Hill farm, but “was not allowed tovisit her.”23 [notes.html#ch1fn_23a]As a world-famous abolitionist in 1855, Douglass knew well how this story wouldplay on the emotions of his readers; but his words must also be read andinterpreted as a child’s screams transported by memory into the anguished heartof a lifelong orphan. “The heartless and ghastly form of slavery rises betweenmother and child, even at the bed of death,” he offered to his sentimentalreaders. Then, he simply spoke for himself and millions of other former slaves,dead and living: “It has been a life-long, standing grief to me, that I knew solittle of my mother; and that I was so early separated from her. The counsels ofher love must have been beneficial to me. The side view of her face is imaged onmy memory, and I take few steps in life, without feeling her presence; but theimage is mute, and I have no striking words of her’s treasured up.” Douglasscould see her only from a blurry side view, her voice muted, her very presenceglimpsed from a picture of Egyptian majesty and physiognomy in a natural-historybook. But he was not left silent. With great enthusiasm he said he later learnedthat his mother could read, and that she was the “only one of all the slaves andcolored people in Tuckahoe” who could do so. Her “achievement . . . was veryextraordinary,” he proudly declared, and for his own love of letters he creditedthe “native genius of my sable, unprotected, and uncultivated mother—whobelonged to a race whose mental endowments it is . . . fashionable to hold indisparagement and contempt.”24 [notes.html#ch1fn_24a] For such a great oratorand writer to make this claim says at the very least a good deal about howdearly he yearned to know and understand his genealogical and temporal roots inthe people and soil of Maryland’s Eastern Shore. It also may say that, even toDouglass himself, his extraordinary talent with language—his voice—remainedsomething of a beautiful mystery.The identity of his father was an equal, but hardly beautiful, mystery. Thisfact, Douglass wrote in 1855, “is shrouded in a mystery I have never been ableto penetrate.” For the rest of his life he searched in vain for the name of histrue father. In his 1845 Narrative, Douglass stated, “My father was a whiteman . . . admitted to be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage.” Manyin the neighborhood also “whispered that my master was my father; but of thecorrectness of this opinion I know nothing.” By 1855, his father was stilldefinitely a “white man, or nearly white.” Now, however, Douglass said he was nolonger giving credence to Aaron Anthony as his father; Douglass claimed that hehad “reason to think he was not.” By the 1881 writing of Life and Times ofFrederick Douglass, the author’s third autobiography, the paternity dilemma allbut vanished with the simple statement “of my father I know nothing.”25[notes.html#ch1fn_25a] This was never the case for Douglass. The question wasdeeply important for him, and in 1855 he dwelled at great length on whitefathers of slaves.Indeed, he dwelled on Aaron Anthony. “I say nothing of father. . . . Slaverydoes away with fathers as it does away with families,” he wrote. “The order ofcivilization is reversed here.” Then he searched with intensity and descriptivedetail for a sense of Anthony’s character as the first father figure in hislife. Anthony was fifty-one years old when Frederick Bailey was born, and heowned the adult daughters of Betsy Bailey. But as yet we have no smoking-gunevidence that Anthony is Douglass’s natural father. Anthony had two survivingsons in 1818, Andrew and Richard, at ages twenty-one and eighteen; they arepossible candidates, but with no evidence even of the hearsay variety thatDouglass grew up with about the elder Anthony. Douglass carefully described the“old master” as essentially a cruel tyrant, capable of terrible physical andemotional violence, but a man victimized as much by the system of slavery as byhis own nature, a theme Douglass repeated as a major part of hisautobiographies. He also remembered occasional moments of distracted humanity inAnthony. Most of the time, Anthony paid little if any attention to the slavechildren around the Wye plantation yards; he was a busy overseer of theoverseers, managing the economic and labor demands of a huge agricultural andcommerical enterprise. But on at least one occasion, Douglass remembered OldMaster’s “affectionate disposition . . . gently leading me by the hand—as hesometimes did—patting me on the head, speaking to me in soft, caressing tones,and calling me ‘his little Indian boy.’ ” Douglass used this “almost fatherly”act as background for a withering portrait of a smoldering volcano, a“brittle . . . unhappy man . . . of haggard aspect . . . muttering to himself”as he “stormed about . . . cursing and gesticulating” at his “invisible foes.”26[notes.html#ch1fn_26a]Born in 1767, Aaron Anthony was the seventh and final child of poor, illiteratefarmers from the Tuckahoe Neck, the land immediately across the Tuckahoe Riverto the east in Caroline County. Douglass later described the poor whites such asAnthony who hailed from there as “the lowest order, indolent, and drunken to aproverb.” Like Frederick Bailey, Anthony was an orphan (both parents died whenhe was a child) who made his own way in the world and became a self-made manfrom extremely humble roots. He loved and managed money well. Like many EasternShoremen he also handled boats well, became a seaman, and a captain eventuallyof the most prominent schooner on Chesapeake Bay, owned and operated by EdwardLloyd. Almost always upwardly mobile, Captain Anthony, as he was often called,married up to Ann Catherine Skinner in 1797 and soon took up residence in arent-free house on the Lloyds’ Wye plantation as head overseer of some thirteenfarms, nearly ten thousand acres, and more than five hundred slaves. Since heowned Betsy Bailey, as a slaveholder Anthony likely did not need to buy moreslaves of his own. Apart from the ten children Betsy herself bore, from 1799 to1826, her five daughters gave birth to at least twenty more among them. By anymeasure, Anthony was a success story as the manager of the Lloyd slave empireand owner of three large farms of his own that he rented out, at least untilafter his wife died in 1818, the year Douglass was born. From then until hisdeath in November 1826, Anthony may have descended into mental instability andincreased sexual aggression.27 [notes.html#ch1fn_27a]Douglass famously recorded an incident that gives credence to this image ofAnthony as old and angry, lecherous and violent. Shortly after arriving at theWye House at age six and joining the swarm of slave children there, Douglass wasasleep early one morning in his normal place, “the floor of a rough closet,which opened into the kitchen.” He was awakened by the “shrieks and piteouscries” of his fifteen-year-old aunt Hester. Anthony had dragged her into thekitchen at dawn, made her strip to the waist, forced her to stand on a bench onher toes as her wrists were tied to a wooden joist above her head. Old masterstood behind Hester, her neck, shoulders, and back “entirely naked,” an uglycowskin switch (the lash) in his hand, shouting “d__d b__h” and other“epithets . . . too coarse and blasphemous” for readers to bear. LittleFrederick looked on in horror through “cracks” in the boards as Anthony adjustedthe whip in his hand, steadied his feet for leverage, and dealt one overhandblow after another to the young woman’s bleeding neck and shoulder blades. Theblood dripped on her clothes and down to the floor; the old man clenched histeeth, gripped the cowskin, and delivered his “torture,” seemingly “delightedwith the scene.”28 [notes.html#ch1fn_28a]Embedded in Douglass’s rendering of this scene is his broader discussion ofAnthony’s motives for such a beating. Hester had been seeing a young slaveteenager, Ned Roberts (also fifteen years old), and Douglass describes both ofthem as beautiful and attractive young people, falling in love. Hester hadrejected Anthony’s advances and paid dearly for it on that morning. Anthony,Douglass reported, wanted to “break up the growing intimacy” of the younglovers, but his efforts were to no avail. Douglass turned this episode of hischildhood into a parable about the sexual corruption and the spirit-killingimmorality at the center of the master-slave relationship. Hester lived with the“curse” of her “personal beauty,” and Ned with his almost powerless desire tocourt and marry her. The jealous Anthony’s intentions were “abhorrent” in everysense, his “methods . . . foolish.” What slavery so lacked in sexual andfamilial relations, Douglass offered, was a sense of normalcy, of the peace inwhich to love freely. Hester should have been free to give her affections to thehandsome young man she liked, and Ned free to become a husband. But “who orwhat,” asked Douglass the autobiographer, “was this old master?” His answer? Atyrant with no bounds, a torturer, a man any civilized society would try andconvict for his “awful criminality.” But alas, Anthony, exhausted from thewhipping, wiping off the “blood-clotted cowskin,” ushered the mangled andweeping Hester out of the kitchen, not knowing that a little boy crouched in acloset peering in terror at the blood on the floor.29 [notes.html#ch1fn_29a]Douglass’s crafting of the beating of his beautiful young aunt is a formerslave’s recitation of an overwhelmingly vivid, traumatic memory of a morning ina slave boy’s terrible education. It took him many years to understand and findthe language for the rage that old master’s whip and Hester’s blood had left inhim.If Anthony had been his father, Douglass dearly wanted to know the truth. Butmore important, he put him to use as a symbol, the sexual predator in the evilsystem that ruined all decency in humanity. Unforgivingly, Douglass made Anthonyinto the father of fathers among slaveholders. He turned that haunting whisperof his youth (“master is your father”) into a condemnation of the sexual abuse,and its spawn of hundreds of thousands of mulatto children, at the heart ofslavery in America. The pain of not knowing with certainty the identity of hisown father paled, he implied, next to the collective reality he witnessed. Theslave status of a child was always that of the mother under American slave law.“This arrangement,” Douglass declared, “admits of the greatest license to brutalslaveholders, and their profligate sons, brothers, relations and friends, andgives to the pleasure of sin, the additional attraction of profit. A wholevolume might be written on this single feature of slavery, as I have observedit.”30 [notes.html#ch1fn_30a]Douglass experienced lasting individual trauma over his roots in this world ofrural, lonely, familial, and violent sexual anguish. Few Americans ever morepublicly and vividly remade themselves over and over quite like Douglass, andfew had deeper reasons to try. Slavery meant to make him a “brute,” Douglasswrote. “But what man has made, man can un-make.”31 [notes.html#ch1fn_31a]If indeed his twenty-year-old mother, still full of flowering beauty, youthfulcharm, and intelligence, had been raped by the power-besotted, sexually derangedfifty-year-old Anthony, Douglass had to find some story, or analysis, in whichto comprehend it as he grew to adulthood. By retrieving his story from memory,he also had to try to dissolve it as he also created it. If he understood thathe had not been conceived in love, then he could never know a father’s love,although he would seek alternative fathers for much of his life. “A man who willenslave his own blood,” he insisted, “may not be safely relied on formagnanimity. Men do not love those who remind them of their sins—unless theyhave a mind to repent—and the mulatto child’s face is a standing accusationagainst him who is master and father to the child.” Douglass wrote about hispaternity with an acute and strategic sense of fatherlessness. Anthony, orwhichever white man pursued Harriet Bailey into her quarters, or in the back ofa kitchen in the dark, produced ultimately an angry Frederick Douglass, whowould find the words to fight back. The extent of slavery’s sexual assault onthe idea of family, Douglass wryly claimed, was beyond the “design of my simplestory.” Hardly. So much racial mixture had emerged from American slavery,Douglass argued, that “if the lineal descendants of Ham are only to be enslaved,according to the scriptures, slavery in this country will soon become anunscriptural institution; for thousands are ushered into the world annually,who—like myself—owe their existence to white fathers, and, most frequently, totheir masters, and masters’ sons.” Douglass knew this element of his story wasold, complex, and, to most, salacious. He told it about as explicitly as hecould. “The thoughtful,” he said, “know the rest.”32 [notes.html#ch1fn_32a]In his abolitionist writings and his oratory, Douglass seldom missed anopportunity to convert his story into ways of defining slavery itself to hisuninformed audiences. The orphan’s anguished story of his roots in Tuckahoe, theparents unknown or vanished, provided the perfect chance to tear out hisreader’s heart as he bared his own: “There is not beneath the sky an enemy tofilial affection so destructive as slavery. It had made my brothers and sistersstrangers to me; it converted my mother who bore me into a myth; it shrouded myfather in mystery, and left me without an intelligible beginning in theworld.”33 [notes.html#ch1fn_33a]But in such cries in the night, he did tell us a good deal of what remainedintelligible in his furtive memory. The “first things” Douglass did actuallyknow and experience were boyhood memories of life at his grandmother’s cabin,the trek to the Wye plantation (the “great house farm”), and his half-naked,half-starved time as a seven- and eight-year-old at Wye, scrounging for morselsof food and affection wherever he could find them. Even deeper, it was from inand around Grandma Betsy’s “log hut . . . built of clay, wood, and straw” thatDouglass, the adult writer, conjured his first memories. His memory flowed withimages of the grandmother’s majestic presence, her “freshly-ironed bandana,” how“esteemed” she was on both sides of the Tuckahoe for her skills in planting andpreserving “seedling sweet potatoes.” As symbol and reality, Douglass gave usthe first great yams in African American literature. Betsy perfected the art ofplacing the root of the potato at just the right depth and position so it wouldendure the winter’s frosts, a talent for which she was recruited all over theregion to assist others, slave and free. Among Douglass’s first things was thewell outside the cabin, where all the children (too many to count and almost allhis cousins) would play, compete, and scheme. And then there was the simple, ifmagical, ladder inside the cabin. For Fred Bailey, the ladder up to a makeshiftloft was one of those childhood objects or images that zipped in and out of hismemory, “a really high invention, and possessed of a sort of charm.”34[notes.html#ch1fn_34a]Eating his quick meals of cornmeal with an oyster shell, dashing to and fro andalways craving his grandmother’s attentions with deep seriousness against thebids of all the other urchins in the yard, and prancing across a cornfield tothe busy mill up toward Hillsboro—these memories allowed Douglass to create aself-portrait of a boy in a state of nature. “Slave children are children,” heinstructed his romantic readers. In his earliest years, he could imagine, he hadbeen a “genuine boy,” running wild at times, “enacting, by turns, all thestrange antics and freaks of horses, dogs, pigs, and barn-door fowls” without“incurring reproach.” This little boy, protected by the seemingly powerfulmatriarch at that bend in the Tuckahoe, could “trot on . . . as happy as anylittle heathen under the palm trees of Africa.”35 [notes.html#ch1fn_35a]Or so the story demanded in his brilliant re-creation of childhood innocencepeculiar to slavery, just before the fall, when befuddling rumors of oldmaster’s absolute power began to invade his euphoria. “Clouds and shadows” beganto descend on him; he was told that Captain Anthony brought all the slavechildren at a certain age to his own homestead. Soon, Douglass kept hearingaround Grandma Bailey’s sanctuary, he would “see sights by and by.”36[notes.html#ch1fn_36a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 2--------------------------------------------------------------------------------A CHILDHOOD OF EXTREMESExtremes meet in mind as in matter.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1855He remembered it as a “beautiful summer morning.” Frederick Bailey’s worldturned upside down on such a morning in 1824. His time had come for removal from“the only home I ever had” (his grandmother Betsy’s cabin), to the Wyeplantation, and Aaron Anthony’s homestead. It would be a day of momentaryadventure, then fear and despair. First, out across fields to Tapper’s Corner,and then on footpaths and through an extended stretch of dense trees called“Lloyds’ long woods,” Betsy Bailey led her grandson by the hand on a twelve-miletrek to his “introduction to the realities of slavery.”1 [notes.html#ch2fn_1a]In memory, Douglass used this turning point in his youth for several purposes.He paid tribute to the grandmother he loved (the only family member he couldremember in any vivid way); she walked over the Talbot County landscape with the“solemnity of a priestess,” her bandanna turban atop her “marvelouslystraight . . . figure, elastic, and muscular.” When the boy tired on his shortlegs, she carried him on her shoulder like a bushel basket. With the customarywriterly detail he had mastered by 1855, he remembered gripping hisgrandmother’s hand tightly, as he imagined some logs and stumps in the darkforest as “wild beasts.”2 [notes.html#ch2fn_2a]Most strikingly, Douglass portrayed this childhood memory as an initiation intothe separation and abandonment at the heart of slavery. For anyone who has everwatched a lone, shy child of six or seven join a band of other children on aplayground, Douglass’s poignant recollections of this episode ring true. As hisgrandmother prepared to leave him forever, she urged him to go play with a groupconsisting, he soon realized, of six of his cousins and his brother and twosisters, Perry, Sarah, and Eliza. Frederick had never met them. “Brothers andsisters we were in blood,” he wrote, “but slavery had made us strangers.” WhileFrederick stood alone against a wall in confusion, one of the children ran upand shouted, “Fed, Fed! grandmammy gone!” As he ran to look for her, he realizedhe had been dropped off in a new future—alone. Heartbroken, he rememberedfalling on the ground as he “wept a boy’s bitter tears.” In this world ofchildren’s logic and compensation, his siblings tried to give him peaches andpears, but Frederick “flung them away” in despair.3 [notes.html#ch2fn_3a]As he widened his lens and found survival his only option, Douglass turned thechildhood recollections of eighteen months on the Wye plantation into a stunningdescription of a slave society in microcosm. It was a place of jarring contrastsand brutal contradictions. The Lloyds’ massive operation was at once a place“three hundred years behind the age, in all that relates to humanity andmorals,” but also a thriving business and agricultural enterprise. It was aplace with all the sounds and wonders of nature, a “scene of almost Eden-likebeauty.” But also, Douglass said, a “dark domain,” where “civilization is shutout,” and the people with the power committed all manner of crimes with “as muchimpunity as upon the deck of a pirate ship.”4 [notes.html#ch2fn_4a] In thisworld of fear and loneliness, but also of endless fascination for a child’sboundless curiosity, Douglass burrowed into his interior imagination and foundhis own ways to be a boy.Historians have made a distinction between “societies with slaves” and “slavesocieties.” In the first, as Ira Berlin has argued, “slaves were marginal to thecentral productive processes,” and the master-slave relationship was not the“exemplar” of life itself. But in a slave society, the master’s authority overhis bondmen defined all social relations, and all economic production dependedintimately on the slaves’ brawn, brains, and compliance. In a slave society,from dawn until dusk, everyone woke, labored, worried about money or hunger,ate, played, competed, loved, hated, married, worshipped God, sang, dreamed, anddied in a world shaped at every turn by slavery, a system in America Douglassonce defined succinctly as “the granting of that power by which one manexercises and enforces the right of property in the body and soul of another.”5[notes.html#ch2fn_5a]The great Wye plantation was all about property. Douglass’s memories of theplace were one of the deepest roots of his evolving identity, and eventually ofhis abolitionism. His rich descriptions of the “Great House Farm” depict a worldof both absurdity and joy, of heroic human striving and of inhumane exploitationand violence. It had a marvel of a windmill to fan a child’s imagination, aswell as too many frustrated and depraved adults of both races wielding whipswith impunity. The plantation seemed a place of permanence with no way out, butit also provided striking, constant views of a wide river with sloops and othersailing boats gliding by on the way to a bay called the Chesapeake and to a citycalled Baltimore. It had beautiful birds perched in the top of poplar trees anda scary, haunted graveyard that seemed ancient to the child’s eyes.6[notes.html#ch2fn_6a]Image [../images/f0021-01.jpg]Wye House farm, c. 1930.Although surrounded by people, animals, and bustling activity, Frederick waslonely and made no close friends among the younger slaves. He did, however,become close companions with twelve-year-old Daniel Lloyd, son of the patriarchof the plantation. Daniel apparently took a liking to Frederick’s intelligenceand precociousness. “Mas’ Daniel” treated Frederick as both servant andplaymate. They shared secrets and explored the estate together. They mimickedeach other’s dialects, and Douglass’s testing of his wits and tongue againstDaniel’s was perhaps the slave boy’s first imaginative experience with thewonders of language. He and Daniel may have also shared a good deal ofknowledge. “The equality of nature is strongly asserted in childhood,” Douglassmaintained. Daniel “could not give his black playmates his company, withoutgiving them his intelligence, as well.” A full-time tutor from New Englandtaught the Lloyd children in a special room to the left of the front portico ofthe mansion. That room had its own door opening outside, and some days Frederickwaited in the front driveway, as inconspicuously as possible, for Daniel tofinish his lessons. This may be where the future Frederick Douglass first sensedthe power of what went on in the schoolrooms he could never enter.7[notes.html#ch2fn_7a]Throughout his life, especially in early adulthood, Douglass displayed aremarkable, hustler’s ability to learn—to take and refashion useful knowledge tohis own ends—from those around him. He began cultivating this survivor’s skillat least as early as his romps about the Wye plantation with Daniel Lloyd. Inafternoon competitive repartee, the future Douglass may have first experimentedwith the magic of words and unwittingly wielded the tools by which he wouldinvent his life.The Lloyds were perhaps the richest family in Maryland and a slaveholdingdynasty. The Georgian Wye mansion that Douglass knew, and which still stands infull glory, was built by Edward Lloyd IV in about 1785. His son, Edward Lloyd V,long called Governor Lloyd, Douglass knew from a distance. By the 1820s thecombined Lloyd operations had transformed into one of the largest producers ofwheat in the United States, as well as a source of massive quantities of cornand pork. Huge flocks of sheep grazed the meadows, the stables were full ofsaddle and racing horses (a special passion of Lloyd’s), and there was plenty ofacreage for a private deer park. A beautiful eighty-five-foot-longFrench-provincial orangery, still standing today, with a gentlemen’s billiardsroom on the second floor, graced the property a hundred yards or so behind themansion. On the rear of that stunning structure were some attached slaveapartments, likely for gardeners, their dark interiors today underarchaeological investigation as they provide a sobering, eye-stopping contrastto the beautiful exterior surroundings. The long, regular slave-quarterbuildings were a considerable distance from the main house and largely out ofsight to any of the droves of visitors who came for the Lloyds’ ostentatiousmidafternoon dinner soirees. Lloyd’s wealth, said Douglass in his Narrative, was“almost equal to . . . the riches of Job.”8 [notes.html#ch2fn_8a]Edward Lloyd V was elected governor of Maryland three times and also served inthe US Congress. He was as socially well connected as anyone in the Chesapeakeregion. Little Frederick would try to peer from a distance—or might hear talesfrom Daniel—when as many as two dozen overdressed guests would come for thefeasts. Douglass described this “community” of whites and blacks and slaves andfree people as a status-ridden universe. Essentially three families resided atthe Wye plantation. He was part of the “kitchen family,” consisting of somedozen black children under the tyrannical rule of Aunt Katy. The “house family”was Aaron Anthony’s nuclear family, including his two sons and daughter,Lucretia, who married Thomas Auld, the captain of Colonel Lloyd’s sloop. TheAulds would soon play a crucial role in Frederick’s life. Finally, there werethe “sacred precincts of the great house,” including the Lloyds of course, wholived in splendor, groaning under the weight of their “blood-bought luxuries.”But the great house also included the Lloyds’ fifteen house servants, attired infine clothing, selected for their faithfulness and personal appearance. Thisplantation “black aristocracy,” as Douglass called them, were as remote from himas Colonel Lloyd himself. The house servants “resembled the fieldhands innothing, except in color.” It was as though they resided on another planet a fewhundred yards away from overseer Captain Anthony’s yard. Wearing fine “silks”and “fanning . . . breezes toward the over-heated brows of the alabasterladies,” these servants did not even know any of the “sorrow and hunger-smittenmultitudes of the quarter and the field.”9 [notes.html#ch2fn_9a]Douglass later wrote about this childhood world of beauty and evil, of decadenceand mass production, as both his playground and his “prison.” He did so withastonishing detail, almost all the basics of which can be verified: overseers’names, and many of their terrible deeds of violence; how the field hands’ basicfood, the ashcake, was baked—“this peculiar bread . . . covered with ashes, tothe depth of a sixteenth part of an inch”; and how a whip was made “entirely ofuntanned, but dried, ox hide” and “painted red, blue, and green,” before beingused on slaves’ naked backs. Young Frederick loved horses and the stables, andwhen allowed, he would hang around them. The stables were run by the father andson pair of slaves Young Barney and Old Barney. Any given day might find thehalf-naked, barefoot boy in his sackcloth shirt dodging in and out of stalls,gazing at the huge thoroughbreds, admiring with awe the “splendid carriages,soft within and lustrous without.” Here Frederick observed the fine functions ofsaddles and harnesses, and the “gigs, phaetons, barouches, sulkeys, andsleighs.”10 [notes.html#ch2fn_10a]Douglass possessed an extraordinary memory and cultivated it endlessly as awriter. By all accounts, and from the evidence of some of his specialprivileges, the youthful Frederick Bailey was remarkably bright, his powers ofobservation active and acute; he impressed those around him as smart and curiousbeyond his years. The detail of his autobiographies can to some extent beattributed to such sheer intelligence. But other factors were surely asimportant in his talent for recall. Eventually, the fugitive-slave Douglass of1845 at age twenty-seven, as well as the more politically mature and famousDouglass of 1855 at age thirty-seven, knew he needed veracity for his story tobe creditable in a world that doubted any literary acumen and, for that matter,basic intelligence in blacks. Even more, from his first moments as a speaker inhis early twenties, a mere two or three years out of slavery, Douglass rehearsedover and over the stories he would eventually write up in the Narrative andrevise in Bondage and Freedom. Memory is a mysterious and infinitely powerfulhuman device, what Saint Augustine called “a deep and boundless manifoldness”and the “treasury” in the mind. With enough prompts and associations, a greatdeal of childhood memory, both difficult and pleasing, can be retrieved as it isrefashioned. Douglass made as well as received his own story from memory; hesummoned it with both private and public repetition for an audience he knew hehad to persuade. “Self-making is, after all,” writes the legal scholar ofautobiography Jerome Bruner, “our principal means of establishing our ownuniqueness.”11 [notes.html#ch2fn_11a] And Douglass had the deepest of reasons todeclare his uniqueness.In Bondage and Freedom in 1855, Douglass disingenuously declares, “Let othersphilosophize; it is my province here to relate and describe; only allowingmyself a word or two . . . to assist the reader in the proper understanding ofthe facts narrated.”12 [notes.html#ch2fn_12a] Hardly. Douglass’s representationof his early life as a slave is a thoroughgoing abolitionist manifesto, apenetrating portrait of the inner and exterior worlds of both slaves andslaveholders. And he may, indeed, have seen or certainly heard a good deal aboutall that he wrote. An ashcake may be an ashcake, but the blood that flows inwhat he called his “chapter of horrors” is full of philosophy as well aspsychology.Including the beating of his aunt Hester, Douglass had either witnessed orlearned about from hearsay at least seven brutal whippings or murders by thetime he was eight. This does not include the casual violence he saw fromoverseers, from the wretched Aunt Katy around the kitchen, or from his firstinstructor in religious devotions, a slave named Doctor Isaac Copper, whomDouglass turned into a “tragic and comic” character in his autobiography. Copperwas a cripple, who with hickory switch in hand forced groups of children tolearn the Lord’s Prayer, as he also whacked them with his whip. “Everybody inthe south,” wrote Douglass, “wants the privilege of whipping somebody else.Uncle Isaac shared the common passion of his country.” Shortly after memorizing“Our Father who are in heaven,” Douglass quickly became a “truant” from Copper’sdevotions.13 [notes.html#ch2fn_13a] Details flowed in Douglass’s recollections,emanating from pain and adventure tucked away in the secret garden of hismemory. His great indictment of slavery came first and foremost from theaccumulated injury of his own story.Douglass made a careful study of the range of overseers he had known, from thesadistic to the reluctant to those who enacted violence as mere policy in theslave system. His master, Anthony, seemed to be the company man enforcingpolicy, except when sexually scorned; then he joined the darkest side. A JamesHopkins seemed “as good as any man can be, and still be an overseer”; he whippedslaves with open discomfort. But under Anthony’s general command were two otheroverseers, William Sevier (pronounced Severe) and Orson Gore (Douglassmistakenly identifies him as Austin Gore). These were not names invented by anovelist but real, hardened, paid accessories to slavery’s crimes on the Wyeplantation. One day near the slave quarters, Frederick heard noise andscreaming. As he sauntered over to the scene, he witnessed Nelly Kellem, a tall,strong slave woman, being wrestled and dragged toward a tree by Sevier. Nellygave as good as she got in this fight, clawing Sevier’s face with her nails andhitting him as hard as he hit her. According to Douglass, three of Nelly’s fivechildren witnessed this bloody fracas, as Sevier finally subdued Nelly and ropedher to a tree. As the children screamed, “Let my mammy go!,” Sevier shouted foulcurses and, like a “savage bulldog,” beat Nelly to a bloody pulp, while thewoman took the blows with fierce and indignant courage. As Douglass wrote ofthis event years later, he implied that the worst part for him was not Nelly’s“back . . . covered with blood,” but her screams “mingled with those of thechildren.”14 [notes.html#ch2fn_14a]Such was young Frederick’s prolonged initiation into the world of humanrelationships, to notions of fairness and morality, of crime and punishment, offamilial bonds and fissures. Overseers were the law enforcers and the courts.Nelly’s offense that led to her bloody beating in front of her traumatizedchildren was the ubiquitous slave crime of “impudence.” The moral Douglass theabolitionist drew from the story was that Nelly—as a woman—had stood her groundas long as she could. She left the ugly Sevier scarred in his already deformedface. Her bravery, something Douglass would later claim for himself, proved thedoctrine he invoked with excessive bravado: “He is whipped oftenest, who iswhipped easiest.”15 [notes.html#ch2fn_15a] That stirring statement, while manlyand inspiring, has the air of smugness, offered from a safer position as authorof his memoir many years after watching the slaves on the Wye estate live withthe frightening daily grind of comprehending just who could muster such courageto resist and who could not. He could hardly offer us, or himself, any sense ofwhat the bleeding Nelly told her sickened children that evening in the quarters.Fighting back was noble and possible; but Douglass also left the distinctimpression that in the daily experience of Eastern Shore slavery even a childbegan to understand that sanity itself, as well as physical survival, might beat stake.Douglass’s litany of experiences with violence went even further; he analyzedthe overseers as a “distinct class of southern society.” Gore served as theprototype of the cold and calculated tyrant who could instill fear in slaves. Heoperated not with “disgusting swagger and noisy bravado,” but with grave and“calm self-possession.” Gore worked by reputation and action; his power wasabsolute and his method intimidation. He never allowed a slave even to answerback to his orders. Gore worked by the maxim, said Douglass, “that it is betterthat a dozen slaves suffer under the lash, without fault, than that the masteror overseer should seem to have been wrong in the presence of the slave.” Gore’swords were few but shrill, and the result was “sensations of terror among theslaves.” “I shunned him,” wrote Douglass, “as I would have shunned arattlesnake.” He was still young enough to get away with such avoidance. InDouglass’s portrayal, Gore seemed destined for his calling, the perfect creationof slavery itself, the ideal “chief of a band of pirates.”16[notes.html#ch2fn_16a] Gore seemed the perfect colonel in slavery’s sick-minded,evil army patrolling the police state.A twenty-year-old, robust slave named Bill Denby got into a scrape with Gore. InDouglass’s telling of the episode, after a few lashes Denby ran and plunged intoa creek, with the water up to his neck. Gore stood on the bank with a shotgun onhis shoulder. He gave Denby to a count of three to come out of the water. Thebelligerent, heroic young man refused, and Gore shot him at point-blank range inthe face. Although Douglass admittedly did not witness this killing, he heardabout it all over the quarters and wrote about it in dramatic terms: “In aninstant, poor Denby was numbered with the dead. His mangled body sank out ofsight, and only his warm, red blood marked the place where he had stood.”17[notes.html#ch2fn_17a] Gore apparently made his case for a necessary killing toColonel Lloyd, who gave his approval; no judicial inquiry occurred. Douglassused this case to show that the murder of slaves in Maryland not only remainedlegal and went unpunished, but that it stood as the terrifying symbol of asociety of amoral lawlessness. At the heart of Douglass’s autobiographies wasthe idea that slavery attempted to crush all semblance of natural rights for itsvictims. A society that sanctioned cold-blooded murder and fostered homicidalmadness as necessary steps to social order could only be called by itsnames—piracy and tyranny. Douglass’s later, prolific appeals to thenatural-rights tradition, and even to the right of revolution, should be firstconsidered in light of these compelling, damaging childhood memories of suchcruelty.Colonel Lloyd himself, the owner of the great pirate ship, employer of the“chief pirate” (Gore) in control of the captive deckhands, was hardly aboveemploying the whip. At the stables at the Wye plantation, Douglass observed, “ahorse was seldom brought out . . . to which no objection could be raised” byeither Lloyd himself or by his sons and sons-in-law. Old Barney, the head groomand stableman, had to endure these barbs and humiliations. One day, ColonelLloyd was especially displeased with the appearance of one of his riding horsesand took it out on Old Barney. Lloyd ordered the “bald and toil-worn” man tokneel on the ground and laid “thirty lashes with a horse whip” on his bareshoulders. Barney “bore it patiently, to the last, answering each blow with aslight shrug of the shoulders, and a groan.” This incident especially shockedDouglass, not it appears for the blood drawn, but for the unspeakablehumiliation of an old man of dignity and talent by the master himself. Thebeating of Barney, said Douglass, revealed slavery in its “maturity of repulsivehatefulness.”18 [notes.html#ch2fn_18a] In a child’s eyes, and memories,something sick, frightful, or evil seemed to lurk around the corner of everybuilding, in the sounds of every overseer’s steps at the Wye enterprise. Longafter he had left the Eastern Shore behind, such a prospect haunted Douglass.• • •“Such is the constitution of the human mind,” Douglass wrote in 1855 whiletrying to capture his mentality as an eight- and nine-year-old on the Wyeplantation, “that, when pressed to extremes, it often avails itself of the mostopposite ends. Extremes meet in mind as in matter.” With a probity unmatched byany other slave-narrative author, he remembered and analyzed a world of starkopposites, all but unalterable extremes that he had to learn to understand,navigate, and survive.19 [notes.html#ch2fn_19a] As his awareness of hispredicament grew, Frederick became a thinking being trying desperately topreserve and protect his mind as well as his body from internal disintegrationand external destruction. At every turn in his life as a slave, both mind andbody were in constant danger. His mind, he learned, he could cultivate andprotect more easily, with more self-control.Douglass’s experiences began to shape a disposition, a set of habits of mind, apersonality that may have lasted all of his life. He was forever in search of asense of “home,” a concept he dwelled on at length in the autobiographies. Hewas capable of great love and compassion, but perhaps even more desperately inneed of receiving love and compassion long into adulthood. He experienced greatdifficulty trusting other people, even those who seemed to be friends. Withmixed results, he sought time and again to find parental figures in whom toinvest his faith and from whom to garner emotional sustenance. And his was achildhood, he admitted, blessed with several turns of good fortune altogetheruncommon to slaves, while at the same time we should not doubt that he carriedwith him from his youth a profound sense of rage against the violence anddegradation he both witnessed and experienced. If a slave was thoughtful anddreamed of something better, Douglass believed, he must endure these extremes.As autobiographer, he ultimately imposed a rather romantic, individualisticself-made hero on his readers. But crafty and guarded as a writer, henevertheless revealed a childhood laden with the traumas unique to slavery.Those traumas were a kind of emotional furniture in his psyche; he would forevertry to control and rearrange them, but he could never fully expunge them. Thatemotional furniture may have darkened his outlook, but it also provided thewellspring of his great personal story. Douglass made “the nature and history ofslavery” his youthful “inquiry,” he maintained. We are led as his readers on thejourney of an evolving, brilliant mind’s bitter questioning of all around him.“Why am I a slave?” he asked so innocently in Bondage and Freedom. “Why are somepeople slaves, and others masters?” he demanded to know, as though representinga child’s voice. This “subject of my study . . . was with me in the woods andfields; along the shore of the river, and wherever my boyish wanderings ledme.”20 [notes.html#ch2fn_20a]Douglass was lucky to enjoy any boyish wanderings as a slave. As autobiographer,he sometimes portrayed himself as just out of the frame of the picture,observing, studying, accumulating the knowledge that might not only free him,but also persuade his audience of the merits of the antislavery cause.21[notes.html#ch2fn_21a] Long before the age of psychology, Douglass provided aportrait of a young slave conducting psychological warfare against slavery, asthat system conspired in every way to ensnare, weaken, and ultimately destroyhim. His powers of recollection, fashioned beautifully into words, became hisonly available weapon. In words, Douglass always fought back not only to defeatslavery, but to make sense of its extremes and work through his pain. “Why am Islave?” is an existential question that reflects as well as anticipates manyothers like it in human history. Why am I poor? Why is he so rich, and she onlyhis servant or chattel? Why am I hated for my religion, my race, my sexuality,the accident of my birth in this valley or on that side of the river or on thisside of the railroad tracks? Why am I a refugee with no home? Why does my colordefine my life? Douglass’s story represents so many others over the ages.Douglass wanted us to believe that as a child he gained inner strength andself-knowledge from his sufferings. With caution because of his skilled literaryinvention, we ought not doubt most of what he claimed as an amateur childpsychologist. Every student of Douglass tries to discern what in his memoirist’svoice was real (factual?) and what was literary, often a false separation. Butthe two were almost always mixed for this gifted artist. As we consider thefollowing remarkable passages, who would contest his comprehension of a child’sunderstanding of justice and injustice? “As I grew older and more thoughtful,”he wrote from the perspective of 1855, “I was more and more filled with a senseof my wretchedness.” All the “cruelty . . . wrong and outrage” he witnessed orlearned from others “led me,” he said, “when yet but eight or nine years old, towish I had never been born. I used to contrast my condition with theblack-birds, in whose wild and sweet songs I fancied them so happy! Theirapparent joy only deepened the shades of my sorrow.” Then he tried to rememberhow a child’s innocent imagination encounters the raw unfairness of the worldand the essential venality of humankind. “There are thoughtful days,” Douglassasserted, “in the lives of children—at least there were in mine—when theygrapple with all the great, primary subjects of knowledge, and reach, in amoment, conclusions which no subsequent experience can shake. I was just as wellaware of the unjust, unnatural and murderous character of slavery, when nineyears old, as I am now. Without any appeal to books, to laws, or to authoritiesof any kind, it was enough to accept God as a father, to regard slavery as acrime.”22 [notes.html#ch2fn_22a] There is no reason to doubt such an adultobservation about a child’s instincts. For this young slave the singingblackbirds did not lie.Douglass’s world of extremes flowed from his memory in sheer description as wellas in metaphors of explanation. Most of the time he kept himself squarely withinthe frame of his canvas. He identified hunger and cold as his primary sufferingsat the Wye plantation. He spent every day “almost in a state of nudity,” wearinghis “tow-linen” hanging down to his knees. He stayed on “the sunny side of thehouse” or in “the corner of the kitchen chimney” in winter to find warmth. Atthe Anthony house, the slave children, “like so many pigs,” ate cornmeal mushout of a “large wooden tray, or trough,” laid down on the floor of the kitchenor on the ground outdoors. An oyster shell was the only fork or spoon he knewuntil he moved to Baltimore. He slept in a closet, he tells us, and in extremecold he would steal a bag used for carrying corn to the mill and, with “head inand feet out,” fitfully sleep on January and February nights. There were no bedsor blankets for the slave children.23 [notes.html#ch2fn_23a]Image [../images/f0030-01.jpg]Aerial view of the Wye House plantation, c. 1930.We must imagine Douglass the twenty-seven-year-old writer, sitting at a desk inhis small, crowded apartment in Lynn, Massachusetts, in the winter of 1844–45,drafting his first autobiography. As he recollected these physical hardships ofhis childhood, his feet presumably warm enough, Douglass mingled past andpresent and announced his suffering and his literacy in one unforgettablemetaphor: “My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with whichI am writing might be laid in the gashes.”24 [notes.html#ch2fn_24a] Memory isalmost always a combination of retrieval and invention. The corn sack, a child’sfrozen feet, and the pen of an adult writer as a kind of medicinal weapon tocure the gashes in his feet and in his psyche helped Douglass explain themeaning of being a child slave.Before he parted ways with Wye, Douglass did make what he referred to as “twofriends.” One was Daniel Lloyd, to whom he had been designated as playmate andcompanion. But more important, he was fortunate that Lucretia Auld took a likingto him. Around the Anthony household, with “so much that was harsh,” Douglasscharacterized “Miss Lucretia” (Anthony’s daughter and wife of Thomas Auld) asthe first white woman who ever bestowed “the slightest word or look of kindness”upon him. She treated his wounds when he suffered a gash in his forehead in afight with another boy. She took him “into the parlor,” a room he had likelynever entered, and quietly wiped the blood from his face and applied balsam andwhite linen to his head. That tender act is the first Douglass remembered fromany white person. Lucretia may have “pitied me, if she did not love me,”Douglass remembered. But he imagined and converted it into the love he socraved. She would occasionally give him extra bread, which led the boy tofrequently linger, like the hungry dog or cat, beneath her backyard window. Hetransformed this tenderness into a formal sentence that speaks volumes about hisdeepest childhood needs: “When pretty severely pinched by hunger, I had thehabit of singing, which the good lady very soon came to understand as a petitionfor a piece of bread. . . . I got well paid for my music.”25[notes.html#ch2fn_25a] Douglass does not recount what tunes or words he sang.But in these simple remembrances we see the boy who so yearned for love, forbelonging, for an adult’s embrace, even if it came only in the form of bread anda smile bought for the price of a child’s song.Douglass likely heard far more music than he ever sang at the Wye plantation,and on that subject he left some of his most compelling and complexremembrances. In so doing he exposed those extremes about which he could notstop thinking. On “allowance day” at the “Great House Farm,” when designatedslaves from all over the far-flung plantation came to the Wye House for theirgroup’s allotted monthly provisions, one might have witnessed a spectacle inwhich the “peculiarly excited and noisy” slaves gathered for social and musicalcommunion. “While on their way,” wrote Douglass, “they would make the dense oldwoods, for miles around, reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at oncethe highest joy and the deepest sadness.” Douglass’s recollection of thesedemonstrations of material need and slave culture was both festive and somber.In groups, the Wye slaves “would compose and sing as they went along, consultingneither time nor tune. The thought that came up came out—if not in word, in thesound. . . . They would sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the mostrapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone.”26[notes.html#ch2fn_26a] Embedded in Douglass’s memory was the slaves’ mixedmusical tradition of moans, rhythmic body movement, and improvised lyricsfashioned for specific moments as well as for their visions of eternity. For along time, he remained both mystified and affected by that music, by the abidingstories he heard especially in their “tone.”Slaves on plantations could not own much of anything—land, tools, the clothes ontheir bodies, even their own children or their sense of a future. But they couldat times and under certain circumstances own the sounds and rhythms, themelodies and lyrics, in the air as the great slave-driven machine of the Wyeplantation refueled for the next month’s production. In his vivid childhoodmemories Douglass felt both within and apart from the creation and the meaningof the songs. One gets the impression that the lonely boy may have been bothscared by the collective power of the songs and strangely thrilled to be part ofthe community performing them. Douglass thought that hearing these songs might“do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, than thereading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject.” In the originalNarrative of 1845 he fashioned a stunning memory of which he was so proud thathe simply reprinted it in quotation marks with slight revision in the 1855autobiography:I did not when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and apparentlyincoherent songs. . . . They were tones loud, long, and deep; they breathed theprayer and complaint of souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish. Thehearing of those wild notes always depressed my spirits, and filled me withineffable sadness. The mere recurrence, even now, afflicts my spirit, and whileI am writing these lines, my tears are falling. To those songs I trace my firstglimmering conceptions of the dehumanizing character of slavery. . . . Thosesongs still follow me, to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathiesfor my brethren in bonds. If anyone wishes to be impressed with the soul-killingpower of slavery, let him go to Col. Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance day,place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence,thoughtfully analyze the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of hissoul.27 [notes.html#ch2fn_27a]In this combination of childhood memory and antislavery propaganda, Douglassopened a wide window into his youth as a slave.In his appeal to “analyze the sounds,” it was as if Douglass left an invitationto modern historians of slavery, to anthropologists and folklorists, as well asto the readers of slave narratives in his own time, to try to time-travel withhim to the pine woods around the great oval driveway of the Wye House to hearthe true meaning of slavery. It was as though he believed that some part of theinjustice of enslavement could not be fully described or explained and mightonly be grasped—felt—at the level of spirituality, in the “chambers” of the“soul.” The songs still followed him into his adult, public life, he maintained,depressing but also quickening his spirit. Whether they sang about work and itsrhythms, about the God welcomed into every aspect of daily life, about theirmasters or their intimate companions, or about animals through which they mightimagine their own travail, slaves, Douglass argued, gave voice to their sorrow,not their contentment. “Sorrow and desolation have their songs,” wrote Douglass,“as well as joy and peace. Slaves sing more to make themselves happy, than toexpress their happiness.”28 [notes.html#ch2fn_28a] Absolution, redemption,survival? Slave songs were made out of the stuff of oppression, not merely foundor anticipated in the hereafter. A boy could learn a lot on allowance day.Whether in the form of moans or shouts, in spontaneous lyrics, or in the stanzasand refrains of a spiritual, slaves were always making their own balm in Gilead.But in Douglass’s memory, as he represented his fellow slaves’ prayer andcomplaint, it was as though, by then a deep reader of the Old Testament, hechose Jeremiah’s original lament over the more famous spiritual’s declaration offaithful certainty. In the song, “there is a balm in Gilead / to make thewounded whole.” But Jeremiah had left an unanswered question: “Is there no balmin Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then is there no healing for thewound of my people?” In song, as Douglass seemed to grasp, slaves fashioned someelement of spiritual or psychological certainty in a temporal world thatprovided none for them. A slave child needed to believe in something.29[notes.html#ch2fn_29a]As an adult writer Douglass harbored much ambivalence about the sorrow and lossin those slave songs. When he would remember his days of plotting resistance andescape with his fellow band of disgruntled slaves as he grew toward adulthood,the songs somehow became more coherent, if still full of duality. The songs,Douglass said, “were mostly of a plaintive cast,” but might also break into “allmanner of joyful noises.” And later, he seemed richly aware of an insightadvanced by modern scholars of the slave songs: that the sacred and the secularmingled in a single worldview among American slaves. Douglass understood thatthe dehumanizing character of slavery had to be answered, tamed, and controlledby the weapon of words, in the music of song, or of oratory.30[notes.html#ch2fn_30a] He struggled mightily to embrace confidence aboutlanguage itself, whether in prose, or in the tone surrounding a song’srevisiting of an Old Testament metaphor.This Douglass came to grasp in remembrance of his later teenage years, andbeyond. He used musical lyrics to capture the emotional meaning of his failedescape plans. He and his band of brothers, imagining their way out onto theChesapeake and a watery liberation, could be “remarkably buoyant,” he declared,“singing hymns and making joyous exclamations, almost as triumphant in theirtone as if we had reached a land of freedom and safety.” Then he remembered aspecific song: “A keen observer might have detected in our repeated singing of‘O Canaan, sweet Canaan, / I am bound for the land of Canaan,’ something morethan a hope of reaching heaven. We meant to reach the north—and the north wasour Canaan.” Douglass recalled yet more lyrics in which to embed his story ofdetermined, if unsuccessful, escape. A “favorite air” laced with “doublemeaning,” went:I thought I heard them say,There were lions in the way,I don’t expect to stayMuch longer here.Run to Jesus—shun the danger—I don’t expect to stayMuch longer here.31 [notes.html#ch2fn_31a]As a nine-year-old about to experience the first great lucky break of his life,Douglass did not yet understand how to analyze the sounds that had penetratedhis boyhood soul. In Baltimore, he would learn a new kind of music, and a newkind of slavery."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 3--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE SILVER TRUMP OF KNOWLEDGEEducation and Slavery were incompatible with each other.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1845On a spring day in March 1826, Lucretia Auld gave Frederick Bailey the goodnews: he was to be sent to Baltimore in just three days to live with the familyof Hugh Auld, Thomas’s brother, and to be the boyhood companion for Tommy Auld,Hugh’s son. Big changes were afoot for all of Aaron Anthony’s slaves. Old Masterwas ill and aging, his house soon to be taken over by a new head overseer; theblacks had to be redistributed to other places in the Lloyd empire, hired out,or perhaps even sold. Frederick was lucky, and Lucretia was happy for him; shepromised him his first pair of trousers if he would thoroughly clean himselfbefore traveling to the city. Douglass reports that he spent most of the nextthree days in the creek scrubbing the “plantation scurf” and the “mange (as pigdrovers would call it)” off his body. The boy was sleepless with excitement,“working for the first time in the hope of reward.”1 [notes.html#ch3fn_1a]A boy might have been frightened by this prospect of such a drastic change inhis familiar surroundings. But not Frederick. He remembered no dread and onlyexhilaration at seeing the Baltimore he had heard so much about from an oldercousin who worked on the Sally Lloyd, Colonel Lloyd’s sloop, and had come backwith so many magical stories about ships, buildings, soldiers, and markets inthe city. Frederick had no real family to leave behind—no parents to miss, andhis brother and sisters were but strangers to him. He suddenly felt liberatedfrom a future at the Wye plantation of little more than “hardship, whipping, andnakedness.” He remembered the day as a Saturday, since he had no knowledge yetof months; with pride in his new trousers, Douglass, sharing the deck with aflock of sheep, boarded the Sally Lloyd on what was likely March 18, 1826, forthe journey to Baltimore. Ever giving his boyhood a narrative and a meaning,Douglass remembered himself the excited eight-year-old boy, stepping on theboat, as he “gave to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation what I hoped would be the lastlook.” Then he moved to the bow of the sloop and “spent the remainder of the dayin looking ahead.” This would not by any measure be the final time he would seethe Wye plantation. He would come back again in both helpless fear and personaltriumph. Talbot County and the Eastern Shore would forever be the deepestwellspring of his fertile memory. But at this juncture, no one could imagine howthe history of the Chesapeake region, as well as that of the entire nation,would change in no small measure because this fresh-faced orphaned slave boyrode a boat to Baltimore that day in 1826.2 [notes.html#ch3fn_2a]The sloop traversed Chesapeake Bay, which to Frederick, “opened like a shorelessocean.” It went into port first at Annapolis, where during a brief stay the boywas not allowed ashore; he did, however, see the dome of the statehouse ofMaryland’s capital. Since it was the first city he had ever seen, he rememberedhis youthful reaction as something like “travelers at the first view of Rome.”Then on Sunday morning they arrived in Baltimore harbor. Frederick Bailey lookedin awe as he saw two- and three-masted sailing ships, steamers, church spires,and four- and five-story buildings and warehouses. They landed at Smith’s Wharf,near Gardiner’s Shipyard, in Fell’s Point, just southeast of the Inner Harbor.Since the 1760s, Fell’s Point had been a hive of taverns and boardinghouses, aswell as a growing center for the building and fitting out of oceangoing ships.In 1793, a French fleet overloaded with colonists escaping the slave rebellionin Saint Domingue (Haiti) arrived in the harbor. Among them was a ship’scarpenter, Joseph Despeaux, and a contingent of Haitian slaves. With hisworkers, Despeaux founded Fell’s Point’s first shipyard, where soon they wereconstructing the famous Baltimore clipper ships, the fastest ocean craftsafloat.3 [notes.html#ch3fn_3a]One of the sloop hands guided Frederick to the home of Hugh and Sophia Auld onAliceanna Street (he remembered it as “Alliciana” Street), just a few blocks upfrom the harbor. He had arrived in one of most thriving and growing port citiesin North America. It was one of the largest trading centers in the United Statesfor tobacco, wheat, flour, and even coffee. Its shipbuilding industry wasbooming, and just a few months after his arrival, on July 4, 1826, thecornerstone was laid for the soon-to-be-famous Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (theB&O), which would link the Atlantic Ocean with the Mississippi River. The cityhad a population of nearly eighty thousand people, composed of approximatelysixty thousand whites, four thousand black slaves, and more than fourteenthousand free blacks. Baltimore had the largest concentration of free persons ofcolor in the United States, a demographic fact that would play a key role inDouglass’s fate. The city proudly announced its civic consciousness in buildingmajor monuments; in October 1829, Frederick would have witnessed, at least froma distance, the unveiling of the massive Washington Monument, a 280-foot-highstructure, with a 24-foot-high base and the first president’s statue on top ofthe obelisk. The year of his arrival the first of three shot towers was erected,the massive stone structures in which shot was produced by dropping molten leadfrom the top to water tanks below.4 [notes.html#ch3fn_4a] This was a new visual,technological, and human universe for young Frederick. Here was a city withgreat churches, squares, and a skyline, and, to a boy from a plantation on theother side of the bay, an endless panorama for his senses and his imagination.Douglass portrayed himself as the country bumpkin arriving in the big city. Hefelt the strange brick pavement under his feet, which would be so hot in summerheat, gazed at the buildings, and was especially struck at the noise, the“startling sounds reaching my ears from all directions.” The boy felt “strangeobjects glaring upon me at every step” and raw fear. His chief trouble was theroving “troops of hostile boys ready to pounce upon me at every street corner.”They chased him for sport and called him an “Eastern Shore Man.” Thus facing astreet hazing, a Fell’s Point initiation that he called his “moral acclimation,”Frederick learned that life had given him a break as it also thrust him into theunknown. He had arrived in an urban environment with slaves but not really a“slave city.” Baltimore was undergoing a massive European immigration (130,000arrived between 1820 and 1850), and those Fell’s Point streets were full ofIrish and German boys marking their territories. The port and the shipyards werebooming; carpenters, caulkers, sailors, and dockworkers of all kindscompetitively and jealously protected their livelihoods. The city broiled withvolatile politics, sometimes led by firehouse organizations and their politicalclubs and gangs. Outbreaks of rioting and political violence were common. Theships continued to be built to make the future of a great seaport; the wheattrade boomed and a textile industry thrived in making clothing and ship’s sails.But the labor for this great expansion was largely white, and the slavepopulation was dwindling (from 4,357 in 1820 to 3,212 in 1840) as the free blackcommunity grew in numbers (from 10,326 in 1820 to 17,980 in 1840), if not inhuman rights.5 [notes.html#ch3fn_5a]But Douglass, still numbered among the slaves, was someone’s property with amind and body growing almost beyond the system’s capacity to contain him. Notlong after Frederick’s arrival, the Aulds moved a few blocks south, to a houseon Philpot Street, as close as one could live to the shipyards, where Hugh wasan aspiring shipbuilder. At the Aulds’ house, Frederick met a white family whoat first took him in like a relative. To his astonishment and joy, SophiaAuld—Hugh’s wife—displayed “the kindliest emotions” in her face, and her tenderdemeanor toward the boy put him in a world he had never known from white people.And he hit it off immediately with “Little Tommy,” of whom “his Freddy,” as“Miss Sophia” put it, was to “take care.” Surrounded by all this dreamlikeaffection, Frederick remembered his emotions: “I had already fallen in love withthe dear boy; and with these little ceremonies I was initiated into my new home,and entered upon my peculiar duties.”6 [notes.html#ch3fn_6a] Compared to all hisprevious experience it was a home and would remain so for several years; but itwould also be a place for learning stern lessons for life, as well as to findand savor the one possession that might save his life.For nearly his first two years with the Aulds, Sophia treated him “more akin toa mother than a slaveholding mistress.” Indeed, as Douglass pointed out, SophiaAuld had never been a slaveholder before his arrival. She allowed him to feellike a “half-brother” to Tommy. She was pious, attended church regularly, andexuded kindness toward the black boy who was now turning ten or eleven yearsold. She was Douglass’s humane “law-giver,” he said, and such sweetness made him“more sensitive to good and ill treatment.” Living on carpets, sleeping in agood straw bed, eating good bread, and wearing clean clothes did not hurteither. But the great gift she gave him was literacy. In 1845 Douglassrecollected simply that Sophia had of her own accord taught him his ABCs as wellas his first lessons in spelling. But by 1855 he remembered it a littledifferently. By then it was part of his “plan,” and after repeatedly hearing herread aloud from the Bible, he frankly asked her to teach him to read. Eitherway, Sophia was proud of her pupil, and Frederick was an extraordinarily eagerlearner.7 [notes.html#ch3fn_7a]In the sordid history of American slavery, few images are more powerfully ironicthan that of Sophia Auld reading in what Douglass described as a “voice oftranquil music” while the slave boy lay asleep under a table near her feet. In ascene he retold in speeches, but not in the autobiographies, he remembered firsthearing her read from the book of Job. She “waked me to sleep no more,” Douglassdeclared in a speech in Belfast, Ireland, in January 1846. He often told ofencountering the Bible by finding pages of it strewn on a Baltimore street a fewyears after first hearing it in Sophia’s melodious voice. Ever awake to thepower of a metaphor, he “raked leaves of the sacred volume” and, after washingand drying them, read the remnants. But from Sophia, a world had opened through,of all visions, that of the tragic, suffering, benighted Job!8[notes.html#ch3fn_8a]Whether or not she read past the first chapter of Job to the boy, in his ownlater reading the adult writer and orator would have found countless resonancesand uses of Job’s voice. When Douglass was in the depths of despair, each ofJob’s uses of the question why fit Douglass’s condition. “Why died I not fromthe womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?” Or evenmore poignant, as Douglass gained literacy, “Why is light given to a man whoseway is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?” As Douglass came to see words as hisholiest possession, he could share Job’s deep frustration: “How forcible areright words! But what does your arguing reprove? Do ye imagine to reprove words,and the speeches of one who is desperate, which are as wind?” And surely, it wasJob’s declarative voice of complaint, defended directly to God over and again,that could teach Douglass a new tongue: “Therefore I will not refrain my mouth;I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness ofmy soul.”9 [notes.html#ch3fn_9a] Could Sophia even have grasped what aninstrument of power she had unleashed in Frederick?If Sophia had not realized the potential danger of her actions, her husband sooninformed her. When Frederick was about eleven years old, Hugh Auld suddenlyforbade with stern anger any further instruction in reading for the young slave.Auld rebuked his wife; literacy was “unlawful” in Maryland for slaves, heclaimed, and “learning would spoil the best nigger in the world.” Douglass tookgreat care to quote several lines he claimed he recalled his master speaking.They were to become a new kind of text for him in understanding and thwartingslavery’s hold on his mind and body. If Douglass was taught to read the Bible,“there will be no keeping him,” Auld reportedly said. It would “forever unfithim for the duties of a slave.” And in full paternalistic gravity, the anxiousslave owner maintained that “learning would do him no good, but probably, agreat deal of harm—making him disconsolate and unhappy.” Before long, the youngslave would “want to know how to write,” Auld warned. In retrospect, Douglassmade the most of this traumatic juncture in his newfound life in Baltimore. Hecalled master Hugh’s chastisement of his wife in front of the slave the “firstdecidedly antislavery lecture to which it had been my lot to listen.”10[notes.html#ch3fn_10a]As autobiographer, Douglass constantly portrayed especially his early life as aseries of turning points, episodes of crisis, confrontation, and learning, wherethe hero is tested, sometimes brutally and beyond his will or strength. Most ofthe time, though, the hero endures and gains self-knowledge and some new groundin his personal war against his enslavers. None of these turning points orbattles was ever more important than his ascent to literacy and knowledge.Words would become Douglass’s stock-in-trade; if Miss Sophia had provided thegift of literacy first, he now claimed, with no small amount of bravado, thatmaster Hugh had also given him a gift. Auld’s “iron sentences” becameinspiration rather than denial. Douglass recollected himself awakening for thefirst time to the “white man’s power to perpetuate the enslavement of the blackman.” If “knowledge unfits a child to be a slave,” Douglass later wrote, then hehad found the motive power of his path out, or at least inward, to freedom. Everready to employ biting irony to make his case, Douglass left this telling andhonest description of the lesson learned: “That which he most loved I mosthated; and the very determination which he expressed to keep me in ignorance,only rendered me the more resolute in seeking intelligence.” Although still achild, Douglass nevertheless remembered the episode as a seismic shift in hisconception of the world. “In learning to read, therefore,” Douglass declared, “Iam not sure that I do not owe quite as much to the opposition of my master, asto the kindly assistance of my amiable mistress.”11 [notes.html#ch3fn_11a] Evenas a child, Douglass learned to negotiate with and define himself by hisopposition. This was a life lesson Douglass would invoke time and again in hislater career, whether the enemy was a master, an overseer, a mob throwingbrickbats, a stiflingly competitive fellow abolitionist, proslavery ideology,the Confederacy itself, Abraham Lincoln, or white supremacists who defined himout of the human family. Their opposition became his motive power, theirarguments his own tools of counterargument in the courts of moral justice.In the case of the Aulds and reading, Douglass would steadily see to the centerof one of slavery’s mysteries, and into its evil heart. With his quest forliteracy and the liberation of his mind, Douglass turned his own youth into oneof the most profound meditations ever written on the character and meaning ofslavery, of the slaveholders’ mentality, and of human nature itself. In hisfirst two autobiographies, Douglass seemed intuitively aware of Georg Hegel’sfamous insight about the mutual dependence of the master and the slave, of theirinherent need for recognition from each other for the system to work. Fromexperience, Douglass had his own ways of showing how the more perfect the slave,the more enslaved the master. And he showed how slavery, no matter how brutalits forms and conditions, was the meeting of two kinds of consciousness in atest of wills, and that total domination or absolute authority by the master wasonly rarely possible. He understood just how much the master’s own identity asan independent, powerful person depended on the slave’s recognition through hiswilling labor of that master’s authority. But as Hegel put it, and Douglasslived it, in that labor, and the master’s necessity of recognizing his humanityin performing it, “the bondsman becomes aware, through this rediscovery ofhimself by himself, of having and being a mind of his own.”12[notes.html#ch3fn_12a] The house on Philpot Street, as well as the entireteeming domain of Fell’s Point, became for Douglass a kind of psychological andphilosophical school in which he discovered that most precious thing—his mind.And he learned just how much his enslavers needed his mind as they struggled tosuppress it. Emerging in the youthful slave was not only an intelligence andpassion for survival and knowledge, but a political instinct as well.According to Douglass, Sophia “lacked the depravity indispensable to shutting”her slave boy “up in mental darkness.” She needed a great deal of “training,” hewrote, to succeed in “forgetting my human nature,” or in “treating me as a thingdestitute of a moral and intellectual nature.” But now, under her husband’sorders, she surely tried to push against what Douglass called “nature” itself.“One cannot easily forget to love freedom,” wrote the former slave, “and it isas hard to cease to respect that natural love in our fellow creatures.” Sophiastarted out on her brief career as a slave master as a “tender-hearted woman,”but under the new social strictures, her “lamb-like disposition gave way to oneof tiger-like fierceness.” By various clandestine “indirections,” as he cleverlycalled it, the eager young reader smuggled newspapers and even books into thehouse, and even into his bed in a loft. Compellingly, Douglass observed the darkirony of Sophia’s tragic learning curve. However hard she tried, it was all butimpossible for her to see the black eleven- and twelve-year-old as mere chattel.“I was more than that,” he asserted, “and she felt me to be more than that. Icould talk and sing; I could laugh and weep; I could reason and remember; Icould love and hate. I was human, and she, dear lady, knew and felt me to beso.”13 [notes.html#ch3fn_13a]Douglass later used his achievement of such self-awareness for numerousantislavery, as well as personal, purposes. But he also used it to demonstrateMiss Sophia’s moral ruin, as he found his own moral ascent. “Conscience cannotstand much violence,” Douglass philosophized. “In ceasing to instruct me, shemust begin to justify herself to herself.” Thus her anger when she saw Frederickin a corner “quietly reading a book or a newspaper.” She came to treat him likea “traitor” launching a dangerous “plot.” With Sophia constantly suspicious ofFrederick’s reading, and Frederick constantly wary of his mistress’s policing ofhis habits and thoughts, together, as Douglass later phrased it, they reachedthe same conclusion: “education and slavery are incompatible with each other.”14[notes.html#ch3fn_14a] This master-slave relationship, having begun withmotherly love and childlike adoration, became an all-out war for either totalliberation or unconditional surrender. Outwitting his mistress and her angryhusband, Frederick went out into the streets to recruit reinforcements for hislittle war.For Frederick Bailey, reading was manna from heaven; but he was the one givingout the bread. Right on Philpot Street, near the Durgin and Bailey Shipyard,Frederick made friends with several white boys who lived in the sameneighborhood. He would later claim this was all part of his “plan,” cleverly“using my young white playmates” as teachers. But his recollections make clearthat he developed a genuine bond with these struggling and hungry immigrantkids. Frederick carried his Webster’s spelling book, and at every chance hewould corner the white boys and, while “seated on a curbstone or a cellar door,”solicit from them spelling lessons in return for his “tuition fee”—Sophia Auld’sfresh warm bread. A “single biscuit” would also lead to animated discussions ofwhy Frederick was a slave for life and why the white boys were free. The boystook him into their secret emotional havens and supported their enslaved friend.They told him slavery was unfair and that he would be free one day, especiallywhen he turned twenty-one. Their words encouraged him, Douglass remembered. Thisconvinced him that young boys were natural abolitionists, at least until theyreached a certain age when they were no longer “unseared and unperverted” byslavery’s material and moral logic.15 [notes.html#ch3fn_15a]Douglass trusted the “consciences” of his young mates, whom he would not name inthe early autobiographies to protect them from retribution in their adulthood.But by the time of writing Life and Times in 1881, he thanked four by name:Gustavus Dorgan, Joseph Bailey, Charles Farity, and William Cosdry. Here wasDouglass’s first comradeship with young Irishmen, his first trusted experiencewith humanism beyond race. As white boys condemned the hypocrisy and oppressionof their parents toward one of their favorite fellow street urchins, perhapsDouglass found even ultimate experiential inspiration for his later speeches andwritings. Whenever Douglass made arguments against slavery from thenatural-rights tradition, which he did persistently after 1841, he could reflectupon this experience with the boys of Philpot Street, who often told him that“they believed I had as good a right to be free as they did,” and that “they didnot believe God ever made anyone to be a slave.”16 [notes.html#ch3fn_16a]As a slave in Baltimore, feeling more and more hemmed in as he grew in size andage, Douglass needed all the evidence he could muster to keep nature on hisside. Then he found the book that changed his life. His white friends carriedand studied a school reader, The Columbian Orator, by the compiler and teacherCaleb Bingham. On a day in 1830, Frederick took fifty cents he had earned on oddjobs around the shipyard, went to Nathaniel Knight’s bookstore on Thames Street,and purchased a secondhand copy of the book he would later call his “richtreasure” and his “noble acquisition.”17 [notes.html#ch3fn_17a] From that dayforward in his life as a slave, The Columbian Orator became his constantcompanion, whether he was hiding in his loft reading space at the Aulds’Baltimore house, back on the Eastern Shore as a desperate teenager teaching somefellow slaves in a Sabbath school, or carrying it as almost his sole worldlypossession when he escaped to freedom at age twenty.Image [../images/f0043-01.jpg]The title page of the introduction and part of the table of contents of TheColumbian Orator, first published in 1797. Douglass carried his personal copyout of slavery with him.The Columbian Orator went through twenty-three editions and many printings in atleast ten cities from Vermont to Maryland over the more than sixty years itremained in print. With hardly any formal schooling, although a good deal ofreading in his prairie farming background, the twenty-two-year-old AbrahamLincoln studied with relish the classical and Enlightenment-era oratory in TheColumbian Orator during his first winter (1831–32) in New Salem, Illinois. Thatan urban slave youth living in Frederick Bailey’s circumstances in Baltimorewould, only a year earlier, discover this book through his white companions, whowere in school, where there was an edition published in Maryland, is notsurprising. That Douglass would embrace and later celebrate the language in thisbook is also not surprising. The Columbian Orator was much more than a stiffcollection of Christian moralisms for America’s youth. It was the creation of aman of decidedly antislavery sympathies, one determined to democratize educationand instill in young people the heritage of the American Revolution, as well asthe values of republicanism.18 [notes.html#ch3fn_18a]Caleb Bingham’s eighty-four entries were organized without regard for chronologyor topic; such a lack of system was a pedagogical theory of the time designed tohold student interest. It held Frederick Bailey in rapt attention. Theselections included prose, verse, plays, and especially political speeches byfamous orators from antiquity and the Enlightenment. Cato, Cicero, Demosthenes,Socrates, John Milton, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, William Pitt,Napoléon, Charles James Fox, and Daniel O’Connell (whom Bingham mistakenlyidentifies as O’Connor) all appear at least once, and some several times. Mostof the pieces address themes of nationalism, individual liberty, religiousfaith, or the value of education. The reader as a whole reflected, as Binghamintended, New England’s long transition from seventeenth-century Calvinism tonineteenth-century evangelical, freewill doctrine, from Puritan theocracy to theRevolutionary era’s separation of church and state. As Douglass tackled thepages of The Columbian Orator in his early teens, whether he grasped thecontexts or not, he would have repeatedly encountered irresistible words such as“freedom,” “liberty,” “tyranny,” and the “rights of man.”19[notes.html#ch3fn_19a] Well before he read any serious history, he garnered andcherished a vocabulary of liberation.Among the most striking features of the collection were eleven dialogues, mostof them originally written for the book by David Everett, Bingham’s associate inBoston. They were both serious and comical, aimed at the ethical imagination ofyoung people and laced with moral tales about human nature, truth telling, andreversals of fate where underdogs outwit their oppressors. In “Dialogue Betweenthe Ghosts of an English Duelist, a North American Savage, and Mercury,” theEnglishman is revealed as the greater “savage,” while the Mohawk Indian,respected for his cultural differences, achieves the higher virtue. With suchstories about democratized education and ethnic pluralism, it was as ifFrederick Bailey had landed in a modern multicultural classroom in the midst ofa slave state. He read many speeches, and especially one dialogue, “repeatedly.”“Dialogue Between a Master and a Slave” is to modern eyes a naïve and simplisticexchange between a slave owner and his bondman; but it profoundly affectedDouglass as he read its improbable conclusion. If we can imagine our way into athirteen- or fourteen-year-old’s sensibility, what Douglass discovered in thisstory was that slavery was subject to “argument,” even between a master and aslave. That the slave would convince the master to liberate him is improbable,but the teenager, psychologically imprisoned in his seemingly permanent fate,needed all the examples he could find of reason winning over power. The bondmaneven gets the last word in the dialogue, warning the slaveholder that despitehis “kindness,” he, the slave, is still “surrounded by implacable foes” bent on“revenge.”20 [notes.html#ch3fn_20a]On page after page of The Columbian Orator, Frederick found the reality of hiscondition, as well as dreams and justifications of his escape. His reading addednot only to his “limited stock of language,” he recalled, but it enabled him “togive tongue to many interesting thoughts which had frequently flashed through mysoul.” Young, angry, but exhilarated by the ferment and liberation in his mind,if not yet his body, Douglass felt his special book pouring “floods of light onthe nature and character of slavery.” He believed he had “now penetrated thesecret of all slavery and oppression, and had ascertained their true foundationto be in the pride, the power and the avarice of man.”21 [notes.html#ch3fn_21a]As an adult autobiographer, representing how a budding adolescent discoveredknowledge of himself and of the human condition, Douglass left a transcendentrecord of the light emerging in his mind.From Slaves in Barbary: A Drama in Two Acts, Douglass must have read aloud insolitude, which was his favorite habit, about a fascinating and motleycollection of captives being sold as slaves. They include Turks, an Irishman, ablack American slave named Sharp, and an American sea captain named Kidnap. InDouglass’s imagination the story and the group may have felt a little like hisgang of friends from the Baltimore streets. In a reversal of fortune, both Sharpand Kidnap are sold, but the white sea captain is put under Sharp’s“instruction.” Sharp has a thick slave dialect, which may have attracted theyoung Douglass, but he would surely have relished the eloquent speech of Teague(the Irish captive) in which he declares, “If men were made to be slaves andmasters, why was not one man born with a whip in his hand and gold spoon in hismouth; and another with a chain on his arm, or a fetter to his heel?” AndDouglass could not have missed the rousing ending, where Hamet, the “Bashaw ofTunis,” frees a noble captive named Francisco, declaring, “Let it be remembered,there is no luxury so exquisite as the exercise of humanity, and no post sohonourable as his, who defends THE RIGHTS OF MAN.”22 [notes.html#ch3fn_22a] Inhis youth, Douglass had seen and learned so much about gold spoons, chains, andwhips. He knew much about whites and blacks trapped in a system’s fated destiny.But he never met a Bashaw he could trust.From The Columbian Orator Douglass learned a great deal of motivation andconfidence; but trust in the people around him, friend or foe, would be a longtime coming. Above all, what Douglass found in this book was an elocutionmanual. Bingham’s long introduction, “General Directions for Speaking,” whichdrew upon the ancients to demonstrate a variety of practical techniques foreffective oratory, may have been the most important thing Douglass ever read.The primary aim of oratory, said Bingham, was to create “action” between speakerand audience. “The perfection of art consists in its nearest resemblance tonature,” the educator argued. True eloquence emerged when the orator could trainhis voice to “follow nature.”23 [notes.html#ch3fn_23a] Bingham provided specificexamples of such elements of speech making as cadence, pace, variety of tone,and especially gestures of the arms, hands, shoulders, and head. Young Frederickwas enthralled, and though he could not yet know it, his life’s vocation, histrue calling, appeared as a saving grace.Gaining knowledge—through experience, and now so importantly through reading,and slowly, through what he called the “art of writing”—became young Douglass’sreason for living. It came with both joy and fear. In his first twoautobiographies, Douglass wrote honest passages about his seizure of literacythat speak to the ages, to anyone who has ever found learning a pathway togenuine liberation. One can never know exactly how much Douglass imaginedhimself speaking to history, to millions of potential readers living behindwalls of oppression. But he surely did here. “The increase of knowledge,” hereported, “was attended with bitter, as well as sweet results. The more I readthe more I was led to abhor and detest slavery, and my enslavers.” More thanoverseers’ beatings, fear of sale, or hunger and futurelessness, it was as ifDouglass the writer of 1845 and the reviser of 1855 had found the existentialcore of his slave life: “As I read, behold! the very discontent so graphicallypredicted by master Hugh had already come upon me . . . The revelation hauntedme, stung me, and made me gloomy and miserable. As I writhed under the tormentof this knowledge, I almost envied my fellow slaves their stupid contentment.”Ten years earlier in the 1845 Narrative, Douglass had kept the point sharp andunforgettably eloquent:I have often wished myself a beast. I preferred the condition of the meanestreptile to my own. Anything, no matter what to get rid of thinking! It was thiseverlasting thinking of my condition that tormented me. There was no getting ridof it. It pressed upon me by every object within sight or hearing, animate orinanimate. The silver trump of freedom had aroused my soul to eternalwakefulness. Freedom now appeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard inevery sound, and seen in every thing. It was ever present to torment me with asense of my wretched condition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothingwithout hearing it, and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from everystar, it smiled in every calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in everystorm.24 [notes.html#ch3fn_24a]When Douglass’s memory spoke within him, it often poured out in prose poetry.Remembering with all of his senses, did a twenty-seven-year-old writer everexpress the craving for knowledge, life, and love, or the yearning for realfreedom, any better?"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 4--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BALTIMORE DREAMSFear not . . . I am come for thy words.—DANIEL 10:12In the first seven years Douglass lived in the Auld household in Baltimore, herecollected, “As the almanac makers say of the weather—my condition wasvariable.” He grew into his teenage years through a series of fateful encountersin Fell’s Point on the harbor of Baltimore. From his enslavement he increasinglylearned the meaning of his own humanity. Baltimore afforded him horizons to peerupon that the Eastern Shore closed off. With his “play fellows” along PhilpotStreet and around Durgin and Bailey Shipyard, he could test his wits and gain asense of comradeship. In the Baltimore streets he also saw terrible cruelty andgenuine humanity, “dark crimes without a name,” as well as conditions that madea “city slave . . . almost a free citizen.” He learned to assert himselfmentally and physically, but that his “happiness was the sport of my masters.”1[notes.html#ch4fn_1a]In October 1827, with Douglass still only nine years old, his owner, AaronAnthony, died without a will. Frederick was forced to return to the EasternShore to be valued and divided up among twenty-eight other slaves as well as allof Anthony’s other property. Anthony had three heirs, his sons Andrew andRichard, and daughter Lucretia (to whom Frederick had grown attached as achild). Unknown to the slave boy, Lucretia had died in the summer of 1827, andher portion of her father’s property would go to her husband, Thomas Auld.Relatively delighted in his new life in Baltimore, the youth was about toreceive a new lesson in the enormity of slavery’s crimes against the human bodyand spirit. All of Frederick’s slave kinfolk feared most falling into the handsof Andrew Anthony, a “cruel wretch,” according to Douglass. Frightened andsorrowful, Sophia Auld and her son, Tommy, wept bitterly with Frederick as theydelivered him to the docks and the schooner Wildcat, for the twenty-four-hourjourney down the Chesapeake Bay and back to the Eastern Shore. Sophia’s hugsreflected a maternal bonding the boy desperately craved. He lounged on piles oftarpaulins aboard the slow tub of a boat and later recollected, “No one couldtell among which pile of chattels I should be flung.”2 [notes.html#ch4fn_2a]The schooner circled up the Choptank River, then to the Tuckahoe, and droppedoff Frederick near the Holme Hill Farm and his grandmother’s cabin. He was acity boy now, and as Betsy Bailey greeted him, the other slave children lookedon with strange gazes. Frederick felt an odd and sudden distance from this placeof his birth. With excitement and anxiety, on October 18, 1827, twenty-nineslaves, almost all related by blood, some possibly the sons or daughters of thedeceased master, representing three generations, lined up in a row and awaitedtheir fate. Frederick’s siblings were only vaguely familiar to him: his olderbrother, Perry, victim of a savage beating and kicking by Andrew Anthony only ashort while before the day of division, was now fifteen and a field hand; hissisters, Sarah and Eliza, were thirteen and eleven. Following Maryland law andcustom, the court-appointed appraisers, James Chambers and William Leonard,lined everyone up and did their assigned jobs. In most instances families werepreserved and children remained with their mothers. In their heartless task, theappraisers divided the black people into three roughly equal lots. The totalworth of the twenty-nine chattels was determined to be $2,800.3[notes.html#ch4fn_3a] At a time when the cotton boom and the westward expansionof slavery surged into the Deep South and the Mississippi Valley, it isremarkable and against statistical odds that Frederick was given to Thomas Auldthrough his deceased wife. And apparently, Auld had already determined to sendFrederick back to Baltimore to his brother Hugh’s household.Douglass spent one month on the Eastern Shore during this harrowing episode.Greatly relieved with a boy’s self-interest, he seems not to have felt muchattachment to his siblings, cousins, and aunts and uncles. He just wanted to beback in the atmosphere of Baltimore, where he could resume his urban adventurewith literacy and somehow dream again. But as autobiographer, Douglass fashionedbrilliant antislavery gems out of this darkest of slavery’s evils. It “was theintensified degradation of the spectacle” that most lingered in the imagination.“What an assemblage!” he wrote. “Men and women, young and old, married andsingle; moral and intellectual beings, in open contempt of their humanity,leveled at a blow with horses, sheep, horned cattle and swine!” Douglass gavevoice to the reality of social death. “Horses and men—cattle and women—pigs andchildren—all holding the same rank in the scale of social existence; and allsubjected to the same narrow inspection, to ascertain their value in gold andsilver. . . . How vividly, at that moment, did the brutalizing power of slaveryflash before me! Personality swallowed up in the sordid idea of property!Manhood lost in chattelhood!”4 [notes.html#ch4fn_4a]In his remembrance Douglass was a bit patronizing toward his fellow slaves andkinfolk. He claimed that in this frightful division of human beings that helikely “suffered more than most” because in Baltimore he had experienced more“tender treatment” than those left on the farm in Tuckahoe. He no longer facedthe slaveholder’s whip (for now), but they did. “The overseer had written hischaracter on the living parchment of most of their backs, and left themcallous.” While a striking metaphor, this characterization is merely one in along line of expressions by which Douglass beautifully represented the interiorand exterior experience of slaves while also distancing himself from it on hisself-styled path to fame. Assuredly, Frederick was thrilled to be back inBaltimore pitching pennies in the streets with his white buddies and learning toread from Sophia. His three sisters and one brother found a very different fate;all were allotted to Andrew Anthony, who drank himself into debt, selling offmost of his slaves to the Deep South.5 [notes.html#ch4fn_5a] It would be decadesand only through historic revolutions that Douglass would ever know most of hissiblings again.• • •Frederick Bailey seized an education from the streets of Baltimore. From thecity’s young immigrant boys, from the laborers, smells, sounds, and dangers ofthe docks, from a mistress who tried to love him only to turn bitter foe, from astorefront preacher and a free black community that gave him hope, and from abook that made him dream, the future Douglass cultivated a furtive, lyricalimagination rooted in his discovery of language. From these days forward, thatlanguage forever churned inside him, ready to burst out on the page or in hisvoice. But his young life took shape from numerous twists of fortune that kepthim back and forth to Baltimore instead of experiencing, as did many of hisbrothers, sisters, and cousins, a fate of obscurity in the booming slavemarkets.Between the ages of ten and fourteen or so, Frederick grew stronger physically,but his falling-out with mistress Sophia over reading took a heavy emotionaltoll. The boy craved love and affection, and when he found it, he held on tight;when he lost it, he spun into despair. As he reached puberty and adolescenceFrederick wanted some element of certainty, and now he seemed to find onlyconfusion. Sophia’s “abuse” fell upon him like a mother’s sudden betrayal.“Nature had made us friends,” he later wrote, “slavery made us enemies.” Deniedhis joy in reading, unable to forge new forms of hope, Frederick descended intoa “leaden, downcast” disposition. Sophia just could not understand his sorrowand chastised him for it. Her false smiles were met with an early teenager’srage. Douglass later claimed he was so despondent during this period of roughly1830–33 that he “was even tempted to destroy my own life.”6[notes.html#ch4fn_6a] But as so often in his saga, in real time and in creativeretrospect, he found emotional revival in words, and in yet another adultfigure, this time a religious mentor.Frederick overheard conversations in which master Hugh complained among hisfriends about the threat of “abolitionists.” The boy smuggled newspapers,especially the Baltimore American, into the kitchen loft where he slept; in onearticle the paper reported the “incendiary information” that a “vast number ofpetitions and memorials had been presented to congress, praying for theabolition of slavery in the District of Columbia, and for the abolition of theslave trade between the states of the Union.” These were, Douglass recalled,revelatory if mysterious words. With relish he found a dictionary and looked upthe word abolition, only to find that it meant the “act of abolishing.” Again heextracted his education from his white owners and oppressors. “There was HOPE inthose words,” Douglass wrote. Wielding adjectives like daggers, he named the“vindictive bitterness, the marked caution, the studied reserve, and thecumbrous ambiguity” of white folks expressing their fears of the word abolitionas his evidence of things not seen. When one reads Douglass’s autobiographieswith modern eyes, these expressions can be dismissed as antislavery propaganda.But in his living situation in Baltimore, his intellectual curiosity explodingin the midst of the stultifying Auld household, gazing daily out on shipsparting and arriving in the harbor, Douglass realized that slaveholders’ fearsof outside “denunciation” (which he increasingly found in his varied reading)provided him assurance that he “was not alone.”7 [notes.html#ch4fn_7a]In the late summer and fall of 1831, likely from overheard conversations at homeand in the streets, but also perhaps from newspapers, Frederick learned that“the insurrection of Nathaniel Turner had been quelled, but the alarm and terrorhad not subsided.” He does not tell us of any actual conversations in which heparticipated about the Turner rebellion; most slaves learned quickly to besilent and uninterested in such outbreaks of violence and resistance in front ofwhite people who could wield absolute power over them. But he used the episode,which caused excitement around Fell’s Point, to introduce thespiritual-religious awakening of his youth. He began to see, he wrote, thatGod’s “judgments were abroad in the land” against “slaveholding wickedness.” Theidea of “abolition” gave him new hope, he said, because “I saw it supported bythe Almighty, and armed with Death!”8 [notes.html#ch4fn_8a]During the year of the Turner rebellion and its aftermath, Douglass foundreligion. He seems to have experienced a genuine conversion to faith in apersonal Christian God. At thirteen and fourteen years old, Frederick hadlearned much already about survival and about the inner uses of solitude. But hewas always nearly desperate to know he was “not alone.” Young Frederick wasenthralled with oratory and preaching, with words that could fill a room andstir an audience in mind and spirit. In his trusty companion, The ColumbianOrator, Bingham’s first selection, “An Extract from an Oration on EloquencePronounced at Harvard University, on Commencement Day, 1794,” by WilliamPerkins, Frederick found “eloquence” described with “great superiority overevery other art.” Powerful oratory, he learned, could “scatter the clouds ofignorance and error from the atmosphere of reason . . . irradiate the benightedmind with the cheering beams of truth.” Inspired by such words, the teenager whofelt emotionally and spiritually wretched was ready to discover the “businessand glory of eloquence.”9 [notes.html#ch4fn_9a] Preachers fascinated him,especially if they could wield words honestly and convincingly. He was drawnfirst to the performance, although the theology intrigued him as well.At first, two white ministers influenced Frederick. Sophia Auld’s pastor,Beverly Waugh, from the Wilk Street Methodist Church, would often visit Sophiain her own parlor to bolster her faith. Frederick listened, was impressed by thereverend’s piety, as well as Sophia’s open religious struggles, but not withanything Waugh said about the worlds beyond the walls of the house. He likedattending the sermons of another Baltimore Methodist reverend named Hansonbecause he preached that “all men, great and small, bond and free, were sinnersin the sight of God; that they were by nature rebels against His government; andthat they must repent of their sins, and be reconciled to God through Christ.”“All men . . . bond and free?” Here was an early dose of theology and a modestnod to spiritual equality that would begin to condition Douglass for the moralpersuasions of the abolitionists he would join some eight or nine years later.Is it possible that Frederick had heard the Reverend Hanson preach on Paul’sletter to the Galatians? “There is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neitherbond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in ChristJesus.” Had Hanson possibly stumbled on 2 Corinthians’ famous passage, with ayoung slave sitting in the back of the congregation? “But by an equality, thatnow at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that theirabundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality.” Here,in a Baltimore church as a lonely teenager, young Frederick may have encounteredhis first textual lessons in the natural-rights tradition, the philosophy thatwould give him a voice.10 [notes.html#ch4fn_10a] In the future Douglass wouldalways be drawn, as a believer and as a contrarian, to theological arguments andto the sheer power of biblical narratives and stories. But right now, with hisBaltimore dreams lying dormant and cold, he needed personal faith.Such an awakening also came from his contacts with black preachers. Manyfundamental ideas, and especially the sermonic cadences of the language inDouglass’s Narrative and in My Bondage and My Freedom, not to mention most ofhis early speeches, can be traced, in part, to the influences of a kind of blackspiritual temperament and worldview that he soaked up from the African Americanreligious community of Baltimore in his teenage years. Along with the stages ofenslavement he experienced on the Eastern Shore, and from the knowledge heconstantly took from all around him, this was Douglass’s closest thing toschooling.Frederick encountered a black lay preacher, Charles Johnson, who awakened theboy to prayer. Johnson spoke with him in “tones of holy affection,” Douglasswrote. Through the “misery of doubts and fears,” the desperate teenagerunderwent what he called a conversion to “faith in Jesus Christ, as theRedeemer, Friend and Savior of those who diligently seek him.” With suchlanguage drawn from liturgy and confession, Frederick now cultivated hisinsatiable desire for knowledge by reading the Bible, Old and New Testaments. Hemight have even stumbled on the Sermon on the Mount. He now saw the world “in anew light,” he recalled. He felt new impulses for living, “new hopes anddesires.” He even “loved all mankind—slaveholders not excepted; though Iabhorred slavery more than ever. My great desire now was to have the worldconverted.”11 [notes.html#ch4fn_11a] But his new faith was soon sorely tested.In this state of mind, “religiously seeking knowledge,” he met an old man,Charles Lawson, who quickly became his deepest influence. A drayman who workedfor the owner of a ropewalk on Fell’s Point, Lawson exuded a spiritualityFrederick had never before encountered. Lawson lived only a short walk from HughAuld’s house; the elder and the youth developed a cherished relationship.Douglass called Lawson alternately “uncle” and “Father.” Above all, he wasFrederick’s teacher. To the young, despairing slave with a curious, ifimprisoned, mind, Lawson was a holy man living in a hovel who prayed constantly,while walking the streets or even in the midst of conversations. Fredericklistened to Lawson and loved him. They became spiritual companions, spending allavailable hours “singing, praying, and glorifying God.” Lawson could read only alittle, but he could interpret biblical metaphor, symbolism, and story asFrederick recited the words. For the young Douglass, slavery and life were hisschools; but here he received a tutorial like no other at the feet of thetattered, prayerful old man. “I could teach him ‘the letter,’ ” wrote Douglass,“but he could teach me ‘the spirit.’ ” Perhaps in their readings andrecitations, he and lawson stopped in Paul’s letter to the Romans, as Douglasslearned that for believers “the law” (natural rights) was “written in theirhearts.”12 [notes.html#ch4fn_12a] Fred Bailey gained a lifelong fascination forPaul, the prisoner prophet.Lawson gave Douglass two priceless gifts. One was faith; the other was theinsatiable desire for knowledge through a love of words. Lawson instilled in theyouth a belief about which Douglass wrote intensely. God “had a great work forme to do,” he recalled as Lawson’s charge, and the impressionable youth made aspiritual surrender to faith. His slavery was not permanent, Lawson helped himhope and believe. In thus nurturing Frederick’s hope, Lawson prompted a cravingfor ideas, for books, for knowledge of the human morass in the Baltimore streetsas well as in the wide world beyond. From Lawson, Douglass took the challengethat “I must go on reading and studying the scriptures.” The praying drayman,like any of God’s humble messengers in the Bible, had “fanned my already intenselove of knowledge into a flame.” Lawson was a Jesus figure of a kind forDouglass at a time when he desperately needed one. In 1855, he remembered Lawsonas “my dear old father . . . the very counterpart of ‘Uncle Tom.’ Theresemblance is so perfect, that he might have been the original of Mrs. Stowe’sChristian hero.” We can only guess at what biblical passages Lawson andFrederick dwelled on in their many days together. But what Lawson seems to havestressed most were the freedom from fear and the power of humility. Thefrightened teenager said he came to feel “under the guidance of a wisdom higherthan my own.” They may have read the startling visions in the book of Daniel.“Mourning” and “trembling” for many weeks, the prophet heard God speak to him:“Fear not Daniel; for from the first day thou didst set thine heart tounderstand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I amcome for thy words.”13 [notes.html#ch4fn_13a] Whatever they read, Douglass foundhope in the presence of this spiritual father and was also beginning to find acalling.Among Douglass’s most powerful cravings now was to learn what he called the “artof writing.” In his autobiographical memory, Douglass fashioned his emergingteenage literacy as his “means” of escape from slavery. It was his ultimatehunger, sometimes satisfied and sometimes not. In Baltimore, thisearly-nineteenth-century corner of a maritime world, full of immigrants, of theclash of languages and dialects, and of information that flowed in from theAtlantic Ocean and in front of his eyes via newspapers and books, Frederickobserved the power of words. His job for a time at Durgin and Bailey Shipyardwas to keep the fire burning under the steam box, and to watch the yard when thecarpenters broke for dinner. In these intervals, Douglass would sit on a crateand study pieces of wood the carpenters were hewing into ships’ timbers. Theywere labeled S for “starboard,” L for “larboard,” S.F. for “starboard forward,”and so on. He memorized the letters and their uses. Moreover, Frederick loved itwhen the Aulds left him alone in the house; he had a “grand time,” he reported,appropriating Tommy’s copybooks and reworking them. He crammed a flour barreland a chair up into his kitchen loft, and there, with minimal light, the futureauthor copied words, sentences, and whole passages from a Webster spelling book,The Columbian Orator, the Bible, and a Methodist hymnbook. Out in the streetsand at the docks, he created his own school tablets, even if he remembered it abit romantically: “With playmates for my teachers, fences and pavements for mycopybooks, and chalk for my pen and ink, I learned the art of writing.”14[notes.html#ch4fn_14a] This story alone should remind us why Douglass’sautobiographies have sustained universal appeal. He knew that a slave stealingknowledge and the power of the word from the residue of urban maritime life, aswell as from literary treasures no one could deny him, made a great story. Bymining his memory for the details of his seizure of literacy, Douglass gave theworld one of his greatest gifts. Words had become a reason to live.• • •In March 1833, Frederick Bailey, a literate, intellectually curious, spirituallyawakened slave, found his Baltimore dreams brutally disrupted yet again. An uglyslaveholders’ feud between the brothers Thomas and Hugh Auld, the oneFrederick’s owner and the other his current keeper, prompted his sudden forceddeparture back to the Eastern Shore. Thomas’s wife, Lucretia (whom the childDouglass had adored), died in 1827, and he married Rowena Hamilton, the daughterof a wealthy Eastern Shore slaveholder, William Hamilton. Auld now lived in St.Michaels, the drab oyster-fishing town along the Miles River, only a few bendsbefore it opened out to the Chesapeake Bay. According to Douglass, the disputebetween the Aulds stemmed from how to treat Douglass’s young cousin HennyBailey, who was among the brood of slaves Thomas Auld had inherited from AaronAnthony. As a child, Henny had fallen into a fire and burned her hands, leavingher with terrible disfigurement and incapable of most forms of labor. To Auld,recalled Douglass, Henny was “of little more value than a horse with a brokenleg.” So Thomas sent the girl to his brother’s household in Baltimore. But Hughand Sophia found her of no value either. They soon sent her back to Thomas, whodid not want her. This action led Thomas in a fit of pique to conclude: “If hecannot keep ‘Hen,’ he shall not have ‘Fred.’ ”15 [notes.html#ch4fn_15a]Douglass’s portrayal of this episode may represent his desire to keep himselfalways at the center of his autobiographical tale. But such were the smalldestructive dramas in the daily life of American slavery. Were it not for thefame and literary mastery of Douglass, we would never know about the crippledHennys of history.Image [../images/f0056-01.jpg]View of Baltimore harbor. 1850s. Photograph.Feeling a “shock to my nerves,” the fifteen-year-old Frederick found himself ona cold day aboard the sloop Amanda, again on his way back to what would now seemthe desolate, imprisoning landscape of his youth. As he took his place in Auld’sovercrowded house and general store at Cherry and Talbot Streets (actually in aseparate kitchen dwelling out back) in St. Michaels, he was one of four townslaves, including his older sister Eliza, his aunt Priscilla, and Henny. Hewondered whether he would ever see Baltimore or feel its urban hopes andenergies again. The seventeen-year-old Eliza became Frederick’s staunch ally;she was already considered married to a free black man named Peter Mitchell, towhom Auld would eventually sell her. She conspired with her angry youngerbrother in their day-to-day resistance to Auld’s rule. Exceedingly depressed,Frederick not only missed his friends, the docks, his religious mentor, Lawson,his access to books and newspapers in Baltimore; he also now felt physicalhunger.16 [notes.html#ch4fn_16a]A growing teenager with likely an insatiable appetite, he scrounged for andstole extra food by almost any means necessary. Auld was “stingy,” wroteDouglass of this dark time in his slave life, but his new wife, Rowena, wasoutright “cruel.” Indian cornmeal was virtually the only food allowed the blacksat Auld’s kitchen. Douglass’s memory of this experience inspired in him one ofhis most elaborate philosophical defenses of natural-rights doctrine, as appliedto slaves under the yoke of bondage. He had a perfect right to steal hismaster’s food, or any other possession, Douglass later argued, because not onlyhad Auld rendered him property, but the slave society had marked him “privilegedplunder.” Douglass believed he was, therefore, by birthright, “justified inplundering in turn.” The hungry antebellum slave in an amoral system, the boredlaborer with nearly crushed hopes of liberty, later spoke with a raw logic morepowerful than the slaveholding revolutionaries of the late eighteenth century:“The morality of a free society can have no application to slave society.Slaveholders have made it almost impossible for the slave to commit any crime,known either to the laws of God or to the laws of man. If he steals, he takeshis own; if he kills his master, he imitates only the heroes of therevolution.”17 [notes.html#ch4fn_17a] In this brutal environment, Douglassbecame a student of human nature, of the slaveholder’s mind, and of the fullestmeanings of human rights. He was also becoming, by experience, a dangerous slaverebel. Frederick Bailey came to believe the plunderer shall in due time beplundered.But he was still hungry. The gnawing stomach, boredom, rage, and a growingintelligence mixed to make Frederick a troublesome slave. He and Auld made aperfectly disastrous pair, symbolic of why slavery was not only evil butsometimes economically a dead end for both master and slave. By Douglass’saccount, Thomas Auld merited no respect as a person, much less as a slave owner.As an adult abolitionist, eight to ten years after his tormented years as ateenage slave, Douglass became the movement’s most astute source on slaveholdermentality and character. Auld, he maintained, was not a “born” slaveholder; hewas a “poor man,” pilot of a Bay boat, and an inheritor of slaves by marriage.His main character trait was “meanness”; he lacked strength and consistency inhis handling of slaves, and though he craved power, he seemed only weak andmiserable in exercising it. Douglass lived to condemn Auld with words meant asdaggers to the heart of all lordly masters: “He was cruel, but cowardly. Hecommanded without firmness.” Auld tried to rule with the “fury of a demon,” buthe “might well be mistaken for an inquirer who had lost his way.” He was,Douglass snidely said, “not even a good imitator.”18 [notes.html#ch4fn_18a]In August 1833, Frederick attained a special insight into Auld’s character whenhis master allowed him to attend a religious revival at Bay Side, some eightmiles from St. Michaels. This classic country Methodist camp meeting leftindelible images in Douglass’s fertile memory. People came from all over TalbotCounty; two steamboat loads of pilgrims also arrived from Baltimore. Thegathering lasted a week, and slaves relieved of work for a few days could hardlyresist the excitement of hundreds of campfires roasting meat, a veritable tentcity with a preacher’s stand in the middle and a “pen” marked off for “mourners”to enter and make their confessions, embrace the Lord, and be saved. A recentconvert himself to Christian faith, although now struggling to understandwhether God intended any justice on earth, Frederick witnessed the spectacle ofmaster Thomas’s wrenching, emotional breakdown and confession in that pen.Blacks were not allowed in the pen, nor in front of the preachers’ performances,but Douglass tells us that he imposed his way close enough to hear Auld “groan,”and to see his reddened face, his disheveled hair, and a “stray tear halting onhis cheek.”19 [notes.html#ch4fn_19a] Here festered the dark heart of the moralbankruptcy of slaveholders that the future abolitionist would make his centralsubject.Douglass converted this memory into angry condemnations of the religioushypocrisy of the entire Christian slaveholding universe, especially the littlemicrocosm of Auld’s household, where the young slave now had to listen daily toloud praying and testifying by the white family, and to participate inhospitality extended to local preachers who were sometimes housed at Auld’shome, all the while enduring the good Methodist’s verbal and physical cruelty.For Douglass, the proof of any sincerity in Auld’s “teardrop” manifested in hisactions. In his deeds and his glances, wrote Douglass, it was as if the patheticmaster had concluded, “I will teach you, young man, that, though I have partedwith my sins, I have not parted with my sense. I shall hold my slaves, and go toheaven too.”20 [notes.html#ch4fn_20a] Such a vow, imagined by Douglass from thememory of his owner’s cowardly eyes, might serve as an unspoken motto of theChristian capitalists who ruled the antebellum South.Amid this despairing situation, Frederick found what he called “something worthliving for.” A pious young St. Michaels white man named Wilson discovered thatFred Bailey was literate, with a Baltimore background, and asked him to helpwith a Sabbath school to be convened at the house of a free black man namedJames Mitchell. With a dozen old spelling books and a few Bibles, they beganmeeting with twenty pupils on Sundays. Frederick loved this chance to use hismind again. “I could not go to Baltimore,” he reminisced, “but I could make alittle Baltimore here.” Before the second meeting finished, however, a mob ledby Thomas Auld, and two other white slave owners Douglass named, stormed intoMitchell’s house with sticks and epithets, driving the little band of eagerlearners back to their drab hovels. One of the “pious crew” in the mob accusedFrederick of becoming “another Nat Turner,” he recalled with ironic relish. Bythe 1840s, Douglass would become one of abolition’s fiercest critics ofproslavery religious and secular hypocrisy. But he did not need to learn thatargument from William Lloyd Garrison nor any of the other Garrisonians, who madeanticlericalism a major tenet of their crusade. Here in this isolated backwaterof American slavery, Douglass had seen and felt on his body and in his soul the“blood-chilling blasphemy” at the heart of proslavery piety. The “professedlyholy men” who owned his body and tried to own his mind had taught him virtuallyall he needed to know on that count.21 [notes.html#ch4fn_21a]Douglass seems to have adopted a devil-may-care attitude of desperation towardAuld. Auld responded by beating Frederick for the first time; although as herecalled these whippings, the proud former slave portrayed his master’s handlingof the whip as that of a hapless amateur. Not so, however, when Auld tied upcousin Henny to a joist and took out his frustrations on the crippled girl. Auldwould beat her mercilessly with a cowskin before breakfast, then leave herhanging by her strapped wrists for three to four hours, only to return later andbeat her again. In Frederick’s mind, Auld’s piety dripped with Henny’s blood. Inthis miserable circumstance, Frederick became essentially an unmanageableteenage slave. He verbally confronted Auld, refused to work, and repeatedly letthe master’s horse run away. Auld resolved to send Douglass “out . . . to bebroken” by a local slave overseer who rented his time and humble farm for justsuch a service.22 [notes.html#ch4fn_22a] Auld’s pious cruelty now transformedinto an even darker hell.On January 1, 1834, Douglass began a year of living in a kind of wilderness ofhorror at Edward Covey’s dilapidated farmstead. With his few belongings wrappedin a bundle on a stick braced over his shoulder, Frederick walked seven coldmiles westward from St. Michaels to a country setting overlooking the ChesapeakeBay. In the art of his autobiography, this place would be the “tyrant’s home,”the “dark night” of a strong young teenager broken and rendered a “brute” by atotalitarian regime ruled by one savage man.23 [notes.html#ch4fn_23a] Ishmaelfound his Ahab, the ultimate tyrant whose obsessions could never be tamed, andby whom the world could be wrecked and taken down; Douglass found his Covey, whowould bludgeon and wreck the young slave, but against whom the sufferer wouldresurrect himself through violence and will and find another reason to live.Douglass’s pivotal year as a sixteen-year-old under Covey’s savagery is forevercloaked in some of his most beguiling and lyrical prose. The chapters on thetime under Covey’s brutal rule are the longest in Douglass’s first twoautobiographies. The experience is crafted so artfully that it is oftendiscussed as little more than a literary creation, a brilliant text that livesbeyond or above the barnyard, the fence posts, the oxen team, the silent cornand wheat fields, or the dense woods of that Eastern Shore landscape. But Coveywas real, and Douglass left a good deal of blood in the soil of thatarchvillain’s farm, while also extracting a story he would one day make almostas immortal as Herman Melville’s whaling ship. Douglass’s great gift, and thereason we know of him today, is that he found ways to convert the scars Coveyleft on his body into words that might change the world. His travail underCovey’s yoke became Douglass’s crucifixion and resurrection.Although Douglass portrayed Covey as a professional slave breaker by trade, in1834 he was actually a relatively poor twenty-eight-year-old farmer, with a wifeand infant child, who hired slaves to work his rented farmstead. Covey paid Auldfor one year’s service of the strong young slave. Perhaps most disgusting to theyoung Christian Fred Bailey were Covey’s and his wife’s religious devotions,acted out in their house every morning and night. At night Covey would have hissmall family, which included a cousin employed as a worker, as well as the threeslaves gather for hymns. Since Covey was a bad singer and Frederick had a finevoice, the master would order the slave to lead with the hymn. Douglass foundsuch flaunting of religious hypocrisy nauseating; sometimes, he reports, hewould lamely sing, other times he would simply refuse and dare his “brother inthe church” to beat him. The daily problem was that Frederick was for the firsttime forced to be a “fieldhand,” working from first light to sunset, performingtasks for which he had no experience. By any measure, Covey was a sadistictaskmaster, and for all those who simply refused to believe that the lash was avivid part of the everyday lives of American slaves, Douglass demonstratedotherwise. On his third day at Covey’s farm, the brute viciously beat him with aswitch, making the blood flow and leaving painful “wales” on his back that wouldfester and hurt under his coarse wool shirt.24 [notes.html#ch4fn_24a] Thosephysical scars on his back would remain an occasional piece of Douglass’sabolitionist repertoire the rest of his life. Rarely would he whip off his shirtand show them, but they were always there as a physical and rhetorical device toshock the complacent audience.Within the first month Covey purposely sent Frederick out with a wagon and alargely unbroken team of oxen to retrieve wood. With no training in how tohandle the massive animals and the reins, he lost control, crashing the wagontwice, once in the dense woods, and once into a gatepost. Douglass later gave anaccount of this episode with elaborate detail and converted it into a richantislavery metaphor as he also converted Covey himself into the worst creatureslavery could produce. “There I was, all alone,” Douglass wrote, “in a thickwood, to which I was a stranger; my cart upset and shattered; my oxen entangled,wild and enraged; and I, poor soul . . . I knew no more of oxen, that the oxdriver is supposed to know of wisdom.” With an ax (at least he had chopped woodbefore) Frederick managed to disentangle the oxen and get his cart back to thefarmyard to face the consequences of his disaster. In the memory of thisepisode, as with so many others, he taught his readers the meaning of slavery:“I now saw, in my situation, several points of similarity with that of the oxen.They were property, so was I; they were to be broken, so was I. Covey was tobreak me, I was to break them; break and be broken—such is life.”25[notes.html#ch4fn_25a]He had become the beast, as Douglass remembered his mental and physicalfaculties during this period of despair. He anticipated future totalitariansystems and leaders as he remembered Covey’s methods of terror and control.Sometimes the wordless farmer, with “the fierceness of a wolf,” would grunt andlunge at Frederick with “sticks or cowskins” and slash his head and back overand over, leaving the laborer bleeding and all but resigned to these expectedassaults. But Covey also possessed a cunning like no other slaveholder Douglassever encountered. He and his two fellow unlucky slave workers on this isolatedfarm called Covey the “snake.” The scoundrel would “crawl in ditches andgullies” or “hide behind stumps and bushes” to spy on his slaves and startlethem into hard work. Covey, said Douglass, could make him “feel as though he wasalways present.” To a lonely, despondent, brutalized, but literatesixteen-year-old slave who had seen the city and read of an even wider, wondrousworld, Covey embodied the “system” that now imprisoned Fred Bailey in a desolatecorner of the Eastern Shore, a wilderness of unseen, untold violence from whichhe might never have returned. By midsummer, in this daily hell, Covey achievedwhat Douglass claimed was the overseer’s motive: “I was broken in body, soul andspirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, thedisposition to read departed . . . behold a man transformed into a brute.”26[notes.html#ch4fn_26a]Sundays provided Frederick his only downtime. Lonely, with no one to confide in,he tells us he would lie down under a shade tree and spend many hours in “a sortof beast-like stupor, between sleep and wake.”27 [notes.html#ch4fn_27a]Sometimes he would stroll over toward the Chesapeake Bay, which was only a shortdistance from Covey’s depressing farmstead, and the people, black and white,with whom the tall, brainy boy found no conversation. There he would allowhimself an occasional burst of imagination, a daydream he would ten years latercapture in a beautiful and haunting metaphor of freedom. Sitting in a small roomat a spare desk in Lynn, Massachusetts, in the winter of 1844–45, Douglasspeered back into his memory and wrote a passage for the ages.“Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay,” he remembered, “whosebroad bosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitableglobe.” Douglass then captured slavery and freedom with artistry unparalleled inthe genre of slave narratives:Those beautiful vessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye offreemen, were to me so many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me withthoughts of my wretched condition. I have often, in the deep stillness of asummer’s Sabbath, stood all alone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, andtraced, with saddened heart and tearful eye, the countless number of sailsmoving off to the mighty ocean. The sight of these always affected mepowerfully. My thoughts would compel utterance; and there, with no audience butthe Almighty, I would pour out my soul’s complaint, in my rude way, with anapostrophe to the moving multitude of ships.Then, perhaps gazing through the wintry window in Lynn, Douglass shifts andspeaks directly to the ships, trying to reenter a teenager’s imagination:You are loosed from your moorings and are free; I am fast in my chains, and am aslave! You move merrily before the gentle gale, and I sadly before the bloodywhip! You are freedom’s swift-winged angels, that fly around the world; I amconfined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O that I were on one of yourgallant decks and under your protecting wing! Alas, betwixt me and you, theturbid waters roll.28 [notes.html#ch4fn_28a]In such a prose poem, Douglass wrote a psalmlike prayer of deliverance in hisNarrative, rendering in the music of words the meaning of slavery’s potential todestroy the human spirit, but at the same time transcending his rememberedmisery to declare at the end of the lament, in language reminiscent of the slavespirituals, that “there is a better day coming.” Before ending this meditation,as though bracing his face and body to a sudden wind off the Bay, he declaredthat he would one day “take to the water” and bravely steer “a north-eastcourse.”29 [notes.html#ch4fn_29a] He would indeed one day toss his tears uponthat sea and dream his way back to and out of Baltimore. And in the decadebefore the Civil War, as today, his readers could and can still stand withDouglass in the dark night of his soul along their own Chesapeakes and sense thedeepest of human yearnings in their own souls.One day in the terrible heat of August, Frederick broke down physically whilethreshing wheat in the hot sun with other slaves. He fell into a deliriousstupor, experiencing what modern medicine would call heat exhaustion or stroke.With terrible head pain, his limbs trembling, and likely a dangerous fever fromlack of water, the clammy-skinned youngster crawled to a post and rail fence forshade. The wheat fanning stopped, and Covey came out to the scene, demandingthat Frederick stand up. Douglass remembers that he could not speak and thatCovey kicked him savagely in the ribs. Then he beat the youngster about the headwith a hickory stick, leaving a bleeding gash. As Covey joined the work crew,replacing Frederick, the stumbling slave regained his feet and fled into thewoods. There, in fear and exhaustion, he resolved to walk through the nighttimeforest back to St. Michaels to plead his case before his owner, Thomas Auld.30[notes.html#ch4fn_30a]Barefoot through “bogs and briers,” staying off the roads so as to avoid Coveyif he pursued him, Frederick made it to Auld’s store that night. With bloodclotted on his head and his torn shirt bloodstained, the ragged supplicantbegged for Auld’s protection. Auld paced the floor, refused to believe most ofFrederick’s horror story, and ridiculed him as the perpetrator of his owntravail. The master ordered his slave to go back to serve out the remainingmonths of his term, lest Auld “lose the whole year’s wages.” With this lesson inslaveholders’ avarice, Douglass stayed the night and, without food the nextmorning, made the seven-mile trek back to Covey’s dreaded lair. “Broken inspirit,” what did Douglass ponder as he stumbled back to a fate of more abuse?Did he think of Father Lawson and wonder if any God existed? Did he feel aloneliness in his bones far greater than the pains in his injured body? Did heimagine with near-homicidal scorn a picture of Auld and Covey in their Methodistpews, praying for good crops, healthy families, and the warrant of their ownsalvation? Was his mind simply lost in contemplations of the sheer scale andweight of injustice? Did he try to pray, with only tearful false starts andwasted sentence fragments for his efforts? All this and more, he implied, hisbludgeoned mind thought and his body felt as he walked.31 [notes.html#ch4fn_31a]For now, he could not even see the sailing ships if they leaped off the oceanwaves.As soon as Covey saw Frederick step over a fence rail, the tyrant pursued himwith a whip and a rope. The young man fled again into a field of tall corn,where he hid. The “ferocious hound,” as Douglass called Covey, could not findhim, likely expecting that his slave would ultimately return again out ofhunger. Frederick found temporary safety in the woods, where the weary fugitivelay down on a bed of leaves, “shut in with nature, and nature’s God.” Confusedand frightened during the night, he encountered a fellow slave, Sandy Jenkins,who was walking several miles to visit his wife, a free black woman. Jenkins toohad been hired out for the year, and he took pity on the desperate younger manand, at considerable risk, ushered him to his humble home. Sandy’s wife helpedFrederick to wash his scarred and bloody body and fed him a freshly bakedashcake. Douglass remembered this human touch, “relieving a brother bondman,” asa saving grace in the midst of his torment. In 1855 he called this moment atSandy’s cabin “the meal, of all my life, most sweet to my taste, and now mostvivid in my memory.” Before departing the next morning, Sandy, who fashionedhimself a spiritual adviser and, to anguished Frederick, seemed “a genuineAfrican,” gave the runaway a special “root” to wear only on his right side forprotection as he returned to Covey’s domain. Unmoved by the logic of Sandy’s“magical powers,” Douglass nevertheless decided he had nothing to lose and worethe talisman as instructed.32 [notes.html#ch4fn_32a]More in line with his own self-understanding and portrayal, though, Douglassattributed much of Jenkins’s kindness toward him to the neighborhood knowledgeof his literacy. Claiming he was the only slave in the region who could read andwrite, Douglass preferred to wear his learning rather than a conjurer’s herbsfrom the forest floor. “Although I was hated by Covey and by my master,”Douglass maintained, “I was loved by the colored people, because they thought Iwas hated for my knowledge, and persecuted because I was feared.” Always readyto offer himself as a symbol of the power of the word and of the will, henevertheless admitted that in this desperate summer night, his Good Samaritanhad a strong case. “My book learning,” he remembered Sandy telling him, “had notkept Covey off me, (a powerful argument just then).”33 [notes.html#ch4fn_33a]It was a Sunday morning as Frederick once again came into Covey’s yard, and thepious slave driver said good morning on his way to church services. Covey didnot beat slaves on the Sabbath. Monday morning was another matter; what ensuedwas the most celebrated fight between a master and a slave in all of antislaveryliterature. For the elaborate details of this rumble in a stable and a farmyard,which Douglass claimed lasted for two hours, the autobiographer is our onlysource. He wrote of it with an odd formality, as though he were the observercleaning up a deadly blood sport for sentimental readers. Whatever the durationand nature of this violent melee, for Douglass it grew into the pivotal turningpoint in his life as a slave. Slaves who resisted and fought their masterssometimes did not live to tell about it, or at least found themselves in transitto a worse fate farther south. Covey caught Douglass by surprise coming downfrom a hayloft and tried to tie his legs. In language that became melodramaticand moralistic, even if blow by blow and full of bravado, Douglass neverthelessadmitted that he did not at first know from “whence came the daring spirit” andhis “fighting madness.” Douglass claimed to have fought “strictly on thedefensive,” which does not ring true. Covey became flustered, even “frightened,”with much “puffing and blowing.” He called on two other slaves to help him graband hold Frederick; but the rebel kicked one of them into agonized submissionand the other simply refused and comically said he just wished to work. The twogrunting fighters grappled and threw each other on the ground. Douglass says hestrangled Covey by the throat, drawing blood with his nails, and his tormentorsimply gave up.34 [notes.html#ch4fn_34a]As one scholar has suggested, Douglass wrote of this fight as though it were “aperformance, a staged and ritualized battle” in this master-slave drama. Anotherhistorian has called the fight a stylized “death dance.” It also later servedthe former slave’s story as the establishment of his manhood by ritualizedviolence. “I was nothing before,” he wrote, “I was a MAN NOW.” As he told of itover and over in public forums later, he portrayed his victory over Covey as thedemonstration of the physical force necessary for male dignity and power. He hadbested the tyrant; he now possessed an inner freedom and an outward pride. “Itwas a resurrection from the dark and pestiferous tomb of slavery,” Douglasssaid, “to the heaven of comparative freedom.” He convinced himself, not withoutreason, that Covey exacted no public or legal retribution (Frederick could havebeen arrested, tried, and hanged for such resistance) because of a coward’sshame and fear for his reputation. The wounded boy was now a man who could lifthis head high and tell the world that old Covey never again laid a hand on himin his remaining months in that country prison. Most of all, embedded in all thetalk of manhood, he admitted that his spirit, all but lost in the woods thosedespairing nights, could now revive; the defeat of Covey, he said,“rekindled . . . my Baltimore dreams.”35 [notes.html#ch4fn_35a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 5--------------------------------------------------------------------------------NOW FOR MISCHIEF!No man can tell the intense agony which is felt by the slave, when wavering onthe point of making his escape. All that he has is at stake. . . . The lifewhich he has may be lost, and the liberty which he seeks may not be gained.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1845Douglass likely never forgot the sensation of his hands gripping Covey’s throat,his fingernails drawing blood, as he strangled the slave master. Whether ithappened or not as Douglass later described it, the feeling became real inmemory. By January 1, 1835, after spending the annual holiday week watching, andimbibing, with the rest of the slaves in the St. Michaels region as theyfrolicked, danced, and drank their days away with their masters’ approvals,Frederick Bailey was ready for more “rational” sensations.1[notes.html#ch5fn_1a] He was once again hired out by Auld for a year to anotherlocal farmer, William Freeland, whose land fronted on the Miles River.As Douglass endlessly explained the nature of slavery to public audiences laterin the 1840s, a major theme of his writing and speeches was the slaveholders’mentality, their quest not only for control of the bondman’s body, but moreimportant, “to destroy his thinking powers.” By temperament and apparentlystrategy, Freeland, who did not even attend church and practiced leniency aboutfood, labor routines, and general emotional autonomy among his slaves, allowedFrederick more space and time to think, read, and, as it turned out, toclandestinely teach. Freeland did not beat his slaves; though his soil wasworn-out from too much tobacco husbandry, his tools were much better than most,and he was a fair broker with his slaves’ need for rest. Frederick likedFreeland, especially in contrast to his previous year of suffering under Covey.Douglass’s mind, he recollected, gained “increased sensibility.” In Bondage andFreedom, he drew beautifully upon 1 Corinthians to say that the “natural” and“temporal” in human needs come first, and “afterward that which is spiritual.”He later mused in memoirs and speeches about how his time with Freeland taughthim that when a slave gets a “good” master, it makes him only wish “to becomehis own master.”2 [notes.html#ch5fn_2a]Frederick had gained a reputation in the region because of the fight with Covey;and his literacy made him a special seventeen-year-old among a mostly oldergroup of male slaves who became his beloved “band of brothers” on Freeland’splace. Douglass “loved” (a word he sparingly used in remembering his slaveryyears) especially four young men: brothers Henry Harris and John Harris, HandyCaldwell, and Sandy Jenkins (the root man), now working on the same farmsteadwith Frederick. As Douglass set up this scene of mental liberation amid a groupof trusted comrades, he delivered a clever jolt of foreshadowing. “Now forMischief!” he declared. “I had not been long at Freeland’s before I was up to myold tricks.”3 [notes.html#ch5fn_3a]• • •Quickly that winter and into summer, Frederick gathered eventually more thanthirty male slaves on Sundays, and sometimes even on weeknights, in a Sabbathliteracy school. He may have constructed the Covey fight as his resurrectionfrom a living death into “manhood,” but Douglass’s real manhood, his realvocation, emerged here in his leadership among a cherished group of eagerlearners and fellow dreamers. Here on the farm of a “just” slaveholder, indowntime from working as a field hand, the future Frederick Douglass found hisfirst abolitionist flock. Here “in the woods, behind the barn, and in the shadeof trees,” Frederick discovered his charisma and burnished his love of words.“The fact is, here I began my public speaking,” he later wrote. With TheColumbian Orator in his hands, which he had somehow kept hidden from the Coveysand Aulds in his life, and with a Webster’s spelling book and a copy of theBible, Frederick, now tall and with an adult’s deeper voice, stood before theseyoung men and preached the power of literacy as the means to freedom. Under anold live oak on the Eastern Shore on summer Sabbaths, practicing gestures withhis arms and shoulders, and modulating the sounds and cadences of his words asThe Columbian Orator instructed, the greatest antislavery orator of thenineteenth century first found his voice.4 [notes.html#ch5fn_4a] One wonders ifbefore any of his thousands of speeches and appearances later in life, as helistened to someone drone on introducing him, or as he stepped to a lectern, afleeting memory of his oak-tree congregations danced in his mind.Image [../images/f0059-01.jpg]Sherwood Forest (Freeland Farm). Douglass lived and worked in these fields,1835–36. Aerial view, c. 1930.Douglass loved his days and nights teaching his fellow slaves. “I have hadvarious employments during my short life,” he wrote in 1855, “but I look back tonone with more satisfaction, than to that afforded by my Sunday school.”Douglass’s autobiographical writing is often extremely self-centered, drawinghard boundaries around his sole character—himself as the melodramatic self-madehero. But his remembrance of the Sabbath school is one time when he expressed anabiding love, an “attachment deep and lasting,” for his supporting cast.Frederick was the leader now of a local brotherhood, unlike anything he hadknown before, a gang of word lovers and emerging readers. They were “braveand . . . fine looking” as a group. He had never known other such friends in hislife to the age of thirty-seven, as he rhapsodized in 1855. “No band of brotherscould have been more loving.” They had secret passwords for group protection intheir risky business; and what they especially possessed was a sense of amale-bonded home in their wilderness of work and hopelessness. For Frederick’sbursting spirit, “these were great days to my soul.”5 [notes.html#ch5fn_5a]In the midst of these clandestine adventures in literacy and comradeship,Frederick and his four closest friends launched an escape plot. At the beginningof 1836, Freeland rented Frederick for yet one more year of labor. Douglasslater portrayed himself as glad to stay on Freeland’s place; he could continuehis teaching and building of his band of readers as he turned eighteen yearsold. But he also, perhaps quite honestly, remembered himself as “not onlyashamed to be contented, but ashamed to seem contented.” Frederick felt a newlevel of despondency, the kind born of the same increased liberty to think,speak, and create the “intense desire . . . to be free” in his devotedcompatriots as he had felt at a younger age in Baltimore. He left many hauntingexpressions of this longing in the mind of a slave reaching adulthood with animprisoned mind. “The grim visage of slavery,” he wrote on behalf of all slaves,“can assume no smiles which can fascinate the partially enlightened slave into aforgetfulness of his bondage.”6 [notes.html#ch5fn_6a]In a combination of providential, psychological, and even military language,Douglass told of his escape plot that nearly ended his abolitionist careerbefore it started. “The prophecies of my childhood were still unfulfilled,” heclaimed in retrospect. As he remembered Father Lawson’s words (predicting God’spurposes in Douglass’s rise in the world), Frederick believed that at eighteenhe had grown “too big for my chains.” His group of five conspirators plottedtheir backwater rebellion like a tiny military company, with Frederick as theircaptain, always watching his own “deportment, lest the enemy should get thebetter of me.” Just before the Easter holiday in the spring of 1836, theyplanned to steal away into Chesapeake Bay in a large canoe owned by WilliamHambleton, whose large estate bordered Freeland’s farm (Douglass mistakenlycalls him Hamilton in the autobiographies), rowing their way north some seventymiles to the head of the Bay, and then trekking by foot overland to the freestate of Pennsylvania. Wildly ambitious and based on inadequate geographicknowledge, the plot had little hope of success, although they could visualizethemselves out on the Bay claiming either to be fishermen working for theirmasters, or slaves allowed the holiday week off from labor. Frederick employedhis literacy now to a political end for the first time—he wrote a “pass” foreach member of the band, authorizing him to spend the Easter holiday inBaltimore, and signed W.H.7 [notes.html#ch5fn_7a] These desperate young mendecided to steel their nerves in group solidarity, in songs, in their secretmeetings and handshakes, and in their faith in their youthful leader, who stooderect over their battlements and strove for the right words of resolve.Their bravado, however, had to coexist with fear. Frederick and his team met bynight around their quarters and on Sundays out in arbors. The eighteen-year-oldplayed the commanding officer of the platoon preparing for war; he argued forthe plan against all its admittedly logical obstacles—what he called “phantomsof trouble.” He cajoled, instilled spirit when they needed it, drew mentalpictures of hope when they all felt desperation, and tried “to instill all withfirmness.” But Frederick’s pep talks did not suffice. In his autobiography,Douglass later presented this episode brilliantly as a journey into thepsychology of the runaway slave. Fred Bailey may have enjoyed his role as theband’s leader by words and personality, but he shared their sense ofpsychological terror about betrayal and capture.8 [notes.html#ch5fn_8a]As they “rehearsed” for their fateful day of flight out of “Egypt,” Douglassremembered, they could preen and swagger for one another one moment, and thenext, the Harris brothers might just stare in silent dread into Frederick’seyes, awaiting his next direction. “We were confident, bold and determined attimes,” wrote Douglass; “and, again, doubting, timid and wavering; whistlinglike the boy in the graveyard, to keep away the spirits.” When they sang tosteady their nerves, a favorite hymn rang out:O Canaan, sweet Canaan.I am bound for the land of Canaan,I thought I heard them say,There were lions in the way,I don’t expect to stayMuch longer here.Run to Jesus—shun the danger—I don’t expect to stayMuch longer here.Douglass hastened to point out that for his band of runaways, it was not heaventhey sought just then; “the north was our Canaan.”9 [notes.html#ch5fn_9a]But what about those lions? They could not sing them away. Nine years later,Douglass left a probing statement of the recurring dream/nightmare of therunaway slave, as though he wanted to tear apart the romance of the UndergroundRailroad and replace it with a vision of the fugitive slave’s real psychic hell.“At every gate through which we were to pass,” he wrote on behalf of hiscomrades and every other bold runaway, “we saw a watchman—at every ferry aguard—on every bridge a sentinel—and in every wood a patrol.” The options facedby the runaway came from deep in historical time, from the ancient circumstanceof the oppressed choosing life or death against the overwhelming weapons of thepowerful. “On the one hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaringfrightfully upon us,” wrote Douglass as dramatist of the macabre, “its robesalready crimsoned with the blood of millions, and even now feasting itselfgreedily upon our own flesh. On the other hand, away back in the dim distance,under the flickering light of the north star, behind some craggy hill orsnow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom—half frozen—beckoning us to comeand share its hospitality.” Why tempt such a “monster” infesting their thoughts?On every side, they saw “grim death” in “horrid shapes.” They saw themselvesdrowned in the ocean, their bodies torn by bloodhounds. After thuscharacterizing the mind of the fugitive slave, Douglass went to Shakespeare’sHamlet and allowed his comrades the moment to “rather bear those ills we had,than to fly to others, that we knew not of.” But they could still somehow seethat distant hill. Then Douglass invoked Patrick Henry’s famous “Give Me Libertyor Give Me Death” speech from the American Revolution and claimed that theAmerican slave rebel’s right to this bold resolution was “more sublime” than anyby one of the founding fathers. The “lash and chain” had bought thatprivilege.10 [notes.html#ch5fn_10a]So, brave but terrified, Frederick and his small band awoke on their prospectiveday of deliverance, Saturday, April 2, 1836. They had packed little bags andgone to the field to do their early-morning work—spreading manure. Their plotfell into disaster almost immediately. They had been betrayed (Douglass laterthought probably by Sandy Jenkins, who had withdrawn from the plot in torturedanxiety). As they gathered at the kitchen near Freeland’s house, Frederick spiedfour white men on horseback, and two blacks walking with them, coming down thelong lane into the property. Then came the aging and rotund William Hambletonriding at a gallop. After a brief consultation between Freeland and Hambleton,within seconds the constables seized Frederick and tied his arms with rope. Thenthey moved to the Harrises; John was subdued and tied, but Henry physicallyresisted, refusing to allow his hands to be tied by these men, who were armed.One constable drew his pistol, cocked it, and aimed it point-blank at Henry’sbreast. “Shoot me! Shoot me!” shouted Henry in defiance. “You can’t kill me butonce. Shoot!—shoot! and be d__d. I won’t be tied.” Then the whole groupassaulted Henry, drove him to the ground, and subdued him in ropes. While allwere distracted, Frederick threw his pass into the kitchen fire; later heinstructed the others to eat theirs.11 [notes.html#ch5fn_11a]In Freeland’s front yard, the four bound young men were fastened with ropes tothree horses, guarded by the mounted constables, and prodded off on afifteen-mile forced march to the county jail in Easton. Before departure, Mrs.Betsey Freeland, the landowner’s mother and Hambleton’s sister, who hadlong-standing affection for the Harris brothers, railed at Frederick as thecorrupter of the innocent. “You devil!” she screamed at him. “It was you who putinto the heads of Henry and John to run away. But for you, you long leggedyellow devil, Henry and John would never have thought of running away!”Douglass, the bound prisoner, met her gaze, he says, with a look that matchedher wrath. After three miles the coffle stopped in St. Michaels at Thomas Auld’sstore, where Frederick’s owner interrogated and berated him. But Douglass tellsus that he defied and responded to Auld in kind with a lawyerlike argument thatno crime had been committed, no evidence existed, and logically no one had anycase against him, except for the words of a betrayer. Then the journey resumedon the dusty road to Easton.12 [notes.html#ch5fn_12a]All along the roadway, through little hamlets called Spencer’s Cove, Royal Oak,Kirkham, and Miles Ferry, crowds of what Douglass called “moral vultures”gathered to jeer, shout epithets, and indulge in “ribaldry” at the expense ofthe slave prisoners. Some yelled that Frederick should be hanged or burned. Suchan event in rural slave country made for a spectacular break in routines and afeast for lurid rumors. Some slaves in fields, said Douglass, “cautiouslyglanced at us through the post-and-rail fences.” Fear spread like the fastestwind when slave rebellions or runaways were thwarted; the eye contact Frederickmay have managed with his fellow slaves only made the mutual dread morecontagious. Upon arrival after hours of travel, the coffle was untied andinterrogated. Frederick had urged the others to deny everything, like thefledgling revolutionaries they had tried to be. “Own nothing!” had been theirleader’s command while on the march.They were placed in the stone jailhouse on the rear of the Talbot Countycourthouse, which still stands today. Behind heavy locks, bars, and ironlatticework on the windows, for the first week of captivity the prisoners bondedagain in their assumed fate—sale separately to the Deep South. They peeredthrough the windows, wishing they could speak to one of the white-coated blackwaiters across the street at Solomon Lowe’s Hotel. Like a “pack of fiends, freshfrom perdition,” slave traders, eager for new flesh for the Southern markets,lurked about the jail, taunting the prisoners and feeling their arms, legs, andshoulders to judge their fitness. This constituted the Eastern Shore’s activedomestic slave trade, about to feed four new pieces of property down its troughgreased with filthy lucre. Later, Douglass did not miss a beat in using thesedaily encounters with slave traders to show that, however much detested bypolite society in the slave South, these “whiskey-bloated gamblers in humanflesh” were necessary to the master class’s profit and expansion. The slaveowner and the slave trader, declared Douglass, were partners in “blasphemy andblood.”13 [notes.html#ch5fn_13a]Image [../images/f0074-01.jpg]The Talbot County courthouse. In the rear of this building Douglass was held injail for two weeks after his aborted escape plan in 1836. Today his statuestands out front, unveiled in 2011. Postcard by Marian L. Covey, c. 1910.At the end of that first week in jail, Freeland and Hambleton arrived to extractthe other three young men and take them back to their farms without anypunishment. In this dreaded separation from his friends, Fred Bailey felt a“solitary . . . desolation.” As ringleader, he now felt certain Auld would atany time arrive to sell him to Alabama or Georgia. For seven more lonely daysFrederick fended off the probing hands and the insults of the traders and felt avolcano of rage and a numbing loneliness rising in him. When his tense andindecisive owner finally showed up, to Frederick’s great surprise Auld haddecided not to sell his slave, but to send him back to Baltimore with thepromise that for good behavior, and learning a trade, Auld would free him on histwenty-fifth birthday. This moment may easily have been the greatest stroke ofgood luck in Douglass’s life, and he seems to have known it. Auld could havesent him “into the very everglades of Florida,” wrote Douglass of this turningpoint, “beyond the remotest hope of emancipation; and his refusal to exercisethat power must be set down to his credit.”14 [notes.html#ch5fn_14a] After manyweeks of deadly mischief, of hope sublime and fear unbearable, the wretchedimprisonment and humiliation, Fred Bailey must have found a little skip in hisstep as he realized he would once again see those clipper ships in Baltimoreharbor.Why did Thomas Auld send Frederick back to Baltimore at age eighteen? How or whydid he resist the $800 or more he might have pocketed on the sale of his slaveto the cotton kingdom? Certainly his wife, Rowena, who detested Frederick, wouldhave craved the money from the young rebel’s sale. The Freelands could now viewFrederick only as dangerous and would have wanted him out of the neighborhood.And William Hambleton, Auld’s own father-in-law, apparently told Auld in nouncertain terms that he would shoot the young man if he was not sold out ofTalbot County. Douglass later learned from his cousin Tom Bailey that Auldfretted a great deal over his decision and “walked the floor nearly all night”before going to the Easton jail to retrieve Frederick. Perhaps his Christianconversion and a personal disdain for the vulturelike slave traders at theEaston jail played some role as well in Auld’s choice. According to Douglass,Auld blustered for a day or two back in St. Michaels that he had an “Alabamafriend” to whom he planned to sell Frederick. But the fictitious Alabamian nevershowed up. Auld may have hoped that as Frederick learned a trade, profits mightbe made from his labor in Baltimore. But it also appears that emotionally, Auld,whether because of extended family blood ties or out of watching this brilliantyoung rascal grow up for eighteen years, just could not bring himself to sellFrederick to a doomed fate. Auld had done Fred Bailey an extraordinarily goodturn; it would be a long time before Frederick Douglass would fairly recognizethe deed.15 [notes.html#ch5fn_15a]• • •Frederick had left Baltimore three years earlier as an awkward, despondent,long-legged boy; he returned in 1836 an approximately six-feet-one-inch,well-built young man, firm and strengthened by more than two years as a fieldhand, and, above all, more confident in mind and body. To Frederick, Baltimorewas warmly familiar at first, but also greatly changed. The turbulent,increasingly violent city teemed with huge numbers of new Irish immigrantlaborers. The free black population had rapidly risen to more than fifteenthousand, with an active community of churches and associations, while slavesnumbered only just under four thousand. The Aulds had moved to Fells Street,just past the Shakespeare Alley, but still near the burgeoning docks andshipyards. Hugh’s fortunes had eroded; he lost his own shipbuilding firm and wasnow working as a foreman in another yard. Grown to near manhood, Tommy Auld hadgone to sea as a sailor aboard a brig called the Tweed, never to be seenagain.16 [notes.html#ch5fn_16a]To bring in wages for himself, and to teach the slave a trade as a caulker, HughAuld hired out Frederick to William Gardiner’s shipyard, where the big builderemployed at least one hundred men on breakneck schedules to fulfill a contractto construct two men-of-war for the Mexican government. The Gardiner yard was anexciting, and dangerous, place. Most of the carpenters were white, some werefree blacks, and among the apprentices running about frantically at the beck andcall of the older workers, Frederick may have been the only black. With allmanner of racist taunts, white carpenters barked orders at Frederick: “Fred,come carry this timber yonder”; “Fred, bring that roller here”; “Fred! Run andbring me a cold chisel.” All day long the young man tried to answer to “Halloonigger,” and “Say darkey,” while doing every nasty job at an impossible pace.For eight months, wrote Douglass, this provided the “school” in which he learnedthe trade of caulker.17 [notes.html#ch5fn_17a]In this ugly racial atmosphere, and with Frederick now hardly willing to backdown to anyone, the young white apprentices turned on him. “The niggers,” theysaid within his hearing, were taking white men’s jobs and should be banished.One day Frederick snapped after being cursed at by a large white fellow namedEdward North; Frederick grabbed the white worker, wrestled him to a dock, andthrew him in the water. Now a street fighter of necessity and perhaps somerelish, Douglass later claimed he could handle any of these toughs “singly.” Buthe also found more mischief than he had bargained for. While pounding bolts intothe hold of a ship, one bent, and a white worker named Ned immediately next tohim shouted that it was Fred’s fault; Fred took offense and blamed the whiteman. The two of them each grabbed weapons, Ned an adze (an arc-bladed hand ax),and Fred a maul, and after lunging at each other with vicious intent, theysuddenly stopped before one of them ended up dead. One day four of the whiteapprentices, whom Douglass later named—Ned North, Ned Hays, Bill Stewart, andTom Humphreys—pounced on him with a brick and a “heavy hand-spike.” They beathim to the ground, and one of them landed a savage kick to his face, smashinghis left eye, “which for a time, seemed to have burst my eyeball.” WithFrederick bloodied all over, his eye swollen closed, the group seemed satisfied;but he staggered to his feet, and waving a handspike, ran after them as theyfled.18 [notes.html#ch5fn_18a]When Frederick limped home to the Aulds’ house, they met him with sympathy andoutrage at his accidents. Sophia cried and tenderly nursed his wounds. Thefollowing day the enraged Hugh took Frederick to a justice of the peace to seekredress and arrests of the young men who had beaten his slave. But “EsquireWatson” could do nothing, he reported, without white witnesses; by law inMaryland, no black person could testify against a white person. Auld tended tofollow the strictures of the slave codes, but in this case he fruitlesslyprotested. Douglass placed his memory of this event in a larger story of the new“murderous . . . spirit” of Baltimore; the city no longer provided a place ofcosmopolitan dreams for a slave, especially since at least fifty white men hadwatched his beating, lifting no hand to stop it, as they shouted, “Kill thenigger!”19 [notes.html#ch5fn_19a] When, less than six years later, we findDouglass tilting under the weighted strictures of his fellow abolitionists’pacifism, we need only remember these bloody Baltimore fights and his experiencein the proslavery criminal justice system to understand his ambivalence. Abrawler of necessity, he would ultimately find philosophical nonviolenceuntenable.Hugh removed Frederick from Gardiner’s for his safety and got him work atPrice’s shipyard, where Auld was himself a foreman. There Frederick would learnwell the craft of caulker and begin to take in from $6 to $9 per week. In thishothouse atmosphere of violence, racism, and embittered economic competitionamong an insecure working class, Frederick Bailey learned even deeper lessonsabout the natural struggle between labor and capital. In Bondage and Freedom,Douglass gave the economics of urban slavery and Southern race relations anastute analysis. Despite that thuggish white dockworkers had beaten and nearlykilled him, Douglass keenly grasped the plight of the white poor. In their“craftiness,” wrote Douglass, urban slaveholders and shipyard owners forged an“enmity of the poor, laboring white man against the blacks,” forcing anembittered scramble for diminished wages, and rendering the white worker “asmuch a slave as the black slave himself.” Both were “plundered, and by the sameplunderer.” The “white slave” and the “black slave” were both robbed, one by asingle master, and the other by the entire slave system. The slaveholding classexploited the lethal tools of racism to convince the burgeoning immigrant poor,said Douglass, that “slavery is the only power that can prevent the laboringwhite man from falling to the level of the slave’s poverty and degradation.”Douglass imagined a time when white and black carpenters had worked peacefullyside by side in the Fell’s Point shipyards. He wrongly predicted that all these“injurious consequences” sowed by the master class would one day inspire thewhite non-slaveholding poor to rise in solidarity with slaves.20[notes.html#ch5fn_20a] As later in his career, Douglass’s economic analysiscould alternate between astute and naïve, but he certainly understood classconsciousness.With historical distance, Douglass found sincere sympathy for those poor whiteworkers who had pummeled and kicked him. But back in 1837–38, trying to garnerwages as a hired slave, he kept his fists clinched. His stories have become soiconic today that the scene has even appeared in a major work of literature, Seaof Poppies (2008), by Amitav Ghosh. Ghosh tells an epic tale of a ship, theIbis, built originally in Gardiner’s shipyard in Baltimore and used in theillegal slave trade, heading out around the Horn of Africa for a voyage into theIndian Ocean. Aboard is a young seaman, a mulatto American freedman namedZachery Reid. After months at sea and much sickness and death among the crew,Zachery’s mind “travels aback across the oceans to his last day at Gardiner’sshipyard in Baltimore.” He sees again “a face with a burst eyeball, the scalptorn open where a hand-spike had landed, the dark skin slick with blood.” In hisvision, Zachery sees “the encirclement of Freddy Douglass, set upon by fourwhite carpenters; he remembered the howls, ‘kill him, kill the damned nigger!’ ”He recalled how he and the other free black workers had “held back, their handsstayed by fear.” Zachery hears “Freddy’s voice” in his head, “not reproachingthem [his fellow black workers] for not coming to his defense, but urging themto leave, scatter: ‘It’s about jobs; the whites won’t work with you, freeman orslave: keeping you out is their way of saving their bread.’ ” It was then, saysGhosh, that Zachery quit the shipyard and went to sea.21 [notes.html#ch5fn_21a]In 1837 “Freddy” was still yearning to get out of those shipyards himself.In the relative safety of Price’s shipyard, Frederick found better days in 1837and 1838; he began to read again, and most important, he joined in the life ofthe large free black community of Baltimore, especially a debating and socialorganization, the East Baltimore Mental Improvement Society. Here Frederickcould let down his guard and employ his favorite weapons—words, and the growingcharisma he cultivated while using them. He “was living among freemen,” herecollected, and resented every aspect of his slave status against the lives ofhis free friends, especially the necessity of depositing most of his wages withHugh Auld every Saturday night. Frederick chafed under such brutalcontradictions. At nineteen and soon twenty years old, his future made no senseto him: “Why should I be a slave?” he recalled thinking. “There was no reasonwhy I should be in the thrall of any man.” Frederick made fast friends among anew band of brothers, especially five—James Mingo, William E. Lloyd, WilliamChester, Joseph Lewis, and Henry Rolles. Sometimes they met in Mingo’s “oldframe house in Happy Alley” and debated racial, religious, and political issues.One of them, Lloyd, wrote to Douglass in 1870, remembering that one nightFrederick waxed so excited with his oratory that “you told me you never meant tostop until you got into the United States Senate.”22 [notes.html#ch5fn_22a] FredBailey’s speaking career began first on Freeland’s farm and then in Happy Alleyin Baltimore.At one of the social gatherings of the debating society, or perhaps as likely atthe Sharp Street AME Church, which Frederick joined, he met a young,dark-skinned free woman who liked music named Anna Murray. Anna was born in oraround 1813, near Denton, in Caroline County, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore,within three miles or so of where Frederick was born. Their childhoods may haveoverlapped for a year or so in this region known as the Tuckahoe Neck; they kneweach other’s families, although Anna’s had been more intact, and they had playedat the same mill and wandered as kids in and out of Hillsborough. Anna was theseventh of twelve children born to Bambarra and Mary Murray, both slaves; butbecause of the manumission of her mother, Anna was the first born free. At ageseventeen, likely in 1830 or 1831, while Fred Bailey was twelve or thirteen andliving with Hugh and Sophia Auld, reading the Bible with Father Lawson, andcombing through his Columbian Orator, Anna, with three siblings, Elizabeth,Philip, and Charlotte, moved to Baltimore to find work and a better life thanwhat the right bank of the Tuckahoe offered. For two years Anna found employmentas a housekeeper for a French family named Montell. Then, perhaps for as long asfive years, she served the family of Mr. Wells, the postmaster of Baltimore, wholived on S. Caroline Street, only a half dozen or so blocks straight abovePhilpot and Thames, where Frederick lived during his years in the city.23[notes.html#ch5fn_23a]Dressed likely in a drab white or gray calico dress and apron by day, Anna mayhave donned a special head scarf and a prettier dress on whatever day or eveningshe met the strapping nineteen- or twenty-year-old brainy slave from the EasternShore. They may have known each other simply from passing in the streets, butwhen they met, they must have fallen into a long, smiling conversation aboutwhere they were from, the people they knew (each other’s cousins), and storiesof growing up along the Tuckahoe. Finding Frederick was not the only reason Annahad moved to Baltimore as a teenager, but she surely must have thought so now.And Bailey, perhaps still a bit awkward around young women, must have cravedAnna’s admiration, emotional support, and adoring eye contact. She was older,had lived in this free black community for years, and perhaps gave the youngslave some credibility among his new friends. She may have even provided caringadvice on how to take care of his injuries and scars from the rumbles down onthe docks. Somewhere between Caroline and Thames Streets the two fell in loveand discovered they needed each other. Douglass had found a woman who would helphim imagine a new life.Anna worked for her meager wages for the Wells family and as part of aburgeoning group of free black women struggling for domestic-service positionsin white people’s homes. Anna did manage to save some money and owned twofeather beds and other household goods when she became engaged to Frederick; buther daily life was a battle against poverty, paying rent for her lodging, buyingfirewood, always striving to be the efficient and prim housekeeper the Wellsfamily expected. In her twenties, she was one lonely worker who, as historianSeth Rockman aptly wrote, “scraped by on the ‘economy of makeshift.’ ”24[notes.html#ch5fn_24a] Frederick needed a helpmeet with whom to dream and planhis way out of Maryland, and Anna needed a future that might not includecarrying white people’s chamber pots every morning.Frederick absolutely hated Hugh Auld’s “right of the robber” in taking theslave’s earnings. Here Frederick was again, now twenty years old, treated as aboy serving the ends of white people who still owned his body and his labor. Histroubles, he maintained, as ever, were “less physical than mental.” Rememberingthese last months of his time in Baltimore, Douglass penned another gem aboutthe psychology of slave and master: “To make a contented slave, you must make athoughtless one. It is necessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and asfar as possible, to annihilate his power of reason. . . . The slave must know noHigher Law than his master’s will . . . if there be one crevice through which asingle drop can fall, it will certainly rust off the slave’s chains.”Frederick’s chains had long since rusted into powder, and a mental and pecuniarytug-of-war now ensued between Auld and his slave that forced the young man to adesperate flight for freedom. In the spring of 1838, Frederick and Hugh made adeal, allowing the slave to take his own lodgings, hire his own time, and keepany wages above $3 per week. From May until August 1838, Frederick worked hard,bought his own caulking tools, and forged more personal time to, perhaps underAnna’s influence, take up music at church. Above all, work itself now seemed toequate with liberty.25 [notes.html#ch5fn_25a]Until Frederick went to a camp meeting one Saturday night some twelve miles fromBaltimore and, having a grand time, stayed until Monday, thus missing hispayment time (Saturday night) by forty-eight hours. Upon his return, Auld wasfurious, threatened to whip the grown man, and accused him of plotting to runaway. The owner rescinded Frederick’s “partial freedom”; he could no longer hirehimself and keep part of his wages. Sulking for at least a week, Frederickrefused to go to work at all; Auld, in his fury, verbally abused the lad,threatened beatings, and even sale. With genuine fear that Hugh and Thomas Auldmight indeed finally sell him south, Frederick and Anna, with the assistance ofother free black friends, hatched his escape plot.26 [notes.html#ch5fn_26a]• • •Over the next three weeks, Frederick worked hard down at the yards so as todispel Auld’s suspicion of a scheme. On one Saturday, the spiteful master tookFrederick’s $9 and gave him back a puny twenty-five cents. Between the two ofthem, Frederick and Anna pooled resources to buy him a real train ticket, aswell as the symbolic “fare,” as he wrote, “on the underground railroad.” Hisplan required cunning, courage, and luck, not to mention Anna’s owndevil-may-care bravery and material support. According to family lore, Anna soldone of her feather beds to raise cash for Frederick’s journey. With a terriblesense of “internal excitement and anxiety,” the pain of separation from the onlyfriends he possessed, and memories welling up from the Freeland-farm debacle oftwo years earlier, Frederick searched for someone’s “free papers” to use atvarious checkpoints. A friend from Fell’s Point, a retired black sailor namedStanley, provided the young man with his “sailor’s protection,” a remarkabledocument never to be forgotten with an American eagle at the top of the page.Nothing was fail-safe, and a cautious person would never have attempted thisplot. Frederick obtained clothing to present himself in full “sailor style . . .red shirt and a tarpaulin hat and black cravat, tied in sailor fashion,carelessly and loosely about my neck.” It would be quite a performance; he knewthe language of ships and sea and declared himself ready to “talk sailor like an‘old salt.’ ”27 [notes.html#ch5fn_27a]On the appointed day, Monday, September 3, 1838, Frederick went to work early,then met Anna on the way to the Wilmington and Baltimore train station just afew blocks above the City Dock. With tears and an embrace Anna sent her sailorboy pacing back and forth near the waiting train. So that he would not have toface the scrutiny of a ticket window, Frederick had arranged for his friend anddrayman Isaac Rolles to bring Frederick’s baggage along just as the trainstarted moving; the boy from the bend in the Tuckahoe jumped on the crowdedNegro car and began the most famous escape in the annals of American slavery.28[notes.html#ch5fn_28a]With excited fear, Anna retreated to a workday at the Wells house and to severaldays of anguished waiting for some sign of the good word. What could she havethought? He will make it to a place far north called New York? He will go allthe way to Canada, to worlds way beyond the horizons of Chesapeake Bay? I toowill ride that train to join him somewhere? I will never see him again? He willbe returned within the day in ropes and chains, bloodied, soon to be shippedsouth and out of my life? She too had her bags packed; controlling her outwardemotions, even eating and sleeping, must have seemed impossible. She probablyprayed in all her quiet moments.As the train churned toward Havre de Grace, Maryland, a distance of thirty-sevenmiles to where the Susquehanna River empties into the top of Chesapeake Bay,Frederick encountered his first danger; the gruff conductor meandered throughthe car checking tickets and documents (the sailor Stanley was much darker incomplexion than the mulatto Fred Bailey), but softened in the face of such ayoung sailor, for whom Douglass maintained there was widespread social respect.The conductor barely glanced at that eagle on his document, and the fugitive’ssudden terror subsided. At Havre de Grace passengers boarded a ferry to crossthe Susquehanna; Frederick had to do his nervous best to shake a young blackboat worker who kept up a steady questioning of the well-attired sailor’sorigins and destinations. Now, for approximately another thirty-seven miles,half through Maryland and half through Delaware, slave states, the train trudgedon. “Minutes were hours, and hours were days,” Douglass recalled of his drama.“The heart of no fox or deer, with hungry hounds on his trail,” said theautobiographer, had ever beat “more anxiously or noisily.” At a stop, Fredericklooked out his window and immediately next to him in the opposite window of atrain heading in the other direction was a ship’s captain named McGowan, onwhose revenue cutter the young caulker had just worked the week before. He knewMcGowan would recognize him, but the captain never turned his head or made eyecontact. Then Douglass encountered a German blacksmith he knew from theBaltimore shipyards, who looked him over knowingly but thankfully “had no heartto betray me.”29 [notes.html#ch5fn_29a]At Wilmington, Delaware, Frederick coyly, if rapidly, walked through town fromthe train station to the wharf, where he boarded a steamboat that soon set outinto the “broad and beautiful Delaware” River. Arriving in Philadelphia in lateafternoon after thirty unmolested miles on the steamer, Frederick walked off thegangplank onto free soil for the first time. He wasted no time in relishing themoment and asked the first safe-looking black man he saw how to find the trainto New York. Directed to the Willow Street station, Edward Covey’s brokenbondsman paid the fare and took the night train up through New Jersey to theHudson River landing and railroad terminus in Hoboken. There, around sunrise onTuesday, September 4, Frederick boarded a ferry that chugged southeasterlyacross the mighty Hudson River to a dock at the end of Chambers Street.30[notes.html#ch5fn_30a] On a bright September morning, with the sounds ofsnapping waves and the shouts of men’s voices along the wharves, HarrietBailey’s lost orphan stepped into the busy streets of New York, wide-eyed,thrilled, and frightened.Douglass later struggled for those magical words to describe his feelings thatspecial morning. “Walking amid the hurrying throng, and gazing upon the dazzlingwonders of Broadway,” he felt the sensation of a “free state around me, and afree earth under my feet! What a moment was this to me! A whole year was pressedinto a single day. A new world burst upon my agitated vision.” But thesesensations stymied this eventual word master, he admitted. They were “toointense and too rapid for words.” He later managed a little poetry nonetheless.“Anguish and grief, like darkness and rain, may be described, but joy andgladness, like the rainbow of promise, defy alike the pen and pencil.” Althoughhe was careful about whom to speak to in those dangerous streets, he rememberedwords from inside his soul like a shout: “I was a FREEMAN, and the voice ofpeace and joy thrilled my heart!”31 [notes.html#ch5fn_31a] On that morning thewords swirling in his head would have been the frightened fragments of afugitive, eyes darting this way and that, wondering which impulse to trust. Ittook some years in the development of his genius with language for Douglass toshape this, and many other parts of his story, into the tale of the ascendantbarefoot slave boy who would go forth and change the world.Hungry and friendless, Frederick soon realized he still stood in “an enemy’sland” and had no time for odes to joy. In reality, Fred Bailey had escapedMaryland slavery with extraordinary bravery, but now he was a disorientedfugitive without any real plan. Numbed by loneliness, he trusted no one; everywhite man appeared as a potential kidnapper, and every black man a possiblebetrayer. He felt like everyone’s “prey” in the great metropolis. Later in hiscareer as he portrayed over and over for abolitionist audiences the experienceof the “panting fugitive,” he knew exactly of what he spoke. For at least oneand possibly two nights, Frederick slept among the barrels at the wharf. By dayhe encountered a fellow fugitive he recognized from Baltimore, known in slaveryas Allender’s Jake. Jake warned Frederick at length about ever-present slavecatchers. Then he met a black sailor named Stewart, to whom he entrusted hisstory, and by whom he was directed to the house of David Ruggles, on 36Lispenard Street at the corner of Church Street, a mere four or five blocks fromthe wharves.32 [notes.html#ch5fn_32a] This was good fortune to rank along sidethe day Thomas Auld decided to send his slave back to Baltimore at age eighteen.Ruggles was a free black grocer, abolitionist, newspaper editor, and especiallythe leader of the New York Vigilance Committee, the organization that openly andclandestinely aided fugitive slaves within and through New York City. From hishouse, Ruggles edited the Mirror of Liberty, America’s first black-owned andoperated magazine, which printed reports of the Vigilance Committee’s legal andillegal work on behalf of runaway slaves. In his house he also maintained anessentially public reading room, with antislavery books and newspapers aplenty.Ruggles, who was just then in and out of court, and for a time under arrest, forhis role in advocating for a Virginia fugitive, Thomas Hughes, who hadaccompanied his owner, John P. Darg, to New York, found time to take the raggedFrederick under his roof and guidance. Here in Ruggles’s reading room, amid theroiling controversy over the life and future of a fellow fugitive, and even atthe courtroom where Frederick attended and witnessed his host’s testimony, theMaryland slave first encountered the exciting and dangerous daily world ofabolitionism.33 [notes.html#ch5fn_33a]Frederick spent at least a full week sheltered at Ruggles’s house. In some idlemoment, his host suggested a speedy name change, and like so many other runawaysseeking anonymity, Frederick decided to become Frederick Johnson. That namewould last only for several days until his later arrival in New Bedford,Massachusetts, where he would take the name Douglass. Most important, as quicklyas possible, Frederick wrote a letter to Anna in Baltimore, which Ruggles mailedfor him. The letter, in a prearrangement, was likely addressed to one of thegood friends Frederick had made in the debating society, who quickly, on orabout September 10, rushed to Anna, who could not read, with the news that shewas to take the train as soon as possible to New York. No one ever recorded ortold the story of Anna’s brave train and steamer journey, also done intwenty-four hours, leaving the only environments she had ever known, abandoningher paying job, to join her lonely, directionless fiancé, to attempt to make alife somewhere up north. But away she went, and according to her daughterRosetta, among the household goods she carried in a trunk was a “plum coloredsilk dress” that, three days after her arrival, on September 15, she wore to bemarried to Frederick Johnson in the small parlor of Ruggles’s home.34[notes.html#ch5fn_34a]To conduct the wedding, Ruggles invited the Reverend James W. C. Pennington, whohad himself escaped from slavery near Rockland, Maryland, in 1827 when, likeFrederick, he was twenty years old. Born James Pembroke, he had run overland andfound shelter with Quakers in Adams County, Pennsylvania, before moving on toNew York and Connecticut. Like other fugitives, he had changed his name, andafter working as a blacksmith, he became a minister, pastoring bothCongregational and Presbyterian churches in New Haven, Connecticut, andBrooklyn, New York. Like Frederick, his residence as a city slave had led to hisdesire to seek learning and freedom. Pennington had vigorously sought admissionto classes at the Yale Divinity School, only to be rejected. James and Frederickhad much to discuss, although it was wedding day, but Douglass left no accountof conversations between the two fugitive slaves. Pennington left Mr. and Mrs.Johnson with a short certificate of their marriage, the text of which Douglassreprinted in the Narrative, as though he needed to display an officialdeclaration of such a human and liberating act as marriage on free soil.35[notes.html#ch5fn_35a]Image [../images/f0085-01.jpg]James W. C. Pennington. Pennington escaped from slavery in Queen Anne’s County,Maryland. Engraving on paper.Sensing that Frederick had no plan other than some vague idea of going toCanada, Ruggles firmly urged the newlyweds to move up the New England coast, toNew Bedford, Massachusetts, a whaling port, where Frederick could find work as acaulker, and the couple would find a welcoming fugitive-slave and free-blackcommunity. Ruggles gave Frederick a $5 bill, and with no further ceremony,Douglass tells us he lifted the larger part of their luggage (which containedhis beloved Columbian Orator and three song booklets) on his shoulder, whileAnna carried the smaller bags, and they strode across lower Manhattan to thedocks to embark on the steamer John W. Richmond. Full of gratitude for DavidRuggles, that “whole-souled man, fully imbued with a love of his afflicted andhunted people,” Frederick had quickly and happily gone from teacher to pupil.36[notes.html#ch5fn_36a] Two strong and courageous black abolitionists had shownhim the way. Holding his intrepid bride’s hand, Frederick stepped beyond threeyears of bloody and beautiful mischief into freedom."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 6--------------------------------------------------------------------------------LIVING A NEW LIFEYes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete; and thepulpit is its prow.—HERMAN MELVILLE, MOBY-DICK, 1851Frederick Bailey had found his passage out, and Frederick Douglass now searchedfor a pulpit. By mid-September 1838, when Frederick and Anna arrived in NewBedford, Massachusetts, they had wrenchingly experienced what Douglass wouldlater call the “upper-ground railroad,” and what the world came to call theUnderground Railroad. They had escaped slave territory to free soil by their ownremarkable bravery, but they had also benefited immensely from the clandestineefforts of David Ruggles and a small network of people to whom Ruggles hadreferred the newlyweds. Still trusting nearly no one, the anxious fugitives werenow armed with at least one letter of introduction as well as other names. Aftertaking the steamer to Newport, Rhode Island, Frederick and Anna rode a stage upthe coast into Massachusetts and arrived exhausted and penniless in the whalingport.1 [notes.html#ch6fn_1a]In New Bedford they were directed immediately to the home of the free blacksNathan and Mary Johnson at 21 Seventh Street. The Johnsons took them into theirthree-story, wood-framed house for the night, paid their stage fare, andwelcomed Frederick and Anna as they had many such fugitives before. NathanJohnson’s origins are not fully known, but he had been involved in creating thegrowing black community in New Bedford, and in assisting fugitive slaves, sinceat least 1822. At breakfast on the morning after Frederick and Anna’s arrival,Johnson urged the Marylanders to choose a new name. Too many Johnsons residedamong the fugitive slaves of New Bedford, as well as in the broader North, saidNathan. Indeed, of the twenty-three Johnsons listed as head of households in theNew Bedford town directory for 1839, twelve were labeled c for “colored.” In hisremembrances, Douglass gives no role to Anna in this decision. He tells us thathe gave his host the privilege of choosing his new last name, but that he dearlywanted to retain Frederick. “I must hold on to that to preserve a sense of myidentity,” wrote Douglass in 1845. Johnson had just been reading Sir WalterScott’s Lady of the Lake, the classic and popular romantic Scottish poem of1810. From the Highlander clan named Douglas, Johnson suggested a new name.Frederick liked the name’s sound and strength as a word, and he quicklyaccepted, adding an s for distinction.2 [notes.html#ch6fn_2a] Thus began thelong process of the most famous self-creation of an African American identity inAmerican history.In both its simplicity and its literary gravitas (Scott was wildly popular inAmerica) Douglass wore his new name with increasing pride. Remembering thischoice of new name in Bondage and Freedom, he referred to his two originalmiddle names (Augustus Washington), given by his mother, as “pretentious.” Asthe literary historian Robert Stepto has remarked, Douglass’s sloughing off ofhis two middle names and the choice of the new surname provided him a kind of“ritual cleansing” of some of his slave “baggage” at this special moment in hisnew beginning. With retrospect, Douglass sighed that any fugitive slave had toadopt various names during his escape to survive because “among honest men anhonest man may well be content with one name, but toward fugitives, Americansare not honest.” And by 1855, he had long since read Lady of the Lake and wasglad to be associated with the “great Scottish chief,” although he acknowledgedthat his New Bedford benefactor, Nathan Johnson, might better represent themilitary “virtues” of Scott’s Highlander hero. “Had any slave-catcher enteredhis [Johnson’s] domicile,” wrote Douglass, “with a view to molest any one of hishousehold, he would have shown himself like him of the ‘stalwart hand.’ ” Thispassage is really about Douglass himself, who had learned and practicedrepeatedly by the mid-1850s the virtues and perils of protecting andtransporting fugitive slaves. He does not tell us just how he incorporated hisnew name into his sense of self during his first years of relative obscurity inNew Bedford. But with time he had clearly breathed some of Scott’s language intohis soul. He wanted to be viewed by his many audiences “Till whispers rose amongthe throng, / That heart so free, and hand so strong, / Must to the Douglasblood belong.”3 [notes.html#ch6fn_3a] Douglass eventually developed above all aliterary identity, a man of words spoken and written.The New Bedford in which Douglass landed in 1838 had a population of nearlytwelve thousand, perhaps as many as three hundred of whom were fugitive slavesamong a free black population approaching one thousand. It was as open andthriving a refuge for runaways as anywhere in the North. And it was a boomingwhaling center, with some 170 ships making it their main port and employing asmany as four thousand hands. In the year just before Douglass arrived, the townhad some seventeen candle houses and oil manufactories. Of the 181,724 barrelsof sperm oil and 219,138 of whale oil imported into the United States in 1837,more than 40 percent of the totals came in at New Bedford’s docks. Within theensuing decade down to 1849, whaling became the first international industrydominated by the United States, with New Bedford as its capital. By 1840, in NewBedford, with a population of 12,087, the whaling business grossed $7,230,000.4[notes.html#ch6fn_4a]Douglass himself would never go to sea as a whaler, although the crews of somany ill-fated ships were one place where blacks and Indians and all manner ofyoung boys and men could find work. Like Baltimore, the sea at New Bedfordbrought the world into Douglass’s vision, and the whale as a product made aneconomy in which he would find wage labor of all kinds for three years. AsHerman Melville put it in Moby-Dick, the crews with whom he served and foughtand mutinied on whale ships came from “all the isles of the sea, and all theends of the earth.” From his residence in New Bedford at the very time Douglassalso lived there, Melville left unforgettable descriptions of the town. NewBedford, he wrote, “is a queer place,” full of an almost infinite eccentricityof types and behaviors among the young mates of the whale fishery, of a varietyof “wild specimens” from the hills of New England and the farthest isles ofdistant oceans.5 [notes.html#ch6fn_5a]In his own way, Douglass was another wild specimen come to join this teemingseaport, and now he needed a job. From his years in Baltimore, Douglass knewmuch of the world of ships, seaports, the maritime trades, and especially of themen and women who lived by the wealth of the sea. But the body of the whale hadfor several decades built New Bedford and forged jobs for a young fugitiveslave. Until the discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania in 1859, which rapidlykilled off the whaling business, the whale helped launch the modern industrialrevolution, its oil used for all manner of lighting, its hairy bristles madeinto brooms, its bones transformed into everything from canes to umbrellas, itspearly spermaceti made into the best candles, and even a foul black liquid fromits gut somehow converted into perfume.6 [notes.html#ch6fn_6a]Image [../images/f0090-01.jpg]The whaling ship Eliza Adams in port with casks of whale oil, New Bedford,Massachusetts, c. 1850.Douglass’s autobiographical writing about New Bedford served different ends thanMelville’s; it took its place in his antislavery polemic, drawing sharpdistinctions between a Southern slave society and a Northern free-labor society.Yet, it was often no less lyrical than Melville’s descriptions of the town. Manyhave speculated, though no one knows, whether Melville and Douglass somehow metor observed each other in New Bedford; they were both there in late 1840 andearly 1841. The sailor-adventurer was preparing for his long voyage to the SouthSeas on a whaler, while the fugitive slave worked as a day laborer. Douglassadmitted that the “wealth and grandeur” of New Bedford surprised him. He hadbeen conditioned to consider slavery as the basis of wealth. Not in the whalingport. Working white men and black men alike owned homes and lived with dignity.Douglass seemed genuinely stunned at Yankee enterprise and apparent prosperity.Contrasting the “poverty and degradation” of poor whites in Baltimore and St.Michaels with the “superior mental character” of Northern workers, he used ashis example Nathan Johnson. Douglass’s host, though a workingman, lived in “abetter house—dined at a richer board—was the owner of more books—the reader ofmore newspapers—was more conversant with the social and political condition ofthis nation and the world—than nine-tenths of all the slaveholders of TalbotCounty, Maryland.” Johnson, Douglass contended, labored with his hands in NewBedford, was the worker-citizen, even an intellectual in this seaside free-laborcommunity.7 [notes.html#ch6fn_7a]Douglass also remembered that he felt safe in New Bedford, in part because thetown contained so many Quakers, with their egalitarian and enterprisingtraditions. During his residence in the town, whaling seemed to be a commercewith an endless future. At the wharves, he insisted, were “industry withoutbustle, labor without noise, and heavy toil without the whip.” For the youngDouglass, all things before his eyes were in stark contrast to theslavery-ridden world from which he had fled. In the town’s many whale-relatedenterprises, he maintained, “everything went on as smoothly as the works of awell-adjusted machine.” The excited man in his early twenties was impressed withall the modern conveniences he encountered: “wood houses, indoor pumps, sinks,drains, self-shutting gates, washing machines, pounding barrels.” Suchobservations vary widely from Melville’s characterizations of the hard-drinkingharpooners and other lost souls at the Spouter Inn and other stops along thestreets of New Bedford. That “wise prudence” guided the sensibilities of thistown would have seemed strange news to many of the young men seeking adventureand fortune on those whalers in the 1840s.8 [notes.html#ch6fn_8a] But Douglasswas aiming for different places.Within three days of arrival in New Bedford, Frederick found paid work loadingoil casks onto a sloop bound for New York. He soon sought to use his trade as acaulker, but the white caulkers of the docks threatened to walk off their jobsif the young black man was hired. All was not so prudent or liberating afterall. But in this case Douglass swallowed his pride and anger, put away hiscaulking mallet for now, and took every kind of job he found. One day he walkedup to a prosperous house, knocked on the door, and asked the lady if he mightput away her load of coal. As she dropped two silver dollars in his hand at theend of his dirty work, Douglass remembered, it “swelled my heart as I claspedthis money, realizing that I had no master . . . that my hands were my own.” Forthree years, and for “honest” money, he said, he “sawed wood—dugcellars—shoveled coal—swept chimneys . . . rolled oil casks to thewharves—helped to load and unload vessels—worked in Richetson’s candle works—inRichmond’s brass foundry, and elsewhere.” He also worked as a waiter for aprominent attorney, and did all manner of odd jobs for a local minister, EphraimPeabody. A reminiscence later by a Peabody family member described how Douglassbecame a man-of-all-work at the minister’s house, though much more inclined, itis said, to sit on the kitchen table and read than to work with his hands. ThePeabody descendant reported that Douglass defended his “inactivity by affirmingthat he occupied his leisure hours by pursuing the study of French.” At thefoundry, Douglass characteristically tried to read while he did the hot anddirty job of working the bellows. “With little time for mental improvement,” herecalled in 1851, “I often nailed a newspaper to the post near my bellows, andread while I was performing my up and down motion of the heavy beam by which thebellows was inflated and discharged.” In old age he marveled that he could havebeen so earnest in pursuing knowledge as a young man, while having to struggleto feed his family.9 [notes.html#ch6fn_9a]Anna gave birth to their daughter Rosetta on June 24, 1839, and their first son,Lewis, on October 9, 1840. Douglass does not tell us in the autobiographiesabout the circumstances or joys of these births; he only indicates how he workedwith his callused hands to support his wife, “who was unable to work,” and agrowing family in two rented rooms. They lived first at the rear of 157 ElmStreet, on the west edge of the main town, and after Lewis was born at 111 RayStreet, only a few blocks from the wharves. Frustratingly, Douglass wrote nextto nothing of his domestic life throughout his long experience as anautobiographer. In these three years in New Bedford, what we do know is that hefound work and stayed out of debt. In “rapturous excitement” at working freelyfor wages, and gaining some independence, Douglass believed he “was now livingin a new world.”10 [notes.html#ch6fn_10a]Soon the day laborer looked for a church. Perhaps he was thinking of hischildren’s spiritual welfare, or even Anna’s lack of community. But as always,in the autobiographies, the story was only about himself. At this juncture of1839–40, he admitted, he “had never given up, in reality, his religious faith.”He considered himself in a “backslidden state” in his early twenties. The youngman was looking for a pulpit, one he could listen to, and perhaps one he couldstep into. Father Lawson’s faith still tugged at Douglass’s spirit, and thestories and cadences of the Bible slumbered fitfully in his memory. He had grownup around Methodists on the Eastern Shore, many of them the hypocritical mastershe used as a foil for resistance. Out of familiarity, he felt a duty to try tojoin the Elm Street Methodist church. Douglass attended the primarily whitechurch, but found himself “proscribed” and not allowed to sit in the main pews.A dozen or so blacks attended and sat in a gallery. Staying for Holy Communion,he witnessed the ritual with “mortification”; as the Reverend Bonney finishedserving all the white members, he called the blacks forward with a “voice to anunnatural pitch.” His “black sheep,” said Douglass, seemed “penned . . . slavishsouls.” Douglass walked out the back door of this humiliating scene.11[notes.html#ch6fn_11a]Douglass quickly found his way to the welcoming arms of the small blackcongregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, pastored first bythe Reverend William Serrington and then by the Reverend Thomas James, who hadhimself been born a slave in 1804 in upstate New York. In 1839, Douglass servedas “sexton, steward, class leader, clerk, and local preacher” in this humblecongregation that met in a little schoolhouse on Second Street, only threeblocks uphill from the wharves. He also performed weekly duties as the church’sSunday school superintendent, responsible for the education of members. TheReverend James later claimed that Douglass, who was “right out of slavery,” hadbeen “given authority to act as an exhorter” at the church just before James’sarrival. The reverend said he then licensed Douglass to preach, which Douglasslater confirmed. Douglass remembered his deep associations with what he alwayscalled “Little Zion” as “precious,” and “among the happiest days of my life.” Heexpressed firm opinions on which of the church’s ministers were most effectiveor possessed education. He said he “occupied the pulpit,” when the ministerasked, and dozens of times Douglass held forth on Sunday mornings or at eveninggatherings. In a letter near the end of his life, written in December 1894,Douglass reminisced with joy about how the little AMEZ Church in New Bedford hadoffered his first chance to “exercise my gifts” and launched him in his “newvocation.” In the 1841 town directory, Douglass’s occupation had changed from“laborer” to “Rev.”12 [notes.html#ch6fn_12a]No recorded remarks survive from Douglass’s sermons to the small church offugitive slaves and free blacks. By at least the summer of 1840, though, earlierthan scholars have previously known, Douglass was discovered by whiteabolitionists. In August of that year the Boston antislavery lawyer Ellis GrayLoring wrote to a friend in Toronto, the Reverend Hiram Wilson, excitedlytelling of a “coloured man . . . we are anxious to employ as a lecturer.” Hisname was “Fred” and he had been owned by “Thomas Auld of Talbot County,Maryland.” This stunning young fugitive had escaped “two years ago”; he was a“light mulatto, tall, well-formed, of an open countenance & speaks very goodEnglish.” Loring enlisted Wilson to be an agent to Auld to try to buy Douglass’sfreedom. “Fred is poor & a labourer,” Loring wrote, but his speaking skillscould “produce great effect.”13 [notes.html#ch6fn_13a]Nothing came of this early initiative to purchase Douglass’s freedom. But theday laborer did not hide from view, especially on Sundays. The young father withhis wife at home caring for two babies must have frequently taken time in hisworkaday life to consult his Bible, his Columbian Orator, and his vivid memoryof the band of brothers at the Freeland farm as he prepared for his mornings inthe pulpit.• • •The former Sabbath school leader among slaves seized upon his liberty and hisnew calling like a miner finding gold. At least by 1840, and perhaps as early as1839, he registered to vote by paying his $1.50 poll tax. In Massachusetts inthe late 1830s, men, including blacks, registered to vote by paying this smallannual tax. In the sweep of America’s racist and discriminatory history withvoting rights, it is remarkable that the most famous black man of the nineteenthcentury, shortly after escaping from slavery, while living with a new, assumedname, with no other identification and certainly no proof of birth in the UnitedStates, and while still “illegal” as a fugitive from Southern justice and theproperty rights of his owner, could instantly become a voter by paying $1.50 andhaving his name placed on the tax rolls.14 [notes.html#ch6fn_14a]Approximately four months after his arrival in New Bedford, Douglass alsoencountered an agent for William Lloyd Garrison’s abolitionist newspaper, theLiberator. The paper and its editor changed Douglass’s life forever. The youngfugitive was too poor to pay for a subscription at first, but the agentnevertheless had the weekly sent to him. In the Liberator Douglass startedreading an antislavery voice like no other. Garrison seemed prophetic,revelatory, like a “Moses, raised up by God, to deliver his modern Israel frombondage.” So clear, radical, and uncompromising, Garrison’s words seemed toDouglass like a “gospel . . . full of holy fire.” The paper, Douglass wrote in1855, “took its place with me next to the Bible.” Here he found moral suasion,the appeal to reform the hearts of people before changing the laws of a society.For the young reader, so drawn to the mystery of writing and speaking, this wasabolitionism through the power of language, words as weapons against evil andpowerful institutions, truth spread by preaching.15 [notes.html#ch6fn_15a] Herewas a new level of public hope, reinforcing and containing the fires of angerburning in his private heart.In those initial issues of the Liberator that Douglass read in 1839, heencountered an inspiring world of antislavery activity and debate. He discoveredthat abolitionism had spread all over the North. He learned a new word,immediatism, for Garrison’s theory that slaveholding was an individual andnational sin, that all antislavery forces should make no compromise with slaveryin any form—in church, legislature, or the public square—and should work now todestroy the institution, root and branch, in their own lifetimes. Douglass readabout huge petition campaigns by abolitionists aimed at persuading the USCongress to end slavery in the District of Columbia and in the westernterritories. He now knew about “gag rules” practiced in Congress to suppress thevoices of that body’s few antislavery members. He found colonization schemes tosend blacks out of the country, to Africa or elsewhere, roundly condemned overand over by Garrisonians, and especially by free blacks. He saw Garrison himselfcondemned in correspondence as everything from “dangerous” and “vile” to“seditious,” and the leader of a “miscreant band . . . of demented fanatics.”16[notes.html#ch6fn_16a] All of this Douglass found thrilling; the waves ofrhetorical and violent resistance to abolitionists seemed to the young fugitiveone of their greatest recommendations.Douglass further learned from the Liberator that women were involved in themovement, organizing fund-raising abolition “fairs,” recruiting new members,stepping out of their assigned sphere and inviting great scorn. In many issuesDouglass found news of both escaped as well as captured fugitive slaves inNorthern states. In every issue, he saw confirmations of one of his own mostvehement complaints—hypocritical Christian slaveholding and Northern clericalcomplicity. By April, he might have been bemused as he read about the BaltimoreAnnual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church (with some of his Marylandtormentors perhaps in attendance) turning down an antislavery resolution by analmost unanimous vote. He likely laughed out loud when he read about the blackman in Cambridge, Massachusetts, working for a white merchant who prodded himinto a practical joke. The employer offered to fill out a ballot for hisemployee (who was illiterate) and carry it for him to a polling place. But theblack laborer got the last laugh; on his own initiative, he walked to the officeof the Liberator and asked for a ballot; given the current copy of thenewspaper, he promptly marched to the polling site and stuffed Garrison’s weeklyin the box.17 [notes.html#ch6fn_17a]In some issues, Douglass could study the names and careers of a generation ofblack abolitionists. In April 1839 for the first time on paper he likely metJames McCune Smith, with whom Douglass would develop a crucial friendship. Aboveall, Douglass must have fingered the words of Garrison himself, who so often allbut shouted from the page. The “real abolitionists,” declared the editor inMarch 1839, “know neither caste, country, nor color. The cause of sufferinghumanity is not with them a political question, concerning only a certain classor community . . . it is their business, and it ought to be the business ofevery son and daughter of Adam.”18 [notes.html#ch6fn_18a] To Douglass’simpressionable spirit and hungry mind, this was abolitionism clear and pure; hewanted to join up.Image [../images/f0096-01.jpg]The masthead of The Liberator.To Douglass, Garrison was a hero exciting “love and reverence” before the twoever met. Thus began, in almost mythic terms, one of the most important andturbulent relationships of Douglass’s long life. For Douglass, Garrisonrepresented a moral voice—from a white person—against slavery, the likes ofwhich he had only dreamed. He could now truly find out what “abolition” meant,perhaps even imagine a purpose or a vocation in its sacred circles. In April1839, Garrison came to New Bedford to speak. Douglass sat in the extreme rear ofthe Old Congregational Meeting House and listened wide-eyed, with rapt joy. InLife and Times, he crafted a lyrical remembrance of this special moment.Whatever exactly Garrison said that night, Douglass recalled it as a classiclitany of all the great editor’s “heresies.” Forgetting his many painfulpersonal battles with Garrison for the time being, the memoirist of 1881remembered the essentials of a Garrisonian: “His Bible was his textbook. Hebelieved in sinless perfection . . . literal subjection to the injunction ifsmitten ‘on one cheek to turn the other also.’ ” As though remembering theadmonitions of a New Testament Christ delivering an abolitionist version of theSermon on the Mount, Douglass continued, “Not only was Sunday a Sabbath, but alldays were Sabbaths, and to be kept holy. All sectarianism was false andmischievous. . . . Prejudice against color was rebellion against God. Of all menbeneath the sky, the slaves . . . were nearest and dearest to His great heart.Those ministers who defended slavery from the Bible were of their ‘father thedevil,’ and those churches which fellowshipped slaveholders as Christians, weresynagogues of Satan, and our nation was a nation of liars.”19[notes.html#ch6fn_19a]That night in the back pew of a New Bedford church, on countless days in thepages of the Liberator, which Douglass carried to his jobs, and soon underGarrison’s own guidance, Douglass found a text and a calling. Here was anantislavery morality he had lived and that all but screamed from within his ownsoul. He was not yet ready in 1839–40 to become a “public advocate,” he tellsus. For the moment, it was enough to “receive and applaud the great words ofothers, and only whisper in private, among the white laborers on the wharves,and elsewhere, the truths which burned in my breast.”20 [notes.html#ch6fn_20a]But it would not be enough for long; Douglass was no whisperer.During that winter of 1839, Douglass began to speak regularly at the AME ZionChurch on Second Street. It is sometimes claimed that Douglass was a self-taughtorator, but given his experience for at least two years in and around the pulpitat “Little Zion,” this is only partially true. In a real sense, he was trainednot only by the precepts he read in Bingham’s Columbian Orator, but by theReverends Serrington and James, as well as other visiting preachers from Bostonand Providence, who taught him that the “ideal sermon” must appeal to theintellect, to emotion, and to the human will. It is easy for us to say thatDouglass would have instinctively understood such homiletic techniques; but hestill needed practice. Some weeks he would have preached on the liturgy andhoned his biblical interpretation as well as storytelling; and what a compellingperformer of Scripture readings the young Douglass must have made in front ofthe congregants in the simple room on Second Street.21 [notes.html#ch6fn_21a]Douglass had indeed found his first pulpit, and he did so in a distinctivelyAfrican American church.Outside the windows of the little schoolhouse church, the issue that seems tohave brought Douglass to his feet as an orator was colonization. He had nopatience with the idea that people such as himself, born on American soil,escaped from slavery to a tenuous free-labor life in a relatively safeenvironment such as New Bedford, ought to voluntarily take his family on a shipbound for Africa, a Caribbean island, or any other foreign place. The AmericanColonization Society, founded in 1816 and by the late 1830s falling on hardtimes, launched schemes of black expatriation that violated most free AfricanAmericans’ sense of their natural rights. In the first publicly recordedinstance of Douglass speaking at an antislavery meeting, held March 12, 1839, hewas among ten New Bedford blacks who “ably sustained” several resolutionsagainst colonization. The group invoked verbatim the opening lines of theDeclaration of Independence, called colonization a form of tyranny, and declaredwith special emphasis, “We are American citizens, born with natural, inherent,just and inalienable rights.” They announced themselves especially outraged bythe way colonization made “impressions . . . on the public mind” about their“moral and intellectual abilities.” That late-winter evening of 1839 was hisfirst rehearsal for what would become a sustained, twenty-five-year condemnationof colonizationist ideas, whether they emanated from racist and profit-mindedwhites, or blacks themselves.22 [notes.html#ch6fn_22a]By 1841, Douglass had delivered many sermons at AME Zion, presided over numerousmeetings convened to oppose colonization, and delivered at least three addressesto white people at the Bristol County Anti-Slavery Society in New Bedford. Hehad further attended addresses by prominent abolitionists such as one deliveredMay 30, 1841, by the Reverend Henry Highland Garnet, himself another formerslave from Maryland, and later an ideological rival. Douglass long rememberedthe Garnet speech as a special inspiration on his young abolitionist mind.Douglass was so effective as a speaker, even in his early twenties, that hislocal reputation spread in the streets, as well as beyond New Bedford. One ormore of his performances impressed a white abolitionist in attendance, WilliamC. Coffin, a local bookseller, Garrisonian devotee, and member of a prominentantislavery family. In August 1841, Coffin invited the black preacher to join adelegation of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society for what Douglass wouldlater describe as a “grand . . . convention” on the island of Nantucket.23[notes.html#ch6fn_23a]On August 9, 1841, the Bristol County Anti-Slavery Society held a meeting withmany distinguished speakers in Liberty Hall in New Bedford. Garrison himselfattended, along with other leading Massachusetts abolitionists such as ParkerPillsbury, George Bradburn, John A. Collins, and Edmund Quincy. By the eveningsession, several “col’d individuals” addressed the meeting, particularly aboutthe issue of racial exclusion from public transportation and from some churches.Douglass, most likely, was one of those speakers. Although his speeches onNantucket on the following days are more celebrated, Douglass may have spoken toa prominent group of white abolitionists for the first time on this August nightin New Bedford. Garrison reported that among the “talented” blacks who spokethat night, one of them was “formerly a slave.”24 [notes.html#ch6fn_24a]The following day, Douglass and Anna boarded the steamer Telegraph for the tripout to Nantucket. Anna’s presence is remarkable; after Douglass’s speakingcareer took off in the 1840s, she rarely if ever accompanied him on the road.The racially mixed delegation on the steamboat numbered approximately forty, andas they boarded, the ship’s captain, named Phinney, forced the blacks to asegregated area on the upper deck. The white abolitionists joined them for thesixty-mile journey, holding an impromptu antislavery meeting in which theypassed resolutions of protest against the steamship company’s discriminatorypolicy, as all the while, according to Parker Pillsbury, they “suffered fromboth sun and rain.”25 [notes.html#ch6fn_25a]On the second day of the convention, which met in the Nantucket Atheneum Halland was attended by as many as a thousand abolitionists, Garrison offered apoignant resolution about prejudice against blacks, accusing discriminatorywhite Northerners of “putting arguments into the mouths of southerntask-masters, and acting as the body-guard of slavery.” Until that moment aspectator on what he later described as, in part, a “holiday,” Douglass brokehis silence and rose to be one of five men supporting the resolution. Whatfollowed was what Douglass called his “first” speech, delivered in threesegments. That evening, August 11, he spoke haltingly and only briefly beforeadjournment.26 [notes.html#ch6fn_26a] But the next morning, the podium was hisand the audience was rested and receptive.No record exists of what he actually said on August 12 at Nantucket, but overtime, as Douglass’s fame grew, many witnesses competed to describe and takecredit for his “discovery.” Samuel J. May recollected that Douglass was “calledupon,” and after “much hesitation” and “embarrassment” at speaking before suchan august gathering of white people, “he gave evidence of such intellectualpower—wisdom as well as wit—that all present were astonished.” Pillsbury tooremembered Douglass’s initial “embarrassment,” but that he “gainedself-possession” and rose to the “dignity of his theme.” Douglass apparentlyheld his auditors entranced with a personalized version of a slave’s travail.Whichever stories from his youth he used to bare his heart, he held the heartsof the convention audience in his gesturing hands; the crowd, caught in thebeauty and agony of the performance, could hardly have known that this young manhad been practicing his new craft for some years. Douglass “spoke with greatpower,” wrote one witness. “Flinty hearts were pierced, and cold ones melted byhis eloquence. Our best pleaders for the slave held their breath for fear ofinterrupting him.”27 [notes.html#ch6fn_27a]Garrison may have left the most telling testimony of all about Douglass’s suddenemergence those two days on Nantucket. In his endorsement of Douglass’sNarrative in 1845, Garrison described a singular moment in abolition history: “Ishall never forget his first speech at the convention—the extraordinary emotionit excited in my own mind—the powerful impression it created upon a crowdedauditory. . . . I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at that moment.”Garrison was so moved by Douglass’s debut that he saw it with biblical resonanceas well as within the tradition of American civil religion. Drawing from Psalms8:5, Garrison believed they had found “one in intellect richly endowed—innatural eloquence a prodigy—in soul manifestly ‘created but a little lower thanthe angels.’ ” Then he compared Douglass’s effort to “Patrick Henry, ofrevolutionary fame,” and described the fugitive slave’s speech as “moreeloquent” in the “cause of liberty” than any by the founders.28[notes.html#ch6fn_28a]According to Douglass’s own account, his theme was simply his “feelings”inspired by the occasion at the Atheneum, and the “fresh recollection of thescenes through which I had passed as a slave.” He remembered “stammering” at thebeginning of his sudden moment on the podium in front of such a crowd andclaimed that he “trembled in every limb.” Douglass clearly experienced aninitial awkwardness and anxiety. But after gaining some poise, seeing the vividattentiveness of people in the front rows, he stunned the audience withsomething most never forgot. They also never forgot Garrison’s follow-up use ofthe young former slave’s personal autobiographical remarks. A star was born inthree days on Nantucket, and Garrison plucked the star out of the sky. UnderDouglass’s inspiration, Samuel May thought Garrison delivered “one of hissublimest speeches.” Pillsbury observed a Garrison who “never before orafterwards felt more profoundly the sacredness of his mission.” Garrisonrecalled asking the enthralled audience whether they would ever allow such ayoung fugitive to be “carried back into slavery,” to which they answered “inthunder-tones—NO!” Garrison made Douglass “his text,” recalled the fugitiveslave. The Liberator’s editor held forth with a “power, sweeping down, like avery tornado.”29 [notes.html#ch6fn_29a] Before the delegation boarded thesteamer for the return to New Bedford, a plan emerged, much to Douglass’sastonishment and delight, to take this individual act as well as transcendentcollaboration on the road. A new vocation beckoned.Within one week of Nantucket, Douglass found himself whisked out on therailroads and into churches and halls of eastern Massachusetts and southern NewHampshire, telling his stories from the Eastern Shore, making witness againstslavery, attacking racial prejudice and proslavery churches in the North.Douglass made a deal with John Collins, the “general agent” of the MassachusettsAnti-Slavery Society, to go out on the abolitionist speaking circuit for athree-month trial. Collins served as the young man’s manager and travelingcompanion. Douglass said he worried that such publicity would expose him tocapture and a return to slavery in Maryland. No doubt, Anna, with two babies intheir crowded apartment on Ray Street in New Bedford, worried even more. But outher husband went, starting again, he later wrote, “a new life” with his “wholeheart in the holy cause.” Douglass was more than ready to change, he said, froma life sustained by the “hardness of my hands, as a means of supporting myselfand rearing my children,” to a life of the mind, one rooted in “reading andthinking,” and sustained by nothing more material than the power of “theword.”30 [notes.html#ch6fn_30a] For the next five decades the mastery of wordsbecame Douglass’s life’s work.Such a path may seem but Frederick Douglass’s destiny in retrospect, and hecertainly portrayed it that way; but in the fall of 1841, nothing wascertain—except that he would be paid to speak and face hatred, resistance, andviolence, as he launched his more than fifty-year career as an orator. Takingenormous risks in proslavery America, Douglass eventually made untold thousandshold their breath as they listened to a voice like no other. Like Melville, hehad found his “passage out,” with no idea of just where the voyage might takehim.31 [notes.html#ch6fn_31a] Only five and a half years after his Sabbathschool sermons to his band of enslaved brothers on Freeland’s farm, Douglass nowhad friends who would give him a pulpit to the whole country, even the world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 7--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THIS DOUGLASS!I will not detain you long for I stand here a slave—a slave at least in the eyesof the Constitution.

Tall, six feetone, brown skinned, careful of his physical appearance and the growth and partin his hair, handsome, with a sonorous voice he could modulate up or down butgenerally settled into a pleasing baritone, and with an astonishingly wideknowledge of both slavery itself and of antislavery strategies, Douglass tookthe abolitionists’ traveling circuit by storm in the early 1840s. “I ran awayfrom the South seven years ago,” he said in a speech in New York in May 1845,“passing through this city in no little hurry. . . . Since then I have beenengaged for three years in telling the people what I know of it.”1[notes.html#ch7fn_1a] Indeed he had been, all across the Northern states fromMaine to Michigan, to small and large audiences, amid great adulation as well asvicious attacks.Douglass found the vocation for which he believed he was fit at least sincepracticing speech-making with his Columbian Orator in hand. Although still onlyin his early to midtwenties, to see or hear this young Frederick Douglass becamean American cultural phenomenon. Many of his auditors, friends and foes alike,left stunning descriptions of Douglass in action; none more remarkably than theabolitionist editor in Concord, New Hampshire, Nathaniel Rogers, who afterwitnessing a Douglass address in February 1844 could hardly contain himself.Typical of many abolitionist gatherings, especially on a Sunday, Douglass spoketo an afternoon meeting as well as an even larger one in the courthouse in theevening. Because of the Garrisonians’ hostility to the clergy, as well as theirpersistent attacks on religious hypocrisy, no church in Concord opened its doorsto the abolitionists. Douglass did not disappoint. In the “inconvenient,uncomfortable” space of the courthouse town hall, Douglass held forth in theafternoon on how he was “not a fugitive from slavery, but a fugitive slave.”That he was still “in slavery” was due to the American churches’ sanctifying andjustifying the tyranny of slaveholding. Looking his audience in the eyes, hedeclared, “You are yourselves our enslavers.”2 [notes.html#ch7fn_2a]In the evening, the crowd was even larger; according to Rogers, Douglassdelivered an unforgettable performance. Beginning slowly, with a “calm,deliberate . . . narrative of his life,” the young man, who had just turnedtwenty-six years old, told of gaining his literacy from Sophia Auld—until herhusband, Hugh, forbade it—as well as learning from his playmates and workmatesin the streets and on the docks of Baltimore. This, Rogers observed, Douglassaccomplished in a “hesitating way,” reciting the facts, almost “dullish inmanner.” Then came “symptoms of a brewing storm” that took hold of the audiencelike nothing Rogers had ever seen. Douglass “gradually let out the outragedhumanity that was laboring in him, in indignant and terrible speech.” It was notso much eloquence, said the New Hampshire editor, but something “sterner,darker, deeper.” Writing as though still breathing heavily while listening toDouglass, Rogers described a “volcanic outbreak of human nature . . . at lastbursting its imprisonment.” As Douglass now “stalked to and fro on theplatform,” Rogers saw an angry young man rise up “like the Numidian lion” andimagined “how that terrible voice of his would ring through the pine glades ofthe South, in the day of her visitation, calling the insurgents to battle, andstriking terror to the hearts of the . . . despairing master.” Rogers felt mostimpressed with the sheer “dignity” and “earnestness” of Douglass’s effort. Thespeaker was not merely performing, said the local host. “He was the insurgentslave, taking hold of the right of speech, and charging on his tyrants thebondage of his race.” Someone in the audience, as often occurred, objected tosome aspect of Douglass’s vehemence. Rogers enjoyed the result: “He better haverun upon a lion. It was fearful but magnificent, to see how magnanimously andlion-like the royal fellow tore him to pieces, and left his untouched fragmentsscattered around him.”3 [notes.html#ch7fn_3a]In this great age of oratory, Rogers provided only one among many such recordedresponses to Douglass the young lecturer. His power rested in part in his sheertalent with words on the platform. But it also emanated from his role, one hecould almost never avoid, as symbol, as an exhibit of the black man, the slavewith a stunningly informed, active, and brilliant mind. He was the Negro withintellect, a most unusual character to the imaginations of white-supremacistAmerica. He was the ornament, the object, a former piece of property who couldspeak and write, who could match wits and logic with even his most determinedcritics, a youthful, beautiful brown man who made people think.4[notes.html#ch7fn_4a] But he was also the preacher condemning sin and callingthe fallen to repent, the analyst educating an ignorant populace that preferredcomfortable stereotypes and shallow shibboleths to deeper knowledge of therealities of slavery, and the prosecutor trying to bring the nation and itscitizens to a bar of public opinion if not justice.When Douglass joined the abolition movement, 1841–44, the crusade was ascendant,but also riven with ideological, tactical, and personal disputes. At the heartof most of the internecine warfare among abolitionists was Garrison, a morallightning rod who had inspired both deeply devoted followers and ferociouscritics. Still only maturing as a sensitive fugitive slave desperately in searchof community, security, and guidance, Douglass “loved” Garrison and held him ingenuine reverence, as he often said. Once pressed on where he had achieved hisadvanced education, the former slave responded, “From Massachusetts University,Mr. Garrison, president.” Douglass quickly knew he had joined a religiousmovement, what many historians have come to call a campaign of “Bible politics”;and its spiritual father was William Lloyd Garrison. One of Garrison’s long-termadmirers, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, recollected that the founder of theLiberator always sounded “like a newly discovered chapter of Ezekiel.” ButGarrison eagerly made many enemies. One found his style so harsh that hecompared him to “the pert loquacity of a blue-jay.” Even one among his own flockdeclared that it was all but impossible “to swallow Garrison whole.”5[notes.html#ch7fn_5a]In the early 1840s, Douglass did swallow whole the cluster of ideas andstrategies the prophetic Garrison had honed into rigid orthodoxy. To thedoctrines of immediatism, moral suasion, anticlericalism, nonresistance(pacifism), and racial equality that Douglass had relished reading about in theLiberator, Garrison had now advanced perhaps his most controversial tenets ofall: disunionism (urging abolitionists to withdraw from any complicity with theproslavery US Constitution); antipolitics (denunciation of political parties andof voting itself in a system so corrupted by slavery); and women’s equality(demanding women’s political and economic rights). These three doctrines didmore than anything else to tear asunder by 1840 whatever unity remained in theAmerican Anti-Slavery Society (AASS), the organization Garrison had done so muchto build. Garrison took abolitionism into the realm of Christian anarchy, humanmoral perfectionism, and rejection of virtually all governmental authority.6[notes.html#ch7fn_6a] Many devoted abolitionists, especially African Americans,stayed with him; his charisma and devotion alone could carry a crowd a long way.But many others, particularly evangelicals who did not believe all churchesworth condemning, and especially those who saw antislavery potential in theConstitution and who believed it foolhardy to think that slavery could ever beeradicated outside the American political system, openly split with Garrison andhis brand of ideological purity.By fall 1841, as Douglass joined a stable of loyal lecturers, Garrison expressedgreat confidence about the movement. “Our antislavery struggle is constantlyincreasing in vigor and potency,” he wrote to an English friend, “and never wereour spirits better or our blows more effective. . . . Our fall and wintercampaign will be carried on with unwonted energy.” Invitations to speak came toGarrison himself and to his troops from “all parts of the free states.” Herelished the attacks on his methods and arguments from outside and from withinabolitionism. The coffers of the American Anti-Slavery Society had grown andmade possible the hiring of Douglass as well as other speakers. “The many baseattempts . . . to cripple my influence, and render me odious in the eyes of thepeople,” Garrison claimed, “have only served to awaken sympathy . . . and toopen a wide door for usefulness.” Portraying himself as undergoing a Job-likeonslaught, Garrison exploited his enemies’ wrath, a tactic Douglass soonmastered himself: “Thus has the Lord taken the cunning in their own craftiness,and carried the counsels of the froward headlong.”7 [notes.html#ch7fn_7a]But Garrison no longer spoke for the entire antislavery movement. By 1840 theAmerican Anti-Slavery Society broke apart forever in a schism. In response tothe near collapse of moral suasion as a guiding strategy, Garrison, if anything,took it to an even higher intensity. He argued that the whole of Americansociety, especially the North, needed a “moral revolution” in values, atransformation from a nation of sin and infamy to the goal of human perfection.Garrison was a great organizer, an intrepid newspaper editor, and sometimes amagical platform speaker. But he could also demand absolutist doctrines of hisfollowers, as in the biblical injunction he fondly employed: “Be ye perfect,even as your heavenly Father is perfect.”8 [notes.html#ch7fn_8a] Garrisoniansincreasingly gained a reputation for extreme radicalism, of being eitherdangerous or irrelevant cranks. Sometimes they earned such an image, even amongother abolitionists, and sometimes it was merely the by-product of embitteredfactionalism.Led by Arthur and Lewis Tappan, wealthy abolitionist merchants in New York, agrowing cadre of more politically minded reformers came to believe that far moreAmericans could be reached by antislavery beliefs if immediatism, a radicaltemperament and the strategy that sought abolition of slavery without delay, didnot appear so militant. Garrison outorganized the Tappanites at the 1840 annualconvention of the American Anti-Slavery Society, managed adoption of many of hisdoctrines by narrow margins, and elected the radical feminist Abby Kelley to theexecutive committee by a tally of 557 to 451. The Tappans and many of theiradherents especially opposed women’s equality in reform movements; they boltedthe older organization and formed the new American and Foreign Anti-SlaverySociety, based in New York City and devoted especially to a broader politicaland legal movement against slavery. That group had also been deeply instrumentalin forming the Liberty Party, the first antislavery political organization togain genuine traction in America.9 [notes.html#ch7fn_9a]As Douglass found himself and his talents warmly embraced within the Garrisonianfold, he quickly discerned the ways of a swirling and contentious world offriends and enemies, devotees and apostates. For now, partly out of agreement,and partly because he knew where his bread was buttered, Douglass remaineddevoted to his mentor, who was thirteen years his senior and a man of propheticqualities to the young romantic fugitive slave. Although only an upstart,Douglass joined up with the “old organization” men and their growing number ofwomen activists, and he was more than eager to earn approval from his fatherfigure, Garrison, by denouncing the heresies of the “new organization” men suchas the Tappans, and the emerging political abolitionists in the Liberty Party.10[notes.html#ch7fn_10a]As Douglass remembered setting out on his three-month trial on the speakingcircuit, he stressed his fears of capture as a fugitive; but he relished theopportunity. His handler, John A. Collins, was a thirty-one-year-old,Vermont-born radical Garrisonian and former theology student with a powerfulreputation as an effective organizer. In town after town, Collins made thingshappen for groups of agents and speakers. Later in the autobiographies, Douglasswould write with some contempt about Collins’s efforts to control the youngerman’s message and style. Collins would introduce Douglass with quite somefanfare as a “graduate of the peculiar institution,” and then on cue Frederickwould tell his stories from the Eastern Shore. They became an effective tagteam, and although Douglass undoubtedly tired of the same routine and hispersonalized rhetoric, Collins was without question a devoted companion andadviser. As a fellow abolitionist remarked, no one in the Garrisonian rankscould “plan and execute a campaign on the largest scale” as well as Collins.11[notes.html#ch7fn_11a]With a high forehead and a strong chin, Collins was no slouch himself on theplatform. Garrison so trusted him that he sent Collins to England in 1840–41 toraise money and to spread the Garrisonian gospels among British abolitionists.Just before returning from England, Collins published a pamphlet, Right andWrong Among the Abolitionists, in which he defended Garrisonian doctrinesagainst the “misrepresentations” and “mean-minded malice” of otherabolitionists. The Liberator sold Collins’s manifesto at the same time it beganto chart Douglass’s tours in the fall of 1841.12 [notes.html#ch7fn_12a]By the end of his trial period in late 1841, Douglass had spoken in at leasttwenty towns in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, sometimes atorganized conventions and sometimes at little gatherings promoted on the spot.On many of these occasions he delivered multiple speeches or statements insupport of resolutions. Douglass was often among a group of at least a halfdozen speakers; a typical town’s event would last at least two days and wouldinclude both daytime and evening meetings. The small troupes of abolitioniststraveled by horse, in wagons, by stagecoach, and increasingly where possible byrailroad. They stayed in private homes wherever friends could provide beds. Theabolitionist gatherings occurred in churches, town halls, public meetinghouses,and outdoors on town greens. On some occasions, Douglass and colleagues wouldwalk the streets or roads of a village passing out handbills announcing thatevening’s antislavery speeches. At Grafton, Massachusetts, in early 1842, whileworking solo, Douglass was met by mob hostility in addition to an unwelcomingclergy. So he went to a hotel and borrowed a “dinner-bell, with which in hand Ipassed through the principal streets,” he recalled, “ringing the bell and cryingout, ‘Notice! Frederick Douglass, recently a slave, will lecture on AmericanSlavery, on Grafton Common, this evening at 7 o’clock.”13 [notes.html#ch7fn_13a]The young Douglass had not only found his calling, but he quickly emerged as arising star in the first great reform movement of American history. At thisstage of his speaking career, his youth protected him from many of the physicalravages and bone-numbing challenges of the road. But this was only the beginningof a more than fifty-year career for this incomparable itinerant orator, ofstrained vocal cords and lost voice, but an intrepid heart, oratoricalbrilliance, and a vanity to match.While touring under Collins’s tutelage in the fall of 1841, and after he washired full-time as a lecturer in early 1842, Douglass shared platforms, meals,lecturing techniques, and ideas with all the leading Garrisonians: Garrisonhimself, Wendell Phillips, Stephen Foster, Edmund Quincy, Samuel J. May, CharlesLenox Remond, the leading black moral suasionist, and Abby Kelley, the stunningQuaker woman and radical whose talent as a speaker and whose controversialfeminism had made her even more of a sensation than the celebrated fugitiveslave. He also spoke out on virtually all the leading issues from proslaverychurches to Northern racial prejudice, the virtues of moral suasion and thedangers of political parties, disunionism and nonresistance, and thepsychological and physical character of slavery.Image [../images/f0108-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, first known photograph, c. 1841. Daguerreotype.Douglass learned much from his road-savvy older colleagues; but whateverresolutions they addressed, only he brought the living story of the scarred andsurviving slave to pulpits and lecterns. At his first outing, only one weekafter his debut on Nantucket in August, in the small town of Millbury,Massachusetts (Abby Kelley’s hometown), southeast of Worcester, a witnessreported that Douglass “called forth pity and horror at his story” from theEastern Shore. The Garrisonians now trumpeted their new agent as the “freshimpulse” on the circuit, and his voice as something unprecedented in a movemententering its second decade. At Lynn, Massachusetts, in early October, in thefirst of Douglass’s speeches recorded and published by a local journalist, theorator demonstrated the techniques that so captured audiences. After declaringhow “embarrassed” he was to speak before white people (a ruse he employed foryears), he announced his subject: “something about slavery—what I know of it, asI have felt it.” Here, in Christian New England, among romantics who yearned forthe intellectual and emotional knowledge of what slavery was like, and what raceand its mixtures produced in human capacity, they could hear from a truewitness.14 [notes.html#ch7fn_14a]Douglass made the most of his authenticity. At Lynn, he honored his whiteabolitionist colleagues for their deep knowledge and passion. “But they cannotspeak as I can from experience,” he said directly; “they cannot refer you to aback covered with scars, as I can, for I have felt these wounds.” Douglassgrabbed the feelings of his audiences and made them clay in his hands as he drewsuch distinctions with his fellow white abolitionists. He offered audiences the“blood . . . sprung out as the lash embedded in my flesh.” Before the Lynnaddress ended, Douglass introduced those gathered to the rigid religioushypocrisies of Thomas Auld, “class leader in the Methodist church,” stories ofthe separation of families in his slave background, the dreams slavesentertained of emancipation, and even the ways Northern racism hung around his“neck like a heavy weight.”15 [notes.html#ch7fn_15a] This became Douglass’sstock-in-trade: stories drawn from his life, laid on with force and powerfulindignation, penetrating the hearts of his auditors.• • •Rarely at home now in New Bedford, where Anna nursed and raised two babies,Douglass traveled incessantly from town to town. Their daughter, Rosetta, wasjust over two years old, and their son, Lewis, had been born on October 9, 1840.By the time Douglass had spoken in Lynn in 1841 just before Lewis’s firstbirthday, that town had become an important marker in both his life and that ofthe movement.The distances between the young abolitionist’s private and public lives werethrown into stark contrast, which would only grow with time. Twice in SeptemberDouglass was insulted, accosted, or thrown off the Eastern Railroad, the secondinstance occurring at the Lynn depot. On September 8, Collins and Douglass hadpurchased train tickets in Newburyport to travel north to Dover, New Hampshire,to speak at the Strafford County Anti-Slavery Society. The two were sitting inone double seat as the gruff conductor ordered Douglass to immediately moveforward to the Jim Crow car. For Douglass such constant practices of segregationwere always about dignity, as much as the “mean, dirty, and uncomfortable” spaceof Jim Crow cars. Collins vehemently objected on behalf of his black companion,whom he described to Garrison in a long account, as only “one or two shadesdarker than Daniel Webster.” With the conductor’s “little fist flourished aboutmy head,” Collins reported, he too was ordered to leave the car. “If you haulhim out, it will be over my person, as I do not intend to leave this seat,”proclaimed Collins. The conductor brought in several of the railroad’s hiredthugs to do the deed. With Collins loudly protesting this was “no less thanlynch law,” five men dragged the strong Douglass over Collins’s unmoved body,“like so many bloodhounds,” and “thrust him into the ‘negro car.’ ” In thefracas, Douglass’s clothes were torn and Collins described himself as“considerably injured in the affray.” Not missing an opportunity to make aGarrisonian doctrinal point, Collins told of a second conductor who went intothe Negro car to console Douglass with the intelligence that the railroad’spolicy was not so bad after all, since so many churches “have their ‘negropews.’ ”16 [notes.html#ch7fn_16a]On September 28 an even worse incident happened in this corner of the freeNorth. Collins boarded the train in Boston heading north for an antislaverymeeting in Newburyport. At the Lynn depot Douglass, along with fellowabolitionist James Buffum and an unidentified woman abolitionist, got on board.They had only assumed their seats when the same conductor grabbed Douglass bythe collar and ordered him to the Jim Crow car. The group of four demanded thereason, and Buffum even asked that the passengers hold a vote. In what became akind of standard performative response at these endless confrontations in hisearly career, Douglass pronounced, “If you will give me any good reason why Ishould leave this car, I will go willingly; but without such reason, I do notfeel at liberty to leave, though you can do with me as you please, I shall notresist.”17 [notes.html#ch7fn_17a] For now, Douglass responded to such racismwith disciplined nonresistance. In a short time, however, his response woulddrastically change. His rage would be contained by other people’s principles foronly so long.Collins fashioned this second Jim Crow railroad incident as a kind of theater.In a scene of great drama, other passengers in the car chimed in with a chorusof “Give him the reason!” As the surrounded, hapless conductor struggled forwords, in a “half-suppressed, half-audible voice” he looked up at Douglass’sface and said, “Because you are black,” which “stuck in his throat, likeMacbeth’s Amen.” But the conductor was surrounded for only a short while. Soon ahalf dozen company bullies arrived and began to beat both Douglass and Collins.As Douglass held fast to the seat with all his arm strength and with Collinsstill holding on firm as well, the floor bolts gave way and the troupe ofenforcers threw the men and the seat out the door and onto the ground with agreat thud. Douglass’s luggage was next thrown out on him as well.18[notes.html#ch7fn_18a]If Douglass had not already realized it, he surely did now: he was a key actorin a public drama, the survivor of slavery as abolitionist exhibit and thevictim-symbol of Yankee racism. In the days immediately after the September 28incident in Lynn, the town held large meetings of protest and indignation, andthe Garrisonians made robust use of the event by launching a widespread protestcampaign, threatening boycotts against such discriminatory railroads across NewEngland. At least one of the town’s newspapers, the Lynn Record, also expressedstrong support of Douglass and the abolitionists. It may have been preciselybecause of these episodes of racial embarrassment brought on by the EasternRailroad Company, and the public sympathies that flooded his way, that Douglassnow planned to move his family to Lynn late in the fall of 1841. Lightning wouldnot strike twice, and the prosperous shoe-manufacturing town had to make itselfwelcoming to the young black family, with the bruised and aggrieved celebrity atits head. Moreover, Garrison’s AASS office appears to have either purchased ahouse for the Douglasses or financially helped him build one in Lynn, a townjudged safer for a runaway than in the bigger port of Boston itself, where afugitive slave might be more easily seized.19 [notes.html#ch7fn_19a]We know little of what Anna thought of the move, but likely in November or earlyDecember, during a lull in his speaking schedule, Douglass began to move hisfamily to the town on the north side of Massachusetts Bay. They took upresidence near the center in what his daughter Rosetta remembered as a“cottage,” and what his son Charles recalled as a small frame dwelling built byhis father’s own hands, on Union Street, which intersected with the railroad atExchange Street in the heart of town. The house was a short walk from the depotwhere countless times over the next three years Douglass would embark anddisembark on his speaking tours. That same depot where he was thrown on theground in a tumbling train seat became the revolving door for American reform’smost prominent traveling man. Unlike in New Bedford, he did not have to findjobs with his hands in Lynn; his vocation now was that of the public lecturer inperpetual motion, bringing home a modest salary. Douglass would never again lifta barrel of whale oil.20 [notes.html#ch7fn_20a]Anna may have set up a house in Lynn that winter, but she was pregnant again,and she returned to New Bedford for the birth of Frederick Jr. on March 3, 1842,perhaps seeking out friends and the aid of a midwife. Douglass had a speakingengagement in Hubbardston, Massachusetts, on February 16, but was likely at hiswife’s side for the birth of his namesake. With three babies now at home by thesummer of 1842 (Rosetta was almost three, Lewis a year and a half old), Annaeventually garnered some income for the struggling young family by working as ashoe binder, a common occupation for women in that industry. Occasionally, shewould meet her husband at the depot with clean shirts and underwear as he spedoff to the next antislavery meeting beyond her horizon. We know Douglass as thegreat public voice, the source of words that explain the nation’s predicamentwith slavery and racism. Anna knew him through a hundred other kinds of images;but too often, the most common would be that of her well-dressed husband kissingand hugging good-bye as a whistle blows at the train station, she thrustingclean clothes and a bit of food into his outstretched hand, while holding atoddler in one hand and a baby on her shoulder.21 [notes.html#ch7fn_21a]The sounds and smells of the railroad depot, the backaches and the stiff necksfrom so many fitful naps on the cars, the rhythm of the wheels rolling on theiron rails, the weight of his duffel bags as well as the romance of traintravel, were Douglass’s constant companions. So were an occasional sympatheticfriend, a voyeuristic onlooker, or a racist heckler. Douglass took up residencein Lynn in late 1841 and early 1842, but most of the time over the next threeyears he lived on trains, on horseback, in carriages, and in other people’shouses. Forty years later in Life and Times, he acknowledged some fifteenfamilies by name in Rhode Island alone who took him into their “homes andhearths,” although he possessed “few of the graces derived from free and refinedsociety.”22 [notes.html#ch7fn_22a] Reformers, like artists, need patrons, oftenperpetually.Lynn was an address as much as a residence for Douglass. But the thrivingindustrial center produced 3 million pairs of shoes annually by the 1840s. Somenine miles north of Boston and five miles south of Salem, Lynn had 9,375inhabitants in 1840. With a strong contingent of Quakers, the town had supportedan antislavery society since 1832, and by 1838 when the Eastern Railroad wascompleted along its southern edge by the harbor, it sported three newspapers,almost 130 manufactories employing nearly three thousand workers, a dozenchurches, nine schools, and ten hotels. In the year the Douglasses arrived, Lynnopened the new Lyceum Hall on Market Street, and it supported a thriving musicalculture. John, Asa, Judson, and Abby Hutchinson, soon to be the famousabolitionist Hutchinson Family Singers, had just taken up residence in town andwould soon be good friends and occasional traveling partners with Douglass.23[notes.html#ch7fn_23a]These were heady and inspiring months for the twenty-three-year-old Douglass ashe found his voice and individual style. As superlative reactions to Douglass’soratory began to follow nearly every appearance, it is easy to neglect hisstartling youth. Abolitionist Edmund Quincy wrote privately in October 1841 thatsome in the audience at one of Douglass’s speeches thought that he (Quincy) hadwritten the address for the young black man. So remarkable was the “favorableimpression,” said Quincy wryly, that “some of the people were amazed that anigger could talk so well.” This is where responses to Douglass’s voice began inthe 1840s: How could this bright and eloquent brown-hued man be the slave heclaimed to be? A local newspaper editor, at a speech in Hingham, Massachusetts,in November, gushed, “As this Douglass stood there in manly attitude, with erectform, and glistening eye, and deep-toned voice, telling us that he had beensecretly devising means to effect his release from bondage, we could not helpthinking of Spartacus, the Gladiator.” The auditor made the most of his manlymetaphors. Douglass was the “daring insurgent . . . a man of . . . shrewdness,and . . . power both intellectually and physically.” Stunned at Douglass’sfluency with language, the editor described him as “forcible, keen and verysarcastic . . . a remarkable man.”24 [notes.html#ch7fn_24a] Such masculine,almost erotic descriptions of Douglass became commonplace throughout hisspeaking career, even into old age.“This Douglass” was a performer. A Lynn resident, David N. Johnson, in a book ofreminiscences, recalled Douglass as though from a series of theatrical events.He was “more than six feet in height, and his majestic form . . . straight as anarrow, muscular, yet lithe and graceful,” seemed like nothing else Johnson hadever witnessed in all the lectures he attended at Lynn’s Lyceum Hall. Douglass’s“flashing eye, and more than all, his voice, that rivaled [Daniel] Webster’s inits richness, and in the depth and sonorousness of its cadences, made up such anideal of an orator as the listeners never forgot.” Even more, the youngabolitionist’s “burning words, his pathos . . . [and] the rich play of hishumor” left greater impressions. Douglass already possessed the skills of atrained actor; his voice was musical in the fullest sense. “His eyes would flashwith defiance, and now grow dim with emotions he could not control; and the rollof his splendid voice . . . would pass to the minor key whose notes trembled onhis tongue.” Douglass’s performative fame spread so widely and quickly thatnotices about this “black rascal” appeared even in Southern newspapers.25[notes.html#ch7fn_25a]Who would not have wanted to see and hear this Douglass in a golden age oforatory? The great activist Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who later tangled bitterlywith Douglass over the priority of women’s or black male suffrage duringReconstruction, first saw Douglass speak in Boston in 1842 and left anunforgettable remembrance. “He stood there like an African prince,” wroteStanton in 1895, “conscious of his dignity and power, grand in his physicalproportions, majestic in his wrath, as with keen wit, satire, and indignation heportrayed the bitterness of slavery.” According to Stanton, Douglass renderedthe large Faneuil Hall audience “completely magnetized with his eloquence,laughing and crying by turns.” She also recalled that especially in the 1840s,Douglass’s most popular topic was his “Slaveholder’s Sermon,” his famous mimicryof a Methodist preacher’s appeals to slaves, based on the biblical text“Servants, obey your masters.” She claimed that even after Douglass had heldforth on other topics for an hour, audiences would shout and demand, “Douglass,give us the sermon.”26 [notes.html#ch7fn_26a] And he rarely failed to entertainas he also blistered his listeners with abolitionist fervor.In the winter and spring of 1842, Douglass was on the road almost constantly,preaching about clerical hypocrisy, exalting moral suasion, and assaulting thepolitical methods of the Liberty Party, even putting his shoulder, if not hisheart, into the utopian Garrisonian notion of disunionism. The “Slaveholder’sSermon” quickly became the standard of his repertoire. “Douglass gave it to thechurch with much vim,” wrote one Garrisonian devotee to her sister approvinglyafter attending his speech in Weymouth, Massachusetts, in April 1842.27[notes.html#ch7fn_27a]That he delivered this performance so often and effectively is due to its humor,to its constant use of parallelism and antithesis, and to its resonance inChristian New England. Garrisonianism was above all a religious-social crusadeagainst the conscience and sloth of the faithful. But the “sermon” was alsofunny, and its author could alter the tone, scene, or length to fit theoccasion. Douglass often began by reciting the story of the Reverend IsaacBonney in New Bedford separating blacks from whites for Communion. But oneSunday Bonney blundered. After a baptism in which several white and one blackwoman had been anointed “in the same water,” the Communion cup was passed. Afoolish, abolitionist-leaning deacon saw the black woman step in line betweenthe whites, so he handed her the cup. But when “the precious blood which hadbeen shed for all” reached the next white woman, “she rose in disdain and walkedout of the church.” Brimming for the sarcastic kill, the orator did not stopthere. “Another young lady fell into a trance,” barked Douglass. “When sheawoke, she declared she had been to Heaven; her friends were all anxious to knowwhat and whom she had seen there.” One “good old lady” especially needed to know“if she saw any black folks in Heaven?” Then came the punch line: “Oh! I didn’tgo in the kitchen!”28 [notes.html#ch7fn_28a] Douglass paced to another positionon the platform awaiting the howling laughter to subside.Rooted in memories of watching Thomas Auld weep during his confessions in thering at the Methodist camp meeting on the Eastern Shore, in Edward Covey’sprayer sessions, and in his New Bedford preaching experience, Douglass saved hisbest for the Christian hypocrisy of the South. If he spoke in a church or hallwith a gallery, he made special use of the setting, as he did in 1842 at FaneuilHall in Boston. Peering up into the horseshoe balcony of that great arena beforefour thousand people, and spreading his arms out widely, he appealed as thoughto the slaves set apart in the gallery of a Southern church. With a mockingSouthern accent, he called out, “And you too my friends have souls of infinitevalue—souls that will live through endless happiness or misery in eternity. Oh,labor diligently to make your calling and election sure. Oh, receive into yoursouls these words of the holy apostle—‘Servants, be obedient to your masters.”Amid “shouts of laughter and applause,” Douglass pranced on the stage and drovehis point home. “Oh, consider the wonderful goodness of God! Look at your hard,horny hands, your strong muscular frames, and see how mercifully he has adaptedyou to the duties you are to fulfill . . . while to your masters, who haveslender frames and long delicate fingers, he has given brilliant intellects,that they may do the thinking, while you do the working.”29[notes.html#ch7fn_29a]Douglass eventually boiled down these tales into a compelling assertion ofcontrasts that he used throughout the 1840s. By 1845 he could rip it off at amoment’s notice, often right after reciting the Golden Rule: “In America Biblesand slaveholders go hand in hand. The church and the slave prison standtogether, and while you hear the chanting of psalms in one, you hear theclanking of chains in the other. The man who wields the cowhide during the week,fills the pulpit on Sunday. . . . The man who whipped me in the week usedto . . . show me the way of life on the Sabbath.”30 [notes.html#ch7fn_30a]A star had been born; a youthful, brilliant black voice of a fugitive slave hadentered the fray of abolitionism. At a mere twenty-four years old Douglassstepped out now on countless platforms to preach a Garrisonian ideologicalmixture of radicalism and personal testimony. Soon, he carried abolitionistfervor and rhetoric, as well as the Frederick Douglass story, across theNorthern states in a crusade he increasingly made his own."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 8--------------------------------------------------------------------------------GARRISONIAN IN MIND AND BODYThese hands—are they not mine?

You don’t get rid of me so easily. . . .If I go to Lexington or Bunker Hill, there I’m a slave, chained in perpetualservitude. I may go to your deepest valley, to your highest mountain, I’m stilla slave, and the bloodhound may chase me down.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, AN ADDRESS IN NEW YORK CITY, MARCH 6, 1845From 1842 to 1845, Douglass took his flourishing mind, his increasinglyconfident voice, and his Garrisonian body to the open road. His travel andspeaking itineraries almost defy belief, and his devotion to Garrisonianideology remained steadfast. From late March to early May 1842 he did anintensive tour of eastern and central Massachusetts. On this, his first solotour, he spoke in at least forty-two different towns or small villages, oftenvisiting two towns in a single day and lecturing twice in the same place in asingle day. Immediately upon ending the Massachusetts tour, Douglass caught thetrain for New York, where he participated along with three thousand fellowabolitionists in the annual meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society (AASS)at the Broadway Tabernacle.At this New York meeting he likely first met James McCune Smith, a physician andintellectual, and the most educated African American in the United States. Theirrelationship would be long and enduring, although it would take time to develop;the young fugitive slave and gifted orator, soon to be a sterling writer withouta day of formal schooling, and the New York–born man of learning with threeadvanced degrees from the University of Glasgow in Scotland would become withina decade an extraordinary story of creative alter egos. No record survives oftheir first conversations, but they did speak up for the same resolutionsupporting an appeal to the US Supreme Court testing whether blacks possessedthe “privileges and immunities of citizens.”1 [notes.html#ch8fn_1a]Image [../images/f0117-01.jpg]James McCune Smith, 1840s. Engraving by Patrick H. Reason.In the early 1840s, as abolitionism underwent the bitter schisms between moralsuasionists and the advocates of political action, Smith remained ideologicallya partial Garrisonian, a member of the AASS, but one who chose his allegiancespragmatically. Only five years older than Douglass, Smith was born a slave, butfreed in the 1827 New York emancipation law. He had a thriving medical practicein lower Manhattan by the 1840s and already flourished as an essayist on manysubjects; he was never the itinerant lecturer that his younger friend became.Douglass, however, took to the antislavery circuit constantly, performing as aloyal disciple of his mentor. For a week in June 1842, Douglass toured for thefirst time with Garrison as they barnstormed through meetings in six towns onCape Cod. This tour also included George Bradburn, a Unitarian minister fromAttleboro, Massachusetts, who never fully embraced Garrisonianism, but was afrequent companion of Douglass’s on the circuit. Bradburn never adhered to thedoctrine of antipolitics since he was the Whig Party representative fromNantucket in the Massachusetts legislature. The primary theme of the Cape Codtour was nonresistance, the strict adherence to pacifism that Garrisonadvanced.2 [notes.html#ch8fn_2a]Antislavery meetings that trumpeted nonresistance gave Garrison yet anotheropportunity to use Douglass, as Garrison also vigorously promoted Douglass’scareer. After Garrison spoke at length in support of moral suasion andnonresistance at the Barnstable meeting, Douglass took the platform and did hisjob with apparent fervor. Garrison’s description of Douglass’s speech is astunning example of the mentor’s unending effort to employ every element of theformer slave’s persona, his words, his very body, in the service of the cause.Douglass “stood there as a slave,” announced Garrison, “a runaway from thesouthern house of bondage—not safe for even one hour, even on the soil ofMassachusetts—with his back all horribly scarred by the lash.” One cannot helpwondering, in these years when the two men became close associates, and withGarrison so often referring to Douglass’s physical scars, whether the young starorator ever actually showed his naked back to his mentor. Whether he did so ornot, Garrison claimed Douglass had every right to be the “fierce outlaw and thestern avenger.” Instead, Garrison pointed to his prime exhibit as the “genius ofChristianity.” That Douglass could rise on such occasions not to advocateretaliation, nor to “wade through blood to liberty” no matter how justified, butto preach with “forgiveness in his heart,” made him a model for the potential“overthrow of every form of oppression on earth.”3 [notes.html#ch8fn_3a] Onewonders how much the youthful Douglass, inspired and proud to be on platformsnext to Garrison, really believed in such utopian sensibilities. Not forevercould his personal rage against slavery be contained in a pacifist ideologicalpackage.At one of the Cape Cod meetings the three abolitionists spoke to a resolution:“Resolved, that a Christian cannot fight, with weapons, against his enemies, orthe enemies of others; nor take the life of his fellow-man, nor assist orempower others to take it, either in self-defense or as a penalty for crime.”4[notes.html#ch8fn_4a] Douglass had many times violated this maxim during hislife as a slave. For now he was all but swallowed up in an antislavery theology,and he managed to preach its creeds with anyone, as long as he was free to tellhis own story, to pillory the proslavery clergy, and begin to expose Northernracism in his own style.In his portrayals of Douglass, Garrison could be exultant in one sentence andcondescending in the next. When Douglass spoke in support of the nonresistanceresolution, Garrison saw the “power of an unsophisticated mind and the glow ofan earnest heart.” Douglass’s words left a “visible impression” on the audience.In other words, Garrison got everything he wanted from his star pupil. At yetanother Cape Cod stop, Centerville, Garrison said Douglass spoke“experimentally” in unmasking the “abominable hypocrisy” of Southern religion.Here, Garrison found his own awkward way to praise Douglass’s emerging craft ofmimicry. Perhaps white leader and black follower both rolled their eyes abouteach other in private. As an observer in North Dennis remarked, the young blackman “gave us a good proof of the freedom of his mind . . . his wit and power ofsarcasm.”5 [notes.html#ch8fn_5a] He was at once Garrison’s experiment and hisown, emerging self-invention. Amid all the moral earnestness of an abolitionistmeeting, Douglass had learned how to leave them laughing.At the Hyannis meeting on June 20, in a Baptist church, Douglass experimented inyet another way. Giving testimony of “what his own eyes had seen,” he “read alarge amount of evidence . . . given by southern men . . . proving the entireslave system to be diabolical.” Here Douglass likely read detailed descriptionsfrom Theodore Weld’s American Slavery as It Is, a technique he would usefrequently in the 1840s. Published in 1839, Weld’s moral-suasionist classic, anunprecedented compilation of the horrors of slave treatment and punishment drawnfrom travelers’ accounts, newspapers, and slaveholders’ own writings, was astorehouse of slavery’s inhumanity. Douglass would often read at length a litanyof statements about the numbers of lashes applied to slaves for certainoffenses, and the physical brutalities and scars left on slaves’ bodies asreported in runaway advertisements. What a compelling scene it must have beenfor an audience listening to Douglass, in his pounding baritone, referencing hisown scars, then performing from Weld’s lists of mutilations, burnings,shootings, and images of “ears cut off,” hands “cut with an axe,” chains arounda slave’s neck, and the like.6 [notes.html#ch8fn_6a] Douglass found his own waysto make moral suasion penetrate the heart by more than mere assertion; helearned how to leave them weeping.In the early 1840s Garrisonian abolitionists caused a violent response aroundNew England and the Northeast. Douglass continued his backbreaking travel in thelate summer of 1842, returning to abolitionist conventions in New Bedford and onNantucket (on the first anniversary of his original public appearance).Anti-abolition mobs attacked both gatherings. In New Bedford the mob seems tohave been content with shouting down the speakers, but on Nantucket on August11, ruffians disrupted the gathering, with Garrison, Collins, Douglass, andStephen Foster all on the platform, by “hooting, screeching, throwing brick-batsand other missiles” through windows. On the following day, trying again toassemble, the meeting heard Douglass attack racism in the North as the cause of“exciting mobs against the colored people—preventing them from taking theirplaces in society as equal members.” And the mob was ready to enact their partof this dangerous ritual. This time the mob’s numbers and weapons, including a“shower of rotten eggs,” were such that the meeting finally adjourned in chaos.7[notes.html#ch8fn_7a]• • •In one full year on the antislavery circuit Douglass had now collected many suchbadges of honor—well-publicized instances of being thrown off railcars, brickshurled at his head, hooligans shouting “nigger” and bringing greater attentionto abolitionist ideas as well as free speech. Even clearer now was that for atwenty-four-year-old black man with growing fame and an astonishing new voice,abolitionism was a dangerous business. But in this romantic age, the radicalreformer who did not trouble the waters and stir the ire of his foes might beignored. Ideas, spiritual passion, personal witness, and brazen effrontery wereall part of the tactical repertoire. A fast learner, Douglass threw himselfavidly into this fray, even as he traveled with a Garrisonian ideological cloak.During a mere week’s respite at home in Lynn in August, Douglass spoke at alarge nonresistance meeting at the Lyceum Hall. Growing in confidence andboldness, he spoke about the nature of prayer. As reported by Nathaniel Rogers,Douglass argued that the “most effectual sort of prayer” was “DOING!” and not“saying.” In what likely seemed the voice of an angry young man to his Christianneighbors, he said his prayers in “words” had never been answered as a slave.Only his own action by running away to freedom achieved a prayer answered.Rogers found Douglass “especially eloquent and powerful.”8 [notes.html#ch8fn_8a]No brickbats flew in Lynn.Douglass had hardly been home at all during that first full summer on thecircuit. Now, sponsored by Garrison’s office in Boston, and after hasty hellosand good-byes to Anna and the three small children, he headed out on a two-monthcrusade through New York State with seven other agents employed by the AASS,including Abby Kelley, the female sensation of the movement. Seven years olderthan Douglass, Kelley was born to a Quaker farm family in the rural hills ofwestern Massachusetts, worked as a schoolteacher in Lynn, and eventually livednear Worcester. By 1840 she had emerged as one of the most tireless and militantspeakers among the Garrisonians. Kelley was pretty, wore plain gray dresses, andat least in these early years skillfully argued the moral-suasionist caseagainst slavery and for women’s equality. She bought in fully to Garrison’s formof perfectionism, was a staunch nonresistant, and for now denounced politicalparties. Soon she would marry Stephen Foster, an abolitionist from NewHampshire, and they would form a radical married couple like few others. She wassharp-tongued, and as adept as any of her male counterparts at abolitionistfactional infighting. She wowed audiences even as they detested her verypresence in public forums as a woman. Many a church sanctuary or town hall wasclosed to the troupe because of her leading role in antislavery tours, but theypressed on nonetheless, holding meetings in groves, meadows, and on towngreens.9 [notes.html#ch8fn_9a]Douglass was at first awed by Kelley and understood that he was the secondbilling on this grueling New York crusade, much of which Kelley had planned, inconcert with Collins, the physician Erasmus D. Hudson, and the AASS executivecommittee, as a grand effort to revitalize local antislavery societies. In apromotional letter detailing the dates of “conventions” in twenty-four counties,Collins touted Kelley and Douglass as the headliners, declaring it “well worth ajourney of forty miles to listen to the eloquent pleadings of FREDERICKDOUGLASS, the fugitive from our ‘Peculiar Institutions.’ ” Garrison eventuallydubbed Kelley the “moral Joan of Arc of the world,” and Douglass, so young andinexperienced with ideas about women’s equality and with learned women, likelygained his first feminist education from the Quaker woman whom he watched facingall manner of vicious repression.10 [notes.html#ch8fn_10a] He was part ofsomething new—an angry, radical beloved community, a salvation show travelingthrough the Burned-Over District.Douglass joined Kelley, Hudson, Collins, and others in Rochester on August 26,more than two weeks into the tour. Hudson was an especially passionate,doctrinaire Garrisonian who kept a remarkable journal along the way. On thisfirst visit to his future home, Douglass found Rochester hospitable. On thesecond night of the meetings, Douglass joined other abolitionists at the home ofAmy and Isaac Post, local Quaker abolitionists; their meeting was the beginningof a long and abiding friendship. The abolitionists tried to convene meetings ata Presbyterian church, only to have the minister throw them out due to Kelley’spresence. Gathering in yet a different church, Collins and Hudson were verballyattacked by a heckler for their claims against religious hypocrisy. Rising todefend his colleagues, Douglass, reported Hudson, chastised the assailant byusing Christ’s warnings to “scribes, Pharisees, and hypocrites, vipers, lawyers,whited sepulchers and making Congregational prayers.” Douglass would have drawnfrom Matthew, Isaiah, or other parts of God’s denunciations of the appearancesof the good—“ye blind guides”—among those who do evil. Furious over church doorsslammed in abolitionists’ faces, Douglass commanded everyone’s attention withsuch biblical ridicule as “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! Forye are like unto whited sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, butare within full of dead men’s bones.”11 [notes.html#ch8fn_11a] Ever ready withGod’s voice from the King James text when he needed it, one imagines Douglassrebuking the heckler, Bible in hand.Image [../images/f0122-01.jpg]Abby Kelley Foster, 1850s. Daguerreotype.Holding meetings in some nineteen towns, the intrepid abolitionist band trekkedon, staying wherever they could find friendly accommodations. They traveled infarm wagons, in carriages and commercial stagecoaches, on the Erie Canal, andwhere possible on railroads. In the decade or so after the completion of theErie Canal in 1825, the new commercial waterway connecting western New York, andtherefore the Midwest, with the port of New York, frontier settlements along theroute transformed into the thriving market and manufacturing towns of Albany,Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, and Buffalo. From 1820 to 1850 Rochester alone grewfrom a population of 1,502 to 36,403. Waves of religious revivalists,spiritualists, utopian socialists, millers, small-scale merchants, as well asdroves of hard-drinking, tobacco-chewing immigrant laborers settled in thesebooming cities.12 [notes.html#ch8fn_12a]Abolitionists such as the Kelley-Douglass band of 1842 across New York sought toharness the anxieties and hopes of this emerging middle class undergoing socialand economic transformations. Radical abolitionists were a religious andpolitical threat to this new social order. Their task was far from simple; sometowns turned out large audiences, but in others they were met with shutteredchurch buildings or violently hostile mobs. At Vienna, Hudson recorded, a mob“pelted” the speakers with “a shower of brick bats & stones, and threw a littlepig up into our hall.” With the meeting broken up, the abolitionists retreatedto the railroad depot. At Port Byron, Kelley spoke to an overflow crowd of fourhundred at the National Hotel, amid “continual hissing and murmuring.” When theBaptist meetinghouse in Ithaca threw the band of lecturers out of its eveningsession, they “adjourned into God’s house—the open air”—and held their impromptumeeting in the courthouse square. Some in the mob eventually climbed to thetower and rang the courthouse bell to break up the meeting. Sometimes, when theycould not secure a venue, they held an antislavery meeting in a tavern, as theydid in late September in Trumansburg, on Cayuga Lake. Itinerant antislaveryactivism was a lonely, dangerous, and frustrating vocation. As Hudson put it,they were out to morally assault the conscience of every community, so many ofwhich they found “full of slavery, war & all evil.” Rejection became their badgeof honor, one brickbat and epithet at a time. They were the suffering servantsin Isaiah, and happy to remind all who would listen, “He is despised andrejected of men . . . he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised forour iniquities . . . and with his stripes we are healed.”13[notes.html#ch8fn_13a]By the early 1840s, a decade of major railroad expansion, the New York CentralRailway was completed along most of the route of the Erie Canal. Yet many of thetowns and villages on the 1842 AASS tour, as well as countless more to follow inthe coming years for Douglass, were not on railroad lines. Abolitionists weremasters of the new technologies of printing and mass dissemination of newspapersand information, as well as eager adherents of the transportation revolution ofthe era. But for a troupe of four to eight antislavery lecturers, one of them acourageous independent, unmarried woman, travel was a saga of daily hardship aswell as adventure. Broken braces underneath a stagecoach led to countlessaccidents and injuries. Famous English travelers such as Charles Dickens andHarriet Martineau left compelling and witty remembrances of their experiences onAmerican railroads, canals, and in stagecoaches. From his journeys through NewEngland and out to Ohio and the upper Mississippi Valley in 1842, Dickens madeunforgettable observations about the travails of stagecoach travel. He rode theentire south-to-north length of Ohio in both the large twelve-seat mail coachand a four-horse, four-passenger “extra” stage that in some areas one could rentexclusively. Corduroy roads, made by “throwing tree trunks into a marsh,” nearly“dislocated all the bones in the human body,” wrote Dickens. On an especiallybad road on a stormy night the passengers at one point were “all flung togetherin a heap at the bottom of the coach, and at another we were crushing our headsagainst the roof.” Dickens saved most of his sarcasm for the “dirty, sullen, andtaciturn” coachman who spoke only in monosyllables and cared far more for hishorses than his passengers.14 [notes.html#ch8fn_14a]Martineau and Dickens were both enthralled by the railroads and by the beautyand scale of American landscapes. Martineau, however, found American “travellingmanners . . . anything but amiable.” But she was entranced with the engineeringachievement of the Erie Canal during her mid-1830s journeys, and she thoughtrailroads a revolution without end for America. Like Alexis de Tocqueville justbefore her, Martineau left an indelible impression of a society constantly onthe move, advancing the communication and transportation revolutions. All thisshe gushed over before writing the longest chapter of her Society in America,“Morals of Slavery,” a penetrating, compassionate, but outraged examination ofslavery’s threat to all that America promised. Dickens too stopped to observethat “as a black man never travels with a white one, there is also a negro car,which is a great, blundering, clumsy chest, such as Gulliver put to sea in, fromthe kingdom of Brobdingnag.” In such conveyances, under such conditions, day inand day out, Douglass, Kelley, and their companions spread the antislaverygospel across the hills and dales of the Northern landscapes—at four miles perhour on canals, six to eight on stagecoaches, and perhaps twenty or thirty onthe iron horse. Since most of them were teetotalers, at least they did not haveto share Dickens’s disgust at being forced to drink bad tea and coffee at a“Temperance Hotel” where a glass of brandy was “not to be had for love ormoney.”15 [notes.html#ch8fn_15a]The New York tour ended in Cooperstown on October 25, and as the companydisbanded, Douglass returned to Lynn. But he was quickly caught up in the causecélèbre of a fugitive slave named George Latimer, a case that would preoccupyNew England abolitionism for many months to come. Douglass could not have beenhome with his family more than three days when he hurried to Boston to speak toa crowd of four thousand people on a subject dear to his heart.The streets of Boston swarmed with competing crowds either resisting orsupporting the arrest of Latimer on October 19. Early that month, Latimer, alight-skinned slave from Norfolk, Virginia, and his pregnant wife, Rebecca, hadfled aboard a ship to Boston; because he had long worked around the maritimebusinesses of Norfolk and passed for white, he bought passage for two, and hiswife traveled as his servant. Within their first week in Boston they wereidentified by a James Gray, a former employee of Latimer’s owner in Virginia.Gray’s slave-catcher agents had George arrested; quickly the news spread to theblack community on Beacon Hill in Boston, and antislavery friends secretly hidRebecca. As a crowd of at least three hundred mostly black protesters kept up atense and loud vigil outside the jailhouse for several nights, demandingLatimer’s release under a writ of habeas corpus, Massachusetts chief justiceLemuel Shaw ruled that Gray had a right to retrieve the jailed man under thefederal fugitive slave law of 1793. As abolitionist lawyers obtained acontinuance for Latimer, he was kept in jail under an agreement between Gray andthe jailor. But as the captor and jailor became unnerved by the increasinglyaggressive abolitionist protests, Gray, rather than allow police to take Latimerback and forth to the courthouse for his trial, offered to sell the fugitive,first for $800, then settling under pressure for $400 in late November.16[notes.html#ch8fn_16a]Latimer was freed to abolitionist Boston’s jubilation, but not before a wave ofrowdy “Latimer meetings” and rallies spread across New England, a new journalwas founded in his name, and a massive petition drive began demanding repeal ofthe federal fugitive slave law. At a Faneuil Hall meeting, a crowd packed to therafters became so noisy and disruptive that the speakers, including Garrison,Wendell Phillips, Charles Lenox Remond, and Douglass could hardly be heard.Despite the turmoil, Douglass, according to press reports, shouted and“gesticulated” for about twenty minutes and “tried to tell them he was a slave,and what were his fears for himself and hundreds of his brethren.” With theNorthern, freeborn African American Remond as companion, Douglass then took tothe road for many days using the Latimer crisis to spread the antislavery worduntil his voice gave out and he fell sick.17 [notes.html#ch8fn_17a]At home in Lynn, allowing Anna to nurse his ailing throat, Douglass wrote hisfirst of many public letters to Garrison, and thereby to the Liberator’sreaders. In quite formal language, Douglass reported as a good disciple aboutthe New Bedford Latimer meetings. He described large crowds that “needed nobells to remind them of their duty to bleeding humanity.” Under the urgency ofthe Latimer fugitive case, Douglass reported the Garrisonian machine inwell-oiled form: “Not a word was lost; it was good seed, sown in good ground, bya careful hand; it must, it will bring forth fruit.” He spoke an hour himself on“the question as to whether a man is better than a sheep,” then sat down “seizedwith a violent pain” in his chest and shortness of breath. That winter and intothe spring of 1843, Douglass celebrated the sixty-five thousand signatures onthe “monster petition” delivered to the Massachusetts legislature and applaudedthe personal-liberty law passed in March that forbade state officers fromparticipating in the arrest of fugitive slaves. On a few occasions he appearedwith Latimer himself, with Douglass doing most of the speaking about the plightof fugitives. As he turned twenty-five years old, Douglass now knew his calling,and something of the physical, personal, and intellectual demands of working inthe ideological world of the Garrison church.18 [notes.html#ch8fn_18a]Into the spring and summer of 1843 Douglass rarely escaped the speaking circuitof Massachusetts and Rhode Island for more than one week at a time. One can onlyguess at how Anna coped, binding shoes and nursing children in Lynn. How manysharp-tongued rebukes did she give her husband, or were they simply long sighs,as he told her a day or so after arriving at home that he would be in Worcesteror Providence or some other town for the next several days? Or did he tell herthe itineraries at all? One might imagine that Anna lived vicariously throughthe travels of her peripatetic, increasingly famous husband. But she might justas likely have been too worried about a child’s winter cough or taking in aneighbor’s washing for extra money to wish to know where all those countlesstowns existed on a map. Certainly she worried about Frederick’s safety andhealth out on the road, facing anti-abolition mobs.• • •By any measure, the Garrisonians were uncompromising in their goals and tactics.Theirs was a biblically driven approach to the social and personal sin ofslaveholding. Slavery in America was a national sin with many complicitousinstitutions, none more so than churches and the clergy, but also politicalparties and governments themselves at both state and federal levels. In his 1843tours Douglass spoke in favor of one resolution after another advocating thedissolution of the Union and against “political action” as corrupt andinadequate. He supported abolitionists’ disruption of church worship services tocondemn ministers and congregants to their faces, while saving most of hisenergy for his popular “Slaveholder’s Sermon” performances. Eventually theirquest for purity of motive and strategy would drive the Garrisonians into aself-destructive isolation. Neither uncertainty nor ambivalence troubled thisband of holy warriors, and Douglass appeared for now as one of their firmestvoices. He proposed resolutions of his own, such as the one he announced at aWorcester County Anti-Slavery Society gathering on February 2: “Resolved, thatthe hands of the American church are full of blood, and that she is not, whileshe continues thus, what she assumes to be, the heaven-appointed instrumentalityfor reforming the world.” Douglass disturbed as he also inspired audiences,accusing proslavery churches of refusing to see the “pit of slavery” they helpedcreate. “On their way to . . . the mountain to discuss some new topic,” hedeclared, ministers and their deacons “spread over this pit” the priest’s“pontifical robe.”19 [notes.html#ch8fn_19a] He performed this part of theGarrisonian repertoire better than anyone else.But Douglass also played in season and out in his most expected role—as personalwitness to the slaves’ trauma. In March 1843, Anne Weston wrote to her sisterMaria, who ran Garrison’s headquarters in Boston, telling of seeing Douglassspeak to a full house and feeling somewhat disappointed that he dwelled on hisslave past. “He was more in the narrative and familiar vein & kept the audiencelaughing all the time. . . . He was eloquent occasionally, but as he was tellinghis own experience, there was not so much chance for flowers of rhetoric asmight be.” Such were now the burdens of expectation on the young abolitionist’sshoulders, even among his friends. At a meeting in Lowell, Massachusetts, inApril, appearing again with Latimer, Douglass made a typical pronouncement: “Iam one of the things of the South!” “Drawing himself up to his full height, andspreading his arms wide,” wrote an observer, Douglass declared, “Behold thething!” With such performances, wrote his auditors, Douglass could “move theaudience at will”; they “would hang upon his lips with staring eyes and openmouths.”20 [notes.html#ch8fn_20a] Still tethered to the organization’sideological prescriptions, Douglass nevertheless made his mind and body into astory that his thousands of listeners would never forget.Douglass spoke at the tenth annual meeting of the AASS in New York City, andthen at a raucous, mob-disrupted gathering in Hartford, Connecticut, in thesecond and third weeks of May 1843. At the Hartford meeting Douglass was tauntedwith shouts of “nigger” and, with several abolitionist comrades, was thrown outof a hall, pelted with stones and eggs, and forced to speak on a makeshift boxon the street, where the group made the right of free speech as much theirsubject as moral suasion.21 [notes.html#ch8fn_21a] Douglass then retreated toLynn for a respite and to prepare for the biggest tour the Garrisonians had evermounted—the One Hundred Conventions campaign throughout the remainder of 1843.From July to December the board of managers of the AASS sponsored an ambitioustour, projected to be one hundred meetings in at least five Northern states(Vermont, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Pennsylvania) and with a goal of spreadingthe “truth before from three to five hundred thousand people.” The six primarylecturers were Douglass, George Bradburn, Charles Lenox Remond, James Monroe,John Collins, and Jacob Ferris. Occasionally they would be joined by AbbyKelley, William A. White of Massachusetts, and Sydney Howard Gay of New YorkCity. The troupes of speakers were to live off the land, so to speak, relying onabolitionist friends in every city or rural town. In the weeks before the firstofficial convention, in Middlebury, Vermont, Douglass threw himself intofund-raising meetings in New Hampshire and Massachusetts. As he laterremembered, he “never entered upon any work with more heart and hope.” It wouldtake a great deal of both, as well as sheer stamina and physical courage, tosurvive. By now Douglass knew how tumultuous abolitionist meetings andpersonalities could be. In June he wrote to Abby Kelley, describing a meeting hehad just attended in Concord, New Hampshire, as “disgraceful, alarming, divided,united, glorious, and most effective.”22 [notes.html#ch8fn_22a] In the comingtour he would need deep reserves of this sense of wit and irony. As a broadmovement abolitionists were not united.Embroiled now in a bitter rivalry with the emerging abolitionist Liberty Party,founded in part by the writer and activist Alvan Stewart of upstate New York,the Garrisonians attacked the political abolitionists as they were alsoconfronted and pilloried by them nearly everywhere they went. Libertyites urgedtheir followers to either boycott or disrupt the Hundred Conventions campaign.In the college town of Middlebury, Vermont, students, Douglass said, “placardedthe town with violent aspersions” against the lecturers, accusing Douglass ofbeing an “escaped convict from the state prison.”23 [notes.html#ch8fn_23a]Bracing for such hostility, the activists headed into New York State, and aftera poorly attended meeting in Utica, they moved on to Syracuse, where Douglass inparticular ignited some useful and compelling fireworks.Temporarily the sole lecturer trying to evangelize Syracuse, Douglass found novenue to welcome him for a meeting. So he held forth in a park under a treebefore an audience of five people. Before the day ended, he had churned up acrowd of five hundred, and a Congregational church offered him and hiscolleagues an old abandoned building, where they met for three more days ofspeeches. Collins, Kelley, and Remond soon arrived to help create a full-fledgedconvention. But Collins, a recent convert to communitarianism, turned an entiremorning gathering over to the question of abolishing private property. Afterlistening to Collins’s long speech against property and the abolitionists’alleged obsession with “chattel slavery,” Douglass stood and openly objected. Afierce row ensued with many heated personal exchanges and eventually letterswritten back and forth with the AASS board headquarters in Boston. Douglassreceived a public “reprimand” for what he remembered as “insubordination to mysuperiors.” Douglass believed Collins had hijacked antislavery with anextraneous cause—especially, claimed the former slave, when he argued that“property in the soil is worse than to enslave man.”24 [notes.html#ch8fn_24a]The dispute spread so widely that both men wrote self-defensive letters to MariaWeston Chapman at the AASS board. Collins accused Kelley of instigating theentire affair because she was “intolerant beyond degree” and reported thatDouglass had audibly “groaned” during the property speech, while Remond calledthe very subject “humbug and moonshine.” Douglass defended his public objection.Collins had a perfect right to oppose property, said the black orator, but notby assisting the “destruction” of the slave’s cause. This was ugly; evenCollins’s wife got involved, snidely informing Chapman that Douglass and Remondhad engaged in a “most ungenerous . . . assault.” This seemingly ludicrousdustup was typical of others to follow on this and other tours; these earnestradicals, like those in virtually all such movements before and since, turned oneach other, playing out jealousies, fatigue, ego wars, personality conflicts,and ideological differences. The AASS ignored Douglass’s offer to resign as anagent. Tellingly, he added a quiet PS to his letter to Chapman. A message hadarrived from Anna back home, asking for help to keep the household solvent. “Ihave none to send her,” he informed Chapman. “Will you please see that she isprovided with $25 or $30.”25 [notes.html#ch8fn_25a] In a simple line begging formoney from his benefactors, with whom he was now at odds, we have a small windowinto Douglass’s personal and professional travail at this early juncture in hiscareer. He awoke every day worrying about how to feed his family as well as howto best use his voice to free his fellow slaves. He struggled mightily in tryingto do both.Despite these internecine battles, the crusade surged on to Rochester andBuffalo, where Douglass and Remond would spend all of August 1843, achieving newsuccesses and audiences. In a four-day convention at Rochester, Douglass playedthe central role, advocating the pure Garrisonian resolution that “the press andthe living speaker” were the “only means by which to advance the cause ofabolition.” He later recalled how many Rochester-area abolitionists who hadpledged support of the Liberty Party still allowed the troupe access to churchesand their own homes. The battle among antislavery organizations seemedall-consuming at the time, a struggle Douglass summed up thus: the beliefs thatslavery was either a “creature of law” or a “creature of public opinion.”Reminiscing from the perspective of nearly forty years, he reflected on “howsmall the difference appears as I look back on it . . . yet at the time of itthis difference was immense.” Here in 1843, Douglass likely already sawRochester as a welcoming potential home; he again stayed with the Quakers Amyand Isaac Post. Rochester made the young fugitive feel comfortable and it madehim sing; on August 5, Douglass entertained a congregation with an abolitionsong before delivering his speech.26 [notes.html#ch8fn_26a]At Buffalo, the only meeting space the lecturers could secure was, according toDouglass, “an old dilapidated and deserted . . . post office.” Discouraged bythe turnout of assorted street people and a mere handful of hackmen with whipsin hand in such a bleak venue, Bradburn abandoned Douglass and went to Clevelandto visit relatives. For nearly a week, Douglass held forth alone in thisforsaken dwelling, his audiences “constantly increasing in numbers andrespectability,” until a church opened its doors to an abolition meeting. TheBaptist chapel soon proved too small, and Douglass moved on a Sunday into apark, where, he claimed, a throng of “four or five thousand” heard his“Slaveholder’s Sermon.”27 [notes.html#ch8fn_27a] Douglass played well inBuffalo, and again made a mark with his courage and endurance.One extraordinary eyewitness account survives of Douglass’s daily performancesat the abandoned, windowless post office. A young woman, the daughter of MyronHolley, one of the founders of the Liberty Party in New York, attended every daywith her little girl in tow. She had the “happiness to hear Frederick Douglassmake a speech,” she remembered, at a “poor little meeting—the odds and ends ofthe city—not a soul there I had ever seen.” She had been so excited to hear afugitive slave speak:He rose, and I soon perceived he was all alive. His soul poured out with rarepathos and power. Among other things, he told how a slaveholder would preach toan audience of slaves and take the text: “Servants, be obedient to yourmasters,” and then proceed to say, “the Lord in his providence sent pious soulsover to Africa—dark, heathen, benighted Africa—to bring you into this Christianland, where you can sit beneath the droppings of the sanctuary and hear aboutJesus! The Lord has so established things that only through the channel ofobedience can happiness flow.”Douglass apparently completed this soliloquy with a story about a slave namedSam, who given a task by his master, refused, dropped his hoe, and fell into asummer’s nap on the ground. As the master discovered his bondman’s disobedience,the slaveholder announced from Scripture, “He that knoweth his master’s will,and doeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.” Sam was whipped and thuscould “happiness flow.”28 [notes.html#ch8fn_28a] With his use of these passagesfrom Ephesians and Luke, Douglass pulled his audiences into his web of sarcasmand righteous indignation.Fortuitously for Douglass and Remond, the Conventions tour had arrived inBuffalo just before the scheduled gathering of the 1843 Colored Convention ofnational black leaders. Here for the first time, Douglass joined as a delegatein this thirteen-year-old tradition. Of the seventy-three delegates, Douglassand Remond were the only ones from Massachusetts among the ten statesrepresented. Most were from New York and members of the American and ForeignAnti-Slavery Society as well as of the Liberty Party. The tone of the conventionwas certainly not Garrisonian; the opening address by Samuel Davis of Buffaloasserted African Americans’ citizenship and “equal rights” under the USConstitution.29 [notes.html#ch8fn_29a] Soon the convention was embroiled in oneof the most famous disputes in the history of antebellum black leadership—overwhat manner of resistance to tyranny black people should adopt.Henry Highland Garnet, born a slave on a plantation near New Market, Maryland,in 1815 (only a little more than two years before Douglass), now a Presbyterianminister, superb orator, and leading black proponent of the Liberty Party,electrified the convention with “An Address to the Slaves of the United States.”Through a network of Quaker accomplices, Garnet had escaped slavery along withten other mostly family members at the age of nine, landing safely in New YorkCity, where by 1826 his father saw that he was educated at the African FreeSchool. By the time of the Buffalo convention, Garnet had risen in blacknational leadership like few others and broken with Garrison and moral suasion;he now advocated militant political action and potential revolutionary violenceon the part of slaves.30 [notes.html#ch8fn_30a]Image [../images/f0132-01.jpg]Henry Highland Garnet, 1860s. Engraving.As the audience in Buffalo sat entranced, Garnet threw nonresistance out thewindow with a flourish; he invoked the memory of slave rebels Denmark Vesey,Joseph Cinqué, Madison Washington, and especially the “patriotic NathanielTurner.” He changed the tone and object of such convention gatherings, black orwhite, and demanded that they address the slaves themselves. In terms with whichDouglass would have agreed at first, Garnet drew everyone into the “streams ofblood” that marked slavery’s history: “Slavery had stretched its dark wings ofdeath over the land, the church stood silently by—the priests prophesiedfalsely, and the people loved to have it so.” He named the Declaration ofIndependence, the natural-rights tradition, and Patrick Henry’s famous demandfor “LIBERTY OR DEATH!” Garnet called slaves to their “DUTY TO USE EVERY MEANS,BOTH MORAL, INTELLECTUAL AND PHYSICAL” to attack their condition and theiroppressors. Then came appeals to blood and retribution. Garnet urged AfricanAmericans to confront their masters and argued they had “far better all die—dieimmediately, than live slaves.” How this message was actually to reach theslaves Garnet never indicated. He chastised them for inaction, but he assuredthem, and presumably their instigators, that the “fallen” would have “theirnames . . . surrounded by a halo of glory.” “Let your motto be RESISTANCE!RESISTANCE! RESISTANCE!” he famously proclaimed.31 [notes.html#ch8fn_31a]Douglass apparently squirmed and protested. An intense argument ensued as theconvention debated the merits of Garnet’s address; the author himself tooknearly an hour and a half defending himself. Garnet did not want his wordsamended by an appointed committee and said blacks, slave or free, had waitedlong enough, and that the time had come to “take higher ground and other steps.”As he finished, according to the minutes, the audience “was literally infusedwith tears.” In this swirl of emotions and high-flown rhetoric, Douglass, partlyfrom fledgling Garrisonian principle, but also from an emerging pragmatic andsituational view of violence, objected: Garnet had called for “too much physicalforce,” and Douglass preferred “moral means a little longer.” To advocate“insurrection,” Douglass held, would be irresponsible and result in disaster.Garnet rose to reply and urged slaves to tell their masters they wanted theirliberty; if denied, “we shall take it.” Just who “we” meant was unclear. Justhow this was to be done was even less clear. Douglass soon had the fullrhetorical support of editors and managers back at the Liberator’s offices inBoston. Two more times in the coming two days Douglass spoke vehemently againstissuing Garnet’s “Address” officially from the convention and helped carry thevote against doing so, once by 19–18 and another time by 14–9. Douglass alsovoted against a resolution declaring the delegates’ “duty . . . to vote theLiberty ticket,” but lost that one decisively. This tangle between the twoformer Maryland slaves over the nature and use of violence would endure foreverin the history of black leadership. It would not be the last time Douglassdisagreed publicly with Garnet, but within half a decade they would largelyagree on the uses of violence.32 [notes.html#ch8fn_32a]Having now missed several planned events on the Hundred Conventions tour inOhio, Douglass and Remond hit the road again. They worked only a short time inOhio, speaking at one large event “held in a great shed built for this specialpurpose by abolitionists,” Douglass remembered, with an estimated crowd of athousand in Clinton County, southeast of Dayton. Soon they crossed into Indiana,an anti-abolition terrain the abolitionists had rarely encountered. Inapproximately a week and a half in central Indiana, Douglass and his companions,who now included Bradburn and William A. White, entered the belly of theNorthern proslavery beast. In five towns along their route, settled by migrantsfrom the South, they met mobs nearly everywhere. Rotten eggs and stones anddrunken hooligans were as usual in abundance. But at Pendleton, a short distancenortheast of Indianapolis, an intoxicated gaggle of thirty or so men soughtblood. Bradburn called them “savage looking loafers” making “murderous threats.”The lecturers had tried to hold their meetings in a Baptist church, but the mobconfronted them outside. Gathering on the steps of the church in the evening ofSeptember 15, Douglass, White, and Bradburn waded into the threatening band inwhat White called a “conversational way.” It worked on the first night and theymanaged to make speeches about the “rights of northern working men.”33[notes.html#ch8fn_33a]But the following day, banned from the church grounds, the abolitionists, withtheir 130 local friends, set up a meeting with benches “in the woods.” Led by aman in a coonskin cap, the mob marched on the meeting and surrounded thegathering, and a few jumped on the speakers’ platform and began smashing it topieces. In the melee that followed, Douglass forgot all about nonresistance,grabbed a club, and waded into the crowd. He tried to give as he took and wasbeaten badly to the ground. His life may have been saved when White, seeing hiscomrade fleeing from “hell-hounds” shouting “kill the nigger!” like a “fearfullytrue picture of the flight of the fugitive slave,” threw himself on Douglass’sassailant. According to Douglass’s own remembrances, he was clubbed “prostrateon the ground under a torrent of blows . . . my right hand broken, and in astate of unconsciousness.” White lost teeth and suffered gashes in his head.Douglass was taken in a wagon to the farm of Neal Hardy, a local Quaker, whosewife helped the young orator recover his equilibrium. Along with his woundedcompatriots, he was back on a makeshift platform speaking the next day. Douglasshad experienced much violence before, but never on the abolitionist platform.His right hand was not properly set and, as he recalled many years later, “neverrecovered its natural strength and dexterity.”34 [notes.html#ch8fn_34a]The violence in Indiana remained forever a pivotal experience for Douglass.Within a few years he would date the end of his adherence to nonresistance tothe Pendleton melee. And he would later tell William White how much he loved himfor his bravery in defending him, and for how they “like two very brothers wereready to dare—do, and even die for each other.”35 [notes.html#ch8fn_35a] Onewonders how many times in his ensuing life, as a writer, the man who had escapedCovey’s clutches, Thomas Auld’s whip, Hugh Auld’s epithets, the bloody rumbleson the docks in Baltimore, and hundreds of besotted white men calling him“nigger” would think of that old broken hand gripping the pen as he crafted someof the most magical phrases in American letters. The Pendleton mob may have putzeal in the pen held by the wounded hand.In Indiana, the nerves as well as the bodies of the traveling band ofabolitionists all but disintegrated. A mere week after the Pendleton attacks,the eastern reformers joined the Indiana State Anti-Slavery Society meeting inJonesboro. Relationships were frayed to say only the least, especially amongBradburn, Douglass, and Remond. These abolitionists were anything but unified.Douglass interrupted Bradburn during a long speech about why people objected toabolitionism and tried to direct discussion to other topics. The chair sustainedBradburn. An angry Remond came to Douglass’s defense, and soon apersonality-driven free-for-all of name-calling ensued, with words such as“colored men” and “monkeeism” spit out by Bradburn, and Remond accusing someoneof being a “jackass.” All this ugliness played out in front of public audiences.An Ohio abolitionist, Abraham Brooke, took sides and wrote to Chapman in Boston,suggesting the two black men were at fault; they were “still . . . unregeneratemen,” he claimed, and always desired to be the “lions of the party.” By nowDouglass may indeed have wanted to play the lone lion in these shows.36[notes.html#ch8fn_36a] In the previous two months he had often worked alone,forging an independent voice and his own arguments. He was young, wounded,proud, and growing impatient with some moral-suasionist abstractions, as well asperhaps some of his companions. He did not take direction well anymore, and theleadership back in Boston again took note.Douglass appears to have spent all of October 1843 in Ohio, some of it restingwith antislavery friends in Clinton County, and largely lecturing on his own,his fame as a lone attraction growing as he moved eastward. Ohio newspapersraved about Douglass’s oratory, one saying he left an audience “laughing andweeping at will,” and another concluding that “Mr. D gave proof positive,intellectual proof that . . . he is MAN . . . of very extraordinary mentalpowers.” Even Bradburn admitted “the people wanted to hear Douglass.”37[notes.html#ch8fn_37a]By early November Douglass joined with other lecturers on the HundredConventions tour and, on horseback and an occasional steamboat, moved intoPennsylvania. On one of those boats, the Michigan, riding between New Brightonand Pittsburgh, Douglass “was driven from a table as if he were a dog,” wrote asympathetic observer. In his support, “two young ladies . . . rebuked thisdevilish spirit by leaving the table also.” By now, these Jim Crow episodes,though wounding, only seemed to put more steel in the young reformer’s soul. Heregained his stride and voice, and at many stops, especially a weeklong meetingin Pittsburgh, Douglass stole the show over and over with his “Sermon,” thistime with a popular political twist, drawing Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, andJohn C. Calhoun into his repertoire of impersonations. Here one can see thatDouglass, though still a Garrisonian who could skewer political parties andtheir most famous leaders with withering sarcasm, only pointed to how importantthey nonetheless were in the great debate over slavery’s future. Moreover,everywhere he went, he was the enslaved body and mind breaking out. “DOUGLASS aSLAVE!” wrote an admiring Pittsburgh observer. “Who that heard it, did not feelhis heart leap, as he [Douglass] exclaimed, ‘NO! I am no SLAVE! Your law maymanacle my limbs, but it cannot enslave my spirit—GOD made it free!”38[notes.html#ch8fn_38a]Across Pennsylvania the tour surged, with its second or third wind, culminatingin a big meeting in Philadelphia on December 4–7. By the final stirring day ofthe three-thousand-mile western journey, Douglass had clearly emerged as notonly a star attraction, but as an enormously skilled speaker. A Philadelphiapaper described him as “graceful, winning, fluent, argumentative, logical andconvincing.” He could “transport his hearers,” wrote the witness, “to theregions of rapture, or of comus, and lower them into the deepest feeling forsuffering humanity.”39 [notes.html#ch8fn_39a] Oratorically, Frederick Douglasshad arrived as a great abolitionist voice, as well as a heroic, scarred veteranof the mob’s fury.• • •Douglass resumed a home life with his family for most of two months until lateJanuary 1844. From February through early May he was once again hired to join aneven-larger group of lecturers on what the AASS fashioned as the MassachusettsHundred Conventions tour. This time he would travel with numerous speakers,including Parker Pillsbury and William White, and under the leadership ofWendell Phillips, the organization’s new general agent. At some locationsDouglass also performed next to the Hutchinson Family Singers, as well as AbbyKelley. Douglass respected Phillips enormously, but was not shy about askingthat the speakers’ wages be clearly determined ahead of time. He had a family tofeed, and for fairness, he demanded that each agent be paid equally, which was$7 or $8 per week. Douglass also objected, as he had been asked, to making theLiberty Party “a special object of attack.” He seemed still willing to preachGarrisonian disunionism, but had begun to abandon the antipolitics position. Inat least thirty-one towns all over Massachusetts, some of them as tiny as Atholor Hubbardston, and larger ones such as Northamption or Pittsfield, Douglassspoke many dozens of times. At some sites, as in Groton in March, Douglassreported to Garrison a discouraging declension of the antislavery cause, withmostly empty seats, and those who did fill pews attending “merely to hear thesinging.” At Concord, home to Emerson and Thoreau, he reported a drunken mobthreating the lecturers, and ministers aggressively closing their churches.40[notes.html#ch8fn_40a]Throughout 1844 Douglass continued to tour and speak, although he began to spendmore time in Lynn. He still performed his “Slaveholder’s Sermon” on demand. Andhe still gave full-throated, public fealty to moral suasion and Garrison,declaring in November that “the real, and only-to-be-relied-on movement for theabolition of slavery . . . is a great moral and religious movement . . .quickening and enlightening of the dead conscience of the nation into life.” Butduring 1844 he also began to tell more thoroughly the tales of his slave youth.August of that year included an extensive speaking itinerary in easternPennsylvania as he continued to appear in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Maineas well. By the end of that year almost any town that merited a name inMassachusetts, and so many others across New England, the Northeast, and partsof the Midwest, had seen the face or heard the voice of Frederick Douglass.41[notes.html#ch8fn_41a] His body and mind, as inspiration or threat, were nowpart of the mental imaginations of hundreds of thousands of Americans.On October 21, 1844, Anna gave birth to her fourth child, Charles. Frederickstayed closer to home for now, helping Anna, but also because he had begun towrite his first book. Now he would be a writer. “By my own table,” he declared,“in the enjoyment of freedom, and the happiness of home,” Douglass wrote hisstory. During at least seventeen to eighteen weeks that he remained at home inLynn, writing in his small house on Union Street between December 1844 and May1845, Douglass crafted the soon-to-be internationally famous autobiographyNarrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, Written byHimself. Since at least his teenage years, Douglass had understood the power ofwords; he had rehearsed over and over in oral form the tales of the slave whohad descended into psychic despair, been beaten to his knees, risked all to findfreedom, dreamed his way onto the decks of Chesapeake ships, fought with hishands and his brains to survive, and found in literacy his own way to breathe,dream, speak, and write his path to liberty. Now the twenty-seven-year-oldwielded this weapon of words into a book for the ages.42 [notes.html#ch8fn_42a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 9--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE THOUGHT OF WRITING FOR A BOOK!He would not become soft. It was exhaustion he wanted—it helped him write. Heneeded each of his words to appreciate the weight they bore. He felt like he waslifting them and then letting them drop to the end of his fingers, dragging hismuscle to work, carving his mind open with idea.—COLUM MCCANN, TRANSATLANTIC, 2013, IMAGINING DOUGLASS MEDITATING IN PRIVATE,JUST AFTER HIS ARRIVAL IN IRELAND, FALL 1845The publication of Douglass’s Narrative made him in time the most famous blackperson in the world. Fame had its uses; but he possessed deeper aims both as anabolitionist and as a thinker. He continued to all but mystify himself, muchless the audiences he addressed. In late 1844, in a note accompanying the draftof his first article for publication other than in a newspaper, Douglass musedwith wonder, “I looked exceedingly strange in my own eyes as I sat writing. Thethought of writing for a book!—and only six years since a fugitive from aSouthern cornfield—caused a singular jingle in my mind.”1 [notes.html#ch9fn_1a]The Narrative soon caused an extraordinary literary jingle in the United States;words had now become for him a source of magic, truth, influence, and power.The May 9, 1845, issue of the Liberator carried news of the publication ofDouglass’s Narrative. It also contained verbatim the preface written for thebook by Garrison, as well as a note about Wendell Phillips’s letter ofendorsement, also published with the volume. Both Garrison and Phillipsprominently mentioned Douglass’s marvelous white “sailing ships” metaphor, histeenage vision of freedom while gazing at Chesapeake Bay, from the text. Theyboth seemed to realize they had just read something quite unprecedented in slavenarratives, and in American literature more broadly. They had encountered awriter, although they could not resist portraying him as the necessary exhibitof the cause. Garrison wrote about Douglass with great admiration and a mentor’spride; Garrison also left him saddled with the highest symbolic expectations: tocontinue to be “an ornament to society and a blessing to his race.” Phillipsopenly worried for Douglass’s safety as a fugitive, since he had now revealed socompletely his identity to the world. The Boston Brahmin radical, though, alsoplaced Douglass in high company. Referring to Aesop’s fable of “The Man and theLion,” Phillips asked Douglass to remember when “the lion complained that heshould not be so misrepresented ‘when the lions write history.’ I am glad thetime has come when the ‘lions write history.’ We have been left long enough togather the character of slavery from the involuntary evidence of the masters.”2[notes.html#ch9fn_2a]Soon the young lion, with armloads of his history, would be off to Britain andIreland telling his story. The book became an instant success, selling fivethousand copies in the first four months. By the end of 1847, after Douglass’stwenty-month tour of the British Isles, the bestseller had gone through nineeditions and sold eleven thousand copies. And by 1860, it had sold thirtythousand and been translated into French and German. As Douglass prepared forhis journey to England, his book came out in a paper edition, sold attwenty-five cents apiece, or $2.75 per dozen.3 [notes.html#ch9fn_3a]• • •On Friday evening, August 15, 1845, at the large Lyceum Hall in Lynn, a “Greatgathering” assembled to bid farewell to Douglass, to local abolitionist JamesBuffum, who was to be the black activist’s traveling companion, and to Lynn’sown Hutchinson Family Singers. Asa, John, Judson, and Abby Hutchinson sang tothe throng in “their inimitable strains,” an observer reported. Douglass spokewords of farewell, as he had also done two days earlier in his first Northernhometown of New Bedford. The meeting passed resolutions, especially afavorite-son message to Douglass of deep respect and best wishes in his journeyto “the shores of the Old World.” Buffum was a Lynn neighbor, a former Quakerwho had become a militant Garrisonian radical, who now used his considerablefortune gained as a carpenter, house contractor, and financier to aid theabolitionist cause.4 [notes.html#ch9fn_4a]The press did not report whether Anna and the three children attended, but theymust have been at the young departing hero’s side for this meeting. Rosetta wassix years old, Lewis almost five, and Frederick Jr. almost three and a half asthey watched their father depart now to travel across the sea. These countlessleave-takings were now vivid childhood memories; over time they likely had felt,consciously or not, like abandonments, even as the children would convert thestory into respectful honor toward their famous father and his cause. Theten-month-old Charles would not remember this one, but would recollect many moreleavings and comings later in life. For Anna the farewell celebration of herhusband must have resurrected the fears she harbored on the day Frederick fledBaltimore as she agonizingly awaited word of his safety and the message to joinhim after his escape. But this time he would be gone a year or more, she wouldnot be joining him, and she was left to fend for herself, to care for the broodof little Douglasses, and to rely on their white abolitionist friends forfinancial assistance. We can only imagine Anna’s stoic courage, when theyembraced good-bye, and when he lifted each child in his arms—what future couldthe young hero promise them? Could he truly write and speak his way into aninternational antislavery universe in such a way as to provide for their future,as well as change the world? Was it possible that a voice was enough to build afamily, a career, and some part of a new history? Anna had likely alreadyreached a stage in their difficult but powerful bond where it simply was hers todo and not to ask why.The day after the Lynn gathering, Douglass, Buffum, and the Hutchinsons boardedthe Cambria, the great new 219-foot, wooden side-wheeler steamship of 1,422 tonson the Cunard Line, and were off on their eleven-day voyage to England. On thatSaturday afternoon, a crowd of abolitionist well-wishers gathered on the Bostondocks. The Hutchinsons “sang a song at parting in the time of ‘Cranbambuli,’ ”wrote Asa in his journal, “in which we bid farewell to New England.” The crowdonshore “bid adieu” by swinging hats and handkerchiefs, to which all thepassengers responded with shouts and “copious gushing tears.” The Cambria sailedfirst to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where they were met by the firing of cannons,then crossed the Atlantic to the port of Liverpool, encountering en route manythree-masted ships as well as ominous icebergs. Douglass had experienced thewaves of the Chesapeake, but this first encounter with the rhythms of the openNorth Atlantic may have even included a game of billiards or shuffleboard withthe Hutchinsons. The Cambria, which had made its maiden Atlantic voyage only ayear earlier and was the fastest commercial passenger steamer afloat, rode thewaves like “a wild sea gull,” reported Asa Hutchinson. Within a few days most ofthe passengers suffered from seasickness.5 [notes.html#ch9fn_5a]Despite Buffum’s attempt to buy first-class-cabin accommodations, the ship’scaptain, Charles Judkins, assigned the two abolitionists to steerage belowdecks.Douglass had faced Jim Crow’s ugly ways more times than he could count, but now,on his first ocean voyage and after such a joyous send-off among friends, thisepisode probably stung more than he let on, even as it also became so publiclyuseful. Douglass was content in steerage, he recollected, because theHutchinsons came to visit frequently, singing at his “rude forecastle-deck,”keeping it alive with “music . . . and with spirited conversation.”6[notes.html#ch9fn_6a] Somewhere in relatively calm seas, a day or so before thearrival at Liverpool, though, another kind of storm brewed when Douglass and hisabolitionist friends tried to stage an antislavery meeting at the saloon on themain deck.The passengers of the Cambria were a multinational, multiracial, multireligiouslot, a veritable sampling of the world and of America strewn together and siftedin the confined spaces of a ship at sea. Like the crew of Melville’s Pequod inMoby-Dick, what Andrew Delbanco called “a dazzling array of human types . . .taking turns in a stage play,” Douglass wrote in similar terms about hisshipmates in a public letter back to Garrison. Ever the storyteller, Douglassdescribed the Cambria as a “theater” with “all sorts of people, from differentcountries, of the most opposite modes of thinking on all subjects.” Flungtogether, some of the Cambria’s diverse human cargo mixed well and some did not.She mingled the “scheming Connecticut wooden clock-maker, the large, surly, NewYork lion-tamer, the solemn Roman Catholic bishop, and the Orthodox Quaker.”Also shipping to Liverpool were a “minister of the Free Church of Scotland, anda minister of the Church of England—the established Christian and the wanderingJew, the Whig and the Democrat, the white and the black.” This cast could havebecome a comedy or a tragedy in the right hands. The “dark-visaged Spaniard andthe light-visaged Englishman—the man from Montreal and the man from Mexico” hadalso boarded at New York or Boston. But if politics and religion might at leastbe somehow bridged for eleven days, a larger problem emerged because of the“slaveholders from Cuba, and slaveholders from Georgia.” Douglass warmed to theirony. “We had antislavery singing,” he wrote, “and proslavery grumbling, and atthe same time that Governor Hammond’s Letters [James Henry Hammond, governor ofSouth Carolina] were being read, my Narrative was being circulated.”7[notes.html#ch9fn_7a] Here was America’s greatest problem—slavery—festering onboard a steamship about to land in Britain’s former largest slave-trading port.In this volatile mix Douglass accepted the invitation of the captain himself todeliver a speech. Before he had uttered a few sentences, what he called the“salt water mobocrats,” led by a Mr. Hazzard of Connecticut, shouted him downwith fists clenched in the air. “That’s a lie!” bellowed his opponents asDouglass attempted a discourse on the conditions of slaves in America. Douglasskept trying to be heard over the hecklers, finally resorting to “reading a fewextracts from slave laws.” But the gathering deteriorated into near violence, asa Cuban shouted, “I wish I had you in Cuba!,” and the Georgian, “I wish I hadhim in Savannah! We would use him up!” With these men rushing toward Douglassand threatening to throw him overboard, an Irishman as well as Captain Judkinscame to Douglass’s defense. The captain ended the melee by threatening to putthe mob leaders “in irons.” The proslavery thugs, with brandy cups in hand,scattered to other corners of the ship, and as Douglass remembered, “conductedthemselves very decorously” for the remainder of the voyage.8[notes.html#ch9fn_8a]But they had performed their service to the cause, and after landing inLiverpool, did so even more. The Georgian and the Cuban, and perhaps otherallies from aboard the Cambria, went to the British press to defend themselvesand, in so doing, Douglass maintained, provided the black abolitionist “a sortof national announcement of my arrival in England.”9 [notes.html#ch9fn_9a] Muchsympathy came Douglass’s way as news of his discriminatory treatment spreadthrough reformist England and Ireland.Douglass had attempted his speech on the main deck, with the Irish highlandswithin view. The next day, August 28, the Cambria steamed into the river Merseyand to the great quays of Liverpool. Douglass and Buffum spent a mere two daysor so with their feet on the ground in the city, then were off on the ferry toDublin across the Irish Sea. They took up residence at the home of IrishmanJames A. Webb, brother of the printer Richard D. Webb, both staunch supportersof abolition and temperance. At first the Webbs, especially Richard and hiswife, Hannah, were generously hospitable hosts, although that relationship wouldsour over time. Bald and bespectacled, with a full white beard in Quaker style,Richard Webb was an astute businessman and a loyal Garrisonian with strong tiesto Maria Weston Chapman; together with her at the helm in Boston, Webb took on arole as Douglass’s manager. By mid-September Douglass reported that he haddelivered numerous lectures to overflow crowds, at the Royal Exchange (now CityHall), at a Friends’ meetinghouse, the Music Hall, and even one to the inmatesat a local prison. Undergoing a personal awakening, he seemed especiallyastonished that he encountered no “manifestations of prejudice.” He traveled onall conveyances and “was not treated as a color, but as a man.”10[notes.html#ch9fn_10a]Douglass quickly found comfort on Irish soil, except with Webb himself. His hostsimply did not like Douglass’s personality, calling him “absurdly haughty,self-possessed, and prone to take offense.” Webb thought Douglass mistreated hiswhite traveling companion, Buffum, and found Douglass too “willing . . . tomagnify the smallest causes of discomfort or wounded self esteem into . . .insurmountable hills of offense.” Webb accused Douglass of selfishness and“unreasonableness . . . when he thinks himself hurt.” Their relationshipstumbled on with much private grumbling by both men. Webb was thirteen yearsolder than the star orator, who was indeed insecure and hypersensitive in hisfirst foreign sojourn; Douglass did not take well to constant mentorship andoversight. They did share, however, the publication of the Irish edition of theautobiography, although its author found it unsatisfying. By late September,Webb’s print shop on Great Brunswick Street had published the first Irishedition of Douglass’s Narrative with a print run of two thousand copies. Thus,the young American abolitionist could stay stocked for a while on what nowbecame a busy speaking schedule around the Emerald Isle. Douglass received asmany invitations to speak at temperance meetings as at (his preference) thoseabout international abolitionism. Before he left Dublin, after seeing both itsgreat halls as well as its desperate poverty, Douglass had the specialexperience of witnessing a speech by Daniel O’Connell and then meeting the“Great Liberator.”11 [notes.html#ch9fn_11a]Legendary champion of all reforms, including the controversial repeal of theunion of Ireland and England, O’Connell deeply moved Douglass, who was ever thestudent of oratory and still learning his craft. He had never heard a speech,Douglass wrote home, at which he “was more completely captivated.” The addresswas “skillfully delivered, powerful in its logic, majestic in its rhetoric,biting in its sarcasm, melting in its pathos, and burning in its rebukes”—allthe same oratorical elements Douglass had tried to master. By early October,Douglass and Buffum were off to speaking engagements in Wexford and Waterford,then traveled the difficult roads by stagecoach down the east coast to Cork.12[notes.html#ch9fn_12a]In Cork, on the southern coast of Ireland, Douglass may have felt safer. Herefor a month in the fall of 1845, Douglass experienced a kind of sanctuary,living with the Jennings family in their sprawling house on Brown Street, onlysteps down from Coal Quay on the River Lee. Thomas and Ann Jennings, with theireight curious and educated children, were religious dissenters in a city ofRoman Catholics in a country ruled by the bishops of the Church of England.Jennings was a successful merchant who sold mineral oil, vinegar, and other farmgoods from Cork’s ocean port. Full of quirks and fascinations for universalreforms, and lovers of music and literature, the Jennings family extended toDouglass a kind of humane racial equality he had never quite known. None of themsought to control Douglass in any way. He seemed to relish talking with theJennings children, especially the young daughters, Isabel, Charlotte, Helen, andJane, who were enthralled with their American guest. Her large family was noteasily impressed, reported Jane Jennings, but no speaker had ever “excited suchgeneral interest as Frederick,” and he had “won the affection of everyone ofus.”13 [notes.html#ch9fn_13a]Isabel Jennings in particular, who was secretary of the Cork Ladies Anti-SlaverySociety, and who worked assiduously to collect funds and material goods forantislavery fairs in America, became Douglass’s admirer and advocate. “He feelslike a friend whom we had long known,” she wrote to Chapman in the fall of 1845,“and I think before he goes we will quite understand one another. He is so freein acknowledging when he has been too hasty in judging.” Isabel gushed over thestunning man making news in her town and her house. “There is an expression ofgreat suffering at times on his countenance which only renders him moreinteresting.” Chapman might have been even further intrigued by Douglass’simpact on young Isabel when the Irish girl wrote, “There never was a person whomade a greater sensation in Cork amongst all the religious bodies . . . inprivate he is greatly to be liked—he has gained friends everywhere he hasbeen—he is indeed a wonderful man.”14 [notes.html#ch9fn_14a]Such a private, welcoming kind of comfort nourished the weary traveler so farfrom home; and Douglass relished all the adoration from young women, a patternhe would repeat many times in his life, finding emotional support from women ofall ages. But the orator-writer was on a public mission and very much ondisplay. Douglass was now the perpetual guest of honor with bookings to speaknearly everywhere people might gather. In nearly every waking hour, if withpeople, he provided the object for their curiosity and gaze: he had to be theblack man who was really a pleasing brown and partly white, the slave who wasalso so eloquent, the genius that bondage could not destroy, the embodiment of astory that kept on giving. A press report of his first speech in Cork, given atLloyd’s Hotel, demonstrated the exoticized scrutiny Douglass faced with hisIrish and British audiences. Enthralled with his mixed parentage, the reporterdeclared the orator’s “appearance . . . singularly pleasing and agreeable. Thehue of his face and hands is rather yellow brown or bronze, while there islittle, if anything, in his features of that peculiar prominence of lower face,thickness of lips, and flatness of nose, which peculiarly characterize the trueNegro type. His voice is well toned and musical.” Exasperated by these racialcharacterizations, which he encountered almost everywhere, Douglass sometimessnapped back, declaring in a Cork newspaper that they “looked like a goodadvertisement from a slave trader.”15 [notes.html#ch9fn_15a] Such racializeddescriptions are hardly surprising in the middle of the nineteenth century; butsuch ideas and expectations were part of Douglass’s daily encounters, even amongfriends and admirers.Douglass was not sui generis for the Irish of Cork or other provincial towns;Charles Lenox Remond had visited before him. But a black American former slavewith such mastery of language and physical attractiveness had never landed intheir midst before. Men listened to Douglass with intensity, as did women, someof whom swooned. In his numerous lectures in Cork, Douglass was an instantcelebrity. The “ladies” especially turned out in droves to see and hear him, theCork press observed. They did so as well in Belfast a couple of months later,where one Irishwoman abolitionist observed after seeing Douglass, “I amconvinced that there is scarcely a lady in Belfast who would not be anxious tojoin in any means calculated to promote the enfranchisement of the deeplyinjured Africans.”16 [notes.html#ch9fn_16a] But all this attention, getting hisNarrative published, and his own deep personal sensitivities to racial slights,and to all those in the Garrisonian orbit who tried to control him, embroiledthe star itinerant in turbulent personality conflicts.First there was Buffum, the ever-present companion and watchdog. Eleven yearsolder than Douglass, Buffum possessed superb radical credentials and was adevout Garrisonian. He had worked to desegregate New England railroads andserved as an officer in both antislavery societies and in a Fourierist utopianorganization. But he was the American Anti-Slavery Society’s (the “oldorganization’s”) appointed guardian of the volatile young Douglass. He reporteddirectly to the power behind Garrison’s throne, Maria Weston Chapman, whomanaged the office of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in Boston andespecially the personal habits and ideological commitments of Garrisonianlecturers. At meetings Buffum would usually speak first and only briefly andanecdotally as a setup man for a Douglass performance. He played Sancho Panza toDouglass’s Don Quixote in some ways. Though certainly not of any peasantbackground or wisdom, Buffum did come across as the self-sacrificing Christian,necessarily a bit awestruck with his young charge, perhaps at times exhibitingracial paternalism. Booking agent, monitor of Douglass’s arguments and behavior,Buffum became the friend from whom the orator needed to escape. Not unlike theHundred Conventions tour of two years earlier, these two abolitionists wereconstantly in each other’s company, and the nerves rubbed thin, especially asDouglass became aware of how much Chapman, and therefore Garrison, was trying toshape his image, his rhetoric, even his every movement. Douglass began to champat the bit as his sponsors tried to rein him in.This arrangement could only lead to conflict. The farther they traveled throughIreland and on to Scotland, Buffum repeatedly informed Chapman or one of hersisters about the “great applause” Douglass received at every event and the“great good” he did for the cause. But problems erupted in early 1846 whenDouglass learned that Chapman had charged Buffum and Richard Webb with keepingtheir eyes on Frederick’s ambitions, his ideological straying, and especiallyhis desire for money gained from sales of his book. In an understatement, Buffumwarned Chapman that Douglass was “quite sensitive” about such accusations. Webbwent even further, writing to Chapman about his personal disdain for Douglass.Douglass, said Webb, had engaged in “offensive and ungrateful behavior” towardBuffum. The Dubliner thought the former slave the “least loveable and least easyof all the abolitionists with whom” he had associated. Webb unloaded bile on theyoung American, considering him all but incapable of kindness, and “extremelyjealous and suspicious.”17 [notes.html#ch9fn_17a] A psychological dance betweenan ever-rising star and his rivals in Ireland—the one a smothering travelmateand the other the publisher who could not provide books to his writer fastenough—became open emotional warfare, with the prompter of the nastiness,Chapman, improbably sitting in a Boston office. Douglass did not hide hiswounded soul, born of his slave past and stoked in his celebrity present.During his more than four months in Ireland, Douglass tried to sustain a cordialcorrespondence with Webb. Douglass frequently made aggressive demands for morebooks. He also used his new patron as a sounding board for the frustrations ofconstant travel and the demands of the overly curious public. “Everyone . . .seems to think he has a special claim on my time to listen to his opinion ofme,” Douglass complained to Webb, illustrating the self-importance that soannoyed the Irishman. Douglass detested the frontispiece image Webb used for thesecond Irish edition of the Narrative, which came out in early 1846, and toldhim so in no uncertain terms. To Webb, if we put it in modern terms, the youngblack man was uppity and never satisfied by his own recognition. Douglass alsoinveighed against expectations that he should speak on disunionism,nonresistance, or other Garrisonian doctrines, preferring to sustain his missionas “purely an Antislavery one.” Douglass wanted to prescribe his own agenda, andas Webb complained to Chapman behind Douglass’s back, he would not listen to hishandlers.18 [notes.html#ch9fn_18a]Douglass had, after all, escaped from slavery; he owed so much to his allies inthe extended house of Garrison, including to Buffum, who had personally paid forthe young man’s passage on the Cambria. Douglass’s wife and children weredependent on white abolitionists’ charity and goodwill. He was trapped in a dealthat both offered him the world and stifled the kind of freedom he perhapscherished most—the freedom of mind and of the words he would choose to expresshimself. Without doubt, Douglass was hypersensitive to personal slights,especially if he sensed they were racial, and he moved through the social andintellectual circles of his foreign admirers with a natural distrust that putthe burden of social intercourse on others. During the previous frenetic four tofive years when the antislavery orator was in constant motion, Douglass hadtried to forge a new sense of self—as a public man of intellect, of courageousactivism, and now as a writer. He was ferociously competitive; he desperatelyneeded friends, but would forever find forging close bonds, especially with men,difficult. The young adult Douglass always knew—and constantly rehearsed infront of audiences—that he was still that fugitive slave from an Eastern Shorecornfield, the pain of his whippings festering in his memory. In a sense he wasforever hurt, and he did not take well to new hurts, even if only perceived orimagined. From under those crisp white shirts worn under the frock coat, thehair on his head growing high and parted neatly, Frederick fashioned an elegancethat usually kept his rage against slavery submerged in social settings. But itwould burst out in his platform rhetoric, and sometimes privately at his closestcompanions.When he stepped onto and off platforms before hundreds of auditors, thenpersonally sold them copies of his book as he shook their hands, how could thistwenty-eight-year-old phenomenon, who had discovered just how much power hewielded over his audiences with his story, not have a high estimation ofhimself? He desperately wanted Irish and British abolitionists to like him; butif the Webbs, Buffums, or Chapmans could not loosen their clutches and dissolvetheir own prejudices, then he could keep running from their shadows, andsometimes telling them just what he thought. Plenty of welcoming eyes andtemporary friends were in the audience at the next speech.In March 1846, in a letter labeled “private,” Douglass wrote to Chapman, openlychallenging her efforts to manage him. He tried to remain respectful when hefound out the extent of her efforts to stifle his liberties, but he could notstanch his anger. Webb had read portions of Chapman’s letter to him, especiallythe accusations that Douglass would seek to enrich himself and that he mightdefect to the anti-Garrisonian British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society, knownin shorthand as the London Committee. Douglass barely controlled his rage,informing Chapman that he had sailed to England with $350 earned from the firstAmerican sales of his book, and that he now sustained himself largely from saleof the Irish edition. Douglass felt bitterly betrayed by Chapman’s request toWebb to “watch over” him. No “love of money” nor “hate of poverty” could drivehim from the “sacred cause,” he declared. He found the insinuations“embarrassing” and “disappointing.” He had resisted the Liberty Party inAmerica, so “why should I not withstand the London Committee?”19[notes.html#ch9fn_19a]Image [../images/f0148-01.jpg]Maria Weston Chapman, c. 1846. Daguerreotype.Then he became very personal. “If I am to be watched over for evel [sic] ratherthan for good, by my professed friends I can say with propriety save me from myfriends and I will take care of my enemies!” He returned his own acid forChapman’s whispered betrayals. “If you wish to drive me from the AntislaverySociety, put me under overseer ship and the work is done. Set someone to watchover me—for evil and let them be so simple minded as to inform me of theiroffice, and the last blow is struck.” Douglass kept declaring himself an oldorganizationist, but this exchange might be the beginning of the end of hisideological and personal loyalty to Garrisonianism. Perhaps the fugitive fromthe Eastern Shore cornfield could be “bought,” but never, he insisted, for thewrong reasons. He would continue to sell his book, and he made no apologies.20[notes.html#ch9fn_20a]The Irish tour surged on. After six major events in Cork, with bands playing aspart of the show, Douglass and Buffum trekked by stagecoach and carriage overdifficult roads due north to Limerick in November 1845. At Limerick, Douglassopenly criticized a local actor who performed a Jim Crow character in a minstrelshow. He delivered many versions of his “Slaveholder’s Sermon” as well asstories from the Narrative as he hawked copies at the end of each speech.Douglass also began to address openly political topics such as the annexation ofTexas, and what he called “America’s bastard republicanism.” Then it was on toBelfast in the north, where Douglass spent more than a month at the VictoriaHotel, paid for by local abolitionists.21 [notes.html#ch9fn_21a]In Belfast in late 1845 and early 1846, Douglass gave some extraordinaryspeeches, especially on the old theme of religious hypocrisy and the proslaverycomplicity of the churches. He also told riveting tales of his youth, of hisbrutal religion-professing masters, and of his struggle for literacy. Heanalyzed the nature of race and of proslavery claims of Negro inferiority.Moreover, the American orator aggressively thwarted claims for what might becalled the Irish analogy—that the oppression and poverty of the Irish wasequivalent to American slavery. Since beginning his tour he had felt “accosted,”Douglass claimed, with the idea that many of the Irish lived as “slaves.” Heacknowledged the tyranny of British rule, but asked for careful distinctionsabout “what slavery really is.” Mincing no words, Douglass argued that “slaverywas not what took away any one right or property in man: it took man himself,”and “from himself, dooms him a degraded thing, ranks him with the bridled horseand muzzled ox, makes him a chattel personal, a marketable commodity.” With somein the crowd shouting, “Hear, hear,” Douglass asked, “Had they anything likethis in Ireland?” “Ah no!” he shouted, not waiting for his audience’s reply.With time Douglass became ever more aggressive in denouncing such an equivalencebetween conditions in Ireland and America. By 1850 back in the United States, hewas quite direct: “There is no analogy between the two cases. The Irishman ispoor, but he is not a slave. He may be in rags, but he is not a slave.”22[notes.html#ch9fn_22a] Not all Irishmen agreed with him.Everywhere he went, Douglass knew he had to continue “working wonders” andserving, as one Irish observer put it, as the “living example of thecapabilities of the slave.” But to the “whispers” that he was an “imposter,”which surfaced, Douglass said in Belfast, he responded with both anger andhumor. Dubliners, he said, had not needed so much as “a letter of introduction,”nor had anyone else at his dozens of speeches around Ireland. But with bitingsarcasm, he declared of his new hosts, “What sensible people you are in Belfast!How cautious lest they should make a mistake!”23 [notes.html#ch9fn_23a]On December 23, 1845, Douglass delivered a bravura effort about slavery andreligious corruption to a mixed Belfast audience of Catholics and Protestants.In an oration that included at least ten direct uses or paraphrases ofscriptural passages and parables, Douglass turned Christian principles intoweapons against proslavery religion—in his own country and in the British Isles.This forceful performance offended some of his auditors, while others all butfell over laughing and cheering. Caustic and sneering, Douglass demolished thevery idea of a Christian slaveholder. They could “not serve God and Mammon,” andthey blasphemed in claiming any “fellowship with the meek and lowly Jesus.” Helifted Matthew 23:15 to condemn Christian “man-stealers” and “cradle-plunderers”as “Christ denounced the Scribes and Pharisees, when he said that they wouldcompass sea and land to make one proselyte, and after they had made him, he wasten times the Child of Hell.” And he challenged the antislavery consciences ofhis audience. Would they be the “priest” who would not even see the sufferingman by the side of the road, the “Levite” who looked and felt sympathy but chosea “middle course” and moved on, or would they be the “Samaritan” of compassionwho bound the wounds of the victim? Or would they make Daniel’s choice to breakthe law, never worship an earthly king’s false gods, and risk death in thelions’ den? With his memory still swirling with revenge against Thomas Auld,Douglass assured his well-churched Irish crowds that “a man becomes the morecruel the more the religious element is perverted in him. It was so with mymaster.”24 [notes.html#ch9fn_24a] Douglass had learned to seamlessly weavebiblical stories into his oratory with compelling effect.• • •During Douglass’s months in Ireland the potato crop began to fail, and thegreatest catastrophe in Irish history took hold in the countryside. A new fungaldisease was first detected in Dublin in late August 1845, just as Douglassarrived on Irish shores. Its worst effects did not set in until a second wave ofthe potato blight in 1846. Within the next four years approximately 1 millionIrish would die, first of epidemic infections, then of horribledietary-deficiency diseases, and finally of outright starvation. Another 2million would emigrate to the United States and Canada over the ensuing decade.The social, demographic, and political legacies of the Great Irish Famine stillreverberate to this day. In the 1840s, two-thirds of the Irish population of 8.2million made its living from subsistence agriculture, and most of them werefully dependent on the nutritious potato. When the crop began to show the brownsplotches, then putrefy on the ground, huge numbers of people had nowhere toturn; they were soon caught up in the strained political entanglements at theheart of Ireland’s links to Great Britain. As a leading historian of the GreatFamine, Christine Kinealy, has said, with Ireland’s “quasi-colonial status”within the British empire, “the United Kingdom was far from united.”25[notes.html#ch9fn_25a] No legacy of the famine is more embittered than the roleof British policies, and imperial attitudes toward the Irish people in theirtime of greatest travail.Douglass observed the horrors of Irish poverty, as well as the beginnings of thefamine, although he could not have fully comprehended its causes andconsequences at the time. As he barnstormed through Ireland, lecturing his hoststo reject the analogy of Irish suffering with American slavery, and demandingthey open their Christian hearts as they fought with their own racialhypocrisies, a vast tragedy of mass death from hunger had begun its sweepthrough the Irish peasantry. The modern Irish writer Colm Tóibín remarked thatcontemporary literate observers of the ravages of the famine tended to writewith a “mixture of flat description” while “desperately trying to describe theindescribable.” He quotes one withering firsthand account from 1846 of the deadat an Irish hut: “Near the hole that serves as a doorway is the last restingplace of two or three children; in fact, this hut is surrounded by a rampart ofhuman bones, which have accumulated to such a height in the threshold . . . theground is now two feet beneath it.” These people had not been shot in a civilwar, but had simply dropped dead from starvation. “In this horrible den,” theaccount continues, “in the midst of a mass of human putrefaction, sixindividuals, males and females, laboring under most malignant fever, werehuddled together, as closely as were the dead in the graves around.” Douglassdid not see this kind of death scene. But he saw the “extreme poverty andwretchedness” of the Irish “huts.”26 [notes.html#ch9fn_26a] He was awed by them,and his prose was both inspired and stymied by them.In a public letter to Garrison in February 1846, after he had moved on toScotland, Douglass took time to reflect on what he had seen of Ireland. As theAmerican abroad, he felt compelled to expose “other evils” than slavery. “I amnot only an American slave,” he wrote, “but a man, and as such, am bound to usemy powers for the welfare of the whole human brotherhood. I am not going throughthis land with my eyes shut, ears stopped, or heart steeled.” For the moment heput aside his disdain for the analogy between Irish misery and American slavery.Too many self-styled “philanthropists,” maintained Douglass, “care no more aboutIrishmen . . . than they care about the whipped, gagged, and thumb-screwedslave. They would as willingly sell on the auction block an Irishman, if it werepopular to do so, as an African.” Now it was he making the equivalences betweentwo kinds of suffering and evil. Although Douglass only glimpsed the famine’sbeginnings, he did seem to comprehend what Christine Kinealy observes: “One ofthe most lethal subsistence crises in modern history occurred within thejurisdiction of, and in close proximity to, the epicenter of what was therichest empire in the world.”27 [notes.html#ch9fn_27a]In his six weeks of wandering around the Dublin region, Douglass witnessed somany “painful exhibitions of human misery” that the fugitive slave from thesandy soil of the Eastern Shore could only “blush.” The streets everywhere were“literally alive with beggars,” many only “stumps of men . . . without feet,without legs, without hands, without arms.” Douglass recounted being surroundedby “more than a dozen . . . at one time . . . all telling a tale of woe.” The“little children in the street at a late hour of night . . . leaning againstbrick walls, fast asleep,” parents nowhere to be seen, especially shocked him.He bothered with no abstractions nor made any distinctions here between theslave boy scrambling for food at a trough and the homeless, starving child offamine. Douglass viscerally understood abandonment from his own childhood. Onecan read such an impulse in his descriptions of the Irish children “with none tolook upon them, none to care for them. If they have parents, they have becomevicious, and have abandoned them. Poor creatures! They are left without help, tofind their way through a frowning world.”28 [notes.html#ch9fn_28a] The FredBailey who had waited at Miss Lucretia’s window for morsels of food as he sangfor attention stood awestruck at the starving Irish.Douglass saw many of the Irish peasant huts. “Of all places to witness humanmisery, ignorance, degradation, filth and wretchedness,” wrote Douglass, “anIrish hut is pre-eminent.” After a long description of their dark bleakness andsuffocating space, he could not resist his Garrisonian abolitionist’s sense ofirony at the presence of a “picture representing the crucifixion of Christpasted on the most conspicuous place on the wall.” Demonstrating that he did notyet grasp the nature and scale of the famine as it unfolded, as yet unaware ofthe draconian “poor laws” that would evict huge numbers of Irish farmers fromland and force them into workhouses, Douglass the reformer argued that theimmediate cause of such widespread poverty in Ireland was intemperance. In thefaces of the most wretched of all, he claimed he could see the evidence that“drunkenness was still rife in Ireland.” As Tóibín suggested about other writerscontemporary with the famine, Douglass’s own prose may have suffered aflattening, his thinking itself may have fallen lame, in the face of the“indescribable.”29 [notes.html#ch9fn_29a] A brilliantly descriptive piece oftravel journalism about extreme human suffering stumbled in the end over whatseemed an obligatory nod to temperance propaganda.Douglass had been deeply affected, even changed, by Ireland and her people. Hehad learned from and fought ideological and personal battles with them. He hadfound yet a new range of his powerful voice, and he relished the new throngs ofadmirers. In Bondage and Freedom, written nine years after he left Belfast,while remembering nostalgically the “almost constant singing” among slaves inthe South as they worked, the “deep melancholy” of the “wild notes,” his memoryquickly leaped back to Ireland. “I have never heard any songs like thoseanywhere since I left slavery, except when in Ireland. There I heard the samewailing notes, and was much affected by them. It was during the famine of1845–6.” It seemed that only Irish starvation allowed him, through memory, toshare the agony of Anthony’s lash, Auld’s kitchen, the Easton jail, and Covey’sfarmstead. Just which Irish songs he heard he does not tell us. But from histravels, like so many before and after him, Douglass brought away both a realand a mythic sense of the Irish people and their beautiful and terrible land.Maybe he even heard some versions of the longing and loss in “The Green Fieldsof Americay.”30 [notes.html#ch9fn_30a]As he prepared to leave Ireland, Douglass crafted one of his public letters toGarrison on January 1, 1846. The letter exhibits homesickness on New Year’s Day,as he sat alone in a hotel in Belfast. But he also used his more than fourmonths in Ireland as a springboard for one of the most embittered critiques heever wrote about his own homeland. “I have spent some of the happiest moments ofmy life since landing in this country,” Douglass assured his readers. “I seem tohave undergone a transformation. I live a new life.” He had been stunned by thelack of racial prejudice, the cordiality of his Irish friends. They had“flocked” to hear his words by the “thousands.” In literary terms he made theutmost of national contrasts: “Instead of the bright blue sky of America, I amcovered with the soft grey fog of the Emerald Isle.” And yet, “I breathe, andlo! The chattel becomes a man.” Douglass drifted into a remarkable statementabout patriotism full of pain and longing. Did any American exile in the longhistory of this story of the scorned expatriate ever express such feelings of aman without a country any better? “I have . . . no creed to uphold, nogovernment to defend; and as a nation, I belong to none . . . The land of mybirth welcomes me to her shores only as a slave.”31 [notes.html#ch9fn_31a] Itwas as if the deep sadness of Irish songs had entered his bones.Then Douglass turned, as he so often did in his writing, to metaphors of natureto find the beauty and the agony in his story. “In thinking of America, Isometimes find myself admiring her bright blue sky,” he rhapsodized, “her grandold woods—her fertile fields—her beautiful rivers . . . her star-crownedmountains.” We can read him anticipating Walt Whitman, Langston Hughes, or WoodyGuthrie. “But my rapture is soon checked, my joy is soon turned to mourning.When I remember that all is cursed with the infernal spirit ofslaveholding . . . when I remember that with the waters of her noblest rivers,the tears of my brethren are borne to the ocean . . . and that her most fertilefields drink daily of the warm blood of my outraged sisters, I am filled withunutterable loathing.” Douglass displays here what he would express repeatedlyin his public life. He desperately wanted to belong in his own country, to makeits stated creeds his own, but as he concluded, “America will not allow herchildren to love her.” Hatred and love of country, impossible condition mixedwith plausible hope, brutally racist law met with resistance born of secular andreligious faith—these were forever the literary and intellectual wellsprings ofthis great ironist’s work. He converted the remainder of his extraordinary lastletter from Ireland into a litany of the ways he had faced Jim Crow’s ugliestrebukes back home, ending each of seven examples with the refrain, “We don’tallow n___ers in here!”32 [notes.html#ch9fn_32a] He had not heard thatAmericanism in Ireland, and no mob had taken brickbats and clubs to drive himfrom a lectern.Shortly after arriving in Scotland, Douglass wrote his preface for the secondIrish edition of his Narrative, the one he would now hope to sell to finance histour of Britain. He gave four reasons for his tour of the British Isles, allreasonable and revealing. First, he wanted to “be out of the way” as his fullidentity as a fugitive slave emerged more widely in the United States. Second,he sought a new “stock of information” and “opportunities for self-improvement”in the “land of my paternal ancestors,” a comment that kept many whiteEnglishmen and Americans talking about his mixed blood for a long time. Third,he wished to spread the abolitionist crusade as far and wide as possible, toshame America before the wider world out of “her adhesion to a system soabhorrent to Christianity and to her republican institutions.” And fourth, hewanted auditors for his lectures and especially readers for his book. Hiscampaign sought to prove that he was a writer in a land that honored andcelebrated people of the word. In an appendix he chose to include several“critical notices” about the Narrative. Two of them came from Belfast ministerswho raved about the book’s merits. Thomas Drew, a Church of Christ divine, woveDouglass’s achievement into praise of God, but not without admitting that whenreading the Narrative “the details of the writer absorbs all attention,” andthat the author was “a mind bursting all bounds.” Even more, the Presbyterianminister Isaac Nelson called Douglass a “literary wonder . . . such anintellectual phenomenon as only appears at times in the republic of letters.”33[notes.html#ch9fn_33a] Douglass had indeed accomplished that most wondrous ofthings for a slave: he had written a book the world would read!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 10--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SEND BACK THE MONEY!Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangersdevour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.—ISAIAH 1:7Frederick Douglass was fascinated with the theologically disputatiousPresbyterians, and especially with the romantic and warlike history of theScots. Historically, nothing had been more conflicted in Scotland than churchhistory, and the black American abolitionist had arrived in the midst of theregion’s most embittered religious and institutional dispute of the nineteenthcentury. No people or country likes to be told by an outsider that their “wholehead is sick, and the whole heart faint,” or that their “hands are full ofblood.” Some of the Scots, though, in the 1840s, mired in one of their periodicinternecine clerical struggles, seemed to welcome a stranger’s jeremiads.1[notes.html#ch10fn_1a] And that stranger now would garner a great deal ofpractice for arguments he would employ in his own country.Political life in Scotland took place in or because of its churches. In 1843,led by the middle-class evangelical reformer Thomas Chalmers, a large group ofministers and their supporters bolted from the General Assembly of the nationalChurch of Scotland and formed the Free Church of Scotland. More than one-thirdof the twelve hundred or so ministers in Scotland and perhaps as many asone-half of laypeople joined the new movement. To pay ministers and buildchurches the new organization desperately needed money. As part of itsfund-raising campaign a delegation sailed to America in 1844 and collectedseveral thousand dollars, largely in the South from slaveholding Presbyterians.As Douglass and a small band of American abolitionists began to draw largecrowds in early 1846 in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and many smaller towns acrossScotland, the region was aflame with controversy over slavery, and especiallyover the allegedly tainted lucre gathered from American slaveowners.2[notes.html#ch10fn_2a]In his first speeches in Scotland, Douglass had stuck to the nature of slaveryand racial prejudice in the United States. Scottish audiences applauded andlaughed vigorously as Douglass entertained them with tales of his youth and withever more details of the incident aboard the Cambria. The Scots cheered wildlyat some of his satire and mimicry of masters and preachers. He portrayed himselfas the voice of the slave with dangerous enemies arrayed against him. Most ofhis crowds were glad to urge a self-appointed David to fight on against Goliath.And Douglass felt freer than ever in Scotland. “The spirit of British law,” hemaintained at the Glasgow City Hall on January 15, 1846, “makes libertycommensurate with the British soil, and which proclaims to the stranger and tothe sojourner that the ground on which he treads is holy, and is consecrated tothe genius of universal freedom.” Thus appealing to Scottish pride andpatriotism, he relished being the outsider who could draw his hosts into hisstruggle. He “wished to encircle America about with a cordon of Anti-slaveryfeeling—bounding it by Canada on the north, Mexico on the west, and England,Scotland and Ireland on the east,” all joined in the cause of telling aslaveholder, wherever he goes, that he is “a man-stealing, cradle-robbing, andwoman-whipping monster.”3 [notes.html#ch10fn_3a] (An applause line if ever therewas one.) Still the moral suasionist by method, Douglass dove into the localpolitical fray.At Dundee, on January 30, the Free Church debate became a cudgel in Douglass’shand as he leaned on an Old Testament prophet for support. He began by readingverses 4 to 20 from chapter 1 of Isaiah. Douglass’s baritone rang out incadences he first learned sitting with Father Lawson in Baltimore: “Ah sinfulnation . . . Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto thelaw of our God, ye people of Gomorrah . . . your hands are full of blood.”Douglass loved the language of the King James Bible, especially the Psalms andthe Old Testament prophets. Their warnings about God’s retribution for sin andevil, their poetry and storytelling, seemed to ring in his head like the lyricsof favorite old songs and hymns. Early in his career he mastered the oratoricalart of the jeremiad, the rhetorical device made famous in America by thePuritans, but appropriated effectively by African Americans and many others. Thejeremiad was the sermon that called the flock back from their declension, fromtheir waning zeal to a renewed faith and activism. Douglass mastered thejeremiadic tradition, and Isaiah, Jeremiah, and other prophets provided aninfinite storehouse of wisdom and argument. As Douglass began to seize theirwords and their stories, he found in the prophets his inspiration, a sense ofwrath, mystery, pathos, history, and justice.4 [notes.html#ch10fn_4a]Douglass and his traveling companions—including Buffum, the American utopian andultraradical Henry C. Wright, and the British abolitionist George Thompson—hadcaught the wave of this Scottish controversy at just the right time. Douglasshad “never seen a people more deeply moved than were the people of Scotland,” hewrote, on the question of Southern money and the Free Church. “Public meetingsucceeded public meeting,” he later remembered. “Speech after speech, pamphletafter pamphlet, editorial after editorial, sermon after sermon, soon lashed theconscientious Scotch people into a perfect furore. ‘SEND BACK THE MONEY!’ ” rangout the call, “from Greenock to Edinburgh, and from Edinburgh to Aberdeen.”5[notes.html#ch10fn_5a] Still trying to sell his Narrative at every venue,Douglass became the featured attraction. As his popularity soared, his Scottishspeeches were one part moral indictment of both American and Scottish hypocrisy,one part jeremiadic sermon, one part his continued self-revelations, and onepart comic entertainment.At one of his Dundee addresses in March, Douglass left a crowd of twelve hundredpeople leaning over with laughter as well as understanding. Leveling chargesagainst the Free Church, especially their “sophistry” of calling themselves“free” instead of labeling their real purpose—representing the “slavechurch”—Douglass told a “pig’s foot” joke. He claimed that slaves in his area ofMaryland referred to the idea of freedom as “pig’s foot” so that whites wouldnot know what they were talking about. Then he invented a dialogue betweenhimself and Thomas Chalmers, leader of the Free Church, as well as with theReverend George Lewis, a native of Dundee and the head of the delegation thathad raised the money across the American South. Douglass takes his listenersback to the Eastern Shore and imagines “brother Lewis” arriving on hisfund-raising tour at Thomas Auld’s house. Young Frederick answers the door andwitnesses the exchange. Mimicking voices, both Scottish and Southern American,Douglass has brother Lewis make his pitch: “My object in making this call thismorning is to see if you would do something for the cause of religious freedomin Scotland.” Auld (“my master”) replies, “Brother Lewis, I deeply sympathizewith your efforts; and as I see the cause recommended by Deacon such-a-one, Iwould like to have my name down with his. I’ll tell you what I will do. I have afine young negro who is to be sold, and I will sell him tomorrow and give youthe contribution to the cause of freedom.”6 [notes.html#ch10fn_6a]Auld invited Lewis to come back in the morning, take breakfast, and ride withhim to the county seat in Easton, Maryland. Here, whether his audience realizedit or not, Douglass remembered real events. In the morning, Auld and Lewis readfrom the Bible together: “Blessed are the poor in spirit—Blessed are they thatgive to the poor.” Lewis partakes of food “produced by the blood of the slave.”Then they all get into a carriage, with young Frederick “tied behind.” Lookingout on his rapt audience, Douglass continues, “I am on the auction block and theauctioneer is crying, ‘Who bids for this comely stout young negro. . . . Well,five hundred dollars are bid.’ Oh, how brother Lewis’s eyes twinkle! Theauctioneer continues—‘This is not half the value of the negro. . . . His masterhas no desire to get rid of him, but only wants to get a little money to aid thecause of religious freedom in Scotland.’ Once, twice, thrice . . . and I am soldfor six hundred dollars.” Amid “great cheering,” Douglass ended his performancewith a crescendo. “When the Free Church says—did not Abraham hold slaves? Thereply should be, Send back the money! When they ask did not Paul send backOnesimus? I answer, Send back the money!” Douglass concluded that the FreeChurch was less church and more a “manufacturing corporation.” “Disgorge theplunder!” he proclaimed. “Disgorge the plunder!” Arms waving in air, he shouted,“Send back the money! There is music in that sound.”7 [notes.html#ch10fn_7a]A woman in the audience that day was so moved that she wrote an anonymous letterto Chalmers. She seemed especially stunned when a slave collar and whip weredisplayed on the stage as props. Douglass somehow used them to solicit laughter.“Oh it is too serious a matter,” the woman wrote, “to make sport of.” But “Fre.Douglass did make me laugh when he preached the boys in Dundee send back themoney.”8 [notes.html#ch10fn_8a]All through winter and spring 1846, the Send Back the Money campaign keptScotland in ferment, and “a blaze of anti-slavery agitation,” Douglass proudlyreported. The slogan appeared on flags and placards wherever the abolitionistsrallied and became the subject of what Douglass called “popular street songs.”Children shouted about the controversy from street corners. Douglass’s voice andhis image popped up in the lyrics of some songs, such as the one that capturedthe conflict between the black abolitionist and the Free Church’s Chalmers:Chalmy and Blackie ran a race,Chalmy fell and broke his face,Quo’ Blackie I have won the race,And the sow’s tail till him yet,And the sow’s tail till him yet,And the sow’s tail to Chalmy.In the turf on Arthur’s Seat, the giant hill that overlooks Edinburgh, someindustrious Scots carved SEND BACK THE MONEY! in huge letters visible all overthe city. The controversy over the Free Church, Douglass told Webb, hurt hisbook sales, but he felt inspired nonetheless to be part of a public debate ofsuch “grandeur and gravity.”9 [notes.html#ch10fn_9a]Image [../images/f0160-1.jpg]Sir Walter Scott monument, unveiled just two years before Douglass’s first visitto Scotland in 1846, with Arthur’s Seat in the background, Edinburgh, Scotland.Douglass was effective on the platform for many reasons—charisma, passion,rhetorical skill, his authenticity as a former slave, his persuasive powers. ButVernon Loggins, in 1931, one of the earliest modern literary critics ofDouglass’s abilities, may have captured it best. Douglass, wrote Loggins,possessed a unique “gracefulness” in mingling “argument with incident.” He could“bring out his sermon without destroying his story.”10 [notes.html#ch10fn_10a]This storyteller thrived in Scotland, the land of sermons, song, and poetry.It helped to be attacked in the press and in the lecture halls. Douglassrelished the role of villain to proslavery forces. As he later recalled, “It hashappened to me . . . often to be more indebted to my enemies than to my ownskill.” In the fall of 1845, after publication of Douglass’s Narrative, an A. C.C. Thompson of Wilmington, Delaware, a man who had grown up on a farm near St.Michaels, Maryland, and who knew Thomas Auld and Edward Covey, challenged theveracity of the autobiography in the Delaware Republican. Thompson accusedDouglass of writing a “budget of falsehoods,” defended the characters of ColonelEdward Lloyd, of Auld, and of Covey as practicing Methodists; as “goodChristian” men, they were incapable of the violence and abuse Douglass hadclaimed. Unwittingly, Thompson played right into the young abolitionist’s hands.In a public letter to the Liberator in January 1846, Douglass sarcasticallythanked Thompson for confirming his identity. The former Talbot County nativehad remembered the young slave as Fred Bailey. No one could now sustain a claimthat he was an impostor, Douglass said, as he reminded Thompson of hisinadvertent good deed: “You have done a piece of anti-slavery work, which noanti-slavery man could do.” Thompson called Douglass a “recreant slave” and saidhe knew Douglass the year he lived with Covey. “Edward Covey is not a creatureof my imagination,” Douglass rejoiced.11 [notes.html#ch10fn_11a]Thompson also asserted that Fred Bailey could not have written the book inquestion. One can feel the glee in Douglass’s response, as writer, to thischarge. “You must not judge me now by what I then was,” he told Thompson.“Frederick Douglass the freeman is a very different person from FrederickBailey, the slave.” Then he addressed Thompson personally: “You remember when Iused to meet you on the road to St. Michael’s, or near Covey’s lane gate, Ihardly dared lift my head, and look up at you. If I should meet you now, amidthe free hills of old Scotland, where the ancient ‘black Douglass’ once met hisfoes, I suppose I might summon sufficient fortitude to look you full in theface; and were you to attempt to make a slave of me . . . you might find mealmost as disagreeable a subject as was the Douglass to whom I just referred.”12[notes.html#ch10fn_12a]Douglass had books to sell, a career to promote, and his liberty to protect. Inthe second Irish edition of the Narrative, he published his full exchange withThompson and wrote about it in the preface. Thompson was the perfectrepresentative of the slaveholders’ mentality. “I am an American slave,” wroteDouglass proudly, “who has given my tyrant the slip. . . . He [Thompson] agreeswith me in at least the important fact, that I am what I proclaim myself to be,an ungrateful fugitive from the patriarchal institution of the slave states.” Itwas as if the fugitive had found Thompson sitting at one of Douglass’sperformances of the “Slaveholder’s Sermon,” chained him to a pew up front, actedout a dialogue with the squirming, sweating former Marylander, and could nowsummon him to stand and verify all that the orator had just preached.13[notes.html#ch10fn_13a]Douglass endured the clandestine innuendo and sniping of Webb and otherGarrisonians behind his back; but he also had to face public attacks on hischaracter. While he was in Belfast, not only had “Send Back the Nigger!”leaflets been distributed in the streets, but a Reverend Thomas Smyth, aBelfast-born emigrant to Charleston, South Carolina, had worked with otheranti-abolitionist supporters of the Free Church to circulate a rumor thatDouglass had been seen leaving a house of ill repute in Manchester, England.Smyth, a pillar of the Presbyterian synod of South Carolina, had played aprimary role in raising slaveholders’ contributions to the Free Church ofScotland. A glance at Douglass’s speaking itineraries during his first half yearin the British Isles indicates that he had not yet set foot in Manchester whenSmyth launched the rumors. Such a scurrilous effort to discredit the blackabolitionist blew up in the perpetrators’ faces; Douglass publicly threatened tosue Smyth for defamation of character, forcing the South Carolinian to issue anapology through lawyers.14 [notes.html#ch10fn_14a]Racist and proslavery forces provided Douglass with these opportunities toremake his story for yet wider audiences. In an April 1846 letter from Glasgowto Horace Greeley, Douglass publicly enlisted the famous editor of the New YorkTribune in defending himself against all the enemies who would “break a bruisedreed.” The editors of the conservative New York Herald and New York Express hadcondemned Douglass’s criticisms of America while on his tour of England. Onecalled him a “glib-tongued scoundrel” for “running amuck in greedy-eared Britainagainst America, its people, its institutions, and even against its peace.” Ineffect, Douglass used Greeley’s paper to thank such enemies for their “vulgarepithets,” and to shame his country for its brutal contradictions. He showed offby using a line from Othello to make his point: “The head and front of myoffending hath this extent, no more.” Then he defined patriotism: “The bestfriend of a nation is he who most faithfully rebukes her for her sins—and he herworst enemy who, under the specious . . . garb of patriotism seeks to excuse,palliate or defend them.” Still a moral suasionist, he hoped to bringslaveholders themselves, and all their abettors among New York editors, to“repent and purify themselves” through a realization of their country’s“monstrous anomaly.”15 [notes.html#ch10fn_15a] He was grateful to become sonotorious back home while working the antislavery stages of foreign lands. Itmade the strain and isolation of so many long days and nights in small Scottishand English towns worth it.This kind of rhetorical or journalistic jousting animated Douglass, morally andpsychologically. And during the Scotland-England sojourn of 1846–47, he neededfrequent spiritual boosts. Douglass was often homesick. “I am enjoying myself aswell as anyone can be expected,” Douglass told Garrison in April, “whenseparated from home by three thousand miles of deep blue ocean. I long to be athome—‘home, sweet, sweet, sweet home! Be it ever so humble, there is no placelike home.’ ” He missed his family and mentioned that some new friends had urgedhim to stay and make Britain his permanent home. “But this I cannot do, unlessit shall be absolutely necessary for my personal freedom.” He also missedtrusted old friends. In July, back in Edinburgh, he wrote a personal letter toWilliam White, who had saved Douglass’s life from the mob in Pendleton, Indiana.Douglass said he had just had a dream about White, how they had fought “like twovery brothers,” and how his friend “looked bleeding.” Douglass assured Whitethat he still loved him and wished White could come join him in Edinburgh, “oneof the most beautiful cities” Douglass had ever seen. In a letter full oflonging for comradeship, Douglass wondered openly whether White thought it safefor him to return home now that the Aulds knew so much of his whereabouts andmight try to “take me from the Old Bay State.”16 [notes.html#ch10fn_16a] Thereis evidence that Douglass felt tempted to try to transport Anna and their foursmall children to a new home in England. But such a move was never a genuineoption.Douglass betrayed an even deeper homesickness and loneliness to a fictivesister, Ruth Cox, who after her escape from Eastern Shore slavery adopted thename Harriet Bailey. She and Douglass first met in 1844 while he was on aspeaking tour in Pennsylvania. Ruth Cox was born a slave sometime between 1818and 1822 in Talbot County, Maryland. Her mother, Ebby Cox, had been a slave inthe Easton home of US representative and senator John Leeds Kerr (1780–1844).Her father was a free black laborer who at some point relocated to Baltimore.Douglass may at first have mistaken Ruth for his sister Eliza, who had beennamed for their mother, and whom he had not seen since 1836. Facing imminentsale upon the death of her owner in 1844, Ruth escaped through Delaware and thento West Chester, Pennsylvania, where she found refuge among the large Quakercommunity. The mistaken identities could not have lasted long; Douglass invitedRuth, under the assumed role of the abolitionist’s sister, to join his family inLynn, Massachusetts. As a fugitive slave in danger, Ruth, like her putativebrother, needed protection and a new name. In background, age, and experience,the two Eastern Shore natives had much in common. In 1836, when theeighteen-year-old Frederick Bailey had been dragged in chains to the Eastonjail, Ruth lived only a few blocks up the street.17 [notes.html#ch10fn_17a] Theyeagerly shared memories of people and events, and of the horrible as well ascomic circumstances of slavery.Image [../images/f0164-01.jpg]Ruth Cox Adams, Douglass’s adopted sister, c. 1870. Tintype.Ruth was literate, a crucial fact in the Douglasses’ household. Ruth/Harrietcould read and interpret letters from the wandering Frederick to the homeboundAnna. For a few crucial years, especially during Frederick’s long sojourn inEngland, the newly renamed Harriet became confidant, economic aide, babysitter,and sister to Anna. Harriet may for a time have been the mediator in theDouglasses’ difficult marriage. Douglass clearly looked to Harriet for sympathyand understanding. To her he wrote the most intimate letters of any we have fromthis early part of his career, in a down-home, insider dialect that he almostnever otherwise used. In May 1846, a lonely, discouraged Douglass, having “fitsof melancholy,” sent “a few loving words to my own Dear Sister Harriet.” He madeit “very plain” so that she could read it “without much trouble.” His health was“tolerable,” but he often had “real low spirits.” Then the language seems tocome from a slave quarters in Talbot Country, or perhaps a kitchen conversationin the Lynn cottage. Douglass described himself as “down at the mouth. I feltworse than ‘get out.’ ” The weary American traveler said his “under lip hunglike that of a motherless colt. I looked so ugly that I hated to see myself in aglass. There was no living for me. I was snappish. I would have kicked my grand‘dadda’! . . . ‘dats a fac! ole missus—is you got any ting for poor nigger toeat!!!’ Oh Harriet could I have seen you then. How soon would I have beenrelieved from that Horrible feeling.” Douglass needed a “Sisterly hand” strokinghis “feverish forehead . . . to make me forget my sadness.”18[notes.html#ch10fn_18a] He needed anything that would emotionally take him home.Douglass told Harriet that he had recently overcome his depression by buying an“old fiddle” he discovered in a store window near his London hotel. Thusdemonstrating how early he had taken up playing the violin (self-taught), hesaid that making music cured him, as he struck up the tune “Camels a coming!” asong likely based on Genesis 24, the story of how Rebekah brought water from thewell for the men and camels and became the wife of Abraham’s son Isaac. “Theysay music is good for insane people,” Douglass revealed to Harriet, “and Ibelieve everybody are more or less insane—at times I feel very foolish when Icome out of my fits of insanity.” This was a dour and psychologically strugglingDouglass, desperate for a woman’s sympathy and not mere admiration. After allthat brilliance and adulation in public arenas, he needed a private outlet, aperson to whom he could complain and pour out his woes. Douglass enclosed aletter to Anna and instructed Harriet to read it “over and over again until shecan fully understand its contents.” He then profusely thanked Harriet for herdevotion to his young sons, her attention to Anna, and for her “loving letters”sent to him in England. In return he promised Harriet “a brother’s love and afather’s care.”19 [notes.html#ch10fn_19a]Harriet received more of such care than she ultimately wanted. That summer shewrote to Frederick telling him of her intention to marry, but apparently withoutindicating the man’s name or background, and certainly without asking hersupposed brother’s blessing. “Shocked and surprised,” Douglass exploded withpaternalistic anger. Not knowing Harriet’s “lover,” Douglass oddly worried thatshe might be “on the brink of distruction.” “You don’t honor me so much as toask my advice,” complained the wounded brother. Harriet had asked him for a“light silk dress” for her wedding. Douglass then lectured a woman threethousand miles away about marriage: “Marriage is one act of our lives—onceperformed it cannot be undone.” He warned Harriet, who had lived through manystruggles, not to make a mistake that “may lead to a life of misery andwretchedness.” Douglass may have revealed more here about himself than heintended. Pathetically, he tried to let go, but at least in this letter fromisolated London, he could only offer that he would “rejoice” to see her married,as long as the groom was not “some ignorant—idle worthless person.” “It will bea soar trial,” he moped, “for me to part with you.”20 [notes.html#ch10fn_20a]In November 1847 in Lynn, Harriet did indeed marry a free black laborer, alsofrom Talbot County, Maryland, living in Springfield, Massachusetts, named PerryFrank Adams. Douglass stood at her wedding. Although she remained a fugitiveslave, she eventually took back her original name and became Ruth Cox Adams. Butduring his British sojourn Douglass was hurt by her news, losing control over awoman he clearly needed—for his family’s cohesion and welfare (of which at thispoint he provided little) and for himself. As historian Leigh Fought has argued,Douglass had never known a nuclear family until he and Anna created one in NewBedford and Lynn. But Frederick had been gone on the lecture circuit for monthsand now for nearly two years. Harriet may have been not only his best way tocommunicate with his wife and family, but a link that made that familypossible.21 [notes.html#ch10fn_21a] At times, Douglass, staying in otherpeople’s homes, in nice if sterile hotels in beautiful European cities where hecould only feel out of place, may not have fully grasped which roles he wantedto assume toward Harriet Bailey. They shared so much; they were Eastern ShoreNegroes, fugitive slaves seeking refuge, confidants. Harriet was Anna’shelpmate, companion to the growing Rosetta, the aunt who could help nurturethree small boys without their father, and perhaps even the image of theliterate black woman Douglass may at times have wished he had brought out ofBaltimore with him.• • •Before leaving Scotland, Douglass became a tourist in search of the land’sromantic military history and especially of Robert Burns. While traveling to thenorth from Edinburgh, Douglass wrote to his friend in Boston Francis Jacksonabout the landscape and its bloody past: “Almost every hill, river, mountain, orlake has been made classic by the heroic deeds of her noble sons. Scarcely astream but has been poured into song, or a hill that is not associated with somefierce and bloody conflict between liberty and slavery.” How Douglass seemed tolove trying out his own version of the epic story of the Highlands! He had seenthe “Grampion mountains,” he reported, where “ancient crown heads use to . . .struggle in deadly conflict for supremacy, causing those grand old hills to runblood.” Suddenly the young romantic wrote as though he were the author of apopular Scottish history or even a tourist guidebook. Or perhaps he suddenlyfelt the burden of the namesake he had borrowed from Sir Walter Scott. Tryingstill to be a good nonresistant, he claimed his “soul now sickens” at thisviolent past, but admitted to seeing in himself “all those elements of characterwhich were I to yield to their promptings might lead me to deeds as bloody asthose.” He could not yet know just how true that impulse would be about his ownsoul over the coming decades when he would abandon pacifism forever.22[notes.html#ch10fn_22a]In April, Douglass visited Ayr, birthplace of Burns, on the west coast ofScotland. Springtime found the young man’s romanticism in full bloom. Informinghis friend Abigail Mott of Albany that he was an “enthusiastic admirer ofBurns,” Douglass laced a letter with the names and lyrics of the love poet’smost famous works. Douglass seems to have loved “Tam O’Shanter” and told Abigailso, despite that long poem’s drunken and sexual ribaldry. To the proper MissMott, to whom the Douglasses sent their daughter Rosetta to live and study from1845 to 1848, Frederick sent the two full verses of the tamer poem “The Banks o’Doon,” a classic expression of nature, beauty, and lost love. He gushed over theBurns Monument, “the finest thing of the kind I ever saw.” And he was especiallydrawn to a glass case containing a Bible given to Burns by “Sweet HighlandMary,” accompanied by a lock of her hair. Mary had died, and Douglass admittedhis reverence for the “deep melancholy” all around, even for the very sounds ofthe river Doon. He met the surviving sister of the great bard, Mrs. Beggs, wholived on the property. Her two daughters merited detailed description as “trulyfine looking women.” The sublime autobiographer seized the chance to try hishand at what he called “that broad Scottish tongue.” Douglass adored Burnsbecause he had stood against the “bigotry” of the clergy and the“shallow-brained aristocracy” of his own time. Burns remained heroic because he“broke loose from the moorings which society had thrown around him.” Douglassadmitted that Burns’s famous sexual escapades meant that he had done “much goodand much evil.” But “brilliant genius” must be forgiven, Douglass said. “Let ustake the good and leave the evil—let us adopt his virtues but avoid his vices.”Here were precepts that Douglass would need in his own tangled life. And ifBurns had lived and written with a unique “performative intensity,” as one ofhis modern biographers suggests, then Douglass had a model in life and on thepage.23 [notes.html#ch10fn_23a]Image [../images/f0168-01.jpg]Robert Burns. Lantern slide. Warren S. Parker photographer.Between May 1846, when Douglass made his first appearance in London, and April1847, when he finally returned to the United States, he delivered scores offormal speeches all over the towns and cities of England. It was a year of greatadventure and discontent. By August, Garrison sailed to England and now joinedDouglass on platforms in many venues from London to Edinburgh. With Garrison andwithout, Douglass met many English reformers and members of Parliament, dinedwith luminaries, and even, movingly, met the great abolitionist Thomas Clarkson.Garrison arranged the meeting at Clarkson’s home in Ipswich on August 21, 1846.Douglass felt completely awed by meeting the great British abolitionist, blindand only one month from death, the living link to the crusades that had led tothe abolition of both the slave trade and slavery in the British empire. WithGarrison and famed British abolitionist George Thompson, Douglass enteredClarkson’s parlor. Douglass remembered the meeting as an encounter with aworld-historical figure, with the history Douglass himself now hoped he hadentered. “It was a meeting of two centuries,” Douglass recollected; the youngman with a sense of history had never quite felt its intensity so profoundlybefore. He never forgot how Clarkson “took one of my hands in both of his, andin a tremulous voice, said, ‘God bless you Frederick Douglass! I have givensixty years of my life to the emancipation of your people, and if I had sixtyyears more they should all be given to the same cause.’ ”24[notes.html#ch10fn_24a] In his old age, when Douglass himself encountered peoplewho just wanted to say they had touched his hand, he could say that he hadtouched the hands of Thomas Clarkson, whose intrepid travel, collecting, andadvocacy had done so much to end slavery in the British empire.Douglass continued to tangle with Richard Webb about the availability and layoutof new copies of the Narrative, as well as over his financial accounts with thepublisher. Webb continued to view the author with contempt in private letters.By September and October he snidely wrote to Chapman, describing a new“steadiness” in Frederick that he attributed to Garrison’s presence. Douglasswas a “sharp man,” Webb reported, but he needed the “ballast” that his seniormentor supplied. Even nastier, Webb suggested that all the lionizing Douglassexperienced in Scotland and England would cause him great disappointment when hereturned to the harsh racial climate as well as his personal situation inAmerica. “From what I hear of her, I wonder how he will be able to bear thesight of his wife,” Webb remarked, “after all the petting he gets frombeautiful, elegant, and accomplished women in a country where prejudice againstcolour . . . is laughed at.” Douglass remained annoyed at best with Chapman’scontinued snooping into his every move. When challenged for attending a meetingof the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (the Garrisonians’ ideologicalrival), Douglass wrote to Chapman and told her to mind her own business. He didnot attend out of “money temptations,” he declared, assuring the connivingChapman that he would “speak in any meeting where free speech is allowed.”25[notes.html#ch10fn_25a] We should not wonder why Douglass often found itdifficult to trust people; in his dangerous world, friends and enemies weresometimes indistinguishable.During his final year in Britain, Douglass contemplated returning home toAmerica. But he was still a slave and needed to make money from book sales topay his bills. He remained lonely and cantankerous, although he sustained a firmpublic face. In July he experienced some sort of falling-out with his specialfriend in Cork, Isabel Jennings. On the same day that he wrote the letter fullof yearning and nostalgia to William White, Douglass apologized to “Dear Isa”for his “naughty letter” that made her so angry, as well as for an embitteredexchange he had experienced with an Irish minister. “I cannot be always upon themountain top,” he remarked, asking for indulgence of his darker side. “You toldme nothing new,” he said to Isabel, “when you told me that I wasimperfect. . . . I am indeed a very imperfect being.” Even Garrison, who oftensent brief remarks back to his wife about how Douglass was “doing a great work,”admitted in September that “the poor fellow is—naturally enough—sighing to seehis wife and children.”26 [notes.html#ch10fn_26a]In the summer of 1846 Douglass seems to have seriously entertained relocatinghis family to Britain, an issue that weighed heavily on his mind. In July hewrote to “my own dear sister Harriet,” enclosing a special letter to Anna andone to a New Bedford friend, Jeremiah Burke Sanderson. As before, he imploredHarriet to read them “over and over again until Dear Anna shall fullyunderstand.” He states that the “Boys must wait for presents till I come home,or until they come to this country.” He further asks his adopted sister to speakfrankly of “what you think of coming to this country.”27 [notes.html#ch10fn_27a]This prospect would fade in coming months, but it is telling how seriouslyDouglass seems to have considered a permanent rejection of the United States. Hedid have some British friends he trusted; and he had countless times remindedaudiences that he was still property under the laws of Maryland.But the road beckoned, the speaking circuit demanded him, and Garrison was onceagain leading the way. Many of those adoring British supporters really did wantto help. A consortium of Douglass’s British friends, led by a Quaker, EllenRichardson of Newcastle, and her sister-in-law, Anna Richardson, began workingassiduously in 1846 to contact the Aulds in Maryland and arrange the purchase ofFrederick’s freedom. By at least May Douglass had learned that Thomas Auld hadtransferred ownership of his long-lost slave to his brother Hugh, and that theBaltimore merchant who had once tried to stop the boy from reading now publiclyhad stated his desire, at any cost, to return him to slavery. This claim ofAuld’s desire to exact revenge has never been documented and may have emerged asuseful abolitionist lore. In a public letter to Garrison, Douglass enjoyedtaunting Hugh Auld, calling him the “hungry blood hound.” “Possess your soul inpatience, dear master Hugh, and regale yourself on the golden dreams afforded bythe prospect—‘First catch your rabbit, &c. &c.’ ”28 [notes.html#ch10fn_28a]Sometime that summer of 1846, on a visit to Ellen Richardson and her brother inNewcastle, Douglass’s hosts took him out to the seaside for a holiday of a sort.According to an extraordinary interview conducted by Ida B. Wells in April 1894with the eighty-five-year-old Ellen, the elderly Quaker remembered sitting onthe sand talking at length with Douglass and, after “observing his sadness,”hatching their plan to buy his freedom.29 [notes.html#ch10fn_29a] On one ofthose visits to Newcastle he also met Julia Griffiths, an unmarried Englishabolitionist, who would soon become an extremely important friend and coworkerin Douglass’s life.Douglass underwent much confusion about when and how to return to his family inMassachusetts. As of late August he was determined to sail home in earlyNovember. To Anna Richardson, then already involved in negotiations with HughAuld, Douglass declared that “my Anna says ‘Come home’ and I have now resolvedupon going home—the day is fixed and my dear Anna will be informed of it in afew days. I shall sail for America on the fourth November—and hope to meet thebeloved one of my heart by the 20th of that month.” He urged Mrs. Richardson tocontinue corresponding with Auld. But one month later, he wrote to IsabelJennings, concerned that she would think him “the most fickle of men” because hehad decided to “stay in this country six months longer.” He claimed the strongadvice of Garrison and George Thompson had led to such a choice—they deemed himmore essential to the antislavery movement in Britain just then than in America.Indeed, now touring England with Douglass, Garrison acted a bit like the shipcaptain, and his young black orator was merely a member of the crew obeyingorders. Garrison acknowledged Douglass’s homesickness in mid-September, butwrote that “Frederick . . . will not return till next May” in time for “our NewEngland Convention.” If they took the black star off the British circuit, theywould “lose a great deal of what otherwise will be permanently secured to us.”30[notes.html#ch10fn_30a]Garrison’s “us” did not include a financially struggling black family back inLynn, Massachusetts. But Douglass was now also eagerly hoping for a deal withAuld and his manumission papers, although he was clearly troubled that he mustonce again disappoint Anna. “It will cause her some pain,” he remarked toIsabel.31 [notes.html#ch10fn_31a] The pain of longing and separation were bythen a way of life for the Douglasses. Douglass’s choice left him holding acleft stick: return to American soil a yet more famous and vulnerable fugitiveslave in the midst of the Mexican War crisis, or wait until the possiblepurchase of his freedom.By November–December the Richardsons succeeded in raising the money and securingAuld’s agreement to manumit Douglass for £150 sterling, or $711.66. Likely withthe help of Douglass’s old friend William White, the Richardsons had contactedthe wealthy and well-connected member of the AASS Ellis Gray Loring of Boston,who engaged a New York lawyer, Walter Lowrie, who then found a Baltimoreattorney who became the intermediary with Hugh Auld. Through this set of actors,Auld had named his price in an exchange of letters directly with Anna Richardsonfrom August to October 1846. From Auld came the words: “manumission of my slaveFrederick Bailey, alias Douglass . . . in other words the papers will render himentirely and legally free.” Rather than a cause for celebration, the purchase ofa slave’s freedom as property was an extraordinarily sensitive issue among someabolitionists, especially Garrisonians. Douglass received celebratory sentimentsfrom friends, but also many objections to his “ransom” deal.32[notes.html#ch10fn_32a] In response to the critics, he turned the purchase ofhis freedom into antislavery propaganda; and this time, it was not about sendingback the blood money, but sending abolitionist lucre to America to own his bodyand life.Douglass freely admitted his gratitude that the sale made it possible for him toreturn to his wife and family with security, whatever principle might be atstake for hard-line moralists. But in a private letter to fellow American,Garrisonian, and frequent traveling companion in Britain Henry C. Wright (whocondemned the purchase), as well as in a public letter to a Durham, England,newspaper editor, Douglass elevated the issue to what he thought was even moreradical high ground.The objection was that no man had the “right of property” in another man and,therefore, paying for the freedom of a fugitive slave reinforced the evils socondemned by abolitionists. But the absolutists be damned; Douglass was happy toend his “present exile,” he declared, on a basic human and familial level. Healso argued that his liberty was of more value than “paltry gold.” Then heconverted the act into a fierce condemnation of the “brazen hypocrisy” of hiscountry. Practicing arguments he would master later in the 1850s, he assertedthat “Hugh Auld had no power over me but what was conferred by the United Statesgovernment.” To the “violation of correct principle,” as one Ohio abolitionistpaper put it, of “the redemption of one slave, when millions are in a conditionequally bad,” Douglass sighed impatiently and concluded with the weak claim thathis friends had “denied” Auld’s “right to receive” the money in their offerletter. Douglass said he was personally trapped like an unprotected merchantgiving his “purse to a bloody pirate: take my purse, but spare my life.” In thiscase, the pirate was a slaveholder with the power of “commander-in-chief of thearmy and navy.” And to Wright’s objection that Douglass would lose his symbolicpower as a fugitive slave, Douglass scoffed, “I shall be Frederick Douglassstill; and once a slave still. I shall neither be made to forget, nor cease tofeel the wrongs of my fellow countrymen, who are yet in chains.” Above all,Douglass relished now the chance to wave his manumission papers as the “brand ofinfamy” on his “nation of plunderers.”33 [notes.html#ch10fn_33a] Despite some ofthe logic of his defense, Douglass had nevertheless been handed a new sword—hislegal freedom purchased by blood money—with which to slay anew the dragons ofAmerican hypocrisy.• • •During his final six months in England in 1846–47, Douglass remained out on theantislavery stump all over the country, especially in the north, speaking tomany issues, old and new. His British sojourn became a true flowering ofpersonal independence, but also of intellectual challenge and growth. He andGarrison were uniquely confronted by the Chartist movement, the decade-oldcrusade for workers’ rights, especially suffrage. By the time Douglass faced thequestion of the rights of British workers and their resistance to aristocraticrule in England, he had already both resisted and sometimes warmed to theanalogy of Irish extreme poverty to American slavery. But now he encountered alarge political working-class movement, part of which advocated peacefulparliamentary reform, based on the famous “People’s Charter,” forged in 1838 bythe London Working Men’s Association, part of which demanded tactics of“physical force” and revolution against the Poor Laws. The charter that gave themovement its name had originally been drafted at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in1838 on the Strand in London, where Douglass and Garrison would themselves meetwith Chartists in August 1846. The founding document contained several demands,but primarily they were universal male suffrage, annual elections, and otherreforms meant to make Parliament more responsive to ordinary people.Garrisonians had been well aware of the Chartists since at least 1840, whenGarrison himself partially embraced their cause on his visit to England.34[notes.html#ch10fn_34a]Douglass tended to follow Garrison’s lead on the delicate issue of the Chartistsand British workers. Here was a great opportunity for cooperative transatlanticreform. But the dream of the black-slaves/white-workers alliance around theirmutual forms of oppression rarely advanced beyond rhetoric; a flourishing 1840ssolidarity remained elusive. During Garrison’s tour in England and Scotland inlate summer and fall of 1846, accompanied most places by Douglass and GeorgeThompson, the Bostonian openly embraced what he called the “moral suasionistChartists,” and their leaders, William Lovett and Henry Vincent. At a September2 gathering of Chartists in London, Garrison reported speaking not in any“official capacity” as an abolitionist, but as a private citizen endorsing the“unpopular reformatory movements in this country.” Thunderous applause rockedthe hall in response to Garrison’s personal support of the workingmen’s questfor equal political rights. Douglass too could talk the talk of themoral-suasionist wing of Chartism. Writing publicly to Garrison, Douglassreported speaking at an earlier London meeting of the “complete SuffrageAssociation,” the group of Chartists opposed to using physical force. He called“complete suffrage” the next reform movement. “Aristocratic rule must end,”Douglass told his mentor in a flourish, “class legislation must cease,” and“people, not property shall govern.”35 [notes.html#ch10fn_35a] Douglass hadheard and read the Chartists carefully, even if he never quite shouldered theircause fully.Douglass enjoyed personal friendships with some Chartist leaders. Lovettrecalled in his autobiography a social evening with Douglass, Garrison,Thompson, and Wright among others. Lovett wrote that after some speech-making ofa kind, “our friend Douglass, who had a fine voice, sang a number of negromelodies. Mr. Garrison sang several antislavery pieces, and our grave friend, H.C. Wright, sang an old Indian war song.” The group concluded with a rousingrendition of “La Marseillaise.”36 [notes.html#ch10fn_36a] Douglass loved musicbut seemed to have too few opportunities to demonstrate it.Such conviviality and mutual support was quite real. But what ultimately madeDouglass pull back on the public platform was the frequent analogy between blackAmerican slaves and the alleged “white slaves” of the British wage system, aclaim made inside and outside Chartism. As a man of words, Douglass faced manytensions and contradictions on this issue. He could claim over and over, as hehad back in Ireland, that his mission was “purely an antislavery one,” but writefrequently how he was learning to “enter into the wrongs of others” as the only“true foundation for his antislavery faith.” In a speech in Bristol in lateAugust 1846, Douglass seemed to acknowledge “political slavery in England” andgave a nod to the virtual slavery of men in the British army and navy. Heproclaimed his hatred for all forms of tyranny and oppression, but then statedfirmly that “there was no similarity between slavery, as existing in the UnitedStates, and any institution in this country, than there was between lightnessand darkness.” A week later in Bridgwater, England, Douglass felt challenged bythe analogy again. After reciting his litany of the evils of American slaverywreaked upon both body and mind, he concluded unequivocally, “Were there anysuch in this country? There was not one! The humblest man in the realm couldresist the proudest aristocrat, backed up by the shield of the British law! Notso the slave.” Douglass thus parted ways with those Chartists who still clung toslogans such as “Death to aristocrats!” and even with the moral-suasionistcrusaders for workers’ rights who knew something about just how much thelaboring poor in England could ultimately resist the aristocrats whose bootscrushed their necks.37 [notes.html#ch10fn_37a]Douglass’s heart, indeed his pride as a radical reformer, remained attached tothe millions of his fellow bondmen back in republican America. He was surelyinspired by the workers’ plight and their movement culture in Britain, but prideof place in the worldwide argument over enslavement, he insisted, dwelt not withwage slaves but with those who possessed no wage and often no hope. Although hecould often draw laughs with a favorite line such as “In the absence of thecash, there must be the lash,” as he did in Sheffield in March 1847, the jokewas dead serious.38 [notes.html#ch10fn_38a]During Douglass’s British tour he continued to hammer away at the hypocrisy ofthe churches. He spoke in chapels and churches of all sizes, in city halls andpublic rooms of all kinds, in the music halls of Leeds or Newcastle, or the CornExchange of Manchester. Douglass was everywhere (London one day and by the newtrain lines four hundred miles north in Edinburgh two days later). No wonder hecould reflect so joyously on how he and his “trunk” had traveled with “electricspeed” through all parts of the country. He lectured on behalf of temperance,against a favorite target (the hypocrisy of the international EvangelicalAlliance and its refusal to reject slaveholders), and especially to promote theBritish Garrisonian organization, the Anti-Slavery League. Douglass addressedtwenty-five hundred to three thousand at Finsbury Chapel in London in May 1846,an estimated four thousand at the Free Trade Hall in Manchester, and twenty-fivehundred at the Concert Hall in Liverpool in October, among many other similarthrongs. One intrepid twenty-first-century researcher has estimated thatDouglass delivered 184 speeches during his British sojourn.39[notes.html#ch10fn_39a] For a young former slave devoting his life to thebrutally uncertain vocation of radical reformer, these cheering, laughing, andsometimes abusive audiences were his wellspring of hope.On Douglass’s nonstop farewell tour in winter and spring 1847, he blasted hisown country and its entanglement in the great evil of slavery. The big theme heleft ringing in the ears of thousands was the plight of the American slave, thedeep contradictions of American professions and practices, and the nature ofslavery itself, often embodied poignantly in his personal story. As he preparedto finally sail home with his freedom, his own country was his primary subject.On March 30, to an elegant and prominent audience, gathered to honor him byinvitation only, estimated at four hundred to seven hundred (Charles Dickenssent a letter of regret), in the London Tavern on Bishopsgate Street, Douglassdelivered what he called his “Farewell Address to the British People.” Hequickly put ceremonial talk behind him and delivered a blistering critique ofthe American Constitution and the United States as a corrupted, wholly complicitslave society. His central theme, pronounced with humor, withering satire, andpainful personal imagery, was his country as a “nation of inconsistencies,completely made up of inconsistencies.”40 [notes.html#ch10fn_40a]Douglass had been speaking almost nightly for as much as two hours each. Butthis was a bravura performance. He drew tremendous cheering with repeated claimsthat he had “no patriotic applause for America or her institutions.” Here werehis rehearsals for one of the great themes of his public rhetoric to come in the1850s. Douglass dragged his overdressed auditors, sipping elegant drinks,through one “blood” metaphor after another. The “history,” he declared, of “thesons and daughters of Africa . . . is nothing but blood! Blood!—blood in themorning, blood at noon, blood at night!” The symbol of America’s history mightbe “gold dripping with gore from the plantations.” His own country had become,he insisted, “one vast hunting ground for men.” Slavery was ensconced inAmerican society, “interwoven with the very texture—with the whole network” ofinstitutions. Douglass entertained with voices, accents, and mimicry ofslaveholding preachers and defenders of the Evangelical Alliance; the crowdroared with hilarity.41 [notes.html#ch10fn_41a]But possibly what such a crowd would remember most was how Douglass wove hisindictments of his own land and of slavery through his own personality, offeringhimself as the representative of all slaves. The twenty-nine-year-old had longemployed this method, but so confident was he in front of British audiences thathe offered himself as specimen—mind, body, and soul. “I scarcely know what tosay in America,” he said, “when I hear men get up and deliberately assert aright to property in my limbs—my very body and soul; that they have a right tome! That I am in their hands . . . a thing to be bought and sold!” Douglass madeit more personal yet, describing how Thomas Auld, whom in this rare instance hecalled his “father,” had given him away to his “brother” Hugh. “Thus was Itransferred by my father to my uncle,” he announced, in a statement that musthave astonished some close readers of his Narrative, where his paternity hadbeen left ambiguous. “I have as much right to sell Hugh Auld as Hugh Auld has tosell me,” he shouted as some in the room bent over in laughter. Douglasseffusively thanked his British compatriots for all their friendship, theirfinancial help, and their inspirations during his nineteen months among them.With bravado, he vowed to return to “glory in the conflict” at home in America.He did his utmost to return their love, which he felt “daguerreotyped on myheart” by their “sea of upturned faces.” They had laughed and cried with him formore than an hour, and as the American sat down on the stage, “long-continuedcheering” enveloped the London Tavern.42 [notes.html#ch10fn_42a]Four days later on a quay in Liverpool, Douglass lifted his trunk onto theCambria once again for the return voyage to America. He was a changed man, anexperienced orator-writer and professional abolitionist with an internationalreputation, an “illustrious transatlantic,” as a Sheffield newspaper had calledhim. He would never again be a good follower; from this day forward he did nottake direction well from abolitionist handlers, although he would remain aconstant learner and seeker of new strategies, new methods of mingling the powerof the word with the power of politics. Douglass boarded the ship, again underhumiliating conditions of segregated quarters, which became a cause célèbre inthe British and American antislavery press. But now he was no longer a fugitiveslave, and he held more than $2,000 from his British friends, intended as asupport for his family but especially for his publicly declared intention tocreate his own newspaper.43 [notes.html#ch10fn_43a]After a voyage of fifteen days in the North Atlantic, Douglass arrived in BostonHarbor on April 20, 1847. A delegation of friends gathered at the docks to meethim. But so anxious was Douglass to see his family, he all but ran to the trainthat took him to Lynn within a half hour. His detailed description of thehomecoming in a letter back to Anna Richardson in England is one for the ages:“As soon as it was possible to land . . . from the steamer, I leaped on shore,without stopping a moment to look after luggage, and ran through a crowd offriends who had assembled on the wharf to meet me, simply bowing as I passed.”With heart pumping, he looked out the train window, “from which I saw all myfamily five minutes before getting home, as I had to get out of the station.When within about fifty yards of our house, I was met by my two bright-eyedboys, Lewis and Frederick, running and dancing with very joy to meet me. Takingone in my arms and the other by the hand, I hastened into the house. Hereimagination must fill up the picture.” Stunningly, Douglass ended his letter toAnna Richardson with effusive gratitude, of how “all England is dear to me.”Then he used two lines from Burns: “Kings may be blest, but I was glorious, /O’er all the ills of life victorious.” Then followed a simple line of his own:“It is good to be at home.”44 [notes.html#ch10fn_44a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 11--------------------------------------------------------------------------------DEMAGOGUE IN BLACKIf I speak harshly, my excuse is that I speak in fetters of your own forging.Remember that oppression hath the power to make even a wise man mad.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, NORTH STAR, NOVEMBER 17, 1848For a week and a half in late April 1847, Douglass felt thrilled to immersehimself, as he wrote to Scottish Quaker friends, in the “warm bosom” of family.He rejoiced especially that his two oldest sons remembered him well, a wistfulcomment on the nature of their father’s place in this home that Anna made. “Foronce,” Douglass declared, “all cares of a public nature were cast aside, and mywhole heart absorbed in grateful rapture.”1 [notes.html#ch11fn_1a] But such joyamong his children would not last long. Just where Douglass’s whole heart couldever rest, and just how he might ever find balance between the public and theprivate demands of his chosen paths, emerged now as the defining feature of hislife.Invitations to speak poured into Lynn. Not everyone among his friends wasentirely enamored with their protégé’s new persona. Only three days afterDouglass’s arrival in Boston, Wendell Phillips wrote privately, “Douglass ishere, the same old sixpence, fatter, with a tinge of English precisepronunciation, the same that Redmond [Remond] and Garrison infallibly bring homeand which, though good in itself, is still so foreign to our slipshod mannerthat I hope he will get rid of it soon.” Whether spouting some clipped Englishaccent or not, soon the traveling man was back on the road, and this time with aconfident and angrier voice. Stored in his soul, and his oratorical repertoire,were not only his life-changing triumphs in the British Isles, but also thesegregated “loneliness” he had endured on the return voyage on the Cambria.Douglass processed this insult in his normal way: he poured it into his well ofwounded but fierce pride and felt fortunate that he did not have to associatewith the proslavery “band of wild, uproarious, gambling tipplers, whosefoul-mouthed utterances interposed an impassable gulf between us.” He tried toturn his foes’ ugly ways to advantage, publicly exposing their absurd claims ofsuperiority.2 [notes.html#ch11fn_2a]But what to do with the anger? Douglass turned it on his own country in languagethat even some of his friends found troubling. In the coming year he would knowprecious little calm time in Lynn. After welcome-home meetings in Lynn andBoston and a trip to Albany, accompanied by Anna, to visit Rosetta, who residedthere with her governesses, Abigail and Lydia Mott, Douglass was in New York onMay 11 to speak at the thirteenth-anniversary meeting of the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society. This was no ordinary occasion; a crowd of nearly fourthousand, the largest ever at an AASS gathering, filled the Broadway Tabernacle.Implying that he was still working on his speech, Douglass entered the hallcarrying a portable writing desk. Virtually all major American abolitionistswere in attendance, as were many curious newspaper reporters. After WendellPhillips spoke, Garrison introduced Douglass with a prolonged speech of his ownabout the former fugitive slave’s successful sojourn in England. Garrison readfrom chapters 2 and 18 of Jeremiah, then long excerpts of press accounts ofDouglass’s farewell address in London as well as of his travail withdiscrimination aboard the Cambria. Garrison finally cut short his introductionas the crowd began to shout, “Douglass! Douglass!,” thus forcing the mentor tomake way for his star pupil.3 [notes.html#ch11fn_3a]Douglass spoke not only as a returning hero from his foreign travels, butprimarily as an angry young black American ready for a new kind of attack on hisnative land. He let it be known that, especially after his British experience,“home” and “country” were now ambivalent concepts. Douglass was excited to beback in the midst of this abolitionist community of comrades, but America wasanother matter. “I have no love for America, as such,” he jarringly announced.“I have no patriotism. I have no country.” Douglass let his righteous anger flowin metaphors of degradation, chains, and blood. “The institutions of thiscountry do not know me, do not recognize me as a man, except as a piece ofproperty.” The only thing attaching him to his native land was his family, andhis deeply felt ties to the “three millions of my fellow creatures groaningbeneath the iron rod . . . with . . . stripes upon their backs.” Only their“clanking . . . chains” and their “warm blood . . . making fat the soil ofMaryland and of Alabama” drew him back to America. Such a country, Douglasssaid, he could not love. “I desire to see its overthrow as speedily as possible,and its Constitution shivered in a thousand fragments.”4 [notes.html#ch11fn_4a]With loud cheers as well as hisses engulfing the entranced audience, Douglassstalked his prey.Already a master of the rhetorical device of the jeremiad—calling the fallennation back to its lost principles—but also now portraying himself as the victimof proslavery scorn, Douglass enjoyed being the aggressor. Claiming he wasconstantly accused of irritating Americans, rather than appealing to theirbetter instincts, Douglass happily pled guilty: “I admit that we have irritatedthem,” he declared. “They deserve to be irritated. As it is in physics, so inmorals, there are cases that demand irritation, and counter irritation. Theconscience of the American public needs this irritation. And I would blister itall over, from centre to circumference, until it gives signs of a purer . . .life than it is now manifesting to the world.” Douglass named the demons andstalked his prey. As the latter-day Jeremiah he spoke as did the ancientprophet, calling the nation to judgment for its mendacity, its wanton violationof its own covenants, and warning of its imminent ruin.5 [notes.html#ch11fn_5a]Saddled with the burden of having condemned his own country while abroad,Douglass reversed the charge. “Ministers of the Gospel from Christian America,”he maintained, were “pouring their leprous proslavery distilment into the ears”of foreigners and were themselves the true traitors. The British public hadneeded its eyes and ears opened to “the secrets of the prison house of bondagein America.” No place was safe in America for the nearly hopeless slave, nor forfree blacks. “Slavery is everywhere. Slavery goes everywhere.” And nowhere couldmoral power alone overthrow slavery. Not in political “parties,” nor in the“press,” nor in the “pulpit.” Slavery had built its “ramparts” so strong and sohigh, it could thus far resist all critics. This angry and bleak portrait of thewoes of his people and his country ended as only it could for a moral suasionistin the last stages of its ideological grip. Douglass turned to sentimentalappeals to natural rights, argued that proslavery forces, however impregnable,could ultimately not resist the truth, then steadfastly declared himself still aman of peace and that he had never “stirred up warlike feelings while abroad,”as his accusers had claimed. Just as he seemed to demonstrate a new degree ofradicalism and authenticity, Douglass retreated into an earnest Garrisonianism.He had skipped over Jeremiah’s chastisement of those who had declared, “Peace,Peace, where there is no peace.”6 [notes.html#ch11fn_6a] Douglass had not quiteyet achieved his full prophetic voice.All of these ideas and arguments, while not new, were now a swirling set ofconflicts in Douglass’s mind, packaged in an angry voice that made him, as hewished, the target of a backlash. Some responses to his Broadway Tabernacleperformance were positive, but many were hostile. The poet John GreenleafWhittier thought Douglass had been too harsh, but considered the speech a “noblerefutation of the charge of the natural inferiority urged against the coloredman.” But anti-abolition papers such as the New York Sun condemned the speech as“unmitigated abuse heaped on our country by the colored man Douglass.” A groupof Baltimore slaveholders published Douglass’s speech in a pamphlet, distributedas a means of demonstrating the dangers of abolitionism. And a letter writer inthe Boston Post reacted by labeling Douglass the new “demagogue in black.”7[notes.html#ch11fn_7a] Douglass was delighted to have caused such fear among hisenemies, and especially to be reprinted in Baltimore! The angry young man whohad stepped off the ship from Britain was ready for battle.Notoriety, however, was a double-edged sword. Within a week of the New Yorkspeech, Douglass shot back at the Sun’s racist editor in a public letter toThomas Van Rensselaer, editor of the black paper the Ram’s Horn, published inNew York. Announcing that he sought “a little . . . sport” at the expense of theSun’s editor, Douglass thanked him for calling him “colored” and not “nigger,” a“man” and not for once a “monkey.” Then he returned the ridicule with palpableglee. To the accusation that one ought not enjoy an invitation “into agentleman’s house, accept his hospitality, yet ABUSE his fare,” nor “abuse acountry under whose government” one is “securely protected,” Douglass reveled inthe irony. As a black man in this American house he found an unsavory bill offare: “He asks the cook for soup, he gets dish water. For salmon he gets aserpent; for beef, he gets bull frogs; for ducks, he gets gall.” Leaving thosemetaphors to fester, Douglass called the nation’s “Bill of Rights . . . towardsus a bill of wrongs. Its self-evident truths are self-evident lies.” Douglassannounced that he would not provide peace where there was no peace: “The harmonyof this country is discord with the ALMIGHTY.”8 [notes.html#ch11fn_8a]But he had an even more difficult accusation to thwart. While traveling with oneof the Mott sisters on a steamer down the Hudson River from Albany to New York(after he and Anna had visited Rosetta) for the AASS meeting, Douglass sleptovernight in a stateroom that adjoined his traveling companion’s room by acommon door. When the captain discovered the arrangement, he threatened Douglasswith racist epithets and worse. Two newspapers, one called the Switch in Albany,and another called the Subterranean in New York, exploited the story, forcingDouglass into a public explanation. The two papers entertained their readerswith vile and lurid descriptions. Douglass was the “offensive creature” and the“Sambo” who walked “cheek by jowl” with Miss Mott when they visited the New YorkState Assembly chamber in Albany. He was the “soot head” and the “wool head,”and white New Yorkers had been “gratifying their morbid tastes in lionizing adisgusting, impertinent negro who styles himself Frederick Douglass.” Based onsuch stories, rumors spread, even among abolitionists, that Douglass and MissMott were “caught in bed together.” On June 7 Douglass finally wrote a publicletter to Garrison. His version of the story, a credible one, was that he facedtwo choices: to sleep out on the deck with the “dogs” since the steamer wouldnot allow him as a black man to purchase a proper cabin, or to have Miss Mottbook the room next to hers. Suffering, he said, from a “severe cold andhoarseness,” a condition he frequently confronted, Douglass chose the indooraccommodation. His statement that “a thought of its propriety or improprietynever crossed my mind” seems less believable.9 [notes.html#ch11fn_9a]In the “free, full and open explanation” he offered in the letter, Douglassdenied any improper behavior, denouncing the scandal sheets. Then, as usual,whatever the truth about his flaunting of appearances, he converted the racistpackaging of the charges into a fierce abolitionist argument against the worstelements of mid-nineteenth-century racism, some of which has never ceased insome American precincts. If he was “disgusting,” then he made the most of it.“The buzzard and the condor,” Douglass wrote, “are utterly disgusted with soundmeat,” and “a dog afflicted with hydrophobia is utterly disgusted with the sightand scent of pure cold water.” Similarly, “a white man afflicted withcolorphobia will invariably manifest . . . disgust at the sight of a respectablecolored man. Colorphobia and buzzards—mad dogs and condors—think of thesethings!” He reminded his readers of the vicious subtlety of racism as well. Hisattackers had condemned his “sauciness.” Really? he asked. “How, when, where andto whom? Not as a coachman, dressed in tinseled livery, driving some delicatewhite ladies through . . . Broadway . . . Not as a footman, on some gildedcarriage. Not as a waiter in some fashionable hotel. Not as a servant, a barber,a cook, or a steward. No I am never disgusting to the most refined Americans inany of these capacities!” Douglass turned the tide on his attackers. Whitepeople’s disgust commences “just when the colored man’s inequality is dropped,and his equality is assumed.”10 [notes.html#ch11fn_10a] This would not be thelast time Douglass used stinging analysis of racism to explain allegations abouthis private life. Nor was it the last time that white-male fears of hissexuality would burst into the press.• • •In the summer of 1847 Douglass struggled to find his feet personally andprofessionally. He spent considerable time in Lynn and suffered at least twoweeks with what he called a “severe illness” and a friend described as scarletfever. He pondered whether to launch his own newspaper, and whether to move hisfamily to western New York, or possibly to Cleveland. In late June Douglassmanaged a public explanation for why, reluctantly, he had “given up my intentionof publishing a paper for the present.” Oddly, he claimed he did not want toappear “superannuated” (older and out of touch). Appearances mattered; heworried that British philanthropy supporting his personal enterprise during theIrish famine might also be unacceptable on both sides of the ocean. But withsuch equivocations, it was amply clear that Douglass saw the printing press,should he buy it, as a “gift to my race.” While Garrison and his “Boston Board”of leadership discouraged their protégé from launching a competitive newspaper,some readers of the Liberator were supportive of the idea, one of them evenaccusing the Garrisonians of “selfish considerations” in their hostility.11[notes.html#ch11fn_11a] Douglass’s desire to become a black newspaperman couldnot be restrained.To keep emotional stress and the future at bay, Douglass sought out the oneplace he knew best—the lecture circuit. By mid-July, he assured Garrisonprivately that he did not feel “hemmed in on every side . . . subjected to theBoston Board,” a statement at best only half true.12 [notes.html#ch11fn_12a]Soon he eagerly joined a group of black abolitionists, including Remond, SamuelRinggold Ward, and Henry Highland Garnet, touring across upstate New York. Hespoke especially at a West Indian emancipation celebration on August 2, inCanandaigua, which included well over a thousand blacks in an outdoor setting.After local bands and choirs performed, Douglass was the first orator of theday; he delivered an extraordinary lecture on the ancient history of slavery, onthe Atlantic slave trade, and especially on the British antislavery movement.For an outdoor festival with thousands seeking shade on a hot summer day, thespeech was quite a learned effort. He named at least twenty-three Britishabolitionists and paid warm tributes especially to William Wilberforce andThomas Clarkson. He reminded auditors that all civilizations had enslaved otherpeoples throughout history. Using Revelation 13:10, he cautioned, “He thatleadeth into captivity, shall go into captivity.” Douglass offered a compellingnarration of the capture of African slaves by European traders, the complicityof the African “Prince” in the sale, and the “grim death and desolation” of theslave ships. He gave instruction on the meaning of the Somerset case of 1772,which made Britain free soil for slaves arriving from abroad, and ended with aprolonged argument for human progress marked by British emancipation, for God asthe ultimate arbiter of history, and for the eternal need for “fanaticaldreamers” to push history to higher moral ground.13 [notes.html#ch11fn_13a]Douglass thus demonstrated that he was hardly the one-topic preacher of the“Slaveholder’s Sermon.” He was a reader. And by naming all those Britishabolitionists, he claimed their lineage.Within the following week, with no visit to the family in Lynn, Douglass met upwith Garrison for a “far West” speaking tour that would be the last great effortthese two radicals would make together. They started in Philadelphia withrefurbished energy and high hopes. They soon found inspired audiences as well asreinvigorated mobs determined to disrupt or destroy them. These were exuberanttimes for abolitionism. Garrison’s organization needed money, the Americanpopulation was spreading westward in leaps and bounds, and Ohio especially hademerged as the new antislavery battleground. The AASS had established afledgling newspaper in Salem, Ohio, the Bugle, and the indefatigable AbbyKelley, along with her husband, Stephen Foster, and others, had laid themoral-suasionist groundwork in the booming Midwest.14 [notes.html#ch11fn_14a]Image [../images/f0184-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, May 1848. Daguerreotype. Edward White Gallery, New York.The nation strained under a war in Mexico that most abolitionists condemned asproslavery aggression, and over which the political parties began to fray attheir seams. Debate also raged over the Wilmot Proviso, a welcome resolutioneven to nonpolitical abolitionists (although it never passed Congress), whichwould have denied slavery any foothold in new states gained from the MexicanWar. Manifest Destiny, war against a foreign “race,” boundless expansion, and arenewed national debate over the future of slavery seemed to offer propitiousprospects for radical reformers about to barnstorm into the thriving farming andmarket towns of the Old Northwest.15 [notes.html#ch11fn_15a]Garrison established at least two strategic themes for the tour—“comeouterism”and “disunion.” The first was the appeal that all right-thinking abolitionistsshould disavow any allegiances to proslavery churches. Comeouters, ordenominational dissenters, had for years appealed to Revelation 18:4, to “comeout” and seek a purer, more exalted Christianity. The second theme, disunion,was a more complicated, beguilingly anarchistic plea for a dissolution of theAmerican Union as the only means to end Northern complicity with slavery.Douglass always tried his best with this Garrisonian tenet by talking the talkeven when he, like many other blacks, never comprehended how to walk the walk.Disunionism was above all a test of ideological loyalty among Garrisonians. Inone of his three speeches in Philadelphia, Douglass took heart from John C.Calhoun’s increasingly steadfast rejection of any Southern compromises aboutslavery’s expansion into the West, suggesting that this might force the North toa “separation from the slave power.” “I welcome the bolt whether it come fromHeaven or from Hell, that shall sever this Union,” Douglass proclaimed as acrowd-pleaser.16 [notes.html#ch11fn_16a] But other issues now attracted himmore, especially with black audiences.In what became a common occurrence in many places with sizable free-blackpopulations, the famous Mother Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church ofPhiladelphia held a special event in Douglass’s honor on August 6, 1847.Douglass donned his black leader’s hat and reveled in the moment. He called hisrole as black representative a “religious duty” of the “sweetest enjoyment.”Ideological purity hardly mattered here in the packed pews of Mother Bethel.What did matter was community survival, solidarity, and uplift. “I am one withyou,” the orator assured the flock, “one in position—one in the estimate of thewhites—one in the effort to gain our rights and true social condition. I feelentitled from this oneness to be heard as to what you and I should do to securethe rights which have been robbed from us.” Then he called them to greater unityand community self-help. According to press reports, Douglass left the MotherBethel congregation in “tears” and “laughter.”17 [notes.html#ch11fn_17a] Somenights, as he fell with weariness on a stranger’s spare bed or sofa, or if luckyin a private room of an inn, Douglass must have felt special pride in theseencounters with so many former fugitive slaves and free-black compatriots. Hehad, after all, begun his orator’s career in front of an AME congregation.But such joys were always short-lived. Before leaving Pennsylvania, Douglass andGarrison faced vicious mobs reminiscent of the early 1840s on the One HundredConventions tour. Radical abolitionists were generally widely feared and hated,but Douglass, his fame now spreading in advance of every appearance, was aspecial target. As they moved west, Garrison and Douglass held a gathering inthe courthouse at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. Garrison made it through a one-hourspeech undisturbed, but only minutes after Douglass took the floor a mob beganhurling rotten eggs and all manner of stones and brickbats through the windowsand the door while shouting their practiced refrain, “Throw out the nigger!”Douglass tried to carry on, but as eggs smashed into Garrison’s head and a stonegrazed Douglass’s own face, the meeting broke up in chaos. With the mobscreaming, “Let the damned nigger have it!,” and the room filling up with whathe called “slavery’s choice incense,” Douglass locked arms with a small group ofblack men who provided a protective escort out of the building.18[notes.html#ch11fn_18a]The fearless reformers stayed on two more days in Harrisburg, where theyaddressed the local Colored Methodist Church. “A more interesting array of facesI have seldom looked upon,” Douglass warmly reported. He was especially moved bythe women of the congregation, who were so well turned out and in charge of abenevolent society for self-improvement they had named the Douglass Union. Butafter the train stopped in Chambersburg to switch the passengers to a stagecoachfor the long journey over the Allegheny Mountains to Pittsburgh, Garrison’sticket had to be reissued for the following day as Douglass traveled on alone.For the next two days and nights through mountain passes and small villages,Douglass encountered what he called “brutal insults and outrages.” He was deniedfood along the journey, spending forty-eight hours without a meal. Discouragedand hungry, he arrived in Pittsburgh to a welcome by a local brass band andhandshakes from the local black lawyer John Vashon. These kinds of pitifulironies—a hero in small black communities one day and the object of racistattacks and humiliations the next—now formed a way of life for this young symbolof abolitionism. Before leaving the Pittsburgh area, Douglass rejoiced thatamong the black delegation he met the enormously talented “noble specimen of aman” Martin R. Delany.19 [notes.html#ch11fn_19a] Within four months the two menwould collaborate to create a newspaper. Douglass’s ambitions were as expansiveas his courage.By mid-August, via steamboats, canal barges, coaches, and the occasional slowtrain, the western tour surged into Ohio, attracting growing outdoor gatheringsunlike any other American abolition had ever seen. Douglass mustered a sense ofhumor about the hardships of travel in this crusade of retail radicalism: “Weare carried by horses, fed by corn instead of fire—bone instead of iron.” Peoplecame in wagons and on horseback from many miles around to festival-like meetingsfrom Ashtabula to Youngstown, Massillon to Leesburg, Salem to Munson. They hadtapped into the grass roots of the free-labor militancy and Christian idealismof the Western Reserve. Many of these revivalist assemblages grew to betweenthree thousand and six thousand people. As Douglass announced to a colleague,“It was pleasant to see our cause look popular for once.” Douglass wasespecially impressed with the women who played such key roles in organizingthese events and with those such as Lucretia Mott and Abby Kelley who took tothe rostrum as speakers.20 [notes.html#ch11fn_20a]As the salvation show moved across the Midwestern farmland, some of thesemeetings took place in the great Oberlin Tent. A thousand feet in diameter, thetent could hold up to five thousand people. This structure, spread out on arural Midwestern landscape, surrounded by booths, covered wagons by thehundreds, and the “auctioneering,” as Douglass put it, of a grand antislaveryfair, was a sight never to be forgotten. The Boston abolitionists called thegreat tent, constructed at the abolitionist college town in northern Ohio, theportable Faneuil Hall. After local choirs sang an audience into joyousexpectations, Douglass and Garrison would step up on a platform and try toproject to the outer edges of the tent flaps. They preached about the usualtopics, as well as the dreams of the fugitives passing through northeasternOhio. They inveighed against Ohio’s notorious “black laws,” the manydiscriminatory statutes still on the books that prescribed the political, civil,and educational lives of free African Americans. Douglass especially continuedhis embittered critique of an American promise gone wrong, stymied and poisonedby slavery, racism, and complacency even out on these fertile prairies whereimmigrants and New Englanders had gone for renewal. Sometimes, as theGarrisonian Samuel May reported, audiences “winced” at Douglass’s ridicule ofthe nation’s religious and political life.21 [notes.html#ch11fn_21a]But it was not easy performing the role of twenty-nine-year-old hero-prophet.Both men became worn-out and ill. Douglass repeatedly suffered from his “oldthroat complaint,” and often could “hardly make himself heard.” By the time theyreached Youngstown, as Garrison reported, Douglass was “entirely exhausted andvoiceless.” He would sometimes appear with a damp cloth tied around his throat.After rising on a makeshift platform to tremendous cheers, his voice would creakand crack. Garrison fared even worse under the punishing schedule. By Septemberhe fell extremely ill, leaving the tour and remaining debilitated and at timesin delirium in Cleveland with what may have been typhoid fever. Douglass surgedon without him. Garrison eventually recovered and returned to Boston in autumn,but not before the entire antislavery community wondered if the western tourmight be the death of him.22 [notes.html#ch11fn_22a]Douglass continued the tour back into western New York, holding meetings acrossthe state from Buffalo to Rochester to Syracuse. He repeatedly visited postoffices trying to get some word of Garrison’s health. This issue became oneamong many matters of strain and dispute later, with Garrison claiming that hisprotégé had left him behind and had not even inquired about his well-being. Theslow but certain parting of ways of the two abolitionists soon reached an acutestage as Douglass reversed himself and decided to found his own newspaper. Stillin Cleveland in late October 1847, but finally recovering from his illness,Garrison wrote a long letter to his wife, Helen, ending with an embittered PS:“Is it not strange that Douglass has not written a single line to me, or to anyone, inquiring after my health, since he left me on a bed of illness?” Butworse, the weakened mentor felt silently rebuked and betrayed about thenewspaper: “He never opened to me his lips on the subject,” wrote Garrison, “norasked my advice in any particular whatsoever. Such conduct grieves me to theheart.” The Liberator’s founder had opposed Douglass’s independent venture,which the young editor called the North Star, from the very inception of theidea; Garrison vowed that it “must be met with firmness,” and he intended todetermine who was “at the bottom of all of this.”23 [notes.html#ch11fn_23a]Douglass had challenged the house of Garrison, which had formed and nurturedhim, but could no longer fully contain his ambitions.On the western tour, Douglass had laid the groundwork for the venture,especially by enlisting Martin Delany as a coeditor and connecting once againwith his friends Amy and Isaac Post in Rochester. He also enlisted the blackGarrisonian William Cooper Nell to join him as publisher, and John Dick, anEnglishman who would relocate to Rochester to be Douglass’s printer. Beforereturning home finally to Lynn in October, Douglass spent four days in Albanyand Troy, New York, where he participated among the sixty-six delegates at aNational Colored Convention. Albany was a rough town, where Douglass yet againendured racist attacks, much of which he attributed to the “flood of immoralityand disgusting brutality” arriving via the Erie Canal. Among the resolutionspassed at the convention was one to create a “national press” for blacks.Tellingly, Douglass abstained on the resolution, knowing that he was about toannounce his own paper, and holding his cards close to his chest.24[notes.html#ch11fn_24a]Image [../images/f0189-01.jpg]William Lloyd Garrison, c. 1851. Daguerreotype. Albert Sands Southworth andJosiah John Hawes photographers.From the day he launched the idea of becoming an independent journalist, so muchdepended on his British benefactors. Some of them, especially Englishwomen whowrote to Maria Weston Chapman at the AASS office regaling her with how much they“loved,” were “inspired by,” or felt “deeply attached to” Frederick, had spilledthe beans about the newspaper at the very headquarters of Garrisonianism.Nothing fired Chapman’s ready suspicion about Douglass’s evolving apostasy morethan those adoring messages from British women. Chapman was, after all, tryingto raise money for the Liberator from these same women. Douglass did not tellGarrison himself about his new intentions, a problem common in strainedfather-and-son-like relationships. The AASS had made it possible for Douglass towrite his regular letters and columns in the National Anti-Slavery Standard,hoping that this would satisfy his desires in journalism.25[notes.html#ch11fn_25a] But nothing could stop Douglass’s quest to launch thisnew chapter in the making of his voice.Douglass repeatedly said that he wanted to have his own enterprise as amouthpiece for his race. But in a letter to his English friend Julia Griffiths,he revealed the deeper well of his ambition. With the help of numerous Britishcomrades, many of whom Douglass named, Julia had sent Frederick a large“collection of books, pamphlets, tracts, and pictures,” all to aid him on hisjourney to journalism. Griffiths’s father, Thomas, a printer and publisher, hadbeen one of the organizers of the farewell soiree for Douglass in London, anevent Julia had attended with her sister, Eliza. Douglass was deeply moved bythe gift, but even in this tender note of gratitude he remained theautobiographer watching his own life: “You will the more readily understand mypleasure at receiving such a gift when I tell you that but a few years ago, thefingers now penning this note of thanks, were used in fishing from the muddystreet gutters in Baltimore, scattered pages of the Bible.” Douglass conductedhis public quest to destroy slavery and to be somebody with an eye almost alwayssquinting in a backward glance to the Eastern Shore. “What a contrast is mypresent with my former condition. Then a slave, now a free man; then degraded,now respected; then ignorant . . . my name unheard of beyond the limits of arepublican slave plantation; now my friends and benefactors, people of bothhemispheres, to heaven the praise belongs!”26 [notes.html#ch11fn_26a] Within ayear and a half Julia herself would join Douglass’s newspaper enterprise.By late October Douglass was “buying type and all the little &c.s of a printingestablishment,” as he informed Amy Post. British money kept flowing into Lynn ina timely fashion; he acknowledged a generous draft for £445 from Jonathan D.Carr, a successful Quaker biscuit manufacturer in Carlisle, who served as atreasurer among the Douglass fund-raising network in England. Douglass named thepaper the North Star and in November moved to Rochester, a thriving city offifty thousand, a hub on the Erie Canal, and a significant haven for fugitiveslaves on their way to Canada. He rented an office in the Talman Building at 25Buffalo Street, in the heart of the business district. Until February 1848, heboarded with Charles Joiner, a local black clothes cleaner, leaving his familyback in Lynn. Once again, Anna and the children waited for the next disruptionin their lives. Douglass plowed all of his money into the North Star, buying aprinting press, which proved faulty. He repeatedly took on debt to keep thepaper afloat during its first uncertain year. But the first issue came out onDecember 3, 1847, and Douglass made it clear that he was a politicalabolitionist in the making. In an open letter to the Whig Party leader, HenryClay, Douglass unleashed a fierce attack on the Kentuckian’s alleged moderationas a slaveholder. Clay, according to the new editor, was the worst of allthings—a well-meaning slaveholder—and his alleged “benevolence” merely “so muchof Satan dressed in the livery of Heaven.”27 [notes.html#ch11fn_27a]Douglass launched the North Star with great exuberance, and though it spoke for“Liberty, Humanity, and Progress,” as he stated in the opening prospectus, thepaper was to be a proud black enterprise. It would do what “it would be whollyimpossible for our white friends to do for us.” The four earlier black-editedpapers had all been short-lived. “Our race must be vindicated from theembarrassing implications resulting from former non-success,” Douglassannounced. In a separate plea written directly to black readers, he promised toattack slavery in the South and racism in the North with equal fervor. He wouldoffer himself as their voice assailing the “ramparts of Slavery and Prejudice.”He further promised to advocate for rights, but also to chastise his fellowblacks when necessary about their obligations and failures. Above all he offeredhimself as model, “one with you,” having “writhed beneath the bloody lash” and“under the slander of inferiority.” He would vehemently promote learning in allits forms, but “accord most merit to those who have labored hardest, andovercome most in . . . pursuit of knowledge.”28 [notes.html#ch11fn_28a] This wasa black paper edited by a former slave! Irony was often Douglass’s principalrhetorical weapon; now he boldly offered himself as its very embodiment.He had taken a great risk. Douglass did not yet know how to edit a newspaper.Delany had some experience, sporadically editing his own Mystery (which ended inearly 1847) in Pittsburgh, but his role was to go on the road all over the Northto solicit subscriptions in black communities. When the printing press provedineffective, Douglass had to hire out the printing to William Clough, one floorabove the North Star’s office, for approximately $20 weekly. This fledglingoperation stumbled along into 1848; subscriptions grew to approximately sevenhundred by mid-January, with papers eventually sent before year’s end toBritain, Canada, Mexico, Australia, and even parts of the South. In December,Douglass received a warm letter of support from Gerrit Smith, the wealthyupstate New York abolitionist, containing $5 for a two-year subscription, andsignaling the beginning of an important long-term relationship with the richpolitical activist. Frustratingly, however, only handfuls of blacks took thepaper, although Douglass did receive accolades from some fellow blackabolitionists and friends. One of them, William Cooper Nell, worked hard for theNorth Star, but he struggled with his conflicted loyalties to Garrison and theLiberator.29 [notes.html#ch11fn_29a]Delany, on the other hand, traveled widely on a “western tour” of free blackcommunities during 1848, soliciting readers and subscriptions as well as writinga remarkable array of travel letters published in the paper. It has often beenassumed that the Douglass-Delany partnership, because they soon severed ties andeventually became ideological rivals, crippled the North Star in its firstyears. But Delany’s literary output for Douglass’s paper left an important mark.Frustrations abounded, however, between the two men. In mid-January 1848,Douglass seemed frantic to know Delany’s whereabouts, complaining about$55-per-week expenses, slow growth in subscriptions, and going to press yet“again much to my regret without a single line from your pen.” A week laterDouglass did receive the first of twenty-three public letters Delany wouldproduce over the next thirteen months from such “western” cities as Pittsburgh,Columbus, Cincinnati, Cleveland, and Detroit. As Douglass wrote every week forthe paper, while constantly running around upstate New York to lecture for feesthat helped pay bills, Delany visited schools, churches, fraternal orders, andcourtrooms in small communities across the Midwest, reporting back a kind ofethnography about the needs for “elevation” among the very people he andDouglass were trying to attract into their readership. Still, few boughtsubscriptions, leaving Douglass discouraged about the “uphill” task before themas he did “all I can by lectures and letters to keep our heads above thewater.”30 [notes.html#ch11fn_30a]Whether Douglass and Delany were ever really “co-editors,” as the mastheadclaimed, is doubtful. The two men hailed from quite different backgrounds. Bornfree in western Virginia, educated at the Harvard Medical School, Delany was sixyears older than Douglass and did not fit well as a subordinate partner. Theyhad lived different lives; Delany was much darker than the lead editor and knewthat all of his grandparents were African. But for a while they sustained aneffective collaboration. In the spring and summer of 1848, Delany’s letters fromPennsylvania and Ohio maintained a steady drumbeat for black self-improvement, atheme Douglass himself championed. They saw themselves as preceptors of blackuplift within a rigidly racist society.“Colored People!” Delany proclaimed, “we want more businessmen among us;farmers, mechanics and tradesmen. . . . Let our people put their children—firstto school, next to trades.” All over growing Ohio he spotted “respectable andpraiseworthy” black families and was especially taken with the “cleanliness” ofthe cottages in the town of Hamilton. Douglass wrote a stinging editorial inJuly, “What Are the Colored People Doing for Themselves,” in which he proddedblacks to higher attainments of “being honest, industrious, sober andintelligent,” as he also berated them for not subscribing to his newspaper. Ahectoring Douglass complained that free blacks might attend an Odd Fellows or aFreemason convention by the thousands but could not stoop to read his paper. Hebashed black preachers and churches for filling their pews on Sundays but not“meddling with abolitionism” on weekdays. He wanted his people to “read . . .speak and write,” and then to act. “What is the use of standing a man on hisfeet,” declared the discouraged editor, “if when we let him go, his head isagain brought to the pavement?” In what served as a motto of his own early life,Douglass shouted from the page, “For the want of knowledge we are killed allday!” With equally potent zeal, Delany preached from the same text in Midwesterndepots such as Chillicothe and Cyrus Settlement.31 [notes.html#ch11fn_31a]Image [../images/f0193-01.jpg]Martin R. Delany, 1860s.But both men too kept up a constant exposure of the racist mob violence thatDelany encountered on the road, and which Douglass knew all too well. They alsolevied an embittered critique of the black laws that barred free blacks fromcourts of law, civic life, or the ballot box. As it limped from week to week,the North Star became both a repository and a trumpet for the great dual causeof black abolitionism—internal community self-improvement and the external questfor citizenship. And it was a presidential election year; Douglass made sure theNorth Star kept one eye on the broiling issue of slavery expansion animatingnational politics.32 [notes.html#ch11fn_32a] Despite his financial worries, thateditor’s desk forced Douglass to think more broadly about the power and limitsof words, and the nature of antislavery activism.In this frenzied time, Douglass went back to Lynn and moved his family toRochester in February 1848. The move was difficult for Anna; she had made a lifefor herself in Lynn, as a mother, a shoe binder, and seamstress who had livedmore months without her husband than with him over the past six years. What sheknew and understood of Frederick’s world of ideas, friends, travels, andexperiences she had processed through protective psychological barriers. Thistalented domestic woman, who remained illiterate next to the man made andsustained by words, packed up her three boys (Rosetta remained in Albany withher governesses, the Mott sisters) and trekked across Massachusetts and upstateNew York to a small tenement in downtown Rochester. Isaac Post helped to securethe apartment. But no wonder Douglass wrote to the Mott sisters just after thefamily’s move complaining of his “gloomy” circumstances. He was a “most unhappyman,” he confessed. His “house hunting” floundered and Anna had “not beenwell—or very good humored since we came here.” Douglass often unloaded hispersonal woes in letters to his best women friends, many of whom seemedthoroughly willing to perform as his sounding board. He missed those “words oflove and sympathy” the Motts might provide him. He missed Rosetta and wished shewould write to him more so he could “see her hand writing.” And the travails ofhis lecturing travels weighed on him. “This riding all night is killing me,” hemoaned.33 [notes.html#ch11fn_33a]In April the Douglasses purchased a house from a local abolitionist at 4Alexander Street. The two-story, nine-room brick dwelling had a front porchwhere Anna could put a rocker and a yard for a garden as spring arrived.Upstairs, Douglass had a study with a table, books, and a “list of the words hefound it hard to spell,” as a neighbor reported. The children entered schoolsand Anna likely made some connections with the small black community of some 162households in Rochester. All was not sour in the Douglasses’ marriage; thatsummer they conceived their fifth child. In a personal reminiscence written in1917, the youngest son, Charles, recalled a rosy, sentimental homestead atAlexander Street, where he and his brothers attended common schools but wereincreasingly “taken from school one day in each week to deliver the paper tolocal subscribers,” or to learn typesetting. Charles believed the North Starsurvived as a collective family enterprise: “To maintain this paper, everyeffort was put forth by every member of the family to keep it alive.”34[notes.html#ch11fn_34a]But life on Alexander Street and getting out the paper on Buffalo Street weremuch more complex matters. Douglass never had enough money in these years andwould soon have to mortgage his house again to pay his staff at the newspaper.In late April he wrote to Julia Griffiths that he was struggling to “find thebright side of the future.” He worried openly that he might have “undertakenmore than I have the ability to perform.” He feared he had “miscalculated . . .the amount of support which would be extended to my enterprise.” In this cry forhelp Douglass complained that Delany had not done enough to raise subscriptions,leaving the editor alone doing everything. He confessed that he had “expendedmore than the some [sic] sent me from England, and shall require sixty dollarsper week for six months to come in order to keep my paper a float.”35[notes.html#ch11fn_35a] Douglass dearly needed help. Griffiths, who wrote to himfrequently and sent him leading British newspapers, heard his cry. She visitedhim in Rochester for a short time later that fall, steadied his spirits, and ayear later, in May 1849, making an extraordinary commitment, relocated toAmerica and helped the North Star, and Frederick himself, survive into the1850s.Douglass’s maintenance of an equilibrium amid all these pressures of home andhis own ambition defied the odds. In part, he managed from month to monthbecause of Anna’s steadfast care for the children and the hearth; she was hisultimate “helpmeet,” as he admitted many times. The family stood waiting thereon each of his homecomings, and the North Star was theirs as well. Douglasssustained his inner psychological standing in part by the sheer force of willand what he called his “pen and tongue.” That he managed to keep the North Staralive through those first years is a testament to his stamina and his growingfelicity with the short essay. He had established himself as a world-classorator. But the newspaper now became his reason to be. The North Star “shalllive” or “must be sustained,” he would often say, not as a mere expression ofbusiness enterprise, but for his own sheer existence. The paper became, as helater recalled, the “motive power” of his life. Douglass tested his ideas andbegan to grasp the landscape of politics through the lens of the North Star. “Itwas the best school possible for me,” he wrote. “It obliged me to think andread, it taught me to express my thoughts clearly.” He had to produce the wordsthat were both burden and liberation. “I had an audience to speak to every week,and must say something worth their hearing or cease to speak altogether.”Douglass relished what he called his editor’s “sting of necessity,” and hisevolving voice became both more pragmatic and more radical as it became morepolitical.36 [notes.html#ch11fn_36a]That summer of 1848, Douglass made one of his big strides into the politics ofreform by supporting women’s rights and participating at the Seneca Fallsconvention on July 19–20. The idea for such a convention had longed brewed amongfeminists and women’s rights advocates. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who lived inSeneca Falls, and a group of Quaker women gathered around Mary Ann M’Clintockand her two daughters, Mary Ann and Elizabeth, in Waterloo, New York, along withthe skillful aid of Lucretia Mott, put out a call for a convention in the SenecaCounty Courier on July 11. Douglass responded immediately by running the appealin the North Star on July 14. Some three hundred people attended the two-dayhistoric assembly in the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel of Seneca Falls. Douglasseagerly joined his Rochester friend Amy Post at the convention. The gatheringwas largely local with attendees coming mainly from the upstate region. Somehusbands of these women reformers, as well as other male abolitionists,attended, but most did not. Issues of women’s place, much less equal rights, hadlong been lightning rods in the antislavery movement in Britain and the UnitedStates.37 [notes.html#ch11fn_37a]But Douglass never exhibited any ambiguity or caution. His many women friendshad taught him much. The convention famously produced a “Declaration ofSentiments,” modeled directly on the Declaration of Independence. With the wordwomen inserted (“all men and women are created equal”) where appropriate, themore than a dozen resolutions accompanying the document covered all manner ofdemands for equality in jobs, in courts of law, in family relations, religion,and education. All resolutions passed unanimously except the controversial claimfor the elective franchise. So contested was the issue of voting that many womenleaders, such as Lucretia Mott, refused to support it, fearing they would losethe ultimate hope of gaining any rights because of this demand. But during theafternoon debate of the second day’s meeting, Douglass forcefully endorsed fullwomen’s suffrage, which may have helped win the day in a divided vote. In hisNorth Star report about Seneca Falls, Douglass expressed great pride atparticipating and called the demands “simple justice.” He freely admitted thatall in favor of women’s equality courted “ridicule . . . fury and bigotry.” Buthe did not equivocate. Civil society had been deprived too long of the labor andtalent of half the human family, he said. “There can be no reason in the worldfor denying to woman the exercise of the elective franchise.” Douglass was theonly black person attending the Seneca Falls convention, and it remained amatter of lifetime pride that he was among the thirty-two men and sixty-eightwomen who signed the “Declaration of Sentiments.” He would always be delightedto be called “a women’s rights man.” The motto on the masthead of the NorthStar, “Right is of No Color and No Sex,” had been no mere sentiment.38[notes.html#ch11fn_38a]Throughout 1848, Douglass took an ever-keener interest in national politics,even as he managed still to denounce the corruptions of parties. One Douglassbiographer sees the editor’s overall North Star prose style as “rather solemnlypolemical,” while another points to his love of “irony, humor and ambiguity” andtherefore a prose that “sounded more genteel.”39 [notes.html#ch11fn_39a] Neitheris wrong, but it is hard to miss how Douglass’s journalistic as well asoratorical voice in these years sounded furious and militant as he became morepolitical. His rhetoric carried more Old Testament pain and rage; Jeremiahcaught a second wind. He took up the editor’s pen to provoke his readers intoaction. The humor and entertainment of the lecture hall gave way to opinion andthe persuasiveness of the editorial. To that person who had called him the“demagogue in black,” it was as if Douglass responded by saying something likeThank you; if you want a demagogue, I will give you a demagogue. His modeljournalist, after all, was William Lloyd Garrison.Douglass read widely in the national and the British press about the republicanrevolutions breaking out all over Europe, especially in France in February andMarch 1848. He took heart as monarchy and slavery in the French empire cameunder assault from a movement of universal egalitarianism. “We live in stirringtimes and amid thrilling events,” he told an audience at a West Indianemancipation celebration in Rochester on August 1. Brandishing historicaldetail, he turned a shared identity with the French proletariat back onto the“atrocious wickedness” of American slavery. While Europeans strove to freethemselves from centuries of tyranny, Americans could only mouth awkwardhalf-truths of support, and voters could only choose between “tyrants andmen-stealers to rule over us.”40 [notes.html#ch11fn_40a]In revolutionary times, Douglass concluded, “some lives may indeed be lost.” Inpublic he frequently invoked the memory of Nat Turner as a noble slave rebel tocompare to the French, Germans, and Italians at their barricades, gunned down inthe streets. Douglass now mixed this early embrace of violent means with one ofhis favorite tactics—heaping blame on white Northerners for their complicitywith slavery. In a speech in Faneuil Hall in Boston, he told his friendlyauditors, “You are the enslavers of my southern brethren and sisters.” By theirparticipation under the US Constitution, he similarly charged the Rochesterthrong on August 1 with bringing the “bristling bayonets of the whole militarypower of the nation” down on the lives of slaves. Had not Nat Turner, Douglassintoned, only acted with the “self-same means which the Revolutionary fathersemployed?” Those Rochester journalists who remarked about the “sarcastic tones”and the “bitterness” of Douglass’s public rhetoric had heard him loud andclear.41 [notes.html#ch11fn_41a]Douglass also pulled the story back within the human heart. On September 3,1848, the tenth anniversary of his escape from slavery, he published a publicletter to his former master, Thomas Auld. The letter is a masterpiece ofantislavery propaganda as well as an expression of personal rage. Although themissive contained some inaccuracies—especially the accusation that Auld hadabandoned Betsy Bailey out to fields to fend for herself or die—which Douglasslater had to recant, Auld’s former property boldly put his old master to hisservice. With Auld as his model, Douglass flayed every slaveholder who had everlifted a lash or sold a human being. This was Douglass’s personal symbolicwhipping of Auld and an indictment in front of a jury of history. The chosentool of punishment was the pen.42 [notes.html#ch11fn_42a]Douglass had many times used Auld as the “slaveholder” in speeches, especiallywhen exposing the religious hypocrisy of Southern Methodists. Now, Douglassaddressed him directly by name and dared him not to listen. The letter is funny,falsely and formally delicate, and at times quite moving. A Douglass biographerhas contended that the letter is “one of the strangest pieces in the literatureof American slavery” because of its “peculiar distortions.” But accuracy is notthe best measure of the letter. Douglass sought new recruits for the abolitioncause and readers for the North Star. He hit some new notes as he settled someold scores. He played with Auld, offering a justification for invading the“proprieties of private life” in his former owner’s quiet corner of the EasternShore. “I will not manifest ill temper by calling you hard names,” he assuredAuld. But he also made his intent explicit: “I intend to make use of you as aweapon with which to assail the system of slavery.” Douglass did flail about abit; but he landed many reverberating blows. He prompted angry responses to thehumiliation of Auld from as far away as a slaveholder in Georgia who wrote, “Asemancipationists you colored fellows are the worst. . . . As well may the dogclaim to be a man, as the negro a free man and equal among those that Goddesigned to be his superior. The order of nature can be as soon reverted to anygood in the one case as in the other.”43 [notes.html#ch11fn_43a]In addressing Auld, Douglass lectured him about the natural right toself-ownership: “I am myself; you are yourself; we are two distinct persons,equal persons. What you are I am. . . . God created both, and made us separatebeings. I am not by nature bound to you, or you to me. Nature does not make yourexistence depend upon me, or mine to depend upon yours.” Douglass especiallyused Auld to demonstrate how far his slave had risen, how he had created afamily, how he had made the successful “transition from degradation torespectability.” He pointed to his comfortable house, his “industrious and neat”wife, his “four dear children,” three of whom were in school. Then, by contrast,in the most moving lines of the letter, he wrenched his readers into slavery’sdomestic heart of darkness: “They [the children] are all in comfortable beds,and are sound asleep, perfectly secure under my roof. There are no slaveholdershere to rend my heart by snatching them from my arms, or blast a mother’sdearest hopes by tearing them from her bosom.” Here, Douglass’s rage againstslavery found its outlet: “Oh! Sir, a slaveholder never appears to me socompletely an agent of hell, as when I think of and look upon my dear children.It is then that my feelings rise above my control.”44 [notes.html#ch11fn_44a]Mercilessly, Douglass dragged Auld back into their shared history, with thetides turned: “Say not that this is a picture of fancy. You well know that Iwear stripes on my back inflicted by your direction; and that you, while we werebrothers in the same church, caused this right hand, with which I am now penningthis letter, to be closely tied to my left, and my person dragged at thepistol’s mouth, fifteen miles, from the Bay side to Easton to be sold like abeast in the market.”45 [notes.html#ch11fn_45a] Douglass avoids how Auld did notsell him south, but sent him back to Baltimore. In 1848 the facts were alignedthus for a reason. A liberated Douglass, man of letters, must still be seenthrough the lens of the manacled Fred Bailey. He loved the reversal and reworkedhis story on Auld’s back.The letter to Auld was a public humiliation, a symbolic indictment of all thethousands of white slaveholding “fathers” through the years. Douglass demands toknow from Auld whether he had sold his sisters. He even insists that his formerowner imagine Douglass invading Auld’s St. Michaels house, kidnapping his owndaughter, Amanda, and selling her to the “brutal lust of fiendish overseers.”Although there was no evidence that Auld had ever broken up families or soldaway Frederick’s female kin, Douglass used the letter as a defense of the virtueof black womanhood.46 [notes.html#ch11fn_46a] In Douglass’s innuendo about therape of his mother, and in trading on slavery’s sexual nightmares, as well asthe mystery of his own paternity, he gave to antislavery literature this barelycontrolled eruption of human rage.• • •The North Star had to get written, edited, and printed every week. The nation’sevolving crisis over slavery’s expansion in the wake of the Mexican War, andespecially the presidential election that fall, had to be explained. Douglassoften blurred the lines between his private and public alienation. The demandsof succinctness in the columns of the newspaper provided a disciplined retreatfor this man of words, barely holding on to an equipoise he only halfcomprehended. Venting on Auld and blasting the slaveholding nation became oneand the same task. In the election of 1848, Douglass supported the new Free SoilParty and its candidate, former president Martin Van Buren; Douglass evenattended its convention in Buffalo in September. But he was deeply disappointedby the election of the slaveholder war hero General Zachary Taylor. In apostelection editorial, “The Blood of the Slave on the Skirts of the NorthernPeople,” Douglass wryly apologized if he “should seem severe” or “speakharshly.” But he felt “a thousand poisonous stings” in his heart as he reflectedon the state of the Union. Douglass told white Northern voters that the “bloodof the slave is on your garments. . . . You have said that slavery is betterthan freedom—that war is better than peace, and that cruelty is better thanhumanity.”47 [notes.html#ch11fn_47a]Douglass kept Jeremiah’s sword sharpened, addressing the nation as his audience:“What mean ye that ye bruise and bind my people? Will justice sleepforever? . . . Repent of this wickedness . . . by delivering the despoiled outof the hands of the despoiler.” He refused to extend peace where there was nopeace. Douglass signaled hope with the only weapon in his arsenal. Abolitionwould spring forth, he contended, “from the press and on the voice of the livingspeaker, words of burning truth, to alarm the guilty, to unmask the hypocrite,to expose the frauds of political parties, and rebuke the spirit of a corruptand sin-sustaining church.” Douglass announced, without fully knowing it, thetheme of his and the country’s life for the next decade: “Slavery will beattacked in its stronghold—the compromises of the Constitution, and the cry ofdisunion shall be more fearlessly proclaimed, till slavery be abolished, theUnion dissolved, or the sun of this guilty nation must go down in blood.”48[notes.html#ch11fn_48a]Words that burn—Douglass’s stock-in-trade. He borrowed a page from Nat Turner ashe also strove to honor the principles of Garrison. Ultimately he could not doboth. Soon, Julia Griffiths arrived from England to help him navigate thesetroubled waters."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 12--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MY FAITHFUL FRIEND JULIAMiss Griffiths . . . is industriously wielding her pen at another desk.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, MAY 21, 1851By the early 1850s Frederick Douglass underwent a terrible estrangement fromWilliam Lloyd Garrison, experienced an ideological transformation in his view ofantislavery strategy under the influence of Gerrit Smith, and to a great extentsurvived personally and professionally because of his friendship with JuliaGriffiths. It was a time of loss and new imaginings, private despair, and a newpublic-political purpose for his life. As usual, although with new extremes, hewas under attack. “Let no man hope to succeed in insulting me,” Douglassannounced on May 7, 1850, in his speech at the annual meeting of the AmericanAnti-Slavery Society in New York.1 [notes.html#ch12fn_1a] This most turbulentgathering the old organization had ever held occurred during the intense debatein Washington, DC, over the Compromise of 1850 and its notorious Fugitive SlaveAct. Fear for the Union and social order, as well as racist resistance to blackassertions of civil liberty and to abolitionism, flowed into the BroadwayTabernacle where the activists met.Some New York papers, especially the Democratic Party organ, the Herald, hadginned up great hostility and suggested violence against the AASS in advance ofthe meetings. As Garrison attempted to deliver the opening address, a mobstormed the platform, “yelling, cheering, swearing.” They were led by IsaiahRynders, a notorious gang leader and Tammany Hall boss of the Sixth Ward and theFive Points district. Profanely violent and racist, Rynders, born of Irish andGerman parents in upstate New York, was at the height of his powers in lowerManhattan’s streets and faced no resistance from the hapless New York police whoalso attended the gathering. Rynders’s gangs, known by names such as Plug Ugliesor Dead Rabbits, were particularly adept at using clubs, knives, and guns tofoment riots on behalf of some Irish interests. Notorious as a “sporting man”involved in gambling, horse racing, and boxing, Rynders was, according to onehistorian, “the nation’s foremost political thug.” But the Bible-quoting Ryndersalso possessed rhetorical skill at repartee and insult. Oddly, in the spirit offree speech, Garrison and the abolitionists invited the mob to have their say inwhat became a theater of the absurd.2 [notes.html#ch12fn_2a]A “Mr. Grant,” the orator designated by Rynders to speak for the mob, arguedthat blacks were not human but part of the monkey species and that the mixing ofblacks and whites at this assembly violated “nature . . . and nature’s God.”Many among the disoriented, pacifist abolitionists began to shout for Douglassto speak. Douglass rose to the call and held forth, although bizarrely with“Captain Rynders at his elbow,” as the press reported. At first Douglass walkedinto Rynders’s trap by making himself and racial identity the subject. Hecomplained about Grant’s inhumane claims about blacks and appealed to theaudience to look him [Douglass] in the face and at his “woolly head” and asked,“Am I not a man?” Rynders then made one of his frequent interruptions whilestanding at Douglass’s side. “You are not a black man; you are only half anigger,” fumed the ward boss. To which Douglass replied, causing roars oflaughter, “He is correct; I am, indeed, only half a negro, a half brother to Mr.Rynders.”3 [notes.html#ch12fn_3a]Douglass gave as he took in this dangerous situation, turning humiliation intohumor. Declaring himself “from the South” and a “son of a slaveholder,” Douglasssuggested that if Rynders wished to “preach against amalgamation,” he should aimat white men who wrote the laws so they could exploit their female slaves.Speaking as a black man, Douglass dared to challenge “my half brother Rynders”and all Irish immigrants, who “recently landed on these shores,” enjoyinggreater privileges than African Americans. Amidst epithets of “mongrels all,”Douglass made the case for blacks as older immigrants who had “watered the soilwith our tears, and fertilized it with our blood.” Their labor had “raised thecotton for the shirts on your backs” and “produced the sugar that sweetens yourcoffee.” Douglass had long preferred associations with a different sort ofIrish, the middle-class reformers and Quakers who had nurtured and adored him inCork or Dublin. Here, in this grotesque sport of raw American racism andantebellum identity wars, he felt empowered to exhibit his own mind and body incontrast to those of his vicious opponents. “We only want our rights,” Douglasspleaded in conclusion. “I care not whether I am descended from a man or amonkey. . . . I have a head to think, and I know God meant I should exercise theright to think. . . . I have a heart to feel, and a tongue to speak . . . andGod meant that I should use that tongue in behalf of humanity and justice forevery man.”4 [notes.html#ch12fn_4a]But Rynders’s thugs had not come for a history lecture; they had no stamina tohear a black man’s eloquent complaints. Remarkably, the two hours of disruptionand confusion ended without violence; Rynders and his mob left the hall withapparent satisfaction that they had lampooned the hated abolitionists and theirfavored black orator. Douglass, as long as he survived to tell it, seemed toenjoy having Rynders as his foil. And for his part, Rynders later admitted thatDouglass’s response to him at the antislavery meeting was “as good a shot as Iever had in my life.”5 [notes.html#ch12fn_5a]Douglass, however, had one more violent humiliation to endure in New York. Heattended the AASS meetings in the company of Julia Griffiths and her youngersister, Eliza. Julia had arrived in Rochester in May 1849 for what may have beenplanned as a permanent stay. For part of a year already she had been working asthe business manager, fund-raiser, and assistant editor on the North Star. Shelived in Douglass’s home, and under her management the paper had increased insubscriptions and editorial quality. Eliza and John Dick, the printer in theNorth Star office, also boarded in the Douglasses’ house. Eliza and John wereabout to be married and would emigrate to Canada in June 1850.6[notes.html#ch12fn_6a]The day after the AASS meetings ended, while awaiting his ferry for anengagement in Philadelphia, Douglass strolled in Battery Park at the lower tipof Manhattan with the Griffiths sisters. Reports conflict about whether theywere “arm in arm,” but according to Douglass, his presence on this fashionablepromenade with two white ladies prompted a mob of a half dozen to assault them.Using “coarse and filthy language,” several of the thugs struck the sisters onthe head while one of them assaulted Douglass. The abolitionist fended them offwith his umbrella, and they seemed to disperse, although as the Douglass partyneared the steamer dock, one assailant jumped Douglass again and slugged him inthe face. The attack soon appeared all over the press, including in London,where the Times reprinted articles from the New York Globe that argued Douglassdeserved the attacks not only for his “audacious and disgraceful” violation ofracial-sexual propriety, but for his “abusing” his “country, its patriots andconstitution” in recent speeches. According to these versions of the incident,an “indignant gentleman” had graciously “separated” Douglass from the whitewomen and given the black man a “dressing” he deserved.7 [notes.html#ch12fn_7a]As before, Douglass used this attack for its fullest propaganda value, whilerevealing a good deal about himself and his relationship with Julia. In hisaccount of the incident he declared the abuse in New York the most “demoniacal”he had ever endured. He felt as though he lived in “an enemy’s land—surroundedon all sides.” And he happily pled guilty to all charges, “glorying in havingcommitted them,” if it meant that the crime was “to be a man, entitled to allrights, privileges and dignity.” He claimed the right to associate with anyone,including his white female friends, in public places. In editorials he admittedthat his attackers were vicious people, but maintained they served as theappointed “bloodhounds of American slavery.”8 [notes.html#ch12fn_8a]Douglass turned the affair into an incisive analysis of racism. His offense, heargued, had never been the companionship with white women, but the assumption ofequality with them. America’s “aristocracy of skin” could not tolerate suchbehavior. He drew deep from nine years of lecturing and travel, declaring thathe “could not remember to have made a single antislavery tour” when he had “notbeen assailed by this mean spirit of caste.” Douglass argued that the term“prejudice” was simply too weak and “innocent” to capture what blacks endured. Amore “savage” language was required to match the beliefs of all the Ryndersesinside and outside of power. “Properly speaking,” Douglass contended, “prejudiceagainst color does not exist in this country. The feeling (or whatever it is)which we call prejudice, is no less than a murderous, hell-born hatred of everyvirtue which may adorn the character of a black man.” Black men were acceptablewhen “appendages,” he said. While “riding down Broadway in company with ladies,”Douglass wrote, they observed “several white ladies riding with black servants.”Those well-dressed carriage drivers did not offend the hooligans who attackedDouglass and his companions. Douglass relished his “impudence”; equality, notcolor, offended.9 [notes.html#ch12fn_9a] He had given definition and texture tothe idea of racism. And he and Griffiths, daily colleagues in a struggle of headand heart, now had a bold public experience of violence that cemented theirbond.• • •The abiding friendship of Frederick and Julia must be understood within thisworld of raw, belligerent racism. The handsome and most famous black man in theUnited States simply would not give in to its power. And he dearly needed thepowers and skills that Griffiths brought to his work and life. Unmarried, sevenyears older than her host, and raised with deep reform commitments, Griffithsadored both Douglass and his cause. Little is known about Griffiths’s earlyeducation, but she brought a knowledge of grammar, business acumen, and evenpolitical savvy to Douglass’s office. Indeed, Douglass gave Griffiths not onlyacknowledgment for her talents, but for several years he gave her the careerthis Victorian woman had never achieved. Soon after her arrival in Rochester inMay 1849, she wielded a “blue pencil” on the editor’s copy, as she chastised theprinters and their boss alike for the North Star’s misspellings and errors.Whether their connection had ever been love at first sight, as some havesuggested, is speculation. She did write a song in honor of Douglass’s departurefrom England, “Farewell to Frederick Douglass,” which was published in London in1847. But Griffiths was no mere starry-eyed devotee. She was a manager ofbusiness affairs, as well as of people. She was a voracious reader and learner;her devotion to radical abolitionism provided what the movement oftendesperately needed—astute organization, financial foundation, and an apparentlypure commitment to help Douglass go out and be Douglass. She soon composed aregular column for the newspaper, “Literary Notices,” signaling new books andmagazines available at a local bookstore. She possessed a wide knowledge ofliterature, classical and popular. Griffiths also had a hand in some editorialsand many times helped get the weekly paper out in the editor’s absence.10[notes.html#ch12fn_10a] No matter how awkward things became for Anna and thechildren at the house in Rochester, the North Star’s editor was all too glad tohave Julia as a daily colleague.This extraordinary and ultimately untenable situation of an educated whiteEnglishwoman living in the Douglass home and laboring daily with him on hislife’s work, while Anna Douglass raised five children in its midst, leads us towonder whether the relationship was ever sexual. We do not know for sure, andperhaps it does not matter. The tenderness of their associations andcorrespondence, and the intimacy with which Julia seems to have nurtured heryounger hero, might lead us moderns to assume that of course they slept witheach other. But right under the watchful eyes and immediate presence of Anna?Not likely. They already violated norms of appearance, whether they shared a bedor not. Griffiths’s intelligence and deep caring were surely attractive toFrederick. Their mutual affection did not need to be sexual to be fulfilling, atleast for Frederick. When Isaac Post met Julia, he described her as older thanhe expected. Samuel J. May called her “an ordinary looking white woman,”although the famed British abolitionist George Thompson, upon his visit and fetewith fifty guests at Douglass’s house in 1851, made no notice of Anna whileobserving that he “had a pleasant evening irradiated by the mild splendor of acertain Julia.”11 [notes.html#ch12fn_11a]Frederick and Julia’s quite public acknowledgment of a close workingrelationship implies that they kept things as proper as possible. Julia playedmany roles at the homestead, including unsuccessful attempts at tutoring Anna inliteracy, and some care of the younger children. Julia provided many things Annadid not—intellectual companionship and challenge, a female face toward thepublic when he needed it, and a nurturing that the struggling thirty- tothirty-five-year-old Douglass desperately needed. Julia served a practical endas well—she raised a good deal of money that fed his family and kept thenewspaper afloat. Indeed, in August 1849, during the full year that both Juliaand Eliza boarded with the Douglasses on Alexander Street, they purchased withtheir own money the mortgage on the house, relieving Frederick and Anna of ahuge worry. By 1850, like it or not, Anna and the family depended on Julia’spresence.12 [notes.html#ch12fn_12a]Douglass had already struck up a strong relationship with Gerrit Smith, thewealthy upstate New York abolitionist, before Julia arrived on the scene. Butshe helped cultivate that crucial connection, both financially andideologically. In the summer of 1850, in one of her letters to Smith about thedire straits of the North Star, Griffiths reminded the philanthropist of her keyrole. “Remember dear sir, I am the Banker for the paper—& know always preciselyhow the accounts stand.”13 [notes.html#ch12fn_13a] That is far more thanDouglass could ever say on his own. Julia helped to polish a raw genius into agem and, for a time, managed his emotional health as well as his bank accounts.Gerrit Smith was a man of enormous emotional complexity, religious fervor,antislavery commitment, and wealth. By 1850 he had put aside long-standing tiesto old colonizationists, then to Garrisonian moral suasion, as well as thetemperance movement, and embraced political abolitionism. Along the way he waseven a Millerite for a while, adopting the millennialist William Miller’spredictions of Christ’s second coming in 1843. Smith had been raised in the“mansion house” of his father, Peter Smith, in Peterboro, New York. Peter, anuneducated man and cold father, had amassed great wealth as a land baron inupstate New York, traded with Indian tribes such as the Oneida, and heldnumerous slaves, with whom his sons worked side by side until the Panic of 1819.As a young intellectual, Gerrit sought an education at Hamilton College inClinton, New York, and fashioned himself a romantic Byronic hero who wouldbecome a man of letters. Smith never gave up entirely on his literaryaspirations even after he inherited and reluctantly took over his father’s hugeestate. Always susceptible to wild mood swings, Smith underwent a variety ofreligious conversions, first after the death of his beloved mother and his firstwife, named Wealtha, within a year of their marriage in 1819, and again in the1820s and 1830s as religious revivals spread through the region. By the timeDouglass and Smith connected after the orator’s move to Rochester, the Sage ofPeterboro had established a “circle” of followers who would use politicalinstitutions, the Constitution, and the vote to try to crush the Slave Power inthe United States.14 [notes.html#ch12fn_14a] Douglass, long chafing underGarrisonian strictures and open to new ideas, found Smith’s overtures—towardpolitical action, the Liberty Party, and an antislavery interpretation of theConstitution—irresistible.From the beginning, Douglass and Smith engaged in an increasingly intensecorrespondence. Julia’s interventions now enhanced the two distinct dimensionsof this friendship, the one practical and pecuniary and the other intellectualand strategic. Smith was an early supporter of the North Star. But as Douglassstruggled to keep the paper alive in the spring of 1849, he groused about beingbroke to the man with deep pockets. “My money is now all gone,” the editorreported; he was at least $200 in debt. Douglass declared himself out on a limb.His “best friends” (Garrisonians) thought his venture unnecessary and “useless”;he had started the paper against their wishes. Douglass eagerly courted thedonor. As Smith responded by sending small checks, he also aggressivelyrecruited Douglass to the cause of political abolition.15[notes.html#ch12fn_15a] Smith’s new protégé would take most of a year to fullygive in to the new ideology. All the while Griffiths revved up the fund-raisingand saved Douglass from bankruptcy and psychological collapse.• • •The neighborhood and most of reform Rochester was all astir over the fascinatingEnglishwomen living in Douglass’s home. The “spinsters of means and culture”caused endless curiosity in the city, according to a chronicler of Rochester. Areminiscence published in 1941 quaintly captures the way the locals observed thesituation. “The appearance on the Main Street,” wrote Howard Coles, “ofFrederick Douglass with one of these ladies on either arm seriously threatenedthe order of the town for a while, and threats were openly made of what would bedone if such aggressive demonstrations of race-mixture were persisted in.Frederick Douglass kept his head high as ever, the ladies filling the role ofpossible martyrs unflinchingly.”16 [notes.html#ch12fn_16a] In reality, Juliasimply went to work, although she and Frederick understood the order theychallenged.Along with antislavery, Douglass became Griffiths’s cause. The best windows wehave into their relationship, as well as into Douglass’s mental and physicalhealth, are the remarkable letters Julia wrote to Gerrit Smith. She frequentlydepicted Frederick as psychologically distraught over the plight of the paperand the financial situation of his family, as well as physically incapacitatednot only by constant throat ailments but by what she called “inflammatoryrheumatism.” At the age of thirty-two to thirty-three, Douglass was sometimesconfined to bed for days at a time, his joints locked up, limbs swollen, unableto walk. In the summer of 1850 Julia reported him “quite sick” with a “graveattack” of this debilitating condition. “In the course of the last fortnight hehas had three severe falls,” Julia confided to Smith. The reports wereremarkably intimate: “He has a good man who comes twice a day to wash him.” Byautumn, Julia asked Smith to keep all this knowledge “strictly private” as shedescribed Douglass’s “bad cough” and “light headedness.” Julia proudly announcedthat she wrote the editorials as her comrade dictated. Then, “at night he wasseized with . . . a fit & has been laid up with his throat ever since.”17[notes.html#ch12fn_17a]Already by the 1850s, Douglass’s public image was of a virile man of the world,holding audiences in rapt control with words as well as charisma. His baritonevoice alone, coupled with authentic slave roots, mesmerized his audiences.Increasingly he sat for, as well as manipulated, many photographers who capturedhis unforgettable visage frontally and in profile—erect, with starched shirts,exuding intelligence and greatness. The fiery eyes, prominent nose, strikingfeatures, goatee surrounding prominent lips seemingly about to burst intoeloquence, and that lion’s mane of hair, carefully brushed and parted, allprovided an image of a man for a heroic age. But this was not the man undergoingsome sort of paralysis and nervous breakdown by 1851. The reports of Douglass’sillnesses were so common that Smith wrote back to Griffiths in July, “Muchgrieved to hear of the continued sickness of our dear Douglass.” That same monthin the paper she publicly announced that the editor underwent a “severe relapse”of his illness and was “wholly unable to write for the present number.” A weeklater, Douglass himself described his condition, verifying what had appeared inGriffiths’s letters. He “suffered from a succession of attacks,” he declared,for a full month. “First bilious fever, sharp, sudden and severe (brought on nodoubt by over-exertion and incautious exposure) prostrated my energies andconfined me to my room.” For five years, he admitted, these maladies, lodged inhis “throat difficulty,” had plagued him. When back on his feet Douglass rushedout on speaking tours to raise money for the newspaper. He was franticallytrying to make ends meet, feed his family, and, as he said in the paper, “keepheads above water.”18 [notes.html#ch12fn_18a]Image [../images/f0210-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, August 1852. Daguerreotype. Samuel T. Miller photographer.Julia’s most disturbing reports indicated that Douglass floated in and out ofmental collapse. In late July 1851 he was “quite unwell,” one day able to workat the office and the next two “unfit for it.” “Although the seat of the diseaseis the throat,” she said, “I am inclined to think that serious anxiety for hispaper has much to do with it.” By late August, the great man was “extremelydepressed” because little money flowed into the coffers, a dire circumstanceespecially since Frederick possessed a “perfect horror of being in debt.” Juliatried to “inspire him with hope,” but often to no avail. The alarm in herletters came embedded in constant appeals for money from Smith. Indeed, withoutSmith’s donations, $100 here and $200 there, Douglass’s paper would have folded.Anna kept an excellent vegetable garden, but Smith’s largesse not only paid forthe North Star’s printing, ink, and paper bills, but it provided food for fivegrowing children. And the stress in the household was enormous. “We have not hadsickness out of the house for a single day since the end of June,” Juliareported in August. “All this naturally tends to depress our friendgreatly—added to which he has recently had a considerable increase of thosehouse trials about which I spoke to you and dear Mrs. Smith when atPeterboro.”19 [notes.html#ch12fn_19a] Julia, not Anna, had accompanied Douglasson a social visit to the Smiths’ mansion earlier that month.“House trials”? Julia did not offer a definition, but we can surmise that thismeant not only money stresses, and the demands of children needing theirfather’s attention. It surely meant quarrels with Anna, whose considerablehomemaking powers were held hostage to the success or failure of the enterpriseJulia ran for her husband, day and night. Douglass was a women’s rights man. Butprivately he struggled mightily with his sense of manliness in these years; hehad never known a father who took care of him. But he was failing; he could goout and thrill an audience, but at home he was the patriarch who could notprovide for his family. In the myth of the Self-Made Man, burgeoning all overthe culture in antebellum America, and of which Douglass became a famousproponent, this archetype had to publicly prove, as the sociologist MichaelKimmel argues, that he mastered his “life, liberty, and property.” In the psycheof every Self-Made Man roiled a nightmare of chronic insecurity in the volatilemarketplace. “Manhood” required mobility and independence, as it also courtedcatastrophe. Griffiths remembered Douglass saying that soon, if his financialsituation did not improve, he would be “digging potatoes.” So embarrassed wasDouglass that Griffiths’s frequent appeals to Smith for money were something hewould simultaneously deny he needed as he also begged for more. He wrote manydirect appeals in his newspaper to delinquent subscribers to “pay up,” anddemonstrate their pride in an enterprise owned and edited by a former fugitiveslave. Douglass felt the double-edged sword of denial; sometimes he pushedthrough its confusions and admitted it. In September 1851 he wrote to Smith,regretting “that you should be so soon called upon for a helping hand.” Thecalls that year never stopped. “Necessity my friend, would listen to noregrets,” Douglass admitted. “I was under the hammer and my friend Julia seeingit cried out in my behalf. You came to my help and I am on my feet again.”20[notes.html#ch12fn_20a]Well, not really. In November, in another letter labeled “Private,” Juliacommunicated her “frightful apprehension” about Douglass’s psychological state.He suffered “immense anxiety (pecuniary & family),” and one evening“seemed . . . to lose his balance of mind,” wandering around murmuring about“going crazy.” She sat up late at night with him singing and reciting “repeatedhymns and psalms,” and an old favorite Robert Burns poem, “The Cotter’s SaturdayNight.” The melancholy love poem contains this verse:O happy love! where love like this is found:O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!I’ve paced much this weary, mortal round,And sage experience bids me this declare,“If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spareOne cordial in this melancholy vale,’Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pairIn other’s arms, breathe out the tender tale,Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening gale.Performing as a bonny lass in a Burns poem, Julia concluded, “I shall do all inmy power to tranquilize him—and shall not feather my fears to anyone.” But thathardly mattered. Douglass pronounced for all his readers by December 1851 thathe was again “extremely unwell.” He did travel to Providence to deliver oneunusual lecture in which he bared his spiritual soul: “I have been for the pastyear under a cloud.” He called for abolitionists to “pray” and “meditate” andfoster “love.” He openly worried that by so long lambasting the clergy in his“Slaveholder’s Sermon,” he had “destroyed in myself that very reverence for Godand for religion.” His illnesses had been so disabling, he declared, that for“compiling my paper the credit is due to my friend Miss Griffiths.”21[notes.html#ch12fn_21a] Douglass was at risk of total psychological collapse.• • •Anna and Julia were two different kinds of companions. As Rosetta remembered,Anna possessed “no knowledge of books” and did not participate in Douglass’sfrenzied activism. A Rochester local history laden with reminiscences deemedAnna a “model housekeeper” with “severe notions of the proprieties and duties oflife.” Her “greatest discontent,” said the Rochesterite, was when admirers ofher husband “persisted in dragging her into notice . . . to receive visitors.”22[notes.html#ch12fn_22a] Calling Julia the business manager and special friend,however, is not enough. It was as though Douglass had a conjugal and acompanionate mate, and they were not the same person. Exactly how he justifiedor explained this to himself, or to Anna, he never tells us. One woman providedhim a home and a family; the other helped him forge his professional life andcalling. He loved both.Douglass commonly signed off a letter to Gerrit Smith in the manner he did inMay 1851: “I write from the office or I am sure that my wife would unite withMiss Griffiths (who is industriously wielding her pen at another desk) insending love to you and your dear lady.” Douglass constantly called attention toGriffiths’s assiduous labors at his side. As the plans solidified by June 1851to combine Smith’s fledging Liberty Party paper with the North Star in a newventure renamed Frederick Douglass’ Paper, the editor let his benefactor knowthat he was not working alone. “Julia Griffiths,—my faithful friend, and coworker,” he assured Smith, “(to whom I am greatly indebted for many lessons ofwisdom) is all zeal in our new enterprize.” Repeatedly, Douglass acknowledgedhis dependence on Griffiths’s energy and ideas. As they planned the launch ofthe new paper, the editor said “money matters” should be “left to the care of myindustrious and vigilant friend and co-worker Julia Griffiths. With her eye onthe subscription list—I think very little would go wrong in that quarter.”Douglass openly worried about Julia as he exalted her to Smith, implying thather situation living in such proximity to Anna and his family caused her greatstrain. “To her the credit belongs that the ‘Star’ is now out of debts,” hewrote. “She ought to have this credit for you need not be told that she has muchto annoy—and at times weigh down her spirit. She feels happy at the prospect nowbefore her and will doubtless enter upon her duties with much spirit.” Douglassthus admitted the tensions among the women in his own household, as well as hisown dire needs. Few statements survive from this period in which he expressessimilar concern for Anna’s emotional well-being. Douglass cherished the“co-worker” at his side in the office and the nursemaid in the depths of hisdepressions and illnesses—she gave him confidence and psychic ballast.23[notes.html#ch12fn_23a]Julia Griffiths was not the invisible other woman, neither in Rochester nor inthe wider world of abolitionism. As Douglass made his ideological turn topolitical antislavery and underwent a bitter breakup with Garrison and hisorganization, she became part of the target of retribution. The split reached afull-blown stage in 1851 as Douglass openly embraced Smith’s version of anantislavery interpretation of the Constitution, of voting, and politicalactivism. As Smith mentored Douglass through this transformation, Julia temperedher colleague’s anger and guided and prodded him through the bloodletting heencountered from and delivered to the Garrisonians.Douglass’s course was typical of that of the many abolitionists who came to seepolitical action as essential to their cause. Although he had long expressedgratitude for Garrison’s tutelage and patronage, the great Bostonian had becomethe father to leave behind. Douglass had long since headed out for his own newterritory; the rigid doctrines of disunionism, nonvoting, and moral suasion nolonger sufficed in the political climate of the 1850s, especially in the wake ofthe Fugitive Slave Act, and the violent unfolding of the crisis over slavery’swestern expansion.Nonvoting and disunionism were the easiest of Garrisonian tenets for Douglass todiscard. The meaning of slavery in relation to federal law proved moreproblematic. The Smith circle’s view held that the Constitution empowered—evenrequired—Congress to abolish slavery in the Southern states by directlegislation. Pioneered by the New York abolitionist Alvan Stewart, this argumentgained wider adherence from the writings of William Goodell and Lysander Spoonerin the 1840s. Douglass read these authors and slowly came under their sway. TheGarrisonians would claim that Douglass turncoated only for Smith’s donations andout of selfish ambition. But he was drawn to new ideas that offered him hope inkilling the power of slavery. Goodell and Spooner pointed to constitutionalguarantees of habeas corpus and a “republican form of government” for everystate, the preamble’s call for a “more perfect union” and promise to “secure theblessings of liberty,” the enabling clause, and especially the Fifth Amendment’sdeclaration that no person could “be deprived of life, liberty, or propertywithout due process of law” as proof that the federal government was obligatedto abolish slavery everywhere.24 [notes.html#ch12fn_24a] Especially as aneditor, Douglass had always engaged with national politics. Now the federalauthority at the base of slavery’s stranglehold on America became his intensivefocus.The Goodell-Spooner antislavery constitutional theory differed markedly fromthat championed by the Ohioan Salmon P. Chase. From the early 1840s, Chaseargued that the “intentions” of the founding fathers were for a speedy abolitionof slavery. He believed that slavery was a creature of state law and thereforemerely “local” in America. The federal government had the power, Chasemaintained, to end slavery in all places where it had exclusive jurisdiction(the District of Columbia and the territories). Hence, the duty of abolitionistswas to restrict, to cordon off, slavery, and to try with pressure over time toconvince the Southern states to emancipate their slaves by state action. In the1850s Chase’s view became the basis of the Republican Party’s doctrine of freesoil and nonextensionism.25 [notes.html#ch12fn_25a]Thus Douglass caught the scent of a potent idea—that constitutional principlecould be elevated above constitutional practice and affect real power. Helearned a new cast of mind—political philosophy as well as action—and he took toit eagerly. By 1849 he had already stepped beyond Garrison’s notion of theConstitution as a “covenant with evil.” He announced himself “satisfied that ifstrictly construed according to its reading,” the Constitution was “not aproslavery instrument,” although the original intent of the founders had made itso. Actual provisions of the document, coupled with natural law, made theConstitution a source of antislavery principles; history, Douglass believed, hadmade it proslavery in practice.26 [notes.html#ch12fn_26a]By April 1850 Douglass still felt perplexed by parts of the Constitutionquestion. “Liberty and Slavery—opposite as heaven and hell—are both in theConstitution,” he wrote in an editorial. But this was precisely its “radicaldefect”: it offered no resolution for the “war of elements which is now rockingthe land.” Douglass gave his “sympathies” to those who envisioned theConstitution as a source of freedom and justice, but not his “judgment.” Heconcluded that, for the moment, the Constitution was “at war with itself,” anapt description as well of his own mind. Douglass was an elastic thinker,especially about political ideology. As James Oakes has argued, Douglass’spolitical thought is laced with a “series of reversals”; he would waver inresponse to events and to his own learning.27 [notes.html#ch12fn_27a]January 1851 still found Douglass teetering between the imperatives of legal andmoral logic, but much more impressed with Smith’s reasoning. Confessing to Smiththat their relationship had greatly affected his thinking, Douglass declaredthat he had “about decided to let slaveholders and their Northern abettors havethe laboring oar in putting a proslavery interpretation on the Constitution.” Hestill had some reservations as he swallowed the theory whole. “I am sick andtired of arguing on the slaveholders’ side of this question,” he complained,“although they are doubtless right so far as the intentions of the framers ofthe Constitution.” Smith’s arbitrary determination that because slavery was sucha moral outrage it could never achieve legal status troubled Douglass, who stillwondered about the confusion between moral perceptions and “American legalauthority.” Sheer power, he knew, still held the trump cards. Despite all hisintellectual hand-wringing, Douglass assured his mentor that he had “ceased toaffirm the proslavery character of the Constitution.”28 [notes.html#ch12fn_28a]Image [../images/f0216-01.jpg]Gerrit Smith, c. 1855. Daguerreotype.Douglass had argued his way to this new position, rather than merely imbibingit. Smith wrote to his pupil in June 1851 with “much joy” that Douglass hadaccepted this interpretation. “I have observed for years that you were coming tothis conclusion,” Smith accurately said. But “far more joyful” was the student’srealization that “slavery is incapable of legalization,” and that “law is forthe protection, not for the destruction of rights.” They had found common groundin another kind of logic, explained by Smith tellingly: “Every man is anabolitionist; every man is selfish enough to be an abolitionist for himself, butevery man is not unselfish enough to be an abolitionist for others.”29[notes.html#ch12fn_29a] In that logic one finds both the necessity for law, butalso the reason why sometimes laws must be broken.Douglass had found a new and more potent form of radicalism, but by mid-1851 hecame under attack by the Garrisonians for his disloyalty to their principles.“There is roguery somewhere!” cried Garrison in an outburst at the May 1851annual meeting of the AASS in Syracuse. He laid the charge on Douglass, who, inresponse to a resolution declaring that the society would endorse no newspaperthat did not support a proslavery conception of the Constitution, announced his“firm conviction” that the national charter should be “wielded in behalf ofemancipation.” He had conducted “careful study,” Douglass told all his oldcolleagues, and from now on he planned to advance the antislavery interpretationof the Constitution in his paper. In an uproar the convention promptly voted toexclude the North Star from the list of favored journals.30[notes.html#ch12fn_30a] Orthodoxy held the Garrisonian church together, andDouglass was about to be excommunicated.As Douglass now merged his journal, newly named Frederick Douglass’ Paper, withthe Liberty Party, which had a firm base in western New York, his perfidy onlydeepened in Garrisonian eyes; some accused him of selling out for Gerrit Smith’slucre, while others pointed to the arrogance of the new title. Douglass expectednow, he told Smith, “to be made . . . an object of special attack. . . . I knowtoo well the temper of my old companions to hope to escape the penalty which allothers have paid who have ventured to differ from them.” Douglass expressedrelief at no longer feeling “glued to the non-voting theory,” but admitted tobeing “pained” by the controversy. “The war will be waged,” he predicted, “notagainst opinions, but motives.” He needed money badly and appealed to Smithconstantly in 1851. He felt “anxious,” Douglass told Smith. But Douglass wasdetermined this time to “set an example of ability to take care of myself.”Inadvertently, Douglass also quietly demonstrated the other reason his oldfriends resented and even condemned him, as he frequently signed off letterswith personal acknowledgments to “Julia Griffiths, my faithful friend andco-worker.”31 [notes.html#ch12fn_31a]• • •Griffiths had become not only Frederick’s business manager but his gatekeeper.Charges of ingratitude against Douglass only intensified as some abolitionistscomplained of their old mate’s inaccessibility and arrogance. Isabel Jennings inIreland complained in 1851 that she had “heard only once” from Douglass sinceJulia had taken over his office, otherwise receiving only requests for moneyfrom “Miss J.G.” Jennings worried that the situation would hurt the cause aswell as Douglass’s life. “Miss G. reads all F.D.’s letters,” Jenningscomplained, as she snidely remarked, “I am sure he thinks antislavery zeal isthe strongest emotion she is capable of.” Abby Kelley Foster, who had come todespise Douglass, took it out privately on Julia. In 1852 she snarled about“that Julia Griffiths, making people think we’re infidels,” as her boss enjoyed“slandering all our English and American friends.” As lulls occurred in the openconflict between Garrison and Douglass, tongues wagged in private and gossipletters flowed among the abolitionist elite, some reporting how Julia oftenwalked the streets of Rochester in fashionable dresses and an abundance of finejewelry.32 [notes.html#ch12fn_32a] She was not a Quaker in appearance or habits,unlike many in that antislavery community.In May 1852 the AASS gathered for its annual meeting in Rochester, but homeground hardly protected Douglass from new assaults on his apostasy. Numerousdistinguished abolitionists, all his former traveling companions and friends,spent inordinate time and energy denouncing Douglass. They included WendellPhillips, Stephen and Abby Kelley Foster, Oliver Johnson, and the blackGarrisonians Charles Lenox Remond and Robert Purvis. Douglass had histories withall of these former comrades; he had forged his career with them on countlessovernight train rides, and against many a racist mob. Now they treated him, ashe said, only “as an enemy.” Foster called Douglass a “cat in the meal,” andRemond insisted the abolitionists should stop “handling Douglass with kidgloves.” The marked man now felt certain that his old black colleagues inparticular, Purvis and Remond, wanted to destroy his newspaper.33[notes.html#ch12fn_33a] Remond had been the first black Garrisonian on thecircuit and never accommodated to being displaced.This public humiliation hurt Douglass to the bone. Phillips and Abby Fosterespecially let him know that the society had not rejected him; he stood“self-exiled” due to his changed strategic views of abolition. His motivesassailed at every level with what Douglass called “vile insinuations,” StephenFoster made a bad situation worse. Douglass faced a choice: either he was “withus,” or “we’ll crush you, as we have the Liberty Party.” It was one thing tofight rhetorical battles over tactics, and quite another to attack a colleague’spersonal character. Samuel May Jr. came forth to try to acknowledge Douglass’s“genius” and indispensable role in the movement, stressing that he remained“calm, cool, collected,” even as he withstood this withering attack. But Purvisjoined Remond in announcing that he had canceled his subscription to Douglass’spaper, accused the editor of taking a “bribe” of $20 from a colonizationsupporter, and, worst of all, declared it “no longer safe to trust the interestsof colored people with Douglass.” Garrison himself stooped low into thepettiness, suggesting that Douglass had allowed himself to be lauded by avowedAASS enemies at a Liberty Party convention.34 [notes.html#ch12fn_34a]These were anxious times for members of the AASS; they steadily lost adherentsas they came under attack from the rising tide of political abolitionism, thenew Free Soil Party, and the unprecedented whirlwind created by Harriet BeecherStowe’s bestselling novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Douglass reported in late June thatStowe’s work had just sold its eighty thousandth copy.35 [notes.html#ch12fn_35a]The book had been published in the spring of 1852 and was taking the country bystorm as no other book ever had while the old-organization abolitionists viedwith one another publicly to discredit one of their own for his ideas.How Douglass mustered what he called “rectitude” to withstand this publicbarrage from old friends is as remarkable as it is bewildering. On a personallevel the breakup with the Garrisonians devastated Douglass even as he himselffueled the fires. Douglass cultivated the image of the strong individual, alwaysquesting for the next turn in the crusade to destroy slavery. And he was anintense watcher of his own life. As necessary, he would fly as the eagle, thelone bird soaring to the new horizon of ideas, rhetoric, and action. In his ownslave-born ways Douglass imagined a kind of Whitmanesque “Song of Myself” at theheart of his journey. In so many lines of that great poem Whitman could havebeen imagining the struggling but determined Douglass of the early 1850s:The past and present wilt. . . . I have filled them and emptied Them,And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.36 [notes.html#ch12fn_36a]Douglass had long known that he could not stay within the Garrisonian fold. Evenat age thirty-five he was still the angry young man finding and testing thelimits of his own voice. But as we have seen, he never flew entirely alone.Douglass nearly ran out of labels for the Garrisonian assault as he experiencedit. The day after the Rochester convention ended, he wrote to Smith trying tocharacterize what he had endured. Treated as a “deserter from the fold,” henevertheless, or so he claimed, let his colleagues “search me and probe me tothe bottom.” Facing what he considered outright lies, he stood firm against thehailstorm of “side blows, innuendo, dark suspicions, such as avarice,faithlessness, treachery, ingratitude and what not.” Whistling in the graveyard,he assured Smith proudly that he felt “strengthened to bear it withoutperturbation.” Such was not the case a few days later as he wrote his longresponse for his paper. There he exposed his “grief” that “men engaged in agreat and holy cause should fall out by the way” in such ugly form. Suchdifferences could not be hidden, Douglass maintained, by “seeming to be at peacewhen there is no peace.” So he took up the pen and fought back. Jeremiah andIsaiah had fought best against their own kind; their roles as brokenhearted,suffering servants calling people to grief, awareness, exile, and redemptiongave Douglass models for finding his own prophetic voice, for turning afflictioninto hope, however many friends he might lose.37 [notes.html#ch12fn_37a]In a long rejoinder to his critics he defended his right to change his views.“Denunciation, coldness, and unkindness” were not arguments, he contended, andhardly the way to “reclaim an erring brother.” Putting several lines in capitalletters, Douglass tried for high ground and struck his claim for freedom ofthought and association: “I CONTEND THAT I HAVE A RIGHT TO CO-OPERATE WITHANYBODY, WITH EVERYBODY, FOR THE OVERTHROW OF SLAVERY IN THIS COUNTRY, whetherauxiliary or not auxiliary to the American Society.” Here was a politicalconsciousness at work. Douglass wielded daggers of his own, couched inShakespearean metaphor. Drawing from Iago’s contempt for Othello’s unboundedjealousy, Douglass left no doubt of what he thought Remond and Purvis especiallywere up to. “Trifles, light as air / Are to the jealous, confirmations strong. /As proofs of Holy Writ.” He had long dismissed Remond as his “old jealousfriend,” then twisted the knife deeper into both of the two for their “falsewitness” against a fellow black abolitionist, and, worse, for personally seekingto destroy “the last press remaining in the United States, wielded by a sablehand.” There is no fight like a fight between the closest of comrades overnotions of betrayal. Douglass could be ugly too; he accused Remond and Purvis ofjoining with every “negro-hater in all the land” who would delight inliquidating Douglass and his newspaper.38 [notes.html#ch12fn_38a]Image [../images/f0220-01.jpg]Charles Lenox Remond, c. 1851–56. Daguerreotype. Samuel S. Broadbentphotographer.But Douglass’s brilliant rejoinder only masked his loneliness and insecurity. Hecould be petty, even self-destructive, as he also found new inspirations. ByJuly 1852, he revealed to Smith that “you not only keep life in my paper butkeep spirit in me. I owe you much every way for my people and for myself.” Thepaper still teetered on financial extinction as Griffiths continued to labor toget subscribers to pay up. Frederick remained uncomfortable about the constantappeals to his rich benefactor. Failure seemed always to be just around thecorner on Douglass’s open road, where lecturing and trying to sell copies ofthose lectures remained his primary “method or . . . means of living andtraveling.” With the bravado of a rather desperate man, he told Smith he did notwant “one cent more” from his generosity. If the paper died “when that sum isexhausted, I will submit with resignation to its death,” he wrote, despitesaying in the next breath that he had “nursed” the paper so long, had loved it,and given it “half my worldly goods and the whole of my time for five years.”39[notes.html#ch12fn_39a] Cries for help continued to burst from under thosestarched collars and through the eloquent rhetoric.In late 1852, allegedly because Anna “ordered” it, Julia moved out of Douglass’shome and became a boarder with John and Mary Porter, friends in the Rochesterantislavery community. Early the next year, Samuel D. Porter, a wealthy neighborand friend, wrote to Douglass informing him that “scandalous reports” wererampant in Rochester about Frederick and Julia having an affair in his homeunder the eyes of his own wife and children. Douglass asked that the accusersmake their claims more “definite” about “Miss G. and me,” and then he mightanswer them. In vague terms he defended himself as a “husband and a father—andwithal a citizen,” declaring that he performed all the roles “honorably.” Healso aggressively defended Julia as a “free woman” who had moved out and simply“preferred to board in another family.” Porter’s letter does not survive, butthe rumors were scurrilous by the measure of Douglass’s response. “I am in noway responsible for her words, her deeds or her dress,” the embarrassed editorsaid, “nor indeed, for her thinking me a ‘God.’ ” But he firmly declared his“gratitude, respect and friendship” for his “clerk” and, awkwardly, describedhow they now spent only “business hours for business purposes” in each other’scompany.40 [notes.html#ch12fn_40a]By summer and fall of 1853, the alleged illicit relationship exploded at theheart of a wider war of character assassination between Douglass and theGarrisonians. In the wake of the AASS annual meeting in May, Douglass suggestedthat Parker Pillsbury, Henry C. Wright, and Stephen Foster, prominentGarrisonians all, had stayed away “because their presence might give new forceto the charge of infidelity” against them. Douglass had previously questionedthe Christian sincerity of fellow AASS members. The charge simmered until a WestIndian emancipation celebration in Framingham, Massachusetts, on August 1, atwhich Wendell Phillips publicly dressed down Douglass in front of six hundredpeople for the slur upon his friends and the organization, wondering how hisfellow orator could even show his face among old comrades. Later that monthDouglass wrote an editorial and delivered a speech at the heart of blackGarrisonianism, the Belknap Street Church in Boston. He stepped up his attack onGarrisonian disbelief in the Bible, as well as viciously attacking his blackrivals.41 [notes.html#ch12fn_41a]To an extent, a vengeful Douglass now seemed out of control. In print and in anopen meeting, he called Remond, Purvis, and William Cooper Nell (his old friendand former editorial assistant) “practical enemies of the colored people” fortheir loyalty to Garrison. Douglass threw some low blows. He associated Purvis,a mulatto whose white father had attained some wealth, with tainted“blood-stained riches.” He considered Remond “selectively” rich because he hadmarried into money. Worst, he labeled Nell, who now worked in Garrison’s office,a “pitiful fool” and a “contemptible tool” of the Boston hierarchy. FromSeptember through November, the entire Garrisonian press fired back with pent-uprage. Douglass had long exposed his persecution complex, his self-portrayal as alone rebel, the purveyor of new truths against all the ossified doctrines of theeastern “bishop” and his orthodox priests. In writing privately to Gerrit Smithin late August, Douglass claimed, disingenuously, that he was “greatly desirousof keeping out of quarrels with Boston.” But they deserved a “going over”because of their “downright bigotry and pride of position.” As though baring histeeth, he continued, “They talk down there, just as if the Antislavery Causebelonged to them . . . that no man has a right to ‘peep or mutter’ on thesubject, who does not hold letters of patent from them.”42[notes.html#ch12fn_42a]Douglass could neither hold his fire nor forget a slight. It was as though apart of his soul had forever been forged in the fight on Covey’s farm, in thebloody rumbles on the docks of Baltimore, and against the countless white mobswho had assaulted him. Language replaced fists in this battle overpersonalities, status, and claims to righteousness. Douglass’s hypersensitivityto criticism and rivalry had long been part of the personality his friendstolerated. Throughout the 1850s Douglass publicly disputed fiercely with otherblack leaders over both ideology and personal matters. He fought tooth and nailwith Henry Highland Garnet and Martin Delany over emigration and colonizationstrategies, especially after the Dred Scott case. Their differences could nothave been more fundamental. And he conducted an ugly spat with William WellsBrown in 1855 over whether Douglass had expressed derogatory estimations ofBrown to mutual acquaintances in England. Their dustup got caught in thecrosshairs of the editor’s prolonged battles with Garrisonians. Douglass accusedBrown of attacking his integrity ad hominem merely to demonstrate his“faithfulness to the American Anti-slavery Society.” But Brown had accusedDouglass of trying to ruin his prospects as a speaker in Britain with a secret,“underhanded . . . sneaking fling at me.” Both charged each other with“dishonor,” although the two men later found ways to make up. They shared somuch—both were former fugitive slaves who had escaped at age twenty and achievedfame as writers.43 [notes.html#ch12fn_43a]As friendships collapsed, and old memories crashed into new ones, Garrisoncomplained of “how extremely sensitive he [Douglass] is to reproof—how readilyhe construes it into personal hostility.” The founder of the Liberator had triedto remain largely silent in this fight, but now he unloaded a wail of bile. InSeptember 1853 he reprinted a Douglass editorial in his regular feature column,Refuge of Oppression, a place normally devoted to articles about the brutalitiesof slavery itself. Garrison said he had always done everything in his power forDouglass’s “welfare and advancement” and had helped to lift him to “his mosteventful life.” But now he found Douglass “intoxicated” by his fame and “cursedby selfish ambition.” Garrison wasted no adjectives. Douglass’s attacks onPhillips were “exceedingly base,” and his treatment of his fellow blackabolitionists would be “disgraceful to a barbarian.”44 [notes.html#ch12fn_44a]The student had overstepped his bounds.Garrison tried to take the high ground, claiming that the dispute was not aboutideological change, but about Douglass’s “alienated . . . temper and spirit.”But then Garrison attacked Julia Griffiths and accused Douglass of the worstimmorality. Garrison called Julia “a prejudiced sectarian Delilah,” endorsingthe storehouse of rumors. “For several years past, he [Douglass] has had one ofthe worst advisors in his printing office whose influence over him has not onlycaused much unhappiness in his own household, but perniciously biased his ownjudgment.” The youthful black wonder of abolitionism could never have alteredhis worldview without a conniving white woman at his ear. When Douglass answeredin defense that Julia had opened his eyes to many ideas, and that Garrison’shandpicked “runners and whisperers” had all along sought to stifle him, thingsonly got worse. Like a Shakespearean court intrigue, defamations andinsinuations flew like autumn leaves in the fall of 1853. Oliver Johnson, editorof the AASS newspaper and a newly contemptuous critic of Douglass, called Julia“a Jezebel whose capacity for making mischief between friends would be difficultto match.” As Douglass issued lengthy denials and refutations of the charge ofmarital infidelity, Johnson could only wreak more damage. He saw Douglass merelyas “an exhibition of moral perversity, blindness and malice.”45[notes.html#ch12fn_45a]No one involved remained untouched or unembarrassed by the scandal. AnnaDouglass produced, or dictated, a short letter to Garrison, which the editorpublished: “Sir: It is not true that the presence of a certain person in theoffice of Frederick Douglass causes unhappiness in his family. Please insertthis in your next paper.” Garrison was unimpressed by the brief denial, callingit “evasive,” although he soon openly regretted that he had ever raised themarital question. For her part, Julia hardly sat on her hands or went intoseclusion over the scandal in which her name was a constant byword for intrigueand adultery. We do not know for sure what she or Anna might have said toFrederick. We do not know who may have confronted whom, nor if anyone did. Butwe do know that Julia worked hard to create the Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Society ofRochester, of which she served as secretary and guiding force. Even moreextraordinarily, Julia produced and edited two remarkable volumes under thetitle Autographs for Freedom, the first published in 1853 and the second in1854. These stunning collections of short essays, poetry, and letters, whichincluded Douglass’s own sixty-five-page novella, “The Heroic Slave,” all writtenby celebrity abolitionist authors, were not only unique in antislaveryliterature but became yet another moneymaker for her comrade’s cause. Thesevolumes required enormous correspondence and editorial labor to bring tofruition; they included some thirty-six authors in the first volume andforty-nine in the second, almost all of whom were squarely in the camp ofpolitical abolitionism.46 [notes.html#ch12fn_46a] Those authors also demonstratethat Douglass had another and even wider circle of friends, thinkers, andcoworkers apart from the Garrisonians.The scandal did not die out in 1853 without sufficient public and privaterecrimination to fill a year’s worth of script for a modern soap opera. Purviswrote a letter published in the Liberator in which he dismissed Douglass as a“shameless ingrate and base slanderer.” Wounded badly, Nell, a sensitive andloquacious man, frequently wrote privately about his pain over Douglass’sstatements. “I cannot easily imagine the circumstances that would result in myspeaking to him,” he lamented. “I can remember the Sunny Side—and only wish Icould forget the shady side of his Character.” Nell remained shocked atDouglass’s “venom” in his attacks on Garrisonians, especially on himself in“battle axe stile [sic].” “Where will he stop?” Nell moaned. After readingDouglass’s long defense in December, Nell said he couldn’t help saying, “Whomthe Gods would destroy, they first make mad.” By January 1854, the Garrisonloyalist, happy in his day job, criticized Autographs for Freedom as an“anti-Garrison” creation by the “F.D. with J.G. contingent,” but then secretlyconfessed to a “slight wish I could have contributed.”47 [notes.html#ch12fn_47a]Douglass left his mark on the scandal as though he strove for the last word. Hecrafted a long, alternately turgid and eloquent defense in his paper on December9, 1853. He also reprinted many columns of the articles that had appeared overthe months in the three primary Garrisonian papers: Liberator, NationalAnti-Slavery Standard (NASS), and the Pennsylvania Freeman. Writing at timeslike a lawyer with a veiled threat of a lawsuit, and then like a wounded, lonelywarrior defending himself against his enemies’ “hatchet of fratricidal war,”Douglass did not provide his finest hour. He could not resist venting hisspleen. The Garrisonians’ aim, he said, was to drive him from the field, to sendhim back to caulking “ships in New Bedford.” They sought nothing less, heclaimed, than the “moral extermination of one humble, solitary individual.” Theline-by-line attempts at rebuttal gave the whole effort a sanctimonious tone.Not without some reason, the editor of the Pennsylvania Freeman, Rush Plumbly,called Douglass’s tone a “whine of persecution.”48 [notes.html#ch12fn_48a]Douglass claimed that he had tried to sustain “honorable silence,” but the“assaults” had become unbearable, especially about his private affairs. Garrisonhad seen fit, wrote Douglass, “to invade my household, despise the sacredness ofmy home . . . to blast me in the name of my family.” His denial of any affairwith Julia took the form of a defense of Julia’s “eminent services” as hiscoworker, and a prolonged eight-part declaration that the “happiness orunhappiness” of his household was nobody’s business but his own. He denied theaffair as he continued to contend that he was under no obligation to do so.49[notes.html#ch12fn_49a]With thousands of highly charged words wielded as daggers to the heart in thissordid affair, inevitably it became racialized. With paternalistic pique,Garrison had argued that Douglass, as a former slave, could perhaps no longercomprehend the full demands of abolitionist leadership. “The antislavery cause,”said the founder, “both religiously and politically, has transcended the abilityof the sufferers from American slavery and prejudice as a class, to keep pacewith it or to perceive what are its demands or to understand its philosophy.”50[notes.html#ch12fn_50a] “Philosophy”? From the first days that Douglass’s earlyGarrisonian colleagues had tried to monitor and manage his thinking and hisactions, here was the attitude that Douglass had spent a decade resisting. Hepulled the arrow out of his chest and fired it right back at Garrison’s heart.Is it their own liberty that black people will next be told they do notcomprehend? he asked. This was an old subject for the former slave, but now hegave it new sting. For black folk, said Douglass, “every day and hour is crowdedwith lessons to them on the subject, to which the whites as a class arestrangers.” In effect he was saying to his old dear friend, if you want thisfight, I will destroy you. Personal insults and judgments about morality wereone thing, but an intellectual insult cut even deeper. “Who will doubthereafter,” Douglass anguished, “the natural inferiority of the Negro, when thegreat champion of the Negroes’ rights, thus broadly concedes all that is claimedrespecting the Negroes’ inferiority by the bitterest despisers of the Negrorace.” Douglass’s demolition of some of the Garrisonians’ accusations would haveleft an open-minded reader wondering just who were the “egotists” or the“alienated spirits” in this row.51 [notes.html#ch12fn_51a]The tragic dimension of this mutual self-destruction is manifest in suchexchanges between two men who had loved and served each other, who had learnedso much from each other, the one a father figure and the other a prodigal son ina life-affirming cause. But words can kill, and sometimes love and hate ridetogether. It is an ancient story, fated and repeated down through the ages invariations on Abraham and Isaac or Cain and Abel. Both Douglass and Garrisonlived to see their travail redeemed a decade later in the freedom of the slaves,even if they fundamentally never made up.In November–December 1853 as the Garrison-Douglass war came to its baroqueconclusions, both protagonists paid separate visits to Harriet Beecher Stowe,newly ascendant to extraordinary literary fame. Although political crises andbroader events overtook the petty inhumanities of the breakup, Stowe took itupon herself to call a truce. In November, Garrison had exchanged long letterswith Stowe over her objections to the tone and theological outlook of theLiberator and some of its agents. She had worried that the unrelenting criticismof churches, ministers, and proslavery religion carried on by Garrisonians would“take from poor Uncle Tom his Bible.” Stowe wanted peace in the ranks. OnDecember 19 she wrote to Garrison of her recent face-to-face meeting withDouglass. She admitted to earlier contributing to gossip about Douglass’spersonal life. She now found Douglass most impressive; he did not seem“malignant or revengeful” and had only been caught up in a “temporaryexcitement.” Douglass must have charmed the observant author. Poignantly, shedescribed Douglass’s ideas as the “growth from the soil of his own mind . . .and not a twig broken off other men’s thoughts.” She thought him no more toblame than his accusers. “Where is this work of excommunication to end?” Stowedemanded. She found all “allusion to his family concerns” “unjustifiable.” Shepleaded with Garrison for silence and suggested tellingly that “what Douglass isreally, time will show.” Presciently, Stowe scolded Garrison: what he had “castaside as worthless” would one day “be a treasure.”52 [notes.html#ch12fn_52a]Stowe seemed to be telling Garrison what he ought to know—that genius oftenmakes superhuman demands on tolerance.In this wrenching period of his bitterly public split with Garrison, Douglasshad thrown himself into the worlds of political abolitionism. Through physicaland emotional collapses, and through the ever-invigorating and debilitatinglecturing tours, he found the time and repose to assist numerous fugitive slavestoward their liberty, to begin a sustained and brilliant critique of the SlavePower in national affairs, to write his first work of fiction for Griffiths’sAutographs for Freedom, and to now craft the greatest speech of his life at theinvitation of her Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Society of Rochester."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 13--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLONI have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out,and to pull down . . . to build, and to plant.—JEREMIAH 1:10Frederick Douglass had learned the hard way that oppression, loss, and anger hadto be controlled and braced with knowledge if a former slave with anextraordinary mind was to survive in the United States. He was a man of thenineteenth century, a thoroughgoing inheritor of Enlightenment ideas, but forjustification, and for the story in which to embed the experience of Americanslaves, he reached for the Old Testament Hebrew prophets of the sixth to eighthcenturies BC. Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel were his companions, a confoundingbut inspiring source of intellectual and emotional control. Their great andterrible stories provided Douglass the deepest well of metaphor and meaning forhis increasingly ferocious critique of his own country. Their Jerusalem, theirtemple, their Israelites transported in the Babylonian Captivity, their oraclesto the nation of the woe to be inflicted upon them by a vengeful God for theircrimes, were his American “republic,” his “bleeding children of sorrow,” hiswarnings of desolations soon to visit his own guilty land.1[notes01.html#ch13fn_1a] Their story was ancient and modern; it gave the weightof the ages to his cause. Their awesome narratives of destruction andapocalyptical renewal, exile and return, provided scriptural basis for hismission to convince Americans they must undergo the same. The Old Testamentprophets helped make Douglass a great ironist and a great storyteller; theyfueled his growing militancy and brought pathos and thunder to his voice as theyalso shaped his view of history itself. Douglass not only used the Hebrewprophets; he joined them.The Hebrew prophets delivered their sayings and poems orally in publicgatherings. Whether Douglass understood this or not, it makes his oratorical useof the jeremiadic tradition all the more poignant. As Isaiah “came . . . andsaid,” and Jeremiah followed God’s call to “go and cry in the ears ofJerusalem,” so Douglass proclaimed antislavery oracles to vast public audiencesin proslavery America. God had visited Jeremiah and instructed him, “Behold, Ihave put My words in your mouth,” and given him his calling. Beginning with theblack churches he attended in Baltimore, where he would have first heardpreaching on the Exodus story, Douglass had reached that moment as well. He wasan American Jeremiah chastising the flock as he also called them back to theircovenants and creeds. Moreover, Douglass, like other American writers andorators from the Puritans to modern times, found his own way to comprehend aswell as rewrite Old Testament narratives, in the words of biblical scholarRobert Alter, as both “sacred history” and “prose fiction,” as models ofliterary style and a national story. And as the Jewish theologian AbrahamHeschel wrote, “Prophets must have been shattered by some cataclysmic experiencein order to be able to shatter others.”2 [notes01.html#ch13fn_2a] By thisstandard, Douglass qualified.• • •In early summer 1852, surrounded by rumors about his relationship with JuliaGriffiths, suffering periodically with ill health, and embroiled in his fightwith the Garrisonians, Douglass was invited by the Rochester Ladies’Anti-Slavery Society to deliver a Fourth of July address in the majesticCorinthian Hall, only a few blocks from the North Star’s office. Maria G. Porterwas president and Griffiths the secretary of the society, which in late Marchhad raised $233 at a festival to support Douglass’s newspaper. The societysponsored a regular series of antislavery lectures in Corinthian Hall, announcedby Griffiths in Douglass’s paper. In accepting the invitation, he insisted ondelivering the speech on July 5, which had long been a practice among New YorkState African American communities. In the South, moreover, slave auctions hadoften been conducted on July 4, further sullying the date in African Americanmemory. The Fourth fell on a Sunday, and for that reason also the Rochesteritesmoved it to Monday. For at least three weeks in advance of the event Douglassworked hard on the text, as well as personally promoting the event in his paper.He clearly aimed the speech not only at his local audience but beyond the hallto the nation at large. Immediately after the oration he had it printed in bulkand sold it in his paper as well as out on the lecture circuit at fifty centsper copy, or $6 per hundred.3 [notes01.html#ch13fn_3a] What Douglass crafted anddelivered on July 5 was nothing less than the rhetorical masterpiece of Americanabolitionism.Nearly six hundred people packed Corinthian Hall on that warm July day; a “granddinner” was prepared by the Ladies’ Society for after the speech. The beautifuledifice, which took its name from four Corinthian columns adorning the highfront wall, had just opened in 1849 and was Rochester’s most prestigious venuefor concerts, lectures, balls, and fairs. Four great chandeliers hung from thehigh ceiling, and tall windows on both sides admitted plentiful natural light.The buzz of mass conversation quickly fell silent as local abolitionist JamesSperry called the meeting to order. The Reverend S. Ottman of Rush, New York,delivered a prayer, then the Reverend Robert R. Raymond of Syracuse performed areading of the Declaration of Independence. Without introduction, sporting hishigh white collar, vested suit, and large mane of hair carefully parted,Frederick Douglass stepped forward, his hands slightly trembling with thethirty-page text he held.4 [notes01.html#ch13fn_4a]Image [../images/f0230-01.jpg]Corinthian Hall, Rochester, New York, 1850s. Lithograph.In a conventional apologia audiences came to expect, he began quietly with adisclaimer of his ability to address such an august assembly: he had neverappeared more “shrinkingly” before an audience. He knew such disclaimers weretaken by his auditors as “flat and unmeaning,” but he begged their indulgence ofhis awareness that this was something special; he knew he spoke in the house ofhis friends, whom he now used as stand-ins for the nation. In an old move offalse self-deprecation, he said the “distance between this platform and theslave plantation, from which I escaped, is considerable” and left him with a“quailing sensation.” Wishing he had had time for more “elaborate preparation”and more formal “learning,” Douglass finally reached his subject.5[notes01.html#ch13fn_5a] Invited to participate in a celebration of Americanindependence, Douglass delivered a political sermon, steeped in the Jeremiahtradition.Douglass’s Fourth of July speech came in the midst of many turbulent contexts.Douglass faced the personal crises of his own life just discussed, and UncleTom’s Cabin had become an instant phenomenon. For nearly two years free blacksand their allies had defied the hated Fugitive Slave Act. Massive protestmeetings condemned a law that denied the right of habeas corpus and trial byjury to alleged fugitive slaves, as well as threatened the kidnapping of freepeople of color into slavery. Douglass himself had stepped up his assistance torunaway slaves in Rochester and participated in recent months in some of theclandestine rescues of fugitives across the North. Now, under the American flag,observed Douglass, so deep was the fear in Northern black communities thathundreds had fled to Canada like “a dark train going out of the land, as iffleeing from death.” In virtually every issue of his paper, Douglass and hisstaff ran articles and reports about kidnappings or escapes of “refugee” slavesin the North or into Canada.6 [notes01.html#ch13fn_6a] And as abolitioniststurned more toward violent means of resistance, and political parties began totear themselves asunder, the country faced another general election in thecoming fall.Douglass channeled all of this tension into a kind of music; his speech was likea symphony in three movements. In the first movement, Douglass set his audienceat ease by honoring the genius of the founding fathers. He called the Fourth ofJuly an American “Passover” and placed hope in the youthful nation, “stillimpressible” and open to change. “Three score years and ten is the allotted timefor individual men,” said the calm Douglass, “but nations number their years bythousands.” As he began a historical tribute to the bravery of the Americanrevolutionaries of 1776, subtly referencing Thomas Paine’s times that “triedmen’s souls,” he dropped hints of foreboding, of “dark clouds . . . above thehorizon . . . portending disastrous times.” He began with hope, though: “Thereis consolation in the thought that America is young. Great streams are noteasily turned from channels, worn deep in the course of ages.” Douglass calledthe Declaration of Independence the “RINGBOLT to the chain of your nation’sdestiny,” and the preamble the nation’s “saving principles.” With active,gleaming metaphors landing on his listeners in every spoken paragraph, the musicbecame louder. “From the round top of your ship of state, dark and threateningclouds may be seen,” Douglass sang. “Heavy billows, like mountains in thedistance, disclose to the leeward huge forms of flinty rocks! That bolt drawn,that chain broken, and all is lost. Cling to this day—cling to it, and to itsprinciples, with the grasp of a storm-tossed mariner to a spar at midnight.”7[notes01.html#ch13fn_7a]His baritone voice now projecting to the rear of the hall, Douglass had laid thegroundwork of prophetic irony in the first movement for the main argument tocome. The scene-setting beauty of the string instruments soon gave way tofull-throated horns and kettledrums. The warnings already lay in the politicizedpossessive pronouns: “your fathers,” “your national independence.” America’sstory of its founding in the Revolution and its aftermath was taught, Douglassintoned, in “your common schools, narrated at your firesides, unfolded from yourpulpits . . . as household words . . . the staple of your national poetry andeloquence.”8 [notes01.html#ch13fn_8a] A voice truly free and independent hadarrived.Then, as though slamming his fist down on the lectern, Douglass announced theshift to the second and longer movement of the symphony—a new version of thatnational poetry. Quoting Longfellow’s poem “A Psalm of Life,” he announced thathis concern was the present: “Trust no future however pleasant, / Let the deadpast bury its dead; Act, act in the living present, / Heart within, and Godoverhead.” As Douglass reminded his largely white audience of their national andpersonal declension, the speech found its theme—the hypocrisy of slavery andracism in a republic. He harkened to Genesis and Exodus and the twelve childrenof Jacob boasting of Abraham’s paternity but losing Abraham’s faith. This greathuman folly was both “ancient and modern,” Douglass proclaimed. The children ofIsrael “contented themselves under the shadow of Abraham’s great name, whilethey repudiated the deeds which made his name great.” For Americans, saidDouglass, George Washington was the Abraham of their new Israel; and thoughWashington had freed his slaves in his will, “his monument is built up by theprice of human blood, and the traders in the bodies and souls of men.”9[notes01.html#ch13fn_9a] Complicit in the oldest stories in their spiritual andnational lives, the audience sat primed for the onslaught to follow. The oracleturned wrathful.Now Douglass brought his hammer down even harder, and for approximately fourteenpages, the second and longest movement rained down like a hailstorm. He pulledno punches, making the good abolitionists and the Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Societysquirm as he dragged them through a litany of America’s contradictions.Second-person pronouns crashed into his singular “I.” “Fellow-citizens,” hefirmly stated, “pardon me, allow me to ask, why am I called upon to speak heretoday? What have I, or those I represent, to do with your nationalindependence?” Douglass personified all slaves, past and present. “I am notincluded within the pale of this glorious anniversary! This Fourth of July isyours, not mine. You may rejoice, I must mourn. To drag a man in fetters intothe grand illuminated temple of liberty, and call upon him to join you in joyousanthems, were inhuman mockery and sacrilegious irony. Do you mean, citizens, tomock me by asking me to speak today?” Then, in the most beautiful move in thespeech, he warns that “there is a parallel” as he flows unannounced back to thecaptivity of the ancient Jews in Psalm 137:By the Rivers of Babylon, there we sat down. Yea! we wept when we rememberedZion. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. For there, theythat carried us away captive, required of us a song; and they who wasted usrequired of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion. How can we singthe Lord’s song in a strange land? If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my righthand forget her cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to theroof of my mouth.Douglass’s answer to the summons? He would not sing any praise songs on thenation’s birthday. Instead, he recrafted Jeremiah’s tales of God’s wrath and thepeople’s mourning as he proclaimed, “Above your national, tumultuous joy, I hearthe mournful wail of millions! whose chains, heavy and grievous yesterday, aretoday, rendered more intolerable by the jubilee shouts that reach them.”10[notes01.html#ch13fn_10a]Douglass loved the Declaration of Independence, but since its principles werenatural rights, like the precious ores of the earth, he refused to argue fortheir existence or their righteousness against the claims of proslaveryideologues. “What point in the antislavery creed would you have me argue?” heasked. Why must he prove that the slave is human? Rather, Douglass claimed hisauthority from two great scriptures, “the Constitution and the Bible,” andannounced that “the time for argument is passed.” Instead, the Americancondition demanded “scorching irony.” Douglass had not come to Corinthian Hallfor polite discourse. “O! had I the ability, and could I reach the nation’s ear,I would today pour out a fiery stream of biting ridicule, blasting reproach,withering sarcasm, and stern rebuke. For it is not light that is needed, butfire; it is not the gentle shower, but thunder. We need the storm, thewhirlwind, and the earthquake. The feeling of the nation must be quickened . . .the hypocrisy of the nation must be exposed.”11 [notes01.html#ch13fn_11a] And sofor twenty-five minutes—the second movement—he did just that.Douglass poured out a litany of historical and contemporary evils caused byAmerican slavery. He did not merely call Americans hypocrites; he showed themand made them feel, see, and hear their “revolting barbarity” in aggressivelanguage. First, he delivered a thoroughgoing condemnation of the domestic slavetrade. As lyrical as it was terrible, Douglass made his audience look at the“human flesh-jobbers” who operated the slave markets, hear their “savage yellsand . . . blood-chilling oaths . . . the fetters clank . . . and the crack . . .sound of the slave-whip” and indeed “see” the slave mother’s “briny tearsfalling on the brow of the babe in her arms.” He forced them to “attend theauction” and look on the “shocking gaze of American slave-buyers.” No one coulddo this quite like Douglass, who personified the terror by telling of his ownmemories of hearing the “rattle of chains and the heart-rending cries” from theslave coffles along the docks of Baltimore.12 [notes01.html#ch13fn_12a]Douglass next blasted the Fugitive Slave Act and the proslavery stances ofAmerican churches. The new law demanding complicity by Northerners in theretrieval of fugitive slaves, he told his countrymen, transformed “your broadrepublican domain” into a “hunting ground for men.” Everyone must now practice“this hellish sport,” including “your President, your Secretary of State, yourlords, nobles, and ecclesiastics . . . as a duty you owe to your free andglorious country.” Withering sarcasm indeed. The sheer corruption of theFugitive Slave Act, which mandated paying commissioners double the money forconsigning a runaway back into slavery as opposed to allowing his freedom, couldonly be matched, said the orator, by the “flagrantly inconsistent” practices ofthe churches who willingly served as the “bodyguards of the tyrants of Virginiaand Carolina.” In Douglass’s unrelenting staccato labeling, the “tyrant-killing,king-hating, people-loving, democratic Christian defenders” of the FugitiveSlave Act were no better than the pious “scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites who paytithe of mint, anise, and cumin” at the temple rather than act with “mercy andfaith.” Far too many clergymen, said Douglass, mouthed the words of theDeclaration of Independence but in their religious practice only abetted the“tyrants, man-stealers and thugs.”13 [notes01.html#ch13fn_13a]So he pulled Isaiah from his arsenal and delivered what he believed the churchesdeserved: “Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; thenew moons and Sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it isiniquity . . . I am weary to bear them; and when ye spread forth your hands Iwill hide mine eyes from you. Yea! When you make many prayers, I will not hear,YOUR HANDS ARE FULL OF BLOOD; . . . cease to do evil, learn to do well; seekjudgment; relieve the oppressed.”14 [notes01.html#ch13fn_14a] Douglass bore thenews that the nation’s crimes stood condemned by the prophets of old in thepeople’s own sacred texts.Douglass brought the second movement to a close in classic, frighteningjeremiadic style. After one final long list of the ways slavery “brands yourrepublicanism as a sham, your humanity as a base pretense, and your Christianitya lie,” he begged his audience and the nation to break loose from their doombefore it was too late. “Oh! be warned! be warned!” he shouted. “A horriblereptile is coiled up in your nation’s bosom; the venomous creature is nursing atthe tender breast of your youthful republic; for the love of God, tear away, andfling from you the hideous monster, and let the weight of twenty millions crushand destroy it forever!”15 [notes01.html#ch13fn_15a] With such urgency andterrifying imagery Douglass took a breath and paused.The short and final third movement began calmly with a firm embrace of theantislavery interpretation of the Constitution. That charter, though full ofpotential double meanings, was in Douglass’s view “a GLORIOUS LIBERTY DOCUMENT”full of “principles and purposes, entirely hostile to the existence of slavery.”There was still time to act, and legal and moral tools aplenty for hiscountrymen to save themselves. In a move common in the American jeremiad,Douglass ended with visions of hope. He counseled faith in three elements thathad now taken root in his thought. First was the antislavery interpretation ofthe Constitution. Second was his oft-expressed belief in Divine Providence, inthe idea that a moral force would in the end govern human affairs. Seeking againhis justification in Isaiah, he confidently asserted, “There are forces inoperation, which must inevitably work the downfall of slavery. ‘The arm of theLord is not shortened,’ and the doom of slavery is certain.” And third, heappealed to the “tendencies of the age” to modernity. “Change has now come overthe affairs of mankind. The arm of commerce has borne away the gates of thestrong city. Intelligence is penetrating the darkest corners of the globe. . . .Wind, steam, and lightning are its chartered agents. Oceans no longer divide,but link nations together. . . . Space is comparatively annihilated. Thoughtsexpressed on one side of the Atlantic are distinctly heard on the other.” Keepfaith, he urged Rochester and the nation at large, slavery could not hide from“light” itself.16 [notes01.html#ch13fn_16a]Having paid a kind of homage to Gerrit Smith with the fulsome statement on theConstitution, Douglass breathed one more famous passage from the Psalms into hisown rhythms and on behalf of his race: “Ethiopia shall stretch out her hand untoGod.” Then, remarkably, he paid an even fuller homage to Garrison and ended thespeech with four verses of the abolitionist’s poem “The Triumph of Freedom,” atestimony of radical biblical devotion to cause:God speed the year of JubileeThe wide world o’er! . . .Until that year, day, hour arrive . . .With head, and heart, and hand I’ll strive.In both secular and sacred terms, prescient in its vision and powerful in itsunforgettable language, Douglass had delivered one of the greatest speeches ofAmerican history. He had transcended his audience as well as Corinthian Hall,into a realm inhabited by great art that would last long after he and thishistory were gone. He had explained the nation’s historical condition and,through the pain of his indictment and the force of his altar call, illuminateda path to a better day. Douglass the ironist had never been in better form as heconverted collective suffering into something like national hope. As Douglasslifted his text from the podium and took his seat, nearly six hundred whiteNortherners stood and roared with “a universal burst of applause.”17[notes01.html#ch13fn_17a]• • •Douglass’s Fourth of July Address, and his political thought generally in the1850s, are often remembered and interpreted for their “nearly always hopeful”character, as August Meier once put it. But this assessment hardly captureseither the ideological transformations Douglass underwent or the tone, method,and spiritual resolve of his major speeches and writings. The making of Douglassas a political abolitionist in the 1850s should be grounded in the prophetictradition in which he came to see himself. His was a kind of radical hope in thetheory of natural rights, and in a Christian millennialist view of history ashumankind’s grand story, punctuated by terrible ruptures followed by potentialregenerations.18 [notes01.html#ch13fn_18a]The idea of prophecy is unsettling to the modern secular imagination. But therhetorical, spiritual, and historical traditions on which Douglass drew sodeeply envisioned the prophet as a messenger of God’s warnings and wisdom. Thepoetic oracles of Isaiah or Jeremiah, however bleak or foreboding, wereprophetic speech, and therefore God’s voice. Douglass, a man of words, needed alanguage and a story in which to find himself and his enslaved people. Althoughhe never portrayed himself as literally a messenger of God, he found such alanguage in the Hebrew prophets in whose words, as the theologian AbrahamHeschel writes, “the invisible God becomes audible.” The “words the prophetutters are not offered as souvenirs,” wrote Heschel. “He undertakes to stop amighty stream with mere words.” In Old Testament tradition the prophets werereluctant messengers; God chose them and not the other way around. God spokethrough the burdened Jeremiah, who wrote hauntingly, “But his word was in mineheart as burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, andI could not stay.” Douglass felt this same fire of the words in his bones thatmust get out, although he was never so good at playing the reluctant visionary.The Old Testament prophets fit with Douglass’s temperament and his predicament.As James Darsey argues, “It is precisely because the prophet engages his societyover its most central and fundamental values that he is radical.” Thus prophetsare rarely welcome friends; they are always trouble to other people’sconsciences. They are companions, but not easy companions. They are not“reasonable,” says Darsey; they do not abide “compromise,” and their role in theworld is that of a sacred “extremist.”19 [notes01.html#ch13fn_19a] In the 1850s,Douglass relished and tried to perform just such a role.American Jeremiahs wove the secular and sacred together in their repeatedwarnings and appeals for higher strivings. As a rhetorical device and as aconception of America, the jeremiad was as flexible as it was pervasive.America’s “prophets of doom” thwarted despair and alienation in the temporalvastness and redemptive destiny of their New Israel. Yet this was never theresult of a mere temperamental optimism, a flimsy substitute for the kind ofhope Douglass forged through enslavement, despair, violence, and his favoritebiblical prophets. The land of Judah, after all, lay in utter ruin before Godsaw fit to redeem Jacob, to offer answers to whether there was “a balm inGilead,” or finally a promise that “there is hope in thine end . . . that thinechildren shall come again to their own border.” For a man who frequentlyreinvented himself, Douglass saw America in dire need of the sametransformation. He had read those prophets as he came to see himself, in someways, as their descendant exiled in a new Babylon. And his people needed a storyto believe in, one with the “radical hope,” as Michael Walzer has argued,contained in the Exodus story. “Exodus is a model for messianic and millenarianthought,” writes Walzer, “and it is also a standing alternative to it—a secularand historical account of ‘redemption’ . . . that does not require themiraculous transformation of the material world but sets God’s people marchingthrough the world toward a better place in it.”20 [notes01.html#ch13fn_20a] Forblack Americans, Exodus is always contemporary, history always past and present.Douglass was no formal theologian, but his political hope was hard earned, andhe relished the ancient stories in which to find purpose. He did not sit backawaiting God’s entry into history; he argued for it in endless variations on theExodus story. By the early to mid-1850s, he forged a worldview from thesebiblical roots, from Enlightenment doctrine, especially natural rights, and inthe face of several issues and events through which he defined himself. Firstwas the never-ending question of colonization—whether black people could beinduced to voluntarily leave the United States and return to Africa—a matterthrust back into the faces of abolitionists in 1849 by Henry Clay and theAmerican Colonization Society’s renewed embrace of the strategy.From December 1850 into February 1851, Douglass delivered a series of formalSunday lectures in Corinthian Hall. The furor over the passage of the FugitiveSlave Act as well as other issues compelled him to try his hand at such aseries, which he intended, as he told Gerrit Smith, to “publish . . . in bookform.” The hall was nearly packed on at least nine Sundays in these wintermonths, and Douglass approached his subjects—the nature of slavery itself,fugitive slaves and resistance, the “Slave Power” in the federal government, andcolonization—with his usual rhetorical flare and humor, but also now withresearch. Douglass eagerly used his neighbors, friends, and curiosity seekers totry out his chops as the political commentator he had already become in thepages of his newspaper. “We are in the midst of a great struggle,” he announcedin the opening lecture. “The public mind is widely and deeply agitated; andbubbling up from its perturbed waters . . . whose poisonous miasma demands aconstant antidote.”21 [notes01.html#ch13fn_21a]By late January of 1851 his topic was colonization because Congress, the press,and Clay himself had “breathed upon the dry bones” of the scheme and given itanother life. Since his earliest days of reading the Liberator, Douglass hadencountered the colonization issue. Almost nothing prompted his ire quite likethe recurring machinations of colonizationists, who could only imagine anAmerican future through the impulse, as he put it, of “out with the Negroes.”When Clay and the American Colonization Society (ACS) announced a plan forvoluntary removal to Africa by free blacks, by a line of steamers financed bythe federal government, Douglass turned anger into opportunity. He hated allversions of colonization because it cut to the heart of American racism—theassumptions about African Americans’ inferiority, and their inability to copeand compete in a white-dominated society. Douglass saw everything at stake inthe colonization debate. It did not matter to him whether the advocacy ofcolonizing blacks outside of America came from the great moderate slaveholdingWhig Clay; the crusading antislavery journalist and editor of the New YorkTribune Horace Greeley; Douglass’s former friend and coworker Martin Delany, whoby 1852 launched a campaign for American blacks to emigrate to Central Africa orthe Caribbean; or from Abraham Lincoln in 1861–62. Douglass considered it all“diabolical” at its core. He spared no words in his condemnations. The ACS hadexisted since 1816 as the “offender . . . and slanderer of the colored people,”its schemes only a plot to remove blacks from society. To Douglass colonizationwas never anything but “Satan” with the “power to transform himself into anangel of light—to assume the beautiful garments of innocence.” Even to a friendof abolition such as Greeley, Douglass declared in 1852 that colonization in anyguise meant “ultimate extermination” for his people.22 [notes01.html#ch13fn_22a]On this grievance and others Douglass demonstrated that he would not merelydenounce the issue but analyze it. He would mix his Old Testament rebukes withargument, wit, and exposition. In a February 1851 speech, “Colonization Cant,”Douglass made his aims explicit as a political critic. He had two choices forhow to wield his pen and voice: “One is to denounce, in strong and burningwords, such theories and practices.” This would be the “easiest and commonest.”But the other was to “illustrate and expose, by careful analysis.” Even when hemay have felt weak against such powers as the largest-circulation newspaper inAmerica (Greeley’s Tribune) or the longtime standard-bearer of the Whig Party(Clay), Douglass loved this kind of rhetorical contest. He expanded his reading,followed congressional debates closely, and laid down a brilliant testimonyabout both the injustice and the absurdity of colonization. He marshaledstatistics about the growth and stability of the free black population in theNorthern states and recommended Clay and his “pious” associates consult Exodus1:10–12. As the children of Israel were made captive, their oppressors werecalled “to deal wisely with them lest they multiply . . . therefore they did setover them taskmasters, to afflict them with their burdens. . . . But the morethey afflicted them, the more they multiplied, and grew.”23[notes01.html#ch13fn_23a]When Clay argued in Congress that removing blacks from the country “with theirown consent” was the “great project” of the age, Douglass assaulted Clay’s logicby suggesting that the republican revolutions of 1848 in Europe, building atranscontinental railroad across North America, land reform to end poverty theworld over, and the effort to establish international arbitration to settle andend wars might rank higher. He shattered Clay’s notion of expecting black folks’“consent” for removal. In the Kentuckian’s apparent regard for black peoplerested the real evil, as Douglass summoned Shakespeare’s Henry VIII to make hispoint: “My Lord, my Lord, I am much . . . too weak / To oppose your cunning; youare meek and humble-mouthed; / You sign your place and calling in full seeming,/ With meekness and humility; but your heart / Is crammed with arrogancy, spleenand pride.” Oh, that history might have given us a public debate betweenDouglass and Clay. The black abolitionist was unrelenting: “If a highway-robbershould at the pistol’s mouth demand my purse, it is possible that I should‘consent’ to give it up. If a midnight incendiary should fire my dwelling, Idoubt not I should readily ‘consent’ to leave it.” In such an imagined debate wecan see the warring assumptions that were tearing America apart. “Thehighway-robber has his method,” Douglass declared, “the torturous and wilypolitician has his.”24 [notes01.html#ch13fn_24a]• • •A second, and even more ascendant, issue around which Douglass forged hispolitical consciousness was resistance to the Fugitive Slave Act and the uses ofviolence. Deep in his soul, Douglass had never relinquished his belief in theright of physical resistance. But nothing had ever forced him to clarify hisprinciples like the reality of the Fugitive Slave law. From his home in westernNew York, and so close to the northern border, Douglass remembered watchingcountless fugitives “suddenly alarmed and compelled to flee to Canada.” This“dismal march,” as he called it, was a large exodus: an estimated twentythousand blacks may have moved to Canada in the 1850s. In the fall of 1850,Douglass even reported that a “party of manhunters” had come to Rochesterintending to seize him and wrest him back to slavery. He admitted to worryingwhether his bill of sale and freedom letter from Hugh Auld would withstand legalchallenge if he was seized. In speeches Douglass made great use of this threat.For a time, he said, he held up in a “loft, or garret” in his house, havingalerted local friends to be watchful. The confrontation never happened, butDouglass made it clear, whether with firearms or other lethal weapons, he wasprepared to “greet them . . . with a hospitality befitting the place andoccasion.” To a cheering audience in Boston on October 14, 1850, he urged allNorthern blacks to be “resolved rather to die than to go back.” If a slavecatcher sought to take the slave back, shouted Douglass, he “will be murdered inyour streets.” This was a new rhetoric born of a new reality; the man of wordsnow found himself at the center of a crisis in which there were “blows to takeas well as blows to give.”25 [notes01.html#ch13fn_25a]Image [../images/f0241-01.jpg]“Practical Illustration of the Fugitive Slave Law,” Currier & Ives cartoon,1852. Note Douglass’s presence in the cartoon as part of the violent resistancewith Garrison.In a speech in Syracuse in early 1851, “Resistance to Blood-Houndism,” Douglassheightened the rhetoric. At a convention where Garrisonians attacked Douglass’sviolent language as the “blood and murder” approach, he found allies among thefew Liberty Party loyalists attending. “I am a peace man,” Douglass announcedsomewhat disingenuously. “But this convention ought to say to slaveholders thatthey are in danger of bodily harm if they come here, and attempt to carry menoff to bondage.” He pleaded with his fellow abolitionists, most of them moralsuasionists who had long preferred to “frown slaveholders down,” that theyshould seek “nothing short of the blood” of any slave catcher in their midst.The slaveholder who chooses the role of “bloodhound,” he continued, had “noright to live.” With bravado, Douglass spoke words that would stick to hischanging reputation forever: “I do believe that two or three dead slaveholderswill make this law a dead letter.” Such language had always been latent in thestorehouse of Douglass’s personal memory; now it burst out with stunning furor,although he provided little advice on just how such a response was to beorganized.26 [notes01.html#ch13fn_26a]Douglass had learned much from the Hebrew prophets, but in proslavery America hefelt torn between their mixed messages on violence and war. He loved Isaiah’sbrilliant condemnations of war; beating “swords into plowshares” is one of themost profound pleas in world literature. But he also harkened to the truth inJeremiah’s injunction that in Babylon God’s “golden cup” of woe had made thenations “drunk” and “mad.”27 [notes01.html#ch13fn_27a] Just when was righteousviolence a necessary evil, or even a good? The American Babylon now challengedthe radical reformer to decide when vengeance was not only the best strategy,but right.Many blacks and their white abolitionist allies did not need Douglass’sprovocations to take to the streets to resist the law or rescue fugitives.Indeed, since the 1830s blacks in Northern cities and towns, from Boston toPittsburgh and Philadelphia to Detroit, had organized in Vigilance Committees toprotect fugitive slaves. Their leaders, such as David Ruggles in New York, whowas so instrumental in Douglass’s own escape in 1838, had fought in the courtsto secure former slaves’ freedom, as well as organized clandestine rescues ofrunaways seized by captors. Douglass paid tribute to these brave pioneers ofresistance in an 1851 speech, naming some and honoring their courage to act aslong as “a single slave clanked his chain in the land.” And in an October 1851column in his paper, Douglass called the Fugitive Slave Act the “hydra . . .begotten in the spirit of compromise,” which assumed the “cowardly negro” whowould not fight. But on the contrary, such “legalized piracy” had made the“government . . . their enemy.” He predicted that “the land will be filled withviolence and blood till this law is repealed.”28 [notes01.html#ch13fn_28a] Fromlate 1850 to 1854 numerous attempts were made to rescue former slaves from thegrips of police powers, some violent, and with mixed success.All across the North in black communities people held meetings and passedresolutions vowing resistance to slave catchers with “the most deadly weapons.”A new spirit of defiance fed on actual rescues of fugitives. Douglass cheeredthe news of the successful action in Boston in February 1851 when a Virginiafugitive, Shadrack Minkins, was rescued and spirited off to Canada. The outcomefor Thomas Sims in April was not as good. A fugitive from Georgia, Sims wasjailed and quickly convicted as white Massachusetts abolitionists workedunsuccessfully either to rescue or bribe him out of custody in Boston. He wasreturned to slavery even as hung juries refused to convict the many rescuers puton trial for the Minkins rescue. A rescue Douglass celebrated widely was that ofJerry Henry in Syracuse, New York, on October 1, 1851, where a mob born of aLiberty Party convention occurring in that city stormed a jailhouse and brokethe fugitive out and took him to Canada. A large police dragnet andinvestigation led to some twenty-six indictments; no one was convicted, however,by local juries, and of those charged, among the twelve blacks, nine escaped toCanada and were never tried. Because it occurred closer to his own terrain inupstate New York, Douglass made the “Jerry Rescue” a staple of editorials andplatform rhetoric as he built the case for the natural right of violentresistance to a law so at odds with human liberty.29 [notes01.html#ch13fn_29a]Just before the Jerry Henry rescue, in September 1851, Douglass got his ownopportunity to directly aid fugitives escaping after violent resistance. At the“Christiana Riot,” which occurred in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, onSeptember 11, a slaveowner, Edward Gorsuch, of Baltimore County, Maryland,attempted at gunpoint to retrieve several of his escaped slaves. In and aroundan isolated farmhouse, William Parker, a twenty-nine-year-old local blackactivist and himself a former fugitive slave from Maryland, led a crowd, somewith pitchforks and some with guns, to defend the runaways. Parker had forseveral years led a self-protection society in Lancaster County that fought torescue fugitive slaves from their pursuers. Gorsuch was shot dead in the meleein Christiana and his son badly wounded. Parker, astute and knowledgeable ofDouglass’s work in helping fugitives into Canada, quickly led two of thedesperate slaves, named Alexander Pinckney and Abraham Johnson, on a two-day,five-hundred-mile journey by foot, horse-drawn carriage, and train toRochester.30 [notes01.html#ch13fn_30a]Fugitive slaves running through western New York frequently ended up onDouglass’s doorstep. Just as Parker and his charges arrived, and Anna fed andarranged sleeping quarters for them in the house, the news of the Christianabloodshed arrived in Douglass’s hands via the telegraph and the New Yorknewspapers. Great anxiety overtook the household, Douglass recalled. He wrote ashort note to his neighbor Samuel Porter asking for help: “There are three mennow at my house—who are in great peril. I am unwell. I need your advice. Pleasecome at once.” Julia Griffiths too had been sick, she wrote on September 24 in aletter to Gerrit Smith, reporting recent “great excitement in our house” aboutthe Christiana fugitives. Douglass and his small team acted decisively in thislittle corner of what was already widely called the Underground Railroad. “Idispatched my friend Miss Julia Griffiths to the landing three miles away on theGenesee River,” he wrote in Life and Times, “to ascertain if a steamer wouldleave that night for any port in Canada.” Douglass drove the three men in his“Democrat carriage” (a small three-seat buggy) to the landing, which is where hefeared trouble from officers hot on their trail. He arrived with fifteen minutesto spare before departure. Douglass always remembered this episode with specialpride and drama. “I remained on board till the order to haul in the gangplank,”wrote Douglass. “I shook hands with my friends, received from Parker therevolver that fell from the hand of Gorsuch when he died, presented now as atoken of gratitude and a memento of the battle for liberty at Christiana, and Ireturned to my home with a sense of relief.”31 [notes01.html#ch13fn_31a] Thatgun remained a sacred talisman in the Douglass family.When Parker and his small troupe reached Kingston and Toronto, they found blackcommunities rather reticent to embrace them because news had spread of theirdeeds and that lawmen were in hot pursuit. Parker contrasted suchself-protective fear among Canadian blacks, also largely fugitives, to the“self-sacrificing spirit of our Rochester colored brother [Douglass], who madehaste to welcome us to his ample home.”32 [notes01.html#ch13fn_32a] In theirbrief encounter, brothers in arms, Douglass and Parker forged a bond ofexperience.In Douglass’s own early account of the Christiana event, published in his paperon September 25, it was as if he had found the African American equivalent ofthe Battle of Lexington and Concord in the American Revolution. In Parker andChristiana he had a new character and event to exalt. His “Freedom’s Battle atChristiana” is at once a brilliant piece of propaganda, astute reporting, and amythic testament designed to give the resistance movement bold inspiration.Douglass mocked the proslavery public that seemed shocked that “hunted menshould fight with the biped bloodhounds” and kill them out of self-defense.“Didn’t they know that slavery, not freedom, is their natural condition? Didn’tthey know that their legs, arms, eyes, hands, and heads were the rightfulproperty of the white men who claimed them?” He portrayed Christiana and thewhole universe of dread and violence caused by the Fugitive Slave Act as a kindof theater of the absurd. Americans did not hunt “fox, wolf, and the bear”anymore. Hunting men, said Douglass, had become the official “choice-game, thepeculiar game of this free and Christian country.” Such hunters had stepped outof the natural “orbit” of humanity and therefore had “no right to live.” In hisre-creation of the Christiana affair, based apparently on his brief interviewswith Parker and the other two fugitives, Douglass fashioned a dramatic dialoguebetween Gorsuch and Parker in their lengthy “parley” at the farmhouse. Gorsuchdemanded his “property,” and Parker spoke as from a natural-rights treatisesaying, “There is no property here but what belongs to me. . . . I own everytrunk chair or article of furniture.” Parker lectures Gorsuch about how “it is asin to own men,” as Gorsuch’s son fires the first shot, which misses Parker.33[notes01.html#ch13fn_33a]Douglass converted the entire story into an argument for natural rights,especially after the news came that some thirty blacks and two whites werecaptured and to be indicted for “treason” in the case. “The basis of allegianceis protection,” wrote Douglass. The only law a slave could acknowledge was the“law of nature.” “In the light of the law, a slave can no more commit treasonthan a horse or an ox can commit treason.” Then he all but thanked the legalauthorities of Pennsylvania for the charge of treason against the Christianarioters because, he said, “it admits our manhood.”34 [notes01.html#ch13fn_34a]Douglass always knew when he had irony, if not the law, on his side.• • •A relative lull ensued in anti–Fugitive Slave Act rescues during 1852 and 1853.But the furor resumed with new intensity in the spring of 1854 in Boston withthe seizure, trial, and return to Virginia of a fugitive named Anthony Burns.The Franklin Pierce administration in Washington, as well as Massachusetts stateofficials, especially Democrats, made a test case of Burns as they determined toenforce the Act of 1850. Before Burns was finally marched down Boston streetsthat were draped in mourning by the black community and guarded by severalthousand federal troops, a major effort was made to rescue him, resulting in thedeath of one deputy US marshal, James Batchelder, a local truckman hired as aguard. Although the Burns case was a short-term failure for abolitionism, itbecame a cause célèbre across the country. During 1852–53 Douglass had kept up asteady drumbeat of attacks on the Fugitive Slave Act. At the Free Soil Partyconvention in August 1852 he called for “half a dozen or more dead kidnapperscarried down South” to keep slaveholders’ “rapacity in check.” He wanted bodycounts, and lest the “lines of eternal justice” be “obliterated,” he called for“deepening their traces with the blood of tyrants.” America had become polarizedby the fugitive-slave crisis; even some Garrisonians began to talk of violence.“The line between freedom and slavery in this country is tightly drawn,”Douglass argued by early 1852, “and the combatants on either side . . . fighthand to hand. . . . There is no neutral ground here for any man.”35[notes01.html#ch13fn_35a] He became his own kind of self-styled war propagandistlong before 1861.In the wake of the Burns case Douglass penned a much-discussed editorial, “Is ItRight and Wise to Kill a Kidnapper?” He had been answering this questionaffirmatively for years, but here he claimed the high ground of “moralphilosophy.” The natural law of self-defense against aggressors or kidnappers,Douglass argued, carried the same power as the “law of gravitation.” But thiswas about human actions and not gravitational pull. So when “monsters”deliberately violate the liberty of a fellow human, other men are justified inkilling them if necessary. Further, he contended, if government failed toprotect the “just rights of an individual man,” then “his friends” may exercise“any right” to defend him.36 [notes01.html#ch13fn_36a]Douglass dove foursquare into American racial reality. He felt no sympathy forthe slain Boston man who got in the way, nor even for his widow. By becoming thehired “bloodhound” Batchelder made “himself the common enemy of mankind, and hisslaughter was as innocent, in the sight of God, as would be the slaughter of aravenous wolf in the act of throttling an infant. We hold that he had forfeitedhis right to live, and that his death was necessary.” But Douglass went evenfurther. This was a public death and was not done as a last resort; rather, itemerges in Douglass’s logic as a first resort, an aggressive use of violence tomake a political statement. He argued that the killing in defense of Burns wouldlift the label of “submission” from the heads of black people. They needed thisdeed for their self-respect. An image in the American mind, Douglass asserted,had to be destroyed—that of fugitives who “quietly cross their hands, adjusttheir ankles to be chained, and march off unhesitatingly to the hell ofslavery.” In the public mind, he said, such behavior was judged “their normalcondition.” But no longer. “This reproach must be wiped out, and nothing shortof resistance on the part of colored men, can wipe it out. Every slaveholder whomeets a bloody death . . . is an argument in favor of the manhood of our race.Resistance is, therefore, wise as well as just.”37 [notes01.html#ch13fn_37a]Douglass harbored no moral ambivalence about violence now; he demanded deadslave catchers as recognition and revitalization of black humanity.Douglass’s harsh, masculine case became both primal and philosophical, burstingfrom his embittered heart. In the fugitive-slave crisis, Douglass counseledkilling kidnappers, and slaveholders generally, because it enhanced theself-respect and “manhood” of his people. His was a position of a gendered moralquicksand, but also astute, political revolutionary violence. He had once foughtCovey in a last resort for self-respect. Now he advocated a much largerviolence, with greater political meaning, and as a first resort. Douglass nowbelieved in killing slave catchers and slaveholders; the means to such an endwere the strategic and moral challenge. He had long laid out deeper and olderjustifications for such violence than he offered in the 1854 editorial. In manyspeeches he had limned the old prophets as his steady keel in these troubledwaters. Over and over again in 1853 and 1854, Douglass used Isaiah 57:20–21 tomake his case: “But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,whose waters cast up mire and dirt. There is no peace, said my God, to thewicked.” Douglass made this holy writ his own kind of oracle in New York in May1853, in a speech entitled “No Peace for the Slaveholder.” The machinations ofthe Slave Power, he contended, were “done to give peace to slavery. That cannotbe done. Peace to the slaveholder! He can have no peace. ‘No peace to thewicked, saith my God.’ ” For Douglass this was a matter of faith and politicalmotivation. The nation may act so “our southern brethren may have peace,” hetold a Manchester, New Hampshire, audience in January 1854. But “they haveundertaken to do what God Almighty has declared cannot be done.”38[notes01.html#ch13fn_38a] The violent imagination desperately needed authorityand precedent. And a new prophet dearly needed the old ones.• • •Sometime in February 1853 Douglass paid a visit to Andover, Massachusetts, atthe home of Harriet Beecher Stowe. In an extraordinary column, “A Day and aNight in ‘Uncle Tom’s Cabin,’ ” the editor wrote of the encounter as a magicalexperience. Not yet a year in circulation, Stowe’s book had reached “theuniversal soul of humanity,” Douglass said. He crafted an extraordinary portraitof Stowe. She was at first impression an “ordinary” woman, but in conversationshe exhibited a “splendid genius,” a “keen and quiet wit,” and an “exalted senseof justice.” Douglass had many models as a writer and orator; but he may havefound a new one. With Stowe, he observed, “the words are . . . subordinate tothe thought—not the thought to the words. You listen to her rather than to herlanguage.” As she talked, he remembered her eyes flashing with “especialbrilliance.” The inspiration, Douglass said, was “not unlike that experiencedwhen contemplating the ocean waves upon the velvet strand.” As though practicinghis own fictional chops, the editor continued, “You see them silentlyforming—rising—rolling and increasing in speed, till, all at once they aregloriously capped in sparkling beauty.” Douglass could hardly contain his“reverence,” comparing Stowe to Burns and Shakespeare, “the favored ones ofearth.” He left feeling assured that Mrs. Stowe was his “friend andbenefactress.” He had visited, in part, to discuss her possible support for the“elevation” of free blacks.39 [notes01.html#ch13fn_39a]Image [../images/f0248-01.jpg]Harriet Beecher Stowe, 1850s. Photograph, albumen print.Douglass sat down at his desk in early spring 1853 to write a work of shortfiction, “The Heroic Slave,” which reflected his personal state of mind, hisevolving ideas on violence, and the national crisis he sought to influence. Thestory, first published in his newspaper in March, re-created a five-year periodin the life of Madison Washington, the slave who led a successful revolt aboardthe domestic slave-trading ship Creole in 1841 and sailed it into Nassau harbor,a British port, resulting in the liberation of the more than three dozen slaves.Douglass had long addressed the story of Washington and the Creole mutiny inspeeches in the late 1840s in Britain and America. He had kept its memory aliveas a historical precedent for slave rebellion and as a rhetorical weapon. He didso especially in New York in April 1849 to twelve hundred blacks at the ShilohPresbyterian Church, where he told Washington’s tale in imaginative terms to thedelight and laughter of his audience. In such speeches Douglass tried out somescenes that ended up in the novella, although much of the 1849 effort wasdevoted to the irony of monarchial Britain freeing self-liberated slaves from“free, democratic” America; he especially relished the image of the formerbondmen escorted off the ship in Nassau by “a platoon of black soldiers.” Hereserved a special sarcasm for how this American “property” emerged as humanbeings from the clutches of outraged US senators such as Henry Clay and John C.Calhoun, and the secretary of state, Daniel Webster, who issued formal proteststo the British. Unmistakably, Douglass left those public audiences with a direwarning: “There are more Madison Washingtons in the South, and the time may notbe distant when the whole South will present again a scene something similar tothe deck of the Creole.”40 [notes01.html#ch13fn_40a]Literary scholars have suggested many reasons why Douglass turned to fiction,although any explanation begins with his obligation to produce somethingoriginal for Julia Griffiths’s book, Autographs for Freedom. The turn to fictionto expose the full danger of the fugitive-slave crisis was also a logicalprogression in Douglass’s evolution as a man of words; he had mastered oratory,achieved fame with autobiography, and now independently engaged the world ofjournalism. Fiction was the next form, and it offered him some artistic rangethat even his most creative oratory had not. As critics Shelley Fisher Fishkinand Carla Peterson have shown, Douglass could drop his ever-present I pronounand adopt the more versatile third-person narrator as the voice of his polemic.He gave a profound voice to the slave rebel, in the person of MadisonWashington, for an audience that could see such figures only as a dangerous lot.Robert Stepto effectively points to how fiction enhanced Douglass’s brilliancein using contradiction and irony. Douglass also found in Washington’s story astriking means to give another “salute” to British abolitionists, and especiallyto declare in storytelling just how much he had broken with Garrisonian moralsuasion and pacifism.41 [notes01.html#ch13fn_41a]Literary historian Robert Levine, moreover, argues that “The Heroic Slave,” withits depictions of a noble, stunningly intelligent, yet violent slave rebel, wasDouglass’s critique of Uncle Tom’s Cabin (only a year into its enormoussuccess), as well as a potential allegory about the abolitionist’s relationshipwith Harriet Beecher Stowe herself. Washington prays effusively in the novellafor his liberation, yet in the end does not rely only on God for freedom. He isbeaten savagely like Uncle Tom, but is no Jesus figure. He is the militant,praying rebel, willing to use a “temperate revolutionary” violence, a mixtureperhaps of Uncle Tom and George Harris. Douglass did express ambivalence aboutStowe’s novel in turning to fiction, although he never stopped honoring Stoweherself.42 [notes01.html#ch13fn_42a] He admired her deeply and loved the impactof her book, even as he invented alternative characters.Douglass’s increasingly strident advocacy of violent resistance against theterror practiced against fugitive slaves found an interesting outlet inWashington’s story. “The Heroic Slave” allowed Douglass, as one critic hasargued, to create “a new edition of himself.” He had always portrayed himself asa reluctant fighter, a rebel in self-defense only, the means directed to the endof natural, God-given liberty and self-possession. Douglass was primarily a manof intellect, not brawn, words, not military action. But in Washington hecreated a character who was a noble combination of all those elements. The plotof the story breaks down at times, and some lame transitions mar its literaryquality. Douglass relies, not surprisingly, on a narrator, on speech-making inlong soliloquies rather than sustained character development. But within thesentimental literary conventions of the time, it is not difficult to see whymany readers, especially if they had read Douglass’s and other slave narratives,would have found the story moving and well paced.43 [notes01.html#ch13fn_43a]When Mr. Listwell, a traveling Ohioan, happens upon the desperate Madison out inthe woods, praying and contemplating escape as he also fears leaving his wifeand children, we encounter a description of a fabulously heroic figure whorepresents every element of nineteenth-century manliness, except that of freedomand self-possession. Madison is a “manly form.” He is “tall, symmetrical, round,and strong.” He combined the “strength of a lion” and a “lion’s elasticity.” His“torn sleeves” exposed “arms like polished iron.” Douglass’s Madison was a manof transformative eloquence as well as action. His “heart-touching narrations ofhis own personal sufferings” to the silent forest, overheard by Listwell,convert the Ohioan immediately to radical abolitionism. And in Listwell(“listens—well”) Douglass created a striking character, a stand-in for all theYankee white abolitionists he had known who had, in their best instincts, helpedslaves such as himself to freedom, knowledge, and self-realization.44[notes01.html#ch13fn_44a] In Mr. Listwell he was trying to tell theGarrisonians something about the role he [Douglass] preferred for them, insteadof the one he had come to expect from them.“The Heroic Slave” contains some striking dialogue and effective narration, astory of how the Underground Railroad did sometimes work for fugitives headingto Canada, and especially of a dilapidated, gothic Virginia tavern, occupiedlargely by drunken “loafers,” where Listwell once again encounters Madisontrapped in a slave coffle trudging in chains to Richmond for sale. That tavern,its foreboding, decaying setting, and the dialogues between the loafer andListwell about slave trading, are Douglass’s metaphors for the South and for thenation’s predicament with slavery. We never actually see the blood and killingon the deck of the ship, a consideration for the white readers, but witnessMadison’s magnanimity in saving the first mate’s life, as he also converts himto the realization that with this slave rebel he is “in the presence of asuperior man.”45 [notes01.html#ch13fn_45a] Madison Washington conquers his foeswith courage, character, and with the power of the word. He also conquers withthe sword as he must. But more restrained than in his speeches and editorialsabout the need for dead slaveholders or slave catchers, Douglass spares hisreaders the pools of blood on the deck of the Creole. Fiction seems to haveallowed for artistic control over the rage within.Would that Douglass had attempted more works of fiction; he possessed a stunningability with narrative. By the force of his will, from constant discipline, andfrom the help of friends, especially Julia Griffiths, he had emerged by themid-1850s as a versatile and accomplished writer, one deserving a placeeventually in that era’s literary American renaissance. By late 1854 and early1855 he took to his desk for even longer stints of time to revise his originalNarrative, to remake himself once again in print, and produced My Bondage and MyFreedom, arguably the greatest of all slave narratives. This secondautobiography would be at once more revealing and more revolutionary than thefirst because more political. Douglass was a great storyteller; but now hecourted yet new dimensions of personal and public conflict as he plunged intothe art of politics. It was one thing to try to be the prophet in Babylon, butquite another thing to be a prophet in party politics."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 14--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MY VOICE, MY PEN, OR MY VOTEHis were not mere words of eloquence . . . that delight the ear and then passaway. No! They were work-able, do-able words that brought forth fruits in therevolution.—JAMES MCCUNE SMITH, 1855By the mid-1850s Frederick Douglass had become a thoroughgoing politicalabolitionist. As an outspoken supporter of Gerrit Smith and the Liberty Party,he rejoiced in Smith’s election to Congress as a radical abolitionist in 1852.“The cup of my joy is full,” he told Smith. “You are now . . . within sight andhearing of this guilty nation.”1 [notes01.html#ch14fn_1a] Just what kind ofpolitical abolitionist Douglass would be remained a roller-coaster ride ofchanging allegiances between principles and politics, between radical fringepolitical parties and the emerging, powerful Republican Party, founded in 1854.Clearly, though, his break with Garrisonianism was nowhere more evident than inhis embrace of political action, and in his newly adopted faith that votes couldone day weaken and destroy slavery. The story of Douglass’s politics in thedecade before the Civil War is about the complex education of a pragmatist whonever gave up his radicalism.In a speech to the Ladies’ Anti-Slavery Society of Rochester, in January 1855,Douglass delivered an address on the “nature, character, and history of theantislavery movement.” In this deliberative but revealing discussion of hisevolving philosophy of reform, he left no doubt about his independence fromGarrisonians. Their doctrines had become “plainly absurd”; they hated slaverysufficiently, but strict moral suasion and disunionism possessed “nointelligible principle of action.” His former Boston friends represented toDouglass a dying “theory which can never be made intelligible to common sense.”As he announced himself a Liberty Party man, embracing the antislaveryconception of the Constitution, and not a Republican willing merely to stop theexpansion of slavery, Douglass nevertheless seemed to hold his options open. “Iwould unite with anybody to do right,” he said, “and with nobody to do wrong.”2[notes01.html#ch14fn_2a] Douglass’s crooked path into the art of politics wouldbe just as troubled as his earlier battles within abolitionism. Since childhoodhe had understood a great deal about the power slaveholders wielded over theirchattel. Now he would try to leverage and destroy that power at its highestlevels. As Douglass so often remade himself, so too he reimagined his politics.• • •Late in 1854, and especially during the first half of 1855, Douglass spent manyweeks at his desk writing his ultimate declaration of independence, My Bondageand My Freedom, his second, more thorough and revealing autobiography. In longform, it was the masterpiece of his writing life, a work that modern scholarshave given a prominent place in the literary American renaissance. Bondage andFreedom is not a mere updating of the Narrative of 1845; rather, it is anextensive revision of that one great tale Douglass believed he must tell—thestory of himself.A quite different person—a much more mature, politicized writer—crafted Bondageand Freedom, as opposed to the twenty-seven-year-old orator of 1845 who neededto establish his identity through literacy. The 1855 book of 464 pages (fourtimes longer than the Narrative) came from, as Douglass reminded readers in thefirst three chapter titles, an “Author” already free and ready to use literacyto engage in an epic argument with his country. Julia Griffiths still resided inRochester and served as Douglass’s coeditor of his newspaper right up until herdeparture back to England in midsummer 1855. Her labors in the printing officein order to free his time to write certainly testify to her support, if not alsoher editorial hand in helping make the book possible. Douglass published it inAugust with Miller, Orton and Mulligan of Auburn, New York, at the price of$1.25. The sales were spectacular—five thousand copies in the first two days andfifteen thousand within three months. Douglass helped market the book byserializing parts of it in his paper, and in the next few years he sometimestook one or more of his sons out on the road with him to sell the book for $1apiece at his pubic lectures. Only two years after publication, the sameprinting house issued a new edition with a banner, “Eighteen Thousand,”inscribed on the title page, indicating the number then in print.3[notes01.html#ch14fn_3a]Bondage and Freedom achieved what Douglass most wanted: readers and publicimpact. He could feel buttressed in his belief that words could shape and changehistory. But he wrote the book for many reasons. In a prefatory letter to hiseditor, Douglass claimed, with awkward falseness, that he had always possessed a“repugnance” to writing or speaking about himself, and to the “imputation ofseeking personal notoriety for its own sake.” This odd disclaimer was aconvention of the literary apologetics of that era, although ironic in a bookthat ended with a brilliant argument that human dignity depended directly uponpublic recognition. But what is most interesting about Douglass’s preface isthat he turns the disavowal of “vanity and egotism” into a larger purpose. Hemust write this book, he says, because he is “exceptional” in a world thatdenies black equality. Douglass portrays himself as the reluctant prophet whomust tell his story with a principle at stake for the “whole human family.”Slavery was “at the bar of public opinion” now as never before. The “wholecivilized world” had to render “judgment,” especially because of the growingpower of proslavery forces. Moreover, Douglass argued, he wrote for the samereason he founded his own newspaper. The humanity of his people must bedemonstrated before a racist world.4 [notes01.html#ch14fn_4a] Such a claim forthe public duty of writing a second autobiography reflects just how much thisnew literary self-creation was a political act.Douglass further felt compelled to write Bondage and Freedom because he had somuch to say about the transformations, losses, and gains of his life since thesummer he boarded a ship for England. He had many tales to tell about hisflowering in the British Isles and about the independence he had sought sincereturning to America. He was now a more reflective and analytical thinker, andthe new autobiography demonstrated this in his embrace of reading and “study,”his advocacy of the natural-rights tradition, and his conceptions of violence.Douglass was now truly a black leader, a widely acknowledged proponent of theself-reliance and elevation of blacks and their communities. In 1855, Douglassfully emerged as the black Jeremiah.5 [notes01.html#ch14fn_5a]Over the years dozens of literary critics and historians have interpretedDouglass’s autobiographies. Perhaps none has done so more incisively than thefirst, James McCune Smith, Douglass’s good friend, ideological soul mate, andthe man he asked to introduce Bondage and Freedom. Smith was born a slave in NewYork City in 1813 and freed by the Emancipation Act of the State of New York in1827. His mother was a self-emancipated black woman, and like Douglass, hisfather was presumed white, although Smith seems to have never known hisidentity. A star student at the African Free School no. 2 in New York, Smithbecame an intellectual prodigy. He studied Latin and Greek and applied to themedical schools at Columbia College and in Geneva, New York, but was deniedadmission. With financial help from New York City black friends, Smith journeyedto Glasgow, Scotland, at age nineteen, where between 1832 and 1837 he achievedthe BA, MA, and MD degrees.6 [notes01.html#ch14fn_6a]Image [../images/f0255-01.jpg]Title page of My Bondage and My Freedom, 1855. Original edition, engraving froma lost daguerreotype of Douglass. Daniel Vierra photographer.Upon his return to New York, Smith opened a medical practice and a pharmacy inlower Manhattan in the year Douglass escaped through the city as a fugitive. Inhis spare time, Smith launched his remarkable career as an abolitionist, apolymath writer and intellectual. He wrote on all manner of subjects, fromabolitionist strategies to moral philosophy, from natural sciences to ethnologyand chess, from American and world history to literature. After he met Douglassin the late 1840s, they struck up an extraordinary friendship, perhaps as eachother’s alter ego. Douglass could learn so much from Smith, who became a kind ofolder brother for the former field hand and caulker. And Smith too learned somuch from Douglass’s genius with language and from his force of will. Steeped inthe classics and the romantics, Smith found in the younger former runaway aspecial kind of hero. The two shared a worldview and abolitionist strategies.Smith too had become an ardent anti-Garrisonian and shared Douglass’s fierceopposition to black emigration schemes emerging from Martin Delany and others.When the Garrisonian NASS tried to trump up a “feud” between them in 1855, Smithwrote in Douglass’s paper that no “gnashing of teeth” among their rivals couldsever this “open and avowed friendship between two black men.” Perhaps they alsotalked about their separate times in Glasgow. They had combined their mutualprestige in trying to persuade the black convention movement to adopt a plan foran industrial school for young blacks and a National Council of leadership in1853. Lack of funding and the perennial internecine ideological warfare amongblack leaders doomed most of their educational and institutional endeavors.Nevertheless, Douglass and Smith became frequent collaborators.7[notes01.html#ch14fn_7a]In addition to his masterful essays, Smith became an experimental writer, withworks often appearing under the pseudonym Communipaw, a name he tookintriguingly from a legendary colonial Indian settlement in what became JerseyCity, New Jersey, a place where an interracial community of blacks, Indians, andDutch settlers had resisted the English crown. Smith also penned satires andvignettes under the series title “Heads of the Colored People” in Douglass’snewspaper from 1852 to 1854. These pieces were depictions of working-class blackNew Yorkers, giving dignity to the bootblack, washerwoman, whitewasher, steward,sexton, schoolmaster, and others. In the term “Heads,” Smith brilliantlyparodied reigning racial theories of the time, such as phrenology, which arguedthat the alleged racial superiority of whites stemmed from larger craniums.Douglass admired Smith’s wit and wordplay and was delighted to publish suchforms of literary resistance to the daily racism blacks endured in cities suchas New York. But Douglass confessed to a different taste and criticized some ofhis friend’s experimentation, preferring instead to portray their race asrespectable seekers of the middle class rather than poor, noble laborers.Douglass considered some of Smith’s “Heads” essays too close to “faithfulpictures of contented degradation.” The editor warned his friend to watch outfor “a rap or two over his head with a broom-stick,” or for the washerwomanthrowing “a few drops of moderately hot suds upon his neatly attired person.” Ina response to Smith’s series in 1853, written after his own recent visit to NewYork, Douglass maintained that blacks were better observed not in the streetsbut “at their homes.” He preferred images of indoor respectability to ironicoutdoor subversion, stressing black involvement in churches, literary societies,and especially noting the “watches, clocks, gold pens, pencils, and all sorts ofjewelry” he saw in black homes.8 [notes01.html#ch14fn_8a] Douglass seemed tokeep his shirts more starched than the good doctor, but such disagreements aboutclass and race only enriched, rather than harmed, the relationship between thesetwo intellectuals.Smith and Douglass constantly sought out each other about writing and shared amutual respect for a life of the mind for black men. They shared a brotherhoodof experiences of racism, outside and inside the antislavery movement. Douglassjudged Smith “without rivals” among black leaders for his “talents and learning”and for his “known devotion to the cause of the oppressed people.” Smith’s viewsof Douglass could wax even more effusive. Back in 1848, when the North Starappeared, McCune Smith wrote to Gerrit Smith with special praise: “I loveFrederick Douglass for his whole souled outness, that is the secret of his noblethoughts and far-reaching sympathies. You will be surprised to hear me say thatonly since his Editorial career has he begun to become a colored man! I haveread his paper very carefully and find phrase after phrase develop itself asregularly as in one newly born among us.”9 [notes01.html#ch14fn_9a]In the introduction to Bondage and Freedom, McCune Smith imposed a great burdenon Douglass, declaring the former slave the embodiment of the cause of humanequality, leader among the “living exemplars of the practicability of the mostradical abolitionism.” When Smith described Douglass’s “sacred thirst forliberty and learning,” Smith was writing about himself as well.10[notes01.html#ch14fn_10a] The introduction is not only an intellectual’s tributeto another intellectual, but the most formally educated black man of thenineteenth century telling the world what it means that a Frederick Douglassexists at all in slaveholding America.Smith took special care to show readers that this autobiography was in the endliterature. Douglass’s techniques, according to Smith, were manifold. “Memory,logic, wit, sarcasm, invective, pathos, and bold imagery of rare structuralbeauty,” he argued, “well up as from a copious fountain, yet each in its properplace, and contributing to form a whole, grand in itself, yet complete in theminutest proportions.” Douglass’s ability with language, Smith maintained, wasnot in fashioning “mere words of eloquence,” but “work-able, do-able words” thatmight forge a “revolution” in the world. Douglass wrote persuasive prose. Inthis public use of his personal story as a “Representative American man,” Smithbelieved that Douglass had written an “American book, for Americans in thefullest sense of the idea.”11 [notes01.html#ch14fn_11a] In other words, whatcould be more American at this juncture in history than a brilliantly rendered,lyrical, and terrible story of a man’s journey through hell from slavery tofreedom? Surely Douglass was moved by his friend’s political description of thepurpose and power of words doing the work of “revolution.”Nothing seems to have impressed McCune Smith quite like Douglass’s uncannypersonal memory fashioned seamlessly into an abolitionist polemic. As anintellectual and scientist, Smith was stunned at the extensive probing Douglassgave to his own childhood, of how the autobiography provided a model for just“when positive and persistent memory begins in the human being.” Long beforeneuroscience, Smith pointed to universal psychological and moral insights aswell as to features distinctive to an American slave experience. Smith admiredhis friend’s “rare alliance between passion and intellect” as a biographer, his“energy of character” and sheer will, whether working to be “king amongcaulkers” or craving after language as reader and orator. The scientist wasdeeply intrigued by Douglass’s capacity for recollection. According to Smith, itwas Douglass’s “wonderful memory” that made his autobiographical writing sopowerful. Smith felt moved not by Douglass’s mere recall of facts, but by theliterary act “when the memory of them [facts] went seething through his brain,breeding a fiery indignation at his injured selfhood,” then bursting out instory and characters.12 [notes01.html#ch14fn_12a]The physician’s introduction is one of the early meditations on the art ofmemory, with a former slave as the subject. Smith knew Douglass well enough tounderstand how much his younger comrade’s persona was now entwined with hisidentity as a writer. Hence Smith acknowledged Douglass’s “descriptive anddeclamatory powers” and his “logical force.” But above all the author of Bondageand Freedom, as well as of so many great orations, possessed “style.”13[notes01.html#ch14fn_13a]Smith took an excursion on the “intellectual puzzle” of Douglass’s literarystyle, wondering whether it stemmed from his white ancestry or from his “negroblood.” Here he followed Douglass down the romantic but blind lane of hismother’s literacy as the source of the writer’s skill. But for Douglass’s style,Smith should have looked no further than the rhetoric itself, its cadences,diction, word choices, and indeed its storytelling. The rhythms of Douglass’slanguage were oratorical, and they were deeply indebted, consciously or not, tohis life of reading and using the King James Bible. As the literary scholarRobert Alter writes, it was the Old Testament prophets who spoke so compellinglyto the “American situation” of the nineteenth century and gave the essence of“style” to its best writers. Style, says Alter, is not “merely a constellationof aesthetic properties,” but the “vehicle of a particular vision of reality.”Style is not the mere drapery hung on the more important ideology and politicsdriving the best writing; it is the very lifeblood of any prose that persuadesabout its politics. The Bible gave texture to American prose, and the “KingJames translation,” according to Alter, became the “wellspring of eloquence” andthe “national book of the American people.”14 [notes01.html#ch14fn_14a] That iswhere any “puzzle” about Douglass’s source of style should be solved.That style is on display all over Bondage and Freedom. In his brilliantdepiction of slaveholders’ psychic unease about the evil system they practicedon the Wye plantation, we can feel Douglass’s cadences even as he names histext. “This immense wealth,” he wrote, “this gilded splendor; this profusion ofluxury; this exemption from toil; this life of ease; this sea of plenty; aye,what of it all?” Douglass loved repetition. Then he begins to throw down hiswarnings of future reckoning. “Lurking beneath all their dishes are invisiblespirits of evil, ready to feed the self-deluded gormandizers with aches, pains,fierce temper . . . lombago and gout.” Their souls cannot rest. “To the pamperedlove of ease,” Douglass intones with his trademark contrasts, “there is noresting place. What is pleasant today, is repulsive tomorrow; what is soft now,is hard at another time; what is sweet in the morning, is bitter in theevening.” Then he simply gives Isaiah and Jeremiah the last word in this oracleabout the woe in history’s plan for slaveholders. “Neither to the wicked, nor tothe idler, is there any solid peace: ‘Troubled like the restless sea.’ ”15[notes01.html#ch14fn_15a] Thus for Douglass style and argument flowed togetherin the same torrent of words.All great autobiography is about loss, about the hopeless but necessary quest toretrieve and control a past that forever slips away. Memory is both inspirationand burden, method and subject, the thing one cannot live with or without. Smithgrasped just how true this was for a former slave who seized literacy.Douglass’s past was a dangerous place to go, but as he returned to it over andover, he made memory into art, brilliantly and mischievously employing itsauthority, its elusiveness, its truths, and its charms. Douglass’s memory wasfraught with conflicted images; sometimes he flattened them out to control histale of self-made ascension, but other times he just described the brutalcontrasts and reached for truth. He often hid as much as he revealed, especiallyabout his family and personal life. But what he did reveal in Bondage andFreedom is one man’s deeply personal indictment of the past and present of hiscountry, and a risky, bold vision of a different future. Smith understood thepower of such a symbol. He stressed Douglass’s essentially “American . . . mixedrace” identity. Here, Americans could see their future, Smith contended.Douglass was one of the “Romuluses and Remuses who are to inaugurate the newbirth of our republic.”16 [notes01.html#ch14fn_16a] Neither man yet knew theprescience of that claim.Hence, in part via Smith’s guidance, we can see the political character ofDouglass’s second autobiography. If a “stranger” landed in the United States,Smith maintained, and sought out America’s most prominent men from the sheervolume of attention in newspapers and on the telegraphs, he would discoverDouglass. “During the past winter—1854–5—very frequent mention of FrederickDouglass was made,” said Smith. Douglass had emerged as one of those people towhom others say, “ ‘Tell me your thought!’ And somehow or other, revolutionseemed to follow in his wake.” Indeed, in 1854 the orator’s name started toappear frequently in the press in comparison to the other Douglas—Stephen,senator from Illinois. The New York Tribune published a poem the former slavemust have enjoyed: “Let slavery now stop her mouth, / And quiet be henceforth: /We’ve got Fred Douglass from the South - / She’s got Steve from the North!” Thetwo men nearly encountered each other in Illinois in October that same year.Douglass dogged Douglas as the latter barnstormed, selling the Kansas-NebraskaAct; once they even rode the same railcar, but the senator feigned illness toavoid a confrontation. On the floor of Congress by 1856 a Democrat and aRepublican squared off over the principles of their respective parties. TheRepublican said his adversaries “blindly follow and worship Mr. Douglas.” Butthe Illinois Democrat retorted that while “we worship Stephen A. Douglas,” theRepublicans “worship Fred Douglass.”17 [notes01.html#ch14fn_17a] Smith graspedDouglass’s desperate ambition as well as his genuine fame.Douglass divided Bondage and Freedom into two sections, “Life as a Slave” and“Life as a Freeman.” Especially in the second section, but even in the first, insome of his enhanced portrayals of his Maryland origins, he wrote as thepolitical abolitionist. In Bondage and Freedom, Douglass revised many moments inhis story to show himself as a young leader among his fellow slaves, even as thepotentially violent black rebel. When Thomas Auld and his fellow Methodistsbroke up Douglass’s first effort at a Sabbath school in St. Michaels, usingclubs, one of “the pious crew,” recalled Douglass, “told me that as for my part[as leader] I wanted to be another Nat Turner; and if I did not look out, Ishould get as many balls into me, as Nat did into him.” In 1845, Douglass wrotethat master Auld found him merely “unsuitable” due to his urban Baltimoreexperiences. But by 1855, this changed to the tale of a much more aggressive,rebellious slave invoking the bloodcurdling image of slave rebellion.18[notes01.html#ch14fn_18a]In the Narrative Douglass gave approximately eleven pages to the story of histravail with Edward Covey, while in 1855 he devoted approximately thirty-twopages to this pivotal experience in the grip of the “tyrant’s vise.” In 1845Douglass did not seem to hold back in showing how Covey beat him mercilesslywhen he had fallen to the ground weak with sunstroke; his “blood ran freely.”But in Bondage and Freedom this episode, which precipitates his delirious flightthrough the woods to St. Michaels to seek Auld’s protection, gets much bloodierstill. A half dozen uses of the words “blood” or “bleeding” turn in the revisionto fifteen expressions of the same words in two pages. The language becomesbiblical, Douglass’s sufferings all but a slow crucifixion. His body is mangledby “briers and thorns,” his hair “clotted with dust and blood,” his feet andlegs “scarred” with “blood marks.” In the end Auld does not protect him; thiswould-be Jesus must face near death before he can find redemption. Auld forsakeshis wounded slave, saying he “deserved the flogging” because of laziness. Herejects Frederick’s appeal for help with the cowardly and revealing statementthat, as a hired hand to Covey, he (Auld as owner) could not lose his slave’s“wages for the entire year.” By 1855 Douglass knew just which biblical story inwhich to place this moment. He threw the charge of laziness right back at Auld.Slaveholders, he wrote, using Matthew 23:4, “bind heavy burdens, grievous to beborne, and lay them on men’s shoulders; but they, themselves, will not move themwith one of their fingers.” The passage comes just before Jesus demands “woeunto you scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites!”19 [notes01.html#ch14fn_19a]The much deeper texture of the 1855 work reveals a writer who would now “soundthe profounder depths of slave life,” to set up his ultimate “disenthrallment.”Douglass became “a fish in a net, allowed to play for a time,” but was “soondrawn rapidly to the shore.” He was now rendered “a wild young working animal,”not merely learning to drive the oxen, but becoming the oxen. “I now saw . . .several points of similarity with that of the oxen. They were property, so wasI; they were to be broken, so was I. Covey was to break me, I was to break them;break and be broken—such is life.” All these metaphors set up the necessity thatit is Covey who must be broken in violent resistance. The psychological andphysical tyranny portrayed on Covey’s farm in Bondage and Freedom is the kindthat can only result in not merely individual but collective revolution. AsDouglass got the best of Covey in their barnyard rumble, the desperateslaveowner called out to his slave named Caroline (a “powerful woman”) to cometo his aid. But Caroline, who does not appear in the 1845 version of the scene,steadfastly refuses to answer her master’s command, leading the autobiographerto wryly conclude, “We were all in open rebellion that morning.”20[notes01.html#ch14fn_20a]Image [../images/f0262-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, c. 1855–58. Daguerreotype.Thus “goaded almost to madness,” and savagely brutalized, Douglass created avision in which only violence could result, a condition in which he soon arguedthe entire nation would find itself. In Bondage and Freedom, Douglass stillclaimed he fought Covey only from a defensive posture. But this time he attackedwith a “fighting madness” and left no doubt that Covey deserved to be bloodiedor even killed. This violence was for the good of the slave’s own soul, notmerely a matter of natural right. “I was a changed being after that fight,” saidDouglass the completely recovered Garrisonian. “I was nothing before; I was aMAN NOW. It recalled to life my crushed self-respect . . . A man without forceis without the essential dignity of humanity.” Similarly, his defense of theescape plot among his fellow slaves on the Freeland farm no longer stood merelyas an act of natural right. In Bondage and Freedom it stemmed from the right ofrevolutionary violence. “The slaveholder, kind or cruel . . . is . . . everyhour silently whetting the knife of vengeance for his own throat,” wrote theautobiographer who was also now the rescuer of the Christiana-riot fugitives. Aslaveholder “never lisps a syllable in commendation of the fathers of thisrepublic . . . without . . . asserting the rights of rebellion for his ownslaves.”21 [notes01.html#ch14fn_21a] A leitmotif in Bondage and Freedom is anexpectation of violence.Examples abound in Bondage and Freedom of Douglass’s more assertive, politicalbrand of autobiography. He captures his burgeoning independence from theGarrisonians in a voice that needed new terrain, new horizons. Walt Whitmancould have had a former slave like Douglass in mind in “Poets to Come”:Poets to come! orators, singers, musicians to come!Not to-day is to justify me and answer what I am for,But you, a new brood, native, athletic, continental, greaterthan before known,Arouse! for you must justify me.We do not know if Whitman ever read Douglass. Whitman would have found a newprose poet remembering his “reading and thinking,” the orator who “was growingand needed room,” now looking steadfastly to “speak just the word that seemed tome the word to be spoken by me.” “I myself but write one or two indicative wordsfor the future,” said Whitman, “but advance a moment only to wheel and hurryback in the darkness.”22 [notes01.html#ch14fn_22a] Douglass wrote in 1855 indepth about his past of darkness so as to chart a much wider future. The reasonwe remember Douglass is because he found “the word.”Douglass portrayed his sojourn in the British Isles as in part an education inself-realization and political action. The ways that racial prejudice aboard theCambria helped him as a “stranger to get fairly before the British public” readas a primer for his later role as independent editor and activist. The waysDouglass learned to court public scorn, to relish being “unpopular” and“notorious,” his defense against the accusation that his speeches attackingAmerica in Britain and upon his return to his native country had been “harsh inspirit,” read like the preparation of the Jeremiah of 1852. Like the OldTestament prophets, Douglass knew that he had to lay down the story of grievanceand suffering as well as national betrayal before imagining historical renewal.Bondage and Freedom contained many elements of the prophetic tradition—warnings,destruction, and reinvention. His splendid apostasy against the Garrisonians ledhim to a “radical change” in his opinions, and a new platform of politicalaction.23 [notes01.html#ch14fn_23a]When describing his last years struggling as a moral suasionist, Douglass saidhe had performed with “pen and tongue.” But on the last page of Bondage andFreedom he announced his new “disposition.” His book added his story to a long“blood-written history,” and clouds full of “wrathful thunder and lightning”hovered over the land. But Douglass gave a full-throated statement that“progress is still possible.” Then in the final sentence of the book he promisedthat while “Heaven” lent him “ability,” he would strive to “use my voice, mypen, or my vote.”24 [notes01.html#ch14fn_24a] Whether the temple could bedestroyed by votes remained to be seen.• • •Douglass spent the decade from 1841 to 1851 trying to denounce voting as amechanism of black freedom. In the 1850s, however, to secure and cast that vote,along with a recurring struggle with the beast of violence, became the centralquestions of his public life. Douglass saw slavery as an all-encompassing evilbut also as a threat to national existence, and therefore an immensely politicalproblem. Writing much later in Life and Times, Douglass described his outlookduring these crisis years before the Civil War: “I confess to a feeling alliedto satisfaction at the prospect of conflict between North and South. Standingoutside the pale of American humanity, denied citizenship, unable to call theland of my birth my country . . . I was ready for any political upheaval whichwould bring about a change in the existing condition of things.”25[notes01.html#ch14fn_25a] Beneath these remembered yearnings lay the tormentedexperience of a black abolitionist desperate for political strife that couldforge revolutionary change. But in real time, how could a radical with a pen, avoice, and an individual vote ever bring this about? Did he simply await themoral logic and force of history? Or did he act to try to force a cataclysm?In the years 1854 to 1857, such an upheaval arrived with the passage of theKansas-Nebraska Act, which potentially opened all western territory to theexpansion of slavery. Moreover, a border vigilante war known as Bleeding Kansasbroke out and helped to cause the birth of the Republican Party. Douglass threwhimself into this new political fray. He launched new lecture tours, withBondage and Freedom in tow. But the “home trials,” frequent illnesses, andfinancial insecurity dogged his life. Having just returned from yet anothergrueling lecture trip in March 1855, Douglass offered a rare glimpse of hispersonal moods. His anxiety over the turmoil roiling in the country masked asimilar tension in his domestic world in Rochester. He seemed a weary manreaching out publicly for solace. “Words of cheer in a gloomy moment,” he said,“have an inspiring tendency. They brush away the cloud, and let in the sunlight.They cause a smile to nestle in the countenance, once distorted with sorrowfulemotions.” Was this Douglass’s personal cry for help? “This is a cold, bleakworld,” he concluded, “but not without its oases.”26 [notes01.html#ch14fn_26a]Douglass returned in yet another homecoming to the house out on the edge ofRochester, surrounded by Anna Douglass’s ever-enlarging garden. Julia Griffithsstill lived with the Porters down the road and labored daily in town at thenewspaper office. His five children, all still at home, ranged in age from sixto sixteen. Despite the lecture fees, and soon the sales of the second memoir,the newspaper was still in dire straits. In the coming year Douglass was onceagain beholden to Gerrit Smith’s largess to keep Frederick Douglass’ Paperalive. “I am almost convinced that my paper cannot be sustained,” wrote adiscouraged Douglass as he told Smith of his $1,500 debt. “I have failed, atleast for the moment. The prospect is dark.” His explanation was that he was notpartisan enough, refusing to join up as a Republican Party organ, but also, ashe had long complained, “The colored people do very little to support it.”Douglass was privately desperate as he once again begged for money from hisbenefactor. “I am sick at the thought of the failure of my paper. But when a mancannot stand up he must fall down.” His children were “growing up and increasingtheir demands upon me,” Douglass told Smith; he felt a father’s “humiliation.”He whistled positively as he also pled for help, calling himself “quite welloff . . . having health and heart, a good house and lot.” Bondage and Freedomwould sell, he hoped, “as long as I can lecture.”27 [notes01.html#ch14fn_27a]Douglass seemed a man who did not know, once again, quite where to turn. Histrusted confidant and coworker Griffiths returned to England in June 1855, herwelcome worn-out around the Douglass household. Before leaving, in a partlyillegible letter to Gerrit Smith dated September 9 (likely 1854), Juliadiscussed her plans to return to England. An unnamed “leader” thought it“expedient for me to re-cross the Atlantic,” she remarked, although “many othersdoubtless, (& they weigh greatly with me) . . . seem to indicate this to be mypost—I like my occupation exceedingly when I have health & strength to gothrough my duties to my satisfaction; but that has not been the case of late.”Before concluding, Julia left a cryptic Old Testament inspiration: “Pharaoh’sChariot Wheels have dragged heavily.” Drawn from Exodus 14:25, she referred toGod opening the waters of the Red Sea for the children of Israel to cross tofreedom as pharaoh’s soldiers retreated, their chariot wheels breaking andfalling off.28 [notes01.html#ch14fn_28a]Image [../images/f0266-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass with daughter Annie Douglass, c. 1854. Daguerreotype.Julia would never return to America, despite a claim that her voyage back toEngland was only a temporary absence. But she would remain a vigorous supporterof Douglass’s paper, a loyal correspondent and antislavery organizer in Britainas long as the two lived. Indeed, upon her return to England she began a seriesof more than eighty public letters, published in Douglass’s paper, providingcoverage of British antislavery as well as a kind of travel diary of a literaryVictorian woman. The first of those letters, in a series entitled “Letters fromthe Old World,” provided a gem of travel writing, complete with portraiture ofpeople she met, of conversations, and the power and beauty of nature. As hership sighted land on the return voyage, she “beheld the Welsh mountains, clothedwith verdure, and irradiated by the soft sunshine of early morning.” Howeverburdened, Douglass could escape into Julia’s frequent travelogues, especiallywhen she reached the Scotland he so loved. She was a beautiful, if florid,writer, especially in the land where “Walter Scott is echoed everywhere,” in“every wind that blows, every breeze that sighs, every bird that sings, everyflower that blooms.”29 [notes01.html#ch14fn_29a] Julia knew how to make herfriend miss her.Within a year of Griffiths’s departure from Rochester, another white womanstepped into Douglass’s life and caused even more private complication, even asshe too became an assiduous participant in the reformer’s intellectual life.Ottilie Assing, a German Jewish radical Forty-Eighter, moved to America topursue a new career as a journalist in 1852, taking up residence in Hoboken, NewJersey. She traveled, met many reformers, and wrote numerous essays for theGerman journal Morgenblatt. Well educated, freethinking, and nonreligious,steeped in the German romantics, she read Bondage and Freedom in 1855 anddetermined to translate it into German, which she did by 1860, with her ownintroduction replacing that of McCune Smith. She came to Rochester to meetDouglass in 1856 and, for the next twenty-four years, almost never left.Douglass’s relationship with Assing would be tempestuous to say the least, butoddly with little controversy—except at home.30 [notes01.html#ch14fn_30a]Douglass’s marriage was greatly strained in the 1850s. He and Anna rarely sharedthe same friends, nor an intellectual companionship. The meaning of his life’scalling and ambition drew them apart even as Frederick greatly depended onAnna’s skill and devotion as homemaker and mother. Douglass left few opencomments about Anna and their marriage, but he did sometimes complain tofriends. In 1857, after returning from the speaking circuit, Douglass wroteharshly of his wife: “I am sad to say that she is by no means well, and if Ishould write down all her complaints there could be no room to put my name atthe bottom, although the world would have it that I am actually at the bottom ofit all.” Then his anger turned ugly in a comment about Anna’s use of language:“She still seems able to use with great ease and fluency her powers of speech,and by the time I am home a week or two longer, I shall have pretty fullylearned in how many points there is need of improvement in my temper anddisposition as a husband and father, the head of the family!” This rare glimpseinto Douglass’s domestic situation adds meaning to the fear of failure he hadexpressed to Gerrit Smith. As husband and father, he also had much to ponder.That their marriage survived is a testament not only to the rarity of divorce inthe nineteenth century, but especially to Anna’s utter lack of options and toDouglass’s own lifelong craving for a sense of “home,” about which he wrote socompellingly in Bondage and Freedom.31 [notes01.html#ch14fn_31a] In themid-1850s, as before, Douglass plowed his private woes into great publicactivism. He and Anna sustained a home under trying circumstances that formoderns might have driven them apart.Image [../images/f0268-01.jpg]Anna Murray Douglass, 1840s.• • •In the 1852 political campaign Douglass established a pattern of shifting partyallegiances and endorsements; in that year he remained ostensibly a member ofGerrit Smith’s fledgling Liberty Party while openly supporting the new Free Soilpresidential ticket of John P. Hale and George Julian. The Free Soil Party drewits energy and electoral strategy from the crisis over the Mexican War in thelate 1840s and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. At the Free Soil convention inPittsburgh in August, Douglass announced himself proudly a “disciple” of GerritSmith and especially of the doctrine that any government legally sanctioningslavery was a “foul and blasting conspiracy.”32 [notes01.html#ch14fn_32a] Butfrom that radical high ground Douglass stepped down to continually learn thatpolitics and perfectionism did not easily mix.That summer and fall, Douglass all but surrendered the editorship of his paperand allowed Julia Griffiths and his assistant, John Thomas, to take the reins.He went on the road constantly all over New York State and for a two-week tourof Ohio in September. Douglass felt for the first time politically “called tothe field,” he told his readers. Julia asked subscribers to be patient, since“the summons for him [the editor] seems to come simultaneously from almost everycounty in the state of New York.” Wherever the train lines or a carriage couldcarry him, Douglass stumped for the Free Democracy (Free Soilers) and againstboth the Whig and Democratic Parties. He delivered some fifteen lectures in andaround Dryden and McGrawville, New York. On October 1 he announced appearancesin at least eleven towns in Tompkins County alone. The schedule wasbackbreaking, but on an earlier stop in Ithaca in late July, Douglass describeda little break before the evening speech. He hiked a “mile or two” along theeast bank of Cayuga Lake until he found “a suitable place to renew myacquaintance with the art of swimming.” He told of his sheer joy in a kind ofdiary for the paper: “Here all my boyish pranks in the front basin of Baltimorewere renewed. I had a glorious swim.”33 [notes01.html#ch14fn_33a]On his Ohio tour, which included a convention in Salem, Douglass was Jim-Crowedtwice. Going west on a boat on Lake Erie between Buffalo and Cleveland, thecaptain forced him to sleep on wood planks on the deck. On the return eastward,a captain “assaulted” Douglass at a dinner table. He “pulled the chair fromunder us and brought us down upon the cabin floor,” wrote the traveler. InBuffalo, Douglass consulted a lawyer, only to be told that the law was clearlyon his side, but that no local judge would convict someone in such a case.“There is something canine in the bark and growl of a genuine negro-hater,”concluded the weary traveler, who could still smile. “But a truce to puppies!”He loved his Ohio audiences of abolitionists. He felt inspired by the throngs“composed . . . mainly of hard-handed farmers, their industrious wives,daughters, and sisters.” Back home in New York surging in and out of small townsand villages, Douglass spoke twice a day, he said, for a week in Oneida andHerkimer Counties. In mid-October he spoke in ten towns in seven days, and atthe end of the campaign he reported a total of eighty lectures in some fortydays on the road.34 [notes01.html#ch14fn_34a]Everywhere Douglass went, he denounced the Fugitive Slave Act, argued thatslavery could never be legal, demanded his auditors enter the civic andpolitical fray, and acknowledged that the characters in Uncle Tom’s Cabin dancedin the heads of voters in this season of politics. Abolitionist principles, hebelieved, had never had such a political airing as now. At a speech in Ithaca inOctober he boiled down his decadelong career to a personal statement of hispolitics: “I have one great political idea. That idea is an old one . . . widelyand generally assented to; nevertheless . . . generally tramped upon anddisregarded.” The best expressions of his views, he said, were “found in theBible.” From Proverbs, he declared, “RIGHTEOUSNESS EXALTETH A NATION—SIN IS AREPROACH TO ANY PEOPLE.” Such a moral declaration, he concluded,“constitutes . . . the whole of my politics.” Such a choice of Scripture isinteresting for a recovering moral suasionist. In all the maxims about wisdomand folly in Proverbs, though, Douglass would also have read many passages abouthow the prudent gain knowledge and understanding, and the deceitful fall infolly.35 [notes01.html#ch14fn_35a] His politics was anything but settled; likehis sense of abolitionist strategy, it grew into a mixture of righteousness andpragmatism.In his paper, Douglass delivered a ringing endorsement of Hale and the FreeSoilers, despite that Hale had refused to declare slavery a form of “piracy,” asdemanded by the Liberty Party. The bulk of Douglass’s endorsement reveals a mindtorn between moral principle and political action. He urged Liberty men toremember that a vote could seldom represent all of one’s moral convictions.Sounding like a veteran politician, he offered a “rule” for action: “The voterought to see to it that his vote shall secure the highest good possible, at thesame time that it does no harm.”36 [notes01.html#ch14fn_36a] Once converted topolitical abolitionism, Douglass characteristically gave it his heart, mind, andsoul; but he demanded more of it than it could deliver. Demonstrating hispolitical fickleness, just before the November 1852 elections, Douglass withdrewhis support of the Free Soilers and instead rejoiced in Gerrit Smith’s electionto the US Congress.Within a year and a half everything seemed to change. Douglass’s initialreaction to the Kansas-Nebraska Act in early 1854 was a combination of outrageand refurbished hope. In his view, the repeal of the Missouri Compromise (thegeographical guarantee against slavery north of the 36°30' parallel) resultedfrom the “villainy of the slave power” and the “pusillanimity of the North.”“The Republic swings clear from all her ancient moorings,” he rejoiced from theisolation of Rochester, “and moves off upon a tempestuous and perilous sea. Woe!Woe! Woe to slavery! Her mightiest shield is broken . . . and for one, we nowsay . . . let the battle come.” He felt encouraged by the increasing severity ofthe various drafts of the Kansas-Nebraska bill. “If we must have the repeal ofthe Missouri restriction,” Douglass wrote privately, “let nothing be done tosoften the measure.” With good reason he anticipated a political awakening inthe North, a rise in antislavery sentiment, and the splintering of politicalparties along sectional lines. Here was the anticipated political upheavalbeyond anyone’s control. “Let the old parties go to destruction,” Douglassgleefully urged, “and henceforth let there be only a free party, and a slaveparty.”37 [notes01.html#ch14fn_37a] A whole new front of attack seemed now tohave opened, the ironic result of the Slave Power’s insatiable quests fordominion.The social furor and the rapid political realignment that gave birth to theRepublican Party in 1854 provided the kind of revolutionary circumstanceDouglass sought. He exploited every opportunity to expose the growing hostilitybetween North and South, employing the concept of “irrepressible conflict”considerably before the Republican William H. Seward made it famous in 1858.Douglass strove not to assuage fears of the impending crisis but to hasten itscoming. By 1855 he proclaimed, “The hour which shall witness the final struggleis on the wing. Already we hear the booming of the bell which shall yet toll thedeath knell of human slavery.” As the old prophets had foretold for their owndecadent and lost age, a vengeful and just God, and Douglass would add naturallaw, made this American conflict a certainty. His message was—people, get ready.“As a nation,” Douglass exhorted, “if we are wise, we will prepare for the lastconflict . . . in which the enemy of Freedom must capitulate.” His fondest hopewas that the new politics would bring an age of “Truth and Error, Liberty andSlavery, in a hand-to-hand conflict.” In the old stories, Douglass told hisreaders, they would find the vision to end all compromises. He performed ineditorials as a prophet with an ultimate duty of hope. “The disintegration ofthe once powerful political parties,” he announced, “is a cheering andsignificant sign of the times. The throne of the despot is trembling to its deepfoundations. There is a good time coming.”38 [notes01.html#ch14fn_38a]The imprecision of such rhetoric required at least a clarified enemy. Theabstract evil of slavery was never sufficient. But in the concept of the SlavePower Douglass found a means to convert the enemy of black people into the enemyof all Americans. The idea of a Slave Power conspiracy was at least as old asthe 1820s, but in the 1850s it became the staple of antislavery rhetoric.Douglass had plied these waters before the Republicans made it their own. In May1853 he gave the Slave Power clear definition. It was “a purely slavery party”in national affairs, and its branches reached “far and wide in church andstate.” The conspiracy’s chief objectives were suppression of abolitionistspeech, removal of free blacks from the United States, guarantees for slavery inthe West, the “nationalization” of slavery in every state of the Union, and theexpansion of slavery to Mexico and South America. If not stopped, the SlavePower would “drive the Almighty from the councils of the nation” as it “shot itsleprous distilment through the life-blood” of the people. Slavery was no longermerely a moral wrong committed against black people in the South, but a wideningthreat to the liberties of white people. “One end of the slave’s chain must befastened to a padlock in the lips of northern freemen,” Douglass wrote, “elsethe slave will himself become free.”39 [notes01.html#ch14fn_39a]Here now was an enemy of all mankind. Everything was at stake. “Slavery aims atabsolute sway,” Douglass argued in 1854. “It would drive out the schoolmasterand install the slave-driver, burn the schoolhouse and install the whippingpost, prohibit the Holy Bible and establish the bloody slave code, dishonor freelabor with its hope of reward, and establish slave labor with its dread of thelash.” This evil heart of the political system had to be surrounded, stopped,and killed. By 1855, as the Kansas crisis deepened, Douglass saw the Slave Poweras an all-encompassing national plague with a “natural craving after human fleshand blood.” It was an onslaught upon the rights of all Americans to sustain theclaims of a few. Most poignantly, the Slave Power delivered its “Decalogue ofslavery . . . written all over the country, in its highways and its hedges, itsvillages and towns, and cities.” It had to expend “every energy in expanding thearea of despotism” to feed its survival. Citizen Douglass, imagining the unknownrevolution to come, demanded war upon this monster. “Show the enemy no quarter,”he pleaded. “Annihilation, not restriction, this is the motto to be inscribedupon our banners. Off with his head and his heart will cease to beat forever.”40[notes01.html#ch14fn_40a] He put prudence aside; the politics of fear explodedfrom the pages of the radical journalist in Rochester.Like several other abolitionists, Douglass later became a kind of historian ofthe Slave Power, devoting an entire chapter, “The Increasing Demands of theSlave Power,” to the topic in his 1881 autobiography, Life and Times. Searchingfor a central theme of the 1850s, Douglass honored his fellow abolitionists, butgave greater credit to the “aggressive character of slavery itself.” InDouglass’s telling, antislavery agitators merely reaped the political results ofthe slavocracy’s innate aggression to dominate the nation’s future. In Life andTimes he quoted the long section of his 1853 New York speech in which heanalyzed the character of the Slave Power. He chose an excerpt probing theslaveholders’ anxious obsession with “security.” But again, he summoned Isaiahto his aid: “There can be no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.” Even if “everyantislavery tongue . . . were silent—every antislavery organization dissolved,”Douglass said, “still the slaveholder could have no peace.” In 1881, as in the1850s, Douglass still needed to declare God, nature, history, and psychology onthe side of abolition. “In every pulsation of his [the slaveholder’s] heart, inevery throb of his life, in every glance of his eye . . . would still be wakedan accuser, whose cause is, ‘thou art verily guilty concerning thy brother.’ ”41[notes01.html#ch14fn_41a]As the accuser Douglass found a new arena in politics. But the struggle demandeda new kind of will and persuasion. Douglass wanted the controversy to causeAmericans to look inward and not simply to the West or to Washington.Confrontation with the Slave Power, the editor hoped, would force an even deeperconfrontation with race. Black humanity, or whether blacks had rights exceedingthose of a horse, Douglass claimed in 1856, formed “the grand hinge of Americanpolitics.” He did not want the Slave Power frenzy at election time to deflectattention from a deeper enemy—racism itself. He remained on guard against thetendency in antislavery politics of “opposing slavery but hating its victims.”Hence, Douglass’s bitter chastisements of Horace Greeley on the issue of blacksuffrage. The famed editor of the New York Tribune advised blacks to lie low, bepatient about the right to vote, and concentrate rather on their own “moraldebasement.” They should stop “jawing about their rights,” Greeley wrote withwhat Douglass called “condescension.” Such counsel of patience appalledDouglass, and he fought back, insisting upon complete equality at the polls,vowing never to keep “out of sight,” and invoking Byron: “They who would befree, themselves must strike the blow.” Greeley’s comments remained useful as arecruiting device. To draw blacks to a national convention in the fall of 1855,Douglass said, “The eye of the world is upon us.” Urged to “keep out of sight,”he wryly announced, “our counselors should be aware that black bodies appear tobetter advantage in the sunlight.”42 [notes01.html#ch14fn_42a]As Douglass made the Slave Power rhetoric his own, he also worried about thepotential for compromise. Seeking consensus with the Slave Power, Douglassmaintained, would be “thawing a deadly viper instead of killing it.” A radicalpragmatist had many fences to straddle now; all he could do was to keep faith inthe “monster’s” inherent tendency to overreach and destroy itself. Coining a newlabel in 1855, Douglass called the slavocracy the “Black Power,” arguing that itwould go the way of all absolute despotisms. “While crushing its millions,” hesaid, “it is also crushing itself.” It had “made such a frightful noise” withthe “Fugitive Slave Act . . . the Nebraska Bill, the recent marauding movementsof the oligarchy in Kansas,” that it now performed as the abolitionists’ “mostpotent ally.” Douglass detected a great change in Northern public opinion.Instead of regarding the abolitionists as mere fanatics “crying wolf,” themasses now perceived the evil in their midst and themselves cried “kill thewolf.”43 [notes01.html#ch14fn_43a]• • •More than from any other single issue before the war, Douglass derived his senseof political pragmatism from coming to grips with the Republican Party, the oddassemblage of former Whigs, antislavery Democrats, Liberty Party men, and evennativists who all coalesced around stopping the expansion of slavery. Hisreactions ranged from vehement opposition to cautious support. Two contradictorythemes run through all of Douglass’s rhetoric regarding the Republicans. Hedemanded adherence to abolitionist principles; the free-soil position,therefore, offered him little immediate satisfaction, even as it provided hopeof thwarting slavery’s future. But simultaneously, he found it impossible toresist the appeal of a broad coalition that could discredit slavery.From 1854 to the Civil War, Douglass found much to attack in Republicanideology. At times he condemned “free soilism” and the Slave Power with almostthe same ire. “Free soilism is lame, halt, and blind,” wrote Douglass in 1855,“while it battles against the spread of slavery, and admits its right to existanywhere.” His editorials occasionally burned with bitterness over thenonextension argument. Drawing a boundary around slavery, though a departure,seemed so limited to one who had grown up on immediatism. “Instead of walkingstraight up to the giant wrong and demanding its utter overthrow,” hecomplained, “we are talking of limiting it, circumscribing it, surrounding itwith free states, and leaving it to die of inward decay.” To Douglass in1855–56, the Republican vision seemed a hollow promise leaving millions doomedto bondage.44 [notes01.html#ch14fn_44a]By the presidential election year of 1856, Douglass refused to formally join theRepublican Party and tried to steadfastly adhere to abolitionist principles. TheRepublicans, he asserted in April, possessed “not a single warm and livingposition . . . except freedom in Kansas” and represented only a “sinuouspolitical philosophy, which is the grand corrupter of all reforms.” As the titleof an editorial indicated, Douglass intended to do his “duty as an antislaveryvoter.” That duty meant emphasis on the “sin” of slavery and the impossibilityof property in man; it meant, at least at this juncture, the preservation of his“antislavery integrity.”45 [notes01.html#ch14fn_45a] But another potent forcedrew Douglass to the duty of hope, to the agonizing awareness that slavery hadto be met in the shadow lands of politics.Douglass’s denunciations of the Kansas-Nebraska Act led almost inevitably totacit support of the emerging Republican Party, formed in the law’s turbulentwake. The Kansas controversy had become the “great question of the age,” he saidby fall 1854, and it prompted him to devise his own strangely naïve scheme formaking Kansas a free state. Douglass proposed an ambitious emigration plan bywhich one thousand free black families from Northern cities would be resettledin Kansas territory. His “army of One Thousand families” was to be organized andfinanced by Northern philanthropy. But fervor is about all Douglass could givehis own idea. “The true antidote . . . for black slaves,” he argued, “is anenlightened body of black freemen.” Suddenly, Douglass was an impracticalemigrationist dreamer. Douglass’s plan conveniently ignored, for an interlude,that the “free labor” ideology around which the Republicans had formed meant formany free white labor.46 [notes01.html#ch14fn_46a] Douglass soon abandoned whathe admitted was an “imperfectly presented” scheme.From such a combination of confusion, idealism, and frustration, Douglassapproached the election of 1856. The “purity” and “high anti-slavery ground” hehad demanded in spring gave way slowly over the summer. He continued to proclaimhimself a devotee of Gerrit Smith and his new Radical Abolition Party, whichpushed the doctrine that the federal government had the duty to abolish slaveryeverywhere. In a June 1856 endorsement of the Radical Party, he kept faith withhis mentor that “Policy is controlled by Principle, and not Principle byPolicy.” Using a strict antislavery conception of the Constitution, Douglassstayed on high ground: “Whatever is right is practicable.” But by AugustDouglass did an about-face, shocking some of his friends, and enthusiasticallyendorsed for president the Republican John C. Frémont, famous western explorerand former California senator. Suddenly, Douglass preached expediency like anold ward boss. His “heart and judgment” still clung to Gerrit Smith’sprinciples, he insisted, like “ivy to the oak.” But the “time has passed,”Douglass now believed, “for an honest man to attempt any defense of a right tochange his opinion as to political methods of opposing slavery.” He justifiedhis flip-flop by claiming a desire to affect power by any means possible.“Antislavery consistency itself requires of the antislavery voter thatdisposition of his vote . . . which, in all the circumstances . . . tend[s] mostto the triumph of Free Principles. . . . Right antislavery action is that whichdeals the . . . deadliest blow upon slavery that can be given at that particulartime. Such action is always consistent, however different may be the formsthrough which it expresses itself.”47 [notes01.html#ch14fn_47a] He thus offereda capacious definition to political pragmatism.Douglass further defended his turnabout by arguing that he would do his best touphold the Radical Abolition platform within the ranks of the Republicans.Moreover, all the depredations of the Slave Power demanded a forceful response.He wanted abolition politics to be the “aggressor” at the ballot box, instead ofalways on the fringe. With “slavery extension,” Douglass argued, slaveholdershad given abolitionists an invitation to battle, and he understood just how muchRepublicans, with their capacity to win high offices, threatened the South.Douglass urged his radical friends to “take them [Republicans] . . . not merelyfor what they are but for what we have good reason to believe they will become.”Republicans were millions strong, while Radical Abolitionists operated like“dwellers in the mountain peaks of the moral world.” Douglass urged a vote forFrémont as the path to do “a possible good thing” while larger aims could wait.Stop seeking purity, he told his critics among radicals, and start with what ispossible. “The Ethiopian can change his opinion,” he wrote during the fallcampaign, “if not his color, and yet be perfectly true to the great cause of hislife.”48 [notes01.html#ch14fn_48a]Douglass’s 1856 endorsement of the Republican Party conformed to a pattern hehad established in 1848 and 1852 when he supported the Free Soil Party. In theLiberty Party and its doctrinal successor, the Radical Abolitionists, Douglassalways had a party for his principles, but in the Republicans, as with the FreeSoilers before, he found a party for his hopes. In late August 1856 he wrote toGerrit Smith, hoping his mentor would understand if not approve: “I supportFremont as the best thing I can do now, but without losing sight of the greatdoctrines and measures, inseparable from your great name and character.” Itwould hardly be the last time Douglass cast his vote for hope in generalelections, then in off-year contests retreated to his principles among theradicals. By the fall of 1857, in the wake of Frémont’s defeat by JamesBuchanan, Douglass changed his tune markedly about the Republicans, chargingthem with “culpable imbecility” and “narrow, contracted conservatism.” Becauseit had not embraced any form of black equality and sought only power in numbers,the Republican Party had become “rotten,” Douglass maintained, and did not“deserve success.”49 [notes01.html#ch14fn_49a]But for the rest of his life Douglass voted for a Republican for president.Frémont did extremely well against the Democrat James Buchanan, known widely asa Northern man with Southern sympathies. Although defeated, the Republicans, asa sectional antislavery party, loomed as a powerful threat to Southerninterests, despite their not even being on the ballot in most slave states.Buchanan was elected with only 45 percent of the vote, while Frémont drew 33percent and the Know-Nothing party (nativist) candidate, Millard Fillmore,garnered 21 percent. The election settled little in the slavery crisis, exceptthat the Slave Power, in the view of most antislavery Northerners, now had awilling advocate in the White House and the Republicans had the potential todivide American politics.• • •Within two days of Buchanan’s inauguration in March 1857, the US Supreme Courtannounced the Dred Scott decision, and once again, everything seemed to change.Dred Scott’s legal quest for his freedom because of a nearly five-year residenceon the free soil of the state of Illinois and the free territory of Minnesotahad wound its way through lower courts for years in Missouri and finally reachedthe docket of the Supreme Court in 1854. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, aMarylander and former slaveowner, and his 7–2 majority on the Court first ruledon jurisdiction, declaring Scott not a citizen due to his race and thereforewithout any right to sue in federal court. Under pressure to somehow “settle”the vexing problem of slavery expansion once and for all, Taney and his majoritywent further and declared the Missouri Compromise line of 1820 unconstitutional.They upheld a slaveholder’s right to use and transport his private property inslaves under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Congressionalauthority over slave property, said Taney resoundingly, extended only to“guarding and protecting the owner in his rights.” But then Taney went furtheryet and made infamous history with an opinion proclaiming that blacks “had formore than a century been regarded as beings of an inferior order . . . so farinferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.”50[notes01.html#ch14fn_50a]To antislavery Northerners the idea of a Slave Power conspiracy had never seemedso evident. In the wake of Dred Scott v. Sandford shock waves spread acrossAmerican society like nothing before it in the long story of the slavery debate.Most white Southerners could not have been more delighted by a decision of theHigh Court confirming their long-argued claim of state sovereignty—the right ofslave ownership everywhere. The message to the North was that legally, slaverycould indeed not be prevented in any western territory, and perhaps even in thefree states themselves. Some Republicans openly anticipated now a second DredScott decision doing just that—making slave property inviolable in the entireUnited States.51 [notes01.html#ch14fn_51a] On the day after Taney’s announcementAfrican Americans, free or enslaved, lived in the land of the Dred Scottdecision, in the country that now declared from its highest councils that blackpeople had no future as citizens in the United States.In the wake of Dred Scott, the operative emotion in Northern black communitiesand among abolitionists was either despair or revolutionary outrage. It quicklycaused a revival of emigrationist fervor and divisive debate among black leaderstrying to imagine a secure future. And it revived open contemplation of violentresistance. In May 1857, Douglass delivered a major address, “The Dred ScottDecision,” in New York as well as other venues in the coming summer. The longspeech is a remarkably tortured illustration of his efforts to perform hisself-styled duty of hope in the face of the thunderous rejection handed down bythe American nation. The court’s decision, said Douglass, was a “vile andshocking abomination.” Though it seemed that “the omens are all against us,” andultimate emancipation merely a “wild, delusive idea,” he promised to signal“signs of encouragement.”52 [notes01.html#ch14fn_52a]Douglass drew from his most fundamental sources of history, spirit, andphilosophy, from the natural-rights tradition and a biblical sense of long-termfaith that Providence would still guide their cause toward justice. This was,however, a tough sell in 1857. He first had to lay down the status of woe andgloom by embodying the despair: “I own myself not insensible to the manydifficulties and discouragements that beset us on every hand. They fling theirbroad and gloomy shadows across the pathway of every thoughtful colored man inthis country.” Douglass captured the horrible uncertainties of the moment. “Isee them clearly, and feel them sadly. With an earnest, aching heart, I havelong looked for the realization of the hope of my people . . . and looking outupon the boundless sea of the future, I have sought in my humble way, topenetrate the intervening mists and clouds, and perchance, to descry in the dimand shadowy distance the white flag of freedom, the precise speck of time atwhich the . . . long entombed millions rise from the foul grave of slavery anddeath.” Personal and group pain had to be named and expressed before any newresolve could be imagined; Douglass thus gave Taney and the nation an answer aslyrical as it was terrible: “But of that time, I can know nothing, and you canknow nothing. All is uncertain at this point.”53 [notes01.html#ch14fn_53a]As usual, Douglass then shifted key and appealed to God and nature, to the oldstories and old faiths. Where else could he go? “David, you know,” pleadedDouglass, “looked small and insignificant when going to meet Goliath, but lookedlarger when he had slain his foe.” He took heart that antislavery hadtransformed into its new political mode. He reminded his auditors that everycompromise on slavery extension had purported to “settle” the question, but hadnever succeeded. “The fact is, the more the question has been settled, the moreit has needed settling.” Above all, Douglass turned to “higher law” doctrine.“The Supreme Court of the United States is not the only power in the world,”Douglass fervently declared, “but the Supreme Court of the Almighty is greater.”Taney “could not change the essential nature of things, making evil good, andgood evil.” Repeatedly Douglass invoked the “law of nature” and of God’simminent actions. The speech became a kind of political prayer delivered by aprophet summoning God to the aid of history.54 [notes01.html#ch14fn_54a]In Douglass’s view, God and history were merely “keeping the nation awake,” asthe Slave Power advanced too far, “poisoning, corrupting . . . the institutionsof the country,” readying the people for “the lightning, whirlwind, andearthquake” to come. He grasped hope from a dreadful narrative of cataclysm andwoe. Douglass’s speech fell at times into a frustrating vagueness, with appealsto keep faith in the “tendencies of the age.” But stunningly, he ended theaddress with open advocacy of violence, an entreaty for all to remember that theslaves might at any time rise in insurrection. Most strikingly, he recited twoverses of his own poem “The Tyrant’s Jubilee,” a long, remarkable work he hadpublished in his paper in January 1857:The fire thus kindled, may be revived again;The flames are extinguished, but the embers remain;One terrible blast may produce an ignition,Which shall wrap the whole South in wild conflagration.The pathway of tyrants lies over volcanoes;The very air they breathe is heavy with sorrows;Agonizing heart-throbs convulse them while sleeping,And the wind whispers Death as over them sweeping.Slavery was doomed, Douglass assured his audiences; of that he was “morallycertain.” But he stood ready to expect emancipation by “fair means or foulmeans, in quiet or in tumult, in peace or in blood.”55 [notes01.html#ch14fn_55a]Prophets must say what they see, however dreadful and uncertain. Within eightmonths of his Dred Scott speech, Douglass and his family hosted for three weeksat their Rochester house a guest who would fulfill and trouble Douglass’sprophecy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 15--------------------------------------------------------------------------------JOHN BROWN COULD DIE FOR THE SLAVEJohn Brown’s raid upon Harpers Ferry was all his own. . . . His zeal in thecause of freedom was infinitely superior to mine. Mine was as the taper light,his was as the burning sun. I could speak for the slave. John Brown could fightfor the slave. I could live for the slave, John Brown could die for the slave.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, HARPERS FERRY, 1881John Brown was charismatic, inspiring, confounding, courageous, mysterious,intimidating, given to religious zealotry, and even at times a bit boring. Buthe and his deeds were unforgettable. Before Frederick Douglass first met Brownin 1847, or possibly early 1848, in Springfield, Massachusetts, Douglass hadheard about him, especially from other black abolitionists, who “when speakingof him, their voices would lower to a whisper.”1 [notes01.html#ch15fn_1a] Atouch of legend, creatively crafted in Life and Times, infused Douglass’sextraordinary remembrance of his relationship with the leader of the HarpersFerry raid.In real time, Douglass’s first recorded description of Brown, written in theNorth Star in February 1848 after returning from a lecture tour, conforms tolater remembrances. Brown was among the key people Douglass met in Springfieldafter delivering a lecture that the local paper deemed objectionable because theformer fugitive had “stigmatized the whole country” as a “slave huntingcommunity.” Whether Brown attended the lecture is not clear, but in whatDouglass called a “private interview” Brown left a lasting impression onDouglass. “Mr. Brown is one of the most earnest and interesting men that I havemet,” said the orator. Although white, Brown came across in “sympathy a blackman, and is deeply interested in our cause, as though his own soul had beenpierced with the iron of slavery.”2 [notes01.html#ch15fn_2a]Brown ran a wool business in Springfield out of a large store and warehouse, oneof many such enterprises as a merchant, a tanner, and a farmer that he launchedover three decades, almost all of which failed and left his huge family poor.During this first encounter, Douglass spent the night with Brown’s family inwhat Douglass remembered as their “Spartan” house. So large and controversialhad Brown grown in national memory, that in his recollection in Life and TimesDouglass strove for unusual detail. He remembered the simple ingredients servedat dinner, the walls “innocent of paint,” the table “unmistakably of pine and ofthe plainest workmanship.” Everything about John Brown and his house reflected,said Douglass, the “stern truth, solid purpose, and rigid economy” of the man.Brown “fulfilled St. Paul’s idea of the head of the family,” Douglass observed,his wife and children treating him “with reverence.” As though fashioning theprecise characteristics of a fictional character, Douglass described Brown’sfacial features, his hair, his height and weight, even the color of his eyes,which in “conversation . . . were full of light and fire.” Brown walked with “along, springing race-horse step, absorbed by his own reflections.” Here, risingout from the “whispers,” Douglass announced was “Captain John Brown . . . one ofthe most marked characters and greatest heroes known to American fame.”3[notes01.html#ch15fn_3a]But a great deal of troubled reality lay beneath Douglass’s literary reinventionof 1881. The twelve-year relationship between Douglass and Brown is one goodlens through which to view both men. During the 1850s, as Douglass moved towardat least open support of violent means, the two abolitionists spent many hoursand days in each other’s company. As Douglass came within John Brown’s orbit ofreligious fervor and theories of violent resistance, Douglass listened even ashe was sometimes repelled.Born in Torrington, Connecticut, in 1800, Brown grew up primarily on the WesternReserve in Hudson, Ohio. His father, Owen, bestowed a staunch Calvinism in hisson. Brown’s memories of childhood were layered with dislocation and loss,especially that of his mother, who died when the boy was only eight. His fathermarried three times and sired sixteen children, a pattern John eventually morethan matched with two wives and twenty children, many of whom did not reachadulthood. In John’s youth, the Browns’ household in Ohio funneled fugitiveslaves on to liberty in the region or in Canada; Owen was a devout Christianabolitionist. By the time Douglass and John Brown met, and for the duration oftheir relationship, among the sensibilities and experiences that they sharedwere a relative lack of formal education, the humiliations and necessities ofbegging for money, an Atlantic crossing to Liverpool on the Cambria (at separatetimes), a Bible-inspired sense that history could undergo apocalyptic change,and a passionate hatred of slavery as a system at war with humanity.4[notes01.html#ch15fn_4a]At that first meeting in Springfield, Brown and Douglass conversed long into thenight at a table in candlelight. Brown unfolded a large map of the United Statesand pointed to the Alleghenies. “These mountains,” Douglass recalled Brownasserting, “are the basis of my plan. God has given the strength of the hills tofreedom; they were placed here for the emancipation of the Negro race.” For manyyears to come, decoding just what the elements of Brown’s “plan” were became abeguiling preoccupation for Douglass and others. On that night in Springfield,he was enthralled but skeptical; he never claimed to know with any certainty thepurpose of the Virginia mountains, morally or geologically. Brown, however,imagined them “full of natural forts” and “good hiding places.” Beginning withonly twenty-five trained men, he would “run off the slaves in large numbers” inat least one Virginia county. Somehow in these mountain hideaways they wouldfight off the inevitable force that would assemble in counterattack, and many ofthe local slaves would join their force. The “true object,” Douglass gleaned,seemed to be destroying “the money value of slave property.” That aim Douglassunderstood. But then he pushed back with questions Brown could answer only inmoralistic, not strategic, terms. How would he “support” his men? Douglassasked. What would Brown do when surrounded by the “bloodhounds” of the SlavePower’s police state when roused? Brown thought he could whip them, but if hecould not and was killed in such guerrilla action, “he had no better use for hislife than to lay it down in the cause of the slave.”5 [notes01.html#ch15fn_5a]In this reinvented conversation, Douglass expressed a harsh truth about Brown.The old warrior worked passionately for years on a plan that in the end may haverepresented a personal desire to sacrifice for the slaves more than a genuinestrategy for revolution.• • •In these years Douglass looked anxiously for a logic in violence. The problemwith Brown was that he could never be completely squared with rationality. Butas we have seen, in the wake of the Fugitive Slave Act or Dred Scott, logic wasno longer the weapon of choice for a radical abolitionist. Douglass admittedthat the more contact he had with Brown, “my utterances became more and moretinged by the color of this man’s strong impressions.” Douglass and Browncontinued to correspond through the early 1850s, and they eventually met on manymore occasions. At least as early as 1851 the two exchanged letters making sureBrown received Douglass’s paper. And in 1854, after Brown had moved to Akron,Ohio, he wrote an extraordinary epistle to Douglass in the voice of an OldTestament prophet chastising the evils of American leaders and their poisonedinstitutions. It was as though Brown wanted to join Douglass in condemning theSlave Power, but to do so with even more biblical rage. Worried about the fateof the American republic, Brown had no doubt about what stood in its path: theproslavery “extreme wickedness” of political and religious leadership at alllevels, even the “marshals, sheriffs, constables and policemen.”6[notes01.html#ch15fn_6a]We do not have Douglass’s direct response to this letter, but what he read inBrown’s condemnations of American perfidy was a denunciation, even beyondhigher-law doctrine, that left only violence as an option. American leadershipwas taking the country into “anarchy in all its horrid forms,” Brown argued.Therefore, he had a ready answer: “What punishment ever inflicted by man or eventhreated by God, can be too severe for those whose influence is a thousand timesmore malignant than the atmosphere of the deadly Upas—for those who hate theright and the Most High.” To Brown, God governed the universe and its man-madenations. Hence, the only alternative for the righteous was to destroy such“fiends clothed in human form.” Brown trusted Douglass’s knowledge of Scriptureas he poured forth passages from the Old and New Testaments. To a degree Brownand Douglass shared a biblical grounding. The real laws of the United States forBrown were God’s commands. “Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servantwhich is escaped. . . . Thou shalt not oppress him,” he recited from Deuteronomyin his letter to Douglass. From Matthew, Brown revisited the famous command“Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye evenso to them; for this is the law and the prophets.” And in Nehemiah he found hisindictment of rulers who had forsaken God’s law: “Remember them, O my God,because they have defiled the priesthood.” Nehemiah had “smote” and “cleansed”when necessary the wayward Israelites. As Brown wrote to Douglass in early 1854,even before the Kansas-Nebraska Act, Brown seemed lonely and mired in a deepChristian despair over the “abominably wicked . . . laws” of the country. But hefully expected a reckoning to come. “I am too destitute of words to express thetithe of what I feel,” Brown concluded, as he begged Douglass to convey hisappeal in “suitable language” to a larger world.7 [notes01.html#ch15fn_7a]By and large, Douglass did just that. He admired and used the Hebrew prophets,and Brown not only looked and talked like one, he seemed willing to challenge ordestroy the wicked Jerusalem. In Life and Times, Douglass confessed that henever felt in the “presence of a stronger religious influence” than in thecompany of John Brown. Although Douglass honored human law more, perhaps thesensibility that he and Brown shared most in the long run was a millennial andapocalyptic sense of history, drawn from the old stories of the prophets andfrom the zeitgeist of antebellum America. In that era millennialist thought wasa cluster of religious and secular ideas forged into a kind of national creed.In its more hopeful mode, it held that Christ would have a Second Coming in the“new Israel” of America, or at least that the country possessed a mission as a“redeemer nation” destined to perform a special role in history. Millennialismwas an outlook on history, a disposition about human nature, a belief thatAmerica was a place where mankind had been given a second chance; and above all,that God governed history and chose the moments of transformation. A nation ofProtestants could interpret events as steps in its providential destiny. Thedarker side of millennialism exposed the burden of chosenness; an eschatologicalexpectation of God’s wrath and destruction meant that people must constantlyprepare for a break in time and new beginnings.8 [notes01.html#ch15fn_8a]Both Douglass and Brown shared this vision. Sterner and bleaker, Brown’smillennialism manifested in daily devotions and instructions to his children.Brown’s son Salmon remembered his father’s strict Sabbath observance: “Sundayevenings he would gather the family and hired help . . . and have the TenCommandments and the Catechism repeated. Sometimes he would preach a regularsermon. . . . Besides we had prayers morning and night of every day, with Biblereading, all standing during prayer, father himself leaning on a chair, uprearedon the forward legs, the old-fashioned Presbyterian way.” Brown’s faith wasrooted in a deeply personal concern about sin, his own and that of others,especially his children. “He constantly expostulated with us,” said Salmon, “andin letters when away. His expressed hope was ‘that ye sin not, that you form nofoolish attachments, that you be not a ‘companion to fools.’ ”9[notes01.html#ch15fn_9a]Brown was often hardest on himself, on his own profound need for atonement. Hisrecord of business failures, his struggle to provide meager sustenance to hisbrood as he lost more than one farm, and his imprisonment for debt in the wakeof the panic of 1837 left him many inner demons. Writing to all his children inlate 1852, he worried that they had lost the faith he had instilled in them,even as he blamed himself. He admitted to “little, very little to cheer” andhoped that his “family may understand that this world is not the Home of man.”He urged his sons and daughters not to reflect on how their father had “wanderedfrom the Road,” but to pray to God for their own “thorough conversion from sin”and to stay “steadfast in his ways through the very short season of trial youwill have to pass.” In the midst of such religious affliction, Brown ended theletter worried about whether the family could afford to “pay for Douglas paper.”In a remarkable letter to his eldest son, John Jr., in 1853, Brown expressed“pain and sorrow” at the young man’s loss of faith. Then John Sr. drew uponpassages from the first five books of the Old Testament to warn his erring sonwith the words of Moses, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, and Samuel not to fall into the“same disposition in Israel to backslide.” Brown’s sons were devotedabolitionists; they followed their father for their own reasons, perhaps leastof all because he had used Joshua to instruct them. John Jr. later experienced amental breakdown in Kansas in 1856, captured, beaten, and imprisoned afterfighting as a guerrilla warrior at his father’s side. Another son, Frederick,was killed in the Kansas war. John Brown’s personal holy war on slavery becamean extended family disaster.10 [notes01.html#ch15fn_10a]Douglass, on the other hand, was a father deeply concerned with his children’sliteracy and education, but we do not know as much about his concern for theirreligious temperaments. He seems to have worried more about their writing skillsthan their faith. “I know this is not as good writing as you would like to see,”wrote his fifteen-year-old son Charles in 1860, “but I am in haste so goodnight.”11 [notes01.html#ch15fn_11a]In these years, Douglass’s millennialism and his religious faith were a set ofroot values layered throughout his oratory and his writing. He arrived at hisspiritual understanding of history through his lifelong informal theologicalmeans—reading the Bible and a good deal of history, and especially by his yearsof rhetorical engagement on abolitionist platforms, listening to and arguingwith Garrison, Phillips, Gerrit Smith, McCune Smith, Remond, Delany, AbbyKelley, and others. Douglass’s millennialism was forward-looking and activist.Waiting for the “jubilee” of black emancipation and the fulfillment of America’snational destiny required patience, but also struggle; it demanded faith, andsuffering.Douglass played the prophetic role of the “suffering servant” with zeal. Hisfamous statement about agitation, delivered in a speech in 1857, has stood thetest of time and numerous protest ideologies: “If there is no struggle there isno progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation, aremen who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunderand lightning. This struggle may be a moral one, or it may be a physical one,and it may be both moral and physical, but it must be a struggle. Power concedesnothing without a demand. It never did and it never will.” Those were whatMcCune Smith had called Douglass’s “work-able, do-able words” for the ages.12[notes01.html#ch15fn_12a]In his analysis of the Slave Power, Douglass accepted political and moral lossas the price of an inevitable progress. Sometimes his rhetoric could seem drivenby a vague moral determinism. The enemies, slavery and freedom, wereirreconcilable, he wrote in 1855, but freedom must triumph because it had the“laws which govern the moral universe” on its side. A collision between thesetwo enemy forces “must come,” Douglass maintained, “as sure as the laws of Godcannot be trampled upon with impunity.”13 [notes01.html#ch15fn_13a]Millennialists had a peculiarly persistent need for that word “must.” It keptthem moving through the thickets of uncertainty.But for Douglass millennial symbolism was not merely a rhetorical device tosustain collective hope; it was a real source of faith. He wanted his thousandblack listeners to see “a celebration of the American jubilee,” Douglassdeclared in Canandaigua, New York, in 1857. “That jubilee will come. You and Imay not live to see it; but . . . God reigns, and slavery must yet fall; unlessthe devil is more potent than the Almighty; unless sin is stronger thanrighteousness, slavery must perish.” History possessed a trajectory, not easilydiscerned. “There was something God-like” in the British decree of emancipationin the West Indies in the 1830s, Douglass proclaimed. He knew that Britishemancipation was more complex than spiritual imagery alone could convey, but hecould not resist calling the event a “wondrous transformation” and a “bolt fromthe moral sky.” He called on African Americans to see West Indian emancipationas “a city upon a hill” to light the way toward their own new history.14[notes01.html#ch15fn_14a] Such faith was difficult to sustain after the DredScott decision.In a letter to a Scottish antislavery society, with which Julia Griffiths nowworked to raise money for Douglass’s paper, the editor acknowledged darkportents hanging over the abolitionist cause. Then he gave his correspondent agood dose of millennial medicine: “I am now at work less under the influences orinspiration of hope, than the settled assurances of faith in God—and theultimate triumph of Righteousness in the world. The cause of the slaves is arighteous and humane one. . . . Though long delayed, it will triumph at last.”15[notes01.html#ch15fn_15a] Torn at times between warring options, Douglass knewhe must travel by faith as much as by sight.But he would also have his fellow blacks see and act as well as believe in theirpath to liberation, and thus perhaps his sustained interest in Brown’srevolutionary schemes. Emancipation in the British empire gave Douglass a grandhistorical precedent and a reason to issue a call to arms in his own country.Americans were good at “fast days and fourth of Julys,” Douglass said, but their“sequel” never showed anything but “men whose hearts are crammed with arrogancy,pride, and hate.” Then, characteristically, Douglass found his firm footing andhis story in Isaiah 58: “We have bowed down our heads as a bulrush, and havespread sackcloth and ashes under us.” Isaiah had warned so poignantly againstfalse fasting. The House of Jacob fasted, but in the end “seest not” and “takestno knowledge.” In his own best King James language, Douglass argued just thesame for Americans who could not or would not learn from the past. Britishemancipation had been an act, he believed, not about “commerce, but conscience,”a “spiritual triumph,” and a “product of the soul.” Rewriting Isaiah nearly wordfor word for a new century and place, Douglass declared his countrymen incapableof what the British had created: “a chosen fast of the Living God . . . a day inwhich the bands of wickedness were loosed; the heavy burdens undone; theoppressed let go free; every yoke broken; the poor that were cast out of thehouse brought in; and men no longer hiding themselves from their own flesh.”16[notes01.html#ch15fn_16a] Instead, Americans were just so many marsh plantssagging over silently in the swamp.To Douglass, though, history was both warning and inspiration. He also used themodel of West Indian emancipation to remind audiences that Jamaican slaves hadrebelled many times on their road to a parliamentary edict of their freedom. Hereminded his black audience in upstate New York of McCune Smith’s overt plea in1856 that they [blacks] not wait for liberty to be given, as in the Britishempire, and instead celebrate their own heroes such as Denmark Vesey and NatTurner. As he so often did in the 1850s, Douglass quoted the passage fromByron’s Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, “Who would be free, themselves must strikethe first blow.” Then, rather stunningly, he reminded his auditors of the blackheroes who had risked death rather than endure slavery—Margaret Garner’sinfanticide, Madison Washington of the Creole shipboard rebellion, Parker andthe Christiana rioters, Joseph Cinqué of the Amistad mutiny. Douglass stressedhow much insurrection had ultimately influenced British colonial planters toaccept abolition and awakened the guilty fears of white Southerners when“General [Nat] Turner kindled the fires of insurrection in Southampton.”Douglass was ready to probe the dark “rebellious disposition of the slaves” ifonly he could find someone with a plan he could trust.17[notes01.html#ch15fn_17a]• • •During the decade before Harpers Ferry, Douglass sustained an abiding interestin aiding Brown’s crusade, less perhaps on strategic grounds than because of thewhite radical’s demonstrable commitment to racial equality. Although theirtemperaments differed markedly, their face-to-face encounters, correspondence,and shared interest in the possibilities of violence sustained a friendship.Many black abolitionists would eventually honor Brown’s racial openness after hedied a martyr’s death; at the heart of his immediate legacy, after all, was theidea that he was the white man who died to set black people free.18[notes01.html#ch15fn_18a]In 1848, shortly after his first meeting with Douglass, Brown published asatirical essay, “Sambo’s Mistakes,” in the black newspaper Ram’s Horn. Writtenin the voice of a black man who needs to confess his misdeeds of apathy,materialism, and sloth, the piece invoked many stereotypes about Northern freeblacks. Instead of taking advantage of education, this Sambo spent his time“devouring silly novels & other miserable trash.” Instead of saving money to buya good farm, he preferred “chewing & smoking tobacco.” Rather than attaining“character & influence among men,” this ne’er-do-well was “obliged to travelabout in search of employment as a hostler shoe black & fiddler.” He could neverpractice self-denial and loved his “Chains, Finger rings, Breast Pins.” Andworst, he confessed to failing as “a citizen, a husband, a father, a brother, aneighbour.”19 [notes01.html#ch15fn_19a] Witty but bizarre, this awkwardlywritten essay demonstrated not only a Puritanical obsession with the foibles ofothers, but a direct attack on the lack of self-reliance among blacks. It couldbe read as misguided racial paternalism, as ironic self-revelatory guilt, or asa righteous chastisement of a disorganized black community that neededupbraiding.With McCune Smith, Douglass had long demanded greater black self-improvementinitiatives and felt frustrated by an apathy he found among free blacks. Hecould “stand the insults . . . and slanders of the known haters” of his people.He welcomed them as a “natural incident of the war.” But what exasperated himwas the “listless indifference” hanging over so many struggling blacks “whoshould be all on fire.” Hence, not only was Douglass impressed with Brown’segalitarianism, but with his direct efforts to help raise black aspirations. In1846 Gerrit Smith purchased a huge tract of 120,000 acres of land in upstate NewYork with the intent of granting it to urban free blacks so they could becomeindependent landowning farmers and thus qualify to vote under that state’ssuffrage law. Although the environment was harsh, some blacks took advantage ofthe utopian plan; and in the spring of 1849 Brown, with his wife, Mary, and fivechildren, joined them in North Elba. There Brown for a while devoted himself toliving among “these poor despised Africans,” as he put it, in settlements knownas Timbucto. Brown employed a free black man named Thomas Jefferson as well as afugitive slave from Florida named Cyrus. Blacks often took meals with the Brownsat their farmhouse. Though as poor as the winters were cold, Brown dispensedoccasional barrels of pork and flour to his neighbors as well as a good deal ofadvice about religion, personal conduct, and resistance to the Fugitive SlaveAct.20 [notes01.html#ch15fn_20a]Douglass was amply aware of Brown’s antiracist venture in North Elba; GerritSmith had granted the Rochesterite a piece of land (which he never occupied) anddid the same for most other black abolitionists. This kind of pioneeringagricultural activism was never Douglass’s sphere, but he eagerly welcomedSmith’s uplift philanthropy among blacks. The sentiments of “Sambo’s Mistakes”appeared in many of Douglass’s editorials and speeches, some of which Brown readin the former slave’s paper. Whether from the backbreaking exertions of farmerson that mountain terrain of North Elba, or the literary and organizationalleadership of black intellectuals, Douglass believed, as he stated in 1855, that“every day brings evidence . . . THAT OUR ELEVATION AS A RACE IS ALMOST WHOLLYDEPENDENT UPON OUR OWN EXERTIONS. If we are ever elevated, our elevation will beaccomplished through our own instrumentality.” He eagerly wanted blacks to taketheir fate into their own hands. “Nothing is more humiliating,” Douglass smuglydeclared in 1857, than his own people’s apathy.21 [notes01.html#ch15fn_21a] Hecould only be moved and glad that a Gerrit Smith and a John Brown wished sosincerely to lend their lives to the quest for equality. But blacks could notwait for their white patrons.To black audiences Douglass could preach as stern a brand of conservativeself-improvement as any black voice of his era. In rhetorical movesrepresentative of a brand of black nationalism, Douglass often turned attacks onwhite racism into angry rebukes of black lethargy. In an 1855 speech at ShilohPresbyterian Church in New York to a mixed audience, Douglass, with McCune Smithchairing the meeting, wondered aloud about how difficult it was to addresscertain sensitive issues among blacks in front of whites. Blacks, Douglass said,too often provided a “spectacle” for all the world to watch in its desire tomeasure the “heights of civilization.” Douglass admitted that the larger worldconstantly asked, are blacks “like other men?” Could the “negro do without amaster,” can he rise from “ignorance to intelligence,” or “disorder to order?”These questions could not “be answered by the white race.” They were “peculiarlythe duties of the colored people.” And blacks’ “doubt among ourselves” stood inthe way and caused Douglass, he confessed, to “blush” and fall into “gloomythoughts.” His people must “show them” (whites) by becoming “skillfularchitects, profound thinkers, originators and discoverers of ideas.” They mustproduce their own Webster, Clay, and Calhoun.22 [notes01.html#ch15fn_22a]Then, as Douglass marched through this stern message, a group of “colored gals”walked into the sanctuary, distracting and annoying the orator, who stopped toupbraid them for not being “punctual.” Regaining his composure, Douglass gave avigorous appeal for violent resistance to slave catchers. “Fear inculcatesrespect,” he proclaimed. “I would rather see insurrection for the next sixmonths in the South than that slavery should exist there for [the] next sixyears.” He left his Shiloh audience laughing with jokes about how whitesautomatically think of blacks as drunk or lazy and ended by singing an abolitionballad to the tune of “I’ll Never Get Drunk Again.”23 [notes01.html#ch15fn_23a]Brown would have wholeheartedly agreed with every gesture, except possibly thejokes.Similarly, three years later, at the same church, but to a largely blackaudience gathered to protest historic discrimination on the Sixth AvenueRailroad in New York, Douglass blasted the “spirit of caste” that robbed hispeople of every kind of civil right. But worst of all, now one year in the wakeof Dred Scott, he feared that the “emancipated colored man” risked having“burned into his very soul the brand of inferiority.” He openly worried in frontof his fellow blacks that an impression had settled upon them implying that “weourselves are unconcerned and even contented with our condition.” Douglassconfronted his auditors harshly: “I detest the slaveholder, and almost equallydetest a contented slave. They are both enemies of freedom.” With no jokes tosoothe the message, he left the 1858 protest rally with the warning that“oppression . . . deadens sensibility in its victims.” The only recourse was tosustain faith not in law but in “ourselves.”24 [notes01.html#ch15fn_24a] Suchfierce appeals for self-reliance, mixed with demands for violent resistance, inthe late 1850s made for a potent if toxic brew of confusion, rage, andbloodlust.• • •As Douglass tried to find firm footing with these issues and with his emergingrelationship with Brown, another kind of confusion walked forthrightly into hislife. Seeking permission to translate and publish My Bondage and My Freedom inGerman, Ottilie Assing first came to visit Douglass in Rochester in the summerof 1856. Born in 1819 in Hamburg to a physician-poet father and a mother who wasa teacher and Romantic poet, Assing had veered from one kind of idealistic andromantic cause to another until, in personal frustration and desperate forindependence, she moved to America in 1852 to pursue a new career as ajournalist. Emotionally volatile (the survivor of at least one suicide attemptwith a dagger she took to her chest when she was twenty-three), a freethinkingatheist, and a devotee of Alexander von Humboldt’s ideas about human equality,Assing soon saw that the most compelling issues in her adopted America were raceand slavery. As a German romantic she was always in search of the hero inhistory, the maker of new nations, new ideas, and new times. By attendingantislavery meetings in New York after she took up residence among other Germanémigrés across the Hudson River in New Jersey, Assing began to discovercandidates for her ideal hero. First there was Wendell Phillips, whom she sawspeak and found enthralling at the annual gathering of the American Anti-SlaverySociety in 1854. Then for a while she became fascinated with James Pennington,the minister of Shiloh Presbyterian Church in New York; Assing wrote a long,unwieldy essay on the black preacher and translated some of his narrative, TheFugitive Blacksmith, until she lost interest, possibly because of a fundamentaldistaste for religion and the black church.25 [notes01.html#ch15fn_25a]The only account we have of Assing and Douglass’s first meeting is Assing’s own,which, in her breathless style, she self-servingly included in her introductionto the German edition of Bondage and Freedom. She must have come to Rochesterall but unannounced since she first stopped at the office of the North Star onlyto discover that the editor was still at home. As a fellow journalist, she hadcome to interview Douglass. So as directed, Assing walked the more than twomiles to South Avenue to find the editor’s homestead. She found a “handsomevilla, surrounded by a large garden . . . situated on a hill overlooking acharming landscape.” But she reserved most of her Vorrede to Sclaverei undFreiheit (the German title of Douglass’s book) for sensuous physicaldescriptions of Douglass as well as a spectacular tribute to his skills as anorator. Employing the words “brilliant” or “brilliance” three times in twosentences, Assing’s Douglass possessed “perfect mastery of language,” and themost “mellifluous, sonorous, flexible . . . voice speaking to the heart as Ihave ever heard.” His very name filled American halls to overflowing, shemaintained, “as if a new apostle had revealed to them for the first time a truththat had lain unspoken in everyone’s heart.”26 [notes01.html#ch15fn_26a]Assing identified Douglass as a “light mulatto of unusually tall, slender, andpowerful stature.” “His features are striking,” she gushed: “the prominentlydomed forehead with a peculiarly deep cleft at the base of the nose, an aquilinenose, and the narrow, beautifully carved lips betray more of his white than hisblack origin. The thick hair, here and there with touches of gray, is frizzy andunruly but not wooly.” Having dispensed with these common nineteenth-centuryracialized depictions, Assing made it clear she had found a romantic hero forthe age: Douglass’s “whole appearance, stamped by past storms and struggles,bespeaks great energy and will power that shuns no obstacle . . . in the face ofall odds.” She observed briefly their wide-ranging conversation, then, in atelling non sequitur, acknowledged bluntly that she met the family: “Douglass’swife is completely black, and his five children, therefore, have more of thetraits of the Negro than he.” The family, especially the children, would get toknow Assing as friend, intruder, and benefactor. The German journalist, with herpowers of observation, had found her Siegfried ready to go slay the Americandragons.27 [notes01.html#ch15fn_27a] Assing’s attraction to Douglass waspermanent, and she would do her best as a propagandist, at least for Germanaudiences, to shape the Rochester editor’s reputation in relation to John Brown.Image [../images/f0292-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, c. 1858. Print from a lost daguerreotype.• • •The saga of how Douglass and Brown forged an important, if tragic, alliancepublicly commenced at the inaugural convention of the Radical Abolition Party inSyracuse, New York, June 26–28, 1855. By then, five of Brown’s sons, led by JohnJr., whose farm in Ohio was failing from drought and debt, had moved to Kansas.That territory had become the feverish test case of the doctrine of “popularsovereignty” laid out in the fateful Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Flocks ofproslavery and Free Soil settlers were moving into the land west of Missouri,and the region teetered on the brink of guerrilla war. Brown praised his sonsfor their commitment to go to Kansas “with a view to help defeat SATAN and hislegions.” The father was still committed to his work among blacks in North Elba,but by the spring of 1855, John Jr. wrote from his farm near Osawatomie that“every slaveholding state is furnishing men and money to fasten Slavery uponthis glorious land, by means no matter how foul.” When his father trekked overhill and dale for 150 miles to get to Syracuse for the convention of the onlypolitical party Brown may have ever joined, Kansas not only fired hisimagination, but that of the nearly three hundred delegates as well.28[notes01.html#ch15fn_28a]The Radical Abolition Party lasted a mere five years. At the 1855 gathering,McCune Smith chaired the proceedings, which Douglass especially celebrated assomething to which black people could “ever proudly refer.” Gerrit Smith was inhis glory as the primary host and funder of the proceeding; and the conventionspent a great deal of time debating and justifying what Douglass referred to asthe “iron-linked logic” of the antislavery interpretation of the Constitution.Most important, the convention’s delegates from ten states and Canada passed aresolution affirming the use of violence to overthrow slavery. Brown wasexhilarated by the convention. According to Douglass, Brown presented the casefor his own decision and that of his sons to go to Kansas and fight for thefree-state cause. Brown quoted from Hebrews as he also appealed for money:“Without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sin.” Gerrit Smith readtwo letters aloud to the assembled body from Brown’s sons to their father, whichonly the proud patriarch could have provided. In one letter they advised theabolitionists to “thoroughly arm and organize themselves” as they begged forrevolvers, rifles, and bowie knives, which they needed “more than . . .bread.”29 [notes01.html#ch15fn_29a]This gathering exuded a radical, biblical militancy not yet seen in formalpolitical abolitionism. McCune Smith used the term “Bible politics” to describethe party’s point of view and called its platform a “Jubilee doctrine . . . moreimportant than the diffusion of the principle of science.” The biracial throngof abolitionists, the physician announced, would “go hence to proclaim thegospel of liberty—for it is the good news, glad tidings of great joy, that wehave to tell.” Douglass seems to have left Syracuse inspired as well. In hispaper he especially reported on the “sweet” abolition songs at the Radicals’convention, as well as that one delegate had been a fugitive slave who had “beenobliged to avail himself of the underground railroad” in order to participateand was now safely residing in Canada. But above all, Douglass said that he andhis comrades at Syracuse were fed up with the idea of limiting slavery andhoping that it “may die out.” He said he now belonged to a party that would lay“the axe to the tree” with a single demand: that it was “THE RIGHT, THE POWER,AND THE DUTY OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ABOLISH SLAVERY IN EVERY STATE IN THEAMERICAN UNION.”30 [notes01.html#ch15fn_30a] Behind the scenes in Syracuse hehad conversations with Brown and helped raise money for his cause. The two wouldnot meet again until late 1856, after the intriguing radical had carved out abloody history in Kansas and launched a conspiracy to attack slavery in theSouth with which Douglass became deeply entwined.No one who knew John Brown ever doubted his bravery, his passion, or that hebelieved he was living and dying as an agent in God’s plan. He went to Kansas inthe fall of 1855 to make war on slavery. As Douglass published and promotedBondage and Freedom that autumn, Brown, accompanied by his teenage son Oliverand a son-in-law, Henry Thompson, traveled west to eastern Kansas primarily bywalking, but also with a horse and a wagon full of weapons. There, with parts ofhis extended family, including women and children, living in tents and shanties,the fifty-five-year-old, soon called Captain Brown, led a band of warriors amongthe free-state forces in what soon became “Bleeding Kansas.”31[notes01.html#ch15fn_31a]Kansas was a brutal physical and political environment. Members of Brown’s clansuffered frostbite and near starvation during the winter of 1855–56, and by thatspring, the numerous murders and depredations by proslavery “border ruffians”from Missouri signaled the wider bloodshed to follow. In May 1856, afterproslavery bands attacked and burned Lawrence, Kansas, the Free Soil bastion ofthe territory, Brown snapped with rage. In retaliation, and against the wishesof some of his sons, Brown orchestrated a bloody middle-of-the-night raid onthree proslavery dwellings along Pottawatomie Creek, resulting in the savagemurder of five men. The victims, all non-slaveholders but supporters of theslave-state cause, were seized from the clutches of their families, taken acouple hundred yards from their cabins, and slashed to death and mutilated withbroadswords. At least two were also shot in the face or chest, likely after theywere already dead. The “Pottawatomie massacre” would forever be part of JohnBrown’s legacy, an uncomfortable challenge to his sympathetic biographers, butample evidence to those who take a clear-eyed look at how Old Brown understoodthe uses and meaning of terror. Brown planned and ordered the murders, andthough he may not have actually committed the slashings, he may have fired thegun. Back east, among his abolitionist supporters and funders, the facts aboutPottawatomie remained for the ensuing three years a matter of willful mysteryand avoidance, as well as part of a legend that the “Old warrior” now cultivatedabout himself in the service of broader schemes.32 [notes01.html#ch15fn_32a]In December 1856, as Brown was traveling eastward to raise money and men, hestopped in Rochester and took dinner at Douglass’s house. Little is known ofwhat they discussed that evening, but in the next two years their collaborationdeepened as Brown repeatedly tried to recruit Douglass to the cause of fomentinga slave uprising in Virginia. Possibly they discussed Brown’s long-standinginterest in military history, slave revolts, and Maroon colonies, as well assome details of the Kansas bloodshed. Whether Brown divulged the reality ofPottawatomie is doubtful, although the idea of slaveholders’ blood on Brown’scoat, whether fresh from the Battle of Osawatomie or from a preemptive, primalkilling in the dark of the night, would only have inspired Douglass. But by thetime he wrote about Brown with long retrospect in 1881, Douglass knew andapproved of what had happened in Kansas. By then Brown was the mythic hero whose“hour had come.” Old “Osawatomie Brown” had merely “met persecution withpersecution, and house-burning with signal and terrible retaliation.” In Lifeand Times Douglass harbored no hesitation in defending Brown’s deeds andmethods, and likewise, in 1857 it is not likely he did either. “The horrorswrought by his iron hand,” Douglass wrote, “cannot be contemplated without ashudder, but it is the shudder which one feels at the execution of amurderer . . . necessity is the full justification of it to reason.”33[notes01.html#ch15fn_33a] His problem with the Old Man was strategic, notethical, although Douglass continually struggled to square killing with reason.Above all, Brown needed money. Throughout most of 1857, he traveled across theNorth, fashioning Kansas as a moral crusade and enlisting some of the mostprominent abolitionists in his effort. In March in Worcester, Massachusetts,Brown was a platform guest as Douglass gave a speech. But Brown’s fund-raisingefforts floundered as the economic panic of 1857 swept across the country.Staying with abolitionist allies, Brown wrote numerous letters in which heappealed to the New England antislavery conscience as well as for his destitutefamily and band of soldiers. He made many important connections withabolitionists who were convinced that the Kansas free-state cause demanded theirmoral and financial support. Gradually, Brown managed a tempestuous alliancewith a “secret six” group of activists including Samuel Gridley Howe, ThomasWentworth Higginson, Franklin Sanborn, Theodore Parker, Gerrit Smith, andespecially George Luther Stearns, a self-made magnate enriched by linseed oiland lead-pipe manufacturing, who, after his wife received Brown’s appeal,pledged thousands of dollars. All in their own ways were attracted to Brown as aromantic warrior-hero who would take the antislavery cause to the field ofbattle as none of them could.34 [notes01.html#ch15fn_34a]Like many of his fellow abolitionists, Douglass no longer had to imagine orinvent a John Brown; he showed up at Douglass’s doorstep, hat in hand, but alsoagain with maps, plans, and half-told tales. In the last week of January 1858,Brown arrived in Rochester and became a boarder with Douglass’s family at $3 perweek for three weeks. From this and other encounters, Douglass became as wellinformed of Brown’s ultimate aims as any abolitionist or accomplice outside ofhis small personal band. From upstairs at Douglass’s house, and in secrecy usingthe alias N. (Nelson) Hawkins, Brown carried on a near-daily correspondence withhis family and with potential supporters and donors. To Higginson, Gerrit Smith,Sanborn, and Stearns he wrote cryptically of his “Rail Road business of asomewhat extended scale” as he asked for money to accomplish his clandestinework. As the letters flowed in and out of the house, with thirteen-year-oldCharles Douglass as the carrier to and from the post office, Douglass learnedintimately of Brown’s “plan of running off slaves” by establishing safelocations in the mountains of Virginia. Such a scheme for “rendering slaveproperty in Maryland and Virginia valueless [and] insecure” intrigued Douglass,who recalled his own desperation for “any new mode of attack” on slavery.35[notes01.html#ch15fn_35a]Also while staying with the Douglasses, and eating at Anna’s table, Browndrafted his “Provisional Constitution,” which he intended to put in place as aninterim government in Virginia if his invasion succeeded. Just how much Brownand Douglass debated political philosophy and constitutionalism is unknown, butDouglass kept a personal copy of the constitution with its forty-eight articles,which together provided a bold, if redundant, blueprint first for revolution andthen for order to control anarchy and chaos in wartime. Above all, Douglasssurely agreed wholeheartedly with Brown’s preamble, much of which could havebeen lifted from editorials and speeches written by the host. The provisionalgovernment would be established in the name of the “proscribed, oppressed, andenslaved citizens . . . of the United States.” Slavery, proclaimed thedocument’s first line, “is none other than a most barbarous, unprovoked, andunjustifiable war of one portion of its citizens upon another portion—the onlyconditions of which are perpetual imprisonment and hopeless servitude orabsolute extermination.” Brown wrote the document to present to a convention inChatham, Canada, that he would convene in May 1858 as a means of recruitingamong the substantial free-black and fugitive community in that region ofwestern Ontario. That convention did eventually attract thirty-four black andtwelve white delegates, but the only noted black abolitionist was Martin Delany,then living in Canada; the whites were primarily members of Brown’s Kansas bandof soldiers. Notably, neither Douglass nor any of the New England backers ofBrown’s crusade attended.36 [notes01.html#ch15fn_36a]Image [../images/f0297-01.jpg]John Brown, c. 1857. Cameo portrait.Philosophizing about the nature of slavery and how it poisoned Americaninstitutions was one thing; fomenting an abolitionist revolution and creating agovernment in the midst of a slave state were quite another. Douglass describedBrown as obsessed with his constitution during the winter days in Rochester. “Itwas the first thing in the morning, and the last thing at night,” Douglassrecalled, “till I confess it began to be something of a bore to me.” Thisremarkable comment reflected Douglass’s response to the bizarre character of theconstitution, and an admission that Brown’s personality, as well as hiscombination of zeal and lack of clarity, could wear down a busy, discerningperson such as Douglass. The autobiographer remembered the Old Man mentioningthe possibility of attacking the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry to seizeweapons. Douglass soon realized the gravity of such a turn in the warrior’svision. Brown asked Douglass to put out two planed boards, on which Browndiagrammed “forts” and “secret passages” in the mountains where he would stagehis revolution. Douglass began to listen with caution. He admitted that he wasless interested in the drawings and board gaming than his children were. Browneven used a set of blocks to illustrate his plans to the assembled children, whosurely never forgot those wintry evenings. What Anna Douglass thought of thisaustere man with the long white beard whom she was feeding each day is notknown. On February 4 he wrote to his eldest son that Douglass had promised him$50, but “what I value vastly more he seems to appreciate my theories & mylabors.”37 [notes01.html#ch15fn_37a]Perhaps, but Douglass’s wry remembrances of those “theories,” as well as hisactions, remind us of the most basic fact in this union of awkward allies. Aslong as Brown bravely advanced the idea of funneling fugitive slaves out of theupper South and thereby politically threatened the slave system generally,Douglass was on board despite the risks. But when assaulting a large US arsenalemerged in the scheme, the writer parted ways with the warrior.Douglass also performed as a conduit, even a kind of banker, for Brown withother black leaders; they sent modest drafts of money to Rochester for theeditor to pass on to the revolutionary. In mid-March in Philadelphia, Brown andJohn Jr. met with Douglass, Henry Highland Garnet, and the famed UndergroundRailroad activist William Still. They gathered at the home of Stephen Smith, asuccessful black lumber dealer and protector of runaway slaves in that city.What Brown or Douglass might have divulged about invasion or insurrectionaryplans is not known; these and other meetings like them were essentially to primethe pump of a constant fund-raising campaign. But through most of 1857–58Brown’s clandestine enterprise was broke. He established a training base inTabor, Iowa, for his diminishing band of men. He then squandered an exorbitantamount of money hiring a soldier of fortune, Hugh Forbes, an English fencingteacher Brown had met in New York City who had fought in the Italian Revolutionwith Giuseppe Garibaldi and promised to write a training manual and serve as thedrill instructor. Unfortunately, Forbes was a scoundrel who sought to enrichhimself off New England humanitarians as he betrayed the invasion plan to highAmerican officials when he did not receive his promised compensation.38[notes01.html#ch15fn_38a]In late March 1858, Brown paid a ten-day visit to his home, his wife, Mary, andtheir small children in North Elba, New York. This may have been a kind ofleave-taking since he planned to launch the Virginia adventure later that springor early summer. Surely Brown sought emotional solace in what was left of hisdevastated family. Six of Brown’s sons and one son-in-law had fought in Kansas.By that spring, one was dead, two badly wounded, and two others had undergoneimprisonment, torture, and severe mental breakdowns. In letters Brown wrote fromhis retreat at Douglass’s home in February, he had counseled Mary and thefamily, “Courage, courage, courage!—the great work of my life (the unseen Handthat ‘guided me, and who has indeed holden my right hand, may hold itstill’) . . . I may yet see accomplished.”39 [notes01.html#ch15fn_39a] Kansasand ultimately Harpers Ferry were a gruesome disaster that Brown brought uponhis own family; in the face of such poverty and loss, he, not to mention hiswife and surviving children, needed a profound faith in that helping hand.On April 4 Brown once again arrived in Rochester, where he spent a night withDouglass. Accompanied by the former fugitive slave Jermain Loguen, and stillpreparing and recruiting for his convention in Chatham the next month, he thentraveled to St. Catherines, Canada, to visit and try to enlist Harriet Tubman inhis cause. The legendary Tubman, with her years of experience rescuing slaves inMaryland, Virginia, and Delaware, now lived in St. Catherines. Although sheencouraged and advised Brown and left the Old Man in awe, she never made anypromises to join him. If he could muster enough men, money, and guns, Brown hadplanned to launch his raid in 1858 soon after the Chatham gathering. But theknave Hugh Forbes, claiming lack of payment, informed three US senators, as wellas the editor of the New York Tribune, Horace Greeley, of the operation. Theentire scheme was therefore postponed for at least a year. Although Douglass metwith and paid the hotel bill for Forbes when he visited Rochester seekingpersonal funds in late 1857, the editor exaggerated his own role in exposing theEnglishman’s betrayals to Brown (claiming to have first broken the news).Douglass had embarrassing tracks to cover on this count; through his friendOttilie Assing he had introduced Forbes to a series of New York acquaintances aspotential donors, all of which only added to the danger of blown secrecy.40[notes01.html#ch15fn_40a]The “Forbes postponement,” as participants and scholars came to call it, forcedBrown to return to Kansas and lie relatively low until 1859. Thefifty-eight-year-old with the flowing white Moses-like beard fell ill for weekswith malarial fevers. He chose yet another new alias, Shubel Morgan, the firstname meaning “captive of God.” Hatred and violence over the slavery questionstill roiled in Kansas. In December 1858, a slave named Jim Daniels crossed overfrom Missouri, found Brown, and summoned his assistance in protecting him andhis young family from their owner, who intended to sell them away southward.Physically recovered, Brown strapped on his guns and led eighteen guerrillasinto Missouri; they liberated Daniels’s family as well as one other group ofslaves from two farms, resulting in the death of one slaveholder, and spiritedthe eleven rescued people back into Kansas. Here finally—Brown had liberatedslaves from under the noses of their owners.41 [notes01.html#ch15fn_41a] Thenwhat ensued was possibly the most heroic and admirable feat of Brown’s troubledcareer.After hiding in makeshift quarters and among antislavery settlers in Kansas fora month, Brown led an epic eighty-two-day, thousand-mile midwinter trek, on footand horseback, as well as with an oxen-driven wagon, across Nebraska, Iowa,Illinois, and Michigan. With the aid especially of abolitionist activists inGrinnell, Iowa, Brown and his liberated entourage eventually rode in a specialboxcar by train to Chicago and on to Detroit. On a blustery March 12, 1859,Brown bid a tearful farewell to the now twelve liberated blacks as they werespirited to freedom across the Detroit River at Windsor, Ontario. Back inKansas, Jim Daniels’s wife had given birth to a baby boy christened John BrownDaniels. When Brown’s daughter Ruth asked him later about his feelings duringthat scene on the Detroit River, her father merely answered with Scripture:“Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word: Formine eyes have seen thy salvation.”42 [notes01.html#ch15fn_42a]That night in Detroit, Brown returned to earthly matters as he met withDouglass, who was on an extended western speaking tour. Brown had written aheadwhen he heard of Douglass’s presence and urged him to wait for a rendezvous.Douglass heard Brown’s latest plans among a group of black Detroiters, led byGeorge DeBaptiste, the militant leader of that city’s Colored VigilanceCommittee, which worked to direct fugitive slaves into Canada. Despite thesuccess of the Missouri rescue, Douglass had gone cold on Brown’s scheme,especially if it included Harpers Ferry. The Old Man’s heroic image was nowthoroughly compelling; he was the revolutionary that abolitionists such asDouglass had yearned for. Or was he? That winter, during the rescue journey,Douglass’s daughter Rosetta wrote to her father demonstrating how the warriorhad become an intimate part of their family lore: “Old Brown will have to keepout of sight for a while. The governor of Missouri has a reward of $3000 offeredfor his capture.” In Brown’s travels eastward in mid-April for more moneyraising, he stopped by Douglass’s printing office for an afternoon to make yetanother appeal to the most famous black activist. Brown believed, dubiously,that Douglass’s presence would attract other courageous blacks to the cause ofviolent action. Douglass provided a serious conversation, but no promises. Hereported in his paper, though, very publicly, that “a hero . . . ‘Old Brown’ ofKansas memory” had just visited Rochester and made an appearance to speak atCity Hall. His host was angry at local Republicans for their disappointing orcowardly turnout.43 [notes01.html#ch15fn_43a]• • •Later that summer Brown rented a farmhouse (the Kennedy farm) in westernMaryland, a mere five miles north of Harpers Ferry, as his secret staging basefor the attack on the federal arsenal across the Virginia border. Douglass wascertainly informed of the location and now of its purpose. He and Brown kept upa correspondence through that fateful summer, and on August 10 Douglass met withJohn Brown Jr. in Rochester. Soon after that encounter, the editor answered theOld Man’s summons to come meet him in a stone quarry near Chambersburg,Pennsylvania, just across from the Maryland line.44 [notes01.html#ch15fn_44a]Douglass recorded a detailed recollection of this fateful final meeting betweenthe two men. In autobiographical time Douglass could control the narrative; butin real time on August 19–20, when he met the revolutionary, who was disguisedas a fisherman and camped among bleak large stones, an agonized emotionaltension enveloped their friendship.Douglass brought a $20 contribution given him on a stop in New York City by ablack couple, the Reverend James Glocester and his wife, as well as onesignificant recruit, a fugitive slave named Shields Green, who had escaped fromslavery in Charleston, South Carolina. Green was a man of few words but steelnerves and had met Brown on one of his visits to Douglass in Rochester. AsDouglass arrived in Chambersburg, a town with a sizable free-black population,he was immediately recognized and asked to deliver a speech. Not wishing to blowhis cover, he responded as asked in a local black church. Then for two daysBrown and Douglass, along with John Kagi, one of Brown’s most trustedaides-de-camp (with Green present as well), debated the Harpers Ferry scheme.Douglass did not exaggerate when he remembered feeling that he “was on adangerous mission.” Indeed, at the confluence of the Potomac and ShenandoahRivers, and only sixty-five miles from Washington, DC, the federal arsenal atHarpers Ferry housed the largest stash of munitions in the United States. Brownbegged Douglass to join him for the raid, as Douglass listened but resisted andthen vehemently strove to dissuade the Old Man from the attack. Brown lookedbedraggled, “storm-beaten . . . his clothing . . . about the color of the stonequarry itself.” But the final realization of his imminent invasion of Virginiaput fire in the Old Man’s eyes. Possibly Douglass still did not know fully ofthe intent to attack the arsenal until he arrived in Chambersburg, although hehad heard it “hinted” at several times before.45 [notes01.html#ch15fn_45a]That Douglass made such an extremely risky trip to southern Pennsylvania at thislate date may indicate that he knew a great deal, but perhaps not quite enough.It also reflected a kind of desperate loyalty he had always demonstrated towardBrown—showing up with money and a recruit, the two things the warrior had alwayssought. Still gravely in search of that logic of violence that he could embracein the mind, not merely the heart, Douglass stepped away from Brown’s bleak,death-defying heroism. The writer-orator looked reality in the face and said aresounding no. At age forty-one, Douglass was not prepared to die in suchfutility.Douglass told Brown that the raid would prove fatal to all earlier plans forrunning off slaves and the creation in the mountains of a militarizedUnderground Railroad, the one aspect of Brown’s schemes that attracted Douglass.Brown threw his arms around Douglass at their campfire and begged him to lendhis life and reputation to the cause. “Come with me, Douglass,” Brown pled, “Iwill defend you with my life. I want you for a special purpose. When I strikethe bees will begin to swarm, and I shall want you to help hive them.” But theformer slave knew far too much about the instinctive suspicions of slaves towardtheir would-be liberators as well as about the bloodshed surely to follow anyslave insurrection. Above all, Douglass looked Brown in the eye and told himthat, despite his apparent aim of “rousing the nation,” he was attacking thefederal government, which would marshal all its military might against him. Hewas “going into a perfect steel trap,” Douglass told Brown in no uncertainterms, and warned that “Virginia would blow him and his hostages sky-high,rather than that he should hold Harpers Ferry an hour.” The conversationdeteriorated into a grim, if noble, despair. Douglass knew he had encountered atragedy he could not stop. He let Shields Green make his own choice, and theyoung man’s response was simple: “I b’leve I’ll go wid de ole man.” Green wouldbe captured at Harpers Ferry along with Brown and hanged on December 16, twoweeks after the Old Man; his body was given for dissection to a Virginia medicalschool.46 [notes01.html#ch15fn_46a]Autobiography allows for an ordering of time and motives. In the clear-mindedmoment of August 20, 1859, Douglass made one of the great rational decisions ofhis life. Soon, though, the man who had expended so much rhetoric advocatingviolence in the 1850s would have to explain himself as an exile in a doubtingworld.• • •In the first nine months of 1859, before Harpers Ferry changed everything,Douglass had hardly sat on his hands waiting for Brown to strike his blows. FromFebruary 1 to March 12, Douglass launched one of his exhausting lecture toursacross the Midwest in the states of Illinois, Wisconsin, and Michigan. Hedelivered some fifty speeches in six weeks. Douglass encountered no mobs andonly a little hostility (he was viciously Jim-Crowed in a hotel in Janesville,Wisconsin). He found the tour debilitating but “soul-cheering”; as a black voicehe served as an “excellent thermometer” of the political climate. The slaveryquestion seemed uppermost in everyone’s mind among his huge audiences thatspring. In the heartland where the Republican Party found its deepestallegiances, Douglass kept up steady criticism of the party’s moderate policies,especially its tendency to support “exclusion” laws to deny settlement by blacksin western territories. He attacked Republicans’ Free-Soilism as never enough,calling it “an inconsistent, vacillating, crooked and compromising advocacy of agood cause.” During his absence from the Douglass’ Monthly (the name was newlychanged), he gave over the editor’s chair to McCune Smith, who dazzled thepaper’s readers with essays on black education, self-reliance, suffrage, andpolitics. The orator might have also given himself over to full-time lecturingfor a while as a fund-raiser; he repeatedly appealed to his subscribers to payup and keep his paper afloat.47 [notes01.html#ch15fn_47a]While John Brown plotted, Douglass kept up a steady and fierce debate withfellow black leaders such as Henry Highland Garnet over emigration schemes.Douglass respected Garnet and the right to emigrate, but attacked the idea ofwillful African American removal from the United States. Douglass loathed thenotion that some of the best black leaders would abandon the American ship atthis pivotal hour in history. Garnet’s mission was to extend “civilization andChristianity” to the heathen of Africa, and to end slave trading, but Douglass,who referred to West African rulers who sold slaves as “savage,” angrilyinsisted that American slaves must be freed first.48 [notes01.html#ch15fn_48a]In January 1859 Garnet and Douglass exchanged honest missives, disagreeingvehemently. Garnet accused his “dear brother” of enjoying the “comforts of theeditorial chair” rather than venturing to Africa to make a new civilization fortheir people. Garnet even accused the editor of a “toil-fearing spirit.”Douglass reacted with grace but firmly condemned once again all forms ofcolonization as false prophecy and a historical dead end. Although he sometimesexpressed modest interest in possible migrations to Haiti, to Douglass, removal,even in the wake of Dred Scott, only fueled the idea that black people couldnever be equal in America. The best way to defeat racism, said the editor, wasto stop “with wandering eyes and open mouths, looking out for some mightyrevolution in our affairs here, which is to remove us from this country.”Douglass and Garnet wanted different revolutions. “You go there, we stay here,is just the difference between us,” Douglass told the minister.49[notes01.html#ch15fn_49a]Douglass sustained as well his radical critique of Republicans, demanding thatabolitionists “return to your principles” and reject appeals on “behalf of freewhite labor.” Energized by the public lectern, throughout 1859 Douglass kept uphis drumbeat against racial segregation and about uses of force. With specialurgency, by summer he blasted the limits of Republican “non-extension,” callingthe slave system “a fiery dragon” sweeping across the South. “While the monsterlives,” Douglass characteristically declared, “he will hunger and thirst,breathe and expand. The true way is to put the knife into its quiveringheart.”50 [notes01.html#ch15fn_50a] Rhetorically, Douglass had long been readyfor violence.Among the final editorials Douglass wrote before Harpers Ferry was one entitled“The Ballot and the Bullet.” The piece is a measure of Douglass’s frustrationsas well as his passions. Reacting ostensibly to a Garrisonian challenge thatabolitionists should employ only the “sword of the spirit” and abandon allappeals to the ballot or the bullet, Douglass reflexively declared such a debate“nonsense.” “Hearts and consciences” were crucial, he admitted, but “truth to beefficient must be uttered in action as well as in speech.” If speech could endslavery, Douglass said, it “would have been done long ago.” He demanded an“anti-slavery Government,” but the political system seemed to offer only“can’t,” and he was “sick of it.” Hence, the “ballot is needed, and if this willnot be heard and heeded, then the bullet.” “Law” was necessary, but so was“physical force.”51 [notes01.html#ch15fn_51a] As an exclamation point on thebankruptcy of moral suasion, Douglass also unwittingly exhibited that anexpectation, even a justification, for violence could leave a gaping, unbearablechasm between words and actions.• • •When news broke about the raid on Harpers Ferry on October 17–18, Douglass wasin Philadelphia, where he gave a speech at National Hall. Late on the night ofOctober 16, Brown and his eighteen men had seized the arsenal. Within thirty-sixhours the raid was over; ten of Brown’s men were killed in the raid, somecaptured, including the badly wounded Brown himself. While five escaped, threeof whom would die fighting in the Civil War, the captives were hanged in thecoming months by the state of Virginia. Three slaves temporarily liberated byBrown’s band died in the raid or its aftermath. Five town residents or workers,including the Harpers Ferry mayor, were killed, and nine militiamen or USmarines were wounded in the day of street battles. The raid was a strategicdisaster, yet with time emerged as the most catalytic and successful symbolicevent in the history of the antislavery cause. Newspapers screamed with shockingand confused headlines such as the litany on the cover of the New York Heraldfor October 18: “Fearful and Exciting Intelligence”; “Extensive NegroConspiracy”; “Seizure of United States Arsenal by the Insurrectionists.” Withina day of Brown’s capture and arrest Douglass’s name appeared in newspapersacross the country as one of the conspirators identified in a large collectionof papers confiscated from a trunk left at the Kennedy farm in Maryland. Wildrumors mixed with some facts as many newspapers gave over their entire sheetsfor days to telegraphic reports about Harpers Ferry. By October 29 FrankLeslie’s Illustrated Newspaper began its extraordinary pictorial coverage ofBrown, the raid, the trials, and the executions, giving the country a feast ofimages well into 1860. There had never been an event like this in Americanhistory; Douglass recalled it as news with “the startling effect of anearthquake . . . something to make the boldest hold his breath.”52[notes01.html#ch15fn_52a]Douglass quickly realized he was in dire trouble. He delivered his Philadelphialecture in which he openly referred to Brown’s raid approvingly. But soonafterward he was informed by friends that John Hurn, the city’s sympatheticantislavery telegraph operator, had received a dispatch from governmentauthorities to the local sheriff ordering that Douglass be arrested and detainedas a conspirator. Hurn delayed its delivery for three hours as long as friends“agreed to get Mr. Douglass out of the state.” (Hurn became a prominentphotographer, and Douglass sat no fewer than eight times for him in the 1860sand 1870s, a measure of the bond the two men developed.53[notes01.html#ch15fn_53a])Douglass swiftly departed from the Walnut Street wharf over to Camden, NewJersey, a route he remembered well from his escape to freedom in 1838. Now hewas a fugitive again of another kind. Hurrying northward, he took the train toNew York, and late on the night of October 19 he caught the ferry to Hoboken, tothe home of Mrs. Marks, where Ottilie Assing lived as a boarder. There Douglassspent the night as he made a risky decision to use the railroads to continue hisflight home to Rochester. Worried about “sundry letters and a constitutionwritten by John Brown” locked in his desk in Rochester, he dictated a telegramto Assing to be sent the next morning to Douglass’s eldest son, Lewis. Addressedto the telegraph operator in Rochester, whom the editor knew well, it read, “B.F. Blackall, Esq: Tell Lewis (my oldest son) to secure all the important papersin my high desk.” To keep secrecy, he did not sign his name. In the Life andTimes reminiscence, Douglass observed that in the 1880s the “mark of the chisel”still remained on the old desk, where Lewis had pried it open, one of the family“traces of the John Brown raid.” Both John Hurn and Assing eventually stakedclaims to having saved Douglass’s life.54 [notes01.html#ch15fn_54a]On October 20, Assing and another neighbor took Douglass in the dark of night ina private carriage to Paterson, New Jersey, so that he could take the ErieRailroad to Rochester, not the train he might normally be expected to occupy. Hearrived safely, but immediately was informed by his neighbor Samuel Porter thatthe New York lieutenant governor was prepared to arrest Douglass if GovernorHenry Wise of Virginia, now in charge of the investigation, issued such anorder. Indeed, Wise was especially determined to capture Douglass, whoeventually reprinted the Virginia governor’s remarkable letter to PresidentJames Buchanan, requesting his assistance in finding and apprehending “theperson of Frederick Douglass, a negro man . . . charged with murder, robbery,and inciting servile insurrection.” In emotional desperation, with hardly timefor a serious reckoning with Anna and his children, Douglass packed a bag, andby what was likely October 22, Amy and Isaac Post drove him to the docks and aferry across Lake Ontario into Canada. It was widely reported that Douglassescaped from Rochester a mere six hours before federal marshals arrived at hishome seeking his arrest.55 [notes01.html#ch15fn_55a]Anna’s despair and his children’s fears can only be imagined. They had by thenlost count of the times when they felt abandoned by their beloved husband andfather; but this time it may have felt as if their world had ended. Thecountless earlier appeals for the blood of slaveholders had found an astoundingresult fraught with horrible uncertainty.In Canada, Douglass first stayed in a tavern in Clifton, which is today NiagaraFalls. He was due west of Rochester, although soon it became clear that he couldnot go home anytime soon. Not only was Henry Wise searching for him, but he soonlearned of severe criticism from one of Brown’s captured men, John Cook, as wellas from some black leaders claiming that the abolitionist had promised to jointhe raid and betrayed the cause. Douglass may have let the sound and awe of thefalls soothe his psyche; he certainly did not fall on his sword with guilt andaffliction, although the accusations put him painfully on the defensive. OnOctober 27 he wrote to Amy Post in Rochester implying that he would return tothe New York side of the border soon, admitting however that it “will take manymonths to blow this heavy cloud from my sky.” He hated his current exile andworried about the possible confiscation of his property if his indictment held.But he whistled with false confidence: “It cannot be lost unless I am convicted.I cannot be convicted if I am not tried. . . . I cannot be arrested unlesscaught; I cannot be caught if I keep out of the way—and just this thing it is mypurpose to do.”56 [notes01.html#ch15fn_56a]On October 31 Douglass responded the only way he could—with his pen in a publicletter to a Rochester newspaper that was in turn reprinted all over the country.To Cook’s jailhouse accusation of “cowardice” against him, Douglass first blamedthe hothouse of “terror-stricken slaveholders” surrounding the sensationalsituation in Virginia. Then, with a degree of comic irony he may have regretted,he answered the personal charge: “I have not one word to say in defense orvindication of my character for courage. I have always been more distinguishedfor running than fighting—and tried by the Harpers Ferry insurrection test, I ammost miserably deficient in courage.” Soon he would have to endure anextraordinary cartoon that appeared in Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper,depicting Douglass leaping through the air in sheer fright with a trunk on hisshoulder, his shoes and hat flying off. To his side is the small signpost TOCANADA; the title reads, “The Way in Which Fred. Douglass Fights Wise ofVirginia,” and the caption below, “I have always been more distinguished forrunning than fighting.”57 [notes01.html#ch15fn_57a]Image [../images/f0308-01.jpg]“The Way in Which Frederick Douglass Fights Wise of Virginia,” Frank Leslie’sIllustrated Newspaper, November 12, 1859.Douglass unequivocally denied ever promising to join Brown’s band at HarpersFerry. Whether from wisdom or cowardice, Douglass said, his “field of labor forthe abolition of slavery has not extended to an attack upon the United Statesarsenal.” He did not fear being “made an accomplice in the general conspiracyagainst slavery.” Then he succinctly stated his long-term dilemma with violence:“I am ever ready to write, speak, publish, organize, combine, and even toconspire against slavery, when there is a reasonable hope for success.” Such hadbeen the gaping hole in his quest for the logic of violence, as in the earlierChambersburg moment of truth. As to why he had not joined Brown in Virginia,Douglass gave an honest answer: “The tools to those that can use them.”58[notes01.html#ch15fn_58a] There was a time for every purpose—for the war makers,and for the war propagandists. Douglass knew his tools.Also while sitting in Clifton, Canada, and reading wire dispatches andnewspapers, Douglass followed Brown’s celebrated trial in Charles Town,Virginia, which began on October 25. He penned an extraordinary column for hispaper, “Capt. John Brown Not Insane,” which was not only a vintage, sharp-edgedpiece of abolitionism, but also Douglass’s earliest effort to help build themajestic cross of John Brown’s martyrdom. To allow a charge of insanity forBrown soiled “this glorious martyr of liberty.” Had Americans “forgotten theirown heroic age?” Douglass wondered, as he quickly marched Brown into line nextto the “heroes of Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill.” Brown was already“Gideon” of “self-forgetful heroism.” All the bad strategy and exasperatinglymysterious plans evaporated in the preparation for the gallows. John Brown hadnever made it easy to love him, until he found what one scholar has called his“creative vocation” of seeking martyrdom.59 [notes01.html#ch15fn_59a]Within two weeks of his capture, the bearded prophetlike hero had suddenlyoffered the nation a new history. Douglass was already writing a first chapter,almost a prose equivalent of the song “John Brown’s Body.” “This age is toogross and sensual to appreciate his deeds, and so calls him mad,” Douglasswrote, “but the future will write his epitaph upon the hearts of a people freedfrom slavery, because he struck the first effectual blow.” Douglass realized inmythic terms his logic of violence; Brown had used the “weapons preciselyadapted” to destroy slavery. As poems, songs, and editorials flowed forth inAmerican and European journals, Douglass made his own mark. “Like Samson,” saida lonely Douglass in Canada, Brown “has laid his hands upon the pillars of thisgreat national temple of cruelty and blood, and when he falls, the temple willspeedily crumble to its final doom.” Brown would have loved the metaphor sinceSamson was one of his own oft-repeated self-comparisons. “I expect to effect amighty conquest,” Brown had written with customary grandiosity in 1858, “eventhough it will be like the last victory of Samson.”60 [notes01.html#ch15fn_60a]Douglass and Brown could both claim old biblical stories that each man hadexpected their America to reenact.In the second week of November, Douglass passed through Toronto, took a steameracross Lake Ontario and down the Saint Lawrence River to Quebec, where on thetwelfth he departed on the ship Nova Scotia for Liverpool. He feared, as heremembered many years later, that he “was going into exile, perhaps for life.”On the bitterly cold decks of a ship in the North Atlantic, Douglass felt deeplytroubled. In two sittings aboard the ship on its ten-day voyage to Liverpool,the lonely exile crafted a long letter. He amused himself and settled his nerveswith comments on the Frenchness of Montreal, the majesties of the ocean, and thesturdiness of the steamer. “My head is hardly less confused than the waves,” headmitted, “and my hand not more steady than the ship.”61[notes01.html#ch15fn_61a] As John Brown eagerly charted his plan to die from hisjail cell in Virginia, Douglass now had to plot a plan to live."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 16--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SECESSION: TAUGHT BY EVENTSI am for a dissolution of the Union—decidedly for a dissolution of the Union!Under an abolition President, who would wield the army and the navy of theGovernment for the abolition of slavery, I should be for the Union of theseStates.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, BOSTON, DECEMBER 1860Among the most driving compulsions of Frederick Douglass’s public life was hisquest to alter, shape, or change history. He craved those moments andopportunities to gain access to real political power, to bend wills, and to be acreator of events and not merely their interpreter. Over and again he learnedthe limits and frustrations of such a quest. During the Civil War era Douglassspent great energy trying to discern and then affect what he frequently calledthe “stern logic of events.” In Life and Times, he reflected poignantly on howduring America’s final road to disunion in 1859–61, he had done all in his powerto convince his readers and listeners that the fate of the country depended onthe “liberation of the slave.” From the safety of retrospect, Douglass expresseda certain hard-won wisdom about the nature of history: “In every way possible,in the columns of my paper and on the platform, by letters to friends at homeand abroad, I did all that I could to impress this conviction upon the country.But nations seldom listen to advice from individuals, however reasonable. Theyare taught less by theories than by facts and events.”1 [notes01.html#ch16fn_1a]John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry, as well as the election of 1860 and thesecession crisis that flowed in its wake, were just such seismic breaks in timewhen people were taught by events. Douglass could only react to and flee fromthe John Brown revolutionary moment; with time, however, he had a great deal tosay about its political, moral, and religious meanings. Harpers Ferry became oneof the markers of his life’s story. Ten months before the raid, in January 1859,with palpable despair, Douglass had yearned for hope and a historical clarity hecould not find. “Would that this might prove the year of the jubilee to thosenow toiling millions!” he proclaimed in his paper. “Would that this were the dayof release. But no wavering shadow of this coming event falls upon our vision.We walk by faith, not by sight.” Bleakly, Douglass admitted that his well wasdry. “How long! How long! O Lord God of Sabbath! shall the crushed and bleedingbondsman wait. . . . O! who can answer—who can tell the end we long to know?”2[notes01.html#ch16fn_2a]But exactly a year later, Douglass was living in exile in Halifax, England, innorthwest Yorkshire, at the home of his old friend Julia Griffiths Crofts, andher husband, the Reverend Dr. Henry O. Crofts. On December 19, the New YorkTimes reported Douglass safely in England, where he defended John Brown and theraid. “John Brown has not failed,” said the new exile. “He has dropped an idea,equal to a thousand bombshells into the very Bastille of slavery. That idea willlive and grow, and one day will unless slavery is otherwise abolished, coverVirginia with sorrow and blood.” By then, Douglass must have read Brown’spre-gallows dark eloquence about a land “purged with blood.” By January 1860,the orator was once again back on the British antislavery speaking circuit,delivering tributes to Brown and historical lectures on the slavery issue inAmerica. At Bradford on January 6, an upbeat Douglass argued that Americanabolitionism had undergone “continual progress” since the first campaign ofJames Birney as the Liberty Party candidate for president in 1840; now someseventeen Northern states had become politically antislavery, and John Brown’sraid had enhanced the cause like nothing before.3 [notes01.html#ch16fn_3a]In his speeches during a six-month exile, he appropriated Brown’s raid to a newvariation of a prophetic tradition Douglass had long practiced. At Edinburgh,Scotland, on January 30, Douglass used Brown’s story to entertain as well asinstruct his audience, garnering “loud and prolonged cheering” with the argumentthat American slaveholders were the real “insurrectionists.” The huge QueenStreet Hall crowd thrilled to Douglass’s radical interpretation of HarpersFerry: “The 350,000 slaveholders, with the American Government so-called attheir back, were but an armed band of insurgents against the just rights andliberties of their fellow-men. John Brown merely stepped in to interrupt andarrest this insurrection against the rights and liberties of mankind; and he didright!” The next night in Glasgow at a reception in his honor in the City Hall,Douglass heard loud applause as he delivered a similar speech in which Isaiah’s“no peace to the wicked” formed his theme. He garnered laughs with his claimagainst any implication on his part in Brown’s raid as he also played withdouble meanings for “peace.” He was “thus for peace,” Douglass maintained, but“there could be no peace between one man standing on the neck of his brother andthe man who was under his heel.” The American announced that the “slave would befree, whether by peace or by war.” Douglass told his Glasgow comrades that Brownhad “succeeded much better . . . by failure than he would have . . . if he hadheld out till this time.” Martyrdom on the gallows gave the war propagandist anunbounded way to make the old story new.4 [notes01.html#ch16fn_4a]Just before leaving Canada Douglass had written a farewell message to “MyAmerican Readers and Friends.” He betrayed great anxiety and sadness in hisforced exile. “Neither the long experience of partings and meetings, nor thecalmness borrowed from philosophy,” eased his fears. But he took heart in makingthe most of “the stern old hero” awaiting execution and martyrdom. “TheChristian blood of Old John Brown,” he declared, “will not cease to cry from theground long after the clamors of alarm and consternation” from slaveholders hadceased. Douglass announced himself “glad to use the event at Harpers Ferry” toassault with yet new fervor the “benumbed conscience of the nation.” He may havefled for his life to a temporary asylum in England, but he now had a great newstory and adoring audiences that allowed him to walk by sight.5[notes01.html#ch16fn_5a] Having saved himself from death on a gallows in aVirginia field, a living Douglass had work to do.• • •Douglass’s exile had landed him among friends. In March 1859, Julia Griffithshad married Henry O. Crofts, a Methodist minister and missionary who had servedfrom 1839 to 1851 in Canada and whom she had met in 1857. They provided awelcome landing for the newly fugitive Frederick. When Douglass came ashore inLiverpool on November 24, he traveled immediately to Halifax where he “found myold friend Julia quite glad . . . to see me—and what was of equal importance,her husband too.” Douglass had earlier described the Reverend Crofts as an“excellent antislavery man” who had worked among fugitive slaves in Canada. Theyall had much in common, not least of which was still coping with the residue ofGarrisonian scandalmongering about Frederick and Julia. After Griffiths’s returnto England in 1855, the Garrisonians (namely Parker Pillsbury while touring) hadtried to monitor her activities, believing absurdly that Douglass had dispatchedJulia to raise money not only for his paper and his mortgage but to forge rivalabolition groups in Britain. Pillsbury wrote in 1856 that the two alleged lovershad “been mortgaged to each other and both to the devil.”6[notes01.html#ch16fn_6a] Garrisonian orthodoxy reached far beyond US borders.But no such rumors deterred Griffiths in the least from her new career oforganizing women’s antislavery societies in England and Scotland, nor fromwriting her extraordinary public letters to Douglass’s paper. By February 1859she reported that she had succeeded in organizing twenty new antislavery groupsamong her British sisters, and in reorganizing many older ones. Griffiths was abrilliant publicist and activist who, as a woman alone, crisscrossed England,Scotland, and Ireland raising consciousness and money for Douglass’s paper, aswell as for the Rochester ladies’ antislavery fairs and for supporting fugitiveslaves in New York State. She was the driving force behind the Edinburgh LadiesNew Anti-Slavery Association and reported memberships of thirty-one in Wakefieldand forty-one in her own town of Halifax. Such heroic efforts did not gounnoticed publicly by her friend; in April 1858 Douglass wrote to the Halifaxwomen, “I wish your society could have seen the twenty fugitives we have helpedon their way to Canada during the past week. . . . Every example leaves thesystem weaker.” Griffiths’s women even sent $10 for John Brown’s widow in late1859. As Douglass hit the circuit in England and Scotland, Julia stepped inseamlessly as his manager. Her friend’s presence had fostered a “highlysuccessful” fund-raising campaign, she reported in March 1860. Invitationspoured in from all over England and Scotland, and Julia served as agent. “It hasbeen a great pleasure to his friends,” she said, “to see him once again safe inOld England, and to welcome him to their . . . firesides.”7[notes01.html#ch16fn_7a]During his second British sojourn, and well beyond, Douglass had many otherrumors and accusations to face as well. The tales of his alleged betrayal ofpromises to Brown and his men refused to die, and a US Senate committee spentsix months engaged in a somewhat hapless investigation of the Harpers Ferryconspiracy. The stories about Douglass’s abandonment of Brown referred back toan unconfirmed rumor that at their Detroit meeting in March 1859, Brown hadaccused Douglass of cowardice to his face because of his refusal to enlist inthe Harpers Ferry scheme. But over time the complaints about Douglass’s roleemanated largely from Brown’s surviving children, Anne, Salmon, Ruth, and JohnJr. In the summer of 1859, some of Brown’s men, especially John Kagi, apparentlyfelt convinced Douglass would personally join them in Maryland. In June, Kagiwrote to Douglass to congratulate him on his decision to join and told theeditor that his name was magic in recruiting other black men. According toFranklin Sanborn, a group of Philadelphia blacks wrote a letter to Douglasspledging support for his family in Rochester should he not return from theinvasion of Virginia. Yet another unsubstantiated rumor had it that Douglass hadescorted Shields Green to Chambersburg to join Brown’s band as his own “paidsubstitute.” An interview conducted in 1909 by Katherine Mayo, Oswald GarrisonVillard’s research assistant on his biography of John Brown, turned up areminiscence from a Mrs. Russell, a Bostonian who had visited Brown in his jailcell before the execution. She claimed that Brown “had no fondness for FredDouglass” and stated that his “defeated plan . . . we owe to the famous Mr.Frederick Douglass!”8 [notes01.html#ch16fn_8a]Such claims were always much more ex post facto bitterness than reality. Someonehad to be blamed for the Old Hero’s folly, especially after he walked sogracefully to the hangman’s noose to die for the nation’s sins. It is a ratherpointless speculation to suggest, as one scholar has done, that Douglass’sopposition was “detrimental” to the raid. Brown himself seemed fully aware thathis own faulty strategy and indecision had led to defeat. In famous letters fromjail while awaiting the gallows, he wrote to his brother Jeremiah: “I am worthinconceivably more to hang than for any other purpose.” And to his wife, Mary,Brown offered this agonizing self-epitaph: “I have been whipped as the sayingis; but am sure I can recover all the lost capital occasioned by that disaster;by only hanging a few moments by the neck; & feel quite determined to make theutmost possible out of a defeat.” With a culture of martyrdom emerging around“John Brown’s Body,” blaming Douglass for the defeat at Harpers Ferry seemsstrange in retrospect.9 [notes01.html#ch16fn_9a] This Jesus and his gloriouscross needed no Judas, and soon his cause grew vaster than even the Old Manmight have imagined.From England, Douglass monitored the investigation conducted in the Senate by acommittee chaired by James Mason of Virginia. The Mason Committee met withregularity from December 16, 1859, to June 14, 1860. Consisting of SenatorsMason, Jefferson Davis of Mississippi, and G. N. Fitch of Indiana for themajority Democrats, and Senators Jacob Collamer of Vermont and James R.Doolittle of Wisconsin for the Republican minority, the hearings, with Davisserving as chief inquisitor, interrogated many witnesses to ascertain whetherany “subversive organizations” had been involved in Brown’s exploits. But duringthis volatile election year, the Mason Committee turned into more of a politicalexercise, with the Democrats seeking to identify and blame Republicancongressmen as culprits and with most Republicans striving to keep distancebetween themselves and Brown’s radicalism. The committee interviewed Republicanluminaries William H. Seward, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee,Henry Wilson and John Andrew of Massachusetts, and Representative JoshuaGiddings of Ohio. Correspondence from Giddings had been found in Brown’s trunksafter the raid. The hearings also included the questioning of two members of thegroup of Brown supporters known as the Secret Six, George Luther Stearns andSamuel Gridley Howe, but the Mason Committee seemed less interested in proving alegal conspiracy than in eventually putting the whole affair behind the nationbefore the election. Since Douglass was out of the country, the indictmentagainst him, as well as nearly all others, was abandoned. Only four arrestwarrants were issued, and those because they had refused to testify: John BrownJr., James Redpath, Franklin B. Sanborn, and Thaddeus Hyatt. Only Hyatt wasjailed—for three months in Washington, DC, before being released when thecommittee issued its reports.10 [notes01.html#ch16fn_10a]In the end the Mason Committee, despite Jefferson Davis’s personal ire forSeward, Giddings, and all abolitionists, chose not to delve into the reality ofBrown’s conspiracy. Its legal work seemed dictated more by the much-anticipatedDemocratic Party nominating convention to be held in Charleston, South Carolina,in April and the Republican convention in Chicago early that summer. The MasonCommittee’s majority report delivered special censure for all the New Englandfinancial and military support for Brown’s Kansas crusade, as well as forabolitionists’ belief in “higher law” doctrines. But it seemed convinced thatBrown’s invasion was the work of a relatively lone, deranged outlaw striving toincite “servile insurrection.” Hovering over the Mason Committee’s deliberationswas that Virginia had already created one martyr, the consequences of which hadproduced a toxic political environment, and it had no wish to create any more.11[notes01.html#ch16fn_11a]Too much was at stake politically for all concerned in 1860 for the committee toseek anything resembling the deeper truth. Douglass was one beneficiary of anincompetent congressional inquiry into America’s deepest dilemma; he never hadto face the future president of the Confederacy in a Senate hearing. It wouldnot be the last time Douglass found himself first trapped by and then offeredthe open opportunity to exploit his country’s refusal to face its past orpresent. Soon, he could return to the United States, relatively comfortableknowing that he did not face arrest or execution for the crime of conspiracy inwhich he now declared great pride.While in England, Douglass, as usual, buried his personal anxieties in traveland lecturing. He remained on the defensive about his flight to Canada andBritain, as well as his family’s fate. Douglass felt under scrutiny about hischoices, as he wrote to an old Irish friend, Maria Webb. He had to escape arrestand trial in Virginia. “I could never hope to get out of that state alive,” hetold Webb. “If they did not kill me for being concerned with Dear old Brown theywould have done so—for my being Frederick Douglass.”12 [notes01.html#ch16fn_12a]Being Frederick Douglass is what he did in England to overflow crowds and withthe stirrings of controversy.Douglass appealed to the religious and national pride of his Scottish audiences.“The Christianity of Scotland,” he said, “had no sanction for chains orslavery,” whereas in the American South “the clank of the fetter might be heardalong with the chime of the bell that called to prayer. Men might be seen goingto prayer on one side of the street, and chain gangs on the other side.” InScotland he sang the old songs about Christian hypocrisy with new urgency. InGlasgow in February 1860, Douglass delivered a remarkable historical lecture onhow America had descended from two distinct societies, one born among theBible-inspired believers in the Magna Carta aboard the Mayflower in 1620, andthe other aboard a “Dutch galley” slave ship landing in Virginia in 1619. Onesociety led to “light” and the other “darkness”; the first brought “Christ” andthe other “Belial,” or the Old Testament conception for evil and Satan. Thisdichotomous simplicity gave way to a narrative of how the country had collapsedinto the “most trying crisis in her history,” bounded by the enactments of theFugitive Slave Act and the Dred Scott decision, which Douglass called the “moralassassination” of his “whole race.”13 [notes01.html#ch16fn_13a]At the same time, in Glasgow, Newcastle, and other cities, Douglass got into anasty scrap with British Garrisonians, especially the famed George Thompson,over disunionism and the antislavery interpretation of the Constitution.Douglass plied old waters, but he seemed eager for another go at his oldnemeses. Thompson responded with public rebuttals and specially publishedaddresses denouncing Douglass’s views and his harsh style. The GlasgowEmancipation Society reported that an April 3 address in the City Hall byThompson had been a “refutation . . . lucid and triumphant” against “the chargesthat F. Douglass had brought against the lecturer.”14 [notes01.html#ch16fn_14a]But Douglass loved these public squabbles, and his well of resentments andsupply of sarcasm against Garrisonians seemed bottomless. He even made avigorous case for the potential antislavery power of the Republican Party inAmerica, appropriating it to his natural-rights conception of the Constitution.Although he gladly engaged in a personalized fight with Thompson over theirrespective readings of the Constitution, Douglass believed the time had passedfor arcane argument. His Scottish audiences liked a vaguer kind of eloquence.“Slavery is essentially a dark system,” he declared in Glasgow in March 1860;“all it wants is to be excluded and shut out from the light. If it can only beboxed in where there is not a single breath to fall upon it. . . . It dreads theinfluence of truth.”15 [notes01.html#ch16fn_15a] By his own circuitous route,Douglass may have landed on the central truth of why the Republican Party posedsuch a threat to Southern slavery. Such a political force could use parts of theConstitution, should it gain power, to bring slavery to an ultimate destruction.Douglass also faced new issues in England as he found traction with olderarguments. His own large audiences and Griffiths’s extraordinary labors torevive antislavery societies notwithstanding, the British abolition movementappeared in decline. Many in the British public had soured on the question ofWest Indian emancipation, arguing that it had failed and that Africans and theirdescendants were proving incapable of free labor. Worse, increasingly Americanforms of racism that Douglass had not seen in 1846–47 appeared now on Britishstreets, in theaters, and even in social discourse. A new roiling of racism inBritain disturbed him immensely. In his speech “British Racial Attitudes” inNewcastle, Douglass reminisced about encountering “not the slightest ill feelingtoward me because of my complexion” in 1846. But now, “American prejudice mightbe found in the streets of Liverpool and in nearly all our commercial towns.” Heespecially blamed “that pestiferous nuisance, Ethiopian minstrels,” who “broughthere the slang phrases, the contemptuous sneers all originating in the spirit ofslavery.” He made it clear that he hated seeing “the negro represented in allmanner of extravagances, contented and happy as a slave.” Groups of touringminstrels were indeed common in England by 1860, entertaining large audienceswith exaggerated dialects and grotesque caricature. A Newcastle paper reportedthat Douglass experienced personal “hostility to his color” as never before, andthat in a speech he condemned both American ministers as well as the minstrelsalike for pouring “the leprous distilment of their proslavery poison into theears and hearts of the British people.”16 [notes01.html#ch16fn_16a] Britishabolition dearly needed a revival; for at least a brief time, Douglass gave ithis voice and energy.• • •In January 1860, while Douglass was in England, Ottilie Assing’s Germantranslation of My Bondage and My Freedom appeared. According to her biographer,Maria Diedrich, Assing sought to “invent a Douglass that was all hers.” Indeed,that was the case, although with only the slimmest evidence via a third-partysource, Diedrich maintains that Assing planned to join Douglass for a secretromantic holiday in France. Douglass did seek to travel to France by his ownaccount, but could not go because the American government denied him a passport.Douglass openly blamed the racism of the Democratic Party’s minister to theCourt of St. James’s, George Dallas.17 [notes01.html#ch16fn_17a]Assing may have dreamed of joining Douglass on his new “European career,” asDiedrich suggests, but nothing from Douglass’s hand or voice ever indicated suchintentions. Assing’s designs on Douglass’s heart and career come to us entirelyby her own telling of the tale. All he later admitted to was a “long-cherisheddesire to visit France.” That he and Assing conducted an on-and-off intimate andimportant relationship seems certain from Assing’s letters. It appears thatDouglass had begun to study German at Assing’s behest. Assing was utterlyinfatuated with Douglass and saw him as a romantic hero as well as, according toDiedrich, the “legitimate heir” of John Brown to lead the antislaveryrevolution. Assing’s breathless hagiography of Brown and Douglass in the wake ofHarpers Ferry knew no bounds. Diedrich rightly declares that Assing “fearedneither contradiction nor inconsistency” in her writing. Her hopes andgrandiosity halted abruptly, however, as did Douglass’s second British sojourn,when news arrived in early spring while he was visiting Glasgow that hisdaughter Annie, just short of her eleventh birthday, had died in Rochester onMarch 13, 1860, of an extended illness.18 [notes01.html#ch16fn_18a]Image [../images/f0318-01.jpg]Ottilie Assing, c. 1871.A grief- and guilt-stricken Douglass made haste to sail home to the UnitedStates despite lingering concerns over his legal fate. He may have received thenews of Annie’s death from Rosetta, who was now an occasional correspondent withher father. Annie herself had written the faraway parent in December 1859,telling of her joys and successes in school, especially her “German lessons.” “Iam the first reader and I can read,” she told the exiled Douglass. Assing hadtaken a sincere interest in the education of Douglass’s daughters. Anna Douglasswas devastated by the loss of her namesake and final child of her marriage tothe peripatetic world citizen she had once known as the lonely and ambitious boyfrom the Baltimore docks. A letter from Rosetta to Douglass’s adopted sister,Harriet (Ruth Adams), opens a small window into Anna’s bleak but courageousbereavement. “I have just asked Mother what I should say for her,” said Rosettato Harriet. “She sends her love to you and thanks you as heartily as myself foryour sympathizing letter, and as she is unable to write will allow my letter tobe in answer for both. . . . She is not very well now being quite feeble thoughabout the house.” Then Anna asked her daughter to tell Anna’s sister-in-law to,politely, “if you desire,” write to her famous brother and tell him to come hometo Rochester. Along with her adult daughter and teenage sons, Anna would haveseen to the burial of Annie. How horribly conspicuous Douglass must have seemedto all of them by his absence. Thirty-five carriages rolled along Rochesterstreets and roads to Annie’s burial, according to a report in Douglass’ Monthly.The “disease was one of the brain” that had baffled the doctors. During thefuneral observances, wrote the observer, “frequent allusions were made to thefather of little Annie, so far away, who would be so sad to be present, and yetmore sad to be absent.”19 [notes01.html#ch16fn_19a]Douglass wrote few public words about his daughter’s death. He later calledAnnie “the light and life of my house.” As he rode the trains from Glasgow toHalifax, said good-bye to Julia and Henry Crofts, then hurried on to Liverpool,his lonely burden numbed him. The cheering had stopped; those huge and engagingaudiences in the ornate halls of Edinburgh and Glasgow were suddenly a worldaway from his personal reality. The helpless self-made man headed home to faceevents he could not control. In one of Rosetta’s letters to Harriet she told ofreceiving letters from her father (which do not survive) indicating that “hisgrief was great” and hoping for another message with “more composure of mind.”Douglass took a steamer to Portland, Maine, remaining inconspicuous as hereturned to Rochester via Canada. After a seventeen-day voyage he was home bylate April, where he would remain off the lecture circuit for nearly fourmonths, still wary of the Senate investigation and doing his best to help Annagrieve and to provide a father’s presence for Annie’s four siblings. Theyoungest son, Charles, reminiscing many years later, said this sequence ofevents left them all a “dismembered family.” “Thus at the age of 16,” he wrote,“I left my father’s house never to return again only as a visitor.”20[notes01.html#ch16fn_20a]They needed him; in a public letter to his “British Anti-Slavery Friends” of May26, 1860, Douglass told of his “sorrow-stricken family” and how his presencefelt “sacredly beneficial.” But then he all but politicized Annie’s death,thanking his English friends for their sympathy and suggesting that her demiseresulted “from overanxiety for the safety of her father, and deep sorrow for thedeath of dear old John Brown, upon whose knee she had often sat only a fewmonths before.” All of this tenderness of sentiment and memory presagedDouglass’s appeal about the never-ending problem of “receipts” and “expenses” ofhis newspaper. The Douglass’ Monthly was broke again, political antislaverydesperately needed his voice, and he enticed his British network with the newsthat ten more fugitive slaves had passed under his own roof in the mere month hehad resided back in Rochester.21 [notes01.html#ch16fn_21a] The public letter wasa common genre in this era, but rarely had Douglass or anyone else in hisabolitionist orbit mixed such private sorrow with fund-raising.• • •In July of 1860 Ottilie Assing came for a somewhat extended visit to Rochester,where among other activities she took an oath of allegiance to the United Statesand became an American citizen. According to her biographer she tried hardduring this time to persuade Douglass away from his religious faith and biblicalliterary voice, but to no avail. Assing often had exquisitely bad timing andjudgment. Whatever else they shared in affection and ideas, her atheism and hisChristian worldview and millennial sense of history clashed, ultimately fatally.Douglass had planned a return visit to Britain that September to resume hiseffort to revive British abolitionism, but called it off because of the Americanpresidential election campaign and his desire to affect it. “He who speaks now,”he wrote in the Monthly, “may have an audience. We wish . . . to strike whilethe iron is hot.” He further expressed great confidence in his “ever faithfulfriend and coadjutor, Mrs. Dr. Crofts” in forging a new antislavery sentiment inGreat Britain.22 [notes01.html#ch16fn_22a]Moreover, Douglass continued to clash openly with Garrisonians, exchanging nastycounteraccusations in October and November over whether he sought the demise ofthe American Anti-Slavery Society, which he vehemently denied. During thisseason of intense public furor in the land, he and Garrison made sure not toappear in the same physical space. Douglass also found time in late September toattend a “Seventh Annual Clam Bake,” a large social gathering of free AfricanAmericans, held that year in Fort Lee, New Jersey, on the Hudson River.Conceived by the New Yorker Peter A. Williams in 1853, this “grand ruralbanquet” drew people to days of entertainment and reunion from Boston, Newport,Providence, New York, Philadelphia, Hartford, and other towns. After a feast atFort Lee, speeches were made, and Douglass, as usual, was front and center. TheAnglo-African reported that as guests found their places, “a form arisestowering head and shoulders over the whole company, it is Frederick Douglass,thenceforth as ever the lion of the occasion.” Douglass knew how to work acrowd. In his own report on the occasion he maintained that his people shouldnever lose their “heart for amusement. . . . We like to study our people at playas well as at prayer.”23 [notes01.html#ch16fn_23a] Soon they were back to workthat needed their prayers.That summer and fall of 1860, Douglass threw himself back into his journalismand into the most transformative election in the nation’s history. Hope andprinciples were at war, and even serving each other, as never before. Since theDemocrats tore themselves into two sectionalized parts, one supporting StephenA. Douglas for president and the other John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, andsince the Republicans’ nomination of Abraham Lincoln, who despite beingapparently more moderate than his chief rival, William H. Seward, threatened theSouth in unprecedented ways, Douglass felt inspired by the pending electioncampaign. Assuming his election-year pose, he girded up for another walk alongthe thin line between endorsement and denunciation of Republicans. “TheRepublican party,” he told his British friends, “is . . . only negativelyantislavery. It is opposed to the political power of slavery, rather than toslavery itself.” But it possessed what no previous political force had becauseit could “humble the slave power and defeat all plans for giving slavery anyfurther guarantees of permanence.”24 [notes01.html#ch16fn_24a]Douglass promised to work for the Republicans even as he expressed contradictorycautions. Despite being disappointed by the Chicago platform, in a June 1860editorial he praised Lincoln. “Untried” and without claim to “any literaryculture beyond the circle of his practical duties,” the Illinois lawyer wasnevertheless “honest,” possessed a “well balanced head,” and “great firmness ofwill.” Douglass decided the Republicans really did nominate, in Lincoln, a“radical . . . fully committed to the doctrine of the ‘irrepressibleconflict.’ ” Although Douglass regretted the Republicans’ lack of moralabolitionism and would have preferred the “brave and inspiring march of astorming party,” in its absence he would settle for “the slow processes of acautious siege.”25 [notes01.html#ch16fn_25a] It was the political season indeed,and Douglass had never known a political persuasion that he could not both cheerand attack depending on the audience and purpose. His observations about Lincolnproved astute in the long run; at this tense juncture, however, Douglass tiltedin political crosswinds.On July 2, he wrote in a confused tone to Gerrit Smith, who struggled with amental breakdown in the wake of Harpers Ferry. “I cannot support Lincoln,”Douglass asserted, “but whether there is life enough in the Abolitionists[Radical Abolition Party] to name a candidate, I cannot say. I shall look toyour letter for light on the pathway of duty.” Then in August Douglass wrote inthe Monthly that the “vital element” of the Republican Party was its“antislavery sentiment.” “Nothing is plainer,” Douglass argued, “than that theRepublican party has its source in the old Liberty party.” It would live or die,he contended, “as the abolition sentiment of the country flourishes or fades.”Vexed by his commitments to moral principle and political action, Douglassannounced that he would vote for what historian Richard Sewell rightly calledthe remnant of Gerrit Smith’s “miniscule” radical party, while assiduouslyworking for Lincoln’s election.26 [notes01.html#ch16fn_26a]Douglass’s political fluctuations in 1860 were hardly unique; his publiceditorials were the searching efforts of a black leader to comprehend an amalgamof political interests and a party that seemed to both despise and champion hispeople. The American party system was undergoing a revolution, and the nationnow teetered on the brink of a potential disunion that both worried and thrilledDouglass. His political positions in 1860, as in 1856, reflected a personalitytrait historian James Oakes has called “impulsive and voluble,” a tendency to“sharp reversals” as he rushed his ideas into print each month in his paper. ButDouglass’s critiques of Lincoln and the Republicans were less rushed thanrepresentative of his lack of leverage and his isolation outside of the party’sinner circles. The only prominent Republican with whom Douglass had any regularcorrespondence was Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner, whom Douglass deeplyadmired as a radical, the “Wilberforce of America” with the daring and nerve todenounce the “barbarism of slavery” on the floor of the Senate.27[notes01.html#ch16fn_27a]Sumner was what Douglass wished the Republican Party would become—a force thatwould “grapple with the hell-born monster itself.” But he knew it was acoalition of interests, and he found an uncomfortable foothold among some of itsguiding ideas, especially the “denationalization” of slavery, a theory advancedmost prominently by Salmon P. Chase that sought to turn slavery in upon itself,where it would suffocate and die. Wherever federal jurisdiction existed—theDistrict of Columbia, the territories, foreign and interstate commerce, thepostal service, the Fugitive Slave Act—Republicans would either deny slaveryprotection or attack it. Douglass saw this variation on nonextensionism asmerely the first step in a constitutional plan to restrict slaverygeographically and then ultimately to eradicate it by federal action. Heabsolutely disagreed with Lincoln’s and the Republicans’ idea that they couldnot constitutionally end slavery in the states where it already legally existed;Douglass had been arguing the opposite for nearly a decade. “It will be a greatwork accomplished,” a newly encouraged Douglass wrote in June, “when thisGovernment is divorced from the active support of the inhuman slave system.” Hewanted to “turn the tide of the National Administration against the man-stealersof this country.”28 [notes01.html#ch16fn_28a] Thus Douglass found his own way tofold radical rhetoric into moderate methods and, at least most of the time, singhosannas to the Republicans.Excited and wary, Douglass did not merely await election returns in the fall of1860. In the thirty-two hundred words of editorials and the seven thousand wordsof a major speech on the West Indian emancipation anniversary in August alone,Douglass delivered a remarkably astute political analysis of the 1860 election,a journalist’s first draft of history if ever there was one. With informedprecision and a propagandist’s zeal, Douglass depicted the Republicancoalition’s diverse attitudes toward slavery in five parts: one, because it wasan expensive and wasteful “system of labor”; two, because it created an“aristocratic class who despise labor,” which in turn led to a broader“contempt” for all others who “work for an honest living”; three, because asmall Southern oligarchy had become “masters of the United States” and the“governing class” of the nation’s institutions; four, because it led some whiteswith an “aversion to blacks” to deny them all rights and liberties and toexclude them from new territories; and five, because the genuine “abolitionelement” saw slavery as the “most atrocious and revolting crime against natureand nature’s God,” a system of inhumanity to be destroyed out of a “mightyconviction.” The only group missing from Douglass’s characterization of theRepublican coalition were the nativists, the former Know-Nothing, anti-immigrantProtestant white Northerners who had made huge inroads into American politics inthe early 1850s.29 [notes01.html#ch16fn_29a] By 1860, they too found a placeunder the Republicans’ broad tent.Douglass gloated over the splitting of the Democrats into Northern and Southernfactions. The Democrats, argued Douglass, had historically surpassed all othersin “heartless cruelty” toward blacks; their division now opened a floodgate forthe Republican waters to rush through, and he sent up “a jubilee shout over thefact that the wisdom of the crafty had been confounded . . . the counsels of thewicked . . . brought to nought.” But in a different mood in the same briefperiod, the enthusiastic political junkie turned into a dark moral philosopher.Douglass knew the political calculus indicated that Lincoln and the Republicanswould win in November, but the previous decade had taught him not to trust theAmerican “national character.” For his people slavery had always beenexperienced as “grim and bloody tragedies . . . rehearsed day by day.” But mostAmericans, including Northerners about to vote Republican, were but “spectatorsin a theatre” watching the slavery crisis “as a grand operatic performance.”30[notes01.html#ch16fn_30a]Americans, Douglass believed, instinctively and culturally watched history andpreferred not to act in it. Douglass summed up his bitter complaint as “thisterrible paradox of passing history” rooted in a distinctively Americanselfishness. “Whoever levies a tax upon our Bohea or Young Hyson [two forms ofChinese tea], will find the whole land blazing with patriotism and bristlingwith bayonets.” If some foreign power tried to “impress a few Yankee sailors,”Americans would go “fight like heroes.” Douglass fashioned a witheringchastisement of American self-centeredness that would match any modern complaintabout the culture’s hyperindividualism. “Millions of a foreign race may bestolen from their homes, and reduced to hopeless and inhuman bondage among us,”he complained, “and we either approve the deed, or protest as gently as ‘suckingdoves.’ ” His “wickedly selfish” Americans loved to celebrate their “ownheritage, and on this condition are content to see others crushed in our midst.”They lived by the “philosophy of Cain,” ready with their bluntly evil answer tothe famous question “Am I my brother’s keeper?” Douglass’s use of the Cain andAbel parable is all the more telling if we remember that, unlike the moresentimental ways the “brother’s keeper” language is often employed today, Cainhad just killed his brother, and to God’s query as to Abel’s fate, Cain repliesin effect, why should I care? Douglass wanted the indifferent Americans, withblood on their hands as well, to read on further in Genesis and know Cain’s fateas “a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth.”31 [notes01.html#ch16fn_31a]On the eve of such a new and encouraging election, Douglass’s gloom seems odd atfirst glance. But this radical was still trying to comprehend just how to be aRepublican; his writings were the reflections of a hardened abolitionist notcertain whether the impending political collisions augured the liberation or thesacrificial doom of his people. The cynic in Douglass left him saying, “Heavenhelp the poor slave, whose only hope for freedom is in the selfish hearts ofsuch a people.”32 [notes01.html#ch16fn_32a] But the radical pragmatist kept oneeye trained on just how to apply that American self-interestedness to the causeof abolition.That fall Douglass never found peace on either side of his self-imposed dividebetween pure abolition and antislavery politics. Personally, he threw his voteaway in 1860; then as a social reformer he prepared to help push the newanti-Southern, antislavery politics along the course of abolition. In an August1860 speech, he tried to clarify his position: “I would gladly have a partyopenly combined to put down slavery at the South. In the absence of such aparty, I am glad to see a party in the field against which all that isslaveholding, malignant and Negro-hating, both in the North and the South, iscombined.” Whatever aroused the ire of the Slave Power was the friend of theslave. “The slaveholders know that the day of their power is over,” Douglassdeclared, “when a Republican president is elected.” At the very least, Southernfears of Lincoln’s potential victory served as “tolerable endorsements of theantislavery tendencies of the Republican Party.”33 [notes01.html#ch16fn_33a]More than anything else, the editor wanted to hasten a decisive conflict, arupture in the body politic that would force everyone to be taught by theevents.On Election Day, November 6, 1860, Douglass was in Rochester, working frommorning until night at the polls. His most immediate concern was a proposal onthe New York State ballot to abolish the $250 property requirement for blackvoters (no such requirement existed for whites). This movement for equalsuffrage had attracted the racist scorn of Democrats and only limitedendorsement from Republicans, but for black leaders it was the object of avigorous campaign. Coordinated from Albany by the black lobbyist and UndergroundRailroad activist Stephen A. Myers, and from New York City by McCuneSmith—Douglass managed western New York efforts—the campaign distributedthousands of copies of a tract, The Suffrage Question in Relation to ColoredVoters in the State of New York. The effort also created dozens of localsuffrage clubs and auxiliaries of their New York State Suffrage Association(with some fifty-six in New York City and Brooklyn alone). In the two monthsbefore the election, Douglass barnstormed western New York and distributedtwenty-five thousand copies of the tract.34 [notes01.html#ch16fn_34a]A constitutional amendment providing equal suffrage had passed the New Yorklegislature in 1857 but was never brought to a referendum. In 1860 the measurereemerged with almost unanimous Republican support and solid Democraticopposition. In the campaign, however, most Republican newspapers and speakersquietly ignored or opposed the referendum, fearing that it might hurt Lincoln’schances of winning the state. In October, Douglass wrote a brilliant editoriallambasting Democratic papers such as the New York World that denounced equalsuffrage on the grounds that it caused blacks and whites to be “intermingled inthe same community.” This position was not merely “mean and base,” and a “grossinjustice,” but ultimately lacked “saneness,” said the wry editor. The World wasat least largely honest with its racism. But in a passage that would fitperfectly into an early-twenty-first-century American debate overvoter-suppression measures, Douglass forcefully asked, “What is The World afraidof? Does it fear that with equal protection Negro blood would prove more than amatch for Anglo-Saxon blood in the race of improvement? Does it apprehend thedeparture of the reins of Government out of the hands of the white race, and forthis reason is in favor of continuing extra weight and an additional disabilityupon the Negro?”35 [notes01.html#ch16fn_35a]Douglass worked exhaustively for equal voting rights that autumn; but the resultleft him bitter and disillusioned. While Lincoln carried New York by 50,000votes, the suffrage measure met a resounding defeat, 337,985 to 197,503. WhatRepublican legislators had enacted they treated with disdain at the polls. Herewas proof of Douglass’s August reflections on American selfish individualism inthe face of basic human rights. A large number of Republican voters had simplyabstained on black suffrage as they voted for Lincoln. Douglass felt betrayed byRepublican silence on the suffrage issue: “The blow is a heavy and damaging one.Every intelligent colored man must feel it keenly.” The defeat cut to the bonewith its message of black political powerlessness. “We do not even wring fromthis vote the poor consolation that anybody was afraid of our influence orpower,” Douglass lamented. “The victory over us is simply one of blind ignoranceand prejudice.”36 [notes01.html#ch16fn_36a] The man who believed he couldsomehow change history by his pen, his voice, and now his vote felt inaudible.• • •But as before, Douglass converted the election of Lincoln, and the threats ofsecession from the Deep South, into a performance of his duty of hope, albeit ahope tinged with anger and exhausted cynicism. By December, from his Rochesterdesk, an ambivalent Douglass gave his best interpretation of the meaning of theelection. Despite carrying only approximately 40 percent of the total vote,Lincoln’s victory in the four-way, sectionalized contest had altered the balanceof power in America. But to what end no one could yet know, especially a blackeditor in his western New York outpost. The Republicans’ rise to federal powermight discredit the Fugitive Slave Act as well as extinguish the South’s effortsto revive the foreign slave trade, Douglass posited. Abolitionist ideas had beenthoroughly disseminated by the campaign, he reasoned, and therefore the “chiefbenefit” may simply have been the “canvass itself.” Lincoln’s election had atleast broken the “enchantment” too many Northern politicians had felt toward theSlave Power; a new political force had finally ended the “perpetual bondage toan ignoble fear.”37 [notes01.html#ch16fn_37a] But these were hardly celebratorywords for the victors of 1860. In the immediate wake of the election Douglasshedged all of his bets.On the eve of South Carolina’s secession, Douglass was not convinced that enoughradical disposition existed on either side to cause an open split, especiallyone that would lead to war. He reprinted nearly three full pages of reactionsfrom Southern newspapers, what he called “Southern Thunder,” but interpreted itas largely bluster. Despite all the secessionist rhetoric, he contended that theSouth had overreacted to Lincoln’s threat and misinterpreted his intentions.Because of his high office and essential moderation, Douglass argued, Lincolncould even become the abolition movement’s most powerful enemy. Disappointingly,Douglass saw “no sufficient cause for the dissolution of the Union”; indeed, hefeared that the Union might now be saved—through compromises—for all the wrongreasons, thus blunting if not destroying the abolitionists’ voice and leverage.Although slaveholders might not realize it, Douglass predicted that slaverywould be “as safe, and safer, in the Union under such a President [Lincoln] thanit can be under any President of a Southern Confederacy.” Under the stress andstrain of just what secession would mean, amid days and weeks of great confusionover what a silent Lincoln would do, Douglass argued that the election hadtaught the country the “possibility of electing if not an Abolitionist, at leastan antislavery reputation to the Presidency of the United States.” While theeditor possessed the “pen, voice and influence of only one man,” he would stayhis course and “join in no cry . . . less than the complete and universalabolition of the whole slave system.”38 [notes01.html#ch16fn_38a] Douglass tooksolace from simply wielding his pen in the service of the old cause as he awokeevery day for the news in a crisis like no other.Douglass found little encouragement in the behavior of the Northern publicduring the secession crisis. The bulk of white Northerners had always viewedabolitionists with suspicion or contempt, and with the threat of disunion in theair, hostility to antislavery agitators rose to new levels of violence. ByDecember 1860, Northern workingmen, along with merchants, shipowners, and cottonmanufacturers, were deeply worried about the impact of potential disunion, whilebankers and industrialists squirmed as the prices of stocks declined markedly.The specter of financial ruin caused the spirit of political reconciliation torevive, and the conservative and the Democratic press teemed with pro-compromisesentiment as well as incendiary attacks on abolitionists. While Southern stateconventions debated secession, mob violence against antislavery speakers ragedin several Northern cities in the first two months of 1861. A revolution wasafoot, but no one quite knew its course or consequences. Abolitionists providedready scapegoats for mobs engulfed by economic and political panic.39[notes01.html#ch16fn_39a]Douglass and many of his comrades faced just such a mob in force on December 3,1860, at a gathering in Tremont Temple in Boston, called to commemorate thefirst anniversary of the execution of John Brown. Freed from the remoteness ofhis editor’s desk, Douglass seemed to welcome a fight, verbal or otherwise. Thatis exactly what he got. As the abolitionists gathered to address the broad topicof “How can American slavery be abolished?,” a well-dressed crowd, what Douglasscalled “a gentlemen’s mob,” quickly outnumbered them and physically overtook theplatform. For three hours this daytime meeting was nothing less than a shouting,chaotic melee complete with insults and epithets of all kinds, fisticuffs,chairs smashed and thrown, a swaying battle for control of the hall by the twocompeting sides. Eventually the Boston police took over and forced a clearing ofthe building. At the center of the fight for the abolitionists was Douglass,coat removed, sleeves rolled up, and in full angry voice returning nearly everyinsult with one of his own. First James Redpath and then Franklin Sanborn triedto exercise control as chairmen, but they were shouted away by what Boston andNew York reporters called the “Unionists,” who hijacked the meeting. Amid “greatconfusion and noise,” Douglass, invited as a featured speaker, “frequentlyinterrupted” the mob’s chairman, a Richard S. Fay. When Fay complained that hecould not make himself heard over the tumult, Douglass warmed to the game byshouting, “When thine enemy thirst give him drink!” to “applause and hisses.”The Unionists put forward a series of anti–John Brown resolutions, to whichDouglass again led the resistance, with some of the abolitonists now standing ontheir chairs, fists raised and calling on their champion, Douglass, to speak.Shouts of “Douglass! Douglass!” rang out around the Temple.40[notes01.html#ch16fn_40a]The orator, who had both endured and enjoyed these violent rituals before,demanded the floor with a voice all apparently could hear, prompting Fay’spartisans to yet-louder screams of “Nigger!” . . . “Knock him down!” and“Treason!” For a few minutes Douglass managed some coherent statements, as heshouted down his opponents with “You are in the service of the slaveholders ofthe United States. . . . It is said the best way to abolish slavery is to obeythe law. Shall we obey the blood-hounds of the law who do the dirty work of theslave catchers?”41 [notes01.html#ch16fn_41a]Douglass gave as he took. With disturbances breaking out all over the hallthroughout this bizarre struggle, Douglass fought for the podium, at one pointpushing his way through a line of men and fighting, said one Boston reporter,“like a trained pugilist.” He even fought with one man for possession of a chairin which to sit. But Douglass fought most the battle of words. He asked thegathering to “cast aside with indignation the wild and guilty fantasy that manowns property in man, even in that stout, big-fisted fellow down there, who hasjust insulted me.” As someone shouted, “Go on, nigger!,” Douglass answered fromExodus, “The freedom of all mankind was written on the heart by the finger ofGod!” Then from the sublime to the ridiculous, he screamed at another heckler,“If I was a slave driver, and had hold of that man for five minutes, I would letmore daylight through his skin than ever got there before.” These hatefulexchanges, however relished by the combatants, ended in pushing, shoving, andfists thrown wildly, coats torn off. One group dragged Douglass down by his hair(or his “wool” as reported), until a group of his friends rescued and protectedhim. Only the police could end such madness, but not before Douglass, who sodefended his dignity and pride from even the smallest of slights, proclaimedthat he felt “no more embarrassment by this uproar than if I had been kicked bya jackass.” As the police took over the stage and the hall, Douglass shouted,“Three cheers for liberty!,” as the opponents shouted, “Three cheers forGovernor Wise!”42 [notes01.html#ch16fn_42a]Later that night, the abolitionists reassembled at a black church on Joy Streetin Beacon Hill to remember John Brown and honor free speech. Perhaps with aclean shirt, Douglass again was a key speaker. For the first time in nearlyeight years by his own count, he appeared on the same platform with oldGarrisonian comrade Wendell Phillips. Douglass announced hearty agreement withPhillips that “all methods of proceeding against slavery” should be used,including the “John Brown way.” With John Brown Jr. in attendance at the smallchurch, and with a large crowd outside trying to get in, Douglass preached infavor of violence and war. They needed to keep all slaveholders in “fear ofpersonal danger,” Douglass pronounced. “I rejoice in every uprising at theSouth” among slaves. Douglass even drew from Old Man Brown’s crowd-pleasingpoetic, if faulty, military idea: “There is liberty in yonder mountains . . . inthe Alleghenies . . . a thousand men scattered in those hills, and slavery isdead.” Feeling the spirit after that day’s mob attack, Douglass called for anAmerican Garibaldi to march into the South and “summon to his standard sixtythousand, if necessary, to accomplish the freedom of the slave.” Unfortunately,in the little war already breaking out in Boston, white mobs dogged WendellPhillips on his path home, threatening his life. Several blacks while leavingthe church around 10:15 p.m. were assaulted and some seriously injured.43[notes01.html#ch16fn_43a] Douglass, the war propagandist wishing for blood anddisunion, retreated from the former antislavery citadel of Boston unharmed.• • •In late December 1860, Douglass welcomed the news of South Carolina’s secessionfrom the Union. Heaping scorn upon the Palmetto State’s rash act, as well asrelishing it as an opportunity, Douglass all but thanked the secessionists for“preferring to be a large piece of nothing, to being any longer a small piece ofsomething.” Secessionists had resharpened his wit. They provided what heinitially hoped would be the long-awaited opening for his cause—disunion,political crisis, and some form of sanctioned military action against the Southand therefore against slavery. He would get his wish, but only through theconfusion and fear of the secession winter of 1860–61. “Her people [SouthCarolina’s],” Douglass declared with anxious glee, “(except those of them heldin slavery, which are more than half her population) have hailed the event asanother and far more glorious Fourth of July, and are celebrating it with plentyof gunpowder, bad brandy, but as yet no balls, except those where perfumedladies and gentlemen move their feet to the inspiring notes of the fiddle.” Withno veiled intent, Douglass wished for a fight: “Other balls may yet come, andunless South Carolina shall retreat, or the Federal Government shall abdicateits functions, they must come.”44 [notes01.html#ch16fn_44a]Douglass had dreamed of this kind of moment, events that could dislodge historyfrom its worn paths and move it in new directions. In editorials he lampoonedwhat South Carolinians imagined as “peaceful secession,” celebrated by“bonfires, pyrotechnics . . . music and dancing.” He cautioned Carolinians overtheir confidence about “a thing as easily done,” so he maintained they believed,“as the leaving of a society of Odd Fellows, or bidding good night to aspiritual circle.” Excitement over secession, in South and North, according tothe editor, tilted from an “undercurrent of doubt, uncertainty, distrust andforeboding.” Then he delivered a historical and constitutional analysis ofsecession. South Carolina was out of the Union, argued Douglass, only “onpaper,” and in “resolutions and telegrams.” Governments “rest not upon paper,but upon power. They do not solicit obedience as a favor, but compel it as aduty.” Douglass, the sudden American nationalist, acknowledged the “right ofrevolution” for a state or a political group, but no constitutional “right ofsecession.” A state could not secede; it could revolt. “Revolution in thiscountry is rebellion, and rebellion is treason, and treason is levying waragainst the United States, with something more than paper resolutions. . . .There must be swords, guns, powder, balls, and men behind them to use them.”Secession was no abstract debate over federalism or states’ rights, no issueresolved merely by ordinances, but a matter of power and guns. “The right ofSouth Carolina to secede,” declared the angry but thrilled abolitionist,“depends upon her ability to do so, and to stay so.”45 [notes01.html#ch16fn_45a]Twenty years of pent-up personal travail and abolitionist struggle now flowedthrough Douglass’s pen in Rochester. He believed, as many reasonable Americanshave ever since, that the significance of any exercise of states’ rightsdoctrine is in the issue for which it is employed. To Douglass, civil war wasfrightful, but by January and February 1861, he cast the prospect in positiveand apocalyptic language. The “God in history everywhere pronouncing the doom ofthose nations which frame mischief by law,” he declared, had caused a“concussion . . . against slavery which would now rock the land, and sends usstaggering about as if shaken by an earthquake.” National will and institutionshad not solved the problem. “If there is not wisdom and virtue enough in theland to rid the country of slavery, then the next best thing is to let the Southgo . . . and be made to drink the wine cup of wrath and fire, which her longcareer . . . [of] barbarism and blood shall call down upon her guilty head.”46[notes01.html#ch16fn_46a]Image [../images/f0332-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, c. 1861.Highly polemical, not always attuned to the nuances and divisions among theRepublicans nor to the scale of unionism in parts of the divided South, andfilling his own cups of wrath, Douglass wanted the clarity of polarizedconflict. He wanted war. Perhaps his greatest fear as the secession crisisunfolded was the potential for concession and compromise. For a former slave andthen an orator and an editor whose political consciousness had awakened with theMexican War and the Compromise of 1850, who had seen the fate of the slavesbandied about in one political crisis after another, and who had struggled tosustain hope in the face of the Dred Scott decision’s egregious denials, aresolute stand by the North against secession and the Slave Power was hardly asure thing. The best hopes of blacks, Douglass said that winter, had always beendashed by the “old medicine of compromise.” As he observed resolutions andconventions intended to settle the crisis, he complained that secession’senablers, North and South, had “filled the air with whines of compromise.”47[notes01.html#ch16fn_47a]Compromise proposals came into Washington from all quarters of the North. Somewere resolutions passed at pro-compromise Union meetings, and some were thepetitions of committees of industrialists eager to sustain their Southerncommercial ties. All politicians were wary of the wrath and fears of theirconstituents and fervent to preserve the Union. On December 18, 1860, John J.Crittenden of Kentucky introduced the most comprehensive of the compromiseinitiatives, a series of constitutional amendments that blanketed the range ofconciliatory measures. The debate over the Crittenden Compromise and others likeit paralyzed Congress during the entire interregnum and secession winter.48[notes01.html#ch16fn_48a]Douglass feared compromise for good reason. Thirty years of antislaveryagitation and its meager gains, as well as the very meaning of the RepublicanParty, were at stake. Attended by delegates from twenty-one states (althoughnone from the Deep South) and sponsored by the Virginia legislature, a peaceconference convened in Washington on February 4, 1861. After three weeks ofconfusion and negotiation, the uninspired gathering reported a compromiseproposal nearly identical to that of Crittenden. No compromise measures everpassed the divided Congress; week after week of wrangling gave evidence thatmost Democrats but only a handful of Republicans were willing to appease theSouth and extend the life of slavery in order to save the Union. As six more ofthe cotton states joined South Carolina and bolted the Union by early February,most Republicans across the North had resolved to prevent any conciliation. MostNorthern state legislatures also refused to support compromise; only New Jerseyformally endorsed the Crittenden plan, which was a set of one-sided concessionsto the South.49 [notes01.html#ch16fn_49a]Douglass observed the secession crisis with a combination of excitement anddismay. At least until late February he believed the prospect for a majorcompromise to be real. He simply did not yet trust the will of the RepublicanParty and its president-elect, Lincoln. Discouraged, he complained that thestate of the abolitionist cause was “somewhat gloomy and dark.” Abolitionistshad “plied the national heart and conscience with sound doctrine,” but theyseemed “as far from accomplishment of their work as during the proslavery mobsof twenty-five years ago.” Plenty of new mobs raged in the present. In Januaryin Rochester, a convention of abolitionists meeting in Corinthian Hall wasattacked by a violent crowd. The abolitionists reconvened at the Spring StreetAME Zion Church to complete their meeting, out of which developed a series ofweekly Sunday lectures organized by Douglass that lasted throughout thesecession crisis.50 [notes01.html#ch16fn_50a]Uncertain of whom to trust or on whom to turn his anger, Douglass felt an acutesense of powerlessness as the Union dissolved. He feared that secession wouldbecome a struggle only over the survival of the Union and not over slavery.“What disturbs, divides, and threatens to bring on civil war . . . and ruin thiscountry,” he pled in February, “but slavery?” Only the “morally blind,” heargued, could fail to see it.51 [notes01.html#ch16fn_51a] What Douglass dreadedmost was that a great opportunity to strike a lasting blow for black freedommight forever be lost through peaceful reconciliation. So he braced for theworst and anxiously awaited the inauguration of Abraham Lincoln.By March, Douglass seemed well aware that his fondest hopes were at the mercy ofevents. He knew the secession crisis was a test of power; whether it resulted inwar depended upon the reaction of the incoming Lincoln administration, which tohim represented the “one ray of hope amid the darkness of the passing hour andthe reign of doubt and distraction.” But by early April Douglass was anythingbut confident that “coercion” against the South would ever truly come. He couldonly feel despair. “All talk of putting down treason and rebellion by force, byour demoralized Government and people,” he agonized, “are as impotent andworthless as the words of a drunken woman in a ditch.” He still expected“schemers” to reach a deal.52 [notes01.html#ch16fn_52a] And so he imagined afuture where abolitionists would have to attack slavery in a separate,independent country, and their work would take revolutionary turns. Then, as ofold, he reached for desperate hope in a logic of violence. Faith strainedagainst unpredictable daily events and a volatile politics he could only dimlydiscern. These were the sentiments of a man observing a revolution, thedirections of which he could not control. But then the startling turn of eventscaused by the bombardment of one island fort in Charleston Harbor changedeverything.By April, in Rochester, lecturing at the Spring Street AME Zion Church, where hehad done so nearly every week during the past two months, Douglass spoke for hiscommunity: “I have never spent days so restless and anxious. Our mornings andevenings have continually oscillated between the dim light of hope and thegloomy shadow of despair. We have opened our papers, new and damp from thepress, tremblingly, lest the first line of the lightning should tell us that ourNational Capital has fallen into the hands of traitors and murderers.”53[notes01.html#ch16fn_53a] The secession crisis took an enormous emotional tollon Americans of every persuasion. The only thing foggier than war itself can bethe path to its frightening, if too often exciting, outbreak. Douglass ached forthe event that would relieve the emotional tension and teach the world a newhistory."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 17--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE KINDLING SPIRIT OF HIS BATTLE CRYThe human heart is a seat of constant war.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, JUNE 1861More than a century and a half after Appomattox, surveying the landscape ofhorror and mass destruction that modern war has wreaked upon the human species,reasonable people pause in examining those leaders in the past who have beenbold advocates of war, as well as the creators of hated enemies targeted forattack and elimination. The willingness to kill and the desire to urge others inorganized armies to kill for a cause are both primal and historical, personaland ideological. By the spring of 1861, Frederick Douglass yearned for war; hislong rehearsal as a war propagandist had reached its final stages.As the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar suggested in a eulogy in 1897, Douglass, asmuch as any Northern partisan in the Civil War, kindled a “battle cry” offreedom:He dared the lightning in the lightning’s track,And answered thunder with his thunder back. . . .We weep for him, but we have touched his hand,And felt the presence of his magic nigh,The current that he sent thro’out the land,The kindling spirit of his battle-cry.Douglass welcomed the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 with a combinedspirit of relief and rage. He was not a warrior himself, as he had discovered inhis struggle with John Brown. But he was more than ready to wield his pen andvoice to send millions to destroy slavery, slaveholders, and anyone shoulderingarms in their defense. “The contest must now be decided, and decided forever,”Douglass demanded in March 1861, “which of the two, Freedom or Slavery, shallgive law to this republic. Let the conflict come, and God speed the right.” InMay, after war had begun, he rejoiced, “For this consummation we have watchedand wished with fear and trembling. God be praised! that it has come at last.”1[notes01.html#ch17fn_1a]For Douglass the road to war had been emotionally and intellectually crooked.With great anticipation he awaited President Lincoln’s inaugural address, ahistorical moment dominated, said Douglass, by fear that the Government had beenallowed by the previous Buchanan administration to “float to the very verge ofdestruction.” On February 18, Douglass joined a throng of fifteen thousandpeople who gathered at the Rochester train station to get a glimpse of Lincolnas the president-elect passed through on his storied, whistle-stop journey toWashington, DC, for the inauguration. Douglass did not record whether he wavedand cheered the Illinoisan as he stepped out on the rear balcony of thepresidential train, or whether Douglass merely reflected with anxiety on thefestive occasion. Under threat of assassination and with military preparationsminimal and unstable, Lincoln entered Washington in secrecy and in the dark ofthe night only a few days before the March 4 inauguration. Douglass exploitedthe ironies for all they were worth, writing, “Mr. Lincoln entered the Capitalas the poor, hunted fugitive slave reaches the North, in disguise, seekingconcealment, evading pursuers, by the underground railroad . . . not during thesunlight, but crawling and dodging under the sable wing of night.” Douglasswelcomed Lincoln to the status of fugitive slave.2 [notes01.html#ch17fn_2a]Lincoln’s speech, however, was a disappointment to the abolitionist. Lincoln’solive branches for the South were to Douglass so much “weakness, timidity, andconciliation.” He judged the address a “double-tongued document” for itsdeclarations of support for the right of property in slaves in the existingslave states, and especially for Lincoln’s quoting of the originalfugitive-slave clause in the Constitution and his promise to enforce all lawfulefforts to return fugitive slaves to their owners. To Lincoln’s cautiousrhetorical and legal gestures to the South, Douglass responded with outrage andas a former fugitive slave. Instead of meeting the South’s revolution with“honest rebuke,” charged Douglass, the president served up “palliations andapologies.” As harsh as he could get, Douglass accused Lincoln of telling “theslaveholders what an excellent slave hound he is, and how he regards the rightto recapture fugitive slaves a constitutional duty.” Douglass did grudginglyacknowledge the president’s vehement rejection of secession as the “essence ofanarchy” and assertion of the Union as “perpetual.” Douglass demanded, however,that Lincoln not argue with secessionists or “parley with traitors” but fightthem; he denounced the new president as “the most dangerous advocate ofslave-hunting and slave-catching in the land.”3 [notes01.html#ch17fn_3a] Suchwas the beginning of the difficult, if eventually historic, relationship betweenFrederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.A discouraged, even floundering Douglass all but reversed one of hislong-standing positions by the spring of 1861. He considered emigrating fromAmerica. The Scottish-born abolitionist, former supporter of John Brown, andperipatetic radical James Redpath had been leading a campaign for AfricanAmerican emigration to Haiti since early 1860. Douglass not only ran frequentadvertisements for the company, but warmed to the idea himself by early 1861. InJanuary he declared that he could “raise no objection” to the Haitian emigrationmovement, his opposition to earlier schemes of relocation to West Africanotwithstanding. The Republic of Haiti was in the Western Hemisphere, closer forblack Americans to their cousins enslaved in the United States, and officiallywelcoming immigrants. For once, Douglass maintained, the Haitian alternativemight provide a means for some of emigrating without “appealing to our enemiesfor the means of getting out of the way of their hatred.” Further, it meant thatblacks were not “conceding that Africa is our only home, and that we have noright to remain in America.” Douglass despised the idea of emigration when itmerely confirmed the racist notion that blacks and whites could never livetogether in equality. For a time, Haiti seemed to provide him a means of stilldetesting colonization as fashioned by white enemies, while acknowledging abasic human right to leave for brighter climes. That winter he gave his bestwishes to twelve Rochester African American families who followed their Baptistminister in moving to Haiti.4 [notes01.html#ch17fn_4a]By March, Douglass accepted emigration if driven by the human motives for better“food, clothing, property, education, manhood, and material prosperity” and notby the “charms of a Colored Nationality.” With his own brand of romance aboutthe history of the Haitian republic born in black revolution, Douglass became aqualified emigrationist in the troubled secession winter. He was deeply worriedfor the safety of Northern free blacks, and even more about the newinsurrectionary rumors and tensions emanating from the South. “The United Statesis in great trouble,” he announced. “Slavery, vengeance, and settled hate frownand threaten the free colored people.” He warned that no one could any longertell where proslavery mobs would strike next. They had become “contagious” sincehis violent encounter in Boston in December. “The disorder has travelled likethe cholera from East to West.”5 [notes01.html#ch17fn_5a]In the Monthly, Douglass announced that, with his daughter Rosetta, nowtwenty-two years old, he had booked a steamer for April 25, embarking from NewHaven, Connecticut, and at the invitation and largesse of the Haitian consulatein Philadelphia, to visit the island nation. Redpath had brokered thearrangements. What Douglass did not say is that he might have been traveling asa threesome; Ottilie Assing announced in her own column in Morgenblatt that shetoo “was making plans to take a trip to Haiti, in order to learn by directencounter about the conditions in this Negro republic.” Whether Douglass and hisGerman friend made these travel plans “together” for romantic reasons, as herbiographer suggests, is dubious. Why would he invite Rosetta to join them?Possibly Douglass entertained the fantasy of escape in this tense politicalatmosphere. Asking his smart but volatile and restless adult daughter, however,to share the trip seems incongruent at best. Douglass was surely capable ofembodying and living such contradictions, perhaps even quite publicly at times.Assing and Rosetta knew each other well by then from the lady’s summer visits toRochester. But as always, Assing is our only source for these plans and motives.Whatever alternative futures Assing may have imagined, what we do know is thatshe and Douglass frequently wrote about the same issues, often in similar toneand language.6 [notes01.html#ch17fn_6a]Image [../images/f0338-01.jpg]Rosetta Sprague Douglass, late 1850s.Douglass described his mission to Haiti as reflecting a citizen’s need for studyand travel and a journalist’s desire to report on and “do justice to Haiti, topaint her as she is.” He was going as well with a black man’s pride in showingthat Haiti was “free, orderly and independent,” admitting also that he hadalways longed to stand on the “soil of San Domingo, the theater of many stirringevents and heroic achievements, the work of a people, bone of our bone, andflesh of our flesh.” He came close to recommending what he had earlierdenounced: the “charms of a colored nationality.” He waxed exuberant aboutescaping Rochester’s wintry cold for Haiti’s tropical warmth. Politically, histrip was to observe whether the Haitian republic might be “an asylum from theapprehended storm which is about to beat pitilessly upon African Americans.”7[notes01.html#ch17fn_7a] Douglass could not have known that overnight he wouldbe writing about a very different storm.On April 12, before Douglass went to press with his paper, Confederateinsurgents fired on Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor, and the Civil Warcommenced. Douglass appended a brief postscript to his editorial “A Trip toHaiti.” The editor tried to capture the nation’s as well as his own sense of thedrama of that moment: “Since this article . . . was put in type, we findourselves in circumstances which induce us to forego our much desired trip toHaiti.” War fever surged through Northern communities and turned a divided andanxious populace into a swarm of excited unity. In her columns, Assing joinedthe journalistic fray, sometimes clearly modeling Douglass’s writings in theMonthly, which came out before she took up her pen. She described the news ofFort Sumter hitting New York City “like a bolt of lightning,” citizens soenthused as though “walking on a volcano.” She observed militia drilling in thestreets, huge lines of men of all ethnicities volunteering for the army. Attimes she modeled Douglass’s columns, but in other moments wrote with her owndistinctive gusto. She witnessed Jefferson Davis depicted in a “life-size effigyof straw and wood” hanging from a banner over a street, flags waving everywhereon buildings, on carriages, and even on horses’ heads. Douglass likely neverread her columns, since they were written in German, although he was surelydelighted to have some of his own ideas disseminated among German progressives.A world-changing event had occurred, and Douglass never missed a chance toinstruct with events. “The last ten days have made a tremendous revolution inall things pertaining to the possible future of the colored people of the UnitedStates.” Northerners, he said, had experienced some of the “savage barbarism ofslavery,” and he would now do his part to teach them “to make war upon it.”8[notes01.html#ch17fn_8a]• • •“I hated slavery, slaveholders, and all pertaining to them,” Douglass wrote inBondage and Freedom in 1855; “and I did not fail to inspire others with the samefeeling, wherever and whenever opportunity was presented.” He crafted thatpassage, one of many in his autobiographies about his enduring rage against hisoppressors, to capture the perceived danger and power of his newfound literacyamong his fellow slaves. That literacy, he said, had made him “a marked ladamong the slaves, and a suspected one among the slaveholders.”9[notes01.html#ch17fn_9a] To say the least, Douglass had always cherished thispower to hurl words, and when necessary hatred, against slavery andslaveholders. History had seemingly opened a broad door to a new opportunity toinspire a vast nation as he had once done on Freeland’s farm in Talbot County,Maryland, for a tiny band of brothers.But in the spring of 1861 Douglass complained that words and their meanings hadbeen debased in the crisis of disunion: “The strangest feature of this eventfuldrama is the complete inversion of the sense of . . . words.” “Treason” and“Armed Rebellion” were “now simply the sovereign right of Secession, and theexecution of the Laws is now called ‘Coercion.’ ” To Douglass, the secessionistswere the mortal enemies of the government as they inspired resistance amongabolitionists. Traitors merited no quarter; President James Buchanan was no merebenign lame duck but the “chief of sinners,” and Douglass insisted over andagain on his own label for the Deep South’s revolution—the “treasonableSlaveholding Confederacy.”10 [notes01.html#ch17fn_10a] Douglass had beenpracticing this kind of rhetoric for a long time; by 1861, it was as if thesecessionists, as well as truckling Yankees, had flipped his switch intooverdrive.Douglass seized the moment with a fervor as great as any other in his career. Tohim the central meaning of secession and the coming of the war was that itraised at least the possibility of “armed abolition,” of mingling the cause ofthe slave and the rights of free black people with the life of the nation. “Atlast our proud Republic is overtaken,” he enthused in April 1861, after FortSumter. Although he predicted that the nation would suffer untold destruction,the moment felt “propitious,” and the war welcome. “Now is the time to changethe cry of vengeance long sent up from the . . . toiling bondman into a gratefulprayer for the peace and safety of the Government.” He had rarely spoken of theUnited States government in such warm tones. This was only possible because hebeheld a crisis that “bound up the fate of the Republic and that of the slave inthe same bundle.” Douglass put the fears of the secession winter aside now andrejoiced in the crisis. The nation, he said, “has put one end of the chain uponthe ankle of the bondman, and the other end about its own neck.” In a land thatmust “now . . . weep and howl amid ten thousand desolations brought on by thesins of two centuries,” he turned again to the old prophets for his own cry tothe nation: “Repent, Break Every Yoke, let the Oppressed Go Free for Hereinalone is deliverance and safety!”11 [notes01.html#ch17fn_11a] For the next fouryears, Douglass’s Civil War became his very own cry of vengeance.In a struggle Douglass and many others on both sides saw increasingly as a “holywar” over slavery and freedom, blame had to be precisely assigned to fomentsufficient fervor and bloodlust to fight it. In a homespun set of metaphorsDouglass provided clear images about responsibility for the war. And he thusunveiled his apocalyptic sense of history—a belief in the occasional cosmiccollision of forces, necessary rendings and bloodlettings when God chose toenter history and overturn it for the creation of a new age. In an April 1861editorial, “Who Killed the American Eagle?,” Douglass seemed confident at leastthat the old Union was dead. “By an old agreement . . . between Mr. South andMr. North, the eagle was to be raffled off between the contracting parties everyfour years, and whichever got the highest number, was to take the bird for thenext four years. For many years Mr. South had regularly won the eagle, andenjoyed its services. He had trained it to hunt slaves, to protectslave-traders . . . to steal from Mexico, to tear the flesh of offensivestrangers, to guard, protect and extend slavery.” Mr. North had always covetedthis bird of prey, and he “determined that if he should ever get possession ofthe eagle, he would teach him better manners, and train him to better habits.”At last, in 1860, Mr. North won the eagle, but “before handing it over, as inhonor bound, the treacherous Mr. South filled the unsuspecting bird with a heavydose of secession powder so that our once majestic bird was as good as dead.”12[notes01.html#ch17fn_12a]In this revealing vignette, Douglass shows his conception of the Union, a oncepowerful republic hopelessly corrupted by slavery. Why had the eagle died? “Thebird must die,” Douglass argued, “and the verdict of the inquest must be that itdied of poison, treacherously administered at the instigation of Mr. South byone James Buchanan.”13 [notes01.html#ch17fn_13a] Douglass used the word “must”to demonstrate his vision not only of secession but of history itself.Slaveholders, in association with their Northern accomplices, had killed the oldUnion. They must kill it, he reasoned, and it must die, for otherwise a newUnion—a new nation with a new future—was not possible. Such metaphors onlyconfirmed Douglass’s deep desire for an overturning and remaking of America andof his faith in apocalyptic change.In 1861 Douglass’s quest to fashion the enemy and to define the nature of theUnion cause took many forms. His newspaper was never more important as amouthpiece for his activism than in the first two years of the Civil War.Although he stayed closer to Rochester in 1861 than normal, Douglass held forthpublicly nearly every Sunday afternoon from winter to late summer at the AMEZion Church. Some of the gatherings became so large that they relocated to theRochester City Hall. As wartime so often necessitates, these werecommunity-solidarity gatherings, attended by blacks and whites, and crucial tosustaining morale in abnormally tense times. Douglass treated that pulpit at thecorner of Spring and Havor Streets—a black church—as a place to conduct his ownkind of war rallies. “Like the rod of Moses,” he declared on May 5, “whichswallowed up all the petty creations of the Eastern magicians, the awful andsublime crisis in our national affairs, swallows up all other subjects.” Justtwo days before, some twenty thousand Rochesterites had gathered in the citycenter to watch and cheer as eight companies of soldiers paraded to the trainstation and off to war to become the Thirteenth New York Volunteers. Douglasscelebrated the “solemn departure of the troops . . . composed of the sons,brothers, husbands and fathers of some . . . of those who hear me.” Although hehad already argued a week earlier for the recruitment of “colored regiments,” noblack men were part of that first Rochester war parade. Nevertheless, Douglassdescribed the scene as a “thrilling spectacle” and admitted to witnessing it“with feelings I cannot describe.”14 [notes01.html#ch17fn_14a] But describe hisfeelings about the war is just what he did in the coming months.In those Sunday talks Douglass also tried to represent the feelings of hisaudiences, especially blacks. That “rod of Moses” worked for them. “We cannotsee the end from the beginning,” he announced only two weeks into the war. “Welive but today, and the measureless shores of the future are wisely hid fromus. . . . There is a general feeling amongst us, that the control of events hasbeen taken out of our hands, that we have fallen into the mighty current . . .of invisible forces.” As war fever swept over the land, conceptions of time andsensibility had changed, the world suddenly appeared both more dangerous andmore exhilarating, and individuals felt a part of a larger whole even as anxietyprevailed. For Douglass the outbreak of war easily incited his practiced zeal toassault slavery in all its manifestations at a moment of special vulnerability.But the war also prompted untypical expressions of patriotism and Americannationalism. He spoke for the “oppressed and enslaved,” Douglass said, but nowhe could “also speak as an American. All that I have and am are bound up withthe destiny of this country.” Douglass may never have completely stoppedbelieving such sentiments, but they had rarely formed the key lines in speeches.Of the American republic, he told his Rochester neighbors, “I still feel thatshe is my country, and that I must fall or flourish with her.”15[notes01.html#ch17fn_15a] For the man who had often claimed he had “no country,”the events of April made him feel his patriotism. Fort Sumter and Lincoln’s callfor seventy-five thousand volunteers to put down the rebellion had changednearly everything, especially on Sunday afternoons.Before any major battles were fought, Douglass called for a long and mercilesswar that would not only root out and destroy secession but the “monster” ofslavery itself. He continued to grouse about the potential for compromises thatmight still be struck between cowed Northern politicians and Confederateleaders. “The spirit of compromise is still abroad here,” he wrote in a Junecolumn. Fear seemed to rule most people in the North, who, he contended,“cherish no deeper feeling against slavery than that which arises from a senseof mischief it does to the white race, and the troubles and dangers it bringsupon the country.” From England, Julia Crofts agreed and wrote for the Monthlyof her own struggles to explain the reactions to secession in the North to herEnglish friends: “The Southerners, of the two, are far better understood by usall. They act more . . . straightforward in their course—bad as it is.” ButNorthern reactions to potential war puzzled her, as she wielded adjectives asfloridly as her Rochester colleague. “For the poor, timid, cowardly, servile,dishonest North, I can find no words to express the contempt I feel. They cannotbe made to see the power they . . . might wield in the sacred cause of humanfreedom.” Northerners did not yet grasp that they had been visited, as Douglasscontended, with a “glorious opportunity” at destruction and reinvention.16[notes01.html#ch17fn_16a]At first Douglass could hardly contain his combination of enthusiasm and rage.In the first month of the war, he prepared three full pages of articles andletters in his paper, detailing a litany of brutality, violence, rape, and othercrimes in the South. He offered such a display as his “chapter of horrors” aboutthe enemy, “an illustration of the peculiar manners, temper, and morals of ourslaveholding society.” Gleaned from papers North and South, the collection ofbrutalities, an old antislavery technique, included lynchings of Northerners,jailings of people with abolitionist sentiment, and all manner of beatings andduels, one fought over a mulatto girl. For clarity Douglass boiled the notion ofenemy down to three big ideas. Slavery, treason, and rebellion, he argued, werethe “trio of social monsters” that must be crushed. Stridently, he called for awar that “must go on until one of the parties to it is ground to powder.” TheUnion could only win a war to destroy slavery “the longer it lasts.” In thesummer of 1861 the fire-breathing Douglass wanted “slaveholding rebels . . .starved out, broken down, overpowered, and totally exhausted, before they canconsent, after their high sounding threat, to sue for peace.” He stoked warfever with unabashed fervor, especially urging black men in his audiences to“drink as deeply in the martial spirit of the times as possible,” and tobrandish their manliness so that they might never again be “despised ascowards.” Above all, he prayed for a long war that would subject the South todevastation. “I should regret the sudden and peaceful termination of thisconflict,” Douglass proclaimed. “Now, the next best thing, if we cannot makethem [Southerners] love us, is to make them fear us.”17[notes01.html#ch17fn_17a]With these high, sanguinary aims Douglass could only find disappointment in theshort run. But in the war’s first summer he expressed a clamorous certaintyabout its meaning and purpose. The South’s cause was an evil, growing,misbegotten element of “nature” itself that had to be wiped out. Slavery and itsadvocates, manifested in huge armies, were the “foul and red-mouthed dragon”against which Northern men must now learn war in order to slay it.18[notes01.html#ch17fn_18a] In the dark art of war propaganda, thumping out frompress and pulpit all over America that summer, Douglass set the pace for theabolitionist North.If his audiences needed moral and religious justification, he was ready. “Menhave their choice in the world,” Douglass pronounced in June. “They can beangels, or they may be demons. In the apocalyptic vision, John describes a warin heaven. You have only to strip that vision of its gorgeous Oriental drapery,divest it of its shining and celestial ornaments, clothe it in the simple andfamiliar language of common sense, and you will have . . . the eternal conflictbetween right and wrong, good and evil, liberty and slavery, truth andfalsehood.” Then he tried to blend ancient biblical apocalypticism with theUnion war effort. “Michael and his angels are still contending against theinfernal host of bad passions, and excitement will last while the fightcontinues . . . till one or the other is subdued. . . . Such is the struggle nowgoing on in the United States. The slaveholders had rather reign in hell thanserve in heaven.”19 [notes01.html#ch17fn_19a] Thus did Douglass give the CivilWar a cosmic definition on the eve of the Battle of First Bull Run. In theslaughter to come, he would provide as much bloodthirsty passion as he could forthe side of the angels.• • •Douglass’s quest in 1861 to create the hated enemy of the Union cause was bothpersonal and political. The outbreak of the war allowed him to cultivate along-standing psychological need to find a real-world outlet for an innervengeance against slavery and slaveholders. He had spent the first twenty-eightyears of his life as a slave or a fugitive slave; his sense of self-definitiontook its departure from his slave origins as a child of a black mother and herwhite master. Douglass always had to begin to understand himself in the sordidbut defining story of the sexual exploitation of slave women by white men. Hewas both a reflection of the system into which he was born—a chattel formed ofboth races—and therefore, especially with his rise to intellectual fame, themost prominent contradiction of that system. Douglass had never resolved hisanger toward his masters and overseers, toward their physical abuse, but perhapsespecially about the mental oppression at the heart of slavery. He knew slaveryas a potentially total system rooted in dehumanization and violence.20[notes01.html#ch17fn_20a] He knew slaveholders had hearts and souls; but he hadalso seen and experienced their dark depravity. His body had been possessed,manipulated, and bludgeoned by a man named Covey, and his future had once beenowned and calculated by men named Auld and Anthony. Douglass understood theprimal loathing, the soul-destroying elements of inhumanity, and the lethalforce slavery required in order to survive. Slavery had also taught him a greatdeal about the uses of violence, and it had taught him how to hate.Once the bit of war propaganda lodged in his mouth, Douglass was relentless inpursuit of the enemy. He fits well into the writer Barbara Ehrenreich’scharacterization of how the war urge, once commenced, takes on a life of itsown. “However and wherever war begins,” wrote Ehrenreich, “it persists, itspreads, it propagates itself through time and across space with the terrifyingtenacity of a beast attached to the neck of living prey.” In June at SpringStreet Church, philosophizing as though he entertained a modern notion of innateaggression, Douglass dropped this telling line into the middle of his invocationof the apocalyptic vision from Revelation: “The human heart is a seat ofconstant war.” The rage at the heart of the war propaganda Douglass produced soprofusely in the Civil War stemmed less, though, from biological instinct thanfrom emotion rooted in experience and ideas.21 [notes01.html#ch17fn_21a] He hadhis own war to pursue as he also primed the pump of Northern morale.Douglass’s inner war stemmed from his desire to possess the power, the sense ofbelonging, indeed the realization of nationhood and citizenship, that white menenjoyed. And it stemmed from fantasies of revenge, the deep desire to finallythwart and then destroy the physical, mental, and political worlds slavery hadmade. One world had to end before a new one could be created. Douglass engagedin a lifelong autobiographical quest for a coherent story of ascendance andfamilial identity.22 [notes01.html#ch17fn_22a] Douglass did carry a “seat ofconstant war” in his heart, as he himself implied. But that story was much morethan the desire to comprehend his paternity, his bloodlines, and his kinfolk inMaryland. He needed revenge and redemption in blood for himself and for theafflicted generations of the people he represented. Douglass wanted slaveholdershumiliated, then eliminated, and in their wake he might find his place in adominion of human equality. To get to that distant shore, to a new America, heprobed the darkest ranges of human wrath.Douglass reveled in the war psychology exploding across the North in the summerof 1861; he did his best to cultivate the violent imagination of his readers andconvert the older notion of the Slave Power, the object of abstract fear, into ahatred of slaveholders themselves. He wanted the “high looks of the lordlyAssyrians . . . brought low.” Echoing the war poems of Walt Whitman, but withblunter edges, Douglass beat his chest for war. “Drums are beating, men areenlisting,” he wrote, “companies forming, regiments marching, banners areflying.” He imagined a united North: “People, press, and pulpit . . . areknitted together like the iron links of a coat of mail.” He held nothing back:“The cry is now for war, vigorous war, war to the bitter end, and war till thetraitors are effectually and permanently put down.” In his view no awful fatewas quite enough for the slaveholding rebels. “Let the ports of the South beblockaded,” Douglass preached; “let business there be arrested; let provisions,arms and ammunition be no longer sent there; let the grim visage of a Northernarmy confront them from one direction, a furious slave insurrection meet them atanother, and starvation threaten them from still another.” In this early visionof total war, Douglass joyously imagined a horrendous end for slaveholders. Theywere “only on the outer wave of the whirlpool of treason; every circle they nowmake will bring them nearer the centre that is certain to swallow them up, andhurl them to the bottom of its howling waters.”23 [notes01.html#ch17fn_23a] Insuch a tempest Douglass, trying to see an unknowable end from the beginning,fashioned the apocalyptic fate of the Confederacy.Image [../images/f0347-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass’s pen with inkwell, date unknown.As the war ensued, Douglass did his utmost to keep the character of slaveholdersbefore the eyes and ears of his audiences. In an assault that ran counter tomost Republican propaganda, Douglass portrayed non-slaveholding whites as mere“tools of the slaveholders.” They were “ignorant, besotted, and servile,”possessing “no opinions of their own in political affairs.” The power of themaster class was absolute. “The slaveholders are the South,” argued Douglass.“The six million of free nonslaveholding whites are but freight cars full ofcattle, attached to the three hundred and fifty thousand slaveholdinglocomotives. Where the locomotives go, the train must follow.” In peace, theSlave Power was to be feared and opposed; in war, it was the “barbarous andbloody” culture that must be liquidated.24 [notes01.html#ch17fn_24a]In June at one of his Spring Street Church lectures, Douglass demonstrated thathe believed he had found the perfect enemy. “What is a slaveholder but a rebeland a traitor?” he queried. Douglass portrayed slaveholders as inherentlydepraved, natural criminals; he wanted his listeners to equate treason withslaveowning and therefore fight to destroy both. “Southern men,” Douglassassured the assembled Rochesterites, “are all of the same species” and couldunderstand “no law but the law of force.” Douglass’s speeches were deeplypersonal illustrations of his vision of the conflict. “I want the monsterdestroyed!” he shouted from the AME pulpit, fist clenched, fire in his eyes.25[notes01.html#ch17fn_25a]Douglass envisioned the “revolution” the country now faced as “an excellentinstructor,” especially about the nature of the enemy. He saw an Americaexperiencing an epic upheaval. The drama needed a plot and direction, heroes andvillains, and Douglass possessed a ready-made narrative. The slaveholders, andtheir insatiable desires for more expansion, profits, power, and therefore morehuman chattel to achieve their aims, had overreached and brought down divinewrath and a political revolution to resist them. Douglass was fond of the Greekproverb that he employed in one of his Sunday lectures: “Whom the Gods woulddestroy they first make mad.” In editorials later in the summer he would put itother ways: “The slaveholder must be master of society, otherwise he cannot longbe master of his slaves.”26 [notes01.html#ch17fn_26a] Douglass’s greatest hopewas that a sufficiently outraged Northern people would fight to defeat thismortal enemy of humankind.By the end of the first summer of the war, though, Douglass was deeplyfrustrated with Northern public opinion, the government’s policy toward slavery,and military defeat. He was especially angry with federal insistence onreturning fugitive slaves who had escaped to Union lines, and he hoped that theUnion debacle at Bull Run in late July would teach the North harsh lessons. Thissalutary reaction to Bull Run was common among abolitionists and conservativeintellectuals alike. In defeat, Douglass wanted the North to learn the necessityof “effectively putting down the whole class of pestiferous slaveholders, sothat the nation shall know them no more, except in history, to be execrated andloathed, with all other robbers and tyrants which have cursed and ruined humansociety.”27 [notes01.html#ch17fn_27a]Throughout the first two years of the conflict, such a quest to make Yankeeshate slaveholders was a constant theme of Douglass’s war of words. In hisconception, Northerners did not comprehend the “exterminating vigor of a settledand deadly hate” with which Southerners prosecuted the war; only whenNortherners felt the same “quenchless fire of a deadly hate,” he wrote in August1861, would they find the “secret” to military success.28[notes01.html#ch17fn_28a] The South was in earnest and understood its cause,Douglass maintained, while the North did not. He equated Northern resolve withthe willingness to kill slaveholders and all that they stood for.Douglass would have to wait a long and discouraging year before he would see thewar turn decisively against slavery as well as the Confederacy. But by theautumn of 1861, he seemed certain of his own duty. This time the duty of hopewas not merely to prescribe political faith in the face of proslavery laws andinstitutions. It entailed bloodlust, and looking long and hard at a dark realityneither he nor any other Americans had ever quite seen: savage, prolonged,all-out civil war. Everything was at stake. “The dangerous and demonicalcharacter of slavery . . . we have been endeavoring to expose,” he wrote inOctober, “and to teach the nation they must hate and abolish, or be hated andabolished by it.” As massive mobilization ensued in late 1861, and as Union andConfederate armies arrayed in Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and many otherplaces, Douglass predicted a “long, revengeful, and desolating” war. Only in anunlimited war, he believed, would slavery crumble by “iron necessity,” if notfrom moral idealism. Responding to a disheartened correspondent who challengedhis optimism, he defended his sense of hope as he warned that Northerners had“not yet been sufficiently deluged with slaveholding contempt . . . not drunkdeep enough of the poisoned cup of slaveholding malignity.”29[notes01.html#ch17fn_29a] They had not yet learned to hate the foe, and Douglasssaw himself as their educator.Douglass made the most of every opportunity to instill contempt for the South.When allegations were made of atrocities by Confederate soldiers, he printed andexploited the stories. In August he recycled the story that Confederates at BullRun had “amused themselves in sticking their bayonets in the dead, and settingthe wounded up against stumps, and shooting at them as targets.” In December1861, under the heading “Signs of Barbarism,” he reported the claim thatVirginia rebels had produced candles made of the tallow from dead Yankeesoldiers. He also reprinted an account from the New York Post reporting the“distribution of the skin of Old John Brown’s son,” who had been killed inbattle. According to Douglass, these episodes demonstrated that if “left tothemselves, the Southerners would wholly barbarize under the influence ofslavery.” What moral sense they did possess, he maintained, was due only totheir “connection with the superior civilization of the North.” By 1862,Douglass portrayed slaveholders as barbarians. “Digging up the bones of our deadsoldiers slain in battle, making drinking vessels out of their skulls,drumsticks out of their arm bones, slaying our wounded soldiers on the field ofcarnage” were only some of the wild accusations Douglass flung at Southerners.For Union military success a “deadly hatred” of all things born of aslaveholding society would have to be engendered in the hearts and minds ofNortherners.30 [notes01.html#ch17fn_30a]Although they seem vicious and even simplistic, Douglass’s appeals for hatred ofthe South fit his apocalyptic conception of the war. God’s retribution was atthe heart of millennial expectations in the nineteenth century. Evil was to beeradicated through great calamity; a new age of peace and justice might thenfollow. But millennialism was an activist faith; the overturning of a societydepended greatly on human action. Douglass’s own sense of revenge againstslaveholders came unleashed; as he passionately vented a long-pent-up desire forrighteous violence in the cause of abolition, he felt freed to advocate thedeath of every Edward Covey in the South. Thus hatred provided a creative force.Douglass envisioned a war that might be enduring and tragic, but also cleansing.Hatred of slaveholders, therefore, had great purgative power—for one human heartor for millions—and an appointed role in America’s Armageddon.31[notes01.html#ch17fn_31a]• • •By late summer and into the fall of 1861, Douglass found himself frustrated asthe Union armies and the Lincoln administration seemed determined not to makewar on slavery, nor to liberate slaves who sought refuge behind Union lines, andespecially not to accept black men into military service. Without knowing yetjust what large armies could do to each other, nor the character of thedestruction that rifled muskets and cannon could exact en masse on human bodies,Douglass ached in July for real war to begin. “We know that rebellion cannot betalked down, written down, or coaxed down,” he asserted with relish. “It has gotto be beaten down. . . . There is no whipping the traitors without hurting them.War was made to hurt, and those who provoke it ought to be hurt; and the onlyconceivable good which can come out of war, comes because it hurts.”32[notes01.html#ch17fn_32a]But Douglass had left his keenly interested British correspondent Julia Croftsin a lurch of inadequate information. “It was in the railway carriage,” shereported, “while coming from Edinburgh, that the sounds, ‘Defeat of theFederals,’ ‘Bull Run,’ ‘Manassas Junction,’ first met my ears.” Julia felt“shame” in hearing the gentlemen on her train express joy that the Union“cowards had been defeated,” as she beseeched Douglass to provide the “numbersreally killed.” She could only send her heartfelt wish that “every coloredfamily” in the Northern states would cross into Canada and live “shelteredbeneath the British flag.” Desperate, Julia then broke into a typicallyreligious exhortation: “God reigns in Eternity. We know and feel that He willoverrule all this confusion, this wrath of men and clang of arms, for the finaldeliverance of the poor bondsmen . . . out of the prison-houses surely as Hebrought the children of Israel out of Egypt.”33 [notes01.html#ch17fn_33a] Juliahad read her Douglass and knew something of her friend’s views on how suchassurances marched with confusion, wrath, and war. And he surely tookreassurance from her words.Before the war reached its second month, some slaves found their way into Unionlines around the rim of Southern war fronts and were famously labeled“contrabands of war” at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, by Union general BenjaminButler. The idea of escaped slaves as confiscated enemy property caught on inthe Northern imagination, and a new word entered the national lexicon. For mostof 1861, federal military policy about slavery, however, evolved in anincoherent, topsy-turvy manner, sometimes ordering Union officers to returnfugitive slaves to their owners and sometimes protecting and liberating thegrowing waves of runaways. In his paper, Douglass reprinted the leakedcorrespondence from Secretary of War Simon Cameron to Butler, informing thegeneral that his bold order was “approved,” although the actual “finaldetermination” of the freedmen’s legal status would be left for the future.Officially, the Lincoln administration avoided measures that might lead to anywholesale emancipation, fearing that the four border slave states, especiallyKentucky, might join the Confederacy otherwise, and therefore sought to restorethe Union without enlisting black soldiers or making a revolutionary assault onslavery itself.34 [notes01.html#ch17fn_34a]Throughout the war’s first year, these two profound issues—the status offugitive slaves and the prospect of black enlistment in the military—dominatedDouglass’s mind and, therefore, his journalism. He was hardly alone. It seemedthat everyone across the Northern press and in political circles was talkingabout the “contrabands”; even poets and songwriters appropriated the newconcept. From the opening months of the war Douglass argued vehemently for therecruitment of black troops. Borrowing language from Old Brown, he demanded a“liberating army” of “slaves and free colored people . . . carrying the war intoAfrica.” His war fever surging, Douglass proclaimed that symbolically “one blackregiment alone would be, in such a war, the full equal of two white ones” andteach the slaves themselves “more . . . than a thousand preachers.”35[notes01.html#ch17fn_35a]Earlier in the war than most scholars may realize, Northern journalists and buckprivates alike began to ponder how emancipation might become a “militarynecessity” for the Union cause. On June 15, 1861, the Chicago Tribune spoke formany mainstream newspapers in concluding, “If the war continues one year ormore, ‘what will we do with the slaves?’ will . . . become the question of theday.” Douglass agreed entirely, but hardly with the patience and dispatch of areporter. His was the moral zeal of militant activism, although he put his faithin events as much as people. “Though it is generally true,” he wrote in August,“that governments move only as they are moved upon by the people, they dosometimes find themselves moved by events which they cannot control.”36[notes01.html#ch17fn_36a] In this instance, Douglass was painfully prophetic innaming the problem at the heart of the strife engulfing the country.From the beginning of secession Douglass had called the crisis the“slaveholders’ rebellion.” Since Fort Sumter he had called for an “abolitionwar,” and nothing short of it. When we consider his impatience with the Lincolnadministration’s halting, and sometimes hostile, approach to emancipation, it isworth contemplating the lens through which Douglass judged the war’s purpose. InAugust, Douglass righteously claimed that “everyone knows that this is theslaveholders’ rebellion and nothing else.” The war, he said, was the work of a“privileged class of irresponsible despots, authorized tyrants andblood-suckers, who fasten upon the Negro’s flesh, and draw political power andconsequence from their legalized crimes.” It is against that rhetoricalbackground that we should understand Douglass’s response to the mostcontroversial issue of late 1861 in the Northern war effort. On August 30,General John C. Frémont, commanding Union forces in Missouri, then racked withchaos and outbreaks of guerrilla war, declared martial law, ordering the summaryexecutions of rebels, confiscation of their property, and most important,emancipation of the slaves of Confederates. Frémont acted without authorizationfrom Lincoln or any higher military command, although with tumultuous approvalamong abolitionists. President Lincoln, to sustain civilian control of themilitary and especially sensitive to keeping Kentucky securely in the Union,promptly revoked Frémont’s declaration and eventually removed him fromcommand.37 [notes01.html#ch17fn_37a]Infuriated, Douglass struck with rhetorical vengeance against Lincoln’srevocation of Frémont’s emancipation edict. Throughout the autumn, joining achorus of abolitionists, he made a heroic figure out of the inept Frémont, and asymbol of the emancipation edict. He argued that the general had been sacrificedto appease the proslavery sentiment of the border states and because ofLincoln’s constitutional conservatism. Not without reason, historian James Oakesportrays Douglass’s reactions to the Frémont affair as an example of theabolitionist’s “sourest invective” against Lincoln’s caution. Oakes callsDouglass “myopic” in his impatience with federal policy, and a “flexibledogmatist” who simply refused to grasp the burdens and imperatives of apresident conducting a civil war. Fair enough. But Douglass’s priorities andaims were not the same as Lincoln’s. And Douglass’s impatience drew upon theblood of untold millions of the enslaved, not on the question of constitutionalauthority. Lincoln had to consider public opinion at every turn in the story ofemancipation; Douglass’s goal, as it had always been, was to bend and shape thatopinion toward just the kind of revolution and conflict Frémont had touched offin Missouri. Douglass’s scornfulness and disdain for legalism were a duty, justas Lincoln possessed a profound duty to try to navigate uncharted constitutionalwaters. Lincoln had to worry about voters; Douglass wanted slaveholders’“rights” and their armies crushed in order to educate a new generation ofantislavery voters.38 [notes01.html#ch17fn_38a]If the conflict was ever to truly be an abolition war, and if slavery was, asDouglass frequently claimed, the “stomach of the rebellion,” then in his viewthe border states, rather than being crucial and sensitive allies, were the“millstone around the neck of the government.” Who needs “such friendship,”Douglass argued, when it only serves as a “shield to the treason of the cottonstates?” He engaged in faulty strategic thinking, but good abolitionistpolitics. Douglass spewed even more scorn on Lincoln’s constitutional restraintabout property rights: “As if this were a time to talk of constitutional power!”Douglass exhorted. He wanted Lincoln to seize the “war power” and use it as a“moral” weapon. Douglass’s invective became ugly in October. He characterizedLincoln’s thwarting of Frémont as a sign of “weakness, imbecility, andabsurdity.” Douglass had hoped Frémont’s order might be “the hinge . . . uponwhich the character of the war was to turn.” Instead, the “cunningtechnicalities of the crafty lawyer” won out over “the cannon and courage of thedetermined warrior.”39 [notes01.html#ch17fn_39a]No one knew the future in this terrible war. Timing mattered, but no one shouldhave expected patience from Douglass or any other radical abolitionist. He couldnot have known about the remarkable private remark Lincoln made that fall aboutthe attitudes of the radicals. Abolitionists, said Lincoln, “would upset ourapplecart” if they “had their way.” “We’ll fetch ’em [slaves],” the president isreported to have said, “just give us a little time. We didn’t go into this warto put down slavery, but to put the flag back . . . for I never should have hadvotes enough to send me here if the people had supposed I would use my power toupset slavery. . . . We must wait until every other means have been exhausted.This thunderbolt will wait.” Likewise in December, Lincoln and his aidesprobably did not read the passage embedded in one of Douglass’s editorials onthe Frémont affair. After saying that the general’s proclamation would never beforgotten, and declaring the war part of a design that would ultimately succeed,Douglass, liberally wielding italics, dropped this prediction into the mix: “Inthree years more the people will sanction the death of slavery in the man oftheir choice. And too, this unnatural war will render its deathconstitutional.”40 [notes01.html#ch17fn_40a] From their own peculiardispositions, both men saw the thunder coming in 1862 and beyond.But Douglass could not yet hear the thunder. Lincoln had moved in quiet andsmall ways to authorize emancipation and even the beginnings of black militaryservice in 1861, but Douglass did not know it. The president had grudginglysupported the First Confiscation Act, passed by Congress in August, whichincluded slaves in the property that Union troops could seize from Confederates.The freedom of such persons was not yet legally determined, but this was animportant beginning.41 [notes01.html#ch17fn_41a]In his first annual message to Congress, submitted December 3, 1861, Lincoln,with rigid caution, reiterated his pledge to protect the slave property of“loyal” Southerners. He expressed solicitude toward the four border states tokeep them in the Union. Most important in Douglass’s mind, Lincolndiscouragingly began to lay out a “plan of colonization” for any slavesliberated in the growing war, an issue the editor would take up with greatvehemence in the coming year. He could not have been surprised to see Lincolndeclare once again “the integrity of the Union” to be the primary goal of thewar. But perhaps nothing sank Douglass’s heart as much as when he read thepresident’s famous statement of how “anxious and careful” he had been that thewar “shall not degenerate into a violent and remorseless revolutionarystruggle.” Lincoln received heavy criticism for the caution in his annualmessage from parts of the North. The Illinois senator Lyman Trumbull, a closefriend of the president’s, received many constituent letters protesting thatLincoln’s address contained no battle cry for the Union war effort. Douglasswanted precisely the revolutionary struggle that Lincoln did not at this stagewant, and Douglass was more than ready to provide the battle cry roaring in theears of all who would listen. To one of his own readers, eager for hope,Douglass pointed to the “higher law” at work overturning constitutionalrestraint, and to the “mighty current” moving the war toward radical ends. “Keeppounding on the rock,” Douglass prescribed, and listen for the thunder.42[notes01.html#ch17fn_42a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 18--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THE ANTHEM OF THE REDEEMEDIt is difficult for us who have toiled so long and hard, to believe that thisevent, so stupendous, so far reaching and glorious is even at the door.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, ROCHESTER, DECEMBER 28, 1862On Sunday, December 28, 1862, after hundreds of thousands of words, nearly asmany backbreaking miles traveled, and twenty-one months of bloody civil war,Frederick Douglass stepped to the familiar pulpit of Spring Street AME ZionChurch in Rochester and uttered a remarkable paragraph. In words and sentimentshe had dreamed of saying for most of his nearly forty-three years, the striking,well-attired orator with the graying streak swooshed over the right side of hishair began almost plaintively, declaring it “scarcely a day for prose.” Offeringno apologetics for garnering the congregation’s time and attention, Douglasssummoned the old dream into the church sanctuary and invested his audience in amoment they might never forget. “It is a day for poetry and song, a new song,”said the preacher. Then he delivered a piece of prose poetry he had stored upinside since his first time in an AME Zion pulpit twenty-three years earlier inNew Bedford. “These cloudless skies, this balmy air, this brilliant sunshine(making December as pleasant as May), are in harmony with the glorious morningof liberty about to dawn upon us.”1 [notes01.html#ch18fn_1a]Eyes must have welled up in the pews among black and white abolitionistRochester, as Douglass captured their feelings. “Out of a full heart and sacredemotion, I congratulate you my friends, and fellow citizens, on the high andhopeful condition, of the cause of human freedom and the cause of our commoncountry, for these two causes are now one and inseparable and must stand or falltogether.” It had not yet officially happened, but Douglass offered his own kindof prayer of assurance, as the faithful kept watch for the day of Jubilee. “Thissacred Sunday in all the likelihoods of the case, is the last which will witnessthe existence of legal slavery in all the Rebel slaveholding States of America.”Then he folded some Lincolnesque legal phrasing into an old abolitionist standbydrawn from John Wesley, while landing a direct blow on Roger B. Taney of DredScott case infamy: “Henceforth and forever, slavery in those States is to berecognized, by all the departments of the American government, under itsappropriate character, as an unmitigated robber and pirate, branded as the sumof all villainy, an outlaw having no rights which any man white or colored isbound to respect.” Taking a breath, and perhaps choking down his own emotion,Douglass finished the opening of his praise song: “It is difficult for us whohave toiled so long and hard, to believe that this event, so stupendous, so farreaching and glorious is even now at the door. It surpasses our mostenthusiastic hopes that we live at such a time and are likely to witness thedownfall, at least the legal downfall, of slavery in America.” As thecongregation nodded with recognition, he concluded, “It is a moment for joy,thanksgiving, and Praise.”2 [notes01.html#ch18fn_2a] The following day Douglassboarded a train for Boston to join in a special gathering that would keep watchfor the word.Image [../images/f0356-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, January 14, 1862. John WhiteHurn photographer, carte de visite.• • •The road to such anticipated joy about emancipation was crooked, bloody, and attimes laden with blind curves. In mid-November 1861 in Syracuse, New York,Douglass encountered threats of a lynch mob. Before his scheduled two-speechbilling, potential assassins had flooded the town with handbills announcing,“NIGGER FRED COMING,” calling the orator among other epithets “a reviler of theConstitution . . . a Thief! Rascal! and Traitor!” The handbills called on peopleto “rally” and give Douglass a “warm reception.” Due to the quick work of themayor and local sheriff, who called on seventy police and some forty-five youngtroops from the nearby army camp, no violence occurred, and Douglass, guarded bysoldiers with loaded muskets, spoke for well over an hour on the causes of therebellion before eight hundred people. Douglass thanked his protectors as heacknowledged a historical moment when “the mob howls, and slavery with bloodyhands is throttling the liberties of the nation.”3 [notes01.html#ch18fn_3a]Violence dominated everyone’s mind. In the year and nine months leading up toAbraham Lincoln’s signing the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863,approximately 270,000 Union soldiers and sailors and 212,000 Confederates haddied or were wounded in the Civil War at heretofore unknown places called FortDonelson, Shiloh, Seven Pines, Malvern Hill, Cedar Mountain, Manassas Junction,Antietam, or Marye’s Heights at Fredericksburg. Such scale of sacrifice had beenunthinkable in 1860, but now it occupied the daily consciousness of mostAmericans. The long war Douglass desired was under way. By spring 1862, hedeclared the conflict “no longer a short war either in fact or in imagination,but one the end of which is away off in the dark and misty future.” Written inblood, the very nature of the war transformed. A rising tide of African Americanslaves kept testing every battlefront, waterway, or Union army outpost to seektheir freedom. Douglass scoured newspapers for news, and in December 1861 hereprinted more than a dozen accounts of daring escapes by “contrabands” in warzones. Far from docile, slaves were alert and aggressive. “The Negroes at theSouth,” he wrote, “are shown to be as keenly alive to the events going on aboutthem as the majority of their masters, and quite ready to take their freedom inany way that is presented to them.” Any way indeed. Uncounted numbers offreedpeople were dying or suffering with disease in contraband camps all aroundthe perimeter of the South. The Jubilee had arrived, forged by bravery andthrough fear and loss, well before it was signed into law.4[notes01.html#ch18fn_4a]From 1861 to 1863, Douglass devoted his daily labors to fomenting an “abolitionwar.” Along with other abolitionists, Douglass passed through many valleys offear and confusion before they ever found a “sacred Sunday” such as the one hedescribed in December 1862. Indeed, one year earlier, he and Gerrit Smith hadexchanged depressing letters. Douglass despaired “of finding any sound placeupon which to build a hope of national salvation. I am bewildered by thespectacle of moral blindness . . . and helpless imbecility which the Governmentof Lincoln presents. Is there hope?” Three days later, Smith replied by sending$10 to “sustain your paper,” but remarking in somber tones, “I cannot get rid ofthe impression that our country is lost.”5 [notes01.html#ch18fn_5a] The two menfelt especially discouraged by the Lincoln administration’s embroilment in theTrent Affair, a diplomatic standoff between Great Britain and the United States.The primary aim of Confederate diplomacy was to secure European and especiallyBritish recognition and, if possible, intervention on their behalf. InSeptember, the Confederate government appointed James Mason of Virginia and JohnSlidell of Louisiana as ministers plenipotentiary to Britain and Francerespectively. The two slipped through the Union blockade. But when they stoppedin the harbor of Havana, Cuba, to switch to a British ship, the Trent, they wereseized as “contraband of war.” The capture quickly became a diplomatic crisis.The London government cried foul, and Prime Minister Palmerston ordered troopsto Canada, strengthened the British Atlantic fleet, and sent an ultimatum to theLincoln administration demanding an apology and the release of the Confederateenvoys. After much saber rattling on both sides, the United States saved face onDecember 25, 1861, by allowing Mason and Slidell to continue on to the foreigncapitals.6 [notes01.html#ch18fn_6a]In the midst of this crisis, Julia Crofts wrote from England in a state of greatfear over her native country’s “probable war with America.” Everyone but the“cotton party,” she wrote, “shudders at the thought.” If war with Britainhappened, she urged Douglass to “cross the frontier with all your household &edit your paper at Toronto.” After many weeks of these tensions, Douglasscomplained of “confusion and contradiction” in Washington. He thought the TrentAffair another measure of the “hesitating, doubting, shrinking” approach ofLincoln’s government to the real issue of fighting slavery. “Our honor cannotrequire England’s dishonor,” wrote Douglass the Anglophile.7[notes01.html#ch18fn_7a] Above all, Douglass wanted to prevent Britishintervention and to enlist English abolitionists in the crusade to end slavery.• • •Wartime heightens anxiety as it also alters conceptions of time itself, not onlyfor combatants but for civilians, who must follow its every desperate surge ordrought of news. In particular, 1862 was just such a year; little would ever bethe same again. War possesses an awful logic and causes a psychic drama like fewother human experiences. The direction and tide of the Civil War could changewith any military success or failure. As Douglass said at the beginning of theyear, “But a single day, but a single event may change the whole prospect. Letus, therefore, hope for that day, and continue to labor for that event.”8[notes01.html#ch18fn_8a] His mood swings in 1862 were like recurringearthquakes, some destructive and others reordering the landscape withastonishing new hope.Douglass did not find it easy to follow his friend Julia Crofts’s prescriptionfor their mutual frustration about the war: “While we labor for the redemptionof the bondman, we must learn also to wait.” They shared a faith in an activistDivine Providence, but not in Christian fatalism. During a midwinter lull infighting, he complained bitterly of the many months the Army of the Potomacunder the command of General George B. McClellan lay “idle” around Washington,DC. Six months of reading every morning that it was “all quiet on the Potomac”was enough, said the angry editor, “to exhaust the patience of Job.” Douglassvigorously protested against McClellan’s dismissal of the Hutchinson FamilySingers from his camps for singing abolitionist songs. Douglass expresseddefeatism in February 1862. The “stand-still, do-nothing policy” of Lincoln’sgovernment led Douglass to accuse the administration and its military team of“treason or . . . utter incompetency.” Only a robust effort to defeatslaveholders, he believed, could prevent the rebels from winning theirindependence once the armies moved in the spring.9 [notes01.html#ch18fn_9a]Douglass delivered two major speeches that winter, one in Philadelphia inJanuary and the other a month later in Boston. Both laid out his apocalypticvision of the war. In both speeches, as well as in many editorials in the firsthalf of 1862, Douglass asserted the case for black loyalty, for the recruitmentof black troops, as he also vigorously denounced all colonization schemesemerging from the Lincoln administration. Exasperated by the slow pace of thewar, Douglass offered many ideas about how to make the bloodletting meaningfuland holy.“I am to speak to you tonight of the civil war,” Douglass announced to hisPhiladelphia audience in National Hall, “by which this vast country—thiscontinent is convulsed.” Nations, like individuals, the orator maintained,receive divine warnings that they must either heed or face destruction.Americans were being “taught” in this war “as with the emphasis of anearthquake.” Their warning arrived “not in comets blazing through the troubledsky, but in the terrible calamity of a widespread rebellion enacted before oureyes.” Douglass spoke glowingly at first of the American republic as a “youngnation,” giving it personal qualities—“great in mental, moral and physicalresources.” But any nation, like a person, must suffer, fall, and reform.Drawing on Hamlet’s lament, Douglass observed that “the face of every loyalcitizen is sicklied over with the pale cast of thought. Every pillar in thenational temple is shaken. The nation itself has fallen asunder in the centre.”Douglass himself pulled with all his might now to make those pillars fall.Slavery’s poisoning of the national character, he contended, threateneddestruction more than the Confederate armies. Lacing his narrative withScripture, Douglass proclaimed, “We have faithfully copied all the cunning ofthe serpent without any of the harmlessness of the dove, or the boldness of thelion.” Drawing deep from his favorite well, Douglass observed, “It would seem inthe language of Isaiah that the whole head is sick, and the whole heart isfaint, that there is no soundness in it.”10 [notes01.html#ch18fn_10a] With theold prophets as guides, Douglass watched the American temple destroyed so thatit might be reinvented.Image [../images/f0360-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass’s Bible.Glimmers of hope emerged from the Congress and the White House that spring. Butfirst Douglass had to make the argument for why this was a black American’s war.In 1862, Douglass proffered a wide-ranging discussion of the loyalty of hispeople. He made effective use of the idea of black loyalty, whether speaking inhis role as an abolitionist or that of a war propagandist. “I believe up to thistime,” Douglass said in February, “no man . . . has been able to cast a shadowof a doubt upon the loyalty and patriotism of the free colored people in thisthe hour of the nation’s trial and danger.” But he was bitter that the federalgovernment had spurned the service of black loyalists. “The WashingtonGovernment wants men for its army, but thus far, it has not had the boldness torecognize the manhood of the race to which I belong.”11[notes01.html#ch18fn_11a] The orator wanted black patriotism acknowledged in allits forms.Douglass believed American history and character were essentially the embodimentof contradiction. “He is the best friend of this country,” said Douglass inearly 1862, “who, at this tremendous crisis, dares tell his countrymen thetruth, however disagreeable that truth may be; and such a friend I will aim tobe.” He had taken such a position on patriotism since his days as a Garrisonian.“I will hold up America to the lightning scorn of moral indignation,” he said inan 1847 speech. “In doing this I shall feel myself discharging the duty of atrue patriot; for he is the lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuseits sins.” Douglass could be included among those Americans the moderntheologian Donald W. Shriver Jr. has called “honest patriots,” those whomanifest an ironic-tragic love of country by learning, narrating, and workingthrough its past of contradiction and evil, and not by evading it.12[notes01.html#ch18fn_12a]Upon this philosophical basis Douglass built his case for black patriotism aswell as for revolutionary change. He had more confidence in “Southern villainy”than in “Northern virtue.” He believed the Union side had two classes ofloyalists. The two “talk alike,” he told his Boston audience in February. But“one class is for putting down the rebellion . . . by force and force alone, andwithout abolishing slavery, and the other is for putting down the rebellion byputting down slavery on every rod of earth which shall be made sacred by thefootprints of a single loyal soldier. . . . One class would strike down theeffect, the other would strike at the cause.” Unmistakably, Douglass equatedtrue loyalty and patriotism with abolitionism, an ironic, if vexing, notionamong a white population that increasingly believed slavery had to be killed of“necessity” to win the war.13 [notes01.html#ch18fn_13a]Douglass constantly professed his own loyalty. “I allow no man to exceed me inthe desire for the safety and welfare of this country,” he pronounced in Boston.He called the Union the “shield” protecting Americans from “treason, rebellionand anarchy.” He asserted his sense of birthright: “I am an American citizen. Inbirth, in sentiment, in ideas, in hopes, in aspirations, and responsibilities, Iam an American citizen.” Then he stated the collective case for free blacks,linking loyalty with military service. Blacks had demonstrated the “most ardentdesire to serve the cause,” only to be met with rejection at recruitingstations. “Colored men were good enough to fight under Washington,” Douglasswrote. “They are not good enough to fight under McClellan.”14[notes01.html#ch18fn_14a] Against all odds, Douglass staked his case on theloyalty of potential black soldiers.But Douglass was equally fond of demonstrating the perseverance of loyalty amongblack civilians. “The Negro is the veritable Mark Tapley of this country,” hewrote in July, referring to the amiable character in Charles Dickens’s savagelycomic Martin Chuzzlewit. “That most obliging good tempered character . . . wasnot more determined to be jolly under severely unfavorable circumstances, thanthe Negro is to ‘come out strong’ in patriotism under every possiblediscouragement.” Douglass’s reference to Dickens’s Mark Tapley is particularlyintriguing. It reflects more than his affinity for Dickens; Tapley is the“jolly” but serious voice of the downtrodden, as well as a critic of his owncountry’s hypocrisies and faults, especially slavery.15[notes01.html#ch18fn_15a]For Douglass, who himself became a master of sarcasm and irony in the face ofthe absurdity of slavery and racism, Dickens was a vivid model. MartinChuzzlewit is Dickens’s novel written after his disappointing visit to theUnited States in 1843, in which he spared America none of its pretensions andevils, especially the lies at the root of slaveholding. It is the jovial Tapleywho captures the meaning of the selling of the daughter of an elderly black mannamed Cicero: “Lord, love you sir, they’re so fond of liberty in this part ofthe globe, that they buy her and sell her and carry her to market with ’em.They’ve such a passion for Liberty, that they can’t help taking liberties withher.” Bitingly, Tapley cries: “Liberty forever. Hurrah! Hail Columbia!” Tenyears before emancipation, a Dickens-inspired attitude toward absurdity may havefueled Douglass’s famous call in his greatest speech for “scorching irony . . .biting ridicule . . . [and] withering sarcasm” after asking: “Would you have meargue that man is entitled to liberty?”16 [notes01.html#ch18fn_16a]Loyalty and patriotism are tortured concepts in time of war. For Douglass in1862–63, loyalty was both an aspiration and a pragmatic device for the warpropagandist. A yearning to belong might yet be combined with the right to fightin a cause blacks could view as their own.• • •From the beginning of the war, Abraham Lincoln faced the increasingly dominantquestion of slavery. The Republican-controlled Congress began to act with, andsometimes before, the president in 1862. Lincoln had always hated slavery andwished it somehow destroyed. But he was very much a constitutionalist workingwithin what he viewed as the restraints of his legal power as commander inchief. Moreover, Lincoln had always been a Henry Clay Whig. His instinctive andideological approach to slavery’s ultimate demise derived from three ideas: thatemancipation ought to be gradual, compensated, and ultimately result in thecolonization of as many blacks as possible outside the United States.17[notes01.html#ch18fn_17a]Lincoln’s temperament, as well as this set of deeply honed political instincts,racial views, and strategies, collided head-on in historic proportions withincreasingly all-out war. Lincoln began to think constantly about slavery byearly 1862, and in March he began to act. Until then, Lincoln’s approach toslavery had emerged as an assortment of floating ideas and incoherent policies.But he possessed a remarkable capacity to adapt, grow, and change on this mostcrucial question. On March 6, the president sent a message to Congressrecommending that it authorize funding for gradual and compensated emancipationfor the border slave states still in the Union. He stressed that this wouldmerely be an initiation of a “gradual and not sudden” process and stated that hewould not threaten slave property “within state limits,” meaning in theConfederacy. The message was subject to the “free choice” of those northernmostborder states, who might, if they accepted, send a signal to the seceded statesto the south that they would never join them. In unveiled language, Lincolndeclared it “impossible to foresee” what further consequences the war wouldbring for slavery and the South if it continued.18 [notes01.html#ch18fn_18a]Abolitionists responded with surprise and enthusiasm to Lincoln’s message.Wendell Phillips called it “unexpected as a thunderbolt in a clear sky.” AndDouglass breathed a new tone. “It is really wonderful,” he said by April 1862,“how all efforts to evade, postpone, and prevent its [emancipation] coming havebeen mocked and defied by the stupendous sweep of events.” Douglass rejoicedthat he had lived to “see the President of the United States deliberatelyadvocating emancipation.” Above all, Douglass captured the future irony ofLincoln’s move: “Time and practice will improve the President as they improveother men. He is tall and strong, but he is not done growing; he grows as thenation grows.” In a flourish of hope in a Rochester speech, Douglass warmed upto Lincoln for the moment; the president was now “an honest patriot endeavoringto save his country in its day of peril.” The March message, however nuanced,fell as “the brick knocked down at the end of the row by which the whole line isprostrate.”19 [notes01.html#ch18fn_19a]Lincoln tried assiduously to convince border-state congressmen and specialdelegations to accept his offer of gradual, compensated emancipation, but to noavail. Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, and even Delaware, with its small number ofslaves, officially resisted abolition. The most telling response Lincoln and hisadministration received to these overtures was that virtually all border-stateofficials strongly supported colonization. If the war by its force and logic didcause the liberation of some slaves, border politicians wanted the government toprovide for removal of free blacks from the country.20 [notes01.html#ch18fn_20a]A huge fight on that issue loomed on the immediate horizon, as in April anotherbrick was about to fall.From mid-March to early April, Congress fiercely debated a measure to emancipatethe thirty-two hundred slaves in the District of Columbia, where the federalgovernment held jurisdiction. The roiling debate in both houses centered on thecapacities of black people to cope with freedom, and what was to be done withthem after emancipation. In the end, all Republicans voted for the bill, and allbut four Northern Democrats voted against it, a prelude to many further fightsto come. The measure provided $300 per slave in compensation to slaveholders, aswell as $100,000 for schemes of colonization in the wake of abolition in theDistrict. After much consternation, Lincoln signed the bill on April 16.Douglass rejoiced, although he hated the colonization provisions in theemancipation bill. Even before passage, he wrote to Charles Sumner, who hadgained close access to the president, thanking him for his efforts. “I trust Iam not dreaming,” Douglass said, “but the events taking place seem like adream.”21 [notes01.html#ch18fn_21a] As each brick in a row fell, some moreeasily than others, Douglass measured progress as he tempered his own emotions.The federal treasury paid out approximately $900,000 to slaveholders in theDistrict, who lined up to receive their checks. To assess the value of slaves,the government employed a Baltimore slave trader for advice. Despite all theseacknowledgments of slaves as “property,” and the white supremacy expressed in somuch of the legislative debate, for the first time in history a federal statutegave freedom to slaves. In June, in yet another thoroughly partisan enactment,Congress ended slavery in all western territories. Few slaves actually livedthere, but the measure possessed great symbolic significance given the issue’scentrality to so much of American political history. Finally, by July, afterprotracted, embittered debate over unprecedented constitutional questions aboutthe authority to liberate slaves or employ black soldiers, Congress passed andthen Lincoln signed the Second Confiscation Act. On July 12, Lincoln made onelast-ditch effort to persuade a large delegation of border-state representativesto initiate gradual, compensated emancipation in their states. The presidentlectured the delegates gathered at the White House, arguing that the war wouldin time erode and eliminate slavery by “mere friction and abrasion.” But theborder representatives’ steadfast rejections once again pushed Lincoln to moreradical action.22 [notes01.html#ch18fn_22a]For many months, pressure had precipitously risen for action against slavery asa “military necessity,” a phrase used widely all over the North. Douglassapplauded this change in Northern sentiment. “Tens of thousands” were “nowhaving the scales torn from their eyes,” he said. “The result will be nearly thesame to the slave, if from motives of necessity or any other motives the nationshall be led to the extinction of slavery.”23 [notes01.html#ch18fn_23a]Attacking slavery became increasingly popular to large numbers of Northerners asa means of defeating the Confederacy. Lincoln’s conception of his war powerschanged as he faced the potential of General McClellan’s colossal defeat in thePeninsula Campaign in Virginia. The general’s ambitious plan to take Richmondfrom the east ended disastrously at the Battle of the Seven Days in late Juneand early July. Lincoln faced a Confederate invasion of Northern soil bymidsummer 1862. The war had escalated into a bloody multifront crusade on bothsides; the pillars of the temple were falling, as Douglass wished, but the Unioncause required revolutionary measures in order to win.The Confiscation Act was just such a measure; it freed all slaves of disloyalowners in Confederate territory occupied by Union forces, as well as any slavesescaping to Union lines. The law further authorized the president to employblacks as he deemed “necessary and proper for the suppression of the rebellion.”It also suggested that as many blacks as were willing should be colonized “insome tropical country.” Fraught with contradiction, the Second Confiscation Actnevertheless meant, as the antislavery Springfield Republican put it, that“every victory [by Union forces] is a victory for emancipation.”24[notes01.html#ch18fn_24a]Douglass worried as he watched and alternately cheered or denounced thishistoric process. In March 1862 he reported on a lecture tour just completed ofmore than a thousand miles, speaking to “tens of thousands of people,” throughmany towns in the states of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey. Hedescribed himself as encouraged by his audiences, and by conversations along theway. “The popular ear is open, and the popular heart is everywhere sensitive toimpression,” he announced. The same month, Douglass wrote a long piece, “TheSituation of the War,” in which he listed every military engagement in the firstyear of the war, celebrated the recent Union victories at Forts Henry andDonelson in Tennessee, and prematurely declared “failure . . . plainly writtenon the rebellion as a military power.” Douglass did not yet fully grasp militarycampaigns, their logistics and results on the ground, thus leading him to rashstatements sometimes laced with confused political sentiments. He accuratelypredicted worse fighting to come as spring offensives commenced. He still fearedpolitical compromise with slavery that might yet arise from the Lincolnadministration, as well as “weak and treacherous magnanimity” on the part ofsome Union generals who refused to fight a relentless war. In awkwardly chosenwords, Douglass wrote, “The North has been angry with the South only as a childis angry with a pet, and that anger soon passes away when the pet has been wellkicked.” After the horrifyingly bloody battle of Shiloh in southwest Tennesseeon April 6–7, with its twenty thousand killed and wounded on both sides, heneeded more chastened and graceful language to describe the Union war effort.25[notes01.html#ch18fn_25a]As the bloody summer of 1862 dragged on, Douglass followed every developmentfrom Rochester and from the speakers’ circuit. He was at first thrilled with theSecond Confiscation Act, reprinting its primary emancipation provisions, butthen declared it “significant or insignificant only as the President himselfshall determine.” He also reprinted in full Lincoln’s formal exchange from Julywith the border-state congressmen. Douglass’s heart sank as he read thepresident’s forthright final appeal for gradual and compensated abolition in thefour states to be followed by some degree of black removal. Such an appeal wasespecially unnerving given the historical precedent of Indian removalaccomplished a quarter century earlier. “How much better to do it while we can,”Lincoln had said, “lest the war ere long render us pecuniarily unable to do it.How much better for you, as seller, and the nation as buyer, to sell out and buyout that without which the war could never have been, than to sink both thething to be sold and the price of it in cutting one another’s throats.” Afterthis business advice about how and when to profit from their slaves, Lincolnappealed to the one issue that would animate and anger Douglass the most. “Roomin South America for colonization can be obtained cheaply and in abundance,” thechief executive lectured his recalcitrant guests, “and when numbers shall belarge enough . . . the freed people will not be so reluctant to go.”26[notes01.html#ch18fn_26a] Douglass would soon be lecturing the president aboutjust how much he should presume to know the intentions and spirits of blackpeople for leaving their own country to satisfy the demands of white supremacy.• • •On June 18, 1862, Julia Crofts wrote to Douglass from London, parroting backsome striking sentiments she had just read in her old friend’s voice in thecurrent issue of his paper: “Oh! why will the Government trumpet give anuncertain sound?” Overcome by tears after hearing for the first time the singingof the “John Brown” song in England, she wished that the next Fourth of July, inher former coeditor’s words, “might witness a glorious declaration of Liberty tothe captive, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound!”27[notes01.html#ch18fn_27a] By the time Douglass printed that letter, he hadindeed crafted another major July Fourth address.Early on the morning of July 4, Douglass took the Elmira and CanandaiguaRailroad from Rochester southeast approximately sixty miles to a tiny towncalled Himrods Corners, New York. Arriving at the sleepy village located betweenKeuka and Seneca Lakes, some eight miles south of Penn Yan, Douglass stepped offthe cars and “found no one to receive” him. So he simply started walking untilhe encountered someone who could take him to his hosts. Soon this littlesettlement of “two taverns, one church, six neat little cottages, one store,”and a “pile of sawed wood” began to transform for celebration. By late morning,Douglass saw the Star-Spangled Banner flying from many a liberty pole, andbefore long, by rail and in farm wagons, a throng estimated at two thousandarrived and assembled in “a grove of noble pines, under a bright blue sky.” Theyhad not gathered, said their orator, “for fun and frolic, not for mirth orsenseless parade,” but to listen to Douglass consider “the perilous condition ofthe country.” Under a canopy of trees, to a throng of western New York andFinger Lakes region farmers and townspeople, many of whom had sons, brothers, orfathers in the army in Virginia, Douglass delivered a carefully prepared addresshe called “The Slaveholder’s Rebellion.”28 [notes01.html#ch18fn_28a]Most of his arguments had been well rehearsed in editorials and speeches thatspring and summer. With reports of the shocking bloodshed all around the easternperimeter of Richmond, and the retreat of McClellan’s army to the James River indefeat just trickling in, Douglass acknowledged a “midnight blackness” intrudingon their beautiful day. The country was undergoing a “social earthquake,” thenational “house” was “on fire.” Douglass addressed big subjects: the origin ofthe war, its “tap root, and its sap, its trunk and its branches,” all born ofslavery; the Confederacy’s quest to forge in revolution an eternal slaveholders’republic; a history of the litany of compromises with slavery over time; themany perversions of the Declaration of Independence in the service of satisfyingthe demands of the Slave Power; the inevitability of the war; and McClellan’salleged disastrous incompetence as well as the duplicity within the Lincolnadministration. The war had now reached such scale of bloodshed that it was nolonger about constitutional authority, but about which side had the will tofight to win.29 [notes01.html#ch18fn_29a]In this sobering critique of the Union war effort, one new and important elementemerged. In the shade of a beautiful grove, the floor of the natural arenastrewn with pine needles, Douglass’s deep baritone called out an honestabolitionist’s patriotism. Contrary to his magnificent jeremiad for the Fourthof July in 1852, where the orator rang down a hailstorm separating himself and“your fathers,” “your” Declaration of Independence, and “your” Fourth of July,this time at Himrods Corners, ten years later and in the midst of a war that nowshowed vivid signs of becoming a struggle against slavery, Douglass suddenlyaltered the pronouns: “The claims of our fathers upon our memory, admiration andgratitude are founded in the fact that they wisely, and bravely, andsuccessfully met the crisis of their day.” This time he took ownership in thespecial day and gave it new meaning. “If the men of this generation woulddeserve well of posterity, they must like their fathers, discharge the dutiesand responsibilities of their age.” It was now his age, his duty, and especiallyhis country. They had gathered this time, said the black Jeremiah in softertones, to draw a new meaning “around the birth of our national independence.”Douglass linked past to present as he instructed the throng sitting on wagonsand leaning on trees. “We are only continuing the tremendous struggle, whichyour fathers and my fathers began eighty six years ago” (italics added).Douglass had never before called the American founders his “fathers.”30[notes01.html#ch18fn_30a] For him, a second American revolution was underway—more bloody, but perhaps more enduring and important than the first. Heclaimed his place among the founders of the second republic.For Douglass, emotionally and ideologically, the remainder of 1862 was asturbulent as any period in his life. The path to emancipation, despite thetriumphal meanings we retrospectively give it, was never linear or certain.Douglass now witnessed and interpreted the greatest changes as well as some ofthe most discouraging challenges he ever faced. At stake were the character andthe future of black freedom. Douglass plowed every ounce of his millennial andapocalyptic sensibility into his vision of events. Keeping faith in the jubileeto come out of this epic struggle required a belief that God could enter humanaffairs, that history could undergo sudden and radical change. The escalatingwar, however dark, made such a faith fathomable. Douglass frequently used suchterms as the “laws of God” or “laws of nature” to describe the engines ofhistory. “The world,” he announced, in an early-1863 speech, “like fish preachedto in the stream, moves on in obedience to the laws of its being, bearing awayall excrescences and imperfections in its progress. It has its periods ofillumination as well as of darkness, and often bounds forward a greater distancein a single year than in an age before.”31 [notes01.html#ch18fn_31a] With thisapocalyptic mentality, Douglass watched, lived, and interpreted the historyenveloping him.In September 1862, in the wake of the terrible Union defeat at Second Manassasin late August, and as Robert E. Lee’s Confederate army invaded Maryland in themost threatening moment of the war to date, Douglass called for “stern,vigorous, unrelenting war with rebels.” Divine messages lay in “sufferings,disasters, defeats.” In language strikingly similar to that used by Julia WardHowe in her “Battle Hymn of the Republic,” first published as lyrics earlierthat year in the Atlantic Monthly, Douglass measured progress now in blood. A“fiery sword of justice” waved over the land, Douglass wrote. “We are to besaved as by fire.” His message was about a brutal chastening from a vengefulGod. He acknowledged the need to “grieve with the sorrow-stricken families allover the North, but their terrible afflictions and heavy sorrows are theireducators.”32 [notes01.html#ch18fn_32a] With this harsh outlook the steely-eyededitor confronted as well the most frustrating issue of all—colonization.Colonization had deep and complex origins in the early American republic. Whatsome historians call the phase of “benevolent colonization,” especially fromroughly 1816 to the 1840s, stemmed from a complicated set of motives on the partof some white Americans. They advocated emigration as an ancient right ofpeoples to seek new beginnings so that blacks (like other migrants) coulddevelop their own independent societies unburdened by white racism, in a questfor equality apart from a stronger or dominant race, and as an abiding part ofthe biblical Exodus narrative. The story of Exodus has long driven theattraction of emigration schemes, especially in times of crisis, among blackAmericans.33 [notes01.html#ch18fn_33a]But for Douglass, colonization was an old and agonizing question. With only someexceptions—some plans led by blacks themselves aimed at staying in the westernhemisphere—he had always hated the premises of colonization. He did honor andreport about Martin Delany’s journeys during the war to West Africa in search ofsites for colonies. Douglass gave qualified endorsement to the spirit ofDelany’s quest, if not to his theories about racial purity, his “hyperbole”about finding a land of “the pure black uncorrupted by Caucasian blood.” Asearly as 1849 Douglass had warned against “slaveholding charmers,” in any guise,who had always “conjured up their old familiar spirits of colonization.” Hedespised its aims, as he said in 1856, because of its capacity to “confirmexisting prejudice as a thing natural and unsurmountable.” Douglass always sawcolonization as a debate over human dignity, not over improving race relationsby separating blacks from whites; he never viewed it merely as a policy or astrategy. However well intentioned, or packaged in liberal aims, it was removal,never reform. By wartime, as the Lincoln administration launched various schemesof colonization, Douglass called it the “bugbear . . . that has so troubled theAmerican people,” and the “singularly pleasing dream” of white supremacists.34[notes01.html#ch18fn_34a]Lincoln, a longtime sympathizer with colonization, set in motion a multilayeredeffort to expatriate blacks from the country. As early as March 1861, Lincolnhad instructed Elisha Oscar Crosby, the newly appointed minister-resident toGuatemala, to seek a place for black colonists in Central America. Crosbyorganized his mission throughout 1861, despite opposition from both theGuatemalan and Honduran governments. An ill-fated colonization scheme in Panamaalso emerged in the first year of the war.35 [notes01.html#ch18fn_35a]From April to August 1862, Lincoln received a great deal of advice regardingcolonization. The president’s cabinet remained quite divided on the issue, whilestrong support still existed in many quarters of the administration and Congressfor sending freed blacks to the nation of Liberia in West Africa. For a whileLincoln also entertained a scheme that would have sent ten thousand black troopsinto Florida to defeat Confederates, thereby seizing back the state for theUnion and forming the basis of a large migration to reconstruct that state.Serious interest in black emigration also took hold in Brazil, the British WestIndies, and the Danish island of St. Croix. By the end of August 1862, agentsfrom several West Indian colonies were on their way to Washington. But due tothe delicate diplomatic relationship between the United States and Britain, aswell as American abolitionist resistance, the West Indian initiatives never cameto fruition.36 [notes01.html#ch18fn_36a]At this crucial juncture, Lincoln decided on August 14 to meet with a smalldelegation of black ministers at the White House to discuss colonization. Thisinfamous meeting, Lincoln’s worst racial moment, was anything but a discussion;a nearly desperate president gave a one-way lecture looking for self-sacrificingblack men to volunteer to leave their country to assuage the fears of whitepeople who now had to imagine the end of slavery. The delegation, all from theWashington, DC, area, was led by Edward M. Thomas, president of an organizationcalled the Anglo-African Institute for the Encouragement of Industry and Art.This hastily assembled meeting did not include the more prominent Douglass, noreven the black emigrationists the Reverend Henry Highland Garnet or MartinDelany.37 [notes01.html#ch18fn_37a]After shaking hands with his guests at this first-ever meeting of a presidentwith black leaders, and with one or more members of the press invited to listenand record, Lincoln read a formal statement to the stunned ministers. Lincolncould not have been more forthright: “You and we are different races. We havebetween us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races.Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference isa great disadvantage to us both.” Blacks and whites mutually “suffer” from eachother’s presence in the same land, argued the president. For this reason,Lincoln concluded, “We should be separated.”38 [notes01.html#ch18fn_38a]Lincoln shockingly blamed the war on the presence of blacks. “But for your raceamong us there could not be war, although many men engaged on either side do notcare for you one way or another.” The host acknowledged that blacks, slave orfree, were enduring “the greatest wrong inflicted on any people,” but racialequality of any kind, in his view, could never be possible in America. “On thisbroad continent,” said Lincoln, “not a single man of your race is made the equalof a single man of ours.” He did not wish to debate this inequality, since itwas “a fact, about which we all feel and think alike, I and you.” With oneastonishing presumption after another, he argued that slavery had “evil effectson the white race” as well. “See our present condition—the country engaged inwar!—our white men cutting one another’s throats.” Lincoln beseeched the fiveblack representatives, who must have felt more than a little bewildered, toswallow their wishes for a future in the land of their birth and lead theirpeople to a foreign colony. He did not wish to seem “unkind,” but for them toreject his plea to lead in voluntary repatriation would be “an extremely selfishview of the case” and not in the best interest of their race. “It is exceedinglyimportant that we have men at the beginning capable of thinking as white men,”he bluntly continued, “and not those who have been systematically oppressed.”39[notes01.html#ch18fn_39a]Did the president really invite these men to the executive mansion to insultthem? Perhaps not. But in conceiving the audience as the wider nation, he surelyunderstood whose prejudices he stoked, and at whose expense. Lincoln concludedby putting the best possible face on Central America as the site of hiscolonization project. He employed the old racist canard that blacks could thrivein a “similarity of climate with your native land.” He promoted the prospect ofemployment in the coal mines. He suggested, against his own diplomaticintelligence, that the countries of Central America would warmly welcome them,and as president, he pledged personally that he “would endeavor to have you madeequals.” He wanted “a hundred” to start the colony, but almost like anauctioneer, he said he would take “fifty,” or even “twenty-five able-bodied men,with a mixture of women and children” to “make a successful commencement.” Thiswretched encounter ended with Edward Thomas saying they would get back toLincoln with an answer.40 [notes01.html#ch18fn_40a] As before and after, thisdiscussion of colonization turned on two fundamentally different conceptions ofthe future of black Americans. To Lincoln, a biracial democracy in America wouldnever be possible. Most black leaders, however, were flushed with new hopesabout a future precisely opposite from that outlined in Lincoln’s appeal.Douglass was outraged at Lincoln’s address to the black delegation. In Septemberhe reprinted Lincoln’s remarks in full in his paper, then penned the harshestcriticism he ever leveled at the president: “Mr. Lincoln assumes the languageand arguments of an itinerant Colonization lecturer,” charged Douglass, showingall his inconsistencies, his pride of race and blood, his contempt for Negroesand his canting hypocrisy. How an honest man could creep into such a characteras that implied by this address we are not required to show.” The editorlambasted Lincoln’s claim that the mere presence of blacks had caused the war.Dissolving his anger in sarcasm, Douglass likened Lincoln’s logic to “a horsethief pleading that the existence of the horse is the apology for his theft or ahighway man contending that the money in the traveler’s pocket is the sole firstcause of his robbery.”41 [notes01.html#ch18fn_41a] In this tragic humor,Douglass did Lincoln, the famous storyteller, one better.The war, contended Douglass, emerged from the “cruel and brutal cupidity ofthose who wish to possess horses, money, and Negroes by means of theft, robbery,and rebellion.” Douglass slammed Lincoln’s affirmation of white supremacy,calling him “a genuine representative of American prejudice and Negro hatred.”Douglass had no interest in acknowledging Lincoln’s need to assuage white fearsor to appeal to border-state sensitivities. Douglass felt betrayed by Lincoln’sstark appeal to blacks to leave the country for white people’s reasons. Thetenor of Lincoln’s address especially hurt: “The tone of frankness andbenevolence which he assumes in his speech to the colored committee is too thina mask not to be seen through. The genuine spark of humanity is missing init. . . . It expresses merely the desire to get rid of them [blacks] and remindsone of the politeness with which a man might try to bow out of his house sometroublesome creditor or the witness of some old guilt.”42[notes01.html#ch18fn_42a] An embittered Douglass laid bare the fullest meaningin colonization schemes.Blacks generally exploded with ire at Lincoln’s colonization address. Protestmeetings were held across the North. In language rich with patriotism andresolve, a Queens County, New York, gathering lectured Lincoln: “This is ournative country, we have as strong attachment naturally to our native hills,valleys, plains, luxuriant forests . . . mighty rivers, and lofty mountains asany other people.” An African American group in Philadelphia pointed to itssocial progress as evidence that white supremacy could be thwarted. “Shall wesacrifice this, leave our homes, forsake our birthplace, and flee to a strangeland,” they asked, “to appease the . . . prejudice of the traitors now in armsagainst the Government?” An A. P. Smith of New Jersey replied to Lincoln bywriting to Douglass’s paper. Even if racism was impregnable, as the presidentbelieved, “must I crush out my cherished hopes and aspirations, abandon my home,and become a pauper to the mean and selfish spirit that oppresses me?” A whiteradical abolitionist, Beriah Green, accused Lincoln of “braying—babbling . . .enough to turn the stomach of an ostrich.”43 [notes01.html#ch18fn_43a] Thedebate over colonization always came back, as in these testimonies, to its root:the American struggle over white supremacy.Some blacks, although a diminishing minority, responded favorably to the Lincolnadministration colonization proposals. By October 1862, Kansas senator SamuelPomeroy, the administration’s chief promoter of colonization schemes, claimed hehad received 13,700 applications from potential black emigrants, two of whomwere Douglass’s frustrated sons Lewis and Charles, who, now as young adults,broke with their father’s wishes and decided to consider moving to Panama. Twomonths earlier, Pomeroy had issued a widely published call, “The Appeal to FreeColored People of the United States,” describing the advantages and noblepurposes of the Central American scheme. Lewis Douglass was just shy oftwenty-two years old and Charles of eighteen. Douglass had written to Pomeroy aletter of introduction for at least one son, likely Lewis, whom Douglassdescribed as “of age, forms his own opinions, pursues his own plans and agreeswith me, and differs from me in the exercise of that liberty as American youngmen generally, who have their own way to make in the world.” We can know littleabout the intensity of these father-son disagreements or of the surges ofyouthful independence of black males with limited options living at home inRochester. Within half a year those prospects, however, markedly changed; theCentral American initiative crumbled nearly as fast as it emerged in the face ofits proprietor’s corruption and new historical imperatives.44[notes01.html#ch18fn_44a]• • •The president’s intentions with colonization have long been the subject ofrigorous debate in Lincoln scholarship. One recent biographer has called hisAugust 14 White House meeting the “puzzling . . . low point” in Lincoln’s racerelations, while another has analyzed it as part of the president’s larger“strategic racism.” Yet another writer has oddly complimented Lincoln for his“remarkable racial candor” and stressed that his brand of colonization onlyasked for volunteers, as opposed to the expulsion of blacks advocated by theharsher members of the administration. Still another biographer, whilethoroughly quoting the most racially insensitive lines of Lincoln’s address,concludes that it should be seen as the chief executive “trotting outcolonization to smooth the way for emancipation.” Some Lincoln scholars havelong chosen to believe that the president was never truly serious aboutcolonization and used it as a trial balloon to condition public opinion for hislarger rendezvous with history—the Emancipation Proclamation. Over time, manyhave chosen to see their Lincoln as morally whole, from 1865, rather than backin the volatile, revolutionary moments of 1861–62. Still other scholars haveforcefully argued that Lincoln was a true believer in colonization and neverrelinquished it as a policy option until he had to. As Eric Foner has written,“there is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Lincoln’s” ten years of publicsupport for colonization; it had always been one part of a larger vision of howslavery might end.45 [notes01.html#ch18fn_45a]To Douglass, Lincoln’s colonization appeal on August 14 was not merely apersonal insult to his or any African American’s integrity; it was a denigrationof humane values, a vile dashing of newfound hope. “To these colored people,”said Douglass, “without power and without influence the President is direct,undisguised and unhesitating. He says to the colored people: I don’t like you,you must clear out of the country.”46 [notes01.html#ch18fn_46a] Racism issometimes a political maneuver, a strategic position in the face of viciousopposition, a habit of mind entailed upon one’s soul, or a structural orinstitutional force beyond the grasp of individuals. But sometimes it must becomprehended, indeed felt first, in the heart of the insulted. Candor isultimately judged by its recipient.In September 1862, Douglass launched a counterattack, insisting thatNegro-hating mobs and colonization agents were united by what he called the“satanic spirit of colonization.” He sought to refute the racial determinism atthe heart of colonizationism and took dead aim at its central assumptions: thatwhite prejudice was unconquerable; that blacks naturally gravitated towardtropical climates; that color was a natural barrier to interracial marriage;that race fixed physical and intellectual aptitude; and that the “character” ofblacks and whites required social separation. United by these lethal theories,mobs provided the “brickbats and pistols,” Douglass said, while colonizationistsfurnished the “arguments and piety.” Douglass felt driven to resist what hecalled a “miserable philosophy.” To claims about the black man’s “nature”inclining him to servility, Douglass charged that it was “color” and not hisnature that so troubled the proponents of removal. He reaffirmed his belief in“a common human nature of all men” and called racial prejudice just “anotherproof of man’s perverse proclivity to create the causes of his own misery.”Douglass all but enjoyed dismissing the absurdity of climatic racial theory bysuggesting that if colonizationists considered climatic distribution of theraces their mission, he would demand that Caucasians who had emigrated to everycontinent on earth be sent back to Europe. To the belief that a “ban of nature”prevented intermarriage between the races, he simply pointed to the largemulatto population in America, and therefore to himself.47[notes01.html#ch18fn_47a]Douglass’s modern and absurdist critique of the racism at the heart ofcolonization schemes seems driven by both outrage and amusement. It came througha brilliant critique of racist psychology. To him the fear of miscegenationalways reflected a larger purpose: “Whenever any new villainy is to beperpetrated, or any old one against the Negro perpetuated, the popular prejudiceis rallied by a denunciation of amalgamation.” Ridicule was his onlyalternative. Douglass cast the denial of racial equality in global terms: “Ifmen may not live peaceably together . . . in the same land, they cannot so liveon the same continent, and ultimately in the same world.” If heterogeneity couldnot work in America, where could it? “If the black man cannot find peace fromthe aggressions of the white race on this continent,” he reasoned, “he will notbe likely to find it permanently on any part of the habitable globe.” Douglassnever wavered, as he had said as early as his famous address on ethnology in1854, from the cardinal belief in “the instinctive consciousness of the commonbrotherhood of man.”48 [notes01.html#ch18fn_48a]In the fall of 1862, through Postmaster General Montgomery Blair, the Lincolnadministration tried to officially enlist Douglass to help lead theircolonization schemes. Responding to Douglass’s letter of protest to SenatorPomeroy (which does not survive), Blair sought to assure Douglass that there was“no question of superiority or inferiority involved in the proposed removal.”Blair invoked the reputation of Thomas Jefferson to underscore the necessity ofracial separation. The minority race, argued Blair, must go elsewhere to imitatethe civilization established by the majority race (“thinking as white men,” asLincoln put it); the propriety of colonization stemmed from “the differencesbetween them . . . and it seems as obvious to me as it was to . . . the mind ofJefferson that the opinion against which you protest, is the necessary result ofindelible differences thus made by the Almighty.”49 [notes01.html#ch18fn_49a]Here it was again: colonization theory, gilded by the image of Jefferson,determined by God, driven by white supremacy while claiming otherwise, andcallously argued by a member of Lincoln’s cabinet. No ancient Exodus story orimpulse for the natural right of emigration motivated Blair’s appeal to racism.In Douglass’s public reply, one of the most extraordinary letters in Americanhistory from a black leader to a high-ranking government official about race,Douglass thanked Blair for the opportunity to assess the colonization issue.Then, writing on September 16, on a day between the surrender of huge numbers ofUnion troops to Confederate general Stonewall Jackson at Harpers Ferry (on thefifteenth), and the battle of Antietam in Maryland on the seventeenth (thebloodiest day in American history), Douglass lambasted Blair’s theory andpurpose. As evidence to refute climatic theory, Douglass pointed to nearly 250years of black residence on American soil: “If ever any people can beacclimatized, I think the Negro can claim to be so in this country.” PerhapsDouglass was wryly smiling about all the winters he had spent in the snow beltof Rochester, New York. The idea of racial climate zones had gained wideacceptance in antebellum America, especially due to the work of the Harvardbiologist Louis Agassiz, who had applied the notion of “zoological provinces”for animal and plant life to the races of man. Douglass refused to see“scientific” racial theory as anything but ideology; he considered alldiscussion of “confining different varieties of men to different belts of theearth’s surface” to be “chimerical in the extreme.”50 [notes01.html#ch18fn_50a]Refusing any longer to be lectured to, Douglass did the lecturing. He bluntlyrejected Blair’s white nationalism, insisting that blacks and whites could live“under the same government.” “We have readily adapted ourselves to yourcivilization,” he continued. “We are Americans by birth and education, and havea preference for American institutions as against those of any other country.”In direct language that might apply to any xenophobic panic or racial-exclusionimpulse down through American history, Douglass put Blair on notice: “That weshould wish to remain here is natural to us and creditable to you.”51[notes01.html#ch18fn_51a] Douglass and the Republicans came to a similar view ofthe future of slavery in America. But on the future racial character of anAmerican nation, they were as yet far apart. As a final objection to Blair’sentreaty, Douglass once again addressed the pernicious effects of colonization,which he saw as proslavery theory in disguise. Douglass insisted that slavery,racism, and future black equality be discussed as a single question, to besettled on American soil within American institutions.Douglass ended his letter to Blair with an appeal for national regeneration bornof the cruel war, declaring confidently that out of “this terrible baptism ofblood and fire through which our nation is passing . . . not as has been mostcruelly affirmed, because of the presence of men of color in the land, but bymalignant . . . vices, nursed into power . . . at the poisoned breast ofslavery, it will come at last . . . purified in its spirit freed from slavery,vastly greater . . . than it ever was before in all the elements of advancingcivilization.”52 [notes01.html#ch18fn_52a] The angry orator’s demolition ofBlair is one for the ages, and one of the great documents of his writing life.Douglass’s best answer to this personal challenge from colonizationists was toassert his people’s claim to American nationality. For forty years AfricanAmericans had faced colonization as both threat and opportunity. But in 1862 thedebate took place in an urgent, wartime atmosphere. In the midst of the war,with emancipation on the horizon, Douglass led this struggle against a lasthurrah of colonization. As Douglass parried with Blair over the consequences offreeing black people, President Lincoln was preoccupied with whether, when, andhow to do it.• • •On September 15, 1862, President Lincoln received dispatches from GeneralMcClellan about his somewhat exaggerated sense of victory that day at SouthMountain and Crampton’s Gap in Maryland. As Robert E. Lee’s army reorganizedalong Antietam Creek, Lincoln wrote back a quick message: “God bless you, andall with you. Destroy the rebel army, if possible.” Just two days earlier at theWhite House, Lincoln had met with a delegation of clergy from Chicago whodelivered to him a direct appeal for a proclamation by the president of “generalemancipation” of the slaves. They believed that such a decree was God’s “Divinewill,” and that “marvelous conversions to the wisdom of emancipation” hadrecently swept across the North. Lincoln engaged the ministers in an openexchange over the timing and consequences of an emancipation edict. He hadabandoned constitutional qualms about freeing slaves as commander in chief; heviewed it, he said, as “a practical war measure.” In these tense weeks, Lincolnseemed almost at war with himself about just what to do about slavery. He seemedworried about his actual power on the ground. How could he stop, for example,rebel troops from kidnapping blacks from Maryland back to Virginia and sellingthem into slavery, when the Union army could not seem to stop Lee’s invasion?How could his “word” free slaves when, he admitted, “I cannot even enforce theConstitution in the rebel states?” Lincoln feared doing only what would appearas “inoperative.” A proclamation might only be “like the Pope’s bull against thecomet!” the president half joked. After this parley about ending slavery,Lincoln assured the ministers that “the subject is on my mind, by day and night,more than any other.”53 [notes01.html#ch18fn_53a]Lincoln had prepared a draft of his Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation atleast as early as July 22, 1862, when he announced to a cabinet meeting hisintention to issue such a document. Timing in the end was all. In the wake ofthe battle of Antietam and Lee’s retreat across the Potomac River into Virginia,the president had victory enough on the battlefield so as not to worry thatemancipation by executive order would be ineffective. Likely on Sunday,September 21, Lincoln redrafted in hand his Proclamation. The document put theSouth and the world on notice that on January 1, 1863, unless the Confederacyceased the war, Lincoln would free all the slaves in the states “in rebellion.”Again, he urged gradualism as well as colonization of freed blacks by their“consent . . . on this continent or elsewhere.”54 [notes01.html#ch18fn_54a]Demonstrating his haste to get the document before his cabinet and proclaimed onSeptember 22, the president used scissors to cut out sections of both Congress’s“Article of War” from March ordering the army and the navy to receive allfugitive slaves into their lines, and the Second Confiscation Act of July 17,reinforcing even more forcefully the same principle. He then pasted thesesections into this original draft. In the document’s third paragraph, inlanguage never to be forgotten in American civil religion, and which Douglassseized upon with renewed hope, Lincoln said that “all persons held as slaves” inthe designated states and regions, as of January 1, “shall be then,thenceforward, and forever free.” All members of the armed forces of the UnitedStates were commanded to do “no act or acts” impeding the freedpeople fromexercising “their actual freedom.”55 [notes01.html#ch18fn_55a]In Lincoln’s cabinet, Douglass’s colonization nemesis, Montgomery Blair, was thesole member to oppose the Preliminary Proclamation. Response in the borderstates was generally hostile as well. The stock market declined, and across theNorth and at the battlefronts, some Union soldiers initially declared theirhostility to fighting to free black people; the Proclamation was openlyridiculed among McClellan’s officers. But overall, the Northern reaction to thisrevolutionary shift in the purpose of the war was positive. Democratic Partypapers mocked the Proclamation as mere “paper thunder” or as “radicalfanaticism,” “social revolution,” and “gross unconstitutionality.” Republicanpapers, however, rejoiced, declaring it “the beginning of the end of therebellion; the beginning of the new life of the nation.” Among Republicanpoliticians, enthusiasm soared, although some wished for a more unconditionalassault on slavery. Massachusetts governor John Andrew wanted more, butdistinguished between the text and its ultimate meaning in a tellingobservation: “It is a poor document, but a mighty act; slow, somewhat halting,wrong in its delay till January, but grand and sublime after all.” At the frontlines, many Union soldiers now saw some kind of reality beneath their endlesscampfire conversations about the “military necessity” of emancipation.56[notes01.html#ch18fn_56a]In Rochester, Douglass sat at his editor’s desk, as he did so often, looked outon the war, and tried to speak for 4 million slaves, converting despair intohope: “We shout for joy that we live to record this righteous decree.”Acknowledging Lincoln’s “cautious, forbearing, and hesitating way,” he seized onthe words “forever free” and urged all to join the “long enslaved millions” inhonoring and celebrating “this hour of . . . deliverance.” Douglass expressednew confidence in Lincoln in words very different from a month earlier. “AbrahamLincoln may be slow, Abraham Lincoln may desire peace even at the price ofleaving our terrible sore untouched . . . but Abraham Lincoln is not the man toreconsider, retract and contradict words and purposes solemnly proclaimed overhis official signature.” The duty of hope soared with new energy. “Confide inhis word,” Douglass advised about Lincoln, all the while falling back, asbefore, on faith in “events greater than the President, events which have slowlywrung this proclamation from him.” Douglass also placed new faith in thedocument’s “implied” meanings, especially Lincoln’s apparent decision to putaside “border state influence” as well as “half-loyal” Democrats who claimed tobe Unionists. And if some Union enlisted men and officers threw down their armsand refused to fight to free the slaves, Douglass concluded, so be it: “Let thearmy be cleansed from all such proslavery vermin.” The editor allowed himself tobelieve that the war he had advocated was now at hand, especially if Northernerswould let “the black man have an arm as well as a heart in this war.” Gird yourloins, Douglass urged, for the “last struggle with the monster slavery.”57[notes01.html#ch18fn_57a]In the fall congressional elections of 1862, the Democrats made sweeping gains;Republicans suffered at the polls because of emancipation, and a “depressed”Lincoln, as numerous biographers have suggested, did not know quite where toturn. Northern voters were also prompted by a drumbeat in the press over fearsof slave insurrection, by resistance to Lincoln’s suspension of habeas corpusand to arrests of newspaper editors, as well as by virulently racist DemocraticParty rhetoric about emancipation leading to “scenes of lust and rapine” in theSouth and a “swarthy inundation” of black workers into the North. In the anxioushundred days between the Preliminary and final Emancipation Proclamations,jubilation gave way to confusion in abolitionist and free-black communities.Above all, the news never abated about Lincoln and his men still planning forcolonization. In late-September cabinet meetings Lincoln pushed his ministers tocontinue the effort for voluntary removal and by November he still hopedprivately to make colonization in Central America a reality.58[notes01.html#ch18fn_58a]Douglass exhibited a strikingly new mood in the fall of 1862, even about thedreaded bugbear of colonization. By November, he published contradictory reportsabout the state of colonization schemes still percolating from Washington. Inone brief column he said that Pomeroy’s expedition to Panama was soon to depart,and that some black monitors should accompany the emigrants. But in anadjoining, longer piece, he claimed that his contacts in “high authority” hadinformed him that the Central American expedition had been cancelled. Douglasseditorialized, as though still trying to convince his own sons not to leave,that colonization made no sense economically. In America, said the editor,blacks are the workers; they had built the nation’s wealth, and it was “wastefuland ruinous” to deport them now.59 [notes01.html#ch18fn_59a]For Douglass, his family, and the entire abolitionist community, the fall of1862 was a sleepless watch night that lasted three months. “The next twomonths,” Douglass wrote in November, “must be regarded as more critical anddangerous than any similar period during the slaveholders’ rebellion.” The“apprehension,” he said, felt “far more political than military.” Douglass threwhimself into the election fray as a partisan Republican. The biggest enemy atthat moment, he argued, were Northern Democrats. Douglass asserted that a votefor Democrats in the congressional elections was a vote for “Jefferson Davis andhis rebel government.” Instinctively impatient, Douglass urged Lincoln toabandon the grace period for Confederate “repentance” and proclaim immediateemancipation. Lincoln’s Proclamation had given Douglass a new political voice asan American nationalist. “Liberty and country first,” he wrote, “everything elseafterward.”60 [notes01.html#ch18fn_60a] He had indeed found the new politics hehad sought for a decade.Douglass further took heart from reports he received about liberated slavesswarming into contraband camps established by the War Department around the rimof the South. A correspondent, H. Oscar, wrote to Douglass from Cairo, Illinois,located at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, rejoicing that “itbegins to look as though the jubilee sure enough had come in this country.” The“old barracks” of the town were full of black refugees, yet “still they come.”Every morning, a new contingent of freedpeople, men and women of all ages andall colors, appeared on the levee seeking shelter and asking about jobs andwages. The contrabands faced considerable white hostility, however, in thesurrounding community; Oscar reported a rape of a black woman by three whitemen.61 [notes01.html#ch18fn_61a]Douglass also kept up a fervent correspondence about emancipation and afund-raising campaign with his British friends. Constantly, his paper neededmoney to survive, and he received numerous small contributions throughout 1862from Julia Crofts’s network of supporters. In October Douglass wrote a publicletter to his British and Irish friends, in which he gushed with new hope forthe cause, gratitude for past financial and moral resources, and made anaggressive appeal for more money. Douglass became a one-man political-actioncommittee for emancipation. He expressed special thanks for all the support overthe years for the Underground Railroad, but as of September 22, he remarked, its“agents” were “out of employment.” With Lincoln’s Proclamation, Douglass assuredhis foreign readers, America had started the “first chapter of a new history.”Now was the time for continued aid, said the editor with bills to pay and athrilling new revolution to lead. “The end is not yet,” he cautioned. “We are atbest only at the beginning of the end.” The following month, Douglass thecheerleader proclaimed the Preliminary Proclamation the nation’s “moralbombshell” shaking everything into new forms. Rumors of slave insurrections inVirginia, he maintained, terrified the Confederate leadership and “would wellnigh paralyze Lee and Cornwall Jackson” (Stonewall Jackson) in ensuingcampaigns. The war propagandist had found a new argument, even a new sense ofhumor. Douglass falsely said he would “regret” such insurrections, even as hehoped they would be “formidable” if they must occur.62 [notes01.html#ch18fn_62a]• • •The wait for January 1 was almost unbearable, especially when Douglass readLincoln’s annual message in December, in which he forthrightly appealed yetagain for colonization to accompany emancipation, reminding the nation that hecould not “make it better known than it already is that I strongly favorcolonization.” But so long conditioned for less than full measures of changefrom history or from Providence, Douglass journeyed to Boston for New Year’s Dayand a planned celebration like no other. A highbrow event took place at Boston’sMusic Hall, with many of New England’s most famous literati in attendance,including Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Charles EliotNorton, John Greenleaf Whittier, Edward Everett Hale, Francis Parkman, and RalphWaldo Emerson. Harriet Beecher Stowe sat prominently in the balcony. Emersonread some original verses for the occasion; in a transcendent moment the throngof hundreds rhythmically called for Mrs. Stowe to stand and bow, to resoundingcheers. Then an orchestra played Mendelssohn’s Hymn of Praise, followed by arousing rendition of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. A day for “poetry and song”indeed, as Douglass had anticipated.63 [notes01.html#ch18fn_63a]But beginning at 10:00 a.m., a largely black-organized meeting assembledthroughout the day, reaching approximately three thousand people, at themagnificent Tremont Temple. Presided over in the early hours by blackGarrisonians William Cooper Nell and Charles Lenox Remond, the speeches, poetry,and singing were confidently joyous. Garrison himself attended the upper-crustevent at the Music Hall, perhaps letting his old enemy from Rochester have thatTremont platform to himself. William Wells Brown, yet another old rival ofDouglass’s, delivered a rousing autobiographical tribute to the enterprise andself-reliance of former slaves all over the country. Douglass was the finalspeaker at the afternoon session. He alluded with irony to two years earlierwhen he and others had been driven from that same stage by a mob prepared tokill abolitionists. He honored the slaves of the South for their forbearance innot rising in insurrection and appealed for what he hoped would be the imminentenlistment of black men in the Union armies. On behalf of abolitionists heboasted that their warning delivered for decades was now coming to fruition inthe “blood” of the moment, as he also predicted much more blood to come.Douglass soared, assuring the audience they had lived through a “period ofdarkness” into the “dawn of light.” His final refrains were constantlypunctuated by shouts of “Amen!” and “Bless the Lord!”64[notes01.html#ch18fn_64a]After a break, the huge crowd grew even larger for the nighttime celebration andthe anticipated news of Lincoln’s signing the Final Proclamation. But a mood ofanxiety and doubt set in throughout the hall as the evening hours crept bywithout the word. The organizers maintained a group of runners to and from thetelegraph office in downtown Boston. They all awaited, as Douglass remembered,“the first flash of the electric wires.” Their emotions danced between hope andfear. Would Lincoln indeed sign the wonderful decree? Would it be altered? Wouldthere be some last-minute compromise in Washington or even with the Confederacy?Rumor and experience pushed back constantly against analysis and biblicalexpectation of the Jubilee. Amid all the restlessness Wells Brown and Douglassboth got control of the audience and kept up a hopeful but strained rhetoric.“Every moment of waiting chilled our hopes,” Douglass recalled years later.“Eight, nine, ten o’clock came and went, and still no word.” With a “visibleshadow” falling over the crowd, Douglass said, a man finally stepped hastilythrough the crowd and shouted, “It is coming! It is on the wires!” He wasimmediately followed by someone who tried to read some portion of the text ofthe Emancipation Proclamation, but was quickly drowned out by shouting and a“scene . . . wild and grand.” In the next hour Douglass hugged perhaps morepeople than he had before in his entire life, some of whom were old enemies.That night there were no Garrisonian or anti-Garrisonian tears. An old preachernamed Rue stood front and center with Douglass as they led the assembled in theanthem “Blow Ye the Trumpet, Blow” and repeated the verse “Sound the loudtimbrel o’er Egypt’s dark sea, / Jehovah hath triumphed, his people are free.”According to witnesses, Douglass’s baritone had never been in better form.65[notes01.html#ch18fn_65a]Tremont Temple had been hired only until midnight. But at that hour most of thecelebrants decided to reassemble at the Twelfth Baptist Church on PhillipsStreet in Beacon Hill, the black section of Boston, a twenty-minute walk away.Douglass and the revelers, singing, humming, shouting, walked out onto TremontStreet into a gentle, glistening snowfall to march to what all called the“Fugitive Slave’s Church.” What swirling memories transported them along onlythey could tell. At the church they were welcomed by its minister of many years,Leonard A. Grimes, who oversaw an all-night celebration of music andrefreshments. “At Grimes’s church,” said Douglass, “we got into such a state ofenthusiasm that almost everything seemed to be witty and appropriate to theoccasion.” Sometime near dawn, in exhausted jubilation, Douglass walked out ofthe church amid the quiet snowflakes and headed, bleary-eyed, to the trainstation. In Life and Times he remembered the meaning of that night with his ownpoetry: “It was not logic, but the trump of jubilee, which everybody wanted tohear. We were waiting and listening as for a bolt from the sky, which would rendthe fetters of four millions of slaves; we were watching, as it were, by the dimlight of the stars, for the dawn of a new day; we were longing for the answer tothe agonizing prayers of centuries. Remembering those in bonds as bound withthem, we wanted to join in the shout for freedom, and in the anthem of theredeemed.”66 [notes01.html#ch18fn_66a] At that moment, and for its duration, thecruel and apocalyptic war had become holy."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 19--------------------------------------------------------------------------------MEN OF COLOR TO ARMS!During times of peace, the sons bury their fathers, but in war it is the fatherswho send their sons to the grave.—HERODOTUS, THE HISTORYIn 1863, more than ever, the Civil War became a family affair for FrederickDouglass and his household with four unmarried adult children. Lewis and CharlesDouglass, at the ages of twenty-two and eighteen, enlisted in the Fifty-FourthMassachusetts Regiment in March, recruited personally by their father. “Charley,my youngest son was the first to put his name down as one of the company,”Douglass wrote to Gerrit Smith with exuberance. By later that summer, FrederickJr., age twenty-one, also at his father’s behest, went to Mississippi, not as asoldier, but as a recruiter of black troops. There is no evidence that any ofthe sons had ever shouldered as much as a hunting rifle when growing up inwestern New York. But off to the war they went, and apparently willingly,abandoning earlier interests in emigration from the United States. Their fatherspoke and wrote proudly of their service and their bravery. “I have implored theimperiled nation to unchain against her foes, her powerful black hand,” Douglasswrote forcefully on March 21, 1863, in his famous recruiting broadside, “Men ofColor to Arms!” “Words are now useful only as they stimulate to blows.” ButDouglass’s effusive public words urging young black men “to fly to arms, andsmite with death the power that would bury the government and your liberty inthe same hopeless grave,” may have masked the private family anguish of a fatherrecruiting his sons to go to war for their reasons as well as his own. Itremained to be seen whose “manhood” was at stake in this family drama, thefather’s or the sons’.1 [notes01.html#ch19fn_1a] We know precious little of whatAnna Douglass thought of seeing her sons march off to war where they mighteasily be enslaved or killed.For Lewis and Charles in particular, their lives were forever altered by theirmilitary experience. Sending the middle son, Frederick, to the Deep South,though far more thrilling for him than staying at home, could only have beenfraught with anguish as well.2 [notes01.html#ch19fn_2a] Moreover, for most of1862 and early 1863, the Douglasses’ daughter, a disgruntledtwenty-three-year-old Rosetta, sought independence by boarding in other citieswith relatives and abolitionist families, seeking more education and teachingschool.All of Anna’s children were getting out of the house; the Douglass family in itsown way went to war. “I have been launched among strange people during the lastsix months,” Rosetta wrote to her father in August 1862 from Salem, New Jersey,while living with Anna Douglass’s brother Perry. Earlier, she had stayed inPhiladelphia with the Dorsey family, where she said she felt “in bondage.”Homesick and “gloomy,” Rosetta seems to have hated Mrs. Dorsey’s accusationsthat Douglass had sent her away to keep her from pursuing young men. In Salem,Rosetta complained of the same treatment: Uncle Perry and Aunt Lizzy bothclaimed she was “sassy and unruly,” and that she became their boarder to cureher of “growing intimacy with men.” Rosetta did find a teaching job, which sherelished, reporting that her fifty students “all . . . appear to love me.” ByOctober she took extra odd jobs at knitting and embroidery.3[notes01.html#ch19fn_3a]Rosetta’s letters to her father exhibit a deep tenderness, a desperate desire toplease, and the tensions in the Douglass household. She repeatedly thanked herfather for the money he sent her and craved his affection, writing about theirmutual loneliness: “I often think of your loneliness, for I well perceive thenecessity of congenial companions. . . . I flatter myself if I were at home Imight in a measure contribute to your happiness as well as to mother’s.” Thenshe observed the problem of the separate worlds of her parents through animpulse of family love: “I wish to be all you would have me be, and I wish alsoto do something to make mother happy and if both were interested in the samepursuits—it would be much easier for me to be just what I wish to be—a comfortto both parents.” According to his daughter, Douglass had tried to instruct allhis children in “uprightness and character.” In apologetic tones, Rosettaadmitted she had learned so much from her father. “Though I never said much whenour table talks were going on, I made resolutions to follow your lessons.”Rosetta did remain informed about war news; she also reported on visits from herrestless brother Lewis, who was pursuing business. A business card survives,dated as early as 1860, labeled “L. H. & F. Douglass Jr., ‘Groceries andProvisions,’ ” on 151 Buffalo Street, Rochester. Rosetta counseled her fathernot to “grow despondent” in waiting for emancipation day; she was always eagerto receive the Monthly, read the editor’s extraordinary exchange with PostmasterBlair about colonization with keen interest, and by December 28, 1862, longinglywished to read the newspaper reports of the big meeting in Boston on January 1.4[notes01.html#ch19fn_4a]One additional part-time guest in the Douglass home did not leave as often asAnna Douglass might have wished. For many summers between the late 1850s and1872, Ottilie Assing came to Rochester and stayed in the house as Frederick’sintellectual and emotional companion. She lived most of the year in Hoboken, NewJersey, and corresponded with her friend regularly. Assing tried futilely toreshape Douglass’s views on various subjects, especially religion, even as sheparroted so much of his own rhetoric in essays for her German readers. How thisménage à trois functioned for so long still remains, in part, a mystery. Assinglived in Rochester for several months at a time, assisting Douglass with thenewspaper and writing her own columns for Morgenblatt. He was on the roadlecturing for long periods when Assing may have gone back to New Jersey.Assing’s biographer suggests that the two women reached some kind of “truce” bywhich the arrangement endured. Although Assing sipped tea occasionally with Mrs.Douglass, she held Anna in utter contempt, disrespecting her lack of education,and even at times privately denigrating her role as homemaker. As Leigh Foughthas written, Assing’s annual visits were intrusions on the household, to say theleast. In letters to Douglass, Assing referred to Anna as “border state,” as themisfitted wife and unnatural impediment in the way of the German woman’s designsand alternative views of love and marriage. Assing hoped that once the warended, a separation or divorce might finally happen and she might be able towalk tall as the rightful “Mrs. Douglass.”5 [notes01.html#ch19fn_5a] Assing andher host were probably lovers, and his response was surely as responsible as herpursuit. But she would be sorely disappointed on the notion of severing themarriage.“Perhaps no other home received under its roof a more varied class of peoplethan did our home,” wrote Rosetta in an understatement while reminiscing abouther mother. Rosetta honored her mother for being frugal, for her great skill asa housekeeper. But as Rosetta pursued a world beyond Rochester, Anna Douglassretreated into her own largely closed world and took charge at home. Annarebelled in her own way. If a visitor expressed something disagreeable about thehouse or about Anna herself, that person might be “vigorously repelled,”remembered the daughter, “in a manner more forceful than the said party woulddeem her capable of.” How often this may have happened to the righteouslyopinionated Assing, her mind and demeanor preoccupied by literary imaginationand with Anna’s husband, we can only guess. Anna lived daily life with extreme“reserve,” said Rosetta. “She could not be known all at once, she had to bestudied.”6 [notes01.html#ch19fn_6a] Such a study repelled Assing, and Douglassenabled the intruder.• • •Despite all these exciting changes and domestic troubles in the Douglasshousehold, kept entirely hidden in the writer’s autobiographies, the winter andspring of 1863 was a time for public glory, a time to reap all the possibilitiesof what Douglass called “the greatest event of the century”—the EmancipationProclamation and the sacred history that flowed from it. The Final Proclamationincluded two significant changes from the Preliminary: it contained noprovisions for colonization, and it called for the recruitment of black men intothe Union armed forces. The “destiny” of the American nation had changedforever, Douglass argued. On January 1, the “national ship” would now “swinground, her towering sails . . . swelled by the trade winds of the Almighty andshe will either be wafted off gloriously to the open sea . . . or furiouslydriven by rebellious gales upon the sharp and flinty rocks only to mark theplace of danger to . . . aftercoming voyages.”7 [notes01.html#ch19fn_7a]Douglass bet on the glorious open sea and an Almighty on the side of freedom.In January and much of February 1863 Douglass traveled more than two thousandmiles from Boston to Chicago and many places in between, attending Jubileemeetings, cautiously anticipating the new war, the new history made possible bythe emancipation. His new standard speech was a tour de force of apocalypticism,moral philosophy, and a thunderous appeal for the enlistment of blacks in thearmy with equal status. The Proclamation, even with its limitations (freeingslaves only in the Confederate states or in occupied areas), brought about aworld-historical moment, “a complete revolution in the position of a nation.”The republic was undergoing a second founding, and Douglass felt more than readyto be one of its fathers. An amazing change was under way, argued Douglass, notonly for blacks and for the nation, but for “justice throughout the world.” “Weare all liberated by this Proclamation,” declared the unusually joyous orator.“Everybody is liberated. The white man is liberated, the black man is liberated,the brave men now fighting the battles . . . are now liberated.”8[notes01.html#ch19fn_8a] The old nation might now be bludgeoned into ruin, and anew one imagined.Emancipation prompted from Douglass an effusion of millennial faith andexpressions of the doctrine of progress. As Michael Walzer has argued, theJewish and Christian sense of Exodus, of a possible liberation through and afteraffliction and slavery, has been so compelling over time because it is basedessentially on a promise. The Exodus story is both so powerful and so adaptablebecause it is not an account of miracles, of merely waiting for God’sintercessions. God will choose moments to intervene, but the great Exodusnarrative gets “God’s people marching,” writes Walzer, “through the world to abetter place in it.” Hence, the Old Testament story can be such a source of“radical hope” if people possess sufficient faith; they can march off withexpectation that “the world is not all Egypt.” Douglass believed events gaveevidence that a “moral chemistry” and an interventionist God now drove historyforward. He had rehearsed for this moment for more than twenty years; a prophetissues the warnings and must be ready to reap history’s results. Words, faith,inspiration, and an abiding pathos, argues Abraham Heschel, are the propheticstock-in-trade. A prophet spares no piety; he is an “assaulter of the mind.” Thewords of a true prophet, says Heschel, are “a scream in the night” rooted in asense of history.9 [notes01.html#ch19fn_9a] And timing may be all. With areasoned scream, Douglass discerned that Babylon might now be falling.“I believe in the millennium, the final perfection of the race,” declaredDouglass in his post–January 1 speech, “and hail this Proclamation, though rungout under the goading lash of a stern military necessity.” He counseled hislarge crowds not to dwell on the pronouncement’s imperfections. “Men may see init only as a military necessity. To me it has a higher significance. It is agrand moral necessity.” Both moralist and humorist, he entertained as hepreached. The mixture of God and history should startle or shock, he argued. “Agreat truth breaks upon the vision of some early riser,” said Douglass, “andstraightaway he wakes up the drowsy world with the announcement of the day andthe work. Sleepy people don’t like to be disturbed. They hate the troubler . . .draw their curtains . . . turn their backs to the light.” A century later, JamesBaldwin may have been channeling Douglass as he observed a new crisis over raceand freedom. When Americans reflect on history, Baldwin wrote, “words are mostlyused to cover the sleeper, not to wake him up.” Emancipation in the midst ofall-out war was the kind of history that awakened all sleepers. Proof ofprogress now seemed palpable everywhere. Douglass kept a New York CooperInstitute audience laughing about signs of progress. Only a hundred years ago,some Irish, he said, exploiting common prejudices, “thought that the proper wayto attach a horse to a plow was by the tail. It seemed to them that was what thetail was made for.” Two hundred years back in time some Christians in the WestIndies “thought it a sin to baptize persons of color who were slaves” becausethey were property. More recently, he said, right in New England, an older womanwho might be a “little eccentric” and especially “gifted . . . stood a smartchance of being hanged as a witch.” And just the last few years demonstrated therecent progress that all knew well. “Good old John Brown was a mad man atHarpers Ferry,” pronounced Douglass. “Two years pass away, and the nation is asmad as he is.”10 [notes01.html#ch19fn_10a]Image [../images/f0390-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, Hillsdale, Michigan, January 21, 1863. Edwin Burke Ives andReuben L. Andrews photographers, carte de visite.Measuring progress now became a daily affair. The most revolutionary sign of allwas the impending enlistment of black soldiers in the Union army. The “paperProclamation” would thus “be made iron, lead, and fire.” Douglass demanded “fairplay” for black troops, equality in provisions, ranks, and respect. He insistedthat they would not only fight, but “fight with vengeance.” He chided whites to“stop calling them ‘n__rs,’ and call them soldiers.” “Give them a chance!” heshouted, then led the audience in repeating the chant with vigor: “Give them achance!” The black soldier would be the redemptive agent of the apocalyptic war.“You have wronged us long and wronged us greatly,” Douglass said as thoughspeaking to the nation, “but it is not yet too late to retrieve the past. Westill stand ready to serve you, and will do it with a will, at the first soundof your war trumpet.”11 [notes01.html#ch19fn_11a] In 1863, Douglass did not waitto hear anyone else’s trumpet.• • •Massachusetts led the way in the cause of black enlistment. Its governor, JohnAndrew, was a staunch antislavery Republican and worked vigorously to convincethe Lincoln administration to allow him to mobilize black troops. In January1863, he received authorization from Secretary of War Edwin Stanton to recruit aregiment. Stanton promised equal pay and treatment for black soldiers but deniedAndrew’s request for black commissioned officers. Although Stanton did not keepall his promises, and the denial of officer’s rank caused deep resentments, therecruiting began for the famous Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Infantry Regiment.The Massachusetts legislature paid for recruiters and to transport troops, andAndrew called on the wealthy Boston abolitionist George Luther Stearns to directthe recruiting. For the remainder of the war Stearns devoted himself and a fairportion of his fortune to the cause of black enlistment. Stearns quicklyestablished recruiting posts all across the North and enlisted as agents a who’swho of black abolitionists: Douglass, Charles Lenox Remond, John MercerLangston, William Wells Brown, Henry Highland Garnet, and Martin Delany(friends, but mostly Douglass’s rivals). Stearns paid Douglass’s expenses at $10per week, less than what the editor thought his services were worth; although heuttered no public objection, he did complain privately about his compensation.Douglass threw himself into recruiting with electric energy; Massachusetts, hedeclared, was “not only the most direct way to the heart of our slaveholdingrebellion, but she is the colored man’s way to . . . political and civilliberty.” The historic link between soldiering and citizenship had never beforebeen given such an open door; Douglass’s task was to convince black men to marchthrough it.12 [notes01.html#ch19fn_12a]And march they did. The Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts was a national blackregiment, with members from fifteen Northern states, all four border states,five Confederate states, and some from Canada and the West Indies. They wereoverwhelmingly freeborn blacks, although at least thirty men in the regiment’sranks were former slaves. The men of the Fifty-Fourth formed a remarkable crosssection of working-class black life in America. Fifty-one barbers, thirty-eightseamen, thirty-four waiters, twenty-seven boatmen, twenty-four teamsters, andtwo peddlers signed up. The ranks included one cabinetmaker, a dentist, and adruggist. Five called themselves students, and only one preacher enlisted amongthe original one thousand and seven. Twenty-seven strong joined in New Bedford,Massachusetts; one of their number, a bright and literate twenty-six-year-oldseaman named James H. Gooding, would write a series of weekly letters to thehometown newspaper, providing that community a rich record of the regiment’sstory, until his death after five months at Andersonville prison in Georgia inJuly 1864. James Caldwell, the grandson of Sojourner Truth, enlisted from BattleCreek, Michigan. Thirty-eight men over forty years old served in the regiment,the oldest of whom, at forty-six, was Peter Vogelsang, a clerk from Brooklyn,New York. The recruits underwent a rigorous medical examination, and doctorsrejected nearly one out of three men.13 [notes01.html#ch19fn_13a]Douglass first met with Stearns in late February; they launched their franticcrusade together. Within days, Douglass issued his broadside, “Men of Color toArms!” Stearns’s correspondence with Douglass took on a breathless quality as he(Stearns) tallied the numbers by town and region and gave instructions about theprice to pay for transport (“can send in second class cars at $3 each”), whichrailroads were cooperating with free fares and which were hostile. At somejunctions they had constant “fear of disturbance.” No one in America, even inmodestly antislavery upstate New York, had ever seen anything like this: groupsof boisterous black men, often singing, riding the cars and strutting throughtrain stations on their way to take up arms for their country. Charles Douglassproudly remembered having “the honor of being the first to enroll at Rochesterfor the 54 Mass. Inf. Feb. 9, 1863.” Soldiers never forget those dates.Similarly, his older brother Lewis wrote with equal pride to his sweetheart,Amelia Loguen, in late March that he had been appointed a noncommissionedsergeant major. He described the seventeen recruits with whom he left Syracuseas his men. They rode the “first class cars,” and “on the way to Binghamton mymen amused themselves by singing John Brown.” Lewis’s chest swelled as he wrotefrom camp, wearing his new uniform. He felt respected and a sense of honor asnever before. “I have enlisted for three years or during the war,” he toldAmelia. “I am thought a good deal of here.”14 [notes01.html#ch19fn_14a]By mid-April Douglass had sent more than one hundred men off to Readville,Massachusetts, just outside Boston, the training site of the Fifty-Fourth. Hebarnstormed the cities and towns of western New York and the Hudson valley, aswell as made special trips to New York City and Philadelphia to address largerecruiting meetings. It is a telling scene to imagine Douglass standing beforegatherings of blacks, exhorting his people to grasp the opportunity to get gunsand uniforms and go fight. Many of these people had heard Douglass before in achurch or a hall, but never on this subject.Douglass’s listeners were wary and sometimes openly distrustful. Would blacksoldiers really be treated fairly in the Union army? What would happen if theygot sick or were captured? Who would lead them? Men born free in the North hadnever been in the slave states of the South. For people who had lived lives ofskepticism or outright contempt for the federal government, why should theytrust Douglass’s promises? At times, though, the great orator’s appeals topatriotism, flag, and self-interest must have been irresistible. At the end ofsome of his recruiting speeches he broke into song and led the assembled in“John Brown’s Body,” the early versions of which contained the lyrics: “He’sgone to be a soldier in the army of the Lord . . . / His soul’s marching on /John Brown’s knapsack is strapped upon his back / His soul’s marching on!”Douglass invited his audiences to participate, dream, and sing in a story nowboth old and new. Douglass recruited twenty-five men in Syracuse, andtwenty-three more followed him away from Glens Falls, Little Falls, andCanajoharie; the orator personally escorted some of the volunteers all the wayto the Fifty-Fourth’s encampment in Readville. One company, unable to securerail transport, walked 360 miles from Elmira, New York, to Boston. In such smallblack communities this recruitment comprised a relative exodus of men and leftemotions sizzling as well as troubled. In some places Douglass was lesssuccessful—the war had caused near full employment, even among blacks.Privately, Douglass admitted to some hesitation about black enlistment due tothe denial of officer’s status, but for the moment, he told Gerrit Smith, blacks“should hail the opportunity of getting on the United States uniform as a verygreat advance.”15 [notes01.html#ch19fn_15a]Publicly, Douglass counseled, “Action! Action! not criticism . . . words are nowuseful only as they stimulate to blows.” “Men of Color to Arms!” wasmass-produced across the North. Published in a different version as an editorialin the March 1863 issue of the Monthly, the broadside was distinctivelyDouglass’s own. Despite his call to martial action, rhetoric, as always,remained his weapon. He called black men to service almost as an archangel, aGabriel with trumpet, delivering an oracle, calling men to step forward and jointhis epic of their own liberation. Douglass crafted the broadside in tersepronouncements: “TO ARMS! TO ARMS! NOW OR NEVER. This is our golden moment!” Amodel of other such broadsides, the recruiting poster was a manifesto of martialspirit and manliness. He employed the word “manhood” four times and made thecase for enlistment as one of bravery versus cowardice. Douglass asked black mento offer their selfless blood for country, family, and their future “Citizenshipand Equality.” Although Douglass would never lead the volunteers on actualbattlefields (his son Lewis did), it was as if the recruiting speeches allowedhim to deliver his own brand of a St. Crispin’s Day speech: “This story shallthe good man teach his son,” declares Henry V. “. . . We few, we happy few, weband of brothers; / For he today that sheds his blood with me / Shall be mybrother.” In the broadside and in recruiting speeches, Douglass addressed hisaudiences as “Brothers and Fathers”; the war had become a special affair ofblack fraternity and manhood.16 [notes01.html#ch19fn_16a]Image [../images/f0394-01.jpg]“Men of Color to Arms!” Broadside by Frederick Douglass, March 1863, widelymass-produced in many sizes, including a giant banner that hung over a street inPhiladelphia.In his more discursive editorial, Douglass personalized the appeal, askingdirectly for the potential soldiers’ trust in his promises of equal “wages . . .rations . . . equipments” due to his “twenty years of unswerving devotion” tothe cause of abolition. “This is your hour and mine.” He invoked not only thehistory of Massachusetts’ antislavery activism, but especially the great blackheroes. “Remember Denmark Vesey of Charleston; remember Nathaniel Turner ofSouthampton; remember Shields Green and Copeland, who followed noble John Brown,and fell as glorious martyrs.” He reached for their hearts. “The day dawns; themorning star is bright upon the horizon!” sang the messenger. “The iron gate ofour prison stands half open. One gallant rush from the North will fling it wideopen, while four millions of our brothers and sisters shall march out intoliberty.”17 [notes01.html#ch19fn_17a] Here was a biblical vision of a Jubilee,and a prison metaphor as powerful as any others in his writing.At every stop on the recruiting tour Douglass offered volunteers an elaboratelist of reasons to enlist, both practical and emotionally stirring. Thepractical ends included self-defense through learning the “use of arms”;self-respect by demonstrating the courage and manhood of blacks;self-involvement by making their own history and destiny; and finally, theultimate act of self-interest—retribution against slaveholders on behalf oftheir race. Recruiting provided Douglass an enhanced opportunity to vent his ownrage against slaveholders; he could now invite young men to do the work ofslaying them. The long-awaited chance had arrived: “Now the government has givenauthority to . . . black men to shoulder a musket and go down and kill whiterebels.”18 [notes01.html#ch19fn_18a] For so long he had yearned for suchsanctioned killing of slaveholders. Like any clever propagandist, though, hekept his image of the enemy simple, never bothering to acknowledge that mostSouthern soldiers were non-slaveholders.Finally, Douglass demanded that black men strike the blow for citizenshiprights. “To fight for the Government in this tremendous war,” Douglass claimed,“is . . . to fight for nationality and for a place with all other classes of ourfellow citizens.” He tried to sow the deepest seeds of nationalism in hisrecruits by linking black patriots of the Civil War with their whitecounterparts in the American Revolution: “The white man’s soul was tried in1776,” wrote Douglass, “the black man’s is tried in 1863. The first stood thetest, and is received as genuine—so may the last.” Douglass boldly promisedgreat dividends from sacrifice. He contended that once a black man could “getupon his person the brass letters U.S. . . . , an eagle on his button, and amusket on his shoulder, and bullets in his pocket, there is no power onearth . . . which can deny that he has earned the right of citizenship in theUnited States.”19 [notes01.html#ch19fn_19a] Douglass advocated a gallant rush ofblack men into uniform; they were now shining symbols, liberating warriors whoalone made suffering meaningful. Transforming this conflict into a blackpeoples’ war demanded such great leaps of faith, even as sober history inretrospect tells us that sweet reason, moral truth, and blood sacrifice bythemselves have never defeated racism.• • •Lewis and Charles certainly caught the spirit their father preached. Lewis wrotewith pride from Camp Meigs about how the men of the Fifty-Fourth were becoming“proficient in the manual of arms.” With an older brother’s protectivecondescension, he observed that “Charley,” in charge of a company, needed tolearn how “to boss his men around.” Lewis also celebrated how the men were“kicking up their heels” as “cullud persons . . . laughing in ‘our’ peculiarstyle.” For good reason, though, Lewis was worried about his brother. In earlyMay the youthful Charles got into an altercation with another soldier and had tobe restrained. Worse, Charles was sick in the hospital within a week of theregiment’s departure for the South and would be left behind in camp. This begana long pattern of illness, disappointment, and complaint by Charles. On July 6,with his regiment at the front in the sea islands of South Carolina, Charleswrote to his father about yet another altercation he’d experienced with anIrishman who called him a “black nigger” on a street in Boston. “I felt asthough I could whip a dozen Irish,” said the immature eighteen-year-old soldierboy who felt lost and abused in his troubled adventure.20[notes01.html#ch19fn_20a]The Douglass boys’ father came for day visits at Camp Meigs during twoconsecutive weeks in May and was “much pleased” at Lewis’s appearance. Accordingto one observer, during a visit Douglass gave “one of his . . . soul-stirringaddresses” to the assembled troops. Anna and Rosetta also visited for at least aweek in May, staying with a friend in Boston, and coming out to the camp towatch the troops train every day. This was an extraordinary trip for Anna; itmust have been a special, if bittersweet, joy for her to join in the festival ofgawking tourists who went to watch the black men march and perform with rifles.Above all, Lewis fed his beloved Amelia Loguen a steady diet of patriotism andflorid soldierly devotion. He had read his father’s prose: “Remember that if Ifall that it is in the cause of humanity,” he told his girl in waiting, “that Iam striking a blow for the welfare of the most abused and despised race on theface of the earth.” Lewis dwelt on his possible death, but with a wide-eyedbravado. “Do not think of me enduring hardships, do not think of me grapplingwith that non-respecter of persons Death! Think of me as aiding the gloriouswork of bursting loose those chains which keep the husbands, wives, children,lovers and friends, of millions asunder, as aiding to overthrow a system . . .which degrades millions of human beings.” Eager to go South, Lewis sent Ameliahis photograph, showing him in his blue uniform, and begged her “never to beashamed of it.”21 [notes01.html#ch19fn_21a] The Union army had no more devotedsoldier, especially before seeing combat.For two and a half months in the spring of 1863, the Fifty-Fourth Regimentslowly but surely assembled at Camp Meigs. As their commander, Governor Andrewpersonally selected Robert Gould Shaw, the twenty-five-year-old son of a wealthyNew York–Boston family. His parents, Francis George and Sarah Blake Shaw, wereradical abolitionists. A child of fortune, Shaw had traveled to Europe foreducation as a teenager and attended Harvard from 1856 to 1859, but quit beforegraduating. In his time abroad the youthful Shaw had been a profligate,indulgent party boy and, contrary to his parents, indifferent to if notcontemptuous of abolitionism. At the outbreak of the war, bored in a job givenhim by an uncle in a mercantile business, Shaw enlisted in the Seventh New Yorkmilitia, and then in the Second Massachusetts, in which he served as a firstlieutenant and fought in the battles of Winchester, Cedar Mountain, and Antietamin 1862. At first Shaw turned down the command of the Fifty-FourthMassachusetts; but war and leadership had matured him and he quickly changed hismind and accepted the challenge. In one of his long letters to his father fromthe front, Shaw described the scene around him on the night after the horror atAntietam: “At last, night came on . . . all was quiet. The crickets chirped, andthe frogs croaked, just as if nothing unusual had happened all day long, andpresently the stars came out bright, and we lay down among the dead, and sleptsoundly until daylight. There were twenty dead bodies within a rod of me.” Oncepromoted to colonel, Shaw took to his new appointment commanding the blackregiment with genuine zeal; when he barked out orders, his matured voice carriedthe grim weight of those scenes at Antietam. The training at Readville was attimes notoriously tough and the discipline rigid.22 [notes01.html#ch19fn_22a]By the middle of May the regiment’s ranks were full. On May 18, several specialtrain cars carried a host of dignitaries on the Providence and Boston line downto Readville for the Fifty-Fourth’s presentation of colors. Douglass joined hisold disaffected mentors William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, amongnumerous Boston abolitionists. Whether the two rival editors actually had muchconversation is not recorded; Garrison had now become a robust supporter of thewar effort and Lincoln’s Proclamation, an irony Douglass enjoyed. With theentire regiment drawn up in ranks and a large crowd watching, Governor Andrewdelivered a long, deeply Christian speech. As he presented to Shaw theregimental and American flags, Andrew instructed the men in their “sacredcharge.” The whole world would be watching them vindicate their race. They wereto fight not merely for state and country, but for humanity and for “thereligion of our Lord itself.” Their mission would only “fail when the lastpatriot, the last philanthropist, and the last Christian shall have tasteddeath.” In words oft quoted since in melodramatic depictions of this famousregiment’s destiny, the governor declared the highest stakes: “I know not, Mr.Commander, where, in all human history, to any given thousand men in arms therehas been committed a work at once so proud, so precious, so full of hope andglory as the work committed to you.” The stakes were high; in camp, LewisDouglass wondered again after the ceremony about whether he would ever come homealive, adding tersely that the governor would never “have reason to regret thesteps he has taken in raising the regiment.”23 [notes01.html#ch19fn_23a] Warstories begin but rarely end with flag ceremonies.On May 28, the regiment arrived early in the morning in Boston for their publicdeparture for South Carolina. Led by a spritely band and with Shaw on horsebackat their lead, the men of the Fifty-Fourth marched a circuitous route of Bostonstreets. Thousands lined the route, cheering and waving flags. As the regimentpassed the house of Wendell Phillips, Garrison stood on its balcony, his handresting on a bust of John Brown. As they passed 44 Beacon Street, with itsbalcony graced by Shaw’s mother, four sisters, and newly married wife, Annie,Shaw halted and kissed his sword. He had learned theater and romance as well aswar. The troops turned left into Boston Common at Charles Street and formallyparaded for nearly an hour in front of a viewing stand. As huge crowds of peopleroared huzzahs on all sides, some waving handkerchiefs and others a souvenircontaining the Byron quote “Those who would be free, themselves must strike thefirst blow,” the Fifty-Fourth exited the Common and marched to the BatteryWharf, with the band playing “John Brown’s Body.”24 [notes01.html#ch19fn_24a]No one who witnessed this event would ever forget what they saw that day: athousand smartly stepping black men with Enfield rifles, leaning forwardgracefully, moving as one body toward history, heroism, and death to prove totheir slaveholding country that they were indeed truly men. The witnesses wereprivileged to see not only what would become an iconic moment of Americanmilitary history, but a spectacular, if genuinely tragic, illustration of boththe agony and the potential transcendence of this Second Revolution. Some familymembers and friends mingled with the soldiers at the dock as they prepared toboard the big new steamer De Molay. Douglass himself joined the state’s adjutantgeneral, William Schouler, and a few others on board the ship and rode with themen out until it had almost cleared Boston Harbor. At nearly dusk, thefather-civilian could go no farther, said his emotional farewells to his sonLewis, as well as to many other men he had recruited, and was assisted down ontoa tugboat that returned him to shore.25 [notes01.html#ch19fn_25a] Each man onthat ship had his own private joys and fears to ponder. As Frederick and LewisDouglass watched each other fade into the harbor’s dimming light, their mindsand hearts swelled with the unspeakable love and dreadful anxiety that warcreates in fathers and sons. The great man of words left us no statement of histhoughts that memorable night.On June 3, the De Molay arrived in the vicinity of Hilton Head Island and madeits way up the Port Royal inlet. Early on the morning of June 4, the regimentcame ashore in Beaufort, South Carolina, a beautiful town now occupied by Unionforces and officials. The men of the Fifty-Fourth spent several days bivouackedat Beaufort, now a teeming depot of war, working essentially as laborers. Lewisreveled that in this hub of military activity he met not only Robert Smalls, thefamous former slave who had stolen and piloted a Confederate boat out ofCharleston to freedom, but Harriet Tubman herself, who, as Lewis put it, “is acaptain of a group of men who pilot the Union forces into the enemy’s country.”Soon the regiment was dispatched to St. Simons Island on the Georgia coast,where they became embroiled in a brutal and controversial attack on the town ofDarien. The Fifty-Fourth, against Shaw’s vehement protests, were ordered todestroy and burn houses and resources in the town. Lewis tried to write soberlyabout such duty but failed. They “could discover no enemy,” he reported, andlifted a fortune in goods from private houses. “The women we left after burningevery building or shelter in the place to the ground. I felt a little sympathyfor the feminines.” Southern newspapers called the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts“accursed Yankee vandals” and “cowardly . . . negro thieves.”26[notes01.html#ch19fn_26a]The Fifty-Fourth’s young commander chafed to get his men into combat next towhite troops to prove their skill and bravery. The regiment spent at least threeweeks encamped on St. Simons, with rations dwindling, and morale damaged bybizarre rumors that the government was going to take their rifles away and armthem only with pikes. Finally, on July 9–11, they were transported to JamesIsland at Charleston Harbor. Union forces under General Quincy A. Gillmore begana constant bombardment of Fort Wagner, which guarded the entrance to the harborand therefore to the prize itself, Charleston. While on picket duty at dawn onJuly 16, the Fifty-Fourth was frontally attacked by approximately nine hundredConfederates. They had to retreat, but ultimately held their ground valiantly inthis their first combat action. On that day they lost fourteen killed, eighteenwounded, and thirteen missing. Lewis survived unhurt. Shaw was ordered to bringhis men as quickly as possible across mudflats and swamps for an impendinginfantry assault on Battery Wagner, an impregnable, well-armed fortress built ofpalmetto logs, stone, sand dunes, and abatis near the northern tip of MorrisIsland, with Fort Sumter and the mouth of the great harbor looming behind it.27[notes01.html#ch19fn_27a]Marching for eight hours overnight, often in a relentless thunderstorm, onwooden planks and in swamp water to their knees, the regiment reached a safeopen beach where they rested. By the night of the seventeenth a steamer ferriedthem across an inlet onto Morris Island, where they could see their challenge.Asked if he wanted his men to lead the assault Shaw gladly assented. One ofGillmore’s generals was heard to say, “Put those d__d negroes from Massachusettsin advance, we may as well get rid of them, one time or another.” Shaw looked athis exhausted, hungry, but determined men and, in the early evening of July 18,at about six hundred yards from the fort, ordered the black soldiers to form twolines of battle, fix bayonets, and lie on the sand. With the sound of the oceanwaves lapping up just to their right, the men scratched notes and letters, toldone another where and to whom to send them if they died, and prepared for theirhour of truth. Shaw said to his second-in-command, Ned Hallowell, “I shall go inadvance of the men with the National Flag. . . . It will give the men somethingto rally round. We shall take the fort or die there.” Shaw stepped out front atabout 7:45 p.m. and gave an order with a firm voice: “Move in quick time untilwithin a hundred yards of the fort, then double quick and charge!” His menshouted a war cry and rose to their feet as Shaw turned, drew his sword, andcried, “Forward!” Many white soldiers in the other thirteen regiments that hadassembled for the attack, as well as some Northern journalists standing off on asand dune, cheered with respect as the black men led the way.28[notes01.html#ch19fn_28a]As darkness fell and Shaw and the first members of the unit came close to thefort’s guns, Confederates opened a horrifyingly destructive fire. Men screamed,spun, and fell dead and wounded all around into potholes caused by earlierartillery fire, and into the seawater of a moat immediately beneath the parapet.Somehow Shaw and some men trailing him, including Lewis Douglass (survivorsremembered hearing his booming voice urging his fellows on), clambered up ontothe parapet. Men saw Shaw wildly waving his sword and exhorting them on; he washit as he leaped into the fort. Nearly half the regiment made it into the fort,fought hand to hand with Confederates, stabbing and smashing one another withrifle butts and bayonets. The Fifty-Fourth held the fort’s southeast salient fora short, thrilling time before being driven out and back into the darkness andcarnage of the beach and ocean waves. It was all over in a little more than onefrightful hour. “Our men fell like grass before a sickle,” one surviving officerrecounted. But they had performed the immortal “one gallant rush” Douglass hadcalled them to deliver. Of the 600 members of the regiment who stormed acrossthe beach, 272 were officially killed, wounded, or captured among the more than1,500 Union troops who fell that night.29 [notes01.html#ch19fn_29a]Miraculously, Lewis made it out of the fight alive. Less than forty-eight hourslater, still on Morris Island, he wrote to Amelia with a chastened butremarkable spirit: “Not a man flinched. Men fell all around me. A shell wouldexplode and clear a space twenty feet, our men would close up again.” Shockedbut determined, Lewis offered a common sentiment of soldiers down through theages who had seen the hell of war. “How I got out of that fight I cannot tell,but I am here. . . . Remember if I die I die in a good cause. I wish we had ahundred thousand colored troops we would put an end to this war.” That samenight, Lewis wrote to his parents to assure them he was among the lucky. “Icannot write in full,” he reported, still expecting counterattacks and listeningto shells fly overhead. “We made the most desperate charge of the war on FortWagner,” he said, Douglass likely reading the letter aloud to Anna, “losing inkilled, wounded and missing three hundred of our men. The splendid Fifty-Fourthis cut to pieces.” Lewis reported the desperate camp myth that Shaw was onlywounded and a prisoner, and that all other officers except eight were lost. “Ihad my sword sheath blown away while on the parapet of the Fort. The grape andcanister shell . . . swept us down like chaff, still our men went on and on, andhad we been properly supported we would have held the fort, but the white troopscould not be made to come up.” Lewis signed off in a terrible, witheringexpression of why he had followed his father’s call to go to war: “Good bye toall. If I die tonight I will not die a coward. Good bye.” The elder Douglassprinted the letter in the August Monthly without comment.30[notes01.html#ch19fn_30a] Sometimes the great man’s silence, though frustrating,possessed its own eloquence. The profound heroism of Fort Wagner was best leftto an eyewitness Douglass, the fortunate son still alive in the marshes andblistering heat of Morris Island.Image [../images/f0402-01.jpg]Lewis H. Douglass, Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, c. 1863.Soon Lewis, like multitudes all across the North, would know that Shaw had beenthrown with some of his men into a mass grave in the sand in front of FortWagner. Shaw became an instantaneous patrician martyr for the cause of blackfreedom; over time, in poetry, music, and bronze, he emerged as an iconic symbolof the emancipationist memory of the Civil War.31 [notes01.html#ch19fn_31a] Thesiege of Charleston would continue for another year and a half. Survival fromwounds was only one crisis the men of the Fifty-Fourth and all other blacksoldiers faced that summer. They now fought, suffered from disease, and diedunder the weight of brutal discriminations.• • •In June 1863, the War Department added insult to injury in its treatment ofblack soldiers. To the denial of commissions, it added the policy of unequalpay. White privates were paid $13 per month, while blacks were to receive $10,from which $3 would be deducted to cover the expense of clothing. Such a policywas shabbily justified on the grounds that the Militia Act of 1862 had empoweredthe president to enlist black troops at a standard of $10; previous solemnpledges of equality by Secretary of War Stanton, Governor Andrew, and numerousgenerals and recruiting agents such as Douglass were simply disregarded.32[notes01.html#ch19fn_32a]As black enlistment moved into the border states and the Deep South, resistanceto unequal pay swelled. Whole units of black troops began to refuse payaltogether while it remained unequal; some regiments, including the Fifty-FourthMassachusetts, accepted no wages at all well into 1864. This bitter realitycaused desperate problems for impoverished black families back home in Northerncommunities and in freedmen’s camps. Noncommissioned officers were especiallyangered when they realized that the highest-ranking black sergeant (such asLewis Douglass) earned less than a white private. Letters and petitions fromoutraged black soldiers poured into the offices of Stanton, Lincoln, and stategovernors (especially Andrew). James Gooding, a corporal in the Fifty-Fourth,wrote an especially eloquent appeal to the president in September. Gooding toldLincoln that he and his comrades had been “obedient . . . , patient, and solidas a wall.” “Now your Excellency,” he wrote with the sacrifice at Fort Wagner inmind, “we have done a Soldier’s Duty, Why can’t we have a Soldier’s pay?”Sergeant George E. Stephens, a Philadelphian, became a kind of officialspokesman for the men of the Fifty-Fourth in his regular letters to the weeklyAnglo-African. In early August 1863, he denounced unequal pay as the “Lincolndespotism.” Anger erupted into violent confrontations between officers andenlisted men, insubordination, and genuine mutiny in the Fifty-Fourth and manyother regiments by early 1864. Indeed, some protests ended in courts-martial insome units and executions by firing squads for refusal to perform duty withoutequal pay.33 [notes01.html#ch19fn_33a]These direct appeals to the highest power spoke of the anguish of betrayal anddeprivation, as well as the spirit of citizenship. The situation caused Douglass“deep sadness and discouragement.” In a pattern so old and agonizing, historyonce again giveth profound change while racism waited in the wings and taketh itback. Douglass eventually found the words to express such agony: “It reallyseems that nothing of justice, liberty or humanity can come to us except throughtears and blood.”34 [notes01.html#ch19fn_34a]Prior to the government’s enactment of the unequal-pay policy, Douglass hadsteadfastly maintained that blacks should enlist despite the denial ofcommissions. Although ambivalent, he was ready to reconcile the inequality withthe old argument that blacks faced two enemies—Southern slavery and Northernracism. “We shall be fighting a double battle,” he said repeatedly, “againstslavery at the South and against prejudice and prescription at the North.”Blacks should not let one enemy prevent them from thwarting or destroying theother. They should “expect annoyance, but let no man hold back on thisaccount. . . . A half loaf is better than no loaf.”35 [notes01.html#ch19fn_35a]But by midsummer 1863, the struggle was no longer a mere annoyance and theword-master recruiter knew it.The idea of a “double battle” formed a constant theme in Douglass’s wartimethought. George Stearns employed the same notion, persistently arguing to youngvolunteers, “You must fight . . . to obtain the right to fight on terms ofequality.” But for men who bought into the argument initially, the bold-faced,flagrant character of the inequality they faced at the front made it impossibleto abide while risking their lives for a vague hope of justice later. Douglasshad admitted in April speeches that black enlistment had come about by a “tardy,back-door manner” and that his own “blood boiled at the discriminations,” evenas he urged black men to join up.36 [notes01.html#ch19fn_36a]On July 6, in Philadelphia, at a rally where he made a last attempt to reconcileenlistment with discrimination, Douglass tried to chart a pragmatic course. Buthe found tiptoeing around the inequality issue no longer tenable; few men cameforward from the huge crowd of five thousand in National Hall. The appallingcasualty numbers from the Battle of Gettysburg, fought only ninety miles west ofPhiladelphia, had reached the audience by the time Douglass addressed them. Onlya week later, draft riots broke out in New York City, in which at least a dozenblacks were murdered and many more injured. Douglass was still in Philadelphia,working among black troops at the huge Camp William Penn, when the New Yorkviolence began. He managed, with the aid of a friend, probably Ottilie Assing,to travel by train through Newark and New York to the Hudson River Railroad andon to Rochester, narrowly escaping rampaging mobs. Douglass had faced manyviolent mobs before, but these, he recollected, were “something more andsomething worse. . . . They were the fire of the enemy opened in the rear of theloyal army.” These were mobs not merely throwing brickbats; they were intent onlynching black people. Perhaps most disheartening of all, the Confederatesecretary of war, James A. Seddon, had ordered the death penalty for blacksoldiers taken as prisoners, followed by the Confederate Congress’sauthorization for treating captured blacks and their white officers asinsurrectionists, thus subject to death.37 [notes01.html#ch19fn_37a] Thus 1863was indeed a year of revolution and counterrevolution.Image [../images/f0405-01.jpg]Camp William Penn, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, late 1863, Eighty-EighthPennsylvania Regiment. Douglass spoke and recruited here; the camp was arendezvous for United States Colored Troops units, near the North PennsylvaniaRailroad. Stereo photograph.The Union government’s lack of response to these inhumane policies angeredDouglass even further. Sometime in late July, after the news from Fort Wagner,he penned two editorials in which he attacked Lincoln’s silence on the killingsof black prisoners and the threats of their enslavement. He now had to squarehis own son’s heroism and that of his comrades, dead and alive, withConfederate, and apparently federal, disregard for their very humanity. “Theslaughter of blacks taken as captives,” wrote an outraged Douglass, “seems toaffect him [Lincoln] as little as the slaughter of beeves for the use of hisarmy.” The editor-recruiter-father wanted an eye for an eye—one Confederate putto death for every black soldier killed as a prisoner of war. Like most Northernleaders, Lincoln had little stomach for this kind of retaliation, but the appealdid not go unanswered. Three days after Fort Wagner, the president issued aretaliatory order that contained a one-for-one policy, one rebel soldier put todeath for each “soldier of the United States” executed, and one put to hardlabor for every Union soldier sold into slavery.38 [notes01.html#ch19fn_38a] Thecruel war had escalated to a new scale of savagery.By August 1, not yet aware of the retaliatory order, a furious Douglass inprotest quit recruiting and weighed his options. In an official letter toStearns, he declared a duty to his people, especially those he had enlisted, “toexpose their wrongs and plead their cause.” Douglass abruptly switched hats,temporarily ceasing his role as a war propagandist and recruiting agent whilereturning to the role of black leader. His faith in national leadership was“nearly gone.” “When I plead for recruits,” he told Stearns, “I want to do itwith all my heart, without qualification. I cannot do that now.” Douglass atonedfor his promises of equal treatment in the army and admitted to helping foster a“false estimate” of the Union government’s generosity. He seemed not onlydiscouraged, but even exhausted and confused. His zigzag on the inequality issueno doubt reflected the strain of constant travel and recruiting beforeincreasingly reluctant audiences. Moreover, the presence of his sons at the warfront may have curbed his enthusiasm. In a letter to a white friend, MarthaGreene, Douglass described his sons as fighting “with halters about theirnecks.” Greene, whose own son had been wounded in the war, wrote back expressingher sympathy for the orator as a black parent. “The white mothers and fathersthink it hard to send our sons to fight, with every assurance of theirprotection,” said Mrs. Greene, “how little we know the depth of earnestness itmust require in you to send yours.” Such depths had been a constant tension nowfor many months in Douglass’s family. Fort Wagner now loomed large in Douglass’sconscience, which he made movingly clear to Stearns: “How many 54ths must be cutto pieces, its mutilated prisoners killed, and its living sold into slavery,before Mr. Lincoln shall say: ‘Hold, enough!’ ”39 [notes01.html#ch19fn_39a]Stearns did not allow his most prominent recruiter to step aside easily withsuch cries in the night. He sent Douglass the news of Lincoln’s retaliatoryproclamation and urged Douglass to go to Washington and present the blacksoldiers’ grievances directly to the president. On August 9–10, Douglass tookthe B&O train south through Baltimore to the nation’s capital. Although he neverleft the cars, traveling alone, it marked the first time he had returned to aslave state and to the city from which he had escaped in 1838. Poignant memoriessurely flowed in his weary mind on the overnight train. As he stepped out inWashington only a few blocks from the Capitol, the city gave the impression ofone large wartime hospital. The streets swarmed with troops and militaryvehicles, while thousands of escaped slaves trying to forge secure lives withoutadequate housing and food appeared all around as the well-attired,forty-five-year-old Douglass strode up Pennsylvania Avenue toward the ExecutiveMansion.40 [notes01.html#ch19fn_40a] The Revolution was both ugly and thrilling.Douglass had no invitation from the White House, but he did have contacts,especially Senator Samuel Pomeroy of Kansas, who had agreed to help. They firstwent to the War Department, where Douglass and his portly senatorial guide werepromptly admitted in the early morning to see Secretary Edwin Stanton. With hiswire glasses and his long beard hanging down on his chest, Stanton was allbusiness and no small talk. “Politeness was not one of his weaknesses,” Douglassrecollected of Stanton. His “brusqueness” seemed to fill the air of the office,as if “he might turn his back on me as a bore at any moment.” The visitor gotright to the point, and Stanton engaged in a full thirty-minute discussion aboutthe plight of black soldiers. Douglass instructed Stanton about the “Negrocharacter.” Too many people think blacks are either “angel” or “demon,” Douglasssaid, but they ought not be viewed in extremes. Some are “brave and otherscowardly,” some “ambitious” and “another part quite otherwise.” Douglassprotested in no uncertain terms the unequal “pay and place” for black troops,putting the secretary on the defensive to the extent that he confessed fullverbal support for equality. Douglass backed off for comity’s sake, saying thatblacks should still fight because they “had a cause quite independent of pay orplace.” Before leaving, Stanton surprised Douglass by declaring that he wantedthe orator to go to the Mississippi River valley and join General Lorenzo Thomasas an adjutant in recruiting and organizing black troops. “Sufficient papers”(an appointment as a commissioned officer) would soon be forthcoming. No smiles,and only quick handshakes, were necessary as the flattered Douglass, withPomeroy in tow, exited the War Department.41 [notes01.html#ch19fn_41a]At Stanton’s instruction they next visited Secretary of the Interior John Usherto receive Douglass’s “pass” to go south through army lines. Usher signed it ina beautiful hand, after which Pomeroy also added his signature boldly justbelow. The pass read, “Frederick Douglass is known to us as a loyal, free man,and is, hence, entitled to travel unmolested. We trust he will be recognizedeverywhere as a free man and a gentleman.” As the men departed the InteriorDepartment, they had a chance encounter with Postmaster General MontgomeryBlair, who also wanted in on the special identity document for the former slave.He too signed his name to the bottom of the letter with the inscription “Passthis bearer, Frederick Douglass, who is known to be a free man.”42[notes01.html#ch19fn_42a] No one ever wrote Douglass a pass to get out ofslavery. Now the government’s highest officials were signing on to pronouncethis black man free. One wonders if Douglass could hardly contain laughter atthe irony of Blair, the nemesis of less than a year ago who had insultinglytried to enlist Douglass to oversee the administration’s colonization schemes,now falling all over himself in a government hallway to endorse the same man togo find former slaves to put in uniform. At times Douglass’s life must haveseemed to him like a hundred rickety bridges held together with wire made ofirony. He could not know for sure if those signatures were sincere or merely ameans to keep him moving through hallways and out of Washington. Keep the blackman running is an old mantra in America.But Douglass had one more conversation to have and one more signature to secure.He and Pomeroy walked to the White House and joined the daily line of patronageseekers. The editor gave his card to an attendant and sat down on the stairsexpecting a long wait. To his great surprise, Douglass was quickly ushered pastthe chagrined crowd of white men in front of him, at least one of whom mutteredsomething about a “nigger.” Time and events would soften and sentimentalizeDouglass’s memory of this signal moment: “I shall never forget my firstinterview with this great man.” In the coming months, Douglass turned aremembrance of the interview into a classic performance. In December 1863, heentertained an audience of prominent abolitionists with a rather flatulenttelling of his presidential visit. He spoke jokingly about how he had alwaysbeen warned about traveling too near to the slave border states. “I can go downthere now,” said Douglass, garnering applause. “I have been down there to seethe President.” He knew his listeners could not resist hearing how a president“received a black man at the White House.” As though he were converting thisdeeply symbolic historic moment into instant folklore, Douglass made hisaudience laugh as well as feel lumps in their throats. The meeting was “just asyou have seen one gentleman receive another; with a hand and a voicewell-balanced between a kind cordiality and a respectful reserve. I tell you Ifelt big there!”43 [notes01.html#ch19fn_43a]“Big” indeed. In reality, Douglass was awed by Lincoln. But the story had onlybegun; a lifetime of making himself into a character now blossomed becauseDouglass had found the ultimate counterpart actor—at least in the power theother character represented. Douglass had finally made it to the inner sanctumof American power, to the headquarters where this apocalyptic war was conducted,to “the head man,” as he put it, “of a great nation.” Here was the authority hehad spent so much energy and time attacking and trying to influence. He relishedtelling the tale of “getting to him,” of “elbowing” his way up the stairway pastall the angry white office seekers, as “the only dark spot among them.” Douglasshad his audience gasping with laughter as he related, with a lightness of being,the scene in the messy office full of papers and hustling aides. “The Presidentwas sitting in his usual position, with his feet in different parts of the room,taking it easy.” Douglass then shouted to a reporter, milking laughs into aroar, “Don’t put this down, I pray you. I am going down there again tomorrow!”Then Douglass reached the punch line of the tale. As the two men approached, thepresident “began to rise, and he continued rising until he stood over me,”Douglass declared while shrinking under the imaginary hulking Lincoln. The twoshook hands firmly as Lincoln uttered, “Mr. Douglass, I know you; I have readabout you, and Mr. Seward has told me about you.” With the visitor feeling “atease,” the two men got down to business with Lincoln listening intently asDouglass entered his grievances.44 [notes01.html#ch19fn_44a]Douglass’s later recollections of this meeting, though romanticized andvainglorious, square with his immediate report. Only two days after the visit,he told Stearns that he fully understood why Lincoln was called “Honest”Abraham, and that he had “never seen a more transparent countenance.” Douglassthanked the president for his retaliatory order while also pushing for equal payand commissions. Lincoln had responded frankly to “vindicate his policyrespecting the whole slavery question and especially that in reference toemploying colored troops.” The chief executive did not equivocate and firmlydefended himself against the charge of “tardiness, hesitation,” and“vacillation,” of which Douglass had personally accused him. Douglass quotedLincoln, “I think the charge cannot be sustained. No man can say that havingonce taken the position I have contradicted it or retreated from it.” Lincolnargued that with the retaliatory order, as with emancipation itself, he alwayshad to weigh “public popular prejudice” first, and that his paramount job wasthe “necessary preparation of the public mind” for such enactment.45[notes01.html#ch19fn_45a]Lincoln further told Douglass that the bitter inequality black troops faced was“a necessary concession” for them to serve at all. These were not the sentimentsDouglass had hoped to hear; he swallowed the painful reminder that policy hadbeen the handmaiden of racism. But he told Stearns that he found Lincoln’sdecency and forthrightness gratifying and that he left the meeting feelingassured that the melancholy man in charge would “stand firm,” that “slaverywould not survive the war and that the country would survive both slavery andthe war.” In this stunning encounter, Douglass had been disarmed to an extent byhis host’s unpretentiousness and received a political education of a kind;Lincoln too had perhaps learned something of how a black leader felt about thewar for their future and the inhumanities they endured to fight it. Thepresident might also have sensed for future reference how this brilliant radicalpragmatist sitting with him that morning might be useful to the nation’ssurvival. It is equally possible that the burdened and wily Lincoln could haveplayed Douglass to get rid of an immediate problem. As Lincoln lounged in hischair in familiar surroundings, though, amid the terrible anxiety of the war,the son of an Indiana dirt farmer surely understood in some fleeting moment thathe had helped the most famous former slave and free black man in America feel“big” in the president’s mansion. Would that Lincoln had lived to tell of it inhis own performative way in a memoir. As he was leaving, Douglass told Lincolnof Stanton’s invitation for him to go south as a recruiter and showed his pass.Lincoln read the document with the signatures, turned it in his hand, and wroteon its side, “I concur. A. Lincoln. Aug. 10, 1863.”46 [notes01.html#ch19fn_46a]Douglass ended his “flying visit,” as he called it, and took the afternoon trainout of Washington. He left believing he had a promise of a commission in the USarmy from Stanton, who may have been more adept at getting the abolitionistvisitor out of his office than at sincerity. With a new excitement Douglassreturned to Rochester and quickly decided to cease publication of his newspaper,rushing a final “Valedictory” issue into print. Ending the paper that had been acenter to his life for sixteen years involved emotions he could hardly express.His new prospect of going South (he thought, with an officer’s rank) feltdaunting. His decision was not “dictated by love of change or adventure. Mystability is quite equal to that of most men. My paper ends its existence in thesame room on the same street where it began.” Along with his ubiquitous oratoryand his autobiographical writings, editor was the only professional vocation hehad ever known. He did hear from Stanton, receiving orders to report to GeneralThomas in Vicksburg, Mississippi; Douglass’s transportation would come atgovernment expense. But to his great disappointment, the commission neverarrived. Apparently Stanton (and perhaps Lincoln as well) had second thoughtsabout commissioning a black man. On August 14 Douglass wrote to the WarDepartment, inquiring as to the “conditions” of his service. The reply one weeklater discussed only his remuneration and again instructed him to report toMississippi, where he would be expected to exercise “influence” among thefreedmen.47 [notes01.html#ch19fn_47a]So long practiced at weathering or resisting racial slights, this was one hecould not abide. Without the commission Douglass did not go south. Why did henot budge from Rochester without the commission, and further, why had he notalready enlisted in active service? Certainly his recruiting campaign, paid forby government and private funds (Stearns), had been a form of service. Earlierin the year, the Ohio black abolitionist H. Ford Douglas, who had also lived inCanada and Illinois and supported Delany’s plans for emigration, wrote toDouglass urging him to take the symbolic lead and enlist in the army. H. FordDouglas had himself enlisted in an Illinois regiment, and now he called on thefamous orator to “finish the crowning work of your life, you are the one of allothers.” Douglass disagreed with his colleague, who was a mixed-race formerfugitive slave from Virginia, self-educated, and thirteen years younger.Douglass understood the call to “put down the quill and take up the sword,” hesaid. “But we have no very high opinion of our fighting qualities, and have nomilitary knowledge but we suppose we could fight if cornered.”48[notes01.html#ch19fn_48a] He had fought when cornered many times, but he was nowarrior; with voice and pen, the writer-orator preferred to recruit younger men.In Life and Times, Douglass’s explanation of why he did not go to Mississippiwithout the commission is lame: “I knew too much of camp life and the value ofshoulder straps in the army to go into the service without some visible mark ofmy rank.” Yet this is exactly what he had urged thousands of younger blacks,including his sons, to do. His reaction to Stanton’s initial offer was no doubtsincere; he did end his beloved Douglass’ Monthly. But he may also have simplybeen highly stressed and confused about his priorities. As late as August 19,Douglass told a correspondent of his disappointment that no commission hadarrived; “I shall obey, however, hoping that all will be well in the end.”49[notes01.html#ch19fn_49a] Douglass may have felt as much flattered by hisWashington interviews and the invitation to a commission as he was ever inspiredabout venturing into the Mississippi River valley.Before the end of the month Douglass decided not to obey his “orders” from theWar Department. His best reasons were likely deeply personal. Two sons were inthe daily peril of war, and Frederick Jr. was already in Mississippi laboring asa recruiter (he would soon be back in Rochester, ill and convalescing). Douglasshad to be a father as well as the Union war effort’s fiercest propagandist.Those dual, contradictory roles now collided and forced a reckoning. He oftenreferred to his sons that summer with swelling pride, as if they were hissurrogates at war. They must have felt that way too. He corresponded with themoften, sending them money and loving encouragement. In July 1863, acorrespondent to the Anglo-African called him to task for sending his sons to awar he would not fight himself. Douglass bristled and called the charge“malicious.” He again disclaimed any ability as a soldier. “When came this . . .confidence in me as a warrior? When have I been heard as a military man?” Hefelt no compulsion to enlist until his fellow blacks found someone “to fill myplace at the North.” Irked by the claim that he let his sons do his fighting forhim, he simply replied, “I am proud to refer to my two sons.”50[notes01.html#ch19fn_50a]But the sons were in dire need of help. Charles was still in Boston in Augustand September, alternately sick or complaining bitterly of hunger,ill-treatment, and the general anguish of army life. Under a regimen of workingin an army hospital, he craved an officer’s praise for his labors, but alsoalarmed his parents by noting that he was losing weight: “I fell away like askeleton.” A lonely Charles promised that he “never brought any disgrace uponthe family,” but he insisted that the remnants of the Fifty-Fourth were “treatedworse than dogs” since the full regiment had deployed to the South. He had heardnews that Lewis was “highly spoken of” and might get a commission, but also thathe had fallen sick on Morris Island. By December, Charles was embroiled in alawsuit against someone he alleged had mistreated him.51[notes01.html#ch19fn_51a]Image [../images/f0412-01.jpg]Charles Remond Douglass, member of the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts InfantryRegiment, c. 1863.Lewis had been more badly injured at Fort Wagner than he had initially let on.On August 15, he wrote to Amelia complaining of terrible headaches. As artilleryshells were “flying and whizzing in our front,” Lewis moved to the “Sick andWounded Hospital No 6” in Beaufort, directed by the “irrepressible” HarrietTubman. By August 27 he reported that he felt a little better, but writing froma “water soaked tent,” he was still ill. As Union artillery sustained a dailybombardment of Forts Wagner and Gregg on the marshy island and Sumter in theharbor, the Fifty-Fourth were part of the troops who continued to dig ditchesand trenches up the beach, right to the face of Wagner. Again, Lewis reflectedon death with austere fatalism: “Death must be dealt out and must be received.Some of us will live to see rebellion crushed and some of us will die crushingit. Either is glorious.” On September 6–7, Fort Wagner was finally evacuatedafter weeks of bombardment and much loss of life on both sides. Given his badhealth, Lewis likely was not part of the victorious group that occupied the hugeheap of destruction. Henry Gooding of the Fifty-Fourth was appalled by what hefound: “The smell in Wagner was sickening, dead men and mules are profuse, someexposed to the rays of the sun, and others being half buried by earth thrownover them by our shot and shell during the bombardment.” The men of theFifty-Fourth had now seen many weeks of the horror and the refuse of mangledhumanity that war wrought.52 [notes01.html#ch19fn_52a]George Stephens also reported the glorious fall of Fort Wagner and noted thatsome furloughs had been granted for the first time for the Fifty-Fourth. Amongthose heading north on a steamer by the second week of September was LewisDouglass, who had become very sick. While Lewis suffered at an army hospital inNew York in September and early October, his father arranged for his dear friendand doctor James McCune Smith to examine him. Whether due to battle wounds orgeneral camp exposure, Smith diagnosed Lewis on October 6 with “gangrene of lefthalf of Scrotum,” and for the time being, unfit for service. With Ottilie Assingpossibly at his side, Douglass hurried to New York, and as he reported to GerritSmith he spent “the last three weeks bending over the sick bed” of his ailingson. The father was proud that the son’s furlough was granted for “good conductin the field.” Lewis recovered later at home in Rochester in his mother’s careand would be discharged from the army in February 1864. He eventually marriedAmelia Loguen in 1869, but the war-ravaged romantic recruit of spring 1863, whoalso nurtured a lifetime pride in his service, never conceived children.53[notes01.html#ch19fn_53a] Other than expressing fierce pride, Douglass neverbetrayed any of his feelings from those weeks of hovering over Lewis’s bedside,nor from any visits to other wounded men in that hospital. Douglass kept hisfears, as well as any guilt in his heart, private.• • •Douglass was a reformer, not a soldier. As an adjutant, recruiting refugeefreedmen from cotton plantations in Mississippi, he may have envisioned himselfa fish out of water or stultified under a general’s orders—since leaving theGarrisonians, he had never operated under anyone else’s direction. How could hecontinue to reach the widest possible audiences and touch the highest levels ofpower in Washington if he relocated to Vicksburg? Douglass received a great dealof reinforcement for his self-image as black symbol and spokesman. No doubt, ifgiven a voice, Anna would have opposed the move south. Certainly Ottilie Assingdid not want the object of her obsessive concern journeying off to the warfronts of Dixie either. Most of all, Douglass heard forcefully from his Britishfriends, especially Julia Crofts, as he also continued to receive theirfinancial support. Crofts vehemently discouraged his plans to give up the paperand especially pleaded with him not to join the army. Douglass had writtenearlier in the year about an interest in enlisting if the State of New Yorkwould guarantee equal rights. “By everything dear to you my friend,” Croftsresponded, “do not take any commission that leads you personally into thefighting ranks . . . never go South—or killed you most assuredly will be . . .you are a marked man.” Julia’s wise advice may have weighed on him as herejected the assignment in the South. She had left this ringing plea in hisears: “The pen is ever greater than the sword—the head is greater than thehand—your work is with your pen and tongue.” By December, his dearest Englishfriend wrote of her relief that “the dangerous task of recruiting in the Southis given up,” but she lamented the newspaper, and wondered how he would carry onhis mission without it.54 [notes01.html#ch19fn_54a]In November, President Lincoln went to the ravaged town of Gettysburg todedicate a cemetery for the unprecedented numbers of dead on that battlefield. Astaggering nearly six thousand had been killed between July 1 and 3 on the twosides, with over twenty-seven thousand wounded and almost twelve thousandmissing. Lincoln too gave a new speech; he had long worked on or conjured thecentral themes he would address in his short masterpiece delivered on November19. In but three paragraphs, he attempted an explanation of the war. As a superbstudent of Lincoln’s rhetoric, Douglas Wilson, has put it, the presidentanswered a huge and terrible question: What was the war about? With astonishingsuccinctness, Lincoln told his countrymen that the old republic had died on thatbattlefield; it was being buried in all the unfinished graves. Out of thebloodletting, the American people, indeed the nation, could experience a “newbirth of freedom.” Popular government as an idea might yet be saved, humanfreedom forged in new definitions, and even that most vexing Enlightenment ideaof all, “equality,” launched on a new history. The first republic was dyingbefore their eyes; at horrible cost, a new one could yet be achieved.55[notes01.html#ch19fn_55a]That breathtaking metaphor of rebirth in many versions had long been Douglass’sfavorite metaphor as well. He had himself delivered variations of the GettysburgAddress throughout the war. Now, with resounding implications, by the end ofthat terrible year of 1863, Lincoln and Douglass spoke from virtually the samescript, one of them with the elegance and restraint of a statesman, the other,the fiery tones of a prophet. One spoke with an eye on legality and publicopinion, while also listening to his evolving moral self; the other as though hewere the national evangelist.In his annual message of December 8, 1863, Lincoln declared that “the policy ofemancipation . . . gave to the future a new aspect.” This “new reckoning” mightnow remake America into “the home of freedom disenthralled, regenerated,enlarged.” Douglass could not have said it better, but came close. Embarking ona new speaking tour in fall 1863 and winter 1864, he honed one of his greatestspeeches. In “The Mission of the War,” the black leader declared that howeverlong the “shadow of death” cast over the land, Americans should not forget themoral “grandeur” of the struggle. The shuddering scale of death in this war hadto be rendered sacred, Douglass contended in this signature oration, or theslaughter could not be defended. “The mission of this war,” Douglass pronounced,“is National Regeneration.”56 [notes01.html#ch19fn_56a] Together, Lincoln andDouglass, rarely in purposeful tandem and against overwhelming odds, hadprovided the subjunctive and declarative voices of the Second AmericanRevolution—and by the last year of the war, they were nearly the same."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 20--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ABOLITION WAR, ABOLITION PEACEThe most hopeful fact of the hour is that we are now in a salutary school—theschool of affliction. If sharp and signal retribution, long protracted . . . andoverwhelming, can teach a great nation . . . respect for justice, surely we willbe taught now and for all time to come.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, FEBRUARY 1864In Frederick Douglass’s view, during the final year and a half of the Civil Warone America died a violent, necessary death; out of its ashes a second,redefined America came into being amid destruction and explosions of hope. Atwar’s end, Douglass could almost fashion himself as one of the unusual foundersof this emerging second American republic, born in a revolution even bigger thanthe first. As 1864 dragged on, Douglass contemplated the war’s revolutionary andprophetic meaning for himself, his family, his people, and his nation. Theissues of Reconstruction also captured his attention. Douglass sought toconvince everyone of what he believed: the American nation, and history itself,had taken a rare, fundamentally moral turn.Douglass took to the lecture circuit with “The Mission of the War,” his fullestexpression of the war’s meaning. In Philadelphia on December 4, 1863, at thethirtieth-anniversary meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society, Douglassoffered a refutation (in the presence of his old mentor) of William LloydGarrison’s declaration that this might be the final meeting of the organization,now that emancipation had dawned. Announcing that “our work is not done,”Douglass warned of the deep racism within Northern society and in the DemocraticParty. He especially called for black male suffrage. Casting the argument inhumor, Douglass reminded his auditors that the American “body politic” had neverbeen healthy. He had many times seen “Ignorance” trying to vote alongside aswerving man from the street with a “black eye.” And as he was long fond ofsaying, he had seen drunken “Pat, fresh from the Emerald Isle,” stepping up tothe poll, “leaning upon the arms of two of his friends, unable to stand.” Thefranchise would protect blacks in the South, Douglass argued to rousing laughterand applause, from “the jaws of the wolf.” His people ought to be “members ofCongress,” he asserted. “You may as well make up your minds that you have got tosee something dark down that way. There is no way to get rid of it. I am acandidate already!” His Irish jokes notwithstanding, he left the abolitionistscheering as he demanded that they join his plea for an “Abolition war” and an“Abolition peace.”1 [notes01.html#ch20fn_1a]Douglass’s new speaking tour, like so many before, took on the character of atraveling crusade. Within two days he was in Washington, DC, where overconsecutive nights, December 7–8, he delivered the “Mission” speech to overflowcrowds at the African American Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church. More than athousand people, according to a journalist, thronged the church, “jumping overthe fence, some crawling over someone’s back,” jamming the sanctuary, fillingthe aisles, and sitting on the floor. With hats and bonnets falling off allaround, the “glorious conglomeration” anticipated the arrival of the “Africanlion of the antislavery platform,” said the Christian Recorder. Amid shoutingand applause Douglass slowly made his way down the crammed central aisle as theorgan played “The Star-Spangled Banner.” He took the pulpit, told tales of hisemotions while passing through Baltimore on his journey, and made his appeal for“Abolition war” to the finish, a struggle of conquest between “slavery andLiberty.”2 [notes01.html#ch20fn_2a]No one went home disappointed, since the following evening an equally packed andraucous crowd gathered to hear Douglass make his appeal for access to politicalrights, to the ballot box alongside the “drunken Irishman” and the “ignorantDutchman.” Douglass soared rhetorically, calling on the nation to allow blackmen to “swell the body politic” as they helped win the war. The racially mixedaudience all seemed pleased, said the correspondent: “They had seen the greatDouglass.” As the celebrity orator held forth at Fifteenth Street Presbyterianwith his vision of the apocalyptic revolution under way, some dozen blocksdirectly south, President Lincoln, on that same day of December 8, issued hisannual message to Congress, in which he reflected on how the policy ofemancipation had given “to the future a new aspect” and launched “a totalrevolution of labor” throughout the South. Within the same hours, both men,Lincoln with his pen, Douglass with his voice, imagined a nation “regenerated”through bloodshed on battlefields and the social misery in the streetssurrounding them.3 [notes01.html#ch20fn_3a]In the crowd that swarmed around the church where Douglass appeared were manyformer slaves from the surrounding Virginia and Maryland countryside. Washingtonhad become a massive military base, a series of hospitals functioning inchurches, schools, and government buildings, and a massive street-based refugeecamp. In 1862–63, a freedmen’s exodus had rolled into the capital, withthousands of refugees taking up residence in tar-paper shanties, and formersoldiers’ barracks, such as Camp Barker, an old military residence and sometimeprison converted into a tent city at Q and Twelfth Streets, near the current-dayLogan Circle. By war’s end the black population of the District swelled to fortythousand.4 [notes01.html#ch20fn_4a] Douglass saw and likely visited Camp Barkersince it was only four blocks east of the Fifteenth Street Church. Indeed, hemade his “Mission” speaking tour, in part, a fund-raising campaign forcontraband relief organizations.During his stay in Washington, Douglass visited the burgeoning Freedmen’sVillage contraband camp on Arlington Heights across the Potomac River, on theformer estate of Robert E. Lee. His fellow slave-narrative author and formerRochester neighbor Harriet Jacobs worked in that camp and in others around thecity. The “misery” she witnessed there had to “be seen to be believed,” shewrote. Refugees arrived daily from the war fronts of Virginia, and despite theirdestitution as well as the mistreatment many experienced from Union troops, shefound these people “quick, intelligent, and full of the spirit of freedom.”“What but the love of freedom could bring these old people thither?” Jacobsunforgettably asked. During Douglass’s brief visit among the freedpeople inArlington, as he strode for the first time on Virginia’s soil, a small ceremonywas arranged at which a group of children sang for him. Only three days later,his close Rochester friend Amy Post visited the freedmen’s camps in Washington.Post left a detailed description of the Arlington site, met numerous formerslaves of the Lee family, and observed “at the school room . . . FrederickDouglass’s autograph, which was the first intimation that he had visited any ofthe camps.”5 [notes01.html#ch20fn_5a]We do not have Douglass’s account of his own emotions, but he did write tofriends describing the episode. In January 1864 he wrote to Julia Crofts inEngland; she felt thrilled to know that Douglass felt so moved by his “visit toWashington and Arlington Heights—how I should liked to have been an eyewitnessof your visiting those dear . . . little children! & to have heard the singing!”“My eyes would not have been dry!” she continued, marveling at Douglass’s newsof the “slaveholder’s smokehouse being converted into a school house for hisfreed slave children!” So eager were some of Douglass’s British friends for newsof the war and his activities that Julia took his letters out on the circuit tolocal antislavery societies and tried to bolster support and raise money byreading “extracts of your letters relative to the contrabands.” Moreover,Douglass’s voice, in a manner, migrated into Germany in 1864 through the columnsof Ottilie Assing in Morgenblatt. Partly by projecting Douglass’s ideas aboutthe war, as well as with her own keen, radical observations, Assing told herreaders in January that American abolitionists, despite their divisions,represented the “spirit of the nineteenth century” and of “civilized progress.”They represented the “vanguard of the present revolution, as Montesquieu,Voltaire, and Rousseau were the vanguard of the French Revolution.” By March,she considered black regiments marching south the best representation of “agreat revolution.”6 [notes01.html#ch20fn_6a] In her passionate essays, Assingechoed her hero’s mission and emancipation as a world-historical event.Close friends wrote to Douglass wondering when “your mission” would bring theorator to their town. From England, by April, the intrepid Julia Crofts sent £33in contributions to contraband aid, as well as for “F. D.’s Mission,” fromantislavery societies in Edinburgh, Liverpool, Coventry, and Aberdeen. Anotherold British friend, Mary Carpenter, joined Crofts in scolding Douglass forceasing the publication of his paper, upon which British abolitionists dependedso much for news of the cause. She wondered about the fate of the mission andwhere their hero traveled. “We know you live,” she said, “to promote that cause,but others ask what is F. D. doing now that his paper is given up.” Carpentersent a check for £5 and felt resigned to “sympathize affectionately withyou . . . in the painfully exciting life you must now be living.”7[notes01.html#ch20fn_7a]Painful and exciting indeed. Sponsored by the Women’s Loyal League, anorganization advocating a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery, Douglassdelivered the “Mission” speech to a packed house at the Cooper Institute in NewYork on January 13. He led with his millennial vision of the war, filling thehall with a tone of high moral certainty and with arguments both shuddering andhopeful. To Douglass the war in all its destruction was like a terrible,necessary gift from history and from Providence. The South’s rebellion was the“rapid educator” by which the Union leadership moved from “slave-hunting” onbehalf of their enemies to now equipping the Negro with a Springfield rifle.Ever the earnest war propagandist, now in need more than ever, he believed,Douglass minced no words in describing the Confederacy as “a solitary andghastly horror, without a parallel in the history of any nation,” a politicalcrusade of “naked barbarism” in its attempt to give slavery an eternalfoundation. He drew on Psalm 91 to make clear the character of the enemy: theConfederates and their cause “rivaled the earthquake, the whirlwind and thepestilence that walketh in darkness, and wasteth at noonday.” Confederates hadto be met and slaughtered, no matter how “long and sanguinary” the struggle. Theferocity of Douglass’s language knew no limit; acknowledging that he had beenaccused of prolonging the war, his angry answer was “the longer the better if itmust be so.” An audience that may have been a majority of women stood on theirfeet, waved their hats, and shouted approval.8 [notes01.html#ch20fn_8a]In thus sacralizing the killing of Southern soldiers and of the Confederacyitself, Douglass found the war’s meaning. The orator believed he described onlystark facts: time and events, and fierce Southern resistance, had made thecontest an “Abolition war.” Northern Democrats and white Southerners denounced“abolition war” as the inhumane path to sanguinary race war. Both sides feltsomething deeply sacred at stake, and no one more than Douglass. Yes, heacknowledged, the war was for Union and for the Constitution, but it must be awholly new Union, and a new Constitution to replace the old one now torn andtattered. The country must not “put old wine in new bottles,” he argued, normake “new cloth into old garments.” Douglass warned that liberal and open-mindedpeople such as abolitionists themselves were rarely as unified as the forces ofreaction and darkness. But in this historic moment, they had to be. “That oldunion,” he shouted, “whose canonized bones we saw hearsed in death and inurnedunder the frowning battlements of Sumter, we shall never see again while theworld standeth.” Stop fighting for a “dead past,” Douglass urged his auditors,and instead fight “for the living present.”9 [notes01.html#ch20fn_9a] Hereflowed a set of rebirth metaphors flaming, bloody, and much bolder than thesuccinct, if beautiful, suggestion in Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address. “Mission ofthe War” stood as Douglass’s radical abolitionist Gettysburg Address, arhetorical sword into the Confederacy’s heart, and a statement of the war’smeaning as ancient as the Old Testament. Above all it was Douglass’s vision ofthe new founding of an American republic.Douglass ultimately appropriated a common American language to capture themeaning of the war: “We have heard much in other days of manifest destiny. Idon’t go all the lengths to which such theories are pressed, but I do believethat it is the manifest destiny of this war to unify and reorganize theinstitutions of this country—and that herein is the secret of the strength, thefortitude, the persistent energy, in a word the sacred significance of thiswar.” In a line that challenges us still in our moral imagination, Douglass saidthat without the destruction of slavery, the world might view the Civil War asonly “little better than a gigantic enterprise for shedding human blood.”10[notes01.html#ch20fn_10a]Not only had the war delivered the nation a “broken Constitution,” requiring alegal refounding, but history itself had been broken and had to be made anew.Douglass volunteered to lead a generation of new founders. “Events are mightierthan our rulers,” Douglass asserted, and “Divine forces” had decided the missionof the war. The people had to line up, sacrifice, send forth their sons, andperform the sacred duty of holy war. Douglass left his rapt audiences thatwinter of 1864 with a clear, if harsh, message: “I end where I began—no war butan Abolition war; no peace but an Abolition peace; liberty for all, chains fornone; the black man a soldier in war, a laborer in peace; a voter at the Southas well as at the North; America his permanent home, and all Americans hisfellow-countrymen.” In a finale that anticipates Martin Luther King Jr.’s “IHave a Dream” speech a century later, Douglass invoked Isaiah once again: “Such,fellow-citizens, is my idea of the mission of the war. If accomplished, ourglory as a nation will be complete, our peace will flow like a river, and ourfoundations will be the everlasting rocks.”11 [notes01.html#ch20fn_11a]Thousands heard Douglass deliver this speech; those drawn into his voice and hisstory were present at the new creation.• • •Dreams by definition, though, are always unfinished; this was certainly the casefor Douglass’s blood-soaked vision of 1864. Imagining a new, reinvented countrybrought one challenge; but the war remained a very personal affair for Douglassand his family. In the fall of 1863 Rosetta Douglass gave up on her falteringteaching career and her formal education and took a husband. On Christmas Eve inRochester, she married Nathan Sprague, a handsome former fugitive slave fromMaryland who had been working as a gardener at the Douglass home. Rosetta verymuch resembled her mother, including her darker skin. Although unlike hermother, and very much modeling her father, she seemed to embrace having herphotograph taken, especially in elegant earrings. Sprague was lighter and, infamily lore, may have been descended from a Maryland governor, Samuel Sprigg.Over the next eleven years Rosetta and Nathan would have five daughters and oneson. In this tempestuous marriage, Sprague never developed a gainful career andeventually caused financial and legal troubles for his father-in-law. Steadinessand talent were not his forte. Like her mother, though, Rosetta seems to havealmost always stood by her husband. Douglass recruited Sprague into theFifty-Fourth Massachusetts before the wedding, and after living with Rosetta inthe Douglass house on the hill on South Street in the winter months, he joinedthe regiment in the spring of 1864.12 [notes01.html#ch20fn_12a]After recovery from his wounds, Lewis Douglass tried to rejoin his regiment butwas discharged formally on February 29, 1864. By that summer, Lewis traveled onarmy transports back to South Carolina, though not as an active-duty soldier. Hewitnessed the continual bombardment of Fort Sumter from Morris Island and, inAugust, wrote to his father, wishing the “state of New York would give me anappointment to recruit for them I could get a great many men.” In the seaislands Lewis saw the rich harvest of possible black soldiers for the Unionarmy. His brother Frederick Jr. was at that very time in Vicksburg, Mississippi,recruiting among former slaves, witnessing the human and natural ravages of waras he tried to enlist men from cotton plantations. For the twenty-two-year-oldnamesake of his famous father, the world of the cotton kingdom under siege anddevastation represented the revolution the elder Douglass had imagined. Nothingwas more revolutionary than ushering former Cotton Belt slaves into Union blue.Details are elusive about just how Frederick Jr. functioned as a recruiter.Lewis, on the other hand, always had an eye out for how to make money from anycircumstance, telling his father of “offers of partnership in business as asutler” for the army.13 [notes01.html#ch20fn_13a]Charles Douglass, despite his recurring sickness, stayed in the army as long ashe could, still trying to prove his courage and worthiness as a warrior. He wasdischarged from the Fifty-Fourth and transferred to the Fifth MassachusettsCavalry, where he served as a noncommissioned first sergeant. Through the awfulsummer of 1864, the delicate Charles served in Virginia during the early siegeof Petersburg and at Point Lookout in Maryland, located at the southernmost tipof the peninsula on the Western Shore, where it meets the mouth of the PotomacRiver. Charles was now a soldier in the ranks of his dismounted unit, and hefound his own real war. Black units of the United States Colored Troops weresome of the first to occupy the City Point position where the James andAppomattox Rivers meet.14 [notes01.html#ch20fn_14a] City Point soon grew intothe biggest military depot and headquarters of the war. His regiment hadmercifully missed the horrific battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania CourtHouse in May, and they remained at City Point during the disastrous slaughter atCold Harbor, fought just east of Richmond, June 1–3.On May 31, in a letter to his father, Charles expected “to be called into lineof battle every moment,” as he anticipated what became the beginnings of thesiege of the city of Petersburg. With a soldier’s trembling bravado, he told hisfather that “our boys” are “anxious for a fight. . . . As for myself, I am notover anxious, but willing to meet the devils at any moment and take noprisoners.” Luck was Charles’s companion; his unit was kept largely in reserveon guard, picket, and logistical duties. Charles felt especially proud to reportcapturing a rebel prisoner while on picket duty. He also joyfully announced thatthey had brought in a large group of contrabands. He further reported an uglytragedy—their commanding officer “had to shoot one of the men for being drunkand misbehaving, but the bullet hit the wrong man.” Charles dropped this pitifulirony almost as fast as he told it.15 [notes01.html#ch20fn_15a] All theDouglasses learned that this great revolution had an underside of horror,terror, and futility.Later in the summer Charles’s health failed yet again, and he was transferred tothe huge prison and hospital complex at Point Lookout. While stationed along theChesapeake, Charles apparently took a brief leave, crossed the Bay, and went toSt. Michaels, where he became the first member of the Douglass family to connectwith some Bailey cousins. The war crushed one world and reconnected another.What Charles may or may not have known is that his father, who had now developeda relationship with Abraham Lincoln, had written to the president in late Augustasking him to intercede and formally discharge his son from the army. “I hope Ishall not presume too much upon your kindness,” wrote the abolitionist to thecommander in chief, “but I have a very great favor to ask. It is . . . that youwill cause my son Charles R. Douglass . . . to be discharged.” On September 1,the president sent the letter to the War Department with the endorsement “Letthis boy be discharged, A Lincoln.” On September 15 Charles wrote to both of hisparents informing them that he was “honorably discharged [from] the service ofthe United States” and would be home within two weeks.16[notes01.html#ch20fn_16a] Douglass had asked his sons to hear and follow histrumpet, to risk all for the cause of black freedom; now, he also reversedcourse, and with emotions he never fully described, did whatever he could tosave one of them.The summer and fall of 1864 were thus harrowing as well as hopeful months forthe Douglass household in Rochester. They found great cause for personal relief,as both Lewis and Charles were out of the army, at least for the time being, andnot in danger. Nathan Sprague still served with the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts,but Rosetta, pregnant with her first child, resided at home under her mother’swatch and care. Rosetta’s daughter, named Anna Rosine Sprague (called Annie forRosetta’s deceased sister as well as her own mother) was born on November 27,giving the Douglasses their first of what would be twenty-one grandchildren.17[notes01.html#ch20fn_17a] Although she probably retreated more and more now toher kitchen and garden, Anna Douglass happily had a new baby Annie in her house,as her husband, with no editor’s desk to retreat to, pondered and wandered thenew political landscapes of a nation at war.At the beginning of that bloody year, all three Douglass sons and one son-in-lawhad served at the war front in some capacity, while the patriarch himself rodethe rails across the North on his mission to convince multitudes to fight thecruel war to its bitter end. All of Douglass’s children had to imagine their ownnew homes in this time of all-out war and revolutionary change as their fathertried with the words and deeds of a self-styled prophet to influence history andpower in the highest places.• • •In practical terms, what Douglass meant in his “Mission” speech by “abolitionwar” was a military conquest of the South, complete emancipation, continuedenlistment of black soldiers without discrimination, and legal guarantees ofblack freedom and equal rights. An “abolition peace” would mean the subjugationof the Confederacy’s slaveholding and treasonous leadership, full blackcitizenship and enfranchisement, and a strong role for the federal government inprotecting the freedpeople and in reconstructing Southern society. The war, thisdivine “school of affliction,” in Douglass’s words, provided the “signal and thenecessity for a new order of social and political relations among the wholepeople.” Preserving the old Union was but a “miserable dream”; what Douglass thevisionary wanted was a fundamentally new republic.18 [notes01.html#ch20fn_18a]Hence, as early as any Northern politician, he pondered the nature of thepotential postwar Reconstruction.As early as 1862 Douglass counseled his readers to hold no illusions about thedifficulties blacks would face when emancipated. Indeed, the problems of peacesuddenly seemed much greater than the problems of war. If emancipation wasaccomplished, Douglass surmised, it would happen in great violence, and itsaftermath might prompt even greater backlashes of violence. “The sea of thoughtand feeling lashed into rage and fury by the war” might foment a frenzied wrathamong the defeated. After the fighting, Douglass suggested, “will come the timefor the exercise of the highest of all human faculties. A profounder wisdom, aholier zeal, than belongs to the prosecution of war will be required.” Hewondered about uncharted constitutional terrain, about the use of federalauthority in reconstructing state governments. Although he was no more prescientthan the next person, Douglass envisioned Reconstruction as a long ideologicalstruggle. “The work before us is nothing but a radical revolution,” he declaredin an editorial, “in all the modes of thought which have flourished underthe . . . slave system.” A new order could not happen overnight. “There is nosuch thing as immediate Emancipation either for the master or for the slave,” heasserted. The “invisible chains of slavery” might take generations to break,Douglass predicted with an uncanny, tragic foresight.19[notes01.html#ch20fn_19a]Naturally, Douglass’s wartime concern with Reconstruction centered upon thewelfare of the freedmen, and he laid out a paradoxical prescription combiningclassic self-help with outside philanthropy and activist governmentintervention. His early answer to the question of what was to be done with theemancipated slaves was, to “do nothing with them.” “Your doing with them istheir greatest misfortune,” he lectured his fellow countrymen; “just let themalone.” Slavery, he implied, had always been a measure of avaricious, powerfulpeople “doing” too much with and to black people. In language modernantigovernment conservatives, including Supreme Court justice Clarence Thomas,have loved to appropriate and rip out of historical context, Douglass gave hisprescription: “If the Negro cannot stand on his own legs, let him fall. . . .Your interference is doing him positive injury.” In 1862, Douglass expresseddoubts about the freedmen’s relief efforts, although within a year he went onthe lecture circuit to raise money for just such organizations and even donatedhis speaking fees to the cause. Wishing for a world of fairness and merit earlyin the struggle, however, Douglass denounced what he oddly called the “oldclothes system of benevolence.” He did not want the freed slaves to “depend fortheir bread and raiment upon the benevolence of the North,” arguing, naïvely inretrospect, that the freedmen would make it on their own if left alone.20[notes01.html#ch20fn_20a]Emancipated slaves undergoing terrible hardships dearly needed to gainself-respect. But their need for food, clothing, medical care, and protectionquickly became even more necessary. Douglass’s insensitive remarks aboutNorthern benevolence were shortsighted and misplaced at best. Later, in the1870s, Douglass would preach a black self-reliance and a laissez-faireindividualism that echoed the reigning Social Darwinism of the day, and whichmay always have roiled under the mental surfaces of this proud, putativeself-made man. Such contradictions emanated from deep in the psychological wellof a man who had so long himself relied on the financial benevolence, as well asthe emotional support, of influential and wealthy white reformers as well as thefund-raising campaigns of his devoted British female friends. No one ever workedharder, nor at greater risk, for the liberation of American slaves thanDouglass. But he had processed hard psychic lessons for years about loving andhating the hands that feed one’s family, buy one’s freedom, help educate one’schildren, and keep the printing press rolling.21 [notes01.html#ch20fn_21a]During the slaughter and displacement of the war, however, he soon found thatthe fate of the freedmen was a much more complex problem than the “do nothing”rhetoric had implied.The tension between the doctrine of self-reliance and the necessity ofgovernment support for the freedmen produced a working paradox in Douglass’sthought throughout the war and postbellum period. He never stopped arguing thatthe legacy of slavery would require federal aid to the freedpeople, but he alsonever surrendered his commitment to a fierce individualism. As both belief andstrategy, he advanced both doctrines at once, a position of stark contradictionafter the war in an age decreasingly receptive to humanitarian reform. Whileexpecting a rugged self-reliance from his people, so many of whom emerged fromslavery with little or no human or physical capital, he also demanded justiceand fairness from the nation. In 1862 Douglass warmly called the government the“shield . . . from the fury and vengeance of treason, rebellion and anarchy.” Inevery discussion of the welfare of the freedmen during the war, Douglassinsisted that the government “deal justly” with blacks.22[notes01.html#ch20fn_22a] Douglass assiduously advocated for both bootstraps andaid, all the while learning that among the many casualties of the total war wereimpulses of humane fairness.What Douglass meant, in large part, by “do nothing” was “do justice.” Coupledwith his calls for black self-help were his demands for education, wages,protection in the workplace, civil rights, and suffrage. All of these aims wouldrequire extraordinary use of federal power, new laws, military enforcement, andfundamental changes in social attitudes. He expected a great deal fromrevolution wrought by the war; in millennialist historical thinking, the limitsof change are in God’s imagination as much as in mankind’s. “We would not for amoment check . . . the benevolent concern for the future welfare of the coloredrace in America,” wrote Douglass in 1862, “but . . . we earnestly plead forjustice above all else.”23 [notes01.html#ch20fn_23a] But by 1863, “justice” wasa many-headed, bloody dream as it underwent rebirth.From Northerners, Douglass wanted less pity and more ballots, less benevolenceand more black land ownership. He would never be comfortable with any widespreadconfiscation or redistribution of Confederate lands in the wake of the war.Instead, he wanted freedmen to obtain land by means consistent with the sanctityof private property, although in his view the government ought to have a primaryrole in securing and arranging the sale of such land. With time, Douglassapplauded every function of the Freedmen’s Bureau, the unprecedented federalagency created in early 1865 to try to provide massive social welfare to themillions of black and white displaced people in the South. But when emancipationitself was still a revolutionary policy in the making, he seems to haveconcluded that white audiences needed strategic preparation that would feelconsistent with their worldviews. “What shall be done with the four millionemancipated slaves if emancipated?” Douglass asked. “Pay them honest wages forhonest work; dispense with the biting lash, and pay the ready cash; awaken a newclass of motives in them; remove those old motives of shriveling fear ofpunishment which benumb and degrade the soul, and supplant them by he highermotives of . . . self-respect . . . and personal responsibility.” Then Douglassshifted the point of view decisively; “They [blacks] have been compelledhitherto to regard the white man as a cruel, selfish, remorseless tyrant. . . .Now let him see that the white man has a nobler and better side to hischaracter.”24 [notes01.html#ch20fn_24a] This was thoroughgoing politicalliberalism sprinkled with twists of old-fashioned moral suasion. It was noteconomic radicalism. The substance of Douglass’s message to white Americans,therefore, was morally change yourselves. The new order was as much for whitesto give as it was for blacks to take.Douglass knew that the prospect of emancipation had always needed sweetening inNorthern ears, just as it had in numerous other nations and empires. The “donothing” dictum might allay white fears; he portrayed blacks as hardworkingpeople who only needed simple justice and a fair chance. Land ownership wouldwould make each of them a “better producer and a better consumer.” Northernersneed not fear massive migrations, vagrancy, or criminality, Douglass contended,if blacks were given equality before the law. Douglass believed blacks had beenperceived as an “exception” too long, and he wanted to prevent their becomingpermanent social pariahs.25 [notes01.html#ch20fn_25a] What do nothing meant, inpart, was to free the slaves without colonizing or subjugating them as a racialcaste; then give them equality and allow them to learn, work, and vote. Douglassdemanded governmental action, not merely letting the freedmen live or die bytheir own pluck.Douglass feared a “vindictive spirit sure to be roused against the whole coloredrace” in an imagined postwar South. He repeatedly called on Northern reformersto improve the condition of the former slaves. Whenever the shooting stopped,“the whole South,” Douglass declared, “as it never was before the abolition ofslavery will become missionary ground.” Capturing the spirit of freedmen’s aidsocieties, Douglass urged reformers and teachers to “walk among theseslavery-smitten columns of humanity and lift their forms towards Heaven.” Thefreedmen’s needs would require what the orator called “all the elevating andcivilizing institutions of the country.”26 [notes01.html#ch20fn_26a] ModernRepublicans, eager to find a black spokesman for personal responsibility, havenot bothered to read deeper into Douglass.As Douglass addressed during wartime the question of Reconstruction, he more andmore stressed black suffrage. With the war nearing its end in April 1865, hegave an address to abolitionists in Boston entitled “What the Black Man Wants,”in which he outlined at length the reasons why his people needed the vote. Hecontended that “women, as well as men, have the right to vote,” but in themoment, women must wait for “another basis” to gain suffrage, a position thatwould ultimately land him in a bitter feud with many women reformers. Theballot, he believed, would serve as protection from white racism, a means ofeducation, and a source of self-worth. Douglass treated suffrage with specialurgency at the war’s end; the opportunity might never come again in anyone’slifetime: “This is the hour, our streets are in mourning . . . and under thechastisement of this rebellion we have almost come up to the point of concedingthis great, this all-important right of suffrage.” Hence, with propheticinsight, Douglass urged abolitionists to harness for all time the extraordinaryforces the war had unleashed. “Judgments terrible . . . overwhelming, are abroadin the land,” he counseled. “I fear if we fail to do it now . . . we may notsee, for centuries to come, the same disposition that exists at this moment.”27[notes01.html#ch20fn_27a]• • •Whether an abolition war could ever be waged to its conclusion was very muchstill in doubt in the bloody summer of 1864. The revolution could still be lost.In the election campaign of that year Douglass continued to be troubled by theambiguous policies of the Lincoln administration. Conflicting factions withinthe Republican Party vied to influence and control the evolving emancipation aswell as Reconstruction policies. Postmaster General Montgomery Blair, the oldleader of colonization, would accept emancipation of slaves in reconstructedSouthern states, but opposed any political or civil rights for freedmen. He didso in fearmongering, Negro-phobic public speeches, claiming without authority tospeak for the president as Blair warned against racial “amalgamation.” Hetraveled the North with a message as antiblack as it was antislavery. He calledthe abolitionists’ advocacy of equality “a fundamental change in the laws ofnature . . . blending different species of the human race.” He continued toadvocate for the colonization of liberated blacks to their own natural “climes”and “hemispheres.” The other wing of Republicans, the more ascendant Radicals,led by Congressman Henry Winter Davis of Maryland and Senator Charles Sumner ofMassachusetts and others, wanted immediate emancipation followed by thebeginnings of equality, including black suffrage. Lincoln sought above all tosustain party unity, to make emancipation a certainty, although by gradual andorderly means if possible. In late 1863, Lincoln had responded to a MichiganRepublican who had urged him to move faster against the conservatives by sayingthat he hoped “to stand firm enough not to go backward, and yet not go forwardfast enough to wreck the country’s cause.”28 [notes01.html#ch20fn_28a] This wasthe Lincoln who had exasperated Douglass in 1861–62, and as the war collapsedinto horrible stalemate in 1864, Douglass lost faith for a time in whether heand Lincoln had ever worked from the same script.One of Lincoln’s greatest concerns was chaos or even guerrilla race war in theSouth as the war ended. Douglass insisted that secure land ownership andespecially the right of the freed slaves to vote would be essential buttressesagainst that very disorder. Lincoln feared potential white violent resistance toblacks voting; Douglass believed black Southerners would need to be armed withthe vote to protect themselves. Both men would in the long run be proven right;but in what order and by what pace ought this revolution take place? On thatquestion, they greatly disagreed; Douglass possessed his own vengeful spirit towork through, and Republicans struggled for consensus.As the presidential election campaign of 1864 approached, Douglass found himselfattracted to a dump-Lincoln movement among Radicals in the Republican Party. Themost contentious question that divided Republicans against themselves wasReconstruction policy, as well as perceptions of Lincoln’s indecisiveness andconservatism. A good deal of scurrilous political ambition drove passions for anew candidate as well, especially that practiced by the treasury secretary,Salmon Chase. Chase’s desire to unseat Lincoln was a wide-open secret among thepolitical class. Lincoln had long needed Chase for his skill as an administratorand his antislavery credentials, but fully understood that he was infected with“the White House fever.” Chase had allies, but primarily he relied on a somewhatbroad discontent among Radicals with what they variously considered thepresident’s “temporizing” approach to slavery and the prosecution of the war.Widespread contempt also simmered under the surface because of Lincoln’sfrequent “joking” habits and character. Chase, in persistent efforts to damageLincoln, had openly complained that cabinet sessions were merely “meetings forjokes.” On policy, many Radicals objected to Lincoln’s lenient approach toreconstructing Southern states and rendering justice to Confederates. Lincoln,however, was popular outside Washington, DC, and across the North. Moreover,Chase faded from the picture by the spring and early summer of 1864 due to hisown embarrassing overreach; after numerous offers by Chase to resign his cabinetposition, Lincoln finally accepted the fifth time.29 [notes01.html#ch20fn_29a]A more serious challenge to Lincoln’s nomination came from a group of Radicalswho touted John C. Frémont for the head of the Republican ticket. Frémont, whohad been the Republican standard-bearer in 1856, collected many abolitionistsupporters, including some old Garrisonians. Garrison himself, however, brokewith his friends and steadfastly stayed in Lincoln’s camp. Wendell Phillipscalled Lincoln a “half-converted, honest Western Whig trying to be anabolitionist.” Garrison, however, believed that despite his caution Lincoln had“at one blow, severed the chains of three millions three hundred thousandslaves.” Douglass walked a fence in this politically dangerous terrain. Heendorsed the call for the Frémont movement’s convention, but did not attend whenit met in Cleveland on May 31 to nominate the Californian for president and JohnCochrane, the nephew of Gerrit Smith, as his running mate.30[notes01.html#ch20fn_30a]Disgruntled and painfully impatient with Lincoln administration ideas aboutblack equality and Reconstruction, Douglass decided to join the attack. Theunequal-pay controversy in the Union army burned among black troops and theircommunities until midsummer, and the federal government showed no disposition togrant black suffrage in such occupied Southern states as Louisiana. Even beforeannouncing his “Proclamation of Amnesty and Reconstruction” in December 1863,Lincoln had communicated forcefully to his commanding general in Louisiana,Nathaniel P. Banks, that he desired a “tangible nucleus” of Unionist leaders ofwhatever number, “which the remainder of the state may rally around.” This wasthe kernel of Lincoln’s vision of Reconstruction—a fluid, experimental process,a part of military policy, run by the president and not by Congress, and heavilydependent on his faith in an inherent Unionism within the Confederate states. Alocal, loyal white elite, therefore, must not be threatened off by the prospectof black suffrage. The president’s evolving Reconstruction policies made himappear passive, or even obstructionist, to Radicals. Certainly Banks looked soas he conducted elections in early 1864 with the vote restricted exclusively towhite men, and as he instituted a plan to force black freedmen to work for wagescapped by the government at $10 per month. Banks’s system also includedprescriptions that freedmen remain on their old masters’ plantations, in“perfect subordination,” disciplined often in the old methods of slavery.31[notes01.html#ch20fn_31a]White and black Radicals, within Louisiana and across the North, were outraged.Some abolitionists, stationed with the army in Louisiana, condemned the Banksmeasures as the “reestablishment of slavery,” or the substitution of “serfdomfor slavery.” As Lincoln, by and large, supported the Banks system, Douglassjoined the chorus of anger and frustration. Asked to explain in May why hesupported the Frémont movement, the orator laid it on the line as anuncompromising Radical. Douglass demanded “complete abolition of every vestige,form and modification of Slavery in every part of the United States.” Leaving noroom for experimentation and gradualism, he insisted on “perfect equality forthe black man in every state before the law, in the jury box, at the ballot boxand on the battlefield.” He wanted nothing short of full equality for blacks inaccess to “offices and honors” in the military and the government.32[notes01.html#ch20fn_32a]After emancipation in 1863, Douglass had hoped he would never again have toattack Lincoln. But in June 1864, he wrote a stinging public rebuke of thepresident. It was now a “swindle” that the federal government asked “the respectof mankind for abolishing slavery,” all the while “practically re-establishingthe hateful system in Louisiana.” Douglass had tried to believe in Lincoln’ssteadfastness, but now his “patience and faith” dwindled. The president had“virtually laid down this as the rule of his statesmanship,” Douglass boldlystated: “Do evil by choice, right from necessity.” He chastised Lincoln for notsigning Congress’s Wade-Davis Bill, which was the Radicals’ Reconstruction plan,requiring a majority of voters in a Confederate state, as opposed to only 10percent in Lincoln’s plan, to renounce secession and declare a loyalty oathbefore returning to the Union. Douglass called Lincoln’s Ten Per-Cent plan an“entire contradiction of the constitutional idea of the republican Government.”Especially incensed with Republican hostility to black voting rights, Douglassslashed away at his old targets of hypocrisy and racism. “We invest with theelective franchise those who with bloody blades and bloody hands have sought thelife of the nation, but sternly refuse to invest those who have done what theycould to save the nation’s life.” Most demoralizing of all, he argued, was whatgovernment policy implied for the freedman once peace arrived: “to hand him backto the political power of his master, without a single element of strength toshield himself from the vindictive spirit sure to be roused against the wholecolored race.”33 [notes01.html#ch20fn_33a]From the Democrats, who were about to nominate former general George B.McClellan as their candidate, and from the Frémont third-party effort, Lincoln’sreelection was in dire trouble that summer. War weariness had never been sodebilitating across the North; abolitionists remained split over whether tosupport Lincoln’s reelection as the casualty reports from Virginia and Georgiadrove Northern morale into despair. The situation was “never so gloomy,” wroteSydney Gay, editor of the National Anti-Slavery Standard. He feared that thepeople would vote for any compromise or follow a “party for peace at any price,even disunion.”34 [notes01.html#ch20fn_34a] A war that might not be won forunion surely could not secure the emancipation of slaves. Douglass followedLincoln’s public utterances in these months, but he surely could not know thebeleaguered president’s personal thoughts. On one compelling matter, however,they unknowingly shared a great deal—the effort to discern and explain, ifpossible, the place of God’s will in this horrible, unending conflict.With differing style and scope, Lincoln and Douglass shared an outlook ofmillennial nationalism—America as a nation with a special destiny, fraught withcontradictions, and living out a historical trajectory under some kind ofprovidential judgment. Lincoln’s “house divided against itself” and “last besthope of earth” had long been Douglass’s nation of “shameless hypocrisy,” its“hands . . . full of blood,” but also the nation “so young,” its original “greatprinciples” so old and profound, that it could yet be redeemed. Both menpossessed pliable, deeply curious minds; and they were intellectual brooders.Both expressed ambivalence about theological orthodoxy. But neither couldimagine human affairs, history itself, without the idea of an active God shapingits direction and outcomes. Both kept watch over history and worried intenselyabout a vengeful God’s interest in the American republic. Their individual pathsto the dark crisis of 1864 were both riddled with expressions of such areligious-historical worldview. Lincoln, writes the biographer Ronald White,typically “thinks his way into a problem,” looking at all sides, and “workingthrough the logic of a syllogism.” Douglass too loved to logically weigh twosides of an issue, and like Lincoln he possessed a well-earned respect formystery and uncertainty. Through irony he often gave the impression that he knewprecisely where he would land with a typically thunderous argument. Douglasscould logically and pragmatically think his way to his truths as much as thequieter Lincoln. By 1864, both men were intellectual self-reinventions ofearlier selves, and both envisioned the nation in biblical terms, undergoingtransformation by fire. In late 1862, Lincoln had warned the nation, “We cannotescape history . . . the fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down,in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation.” Two months earlier, Douglass,had in his own way said the same: “We are saved as by fire, we grieve withsorrow-stricken families all over the North, but their terrible afflictions andheavy sorrows are their educators.”35 [notes01.html#ch20fn_35a]As another biographer, Richard Carwardine, has demonstrated, the witheringdemands of Lincoln’s cruel presidency “swept [him] along to a new religiousunderstanding.” His wartime language increasingly included claims of his “firmreliance on the Divine arm,” that he sought “light from above,” was acting with“responsibility to my God,” and that he hoped to discern God’s wishes in “thesigns of the times.” Lincoln, very possibly in 1864, famously scratched on afragment of paper what his secretaries and future historians would call his“Meditation on the Divine Will.” No better example exists, except for his SecondInaugural Address, for which this statement provides a foretaste, of Lincoln’saustere, biblically informed sense of tragedy:The will of God prevails. In great contests each party claims to act inaccordance with the will of God. Both may be, and one must be wrong. God cannotbe for, and against the same thing at the same time. In the present civil war itis possible that God’s purpose is something different from the purpose of eitherparty. . . . I am almost ready to say this is probably true—that God wills thiscontest, and wills that it shall not end yet. . . . He could have either savedor destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. Andhaving begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet thecontest proceeds.Lincoln’s private reflection invokes a profound sense of the costs and thetragedy at the heart of this “human contest.”36 [notes01.html#ch20fn_36a]Characteristically, Lincoln couched his emerging sense of a frightening truth inwords such as “almost” and “probably.” Douglass, while sharing the same ideas,was rhetorically beyond qualifiers. Ever since his first autobiographicalwriting, he had conducted his own meditation on divine will. He protected hisown uncertainty perhaps more rigidly by rooting it explicitly in the rhetoric ofIsaiah and the Hebrew prophets. Douglass’s wartime apocalypticism breathed withOld Testament fire and justification. He frequently employed phrasing such as“the laws of God,” the “stern logic of events,” or the “tradewinds of thealmighty” to give both tone and substance to his explanation of the war’smeaning. Douglass’s subject was less the shaping of policy than it was topersuade a people to rise, make holy war, and answer God’s call to repent andsacrifice. “The land is now to weep and howl amid ten thousand desolations,” hecried early in the war. “Repent, Break Every Yoke, let the Oppressed Go Free forHerein alone is deliverance and safety!” Douglass repeated his great wartimetheme over and over. The “Mission” speech was his jeremiadic, prosecutorialsummation. A chosen but guilty people had to suffer and reform or lose theirdestiny altogether. Douglass decided that his best options were to stand withIsaiah and Jeremiah and issue the warnings about God’s intentions; His peoplemight be listening at this moment as never before.37 [notes01.html#ch20fn_37a]We do not know just how or whether Lincoln or Douglass prayed. But by latesummer of 1864, both men, facing this existential predicament from differentpositions, solemnly pondered what course God might have in mind for thisterrible war.Image [../images/f0434-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, Chicago, February 1864. Samuel Montegue Fassettphotographer.• • •Lincoln’s famous public letters and addresses where he showed his commitment toemancipation may or may not have had a role in softening Douglass’s ire towardthe president in 1864. But in August, Lincoln stunned Douglass by inviting himto the White House for an urgent meeting that in the view of the black leaderwould change almost everything once again. Lincoln’s notion to invite Douglassto Washington emerged out of his meetings during the week of August 10–17 withJohn Eaton Jr., a New Hampshire–born, Dartmouth-educated chaplain of an Ohioregiment in the Union army. General Ulysses Grant had appointed Eatonsuperintendent of freedmen in 1862, and by 1864 the minister had established alarge number of contraband camps in the lower Mississippi valley. On his way toWashington that month to brief the president and the War Department, Eaton hadheard Douglass deliver the “Mission” speech in Toledo, Ohio, and had conversedwith him about it afterward.38 [notes01.html#ch20fn_38a]Few people understood the plight of the freedpeople on the ground in the Southquite like the devoted abolitionist Eaton. In reminiscences of his meetings withLincoln, Eaton found the chief executive’s interest in the situation of freedslaves “astonishing.” Worried about the military stalemate and the process ofemancipation, Lincoln, according to Eaton, “alluded to John Brown’s raid,”openly suggesting that “every possible means” ought to be considered to maximizethe liberation of slaves. The president asked about a “grapevine telegraph” thatmight be “utilized to call upon the Negroes of the interior peacefully to leavethe plantations and seek the protection of our armies.” Here was some version ofBrown’s old militarized underground railroad, the idea that almost drew Douglassto Brown’s band of ill-fated warriors. Eaton informed the president of some ofDouglass’s criticisms voiced in Toledo, especially about the leniency of theReconstruction plan, the lack of action on black suffrage, and “retaliationagainst cruelty to Negro soldiers.” Lincoln abruptly arose, went to a privatedesk, drew from a drawer, and read aloud a copy of his March 13 letter toGovernor Michael Hahn of Louisiana, in which Lincoln suggested that the“elective franchise” might be extended to “some colored people . . . the veryintelligent, and especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks.”Defensively, Lincoln beseeched Eaton, did Douglass know about this letter?Further, could “Douglass be induced to come see him” at the White House?Arrangements were quickly made, and the Rochester orator, on the road constantlythat summer, was on a train through Maryland to the Baltimore and Ohio stationat New Jersey Avenue and C Street in the capital.39 [notes01.html#ch20fn_39a]As Douglass sat in the reception room at the White House awaiting his interviewwith the president on August 19, Douglass had a chance encounter with JudgeJoseph T. Mills of Wisconsin, who was also awaiting an appointment. In hisdiary, Mills recorded telling the president the story of how dark it felt in thereception area. So dark that “there in the corner,” said Mills, “I saw a manquietly reading who possessed a remarkable physiognomy. I was riveted to thespot. I stood & stared at him. He raised his flashing eyes & caught me in theact. I was compelled to speak. Said I, Are you the President? No, replied thestranger, I am Frederick Douglass.” Douglass had been stared at in countlesssuch situations before, and we can only imagine the stern eyes and proud ifindignant voice with which Douglass responded to this kind of encounter. Millsfound the episode so humorous that in his conversations later with Lincoln,while sitting next to him on a sofa, he told of seeing Douglass: “Mr P, are youin favor of miscegenation?” Mills recorded. “That’s a democratic mode ofproducing good Union men, & I don’t propose to infringe on the patent.”40[notes01.html#ch20fn_40a] In such an exchange of stares, between an educatedwhite jurist who supported the Union war effort, and a smartly dressed blackman, reading as he waited to speak with the president of the United States, wecan discern an old and enduring form of American racism still alive in parlortalk: What is that black man doing in the White House? How did he get there? Wecan hope Lincoln ignored the joke.In Douglass’s second meeting with Lincoln, this time at the president’sinvitation, the two had a longer and remarkably frank exchange. Douglass had notminced words out on the circuit about Lincoln, accusing him in the “Mission”speech of “heartless sentiments” and an absence of “all moral feeling” on toomany questions. “Policy, policy, everlasting policy,” Douglass complained in anunveiled swipe at Lincoln, “has robbed our statesmanship of all soul-movingutterances.” Lincoln seemed aware that he now sat face-to-face with a fierce butuseful critic, a situation this politician had managed many times before. Twiceduring their interview, a secretary interrupted to tell the president thatGovernor William Buckingham of Connecticut was waiting at the door, but inDouglass’s memory, Lincoln kept dismissing the intrusion and said, tell theGovernor to wait, “for I want to have a long talk with my friend FrederickDouglass.”41 [notes01.html#ch20fn_41a] Forever proud of this highlight moment inhis career, Douglass relished retelling it.Lincoln quickly cut to the chase and unburdened his fears that he would not bereelected, that the war could collapse into a negotiated peace, and that,especially, emancipation would grind to a halt. Lincoln, recollected Douglass,was deeply troubled by all the attacks he received from fellow Republicans. Thepresident looked much older than the last time they met, and he “spoke withgreat earnestness and much solicitude.” Lincoln, who later that day swapped aSambo story with Mills (according to the judge), looked Douglass in the eye andasked the former slave to help him devise “the means most desirable to beemployed outside the army to induce the slaves in the rebel states to comewithin the federal lines.” Lincoln sought Douglass’s advice on how he shouldanswer his critics, and especially on how to usher as many slaves as possibleout of the border states into freedom and security before the election and thepresident’s potential defeat. As Lincoln talked, Douglass must have leanedforward with a stunned visage; he saw in the president “a deeper moralconviction against slavery,” he later said, than he had ever imagined. InDouglass’s retelling, Lincoln asked the former coconspirator of 1859 who hadfled America for his life, “to undertake the organizing of a band of scouts,composed of colored men, whose business should be somewhat after the originalplan of John Brown, to go into the rebel states, beyond the lines of our armies,and carry the news of emancipation, and urge the slaves to come within ourboundaries.” Douglass listened with “profoundest satisfaction,” and perhaps evendisbelief.42 [notes01.html#ch20fn_42a]Overnight, it seemed, Douglass had gone from frustrated outsider and fiercecritic to special presidential adviser and organizer of a radical militarymission, the purpose of which was to destroy as much of slavery as possiblebefore political fortunes changed. We cannot know what Douglass felt in hisheart that morning as he looked into Lincoln’s eyes, nor can we know fully howthe old prairie lawyer processed this irony-laden moment. For those hours atleast the former slave from the Tuckahoe and the Indiana dirt farmer’s son weremaking a revolution together.After leaving the White House, Douglass returned to the home of a black friendwith whom he stayed while in Washington. Eaton met him there and found the blackleader pacing in a parlor in “a state of extreme agitation.” Douglass was boththrilled and troubled. The plan he had just agreed to help Lincoln and the armyimplement was inchoate and daunting. It also meant that the legitimacy of theEmancipation Proclamation was utterly dependent on military success, andtherefore on the election. Douglass felt exhilarated to have been “treated . . .as a man,” and with no thought of the “color of our skins” by Lincoln. Butfrankly, he had little idea of just how to lead the plan to infiltrate theSouth, inform slaves, and funnel them north to safety. Suddenly, the man ofsupreme eloquence and hard rhetoric had to think about policy, organization, andclandestine logistics. Eaton said Douglass already had pen and paper on a tablenearby, preparing to draft a memorandum to the president. A day or so later,before leaving the capital, Douglass received a White House messenger,accompanied with a carriage, inviting him to join Lincoln for tea out at theSoldiers’ Home, the presidential summer retreat within the District of Columbia.The orator had a speaking engagement and had to turn down the invitation,something he would always regret, especially after the terrible events of thefollowing April.43 [notes01.html#ch20fn_43a] We do not know what Lincoln had inmind for discussion at that tea.On the very day Douglass met with Lincoln at the White House, Julia Crofts wrotefrom England, full of anxiety over “all the wretchedness & misery &blood-shedding” of the war, and begging her old friend to “not go towardWashington during this time. . . . Your life is one that would be sacrificed atonce if you ever reached the hands of those southern tyrants.” By the timeDouglass read that letter, however, he had already drafted an outline of a planfor the president. On August 29, the old editor sent his four-part proposal fora general agent (himself presumably); subagents, selected by Douglass, stationedin various densely populated slave areas of rebel states conducting “squads ofslaves” into the North; close ties and clear orders between commanding Uniongenerals and subagents; and finally, proper provisions of food and shelter forall freedmen swept up in the liberation scheme. For himself, he wanted a “rovingcommission,” giving him full legitimacy amid the army officers throughout warzones. This was Douglass’s best effort at a formal proposal for the militarizedunderground railroad in the midst of all-out war. He told Lincoln that he hadconsulted several other black leaders in the mere week since their parley; allbelieved in the wisdom of the idea, he reported, but only some thought itpracticable. Although willing to lead such an operation, it is unlikely Douglassfelt much practical enthusiasm for it. Just how he would coordinate his “band ofscouts,” as he later called the idea, he never made clear.44[notes01.html#ch20fn_44a] Soon, events rendered the entire scheme unnecessary.On September 2, the day the Democratic National Convention in Chicago nominatedGeorge McClellan for president, news flashed across the country of the fall ofAtlanta to General William Tecumseh Sherman after a long siege. Just as theDemocrats met to declare the war a failure and crafted a platform that wouldlead to a negotiated Confederate independence of some kind, Sherman famouslysent a telegram to Washington: “Atlanta is ours and fairly won.” Confederates’rising hopes plummeted, and many war-weary Northerners, represented by thefamous New York diarist George Templeton Strong, saw victory now on theimmediate horizon: “Glorious news this morning—Atlanta taken at last!!! Itis . . . the greatest event of the war.”45 [notes01.html#ch20fn_45a] TheDemocrats’ peace platform put Lincoln’s apparent moderation in a differentlight; and Douglass had seen a devotion in the president’s heart and mind.By late September, Frémont withdrew from the race and the choice simplified.“When there was any shadow of a hope that a man of a more decided antislaveryconviction . . . could be elected, I was not for Mr. Lincoln,” Douglass wrote tofellow abolitionist Theodore Tilton. “But as soon as the Chicago [Democratic]convention, my mind was made up, and it is made still. All dates changed withthe nomination of Mr. McClellan.” Like other abolitionists, Douglass wanted toactively campaign for Lincoln’s reelection. But sensing the clear Republicandesire not to be identified as the “N-r party,” he stayed away from thepolitical stump. Some things had greatly changed and some had not. “The Negro isthe deformed child,” Douglass complained to Tilton in September, “put out of theroom when company comes.”46 [notes01.html#ch20fn_46a] The orator still had tofind his own psychic balance between the high of the Lincoln interview in lateAugust and the low caused by the subtle and blunt indignities of Republican coldshoulders in September. For now those racist stares were not as important aswinning the war and achieving universal emancipation and the right to vote.But the school of affliction was hardly over. As Douglass had learned so manytimes, in the election campaign and its historic aftermath down to the end ofthe war and beyond, he had to keep rethinking the tragic wisdom in Job. The Lordnot only giveth and taketh away, but history itself, even in its most convulsiveleaps forward, giveth and taketh away.47 [notes01.html#ch20fn_47a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 21--------------------------------------------------------------------------------SACRED EFFORTSAnd the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an oliveleaf plucked off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.—GENESIS 8:11During the final months of the Civil War, Frederick Douglass’s emotions andideas careened from fear to exhilaration, from hope to despair, and in and outof Old Testament–style tribulation and redemption. In a special address to ablack convention in Syracuse in October 1864, Douglass tackled many of the war’spersonal and existential meanings. This national gathering, the first suchconvention to be held in nine years, attracted approximately 150 representativesfrom eighteen states, including small delegations from Mississippi, Missouri,Florida, Virginia, and North Carolina. The delegates collectively denouncedcolonization and explicitly demanded “equality before the law.”1[notes01.html#ch21fn_1a]Possibly no previous convention had drawn a list of African American luminariesof such diverse backgrounds and talents. Virtually every major black religious,political, literary, or community leader attended. For nearly four days, allmanner of rivalries were largely checked at the door while such men as HenryHighland Garnet, William Wells Brown, George T. Downing, John Mercer Langston,Jermain Loguen, and others matched wits over the great issues of the war:equality in the army for black soldiers; the dire necessity of completeabolition as the war’s aim; equal civil and political rights in the aftermath ofemancipation. These men were both former slaves and freeborn; some were longtime“friends” of Douglass’s, and others had already spent much energy as his rival,a trend that would only increase in the postwar era. Douglass’s closest blackcomrade, James McCune Smith, ill with the beginnings of congestive heartfailure, did not join the fifty-three-member New York delegation.2[notes01.html#ch21fn_2a]The delegates elected Douglass as their president; he was ushered with “greatapplause” to the stage by the younger, Oberlin-educated Langston. Douglassswiftly announced in his sonorous voice that “the cause which we come here topromote is sacred.” He envisioned the “wide, wide world” watching them as theypromoted no less than the “freedom, progress, elevation, and perfectenfranchisement of the entire colored people.” On the following mornings orevenings the convention would begin with prayers by the Reverend Garnet orothers, and strikingly, with song, including “John Brown’s Body,” “Blow Ye theTrumpet, Blow,” and on the final day, Julia Ward Howe’s recently composed“Battle Hymn of the Republic.” How moving it must have been to hearfull-throated renditions of such paeans to the emancipationist vision of the warand of the old Exodus story. At least one woman, Edmonia Highgate of Syracuse,addressed the convention, introduced by Douglass. The minutes do not record herspeech, except to say that Highgate urged the men to steadfastness in the causeuntil the “glorious day of jubilee shall come.” Most poignant of all, at theafternoon session of the second day, Garnet took the lead in unfurling acrossthe platform the battle flag of the First Louisiana Colored Troops, a unit thathad achieved fame for its bravery at the battle of Port Hudson in July 1863.3[notes01.html#ch21fn_3a]Delivered on the final day of the convention, Douglass’s speech was bothcelebration and warning. Since the Republicans did not want him out on the stumpcampaigning, he delivered his own political accounting to his fellow AfricanAmericans on this election eve. He addressed the question of history itself,bounding forward it seemed, to illuminate new barriers and obstacles toprogress. In eloquence tinged with anger and anxiety, Douglass appealed to hisown people, but especially to the generic “you” of white Northerners about to goto the polls. Nations could “learn righteousness” from supreme crises, heargued, and this was a moment when “mourning mingles everywhere with thenational shout of victory.” Douglass asserted that the opportunity to crushslavery, throw back racism, and reinvent the American republic around principlesof racial equality “may not come again in a century.”4 [notes01.html#ch21fn_4a]Everything was at stake in defeating the Democrats and finishing the war.Douglass provided a litany of the horrors that would result if the Democrats,allied with Confederates, managed a negotiated peace settlement, resulting inthe reestablishment of “the white man’s country,” and the obliteration of “allthe lessons taught by these four years of fire and sword.” Douglass portrayedthe Democrats as the enemies of mankind, and of history itself. They were the“fiendish . . . hellhounds” ready to pounce on black people and their allies attheir first grasp of power. They had cleverly cultivated the political landscapewith what the next century would call Orwellian language. Avoiding the wordsslavery or slaves or slaveholders, Douglass maintained, Democratic doublespeaksought the “perpetuation” of slavery in their platform under the guise of such“verbiage” as private rights or the basis of Federal Union or the Constitution.5[notes01.html#ch21fn_5a]Douglass took up the meaning of friends and enemies, claiming to be as worriedabout the Republicans’ hostility to black voting rights as to the Democrats’darkest aims. “It is . . . not the malignity of enemies alone we have to fear,”he announced, “but the deflection from the straight line of principle by thosewho are known throughout the world as our special friends.” Douglass worriedabout possible peace plans that might get consummated before slavery legallyended. As though directly addressing Congress and a reelected President Lincoln,he employed a moving refrain four times in a single paragraph calling for theThirteenth Amendment: “We implore you to abolish slavery,” he sang out over andover. Only then, he believed, would slavery’s destruction and the “nationalwelfare” achieve “everlasting foundations.”6 [notes01.html#ch21fn_6a]Then Douglass signaled what would be for him a primary argument throughout thepostwar era—he demanded in the classic terms of political liberalism thefranchise as the greatest of all rights. Arguing from natural-rights moraldoctrine, Douglass contended that in a republic all elements ofliberty—“personal freedom; the right to testify in courts of law; the right toown, buy and sell real estate; the right to sue and be sued”—depended forprotection on suffrage. The vote, said Douglass, was the “keystone to the archof human liberty.” But he also accurately anticipated that the black male votewould bring great practical value to Republicans in the postwar era. The onlyguarantee about a postemancipation order in the South, he said, was the “sullenhatred towards the National Government” and the freedmen on the part ofex-Confederates. Theirs would be a “sacred animosity” toward their conquerors,black and white. “We may conquer Southern armies,” proclaimed Douglass, “but itis another thing to conquer Southern hate.” The only weapon available was thevotes of 4 million new “friends.”7 [notes01.html#ch21fn_7a] With these astutestrokes of war propaganda and moral philosophy, Douglass awaited the electionresults.• • •The convention delegates in Syracuse had good reason for anxiety over thepresidential election of 1864. They had keenly observed events for months, asthe Thirteenth Amendment abolishing slavery, supported by Lincoln, had passed inthe Senate but failed of the two-thirds majority in the House ofRepresentatives. With the war in terrible military stalemate in Virginia andGeorgia, Lincoln and his administration fell into turmoil over its ownemancipation policy. “Peace Democrats” relentlessly attacked Lincoln andemancipation as the obstacles to ending the bloodshed. His reelection in danger,the president authorized an ill-advised, informal peace mission to meet withConfederate representatives. But the effort backfired on Lincoln. He allowed thenettlesome Horace Greeley to go to Niagara Falls, Canada, in July and meet withwhat turned out to be bogus Confederate representatives. Lincoln crafted a briefletter addressed infamously “To Whom It May Concern,” declaring that “anyproposition” for peace would be received from Confederates as long as itincluded reunion of the states and the “abandonment of slavery.” The Niagaraletter was a public-relations disaster. Confederate sympathizers in the North(known to their foes as Copperheads) and the Democratic Party newspapers seizedon this news and pilloried Lincoln as the bloodthirsty war maker standing in theway of peace in order to free slaves. The Cincinnati Enquirer declared Lincoln’sclandestine actions “a finality, which . . . will preclude any conference for asettlement. Every soldier . . . that is killed, will lose his life not for theUnion, the Stars and Stripes, but for the Negro.”8 [notes01.html#ch21fn_8a] Fromhere, the Democratic campaign of 1864 descended into ever-more-savage racism,driving many Republicans into obfuscation on the emancipation amendment.From where Douglass and other black leaders sat, the Republicans only added fuelto the Democrats’ racist fires. No less than Secretary of State William Sewardand Secretary of the Interior John Usher suddenly denied that emancipation wouldbe a condition of reunion if Lincoln was reelected. They asserted, confusingly,that abolition would be left “to the arbitrament of the courts of law.” Douglasscalled out Seward by name and quoted him at length in the Syracuse speech. Thesecretary’s “studied words” at this crucial time could only mean that thefederal government was about to “not only . . . make peace with the Rebels, butto make peace with slavery.” Like a prophet in despair, Douglass felt betrayed,thrown back into 1861–62 and onto his apocalyptic imagination. The “surest . . .ground of hope” now, he said, was in the “madness” of the Confederates tocontinue their war until “destitute . . . and . . . divested of their slaves.”9[notes01.html#ch21fn_9a] This was hardly the prescription for the “abolitionwar” in which he had placed confidence in 1863. But betting on his enemy’sactions had become an old habit.Most dismaying of all was the Democrats’ racist rampage in using the label of“miscegenation” on Lincoln and the Republicans. The very term was first employedin early 1864 in a pamphlet, Miscegenation: The Theory of the Blending of theRaces, written by two reporters, David Croly and George Wakeman (althoughpublished anonymously), at the Democratic New York World. The perniciouspamphlet purported to be crafted by Republicans touting the values ofinterbreeding blacks and whites to improve both. Most people detected the hoax,but the idea exploded as a political weapon more lethal than any impendingconstitutional amendment. Congressmen picked up the term and used it to attackRepublican measures such as early efforts to establish the Freedmen’s Bureau.Demonstrating white men’s fears about racial purity as well as gender disorder,the tactic also exposed the depth of white supremacy abolitionists confronted.10[notes01.html#ch21fn_10a]Democrats labeled Lincoln “Abraham Africanus I” and the “original ourangoutang,”suggesting he had African ancestors. Democratic campaign handbills, lithographs,and songs about race mixing as the “Republican solution” for the war flooded theNorth. “All the painful woes that wreck our lovely land,” moaned one ditty, “Aredue the Abolitionists, the Miscegenation Band.” A widely distributed print fromthe New York World showed the scurrilous caricature of “The Miscegenation Ball,”a fake dance held at the “Central Lincoln Club” for “colored belles” and whiteRepublican men pining with “love sick glances” for the “octoroons.”11[notes01.html#ch21fn_11a] Frightening and disheartening to African Americans,this kind of race-baiting politics knew no bounds; at the polls, however, it didnot work with enough white voters, especially after Union military successes inGeorgia, the Shenandoah Valley, and Mobile Bay turned the tide in Lincoln’sfavor.In this extraordinary wartime election, in which nineteen states allowedsoldiers to vote at the front, the incumbent president carried the popular voteby 2,206,938 to McClellan’s 1,803,787. In the electoral college Lincoln won212–21. Despite fears that a good deal of the Union army might still be loyal toone of its former generals, Lincoln carried a stunning 78 percent of the soldiervote. Those thousands of men in blue who stood at ballot boxes in Virginia,Georgia, Tennessee, or Mississippi knew they were casting their vote foremancipation as well as saving the Union. Few black soldiers could vote in theirstates, but that did not stop their own officers at the front from letting themexpress themselves. Christian Fleetwood, a free black man from Baltimore andtwenty-four-year-old noncommissioned sergeant major in the Fourth US ColoredTroops, left this simple line in his diary: “Nov. 8, 1864—polled the regiment.300 majority for Lincoln.” Fleetwood, who could not yet vote in Maryland, earnedthe Congressional Medal of Honor for extraordinary heroism at the Battle ofChaffin’s Farm, near Petersburg, Virginia, September 29, 1864.12[notes01.html#ch21fn_12a]On Election Day, November 8, Douglass voted in Rochester. A local citizen laterreminisced about working at the poll and tallying the famous orator’s ballot forLincoln. That night the two men were walking back into downtown Rochester tofollow the nationwide returns at the telegraph office. Four drunken white menblocked the street and challenged Douglass by shouting, “Nigger.” According tothis witness, “Douglass stepped right out in front of them” and with fistsraised challenged them in return. “Come on I am ready to settle this thing withyou right here and now.” The drunken cowards “slunk out of the way and into thedarkness,” wrote the former poll worker. He asked Douglass if he was hurt, towhich the former editor replied, “Oh, no, I am not hurt in the least; the boyswere probably not pleased with the news they had heard and wanted to give ventto their disappointment.” That night, asserted this witness, Douglass owned a“physical victory as well as a great political triumph.”13[notes01.html#ch21fn_13a] The tortured election season of fear and racism hadended in relief and reasons to believe the war had made a profound turn towardUnion and abolitionist victory.On the Sunday after the election a celebration took place at Spring Street AMEin Rochester. Douglass took to the pulpit to praise the reelection of Lincolnand to announce that he was about to embark on a special journey to Baltimore,his first-ever public return to the city where he had escaped from slavery. Inthe comfort of this hometown congregation, he drew on metaphors from Genesis andNoah’s Ark. The “waters of the flood were retiring,” he rejoiced, and he saw a“sign that the billows of slavery are rolling back to leave the land bloomingagain.” In the ancient story, Noah had sent a dove flying out the window of theark to determine if the waters of the great flood had receded; the bird returnedthe first time with an “olive leaf” in its bill. The second time the dove didnot return, and Noah “removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold,the face of the ground was dry.” We cannot know for certain how Douglassprepared for such speeches or sermons, but that he consulted the first book ofhis Old Testament to grapple with the meaning of the Republican victory and thenew prospects for emancipation is profoundly telling. He was not merely tryingto connect with his black church audience; he reached, as he had so many timesbefore, for ancient wisdom and metaphor, for a sense of sacred transformationamid the profane violence of war and the sordid practices of politics. He mixedthe prophetic voices of the Hebrew prophets with his own. Something higher thanthe human capacity for folly to thwart good had just occurred. The election,said Douglass, had been “one to determine . . . life or death to the nation.” Ithad wrought “changes . . . vast and wonderful.” He linked the afflicted presentto the oldest rebirth story in his culture.14 [notes01.html#ch21fn_14a]Douglass believed the fate of black folk in America now depended on a new orderof power, law, and rights that would rise from the war. He told the packed pewsof Spring Street AME that he discerned signs in the election, a “redeemed andpurified nation,” not unlike Noah, had seen green land, the world reviving anew.He offered faith that the country, despite its worst elements, could now save“republican government,” pass the constitutional amendment, and “not return thesword to the scabbard” until the Confederacy and slavery were destroyed. Sosanguine was Douglass that he even claimed victory over “all the negrominstrels, all the low clowns of the circus . . . all the rowdies of the street”who had fought so hard “in favor of the vile slaveholding traitors.”15[notes01.html#ch21fn_15a] When he challenged those four thugs on the street inRochester on election night, Douglass was the political analyst ready to fightwith all the weapons he possessed—words, fists, and votes.By November 1 the state of Maryland had adopted a new “free Constitution,”abolishing slavery in a referendum by the narrow margin of 30,174 to 29,799.Douglass made his dramatic return to Baltimore on the sixteenth, and the nextday, he addressed a primarily black standing-room-only gathering at the BethelAME Church in Fell’s Point, the place where he may have met Anna Murray.Reporters covering the event deemed Douglass the “illustrious exile.” A “perfecttorrent of rapturous applause” echoed in the church as Douglass strode down themain aisle arm in arm with his older sister, Eliza Bailey Mitchell. Eliza wasfifty-two years old and had traveled sixty miles from Talbot County for thereunion with her famous brother. They had not seen each other since 1836, whenFred Bailey had last departed from the Eastern Shore. Eliza had been free since1844, when after years of difficult labor, she and her husband, Peter Mitchell,managed to purchase her liberty from the Aulds. She had never learned to read orwrite, but had nonetheless followed keenly her brother’s career and, in 1856,named one of her daughters Mary Douglass Mitchell. Variations on this reunion ofsiblings, free and former slaves, occurred all over the South in the comingyear; indeed Douglass experienced more of them himself. The contrasts at thechurch that day were both happy and achingly poignant. Eliza had raised ninechildren, and all labored in various menial jobs to live, while Frederick hadbecome a citizen of the world conquering lecture halls from Boston and New Yorkto London and Edinburgh.16 [notes01.html#ch21fn_16a]The press reported that Douglass spoke for three hours that night, from a pulpitsurrounded by American flags. He wished to rise above “egotism” for thishomecoming, but that was not possible: “The fact that I am where I am, is reallythe subject, and the whole subject . . . for this evening.” As in Rochester afew days earlier, he harkened to Noah and Genesis. This time he was himself the“sign” on the dark clouds; he embodied Noah’s dove from the ark. “The return ofthe dove to the ark, with a leaf,” declared Douglass, “was no surer sign thatthe flood had subsided from the mountains of the east, than my coming among youis a sign that the bitter waters of slavery have subsided from the majestichills, and fertile valleys of Maryland.”17 [notes01.html#ch21fn_17a]Douglass reminisced about each preacher he had heard in that church in the1830s, about fighting with the “town boys” on the docks, and especially how itwas in Baltimore where he first became a “thoughtful boy” cultivating a “facultyof the mind.” He declared himself a proud member of the “children of Maryland.”All of his kinfolk, black and white, were rooted in the soil and blood ofMaryland. Douglass described a family romance with the state and region,reversing metaphors he had prominently used in his Narrative to represent thehopelessness of his bondage. “Then I left [his escape in 1838], shaking the dustfrom my feet,” he rhapsodized, “as leaving a doomed city, now I return to greetwith an affectionate kiss, the humblest pebble from the shores of your gloriousChesapeake.” Freedom could change everything, especially in a tear-filled churchof memory where he had hatched his “Baltimore dreams.” It was as if he announcedthat one of the “swift-winged angels,” the sailing ships of the Bay on which hehad yearned to fly while imprisoned by Covey, had brought the “exiled son”home.18 [notes01.html#ch21fn_18a]Douglass took the Baltimore speech out with a brilliant political analysis ofthe right of “self-ownership,” the absurdity of “property in man,” and ofAmerica’s dilemma over race. “Liberty is logical, as well as slavery,” heproclaimed; “the one demands the restoration of all rights, as sternly as theother demands the destruction of all rights.” Above all others the right to votewas the “solid rock” on which to build the foundation of a new American state.19[notes01.html#ch21fn_19a] He ended by calling whites and blacks to exercise anew psychological logic, to look into their hearts and minds to cross the racialdivide of centuries.Douglass addressed white people directly. What are you afraid of? he asked. Hereminded them that in the race of “civilization” and history, their “Anglo-Saxonbranch” possessed all the advantages. “Knowledge is power, and you haveknowledge: Wealth is influence, and you have wealth. Majorities rule under ourform of government, and you are the majority.” In phrasing and arguments somodern, that might fit any twenty-first-century discussion of racism andprivilege, Douglass demanded to know why thinking white people so fearedcompetition with their fellow black humans. Too many whites, he said, were“haunted with the idea, that to invest the colored race with equal rights isdangerous to the rights of white men.” Such a “mischievous heresy” had for fartoo long paralyzed history. In no uncertain terms Douglass concluded, “I denythat the black man’s degradation is essential to the white man’s elevation.” Tobelieve otherwise, was to “pay a sorry compliment to the white race.”20[notes01.html#ch21fn_20a]Then Douglass turned to his fellow blacks and delivered a stern prescription ofhard work and self-reliance, one that would ride in tandem with his politicalliberalism throughout Reconstruction and beyond. The joyous and tearfulhomecoming ended with the plea to his people not to misinterpret freedom asrelease from labor. “You must be industrious,” he lectured his fellow formerslaves, as he also urged those from the lower, rural counties of Maryland to“stick to their agricultural pursuits.” Nothing ambiguous or metaphorical here.“I believe $150 in the country is better than $400 in the city. . . . All menare equal naturally, but not practically.” He urged blacks to save money, “buyland,” “educate their children,” and forge a new generation “capable of thinkingas well as digging.” He promised them that the “more intelligent and refined”they became, the more white people will “respect you.”21[notes01.html#ch21fn_21a] These were complex dreams even for a jubilee meeting.Just where and how Douglass himself fit on this spectrum of striving he soon hadto decide.Douglass did not yet understand just how grim the prospects were for suchself-help dictates in the daily lives of freedmen in places such as the EasternShore. His son Lewis visited Eliza Mitchell’s struggling family in June 1865.The war was over, blacks were free, but Lewis called St. Michaels “one of theworst places in the South.” No matter how hard they worked, Lewis observedEastern Shore blacks stymied economically at every turn. “The white people willdo everything they can,” he wrote to his father, “to keep the blacks from buyingland. Large tracts of woods that the whites will neither use nor sell to theblacks lie idle and wasting.” Wages were pitifully meager for black farmhands,and even those who worked in “oystering” could not use their savings to buyland. In the neighborhood in which his father had grown up, Lewis saw the socialresults of the protection of white status the elder Douglass had warned about inBaltimore.22 [notes01.html#ch21fn_22a]In all, over the next twelve days, Douglass gave some six lectures at fivedifferent black and white churches in Baltimore and Washington, DC, including aversion of his “Mission of the War” address. But apart from all the publicoratory, and revealing his private desire to connect with his former owners, hecalled on Sophia Auld, the former mistress who had taught him his first lettersand who now lived on Ann Street. But she refused to see him; at the doorDouglass was rejected by Benjamin Auld, Sophia’s son and younger brother ofTommy, for whom Fred Bailey had originally been sent to Baltimore as the slavecompanion. Benjamin, now a Baltimore policeman, had read Douglass’sautobiography and let him know in no uncertain terms that his family resentedthe author’s treatment of them in the portrayal of his slave youth. In Bondageand Freedom, in the public “Letter to My Old Master,” and in many early speechesin Britain and America, Douglass had indeed assailed the Aulds as quintessentialmodels of evil slaveholders. He would have to wait many years for the genuinereconciliations he sought with the Aulds and their descendants.23[notes01.html#ch21fn_23a]• • •For Douglass, his family, and his closest friends, the final months of the CivilWar provided days of rejoicing and days of mourning. For Douglass, constantly onthe road lecturing, these months were frenzied and exhausting. After hisgrueling tour to Maryland in November, he was speaking in Portland, Maine, tobenefit a soldiers’ home by December 16. By January 2, 1865, he was one of manyspeakers—including Garrison and William Wells Brown—at the second annualcelebration of the Emancipation Proclamation in Tremont Temple in Boston. Twosessions occurred, one morning and one evening; Douglass and Garrison did nothave to share a platform. During an especially brutal Northern winter, inJanuary and February, the Rochester orator held forth at all kinds of “jubilee”meetings and benefits from Troy and Albany, New York, to Boston, to Wilmington,Delaware, and stops in between in Hoboken, New Jersey, New York City,Philadelphia, and again in Baltimore. In Douglass’s standard stump performancethat winter he exulted in the “events” that now seemed to happen with such“velocity” as to “dazzle us.” The Proclamation was the “mountain rock amid thedashing waves of a troubled ocean.” Lincoln’s reelection and black soldiers inthe field were causes for jubilation. But nothing was secure or lasting untilblack men attained the right to vote. Douglass warned that the freedpeople mustnot be “citizens in war and aliens in peace.”24 [notes01.html#ch21fn_24a] Realvictory was far from won.In Rochester, Anna, as always, kept the home fires burning in these winters asher husband rode the rails up and down the country. Her children all now grownand struggling to be independent, Anna had few companions other than whoever inthe Spring Street church may have looked in on her. Rosetta and her new babywere nearby, and no doubt Anna was indispensable to the young mother. The lonely“reserve” and “acrid” personality that Rosetta recalled about her mother onlydeepened in these winters, despite all the hopeful political and war news.Rosetta admiringly said her mother “strived to live a Christian life instead oftalking it.” But by 1865, Anna must have missed the older family “custom,” asher daughter recalled it, “to read a chapter in the Bible around the table, eachreading a verse in turn until the chapter was completed.”25[notes01.html#ch21fn_25a] Douglass himself, no doubt, chose those passages inthe children’s youth, giving Anna, as listener, her own personalized Biblestudy.Frederick Jr. never served as a combat soldier, but remained proud throughouthis life of having helped recruit especially members of the Fifty-FifthMassachusetts black regiment. He would not marry until 1870 and lived only to befifty-one, dying in 1892. He must have taken hard the news in December of thebloody Battle of Honey Hill, on Hilton Head, South Carolina, where theFifty-Fifth regiment lost nearly one hundred men. Charles and Frederick Jr., asthe youngest Douglass sons, wrote frequently to each other in that last year ofthe war. Charles worked at the freedmen’s hospital in Washington, DC, but as thewar wound down, he felt adrift, financially stunted, even desperate to find newemployment. He wrote to his father in February 1865 of his frustrations,thinking of relocating at war’s end to Nashville or Savannah, where he had heardrumors of business opportunities. “I mean to have some money,” Charles wrote,“and I want to go off . . . on my own hook as every young man does. I seenothing ahead for me unless I have money.” He still asked for his father’s“consent,” but insisted on a “bold start.” Such a sentiment reflected a longpattern of Charles’s desperation for the elder Douglass’s approval. “If I fail Iwill not return home a beggar,” he said. “I will stay and strive until I amworth something. I am in earnest and mean to go ahead.”26[notes01.html#ch21fn_26a] To the father who preached a stern self-reliance togatherings of black former slaves, these words must have been painful to readfrom his youngest boy, who had just turned twenty. To the son the father’s fameand achievement was one part inspiration and one part albatross.Meanwhile, Lewis Douglass, recovering from his war wounds in late 1864 and early1865, kept up his long, frustrating courtship of Amelia Loguen (they did notfinally marry until 1869). He wrote to Amelia of his desire to be “moreself-reliant, more independent.” He promised to labor at “making life,” andespecially at getting “money, for without that we would be like a ship without ahelm, soon to go wreck on the rock of poverty.” In September 1864, Lewis wishedhe had already proposed marriage to Amelia; but he could only conclude that thewar had left him “so unsettled,” without any clear “identity.” Feeling too oldto go back and live under his mother’s roof, he declared, “I do not know wheremy home is.” Amelia apparently stopped responding. By March 1865, Lewis wrote ofthe many weeks of “anxiety” over her silence. “What’s de matter,” he scrawled indialect. He described terrible spring floods in Rochester damaging “stone andbrick buildings,” and the Main Street bridge “knocked and bruised fearfully,” asthough they symbolized his own temperament. He did seem gleeful at least thatthe Confederacy was collapsing, “their vision of an empire founded on the unpaidtoil of black millions fading away from their longing sight.”27[notes01.html#ch21fn_27a] Lewis could craft prose almost like his father; hesimply was not having luck with love or with making a living. His model forachievement, much less greatness, was a mountain too high.The elder Douglass, however, managed a complicated romantic and emotional life.Ottilie Assing remained very much in love with Douglass through the end of theturbulent war years and beyond. Their relationship greatly frustrated her attimes, and at other times was richly fulfilling. Exactly what it meant to him isnot clear. He needed Ottilie for intellectual stimulation, emotional support,and perhaps physical intimacy; he continued to cultivate their long-termrelationship by stopping at her boardinghouse in Hoboken on his travels wheneverhe could, often for only one day and sometimes for as long as a week. Assingintroduced Douglass to her circle of Hoboken German émigrés, some of whom becamehis close friends, especially Sylvester Rosa Koehler, a much younger curator andart historian who took a deep interest in the American abolitionist.Astonishingly, Assing spent as many as three to four months in Rochester duringthe summers, living upstairs in the Douglass home, especially after 1865. Howshe and Mrs. Douglass coexisted in Anna’s house endures as an intriguingmystery, although by the frenzied war years and their aftermath, short- andlong-term guests, especially women, were hardly a new thing at the Douglasshomestead.28 [notes01.html#ch21fn_28a]Much of what we know about Assing and of her connection with Douglass comes fromOttilie’s letters to her sister, Ludmilla, who lived in Italy. Particularly asthe war ended, and Douglass searched for a new career, Assing dreamed andschemed assiduously from 1865 into the early 1870s to convince her specialcompanion to join her on a long-term, if not permanent, journey to Europe. Heprobably never seriously considered it, although he appears to have listened. Acommon refrain in Ottilie’s letters was that she stood “ready and willing” totravel back to Europe, “but could not convince Douglass and could not make up mymind to go by myself and to, on top of things, rob him of the only time of year[summer] that he looks forward to with joy and anticipation.” When in Rochester,Ottilie often appeared contentedly at home “on the green marvel island,” thehomestead surrounded by a large garden and orchard with well-kept walking paths.She constantly wrote of her pleasure in introducing books to Douglass andreading them with him, from Dickens to German and French works. In August 1868,a forty-nine-year-old Ottilie wrote from the hill on South Avenue that she wasso “completely content with the kind of garden life I am living here that I haveno desire for anything else.” If the domestic situation was awkward ordisappointing, which she would later say in embittered language, the “garden”itself had “a world to offer. . . . It constitutes a great pleasure for me tocollect fruit from under the trees every morning, which given the great size ofthe garden as well as the number of fruit trees can involve a rather longjourney.” She seems to have thrilled to the sheer “activity . . . the differentviews, the lighting and the constellation of clouds.” Her closest companion wasFox, her “civilized and most faithful cat.”29 [notes01.html#ch21fn_29a]Assing may have expunged loneliness at the same time she lived it in a differentway while in Rochester. Her secret garden was no secret at all to anyonelooking. Ottilie never wrote of Douglass taking long strolls with her in thegarden paths. That garden and orchard had been the product of Anna’s labor,imagination, and desire. But this poetic, deeply literary woman somehowestablished for a time her own place near, if not truly with, Douglass, andsomehow in the middle of Anna’s world. Assing never mentioned whether she peeledany of the pears she picked to help prepare a meal for all the mouths that werefed from the Douglass kitchen, where Anna ruled.Assing remained a frequent, astute commentator on the war, emancipation, andmany other issues in its aftermath as long as Morgenblatt maintainedpublication. She wrote at length and with acuity about the election of 1864. Themonths of the campaign brought a “fever pitch” and passed with “broodinganxiety.” Echoing Douglass’s speeches, she thought the election would determinethe “fate . . . of the entire country.” She effectively exposed some of the“sophistries” of Democrats and Copperheads, but held little enthusiasm forLincoln, whom she considered a political creature without a genuine antislaverycore. She preferred the alternative candidacy of the more radical Frémont, butas a political analyst, she delivered an astute explanation of his failure,especially in the wake of Union military successes. Assing voraciously readnewspapers and walked in the circles of radical German émigrés such as CarlSchurz. Never lacking for confidence in her own judgments, she drew class andethnic lines indelibly across American politics. Chief among supporters of theCopperheads, peace Democrats were the “crude, brutal, ignorant” Irish, “given todrink and full of hatred for the Negro.” Leading the way for the enlightenedRepublicans were “radical, educated Germans,” immigrants such as herself and herHoboken circle, who brought the “German mind” to the contest in their adoptedcountry. Assing told a poignant story of attending an election-eve speech bySchurz at the Cooper Institute in New York, crowds spilling into the hallways.The stage was decorated with “red, white, and blue” flags, and for a lectern,“they had piled up cannonballs” from which the orator delivered a brilliantendorsement of Lincoln’s reelection.30 [notes01.html#ch21fn_30a] Assingappreciated political symbolism as long as it did not embrace religion.Although Assing continually misapprehended Lincoln, her interpretation of theelection results was perceptive. Northerners had voted for “the completesuppression of the rebellion” and for emancipation. She saw the importance ofthe soldier vote, and by the beginning of 1865, much as Douglass had many timessaid, she put as much faith in the “suicidal blindness and rigidity” ofConfederate leadership, insisting on their “independence,” as in the “firmness”of the Lincoln administration. Assing had become not only an American citizen,but a talented political commentator on the “revolution” in her new country.31[notes01.html#ch21fn_31a] Whether Douglass read her columns is unknown. Buttheir encounters provided crucial occasions for the flow of ideas from whichboth of them benefited.She was “intoxicated with joy,” she reported on February 3, 1865, “about theadoption of the constitutional amendment in Congress” abolishing slavery.Working especially hard on a list of retiring Democrats and relying on eightothers who absented themselves from the chamber, the Lincoln administration andRepublican House leadership managed a decisive roll call of 119–56 in favor ofpassage of the enactment; they had only two votes to spare to rally the requiredtwo-thirds. Some states immediately ratified the Thirteenth Amendment, but fullratification by three-fourths of the states would not come until December 1865.There had never been a legislative moment quite like this when the simple butresounding language entered law: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been dulyconvicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to theirjurisdiction.” Emotionally, Assing almost choked on her astonishment: “Reality,at times, does go beyond anything the powers of imagination can draw up.”32[notes01.html#ch21fn_32a]Douglass lectured in Boston on January 27 and Troy, New York, on February 1.Hence, he could not be in Washington on January 31 to witness the unprecedentedjubilation that engulfed the congressional chamber the moment the amendment wasadopted. Republican Congressmen wept and shouted like revelers; they knew theyhad done something special, a historic act for the ages. Many blacks attendedthe session, sitting and standing in the galleries above with electricanticipation. Among them was Charles Douglass. Shortly afterward, he wrote tohis father, “I wish that you could have been here the day that theconstitutional amendment was passed forever abolishing slavery in the UnitedStates, such rejoicing I never before witnessed, cannons firing, people huggingand shaking hands, white people I mean, flags flying all over the city.” Charleswould never forget that day, nor did his father ever forget his son’s depictionof it: “I tell you things are progressing finely, and if they will only give usthe elective franchise and shoulder straps (which is only simple justice) thatwill be all I ask. . . . It is a big thing for me to see all this.”33[notes01.html#ch21fn_33a]• • •That tender son-to-father letter echoed some of the themes the elder Douglassproffered now out on the lecture circuit. From January to May 1865, throughoutthe Northeast and mid-Atlantic states, from Massachusetts to Delaware andMaryland, Douglass vehemently demanded the right to vote for black menguaranteed at the federal level. He warned of the poverty and lack of educationof the liberated freedpeople as well as the hostility and potential violence tocome from the white South in the wake of their defeat. He also articulated anevolving vision of Reconstruction. Everywhere he appeared, Douglass celebratedvictory as well as delivered warnings of the unprecedented struggles ahead. Totwo thousand people in Cooper Institute in New York he announced that they were“living at a glorious moment” in the nation’s history. But the Republican Partyhad to learn now to be as “logical” as the Democratic Party, by which he meantthat antislavery and pro-black-rights efforts had to overcome decades ofproslavery demands in law and morality.34 [notes01.html#ch21fn_34a]At every stop Douglass preached the moral value and the practical meaning of theright to vote. He called the prospect of the vote his “one idea.” Everythingelse—blacks’ demonstrated ability to work, to fight, to serve faithfully in theface of all manner of racism—depended on “the immediate, unconditional, anduniversal enfranchisement of the black man.” The vote had been earned in blood,it embodied citizenship, and it would be the freedpeople’s protector against the“treason” and “deadly hate” of the defeated Confederates. In a world whereAfrican Americans had never been taken seriously as a voting bloc, the franchisewould lift the “stigma of inferiority” from their heads.35[notes01.html#ch21fn_35a]Here was Douglass’s political liberalism at its most hopeful. But he almostnever recited his litany of reasons for the franchise without trotting out hisdrunken Irishman joke, especially among New England Yankees. He could easilygarner laughter and applause, as he did in Boston on January 26, with “If weknow enough to be hung, we know enough to vote. If the negro knows enough to paytaxes . . . he knows enough to vote. . . . If he knows enough to shoulder amusket and fight for the flag . . . he knows enough to vote. If he knows as muchwhen he is sober as an Irishman knows when drunk, he knows enough to vote.” Hewas eager to counter the Uncle Tom image of the quiescent black man, the“perfect lamb” exuding Christian piety but not standing up, demanding andfighting, while exploiting the “picture of the Irishman, drunk and goodhumored.” Moreover, he asserted African Americans’ claims to “a state ofcivilization” by contrasting them with “the Indians,” who may “die out.” “TheIndian, to be sure,” said Douglass, “is a stout man; he is proud and dignified;he is too stiff to bend, and breaks. He sees the plowshare of civilizationcasting up the bones of his venerated fathers, and he retires from the lakes tothe mountains. . . . He will not even imitate your wearing apparel, but clingsto his blanket, lives in hollow trees, and finally, dies.”36[notes01.html#ch21fn_36a]To these brutal racial images, Douglass compared “the negro,” who “likes to bein the midst of civilization,” in the “city . . . where he can hear the finestmusic, and where he can see all that is going on in the world.” A black man,declared Douglass with some obvious personal reference, “wears a coat after thelatest European pattern. . . . If you see him go down town and not see his face,you would think that it was a [white] man going along. They are not going to dieout.”37 [notes01.html#ch21fn_37a] Such egregious racial characterizations fitnineteenth-century popular attitudes as much as they clang painfully on our earstoday. But for a man who spent so much of his life trying to thwart America’sendemic racism, it is troubling to observe his use of racial and ethnicstereotypes to exalt the capacities and claims of his own people. So desperatewas America’s scramble for rights and resources among its marginalized peoplesthat even Douglass employed ugly language for comparative advantage.In the spring of 1865, however, Douglass tended to end his speeches on a highscriptural note, the parable of Lazarus and the rich man in Luke 16. Douglassbelieved that with emancipation and the defeat of Southern slaveholders,Americans witnessed the “fulfillment” of the tale of “a certain poor man wholaid at the gate of a rich man.” In the ancient story that has inspired a blackspiritual and a famous modern folk song (“Rock My Soul in the Bosom ofAbraham”), a rich man “was clothed in purple and fine linen, and faredsumptuously every day.” A poor beggar named Lazarus, “full of sores” fromleprosy, lay at the rich man’s gate, “desiring to be fed crumbs which fell fromthe rich man’s table.” Dogs lick the poor man’s wounds. Both men die; the beggaris “carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom,” while the rich man is buriedand descends into hell. As he begins to burn, the tormented rich man seesLazarus “afar off” resting in the comfort and security of Abraham’s embrace. Hecries out, “Father Abraham, have mercy upon me, and send Lazarus that he may dipthe tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue.” As the rich man is slowlyengulfed in flames, Abraham (God) answers that the tables have turned and it istoo late; he scolds the rich man for never listening to “Moses and theprophets.”38 [notes01.html#ch21fn_38a]Douglass brilliantly employed the parable, and his auditors seemed to love it.“Everybody is calling for Lazarus now at the North and the South,” he announced.“We all know who the rich man is in this country, and who the poor man is, orhas been.” “The slaves” were the “Lazaruses of the South, lying at the richslaveholder’s gates; but it has come to pass,” said Douglass in his best KingJames paraphrases, “that the poor man and the rich man are dead, for both havebeen in a dying condition for some time.” Eliciting great laughter and applausefrom a New York audience in January, he concluded that the “poor man is said tobe very near in Abraham’s bosom. And the rich man is crying out, ‘FatherAbraham, send Lazarus.’ ” By April in Boston, Douglass confidently applied thestory to Lincoln and the end of the war. Richmond had just fallen, the haughtyslaveholding Confederates were in flight, those “arrayed in purple . . . in silkand satin,” with “breast sparkling with diamonds,” were defeated and pleading tohave their Lazaruses back. “Send Lazarus back,” cried the rump of JeffersonDavis’s revolution and Robert E. Lee’s army. Douglass provided the new answers:“But Father Abraham says, ‘If they hear not Grant nor Sherman, neither will theybe persuaded though I send Lazarus unto them.’ ” With an arm gesture to the sky,Douglass shouted the transformation: “I say we are way up yonder now, nomistake!” With his audience shouting approval and in “great merriment,” Douglasshad recrafted a piece of Scripture to fit the moment of impending victory—forthe federal Union and for black freedom.39 [notes01.html#ch21fn_39a] Just howmuch the mortal Father Abraham’s bosom (the United States) could hold andcomfort the freedpeople as they came back to life was to be determined. And verysoon that mortal Abraham was gone.• • •Eager for a place at the center of American politics, especially amongRepublicans, as well as yearning to see, feel, and shape historic events,Douglass traveled to Washington, DC, in early March for Lincoln’s secondinauguration. Douglass arrived a couple of days earlier than the Saturday, March4, ceremony, on a crowded train at the B&O depot, where he listened to a bandplaying “The Battle Cry of Freedom.” The city was a rain-soaked mess, manystreets mere troughs of mud. Every hotel was jammed to capacity, with cotsassembled in hallways for the throngs of visitors. Although the end of the warwas in sight, Washington was anything but a festive national capital. Almostevery available building had become a hospital for the wounded and dyingsoldiers of the Union armies—some merely large makeshift sheds, others inchurches and armories, while still others were government buildings such as thePatent Office, and the Capitol itself. Amputees hobbling on crutches andstanding on corners with empty shirtsleeves could be spotted everywhere. Byspring 1865 nearly forty thousand liberated slaves had migrated into Washington,some living in freedmen’s villages and others always in search of housing andwork. Well over a thousand visible Confederate deserters had also swelled theranks of the military and civilian homeless by March, causing no shortage offear about violence and disorder.40 [notes01.html#ch21fn_40a] Lazarus, it turnsout, had come to Washington and was lying at the gates.Douglass remembered the scene in dramatic, novelistic language. He felt “danger”everywhere, he said, and “murder in the air.” The “rebellion” of theConfederacy, though almost spent, “had reached the verge of madness,” and itsvengeful agents lurked in the District’s muddy alleys. The day before theinaugural, Douglass took tea at the home of chief justice of the Supreme Court,Salmon Chase. The abolitionist wrote about the visit, and much else, as a seriesof steps in his own rising status. Chase had known Douglass from “earlyantislavery days,” but having the black leader for tea with “dignity andgrandeur” at his own table was in the guest’s view a public tribute. Douglassremembered fondly assisting Chase’s daughter, Kate, as she helped her father tryon his new robe for the inauguration.41 [notes01.html#ch21fn_41a] The formerslave surely felt like an insider in such private settings that he couldjustifiably make into racial triumphs.Douglass observed the parade on March 4, accompanied by Mrs. Thomas J. Dorsey,the former Louise Tobias and wife of a successful Philadelphia caterer, realestate entrepreneur, and former slave. Douglass had known the Dorseys a longtime as family friends; his daughter Rosetta had once boarded with them inPhiladelphia. He did not say why Mrs. Dorsey was his companion on such a specialday; perhaps her status as part of the Philadelphia black elite helped himsecure introductions and housing in Washington. As many as thirty thousandgathered for the ceremony on the East Portico of the Capitol. Douglass and Mrs.Dorsey secured a place in the crowd, standing in the center up front. After amorning of gale winds and hard rain, the skies cleared at the appointed hour.The sea of umbrellas disappeared, but Douglass still remembered the scene as oneof “leaden stillness.” While awaiting Chase’s administering of the oath,Douglass remembered seeing the sitting Lincoln tap Vice President Andrew Johnsonand point to the famous black orator up front in the crowd. The president“pointed me out to him.” Johnson’s initial reaction, wrote Douglass, as “thetrue index of his heart, was one of bitter contempt and aversion.” Then,recovering his poise, the “frown” changed to a “bland and sickly smile.” Theautobiographer used this recollection to draw a sharp distinction between themartyred Lincoln and the villainous Johnson. As Douglass later learned, Johnsonhad been inebriated, having indulged in whiskey due to an illness, for hisrambling formal speech inside the Capitol only a short time before taking hisplace for the outdoor ceremony.42 [notes01.html#ch21fn_42a] For Douglass, such amemory, crafted in 1881, was infused with the experience of confrontingJohnson’s white supremacy firsthand, as well as having battled the seventeenthpresident’s bitter obstructions of Reconstruction.Lincoln’s magnificent speech that day left Douglass breathless and clapping hishands “in gladness and thanksgiving.” He said it “sounded more like a sermonthan a state paper.” He was stunned by its biblical foundations, moved by theforthright statement of slavery as “cause” and emancipation as “result” of “thismighty scourge of war.” Douglass observed the lack of vindictive celebration,but felt thrilled by the sentiment of retribution, as Lincoln promised that“every drop of blood drawn by the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with thesword.” In Lincoln’s “woe due to those by whom the offence came,” Douglass heardechoes of his own jeremiads and his relentless war propaganda. He tried to readthe emotions of those around him in the audience, but found them “widelydifferent.” He would quote from the third paragraph of the Second Inauguralcountless times in the coming years. Douglass believed he had never heard such“vital substance . . . compressed in a space so narrow” as in the 703 words ofLincoln’s greatest speech. “There seemed at the time to be in the man’s soul,”Douglass declared in an 1893 speech, “the united souls of all Hebrew prophets.”For four long years of war, Douglass had dreamed of writing that speech forLincoln, to place such words in the president’s mouth as “all knew that thisinterest [slavery] was, somehow, the cause of the war.”43[notes01.html#ch21fn_43a] That Lincoln himself wrote those words in the tragicbut exhilarating spring of 1865 was the far more important fact. It was atribute to the power of events, to Lincoln’s own moral fiber and growth, as wellas to the political and rhetorical bond the former slave now felt with thepresident.On the evening of the inaugural, accompanied again by Mrs. Dorsey, Douglassstepped out and joined the “grand procession” entering the White Housereception. He later complained that many other blacks had refused to join him,complaining that they would be rejected. Douglass used the event as a source ofpersonal pride and distinction: “I had for some time looked upon myself as aman, but now in this multitude of the elite of the land, I felt myself a manamong men.”44 [notes01.html#ch21fn_44a] Douglass stood tall and confronted theWhite House guards.As the abolitionist and his black female companion approached the door of theexecutive mansion, two guards “took me rudely by the arm and ordered me to standback,” Douglass recalled, saying they could “admit no persons of color.” After alifetime of such rejections, Douglass rebelled and demanded entry. The guardsacquiesced deceptively by ushering the two African Americans into a hallwaywhere they found themselves “walking some planks out of a window” arranged as atemporary exit. Then Douglass, in raised voice, insisted someone inform thepresident, “Frederick Douglass is detained by officers at the door.” Soon he andMrs. Dorsey were allowed into the elegant East Room gala. “Like a mountain pinehigh above all others,” wrote Douglass, “Mr. Lincoln stood, in his grandsimplicity and homely beauty.”45 [notes01.html#ch21fn_45a]Then followed a scene for the ages as Douglass tells it. “Here comes my friendDouglass,” announced the president for all to hear. Lincoln said he had seen theorator in the crowd that afternoon listening to the speech and was eager to knowhis reaction. Douglass demurred, urging the president to attend to his guests.But focused fully on the unmistakable black man with the large mane of grayinghair, Lincoln insisted, “There is no man in the country whose opinion I valuemore than yours.” “Mr. Lincoln,” replied the former slave from Tuckahoe, “thatwas a sacred effort.”46 [notes01.html#ch21fn_46a] We do not know what small ordeeper talk ensued as other guests crowded into this special meeting of twoparts of America. We can only guess at the thrill in Douglass’s heart, knowingthat the cause he had so long pleaded—a sanctioned war to destroy slavery andpotentially to reinvent the American republic around the principle of racialequality—might now come to fruition. Standing in the White House East Room, theChesapeake Bay no great distance out of the windows to the east, Douglass couldfairly entertain the belief that he and Lincoln, the slaves and the nation, werewalking that night into a new history.• • •On the night of April 14, 1865, Good Friday, when the crack from John WilkesBooth’s pistol rang out in Ford’s Theatre, mortally wounding Abraham Lincoln inthe back of the head, Douglass had just returned to Rochester from speakingengagements in the East, where he had witnessed whole towns in great joy overthe Confederate surrender and the end of the war. He, like millions, would neverforget the moment he heard the news. Of the “many shocks” endured in four yearsof war by Americans, Douglass said in a speech some eight months later, theassassination of Lincoln was “heaviest of all.” Douglass called it a “grandconvulsion,” as if the “solid earth opened and swallowed up one of our chieftowns or cities.” The event instantly became an eternal marker in personal humanmemory. “A hush fell upon the land,” said Douglass, “as though each man in itheard a voice from heaven, an uninterpreted sound from the sky and had paused tolearn its meaning.” The extremes of feeling were all but impossible to bear, andas the historian Martha Hodes writes, in North and South, among blacks andwhites, “irreconcilable personal responses to Lincoln’s assassination” wouldalways be “intertwined with different understandings of the war that had justended.” Such it would be for Douglass, who over time fashioned several differentkinds of eulogies and symbols of the martyred Lincoln. Douglass never let hisaudiences forget that though Booth and his conspirators were individualassassins and fierce Confederate partisans, it was “slavery” itself, the“insolent, aggressive, and malignant oligarchy,” in a last spasm of madness,that had murdered the president.47 [notes01.html#ch21fn_47a]In Rochester, as in hundreds of other towns and cities across the North, as wellas in a thousand places in the South among former slaves, a springtime of reliefturned overnight into horror and mourning. On the fifteenth a huge throng ofpeople gathered at Rochester’s City Hall at 3:00 p.m., “not knowing what else todo in the agony of the hour,” as Douglass put it. Much of the crowd could noteven fit into the space, as Mayor Daniel Moore presided. Several clergymenspoke, including Ezekiel Robinson. Douglass was sitting at the rear of the hallas a loud chant began to ring out: “Douglass! Douglass! Douglass!” The mass ofpeople parted for a pathway as the orator walked to the platform. He recalledfeeling “stunned and overwhelmed.” In his remarks, he declared it a “day forsilence and meditation; for grief and tears.”48 [notes01.html#ch21fn_48a] Hetried to wrest hope from all the despair, and he was hardly silent.Less than twenty-four hours after the assassination, on that Easter weekend,Douglass insisted on seeing in the president’s sacrifice the nation’s new life:“Though Abraham Lincoln dies, the Republic lives.” In Lincoln’s “blood,” theywould find the “salvation of our country.” Douglass tried to mute hispartisanship in this time of grief, but he could not suppress it. The subduedaudience began to cheer, even laugh, as the orator complained that it was onlyyesterday that too many people “were manifesting almost as much gratitude toGeneral Lee for surrendering as to General Grant for compelling him tosurrender.” Douglass insisted on Appomattox as victory, not a story of mutualhonor. “Crimes of treason and slavery,” he demanded, ought not be met with“amnesty and oblivion in behalf of men whose hands are red with the best bloodof the land.” He pleaded that people not be too ready to “do the work ofrestoration,” not make “haste to nurse the spirit that gave birth to Booth.”49[notes01.html#ch21fn_49a]Douglass must have been carrying a copy of the Second Inaugural in his pocket,or perhaps by then he had memorized key passages. After telling of shakingLincoln’s hand on inauguration day a month earlier, the speaker deftly floatedinto the president’s poetry: “Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray that thismighty scourge of war may speedily pass away.” If Douglass did this from memoryor not, many in the crowd choked back gasps and tears. “Yet if God will that itcontinue until all the wealth piled by the bondman’s two hundred and fifty yearsof unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn by thelash shall be paid by another, drawn with the sword, as was said three thousandyears ago, so still must it be said, that the judgments of the Lord arerighteous altogether.” For so long Douglass wanted to write such words forLincoln to speak; now, he could indeed speak them for the president, in a shared“sacred effort.” Before he ended, the former slave put it all in a simpleparaphrase of Lincoln’s own argument: “Let us not forget that justice to thenegro is safety to the nation.”50 [notes01.html#ch21fn_50a]Image [../images/f0462-01.jpg]Abraham Lincoln, Washington, DC, February 5, 1865. Alexander Gardnerphotographer.Much later, in Life and Times, Douglass gave this moment a special personalmeaning: “I had resided long in Rochester and had made many speeches there whichhad more or less touched the hearts of my hearers, but never to this day was Ibrought into such close accord with them. We shared in common a terriblecalamity, and this touch of nature made us more than countrymen, it made usKin.” His use of the words countrymen and kin is revealing. So much of the war’smeaning, of his own life, were caught up in those words. In common grief withhis mostly white fellow citizens, the black orator felt a sense of belonging.The war had provided a common sense of nationhood, Lincoln’s death virtually acommon sense of family. Douglass had often used his own story as the embodimentof America’s representative exiled son. Out of a common search for meaning inLincoln’s violent death at the dawning of peace, Douglass felt a unity withother Americans. His sense of birthright may have felt more complete thatafternoon than ever before. The exiled son who had returned to the free state ofMaryland in late 1864 as Noah’s “sign” that the flood (slavery and the war) wasalmost over, was the same exiled son returning to Rochester in April 1865 toannounce national redemption through Lincoln’s blood. Both were homecomings, oneto Douglass’s native Maryland, and the other to his adopted western New York.His two lives, two homes, two sides of the Chesapeake, slavery and freedom, wereno longer divided. At least for now, Douglass could weep tears of kinship withhis countrymen.51 [notes01.html#ch21fn_51a]"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 22--------------------------------------------------------------------------------OTHELLO’S OCCUPATION WAS GONEBut where should I go, and what should I do? . . . A man in the situation inwhich I found myself has not only to divest himself of the old, which is nevereasily done, but adjust himself to the new, which is still more difficult.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1881On the eve of the war, Douglass was a frustrated leader of an enslaved people,considering emigration, and entirely closed out from Republican Party powerbrokers. Four years later, slaves, with joy and hardship, had experiencedvarying degrees of emancipation, and black soldiers were stationed across theSouth. President Lincoln and other Republicans had sought Douglass’s counsel. Byany definition a revolution had rolled over America. A new era in the nation’sracial history had begun, though few could envision the nature of its struggles.The future of that revolution left Douglass facing enormous personal andintellectual dilemmas. Just what did emancipation mean? Where was the stricken,devastated nation headed? Where in history, philosophy, or prophecy could hefind guideposts to help shape a new national order? Would the freed slavesachieve civil and political rights, and would they be protected by thegovernment that had helped to free them? What’s more, how would the drumbeatingwar propagandist, visionary of an apocalyptic struggle for black freedom and thedestruction of white slaveholders’ civilization, convert overnight into newroles and vocations? What would he do after abolition? What would hissoldier-veteran sons do with their lives? How would he, the family patriarch,support his extended and growing network of kinfolk? What would become of atroubled marriage now that all of Anna and Frederick’s children were adultsstarting their own families?Douglass had ceased editing his newspaper in August 1863—thatprofessional-emotional stem of his life for sixteen years as a radicalabolitionist. Although many others had earned the label, no African American hadtaken on the mantle of “leader” quite like Douglass. That leadership had beenrooted in the power of words. How would he now employ his incomparable voice?Who would be listening? If you have been the scorned outsider, what do you do ifthe door opens and they let you take the first steps inside? What does a radicalreformer do if his cause triumphs?In Life and Times in 1881, while reflecting back on the immediate aftermath ofthe war, Douglass admitted that “a strange and, perhaps, perverse feeling cameover me.” Great “joy” over the ending of slavery was at times “tinged with afeeling of sadness. I felt that I had reached the end of the noblest and bestpart of my life; my school was broken up, my church disbanded, and the belovedcongregation dispersed, never to come together again.” Antislavery had“performed its work,” its leaders no longer had the society’s attention. Thehuge audiences might never come back; the endless calls to lecture might cease.So Douglass drew from a scene in a Shakespeare tragedy to express his memory ofthat moment: “Othello’s occupation was gone.”1 [notes01.html#ch22fn_1a] For afew years he would struggle with this sense of personal displacement and fear ofirrelevance.Othello was the “moor of Venice” who was in love with a white woman and apowerful man losing his bearings. Douglass surely read the text of the play andfelt an affinity for its sense of lost authority and professional purpose. Hewas amply aware that in comparing himself to Othello he invoked one of the mostpotent symbols of racial and sexual mores in Western culture. Shakespeare’soriginal Othello was of noble royal origin, a former general of greatbattlefield achievement, and black. He marries the beautiful young Venetianwoman Desdemona. Iago, who has been to the wars with Othello, is his trustedfriend. The central drama, however, is how Iago in reality is the coy, vilevillain, hates Othello, and slowly renders him distressed and confused, thenfinally poisoned by jealousy and murderous revenge because of Desdemona’salleged infidelity with Cassio. Unaware of Desdemona’s innocence and Iago’sperfidy, the fated Othello kills his wife on her bed and, after the horrible,twisted discovery of the truth, kills himself as the confessed “fool” and iscursed by others as the “damned slave.”2 [notes01.html#ch22fn_2a]Image [../images/f0466-01.jpg]Ira Aldridge, famed Shakespearean actor, as Othello, c. 1870, postcard.In the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, moral questions about thepassion of jealousy, betrayal, or a woman’s alluring nature informed Americanreactions to Othello. But by the antebellum era, the Moor’s color and the matterof interracial marriage dominated the meaning of the play. From the 1820s,Othello was still widely staged, including in the South, but the lead characterwas increasingly lightened, even whitened or portrayed as tan or as a slightlyswarthy American Indian. The “sooty Moor” would no longer play for racistAmerican audiences, even in the North. If Othello appeared as a mulatto or anoctoroon, as he quite often did in these highly racialized times, the lessonmost Americans took was that whites and blacks ought never to mix.3[notes01.html#ch22fn_3a]In May 1869, at the brand-new Edwin Booth Theatre in New York, Douglass attendeda performance of Othello with Ottilie Assing and a group of her German friends(with the famous Booth, the assassin’s brother, in the lead role). We do nothave Douglass’s reaction to the night at the theater, but Assing called it a“magnificent evening . . . where we saw an amazingly beautiful performance ofOthello.” She thought Booth a “splendid Othello.” Booth recrafted and producedhis own Othello, published that year and premiered in his splendid new theater,complete with frescoed ceiling and statuary, at Twenty-Third Street and SixthAvenue. The play Frederick and Ottilie saw was Booth’s own. He had performedOthello for two decades by then, with his character wearing glittering Persiangowns, a purple-and-gold turban, speaking in a genteel, formal manner, andthoroughly purged of any taint of blackness. He was exotic and charismatic butcertainly no longer the African with a violent warlike history, craving andpossessing the white aristocrat’s daughter. Some lines that explicitly invokedrace were even expunged from Booth’s text.4 [notes01.html#ch22fn_4a]Whatever endured in Douglass’s mind and memory from that 1869 evening of seeingBooth’s Othello, all we know is that he turned to the noble Moor’s anguishedsoliloquy about lost masculine dignity and mental collapse as Douglassremembered his own professional and personal displacement in the wake of theCivil War:What sense had I of her stol’n hours of lust?I saw’t not, thought it not, it harm’d not me. . . .He that is robb’d, not wanting what is stol’n,Let him not know’t, and he’s not robb’d at all. . . .I had been happy, if the general camp,Pioneers and all, had tasted her sweet body,So I had nothing known. O, now for everFarewell the tranquil mind! Farewell content!Farewell the plumed troop and the big warsThat make ambition virtue! O, farewell,Farewell the neighing steed and the shrill trump,The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,The royal banner and all quality,Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war! . . .Farewell! Othello’s occupation is gone!It is possible that, like many other Americans, Douglass loved Shakespeare asmuch for the rhetoric and oratory as for the literature.5[notes01.html#ch22fn_5a] But he could not have read Othello without reflectingon its deep probings of the ideas of trust, fate, status inside or out of thestate, human evil, and interracial relationships. Douglass may have been saying“farewell” to his “big wars” in the late 1860s as well, but endless smallerones, in his public and private life, had only begun.• • •In the early Reconstruction years, Douglass did consider a variety of career andpersonal options. In 1865–66, feeling in flux, he may at least briefly havecontemplated an old urge to retreat to a life of farming if he could secure theright land. It is doubtful that he entertained such an idea for long. InRochester, among Amy Post’s correspondence, emerged the rumor that Douglass wasplanning to move to New Jersey (to be with Assing?). Salmon Chase, among others,invited Douglass to relocate to Alexandria, Virginia, to edit a new paper, towhich he responded that he had no desire to “court violence or martyrdom” bygoing to the former slave state. He did apparently have new “Baltimore dreams”and gave some thought to moving to the town from which he had escaped fromslavery. As the war ended in spring of 1865, Douglass confided as much to JuliaCrofts in England, who still devotedly raised money and sent it to her oldfriend for freedmen’s aid. In other letters he admitted his desire to meetThomas Auld again, and more important, he had already experienced a hero’swelcome in Baltimore and would again in September.6 [notes01.html#ch22fn_6a]Along with his sons, he may have imagined business opportunities in the postwarport city with a large black population.So worried was Crofts about Douglass’s plans that she begged him not to move:“Pray very dear friend, stay in the northern states & leave Baltimore an untriedfield of labor—do not throw your valuable life away venturing near the oldhouse—think of realities & let those romantic visions remain in abeyance.” Shebelieved Douglass would be a “marked man” in Baltimore or anywhere in the Southand pleaded with him not to even visit for lectures in the city of his slaveyouth. Indeed, Julia had reason to worry. In the wake of Douglass’s speeches inBaltimore in late 1864 or early 1865, an Augusta, Georgia, newspaper reported onhis performance: “This saucy negro, one of the ‘representative men’ of theNorth, delivered the subjoined address at Baltimore. Poor old Maryland! She hashad bitter pills enough, but here is something in the way of a black draught.”So constant was Douglass’s advocacy for black suffrage, and so eager was he forsome kind of foothold inside power, that any withdrawal to a quiet life, or along-term adventure in Europe with Assing, was never his desire.7[notes01.html#ch22fn_7a] After the war Douglass still wanted to affect historyand not be merely one of its symbols.In May 1865, the “black draught” joined his old friends and rivals at thethirty-second-anniversary meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in NewYork. The society engaged in an intense dispute over whether to disband in thewake of emancipation—to declare victory and fold its tent. Garrison, backed by afew loyalists, led the effort for dismemberment, declaring it “an absurdity tomaintain an antislavery society after slavery is dead.” But Wendell Phillips leda larger faction, outvoting Garrison 118–48, and urging the society to work forblack civil and political rights. Called on to speak, Douglass reflected withnostalgia on his first years out on the circuit with the old Garrisonians, butcommitted himself to the much “good antislavery work” yet to be done. He made anespecially forceful case for the right to vote. “Slavery is not abolished untilthe black man has the ballot,” Douglass asserted. As long as the word whitecould be inserted or even implied in new Southern state constitutions,abolitionists had not lost their occupation. Stay the course of faith anddevotion, Douglass counseled, quoting Exodus when Moses pleads with the peopleto believe that God will yet save them from the Egyptians: “Stand still and seethe salvation of God.” With Moses in the original Exodus, Douglass asked hisaudience for an almost unattainable faith. Believe, he exhorted, God’s promise:“The Egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them no more forever.” Buthe urged against any naïve trust of their former enemies in the proslaverySouth. “Think you that because they are for a moment in the talons and the beakof our glorious eagle, instead of the slave being there, as formerly, that theyare converted?” Abolitionists, Douglass argued, “had better wait and see whatnew form this old monster will assume.”8 [notes01.html#ch22fn_8a]By September, Douglass was back in Baltimore for a special occasion, thededication of a “Douglass Institute,” a cultural-educational enterprise foundedin a building of the former Newton University. The structure, on East LexingtonStreet, occupied by eight hundred people at Douglass’s address, had beenappropriated by the US army as a hospital during the war.9[notes01.html#ch22fn_9a] For this yet another extraordinary homecoming toBaltimore, Douglass crafted a beautiful address about the nature of education,civilization, and lives characterized by pursuits of the mind and soul and notmerely by laborer’s brawn. From a man with no formal schooling it was a movingembrace of intellect as well as an astute analysis of the history of racism.In an effort both sobering and hopeful, Douglass rejoiced in having his nameassociated with such a “first.” That blacks had rallied with some whitebenefactors to create an educational effort such as this was a “first sign ofrain after a famine . . . the first sign of peace after ten thousandcalamities.” Douglass spoke in personal as well as collective terms of learningand overcoming the “chains of ignorance” imposed by centuries of slavery. Thatblack people had been “shut out for ages from the arts, from science, and fromall the more elevating forms of industry, [or] the higher wants and aspirationsof the human soul,” was, Douglass believed, “a great fact” of their history.Hence, this new beginning was a sacred act of human striving. Douglass wishedthat separate black schools and associations were not necessary. But he acceptedtheir reality and used them as the source of a brilliant critique of racism.10[notes01.html#ch22fn_10a]Black “representative . . . distinguished men” were always considered“exceptions,” Douglass complained. Claims of black racial inferiority had overtime been met with historical arguments about the achievements of ancientAfrican civilizations in Ethiopia and Egypt or in the modern revolution inHaiti. Moreover, even pointing to the three centuries in which “Christendom” had“summoned heaven and hell” in forcing African peoples through the cruel filterof the slave trade had not converted the growing ranks of racial theorists. “Ourhistory has been but a track of blood,” said Douglass, and “mankind lost sightof our human nature in the idea of being property.” He then lamented as hecelebrated that black soldiers in the Civil War had proven “at least one elementof civilization . . . manly courage, that we love our country, and that we willfight for an Idea.” White civilization, Douglass argued, had for too long deniedblack people the fundamental element separating humans from all otheranimals—“consciousness,” the capacity to discern, write, and transmit history.Douglass asserted for his people the same powers of all other men: “He learnsfrom the past, improves upon the past, looks back upon the past, and hands downhis knowledge of the past to after-coming generations.” The former slave with nodegrees wanted any such school as the Douglass Institute to be a place fromwhich enlightenment and refinement in all their forms “shall flow as a river,enriching, ennobling, strengthening, and purifying all who will lave in itswaters.”11 [notes01.html#ch22fn_11a] In such an assessment of what it meant tobe human, Douglass sang out a kind of freedmen’s dream, as he also showed thathe had found at least a piece of Othello’s postwar occupation.• • •In the early years of Reconstruction, Douglass did settle into what he called “anew vocation . . . full of advantages mentally and pecuniarily.” He was stillvery much sought after as a lecturer, usually accruing $100 per night. His mostcommon speech was “Self-Made Men,” crafted first before the war and now infrequent demand after the conflict.12 [notes01.html#ch22fn_12a] But Douglass’ssubjects were also very much about Reconstruction, the nature of “the races,”freedmen’s rights, especially suffrage, and the increasing violence againstblacks in the South. He also sought and received invitations to speak inWashington, DC, at the center of the political tempest over Reconstruction. Hemissed his newspaper, but he now had easy access as a writer to several nationaljournals such as the Atlantic, the North American Review, and the Independent.Douglass saw Reconstruction and its unprecedented challenges as a continuationof the purpose of the war, a sacred responsibility to the Union dead and to 4million freed slaves. He also began to take a particular interest in Americanforeign affairs, especially in how a new United States—his nation now—mightexport its emancipationist vision to the Caribbean and elsewhere. The oldabolitionist was now a nationalist, and an emerging internationalist.Douglass’s vision of Reconstruction fell squarely into the Radical Republicancamp. Especially after congressional Republicans locked horns in political andideological warfare by 1866 with President Andrew Johnson for control of policy,Douglass grasped how “radicalism, far from being odious, is now the popularpassport to power.” He believed the establishment of a new order in the South,especially the protection of the freedmen’s rights, had to be done by activist,interventionist federal power. Douglass advocated what he called “something likea despotic central government” to vanquish, as much as possible, the traditionof states’ rights. In a statement that went to the heart of the eternal Americandilemma with federalism, the new doctrine of “human rights,” he maintained,could not prevail “while there remains such an idea as the right of each stateto control its own local affairs.”13 [notes01.html#ch22fn_13a] This old radicalhad found his own passport to power.Douglass believed slavery itself still lurked everywhere in the South, and likean incipient disease, it would infest all aspects of life if not once and forall killed. He saw Reconstruction, as he had the war, through an apocalyptichistorical lens. The “fiery conflict” had made possible the “nationalregeneration and entire purification” of the country, he wrote in 1866. But onlyif “authority and power” were exercised on the defeated South to render the“deadly upas, root and branch, leaf and fibre, body and sap . . . utterlydestroyed.” Douglass wanted the former Confederacy occupied and remade, with theformer slaves as the central agents of a political and social revolution. In theearly stage of the process, he nurtured the liberal faith that the franchisecould protect the freedpeople from the coming retribution of the white South.His was a vision of the war and Reconstruction as redemptive tragedy, not unlikeHerman Melville’s 1866 plea: “Let us pray that the terrible historic tragedy ofour time may not have been enacted without instructing our whole beloved countrythrough pity and terror.” While Melville wrote with bereaved wonderment aboutthe scale of the tragedy and the harrowing tasks of Reconstruction, Douglassexuded a millennial hope. To him the war had been an “impressive teacher . . .an instructor,” and in the end “society is instructed.”14[notes01.html#ch22fn_14a]But this moral sense of history had to be enacted in policy and againstformidable foes. Douglass learned this quickly about the new president, AndrewJohnson, and the ex-Confederates the Tennessean enabled. From humble origins,Johnson was a successful stump politician from east Tennessee. He had heldnearly every level of political office by the late 1850s: alderman, staterepresentative, congressman, two terms as governor, and US senator. Johnson wasthe only Southern senator from a seceded state who refused to follow his stateout of the Union in 1861. In 1862 Lincoln appointed him war governor ofTennessee; hence, his symbolic place on the ticket in the president’s bid forreelection in 1864. Although he opposed secession, Johnson was, nevertheless, anardent states’ rightist. He shared none of the Radical Republicans’ expansiveconception of federal power, and he was a staunch white supremacist who acceptedthe end of slavery but could not abide the idea of black civil and politicalrights. His philosophy toward Reconstruction rested in a slogan: “TheConstitution as it is, and the Union as it was.”15 [notes01.html#ch22fn_15a]Congress had recessed shortly after Johnson was sworn in after Lincoln’s death.So during virtually all of the rest of 1865, the new president’s lenient, rapid,presidential, and largely pro-Southern approach dominated what historian JohnHope Franklin once called “Reconstruction, Confederate style.” By September,when Douglass gave his speech in Baltimore about humane education and the natureof racism, Johnson had initiated a generous policy of pardons toex-Confederates. Johnson also returned a good deal of confiscated and abandonedlands to their former white owners in the South, while he also did his best tothwart the work of the Freedmen’s Bureau, the agency established to providerations to hundreds of thousands of black and white war refugees as well asadjudicate new labor contracts for freedmen. In December, as Congressreconvened, Johnson declared Reconstruction complete eight months afterAppomattox. The former states of the Confederacy had all drafted newconstitutions and passed a wide array of “black codes,” restricting freedmen’slives. It seemed to many, Douglass certainly, that blacks were being returned toservility, and no one would be held responsible for the war as many formerConfederates were elected to serve in Congress. Hence, his fears stated back inMay that if left to their own devices, white Southerners, “by unfriendlylegislation, could make our liberty . . . a delusion, a mockery.” At Baltimorein September he warned about “the persistent determination of the presentExecutive of the nation . . . to hold and treat us in a degraded relation.”16[notes01.html#ch22fn_16a]Douglass saw Confederate Reconstruction coming, but was still shocked by itsbrazen effrontery. Congressional Republicans called an immediate halt topresidential Reconstruction in late 1865 and early 1866. Congress devised theJoint Committee on Reconstruction, with fifteen members, twelve of whom wereRepublicans, which in January and February conducted extraordinary publichearings to investigate the conditions on the ground in the South. Theseunprecedented hearings heard the testimony of 144 witnesses, including Unionarmy officers and Freedmen’s Bureau agents; the ex-Confederates included noneother than Robert E. Lee himself and former vice president Alexander H.Stephens, who offered a defense of secession and states’ rights. Theoverwhelming message of the hearings, especially from federal military andcivilian personnel, was that martial law, Union troops, and the Freedmen’sBureau were all dire necessities to quell violence and restore social order.17[notes01.html#ch22fn_17a]Freedmen’s Bureau agents reported over and again about violence againstex-slaves, including whippings, ritualistic torture, and murders. One describedhuge problems negotiating wage contracts with unwilling planters, and a “generalhatred of the freedmen.” Typical of Union officers’ testimony was that ofGeneral Clinton B. Fisk, who had spent the war and its aftermath in Tennesseeand Kentucky. He traveled incognito from plantation to plantation, talking toplanters and “negroes in their quarters.” Fisk had seen “slaveholders andreturned rebel soldiers . . . persecute” the freedmen, “pursue them withvengeance . . . and burn down their dwellings and schoolhouses.” The JointCommittee concluded that allowing ex-Confederates to rule in their former stateshad been a policy of “madness and folly,” and it called for major legislationthat would provide “adequate safeguards” for social order and freedmen’srights.18 [notes01.html#ch22fn_18a] Later that spring and early summer, thisseismic shift in Reconstruction policy and politics led to passage of a newFreedmen’s Bureau bill, the first Civil Rights Act of American history, and theFourteenth Amendment.In the midst of the hearings, and the standoff between president and Congress,various groups of black men came to Washington to lobby the legislature fortheir rights. Some were denied entry to the galleries, much less the halls oflobbying. In a letter to Senator Charles Sumner, signed by Douglass and his sonLewis, among many other black leaders, they declared that out of “self-respect”they would not “consent to be colonized” in the US Capitol. Douglass led adelegation of thirteen men (twelve black, including Lewis, and one white) to theWhite House for an extraordinary meeting with Johnson. They were not invited,but inspired by the Republican resurgence in the capital they insisted on anaudience with the chief executive. George T. Downing of Washington, DC, sharedthe leadership and presentation with Douglass; the two had planned this effortto confront Johnson since mid-January, although Lewis played a key role as wellin corresponding with the various members. Downing, a former successful hotelowner and caterer, current manager of the House of Representatives dining room,led off with a prepared statement in which the group declared the ThirteenthAmendment insufficient. Speaking for all black Americans, they demanded “theirrights as citizens” and “equality before law.” Above all, they insisted on being“fully enfranchised . . . throughout the land.” Then Douglass stepped forwardwith formal deference. But unmistakably, he invoked Johnson’s “noble and humanepredecessor” as he demanded the “ballot with which to save ourselves.” Whetherhe fully knew it or not, by his choice of words Douglass stoked Johnson’s angerand deepest prejudices, baiting him with what had to seem false respect: “In theorder of Divine Providence you [Johnson] are placed in a position where you havethe power to save or destroy us; to bless or blast us.”19[notes01.html#ch22fn_19a]Johnson’s rambling replies stand as perhaps the worst exchange an Americanpresident ever conducted in person with African American leaders. The presidenttook the bait in his forty-five-minute speech. Johnson self-righteously declaredhimself ready to be the “Moses” of the freedpeople. One can only imagineDouglass’s thoughts as he sat across the room from the president, less than ayear after Appomattox, and heard him declare “the feelings of my own heart . . .have been for the colored man. I have owned slaves and bought slaves, but Inever sold one.” For the moment Douglass and his colleagues suppressed bothlaughter and outrage. Then Johnson complained that in his relationship to blacks“I have been their slave instead of their being mine. Some even followed mehere, while others are occupying . . . my property with my consent.” If thesanctimonious Tennessean had not offended his guests enough, he then threw a jabright at Douglass. He did “not like being arraigned,” Johnson spouted, “by somewho can get up handsomely rounded periods and deal in rhetoric, and talk aboutabstract ideas of liberty.” The president brandished his fear of race war if hisguests pursued their goals, coldly rebuked Douglass’s advocacy of blacksuffrage, and suggested that colonization was still the best option for thefreedpeople.20 [notes01.html#ch22fn_20a] Douglass felt thrown back in time asthough history had stopped somewhere before 1861.Douglass tried to respectfully interrupt the host’s obfuscating rejection ofvoting rights, but Johnson quickly stopped him with “I am not quite through.”The president urged Douglass to consider the plight of poor, non-slaveholdingwhites, arguing that during slavery “the colored man and his master combined tokeep him [the poor white] in slavery.” Addressing Douglass directly, Johnsonasked, “Have you ever lived on a plantation?” “I have, Your Excellency,” repliedthe former slave. As Douglass tried to engage in a colloquy, Johnson pursued himwith a nearly nonstop barrage. The guest had to listen as the president declaredthe abolition of slavery merely an “incident to the suppression of therebellion” and predicted a “war of the races” if blacks got access to theballot. Worse, Johnson insisted that nothing could ever be forced upon themajority of a community “without their consent.” When Douglass objected to thisdefense of states’ rights doctrine, remarking, “That was said before the war,”Johnson shot back angrily, “I am now talking about a principle . . . afundamental tenet in my creed that the people must be obeyed.” Then, the leaderof the country asked the former slave, “Is there anything wrong or unfair inthat?” To which Douglass, according to the stenographer, “smiled” and replied,“A great deal wrong, Mr. President, with all respect.” With derision in eachman’s demeanor, Douglass and Johnson then continued a tense, fruitlessgive-and-take for several minutes longer, the president making it clear heintended to have no debate and Douglass equally clear that he would not backdown.21 [notes01.html#ch22fn_21a]Before leading the delegation out of the room, Douglass staked out a position.He reminded Johnson that if black life and liberty were left to the whims ofSouthern whites, the freedmen would be “divested of all political power.”Douglass summed up their impasse to Johnson’s face: “The very thing YourExcellency would avoid in the Southern states can only be avoided by the verymeasure that we propose.” The meeting could hardly have ended in a worse manner.If the black delegation felt disgusted, Johnson was livid. According toJohnson’s private secretary, “The President no more expected that darkeydelegation yesterday, than he did the cholera.” As the secretary reported to theNew York World, after the black delegation left the room at the White House,Johnson declared, “Those d__d sons of b__s thought they had me in a trap. I knowthat d__d Douglass; he’s just like any nigger, & he would sooner cut a whiteman’s throat than not.”22 [notes01.html#ch22fn_22a] Douglass met manypresidents; sobering as it was, he may have perversely held Johnson’s epithetsas a badge of honor.Before the day was over, the delegation met with a group of Republicancongressmen for a debriefing and signed a public response to Johnson. Drafted bythe elder Douglass, dictated to Lewis, the statement did not mince words. Itcalled Johnson’s “elaborate speech . . . entirely unsound and prejudicial.” Thegroup rejected the president’s stance against black enfranchisement on thegrounds of old hatreds between poor whites and former slaves. Blame for suchanimosity lay with white masters, argued the black leaders. “They divided bothto conquer each.” They told Johnson they would not back down under anycircumstances, reminding him, in one of Douglass’s old abolitionist maxims, that“men are whipped oftenest who are whipped easiest.” Finally, they unequivocallydenounced Johnson’s embrace of colonization as a discredited, proslavery“theory” of human degradation.23 [notes01.html#ch22fn_23a]• • •As Douglass looked about for that “new vocation” in the wake of the war, hequickly realized that the revolution of emancipation had only begun. In the epiccontest over Reconstruction policy in Washington, he discovered his new raisond’être. It was not unlike his career as he had always known it. “I . . . soonfound,” he later wrote in an understatement, “that the Negro had still a cause,and that he needed my voice and pen . . . to plead for it.” Before the end ofthe year and into 1867, Douglass took a remarkable speech on the road, “Sourcesof Danger to the Republic.” In cities from Brooklyn to St. Louis, Douglassskewered Johnson as an “unmitigated calamity,” and a “disgrace” the country must“stagger under.” So fearful of the situation was the orator that he went so faras to recommend a major constitutional revision, eliminating the president’sveto and pardon powers, as well as the vice presidency itself. These measuresreflect as much his visceral hatred for Johnson as prudent constitutionalthinking. But Douglass did leave a timeless maxim for republics: “Our governmentmay at some time be in the hands of a bad man. When in the hands of a good manit is all well enough. . . . We ought to have our government so shaped that evenwhen in the hands of a bad man we shall be safe.”24 [notes01.html#ch22fn_24a]A full twenty-five years into his public life, Douglass seemed to have realizedyet again the nature of his only true weapon—words, spoken and written.Increasingly now, he wanted to get to the center of American political life,Washington, DC, and if possible, inside the circle of Republican Party leaders.He sought more lecture opportunities in the capital, spoke on politicalsubjects, especially stressing the all-important matter of black suffrage. Hecultivated growing friendships with congressmen and senators such as CharlesSumner, as well as with Chief Justice Salmon Chase. As a matter of livelihood,Douglass still conducted long, backbreaking lecture tours all over the country.Reconstruction was for Douglass the new cause not unlike the old abolitioncrusade; the revolution of Union victory and black emancipation could still belost or won.Douglass made no real distinction between Johnson’s white supremacy and slaveryitself. A constant refrain in his postwar rhetoric was his assertion that“slavery is not abolished until the black man has the ballot.” In thisreasoning, as long as Johnson controlled Reconstruction, the war was not over.The Slave Power endured, Douglass believed, in the handful of conservativeRepublicans and the droves of Democrats who supported Johnson’s efforts tothwart the crucial legislation brewing up from Radical Republicans in Congress.In a private letter to Sumner, Douglass drew his line clearly. Formerslaveholders should never be “trusted to legislate” about black rights. “UntilRedeemers come from the pit instead of paradise, until the temperance cause canbe left to rumsellers, until the morals of society can be safely committed tothe care of those who habitually outrage all the decencies of life, the freedmencannot be safely left to the care of their former masters.”25[notes01.html#ch22fn_25a] The revolution was unfinished.Douglass’s grueling travel and lecture schedule in 1866 may not have allowed himto follow as closely as he might have the great debates in Congress over passageof the Civil Rights Act in April and the Fourteenth Amendment in June.Invitations poured in to speak all over the North. Douglass’s son Charles, anddaughter Rosetta, living in Rochester, tried frustratingly to keep up with theirfather’s whereabouts as they processed his correspondence during 1866–67.Itineraries indicate that on the two days after the White House meeting withPresident Johnson, Douglass spoke in Philadelphia and Baltimore respectively.Four days after that, February 13, he was back in Washington lecturing, followedby five consecutive days in Pittsburgh, and then immediately by a full week ofengagements out in Illinois, where he spoke in the State House in Springfield.Through bone-numbing travel by railroad, he was again speaking back inWashington, DC, and its environs on March 6–10.26 [notes01.html#ch22fn_26a] Theorator had hardly lost his occupation; he emerged in 1866 and 1867 as one of themost prominent itinerant spokesmen of freedmen’s rights and the RadicalRepublican effort to shape Reconstruction.Douglass’s newly achieved enemies were well aware of the former abolitionist’seffective voice in the national political arena. It would have pleased Douglassto know how much correspondence arrived at the White House condemning him forhis well-publicized confrontation with Johnson. A former Democratic Partycabinet official, William L. Hodge, applauded Johnson’s resistance to Douglass’s“impudence” and “attempt to cram the negro wool & all down our throats.” AnotherDemocrat, James H. Embry, monitored the black orator’s speech in Philadelphia onFebruary 9. Referring to him only as “Fred Douglass,” Embry said the speaker was“grossly insulting and abusive” and “gave loose rein to satire, anger andslander.” Commenting especially on how blacks and whites had shared the sameplatform in proximity, Embry nevertheless told Johnson not to worry. The speechwas only important as being the utterance of his friends in Washington, and hemerely the Mask behind which they strike.” Douglass would not have beenflattered by the racist accusation sent to Johnson by a more humble Michigansupporter, complimenting the president: “You was more than a match for the greatFred Douglass. . . . Many fanatics think their Pet Douglass is far a head ofYour Excellency in profound wisdom.” By March administration friends wrote towarn the president and his aides that Douglass was coming back to Washington to“excite the negroes to rebel.” By May, some Democrats called Johnson’s argumentthat black suffrage would stimulate race war (put forth to the February blackdelegation) “your Douglass argument.”27 [notes01.html#ch22fn_27a] These lettersprovide a glimpse into a kind of nineteenth-century parlor racism. If the oldabolitionist needed a new occupation, he surely had one now—the frighteningblack man with brains who had penetrated the racist psyches of powerful peoplewith words and his physical presence.Although none had dispatched him to the hustings as their mask and he felt likeno one’s pet, Douglass had more allies among Republicans than he realized. LymanTrumbull, a moderate Republican senator from Illinois, had been a principalauthor of the Confiscation Acts and the Thirteenth Amendment. Now, Trumbullcrafted the new Freedmen’s Bureau bill, and the Civil Rights Act of 1866.Douglass never developed a close relationship with Trumbull, whose politicalallegiances varied over time. Although both measures contained elements thatdisappointed Radicals, Douglass saw their enormous potential to his cause. Therenewal of the Freedmen’s Bureau over Johnson’s veto brought hope to insecureformer slaves in the South. The Civil Rights Act, which passed by a two-thirdsvote in Congress on April 9, overriding the president’s veto, was a remarkabledeparture in federal power and in central-government state relations. It did notinclude political rights, to Douglass’s chagrin, but it created nationalcitizenship for all persons (except Indians) born in the United States, and itidentified some “fundamental rights,” as Trumbull put it, newly guaranteed to“every man as a free man.” Those rights included elements of contract law andprotection of free labor. The law also stipulated that cases of discriminationwere to be heard in federal and not state courts, although it lacked precisionon how such a process would be adjudicated. Moreover, the law was vague in thatit largely addressed public and not private acts of injustice. The Civil RightsAct of 1866 was above all the first effort to breathe meaning and enforcementinto the Thirteenth Amendment.28 [notes01.html#ch22fn_28a]Johnson’s strident veto message, laced with a staunch states’ rights positionagainst all manner of “centralization” of power in the federal government, aswell as with blatant white supremacy, invoking fears of racial intermarriage,caused a permanent break between the executive and the legislature, and set thestage for two years of constitutional crisis. Johnson even claimed that toextend the rights of blacks would discriminate against whites. He consideredsuch expansion of civil rights “fraught with evil” and “made to operate in favorof the colored and against the white race,” a set of notions some whiteAmericans still cling to in the twenty-first century.29[notes01.html#ch22fn_29a] When Douglass lampooned Johnson out on the stump, hedid so with good reasons.Douglass did not develop strong ties with John Bingham or Thaddeus Stevens inthe House of Representatives. Bingham was the principal author of section one ofthe Fourteenth Amendment, and Stevens the most Radical among the Republicanarchitects of Reconstruction policy, and often its House floor manager. Binghamwas a Christian abolitionist and Ohio congressman who had served as a judgeadvocate in the Union army, as well as on the commission that tried theconspirators in the Lincoln assassination in 1865. He had entered Congress in1854; his political career was a deep reflection of the antislavery history ofthe Republican Party. He believed the liberation of the slaves had forced theUnited States to federalize the Bill of Rights and apply it to all Americans.Bingham considered the “rights of citizenship” the same as the “sacred rights ofhuman nature.” Stevens too embraced equality. The Pennsylvanian, alreadyseventy-four years old and soon to die, in 1868, imagined Reconstruction as amovement to “rebuild a shattered empire . . . to plant deep and solid thecorner-stone of eternal Justice, and to erect thereon a superstructure ofperfect equality of every human being before the law.”30[notes01.html#ch22fn_30a]Inadvertently, Bingham and Douglass agreed on all the basics of Reconstruction.They employed similar apocalyptic rhetoric as well as the antislaveryinterpretation of the Constitution honed in abolitionist circles during the1850s. The new cast-iron dome of the US Capitol was now completed to fullmajesty when Bingham stood in the House chamber on January 25, 1866, andintroduced the Fourteenth Amendment. He insisted that the war had made theamendment necessary, though “not without sorrow, not without martyrdom . . . notwithout storm and tempest . . . and fire running along the ground.” He insistedthat the federal government enforce “equality” not merely as an abstraction but“in the states.”31 [notes01.html#ch22fn_31a] In the states.Douglass closely followed the congressional debates and the Joint Committee’shearings and its report in the press that winter. In language so similar to thatDouglass had used ever since Appomattox, he observed Johnson’s “anti-coercivepolicy” characterized as “matchless wickedness,” and tantamount to the“surrender by Grant to Lee.” Douglass applauded Bingham’s forceful denunciationsof states’ rights doctrines and his assertion of the “national authority” toenforce equality before law. Had Douglass attended congressional sessions, hewould have relished Bingham’s condemnation of opponents of the amendment as“conspirators” and “prodigal rebels,” their Northern allies as “traitors whosehands are red with the blood of murder and assassination, who for four yearsstruck at the life of its [the government’s] defenders.”32[notes01.html#ch22fn_32a] Such words were political music in Douglass’s ears.During the first six months of 1866 Republicans faced several great challenges.Three of them they met straight on in settled terms: defining citizenship;repudiation of Confederate war debts, including any claims to compensation forloss of slave property; and disqualification of ex-Confederates fromofficeholding. But three others remained historically unresolved and made theFourteenth Amendment limited and controversial, though revolutionary. They didnot settle the extent of the right to vote for black men and left women out ofsuffrage altogether; they did not give precision to the extent of civil rightsmade equal before law; and they struggled to reapportion representation of the“slave seats” given the Southern states under the “three-fifths clause.”33[notes01.html#ch22fn_33a]But Bingham’s section one of the Fourteenth Amendment was something Douglasscould embrace as a talisman; it was emancipation etched in parchment, enduringto this day as the most influential and far-reaching constitutional result ofthe Civil War. It attempted, on the matter of individual civil rights, to makethe United States one body of people equal before law and not subject to localor state practice. At least in law, after embittered debate, when the amendmentpassed the Senate on June 8 by 33–11, and the House by 138–36, a secondConstitution in America was born. Despite the myriad uses and abuses of theFourteenth Amendment over time, and endless conservative attempts to thwart itsegalitarianism, it is always worth remembering the enactment’s immediate roots.Without the liberation of 4 million slaves, section one could never have beenenshrined into America’s legal DNA in the nineteenth century. Its two carefulsentences are a resounding answer to the ghostlike language of Roger Taney inthe Dred Scott case:All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to thejurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State whereinthey reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge theprivileges and immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any statedeprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of thelaws.34 [notes01.html#ch22fn_34a]Section one was a dream come true for old abolitionists. But as an adamantadvocate of universal black male suffrage, Douglass found elements in sectiontwo of the Fourteenth Amendment that led him to oppose it during the comingyear.Black suffrage was still the greatest obstacle, even for Radical Republicans.Indeed, the Fourteenth Amendment contained sufficient ambiguity, especiallyabout voting rights, that some Radicals opposed its ratification. Section twoaddressed suffrage, but extended the right to vote directly to no one. Itstipulated that for whatever number of males denied the right to vote in a givenstate, that state’s representation in Congress would be “reduced inproportion.”35 [notes01.html#ch22fn_35a] The measure represented one of thehard-won but awkward compromises that made passage of the amendment possible inthe ideological hurricane of 1866.• • •As Douglass barnstormed across the country from Rochester to Washington, and outto Illinois prairie towns and back again, from February until April 1866, heferociously attacked Johnson and the conservatives. His ridicule of thepresident was so aggressive that occasionally a venue would refuse to allow hisspeech, and some groups protested his appearances. He wished that the status ofblacks might be “settled” by Reconstruction legislation. But the nation, hefeared, would now “leave in the soil some root or fibre out of which may springother rebellions and other assassinations [like Lincoln’s].” If he were a“minister of the Gospel,” Douglass told a Washington audience, he would“preach . . . for six months from one text. . . . Remember Lot’s wife.”36[notes01.html#ch22fn_36a]The story in Genesis 18–19 is about God’s awesome power to cause hopefulbeginnings as well as dreadful endings by retributive justice. For their manysins, Sodom and Gomorrah are destroyed by God raining “brimstone and fire” downon them. But Lot and his family are alerted to flee, then rescued and saved inthe mountains, excepting Lot’s wife, who, warned not to look backward at thedevastation, disobeys and is instantly “consumed” into a “pillar of salt.” Onthe morning after, Abraham, patriarch of the whole biblical tradition, stands onthe mountain and surveys the “plain” smoldering below in utter ruin. But Lot andhis daughters are saved because “God remembered Abraham,” as he had alsoremembered Noah after the flood. For Douglass the Old Testament was a templateof pliant stories and historical lessons. In this case, the orator used theimage of Abraham looking down upon the destroyed landscape to demand thatAmericans look down upon their own recent self-destruction, and all butunjustified survival, and remember. Desperately, Douglass announced, he “wouldshow that nations should have memories.” As the biblical scholar WalterBrueggemann contends, this story makes us “see” the destruction we haveourselves caused, to know it, feel it, and remember it. “With Abraham,” we canthen “know something urgent about God’s call to us.”37 [notes01.html#ch22fn_37a]In 1866–67 Douglass demanded resistance to Johnson and his minions; repeatedly,he urged the victorious North to hear the call of remembrance.“FREDERICK DOUGLASS ON THE PRESIDENT’S POLICY!” shouted a broadside announcingthe orator’s speech at the “Assembly Rooms” on Louisiana Avenue in Washington onMarch 10. Here Douglass faced an audience he relished; it included the RadicalPennsylvania congressman William D. Kelley, Senators Richard Yates of Illinoisand Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, and especially General Oliver O. Howard, thedirector of the Freedmen’s Bureau. This was the kind of political power centerhe sought. Douglass delivered a fierce defense of the integrity of “the Negro.”Contrary to predictions, they would never “die out,” despite ubiquitous imagesof them for white eyes at the mercy of “the lash, the bloodhound, and theauction-block.” Blacks had risen from the depths of generations of enslavementto the heights of respectability, and hence the nation was “honor bound” to givethem the franchise. Only the vote could provide self-protection. With“considerable humor and a good deal of sarcasm,” wrote a reporter, Douglasspilloried Johnson for his racist contradictions expressed in their White Housemeeting. The chief executive’s anxieties about race mixing, said the formerslave, ought to be assuaged since “the white man and the negro agreed well”within his (Douglass’s) own blood. “What shall be said of Andrew Johnson?”Douglass asked. Better, he concluded, to “leave Mr. Johnson speak for himself asbeing the most damaging thing he can do.” The president had “promised to be theMoses of the colored race,” but was readily becoming “their Pharaoh.” Then,Douglass tested the limits of propriety, saying that Johnson need not fear“physical assassination” from blacks. That would add nothing to the“refinements” of society; instead they only intended his “moralassassination.”38 [notes01.html#ch22fn_38a]• • •Over the summer of 1866, Douglass joined forces with old abolitionist friendsGerrit Smith and Wendell Phillips and openly opposed the Fourteenth Amendment onthe grounds that it did not explicitly provide black suffrage. As the pivotalfall congressional elections loomed, the Republicans were deeply divided on thequestion of black voting rights. Thaddeus Stevens, who was a complex mixture ofidealism and pragmatic politics, urged caution on suffrage, knowing that thevast majority of white Northerners, even Republicans, would not welcomepolitical equality for blacks any more than they would social equality. Northernvotes and control of Congress against Johnson’s conservative coalition were atstake. But in this instance Douglass’s own hard-earned sense of politicalpragmatism dissipated. He simply could not countenance citizenship without theright to vote. In July, he made the case in the National Anti-Slavery Standardthat he had made on so many platforms. “Equal” citizenship, he said, without thefranchise was “but an empty name. . . . To say that I am a citizen to paytaxes . . . obey laws . . . and fight the battles of the country, but in allthat respects voting and representation, I am but as so much inert matter, is toinsult my manhood.”39 [notes01.html#ch22fn_39a] In 1866–67, Douglass’s politicalsensibilities careened between exhilaration and outrage.Douglass also grew discouraged at the constant news of mob violence emanatingfrom the South. Nothing tarnished the theory at the heart of politicalliberalism—that the vote could protect people—quite like the horrificriots/massacres in Memphis, May 1–13, and in New Orleans, July 30–31. The blackpopulation of Memphis had quadrupled during the year since the war. Hundreds offreedmen and black soldiers were now a very visible part of the city’s life.When two horse-drawn hacks collided, one driven by a white man and the other ablack, and black troops intervened, violence exploded for three days. White mobsattacked black communities; when the smoke cleared, forty-eight people weredead, all but two black. Five black women were raped, and African Americanhouses and churches, as well as Freedmen’s Bureau schools, torched. In theCrescent City, a new radical legislature, and a public procession of some twohundred black supporters, many of whom were former Union soldiers, tried toassemble. But city police, led by Confederate veterans, attacked the gathering,and gun battles broke out in the streets. Delegates and allies were shot down asthey attempted to leave the convention hall under cover of white flags. The NewOrleans bloodbath left thirty-four blacks and three white Radicals dead, and atleast a hundred more wounded. The recalcitrant white South had risen with thevengeance Douglass had predicted.40 [notes01.html#ch22fn_40a]• • •In August, the National Union Convention met in Philadelphia to rally aroundJohnson’s policies. As a symbol of the sectional reunion that Johnson wanted todeclare accomplished, the South Carolina ex–Confederate senator and currentgovernor, James L. Orr, and former Union general Darius N. Couch walked into theconvention arm in arm. Appalled by this display of obeisance to the formerConfederate states, and against the backdrop of broad public awareness ofantiblack violence, Republicans decided to convene their own counterconventionof “Southern Loyalists” in Philadelphia. Hundreds of Northern Republicansattended as honorary delegates, including Douglass, who was unexpectedly electedby fellow party members in Rochester. Demonstrating the depth of Republicansqueamishness about black suffrage and the delicacy of the fall elections, noneother than Thaddeus Stevens had urged Rochesterites not to send Douglass.Flouting Stevens or anyone else arguing that a black leader should remaininvisible at this juncture, Douglass departed Rochester with a public statement:“If this convention will receive me, the event will certainly be somewhatsignificant progress. If they reject me, they will only identify themselves withanother convention,” Johnson’s.41 [notes01.html#ch22fn_41a] Douglass knew therewas more than one way to wave a bloody shirt.Douglass’s presence at the convention was the subject of controversy even beforehe arrived in Philadelphia. Aboard a train somewhere between Harrisburg andLancaster, Pennsylvania, a group of fellow delegates from western and Southernstates approached him, expressed their “very high respect,” and then urged himnot to attend the convention. The scene on that train car was one among manyDouglass remembered as an autobiographer. It told something revealing about bothhis life and the country. He felt like “the Jonah of the Republican ship,” herecalled, “and responsible for the contrary winds and misbehaving weather.”Among the group waiting upon him was the widely esteemed governor of Indiana,Oliver P. Morton. The chief spokesman making the awkward appeal was a NewOrleanian with a “very French name” that Douglass could not recall. The“undesirableness” of a black man’s presence, the group argued, was dictated byNorthern racial prejudice. In the fall elections, these Republicans believedthey must dodge the “cry of social and political equality” sure to be raisedagainst them. In Life and Times, Douglass purported to remember verbatim hisreply to the polite visitors: “Gentlemen, with all respect, you might as wellask me to put a loaded pistol to my head and blow my brains out, as to ask me tokeep out of this convention.” He remembered, gleefully, warning his detractorsthat should they persist in excluding him, they would themselves be“branded . . . as dastardly hypocrites.” Not to have participated, he said,“would contradict the principle and purpose of my life.”42[notes01.html#ch22fn_42a] Douglass had lived as a public symbol in America andabroad, but rarely had his physical presence caused such a stir in the house ofhis friends. Embarrassed, the Republican politicians returned to their railcarsfor the ride into Philadelphia.On September 3, nearly three hundred delegates gathered in Independence Hall fora grand procession, two abreast, through the historic streets of Philadelphia.Having failed to exclude Douglass, most Republicans resolved to ignore him.Awkward and conspicuous, he stood alone as the lines formed; the delegates, herecalled, “seemed to be ashamed or afraid of me.” The tall brown man with therecognizable silver-streaked mane of hair stood out like the black sheep in theflock. To his rescue came Theodore Tilton, a friend and the editor of the NewYork Independent. During the parade, Douglass and Tilton’s arm-in-arm marchgarnered tumultuous cheers from the crowds, as well as scowls from some tenseRepublicans. At Ninth and Chesnutt Streets, Douglass spied a familiar face inthe front line of the crowd. Amanda Sears, daughter of Thomas and Lucretia Auld,Douglass’s second owners, stood waving with her two children. Douglass hadnothing but fond memories of Amanda’s mother. He broke ranks in the march andran to Amanda, asking “what brought her to Philadelphia?” With “animated voice,”said the autobiographer, the former slaveholder’s daughter replied, “I heard youwere to be here, and I came to see you walk in this procession.”43[notes01.html#ch22fn_43a] The simpatico between the two childhood acquaintances,possible siblings, was apparent for all to see.The Republicans’ procession became the subject of ridicule in the DemocraticParty and pro-Johnson press. Moreover, Thaddeus Stevens did not attend theconvention, but was sufficiently irked at what he called the “arm-in-armperformance of Douglass and Tilton” to complain about it privately. He calledthe image a “practical exhibition of social equality” and worried that it would“lose us some votes.”44 [notes01.html#ch22fn_44a] When he got his chance on theplatform in Philadelphia, Douglass took dead aim at any such sentiments thatwould bar him from political life.For three days Southern and Northern delegates met separately and attackedJohnson and the Democrats. Douglass delivered at least three speeches in thepacked Union League hall. Such constant speaking in this pyrotechnic politicalatmosphere rendered him hoarse by the fourth day. Douglass addressed manyfamiliar themes with raucous humor: the all-important role of the ballot insolidifying black freedom; bitter ridicule of Johnson and even scorn for alliessuch as Stevens; Douglass’s defense of the patriotism and assimilation of blacksto American culture contrasted with, again, the alleged retreat and decline ofIndians.45 [notes01.html#ch22fn_45a]Douglass delivered a lengthy comparative, racialized rant about NativeAmericans. Blacks had achieved the “character of a civilized man,” and Indianshad not. The Indian, said Douglass by one invidious distinction after another,is “too stiff to bend” and “looks upon your cities . . . your steamboats, andyour canals and railways and electric wires, and he regards them with aversion.”The Indian “retreats,” said Douglass, while the black man “rejoices” inmodernity. Brutally ignoring so much history, Douglass claimed that against hispeople “there is a prejudice; against the Indian none.” He complained thatIndians faced only “romantic reverence,” while blacks were “despised.” It isastounding that Douglass would use race this way just as American Indians werefighting, and losing, so many western battles over their lands, and especiallyas the federal government, in alliance with Christian and philanthropicreformers, launched the reservation system, as well as the long effort todetribalize Native peoples. The prolonged effort of Bureau of Indian Affairsagents to achieve the forced deculturalization—“to destroy the Indian and savethe man”—of Native Americans on a vast scale was a history very different fromthe one Douglass used to assert the cause of black rights.46[notes01.html#ch22fn_46a] The marketplace for racism was diverse and terrifyingin Reconstruction America. Even its most visible and eloquent homegrown opponentcould fall to its seductions in his fierce quest to be accepted by American“civilization.”The political context prompted from Douglass a folksy style in which he madehimself the central subject. He garnered roars of laughter and applause byannouncing that he had brought along “an individual that has been associatedwith me for . . . the last fifty years—the negro.” To which someone in theaudience shouted, “Bring your friend with you!” He was, he said, the“representative” of the “black race.” He scored points far too easily with thescurrilous racial argument that blacks would never “die out like the Indian.”Douglass could be very funny on his feet. “We ask a right to all the differentboxes,” he shouted, by which he clarified, the “witness-box, the jury-box, andthe ballot box.” Without these rights, said the orator, his people would remainin a “bad box.” Style trumped substance in some of these performances. He evenemployed a new variation on his Irish joke about voting. If “a negro sober knowsas much as a white man drunk,” he surely “knows as much sober as Andy Johnson inany condition you may name.” His hosts even picked up on Douglass’s manner;Theodore Tilton and William Kelley introduced him on September 5 as a “runawayslave” in the house, who had been apprehended and brought before the meeting as“the prisoner at the bar,” tried for his crime of “wonderful genius.” Douglasshad become the living exhibit, as well as the ironic relief, for someRepublicans in Philadelphia. He thought his hosts’ introduction a bit “jocular,”he said, but had himself set the tone.47 [notes01.html#ch22fn_47a]Not everyone enjoyed the joke. Trouble began on the fourth day when Douglass,Tilton, and Anna Dickinson, a young Quaker orator, entered the hall of theSouthern loyalists. Border-state delegates opposed black suffrage and tried toforce adjournment, whereas delegates from the former Confederate states,directly dependent on black votes, held out for a suffrage resolution. Thedecisive moments came when Douglass and Dickinson were called upon to speak.Dickinson, a mere twenty-three years old and already heralded as the Joan of Arcof the abolitionist platform, urged the franchise for blacks as a major step inhuman progress. Answering the familiar cries from the audience of “Douglass!Douglass! Douglass!,” the wordmaster stepped to the platform and caused aruckus. “I responded with all the energy of my soul,” Douglass later wrote, “forI looked upon suffrage for the Negro as the only measure which would prevent himfrom being thrust back into slavery.” Some border-state delegates bolted theconvention; meanwhile, the mass of Southern delegates reconvened the nextmorning, expressed thanks to Douglass and Dickinson, and endorsed black malesuffrage.48 [notes01.html#ch22fn_48a]The Fifteenth Amendment was still three years away, but its momentum swung intomotion at Philadelphia in 1866. Douglass reveled in the irony, as he put it, ofhow “the ugly and deformed child of the family” had won a “victory” over fearand expediency. He loved how his presence at this center of American politicsstill seemed to terrify white editors. A New Orleans reporter worried in thewake of Philadelphia that “as soon as Republicans could get President Johnsonout of the way,” they would “secure a Fred. Douglass or Sumner” in thepresidency. And a Pennsylvania editor announced that soon “Fred. Douglass wouldbe president,” with “negro governments in every southern state, negro Senatorsand Representatives in Congress, and no bar raised against the perfect equalityin society and in politics.”49 [notes01.html#ch22fn_49a] The former slave wasdelighted to infest the dreams of anxious whites worried about equality.• • •The leaders of the women’s suffrage movement also had anxious dreams in the late1860s. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony increasingly demanded thatthe crusade for black male suffrage would now sweep women into the franchise aswell. Douglass remained their old ally, dating back to Seneca Falls, throughout1866. He wrote to Stanton in February thanking her for “the launching of thegood ship ‘Equal Rights Association,’ ” a new organization, of which Douglassbecame a vice president, devoted to achievement of universal suffrage. The twopledged mutual support of each other’s cause in voting rights. He tried tosoften Stanton’s potentially volatile sensitivities by telling her there hadbeen “no vessel like her . . . since Noah’s Ark” and without the women the arkwould have sunk.50 [notes01.html#ch22fn_50a]But signs of the schism to come emerged everywhere in the wake of the FourteenthAmendment’s inclusion of the word “male.” In November 1866, Douglass spoke atthe convention of the Equal Rights Association in Albany, a meeting called toadvocate for equal suffrage provisions for blacks and women in the impendingrevision of the New York State constitution. For the audience, which includedStanton, Anthony, Lucy Stone, and a variety of old Garrisonians who supportedwomen’s suffrage, Douglass left mixed messages. “By every fact to which man canappeal as a justification of his own right to a ballot,” he declared, “a womancan appeal with equal force.” But then he drew historical distinctions. Womenshould realize the dire “urgency” faced by blacks, he argued, and wait. “Withthem it is a desirable matter; with us it is important; a question of life anddeath. With us disfranchisement means New Orleans, it means Memphis.” If womanachieved the vote, Douglass maintained, she could only do so by “lifting thenegro with her.”51 [notes01.html#ch22fn_51a]As their suspicions grew, Stanton and Anthony wanted to know just where Douglassstood. Anthony wrote to Douglass in December 1866, desiring to know if he wouldjoin her in the presentation to the state legislature in January. She urged himto “sacredly devote the last of the old and the first of the new year to thework.” Similarly, Stanton wrote in January with the same query about whetherthey would make their case to the state government “together.” Douglass did notshow up at the January 23, 1867, hearing in Albany where the state Senate voteddown the women’s suffrage resolutions.52 [notes01.html#ch22fn_52a] Soon, an uglyand prolonged breach developed over whether women’s suffrage and black malesuffrage coexisted on the same agenda.Image [../images/f0489-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, February–March 1867. Samuel Root photographer, carte devisite.With decreasing numbers of allies, Stanton and Anthony were no longer willing toplay second fiddle in the race for suffrage. In their arguments they aimed bothhigh and low. Their case for women’s suffrage stemmed from deep grievances, andfrom a sophisticated argument about the vote as “protector” of economic,educational, and even personal security in a world that otherwise prescribed awomen’s sphere. Above all they demanded equality, not merely in the abstract,but in reality. Their demands became increasingly absolutist, uncompromising.Douglass too had often viewed the vote as protector of the safety andaspirations of blacks. But Stanton, in particular, resorted to indefensiblyracist rhetoric in advancing the case for women over uneducated men of any race.In 1868, she took a stand against a “man’s government,” citing a history of“war, violence, conquest, acquisition . . . slavery, slaughter, and sacrifice”under male leadership. She believed a “man’s government” is worse than a “whiteman’s government” by the strange reasoning that it would only “multiply thetyrants.”53 [notes01.html#ch22fn_53a]Then Stanton aimed at racial comparisons and forced Douglass and others toreact. By denying American women the vote, politicians, Stanton contended,degraded their own “mothers, wives and daughters . . . below unwashed andunlettered ditch-diggers, boot-blacks, hostlers, butchers and barbers.” But shedid not stop there with her invidious class and racial-ethnic slurs. She askedher readers to imagine “Patrick and Sambo and Hans and Yung Tung who do not knowthe difference between a monarchy and a republic, who never read the Declarationof Independence . . . making laws” for refined, educated Anglo-Saxon womenreformers. Douglass too had used his “drunken Patrick” jokes to argue for blacksuffrage. But Stanton and Anthony had crossed some lines. Many in the women’srights movement were also disgusted when Stanton and Anthony denounced theRepublicans and allied with white-supremacist Democrats in 1868. They did so bywelcoming the support of wealthy racist merchant George Francis Train, whofunded the new journal Revolution, Stanton’s ideological mouthpiece.54[notes01.html#ch22fn_54a]Throughout this ugly debate over suffrage, Douglass maintained a remarkablegrace and even friendship with Stanton, although not so with Anthony. A gooddeal of romance has evolved in popular memory about Douglass and Anthony, sincethey both resided in Rochester for so long, and in modern times a touchingmonument was erected of the two, depicting them having tea together. At the May1869 meeting of the Equal Rights Association in New York, Anthony blew up andforced Douglass into an impromptu debate. Ninety percent of the large andraucous audience were women. Women had to stop stepping aside for the blackvote, Anthony insisted. “Men cannot understand us women,” she shouted. “Theythink of us as some of the slaveholders used to think of their slaves, all loveand compassion, with no malice in their hearts.” But watch out, she warned.Women were fed up with being “dependent” and demanded to earn their own “bread.”She chastised Douglass for arguing that black men needed the vote because theirsituation was more “perilous” than that of women.55 [notes01.html#ch22fn_55a]Anthony slashed away, challenging whether Douglass would ever “exchange his sex& color . . . with Elizabeth Cady Stanton.” Douglass tried to answer, butAnthony drowned him out with the assertion that votes for men but not womenwould send “fugitive wives” on the “loose” just as “fugitive slaves” traversedthe landscape before the war. Declaring “we are in for a fight today,” Anthonydeclared for “the most intelligent first” in voting and, therefore, “let . . .woman be first . . . and the negro last.” The Fifteenth Amendment had severedthe women’s rights movement for the foreseeable future, with Stanton and Anthonyfighting in isolation for their absolute principle. Douglass gave as he took. Heobjected to Stanton’s use of such words as “Sambo,” although he tried to do sowith humor. He fiercely resisted the equivalence of women’s plight with that ofthe freedpeople. “When women, because they are women, are hunted down in thecities of New York and New Orleans; when they are dragged from their houses andare hung from lamp-posts; when their children are torn from their arms, andtheir brains bashed out upon the pavement . . . when they are in danger ofhaving their homes burnt down over their heads . . . then they will have anurgency to obtain the ballot equal to our own.”56 [notes01.html#ch22fn_56a]Things only got worse as the Fifteenth Amendment passed Congress in February1869 and became the template of disagreement. Stanton predicted that equippingblack men in the South with the franchise would “culminate in fearful outrageson womanhood.” The imagined demon of the black rapist crawled into the suffragedebate, courtesy of the leader of the women’s rights crusade. As her biographercontends, Stanton was an “absolutist” more than a “strategist.” Unrepentantly,she preferred die-hard principle to political maneuver. She even came outagainst black men’s votes if women were denied, which is what the FifteenthAmendment did. She proclaimed black women better off in slavery than in freedom:“Their emancipation is but another form of slavery. It is better to be the slaveof an educated white man, than a degraded, ignorant black one.” In her openingaddress at the May 1869 convention, she envisioned the nation heading toward“national suicide and woman’s destruction” under “manhood” suffrage. TheFifteenth Amendment would create government where “clowns make laws for queens.”Stanton’s racial and social hierarchies allowed no concern for the complex logicof Reconstruction politics. Her racial and class code language cut to the bonesof those who had spent their lives fighting for black freedom. The utterinsecurity of black communities in the South simply did not interest her; shedemanded the individual woman’s right to vote regardless of social context orviolence.57 [notes01.html#ch22fn_57a]Image [../images/f0492-01.jpg]Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, c. 1870. Albumen print. NapoleonSarony photographer.Trying to sustain civility, Douglass, who attended most of the women’s rightsmeetings, pushed back. Countless times Douglass gave his full support to women’sequal right to suffrage. By modern standards, he could seem rather patriarchalin his language, contending that white women had always been advantaged becausetheir “husbands, fathers, and brothers are voters” and could protect women’sinterests. His humor at women’s rights gatherings may sometimes have fallenflat, as in Rhode Island in 1868, when he remarked, “I cannot say much aboutwoman’s wrongs. The men love them too much to wrong them.” He claimed as wellthat in every debate with a woman, he had “got the worst of it.” He thoughtwomen had an “inside track” to the vote over black men because “you [whitewomen] are beautiful and we are not.”58 [notes01.html#ch22fn_58a] Douglassabhorred, however, Stanton’s and Anthony’s embrace of Train and the Democrats.He was disgusted by their racist rhetoric. Most important, he had learned anabiding pragmatism from two decades of radical activism, war, and revolution inproslavery America. He wished the Fifteenth Amendment had gone further inoutlawing qualification tests and in extending the vote to women. But this washardly the first time Douglass accepted half measures from his fellowRepublicans while working for a longer revolution. He knew that political rightsderived from politics and had learned it the hard way.In March 1869, Douglass had a chance encounter on a train in Ohio with Stantonand Anthony. It was still two months before the bitter breakup. They managed afriendly ride as well as an “earnest debate.” Anthony extended her hand,although it would be one of the last times for many years to the man Stantondescribed in “a great circular cape of wolf skins.” Stanton’s remembrance wasrespectful but foreboding. She observed that Douglass had “a most formidable andferocious aspect.” In correspondence, Stanton wrote with sharp wit. “I trembledin my shoes and was almost as paralyzed as Red Riding Hood in a similarencounter.” Douglass left her feeling “reassured” by a “gracious smile” and“hearty words.”59 [notes01.html#ch22fn_59a]The black orator seeking new vocations never truly reconciled with Anthony, whoremained embittered. But he did maintain friendly professional relations withStanton in the coming two decades. Douglass attended many women’s rightsconventions in the years to come, and in 1870–71 he wholly endorsed the effortfor a Sixteenth Amendment for women’s suffrage as a robust “natural” right togovern themselves in every way a man could. At the same time he counseled womento have “the patience of truth while they advocate the truth.”60[notes01.html#ch22fn_60a] The Big Bad Wolf remained obsessed with politicalrights, chalked up at best a partial victory, and moved on to new crises,national and personal.• • •Douglass’s personal life was now fraught with many conflicting pressures.Throughout the Reconstruction years, the patriarch found himself over and againadjudicating rivalries and feuds among his children and their spouses. Everyonein his extended family struggled with money and livelihood, and Anna, still thecenter of the home everyone returned to in one way or another, suffered fromrecurring illnesses. The itinerant lecturer, needing to make a living on whichall around him depended, sustained what his son Charles called the “hard andkilling tours.” A long-lost sibling from slavery days on the Eastern Shore wasabout to arrive wondrously in the Douglasses’ lap in Rochester with his ownfamily of former slaves in tow. Julia Crofts and the old editor sustained theirtransatlantic correspondence, full of nostalgia for past dreams and labors,assurances of their mutual deep “trust,” and Julia’s worries over Frederick’soccasional “despondency.” Clearly, Douglass could still confide in his oldcomrade, whatever the distance or subject. And Ottilie Assing, the adoring,opinionated, voluable, hidebound salon host in Hoboken, remained a presence inhis life. She sustained strong views about how her occasional companionconducted his career, his family, his finances, and his political and religiousideas. Repeatedly, she also informed her sister in Italy of her desire to returnto or visit Europe, but could not imagine “how I’m supposed to manage to untiemyself from Douglass.”61 [notes01.html#ch22fn_61a] If anything, Othello had toomany occupations."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 23--------------------------------------------------------------------------------ALL THE LEECHES THAT FEED ON YOUThough I am not rich, I am not absolutely poor. . . . I am working now less formyself than for those around me.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, MAY 6, 1868In midsummer 1867, Douglass experienced another reunion with a slave sibling.His brother Perry Downs (formerly Perry Bailey), born in 1813, the oldest son ofHarriet Bailey, arrived in Rochester with his wife, Maria, and four children, toreconnect with his famous kinsman. During the forty years of separation,Frederick had only heard that Perry had been sold south to Louisiana. In aletter sent to Douglass the previous February, written by an intermediary, Perryreached his brother with the amazing story that Perry’s wife had been sold toeast Texas, and that he had gone to find her. Perry had labored as a field handin cotton and sugar; in the wake of emancipation, he and his family, somehowsurviving as a unit, made it to New Orleans, where a Reverend T. W. Conwaysupplied them a note of introduction to J. J. Spelman of New York City. ThroughSpelman’s aid, Perry’s family found their way to the hill in Rochester and theDouglass household.1 [notes02.html#ch23fn_1a] An emotional, if strained, reuniontook place there for the next two years.Perry’s family was illiterate, their habits and values bred in decades ofslavery in some of its worst precincts. Nonetheless, Douglass was initiallydeeply moved by his brother’s arrival, although the house now overflowed withneedy guests. In September, Douglass wrote to Theodore Tilton, saying that he(and thereby Anna) had “been keeping a kind of hotel all summer!” His “poorbrother Perry, after a bondage of fifty-six years, deeply marked by thehardships and sorrows of that hateful condition; and after a separation from meduring forty years,” suddenly appeared “as if he had lived on another planet.”Douglass spent much of the summer working with Perry to build for his family “asnug little cottage” on the property. Douglass wanted his “long-lost brother” tospend the remainder of his days “in peace.” Douglass wished Perry’s old masterscould see their former slave now, “strong and hopeful . . . taking care ofhimself.” The younger brother and author pondered the possibility of writingPerry’s story in a narrative, or perhaps even a novella. But “if slavery werenot dead,” said Douglass, “and I did not in some sort wish to forget itsterrible hardships . . . and horrors, I would try to write the narrative of mybrother’s bondage.” Douglass’s life was likely too hectic and his travels toofrenetic to write that book. Such a past was not easy for him to retrieve and headmitted so in a widely reprinted statement: “Let the old system go! I would notcall its guilty ghost from the depths into which its crimes have cast it. I turngladly from the darkness of the past to the new better dispensation nowdawning.” Douglass was never good at forgetting the past; but looking closely atwhat slavery had done to the bodies and minds of Perry and his family madeDouglass yearn for release from its clutches. Shortly after Perry’s arrival inRochester, Douglass took him on the road to an August First celebration inWatkins, New York, at the base of Seneca Lake. No record survives of Douglass’sspeech that day; but he no doubt introduced his brother and told his story.2[notes02.html#ch23fn_2a] Perhaps Douglass could speak what he did not choose towrite.Tilton published Douglass’s letter and called the episode a “beautiful andromantic chapter” in a great man’s life, and “proof that truth is stranger thanfiction.” The problem, though, was that Douglass’s kinfolk were truly strangers,especially to his own grown children, who had been born in the free North. Withtime the reunion in Rochester became anything but romantic. From his new post inWashington, Charles wrote to his father in confusion and resentment, grumbling,“I don’t understand in what way those people you have at home are related toyou; is it that Mr. Downs is your half brother? From what I have heard of theirconduct, I should be afraid even to have them in the same neighborhood, and moreespecially when you are away in the winter months.” What Charles “heard” likelycame via his sister Rosetta, who lived with her family nearby in Rochester. Whenthe cold months arrived, a frustrated Rosetta wrote to her traveling fatherabout the struggles of Perry’s family in surviving their first Rochester winter,and that they might soon be moving back south.3 [notes02.html#ch23fn_3a]So widespread was the story of Douglass’s taking in his brother’s brood thatwhen British friends sent money, he promised to use it to support the newadditions to his burgeoning household. The homestead on South Avenue also hadanother adopted stray. In Washington, at the end of the war, among the thousandsof freedmen who trekked into the city as refugees was a thirteen-year-old formerslave from Georgia, Henry Strothers, who had the good fortune of meeting andbefriending Charles Douglass. Obtaining his father’s approval, Charles sentStrothers to Rochester, where he would be employed as a gardener among othertasks and, most important, treated as a fictive son. An English friend wrote inJanuary 1868 of how Julia Crofts had kept a network in Britain informed aboutDouglass’s extended family. “Your life,” wrote Mary Carpenter, “has been full ofstrange adversities, sad partings, wonderful meetings, bitter work, andthrilling joys such as we scarcely know anything of except in books of fiction.”It all did seem rather romantic from outside the circle of reality. Douglasswrote to another English friend in May 1868 about his financial situation withat least partial honesty: “So far as my own circumstances are concerned, I amsuccessful—far more so than I ever ventured to hope—and though I am not rich, Iam not absolutely poor.” Then came a genteel understatement: “I may say that Iam working now less for myself than for those around me.”4[notes02.html#ch23fn_4a]• • •Indeed Douglass labored, especially through his lecture tours, to financiallysustain a growing clan of struggling, discontented, feuding siblings and theirfamilies. A bitter and enduring dispute grew in 1867 and lasted for many yearsamong Charles, Rosetta, and her husband, Nathan Sprague, with Ottilie Assingpiping in with toxic opinions. To say the least, Douglass himself was caught inthe middle of some ugly cross fire. In these years, Lewis attempted without muchsuccess to run a school in Maryland. With his brother Frederick Jr., he movedout to Denver, Colorado, in 1866 and 1867 and tried his hand in a variety ofbusinesses, including a laundry, and a “lunch room.” The two brothers also spenta stint working for a mining company. Douglass’s old friend H. O. Wagoner, wholived in Denver, assisted the brothers in getting started. He wrote to thefather a revealing observation: “Lewis I take to be a young man of strong, cleargood sense. He seems to drive right ahead at the object aimed at. Frederick,however, seems to be more cautious, reflecting, hesitative, and as you say,‘practical.’ ”5 [notes02.html#ch23fn_5a] The financial and professionalstruggles of his sons were a constant worry for the elder Douglass, who for muchof the rest of his life frequently extended them loans.Image [../images/f0498-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass Jr., c. 1862.Back in Rochester in the winter of 1867, Charles tried to manage the patriarch’sendless correspondence and speaking commitments. In February, Charles wrote tohis father, who was on tour in Michigan, at length of the cost “to gravel theroad in front of the house.” Charles was desperate for a secure job that wouldallow him to provide for his pregnant wife (he had married the eighteen-year-oldMary Elizabeth “Libbie” Murphy, September 21, 1866). Meanwhile Rosetta, herhusband, and their two babies had tried to make a go of it by buying a farm nearRochester. The venture failed quickly, and they sold the farm in spring 1867 andmoved back into the city. Nathan wrote to his father-in-law of his desperatefinancial straits. Rosetta too wrote of the travail of moving and complainedabout anxiety over their dangerous Irish neighbors. Douglass gave Rosetta andNathan a loan of what had to be several hundreds of dollars, with which theson-in-law bought a hack and a “handsome span of greys.” For $640—$200 down anda payment plan of eighteen months—Nathan and his hack, Rosetta proudly ifawkwardly announced, were “on the stand every day.” But white hackmen insultedand threatened Nathan as a competitor; the business, like everything else thehapless Nathan attempted, did not pan out. By April 24, Rosetta reported an“outrage on Nathan’s hack.”6 [notes02.html#ch23fn_6a] Nathan could not overcomeYankee racism or his own demons.A young mother with a husband who could not effectively provide, Rosettashouldered many burdens. She seemed to resent managing her father’s letters. Butin a mixed tone of embarrassment and gratitude she wrote Douglass obligatorynotes: “Father, I cannot thank you too much for your kindness to Nathan andmyself, and I can assure you Nathan is grateful and proud of your good opinionof him.” Such opinions would not last for long. Worse yet, Rosetta monitored the“spirits” and physical health of her mother. “Ran up to the house” and motherwas “not well” was a common report to the traveling orator, from whom she hadjust received letters from his stops in West Virginia and Pennsylvania.Receiving letters at hotels or post offices, Douglass learned in late April thatAnna was “sick” with neurological attacks and had “collapsed at the sink” with“vomiting spells,” after which “she seemed stupid.” Rosetta summoned a doctorand the malady was pronounced a “bilious attack.”7 [notes02.html#ch23fn_7a] Outon the hustings where Douglass addressed audiences in town after town about thememory of the war, the character of republicanism, the right to vote, and thevirtues of self-made men came a steady stream of difficult domestic news anddemands for financial assistance. Often exhausted, the “self-made man” soldieredon.That spring in 1867, Charles left his wife, Libbie, living with Anna inRochester and moved to Washington to take a job as a clerk at the Freedmen’sBureau, a position his father’s connections made possible. Charles worked as apersonal assistant to Oliver O. Howard, the director, writing hiscorrespondence. The son was especially proud to tell his father that Charles wasonly the “second colored man” to be given a “first class clerkship.” Charlesseemed happy about his employment—his white coworkers were “perfect gentlemen.”He was, as always though, worried about money; the boardinghouse rent was high,and he boldly asked his father for an $1,800 loan to buy a house. The elderDouglass rejected the request, beginning an exchange lasting for years over thefinancial dependency of his youngest son. Then came the news that Libbie haddelivered her baby on June 21, a boy named Charles Frederick, who would alwaysbe known as Freddie. Writing as the stressed and absent father of his firstborn,Charles said he had “no fears” because Libbie and the baby were “in good hands.”His mother had a great deal of experience by now with these joyous new additionsto the Douglass family. Oddly, though, Charles said he was “very well satisfiedwith the name you have given the boy.” Apparently, as father, he had notparticipated in the choice; the women had taken care of that task. And though headdressed his letter to his father, on June 21 Douglass the elder was inIndianapolis, Indiana, speaking at Morrison’s Opera Hall.8[notes02.html#ch23fn_8a]That same summer of 1867, and for a decade to follow, the feud betweenDouglass’s sons and his son-in-law, Nathan Sprague, festered and exploded. Thequarrel began over money and loans between Frederick Jr., Charles, and Nathan,but eventually it descended into accusations of betrayal, lying, theft, andcompeting claims on the elder Douglass’s property. Rosetta inevitably was caughtbetween her brothers and her eventually estranged husband. Where Anna stood inall of this family warfare is hard to discern, but she likely defended herdaughter, who remained her steady companion and nearby protector. Douglasshimself tried to negotiate these treacherous waters and gave out some loans thathe regretted as he traveled thousands of miles to make the livelihood necessaryfor these familial demands. In some letters to English friends, safely beyondthe fray, he often told of recuperating from “hard travelling & speaking; tenthousand miles and a hundred speeches” in a three-month stretch.9[notes02.html#ch23fn_9a]Like his three brothers-in-law, Sprague could not make a gainful living inRochester. Repeatedly, he seemed to wear out his welcome at the Douglasshousehold. Charles complained to his father of Nathan’s alleged skulduggery. “Idon’t wish to trouble your mind about this affair between Nathan, Fred, andmyself,” Charles wrote in November 1867. “I know your mind and time are betteroccupied.” But nothing stopped the flow of invective toward Nathan and Rosetta.“You may know the cause of the difficulty, but I know you don’t know the wholetruth, and it is hard to find it out under the circumstances.” The mutualloathing between the brothers and Rosetta’s husband and their feud were clearlyover money and the elder Douglass’s loyalty and largess. Nathan too went west insearch of a livelihood in 1868, leaving his wife and two children, ages five andtwo, behind. From Omaha, Nebraska, he wrote directly to Douglass of hisdesperation for money and employment. Although racism lurked in his path atvarious junctures, one scheme after another of his failed. “I think I can makemoney here,” wrote Nathan to his exasperated father-in-law, claiming he mightopen a “boarding house” for blacks.10 [notes02.html#ch23fn_10a] But soon he wasback in Rochester, a ward of the old man’s bank accounts and an embarrassment tohis wife.From upper New England to the far Midwest, the road was undoubtedly a refuge forDouglass from all this family turmoil. But he could not escape it. Rosetta wroteto her father in Akron, Ohio, in early 1868 reporting that Nathan had left homefor his western venture. This was the first of more than one marital separationfor the Spragues. But Rosetta kept a stiff upper lip and pleaded her husband’scase. She remained formally “appreciative” of all her father’s “kindness” toNathan and herself. But she confessed to being “sorry you have been obliged toform any unfavorable opinion and hope you will not lose any of the confidenceyou have been pleased to keep in him [Nathan] for I believe & know it isNathan’s desire to act honorably.”11 [notes02.html#ch23fn_11a] Those would turnout to be painfully unprophetic words.Sprague returned to Rochester within a year, but the situation only got worse.In February 1869, Rosetta told her father that his letters “filled” her with“sadness.” He had apparently drawn the line and declared that Nathan could nolonger live “on the hill” (the Douglass house). Exasperation seemed to rule onboth ends. Douglass was free “to choose,” said Rosetta, “who you shall havearound you and I could stand all the grumbling and fault finding that mightarise by our remaining here.” But she defended her husband’s manly pride againstDouglass’s allegation that the unemployed son-in-law could not “exist” withoutthe father’s help. “He took exception,” complained Rosetta, “to what yousaid . . . that it was ‘all mouths and no hands,’ that you included him with therest—as being a burden.” Douglass’s cup of frustrations runneth over. The couplewould move somewhere that Nathan could get employment as a “gardener,” shepainfully wrote, if her husband could overcome his “despondency.” Pathetically,she said they did not wish to be any further “indebted” because of “the manydemands for money from you by all of the family.”12 [notes02.html#ch23fn_12a]A month later, Rosetta wrote what had to be one of the most depressing lettersDouglass ever received from his dysfunctional family. When he thought back towhat his grandmother Betsy and his mother, Harriet Bailey (for whom Rosetta’ssecond child was named), had endured and survived, he surely felt a parent’sdespair. He could also vividly remember his own desperate experience of theearly 1850s when he was dependent on the largess of Gerrit Smith and thefund-raising of Julia Griffiths. Nathan still needed Douglass’s “approbation,”Rosetta said. He needed to “float free” and escape “all kinds of unkind remarks”from the brothers. But the daughter desperately needed her father’scompassionate heart. She felt cut off by her brothers, and she and Nathan couldno longer tolerate their “taunts.” She tried to tell her father how much sheloved and needed him while at the same time she had to support her spouse. “Yousay to me husbands first and fathers second,” Rosetta wrote. “I know it but Icannot help it—my affection for you is of the warmest kind and your wordswhether of censure or praise remain with me always and affect me accordingly.”13[notes02.html#ch23fn_13a] She was a twenty-nine-year-old woman in the middle ofthe nineteenth century, pregnant with her third child, married to a man whocould not make a living, begging her father, a world-famous, heroic achiever whohad conquered slavery, to stop, listen, and love her unconditionally. Rosettawas an intelligent, highly literate woman trapped in a cluster of genderedvalues she could never escape. And she had to feed her children; she neededmaterial support. Between 1864 and 1877 Rosetta gave birth to seven childrenwith Sprague (six of them daughters), in a marriage that did manage to survive.Douglass deeply loved his daughter and had earlier cultivated her intellectualsensibilities, but now he did not hide his disappointments at her life choices.Rosetta became very personal in a way both tender and sadly self-pitying. Apicture emerges from her perception of a father so consumed by his work and hiscause that he could never see her dilemmas, nor hear her cry. “You say you are alonely man,” she said to Douglass with uncustomary directness, “no one knows itbetter than myself. . . . I felt it for years for I have been in a measurelonely myself but would not allow myself to analyze my feelings as I was thedaughter and had duties to fulfill in that relation.” These are remarkableexpressions in the era before psychology. Here was an adult woman saying, I didmy duty as the daughter in our difficult home, as the oldest child and thego-between in the marriage made so troublesome by illiteracy and the frequentlyabsent father and husband. “I knew where my sympathies were,” she informedDouglass. “I do not know whether you thought much about it—having so many thingsto occupy your mind, but my position at home was anything but pleasant.” Rosettaseemed to have stored up many feelings, and a good deal of anger, that shefinally let fly at her father. “You used often to say that we were all glad whenyou left,” she continued, “something that was so far from what was true as faras I was concerned. I never dared to show much zeal about anything where youwere concerned, as I could never bear ridicule and as jealousy is one of theleading traits in our family I could very readily bring a storm about my ears ifI endorsed any of your sentiments about matters pertaining to the household.”14[notes02.html#ch23fn_14a]Such a statement about Rosetta’s youth at home reveals many realities: AnnaDouglass’s fierce grip on domestic affairs; Douglass’s contradictory roles asboth patriarch-guest and absent father; the daughter’s long emotional need tofeel engaged with her father’s public world; and a young woman’s resentment aswell as fascination for the two brilliant European women who had left such amark on that household. Perhaps Rosetta’s lament implied that she had becomemore of her mother than her father and often wished it otherwise. She ended theletter with an agonizing admission: “I do not wish to pain you but I must say Ihave no pleasant remembrances of my brothers. I had my faults no doubt, but noneso great that their feelings of dislike should follow me to this day.”15[notes02.html#ch23fn_15a] As Douglass traveled the railroads of America speakingto thousands about the great issues of Reconstruction and plotted his careermove to Washington, he awoke many days to the news that the “home” in Rochesterfestered with family conflict he simply could not resolve. And he was surelyaware of his daughter’s desperation for his love.• • •While worshipping their father, the sons carried their own burdens of beingDouglass’s offspring. Each eagerly sought a father’s love and approval. None ofthe Douglass sons achieved any further education after the war, nor did theirfather push them. Lewis, with some assistance from his brothers, began keepingscrapbooks about the elder Douglass, as well as about themselves. Thesescrapbooks eventually grew to at least nine thick volumes collected over morethan three decades. Their contents demonstrate that the brothers all sharedgreat affection and solidarity among themselves. They even named their childrenfor each other. As collectors of the details of their father’s public life, theyamassed newspaper clippings by the thousands; eventually, in the 1880s, thefamily hired a clipping service, the American Bureau, which collected materialfrom nearly everywhere the elder Douglass traveled. The scrapbooks were intendedto be a record of fame and achievement, but sometimes they revealed more thanthe brothers may have intended.16 [notes02.html#ch23fn_16a]Lewis began collecting when he was in Denver in 1866–67. He was an aspiringjournalist and printer, as well as an activist, like his father. Everywhere he(his brothers as well) went, comparisons to the famous father emerged, sometimeswith blunt openness. Lewis helped organize a Denver meeting of blacks in 1867celebrating the advent of the “right of suffrage.” He was recognized as aleader, but primarily as “son of the Old Champion.” He made a “good chairman,”said a reporter. “His face bears clear marks of resemblance to that of hisfather. . . . We think he will never take the proportions of the old warrior,but a survey of his face tells you, that the son, like the sire, will grappleterribly with conflict. You feel he is a ‘Foeman worthy of his steal.’ ” Thearticle then veered off into a litany of all the “struggles andself-denials . . . tears and heart pangs,” and the words hurled like “avengingthunderbolts” from Douglass himself, that could somehow be seen in Lewis’s“face.” Lewis wore his alleged attributes as a proud burden, at least most ofthe time. In 1869 he finally convinced his longtime sweetheart, Amelia Loguen ofSyracuse, to marry him. Their union was a long time coming, but tender. InDecember 1870, while living in Washington, Lewis jotted down a quick note to hisbeloved that he had to help Fred Jr. with an errand, then was “going over toCharley’s,” and hence, it was “the first meal I have missed with you since wewere married.”17 [notes02.html#ch23fn_17a] The Douglass brothers were familymen.Lewis was a proud army veteran and aspired in every way for his father’s kind ofdignity and self-assertion. But jobs and respect were not easily achieved for ayoung black man in post–Civil War America. While staying in Philadelphia inFebruary 1868, Lewis joined a small group of a “half dozen ladies and onegentlemen” on an ice-skating excursion to Camden, New Jersey. He soon foundhimself “surrounded by a number of white boys” who objected to the “goodclothes” worn by the young women and shouted racial insults. Lewis removed hisskates and took on the white thugs with the blades, “splitting [one’s] head withthe skates” and severing another’s “thumb nearly off.” He told the story to hisfiancée, Amelia, with considerable bravado and assured her that he had “thepraise of great coolness” from his companions, especially the ladies. But comingat a peak in mob violence across the South by the Ku Klux Klan and other groups,this incident showed that a Douglass always had to be on guard. Lewis, like hisfather, was a brawler if he had to be.18 [notes02.html#ch23fn_18a]While in Colorado in 1867 Lewis published letters in the press asserting his,and by extension all blacks’, loyalty and patriotism born of the war experience.There, and by 1869–70, after they moved to Washington, Lewis and Frederick Jr.got into an ugly conflict over membership in a printers’ union. Since they couldfind no one in the all-white printers’ union to sponsor them, they took workwhere they could get it. The federal government had greatly expanded since thewar, and it made good sense to try to find employment in its bureaucracy.Frederick Jr. wrote to a Simon Wolf of the Register of Deeds asking to be hired.He described himself as part of “that despised class” that had never beforesought government positions. He had served his “country during the War under thecolors of Massachusetts,” and he noted that he was the “son of a man (FrederickDouglass) who was once held in a bondage protected by the laws of thenation . . . the perpetuity of which” he and many of his race had “struggled tomaintain.” Wolf responded with encouragement, since he too was from “a raceequally maligned” (Jews).19 [notes02.html#ch23fn_19a] Fred Jr. did not receivethe job.In the summer of 1869, Lewis faced public accusation as a “rat” and working for“unfair prices.” He was denied membership in the Washington branch of theColumbia Typographical Union on account of his race. He protested, the disputebecame a cause célèbre, and the elder Douglass forcefully defended his son inthe national press as the representative of “our whole people rising up fromdegradation to respectability.” For the elder Douglass, the issue was “clearlypersonal.” He publicly denounced the “shams” and “excuses” used to deny Lewismembership—that his “card” had been improperly issued and that he had willfullyworked for lower wages. Douglass employed old abolitionist metaphors to skewerthe scoundrels: “They virtually say for the criminal that having cut off theears of his victim, he has also the right to pluck out his eyes.” Lewis wascondemned for not joining a union whose racism prohibited his membership.Whether overt or covert, racism hurt to the soul, and Douglass let his friendsand enemies know it. He brought the story home to Rochester. His “goodly city”had always welcomed him personally; few other Northern cities were as “liberaland friendly to the colored race.” But then he revealed a painful family tale tomake the public argument. When Lewis returned from the war, wounded at thefamous fight on “the walls of Fort Wagner,” and “somewhat broken in health,” theveteran was denied “work at his trade” week after week. Watching his son’sdemoralization made the elder Douglass feel the “iron of Negro hate” in his ownsoul. He especially felt wronged because for sixteen years on his own newspaperhe had hired white apprentices to the tune, by his count, of $100,000.20[notes02.html#ch23fn_20a] That Douglass put a dollar figure on this particularkind of racism reflected the larger economic pain among his sons. He was tellingwhites that perhaps he was owed some interest on his investment in them.The problem of employment and financial rivalry continued unabated as wellbetween Charles and Nathan and Rosetta. So eager was Charles to own a home inWashington that he audaciously asked his father to “invest” and help him “buy alot.” Douglass sternly rebuked these overtures and urged his youngest to savehis money, which only stimulated an aggrieved defensiveness on the part of theson. Charles outdistanced his sister for self-pity. “I had rather not have youlay out one cent in my behalf,” Charles unconvincingly wrote to his father in1868, “if you think that I am trifling with you and my money.” He was doing his“best” and only hoped to benefit like the “other clerks . . . who have parentsor friends to aid them.” By fall 1868, Douglass had given Charles a new loan ofat least $800, but the young man asked for $300 more to finish the roof on ahouse in a new black section of the District called Uniontown. Frederick Jr. toohad moved to the area and opened a store. Charles craved being “whollyindependent.” His letters ached with such declarations as “I will prove to youthat my word will be kept, all I desire is to get into my house.”21[notes02.html#ch23fn_21a]Charles’s money woes were more and more encased in nasty diatribes at Nathan.Douglass must have sighed and rolled his eyes in frustration as Charles carpedabout how he would never pay the money he owed to Nathan until Rosetta’s husbandpaid up what he owed to Frederick Jr. The Douglass family exploded in siblingrivalry, poisoned by matters of money, status, and personality. In September1868, Charles accused his father of “bolstering up” Nathan more than thebrothers, moaning that the hated brother-in-law “used to bring up his beingbetter off than any of us boys, and acted as though he could get along and wecould not.” The racism of the outer world was bad enough; the elder Douglassagonized over the obnoxious drafts of human nature flowing from his kin, asituation suffused with both tragedy and farce. “I used to take it then,”Charles whined, “but when I think over how he used to talk to me about Lew andFred it makes me angry.”22 [notes02.html#ch23fn_22a]In 1869–70, exchanges between Douglass and Charles became private family warfareover integrity and inheritance. They even teemed with threats and conspiracytheories about the house on “the hill” in Rochester. Charles judged Nathanlittle more than an incompetent farmer who had let the Douglass family cow die.Worse, Charles thought Nathan an unfaithful husband and a thief with designs onDouglass’s estate. “I have no friendship for Sprague,” Charles declared inFebruary 1869. Sprague’s “misrepresentations” had forced “me and the other boys”to be “sent away.” This may have struck Douglass as absurd. But the despairingCharles, who lost his job at the Freedmen’s Bureau in March and occasionallyreceived a $100 draft from his father to keep him afloat, complained bitterly ofbeing, in his view, closed out of the family: “Sprague has the advantage ofmother, and if mother wants a letter written she has to go to Rosetta, and thereit goes, and you only get one side of what transpires.” This was no news toDouglass about the ways communications to and from Anna were accomplished. Butit was depressing to read these missives from his dependent adult son. Moreover,in Washington, the employment of the Douglass brothers became increasingly amatter of public debate. Charles eventually landed a job as a clerk in theTreasury Department. “Such pets are the Douglass family,” said one complaint inthe press, “that they seem to think themselves entitled to the lion’s share ofchoice offices.” Therefore, “the honor and respect of the white people arebruised and outraged hereby.”23 [notes02.html#ch23fn_23a]Image [../images/f0506-01.jpg]Nathan Sprague, Douglass’s son-in-law, Union army veteran, 1860s.Charles and his brothers were Douglass’s eyes in Washington. The youngest sonwas an astute observer of congressional and presidential politics. In February1870, Charles attended the swearing in of Hiram Revels of Mississippi, the firstAfrican American member of the US Senate. Charles informed his father that he“heard it whispered several times in the galleries” that people wished it wereDouglass himself being sworn in. Charles urged the orator to take aim at theCongress and cease the “killing tours through the west,” one of which was underway that very moment in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, and Ohio.24[notes02.html#ch23fn_24a]• • •Charles’s life in Washington was not all consumed in seeking government jobs andobserving politics. During the five years after the war, he was directlyinvolved in organizing two black baseball teams, the Alert and the Mutual BaseBall Clubs. Charles’s embrace of baseball likely began in the army during thewar. He also played second base for a Rochester team, the Excelsior Club, asearly as summer 1865. For a while in 1867 he played for the Union Baseball Cluband reported to his father in August that the team had played an out-of-towngame against the Philadelphia Pythians. The elder Douglass invested in andattended some games, but did not participate. In the wake of the Civil War,baseball boomed in popularity in the capital, as well as in many other cities,especially in the North. All the rules of the American pastime were by no meanssettled in the 1860s. It was played with a bat, a ball, no gloves, and fourbases. Foul lines were still evolving, but teams played with nine men. In thisoffense-favored game, a winning team’s scoring a hundred runs on a weakeropponent was not uncommon. Baseball boomed in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago,and in Richmond, where teams of ex-Confederates played teams of ex-Unionsoldiers with the theme of sectional reunion already awkwardly in the air evenas early as 1866–67.25 [notes02.html#ch23fn_25a]For Charles, and for so many of the other young government workers, black andwhite, baseball was a personal and community outlet. The war was over, anddespite the tremendous political conflicts of Reconstruction, Washington was aburgeoning new city, with nearly forty thousand black residents and overeighty-eight thousand whites. Black baseball clubs, not unlike fraternal ordersand churches in black communities, took on a social-political function. In theseyears the goal was never to gain full integration into white teams and leagues,but to achieve full access to the best playing grounds and to book matches withthe best clubs, such as the famed Washington Nationals. In Washington, thatmeant getting to play official games on the “White Lot,” the huge spaceeventually laid out in baseball fields between the White House and theWashington Monument. Charles, and occasionally his brothers, spent many a lateafternoon hurrying from their jobs to the field to play a game. Blackballplayers of the late 1860s played with or against white players and clubs, asmall part of the great experiment in racial democracy that Reconstructionwrought. It did not last, however; by 1876, the first formal “National League”was formed by white entrepreneurs, players, and coaches determined to keep thegame segregated, a goal they by and large accomplished for the next seventy-fiveyears. Charles Douglass was part of a huge throng of former slaves, Unionsoldiers, and black men born free who created a game forever embedded in thefabric of American democracy.26 [notes02.html#ch23fn_26a]The Douglasses needed sport and amusement. By spring and summer 1870, asDouglass planned a move to Washington to buy and edit a newspaper, the familyfeuds reached a new fever pitch. Nathan had brought a number of his own kinfolkto live at the Douglass homestead. Douglass had apparently acquiesced inallowing Nathan back on the premises, with his own siblings and cousins in tow.As always, Rosetta’s growing family needed a home and Anna’s skilled help.Douglass was the self-made patriarch-grandfather who tried to say no and takestands for self-reliance, but usually said yes.Charles felt betrayed and took it out on his father via Nathan. “Sprague ismaking out a course . . . that will be a trap for his own destruction,” Charlesclaimed in May 1870. He thought him as “ungrateful as a bear.” Then Charleswrote lines he regretted: “None of us lie buried as deep in your pockets as he[Nathan] does, and if we had not a penny from you we would be the same to you aswe are now, ready at all times to abide by your decision, and unspeakablygrateful to you for all we have, and all the favors shown us by others.” Suchsad remarks by the unsuccessful son of a famous man descended deeper yet into adesperate jealousy: “I don’t feel you are safe in your own home while such aconspiracy is going on.” Sprague was the “prime mover in this dirty plot.” Hehad placed “a whole generation of his relatives in and around you . . . and bytrickery and lying he will get you to turn out all others, and then comes thestealings.” Property and the quest for filial approval can make people crazy.“Us boys have an interest in that house,” moaned Charles, “though we may neversee it or be in it again . . . for the best part of our days were spent there,and the place grew with us.”27 [notes02.html#ch23fn_27a] Anna never saw theseletters; how painful it would have been for her to hear such exchanges. ButCharles was not altogether wrong about Sprague’s intentions and character.Douglass’s response came immediately, and Charles felt “very bad.” The fathervehemently objected to the way Charles made demands on the elder’s“possessions.” Charles claimed many a misunderstood “inference.” He did not meanto suggest that his father was a “dupe of Nathan.” “I do not think you weak inmind.” Self-pity turned to self-loathing. “I never had such a thought enter myhead with regard to anything belonging to you,” Charles wrote disingenuously. “Idon’t even feel the place I live in now to be mine. I look upon it as yours,because if it was not for your aid, I should not have gotten it.” “Sprague andhis wife” were “against me and mine.” Over and again, Charles apologized forhaving “offended” his father. A month later, in June, Lewis and Fred Jr. wereboth boarding with Charles, their wives all back home in upstate New York.Charles developed a martyr complex. His clothes were “seedy,” he had lostweight, and he experienced “sharp stinging pains” all down his side, a problemhe attributed to “exposure during the war.” And he was broke. With the latestcheck from his father Charles calculated his total indebtedness at $1,000.28[notes02.html#ch23fn_28a] The elder Douglass needed to make a career move, notmerely for himself. And he had no lack of advice.• • •In each year of the postwar era through 1871, Ottilie Assing continued to spendas much of her summers as possible in Rochester, enjoying the garden andtiptoeing around the family strife. She usually arrived in late June or earlyJuly and stayed into September. She cherished whatever time and attention shecould garner from the man of the house and did her part to contain as she alsocaused the cold war with Anna Douglass. We have no testimony from Anna about thenature of these summer visits. One current poet, M. Nzadi Keita, has triedthrough literary imagination to give Anna a voice for her seething resentments,to tell her side of this mysterious, anguished story. In one of several dozenpoems, many of which try to suggest what “letters” and “words” meant in the waysAnna might have used them, Keita offers a version of Mrs. Douglass’s estimationof Ottilie Assing. In “Attic Window,” she calls Assing “a blue-eyed weed myhusband found,” a woman who was “no guest” and spoke with a “foreign mouth” andwondered “how could a mammy be a match for such a princely man.”29[notes02.html#ch23fn_29a] Such poetry is not a historical source of Anna’sinterior world. But it does provide us a language by which we can gaze into it.Art provides a means to elusive truths, if not the truth itself. What we do knowfrom Assing herself is that, at least in her own blunt letters, she exercisedlittle restraint in judging the personalities, rivalries, and financial woes inDouglass’s family. And Anna certainly knew a good deal of the educated Germanlady’s opinions.Assing felt disgust at Perry’s family after their arrival in the summer of 1867.In a letter to Sylvester Koehler, one of her “gang” of German émigréintellectuals in New Jersey, she expressed gladness that the “dear family fromTexas” had moved into their hastily constructed house on the grounds and nolonger lived “in close proximity before our eyes and noses anymore.” She thoughtthem “incorrigible . . . especially the dear wife, who smokes her pipe” and“whips her children with a riding crop.” Assing particularly objected that theformer slaves understood neither the “concept of gratitude” nor the “concept ofcleanliness.” The sophisticated lady with the books on her lap in the gardenhardly knew what to do when confronted with the raw, brutal legacies of slavery.This was high-German radical culture meets the American black peasantry, thedull, remote plantations of east Texas and Louisiana meets the literary salon ofEuropean freethinkers. Assing’s abolitionism melted into contempt. But Ottiliemelted herself one day a year later as a two-year-old “coffee-brown girl”(Perry’s granddaughter) followed her and her cat around in the garden. Assingadmitted to an urge to adopt this “child of Douglass’s niece.” Then in 1870,after a brief visit from Douglass, she summed up his “impressions from home” asa situation of “screaming children, people who are constantly at the verge ofarmed peace with one another.” And eight years after that, when on one of hisreturns to the Eastern Shore, Douglass sought to retrieve an infirm Perry andbring him to live with him in Washington for his declining years, Ottiliesnidely remarked, “That you should pick up Perry is just like you and naturalenough. . . . Among all the leeches that feed on you he is one of the mostharmless and least expensive.”30 [notes02.html#ch23fn_30a] Often, Assing’s ironywas simply out of place in Douglass’s necessary but nearly impossible effort tobridge slavery and freedom in his family. He managed to live in and communicatewith both worlds—Ottilie’s intellectual salon and a black family, roiling withirreconcilable experiences.In the postwar years Assing herself became one of Douglass’s dependents,although she could never quite admit it. When she lost her place writing forMorgenblatt and relinquished the literary life, she became what her biographercalls “Douglass’s auxiliary.” Her dependency was primarily emotional; shecobbled together a living as a teacher-tutor in and around New York. She evenbegan to refer to herself as Douglass’s “pigtail” in letters, an appendagewishing to follow him if possible on his travels.31 [notes02.html#ch23fn_31a]Sustaining her ties to Douglass, even claiming to be his real wifely companion,became essential to Assing’s identity as she aged. To her sister, Assingcontinually wrote about an internal bond she possessed with Douglass thattranscended “all external circumstances”—meaning that he was married, had alarge extended family, and maintained a widespread public reputation. Sheexpressed lasting gratitude for her connection to Douglass, “even if,” she wrotein 1872, “the external situation remains less than perfect.” Grandiosity leapedfrom her letters. Assing believed she had been tested and had proved her mettlein romance. “Seventeen years, in defiance of all external circumstances, withpeople and prejudices of all kinds against us,” she boldly asserted withself-delusion, “can legitimately be referred as a kind of trial by fire.” A yearlater when her sister had troubles with her husband, Ottilie offered herself asa model: “When one stands in such intimate relation with one man, as is the casewith me in relation to Douglass, one gets to know the whole world, men as wellas women, from angles that would otherwise be closed off to one, especially incases where the man has seen so much of the world and has been loved by so manywomen.” Assing’s fantasy—as the deeper spiritual wife of the world-historicalman—prompted her to increasingly ugly denigrations of Anna, the real wife.Ottilie and Frederick were “kept from one another,” she wrote in 1874, by a“veritable beast” (could be translated “monster”) who “neither has love to givenor knows how to appreciate it.” Assing’s “plight,” she concluded with nods toGerman romanticism, meant that a “kind of fatality inheres in my name,” areference to the character Ottilie, who finds a tragic fate due to a form ofspiritual adultery, in Goethe’s Die Wahlverwandtshaften.32[notes02.html#ch23fn_32a]Ottilie almost never gave up on her quest of drawing Douglass off to a new lifein Europe; like spring itself, it was her annual recurring fantasy. Sheruminated in letters to her sister about her desires to see Europe again. In1869 she said she would “be ready with a thousand joys” if her man would give inand go. “Without Douglass,” Ottilie concluded, she could not “implement my planto visit France, Switzerland and several places in Germany, since travelling allby yourself is a rather sad pleasure.” Sometimes she found a certaincontentedness in asking her sister for photographs of their parents that shecould give to Douglass, as though he were part of their German family. TheAmerican would have had “a close enough relationship” with her mother, Assingmaintained, “if matters were the way they are supposed to be.” She finally gaveup in 1876 and made her journey to Europe after ten years of waiting outDouglass, although not without imagining in her grandiose way that he wouldstill join her after the presidential election. Douglass may have at leastencouraged the fantasy in some of his correspondence. By winter 1877, while inRome, Assing wrote to Douglass wondering about his “schemes.” “May I hope yet tosee you in spring?” she wistfully asked. “If you only let me know exactly thetime when you expect to touch this continent, I shall be ready to . . . receiveyou at the landing.” Her dream remained unfulfilled and her letters became evermore forlorn.33 [notes02.html#ch23fn_33a]There is little evidence that Douglass had any intention of following Assing onsuch an impossible sojourn; rather, it was she who submitted to the schedules,behaviors, and encounters that he determined. She wanted to go to Germany andSwitzerland and read Goethe with her companion on long summer evenings invillage gasthauses; he had to take the sooty, lonely trains thousands of milesto lecture in Ohio and Indiana in the dark cold of January as a primary sourceof his livelihood. The trajectories of these two lives could never fullyintersect. Around all the Douglasses, she was “Miss Assing,” father’s specialfamily friend and intellectual confidant. Ottilie was hardly the first to occupythis role; many others had auditioned; one (Julia Griffiths) had laid all thegroundwork. In some periods of their more than twenty-year relationship,Douglass needed Assing almost as much as she needed him. He did not need apigtail bobbing in his busy wake; but he did benefit greatly from Assing’spatient listening as a sounding board for his emotional and mental life. Helikely cherished her unconditional admiration and devotion, as long as he couldcontrol its contours. Most important, she provided a unique intellectualstimulation from her circle of literary and political radicals among whom he wasmade welcome during his Hoboken stay-overs. Ottilie had a point as well incalling attention during the Reconstruction years to Douglass’s occasional“guilelessness” with money, as well as with her claim that he might haveachieved financial independence had it not been for “all the hangers-on andparasites” who abused his hospitality. But she was ultimately one of thosehangers-on, albeit in a category all her own.34 [notes02.html#ch23fn_34a]Assing’s judgments about the Douglass family disputes were no less rigid andmorally certain than her political and ideological views. Presumably helistened, since she was in the middle of some of the dramas. She liked all threesons, even claiming a certain maternal connection with them by showing them offto her friends when they traveled through New Jersey and stopped to see her.Lewis once spent two weeks staying with Assing and her circle. In June 1868,Charles and Libbie Douglass gave Assing a tour of Washington, DC. She felt theromantic rush of seeing for the first time this center of republicanism and nowgrasped fully why Douglass wanted to be there. When they crossed over intoArlington, Virginia, she gushed, “What a triumph it is to enter the former slavestates as free soil.” Then the three companions took an excursion to GeorgeWashington’s Mount Vernon estate. “Miss Assing treated us to a visit to Mt.Vernon yesterday,” Charles wrote to his father, “and we had a very nice time.”Ottilie was taken with the “minstrel” singers on the boat ride down the Potomac,as well as with an old black gardener at the estate who claimed to have beenWashington’s slave. Assing proudly announced for other tourists to hear that shewas glad to shake hands with the old former slave, since they were meeting onfree soil. Always self-serving, she felt especially proud as the white womantraveling with a well-dressed young black couple.35 [notes02.html#ch23fn_35a]The earnest radical flaunted her egalitarianism on this border so steeped inhistory.Ottilie was never afraid to say, though, that she thought Douglass sometimesspoiled his sons, even the oldest. In 1874 she gossiped that Lewis was back inRochester being “fed like a little boy,” along with “his terrible wife fromSyracuse.” At times, Assing seemed to believe, and said so, that no one was goodenough for the great Douglass except her and the friends she would choose forhim from within her circle of educated companions. Sprague was in her estimationa “disgraced villain” who suffered from “mental inferiority.” In letters toDouglass, she knew she could simply unload from her gut, and he let her do it.“A thousand times rather would I undertake to teach a cat or even Border States[Anna] grammar,” she pronounced, “than to impress him [Nathan] with a sense oftruthfulness and honesty.” Such was Ottilie’s private way of laughing at Annaand telling Frederick that his own family members were stealing his shirtthrough “littleness and trickery.”36 [notes02.html#ch23fn_36a] Her jealousytoward anyone who came between her and her special friend was as palpable as herwill to survive was strong.• • •Assing was ultimately on a fool’s errand, but while it lasted, the relationshipbrought her enormous satisfaction. Her “summer tour to Douglass,” and his comingto her intermittently in Hoboken on his speaking tours, provided an emotionalcenter to their lives that neither could otherwise attain. Douglass tells usnothing explicitly about what his detours to Hoboken meant to him. Asautobiographer, the public man maintained a profound silence about his privatelife. But we can glimpse his emotional life through Assing’s portrayals of hisvisits and of her own pretensions and dreams. If only briefly, he managed torelax in Hoboken. Douglass loved cigars, and Assing gave them to him as gifts;their “fragrance” lingering at her boardinghouse was a pleasant prod to memoryfor Ottilie. In Assing, Douglass had an adoring and astute critic-reader. Muchof what he wrote in the Reconstruction years passed before her eyes. In late1870 she wrote a formal paper about Douglass that she delivered to a literarysociety in New Jersey, a piece that once again added to the mythos of hersubject. She would also sometimes translate one of her essays into English “inorder to read it to Douglass,” when he arrived for a stay-over. Ottilie reveledin garnering personal time with Douglass to introduce him to high-Germanliterary culture. One August, she told her sister, Ludmilla, she was “so happyto have found a volume of Goethe in good English translation here [Rochester],Faust, Egmont, Tasso, Iphigenie and Goetz von Berlichingen, and you can imaginewhat a pleasure it is for me to introduce Douglass to all this.”37[notes02.html#ch23fn_37a] We do not know just how much of German literatureAssing’s companion digested; there is little evidence of his ever quoting fromit.But Assing worked assiduously on Douglass’s views about religion, trying toconvert him to atheism via the writings of Ludwig Feuerbach. Assing gloried inbelieving that she persuaded her friend to abandon all elements of Christianity,a dubious claim at best and one Douglass never openly confirmed. In 1859, Assingbought an English version of Feuerbach’s famous 1841 philosophical work, TheEssence of Christianity, translated by George Eliot. She gave this manifesto ofatheism to Douglass, accompanied by a bust of Feuerbach, which eventuallyresided among many other portraits and images in his study at Cedar Hill. Sheeven wrote an extraordinary letter to Feuerbach thanking him for helping herconvert the American reformer. Just how closely Douglass read Feuerbach is notclear. Religious hypocrisy about slavery and racism had sparked his thought andrhetoric throughout his public life. He had mastered the craft of the jeremiad,indeed with the core values of Christianity and its central stories, not againstthem. Condemnation of religious contradiction is not itself an antireligiousprescription. In so much Christian, especially Protestant, tradition, it isprecisely the opposite. As a freethinking, stern, self-contained individualistincapable of mustering the pragmatic open mind by which Douglass had maturedinto consciousness and activism, Assing seems never to have comprehended thiselement of her hero’s character.38 [notes02.html#ch23fn_38a]With beguiling logic, Feuerbach made a layered case for God as the invention ofman out of man’s own consciousness and will. Religion, Feuerbach contended, wasbetter understood as anthropology, a fascinating creation of man’s need forculture. Feuerbach’s atheism could add up to a blinding hubris or self-love. Butparts of it might also have been liberating to Douglass’s spongelike, evolvingmind in the harrowing Civil War and Reconstruction years. He might have valuedFeuerbach’s notion that the end of love was “love,” and the end of free will wasto “be free.”39 [notes02.html#ch23fn_39a] An apocalyptic historical view ofGod’s interventions in history might coexist well with such a call for humans toact when the time has come. Assing had somehow missed one of the essentialarguments in Douglass’s life’s work: that without the Old Testament’s bracingnarrative of declension, destruction, exile, renewal, and return, AfricanAmerican slaves, their vanguard in the black regiments during the war, and theirmost famous prophetic voice might never have imagined their freedom in theBabylon of America.Douglass’s personal faith no doubt changed over time; the early influence ofFather Lawson in the streets of Baltimore, Douglass’s early years preaching frombiblical texts in the AME Zion Church, gave way to a widely read, politicizedmind and advocate of the natural-rights tradition. But as he employed theDeclaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the new creeds of thenation’s second founding against his own country, he never gave up on the Exodusstory nor the majesty of Isaiah’s wisdom nor Jeremiah’s warnings. Much can bemade of Douglass’s endless critique of religious hypocrisy, and no greaterexample exists in his torrent of words than in the Fourth of July speech of1852. In that lecture’s brilliant middle section, the orator bludgeoned falseprophets and slaveholding “scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites.” Douglass showeredhis targets with hailstorms of their own sins: “For my part, welcome infidelity!welcome atheism! Welcome anything! in preference to the gospel, as preached bythose Divines!” Assing’s biographer quotes that passage as evidence of theauthor’s early proclivity to atheism. But such an interpretation makes no sensewhen one turns the page and sees Douglass declare his embrace of a genuineChristianity by using the words of James 1:27: a “pure and undefiled religion,”which is “first pure, then peaceable, easy to be entreated, full of mercy andgood fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.” Then he deftly employedIsaiah, demanding that Americans exalt the poor over the rich, the slave overthe tyrant, and bring “no more vain oblations” to their defiled Sabbaths. Hiswas always a religion of action and faith. He demanded, when young and old, thatAmericans “cease to do evil, learn to do well . . . relieve the oppressed; judgefor the fatherless; plead for the widow.”40 [notes02.html#ch23fn_40a] Douglassknew he had never invented Isaiah. If pressed, he might have admitted that itwas the other way around.Without a doubt, Douglass enjoyed the admiration and intellectual stimulation hereceived from Assing’s salon of radical thinkers. Almost every time Douglasscame to town, her friends would gather for conversation. It was especiallyimportant to Ottilie that her friends—the Koehlers; Dr. Gustav Frauensein, aphysician; Karl Heinzen of Boston and Dr. E. J. Lowenthal, both GermanForty-Eighters; Dr. Johannes Lange, an attorney; and C. N. Riotte, a GermanAmerican diplomat—accepted Douglass. Assing preferred the conversation of themen and frankly despised most of their wives, whom she called “stupid” and“uneducated.” A typical Douglass visit was often, whether he wished it or not, a“festive occasion.” Ottilie had Frederick as guest for New Year’s Eve 1870. Theyshared some time “beautifully undisturbed” until all of her neighbors and fellowboardinghouse mates assembled and began discussions, thoroughly “lionizing” herguest, which, according to Assing, he enjoyed as much as they.41[notes02.html#ch23fn_41a] All this undivided attention and respect gave Douglasssomething special in his life, and wholly different from “the hill” inRochester. He no doubt tried out many political ideas on the members ofOttilie’s group; she no doubt managed a fascinating discussion among the men.Nowhere else in Douglass’s life did he find such a life of the mind.For the former slave, these occasional visits among such a group allowed him therecognition that he had indeed risen into the thinking classes. Above all,Douglass learned from Assing; her arrogance and his less blustering conceitsabout his own self-created life of the mind made a strange but useful match. Onhis frenzied travels out on the western lecture circuit, or whenever he felt thedull, sandy soil of Talbot County and the Tuckahoe falling in around him, heknew he had such a retreat. Assing’s circle gave him recurring evidence that hehad crossed his Chesapeake to a refuge on a safe shore. Sometimes Ottilie’smeddling in Douglass’s work life prompted from him a strong response. When shespilled to Horace Greeley that he might be planning a trip to speak in Georgia,hoping by exposure to cause him to cancel, Douglass wrote to Koehler, whomOttilie had enlisted in her scheme: “My good friend—Miss Assing, is wise in manythings, but is sometimes disposed to look at ‘Mole Hills’ as Mountains.”Carefully but firmly, Douglass let it be known that he did not want his plans“trumpeted to the world.” His was a controlled anger. “I must be a little morecareful how I whisper my thoughts to my dear Miss Assing. The vehemence of heropposition sometimes makes necessary a just sense of Independence to go straightforward.”42 [notes02.html#ch23fn_42a] But in Assing, Douglass had theintellectual companion, if not always a fully trustworthy one, that he had firstknown in Julia Griffiths. When he moved to Washington to edit a new paper,Assing would often be there with him at the editorial desk, or as a regularcorrespondent from New Jersey. The hero was his own unique creation, and hewould increasingly draw that line of independence with Ottilie, but his storystill evolved and he had much more to tell. He had always needed help,especially from skilled, loving, educated women.To understand how Douglass could sustain both his marriage and his friendshipwith Assing, it is worth returning to elements of his early youth. The only realfamily attachment that Douglass remembered in his autobiographies was hisgrandmother, and though idealized and beloved, she always remained shrouded inthe images of the day even she abandoned him. From the day Betsy Bailey, byslavery’s evil logic, left him forever at the Wye plantation at the age of six,Douglass said he carried a “wounded soul” that “affected me so deeply.” Inlyrical language, Douglass made plain why he could never forgive slavery and hisowners for robbing him of familial attachments. “I never think of this terribleinterference of slavery with my infantile affections,” he wrote in Bondage andFreedom, “and its diverting them from its natural course, without feelings towhich I can give no adequate expression.” Here, and in the Narrative before, hehad signaled his lifelong quest for an idealized mother’s care, and a home thatmight provide it. In his fleeting, invented memories of his actual mother, heimagined “a bright gleam of a mother’s love.” But that was memory acting asdesire for love and some claim to a child’s normal safety. Slavery, hemaintained, had stolen from him all “filial affection,” the most basic elementsof parental love. Douglass was trying to tell us that he had never found it easyto love, while always seeking love as much as anything else in life. To grasphow he later coped with the deep complexities of his family and emotional life,we do well to remember his critique of slavery not merely as abolitionistpropaganda, but as his cry for the healing of his own wounds: slavery “had mademy brothers and sisters strangers to me; it converted the mother that bore meinto a myth; it shrouded my father in mystery, and left me without anintelligible beginning in the world.”43 [notes02.html#ch23fn_43a]Perhaps the thing in life he needed most was all but forever beyond his grasp,and certainly not achievable in one woman. Douglass might cling to some of thefemale relationships in his life at the same time any profoundly deep love mayhave been an unbearable intensity. Denied any family attachment in his youth, hefiercely sought and protected a sense of “home” once he and Anna could createone, from New Bedford to Rochester, and Washington, DC. Precisely how hejustified to his entire family the blatant insensitivity of having Assing in hishousehold is not altogether knowable. But he lived with that daily insensitivityand worked his brain and body to the bone to provide for them all. What Douglasssustained, sometimes under one roof, was the comforting presence—for him—of bothAnna (the mother and grandmother who would never abandon him), and the equallycomforting and stimulating presence of adoring intellectual women (Julia andOttilie) who not only fulfilled realms of his ego that Anna could not, but mayeven have been idealized versions of that literate mother he created in theautobiographies. Douglass somehow possessed the stamina and mental stability tosustain all these contradictions into his fifties and sixties.44[notes02.html#ch23fn_44a] He was surely a willing, if at times humbled,patriarch. He was absolutely devoted to his children even as he expressed aparent’s natural frustrations. Slavery had denied him a father; he would neverlet that happen to his children.• • •How this all affected Anna Douglass back in her domestic domain is ours tospeculate. The poet Nzadi Keita can help again. In “History,” we hear Anna begto be heard: “When the writer turns to me, what shape will fill his mouth?” Annawonders. “Will it be said that I could speak?” She painfully asks, “Who willremember bread and stew that set those bound for Canada on their feet?” Aboveall, she hopes no one will “paint across my truth.”45 [notes02.html#ch23fn_45a]No one should paint across Anna Douglass’s truth nor forget her bread and stew.She was a good deal more than what we think we know, and far more than herhusband ever told us.Anna’s life was long and often, no doubt, fulfilling. The loss of Annie in 1860was surely unbearable, and seeing her boys off to war terrifying. Her husband’sthousand long absences were at first fearful, but in time routine. Thegrandchildren came along eventually in bunches, although their lives wereeventually fraught with disease and tragedy. Anna was likely a woman who knewfully what she could control and a good deal about what she could not. She hadto fight for respect as a quiet, never cleverly verbal woman in an environmentwith too many comparisons, in a household defined at least in part by theliterary genius and heroic activist who ruled it. Words were not her forte; herMaryland biscuits served up in her stolid manner left her mark. When Rosettadescribed her mother as her father’s “faithful ally, guarding as best she couldevery interest connected with . . . his life-work,” she captured somethingcompelling.46 [notes02.html#ch23fn_46a]Anna came from a huge family in Denton, Maryland, on the far side of theTuckahoe River. Both parents were enslaved, as were her seven older siblings.Anna was the first in her family born free. She left such a struggling, enormousclan of kin at age seventeen and went to Baltimore. We know her because offorty-four years of marriage to Douglass. The heart of her story, though, is notonly that she was crucial in his liberation from slavery, but that she too,perhaps even more than he, understood the meaning of holding together andprotecting a black family in racist, hostile America. Her garden forself-sufficiency, mothering skills, and stern personality made “the hill” onSouth Avenue possible as much as her husband’s speaking fees and book royalties.Perhaps her acceptance of Assing’s summers usurping her house by the late 1860sand beyond was simply out of fatigue and a sense of security; Anna acquiesced inwhat Douglass needed as long as nothing terrible happened to threaten the familyany more than its own internal battles already did. She may even have developedsympathy for the lonely German lady who showed up every summer among the throng,as the irises gave way to daylilies in the garden.Anna knew so much, and she too had the mental stability, as long as her healthendured, to live with the arrangement. But on June 2, 1872, the world theDouglasses had made at the end of South Avenue in Rochester was destroyed. Afternearly twenty-five years, Anna and Frederick would be packing again, in greatsorrow, to go live in a place that would value his words and where she wouldspend her last decade as the “wife of an important man.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 24--------------------------------------------------------------------------------VENTURESThere is for men and women no happiness without venture.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, SEPTEMBER 1, 1874Around midnight on June 2, 1872, a fire broke out in the barn just a shortdistance from the Douglass house on the hill in Rochester. Within hours thewood-frame structures were all destroyed. Most of the huge book collection wassaved. Someone knew that was a priority. Douglass’s sets of the complete worksof Shakespeare, Dickens, and Burns, as well as many volumes about biblicalexegesis, were strewn in safe piles around the yard by the next morning. Rosettaand Nathan Sprague, the men from a fire company, as well as other neighbors,helped save the books, some furniture, and even a piano from the burning house.But much was also lost. Twenty-one years of labor and of family memories lay insmoldering ashes.1 [notes02.html#ch24fn_1a]The fire company came up South Avenue as fast as it could behind its horses butlacked enough water to stop the blaze. As though depicting a fireworks display,a local paper described a macabre scene: “The flames lit up the horizon formiles and cast lurid shadows on the surrounding trees, rendering their foliageintensely beautiful.” Anna, Rosetta, and Nathan all rushed to save the couple’sfour small children—Annie, Harriet, Allie, and Stella. One press report gaveNathan credit for a heroic dash back into a bedroom in flames to save the lessthan two-year-old Stella. He also saved the horses from an outlying stable ahundred feet from the house. Everything in the main barn, however, was lost. TheRochester Democrat and Chronicle especially lamented the “beautiful grove”surrounding the Douglass homestead. It “was entirely destroyed, and with itswell-kept walks, neat out houses and picturesque situation was an ornament toour city.” Rosetta was pregnant at the time of the fire and within two months ofdelivering her fifth child. Reports immediately indicated arson, or “undoubtedlythe work of an incendiary.” Nathan told the press that “no light or fire” hadbeen “used about the barn since last winter.” No press coverage reported AnnaDouglass’s personal sense of loss.2 [notes02.html#ch24fn_2a]When the fire occurred, Douglass had taken up a second residence in Washingtonas he and his sons edited the New National Era, a paper he had purchased in1870. He had spent the spring as far away as New Orleans lecturing, as well asup and down the East Coast. A telegram on June 3 informed him of the horriblenews, but that his family was unharmed. Within twenty-four hours he arrived inRochester at 1:00 a.m. in a torrential rainstorm. He did not know where hisfamily would be so he tried to check into a hotel. Two hotels, the Congress Halland the Waverly House, both denied him a room because they were full. A circuscompany was in town, although Douglass would not quite accept that explanationof his rejection. From the local police he learned that the Post and the Porterfamilies had taken in Anna and the family. In the morning daylight Douglasswalked through the mud out South Avenue to see the devastation. In his personalaccount, published a week later, he said it was “almost like going home to afuneral.” Painfully, he described “twenty years of industry and economy” lost ina few hours. “Scarcely a trace of the building, except brick walls and stonefoundations” remained to be seen on that awful morning.3[notes02.html#ch24fn_3a]Douglass calculated his losses at “$4,000 to $5,000,” especially stressing theadditional full run of sixteen volumes of his newspapers, and “eleven thousanddollars worth of government securities.”4 [notes02.html#ch24fn_4a] Thegovernment bonds remained a serious contention in his family and marriage.Ottilie Assing had an interest in those bonds and, as usual, strong opinionsabout why they were lost. Her reaction to the news of the fire was one smallpart shock and a large part self-interest.A week after the event Assing informed her sister that the house fire had“pulled the rug from under my feet.” Her summer plans were ruined. She expressednot a word about the well-being of Douglass family members, but was quick toblame Anna for the potential loss of the government securities. Each bond had acorresponding number, and they had all been placed in a “light tin box” kept inAnna’s bedroom. In the panic of the fire, Anna had allegedly forgotten the box.Assing’s story was that “eleven thousand dollars . . . were burned, probablybecause the stupid old woman totally lost her head, as is usually the case withuneducated people, for she would have had sufficient time to save them . . . andshe had been instructed a hundred times to save said tin box in case of amisfortune.” The utterly self-certain Ottilie did not stop there: “No otherexplanation is possible. She [Anna] probably thought more of her wig and a dozensilver spoons.” But Assing believed she had saved the day, since she herself hadrecorded all the numbers: “Thanks to my prudence, the numbers were safe.” Aboveall, Assing felt “desperation” about what to do with her summer now. She hadalways considered the “beautiful residence” in Rochester “to be my home . . .deeply intertwined with my past and present.” Her home had been destroyed. Sheworried that without the green gardens at South Avenue in Rochester as herretreat, she would “grow worn down and peeved.”5 [notes02.html#ch24fn_5a] Onedoubts that Assing ever expressed such a desecration of a family’s grief toDouglass himself about the fire. If she did, all we can hope is that hedenounced her.Douglass had no doubts as to the origin of the fire and whose home had beentorched. He assumed his house had been burned by a racially motivated arsonist.Rochester was one of the most liberal of Northern cities, he admitted. But ithad “its full share of that Ku Klux spirit which makes anything owned by acolored man a little less respected and secure than when owned by a whitecitizen.” No one was ever arrested for the arson. One local paper even printedthe unfounded rumor that blacks had committed the crime. However, Douglasspublicly placed his personal loss at the feet not only of Rochester, but of theentire nation’s recent history of deadly racial violence. He knew a great dealabout the nature of bone-deep racism. He and his kin had been attacked, hefirmly believed, by “the spirit of hate, the spirit of murder, the spirit thatwould burn a family out of their beds.”6 [notes02.html#ch24fn_6a]For the past five years that “spirit” had murdered and burned thousands ofAfrican Americans out of their beds. Douglass’s explanation of what had happenedto him in Rochester was a logical extension of the frequent reporting he haddone about the Ku Klux Klan in the New National Era. The Klan had served as aprimary weapon of the white Southern Democratic Party’s counterrevolutionagainst Reconstruction since the 1868 elections. Their attacks were campaigns tothwart and destroy black and Republican Party political activity. Theirintimidation, torture, rape, arson, and murders had primarily been targeted atblacks who were either political leaders or people of economic independence.Douglass now felt that he and his family were among the victims.7[notes02.html#ch24fn_7a]This sordid history of domestic terrorism makes Douglass’s claim of a “Ku Kluxspirit” in western New York plausible. Just as lynchings two decades later knewno North-South border, racial mob violence was a national practice. In 1870–71,Douglass had vigorously applauded the Grant administration’s efforts by law andby prosecution to wipe out the Klan. In editorials, Douglass likened mobviolence to prewar proslavery ideology and to the same white supremacy thatanimated the Confederacy. “A rebellion is upon our hands today far moredifficult to deal with than that suppressed but not annihilated in 1865,” hesaid in April 1871. “Ku Kluxism . . . now moves over the South like thepestilence that walketh in darkness and wasteth at noon-day.” Douglass despisedany conciliations to the white South. In November, he declared himself disgustedwith “this cry of peace! peace! where there is no peace.” Just one week beforethe fire in Rochester, Douglass published a column, “Shall We Surrender to theKu Klux?,” in which he linked Democrats with the “ex-rebel Klan’s” efforts to“kill loyal men and women . . . to burn down school houses for the education ofthe Negro.” The Klan and all the mobs inspired by them had put the wholecountry, he said, in an “attitude of war.”8 [notes02.html#ch24fn_8a] When he sawhis house in ruin and his grove of trees scorched, Douglass observed the hill atthe end of South Avenue as one small outpost in a vast and violent civil warthat had never ended.• • •Rochester friends tried to convince Douglass to rebuild in the city. For as muchas a year he may have considered staying, but in June 1873, he wrote to hisclose friend Samuel Porter and asked him to “advertise and sell that propertyfor me.” He also engaged a lawyer, Horatio Gates Warner, to whom he wrote, “Iwould prefer to sell outright and shall feel obliged if you will find me apurchaser.”9 [notes02.html#ch24fn_9a] Douglass would never cut all ties toRochester, although he did sell the property. In the wake of the fire, hequickly determined to remove Anna and as much of the extended family as possibleto Washington, where he purchased a town house at 316 A Street, only a fewblocks east of the Capitol. While he certainly expressed his rage at the burningof his house, of his personal grief he said as usual very little. Of what itfelt like to hug Anna, Rosetta, and the grandchildren while standing in front ofthe smoldering ruins of their homestead, the place that had once housed JohnBrown and at least a hundred runaway slaves, we learn next to nothing. What wedo know is that Douglass eagerly relocated to the center of American power.Douglass often portrayed himself as lacking faith in his political aptitude. Buthe learned fast and had honed such instincts during the great politicalstruggles of the 1850s and the war years. Although he had spent much of hiscareer as a radical outsider, now he aimed at offices and appointments thatbrought him inside circles of influence in the brave new world of ReconstructionWashington. His voice would still be that of a radical; but much more workemerged now for the pragmatist, the party man, and the racial symbol. “Variancebetween great men finds no healing influence in the atmosphere of Washington,”Douglass wrote in Life and Times. “Interested parties are ever ready to fan theflame of animosity and magnify the grounds of hostility in order to gain thefavor of one or the other.” All communities did thus, he argued presciently, butnowhere more than in the capital, where “a large class of people” were“dependent for their daily bread upon the influence and favor of powerful publicmen.”10 [notes02.html#ch24fn_10a] Douglass, with his sons, joined that classfull of hope born of the revolution of emancipation.As early as 1867, President Johnson had tried to co-opt Douglass into replacingGeneral Oliver Howard as director of the Freedmen’s Bureau. Through the WhiteHouse steward, William Slade, a message was conveyed to Charles Douglass thatthe job could be his father’s if he so wished. A letter followed, in effectoffering the elder Douglass the job. But Douglass smelled the rat and turned itdown. He had seen this trick before—a presidential or cabinet initiative toco-opt him to make an agency less relevant. His reply to Slade, though carefuland politic, included a wry swipe at the president he loathed. Douglass said hewould “always be glad” to hear anything from the insider Slade on the “directionof events” from within the White House. Douglass was especially delighted toknow that since Johnson wanted to “place a colored man at the head of theBureau,” he was well on the way to fulfilling his “purpose of being the Moses ofthe colored man in the United States.”11 [notes02.html#ch24fn_11a] Douglasswanted a federal appointment, but he would never do Andrew Johnson’s bidding.After campaigning vigorously for Grant in 1868, the first election in Americanhistory when blacks voted in significant numbers, Douglass entertained hope forsome kind of presidential appointment. That took time. His first offer came notfrom government but from a former slave and Presbyterian minister in Washington,John Sella Martin. In 1869, Martin and a small group of black men, includingGeorge T. Downing, wanted to launch a black-owned-and-operated newspaper; theyinvited Douglass to be its editor in chief. Martin wanted Douglass and others totake on the paper as a matter of racial pride. “Its chief feature,” Martin said,“is to manifest our interest in Reconstruction and our grasp of its problems.”Martin asked for $5,000 from Douglass to start the paper; the former editor drewon experience and argued that it would need much more financial backing tosucceed and further balked because he would be working without a salary. But onJanuary 13, 1870, in the growing black community of Uniontown, a first issue ofthe weekly New Era was published, with Martin as editor, Douglass ascorresponding editor, and Lewis Douglass as printer. The paper collapsedfinancially within six months. By September, it reemerged as the New NationalEra, with Douglass now as part owner and its editor. He shortly became its soleproprietor with an investment of at least $10,000. Douglass had told Martinearlier that he was not prepared to “venture upon this voyage of journalism uponso slender a bark as five thousand dollars.”12 [notes02.html#ch24fn_12a] ButDouglass loved journalism and saw the opportunity not only to employ all hissons, but to establish an African American voice in the political center ofReconstruction.During the three years that Douglass and his team—which included Lewis,Frederick Jr., and Ottilie Assing—published the New National Era, he made thepaper into a personal organ with large ambitions. The issues were both new andold; they included social uplift and the role of religion in African Americanlife, black and women’s suffrage, foreign expansion, new postemancipationdilemmas over labor and capital, and especially electoral politics andDouglass’s unique quest for control of the public memory of the Civil War. Onceagain Douglass demonstrated that he was one of the great activist journalists ofAmerican history. His family and friends hoped, futilely, that the role ofeditor would allow Douglass to cease the grueling speaking tours. Assingrepeatedly pled with him to stop “those abhorrent winter lecturing tours to thewest.” Charles wrote with even more urgency in January 1873 about just how farwestward Douglass had to venture: “I hope you will get home before the first ofMarch. It seems to me that you might let your Nebraska appointments go. . . .Thirty years on railroads and steamboats, aside from lecturing night afternight, would kill most any ordinary man.”13 [notes02.html#ch24fn_13a] ButDouglass could not stop; he never abandoned the call of the platform or thenecessity of lecture fees.The passage by Congress of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1869 and its ratificationby March 1870, guaranteeing the right to vote for black men, drew Douglass yetmore to the lecture circuit even as he began editing the newspaper. Douglass wasone of the leading voices in the chorus of celebration among formerabolitionists. Although he would have preferred a broader amendment that wouldhave prohibited qualification tests for suffrage, and he quickly becameembroiled in controversy over the exclusion of women, he nevertheless rejoicedin its passage. In the spring of 1870 Douglass spoke at ratification rallies allover the North. At the meeting of the American Anti-Slavery Society in New Yorkin April, after which it went out of business, Douglass spoke of his amazementat the historic changes of the past decade: “I seem myself to be living in a newworld. The sun does not shine as it used to.”14 [notes02.html#ch24fn_14a]One of the largest celebrations of the Fifteenth Amendment took place inBaltimore in mid-May. Twenty thousand blacks marched in a parade with brassbands, and an audience of six thousand listened to a series of speeches. Theoccasion reminded Douglass of his poignant first return to his old hometown inNovember 1864, when he had summoned Genesis—Noah’s ark and the flood—to capturethe meaning of Maryland as a free state. But five years and three greatconstitutional amendments later made him now look forward. In his remarksDouglass pointed to three great symbols of black progress: the “cartridge box,”the “ballot box,” and the “jury box.” In this compelling moment, the former FredBailey stood in the central square of Baltimore, where he could feel if notalmost see his slave roots down in Fell’s Point, and addressed a cheering throngof his people claiming their birthright as citizens. “We have a future!”Douglass shouted as he concluded, “Everything is possible to us!” Despite theuncertainties over whether the Fifteenth Amendment could truly protect blacksuffrage against white subterfuge, the celebration was one for the heart morethan the head. The gathering did not adjourn until it passed—or shouted—severalresolutions, one of which recognized Douglass as the “foremost man of color inthe times” and appealed to him to lead blacks “to a higher, broader, and noblermanhood.”15 [notes02.html#ch24fn_15a] Douglass had lived so much of his life,and written so many words, to imagine the sense of future in the air that day inBaltimore.Soon, Douglass had little choice but to take a more sober approach to themeaning of the Fifteenth Amendment. A growing indifference toward thefreedpeople among Northern whites, the reign of terror by the Klan in the South,the resurgence of the Democratic Party, and the readmission to the Union of theformer Confederate states all put black rights under a cloud of uncertainty.Back at his editor’s desk, Douglass entered the 1870s urging blacks todistinguish between what was “seeming” and what was “real” in their prospects;he cautioned people not to be absorbed by a “delirium of enthusiasm.” Thestruggle to secure black equality had only begun. Citing the Declaration ofIndependence and the Bill of Rights, he urged his readers to remember America’shistorical contradictions between law and practice. “The settled habits of anation,” Douglass asserted, are “mightier than a statute.” The editor’s penbrought the soaring rhetoric of Baltimore back to earth. The nation must bevigilant fighting the “hardships and wrongs which continue to be the lot of thecolored people,” Douglass wrote by fall 1870, “because they wear a complexionwhich two hundred and fifty years of slavery taught the great mass of Americanpeople to hate, and which the Fifteenth Amendment has not yet taught theAmerican people to love.”16 [notes02.html#ch24fn_16a]• • •In 1868–70, Douglass’s lecturing, despite his receiving more invitations thanever, had gone a bit stale. His speaking itineraries in those two years werealmost superhuman. From September 22, 1868, when he spoke at the tomb of AbrahamLincoln in Springfield, Illinois, on the sixth anniversary of the PreliminaryEmancipation Proclamation, to late March 1869, he delivered at least forty-fivelectures in ten states all across the North and back again. The schedule fromfall 1869 to spring 1870, which included Fifteenth Amendment addresses, was evenmore arduous, totaling at least seventy-two lectures. He spoke on every day ofDecember except one, including Christmas, in towns from Vermont and NewHampshire through Massachusetts to Rhode Island. From January through March 1870Douglass barnstormed from Connecticut through Massachusetts and New York, toWashington, DC, and then west through Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,Iowa, Michigan, and back again to western New York.17 [notes02.html#ch24fn_17a]In the election year of 1872, his speaking schedule was nothing short ofbreathtaking, as he steamed across the American map. In a train station in Iowain the cold of January, a Milwaukee Sentinel reporter cornered an exhaustedDouglass for an impromptu interview. Having just witnessed the orator’s speech,the journalist suggested that the audience had expected to see him “more activeand fiery.” Douglass’s answers were playful but revealing: “I am getting aboutover my fiery days. I used to saw the air and split the ears of the groundlings;but I care more for reasoning out my point now.” The correspondent wondered whyDouglass appeared “less voluble.” “I am older,” admitted the white-manedsojourner. He no longer plied his trade in “torrents of words,” Douglassdeclared. “Besides, if I warm up and speak rapidly, I am in danger of throwingmy teeth out. They’re false, you know.” Douglass assured the nosy reporter, in asentiment known to every celebrity in modern times, that among the most tryingaspects of being on the road endlessly were the “friends” who persisted indesiring to “look at me . . . and question me all the time . . . leaving mehalf-exhausted.” In November, Douglass wrote to Rosetta as a weary grandfather,worn-out from travel. He worried that his next lecture topic would not succeedand desperately sought relief in “the coming winter from labors, perils andfatigues of a lecturing campaign.”18 [notes02.html#ch24fn_18a]Not only did the physical burden of travel wear him out, but he tried out a newspeech that flopped. In late August 1868, Douglass told Gerrit Smith that he hadspent that summer “endeavouring to make myself a little more familiar withhistory.” Among the histories he was reading was the multivolume and widelypopular Rise of the Dutch Republic (1856) by John Lothrop Motley, aMassachusetts-born and Harvard-educated historian. Just why Douglass took upMotley and the story of the sixteenth-century Dutch revolt against the Spanishempire is not altogether clear. Motley’s triumphalist, muscular narrative mayhave been one draw. His repeated stress on how the Dutch republic ought to bethe great model for all of the “Anglo-Saxon race” in finding the roots of its“master passion—the love of liberty,” apparently did not bother this formerslave reader. He assumed that he needed a new, carefully written address eachyear. Although fully aware that his personal story was why people still flockedand paid to see his performances, Douglass became weary of reciting the sametale over and over. In 1871, he admitted serious anxiety that he might never“get beyond Fredk. Douglass the self educated fugitive slave.” On a lonelywinter day in March 1873, he wrote to Amy Post from a “queer named place,”Damariscotta, Maine, about a recent lecture in Philadelphia that was not asuccess. The story of my escape, he said, “was clumsily told because I had noheart in telling it. There is really nothing exciting in it.”19[notes02.html#ch24fn_19a] Douglass wanted respect as a serious Emerson-likelyceum speaker. Sometimes he achieved such regard, sometimes not.Douglass had good fortune on the circuit with speeches such as his “Self-MadeMen” and “Composite Nation,” an address about the idea of a multiracial societyin America that he first delivered in 1867. But his effort in “William theSilent” was not his best work. Relying on Motley, Douglass tried to fashion ananalogy between the Dutch rebellions against the Spanish with the AmericanRevolution against the British, and even the winning of the Civil War againstthe Confederacy. In surviving texts of the speech, Douglass made a case for waras the “school” that “develops great characters, great deeds, great qualities.”Liberty, he said, is “valued . . . for what it costs” and gained respect onlywhen “marked in blood.” In January 1869, he delivered the speech in Gettysburg,America’s bloodiest battleground. To a full house in an agricultural hall, hespoke for an hour and three-quarters and garnered two opposite reactions. Thelocal Republican paper thought the effort “the lecture of the season,” and oneof “impassioned eloquence.” But the Democratic paper lampooned Douglass as the“pet . . . negro” of the Radicals, called him “Fred,” and chastised him for hisanti-Catholic comments. To the racist Democrats, the “ebony idol” victimizedwhite people with his “impertinent and rancorous tirade.” In many venues, raceand politics mattered far more than any historical subject.20[notes02.html#ch24fn_20a]At some performances the address seemed so anti-Catholic in its celebration ofthe achievement of Protestant religious liberty that some Catholic priests letDouglass know their objections. One Ohio priest pilloried the orator for his“very ugly insinuation against Catholics,” calling the “repetitions of ‘Pope,’and ‘Bishops,’ and ‘Inquisition’ ” a “senseless tirade of a mob-lecturer.” Theaddress further included odd asides about Douglass’s “peculiar acquaintance withwomen” and their “latent powers” as fighters. A strange defense of Mary ToddLincoln against her critics also seemed out of place. The orator alsoentertained his audience with a self-reflective use of “nigger.” The irony andhumor may have worked in Cincinnati, but it had nothing to do with the subjectat hand.21 [notes02.html#ch24fn_21a]This venture into history fell especially flat when Douglass asserted one finalanalogy he knew to be false: “A hundred battles might be lost, the nation nevercould lose confidence in Lincoln.” Ottilie Assing was among those who found thisuse of Lincoln especially annoying. “I absolutely cannot stand things likethat,” she told Koehler, “and even if history is making a mistake with regard toLincoln by passing on an inappropriately rosy picture of him to posterity . . .all of us should be all the more intent on not making said picture look evenrosier.” That season Douglass had assumed a low common denominator in hisauditors’ sense of history. Some apparently felt his condescension and objected.On one occasion, Douglass actually apologized for his lack of enthusiasm, sayingthat since “the death of slavery,” he had no one or thing to “pitch into.”22[notes02.html#ch24fn_22a] Sometimes Othello did lose his voice and his vervefloundered.• • •Happily, the editor’s pen beckoned. Douglass got his voice back in the NewNational Era. He loved the rush and excitement of getting the paper out everyThursday; he even liked setting type, although he left that now to Lewis’s moredexterous fingers. Douglass especially thrived on having his own say onReconstruction policy and national events. He wanted to be the mouthpiece forblack people, but he very much spoke, as he had in the 1850s, for himself. Andin the newly complex world of Reconstruction and beyond, a new generation ofblack editors and writers stood ready to challenge his leadership at every turn.Douglass needed all the help he could assemble. In the first months of thepaper, Assing reported, “Douglass is demanding a new article [from her] for the‘Era’ almost every week.” In August 1872, two months after the Rochester fire,she told her sister, Ludmilla, that Douglass had called her to Washington toassist in editing the paper. She moved into a room in the town house with theDouglasses and seemed thrilled “to have a hand in all these things as ajournalist myself.” Puffed up over her new post, Ottilie gushed about herprofessional partner: “Douglass is one of the most influential and magnificentleaders on the part of the Republicans.” And the “Era has become a powerhouseall of a sudden.”23 [notes02.html#ch24fn_23a] Douglass did not quite feel thosesame sentiments himself; the paper always teetered on the verge of bankruptcy,and his influence was largely symbolic.In the three years that he and his sons edited the New National Era, theReconstruction policies of the Radical Republicans rose and then began to fall.As the survival of Reconstruction hung in the balance in successive elections,Douglass made the memory of emancipation his major preoccupation, pushing hisreaders to never forget what the war had been about. In the fall of 1870 hewarned that Americans were by habit “destitute of political memory.” As apartisan Republican and black advocate, Douglass resisted the efforts ofDemocrats and all other white supremacists to “bury dead issues.” “The peoplecannot and will not forget the issues of the rebellion,” he declared. Democrats“must continue to face the music of the past as well as of the present.”24[notes02.html#ch24fn_24a] Douglass believed the political struggle overReconstruction depended on winning the fight over the memory of the war.The energized editor realized the power of the “Lost Cause” as both a historicalargument and a racial ideology. The Lost Cause was in these early yearsessentially an explanation of defeat and a set of beliefs in search of ahistory—ex-Confederates’ contentions that they had never been defeated onbattlefields but by the Northern leviathan of industrial might; that they hadnever fought for slavery but for state sovereignty and homeland; that theSouth’s racially ordered civilization had been tragically crushed by Yankeeinvasion; and that “just” causes can lose militarily but with time regain themoral and political high ground. Douglass vehemently resisted the rapidemergence in national political circles of these ideas. He was appalled at thenational veneration of Robert E. Lee when he died in 1870. Disgusted at what hecalled the “bombastic laudation” and the “nauseating flatteries” of the “rebelchief,” Douglass attacked the Lost Cause as a betrayal of the verdicts of thewar. “It would seem,” he wrote in a biting editorial, “that the soldier whokills the most men in battle, even in a bad cause, is the greatest Christian,and entitled to the highest place in heaven.” By early 1871, after so muchromance about Lee’s death and the sentiment that he had “died of a brokenheart,” Douglass expressed a precise verdict: “He was a traitor and can be madenothing else.”25 [notes02.html#ch24fn_25a]By intellectual predilection and by experience, Douglass embodied the idea thathistory mattered. The Douglass who endures as an unending subject of literaryand historical inquiry—because of the autobiographies—is and was the creature ofmemory. The very nature of memory provided a subject of obsessive interest. Hisplace as citizen Douglass, his own humanity, were products of his ability tocreate and record experience, to narrate his own story. Moreover, he knew thatpeoples and nations, like individuals, are shaped and defined by their pasts.Douglass was acutely aware that history was both burden and inspiration,something to be cherished and overcome. He also understood that although allpeople crave stories, some narratives are more honest than others. He knew thatall groups desire a usable past, none more than blacks in America. “It is notwell to forget the past,” Douglass warned in a speech later in the 1880s.“Memory was given to man for some wise purpose. The past is . . . the mirror inwhich we may discern the dim outlines of the future and by which we may makethem more symmetrical.” Douglass thus knew that history and memory are nevertruly symmetrical, but that he could still try to make them so.26[notes02.html#ch24fn_26a]The old abolitionist wrote and spoke so often about the fight over the memory ofthe war that some critics accused him of living in the past. American politicswould “leave Mr. Douglass behind . . . ,” declared one newspaper editor in 1872,“vociferating the old platitudes as though the world had stopped eight yearsago.” But to such critics, Douglass had ready answers: he would not forgive theSouth and he would never forget the meaning of the war as he saw it. At thefirst version of a tomb of the unknown soldier in Arlington Cemetery, on anearly official observance of Memorial Day (1871), Douglass declared where hestood in a speech that became a template for countless such memory addressesover the next two decades. In the presence of President Grant, Douglassperformed a moving and thoroughly nationalistic eulogy over the graves of someeleven hundred Union dead from the Bull Run battlefields of 1861 and 1862. Theunknown dead were themselves “a silent, subtle, and an all-pervading eloquence.”They had resisted slavery and disunion, and Douglass infused their meaning witha transcendent refrain: “They died for their country!” Borrowing then from Psalm137, he stated his unequivocal case on the heights of Arlington: “We aresometimes asked in the name of patriotism to forget the merits of this fearfulstruggle, and to remember with equal admiration those who struck at the nation’slife, and those who struck to save it—those who fought for slavery and those whofought for liberty and justice.” Douglass spoke across time and place to ourenduring national condition. “I am no minister of malice,” he said, “I would notrepel the repentant, but . . . may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if Iforget the difference between the parties to that . . . bloody conflict. . . . Imay say if this war is to be forgotten, I ask in the name of all things sacredwhat shall men remember?” Unlike the Fourth of July speech in 1852, Douglasscould now sing a song of Zion because he spoke not of a lost home in ruin, butfor a new Jerusalem. His people, he reasoned, had passed out of Babylon.27[notes02.html#ch24fn_27a]Douglass’s harsh reactions to the emerging Confederate memory were a revealingmeasure of his enduring attitudes toward the South as well as toward theresurgent Democratic Party. He licked his chops as a propagandist on one of hisfavorite subjects. The defeated white South felt only “bitter hatred to thegovernment of the North,” Douglass said in 1870. They had lost “the labor oftheir slaves and the right to control their actions.” Douglass not only showedno interest yet in any kind of sectional reconciliation, which Democratic Partypapers already demanded, he denounced Southerners as depraved and unworthy ofnational inclusion. Douglass enthusiastically waved the bloody shirt for hisparty. To him, Democrats were “the party of treason,” and in the midst of Klanviolence in 1871, he said he was “entitled to call the Democratic party a partyof murder, robbery, treason, dishonesty, and fraud.” When he was accused offanaticism against Southern Democrats, he said in effect thank you very much andargued that they did not deserve even “toleration.” “The South has a past not tobe contemplated with pleasure,” wrote Douglass, “but with a shudder. She hasbeen selling agony, trading in blood and the souls of men.” He even wrotearticles ridiculing the villages of Southern “poor white trash,” where people“cling” to “ignorance . . . many centuries behind every other civilizedcountry.” Whenever reconciliationist political gestures appeared, Douglassderided them as the “hand-clasping across the bloody chasm business.”28[notes02.html#ch24fn_28a]The New National Era provided Douglass a partisan sheet in which to venture intothe sectional and political fray. Just as he saw Reconstruction policy as adirect extension of the war’s basic issues, Douglass viewed party conflict inthe same way. To him, the Republican Party had been the author of emancipation,the embodiment of Union victory, and the custodian of black citizenship.Douglass considered the Republicans the only conceivable political home forblack voters. He looked upon elections as referenda on his party’s diligence insustaining black rights. In 1871, Douglass simplified American politics to acontest between good and evil: “There are but two parties in the country. One isthe party loyal to liberty, justice, and good order, and the other is the partyin sympathy with the defeated rebellion. . . . Between these two parties we haveno option.”29 [notes02.html#ch24fn_29a] Thus, Douglass embraced the tension ofmaintaining the radical-humanitarian vision of the Republican Party at the verytime it was beginning to wane.Douglass’s loyalty to the Republican Party during Reconstruction was undoubtedlyat times motivated by personal ambition and sustained by faulty analysis. He wasa paid stump speaker for Grant in 1872, and he sought office and influence. Inthis age of “spoilsmen” Douglass expected some return on his efforts. The NewYork Tribune attacked him for allegedly receiving large sums of money for hispro-Grant speeches. Douglass responded that he had received only $500 from theRepublican Party and $3,700 from literary societies during the lecture season ofthat past winter. His political work too was a venture; he labored hard forGrant. In August, Douglass informed one of his sons that he had just deliveredseven speeches for the campaign in one week in Maine.30[notes02.html#ch24fn_30a]Douglass’s rhetoric on behalf of Grant’s reelection and throughout the 1870sreflected a deeply held set of beliefs about recent history. He was fond ofreviving the passions of the war, putting them to the ends of justice. In 1870,he provided in his paper a list of “great truths” that the nation should neverforget: that the “Copperhead Democracy” had started the war “for the purpose ofextending and rendering perpetual the foul curse of slavery”; that in the war“these rebel Democrats slaughtered a quarter of a million brave loyal men”; that“they wounded and disabled a quarter of a million more”; that “they made full amillion of widows or orphans”; and that “these same rebel Democrats” nowdemanded that they be restored to power. By invoking these stark images,Douglass demonstrated that for him the bloody shirt appealed for more thanvotes; it meant that he was ready to play the role of grand master of Northernand national memory, offering an explicit refutation of the Confederate LostCause tradition. Democrats, Douglass warned with characteristic harshness, “arethe apostles of forgetfulness . . . and no wonder, for their pathway has beenstrewn with the whitened bones of their countrymen.”31 [notes02.html#ch24fn_31a]In the 1870s Douglass promoted and defended the Republican Party with persistentzeal. In his newspaper, he pledged fidelity to the Republicans. When necessary,he idealized the party’s recent history. With his sons Lewis and Charles,Douglass traveled the four hundred miles back to Rochester from Washington tovote in November 1870. Speaking to a turn-away crowd in City Hall, heentertained his hometown fans. Race was useful, as ever, for humor at suchpolitical events: “I am called here to give color to the occasion, and toprevent the whole thing from having the appearance of being ‘faded out.’ ” Hereminded his black listeners and readers that Republicans were their party ofhope. They might sometimes be “slighted” by Republicans, he cautioned, but theywere “murdered” by Democrats. To the disappointed, he insisted that the aims ofblacks could be “more easily accomplished inside than anywhere outside theRepublican party.”32 [notes02.html#ch24fn_32a] The old “antislavery tendency” ofRepublicans had been enough to gain his hope and allegiance back in the 1850s.Now in the 1870s, as Radical Republicanism showed signs of decline, a pragmaticDouglass clung to his only political home as the party of memory.Image [../images/f0534-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, April 26, 1870. George Francis Schreiber photographer, cartede visite.In the turbulent election of 1872, Douglass steadfastly supported Grant andvehemently denounced Horace Greeley and the Liberal Republican movement. What hemost objected to in the Liberals’ revolt was their hostility to Grant’s Southernpolicy, especially their desire for prompt sectional reconciliation. The LiberalRepublicans were a motley coalition driven by a complexity of motives, butespecially after their candidate—Greeley—joined hands with the Democratic Partyin the summer of 1872, Douglass viewed them as the worst of enemies. Their“chief topic,” Douglass argued in September, “is the clasping of hands acrossthe bloody chasm, the great love feast of reconciliation cooked by Mr. Greeley,on which occasion our southern brethren are indirectly promised the first seatsat the common table.” The welfare of the freedpeople, black equality, and thevery meaning of the war were at risk in Douglass’s conception of the LiberalRepublicans and their devil’s bargain with Democrats. “The fruits of ten yearsof labor, suffering and loss are at stake,” Douglass declared in a campaigneditorial. Loyal Republicans, he believed, should not be thrown off guard by“the deceitful cry that all the questions raised by the war . . . are nowsettled.” He warned his readers about the fragility of past victories: “Theslave demon still rides the southern gale and breathes out fire and wrath. . . .The smoldering embers of the Lost Cause show themselves in shouts for . . .Horace Greeley.”33 [notes02.html#ch24fn_33a]Douglass brooked no caution in attacking Greeley and the Liberal Republicans. Helikened them to the secessionists of 1861, calling them “sorehead bolters,” whoschemed politically for personal ends. When Greeley’s New York Tribune calledDouglass out for what they termed the “brutish ingratitude” and “malignantblackguardism” of his rhetoric, he shot back. Greeley’s odd political coalitionwould leave the Republicans “stabbed and slain . . . from behind.” The New YorkTimes seemed to enjoy seeing these old allies slashing each other to pieces inthe 1872 campaign. Douglass, the Times said, wrote with “sharp, vigoroussentences . . . the kind which at once take hold upon the memory and appeal tothe understanding.”34 [notes02.html#ch24fn_34a] Douglass enjoyed becoming a starpartisan journalist in 1872.The resurgent editor even expressed scorn for the Liberals’ condemnation ofcorruption in the Grant administration and lampooned their appeals for civilservice reform. He found these issues increasingly difficult to explain away,however, especially in the wake of the election when the Crédit Mobilier scandal(as part of the building of the transcontinental railroad) rocked theadministration. By 1874 Douglass wrote to Gerrit Smith describing the “moralatmosphere” in Washington as “rotten,” full of “avarice, duplicity . . .corruption . . . fawning and trickery of all kinds.” By then he dividedWashington politicians into two groups, “the class used” and the “class thatuses them,” and cynically declared himself one of the “used.” Douglassunderstood the system from personal experience. In 1873, he received a beggingletter from a desperate woman with a small child, asking his help in getting hera job in the Treasury Department. “Oh! Mr. Douglass if you could!” wrote a JuliaFoster Sagendorf. “If you only could . . . I will teach my child to worshipyou.” But in the heat of the 1872 campaign, Douglass defended Grant in languagehe surely regretted: there had “never been an administration since thegovernment existed . . . which could better endure the most searching scrutiny”on corruption.35 [notes02.html#ch24fn_35a]To Douglass, Grant represented the only hope of continuity with Union victory,emancipation, and the work of Reconstruction. “The Republican party cannot bebroken up at this juncture,” Douglass wrote to Cassius M. Clay, “without . . .putting in peril not only the freedmen of the South, but the honor and safety ofthe country.” So certain was Douglass that Republican disunity would lead to thedoom of black freedom and equality that he declared it “better to put a pistolto my head and blow my brains out, than to lend myself in any wise to thedestruction or defeat of the Republican party.” Douglass never knew Grant welland could hardly claim a place for Grant in the abolitionist tradition, butDouglass could still attempt to do so for the president’s party. It caused himno little pain to see the heroically antislavery Charles Sumner come out insupport of the Liberals due to personal hatred of Grant. Douglass greatlyadmired Sumner but took umbrage at the senator’s personal attacks on thepresident. “Personally, he is nothing to me,” Douglass wrote to Sumner, “but asthe President, the Republican President of the country, I am anxious . . . tohold him in all honor.”36 [notes02.html#ch24fn_36a] In 1872, Douglass and Sumnercast their votes against each other.Douglass embraced Grant in 1872 and beyond for a reason similar to his morerestrained endorsement of Lincoln in 1860—Grant was the candidate the South andthe resurgent Democrats feared most. He had moved effectively to defeat theKlan. Douglass had long ago learned that, politically, what white Southernersfeared and opposed, blacks ought to embrace. Hence he concluded his officialendorsement of Grant in 1872 by stating, “Long ago we adopted the maxim ‘neverto occupy ground which our enemies desired us to occupy’ if we could help it.”37[notes02.html#ch24fn_37a] Such a maxim tells us much about why Douglass’sloyalty to Republicans endured to the end of his days.• • •That loyalty was at times sorely tested. Douglass and Grant did work together onone important and complicated venture—American annexation of Santo Domingo.Ulysses Grant was an ardent expansionist. The prospect of drawing Santo Domingo(what became the Dominican Republic) into the United States was a majorpolitical crisis of his first term as president. The idea of Santo Domingo’sannexation predated Grant’s presidency. His motives and ethics, and especiallythose of some key aides, were mixed. Business and real estate interests as wellas the acquisition of a major Caribbean naval base for the US navy fueledpro-annexation sentiment. But Grant also saw Santo Domingo as a kind ofsafety-valve solution for the biggest problem of Reconstruction—Ku Klux violenceand the fate of millions of freedpeople in the South. He imagined Santo Domingoas a site of new relocation schemes for blacks. Grant did not advocate anylarge-scale colonization, but he and many others envisioned Santo Domingo, likeadjoining Haiti, as a black country, a place where African Americans couldchoose to make a new home.38 [notes02.html#ch24fn_38a]Grant’s great nemesis on Santo Domingo was Sumner, who was chairman of theSenate Foreign Relations Committee. Unlike many fellow Republicans, includingDouglass, who so greatly admired the Massachusetts abolitionist, Sumner rejectedall humanitarian explanations for annexation anywhere in the Caribbean. He sawthe effort as the ultimate destruction of a black nation, a fate that would alsoextend to Haiti. Sumner opposed annexation as blatant American imperialism andan abandonment of the domestic struggle to enforce Reconstruction racialpolicies in the South. In November 1869, Grant’s representative, his oldmilitary aide from the war years Orville Babcock, went to the island nation andnegotiated a treaty with the president of Santo Domingo, Buenaventura Báez, aninsecure ruler who was threatened by internal rivals and external pirates. Amajority of the US Senate favored the annexation agreement. But, especiallyunder Sumner’s powerful opposition, the measure never achieved the necessarytwo-thirds majority. The treaty was formally defeated in June 1870 and left apermanent, embittered rift between Grant and Sumner.39 [notes02.html#ch24fn_39a]The treaty’s failure also left Douglass in a quandary, since from the beginning,the new Washington resident favored American expansion to such regions occupiedand led by people of color. He had also supported the “free Cuba” movement in1869, when rebels launched resistance to Spanish rule that would grow into theTen Years’ War. Douglass joined other abolitionists in believing that the new,antislavery, post–Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments United States ought nowto export its victories over racial oppression. He was caught between the oldabolitionist he honored most (Sumner) and the president to whom he had pledgedloyalty.A great deal of political prestige within the Republican Party was at stake inthe Santo Domingo debate. Douglass played now for access, credibility, andstatus in high places. In every venture Douglass risked in the labyrinthinepolitics of Reconstruction, he had a package of values and assets to offer.Sometimes they led to success; often they did not. All of these values dependedin the end on a swirling universe of patronage and clientage. He did generallyremain an old abolitionist man of principles, especially in the demands he madeon the Republican Party. But Douglass’s assets were essentially his story, hisskill at the lectern, and, with his biting pen, his racial symbol, hisemblematic place in a reborn America, and above all his dignity. Just how hecould now balance firm beliefs and philosophies with old and new friendships,how he could achieve a place at the national table of power brokers and sustainhis vaunted dignity, would be the central challenge of his public life.40[notes02.html#ch24fn_40a] No black man in America had ever quite done this andlived to tell it.Grant revived the Santo Domingo initiative in December 1870 with explicit plansfor the purchase of the Samaná region, the peninsula that juts out from thenortheast coast of Hispaniola. Douglass took a special interest in the group ofAfrican Americans from Philadelphia who had emigrated in 1824 to Samaná. Theimmigrants had established an agricultural and religious community, and whenSanto Domingo won its independence from Haiti in 1844, they had opposed anattempt at annexation into the proslavery United States. But by the late 1860s,with the new United States, born of emancipation and the promise of blackequality, they were favorable to rejoining their former homeland. Sumnerbrutally counterattacked and delivered a speech in the Senate that accused Grantessentially of bullying his way into the Caribbean to forge an “imperial system”through a “dance of blood.” Sumner likened the scheme to a betrayal of blackliberty and rights. The attack on Grant seemed so vicious that Douglass wrote toSumner, declaring himself “embarrassed” to openly disagree with his “honored”friend. Douglass had been in the gallery of the Senate on December 21 whenSumner spoke, an experience Douglass considered both thrilling and shocking.“Candidly,” he judged his friend “bitterly severe” and wrong about the wholescheme of Santo Domingo expansion.41 [notes02.html#ch24fn_41a]Refusing to give up, Grant appointed a Commission of Inquiry to travel to SantoDomingo. The three commissioners were all prominent Republicans with solidantislavery credentials: former Ohio senator Benjamin Wade, social reformerSamuel Gridley Howe, and Cornell University president Andrew D. White. As a slapat Sumner and to reflect perhaps Grant’s own interests in the island, heappointed Douglass and former Union army general Franz Sigel to serve asassistant secretaries for the commission, under the lead secretary, Allan A.Burton. Since Douglass was appointed in a subordinate role, some grumblingoccurred publicly among blacks that the assignment was merely symbolic. In part,Grant was trying to neutralize Sumner’s power by appointing the senator’s closefriends Howe and especially Douglass, a longtime archenemy of colonizationschemes. The commission’s charge was to examine Santo Domingo’s political andeconomic conditions; to investigate land acquisitions; and to accumulatetestimony on whether the people of the island desired annexation. Douglass’srole was especially to visit and report on the people of Samaná.42[notes02.html#ch24fn_42a]For the large delegation with support staff and a dozen newspaper reporters, theeight-week mission to Santo Domingo aboard the navy warship USS Tennessee was aprofound experience. Since the 1840s, Douglass had always possessed a growinginternational consciousness, although with much greater interest in Europe andthe Caribbean than in Africa. He had expressed such a broadening outlook inAugust 1865 to a French editor, Melvil-Bloncourt, who had congratulated Douglasson the achievement of black freedom. “The cause of freedom and justice is as bigas the world,” Douglass wrote. “It is limited neither by countries nor byclimate, nor by color. Whoever cooperates with a good deed . . . is no longer astranger, but a compatriot, a man of the same family, an ally, a dearbrother.”43 [notes02.html#ch24fn_43a] The old abolitionist accustomed toactivism from outside the circles of power now became an insider assisting ascheme to take over another country justified by refurbished nationalism andclaims of a new racial vision of equality.The commission left New York on January 17, 1871. Douglass kept a sporadic diarythat began on the day before departure as the delegation assembled at thefashionable Astor House hotel on Broadway between Vesey and Barclay Streets.Charles Douglass accompanied his father on the voyage in the official role of“messenger.” In the elder Douglass’s absence, Frederick Jr. reported himself incharge of the “business management” of the New National Era, and his brotherLewis served as editor. Ottilie Assing may have contributed articles as wellduring the two-month absence, and she vicariously imagined herself once againinto the center of Douglass’s public life. “I would have loved to join him, butonly men were going, and so it was impossible,” she wrote to her sister.44[notes02.html#ch24fn_44a] Such comments in private letters that only Ludmillaever saw point to the sad naïveté at the heart of Ottilie’s life with herbeloved Douglass. At least she had her sister with whom to share her fantasy.Charles became sick along with many others on the second day at sea, but after aweek they reached the Bay of Samaná, where the commission was “received kindlyby the people.” Douglass was stunned at the beauty of this tropical-islanduniverse, the deep ocean bay and the mountains by the interior. From January 24to 29, he served as chief interrogator of the English-speaking residents. Healso delivered a formal speech in front of a large gathering on January 28,depicted in a drawing in Frank Leslie’s Illustrated in March. Douglass is shownon a high platform with his whitened hair; the blacks represented tend to bebarefoot. The official report of the commission showed that Douglass questionedresidents about the colony’s population (nearly eight hundred), and basiceconomic and social conditions. At every stop the commission asked explicitlywhat residents thought of annexation. In Samaná, Douglass elicited that theywere “tired of war” and political chaos. They were not afraid of any takeoverfrom Haiti, but greatly feared a recurring strongman who puts himself “at thehead of a revolution . . . brings on war . . . and plunders the people of theirproperty.” The resounding answer among the Samaná settlers seemed to be, yes,they needed the United States as “a strong government to lean against forprotection.”45 [notes02.html#ch24fn_45a]Predisposed toward annexation, the commission may have tended to hear what itwanted to hear; but it did encounter a great deal of pro-annexation sentiment.In his diary, Douglass recorded some passages that ended up in the officialreport. “Can’t be worse off than they are,” he wrote. On the last day in Samaná,Douglass spent considerable time walking along the beach with an old man, Mr.Dichmain, who had been a settler there for sixty years. He listened to the man’stales of Toussaint and Christophe, the Haitian Revolution, and the atrocitiescommitted “under the first Nap” (Napoléon Bonaparte). In parting, Douglass tookup a collection of $64 among the commissioners and journalists for the Samanásettlers to support repairs on their church. The Tennessee then steamed for twodays around the east end of the island and arrived at the capital city, SantoDomingo, on January 31. For three weeks the commission made the capital itsheadquarters. Some excursions occurred to interview people in the interior,where the diarist reported “people . . . everywhere raising the American flag.”Given his limited role, Douglass had a great deal of time for sightseeing andstudy. He worked on learning Spanish and demonstrated a particular fascinationwith any place or relic associated with Christopher Columbus, including an oldhouse said to be that of the mariner as well as the castle-prison where he wasconfined and died. Douglass liked the hot weather and wrote about numerousexcursions to the beach, “bathing in the surf.” One such outing turned dangerouswhen the fifty-three-year-old Douglass stepped out too far “among therocks . . . was handled very roughly by a heavy wave,” and found himself “muchbruised and . . . near being swept off to the sharks.”46[notes02.html#ch24fn_46a]Image [../images/f0541-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass on the deck of the USS Tennessee, Key West, Florida, January17, 1871. Oliver B. Buell photographer.There were many “dull” days for the assistant secretary when all he could recordwas that Charley was “winning golden opinions for his penmanship.” But on aSunday he reported seeing his first “cock fight,” which left a revolting andlasting impression. By the end of February, the commission was back aboard shipand steamed to Port-au-Prince, the capital of Haiti. Douglass logged that thehistoric city looked beautiful and “cheerful” from the bay, but once theylanded, up close it looked “sadder, houses inferior, streets dirty, peopledepressed in spirit.” Douglass recorded meeting the US minister to Haiti, theAfrican American Ebenezer D. Bassett, but then had nothing more to say about afull week in Haiti. Nor, frustratingly, did he report anything in the diaryabout some five days the commission spent in port at Kingston, Jamaica. Thediary ends as Douglass observed “the first breath of reviving N air” along thecoast of slaveholding Cuba.47 [notes02.html#ch24fn_47a] The Tennessee went intoport briefly in both Key West, Florida, and Charleston, South Carolina, on itsjourney to Washington. At Charleston, the delegation boarded a train for thetrip northward; Douglass left no written impression of his first view of thecity of secession.As the commission’s highly publicized mission ended, Douglass experienced twoacts of Jim Crow snubbing. When the delegation reached Aquia Creek, Virginia,they took a Potomac River steamer to Washington; as they gathered for anafternoon dinner on board, the ship captain refused to allow Douglass to beserved with his colleagues. Howe, Wade, and White all protested and refused thecaptain’s table. Soon after arrival in the capital, President Grant invited thecommissioners to the White House for dinner; again, Douglass was not among theguests invited. The loyal Douglass remained largely silent in the ensuing monthsabout these incidents. But as the political season heated up in 1872, Sumnerrepeatedly made an issue of the alleged ill treatment of Douglass by Grant. Thecommissioners themselves, particularly White, came to Grant’s defense, stressingthat in all the time aboard the Tennessee and in Santo Domingo, Douglass hadfrequently dined at the captain’s table. Racial rejections of this kind cutDouglass to the bone, but he kept his sense of humor. A year later, as the issueremained controversial, he wrote to Gerrit Smith about the oddity of his newfame merely because he “was not invited to dine.” He did admit that he wishedGrant had personally issued a “reproof” for the “insult” on the Potomac by thesteamer captain. Douglass was “so used to being snubbed, and receiving insultsbecause of my color,” though, that he gave Grant a pass, since he had not been“educated in the Gerrit Smith school.”48 [notes02.html#ch24fn_48a]• • •Jim Crow dining habits notwithstanding, Douglass went to his desk and out on thespeaking circuit as a steadfast proponent of annexation. It is never easy to bea good imperialist, but the old abolitionist did his best. Douglass wrote toSecretary of State Hamilton Fish on April 3, 1871, declaring his work for thecommission finished and, somewhat oddly, “regretting that my services . . . wereinconsiderable and unimportant.” But within a month, Douglass was on the railslecturing on behalf of Santo Domingo statehood. Annexation failed again to gettwo-thirds support in the Senate, but not because Douglass did not do his partto sway public opinion. He advanced a refurbished Manifest Destiny for a newera, and he saw no reason to limit expansion to one part of Hispaniola. “Thenatural thing for Hayti, Cuba, and for all the islands of the Caribbean Sea,” hewrote in May 1871, “is to come as soon as possible under the broad banner of theUS, and conform themselves to the grand order of progress upon which this greatRepublic has now . . . earnestly entered.”49 [notes02.html#ch24fn_49a]Douglass treated audiences to romantic descriptions of “intoxicating” sea air inthe islands, and the “verdure of perpetual summer.” Frequently, he invoked hismemory of standing “where Columbus first stood” and breathing “the American airthat Columbus first breathed.” Santo Domingo was at heart a “civilization . . .so feeble,” so materially “desolated,” that it needed an American “restoringhand.” It is too easy to merely dismiss Douglass’s support of such animperialist venture as mere opportunism; he did openly desire a presidentialappointment. William Lloyd Garrison joined the chorus accusing Douglass ofpersonal aggrandizement. “Of course, Frederick Douglass favors the measure, andalready has his reward,” Garrison wrote to Sumner. “It is not the first time hisambition and his selfishness have led him astray.” But the contexts for hisadvocacy of annexation are much broader than individual ambition.50[notes02.html#ch24fn_50a]At times Douglass could sound like a standard-issue imperialist for Americansuperiority. Only “for the sake of . . . isolated” Santo Domingo should theUnited States bring the struggling country into the Union, said the editor. “Wewould make her the black sister of Massachusetts, and transplant within hertropical borders the glorious institutions which have lifted that grand oldcommonwealth to her present commanding elevation.” Before 1865, Douglass couldnever have uttered such tranquil pieties about America. He insisted on atattered faith in America’s democratic promise even as he had earlier deliveredsome of the most ferocious denunciations of slaveholding hypocrisy. But the warand emancipation had crushed the first nation, and emancipation followed by thethree constitutional amendments had given birth to the second. “Things havechanged,” Douglass announced in 1871 with Yankee superiority. “The Republic whensmitten with contagious disease and death could not be confined within limitstoo narrow” he declared; “but now that she is healthy and life giving, shecannot extend too far. The whole continent is not too large for the fullillustration of the ideas . . . with which it is her mission to bless theworld.” Douglass believed he had sailed to Santo Domingo aboard a ship flying“the flag . . . I could now call mine.” Annexation was a clear ideologicalmarker to him “between the old time and the new.”51 [notes02.html#ch24fn_51a]Douglass saw Reconstruction’s egalitarian promises—the end of slavery, equalitybefore law, birthright citizenship, and the right to vote—as catalysts andjustifications of American expansion. A new America—the new Jerusalem—presenteditself to the world. It was now to be the living experiment in racial equalityand it ought to export the verdicts of Appomattox, the blood-won liberty of FortWagner, section one of the Fourteenth Amendment, and abolitionism itself in astill slaveholding and oppressive world. He may have expressed these sentimentsmost hopefully in the speech “Composite Nation,” which was the template of hisnumerous editorials and many dozens of addresses about Santo Domingo from 1870into 1873. A reborn America now embodied a romantic missionary nationalism andoffered a melting pot open to all. As a political liberal, Douglass made hiscase for the second United States as the model for “human rights” above allconceptions of racial or ethnic identities. The mission of his new nation, hedeclared, was to provide the world a “composite . . . perfect illustration ofthe unity and dignity of the human family.” Since he saw the Fifteenth Amendmentas merely a beginning for a new political age, he hoped annexation of SantoDomingo would bring thousands of new black voters into the United States.52[notes02.html#ch24fn_52a]From April to June 1871 in the New National Era, Douglass wrote a series ofseven pro-annexation essays. He expressed detailed interest in the economicdevelopment of Santo Domingo, naming “timber, dye woods, sugar, coffee, cotton,and indigo” as products worthy of American commerce. Douglass was, after all,becoming a real estate investor in Washington, and though he never said soexplicitly, he may have entertained some inclination to land speculation. Hepraised the fertility of the island: “The land was rich but the people poor.”They lacked the “comforts and conveniences of civilized life,” and the UnitedStates could deliver them. As to the anti-imperialist logic of the opposition,he asked why a country that had annexed “Louisiana, Texas, California, andAlaska, and who are for annexing Mexico and Canada in good time,” should be soreticent about the Caribbean.53 [notes02.html#ch24fn_53a]Douglass blatantly rejected the arguments used by critics (including Sumner)about black people belonging in southern climatic zones and whites to thenorthern latitudes. Even more vehemently he denounced the open racism ofanti-annexation voices who simply did not want any more black people in America.Douglass rather admired the mixed racial people he had seen on the island, andhe welcomed ways Santo Domingo might darken the nation. Always under suspicionand criticism from other black leaders, a proud Douglass pushed back at his“reverend friend” Henry Highland Garnet, who openly accused Douglass of beingPresident Grant’s lackey in the Santo Domingo commission. The editor consideredGarnet a leader among those who “may ever be expected to promptly take sidesagainst almost any subject or measure it is my fortune to advocate.” Garnet evenaccused Douglass of viewing the Haitians as an “inferior race” to theDominicans. With great resentment, Douglass denied the charge and declared hisadmiration equal to his accuser’s for the “truly heroic struggles of Hayti forfreedom and independence.” He said Dominicans had asked for annexation andHaitians had not. In a public letter, Douglass drew a stark line: “Mr. Garnetshall not find me joining with all the negro-haters and murderers of the coloredrace in opposing the measure. Santo Domingo is opposed mainly, if not wholly,because her people are not white. If they were of the pure caucasion race allparties would jump at the acquisition.” Such public spats only demonstrated thatblacks could attack each other as well as white Democrats duringReconstruction.54 [notes02.html#ch24fn_54a]Douglass was not as tolerant or ecumenical about the religion he saw practicedamong the Dominicans; the country suffered from too much “superstition andCatholic religion,” he wrote, and needed more Protestant “sober monitions ofreason.” Douglass’s anti-Catholicism could raise its head at any time,especially when abroad. He ended his series of essays with the encompassingmoral claim that Americans should want Santo Domingo as a state because it would“enable us better to discourage slavery and promote the freedom of mankind.” Heseemed fully aware of the irony that on the largest point ofcontention—race—both sides of the debate agreed for completely differentreasons.55 [notes02.html#ch24fn_55a]• • •In 1874, Douglass risked yet one more venture that failed swiftly on his watch.No other experience left him with “a feeling of humiliation,” he candidlyadmitted, as much as his ill-considered presidency of the Freedmen’s Savings andTrust Company (known as Freedmen’s Bank). On the same day as it created theFreedmen’s Bureau, March 3, 1865, Congress chartered the bank. Rooted initiallyin an effort to help black soldiers save some of their wages, the bank quicklybecame a savings and loan institution primarily for freedmen and their families.Its primary founder, John Alvord, a Congregational minister, abolitionist, andfirst superintendent of education for the Freedmen’s Bureau, assembledapproximately twenty wealthy philanthropists in New York and launched whatbecame for blacks and their allies one of the most popular initiatives ofReconstruction. The bank moved to Washington, DC, in 1867, seemed to flourish,and established branches in cities all over the South. By 1871, the Bank couldboast thirty-seven branches in seventeen states and the District of Columbia.56[notes02.html#ch24fn_56a]A board of trustees of some fifty mostly white men operated the bank, althoughby the early 1870s only a dozen or so who lived in Washington attended meetingsor assessed the institution’s loan portfolios. Douglass became a trustee soonafter moving to the capital, but admitted that his function at meetings wasmerely “the pleasure of listening to rapid reports.” The bank built amagnificent five-story building at 1507 Pennsylvania Avenue, within viewingdistance of the White House. Douglass described the interior as beautifully“finished with black walnut and furnished with marble counters and all themodern improvements.” Black freedom and wealth, the stunning brownstone seemedto announce, had come to stay at the heart of American power. Where thousands ofrefugee escaped slaves had gathered in the streets and in makeshift contrabandcamps during the war, they could now take their meager wages to the well-dressedblack tellers with pencils behind their ears beneath the fancy light fixtures ofthe building named for them. The bank ultimately counted approximately $57million in total deposits from nearly seventy thousand depositors. Thosedepositors hailed from all corners of the nation; some deposited from $1 to $5,some eventually much more. Douglass’s sons were occasional depositors.57[notes02.html#ch24fn_57a]With missionary zeal, the promotional literature of the bank portrayed theenterprise as a thoroughly national institution. Passbooks included images ofAbraham Lincoln and broken shackles, William T. Sherman, and other Uniongenerals. One pamphlet fervidly promised, “The whole institution is under thecharter of Congress, and received the commendation and countenance of thesainted Abraham Lincoln.” Depositors were told that their money was trusted to“some of the best men” in the land, and that legally and financially they wereon the same footing with all other Americans. The federal government monetarilybacked the bank, or so it seemed. But financially, the bank was private and notguaranteed by the Treasury Department, which was located across the street fromthe ornate headquarters. Under such misleading impressions, the bank flooded thefreedpeople with advice literature exhorting, “No one of you need remain poor ifyou are careful and do not spend money for candy or whiskey or costly clothes.”Freed men were especially urged to avoid tobacco and whiskey. The Bankcalculated that abstinence from cigars and whiskey would garner each man“$31.20” in annual savings.58 [notes02.html#ch24fn_58a]But events and bad management overwhelmed the dream. In 1873 an economicdepression hit the United States like no previous one. The midcentury railroadboom ground to a halt, the stock market crashed, and by late 1874, nearly halfthe iron furnaces in the nation had shut down. The Panic of 1873 brought aboutthe failure of some ten thousand businesses over the next four years. Widespreadunemployment swept through all of America’s industrializing cities, the price ofall major agricultural products plummeted, and violent labor unrest exploded incountless places. The panic soon had profound implications for the fate ofReconstruction. In the winter and spring 1874, the Freedmen’s Bank fell intodeep trouble, although its leadership seemed only marginally aware of thedanger. Over time the institution had issued an array of bad loans and madeill-advised investments that its board had hardly scrutinized. Many of its whitetrustees had long abandoned ship, and in some of the branches, such as inAtlanta, cashiers were caught up in embezzlement. A group of seven or eightactive black trustees, led by Charles B. Purvis, the chief surgeon at Freedmen’sHospital and a professor of medicine at Howard University, and John MercerLangston, the law professor, led an effort in March to depose Alvord aspresident. As a means of restoring confidence, they hoped, Purvis became firstvice president and Langston chairman of the Finance Committee. Then the board,in a divided vote (Langston opposed), asked Douglass, because he was the mostprestigious of all black Americans, to be the new president.59[notes02.html#ch24fn_59a]Among all the younger, formally educated black leaders who tried to knock theking of the hill off his heights, Langston had been perhaps the most aggressive,their rivalry already many years old. Charles often sent his father Washingtongossip about how Langston was “trying to build himself up in running you down.”The professor would leave “no stone unturned to cripple . . . your popularity.”Dignity and duty prevailed over good sense; Douglass stepped into a poisonedsituation in more ways than one. In March he found “himself seated in acomfortable arm chair, with gold spectacles on my nose,” as president of theFreedmen’s Bank. Douglass took the job, he admitted, over the stern objectionsof his daughter and, without her saying them publicly, of Ottilie Assing. Sheaccused him of a naïveté, but also a certain spinelessness, since his adultchildren had, in her view, never learned “to stand on their own two feet”financially. Douglass obviously knew his role was to instill faith by hispresence. Never had his well-starched dignity seemed so important as now. Butnever would his fame prove so useless, even damaging. During the 1870s Douglasswore white shirts with both Douglass in his own handwriting and an Englishscript D in red specially monogrammed on the high collars. Coming close toself-satire in his remembrance of the bank episode, he could not resistmentioning the contrast of “the slave boy running about Col. Lloyd’s with only atow linen shirt” and now the “president” counting “assets by millions.” Heconfessed that these “golden dreams” were painfully unreal.60[notes02.html#ch24fn_60a]Soon after taking over the job, Douglass expressed all the necessary optimismrequired of him. He provided an object for symbolic veneration and the languageof uplift and hope. But banking acumen, he freely admitted, he did not possess.He promised on March 30, 1874, to “look deeper than I have yet been able to do”into the bank’s problems, and, above all, that he would operate with “absolutehonesty” and in “no sympathy with Mr. Langston’s idea that now is a good time towind up the concern.” But two months later he reported to his son-in-law,Nathan, that he felt himself “in a hard place in this Freedmen’s Bank and shallconsider myself fortunate if I get out of it as easily as I got into it.”Douglass felt anxious to get back to his “literary work which I should havenever abandoned.” A comptroller’s report in March indicated a huge deficit inthe bank’s holdings. Many branches were highly unprofitable, and the bank movedto close them, which in turn caused panic and wild runs on the local offices.The Democratic Party press viciously attacked the bank as part of the failure ofRadical Reconstruction as well as a demonstration of African Americanincompetence. Some in the black press, such as the Christian Recorder, thenational organ of the AME Church, tried to shore up faith by pointing toDouglass himself, who “superabounds in . . . well preserved character.” But asthe historian Benjamin Quarles aptly remarked, only fools “believed that thepresence of Douglass at a glass top desk was superior to the working of economiclaw.”61 [notes02.html#ch24fn_61a]Douglass loaned $10,000 of his own money to the bank as a show of confidence.But in late May he testified to the US Senate that he advised the closure of theinstitution in the hope that the government might help make good some percentageof the depositors’ savings. He then curiously changed course in a last-ditchpublic circular on June 25, in which he argued for saving the bank exclusivelyfor black depositors. The circular beamed with race pride, and an embittereddeclaration that “no people can well rise to a high degree of mental or evenmoral excellence without wealth.” Blacks would continue to be “dependent anddespised” unless they forged a “wealthy class.” Four days later, though, withmuch public confusion, the bank’s board voted 11–1 to close. Congressionalcommittees continued to monitor the long process of attempted reimbursement ofdepositors for the next forty-five years. But when it closed doors in July, andDouglass stepped back into his life with lasting scars, the bank owed $2,993.79on 61,144 accounts.62 [notes02.html#ch24fn_62a]The affair ranks as one of the great aspirations, but also genuine racialtragedies, of Reconstruction. The bank could likely have been rescued had themoral and political will existed in the Congress, especially among thefreedmen’s friends, to underwrite the debts and payments run up by badmanagement. But the Republican Party had already changed its bearings, and inthe fall 1874 congressional elections it would be overthrown by the Democratsfor the first time since before the Civil War. Douglass’s $10,000 was eventuallyrepaid, but most depositors never saw much more than sixty cents on theirdollar.63 [notes02.html#ch24fn_63a] The black farmers, washerwomen, ministers,draymen, and general jobbers who had opened their meager accounts and proudlycarried passbooks had not made the hapless investments in badly managedconstruction firms, nor in the hopelessly corrupt Union Pacific or NorthernPacific Railroads. They were the ultimate victims of this debacle whencapitalism and racism ground down a jewel of a good idea into dust.In Douglass’s assessment of his short and disastrous whirl with the bank, heboth took responsibility and flung blame all around. The experience was a rudeawakening for the man who had striven so hard to get to the center of Americanpolitical life. “The truth is, I have neither taste or talent for the place [thebank],” he admitted in June, as he acknowledged the firm was not sound. But inhis estimation he had inherited and not created the situation. In early 1875,Douglass wrote to Oliver O. Howard in agony and disgust, “I never was so imposedupon by any concern in my life. It is bad enough to plunder the rich. It isworse to plunder the poor . . . under the disguise of Christian philanthropy.”In Life and Times, he wrote with both self-deprecation and anger. He confessedthat three months at the bank made him reconsider his view of “human nature.”Some of those nattily attired young black clerks, “adorned with pens andbouquets,” he implied, had been stealing money. He blamed both the largersociety’s deep-seated racism as well as his fellow trustees, black and white,who pushed him to take the post. The bank had served, he told Gerrit Smith, as“the black man’s cow, but the white man’s milk.” He knew he had been in over hishead, but insisted that he “did not know what I should have been told” by thebank’s governors. Douglass was criticized a great deal in the press and ininvestigations of the bank’s failure. But “the fact is,” he wrote, “and allinvestigation shows it, that I was married to a corpse.”64[notes02.html#ch24fn_64a]• • •For Douglass and his family enterprises, 1874 was a terrible year. Hard on theheels of the failure of the bank, the New National Era, long losing subscribers,went under. In its last months, as in many earlier periods, Douglass had leftits management to Lewis and Frederick Jr. On May 30, Douglass painfully informedSprague, whose bulging family remained dependent on the father-in-law, that “theboys are struggling manfully to keep their paper afloat.” He hoped they wouldnot have to let their “paper fail, but I fear they will have to.” By October,Douglass’s last newspaper closed its doors, and his two sons were again lookingfor work. The elder Douglass estimated that he had lost approximately $10,000 onthe enterprise. He had once again lost his personal literary mouthpiece. From asearly as March 1874, Lewis and Frederick Jr. were in court repeatedly, sued bycreditors, whom they sued in return over the finances of the paper. The Douglassbrothers had established a firm called the Colored Citizen Publishing Company;several black Washingtonians sued for pay never received for services asassociate editors. After numerous injunctions, a judge threw the cases out ofcourt, leaving bad feelings aimed at the Douglass clan for years to come.65[notes02.html#ch24fn_65a]In these sobering circumstances, Douglass found himself retreating to his houseon A Street, a rather exhausted man wondering where next to turn. On September1, 1874, on a fragment of paper, he penned a note of advice to an unnamedrecipient, perhaps indeed to himself: “There is for men and women no happinesswithout venture.”66 [notes02.html#ch24fn_66a] He had ventured so much in thelast several years, with considerable financial and political loss. His spiritsin near collapse, Douglass would, as previously, forge a robust recovery; someof his greatest literary, political, and symbolic work lay ahead."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 25--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WHAT WILL PEACE AMONG THE WHITES BRING?The signs of the times are not all in our favor. There are, even in theRepublican party, indications of a disposition to get rid of us.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, JULY 5, 1875By 1875, Frederick Douglass felt adrift, frustrated, and angry. Personal lossesand professional failures of recent years had left him floundering and searchingfor footing in the quicksand of Washington politics. Once again without anewspaper, a job, or other forms of livelihood apart from itinerant oratory, heobserved with fear the unraveling of Reconstruction from under the feet of hispeople. Douglass’s abiding loyalty to the Republican Party and a Grantadministration fraught with corruption felt more unstable than ever. Hisdaughter’s family continued to grow as it needed his largesse. His three sonsonce more struggled for meaningful employment in the extended economicdepression; Charles especially was helplessly in debt. Grandchildren, siblings,and various other adoptees to the extended family all needed his help. Anna’shealth was not stable as she entered her sixties. Across the South, all but fourof the former Confederate states had been “redeemed” by the Democratic Party;white mob violence surged again, stalking and murdering the freedmen. The man ofwords fell back upon his old weapon, but with a contradictory anguishreminiscent of the late 1850s.Throughout 1874–75, Douglass followed closely the Democratic Party’scounterrevolution of white supremacy in the South as well as its takeover of theUS Congress. He now lived in a capital with a scandal-ridden Republicanpresident and with Democrats, whom Douglass still identified with slavery, theConfederacy, and the Klan, running the House of Representatives. Grant-eracorruption normally involved businesses making payments to public officials forfavors, contracts, and vast amounts of railroad land. Cries for civil service“reform” coming from within the Republican ranks stemmed from both moralembarrassment and political fear. Indictments and acquittals, as well as thebrazen corruption of congressmen, cabinet secretaries, or vice presidents,replaced the fate of Reconstruction in the headlines.1 [notes02.html#ch25fn_1a]With Americans deflected from Southern and racial questions by economicdepression, the fall congressional elections of 1874 were a disaster forRepublicans. Overnight, the House of Representatives went from a Republicanmajority of 110 to a Democratic majority of 60. “The Republican Party Struck byLightning!” read a typical headline, even in that party’s own papers. Inthirty-five states holding elections, twenty-three were won by Democrats.Southern Democrats especially rejoiced; they now had a right to believe, as oneTennessee politician said, that this had not been an election at all, but “thecountry coming to a halt and changing front. . . . The whole scheme ofreconstruction stands before the country today a naked, confessed, stupendousfailure.” Grant’s secretary of state, Hamilton Fish, declared Republicans “soflat on our backs, that we can only be looking up.” A worried Douglass took tothe road wherever invited, warning desperately of a forgetful, money- andblood-drenched “peace” that seemed to be taking over the body politic. Hedemanded from a New Hampshire crowd in early 1875 “not a peace which rested onone man’s standing on the neck of another, but a peace which arises out of equaljustice and equal rights to all.”2 [notes02.html#ch25fn_2a] Just what kind ofpeace might unfold in America became for Douglass a central theme during theremainder of Reconstruction and beyond.• • •Douglass knew the fragility of his words and feared for the future of the causeof his life. He was left to watch more than fight, as the Fourteenth andFifteenth Amendments crumbled to dust in the face of armed white resistance. Heespecially felt shocked at the reports of intimidation and terror perpetratedagainst blacks in elections in various Southern states. In August 1874,resurgent Democrats in Alabama used an array of coercion, targetedassassinations, and, in one instance in Eufaula in Barbour County, the murder ofseven blacks and the wounding of some seventy more on Election Day to defeat analready divided Republican interracial coalition. In Mobile, blacks were drivenfrom polls by white mobs, and in other places ballot boxes were burned. InSeptember 1874 in New Orleans, in the “Battle of Liberty Place,” a throng ofthirty-five hundred “White Leaguers,” composed largely of Confederate veterans,drove black militiamen and Metropolitan Police away from official buildings andtook over city hall, the statehouse, and an arsenal. Stunned by this uprising,President Grant, who had been reluctant to take such federal action in thestates, ordered US troops to the city to restore order. But order and Republicanrule did not last long in Louisiana either. Across the North, sentiment now ranagainst such federal interventions. A retreat from Reconstruction among whiteNortherners sent slow waves of fear through black communities. Indeed,assertions of states’ rights, as well as the idea that the South should be leftalone to solve its problems, poured forth now even from Republicans.3[notes02.html#ch25fn_3a]Mississippi produced the worst violence of all. Municipal and county electionsin and around Vicksburg in August–September 1874 pitted “White League Clubs”(Democrats) against a weakening Republican Party, led by the Northern-bredgovernor Adelbert Ames. Grant refused for too long to intervene in Mississippi,and by fall some three hundred blacks had been killed in political terrorthroughout the countryside. In 1875 statewide election campaigns white vigilantemobs attacked and shot people with impunity in broad daylight. The Democrats’“Mississippi Plan” used intimidation as well as murder to keep blacks from thepolls in several key black belt counties. Grant’s inaction left Ames’sgovernment on its own to face the crisis; Ames was forced to resign and leavethe state in what amounted to a violent coup d’état. The one surviving blackRepublican from Mississippi in Congress, John Roy Lynch, said that the resultsof the armed white-supremacist revolt in his state meant that “the war wasfought in vain.” Ames called it a “revolution . . . by force of arms—and arace . . . disfranchised [and] returned to . . . an era of second slavery.”4[notes02.html#ch25fn_4a]Sickened, Douglass observed the bloodshed and political transformation somewhathelplessly from afar. National press coverage confirmed that Southern violencehad won the day inasmuch as even Republican editors denounced further federalaction in the South. The New York Evening Post held that “no political quackmedicines such as federal interference or military protection” would do anygood, since when troops were removed, mob violence would only begin again. TheWashington National Republican offered only benign resignation: “Northern peoplehave lost all interest in the welfare of colored Southern Republicans.”5[notes02.html#ch25fn_5a]Image [../images/f0554-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, January 26, 1874. John Howe Kent photographer.Outraged, Douglass responded in early February 1875 with a public letter to theNational Republican. Ten years after Appomattox he declared himself in favor ofthe “bonds of peace” and against fanning the flames of “sectional hostility.”However, Douglass identified “two kinds of peace.” One peace lived by a “justrespect . . . for the rights of all.” To describe the other peace, he returnedto the old prison metaphors of his earliest autobiography. That second kind ofpeace, said a furious Douglass, “arises out of the relation of slavery, a peacethat may be seen and felt in a prison . . . a peace where the heels of one classare on the necks of another.” The old radical found his voice again. A group ofblack leaders in Washington had been accused of incendiary rhetoric by somenewspapers for their resolutions protesting white Southern violence. “Theserpent may hiss,” wrote the old editor, “the crushed worm may turn, the wildbeast may warn the hunter of dangerous pursuit, but you, colored man, must notsay that there is even a possibility of danger to the midnight riders andmurderers by whom you are slaughtered, lest our saying so will be considered asan invitation to a war of races.” Douglass must have felt as though it were thelate 1840s again, when he was accused of being a black demagogue denouncing hiscountry. This time, though, his fame and friendships were so widespread that hegarnered some admiration for his spirited protests. Some papers published aportrait of Douglass as the “first man of his race.” The Rochester Expressapplauded the public letter, announcing, “Douglass was never more needed by hispeople than now” as their champion.6 [notes02.html#ch25fn_6a]In nearly a dozen speeches in New Hampshire in winter 1875, anticipating acongressional and gubernatorial election there in March, Douglass attacked thenational retreat from Reconstruction. He used bloody-shirt language to drawaudiences back to the war, to the “mourning, distress, and desolation” they hadendured on home fronts and battlefronts. As Union soldier monuments had begun toappear on town greens, he gave patriotic New Englanders their due credit foranswering the “hour of battle and danger.” Huge crowds in Lancaster, Manchester,and Concord applauded him for such tributes. To the constitutional argumentagainst “centralization” advanced by opponents of Reconstruction, Douglass hadready answers. Democrats had never shied away from using federal military powerwhen the object was returning fugitive slaves, or handing over John Brown to beexecuted. He wondered why if the “American people could stand centralization forslavery,” they could not also “stand centralization for liberty.” As for thecharges that the new Civil Rights Act pending in the Senate (eventually passedin honor of Charles Sumner) might advance “social equality” between whites andblacks, Douglass exploited the reality of racial mixture: “What is socialequality? They had a great deal of it where I came from. A great deal of thesocial, but no equality.” Two races arrived in North America in the earlyseventeenth century, said Douglass, one on the Mayflower at Plymouth, and theother on a “Dutch galliot . . . at Jamestown.” At that time there were no“intermediate races,” but now, two and a half centuries later, because ofslavery and long-practiced “social inequality there had come a million and ahalf of intermediates.” His roaring Yankee audiences loved the joke. As for theelection, a vote for Republicans meant protection for blacks, and a vote forDemocrats meant more “dripping blood of my people.”7 [notes02.html#ch25fn_7a]Increasingly, Douglass found himself speaking at commemorative gatherings,probing the meaning of memory in this time of embittered nationalreconciliation. He was especially effective at calling his fellow abolitionistsback to their story of greatness. In Philadelphia in April 1875, Douglass shareda platform with many old colleagues and rivals at the hundredth anniversary ofAmerica’s oldest antislavery organization, the Pennsylvania Society forPromoting the Abolition of Slavery. He marveled at the uniqueness of acentennial celebration in such a young country, comparing the old abolitionists’modest gathering to the anticipated centennial of the United States to occur thefollowing year. He claimed for his fellow reformers a “higher, broader, and moresacred” purpose. Because of the unraveling of Reconstruction, Douglass put causeabove country: the “Centennial of Seventy-Six stands for patriotism; ours standsfor philanthropy.” The nation’s anniversary was “transient,” the abolitionists’crusade “permanent.” Douglass insisted that he and his colleagues, black andwhite, survey a century of epic change in ending slavery and proudly tell theworld that they had led “the noblest cause in modern history.” Generations laterhistorians would agree.8 [notes02.html#ch25fn_8a]Douglass could soar in these commemorative moments; he made audiences all butforget dire present circumstances and dream again. He refused to countenance“talk of the dead past.” To him, “no part of the past is dead or indifferent.”He took up the great nineteenth-century abstraction of human progress, askingwhether such a thing really existed. To the naysayers, he offered withexclamation the abolitionists’ story: “There is no more impressive contradictionthan in the history of the antislavery cause. I know of no one period of theworld’s age for which I would be willing to exchange the present.” To buttressthe idea of progress, Douglass held aloft a nearly two-hundred-year-old bookgiven him as a gift in England thirty years earlier. From the Anglicanmissionary Morgan Godwyn’s Negro’s and Indians Advocate, published in 1680, hetook a reassuring lesson of change, since this work’s “anti-slavery tendency”had advanced not abolition itself, but the idea that it was right in God’slights to “baptize a negro,” which two centuries earlier had been seen as a“quite radical doctrine.” With such a prop in hand, Douglass asked his audience,young and old, to fight on to a “second centennial.” The American freedmen, hesaid, had been given “freedom and famine” at the same time. “Talk of having doneenough for these people,” Douglass insisted, “is absurd, cruel, and heartless.”Above all they needed protection for the ballot. Their challenge, he told hisfellow abolitionists, was to secure the results of the great moral change theyhad won.9 [notes02.html#ch25fn_9a]That summer of 1875 Douglass gave a Fourth of July address in Washington thatwas one of the most controversial and compelling efforts of his postwar life. Inthe Hillsdale section of Anacostia, formerly called Uniontown and whereDouglass’s sons had made their homes, a large crowd gathered outdoors in a grovefor a picnic and speeches on July 5 (in black tradition the alternative date).Some 375 acres of what had formerly been the Barry Farm had been set aside bythe Freedmen’s Bureau in this section of the District; five hundred blackfamilies had settled there by 1870. Following a prayer and then atwenty-five-member children’s choir singing patriotic songs, John MercerLangston spoke, appealing vigorously for black self-help. Langston wanted blacksto manage their own institutions, singling out Howard University, where he wason the faculty and Douglass a trustee, for special criticism.10[notes02.html#ch25fn_10a]In his turn before the holiday throng, Douglass delivered a remarkable addressthat was at once angry, historical, antiracist, and a confrontational appeal toblack community self-reliance. In front of church ladies with fans, restlesschildren, and male laborers with a day off, Douglass offered a history lesson.On this ninety-ninth anniversary of American independence, blacks must now facetheir “trial” as “citizens of this Republic,” just as the white founders haddone in their time. Both the Revolution and the Civil War’s second revolutionwere the heritage of African Americans as well as whites. Americans collectivelyshould be by “historic associations and achievements” all one people, he argued.Then in the form of a question, Douglass changed tone and gave the keynote notonly to that day in the grove at Hillsdale, but to the concluding years ofReconstruction. He anticipated the impending US centennial the following year,when the nation would “lift to the sky its million voices in one grandCentennial hosanna of peace and good will to all the white race of thiscountry—from gulf to lakes and from sea to sea.” As black citizen and spokesman,he dreaded the day “when this great white race has renewed its vows ofpatriotism and flowed back into its accustomed channels.” Proud but worried,with the promises of emancipation endangered, Douglass looked back upon fifteenyears of revolutionary change and darkly queried, “If war among the whitesbrought peace and liberty to the blacks, what will peace among the whitesbring?” Douglass warned that “justice” and “reconstruction” did not have a deepenough hold upon the nation.11 [notes02.html#ch25fn_11a] From experience andwith great solicitude, the orator envisioned a road to reunion paved only forwhite people.A “peace among the whites” is a striking way of thinking about the waning ofRadicalism and the end of Reconstruction. The Democrats’ counterrevolution inthe South was indeed a successful white-supremacist insurgency—a political warby whites to forge a peace for whites. Douglass aimed his speech in July 1875directly at his own black community. He implored his people to fight back withthe tools of peace. African Americans were a “divided people,” he argued, andlacked great men in their own ranks to lead them out of their wilderness.Langston and a few other community leaders may have bristled at that comment. Inan unveiled reference to his own recent woes, Douglass lamented that the racelacked its own “grand organ” (newspaper) to defend and advance its cause. “Weare disparaged, vilified, slandered as a people,” Douglass asserted, “but . . .we are dumb and have no press to answer and expose the injustice.” Blacks lackednot only leadership, but basic self-worth. Two hundred years of slavery hadtaught his people to “respect white men and despise ourselves.”12[notes02.html#ch25fn_12a]As a scold, Douglass was not out to make friends that day in Hillsdale. Oddly,he demanded a reinvigorated self-reliance from the picnicking throng, condemning“the swarm of white beggars that sweep the country in the name of the coloredrace.” He boldly recited a slightly revised version of the opening paragraphs ofthe Declaration of Independence, calling on his people to exercise the right ofconsent and revolution and to “alter or abolish” their ties to benevolentorganizations. Blacks needed less charity and more “justice and fair play.”Douglass mocked the “begging class,” which he said was “composed of broken-downpreachers without pulpits, lawyers without clients, professors withoutchairs . . . who fail in everything but managing money given for the benefit ofthe negro.” The only aim of such a class, he caustically maintained, was “toslip into the money boxes of these associations.” Douglass hid nothing of hisown bitterness about the Freedmen’s Bank failure as he listed the types ofcharitable organizations he rejected: “African educational societies, Lincolnand Howard Universities, and freedmen’s banks.” It was as if Douglass breathedreal-life anger and contempt into one of the central themes—“the great NegroUniversity Swindle”—of Mark Twain’s 1873 novel, The Gilded Age. “They [theassociations] keep the public mind constantly upon the poor, wretched negro,”said Douglass, “and thus damn the whole race . . . in pity.” In the Babel thatwas Congress in Twain’s 1870s Washington, money flows toward any project withthe word Negro attached. When Laura Hawkins, as deep in graft for her family’sinterests as any congressman, lines up votes for the black university inTennessee on her ancestral land, she hides nothing: “Now, said she, thesegentlemen are to vote and work for the bill out of love of the negro—and out ofpure generosity I have put in a relative of each as a member of the Universityincorporation.”13 [notes02.html#ch25fn_13a] Douglass and Twain were on the samepage, one with a withering jeremiad and the other with a raucous satire.Few of Douglass’s Reconstruction-era speeches garnered as much press attentionas his Hillsdale Fifth of July address. Democratic Party papers seized on theappeal for black independence, thus using Douglass as a way of condemning the“Radical party” and remaining elements of Reconstruction policy. The WashingtonGazette claimed that Douglass had urged blacks to abandon the Republicans,whereas the New Orleans Louisianan saw the speech the other way around. AnotherWashington paper acknowledged that the address had “been shot with more rapidityall over the country” than any other Fourth of July utterance. The AmericanCitizen found some of the speech “enigmatical,” wondering just what Douglass hadintended. But it lampooned how Democratic papers were “indulging in heartyguffaw” and “hugging, embracing, and rolling over each other . . . at having atlast received the long wished for views of the colored people’s desertion of theRepublican party.” Such celebration, said the Citizen, was merely an“illusion.”14 [notes02.html#ch25fn_14a]Because of so much conflicted public response, Douglass quickly released arevised edition of the text of the speech. He also published a letter in theWashington Republican explaining himself. Friends had written to Douglassworried that Democrats were making great political capital out of hischastisements of black leadership as well as charitable organizations. Theyespecially wanted clarification of Douglass’s views on whether blacks shoulddesert the Republicans. He responded that he had been misunderstood because of“stray sentences torn from their connections.” He tried to set the recordstraight: “There is no truth . . . to the story that I at Hillsdale, or anywhereelse, advised colored men to abandon . . . the Republican party and set up forthemselves.” That day would come, he said, only when both parties were “equallygood or equally bad.” He characterized the address as “an appeal to the Americanpeople to substitute the simple rule of justice for the rule of invidiouscharity in their treatment of the negro—to give him his rights rather thanalms.”15 [notes02.html#ch25fn_15a]This is a prototypical case of a prominent black spokesman whose forthrightstatements about his people’s behavior and self-criticisms were appropriated byracist forces. Douglass was a worried, ambivalent man in the mid-1870s, andfeeling his sense of authority dissipating. A year after the Hillsdale speech,he still found himself defending it to the American Missionary Association. In aletter to that organization’s journal, Douglass reasserted his desire for“justice . . . more than alms,” even as he welcomed their aid. Above all, he didnot want violent white-supremacist Democrats using his words to their ends anymore than he could stomach the “sectarian and selfish purposes” of the “hungryclass” out to lift the destitute Negro of their imaginations. We have watchedthis scene so many times in modern American politics: current Republicans, someof whom love to appropriate Douglass, lifting him out of context to use him inservice to causes he would abhor.16 [notes02.html#ch25fn_16a]• • •If the political scene offered only an unwelcome, dangerous peace, no economicpeace took hold in the mid-1870s either. Economic strife fueled the Americanretreat from Reconstruction. Both before and after the Panic of 1873 widened itsswath of ruin, Douglass engaged the great struggle between labor and capital. Hewas never fond of labor organizations and trade unions largely because of theirdiscriminatory practices against black and Chinese workers. Douglass was apro-tariff protectionist Republican. The high tariff on imports, he said in1871, had “done more to promote the true interests of the workingmen of thiscountry . . . than all the trade unions, eight hour leaguers, and othercombinations to force up their wages and force down the hours of labor that willbe organized to the end of time can ever accomplish.” Before the panic, atleast, he put full faith in the market, what he called “the great law of trade.”Unions, Douglass believed, remembering his sons’ struggles, had no right toprevent “others from working for less.” Leaders of workingmen’s associations, inhis view, spent too much time “making war on capital” and advocating“communism.” Douglass maintained that “real pauperism . . . can always be tracedback to faulty political institutions.” As a true adherent of politicalliberalism, he argued, sometimes vaguely, that extending the franchise did morefor the poor than “all those who attempt to stir up hostility to wealth andencourage outrage and violence.” Sometimes he simply retreated into conservativeresignation on the labor issue. “The labor question . . . is one of the mostdifficult and perplexing,” he wrote in February 1872. “Its satisfactory solutionseems to be reserved for a distant future.”17 [notes02.html#ch25fn_17a]But economic reality did not wait for human solutions to perplexity. Douglass’svision of Reconstruction often lacked thoroughgoing economic analysis, whichhardly made him an exception, even among Radical Republicans. For thispragmatic, classical proponent of liberal democracy, a set of fundamentalassumptions about economic life created several contradictions in hispostemancipation thought: a fierce belief in the sanctity of private propertywhile demanding land for the powerless freedpeople; what often appeared to belaissez-faire individualism and black self-reliance coupled with demands forfederal aid to former slaves denied human capital for generations; and politicalliberty viewed as the source and stimulant of economic independence and civicequality. Moral and political phenomena had always dominated Douglass’s mind;the meaning of liberty for a fugitive slave rising to fame as a reformer,repeatedly rewritten and preached by the self-made hero, had always beenintensely individualistic. Despite many pesky facts in his amazing story,Douglass could never give up on the idea that he, like others, had willed hisfreedom, livelihood, and future. American individualism had few more potentvoices than the postwar Douglass, who struggled for creative prescriptions forthe improvement of America’s recently enslaved peasantry in an age rapidlygrowing hostile to humanitarian reform.In September 1873, Douglass was the keynote speaker in Nashville at the annualfair of the Tennessee Colored Agricultural and Mechanical Association. A hugeprocession escorted him to an amphitheater at the fairgrounds, where in brightsunlight he addressed some five thousand people, not all of whom, according topress reports, were fully attentive in the “holiday” festival atmosphere.Douglass offered a prolonged apology for a lack of genuine agriculturalknowledge, but then delivered a good deal of farming advice, as well as briefcommentaries on meteorology, insect infestation, the history of the plow, andthe romance of rural life. Above all he administered what became for him acommon, stern message about the work ethic. Douglass’s prescriptions were assimple and practical as “be sure of your water and wood!” But they wereultimately moralistic and paternalistic. “Time is money,” Douglass asserted, BenFranklinesque, and he urged farmers to maintain family “peace at home.” Aboveall he delivered a racial-historical plea to these black tillers of the soil toslough off slavery’s influence, the “entrenched errors and habits of centuries.”Douglass’s speech in Tennessee was at once a celebration of modernity and itsnew technologies and an appeal to stay on the land, “the grand old earth,” whichharbored “no prejudices against race, color, or previous condition ofservitude.”18 [notes02.html#ch25fn_18a]In the postwar era, few black leaders delivered more resounding pleas forself-reliance than Douglass. To Douglass, black self-improvement had alwaysmeant adherence to the traditional values of thrift, sobriety, and work; as theyears passed, he became a self-styled, unapologetic advocate of the Gospel ofWealth. At the Tennessee fair he declared that the great question leftunanswered by the war was “whether the black man will prove a better master tohimself than his white master was to him.” Blacks must stake their own claim tocivilization and create their own culture, Douglass asserted, otherwise theywould continue “wearing the old clothes left by a bygone generation.” They wouldhave “no science nor philosophy of their own . . . neither history norpoetry.”19 [notes02.html#ch25fn_19a] Such medicine about self-reliance may havebeen hard to take for some blacks struggling to feed their families.In such settings Douglass exhibited a hidebound traditional conception ofhistory and culture. He knew that William Wells Brown and William Cooper Nellhad written histories; and he surely knew the poetry of Phillis Wheatley and thenumerous slave-narrative authors, among whom he was the most famous. Moreover,he was not the only black journalist in a tradition now decades old. His musingson a lack of black cultural creativity were not generous. But perhaps as a wayof prodding the young in his audiences, he pronounced, “The books we read, thesermons we hear, the prayers we repeat, are all obtained from the white race. Wehave neither made books, sermons, prayers or hymns.” One wonders if Douglassknew that such a statement was both false and painfully useful. He had, afterall, sold thousands of his own books. But the forbidding scold could make thepill even more bitter to swallow with invidious ethnic comparisons. According toDouglass, blacks lacked the unity and peculiar skills of other Americanimmigrant groups, images of which he fashioned in well-worn stereotypes. “We arenot like the Irish, an organized political power, welded together by a commonfaith.” His people also were “not shrewd like the Hebrew, capable of makingfortunes by buying and selling old clothes.” Further, they were no match for theGermans, “who can spend half their time in lager beer saloons and still getrich.” Blacks, said schoolmaster Douglass, were a “laborious, joyous,thoughtless, improvident people,” just released from slavery.20[notes02.html#ch25fn_20a]As Douglass counseled the freedpeople to not migrate, to “accumulate property,”and to create lives “founded on work,” he sometimes revived his older notionthat blacks should be left alone to work out their own destiny. He often couchedthis “let alone” or “do nothing” dictum in an equally vehement appeal forjustice and fair play. But undoubtedly, in the midst of the political wars overReconstruction policy, and this new age’s constant strife over the meaning ofactivist government, Douglass’s plea that the nation leave the freedmen alonesometimes puzzled his friends and armed his enemies. While his son Charles senthim volumes of documents from within the Freedmen’s Bureau, detailing massiveefforts for freedmen’s education and land acquisition, Charles also reportedthat John Mercer Langston and director Oliver O. Howard both wantedclarification of what Douglass meant by “let alone.” According to Charles,Langston had said, “I don’t understand him,” and hoped that the elder Douglasswould “read this report and look over the statistics.” More so, the son conveyedHoward’s direct request: “Write to your father and give him the facts as to thecondition of the freedmen in the South. . . . A great many old and infirmcolored people . . . would perish if let alone.”21 [notes02.html#ch25fn_21a]Douglass had staked out a moral position on self-reliance that no amount of datacould dislodge, although he modified it with time and events. His position was amixture of moral philosophy and political strategy. Too much had been done toblacks throughout the history of slavery; the idealist in the postemancipationDouglass wanted political democracy to be laid so deep in law and society thathis people could simply rise each day, make their own livings, and pursue aneducation in peace. But the elusiveness, even impossibility, of such a peacebecame the reality of Reconstruction; Douglass understood this evolving truthdeep in his bones even as he preached bootstrap sermons to his fellow formerslaves. Confounding both friend and enemy, he developed canny ways to condemnsloth, indulgence, and indifference in one breath, while in the next demandingthe highest forms of political and legal justice.Douglass advanced his “let alone” philosophy throughout the Reconstructionyears, but in New York in May 1869, at the meeting of the American Anti-SlaverySociety, he had delivered one of its most forceful assertions. This audience ofold abolitionists was especially pliant to the argument. They had met to pushwith confidence for ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment, what Douglasscalled the keystone of their cause. He entertained with mimicry and raucoushumor about the many times he had been called “nigger” but still, by closeassociations or experience, had won over his adversaries. The great obstacle infront of the freedpeople was their poverty; they desperately needed aspirationand education. Douglass told of running into a black whitewasher one dayrecently. “We are great on white!” Douglass shouted to his laughing throng. Thenhe quoted the “colored man” with the brush: “As to this thing you call learning,book learning, I ain’t much at that; but that thing you call laying whitewash onthe wall, I am dar.” What blacks most needed, the orator maintained, was “elbowroom and enlarged opportunities.”22 [notes02.html#ch25fn_22a] Humor couldassuage pain and make an audience listen.So “let alone” was really a companion to its apparent opposites: protection, asocial contract, government responsibility and enforcement. Douglass wantedland, jobs, and education. “My politics in regard to the negro is simply this,”he announced in clear terms. “Give him fair play and let him alone, but be sureyou give him fair play [as] a man before the law.” Blacks needed money and a“class of men of wealth.” They needed leisure to pursue intellect and the arts.If his auditors or readers were confused by his position, Douglass was not. Hebelieved government must act as the arbiter of fairness. He gave his fellowwhite citizens, if they would listen, their marching orders. “If you see a negrowanting to purchase land, let him alone; let him purchase it. If you see him onthe way to school, let him go; don’t say he shall not go into the same schoolwith other people. . . . If you see him on his way to the workshop, let himalone; let him work; don’t say you will not work with him.”23[notes02.html#ch25fn_23a]In other words, “let alone” meant rule of law and social peace. It meant stopkilling the freedmen and denying them access to civic life, make the revolutionof emancipation real, enforce it by law, protect it in the courts, teach it inschools, keep the ballot box safe and free to defend that revolution, andreimagine government itself as the source and shield for a brave new economicworld. “Let alone” and “fair play” demanded that whites open their minds and letblacks find their own place in equality before the law, announced in theFourteenth Amendment. Douglass chose unfortunate passive words for a plan ofsocial and political action. He knew this was a somewhat utopian vision. But hewas in for the long haul, and he often prefaced any talk of his “let alone”theory with the sobering admission that slavery “did not die honestly.” It haddied in all-out war, from necessity, not from enlightenment and morality alone.It had been crushed in blood, not merely legislated out of existence. Itsideology and habits, its racial assumptions, lived on in virulent forms. Whenthose were crushed too, then, said Douglass to friend and foe, “you shall havepeace.”24 [notes02.html#ch25fn_24a]One of Douglass’s fullest expressions of the doctrine of self-reliance, thoughit is much more, was his famous speech “Self-Made Men,” delivered dozens oftimes from 1859 to the early 1890s. The lecture reflected the culture andpolitical economy of the Gilded Age; he appears to have carried it along withhim on many of his speaking tours. For example, on the day after he addressedthe Tennessee agricultural fair in 1873, he lectured on “Self-Made Men” to theblack students at the new Fisk University in Nashville. The speech was very mucha celebration of representative “great men” (borrowing from Emerson, whomDouglass warmly acknowledged) and a meditation on success, while offering anextended philosophical discussion of individualism. Emerson’s notion that “allhistory resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout andearnest persons” echoes loudly in Douglass. “Mr. Emerson,” said the orator, “hasdeclared that it is natural to believe in great men. Whether this is a fact ornot, we do believe in them and worship them.” Before launching into his ownlitany of models for great men, Douglass was cautious, warning of how history sooften produces the “false prophet.” But like Emerson, who told of the “sot” who“now and then wakes up, exercises his reason and finds himself a true prince,”Douglass cherished the underdog Lincoln, “the King of American self-made men,”who “mastered his grammar” in a “log hut . . . by the steady glare of a pinewood knot.”25 [notes02.html#ch25fn_25a] Whenever Douglass delivered those lines,he felt their roots in his memory of the loft at the Aulds’ house in Baltimore,the boy by glare of a candle reading his Columbian Orator.Image [../images/f0565-01.jpg]A freedwoman with seventeen children in front of their cabin, c. 1870. The CivilWar had wrought great change, but in much of the South, Douglass’s message ofself-reliance confronted poverty, lack of education, and terror.Douglass rejected the idea of “genius,” abhorred the “accident or good lucktheory” of human achievement, and above all exalted hard work. Winners andachievers in the race of life could be comprehended by “one word, and that wordis WORK! WORK!! WORK!!! WORK!!!!” “Chance” could never explain greatness or evenprofessional accomplishment; only a sense of “order,” trained “habit,” and“systematic endeavor” could lead to world-changing ideas. He had no patienceeither with those who looked to divine favor to find good fortune. The “miracleworking priest” was a mere “pretender.” In his elder years, Douglass certainlydid not reject the Bible as a source of wisdom, but he levied harsh criticismsat black ministers who with emotional “fervor . . . prayed for knowledge . . .[yet] they who prayed loudest seemed to get the least.” Douglass much preferredto employ passages such as John 5:17, when Jesus is condemned to death becausehe broke the law and labored on the Sabbath: “My father worketh, said theSavior, and I also work.”26 [notes02.html#ch25fn_26a]“Self-Made Men” was Douglass’s ultimate commentary on human nature, a theme hefirst explored in his early two autobiographies. People were essentially “lazy,”Douglass believed. “All men,” he said with his well-honed Protestant ethic,“however industrious, are either lured or lashed through the world.” The lectureis at times knitted together by lines that read like platitudes in a young man’sadvice manual. “A man never knows the strength of his grip till life and limbdepend upon it. Something is likely to be done when something must be done.” Alaborer with “broad axe or hoe” needed “hard hands . . . for the blister is aprimary condition to the needed hardness.” For Douglass the greatest cause ofhuman striving was the “sting” of “necessity.”27 [notes02.html#ch25fn_27a]Like Emerson, Douglass’s embrace of individualism called for finding motivation,truth, and one’s own character from within one’s own “soul.” Douglass may haveborrowed actual words as well as ideas from Emerson’s classic essay“Self-Reliance.” But Douglass’s assertion of individualism was cautionary.Emerson beautifully urged us to listen to the “voices which we hear insolitude,” but warned that they “grow faint and inaudible as we enter into theworld. Society everywhere is a conspiracy against . . . every one of itsmembers . . . a joint stock company, in which the members agree, for the bettersecuring of his bread to each shareholder, to surrender the liberty and cultureof the eater.” Douglass, however, chose his metaphors from nature. Absolute“individual independence,” he wrote, “of the past and present . . . can neverexist.” “I believe in individuality, but individuals are, to the mass, likewaves to the ocean. The highest order of genius is as dependent as the lowest.It, like the loftiest waves of the sea, derives its power . . . from thegrandeur and vastness of the ocean of which it forms a part. We differ as thewaves, but are one as the sea.” Douglass’s striving self was foreverdramatically leaping above the waves in rare moments of greatness after years oftreading water.28 [notes02.html#ch25fn_28a]Amid bland comments about an alleged harmony between labor and capital, Douglasstrumpeted his demand for fair play and justice for blacks. The speech alsocontained a remarkable critique of inequality and what might be done about it inthe vicious materialism of the Gilded Age. African Americans, he insisted, beganlife at a very different starting line from whites. Some scholars have suggestedthat inside the “Self-Made Men” lecture was Douglass’s theory of “reparations.”Whether we should call these ideas by that term is debatable. But his judgmentsabout the need for historical justice were unequivocal: “Should the Americanpeople put a schoolhouse in every valley of the South and a church on every hillside and supply the one with teachers and the other with preachers, for ahundred years to come, they would not then have given fair play to the negro.”Lacking specifics, Douglass nevertheless called for a debt to be paid over timewith action. “The nearest approach to justice to the negro for the past,” saidthe orator, “is to do him justice in the present. Throw open to him the doors ofthe schools, the factories, the workshops, and all mechanical industries.”29[notes02.html#ch25fn_29a] Americans were brutally unequal in their beginnings;so act now to repair the past, Douglass seemed to say to white Americans, foryou can never really act enough.Douglass especially celebrated those, such as himself, who rose from the depthsto the heights of their fields. No one could miss the self-references as hehonored those men especially “who owe little or nothing to birth . . . to wealthinherited or to early approved means of education.” Particularly in America, thebest self-made men were those “who are not brought up but are obliged to comeup . . . but often in open and derisive defiance of all the efforts ofsociety . . . to repress, retard and keep them down.” One hears the repressedvoice of Fred Bailey in these passages, and that of Frederick Douglass unleashedon the lecture circuit in the early 1840s. By the time Douglass achievedever-growing fame by giving this special speech in so many places in the 1870sand 1880s, he had long stood as America’s representative self-liberated slave,who with “derisive defiance” had remade himself. In America, he claimed, menwere not judged by their “brilliant fathers,” but merely on their own merits.30[notes02.html#ch25fn_30a] Four younger Douglasses—Rosetta, Lewis, Frederick Jr.,and Charles—had so long wished that this piety were true.The “Self-Made Men” address is an exaltation of at least the promise in Americandemocracy. Douglass plied the depths of American mythology, sounding like theearly Whitman: “We have as a people no past and very little present, but aboundless and glorious future.” Douglass kept that line in the speech even as itdid not fit his own emerging mood during the unraveling of Reconstruction.America was, he claimed, still “the social wonder of the world,” tolerating no“fixed classes” as did the older Europe. Douglass celebrated the overwork ofAmericans. He offered a flawed prediction about the future of Americancapitalism: “To my mind, we have no reason to fear that either wealth,knowledge, or power will here be monopolized by the few as against the many.”31[notes02.html#ch25fn_31a] To understand Douglass during the Gilded Age we haveto comprehend why he could be so wrong with such a surmise, and why he needed tobelieve in it.Although he invoked many passages from the Bible and Shakespeare as well asother poets and literary worthies throughout the speech, he borrowed as much asany from Robert Burns. “Scotia’s matchless son of song,” as Douglass calledBurns, was a lifetime passion for the black writer. Burns’s spirit of democracy,cultivated in Ayr on the west coast of Scotland during the maritime threat ofthe American Revolution, his rebellion against monarchy, aristocracy, and allmanner of convention, and especially his literary probings of the idea ofequality had always inspired Douglass. The American also felt a personalaffinity with the legendary Scot because, as historian John Stauffer has said,“Both men had been born poor, were oppressed by elite whites and treated likebrutes, and found in language a way to remake themselves and build a vision ofhumanity.” In “Self-Made Men” Douglass used Burns to assert the majesty of workwell done, and especially to show how the lowly can achieve greatness: “I seehow folks live that hae riches, / But surely poor folks maun be wretches.”32[notes02.html#ch25fn_32a]In Douglass’s pantheon of self-made men, Burns, like Lincoln and others,provided a model of self-education combined with a holy respect for learning.The orator’s self-revelatory meditation on a life of the mind at the end of thespeech is its most moving element. He took his jabs at America’s most eliteuniversities: “There is a small class of very small men who turn their backsupon anyone who presumes to be anybody, independent of Harvard, Yale, Princetonor other similar institutions of learning. . . . With them the diploma is morethan the man.” He lampooned the “haughty manner” of Yale boys, but neverlearning itself. “There never was a self-educated man who, with the sameexertion, would not have been better educated by the aid of schools andcolleges.” How viscerally Fred Bailey had yearned for formal education. Douglassworshipped books, cherished contemplation and debate; he all but lived for hisnext well-crafted sentence. Words and ideas were the bread and wine of his life.But always, from the streets of Baltimore to an ancient hall in Edinburgh, undera New England church steeple, or in the shadows of the US Capitol, thisself-made man had worried how he could measure up. “A man may know much abouteducating himself,” Douglass said, “but little about the proper means ofeducating others.” A self-made man, he well knew, would always be insecure andself-conscious. He “is liable to be full of contrarieties. He may be large, butat the same time awkward; swift but ungraceful; a man of power, but deficient inthe polish and amiable proportions of the affluent and regularly educatedman.”33 [notes02.html#ch25fn_33a] An almost magical fact of Douglass’s life ishow gracefully he hid such insecurity.• • •In the pivotal political year of 1876, Douglass worried less about hisgracefulness than about his country, the fate of the freedmen, and especiallythat of his own burgeoning family. In the 1870s, Douglass carried on a deeplypersonal correspondence with Rosetta, especially when she moved back toRochester with her brood of children. The “peace at home” that Douglass hadurged upon black farmers was sadly missing for at least two of his own children.Little record exists of how or about which personal matters the old abolitionisttalked to his wife in the couple’s later years. But to his daughter Douglassfrequently complained about aging, about his weariness and bad health, and aboutthe rigors of the road. “I find my continuous working power, in some measurefailing me,” he admitted in late 1873, “and my health rather uncertain as I growolder.” Two months later, the fifty-five-year-old confided that he had “littleheart left for the field,” and that only the “lash and sting of necessity”compelled him to get on the trains. Many of the behavioral prescriptions andambitions he recommended for his thousands of auditors in “Self-Made Men” wereall but killing him. So weary of travel, he told Rosetta, he often wished tostay home in the “chimney corner.”34 [notes02.html#ch25fn_34a]Only a few days before delivering the Hillsdale Fifth of July speech in 1875,Douglass wrote to Rosetta of his desperation for the hearth. Such fatigue anddesire for domestic peace were also exacerbated by financial anxiety. In Anna’smuch smaller garden at the A Street town house than the one she’d had inRochester, Douglass had himself a little corner of his own to cultivate. Hecherished it, he informed his daughter, as he also did his “horse and carriage,and my house duties.” He considered the next lecture journey a “positivemisfortune.” Instead he yearned to “remain in the same place, dine at the sametable, sleep in the same bed, bathe in the same tub, and do an hundred othersame things.” Douglass was tired and otherwise unemployed. He told Rosetta thata “thousand times” he had wished that he had never left Rochester. “I have beennearly ruined financially by coming here [Washington].” He looked forward totalking with his mature daughter because his affairs now made him “fear theworst. Age and want are an ill matched pair.”35 [notes02.html#ch25fn_35a]Moreover, when one of Rosetta’s daughters, Alice, died rather suddenly that samesummer at age six, Douglass wrote with a mixture of grief, spiritual sterility,and fear. His devastated daughter might not have been much comforted by herfather’s philosophizing about death. First, he hoped that Rosetta would notsuffer from the “superstitious terrors with which priest craft has surroundedthe great and universal fact of death.” Douglass, who would later lose many moregrandchildren to early and infant death, urged calmness. “Death,” he said, “isthe common lot of all—and the strongest of us will soon be called away. It iswell! Death is a friend, not an enemy.” Its real “price . . . is with theliving, not with the dead.” These were hard but genuine lessons allnineteenth-century families learned; Allie’s passing surely brought a rush ofmemories of Annie’s death in 1860. As for afterlife, Douglass counseled asorrowful Rosetta to think rationally: “Whatever else it may be, it is nothingthat our taking thought about it can alter or improve. The best any of us can dois to trust in the eternal powers which brought us into existence, and this Ido, for myself and for all.” The grandfather did not go to Rochester for Allie’sburial in Mount Hope Cemetery. Anna apparently did, since Douglass told Rosettathat he did not want to leave the A Street house unoccupied. He expressed fearabout arson and terror, even in Washington: “We have been burnt out once and maybe burnt out again, and if burnt out a second time I have no more strength tostart life anew again. . . . We are not among friends here any more than inRochester.” The elder Douglass was wracked with self-pity at this juncture. “Itis our misfortune to create envy wherever we go. The white people don’t like usand the colored people envy us.” A depressed Douglass seemed to lean on hisgrieving daughter as much as she could lean on him. His stated reason for notattending the funeral, however, may have been, in part, disingenuous; OttilieAssing was in all likelihood staying at the Douglass house at that very time.36[notes02.html#ch25fn_36a]A year later, Rosetta’s life took worse turns yet, and she begged her father forcomfort. She and Nathan were undergoing a marital separation, and she wasdesperate for help. “My breaking up has caused such a flitter among Nathan’screditors and I am being sued on every side,” Rosetta lamented. One creditorpursued the thirty-seven-year-old mother of five surviving children with a notefor $91.48. Rosetta refused to sign, and soon a constable arrived to confiscateall manner of household goods—furniture, clocks, rugs, and even her piano. Shewas selling off “many of Charles’s things” to make money, as a court was aboutto determine whether she was responsible for Nathan’s debts. “I am all torn up,”she reported. “Dear father, I wish I could be with you tonight—and be out ofthis turmoil. I never knew so little what to think in my life.”37[notes02.html#ch25fn_37a]We do not have the father’s response to his daughter’s distress. But he likelyhelped financially. The three years after the bank and the newspaper failureswere troublesome financial times for Douglass. Charles was once again mired indesperation over money and livelihood. After leaving the Treasury Department,Charles had moved back to Rochester, but his debts had pushed him into legaltrouble and damaged the trust between father and son. In 1875 and 1876 some ofCharles’s creditors threatened legal action and adverse publicity againstDouglass himself. Charles sought and received a new job in the foreign service(with the help of his father), as a man named Hollensworth pursued him forpayments of obligations several years old. Charles wrote to his father in July1875 saying that this creditor claimed that the elder Douglass had advised him(Hollensworth) to go to the State Department and prevent the younger Douglassfrom going to his appointment in Santo Domingo. “I am not running away,” Charlespleaded to his father. “I am under obligations to you in a larger sum by fivetimes than to all others together.” Charles knew he had lost his father’s faith;worse, his marriage to his wife, Libbie (Mary Elizabeth Murphy), was in troubledue to her claims about his infidelity. “I know how you feel towards me andwould do anything to change that feeling,” wrote son to father. Douglassimmediately replied and apparently accused his youngest son of “dissipation,” ofsquandering money on extravagance and parties. Charles shot right back, saying,“I have acknowledged my faults to you over and over again,” but denied thefrivolity and irresponsibility. His problems were due, he said, to “making badinvestments,” and he maintained that he had held only “two gatherings at myhouse” in eight years. He did admit to some unfortunate choices about“furniture.”38 [notes02.html#ch25fn_38a]In early 1876, Charles’s creditors continued to stalk his famous father, whoeveryone seemed to assume was wealthier than he was. A W. B. Shaw, a Unionveteran amputee, wrote to Douglass and demanded payment of a $175 debt run upfor services unpaid when Charles had served as treasurer of a county schoolboard. Shaw heard that Charles was heading for Santo Domingo and told Douglassthat he would suffer unwanted “publicity” if he did not pay up the “defrauded”money on behalf of his son. As in other situations, the father probably settledthis mess out of court with quiet payments of cash. From Puerto Plata, SantoDomingo, in August 1876, a lonely Charles, feeling pathetic, wrote in a tone hisfather had heard all too many times. “Under the circumstances of the manyfailures in life,” he declared, “I have felt my letters were not desired. . . .It seems that under any circumstances I am to fail in my undertakings, and mylife is to be one series of blunders. I have been here nearly a year and I don’tknow how I have lived.” Correspondence such as this from his children, riddledwith despair, must have sent Douglass into hiding in his chimney corner.Charles’s travail became worse when two years later his wife, Libbie, died andleft a helpless husband seeking assistance from his extended family in raisinghis two children. The family was relatively silent on this horrible loss; theburial of “Mary Elizabeth Douglass, wife of Charles R. Douglass,” on September21, 1878, “in Cypress Hills Cemetery . . . next to a tree, near Corona, NYstate,” was recorded in the handwriting of one of the brothers in theirscrapbooks.39 [notes02.html#ch25fn_39a]It was not only his children who so often pressed the peripatetic orator formoney. The depression had hit the District of Columbia black community hard.Douglass’s close Washington friend and occasional political collaborator GeorgeT. Downing asked him in early 1877 for a loan of $500 so he could keep his home.In these same years Douglass became a mentor and sometime benefactor for theyoung historian-minister George Washington Williams, paying for him a$14-per-month board during his first year in the capital. When Williams movedout to Cincinnati, he kept his older hero informed of his scholarly habits andendeavors. By 1879, Douglass sent a $1 contribution to Amy Post’s ongoingefforts to financially support Sojourner Truth in her elderly years. He wishedhe could send $10, he said to Post, but “Washington has been a financialmisfortune.” He reminded his old Rochester neighbor that he had lost $10,000 onhis newspaper, and tragedies within his family had created more dependents thanever. Moreover, he complained, “My position here exposes me to an unceasingstream of applications for help and I try to respond favorably to most ofthem.”40 [notes02.html#ch25fn_40a] It turned out that self-made men did not livelives of heroic contemplation and achievement alone.During the 1870s, Ottilie Assing remained very much part of the universe ofDouglass’s family, as well as his personal life. Lewis and Charles, and perhapsRosetta as well, took loans from her at times. Her retreat in Rochester nolonger an option, she now spent parts of summers and some autumns in Washington,living at the A Street house, especially after a new wing was completed in 1874.Assing liked the political hustle and gossip of the capital. Her new hideaway,only a few blocks from the Douglass home, was the Library of Congress, where shecould escape for whole days in books. Ottilie continued to nudge Douglass tomake the European tour with her. In 1876, with the continued urgings of herGerman friends in the Hoboken circle, she finally planned her trip. In June shemay even have extracted some kind of promise (she at least interpreted it thisway) from Douglass that the following spring, after his winter lecturecommitments, he would join her in Paris.41 [notes02.html#ch25fn_41a]Some of Assing’s friends were concerned about her psychological state and pushedher to travel to Europe for health. It was “a huge decision to tear myself awayfrom here,” she wrote her sister in Italy, “and especially the long separationfrom Douglass and from my faithful green macaw [her bird] will almost kill me,so that I am already homesick while I am still here.” Her annual ritual of suchindecision finally ended because Douglass joined her for three special days inearly June visiting the opening of the US Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia.Among the attractions was Rochester artist J. M. Mundy’s bust of Douglass. Butfor Ottilie the days alone with her man were a rare kind of happiness. Shecalled it her “experiment . . . so perfect in every respect.” Whether Douglassactually promised to go to Europe the following year we do not know. He may havethoroughly enjoyed the dreamy conversations about Parisian delights with hisfriend on their days wandering the exhibitions; or he may also have, as MariaDiedrich speculates, “tired of her pleading” and just decided to assuage her anyway possible. Ottilie departed on a steamer on July 13, and she and Douglasswould not see each other again for more than a year.42 [notes02.html#ch25fn_42a]After twenty-three years away from her homeland, Assing conducted a journey fullof spectacular excursions to art museums, the Alps, historic sites and ruins,and especially Rome, where she experienced intense loneliness and a horribleestrangement from her emotionally tyrannical sister. Ottilie and Frederickcarried on a correspondence during her year in Europe; she all but punished himwith long descriptions of beauty and a historical sense of place at every turn,as she somehow kept alive her hope of his joining her in spring 1877. Douglasscontinued to confide in Assing, as her letters show her well informed of some ofthe family dramas and financial debacles. Their rendezvous never occurred, andlikely Douglass never intended it to. Assing worried endlessly about Douglass’shealth and well-being as she described the romance and layered character ofRoman history. She cherished his occasional letters. As she told of her new andold friends, kept up with news of American politics, and painfully recounted thedestruction of her relationship with Ludmilla, Douglass seems to have pulledback and begun to sever a deep connection in his life that he either no longerneeded or could no longer manage with the logistical and emotional dexterity hehad so long maintained.43 [notes02.html#ch25fn_43a] A complete severing wouldtake a few more years and come at a great price for the sad, devoted Ottilie.• • •Even before Assing went to Europe in 1876, Douglass was engulfed in the newelection season. As early as the fall of 1875 he toured, especially in NewEngland, on behalf of Republicans. He spoke at a huge clambake in September inOld Orchard Beach, near Portland, Maine, at what a local paper called thelargest rally ever held in that state. Some seventeen thousand to twentythousand people arrived on special trains for this combination of late-summerstate fair and political festival. Douglass did not disappoint. He told all whocould hear him that everything was at stake in the next presidential contest.Blacks in the South faced “utter extinction” if Democrats won. “I beseech you,shelter us from the storm.” At these rallies, and throughout the campaign thefollowing year, Douglass made the case about what the nation, and thereforewhite people, owed blacks. Reconstruction had to be sustained. “Save us a fewyears more, until the old rebels die out,” he pleaded, “and we have a chance topresent ourselves to hands unstained by treason.” Douglass asked his countrymento enlist in repairing the past with their votes in the present. “I tell you allyou can do for the next fifty years,” he shouted, “will not atone for the wrongand oppression of two hundred years.” At the end of his address, according tothe Portland Daily Press, a huge throng “crowded about” Douglass congratulatinghim and wanting to shake his hand or touch his coat, as “women were moved totears and men to righteous wrath.”44 [notes02.html#ch25fn_44a]As the election neared in 1876, all knew that the last vestiges ofReconstruction policies and regimes were at stake in the remaining “unredeemed”Southern states. One was Louisiana, which for three years had experienced notonly continued violence, but also labyrinthine politics that had produced a USsenator, or at least aspirant, P. B. S. Pinchback, a black Republican of mixedrace and a flamboyant past. Pinchback, who briefly served as Louisiana’sgovernor, and Douglass became correspondents and friends. The Louisianan stayedat Douglass’s house during some of his long visits to Washington awaitingcongressional approval of the legitimacy of his seat. Perhaps no other electoralsaga of Reconstruction is quite as Byzantine as Pinchback’s. Everyone seemed toknow about Pinchback’s past as a riverboat gambler, a street fighter, andallegedly a dandy among women. Closely tied to former Louisiana governor HenryClay Warmoth, Pinchback also had his hands in financial corruption and votebuying. But he was a staunch advocate of black civil and political rights aswell as federal engagement and Republican rule in his state. Pinchback was firstappointed by the Louisiana legislature to the US Senate in January 1873. Butpartisan warfare, as well as the man’s taint of corruption, led to one delay orvote to block his seating after another.45 [notes02.html#ch25fn_45a]Douglass, as he tended to do with most accusations of Republican corruption,ignored Pinchback’s background and embraced him as a pioneer black politicianwith a genuine right to his place in the Senate. Douglass had long ago learnedthat politics contained multiple rights and wrongs; in this case Reconstructionitself, and therefore the rights of black people, were at stake. In the NewNational Era, the editor had declared that slavery had been “so monstrous thatthe blackest charges and . . . rumor grow clean under its awful enormities. Somebecome great rowers in Harvard or Cambridge who would have been boatmen withoutthe opportunities of an education, others gamble with cards because they arereduced by the laws” to other means in the “management of men.” The escapedslave who led by language and symbol knew a useful boatman when he met one.46[notes02.html#ch25fn_46a]Douglass did all in his power to support the black senator from MississippiBlanche K. Bruce, as well as the handful of other black Southerners who wereelected to the House of Representatives. They all represented a dream come true,Douglass believed, as long as the Republican Party survived to defend them. Mostblack Southern politicians came from different pasts than Douglass; some wereformer slaves, and even Union soldiers, while some also had been educated in theNorth, as had Bruce. Few had careers in the abolition movement or had achievedany literary fame like Douglass. They were all Republicans, but struggledmightily to sustain faith in the party as Reconstruction waned. In April 1875,Pinchback wrote to Douglass, complaining about the compromises of LouisianaRepublicans, many of whom, he thought, were only interested in “unloading theNegro.” He worried about “cowardly white Republicans” nationally who wouldultimately betray black rights. Pinchback looked up to Douglass: “Oh God how Iwish I had your knowledge and ability to grapple with the difficulties I see onevery hand besetting us.” Their people, he told Douglass, needed a “great mindto guide them in this crisis of our history.”47 [notes02.html#ch25fn_47a] Bothmen were vexed about solutions.Pinchback went in and out of favor even with his fellow Republicans in thebizarre twists and turns that led to a final vote on his seating in March 1876.Seven cold-footed Republicans joined with Democrats to block Pinchback’s entryto the Senate by a vote of 32–29. Bitter partisanship and questions about hischaracter led to the final failure of Pinchback’s appointment. On the nightafter the vote Douglass spoke at a rally on behalf of the Louisianan inWashington, attended by more than four hundred, mostly black, supporters. It waseasy to blame the racist Democrats, but primarily Douglass vented anger on the“mean and malignant prejudice of race” from the small group of recalcitrantRepublicans. A great wrong had been done, but Douglass tried to rally thegathering. He still believed the Republicans were the “party of justice andfreedom,” and he trusted that American voters would not deliver the countrylater that fall “back into the hands of the party of rebellion and slavery.”After the speeches, much of the crowd of supporters marched to Douglass’s houseon A Street, for one final rally.48 [notes02.html#ch25fn_48a]A month later, Douglass delivered his magnificent “Freedmen’s Memorial Address”at the unveiling of the Lincoln monument in Washington, the speech assessed atlength in the opening chapter of this book. In that remarkable oration, Douglassoffered perhaps his most sophisticated warning on behalf of black people aboutthe consequences of a failure of Reconstruction.49 [notes02.html#ch25fn_49a] Thefate of the era’s transformations lay in the balance, Douglass firmly believed,in the election of 1876. The standing Lincoln and the kneeling slave were eithergazing out at an egalitarian future rooted in black freedom and equality, or attheir disastrous betrayal in a political culture stultified by racism andeconomic strife.In this intensely hot political context Douglass attended in June the RepublicanNational Convention in Cincinnati. Since Grant had decided not to run for athird term, something Douglass had openly advocated, the frontrunner for theRepublican nomination was the former House Speaker James G. Blaine. But in Aprila story broke that Blaine had used his influence to garner land grants for onerailroad and taken a personal “loan” from another that went unpaid; hiscandidacy steadily collapsed. Many Republicans concluded that they needed acandidate untainted by scandal. So the party chose the safe, unoffending,relatively little-known Union veteran and three-time governor of Ohio RutherfordB. Hayes as its standard-bearer. Hayes was sturdy, favored hard money over papercurrency, possessed a Harvard law degree, seemed to have no obvious enemies, andwas willing to soft-pedal on the “Southern question,” which was always codelanguage for black rights. The party’s platform was rather tepid on furtherenforcement of Reconstruction policies, vague on women’s suffrage, and promisedto prosecute corruption. Hayes strove for an honest, if naïve, sectional“pacification,” a new harmony between the races and the sections.50[notes02.html#ch25fn_50a]Contrary to those who claim that Douglass “did not see what was happening” inthe 1876 campaign, the orator was deeply engaged and profoundly worried. TheCincinnati convention included a significant number of black delegates, many ofwhom were serving congressmen. Following after the Reverend Henry HighlandGarnet, Douglass was one of the black speakers welcomed to the rostrum. In ashort but poignant address, Douglass provided a mixture of entertainment,bloody-shirt waving, abolitionist principles, and jeremiad. He garnered laughterby saying this was the first time he had ever enjoyed the “pleasure of lookingthe Republican party squarely in the face,” and that they seemed “pretty goodlooking.” He invoked the battlefields where their sons had “poured out theirblood.”51 [notes02.html#ch25fn_51a]Then Douglass directly challenged the white delegates on the vagueness of theirplatform and the weakness of their commitments. Reminiscent of the Fourth ofJuly address of twenty-four years earlier, he flung the pronouns “you” and“your” down on his audience, as they ceased laughing. “You have emancipated us.I thank you for it,” Douglass announced. “You have enfranchised us, and I thankyou for it. But what is your emancipation . . . if the black man, after havingbeen made free by the letter of the law, is unable to exercise that freedom; andafter having been freed from the slaveholder’s lash he is to be subject to theslaveholder’s shotgun?” He reminded this political class that in Exodus theIsraelites, when emancipated, “were told to go borrow of their neighbors . . .[to] load themselves down with the means of subsistence after they should gofree in the land which the Lord God gave them.” But now, more than a decadeafter the revolution, he bemoaned the situation: “You turned us loose to thesky, to the storm . . . and, worst of all, you turned us loose to the wrath ofour infuriated masters.” Douglass left the Republicans with a resoundingquestion: “Do you mean to make good the promises in your Constitution? Talk notto me of finance. Talk not of mere reform in your administration . . . but tellme, if your hearts be as my heart, that the liberty which you have asserted forthe black man in this country shall be maintained!”52 [notes02.html#ch25fn_52a]This was hardly the rhetoric of a man merely seeking favor and office with thepliant Hayes.Douglass’s courage was both rewarded and attacked. He received mostly favorablepress from Republican friends, but racist loathing and lampooning fromDemocrats. His enemies had noticed the speech. A Port Jervis, New York, paperreported that “Fred Douglass got off a lot of nonsense about Southern outrages”and Republican Party failures “to do its whole duty to the colored people in notgiving each voter forty acres and a mule, and providing a file of soldiers totake him to the polls.” The New York Evening Post “regretted that FrederickDouglass will not teach the colored people the lesson of self-dependence,instead of always demanding . . . fresh guarantees, by proclamation, by statute,and by bayonet, of the rights which they must largely maintain for themselves.”The Post’s editors had missed the countless appeals the orator had made to blackself-reliance. A Tuscaloosa, Alabama, paper complained that the CentennialExposition opening in Philadelphia had allowed “a nigger” like Douglass anyofficial status. Later that summer, Douglass campaigned vigorously for Hayes,especially in New England, his expenses paid by the Republican Party. For thebusy orator, faith and fear marched together.53 [notes02.html#ch25fn_53a]What choice did he have? The Democrats ran as their presidential candidateSamuel J. Tilden, governor of New York, one of the richest men in America andthe legal counsel to financial titans on Wall Street. A Democratic victory wouldplainly bring white supremacy forcefully back into federal power, endangeringall the Reconstruction legislation. Hayes himself, who proffered a naïvegoodwill and preferred ambiguous suggestions of “a hearty and generousrecognition of the rights of all,” and an end to the “distinction between Northand South,” nevertheless admitted openly that “the true issue in the minds ofthe masses is simply, shall the late Rebels have the Government.”54[notes02.html#ch25fn_54a] Douglass could only hope that Hayes’s particularcombination of the bloody shirt and sectional reconciliation might serve thecause of black life and liberty, and not merely Republican power.• • •In 1876 the project of Reconstruction, and perhaps the United States itself,were like a huge battleship slowly turning around as it lost power; onceturning, it could hardly be stopped, even if the same group of officers remainedat the helm. That year the Supreme Court weakened the Reconstruction-eraconstitutional amendments by emasculating the enforcement clause of theFourteenth Amendment and revealing deficiencies in the Fifteenth Amendment. InUS v. Cruikshank, based on prosecutions for the horrible Colfax massacre of1873, the Court overruled the conviction of Louisiana whites who had attacked apolitical meeting of blacks and conspired to deprive them of their rights. Thejustices ruled that the Fourteenth Amendment did not give the federal governmentpower to uphold a conviction against the whites who had committed a mass murderof more than one hundred black Louisianans exercising political liberty. Theduty of protecting citizens’ equal rights, the Court said, “rests alone with theStates.” Such judicial conservatism and embrace of states’ rights doctrine,practiced by the justices, all of whom had been appointed by Republicanpresidents Lincoln and Grant, left a resounding imprint on what remained ofReconstruction.55 [notes02.html#ch25fn_55a]In the disputed election of 1876, Tilden in all likelihood won the popular voteby more than two hundred thousand votes and 3 percent, but did not becomepresident. When election returns poured in, it appeared that Hayes had failed,but the three “unredeemed” Southern states of Louisiana, Florida, and SouthCarolina were fiercely and violently contested. With 185 electoral votes neededfor victory, without the three disputed states Tilden had 184 and Hayes 166.Both sides claimed they had won and accused their opponents of fraud in thedisputed states, although most of the bloodshed and intimidation committed inthose states had been against black Republican voters. To resolve thisunprecedented situation, Congress established a fifteen-member electoralcommission, balanced between Democrats and Republicans. Because Republicans helda majority in the overall Congress, they prevailed 8–7 on repeated attempts to“count” the confused returns. As the midwinter crisis dragged on in Washington,it appeared Hayes would become president. Democrats controlled the House andlaunched a filibuster to block action on the count.56 [notes02.html#ch25fn_56a]Many Americans worried that the nation would once again slip into civil war, assome Southerners vowed, “Tilden or fight!,” and Hayes’s managers refused anyretreat from their claim to the 19 disputed electoral votes and therefore avictory of 185–184 in the Electoral College. This cliff-hanging constitutionalcrisis found an end in what became known as the Compromise of 1877, a dealstruck in part in a smoke-filled room of a Washington hotel at the eleventhhour. Democrats acquiesced in the election of Hayes in exchange for promises tothe South of government aid to railroads, internal improvements, federalpatronage, possibly one cabinet position, and the removal of any remainingtroops in the ex-Confederacy. Thus Hayes became president, inaugurated privatelyinside the White House to avoid any threat of violence. White Southern Democratsrejoiced in what they clearly saw as the end of Reconstruction, while AfricanAmericans had little choice but to grieve over what appeared as a betrayal oftheir hopes for equality.57 [notes02.html#ch25fn_57a]Douglass watched and worried about the disputed election of 1876 and itssubsequent compromise. He saw grounds for hope in that the Republicans held thepresidency, even as judicial and congressional intervention on behalf of blackrights seemed in grave jeopardy. He dearly wanted to trust Hayes. Soon, the newpresident, continuing his remarkable dance between vague promises to enforceequal rights and actions that eroded or destroyed those rights, offered Douglassthe salaried federal appointment, subject to Senate approval, that he had longcoveted. Douglass was not silent or out of touch as some suggested during the1876–77 crises, and he had bravely challenged his own party to live up to itspromises.58 [notes02.html#ch25fn_58a] But words had, for once, partly failed himat this turn in his career. Soon he was sworn in as marshal of the District ofColumbia and could leave the speaking circuit to a degree. Above all, he had toserve and symbolically lead now in an America he had painfully predicted, onetaken over by a “peace among the whites.”"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 26--------------------------------------------------------------------------------AN IMPORTANT AND LUCRATIVE OFFICEWhen the influence of office or any other influence shall soften my hatred oftyranny and violence do not spare me; let fall upon me the lash of your keenestand most withering censure.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1879In mid-January 1877, a blizzard swept across western New York State. FrederickDouglass was once again out on the winter lecturing circuit. He found himself“snowbound fifteen miles from Corfu,” a town between Buffalo and Rochester. Hewas unable to get east or west for two days, he told his friend Amy Post, whohad long been an important confident. With the assistance of seven locomotives,he slowly reached Buffalo on tracks overlaid with snowdrifts. Almostunbelievably, his destination on this trip was first Detroit and then TraverseCity, Michigan, far up in the northwest corner of that state’s lower peninsula.“I am now about disgusted with my tour and wish myself back under yourhospitable roof,” he wrote to Mrs. Post, “but the idea of duty, which hashitherto commanded me is still my master and will compel me to go on.” Hepersevered and did indeed reach Traverse City to lecture there on January 19.This grueling two-month tour of at least thirty-three hundred miles by rail,carriages, horseback, and perhaps even oxcart, delivering both politicalspeeches and the “Self-Made Men” address in at least thirty-three towns andcities, took him from Pennsylvania through New York, to Michigan, Illinois,Wisconsin, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, and back through Ohio to Pennsylvania againand home to Washington, DC. The tour included all the usual indignities,including yet another Jim Crow incident. In Springfield, Missouri, Douglass was“invited,” as he put it, into the kitchen to get his breakfast at his hotel. Herejected the segregation and refused to eat. “The South is still the hell-blackSouth,” he remarked to a reporter, “and will remain so for a good whilelonger.”1 [notes02.html#ch26fn_1a] That “idea of duty” Douglass named was stillthe primary livelihood of the burgeoning extended family of Douglasses,Spragues, and others.Image [../images/f0582-01.jpg]Amy Post, Douglass’s old friend and confidant in Rochester.While passing through Columbus, Ohio, on February 17, Douglass conducted aninterview with the presumptive president-elect, Rutherford B. Hayes, then stillgovernor of that state. James Poindexter, the black minister of Second BaptistChurch in Columbus, accompanied Douglass to the meeting. Even with the disputedelection crisis in full fury, they may have discussed an appointment forDouglass in the federal government. Hayes recorded in his diary that Douglassgave him “many useful hints” about the “Southern question.” The governor thendescribed his position to Douglass: “My course is firm assertion and maintenanceof the rights of the colored people of the South, according to the 13th, 14th,and 15th amendments—coupled with a readiness to recognize all Southern people,without regard to past political conduct, who will now go with me heartily andin good faith in support of these principles.” These were the two opposed partsof Hayes’s vision of the post-Reconstruction South. Douglass had both personaland ideological reasons to share in such hope. Within a week of his meeting withDouglass, the president-elect crafted three paragraphs to be used in pendingspeeches. Again, Hayes searched for a careful, if firm, middle ground. The threeamendments were to be “sacredly observed and faithfully enforced,” and a newpolicy enacted to “cause sectionalism to disappear, and that will tend to wipeout the color line.”2 [notes02.html#ch26fn_2a]Douglass had long known that even forlorn hope that mocked historical experiencewas sometimes better than despair. A year and a half later in a newspaperinterview, however, he recollected the Columbus session with Hayes in harsherpolitical terms. In the meeting, Douglass had announced his “sense of alarm” atthe new president’s conciliation toward the South. For an hour, Douglassclaimed, he gave Hayes a historical review of the last forty years of the“exactions and arrogance” of the Slave Power. He warned that white Southernersconsidered themselves above the law, and that they had the blood of thousands ofblacks on their hands. Douglass insisted that a policy of “conciliation would beas pearls cast before swine,” and that what white Southerners most needed “wasto be taught that there is a God in Israel.”3 [notes02.html#ch26fn_3a] Afterinviting God’s wrath down on the South, he and Hayes had parted, Douglassremembered, with mutual respect.Shortly after the inauguration in early March, Hayes put Douglass’s name forwardfor marshal of the District of Columbia. All of Douglass’s family, as well asmany friends, dearly hoped for such a position. Early that spring OttilieAssing, for once speaking for all of them, said that the appointment might notonly be “honorable and lucrative,” but relieve the orator “of the necessity ofundertaking each winter those dangerous, difficult, and unhealthy lecturetours.” The appointment as marshal was the first time in American history thatan African American was nominated for a position that required Senate approval.The job, which Douglass himself later called “important and lucrative,” made himpart of the federal criminal justice system. The marshal posted all bankruptciesin the District and remanded all prisoners back and forth between jail and thecourts. In effect, he helped run the federal court that once adjudicatedfugitive-slave cases. Hayes did, however, buckle under to prejudice by relievingDouglass of one traditional duty—introducing distinguished guests at White Housereceptions. The new marshal accepted the slight, although in his laterautobiography he lampooned the reasons for it. The great apprehension at hisappointment reflected not only fear that he would “Africanize the courts,” hewrote, by hiring black clerks, but of the “dreadful” image of “a colored man atthe Executive Mansion in white kid gloves, sparrow-tailed coat, patent-leatherboots, and alabaster cravat, performing the ceremony—a very empty one—ofintroducing the aristocratic citizens.”4 [notes02.html#ch26fn_4a] Douglass mighthave enjoyed wearing the cravat and the fancy coat, but had no interest in beinga high-placed butler.Odd as it may seem to us today, the appointment caused both a storm of protestand a wave of celebration in the press. Opposition to Douglass’s appointmentcame primarily from a group of white Washington lawyers, as well as a few blackleaders and office seekers. “Everybody admits that he is a man of high culture,”said the Washington Star, “and thoroughly educated, but they claim he is tootheoretical.” Some blacks supposedly complained that Douglass was “toohigh-toned” to represent the “mass of his people.” Members of the barassociation argued that the former slave possessed the “incapacity of a childfor a position requiring tact, executive ability and a large knowledge of man.”Other whites dismissed him for lacking “business capacity.” Many newspaperscovered Douglass’s elevation to marshal with what the New York Times called“dramatic interest.” The Washington Sentinel complimented Hayes’s fervor forcivil service reform as evidenced in the Douglass appointment. But Forney’sSunday Chronicle said the president should have given Douglass a position “lessembarrassing.” One paper could not resist the ironies of this former outlawslave now so central to law enforcement. The New York Evangelist reported thatan ex-constable in the city, when asked by a bailiff “if he was looking forMarshal Douglass,” replied, “No, sir, not now; but there was a time, when he wasa fugitive slave, when I tried hard to find him.”5 [notes02.html#ch26fn_5a]Some journalists considered the marshal’s job in the District second inimportance only to cabinet secretaries, while others thought it largelysymbolic. But the symbolism of a black man selected by the president carriedbroad significance. News of the appointment had “spread with astonishingrapidity among the negroes of the South,” reported the Chicago Evening Journal.“Every surviving victim of the bull-dozing [violence and terror] sees thereinassurance of protection.” Such firsts were a big deal in the uncertain racialatmosphere of post-Reconstruction America. A New Jersey paper put wishfulfillment ahead of reality with the headline “Color Line Abolished.” One NewYork paper gushed that Douglass was “the ablest negro produced in the UnitedStates . . . the negro longest in the public eye . . . nearly a NegroWashington, except in deeds of arms.” A Michigan paper declared that a new dayhad arrived in the national capital: “An ex-slave is now marshal of that oldBabylonian city. Verily Babylon has fallen!” Old abolitionist friends rejoicedin private letters, such as Theodore Tilton in New York: “How the world wags! Tome the spectacle of Frederick Douglass as marshal of the Capital . . . is agreater evidence of human progress than if I could see either Abraham, Isaac, orJacob elected by a returning board as mayor of Jerusalem!”6[notes02.html#ch26fn_6a]The Washington Star, which pruriently began to cover Douglass’s family almost asa kind of black first family, reported within a week of the appointment thatLewis and Frederick Jr. were hard at work answering their father’s letters ofcongratulations, many of which ended with pleas for jobs. Douglass now playedthe role of patron in more ways than one. Lewis was soon appointed as a deputyat the marshal’s office; all of his siblings would in time work there as well,or in other appointed positions, under considerable controversy. And at leastone African American commentator, Fanny M. Jackson, wrote as though Douglasswere what a century later might be considered the first affirmative-actionappointment. She thought Douglass more than qualified, “but the idea that thisdistinguished man has been honored on account of his color, and that we ought tobe particularly jubilant over it, is not only great nonsense, but positivelyharmful to us.” In language that would fit a similar debate today, she wishedfor transcendence of race: “If anything else but fitness has put him into thisposition, his appointment is simply a great . . . blunder. . . . It is just thissort of skin-deep qualification for superior advantages and honors that we havebeen fighting all our days.”7 [notes02.html#ch26fn_7a] As the author of some ofthe most searching analyses of race and racism in the nineteenth century, thenew federal officeholder must have observed all these opinions with wry smiles.One of the most trenchant responses to Douglass’s elevation to marshal came fromthe pen of Sara Jane Lippincott (known by her pen name Grace Greenwood). Ajournalist who had cut a wide literary path since the early 1850s, when she wasthe copy editor of Uncle Tom’s Cabin as it was serialized at the National Era,Greenwood later became the first woman on the staff of the New York Times, andone of the first to gain access to the press galleries of the US Capitol.Greenwood wrote with sarcasm and celebration about Douglass’s appointment. Shelampooned the opposition as cowardly “bitter society dogs” who could be seen“barking at the enemy around the corner,” and who “yelped themselves hoarse andfell into spasms of color-phobia.” After exhausting all their excuses foropposing Douglass, said Greenwood, the haughty lawyers were left only with theirone “real objection”—he was not a white man. An admirer of Douglass’s writing,Greenwood defended the former slave’s peculiar education with a flourish ofportraiture.8 [notes02.html#ch26fn_8a]Greenwood argued that living in racist America had provided Douglass’seducation. His adroitness at leadership had been forged in “Freedom’s HighSchool of politics.” Douglass inspired these kinds of physical and aestheticdescriptions throughout his career. Greenwood fashioned one of the best, findingin his visage a “courtly grace” and a raw power that took her inevitably toOthello. “Not that he need say,” wrote Greenwood, so she said it for him:“Haply, for I am black / And have not those soft parts of conversations / Thatchamberers have.” Greenwood bitingly declared that Douglass’s enemies managedonly “envious vulgarity” and saw “in his genius and culture only opportunitiesto wound and insult him.” She saw “Othello’s visage in his mind” and capturedthree and a half decades of Douglass’s encounter with white-American racialresentment.9 [notes02.html#ch26fn_9a]So Othello had found a good-paying job. For his part Douglass later rememberedthis episode with measured perspective, writing, “An appointment to anyimportant and lucrative office brings . . . praise and congratulation on the onehand and much abuse and disparagement on the other.” If only serving as marshal,though, had been as dramatic as becoming marshal. The marshalship gave Douglassa new kind of fame. In April, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper ran alithograph depicting Douglass in his office greeting a line of both elderly andyoung black well-wishers. The stout and dignified Douglass is the epitome ofrespectability, while the picture is set off by a white aide behind him whocannot be bothered to stop reading his morning newspaper. Soon after taking theoffice, Douglass experienced yet another postslavery reunion. After forty-oneyears, the Harris brothers, John and Henry, with whom Fred Bailey had shared thelife-altering escape plot and deep bond of friendship on the Freeland farm in1836, discovered their old comrade. John, who had worked for years in aBaltimore shipyard, and accompanied by the son of another brother, William,followed the publicity about the famous marshal and came to Washington to seehim. Henry apparently did not make the journey from the Eastern Shore. Douglasswould have relished such a meeting with Henry, the one to whom he had beenchained in their humiliating trek to jail in Easton.10 [notes02.html#ch26fn_10a]We can imagine the strange pleasure and discomfort of this encounter of formerslaves, one an unknown dockworker, the other a national political and literarycelebrity.Image [../images/f0586-01.jpg]“Colored Citizens Paying Respects,” Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper, April7, 1877, lithograph. It depicts Douglass in his new job as marshal of theDistrict of Columbia.Douglass’s private life as well as his every public action more and more becamenewsworthy. As he found footing in official Washington, he began to embody aseries of contradictions that both enriched and circumscribed his life. He wasnow the outsider who would be the insider, an anointed symbol and heroic icon ofthe past who still wanted to be the activist in the present. Would he grow oldand lose his voice in appointed office or still be a voice of resistance andprotest? Would his leadership slip into the merely emblematic or fiercely resistall forms of white supremacy? Entering his sixties, was he a figure of the pastor still of the future? How would the country’s most famous former slave balancevengeance with forgiveness in this era of increasing sectional reconciliation?How would Douglass help blacks and whites remember or forget the great epochthey had just endured? How could a bureaucrat remain a radical?The philosopher Cornel West meditated on this question of whether Douglass fell“out of touch” in his later years as he became a Republican making some “vulgarcompromises.” The “freedom fighter” who shifted from “prudence to opportunism,”argues West, ended up “defanged” as the insider in Washington. West wishesDouglass might have “sided with the populist movement,” instead of embracing apolitical system that could “absorb him, incorporate him, diffuse his fire.”These sentiments have some veracity; Douglass had to grow old in the Gilded Age,make a living for all those around him, while embodying a living symbol as fewothers ever have. But Othello needed new occupations and livelihoods. He foreverremade himself, and such an imperative was no less the case inpost-Reconstruction America than in his earlier heroic life. Many have wishedupon the old orator a sterner economic analysis of inequality, or a lesstriumphal advocacy of self-reliance. But he lived his life in the nineteenthcentury as a consummate political liberal. It further does little good to ask,with West, “Where is the voice of the early Douglass . . . as Jim Crow isdeveloping in the 1870s and 1880s?” That voice changed and emerged lessaggressively perhaps; but it never died. He kept his fangs filed on issues ofracism, violence, states’ rights, and the nation’s memory. He had beenJim-Crowed so many times he quit counting. He answered such humiliations withdignity, eloquence, disobedience, and intelligence. West does consider Douglass“deeply prophetic,” a voice of wisdom beyond his time. And West acknowledgesthat Douglass understood that “you don’t find truth in the middle of the road;you find truth beneath the superficial, mediocre, mainstream dialogue . . .buried . . . hidden . . . and when you connect with that truth, you have to takea stand.”11 [notes02.html#ch26fn_11a] Some freedom fighters wear starchedshirts, cultivate their appearance, and battle evil with words.• • •From 1877 into the early 1880s, Douglass only rarely left the environs ofWashington, Baltimore, and other parts of Maryland or Virginia to lecture; for awhile, as he reached sixty years old, no more Midwest winter tours threatenedhis health. In May 1877, barely a month into his tenure as marshal, he delivereda speech in Baltimore, “Our National Capital,” that caused a firestorm ofreaction. He had now lived in Washington full-time for six years and knew itsculture. In 1871, appointed by President Grant, Douglass had served a brief twomonths in the Legislative Council when the District of Columbia had territorialstatus. Because of his heavy speaking schedule, he resigned and his son Lewisserved out the two years of the term. Douglass might have had little interest inthe daily running of the District, but he became deeply concerned asWashington’s mere three years as a territory came to an abrupt end whenDemocrats gained control of Congress in 1874.12 [notes02.html#ch26fn_12a]Given his official position, the directness of Douglass’s statements about boththe racism and the political skulduggery at the center of Gilded Age politics in1877 was more than his enemies could bear. Initially, Douglass celebrated atransformed Washington, an urban landscape revitalized by the “vast andwonderful revolution . . . during the last dozen years.” Emancipation, thesaving and remaking of the Union, had given the city new life, and the Capitolgrounds themselves had been reimagined by the genius of landscape architectFrederick Law Olmsted. Under the Republicans’ territorial government, andespecially the Board of Public Works, led by Alexander Shepherd, thoroughfaresand parks had replaced the prewar squalor with beauty and promise. The boardspent a great deal of money on urban improvements, including new housing andschools for a city that had become one-third black.13 [notes02.html#ch26fn_13a]The city was still awash too often in a “cant of patriotism,” in Douglass’sview. But a promising new brand of postwar nationalism reigned. With his hopefulhat on, Douglass declared that “men of all races, colors, and conditions . . .[were] thrilled with the sentiment of equal citizenship and common country.” Thecosts and sorrows of the war still hung all over the city, but so did the newnation’s “trophies and her monuments . . . her witnesses are a free country, aunited country, and emancipated millions forever redeemed from the horror ofslavery.” Douglass announced his own sense of belonging, as he also delivered afull-throated embrace of the centralization of power in the federal government.He denounced the states’ rights doctrines emanating from the Democratic Partyand the federal courts as a path to “disorganization and disorder.” Then heslipped his cynical hat on and spoke for the remaining two-thirds of the addressabout the differences between what “ought to be” and the historical “reality” ofthe federal city.14 [notes02.html#ch26fn_14a]Douglass identified “disgraceful and scandalous contradictions” all around. Hemade an argument for home rule for residents of the District of Columbia,observing that apart from women, they were the only Americans disenfranchised.Above all he fashioned a social analysis of the class divisions and prewarproslavery as well as postwar white supremacy in the capital’s politicalculture. He argued that the national capital should never have been moved fromPhiladelphia, since Washington was and always had been too pro-Southern. Heskewered all brands of “lobbyists” and “spoilsmen.”15 [notes02.html#ch26fn_15a]With unabashed caricature he put his hatred of the slaveholding South on fullsatirical display. Although diminished in stature since the war, the “oldslaveholding stock of Virginia and Maryland” were still visible in the capitalin pursuit of “Uncle Sam’s good things” with “leisurely indolence.” TheWashingtonian of Southern background was “never in a hurry . . . his gait isslow . . . his arms dangle,” since his “muscles have had little to do.” Douglasswarmed to his prey. The Southern man possessed the “sitting power of a Turk,”always “toying with a cane . . . as a badge of authority.” This living relictilted his hat lower than most over his eyes since he could not abide a “manlyopenness of character.” Most telling, the white Washingtonian of Southerninfluence had “something of the negro in his speech.” Here Douglass anticipatedby almost a century Ralph Ellison’s observations about an “American language”that had always evolved as a “vernacular revolt . . . merging the sounds of manytongues.” Whether acknowledged or not, said Ellison, “that language is derivedfrom the timbre of the African voice and the listening habits of the Africanear.” “Slave speech” sounded beneath “Harvard accents, and if there is such athing as a Yale accent, there is a Negro wail in it—doubtlessly introduced thereby Old Yalie John C. Calhoun, who probably got it from his mammy.” Douglass hadreached the same position. “Born and reared among negro slaves,” he said,“learning their first songs and stories from their lips, they [whites] havenaturally enough adopted the negro’s manner of using his vocal organs.” Douglassrelished the “consolation” that “if blacks are too low to learn from the whites,the whites are not too high to learn from the blacks.”16[notes02.html#ch26fn_16a]No one was safe from Douglass’s acid satire, especially the “whirlpools ofsocial driftwood” who floated into the capital as office seekers and thrived onthe “buncombe” of political transactions. This included black “place hunters”who stalked Douglass and any other black men of prominence. “Get to Washingtonand find Douglass” was their battle cry. From white supplicants he had realizedthat there were “a great many more Underground Railroad Stations at the Norththan I ever dreamed of when I sorely needed one myself.” He lampooned theDistrict’s large supply of “poor white trash,” who before the war were“generally on hand when a refractory negro was to be beaten,” and they “wouldfollow the track of a negro as a dog will follow a bone, or a shark will followa slave ship.” Since the war, this class all but lived to “resent theemancipation” and tried to find occupations “by hunting, gunning, fishing, andhuckstering.” His evisceration of lobbyists and corruption all but did MarkTwain one better. Washington, according to Douglass, attracted more than itsshare of vice and crime, especially prostitution. Above all, the capital hadsimply never risen above its poisoned past of slavery and racism; every man ofstanding, black or white, seemed to require a “black boy” to do everything forthe “boss,” who wielded the whip on “the horse, the ox, the mule, or the boy.”17[notes02.html#ch26fn_17a] Douglass’s satirical voice had never been in betterform.This remarkable speech entertained his biracial Baltimore audience in May 1877,but as excerpts appeared in national papers, calls for Douglass’s political headrang out. Petitions circulated in the capital (allegedly they reached a total oftwenty thousand signatures) demanding that President Hayes remove Douglass fromoffice. The Washington Star called his appointment as marshal a mistake. Someinfluential blacks, especially John Mercer Langston, disassociated themselvesfrom Douglass’s parodies of white Washingtonians. Under several days ofheadlines such as “An Insulted City,” the National Republican ran many pages ofcommentary on Douglass’s notorious speech, calling it a “gratuitous and stupidinsult” to the city. The Washington Chronicle called for him to step down, andthe Gazette, a Democratic paper, characterized Douglass as an “inspired liar,” a“dirty befouler,” and an ungrateful “pet lamb” of the Republicans. Another paperwrote that Douglass, the “blatant blatherskite,” got away with his slanders onlybecause he was black.18 [notes02.html#ch26fn_18a]Douglass responded as best he could to these condemnations. His office was inthe District of Columbia City Hall, where on May 12 he was confronted by areporter who asked him to confirm or deny parts of the speech. Douglassresponded that he had been “misquoted,” and that “all the good . . . words ofcommendation for the city and its residents” had not been reported. Thedefensive marshal wrote public letters in at least four newspapers, denying thathe had slandered anyone while reinforcing his claim that white Washingtonianshad absorbed “negro pronunciation” and “negro manner.” Still, he felt astonishedat the “tempest of rage,” said he was “not ashamed of a single sentence,” andespecially lashed back at his black critics.19 [notes02.html#ch26fn_19a] ByJune, the controversy had blown over, and the prurient press’s favorite blackcelebrity left town on a special journey.• • •Douglass was a proud man—proud of his fame, his tailored suits, his books, hiscultivated mastery of language, his physical image in photographs, his positionin the government. In April 1877, Harper’s Weekly ran a lithograph of a Douglassphotograph, showing the bearded iconic face from a left profile. That same yearhe sat for a stunning Mathew Brady photograph in Washington. By 1883 he appearedfamously on the cover of Harper’s. But he never stopped searching to unravel themystery behind his highly visible life: how a barefoot slave boy on the Wyeplantation ever made it to lecture halls in London and Edinburgh, or how awretched teenager in rags in the Talbot County courthouse jail ever made it tothe White House to discuss emancipation with Lincoln. Douglass could neverentirely believe his own myth even as he forged it; often he asked himself, Howdid I get here? In mid-June 1877 he decided for the first time in forty-oneyears to return to the Eastern Shore, to St. Michaels, and to meet with an agingand infirm Thomas Auld. Douglass had spent much of his public life seeking andexplaining vengeance; but retribution alone was not enough. By the late 1870s hestill desperately sought knowledge of his patrimony, his birthday, the meaningof his roots in what was once a place of pain and among relationships he wouldrecall with “extremest abhorrence.” He was a genius at fashioning his story ofascendance, but also forever in search of a lost past that might allow him astable psychic peace.20 [notes02.html#ch26fn_20a] For complex reasons he alsoneeded to exercise some forgiveness. Public vengeance and distrust for theslaveholding South lived in Douglass alongside a solicitude for the people whohad owned him. Only in immersing himself in that contradiction could he trulygain self-knowledge.In Baltimore, at Fell’s Point, Douglass boarded the steamer Matilda for anovernight trip down the Chesapeake Bay, the water highway that had carried somany of his dreams. On board the two-hundred-foot stern-wheeler wereapproximately a hundred blacks, like Douglass on a brief holiday. The ship hadno real accommodations, and Douglass reportedly found the behavior of his fellowpassengers appalling. With banjos strumming, dancing ensued, liquor bottles werepassed; revelers made loud noise all night and relieved themselves over the deckrailings. With his sense of racial pride and class dignity insulted, theBaltimore Sun recorded Douglass complaining that “100 colored people aboard madeas much noise as 500 whites would have done.” In his speech made at a picnicground in St. Michaels a day later, he preached to the blacks assembled, “Wemust not talk about equality until we can do what white people can do. As longas they can build vessels and we cannot, we are their inferiors. . . . As longas they can found governments and we cannot, we are their inferiors.”21[notes02.html#ch26fn_21a] This harsh language flowed from Douglass when he feltembarrassed by some of his people. At this stage of life, his class statusseemed easily offended. Such were the contradictions of his chosen path ofleadership. The paragon of respectability found some of the fun-loving habits ofthe recently emancipated unsavory. Douglass much preferred violins to banjos.Image [../images/f0592-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, Washington, DC, 1877. Matthew Brady photographer.When Douglass arrived in St. Michaels, he found a town where most blacks stilllived in shacks and their economic conditions had not changed much since the endof slavery. A crowd of blacks and whites followed him as he strolled throughstreets. Many came up to shake his hand, and although his sister Eliza was notamong them, a group of younger Mitchells (her extended family) and other kinfolkjoined the impromptu parade. In this sleepy oyster-harvesting and boatbuildingtown, Douglass must have appeared like some tall, leonine, white-haired Africanruler returning in Western clothing. He later called this homecoming “strangeenough in itself,” but that he was about to meet his former master was “stillmore strange.” A messenger brought word that Auld had agreed to see him at thehome of the old man’s daughter and son-in-law, Louisa and William H. Bruff. Thegawking entourage followed him to the corner of Cherry Street and Locust Lane,where, as Dickson Preston, our best chronicler of Douglass’s returns to theEastern Shore, wrote, “It was the first time that a black man had ever entered awhite home in St. Michaels by the front door, as an honored guest.”22[notes02.html#ch26fn_22a]Auld was sick, bedridden, his hands “palsied,” as Douglass described him. Thetwo men met for about twenty minutes in an emotional, humane encounter of pastand present. Douglass thought he was witnessing Auld on his deathbed, althoughthe former slaveowner would not die for two and a half more years. Asautobiographer, Douglass re-created this drama with a customary vividness andirony. He entitled the chapter “Time Makes All Things Even”; he did not say timecures all ills, nor had he “begged” for Auld’s “forgiveness,” as the BaltimoreSun’s reporter claimed. But he may have revealed a deep yearning to heal his ownsoul, to find a purging of his scarred memory, to forgive in a way that helpedhim to finally declare publicly his survival and triumph. In much of Christiantradition—in which Douglass had learned to think and write—the forgiver oftenforgives for his own sake, not to excuse the oppressor. He forgives tostrengthen his own heart, to work through grief, pain, loss, and hatred.Douglass had striven long and far and come to see that some self-understandingmay rest at the end of the precept “Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven.”23[notes02.html#ch26fn_23a] Former slave met former owner, but Douglass neededthis meeting most.In part, Douglass used the reunion to try to demonstrate a changed country asmeasured in his own life. Auld had “made property to my body and soul,” wrotethe memoirist, “reduced me to a chattel, hired me out to a noted slave-breakerto be worked like a beast and flogged into submission.” In turn, Douglass hadtraveled the world, making his old master’s “name and his deeds familiar . . .in four different languages” as the symbol of all that was evil in Americanslavery. For so many years Douglass had wreaked a prophetic vengeance onslavery, slaveholders, the Confederacy, their memory, and all they stood for.Now, in a bedroom of an old brick house in St. Michaels, Maryland, nearby whereAuld had whipped Fred Bailey and rented him down the road to Edward Covey, itwas as if the aging Douglass glimpsed his own mortality and his own frailhumanity way down beneath all the brilliant antislavery rhetoric. Douglassirresistibly went to the sick man’s bedside and suddenly found himself “holdinghis [Auld’s] hand and in friendly conversation with him in a sort of finalsettlement of past differences preparatory to his stepping into his grave, whereall distinctions are at an end, and where the great and the small, the slave andhis master, are reduced to the same level.”24 [notes02.html#ch26fn_24a]So Douglass went to St. Michaels to declare his equality, and in a way topractice a self-renewing forgiveness. He was the one dispensing the equality.With words, he was trying to bury slavery once and for all in the very soil ofhis birth. The entire nation’s sins were still in desperate need of remission.“He was to me no longer a slaveholder either in fact or in spirit,” wrote thefamous black man of the obscure white man, “and I regarded him as I did myself,a victim of the circumstances of birth, education, law, and custom.” Theirmutual fates had been “determined for us, not by us.” Douglass the avengerchanged his tune as both men shed tears, one of them with hand trembling, and“ready to step into the eternal unknown.” Douglass, the former war propagandist,recalled, “Even the constancy of hate breaks down . . . before the brightness ofinfinite light.” He had long needed breaks from hating. The two men talked aboutthe past. Auld called the younger man “Marshal Douglass,” and the former slavecalled the older man “Captain Auld.” But Douglass interrupted and insisted, “NotMarshal, but Frederick to you as formerly.” The scene later caused a swirl ofprotest among younger blacks, since it was reported in papers as “just call meFred.” This made the former slave look as though he had kowtowed to the formerslaveholder; a cartoon even appeared showing Douglass kneeling as he approachedAuld.25 [notes02.html#ch26fn_25a]Douglass was keenly interested in what Auld thought of his running away, towhich the old denizen of Methodist camp meetings answered, “Frederick, I alwaysknew you were too smart to be a slave.” Douglass assured Auld that he had notrun away from “you, but from slavery; it was not that I loved Caesar less, butRome more.” Douglass apologized for his former charge that Auld had put hisgrandmother Betsy out to die. That had been, Douglass admitted, “a mistake in mynarrative.” Finally, the former Fred Bailey of mysterious patrimony even askedAuld if he could determine his [Douglass’s] birth year, to which the old masterreplied, 1818, making his guest a year younger than he had realized. That“destitution” of never knowing his birthday was now at least partially assuaged.Just why and how Auld knew the year so readily remains part of the mystery.26[notes02.html#ch26fn_26a]Douglass took such care with this account in Life and Times, he maintained,because his ever-ready critics—the “heartless triflers”—had made mischief out ofhis return to St. Michaels. He tried to set the record straight. But he alsoneeded to know if the shabby surroundings of the Eastern Shore could quiet thenoise in his soul, help him to discover just who he was now that he hadtranscended Covey’s farm for Washington’s City Hall. Douglass visited thepalsied Auld to see whether a qualified forgiveness for one slaveowner couldstill his rage against all of them. This search for self-knowledge, however, didnot in the least diminish his embrace of self-help doctrines. In his outdoorspeech that afternoon, he declared himself a lover of Maryland, a proud “EasternShoreman,” and above all, he urged the poorer black folk to “get money and keepit” and thereby demand self-respect.27 [notes02.html#ch26fn_27a] As the visit tothe Eastern Shore demonstrated, the famous Douglass now lived a life of constantconflict between public and private imperatives. He needed the beatitudes forhis own quiet reasons.A year and a half later, in the late fall of 1878, Douglass returned a secondtime to the Eastern Shore. Invited by the local Republican Party for a paidlecture, he went to speak at the Talbot County Courthouse, where he had beenjailed for plotting to escape in 1836, as well as at the Bethel and Asbury AMEChurches. This time he journeyed aboard an overnight steamer, Highland Light, onwhich he broke a color line by staying in a stateroom. The visit to Eastonbecame a kind of celebrity’s welcome. Breaking yet another color barrier,Douglass stayed at the Brick Hotel, the town’s finest, and took meals at Lowe’sTavern, just across the street from where he and the Harris brothers had beenjailed in chains, and where forty-five years earlier he had witnessedtobacco-chewing, gazing slave traders groping and sizing up their prey. Theformer slave relished all these ironies; the old prison metaphors of theNarrative gave way in Life and Times to new rushes of memory: “There stood theold jail, with its white-washed walls and iron gratings, as when in my youth Iheard its heavy locks and bolts clank behind me.” The nearly eighty-year oldJoseph Graham, former sheriff of Talbot County and the man who had lockedDouglass in that jail so long ago, attended the lecture in the courthouse,welcoming the former inmate and shaking his hand.28 [notes02.html#ch26fn_28a]Image [../images/f0596-01.jpg]High-altitude aerial view of Bay Hundred with Kent Island and Poplar Island andWestern Shore, c. 1930. The expanse of Chesapeake Bay is in the distance.All eyes in Easton were on the tall, sixty-year-old man with the large crop ofgray hair, as he strolled the streets that had been so forbidden in his youth.An Easton Gazette reporter seemed to follow Douglass everywhere, describing a“large man of full habit, but not obese . . . his color that of a brightmulatto . . . his features not at all those of a Negro, except that there is aslight depression of the nose and spreading of the nostrils.” The two blackcongregations of Bethel and Asbury gathered to hear the returning hero on theSunday afternoon, November 24. On Monday, to a racially mixed audience crowdedinto the courthouse, Douglass gave a modified version of “Self-Made Men.” Hisspeech, according to the one account, came with two stern messages—prescriptionsfor self-help and hard work for blacks, and for whites his old plea to give thefreedman “fair play” and then “let him alone.” To the whites he further demandedthat they “not form your Ku Klux Klan and your rifle clubs to drive him [theNegro] from the polls.” The Gazette reporter thought the lecture had “thrilledevery bosom.”29 [notes02.html#ch26fn_29a]Perhaps the most poignant moment in that evening’s speech came when Douglassdescribed his daytime journey in a hired rig out to Tappers Corner, and the walkthrough fields of the farm once owned by Aaron Anthony, to the horseshoe bend inthe Tuckahoe River, searching for the exact location of his birth. LouisFreeman, a local former slave who had once lived on that same farm, accompaniedDouglass. The two of them studied the landscape and found a long gulley leadingup from the river; here was what Douglass had once remembered as the “ravine.”Grandma Betsy’s cabin was long gone, as was the old well. Douglass trudged intothe briars and brush looking for an old cedar tree. There it was, grown muchlarger than in his boyhood; he believed he had found the spot. Douglass knelt insolitude and reverence and with bare hands scooped up handfuls of soil to takeback with him to his Washington home.30 [notes02.html#ch26fn_30a]That night in the lecture, he told the assembled that he had obtained “some ofthe very soil on which I first trod.” With some of Talbot County’s dirt,Douglass now had a sacred talisman—to observe or touch, or perhaps evensmell—when he needed to reflect on the meaning of his double life on both sidesof the Chesapeake. Through his senses, it might have given him a way to payhomage to his mother and grandmother, to the blood and toil they had left inthat soil. In the Narrative Douglass told us he had no recollection of seeinghis “mother by the light of day.” In Bondage and Freedom, his more lengthyattempt to remember his mother could end only with “her grave is, as the graveof the dead at sea, unmarked, and without stone or stake.”31[notes02.html#ch26fn_31a] Bowing down on the ground where his life began, hishands shoving aside the late-November leaves, and pushing down into the coldsoil, may have been for Douglass a profoundly private way of recognizing howunsettling, unfinished, and even unattainable the story of his life trulyremained. That soil provided, though, one kind of fact he had come to theEastern Shore to find. Harriet Bailey was there somewhere; and so was he.Before leaving the Eastern Shore, Douglass paid a visit to Charleston, to thesouth in Dorchester County, the area where Harriet Tubman had hailed from. Hereconnected once again with his brother Perry, now old and infirm. Douglass tookPerry back to Washington with him, and until Perry died less than two yearslater, he lived with the Douglasses among the growing household clan. Pointingto this touching fact, an Easton Gazette reporter struggled to capture theremarkable contrasts of Douglass’s visit. Calling the story “wonderful,” theGazette fashioned a memory of it to fit both reality and mythology: “He left ourcounty under compulsion. . . . He comes back by invitation . . . not to askpardon of those whom he had disobeyed, but to extend pardon to those by whom hehad been wronged. He left as a fugitive. . . . He comes back our equal beforelaw.” As if white Marylanders could now claim Douglass in the present by erasinghis past, the paper concluded, “He left us a ‘nigger,’ he returns agentleman.”32 [notes02.html#ch26fn_32a] With a bag full of soil and his olderbrother, the marshal hurried back to the District of Columbia.• • •By the end of the 1870s, Douglass thrived, at least symbolically, at the centerof American political life. He continued in the mundane tasks of the marshal’soffice, but what he dealt with daily were the vicissitudes of fame, constantcriticism, and controversy. Douglass is a distinctive example of the nature offame in nineteenth-century America. His was a fame of achievement, thecelebrated American self-made variety. This fame was enmeshed with the country’smost compelling story of slavery, its destruction, and new visions of freedomabout which he was a prominent author. But his was also, as the historian LeoBraudy writes, a “visible . . . modern fame” that emerged in the age of “therapid growth of newspapers and magazines, the development of the railroad andthe telegraph, along with the rapid sophistication of photography.”33[notes02.html#ch26fn_33a] Douglass was a lover and student of photography, whichhe cultivated as a means of spreading his influence through his image.Over more than fifty years, 1841–1894, Douglass sat for approximately 160photographs and wrote some four essays or addresses that were in part about thecraft and meaning of pictures. In engravings and lithographs his image gracedthe pages or cover of all major illustrated papers in England and the UnitedStates. His picture was captured in all major forms of photography, from thedaguerreotype to stereographs and wet-plate albumen prints. Photographers, somefamous and some not, all across the country sought out Douglass for his image.As the historians of his image have shown, the orator performed for the camera.He especially presented himself without props, his own stunning personrepresenting African American “masculinity and citizenship.” He helped to choosethe frontispieces for his autobiographies, which carried his photograph, and heespecially sought to create for a wide audience successive images of theintelligent, dignified black man, and statesmanlike elite, at the same time heunderstood that photography had evolved into a “democratic art,” allowing almostanyone to leave an image for posterity.34 [notes02.html#ch26fn_34a] Visually, bythe 1870s and 1880s, Douglass was one of the most recognizable Americans; thedissemination of photographs of him became, therefore, a richly political act.Loved and hated, along with the living Grant and the mythic Lincoln, he was theAmerican story, and he put a face on it.Douglass instinctively loved politics and debate and never lacked for opinions.He continued to preach unapologetically to blacks about self-reliance. InFebruary 1878, at an unveiling of a print of Francis Bicknell Carpenter’s famouspainting, First Reading of the Emancipation Proclamation, at Howard University,where Douglass served as a trustee, and in the presence of President Hayes andother dignitaries, Douglass stressed the necessity of blacks learning to “buildships [and] domes,” as the path to social respect. These kinds of remarksbrought steady chastisement from some quarters. By early 1879 an Elmira, NewYork, paper accused Douglass of believing “nothing can be done” in the face ofthe collapse of Hayes’s policy of conciliation and the South’s increasedviolence and discrimination against blacks. The editorialist claimed Douglasshad “settled down in his old age” in a comfortable federal office, counselinghis people to “suffer and wait. . . . This is not the tone of his oldenspeech. . . . It is sad to see such a transformation.” Douglass had becomepathetic, said his former allies, a mere “small voice for peace.”35[notes02.html#ch26fn_35a] They got the old radical’s attention.Douglass wrote an angry letter to the Elmira Advertiser. “I never said nothingcan be done,” he roared, calling for “moral indignation” and investigations ofSouthern conditions. They had wounded him. “When the influence of office or anyother influence shall soften my hatred of tyranny and violence do not spare me;let fall upon me the lash of your keenest and most withering censure.” Hereceived plenty of censure, even from old comrades such as Samuel Porter inRochester, who cautioned him about losing his moral bearings as a politicalinsider. Douglass responded with this metaphoric assurance of his integrity:“Thanks for your gentle warning. . . . The perils are abundant in every part ofthe voyage of life—and are as abundant when nearing the shore as when in midocean. I can only promise to keep a man at the ‘mast head’ and a sharp look outand a firm hand on the helm.”36 [notes02.html#ch26fn_36a]Despite all these challenges, Douglass continued to carry the “Self-Made Men”lecture all over the American map. A typical example is a trip he made out toStaunton, Virginia, in the Shenandoah Valley in April 1879. As so often happenedwith these events, a brass band and large delegation met Douglass at the depotand escorted him first to a hotel, where local worthies called upon him, andthen to Augusta Street Methodist Church. The sanctuary was filled to therafters, reported the Valley Virginian, to see the “bright mulatto” orator. Themiddle pews were reserved for some two hundred white people, with the CityCouncil sitting up front. Blacks sat around the sides and in a balcony. A black“Jubilee Choir” sang, and then Douglass held forth for two and a half hours,performing, according to the local reporter, routines and arguments intended toentertain and please the whites.37 [notes02.html#ch26fn_37a] He allowed thewhite town fathers to feel proud of their Christian paternalism, as long as theyexercised it with benevolence.Anticipating in style and substance some of what Booker T. Washington wouldlater make legendary, Douglass prescribed self-reliance for the balcony andpeace and economic cooperation for the middle pews. “These negroes are among youand will remain with you,” declared Douglass to the Virginians. Then came theIndian analogy, devoid of any attention to the murder and mass displacement ofNative peoples under way at that very moment. “You need not expect them to dieout like the Indians. They are too fond of civilizing influences. . . . AnIndian is contented with a blanket, while a negro’s ambition is a swallow-tailedcoat; the Indians don’t like churches and steeples, while the negro thinks thehigher the steeple the nearer they are to heaven.” Douglass urged the Stauntonwhites to embrace their sturdy black neighbors in economic and politicalharmony. “They [blacks] are essentially imitative, and if by their efforts theyseek to raise themselves from poverty and attain to the excellence of goodcitizenship, give them a chance. Don’t place unnecessary obstacles in their way;let them alone, and if they die out let them die. . . . Sell them lands and letthem practice your economy and thrift.”38 [notes02.html#ch26fn_38a] Suchrhetoric may have worked in making the middle pews in a Southern church feel asocial peace on a spring afternoon. But out in the larger society at that verymoment a different, desperate movement had taken hold.In the spring and through the summer of 1879, Kansas fever, an “exodus” impulse,spread over the desperately poor tenant farming blacks of the states ofTennessee, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas. The urge to migrate to betterconditions, with the dream of land ownership and economic independence, hadrisen and fallen in parts of the South ever since emancipation. But by thespring of 1879, a perfect storm of causes and inducements coalesced to promptapproximately six thousand freedpeople and their children to head for the banksof the Mississippi River in search of steamboats. They were driven by acombination of tenant-farming debt and economic despair since the depression of1873. Most worked on “shares” of their cotton in a cash-poor economy, facedextortion practiced by landowners and furnishing merchants, and a resurgence of“bulldozing,” the night-riding violence against black cummunities. They furtherset hopeful eyes on Kansas because of some political promises of federalfinancial assistance made by their remaining Republican allies in the USCongress. And for many desperate people, a millenarian religious impulse pushedthem to the horizons seeking a new dispensation from God on their Kansas Exodusto a promised land—not of milk and honey, but of property ownership andflourishing schools in their own black-run towns a long way from pharaoh’s nightriders.39 [notes02.html#ch26fn_39a]The Kansas Exodus received enormous press attention around the country and wasfiercely debated among black leaders and their allies, even as some whiteSoutherners lowered rents on their tenants, frightened that they might losetheir laborers. Should agricultural black Southerners leave the homes and landsthey had always known and worked? Fed up with betrayal, political exclusion, andterror, many black leaders urged on the Exodus, raised money, and demanded thegovernment help finance and protect the migration. President Hayes’s policy ofconciliation toward the South in return for promises of reform, peace, andprotection of black rights from Southern Democrats had failed disastrously;indeed, Democrats took control of both houses of Congress in the elections of1878, and the Republican Party was a dying institution in the formerConfederacy. Hayes put faith in the long-term effects of education and urgedblacks to learn “industry, self-reliance, self control, economy and thrift.” Toa black educator in Florida considering migration to the Midwest in July 1879,Hayes urged, “Stay where you are. . . . You are natives of the South and you areentitled to remain there. I know you are assaulted and bulldozed, but stick.Time and the North will set you right.” In such pathetic terms, Hayes had givenup on any real federal protection for the freedmen.40 [notes02.html#ch26fn_40a]On the Exodus, with different reasoning, Douglass essentially agreed with thepresident.The Exodus inspired an extremely divisive debate. “I never found myselfmore . . . painfully at variance with leading colored men of the country,”Douglass wrote just two years later, “than when I opposed the effort to set inmotion a wholesale exodus of colored people.” In 1878 he reiterated that he hadalways, abstractly, seen such schemes of emigration as “a delusion and a scam.The white race is everywhere on the face of the globe and we could not get awayfrom them if we would.” Especially agonizing for Douglass were claims made byfellow blacks that he “had deserted to the old master class” and become “atraitor to my race.” At a mass meeting about the Exodus in New York in lateApril 1879, attended by an array of black and white former abolitionists,Douglass was loudly hissed when he was announced to speak in opposition to theKansas movement. He responded in speeches and with letters to his critics in thepress. He angrily wrote to the People’s Advocate of Washington after that paperaccused him of “turning a deaf ear to the sufferings” of the Exodusters: “Youcould hardly make a more grievous charge against me, and let me therefore askyou for the evidence upon which it is based. . . . The reputation of coloredpublic men built up by long years of public service should not be wantonlythrown away.” But this debate functioned less on evidence than on racialsolidarity and despair at Reconstruction’s failure. Blacks everywhere fiercelydisputed whether the South had become an irredeemable Egypt or a promised landstill worth fighting for. Douglass was especially wounded by critics who calledhim a “fawning sycophant” who abandoned his people.41 [notes02.html#ch26fn_41a]A target now for many disappointments among black leadership in the Gilded Age,Douglass tried to fight back. With few exceptions, such as Blanche K. Bruce andP. B. S. Pinchback, black Southern politicians who opposed mass immigration fromLouisiana or Mississippi, Douglass stood virtually alone as the major opponentof the Exodus. His celebrity brought perhaps inordinate attention to hisopinions. Black Southern politicians favored the Exodus in varying ways. So didthe legendary Sojourner Truth, who went to Kansas herself and lent moral supportto the migrants. Northern black leaders who had long been either friends orrivals of Douglass’s, such as George T. Downing, Richard T. Greener, and JohnMercer Langston, all became vocal advocates of the Exodus. Douglass held openpublic debates with Langston and Greener. Douglass further came under censure instate-level black conventions, such as one in Nashville, Tennessee, in May 1879,where the Kentucky-born Ohio State legislator Robert J. Harlan (a half brotherof Supreme Court justice John M. Harlan) argued in a widely reprinted speechthat the South had collapsed into “another Egypt” and that emigration westwardwas the freedpeople’s only remedy.42 [notes02.html#ch26fn_42a]Douglass fired some angry salvos in a speech in Baltimore in May 1879, where hevigorously rejected the equivalencies drawn by some Exodus advocates betweenprewar chattel slavery and the current plight of the freedpeople. He renewed hislong-practiced loathing of “schemes of colonization and emigration,” which hebelieved had historically hurt black people. Moreover, in a piece in theNational View, Douglass laid out ten reasons why he was opposed to this exodus.His arguments boiled down to the idea that blacks, however poor or scorned,should never give up on the revolution of emancipation, not offer an “untimelyconcession” to white racism, and never surrender on the achievement of equality.By November, Douglass was still devoting enormous time to point-by-pointattempts in newspapers to refute Langston or others.43 [notes02.html#ch26fn_43a]Douglass wrote a lengthy paper on the Exodus in September 1879 at the invitationof the American Social Science Association. He was to appear in apoint-counterpoint debate with Richard T. Greener, Harvard’s first blackgraduate, dean of the Howard University law school, and a cantankerousintellectual nemesis of Douglass’s. At the last minute Douglass did not travelto Saratoga Springs, New York, in September to the association’s annual meeting;the address was read for him by Francis Wayland III, professor and dean of theYale Law School. In this carefully crafted essay, later published with Greener’srejoinder, Douglass first demonstrated a sympathetic understanding of theeconomic plight of black Southerners and why they would feel entitled to theirright to emigrate. He delivered a robust, if somewhat naïve, analysis of theSouth’s dependence on black labor: black brawn and skill had always been the“admitted author of whatever prosperity, beauty and civilization . . . possessedby the South . . . the arbiter of her destiny.” The freedman, Douglass argued,in defiance of much evidence, had a “monopoly on the labor market” and with “nocompetitors . . . he can demand living prices with the certainty that the demandwill be complied with.” How dearly so many desperate sharecroppers wished theyhad some control over such a bargain. Naïvely, Douglass sustained his faith inthe triumph of free labor and universal manhood suffrage. It was as though thebusy marshal-orator had thrown up a psychological wall of denial in his mindabout the reality of racial oppression in the South. He believed all successfulpeople and cultures must have a “native land.” A “wandering” people, in hisview, only garnered collective disrespect.44 [notes02.html#ch26fn_44a]But at its heart the Saratoga address was a plea against what the Washingtoninsider deemed a “surrender, a premature, disheartening surrender” of the greatcauses of the Civil War era: abolitionism, emancipation, the Reconstructionamendments, equal rights, independence and self-reliance, and the USgovernment’s responsibility of protection and enforcement. In Douglass’s logic,the Exodus was an abandonment of all worthy principles; it was victory turnedinto “a miserable compromise” or, worse, into slow defeat of the second Americanrepublic. Leaving the South meant that in the long run the Confederacy had won.Douglass demanded that blacks stay and fight, with their labor and especiallytheir votes. The “possibility of power,” he argued, existed only where blackscould sustain large populations, breed their own officeholders, and prevail atthe ballot box. It was as if Douglass counseled a million desperate tenantfarmers who had watched some of their kinfolk brutalized or murdered trying tovote to bide their time and stay and fight for the dream of politicalliberalism. Douglass had always hated the arguments at the base of colonizationschemes. The Exodus was to him, therefore, an “apostleship of despair” that theold orator in the Oberlin tent in 1848, from Corinthian Hall’s stage in 1852, oron the altar of Tremont Temple in 1863 and a thousand other venues just couldnot abide.45 [notes02.html#ch26fn_45a] But a tide of history had swept over hischerished principles and left them in tatters.No matter the depth of their misery, humiliation, or hopelessness, Douglassurged black Southerners to stay put and keep fighting. In effect, he asked poorfarmers who despaired of their future to take a long view and to carry theweight of his version of the nation’s memory and history. At stake was the veryintegrity of his own story and that of Union victory. The animating center of aseries of twelve resolutions against the Exodus that he prepared for a publicgathering in Hillsdale, District of Columbia, in the summer of 1879 was hisclaim that mass migration now meant “the late rebellion will havetriumphed . . . the rebel South will have been exalted.”46[notes02.html#ch26fn_46a] So Douglass stood his ground, flailed away at bitterreality, and insisted that history, against the odds, stay on course. Those poorfarmers caught up in migration fever, however, were not playing for history;they needed safety, their own land, an escape from the furnishing merchant, andhope.Douglass was not merely “blind” and out of touch, as some biographers havecontended.47 [notes02.html#ch26fn_47a] He found himself in a position, a decadeand a half after emancipation, not unlike many leaders of the modern civilrights movement. They have to fight to protect political and constitutionaltriumphs, as well as a new national historical memory, while they also face adeepening crisis of structural repression and inequality. Douglass’s story, whenhe was heroically right as well as disappointingly wrong, was a rehearsal forthe long haul of postemancipation and post–civil rights black and progressiveleadership who have encountered foes as virulent as the Democratic Party’sSouthern Redeemers of the 1870s and much of the Republican Party in the latetwentieth and early twenty-first centuries.• • •With a $6,000 loan in 1878 from a black friend and former abolitionist RobertPurvis, Douglass purchased Cedar Hill, a house on a fifteen-acre estate on theheights in Anacostia in the southeast part of the District of Columbia. He andAnna, and parts of the extended family, moved permanently to the estate in 1878.Some forty yards or so out behind the big house, beyond the lawn where friendsand family played croquet, Douglass constructed his “growlery,” a smallsingle-room stone structure complete with a writing desk and a chaise longue. Attimes the desk may have been that of Charles Sumner, a keepsake the black leaderhad received upon the senator’s death in 1874. He borrowed the name for hiswriter’s retreat from Charles Dickens’s Bleak House. In the novel, Mr. Jarndyceestablished such a “little library of books and papers” as the “refuge” in whichhe hid when “out of humor,” the place “I come and growl.” When besieged by hislarge extended family of adult children, growing numbers of grandchildren,siblings real and fictive, his increasingly sickly wife, and assorted others,Douglass escaped to his growlery.48 [notes02.html#ch26fn_48a] Major parts of thefirst edition of Life and Times, published in 1881, were likely written there.His effort to order and control time in his final memoir masks the hiddenpressures and dilemmas of his personal life. In that realm, about which he wroteso little, Douglass experienced plenty of pain and frustration about which togrowl.As 1880 arrived, Douglass’s personal life at Cedar Hill remained a roiling hubof family joy, domestic comfort, and turmoil. The continuing financial andcareer struggles of his sons and his daughter, as they began to reach earlymiddle age with growing families, is the subtext for Douglass’s steadfast viewson black self-reliance, migration, property, the work ethic, and other values.All around him at every turn he saw necessity, striving, failure, dependence,contradiction, and more than twenty grandchildren, whom he hoped would live intothe next century in a modern, more enlightened America. The personal and thepublic were thoroughly intertwined in every day of the aging Douglass’s life. Inspeeches, such as the one he gave at a black agricultural exposition in Raleigh,North Carolina, in October 1880, one hears echoes of his family’s travails: the“greatest want” of blacks is “regular and lucrative employments”; they shouldacquire property and save money. The “want of money,” Douglass repeatedlydeclared to black workers and farmers, “is the root of very many evils.” It mayseem harsh to us today, but in this period of racial subjugation, he maintainedthat blacks were despised more for their “poverty” than for their “color.”49[notes02.html#ch26fn_49a]New life constantly flowed in and out of the universe of Cedar Hill and theDouglass clan, as Anna Murray Douglass became sometimes debilitated by illness.Douglass reported to Amy Post in April 1879 that his financial situation hadnearly “touched bottom.” He had “three families to support,” including three of“Rosa’s children . . . part of Charley’s whose wife is dead, and my old sickbrother Perry and his daughter.” Death began to visit with regularity, sometimesin natural course and sometimes with shocking alarm. Charles, who was once againunemployed, with his two children, Freddie and Joseph, eleven and nine yearsold, moved in with his brother Frederick Jr. in November. The situation musthave been tense and difficult; Frederick Jr. reported in handwritten notes inthe scrapbooks he assembled that the two children “were taken away by theirfather” on January 3, 1881, after Charles secured a job with the US CensusBureau. Moreover, on August 18, 1880, Douglass’s half brother Perry Downs diedat Cedar Hill at age sixty-seven and was buried the following day in theHillsdale cemetery.50 [notes02.html#ch26fn_50a] Many more funerals would soon beperformed and planned from Cedar Hill.Into the early 1880s Ottilie Assing remained occasionally in Douglass’s life,and often in his correspondence. With keen desire she awaited her less regular“orders,” as she put it, to come to Washington for extended visits. Some staysin Washington, she told her correspondents, were truncated or burdened by theconstant flow of cousins, grandchildren, and other “parasites” pursuing herbeloved Douglass. She unabashedly complained that son Charles was still “on thedole” in 1878 and that the family whirlwind around Cedar Hill was “uncivilized.”She never seems to have commented on the sheer challenge of all thegrandchildren for Anna, only for Assing’s admired male host. By the end of 1880,she reported a new tally of Eastern Shore kin who had arrived at Cedar Hill,including another half sister named Kitty, and her son and his wife, who wereliving in a cottage by the garden. And an eight-year-old boy had just arrived,grandchild of another half sister; Ottilie thought him a “bright boy” who couldread and write and might, therefore, bring Douglass “some joy.”51[notes02.html#ch26fn_51a]Assing loved the expansive mansion house and the grounds of nearly fifteenacres. The house had been built in 1855–59 for an architect, John Welsh VanHook. Douglass purchased the property with nine acres; over the next sixteenyears he acquired six more adjoining acres and expanded the structure fromfourteen to twenty-one rooms, adding a large new kitchen wing and remodeling theattic into new bedrooms. On her first visit in October 1878, Assing called it“one of the most beautiful places” in America, high “on top of a hill, withmagnificent old trees.” The view included the Capitol itself across the bridgeover the Anacostia River. The grounds and stables included horses and cows, andOttilie especially enjoyed sitting on the grass and playing with a calf. But shenever wrote to her friend Sylvester Koehler about her time at Cedar Hill withoutswipes at the domestic situation. The grandchildren included at one point a“completely uncivilized” girl of six years, “so backward” that even “Mrs.Douglass” could not provide “educational influence.” A one-year-old boy, sheobserved, was a “miserable, weakly child,” about whom she thought it a“veritable crime” to have brought him into the world. Once again, Anna, as wellas Rosetta, who was frequently in and out of the house with her own sixchildren, somehow coexisted with Assing, if not with her attitudes. In an 1878letter to Douglass, Ottilie left a revealing self-description: “I am so entirelyunlike the majority of men that I cannot well consider myself at all a standardby which to measure the feelings and sensations of others. A queer andunfortunate mixture of earthly and unearthly matter!”52[notes02.html#ch26fn_52a] Did Douglass sigh with pain or laughter or both? Hewas losing patience.By the late 1870s Assing sometimes grumbled about “not receiving my weeklyallowance” (a letter from Douglass). He rarely visited her and her friends inHoboken anymore, since that group had begun to disperse and she found her lifethere increasingly lonely and, as she wrote in late 1878, “quieter and moreboring every year.” Assing frequently referred to her Hoboken circle of friendswith the German word Bande, which denotes close emotional, almost kinshiplike,ties. Her Bande had been dissolving and she was adrift.53[notes02.html#ch26fn_53a]The relationship with Douglass was in its last stage as Ottilie quarreledmightily with her sister over their estate, fell into depressions, and onceagain, indecisively, planned a trip to Europe. In late summer 1878, Douglassexpressed “apprehensions” about her potential visit, and apparently about theirfriendship itself, although we do not know precisely what he said. Some kind of“experiment” had been proposed, possibly about her staying away. “My feelingsfor you can never change,” she wrote painfully, “but if all this, after all, isnothing to you, or if you anticipate for yourself more pain than pleasure, youknow that you can shake me off whenever you please. Border State [Anna] is mysmallest trouble. I think I have shown my diplomatic tact by getting along withher nearly twenty years without any serious trouble.” Douglass and Assing wereundergoing a slow, if affectionate, breakup. There would be further visits toWashington until Assing sailed for Germany for the final time in August 1881.From a subordinate position, Assing continued to judge and try to micromanageher friend’s ideas, actions, and financial decisions. She forever insisted onher absolutist approach to the “monster” of religion, and on one remarkableevening in late 1880, the two of them paid a visit to the home of a famousagnostic, Robert Ingersoll. The two had enriched, if complicated, each other’slife in countless ways, and Douglass did not give up easily on this long-termrelationship rooted in intellectual power. She still bought him cigars, and herejoiced that he could “yet write without spectacles.” Her letter to him withthe profoundly sad offer that he could “shake” her when he pleased, ended withOttilie’s sudden, mundane spouselike question “Are you sufficiently insured?”54[notes02.html#ch26fn_54a]From as early as late 1878, Assing became aware that Douglass’s huge family wasnot her only competition as the much-younger forty-year-old Helen Pitts enteredDouglass’s circle of friends. Born in Honeoye, New York, of parents with strongabolitionist and feminist backgrounds, well educated at Mount Holyoke Collegeand a former teacher in freedmen’s schools during the Civil War, Pitts firstvisited her uncle Hiram Pitts in Washington in the summer of 1878. Smart,outgoing, a lover of music, and adroit with her strong views on women’s rights,Helen met the marshal and later got a job in his office. She also becameinvolved with the journal Alpha, a publication of the Moral Education Society.55[notes02.html#ch26fn_55a]Assing detested, as she was also threatened by, Helen Pitts. After meeting herand participating in conversations, Ottilie wrote to Douglass with a venomouspen. Discussing press coverage about the orator’s reputation, she remarked, “Ianticipated nothing better on the part of the Pitts set and those connected withthem. Mrs. Pitts [Helen was not married] is a crafty plotting woman.” Ottilieseemed convinced that Helen was trying to extract money for some scheme fromDouglass and offered strong unsolicited advice. “The falling off in Mrs. Pitts’visits I should however consider a gain at any rate. There is a distressing lackof genuineness about her, which I imagine even to notice in her face.” Assing’sscorn utterly transparent, she spared Douglass none of her bitter emotions. Shehated Alpha, calling it “infamous,” and claiming that “no good and pure-mindedwoman can advocate those monstrous doctrines . . . [of] obscene stuff hiddenunder religious cant.” The magazine promoted combinations of religious faith,feminism, and women’s education and equal rights. Only someone, Assing held, whowas “incurably and irredeemably stupid” could support such a journal.56[notes02.html#ch26fn_56a] Such early denunciations of Helen came as Anna,ignored by the absolutist Ottilie, was still very much alive. There was only onefuture Mrs. Douglass, and Ottilie Assing struggled hopelessly against theknowledge that it was not her."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 27--------------------------------------------------------------------------------JOYS AND SORROWS AT CEDAR HILLMy joys have far exceeded my sorrows and my friends have brought me far morethan my enemies have taken from me.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1881The Douglasses were blessed with some twenty-one grandchildren, and at any giventime many of them were either living at or visiting Cedar Hill. According to oneof them, Fredericka Sprague Perry, the fifth of Rosetta’s seven children, whowrote an extraordinary memoir about her grandfather in 1941, Frederick Douglasswas “the best play fellow” a child could ever want. When at home, the patriarchdaily observed “two distinct periods . . . his Work-time and his Play-time.”When at work behind his “closed study door,” remembered Fredericka, who was bornin 1872, the children knew that their grandfather would be “greatly displeasedby our noise.” They would “tip-toe down the hall” in anticipation. When the door“swung back on its hinges, we knew we were in for fun!”1[notes02.html#ch27fn_1a]Douglass stood with his legs braced apart, his large stout frame ready for theonslaught. Taking the smallest child up on his shoulder, and with several othershanging on to arms, legs, and coattail, he would, “singing and shouting, marchdown the hall” toward the kitchen, where Grandma Anna stood amused anddistressed, “supervising preparation for the evening meal.” In this idealizeddomestic remembrance, perfected by time, the grandpa in his sixties would oftengo to all fours and play horse. As the children clamored on his broad back,Fredericka recalled that the “prize seat was nearest the head—nearly on his neckso that his long hair might serve as reins and away we would gallop.” The girlsespecially loved to run their hands in Douglass’s ample head of hair (“thick butnot kinky”), and he loved having the oldest among them comb and braid it. Inquiet evening moments, the grand old man with “closed eyes” would sit an hour ata time as two girls brushed and tied the “silvery locks” into “tightbraids . . . independently stiff” and touched off on the ends with “variouscolored ribbons.” Douglass loved having his hair so treated, as it left him in a“peaceful countenance.” No one but the family ever saw this image, whichoccasioned much-needed laughter and shared bliss for Frederick and Anna. Onetime, Fredericka reported, this reverie was interrupted by the doorbell and animportant formal visitor. Douglass rushed to his bedroom, Anna and Rosetta intow, to “restore the head to its normal style of hair dress” to greet the guest,as giggly girls scampered to other corners of the house.2[notes02.html#ch27fn_2a]Douglass’s favorite outdoor game was croquet; the backyard of the A Streethouse, and especially the more spacious grounds at Cedar Hill, saw many suchfamily competitions for young and old. Ottilie Assing wrote of playing croquetwith a group of Douglasses in the hilltop space between the house and thegrowlery in summer weather. Once it was playtime, the children enjoyed“carefree, unrestrained freedom” around their grandfather, Fredericka reported.The extended family caused his financial burdens and numerous adult conflicts,but Douglass loved to entertain the children and let himself go. In the ceilingof the front porch of Cedar Hill, Douglass attached two “rubber-covered springrods,” about twenty inches long. Each had a ring, and the adventurous couldelevate and hang or do chin-ups from the handles. With his large body swingingin air, Douglass would dangle from these rings, the young children dancing andsquealing at his feet as he kicked and shoved them about. This is hardly thetextbook image of the noble, serious Douglass we have from his photographs, butthe large, burly man pulling himself up and down, with “flying feet,” is howFredericka and her mates could remember him. They adored their “big playmate,”their “mischievous tease,” and their “idolized teacher,” who, Frederickaclaimed, instructed them about the “beauty of generosity.” What child would notthrill to have her grandfather transform into a human tree, “stand perfectlyerect, feet in bracing position, shoulders squared . . . and arms extendedstraight out even with the shoulders,” bidding each child to clasp one of hisarms and “swing her body from the ground.” The “grandpa . . . full of life andenergy” wrested a coveted joy from this endless swarm of love and adoration.3[notes02.html#ch27fn_3a] It must have left all concerned with memories of Annasmiling and laughing, although no one ever wrote about her quite that way. Joyand sorrow lived together at Cedar Hill.Image [../images/f0612-01.jpg]Cedar Hill, c. 1891. Douglass is standing at left, and likely his wife, HelenPitts Douglass, with her sister Jennie at right on the porch.In the presidential election of 1880, Douglass campaigned for candidate James A.Garfield wherever Republicans allowed him to go. In this firstpost-Reconstruction presidential contest, Douglass’s voice and symbolic servicewere less important to his party than in the Grant and Hayes administrations.For a while the old abolitionist’s star faded, eclipsed to a degree by the sheersordidness and fury of Gilded Age politics, in which he was a practicinginsider, and by a new generation of black leaders eager to shove the “Grand OldMan” from his pedestal. In February of that year Douglass’s reputation sufferedas he endured two days of testifying in the Capitol before Congress’s SelectCommittee to Investigate the Freedmen’s Savings and Trust Company. In thehearings he told the story of the demise of the bank on his watch six yearsearlier, and of his $10,000 investment, which he did recoup. He admitted underoath that he “knew nothing about banking; my life had been a theoretical onerather than a practical one—on the stump—and I hesitated about it until I waspersuaded that as the colored people of the country generally had confidence inme.” In this public testimony, Douglass halfheartedly took responsibility, butlaid greater blame for the bank’s failure on other managers who made sure thathe as president had been “kept ignorant” of the institution’s real conditionuntil it was too late. It was not Douglass’s finest hour; he was treated fairly,since his good friend Senator Blanche Bruce chaired the committee.4[notes02.html#ch27fn_4a]Garfield, the former Civil War general, nine-term congressman from Ohio, andHayes loyalist with whom Douglass enjoyed only a distant and formalrelationship, was the unlikely dark-horse standard-bearer of the Republicans inthe raucous election of 1880. Deep fissures ran through American party politicsthat year. The Democrats controlled a relatively solid South and staked theirfuture nationally on white supremacy. Republicans were divided into two broadideological camps, both of which devoted decreasing attention to black rights.The Stalwart faction, led by Senator Roscoe Conkling, the extraordinarilycorrupt and arrogant boss politician of New York City, originally took its namefrom staunch opposition to Hayes’s “let alone” policy toward the South duringReconstruction. By 1880, however, this class of elected officeholders managed avast patronage system, especially fee-based federal and state bureaucracies,that opposed civil service reform and fought to sustain the spoils system ofappointments for the party faithful. Stalwarts still gave lip service to supportof freedmen’s rights but offered little in the way of action.The second bloc among Republicans, known as the Half-Breeds, emerged aroundJames G. Blaine, the senator from Maine. Blaine, a tall, natural politician,champion debater, and personal rival of Garfield’s since the two enteredCongress in 1863, had led occasional opposition to Grant from within theRepublican Party, especially in response to the scandals of the general’s secondterm. Half-Breed was at first an epithet against this group, but as Grant-eracorruption tainted the party at the end of Reconstruction, the term became apositive moniker. Half-Breeds tended to be more open to civil service reformand, generally, more fiscally conservative.5 [notes02.html#ch27fn_5a]Some vestiges of the Civil War–era Republican “party of Lincoln” still limpedalong, alive but crippled. The center of gravity in American politics hadshifted decidedly to the Midwest, although it did not contain the nation’sprimary centers of patronage and wealth. The Republican Party had now largelybecome a vessel of big business, of corporate enterprise, of sound money backedby specie, and antilabor, especially since the violent nationwide Great RailroadStrike of 1877, when Hayes had used the US army to crush union militants. Manyconservative moral and social reform organizations of the era also drewthousands of adherents. The Christian lobby and groups such as the Women’sChristian Temperance Union worked for laws against polygamy, obscenity, andalcohol. Intellectual liberal reformers, led by William Dean Howells, worriedendlessly about what they deemed “dangerous tendencies in American life,” suchas hostility to property, the “excesses” of universal suffrage, the masses ofimmigrants gaining access to the printing press and the ballot. OlderProtestant, educated elites feared Eastern European immigrants, labor unions andanti-monopolism, lawless mobs, and socialism. Some third parties emerged aswell, particularly the Greenback Party, made up of workers, farmers, and somesocialists who advocated the paper money printed so successfully during theCivil War. The Greenback insurgency was a threat to Republicans in somelocalities, but in 1880 it garnered just over three hundred thousand votes.6[notes02.html#ch27fn_6a] The abolitionists’ heyday of holy crusades against theevil of slavery were long gone.In such a rapidly shifting social landscape, the divided Republicans met fortheir nominating convention in Chicago in June. Feeling less welcome, Douglass,still marshal in the District of Columbia, did not attend. Although he tilted toand fro on some issues, Douglass remained a Stalwart and supported a third runby Grant. Indeed, he later admitted that “Mr. Garfield, though a good man, wasnot my man for the presidency . . . even defeat with Grant was better thansuccess with a temporizer.” In pre-campaign speeches Douglass had firmly statedhis disappointment with Hayes’s Southern policy, creating distance from hisbenefactor. Another candidacy at the convention, seen as an alternative, wasthat of John Sherman, another Ohioan and secretary of the treasury under Hayes,and brother of the famous general William T. Sherman. James Garfield, thebookish, studious reader of economics and spreadsheets, former soldier and Ohiofarm boy turned intellectual as well as experienced congressional-committeechairman, openly supported Sherman and claimed not to be interested in thepresidency. But a less than secret campaign elevated him to the top of theticket as a way out of the morass in which the party found itself. Thedeadlocked convention broke open on the thirty-sixth ballot of a tempestuousgathering of eight hundred delegates and fifteen thousand spectators andnominated Garfield for president. As his running mate, and as a sop to Conklingand the patronage-drunk Stalwarts, Garfield chose Chester A. Arthur, a handsomeman-about-town New Yorker who had never held elective office but had occupiedthe lucrative position of collector of the Port of New York.7[notes02.html#ch27fn_7a]For their part Democrats nominated a more famous Civil War general, WinfieldScott Hancock, the Pennsylvanian who had held the center of the Union line atthe battle of Gettysburg. Hancock had no political record to defend, rarelyappeared in any capacity in civilian life, and held a quiet army administrativepost on Governors Island in New York harbor. He did not cut a dashing militaryfigure anymore; since the war a sedentary life had made him a rotund andrelatively immobile three hundred pounds. Hancock was willing to don the mantlesof both white supremacy and reform while the Democrats ran a scurrilouslynegative campaign against the alleged corruption of Garfield’s and Conkling’sminions. Neither side had a corner on hypocrisy or mischief in this election,and both proved why American politics in the Gilded Age was such rich terrainfor satirists. In Henry Adams’s novel Democracy, anonymously published in 1880,the ambitious widow Madeleine Lightfoot Lee marvels at the corruption sheobserves in Washington. “What deeper abyss could have opened under the nation’sfeet,” she wonders, as she asks the most powerful man in the Senate his view.“The pleasure of politics lay in the possession of power,” answers SilasRatcliffe. “Here I am and here I mean to stay.”8 [notes02.html#ch27fn_8a]Much was at stake nevertheless in an election that turned out 9 million votersand which Garfield only narrowly won by a plurality of fewer than ten thousandvotes. That the Republicans nearly lost to such a weak and uninspiring Democratdemonstrates how vulnerable they were in 1880. Garfield ran a vague campaign; hefavored such good generalities as free and unintimidated voting rights, civilservice reform by Congress, popular education, high tariffs, and improvednavigation on the Mississippi River, while opposing the doctrine of statesovereignty, sectarian (meaning Catholic) schools, “doubtful financialexperiments” such as greenbacks, and any increase in Chinese immigration.Garfield steered clear of labor rights, a proposed graduated income tax, or anyregulation of large corporations. Douglass joined the canvass as a proudly loyalparty man, especially in upstate New York and on one long speaking excursion toIndiana. Undoubtedly, the orator hoped for a second federal appointment out ofthe new Republican president; despite lacking passion for the nominee of theparty, he knew where the interests of African Americans lay. He had no problemwith Republican antilabor positions; he too opposed unions, especially ifsegregated, and he enjoyed stressing that Garfield was a genuine self-made man.9[notes02.html#ch27fn_9a] Given the bold-faced white supremacy of the Democrats,Douglass still saw the Republicans as his only political home.Campaign rhetoric elicited from Douglass a storehouse of wit and sarcasm. Heenjoyed few things more in his older years than strapping the Democratic Partyto a metaphorical stake and lashing it with an old antislavery whip. He was amaster of the bloody shirt and the perfect partisan on the stump. As historianSean Wilentz has argued, Americans have for more than two centuries distrustedpolitical parties and, in a dreamlike, ahistorical fashion, wished for apolitics above partisanship. Not Douglass. By experience—from learning throughthe crises of the Civil War to filter his radicalism through a hard-earnedpragmatism, to seeing emancipation and Radical Reconstruction emerge from aparty’s aggressive action—Douglass understood that great historical change camewhen a party decided to step out amid the currents of history and lead. Althoughit always required some compromise of personal moral belief, there was no moreloyal party man in 1880 than the Republican Douglass; if only he could nowpersuade his party to stand up to the resurgent white South and not treat itwith, as he feared, a “sickly conciliation.”10 [notes02.html#ch27fn_10a]In Elmira, New York, on August 3, 1880, at a West Indian Emancipation Daycelebration, Douglass delivered a typical campaign address. The large outdooraudience in Hoffman’s Grove included hundreds of blacks. The orator spoke fortwo hours from a prepared manuscript, a formality he employed more and more inhis older years. He reminded the audience that at this hour the “fourteenth andfifteenth amendments . . . are practically of no force or effect” in the South.The canvass, he maintained, was not about personalities; it was about the“merits of parties.” Trust the Republican Party and its history, he especiallyurged the black voters, whatever they thought of the candidates. He did honorGarfield as a man of intellect, “devoted to art and science.” Douglass madedistinctions between the soldier Hancock, who was the product of West Point, andGarfield, who was a patriotic volunteer during the war. Douglass spoke ofhistory—of the war—as a past his listeners must summon. Democrats were theparty, said Douglass, of slavery, secession, treason, and rebellion. Theirhistory was “hoary with years and gory with crime.” They had dragged the nationthrough war and opposed the abolition of slavery and the enfranchisement of thefreedmen in peace. With his black audience he drew upon biblical sanction: “Thesins of the fathers descend to the children even unto the third and fourthgeneration.” And lest they entertain any doubts, Douglass declared that eachblack voter must remember his sacred obligation laid down in his version ofPsalm 137: “May my hand forget its cunning and my tongue cleave to the roof ofmy mouth if ever I raise my voice or give my vote for the nominees of theDemocratic party.”11 [notes02.html#ch27fn_11a]In September and October, Douglass barnstormed across upstate New York andespecially in Indiana, which proved in one election after another to be acrucial swing state for the Republicans. At every stop he presented the electionas “the same old question of the war.” It was “national supremacy against statesupremacy,” the “civilization of the South or the civilization of the North.” Herecycled his old mythos about the “free spirit” and principles that had builtthe Republican Party arriving on the Mayflower in New England, while a “cargo oftwenty slaves” with the “bull-whip, the chain, the fetters” of the South hadarrived on the James River in Virginia. Douglass was brilliant at the politicsof memory.12 [notes02.html#ch27fn_12a]In some cities in Indiana, such as at the fairgrounds in Indianapolis, he woulddeliver as many as three outdoor speeches in one day. On September 5, anothercrowd of four thousand had to be turned away since Douglass had lost his voice.Two days later, he mustered voice enough to speak to three thousand inPendleton, Indiana, on the very site where he had been mobbed and injured in1843; some attendees in 1880 had been there thirty-seven years earlier. Thepress reported Douglass taking breaks in the middle of addresses and speaking ina “calm, deliberate manner.” To a Kokomo audience he told of a Quaker womannamed Miss Minnie Trueblood who had helped save him from the anti-abolition mobof yesteryear. At many other stops, Douglass waved the bloody shirt on behalf ofthe party as much as for Garfield.13 [notes02.html#ch27fn_13a] He was greeted asan iconic celebrity from the abolitionist past appearing like a risen spirit inthe present.“Mr. Douglass arose . . . and at the sight of his old gray head,” said theMadison Daily Evening Star, “the cheer that went up nearly lifted the crowd offits feet. It was like the roar of the hurricane through the pines, like therushing of the mighty waters.” Douglass thrived on the cheers and soaked in theroar. But his voice had mostly failed again and he announced awkwardly that hecould not speak in the open. So the old lion said he would adjourn to thecourthouse and address as many of the throng there as could occupy the space.“He placed his fingers to his mouth and blew a loud shrill whistle which stoppedand startled the crowd,” a reporter wrote. Then Douglass led the procession tothe indoor venue. He was so prominent in the Indiana campaign that his image,with flying white hair, appeared up front in a September 29 cartoon in Puck,showing an almost infinite array of people, from politicians to farm wives withbabes in their arms, all standing on stumps over the caption “Great PoliticalExcitement in Indiana: The Whole State on the Stump.”14[notes02.html#ch27fn_14a]Image [../images/f0618-01.jpg]“Great Political Excitement in Indiana,” Puck, September 29, 1880. Douglassespecially campaigned for the Republican presidential candidate each electionyear in Indiana.As an autobiographer, Douglass dwelt at length on Garfield’s inauguration inMarch 1881, on his shocking assassination later that summer by the derangedStalwart Republican office seeker Charles Guiteau, and especially on Douglass’sown place in these dramas. As marshal, Douglass had the privilege of marchingnext to the outgoing and incoming presidents, ushering their procession from theSenate chamber through the Capitol rotunda to the back portico for the swearingin and inaugural address. He placed himself, and thereby black people, at thecenter of this presidential story. On the “day of glory” (inauguration),Douglass stressed that he, in his symbolic role, “was treading the high placesof the land,” and because of him, “the colored man could occupy this height” aswell. As before, he reminded his readers that here was Fred Bailey, the“unlettered slave,” escorting presidents through the US Capitol.15[notes02.html#ch27fn_15a] These images are almost that of the butler performinghis careful duties at the ceremonies of the highborn and the powerful. But henever stopped playing the representative man, which he considered a duty.Although always wishing to be the creature of his own heroic making, he admittedthat he, “like many others,” had been “tossed by the late war to the surface.”When he turned to the assassin and the issue of patronage at the root of thetragic crime, Douglass left a trenchant, if ironic, characterization of GildedAge office seeking. Much of the pomp and enthusiasm at a presidentialinauguration, he argued, was both false and purposeful: “To the office-seekerthe whole is gone through with as a mere hollow, dumb show. It is not uncommonto hear men boast of how much they did for the victorious party. . . . Themadness of Guiteau was but the exaggerated madness of other men.”16[notes02.html#ch27fn_16a] Douglass lived in the midst of this world of gladhands, gleaming smiles, and scheming eyes in pursuit of money and place. And heunderstood what happened when the cheering stopped.Garfield’s brief presidency turned into a macabre spectacle; Douglass could notlet it go without a prolonged reminiscence of his meeting with the presidentonly three weeks before the shooting, when they discussed the chief executive’sdesire to appoint some black men to foreign-service posts. Most important,Douglass made the best of what was for him a demotion from marshal to therecorder of deeds for the District. All those speeches, the backbreaking travel,the sore throats in Indiana, had resulted in what Douglass lamely claimed was aposition less onerous, with no social obligations, and more time for writing andspeaking. Douglass had likely allowed himself to hope for something much higher,perhaps a cabinet post. No less than Mark Twain had written to Garfield onDouglass’s behalf suggesting such a position. The famed writer had been moved,he said, by the former slave’s “history.”17 [notes02.html#ch27fn_17a] But therecorder swallowed the insult, rejoiced that no black man had ever held thisoffice either, and did his duty. As ever, with the extended family pressing downon his resources, he needed the money, and he did have writing to do.• • •In the summer of 1881, during the drama of the assassination of Garfield and thepresident’s prolonged and highly publicized deathbed watch, Douglass finishedand published his Life and Times. Sometime in 1879 or 1880 he had begun work onthis third, long autobiography. The book garnered considerable publicity andfanfare even as its sales were disappointing. Ottilie Assing had offeredoccasional advice as he planned to write about his life from where Bondage andFreedom had left off in the 1850s. She reminded him of the great men and eventsin his epic life, urging him to reach for literary fame one more time by writingthe “sequel” of his life’s story.18 [notes02.html#ch27fn_18a]For Douglass, the return to telling his narrative a third time was as renewingas it was risky and difficult. Life and Times would be an aging man’s summing upof his tale, a journey into and out of his memory. That constant quest inwriting to grasp and explain his personal past may tell us much about whyDouglass clung so fiercely to his views on black self-reliance, on faith invoting and political solutions, and on forging an abolitionist memory of theCivil War epoch. The memory was both retrievable and not; it was bracing,startling, and had to somehow be harnessed in the service of a narrative aboutincreasing fame and achievement. This search for himself again in the storybookof his life was never as easy to achieve as he wished. In Life and Times heceases his description of experience at one point and reflects, “When one hasadvanced far in the journey of life . . . and has had many and strangeexperiences of shadow and sunshine, when long distances of time and space havecome between him and his point of departure, it is natural that his thoughtsshould return to the place of his beginning . . . to revisit scenes of his earlyrecollection, and live over in memory the incidents of his childhood.” It was asthough he hoped that telling his story once again, and constantly revising it,might bring symmetry to his life in the present.19 [notes02.html#ch27fn_19a] Butgreat change would soon once again sweep over Douglass’s affairs, public andprivate; during his remaining fourteen years he robustly lived looking ahead inreal time, while he also lived, as a writer, inside the inscrutable, if magical,power of memory.Life and Times, both the first and the revised and updated edition of 1892, hasalways been at least two remarkable, if confounding, things: first, anindispensable source for at least the last forty years of Douglass’s life; andsecond, a repeatedly revised, sometimes exhilarating, and sometimes torpidmemoir about the accomplishments of a Gilded Age gentleman who conquered some ifnot all racial boundaries, and who rose from radical outsider to insecureinsider. On most of the 620 pages Douglass sought a unity for the theory of theAmerican self-made man. He hoped to make his own life a kind of monument, anedifice so strong that no surge of racism, no embittered rivalry, no lynch mob,no conservative Supreme Court decision, no Lost Cause romance, nor even theravages of time could tear down. Life and Times is memoir as a living museumdesigned to repudiate the unpredictable fates of America’s racial history.Whatever might occur in the future, whatever forms white supremacy might take,Douglass wanted to be sitting there for us to gaze at, his story there as boldrefutation.Douglass believed that the United States had undergone apocalyptic regenerationin the Civil War; so too, as the autobiographer kept trying to demonstrate, hadhe. Hence, almost by definition, after the revolution and the constitutionalremaking of the nation, Douglass could not sustain a revolutionary voice. Thequest for freedom had inspired a heroic literary style; the achievement offreedom flattened out the story’s trajectory, even the prose. In the self-madehero’s autobiographical life, the story of becoming free had always been moredramatic than being free. Or, as the critic Darryl Pinckney put it in assessingblack autobiography generally, “hell has more and better details.”20[notes02.html#ch27fn_20a]On the next-to-last page of the 1881 edition of Life and Times, Douglassannounced that he had “lived several lives in one: first the life of slavery;secondly, the life of a fugitive from slavery; thirdly, the life of comparativefreedom; fourthly, the life of conflict and battle; and fifthly, the life ofvictory, if not complete, at least assured.”21 [notes02.html#ch27fn_21a] He hadsuffered and overcome, he instructs his reader. He had persevered throughhopelessness, led his people through the fiery trial, and reached a personaltriumph. His story was no longer merely the ascension from slavery to freedom,but elevation to citizenship, to self-worth. In Douglass’s five stages for hislife, we see his self-image as the lost fugitive risen to racial and nationalleader, the person and the nation regenerated and redeemed together. Thesepassages are revealing of both the public persona he so wished to portray, thefamous man looking at himself as he let others see him, and the private man whobelieved desperately that he had to live out and embody the image he hadcreated.To some of his readers at the time, and certainly to some critics today, thistale about the “fruits of victory” can seem strange and out of place. But Lifeand Times fit into as it led the genre of black autobiography during the GildedAge. William Wells Brown, John Mercer Langston, and many others wrote of theirlives in a similar “up from slavery” mode. In varying ways, they allcontributed, wittingly or not, to the Horatio Alger mythology of their time.They were and had to be success stories wrested from the depths of obscurity andrepression. Langston even gave his autobiography the subtitle Self-Reliance, theSecret of Success. This age of Progress required a writer with Douglass’s storyto be a kind of missionary for success, and therefore to distance himself fromhis roots and from the Southern black folk around whom he found a beginning.22[notes02.html#ch27fn_22a] In this sense, Douglass built his own monument.But the story he fashioned in his writing spaces at Cedar Hill was a highlyrevised version of the one he had given the world in Bondage and Freedom aquarter century earlier. The great indictment of slavery and the abolitionistmanifesto of Bondage got softened in Life and Times. He tempered his words now,trying to put a positive face on his slave experience when possible. He changedsome chapter titles and subheadings as he line-edited himself. “A Chapter ofHorrors” in Bondage became “Characteristics of Overseers” in Life and Times. Hesignificantly softened his portrayal of Thomas Auld. In another instance, hechanged “oppressors and tyrants” to “our masters.” Moreover, he erased thevoices of some other slaves in Life and Times, thus reducing access to theinterior psychology of slave life, which was one brilliant feature of the firsttwo autobiographies. And he wrote unflatteringly about the habits of thefreedpeople. Perhaps Douglass was in his own way, as some critics havesuggested, using his autobiography to serve the cause of official nationalreconciliation and progress after the Civil War. He still mustered an oldmillennial rhetoric in some of his speeches about memory, refuting the ideologyof the Lost Cause at every turn; but as Zoe Trodd has argued, Douglass’s voicein Life and Times often sounds like that of “the complacent grandfather . . . ofhis earlier self.”23 [notes02.html#ch27fn_23a]The richly political text of 1855 survived to a degree in the 1881 book, untilhe wrote about the postwar years, which became more a catalog of episodes withDouglass ascending the stairway of national affairs. He praised his allies andcomrades and tried to settle some scores with his critics. But he reallysearched for coherence, both with small revisions of prose and with his bigthemes. At the beginning of the second part’s chapter 15, “Weighed in theBalance,” he spoke with remarkable confidence: “Whatever of good or ill thefuture may have in store for me . . . I am impressed with a sense ofcompleteness—a sort of rounding up of the arch to the point where the keystonemay be inserted, the scaffolding removed, and the work, with all itsimperfections and faults, left to speak for itself.” Age, fame, and circumstancehad mellowed him. But it is stunning that Douglass, in a life full of suchturmoil and fateful turns that might have left him discredited, exiled, or dead,could also write in the last chapter in 1881, “My day has been a pleasant one.My joys have far exceeded my sorrows and my friends have brought me far morethan my enemies have taken from me.”24 [notes02.html#ch27fn_24a] He left suchpassages from 1881 in the 1892 edition, despite experiences that contradictedthese sentiments. He needed the symmetry and completeness more than he neededbitter truths.In at least two further ways Douglass made the third telling of his life verydifferent from the first two—the intriguing choices of illustrations, and theselection of George L. Ruffin to introduce the book. In 1881 he includedeighteen pictures, seven of which depicted his life as a slave or as a runawayslave. Six others are either portraits of himself (the frontispiece) or thefamous abolitionists and statesmen he had known. The remainder include an imageof his house at Cedar Hill, his role as marshal at the inauguration of Garfield,his visit back to the Wye plantation on the Eastern Shore, a group image of thecommissioners to Santo Domingo, and a single illustration of him fighting a mobin Indiana as an abolitionist. But for the 1892 edition Douglass reduced thenumber of images to eleven, and six of the seven deletions are representationsof his slave experience. The only one that survived is “The Last Time He Saw HisMother.”25 [notes02.html#ch27fn_25a] The illustrations in the later editionthus, like some of the writing, deemphasized slavery in favor of the ascendantgreat man.The choice of George Ruffin to introduce his new book may seem puzzling to ustoday, but clearly it was not to Douglass. Ruffin had been born free inRichmond, Virginia, in 1834 and moved north to Boston. He was active inabolitionism and the recruiting of black soldiers during the war; as a GildedAge man of merit he became a prominent pillar of black Boston society. He was a“first” of several kinds, which no doubt Douglass found intriguing—first AfricanAmerican to graduate from Harvard Law School (in 1869), to serve in theMassachusetts state legislature (1869–71), to serve on the Boston City Council(1876–78), and to be appointed a district judge (1884). He even unsuccessfullyran for attorney general in Massachusetts. Here was a symbol of socialrectitude, racial progress, and, indeed, like James McCune Smith, who hadintroduced Bondage, the high education Douglass never enjoyed. An exchange ofletters between the two men in May and June 1881 demonstrates that the authorcourted the civil servant. Ruffin at first demurred and worried that he couldnever match the brilliance of McCune Smith’s effort in 1855, that he was“disposed to shrink” from the honor, but that he would assume the “duty” for its“historical sense.”26 [notes02.html#ch27fn_26a]In Ruffin’s introduction, it was as though he read Douglass’s “Self-Made Men”speech with great care and distinctly avoided McCune Smith’s lyrical 1855 essayon the author’s meaning to the slavery crisis. Ruffin gave the reader the blackHoratio Alger with no hyperbole spared. Douglass was a “sui generis” historicalfigure, and an American original that could never be matched. He had risen fromignorance and slavery through “toil and industry” to the status of “cultivatedgentleman.” Douglass belonged on a pedestal, said Ruffin, the gentlemen’s clubpresident in Boston, and Douglass had a “halo of peace about him.” FollowingDouglass’s lead, Ruffin declared the victory won, the “culmination of hislife . . . the object . . . Emancipation . . . accomplished.” Douglass nowdeserved “serenity” and “repose.” Here was the psychic order Douglass hadclaimed for himself. In Ruffin’s portrayal, the hero need only stand and takeapplause. But Ruffin could not stop there. Ruffin even bizarrely provided someold plantation-days imagery for white readers conditioned by the stock popularliterature about the Old South and the patriarchal peculiar institution. ColonelLloyd’s plantation was the scene of “the great house and the cabins, the oldAunties, and patriarchal Uncles, little picanninies and picanninies not solittle, of every shade and complexion, from ebony black to whiteness of themaster race; mules, overseers, and broken down fences. . . . Here was slavebreeding and slave-selling, whipping, torturing, and beating to death.”27[notes02.html#ch27fn_27a] We do not know whether Douglass smiled or cringed whenhe read the draft of the introduction. But he chose to include it in botheditions.• • •Nothing in Life and Times may have led Ruffin to his sentimental vision ofDouglass’s rise in social status quite like the author’s descriptions of histhird return to the Eastern Shore in June 1881. Douglass had long sought achance to return to the Wye plantation, still owned by the Lloyds, and on June12–13 he seized an opportunity. He went at the invitation of fellow Republicanand friend John L. Thomas, the customs collector at the port of Baltimore. Onthe US revenue cutter Guthrie, they took a four-hour cruise down the Chesapeakeand anchored in the Wye River, just off the Lloyd estate, where Douglassreported that he could see for the first time since 1825 “the stately chimneysof the grand old mansion.”28 [notes02.html#ch27fn_28a]Colonel Edward Lloyd V, the master of the Wye plantation, former governor ofMaryland, whom Douglass had known as a child, was long gone. The estate was nowrun by Edward Lloyd VII, who had been alerted that the former slave intended tovisit. The Lloyds had long been steeped in proslavery and then postwarDemocratic politics, but were also adept at aristocratic manners. Lloyd hadhosted Jefferson Davis in 1867, shortly after the Confederate president had beenreleased from prison in Virginia, and two famous Confederate officers, AdmiralFranklin Buchanan and General Charles S. Winder, were buried in the Wyegraveyard. Each of them had married a Lloyd daughter. To this bastion of the OldSouth, Douglass in effect invited himself. When a note was sent ashore toannounce the Guthrie’s arrival, the senior Lloyd was conveniently gone to Eastonon business; his sons, eighteen-year-old Howard and eight-year-old DeCourcy, metthe visitors and escorted them on an extraordinary and, for Douglass, nostalgictour of the “Great House Farm.” Gone now in Douglass’s observations was what hehad described in 1845 as the place of “atrocities which would make your blood toboil.” Wye plantation was no longer the place of totalizing fear where ColonelLloyd would make every slave “stand, listen, and tremble,” and tell old Barney,who ran the stable, to kneel on the ground and bare his back to the savage whipsof Lloyd’s three sons.29 [notes02.html#ch27fn_29a]Instead, Douglass took a stroll into memory and was “deeply moved.” Curiously,he claimed to recall the “form and features” of the Colonel Lloyd he had knownfifty-six years earlier, and he admiringly saw the same “aristocratic descent”in the faces of the two great-grandsons conducting his tour. A careful reader ofLife and Times might fairly wonder if Douglass was not declaring his own lineagein and returning home to this family of aristocrats. He was agreeably surprisedby how little had changed around the place. Almost nothing seemed “missingexcept the squads of little black children which were once seen in alldirections, and the great number of slaves in its fields.” Most of the oldbuildings were still there for him to remember. Aaron Anthony’s house stillstood with the window beneath which he used to sing for Miss Lucretia whenhungry. Passages from his autobiographies floated in his head as he saw the oldshoemaker’s and blacksmith’s shops, or the ground outside Aunt Katy’s kitchen,“where I last saw my mother.” Lyrically, he looked into the “old barn . . . aplace of wonderful interest to me in my childhood, for there I often repaired tolisten to the chatter and watch the flight of the swallows among its loftybeams.” Douglass replaced the pain and loneliness of boyhood trauma now withpoetry. The famous man dissolved the choked agony of a slave boy with beautiful,detailed reminiscence: “Time had wrought some changes in the trees and foliage.The Lombardy poplars, in the branches of which the red-winged blackbirds used tocongregate and sing, and whose music awakened in my young heart sensations andaspirations deep and undefinable, were gone; but the oaks and elms, where youngDaniel . . . used to divide with me his cakes and biscuits, were there as . . .beautiful as ever.”30 [notes02.html#ch27fn_30a]Young Howard Lloyd and his little brother may have been in awe of Douglass, areversal the elder statesman may have relished. While strolling through thefamily burial ground, a place of “unusual solemnity,” Howard “gathered for me,”said Douglass, “a bouquet of flowers and evergreens . . . which I carefullybrought to my home for preservation.” After walking through thestill-magnificent Wye garden, Douglass and his small party were invited onto theveranda and then into the dining room of the great house. Sipping wine andsitting in wickers on the veranda, “hedged . . . and adorned with fruit treesand flowers of almost every variety,” Douglass was moved to write a verypersonal description of the scene that was at once about memory, nature, andpower: “A more tranquil and tranquilizing scene I have seldom met in this or anyother country.”31 [notes02.html#ch27fn_31a]This tranquilized state of memory was in part what Douglass sought in his richlysymbolic returns to the Eastern Shore. He still harbored vestiges of that oldrage that needed expending; and mysteries yet floated in his psyche about howFred Bailey became Frederick Douglass. He craved the Lloyds’ recognition andrespect; in his estimation, at least, he got it. On his walk back to the boat, agroup of black workers on the plantation gathered around. Many were the childrenof people Douglass had known as a boy, and he called out some of the names of“old servants.” The author had almost never used the word servant for slave inearlier writings. He spent a little time with these people and then bade themall farewell, with special thanks to the young Lloyds.32[notes02.html#ch27fn_32a]The honor Douglass came to seize that day could only be extended by white peoplenamed Lloyd. His steamer next took him to the Miles River estate called theRest, where he paid a cordial and welcomed visit to Mrs. Franklin Buchanan, theformer Ann Catherine Lloyd, one of the surviving daughters of Colonel Lloyd.Proudly, Douglass reported how Mrs. Buchanan invited him to sit close by herside, introducing her grandchildren. She treated him as though he “was an oldacquaintance and occupied an equal station with the most aristocratic of theCaucasion race.” Again, he observed “the features of her father” in her visage.After an hour’s conversation, a little granddaughter presented Douglass anotherbouquet of June flowers, which the autobiographer soon converted into an awkwarddeclaration of a “new dispensation of justice, kindness, and human brotherhood”between North and South. Douglass knew better, but these reunions and nostalgicvisits to his past caused in him gushes of personal reconciliation that he couldfeel better than explain. Oddly, he went so far as to state that his pleasanttime at the Wye and the Rest showed that the “war and the slavery that causedthe war were things of the past.”33 [notes02.html#ch27fn_33a]On many public platforms in these years, however, Douglass argued exactly theopposite. Indeed, he had done so only two weeks before his visit to the Wyeplantation in a remarkable Memorial Day address on John Brown at Harpers Ferry.In that speech, as elsewhere, he laid down a detailed historical and mythicimage of Brown and of the Harpers Ferry raid, as “not a story to please but topain.” Brown was a martyr and a victor, but also a classically tragic hero neverto be forgotten, a symbol always to trouble and spur the American conscience.Douglass used Brown as a call to action in the memory war with the South’s LostCause ideology and with the nation’s susceptibility to a sectionalreconciliation based on white supremacy. “When John Brown stretched forth hisarm the sky was cleared,” Douglass had declared on May 30, 1881. “The time forcompromise was gone—the armed hosts of freedom stood face to face over the chasmof a broken Union—and the clash of arms was at hand. The South . . . drew thesword of rebellion and thus made her own, and not Brown’s, the lost cause of thecentury.”34 [notes02.html#ch27fn_34a] It remained to be seen just who would winthis struggle over memory. So powerful, though, was his own story—at least tohim—that Douglass seemed to wish against all odds and reality that personalmemory might yet defeat the political hold of the past on American society.Douglass took his Eastern Shore flowers from the Lloyds back to Cedar Hill,where they would be no use in fighting the battles that lay ahead.Douglass’s conspicuous fame drew enemies and critics at every turn in the 1880s.Upon his return to Washington from the Eastern Shore, he soon found himselfembroiled in another press controversy, this time about his alleged practice ofnepotism in hiring for the Recorder of Deeds Office. Washington, DC, had severalblack newspapers by the 1880s, at least one of which operated as a scandalsheet. In June and July 1881, the New South’s editor complained that Garfieldhad made only two appointments of blacks to federal offices, and “one is theveteran placehunter, the indefatigable and obsequious Fred. Douglass.” The otherwas former senator Blanche K. Bruce. Some black leaders (implying Douglass),argued the New South, were too ready “to forgive betrayal and ingratitude.”Worse, the paper blasted the recorder for hiring in his office his two sonsCharles and Lewis, his daughter Rosetta (“Miss Sprigg”), another young blackwoman from New York named Miss Blanche Washington, the niece of Charles Purvisof Philadelphia, and a man named Campbell “from the West Indies” who was not acitizen. The New South tallied “four Douglasses, two female non-residents, and aforeigner, all . . . in one month. Fred Jr. is downstairs in the marshal’soffice—making five of a family in one building. Great God!”35[notes02.html#ch27fn_35a]Another paper, the People’s Advocate, defended Douglass and his brood, claimingthat only two of the employees were on fixed salaries, Lewis and a Mr. Schayer,and the rest were paid according to how much work each did. Charles had beendismissed from the Census Office, losing yet another post. According even to thePeople’s Advocate, Charles was “temporary” in the Recorder’s Office, but hereally needed a job. “Members of Mr. Douglass’s family,” declared the journal ina lame defense of nepotism, “have families of their own to support.” This paperat least tried to shield the Douglass family, and especially the patriarchhimself, from attacks. “Frederick Douglass is our most illustrious AmericanNegro,” it announced on July 25. “He stands preeminently our foremost man,towering above all others . . . his character as fixed as the Alleghenies or theRocky Mountains. Of better educated men we have scores. Of men more cultured,more harmonious . . . in their proportions, there may have been . . . but therehas been, and there can be but ONE Frederick Douglass.”36[notes02.html#ch27fn_36a] Many other black men, especially of two generations,would dispute that claim the rest of Douglass’s life.By any measure, the charge of nepotism was amply true. Douglass’s Account Bookfor 1881–83, a daily tabulation of all receipts and payments to the recorder’sstaff, verifies that during virtually every week of this two-year period, allthe names mentioned in the press, and especially the names of “Charley” or “Chs.Douglass,” “Lewis Douglass,” “Fredk. Douglass, Jr.,” “Mrs. Sprague” (Rosetta),and by 1882 “Miss Pitts” (Helen), appear on the payroll. Lewis was paid in largelump sums of $25 or $40 and sometimes more. The other Douglass relatives,working as clerks, were paid by the amount of deeds or other paperwork processedin smaller amounts, carefully recorded as $2 or $12.12 or $6.45. Often theprimary breadwinner for her six children in the absence of her estrangedhusband, Nathan, Rosetta had some good weeks and bad weeks at the office. Shetook home $16.65 on June 23, 1881, $17.80 on July 2, but only $4.89 on July 11.Charles may have only been part-time, but on July 9 that summer he took home$14.90 and had many other days just as gainful. Frederick Jr. was not on salary,but somehow he garnered $800 for his services on July 20, 1881. This recordmakes clear that the entire Douglass extended family lived on the considerablesums made in the collective operation of the Recorder’s Office, all havingreceived their appointments from the boss upstairs.37 [notes02.html#ch27fn_37a]This kind of Gilded Age corruption was apparently standard operating procedure,although it tarnished the reputation of the black first family. The Recorder’sOffice was a Douglass-family cash cow.• • •The recorder’s duties, as well as the demands of the extended family, now keptthe Sage of Cedar Hill closer to home. So did Anna’s health. Anna was finallyfree from Assing’s summer intrusions by 1881, when Assing sailed for Europe,never to return. But by 1882 Anna suffered increasingly from neuralgia andrheumatoid arthritis. The housekeeping at the Cedar Hill mansion fellincreasingly to Rosetta and her sister-in-law Louisa Sprague, who had beenliving with the Douglasses since the late 1860s and had become a close companionto Anna. By the early 1880s Frederick and Anna had watched and mourned thedeaths of no fewer than four of their grandchildren by various illnesses, aharrowing fact of nineteenth-century life. But now the mother figure of thisturbulent but enriching extended family of kin and adopted kin fell disabled.38[notes02.html#ch27fn_38a]A handwritten note by Frederick Jr. in one of the family scrapbooks recorded asimple statement: “Mother Douglass was stricken with paralysis on the morning ofJuly 7 between six and seven am, 1882.” Frederick Sr. was at home the morningthe stroke occurred, and close by during Anna’s final month of bedriddendebilitation. Anna’s room was on the second floor at Cedar Hill, across the hallfrom her husband’s. As Lewis, Rosetta’s daughters, and the older children ofFrederick Jr. and Charles gathered about in a daily vigil, Anna still tried togive directions for household duties. Rosetta remembered that “altho’ perfectlyhelpless,” her mother “insisted from her sickbed to direct her home affairs. Theorders were given with precision and they were obeyed with alacrity.”Unconscious for the final ten days, Anna Murray Douglass, a freeborn Americanblack woman who grew up on the east bank of the Tuckahoe River in Denton,Caroline County, Maryland, the gardener, baker, cook, household manager, keeperof financial balances, shoe binder, seamstress, zealous if quiet participant inwomen’s antislavery fairs, protector and provider for fugitive slaves, and theunsung heroine who forged the domestic worlds of the great man she married, diedon the morning of August 4, 1882.39 [notes02.html#ch27fn_39a] She was eithersixty-eight or sixty-nine years old.The passing made headlines, especially for those who saw Anna Douglass as theparagon of a deeply traditional vision of womanhood and motherhood, and whowould use her death to cast an even greater light on the celebrity of herhusband. The New York Globe rigidly laid down the gender line, portraying Annaas a heroine of the house. Douglass had “spent most of his time in the campaignbattling for the emancipation of the race,” while his mate made certain that“the utmost diligence had been bestowed upon every branch of his domesticaffairs.” The Globe even quoted Anna from an alleged earlier interview: “Myhusband is battling with the minions of oppression, why not I endure hardshipthat my race may be free? I will do my duty as a wife toward him and ourchildren; they shall look neat and spruce on the street, in the house, in theschoolroom.” As though the paper were copying from a manual of true womanhood,Anna was honored for her “women’s wit,” for always “uttering words of cheer toher struggling heroic husband.”40 [notes02.html#ch27fn_40a] In such earnestdrivel, the black and white public learned about a woman so few knew.Image [../images/f0630-01.jpg]Anna Murray Douglass, c. 1863.Douglass had time to face the loss of Anna, and he managed to carry on somenormal aspects of his work and political life. During the two weeks or so afterthe funeral he engaged in a fierce personal exchange with George T. Downing byletters in the New York Globe over whether blacks should remain devoted to theRepublican Party or engage in “independence” or “revolt.” Douglass gave as hetook, as usual, demanding that the race not “make the mistake of jumping out ofthe frying pan into the fire, of flinging away the substance and grasping at theshadow.” Moreover, he managed a sense of humor on August 21 in responding to aletter from S. W. Cowles (a collector?) requesting that the famous ex-slave sendor sell him a “pair of handcuffs and slave shackles.” Douglass wrote back sayingthat Cowles would be more likely to find such items among former slaveholders:“I have been better known for getting rid, than getting possession of suchemblems of our civilization.”41 [notes02.html#ch27fn_41a]But for some time during and after the period of Anna’s death, Douglass seems tohave fallen apart. He saw a “dawn of hope,” as he wrote to old friend Amy Postby mid-July, since Anna had temporarily regained the ability to speak. But toold abolitionist comrade Parker Pillsbury, he wrote four days later that Annawas “pressing near the gates of death.” As the older granddaughters nursed Annatoward the end and helped other women prepare the body for the burial ceremonyin the front parlor at Cedar Hill, Douglass clutched his daughter. “Ah! Rosa,”he pleaded one day while hugging Rosetta, “if she could have only lived a fewyears longer.” The forty-three-year-old Rosetta observed that her weeping father“seemed to feel that she [Anna] was a protection to him in many ways.”Protector, guardian, helpmate, the embodiment of home indeed she had been forforty-four years. Fredericka Sprague Perry, at that time one of the youngergranddaughters, remembered that at one point in the funeral preparation she andother female sisters and cousins gathered about their grandfather, “still asmice . . . wiping our tears away because grandpa wiped his.” He moaned openly infront of the children, said Fredericka, declaring, “Mother was dead! Yourgrandma has gone away—you have no grandma now! He did not want us to forgetgrandma.”42 [notes02.html#ch27fn_42a]The funeral was an extraordinarily public affair; according to many pressreports three thousand people attended, with dignitaries riding in some onehundred carriages to the Graceland Cemetery, a prominent biracial burial groundon the edge of Washington. The pallbearers composed a small who’s who ofprominent Washington, DC, black leaders, including former senator Blanche K.Bruce, the famous entrepreneur and hotel owner James Wormley, and the formerchairman of the District’s Republican Party, John F. Cook. Many of Douglass’saspiring black rivals attended, but were not asked to serve as pallbearers. Thefuneral sermon, delivered by AME bishop T. M. D. Ward, was a tribute to Douglassand his abolitionist compatriots, virtually all dead, including Benjamin Lundy,Nat Turner, Denmark Vesey, Richard Allen, John Brown, William Lloyd Garrison,Charles Sumner, Gerrit Smith, Henry Highland Garnet, and even two presidents,Lincoln and Garfield. It was as though the bishop anticipated the futureeulogies of Douglass while acknowledging the death of his wife. As in life,Anna’s husband’s fame hovered over, even smothered, her identity at her death.Rosetta later admitted, “It is difficult to say anything of mother withoutmention of father, her life was so enveloped in his.”43[notes02.html#ch27fn_43a] We have no record of how much Rosetta or her brothersmight have wished they could have replaced the good bishop at the lectern thatday and reversed the narrative from their father to their publicly unknownmother. Perhaps they let well enough alone as she might wish.Such a eulogy could be done only in private and then later find publicexpression in Rosetta’s remarkable memoir about Anna Douglass, “My Mother as IRecall Her,” delivered as a speech to the Anna Murray Douglass Union of theWomen’s Christian Temperance Union in Washington, DC, on May 10, 1900. Rosetta’sdaughter, Fredericka, set the tone in a preface with a poem, “Mother of CedarHill”:God thought to give the sweetest thingIn his almighty powerTo earth; and deeply ponderingWhat it should be, one hour,In fondest joy and love of heartOut weighing every other,He moved the gates of heaven apartAnd gave to earth—You—mother!From Rosetta’s reminiscence, we learn that Anna had learned her trade,“household management,” while first working as a teenage servant in the housesof white people in Baltimore, two of which the daughter actually went to thatcity sometime in the late 1890s to visit, observing the furnishings and“appointments so frequently spoken of by my mother.” Rosetta also recalled thather father had taken her back to New Bedford in 1890 to visit the two-roomapartment on Elm Street, her birthplace in 1839, where she could appreciate andimagine the “daily toil, the wife at the washboard, the husband with saw, buck,and axe.” The “economical habits” of the Douglass household, sustained over theyears, argued Rosetta, were a “characteristic of my mother.” Rosetta remembereddistinctive details that allow us a fair knowledge of the woman so few reallyunderstood. In the early years in freedom, near poverty despite all theirindustry, Rosetta said her father often commented on how Anna would create a“nicely prepared” supper on a “neatly set table with its snowy whitecloth—coarse tho’ it was.” During the “days of anxious worry” while Douglass wasin England in 1845–47, Anna fed her children with money she made shoe binding ina Lynn factory. Anna had considerable “executive ability,” said Rosetta. Uponthe worldly father’s return from the British Isles to their cottage, he worriedaloud about all the bills that must be due. One day, “mother arose and quietlygoing to the bureau drawer produced a Bank book with sums deposited just in theproportion father had sent, the book also containing deposits of her ownearnings—and not a debt had been contracted during his absence.”44[notes02.html#ch27fn_44a] Anna may have remained largely illiterate, but sheunderstood arithmetic and budgets. Anna’s domesticity had meant her family’ssurvival.Rosetta saw her mother perhaps as Rosetta saw herself, as a quiet heroine of hergender. While Rosetta was well educated, her devotion to her disastrous marriagehad led to her delivering seven babies between the ages of twenty-five andthirty-eight. In Rochester, Anna had been “called up at all hours of the night”to feed hungry fugitive slaves running toward Canada. She set her supper tablewith extra food for the family on “publication day,” the time each week whenFrederick Douglass’ Paper came off the presses at the print shop two miles downthe hill in the center of Rochester. Rosetta portrayed her mother with an“acrid” wit and a sense of “grim humor,” but also intolerant of alcohol andfrivolity among the former slave population in Washington. Anna was a “strictdisciplinarian—her no meant no and yes, yes, but more frequently the no’s hadit.” Anna did not like social occasions and almost never traveled with herhusband. But Rosetta did recall one moving “tableau” that reveals much. At thespacious house of Samuel J. May in Boston, a major Garrisonian, Anna sat in theparlor when the three giants of the American Anti-Slavery Society, WendellPhillips, William Lloyd Garrison, and Sydney Howard Gay, gathered around andengaged her in polite chat, “as refreshments were served on trays.”45[notes02.html#ch27fn_45a] Anna was usually the one serving the trays in herhouse. Such a scene in the early or mid-1840s was one Anna likely made sure shenever had to repeat.Above all, we can see even in this sentimental tribute that Anna took her roleas Douglass’s personal shield and gatekeeper seriously. Loyal to her mother’smemory, Rosetta had to be thinking, though, of the contradictions in herstatement about Anna’s “gracious” hospitality. Rosetta had to sigh about OttilieAssing when she wrote, “There were a few who presumed on the hospitality of thehome and officiously insinuated themselves and their advice in a manner that wasparticularly disagreeable to her.” A better description of Anna’s struggle overthe years with Frederick’s friendship with the German lady could hardly havebeen written. Charles Douglass also, in his 1917 reminiscence about his parents,portrayed his mother as a woman of unfailing loyalty and “sacrifice,” the personwho “toiled side by side with my father from the day he escaped from bondageuntil the day of her death in 1882.”46 [notes02.html#ch27fn_46a]In the second edition of Life and Times, Douglass declared, “It is far easier towrite about others than about one’s self.” He said he had been “morally forced”to craft so much autobiography, to bear “witness . . . for a people . . . notallowed to speak for themselves.” But in that 620-page re-creation of his publiclife, Anna was one of the others who received exactly one mention, not by namebut as “my intended wife” and a “free woman” who joined him in New York to bemarried after his escape from slavery. The mother figure at the heart of hishome for forty-four years, and whose death set him emotionally adrift in summerand fall 1882, remained forever a subject about whom he could not write publicwords. Privately, Douglass mourned deeply. The weekend after the funeral, he,Rosetta, and his oldest grandchild, the almost eighteen-year-old Annie Sprague,escaped the heat of Washington and took the train to Rochester to be with thedearest of old friends, the Posts. It had been ten years since the house fire,and perhaps he and these special women took a stroll out to the hill to walkover whatever remained of Anna’s garden. By October, back at Cedar Hill and atwork in the Recorder’s Office, he wrote to a friend that Anna’s death had causedhim “a lesson of thought, silence, humility and resignation.” His initialfeeling, he said, was to “break up my home and possibly go to Europe—but uponreflection—I felt it too late in life to . . . become a wanderer.”47[notes02.html#ch27fn_47a] Had he done so, he might have had to encounter thatestranged wanderer Ottilie Assing.In responses to condolence letters, Douglass kept seeking the language for hisloss. In those letters he expressed a dark, eloquent truth. “Mother was the postin the center of my house,” he said to Sarah Loguen, “and held us together . . .the main pillar of my house has fallen,” and “life cannot hold much for me, nowthat she has gone.”48 [notes02.html#ch27fn_48a] Ever since his grandmother Betsyplopped him down at the Wye plantation alone as a child, since the last momenthe ever saw his mysterious mother, Harriet Bailey, since Sophia Auld rejectedhim as both reader and surrogate son, when he could no longer sing for food andaffection at Lucretia Auld’s window, since he lost Julia Griffiths from thedaily labor and emotional sustenance of his home and print shop, and since thelong intellectual affair of the heart with Ottilie Assing had soured and ended,Douglass had long desperately needed women to provide the pillars and posts inhis life. He had needed none more than Anna Douglass, even as he would not allowher frustrating, indispensable, loving-yet-unseen presence to intrude on theepic tale of the self-made genius.• • •On New Year’s Day, January 1, 1883, in Washington, DC, a large American flaghung at one end of a banquet room at Freund’s Restaurant on Ninth Street; asumptuous feast for more than fifty African American men filled a long tablebedecked with flowers and lit by candles. It was the twentieth anniversary ofthe Emancipation Proclamation. They gathered to mark the special date byhonoring Frederick Douglass, the one among them around whom a cluster ofdivergent race leaders might coalesce in celebration of black freedom.Douglass’s closest friends and supporters in the group may also have arrangedthe fete to help assuage his loneliness and dislocation in the wake of Anna’sdeath. Blanche Bruce called the banquet together. The Washington Bee remarked,“Never before in the history of the American negro has there ever been such anassemblage of leading colored men.”49 [notes02.html#ch27fn_49a] The elaboratedinner lifted up Douglass as the principal symbol of a people’s journey fromslavery to liberation.The guests comprised a who’s who of two generations of black politicians, civilservants, journalists, writers, professors, ministers, and soldiers. Prominentamong them were the Pan-Africanist scholar Edward Blyden; the formeremigrationist, soldier, politician, and Douglass’s coeditor back at thebeginning of the North Star, Martin Delany; the heroic wartime boat pilot andlater congressman from South Carolina, Robert Smalls. Richard T. Greener andJames M. Gregory of Howard University (where Douglass was a trustee) were amonga group of academics. The young historian George Washington Williams highlightedthe contingent of writers. The Reverend Benjamin T. Tanner, editor of the AMEChurch’s influential Christian Recorder, and the bold, young editor of the NewYork Globe, T. Thomas Fortune, headlined the ranks of newspapermen. The WarDepartment clerk and Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Christian A.Fleetwood, appeared and was addressed as “Captain.” Douglass’s sons Lewis andCharles, veterans of the famed Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts regiment,conspicuously attended the tribute to their father. Along with their brother,Frederick Jr., they needed affirmation in their own careers, which had neverblossomed as they had hoped. Among the revelers were congressmen, including JohnR. Lynch of Mississippi, and members of state legislatures from South and North,men who owned their own businesses, and ministers of prominent churches. Manyamong them had fiercely disagreed with one another about issues and strategiesfor best advancing the race, some with Douglass himself, which the guest ofhonor freely acknowledged.50 [notes02.html#ch27fn_50a] Rivalries were left atthe door—especially Douglass’s bitter feuds with Greener and others over loyaltyto the Republican Party—and the generational divide was put aside for at leastone evening. They gathered to contemplate and to declare their place in nationalmemory.As the gentlemen settled in for a long evening (they did not adjourn until 3:00a.m.), some forty-one toasts were offered to virtually every aspect of blacklife and aspiration, as well as to heroes of the antislavery cause, living anddead. At this men’s-only banquet (no women writers or leaders were invited), onetoast was offered to “the ladies.” Douglass was the final speaker, responding toBruce’s long personal tribute and to a toast to the day; he reached for thelodestar of recent American history. To hear Douglass on these occasions when hespoke about historical memory must have been to feel one’s inheritance, toalmost see history flowing as a procession in time. Who were black people inAmerica at this moment of remembrance in 1883? According to the orator they werea people reborn with emancipation, and a new nation had been born with them.After several minutes of wit and humor about how he had “no talent” for“after-dinner speeches,” and that he had never succeeded at brevity, Douglassfound his theme. “This high festival of ours is coupled with a day which we dowell to hold in sacred and everlasting honor,” he announced, “a day . . . whichmay well count for a thousand years.”51 [notes02.html#ch27fn_51a]T. Thomas Fortune later recollected the evening as a transcendent experience.Normally, said the New York editor, he found Washington, DC, “depressing” and“nauseating” in its political cynicism. “But the Douglass banquet, a spontaneoustribute of love, respect, honor, and veneration bridged over many a sigh. . . .Indeed, the Douglass banquet was an event in the history of the race.” Fortuneforgot for the moment his own harsh criticism of Douglass’s symbolic politicsand acknowledged the event as one for the transmission of memory, where “tenderyouth” was instructed by “mature age.” Douglass, said Fortune, “bent low hismajestic head of snowy whiteness and received with pleasurable emotions thehomage” of the throng of leaders, “the majority of whom were unborn or in theirinfancy when he was thundering against the iniquity of the slave power.” Whatunified the disparate gathering of professions and egos, Fortune argued, was the“cause of the race,” and gratitude and love for the great Douglass.52[notes02.html#ch27fn_52a] A talented writer and thinker, Fortune would becomemuch better at history and activism than he was at homage to his elders.Douglass made their hearts pump and their throats choke. He filled the room withCivil War memory well past midnight and gave the occasion an incantatoryrefrain, which he used some sixteen times in a breathless expression of thenation’s rebirth. “Until this day,” he proclaimed, “slavery, the sum of allvillainies, like a vulture, was gnawing at the heart of the Republic; until thisday there stretched away behind us an awful chasm of darkness and despair ofmore than two centuries; until this day the American slave, bound in chains,tossed his fettered arms on high and groaned for freedom’s gift in vain.” Eventhose who readily saw Douglass as a rival and were jealous of his fame probablycould not resist the rhetorical power of this litany of images from memory.“Until this day,” continued the speaker at the head of the table, “the coloredpeople of the United States lived in the shadow of death . . . and had novisible future. . . . Until this day it was doubtful whether liberty or unionwould triumph, or slavery and barbarism. Until this day victory had largelyfollowed the arms of the Confederate army. . . . Until this day . . . ,”Douglass sang on.53 [notes02.html#ch27fn_53a]In these visions, Douglass lent more than sermonic flourish to this occasion ofcommemoration. He took the central idea of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address as wellas his own “Mission of the War” address of 1863–64—national rebirth andredefinition—and rendered it palpable and inspirational in the present. Thepublic Douglass as orator was very much back. Some press coverage described aprolonged evening of tributes. A Cleveland Herald reporter said that theassembled “listened as they had not before. . . . He speaks as he did twentyyears ago. . . . His eyes flashed, his long silvery hair seemed to stand on endand his voice was as the sound of many waters.”54 [notes02.html#ch27fn_54a]But the same reporter then indicated that disputes broke out late afterDouglass’s main speech, with Greener and Fortune calling for blacks to seekindependence from political parties and to strive more to free themselves ratherthan relying on white allies. Douglass rose again with ire, said the journalist,denounced the “croakers,” and yanked his audience back to the heart of the war.“When the recruiting officers,” shouted Douglass, “were going up and down thestreet begging for men to enlist, when the cause of the Union hung in thebalance, when foreign powers were ready to recognize the South, the negro witharms of iron and fingers of steel, grasped the Union cause and held ittogether!” Then the orator “became calmer” and said, “Young men . . . let me sayas did John, when speaking to the multitude of Christ, ‘You must increase, but Idecrease.’ ” The evening ended with all standing and declaring “three cheers forOld Man Eloquent.”55 [notes02.html#ch27fn_55a] Douglass, however, did not intendto pass any batons to the next generation."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 28--------------------------------------------------------------------------------WATCHMAN, WHAT OF THE NIGHT?I am not at all surprised when some of those for whom I have lived and laboredlift their heels against me. Since the days of Moses such has been the fate ofall men earnestly endeavouring to serve the oppressed and unfortunate.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, MAY 1883In July 1883, an African American member of the US legation in Monrovia,Liberia, wrote to Douglass after reading the orator’s April speech commemoratingemancipation in the District of Columbia. The foreign-service worker had alsoapparently read Life and Times. He was impressed that the aging Douglass couldstill write and perform with such “vigor, brilliancy, and . . . powerafter . . . nearly a half century in the cause of our oppressed people.” TheAmerican abroad felt “reminded” of the “frequently repeated” concern amongDouglass’s admirers: Now that “slavery . . . had been practicallyabolished . . . ‘Mr. Douglass’s occupation is gone!’ What would he talk aboutnow?”1 [notes02.html#ch28fn_1a] From his reading of the April address, thecorrespondent felt reassured that Othello still had much to say.Following a long parade earlier in the day through the streets of the city, onApril 16, 1883, the twenty-first anniversary of emancipation in the District ofColumbia, Douglass was orator of the evening at the packed First CongregationalChurch. The Young Men’s Citizens Club of the District presented him withflowers, a show of respect by the next generation who awaited a passing of thebaton. Many difficult issues had arisen throughout the day’s festivities and formonths in the newspapers: racial discrimination, the denial of black votingrights in the District, disappointment with the Republican Party, recurringviolence against freedpeople in the South, and emerging fears that the greatchanges wrought by the Reconstruction amendments were under dire threat.Douglass delivered his classic medicine of hope and progress wrested from vividillustrations of despair. It was vintage Douglass, a speech full of memory andappeals for faith made through awareness of how the “sky of the Negro is dark,but not rayless.” He demanded an abiding sense of history braced by tragicsensibility. “Men are prepared by preceding events for those which are to come.We neither know the evil nor the good which may be in store for us.” He embracedthe honor paid him by the “promising young colored men of Washington.” “Irepresent the past, they the present . . . their mission begins where my missionends.” Douglass borrowed from Isaiah to illustrate the challenge: “As an oldwatchman on the walls of liberty, eagerly scanning the social and politicalhorizon, you naturally ask of me, What of the Night?”2 [notes02.html#ch28fn_2a]Then he lectured the young and the old about the lessons of the past. The nightwas dark, but he anticipated the dawn, still ready to be their watchman.In an oration sizzling with black patriotism, appeals for self-reliance, afierce faith in free speech, the right to vote, and the new ReconstructionConstitution, Douglass demanded hope. But only after naming the evils of racism:“While a slave there was a mountain of gold on his [the Negro’s] breast to keephim down, now that he is free there is a mountain of prejudice to keep himdown.” But as long as blacks could assert their place before law and speakthrough a free press, their cause would never die. “There is no modern Joshua,”Douglass insisted, “who can command this resplendent orb of popular discussionto stand still.”3 [notes02.html#ch28fn_3a] But discussion made for a tenuouspolitical platform for a people divided and distressed.Douglass received a large correspondence about his speech, which he mailed farand wide as a pamphlet. The US consul in Manchester, England, wrote to assurethe orator he had not lost any of “the force and fire of earlier years.” A blackrailroad steward in Rhode Island read the emancipation day speech and declared“amen to every sentiment you uttered.” Many still wrote to him in 1883 from asfar away as Michigan to say they had just read Life and Times and were inspired.Some friends wrote to say they were covering Douglass’s back in conversationswhere people used “denunciatory” language about him. And he must have beenheartened when his old friend Julia Griffiths Crofts wrote from England. She wasmoved by the April oration: “It brought the old days nobly to my . . . head &those 4th of July and 1st of August addresses of the past.”4[notes02.html#ch28fn_4a] Douglass could still count on friends, as heencountered critics at every turn.• • •For Douglass, during the mid-1880s, this ebb and flow of hope and despair wasboth a public and a private matter. By the spring of 1883, a new season ofbitter rivalries had broken out between the recorder and other black leaders,especially George Washington Williams, John Mercer Langston, and Richard T.Greener. Douglass engaged in public arguments about black identity and destiny,contending against those who, in frustration over American racism, consideredthemselves “not Americans but Africans.” Douglass had no sympathy for the latestsurge of emigrationism. With anger, he argued that neither slavery nor prejudicenor vicious mobs could change one’s nationality and human worth: “We are born onAmerican soil, and are of American soil. . . . Every muscle and fiber of ourbodies have been taken from it. . . . What right then has any man to call usAfricans?” Since an initial interest in American abolitionists’ creation of theMendi Mission in Sierra Leone in the 1840s, Douglass had taken little interestin African history or in the continent’s descent into colonialism. He viewed anyeffort by American blacks to seek either “return” or new cultural and nationalidentities based on African lineage as mere distraction from theirAnglo-American heritage. Moreover, he accused the young historian Williams of“deliberate falsehoods” in his portrayal of the older leader’s views on theExodus. With the lawyer and ambitious politician Langston, Douglass continued aprolonged, personal feud—one that would explode in the ensuing years—overwhether blacks should stay loyal to the Republicans, over personal familymatters, and even over who deserved the honor of speaking for the race.5[notes02.html#ch28fn_5a]Many younger men were pounding away at the base of Old Man Eloquent’s pedestal.Hypersensitive about these constant attacks, Douglass remained fully aware thatblack leaders, whether preachers, editors, or itinerant orators, had fewinstitutions and public mechanisms through which to process their disagreementsand political divisions. Lacking a normal politics embedded in legitimate rivalparties, they slashed at each other in an all too receptive press and fought forposition, reputation, and tenuous leadership perches in the recurring butinchoate convention movement.In 1883 Douglass locked horns with Richard Greener over how and whether blacksought to assemble a major convention to present their grievances to the nation.But their clash became as personal as it was strategic. Born in 1844 inPhiladelphia to free parents, Greener grew up mostly in Boston. The samegeneration as Douglass’s children, Greener was an intellectual prodigy who firststudied at a Cambridge, Massachusetts, school and later at Andover Academy.During the Civil War, Greener spent two years in preparatory school at OberlinCollege and in 1865 entered Harvard, where he became the first African Americangraduate in 1870. He worked as a staff writer briefly for the Douglasses on theNew National Era, and in 1873 he moved to Reconstruction South Carolina, wherehe taught philosophy and studied for his law degree by 1876 from the stateuniversity in Columbia. When white-supermacist Democrats took control of SouthCarolina in 1877 and drove blacks out of the university, Greener returned toWashington, DC, where for a short time he served as dean of the HowardUniversity law school. Greener convened nearly a hundred delegates, many fromthe South, for a black convention in May 1883 advocating for a broadercollective voice on black rights and against a national convention in the fallthat Douglass endorsed. From spring through the summer, the two Washington-basedleaders conducted ugly exchanges in the press. Douglass accused Greener of beingbehind an attack on him, signed by “L,” whom the patriarch of Cedar Hillidentified as “Liar.” The piece, said Douglass, was an attack “upon my integrityas a Republican, and charging me with the purpose of trading off the coloredvote of the country for office.” The Republican functionary declared himself fedup with “anonymous falsifiers” driven by “ambition and jealousy.”6[notes02.html#ch28fn_6a]Lewis Douglass took to the press as well, defending his father, chastisingGreener, and calling for a national convention. Greener shot back in more thanone outlet with an unveiled denigration of Douglass’s sons, whom he implied weremen “deluded with the chimera of their immense political influence and armyrecord; parasites that crawl into sunlight and notoriety by the permission ofdefunct greatness [and] know well when to cash a note or obtain a mortgage byobsequious flattery and subservient toadying.” But Greener, a wordsmith in hisown right, saved the worst for the elder Douglass. There had long been “twoDouglasses,” Greener maintained, “the one velvety, deprecatory, apologetic—theother insinuating, suggestive, damning with a shrug, a raised eyebrow, or a lookof caution.” He called Douglass’s responses in the press “platitudinous” andclaimed that without a convention to lead the old editor’s “trilogy would beincomplete, the banquet, the emancipation celebration, the convention!”7[notes02.html#ch28fn_7a]The ugliness of such press exchanges led the New York Globe, edited by T. ThomasFortune, to call Greener’s attacks “shameful.” “Has Frederick Douglass lived toolong,” asked a correspondent to the Globe who might have been Lewis Douglass,“that Mr. Greener and his followers desire to exterminate him?” Moreover, theChristian Recorder urged Douglass and Greener to “bottle up their wrath” andespecially demanded that the younger man know his place in the pantheon ofleaders, fall in line to “venerate” the famed orator, and stop trying “tosilence these old guns yet loaded to the very breech.”8 [notes02.html#ch28fn_8a]Image [../images/f0642-01.jpg]Richard T. Greener, c. 1870.Greener’s contempt for all the Douglasses reflected a cluster of educationalassumptions and status resentments. Douglass’s sons monitored all of theirfather’s critics and performed as, in effect, managers of their father’spolitical war room. Lewis often warned his father about the young men inWashington waiting for their chance “to claim reward for what they suppose to beservice to you.” Their only motive, Lewis maintained, was to use Douglass “as aladder upon which they may climb to importance.” Frederick Jr. expressed evenmore invective about the ingratitude of blacks generally toward his famousfather’s career and churlishly insisted that he and his siblings had to feel thepain as well. “I feel that we children have shared in a measure your sacrificesfor the good of the Cause in years past & hence, I feel the slurs and smearspointed at you.” He told his father that summer not to worry about the“youngsters.” “With truth on our side,” Frederick Jr. said with familial vanity,“Lew, Charley and I will be able to keep the flies off.” One irony festeringbeneath all this bad blood was that at this very moment Greener, whose marriagehad broken up and who was estranged from his six children, was renting anapartment in property owned by Frederick Douglass Jr.9 [notes02.html#ch28fn_9a]By July 1883, Douglass fell ill or likely experienced some kind of emotionalbreakdown. Not quite a year since Anna had died, feeling political and verbalattacks from all sides, and with a physician’s encouragement, he went by himselfup to Maine for respite and recovery. He stayed for most of a month in PolandSpring, either boarding at the new lodge constructed in 1876 or possibly with alocal farmer. Various parts of the black press monitored Douglass’s getaway; theChristian Recorder announced that he was seeking rest from recurring “nervoustroubles.”10 [notes02.html#ch28fn_10a]From there, Douglass carried on a vigorous correspondence with Lewis, FrederickJr., Rosetta, her daughter Annie, and Louisa Sprague, Rosetta’s sister-in-law.The three women were holding down the household at Cedar Hill, and all fourDouglass children kept their father abreast of the personnel dramas at theRecorder Office, and about the status of new real estate deals. They all“rejoiced to know that you are improving,” as Rosetta said, although she openlywished her father would not attend any convention that required long travel,especially into the South, where she worried for his safety. Lewis and FrederickJr. kept assuring Douglass that his friends outnumbered the “assailants” and“sharks” awaiting his return. Some employees at the Recorder’s Office were notcompetent, but they were all getting to know “Miss Pitts,” who was by allaccounts very efficient.11 [notes02.html#ch28fn_11a] That autumn, or perhapseven earlier, Douglass made some secret plans with Helen Pitts, thewell-educated forty-five-year-old suffragist whom he had hired the previousyear.• • •But first there was the big convention, originally planned for Washington butnow in deference to black Southerners booked for Louisville, Kentucky, inSeptember. Douglass returned from the cool breezes and magnificent views of theWhite Mountains in mid-August. Before leaving for Louisville he gave aninterview to the New York World. At Cedar Hill, Douglass received the reporter,who upon entry noticed the large picture of Lincoln in a place of honor in themain parlor, set off by many other images of abolitionists and women’s rightsleaders. Asked what the Louisville convention would be all about, Douglass satin a chair, “brushing back the long white hair from his forehead” as he “lookedsteadily for a full minute at the pictures on the wall.” The delegates could notignore politics, said the Lion of Anacostia, but what he hoped for most was acollective “growl” for enforcement of existing laws, especially in the South. Hefurther hoped they would get the nation’s attention about violence andprotection for the right to vote as well as for “better educational privileges.”As for the coming 1884 presidential contest, Douglass hoped the Republicanswould anoint Robert Lincoln, son of the martyred hero. He laughed off thecontroversy about his alleged motives for a convention that would personallyserve his connections to President Arthur. Douglass expected a gathering with “aloud cry for more offices” for blacks because “there is trouble in our kitchenand Oliver Twist wants more.” On the walls of Douglass’s impressive home, theheroes of many victories were looking down—Toussaint Louverture, John Brown,William Lloyd Garrison, Cinqué, Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, and manymore.12 [notes02.html#ch28fn_12a] Now, if only those victories could bepreserved in American racial memory and reality.Nearly three hundred delegates from twenty-six states assembled in Louisville onSeptember 24–25. A number of prominent black leaders boycotted the convention,some believing that the day of separate black conventions had passed and some inrevolt against the Republican Party. The gathering first faced a long struggleover choosing its chairman, with Douglass finally winning by a vote of 201–57.His critics included those convinced that he was too cozy with the Republicans.In its resolutions the convention refused to endorse Chester Arthur. It didappeal to the memory of the Lincoln-era Republicans, expressing gratitude forthe “miraculous emancipation.” But the bulk of the eleven resolutions in effectpronounced the Fourteenth Amendment and the civil rights legislation ofReconstruction “nothing more than dead letters.”13 [notes02.html#ch28fn_13a]Douglass delivered a formal keynote address on the twenty-fifth to more than twothousand people in Liederkranz Hall. After a troupe of New Orleans JubileeSingers chanted the Lord’s Prayer, Douglass rose to the lectern and spoke toevery theme the convention had announced, and in so doing made them his own. Ina familiar move, he opened by addressing the nation and white people explicitly,insisting that blacks were “in every sense Americans,” completely part of “yourcountry,” “your pride,” and equally invested in “this stupendous revolution inour national history” (emancipation). He boldly chastised those black naysayers,the “betrayers and informers,” even the “traitors among us” who in seekingstatus would exalt themselves over the good of the whole. After such shots athis intraracial enemies, Douglass got down to the business of analyzing thegrievances of his people.14 [notes02.html#ch28fn_14a]Such conventions, said Douglass, were much preferable to “violence, dynamite,and all sorts of revolutionary action.” The constitutional amendments and civilrights laws of Reconstruction had given the nation a new legal regime, but atevery level of polity enforcement was the question. In a favorite argument,Douglass reminded the country that black freedom had not emerged from “the soberdictates of wisdom,” but “of battle and of blood . . . from the hell of war.” Hedelivered a detailed analysis of the color line, of mob violence in the Southreinforced by “lynch law [and] lynch courts,” of the dead-end conditions ofblack laborers in American agriculture, and of the failure of black education.Douglass minced no words, calling the infinite manifestations of racism a“National faith.” Well before Jim Crow laws dominated Southern statute books,Douglass described the “color madness” that infected social and economic life inthe former Confederate states. Behind the pernicious color line, he argued, thelynch mob’s “rope . . . in . . . darkness,” as well as the cowardly, silentpulpit and press, played the enforcer of a terror regime. Thus the color line,Douglass declared, “hunts us at midnight, it denies us accommodation in hotelsand justice in the courts, excludes our children from schools, refuses our sonsthe right to learn trades and compels us to pursue only such labor that willbring the least reward.” Douglass’s critique of the relationship of labor andcapital, of the “slavery of wages” faced by powerless farmworkers andsharecroppers, was a departure for him. His faith in political solutions seemedshaken. Twenty years out from emancipation and the dream of land ownership, thevast bulk of freedmen toiled with little hope and no clout, crushed by debt andwhite landowners’ “power of life and death held over labor.”15[notes02.html#ch28fn_15a] Rarely had Douglass employed a class analysis sodirectly and darkly.Anger, outrage, and the intellectual demands of such a keynote address hadseemingly revived Douglass from his emotional breakdown of the previous summer.He ultimately directed this jeremiad at Republicans and at the federalgovernment: “If the Republican party cannot stand a demand for justice and fairplay, it ought to go down.” He pleaded for further federal enforcement of votingrights against the Democrats’ violent suppression in the South and even demandeda federal compulsory-school-attendance law as well as federal aid to schools inthe states. Otherwise, Douglass contended, blacks could only conclude that “theyhave been abandoned by the Government and left to the laws of nature. So far asthey are concerned, there is no Government or Constitution of the UnitedStates.” With such eloquent complaint, wondering whether Americans still livedin the land of the Fourteenth Amendment, Douglass reached back more than thirtyyears into his well of old abolitionist radicalism. His ending reworked bothJefferson and Lincoln: “We hold it to be self-evident that no class or colorshould be the exclusive rulers of this country. If there is such a ruling class,there must of course be a subject class, and when this condition is onceestablished this Government of the people, by the people and for the people,will have perished from the earth.”16 [notes02.html#ch28fn_16a]The delegates from the Louisville convention had hardly returned home when theUS Supreme Court landed a bombshell in their laps. A group of civil rights casesbased on seven incidents had been pending before the Court throughout the year.All involved the denial of access for blacks to facilities, including hotelaccommodations in Kansas and Missouri, seats at a theater in San Francisco andat the opera in New York, and of a woman trying to ride in the ladies’ car onthe Memphis and Charleston Railroad. This cluster of cases demonstrated thatracial discrimination was not solely a Southern problem. The 8–1 ruling inUnited States v. Stanley (known as the Civil Rights Cases) held that theequal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applied only to states andnot to individual acts of discrimination by a person or a businessestablishment. The decision meant, therefore, that discriminatory acts byprivate persons or entities were beyond the safeguards of the FourteenthAmendment or federal jurisdiction; a person wronged had redress only to statecourts. The Court further declared unconstitutional the Civil Rights Act of1875, which only eight years earlier had explicitly guaranteed all citizens “thefull and equal enjoyment of accommodations, facilities, and privileges of inns,public conveyances on land and water, theaters and other places of publicamusement.”17 [notes02.html#ch28fn_17a] All that Douglass, the black press, andthe Louisville convention had demanded about federal enforcement of black rightsseemed suddenly dissolved in this bitter betrayal. Soon Jim Crow could marchthrough an open door; night had fallen.The Supreme Court had just eviscerated one of the greatest achievements ofReconstruction. From the Slaughter-House Cases of 1873, to United States v.Cruikshank in 1876, and on down to Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, FourteenthAmendment jurisprudence consistently embraced a states’ rights interpretation ofequal protection of the law. A conservative conception of federalism, areluctance to sanction federal enforcement of civil and political rights, muchless intervention, in the states gave racial equality a tenuous and ultimatelydisastrous trajectory in American courts. Today it can seem astonishing that awar and a reimagined Constitution expanding equal rights to all citizens couldbe won by extraordinary uses of federal military and legal power, and throughenormous bloodshed, yet for generations to follow those achievements could beprotected only by local authority in the states. But such was the hold ofstates’ rights doctrines on legal thinking that it led to what theconstitutional historian Akhil Amar has called “these stingy Reconstructiondecisions.” The Republicans who wrote the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendmentstragically retreated from their own creation with a stultified constitutionalimagination.18 [notes02.html#ch28fn_18a]On October 22, one week after the Civil Rights Cases decision, astanding-room-only mass protest meeting was held in Washington. Two thousandpeople crammed into Lincoln Hall as Lewis Douglass read eight resolutionsdemanding enforcement of civil rights. Frederick Douglass delivered the keynotespeech, in which he announced that the issues were so crucial that he wrote outhis words. He announced that black folk and their allies had been “grievouslywounded, wounded in the house of our friends.” He invoked the Dred Scott case,Bleeding Kansas, the Fugitive Slave Act, to give weight to the moment’s anxiety.The Court’s action “makes us feel,” he declared, “as if someone were stamping onthe graves of our mothers, or desecrating our sacred temples of worship.” Afterso many years of struggle, blood, defeat, and then triumph, the moment, Douglassintoned, felt like a “moral cyclone” blowing through history.19[notes02.html#ch28fn_19a]Douglass devoted much of the speech to the Fourteenth Amendment, quotingverbatim section one. The language of that amendment was likely much more commoncoin in American awareness then than it is now a century and a half later. Heblasted the logic of states’ rights, so reinforced in the Court decision: “Itgives to a South Carolina, or a Mississippi railroad conductor, more power thanit gives to the National Government.” And “it gives a hotel-keeper” with“prejudice born of the rebellion” the authority to expel black men and women ashe so wished. Douglass further delivered a lawyerly argument about “intention”in law and the Constitution. During more than seventy years of slavery times, hesaid, the notion of original intention had been constantly invoked in support ofevery kind of proslavery interest. Now, he asked, why could not the intention ofthe Fourteenth Amendment—citizenship rights for all Americans—be the new guideto jurisprudence? Poignantly Douglass demanded, “O for a Supreme Court of theUnited States which shall be as true to the claims of humanity, as the SupremeCourt formerly was to the demands of slavery!”20 [notes02.html#ch28fn_20a]Moreover, as he did now in so many public utterances, Douglass interpreted theCourt’s decision of 1883 as a failure of historical memory and nationalcommitment to the fruits of Union victory. So important was the Civil RightsCases to Douglass that he devoted a chapter to it in the revised version of Lifeand Times, the bulk of which was a reprinting of his Washington speech. As heintroduced it, he contended that “the future historian will turn to the year1883 to find the most flagrant example of this national deterioration.” Whiteracism, he remarked, seemed to grow in proportion to the “increasing distancefrom the time of the war.” Douglass blamed not only the passing of time, but,more important, the spirit of reconciliation between North and South. Justiceand liberty for blacks, he maintained, had lost ground from “the hour that theloyal North . . . began to shake hands over the bloody chasm.” Douglass saw theSupreme Court decision as part of a pattern of the corruption of historicalmemory. Thus he believed blacks could see the Court’s judgment only as a“bewildering surprise,” and an act of “absurdity and injustice.” “The surrenderof the national capital to Jefferson Davis in time of war,” he asserted, “couldhardly have caused a greater shock.”21 [notes02.html#ch28fn_21a]Douglass’s reactions echoed widely across the black press. The ChristianRecorder counseled defiance, calling the Court decision “humiliating” and“maddening,” and urging blacks to prepare to live in a segregated society. Theanniversary year that began in the commemorative spirit about emancipation gaveway to a deepening sense of fear and betrayal. The New York Globe said thedecision had made blacks feel “as if they had been baptized in ice water.” TheBoston Hub thought the ruling “worthy of the Republic fifty years ago.” And theDetroit Plaindealer joined the chorus, likening the decision to “an avalanche,carrying our fondest hopes down the hill of despair.”22[notes02.html#ch28fn_22a]By November, Douglass had carefully read the famous lone dissent of Justice JohnMarshall Harlan and wrote him a letter of admiration and gratitude. With“boundless satisfaction,” Douglass consumed the dissent and its forceful claimthat the “recent amendments to the Constitution have been sacrificed by a subtleand ingenious verbal criticism.” Douglass felt so moved that he wished thedissent could “be scattered like the leaves of autumn over the wholecountry . . . and be read by every citizen.” He felt heartened by Harlan’scondemnation of both racial discrimination and the tortured claims of states’rights doctrine. Harlan had helped Douglass find voice to condemn the justice’s“Brothers on the Supreme Bench,” and to find access to “how they could at thisday and in view of the past commit themselves and the country to such asurrender of national dignity and duty.” Douglass stood angry and baffled at themajority’s states’ rights vision, which he deemed “superficial . . . smooth andlogical within the narrow circumference beyond which they do not venture.” Suchwas the stranglehold of states’ rights on Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence inthe late nineteenth century; the orator wanted the dissenter to know that blackAmericans had his back. If Harlan felt “alone on the bench,” Douglass assuredthe justice, “you are not alone in the country.”23 [notes02.html#ch28fn_23a]• • •In his personal life, Douglass too had chosen not to be alone. On January 24,1884, he and Helen Pitts put in nearly a full workday at the Recorder’s Office,where Helen was one of the copyists. She would have worked closely that day,like others, with Lewis and Rosetta. Sometime earlier that day, Douglass hadpaid a short visit to the city clerk’s office to purchase a $1 marriage license.According to a prurient reporter for the National Republican, the famous manseemed “hurried and flurried” as he took the chief clerk aside for a “whisperedconversation,” then “sheepishly . . . walked out.” By early evening, bothDouglass and his new bride had gone home, he to Cedar Hill and she to herapartment on E Street, to change into more formal clothing, Helen appearing forher wedding in a “garnet velvet and silk” dress, and her beau in a new blacksuit. By 6:00 p.m. a carriage delivered them to the parsonage of the ReverendFrancis J. Grimké, the young minister and activist who had been born in SouthCarolina in 1850 to a liaison between a white planter and a biracial slavemother, at the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian Church, 1608 R Street. With formersenator Blanche Bruce and his wife, Josephine, and Grimké’s wife, CharlotteForten Grimké, the abolitionist and author of a multivolume autobiography, asthe only witnesses or guests, the almost sixty-six-year-old Douglass and theforty-six-year-old Pitts were secretly married.24 [notes02.html#ch28fn_24a]Quickly the secret exploded.Image [../images/f0649-01.jpg]Blanche K. Bruce, senator from Mississippi, c. 1880.Douglass had not told any of his children, with whom he worked daily, and otherthan Grimké, it does not appear that Douglass told many other associates orfriends. Helen too had kept the plans largely secret from her family, most ofwhom soon condemned her. According to press notices, Rosetta learned of thewedding from a reporter who informed her before she left the Recorder’s Office,leaving her stunned and “visibly affected.” Reporters stalked the newlyweds backto Helen’s residence, where Douglass was compelled to address them from a porch,where he supposedly “smiled,” but declared the questions “rather cheeky.”25[notes02.html#ch28fn_25a] Just why Frederick and Helen had kept their intentionsso quiet says much about his struggles with the perils of fame and a scandalouspress; it also demonstrates just how shocking their racially transgressive actwould be to both blacks and whites. If they had announced even a briefengagement period, they might have faced scurrilous attacks and pressure todesist. So they simply married as quietly as possible and let the storm blowafter the fact. Not telling Rosetta, Lewis, Frederick Jr., or Charles and theirfamilies may be a measure of just how much the patriarch understood the volatilecomplexities of his extended domestic circle in Washington.The Douglass children swallowed much of their surprise anddisappointment—perhaps less at Helen’s whiteness than at not being consulted—asthey kept their demeanor in talking to the solicitous press. Lewis told areporter, “Father had a right to marry whom he pleased, and that is the way weregard it.” Rosetta too kept the stiff upper lip, but admitted publicly, “Iwould have preferred at his age he should not have married again.” Rosetta’ssister-in-law Louisa had been running Cedar Hill since Anna’s death, but nowthat Helen moved in immediately, Louisa left the big house, leading her brother,Nathan, to actions that would soon cause an uglier scandal. Rosetta also broughther adult daughter, Annie, away from Cedar Hill, believing her coexistence withHelen as the new mistress of the house would be untenable. Douglass may haveencouraged these departures for Helen’s sake.26 [notes02.html#ch28fn_26a]Feelings ran raw.For a month and beyond the national press had a field day with this racial,sexual, and family drama. Headlines screamed, “A Black Man’s Bride”; “TheVenerable Colored Orator Takes a White Wife”; “His Queer Choice.” In variousnewspapers Helen’s age was continually lowered from her forties to herthirties—in one report “a red head white girl 33 years old”—while Douglass insome reports greatly aged, becoming as old as seventy-five as he pursued thismuch younger woman. At forty-four and forty-six, Rosetta and Helen were nearlythe same age. Helen was sometimes portrayed as “low” born or “common.” Douglassunderwent a public shaming by many black critics. Editorial writers thought themarriage was ruining the great man “politically and socially,” that it had“dethroned him” from racial leadership, and that the Sage of Cedar Hill had made“the fatal error of his life.” A Petersburg, Virginia, paper announced the“Negro Idol has fallen,” and from Little Rock, Arkansas, he was accused ofbranding blacks “by his own act as inferior to the white race, which reversesthe labors of his life.” The Washington (DC) Grit called the marriage “anational calamity.” And in Pittsburgh a correspondent worried about the fate of“black blood” and denounced Douglass: “We have no further use for him as aleader. His picture hangs in our parlor, we will hang it in the stable.”27[notes02.html#ch28fn_27a]Hyperbole aside, this was the nineteenth century, and there had never been suchan open interracial marriage by such a famous and important black man. Nopeople, moreover, understood better than African Americans how white men had forso long exploited black women for desire and power, and at a time when theircommunities’ safety and basic liberties were under violent attack and legalsubordination, racial pride easily felt wounded. For some, Douglass’s weddingseemed like a collective loss or even disgrace. Occasionally a black punditreached for psychological explanations to grasp the great man’s blunder. InSpringfield, Ohio, a writer worried that Douglass’s mind was “succumbing to theinfluences of a second childhood.”28 [notes02.html#ch28fn_28a]But Douglass was still in his right mind and he had his defenders. BlancheBruce, old friend Robert Purvis, Howard University professor James M. Gregory,and the New York editor T. Thomas Fortune all honored the old abolitionist’sright to marry whom he pleased. Purvis likened the controversy to “making amountain out of a mole hill,” Bruce said it was “not the public’s business,” andGregory admired the leader’s desire to “thoroughly Americanize his race.” Theresentful nemesis Richard Greener, however, snidely called the marriage“inconsistent,” accusing Douglass of preferring his own race when engaged in“office-getting and giving,” but going white in his wife selection. Douglass didreceive personal comfort from abroad. He had not alerted his old companion JuliaGriffiths Crofts of his marital intentions. But by mid-February from Englandcame Julia’s letter indicating that Rochester friends had sent her a pressclipping about the wedding. “I, as one of your truest and warmest friends,”wrote the aging Julia, “hasten to send you (and Mrs. Douglass) my most sincerecongratulations.” She hoped that the union would give him “true happiness in theevening of your days,” and she was eager to hear from Douglass’s “own hand a fewparticulars regarding the lady.”29 [notes02.html#ch28fn_29a]In the swirl of scandalmongering press coverage, with sighs of disdain, Douglassfelt the need to defend himself and his basic rights. He had long been a verypublic figure, and he had sought such distinction, but nothing about hispersonal life had ever received this much attention. On the day after themarriage, he allowed a Washington Post reporter to interview him at Cedar Hill.Douglass refused to be baited by sensationalism. But the encounter in his parlorillustrates the late nineteenth century’s version of what we have come to knowin late-twentieth- and early-twenty-first-century politics and media as theblurred line between the public and the private. Why was Douglass’s marriage toa white woman, whatever her age or background, anyone’s business but his own? Inhis case, the answer is partly fame, but mostly race.To the Post reporter, Douglass simply declared his marriage “not an event ofpublic moment.” His action was a family matter, and he owed no one anyexplanation or apology. His labors for justice, he continued, had never beensolely “because I am a negro, but because I am a man.” Then Douglass tried, ashe had so many times before, to puncture the logic of racial thinking; heinsisted that he did not think with his race, but with his heart and head. HelenPitts was only a “few shades lighter than myself,” he declared, and he pushedhis interlocutor to face the ultimate absurdity about “complexions.” Douglassdrew indirectly from Acts 17 as he left the reporter with some instructions.“God Almighty made but one race,” said the old prophetic orator. “I adopt thetheory that in time the varieties of races will be blended into one. . . . Youmay say that Frederick Douglass considers himself a member of the one race thatexists.” J. M. Dalzell, an Ohio politician with whom Douglass had worked on theGarfield campaign, wrote in the same week with concern about what the marriagewould do to the black leader’s “greatness.” Tongue in cheek, in a widelyreprinted public response, Douglass said he would say “farewell to all mygreatness” and demanded that Dalzell stumble out of his racist assumptions. Amillion Americans were of mixed blood, said Douglass, due to the historicalexploitation of black women by white men. “It would seem that what the Americanpeople object to is not the mixture of the races, but honorable marriage betweenthem.” Douglass had learned that if “God . . . hath made of one blood allnations of men,” he also “giveth to all life, and breath, and all things.” Amongall those things—natural rights—was the right to marry whom one pleased.30[notes02.html#ch28fn_30a]No matter how much Douglass tried to protect her, Helen became ensnarled in thecontroversy as well. She took significant social risks in marrying Douglass;members of her immediate family, including her father, Gideon, and her uncleHiram, with whom she lived in Washington, ostracized her and never reconciled.Her mother, Jane Wells Pitts, and her two sisters eventually, if slowly,accepted the union and came to visit at Cedar Hill. Descendant Katy O’dell,whose great-grandmother was Helen’s first cousin in western New York, where thePittses were prosperous farmers, remembers the lore of the scandalous marriageto Douglass, as it was passed down in her family. Helen endured a vicious press,including all manner of falsehoods and rumors that her family sought to have themarriage annulled.31 [notes02.html#ch28fn_31a]Helen was well educated and possessed a remarkable history of activism inwomen’s rights, temperance, and antislavery. She had long ago taken personalrisks. Raised in a strong abolitionist home influenced by the rise of theLiberty Party in the 1840s and 1850s, she had first met Douglass when she wasfourteen, in 1852, when he visited the family farm on a lecture tour. Few blackswere in or around the town of Honeoye, with its two thousand residents, and nonein the Union church. One of her sisters took a master’s degree at CornellUniversity, and Helen and her other sister, Jennie, spent three years at GeneseeSeminary in Lima, New York. From there she went to Mount Holyoke College forwomen in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she graduated in 1859.32[notes02.html#ch28fn_32a]Image [../images/f0653-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass with Helen Pitts Douglass, seated, and her sister JenniePitts, Washington, DC, c. 1885. In Helen’s family, only her sister, and later toan extent, her mother, supported the marriage.A patriotic supporter of the Union war effort and especially emancipation, byApril 1863, Helen Pitts secured a position as a teacher for the AmericanMissionary Association in Norfolk, Virginia. Occupied by Union forces since1862, Norfolk became a major center for freedmen’s education as well as therecruitment of black Union soldiers. This was baptism in activism under greatstress; Douglass did not see or visit a contraband camp himself until the end ofthe war. For nearly a year Helen taught former slaves of all ages whopassionately desired education. At first she was one of only four teachers for agrowing throng of hundreds of pupils, and the labor in this crossroads ofwar-born disease seriously threatened her health. She caught malaria among otherailments. The debilitated twenty-six-year-old stayed into 1864, but was forcedto take leave and go home to the healthier western New York. Her supervisorsfound Helen courageous and “indispensable.” She worked closely with many blacksoldiers and collected their petitions about army abuses of their own health andrights. Helen hoped to return to the war front, but she could not recover fromillness for what appears to have been some years. What is certain is thatHelen’s experiences of emancipation and war were not in any way the abstractionsthey might have been for other Northern reformers.33 [notes02.html#ch28fn_33a]For most of Reconstruction Helen lived in western New York with her parents. Butin 1877 she came to Washington, taking up a room with her uncle Hiram, animmediate neighbor of the Douglasses’. She did some teaching, but by September1881 she took a patronage job from the recorder of deeds, who was happy to hirehis neighbor’s niece. In many ways Helen was overqualified, but did her job ascopyist processing deeds with zeal. Only one person ever suggested rumors of acourtship between Helen and her boss after Anna’s death, and that was her auntFrances Pitts, Hiram’s wife. Douglass objected about such “hints, innuendos orimplications” in a letter to Frances, and the matter fell silent until thesudden wedding. However much Frederick and Helen secretly shared a desire totest America’s obsession with race, what they did clearly find in common wasaffection, experience, companionship, and a growing love.34[notes02.html#ch28fn_34a] The public furor over their marriage was not for thefainthearted; Douglass seems to have known that this spiritual, smart, confidentveteran of the freedmen’s schools and hospitals could take it and endure. What’smore, she was perfectly willing to assume the role of Mrs. Douglass, fellowtraveler and fellow reader.• • •From inside Douglass’s conflicted family, the newlyweds had no peace for sometime. Nathan Sprague had come to despise the hand that fed him, and he wantedrevenge. Louisa, Nathan’s sister, had lived and worked in the Douglass home formore than ten years. Frederick and Anna had taken her in as a daughter, even asshe labored at many household chores. In the middle of the marriage controversy,and from an array of motives—extortion, resentment of Helen, embitteredhostility to his father-in-law, and perhaps even self-loathing—Nathan engagedThomas J. Mackey, an attorney and former judge, as well as a former Confederateand Democrat with no love for black leaders, to bring a lawsuit againstDouglass. The Washington Star and other newspapers were more than happy to fanthe flames of this ugly family drama. It is not clear how much Rosettaencouraged this scurrilous public humiliation of her father, but she did notstop her husband’s action. Before it was over Nathan, Douglass himself, his sonsLewis and Charles, and even Louisa weighed in all too publicly with accusationsand denunciations. Lewis told reporters that he did not believe Louisa hadpushed the matter at all, but that Nathan wanted to injure Douglass. Charlespointed to all of Nathan’s employment and business failures, accused him ofblatant ingratitude and of a “malicious conspiracy” to ruin Douglass.35[notes02.html#ch28fn_35a] As February dragged on, the Sage of Cedar Hill musthave wondered how he could escape and hide from public view.Unmistakably, Nathan wanted money, but he also sought to politically ruin hiswife’s famous father. Nathan originally asked for $2,640 in back pay for hissister’s service, accusing Douglass in effect of treating her like a servilelaborer. On the day the formal writ was filed and delivered to Douglass,February 16, the total read $2,025, with over $600 subtracted for clothingprovided over the years. The nefarious Nathan had fed all manner of shadyinformation to the press. He addressed Douglass directly via reporters. “Youplace yourself on a lofty pedestal and flaunt your assumed dignity before thepublic,” said the unemployed father of Rosetta’s six children. “I have viewedyour marriage more in sorrow than in anger, and as to that have accorded to youthe charity of my silence. . . . I sincerely trust that your white wife willexperience more justice and consideration at your hands than you ever gave yourworthy colored wife.” Nathan claimed his suit was entirely about money, and thatDouglass had reneged on a “contract” for certain monthly wages. In the nextbreath he stated that Louisa did not dislike Helen “because she was white orbecause she married Mr. Douglass. Louisa disliked her long before that.”36[notes02.html#ch28fn_36a] We can only begin to fathom the class and racialresentments at the root of these sentiments. Douglass did the only thing hecould: he struck back in the same newspapers.The father-in-law accused Sprague of blackmail and “taking advantage of thesupposed unpopularity of his recent marriage.” In a formal letter released tothe press, Douglass said he had never hired Louisa at any time, but that hewould “submit to fair arbitration.” The money demanded for housework and asseamstress “is higher than I should have paid her had I offered to hire her.”Douglass accused Sprague of extortion; Douglass dove into the sordid details andgave almost as much as he took: “I knew nothing of Louisa as a seamstress,except in making and mending her own clothes and the clothes of your ownchildren while she and they were being fed at my table and sheltered under myroof.” Douglass maintained that he had several times tried to pay Louisa but shedeclined. He further told Sprague that he was “not favorably impressed with theextraordinary manner” in which the younger man had gone about this “cowardly”affair, especially “the monstrous story that I am worth $200,000 and much otherstuff and nonsense.”37 [notes02.html#ch28fn_37a]Louisa was the one most caught in a terrible bind; she was a single black womanin need of work and never set foot again at Cedar Hill. Douglass settled out ofcourt; he paid Louisa $645, and she and her opportunistic brother dropped thecase. She and Rosetta likely forced Sprague to go silent to get this familydisaster out of the papers. Before Washington papers moved on to othersensations, however, the Douglasses had to endure one more awful, if painfullytrue, joke. The aptly named Washington Grit said that P. T. Barnum “could make amint of money out of this couple [Helen and Frederick] if they would consent togo on exhibition.”38 [notes02.html#ch28fn_38a]• • •In the midst of the controversy over his marriage and the Sprague lawsuit,Douglass exchanged letters with Ottilie Assing. Since the fall of 1881, Assinghad made Florence her base in Europe in her frustrating, hopeless struggle tomake claims on the will of her deceased sister, Ludmilla. Assing had alsoencountered many pages of Ludmilla’s diaries that only deepened the hatredOttilie felt for her sister even in death. Alone and as usual fiercelyindependent, the indefatigable traveler went on tour through southern Italy,much of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and then to Paris by 1884. Ottiliecarried on a correspondence with Douglass, and especially with the Koehlers andothers in her old “gang.” A long silence seems to have ensued between Frederickand Ottilie during 1882, and for a long time after Anna’s death. He received acondolence letter from Sylvester Koehler, but, so far as we know, none fromAssing, who had spent more than twenty years despising and wishing Anna out ofher husband’s life. Neither Anna’s death nor Douglass’s emotional travail insummer 1883 are anywhere mentioned in an extant Assing letter. Douglass himselfvanished from any of her extant letters to other friends during the final twoyears of her life, which were spent as the intrepid, and at times joyous iflonely, wanderer through the Alps and many European capitals. In Munich she evenfound a new outlet as a writer in a radical socialist journal.39[notes02.html#ch28fn_39a] It is hardly likely that Douglass would have informedAssing of his marriage to Helen Pitts beforehand, since he kept it a secret fromhis own family.Sometime during 1884 Assing became aware of cancerous tumors in her breast. Shehad found many friends with whom to stay for weeks at a time during her travels,but in what her biographer considers a wise judgment, she likely did not want toimpose the “indignity, humiliation of sickness and dying” on any of them. Shewas fundamentally homeless, as Maria Diedrich has shown. But to interpret herdemise through the German Romantic literary tradition, the idealization ofsuicide shaped so much by Goethe’s Werther, can be only one among otherspeculative explanations. Surely it is one important context, and an outlookinfluenced by however she had become aware of Douglass’s marriage to HelenPitts. But despair of Assing’s kind is born of myriad roots, of many years ofpsychological turmoil and depression, and certainly now including the terribledeterminism of breast cancer. On August 21, 1884, on a sunny afternoon, OttilieAssing walked from the Hôtel d’Espagne to the Bois de Boulogne, the huge bucolicpark in the Sixteenth Arrondissement in Paris. She sat on a bench alone andswallowed a vial of potassium cyanide. When found, her elegantly dressed bodywas taken to the Paris morgue, where two weeks ensued before a German friendidentified her. With assistance from the American consul in Paris, Assing wasinterred in the Cimetière de la Morgue in Ivry on September 13.40[notes02.html#ch28fn_40a]Exactly when and how Douglass learned of Ottilie’s suicide we do not know. Buton November 4, 1884, he wrote a revealing letter to his old Rhode Island friendMartha Greene. He had just returned from stumping across the Midwest for JamesG. Blaine and the Republican ticket that fall. He felt “irrepressibly sad” atreceiving confirmed news “of the death of my dear friend Miss Assing—who issupposed to have committed suicide on account of what she considered herincurable cancer on her left breast.” When he learned of the illness, wroteDouglass, “I felt and have felt afraid that she would do precisely as she isreported to have done.”41 [notes02.html#ch28fn_41a] A mourning Douglasscontrolled his words, but in death he wrote more openly, so far as the recordshows, than he ever before had about Assing.“She has always maintained her right in case of being afflicted with anincurable disease to save herself the pain of a lingering death and her friendsthe trouble of caring for her,” offered Douglass. These kinds of informedsentiments may have stemmed from letters, or from long-remembered conversations.Douglass made no mention of Assing’s staunch atheism. But she had shared deeplypersonal trusts and pledges with Douglass. “I have lost a precious friend,” hetold Martha, and had “never had one more sincere.” When Assing “parted with mefor Europe four years ago, she told me that in case she should die abroad shehad made her will and left a fund of ten thousand dollars for my benefit.”Douglass did not seem to betray any guilt or remorse about the bequest of suchmoney. He simply reported that it was left in the care of a Henry Bergh, thehead of an organization against animal cruelty, a keen interest of Assing’s.Douglass further said he had always thought he would die before Ottilie, sincehe was two years older. He also reported that Assing had left him her books.Finally, he mentioned his knowledge of the cancer: “Her last letters to me spokeof incurable cancer but said nothing of her intention to shorten her days.” Insome ways, though, that Douglass could not quite face, Assing’s last letters tohim may have in effect been her suicide notes. For his part, he simply repeatedthat the death in Paris was “a distressing stroke to me.”42[notes02.html#ch28fn_42a] He offered no public or private tribute to Assing’sremarkable life and career as a voice in American reform.Back in 1871 Assing had drawn up a will, making Henry Bergh, president of theAmerican Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, her executor. At thattime she bequeathed a sum of $13,000 to “the Hon. Frederick Douglass, to payover the net interest and income therefrom by equal semi-annual payments . . .during the term of his natural life, in recognition of his noble labors in theantislavery cause.” He was also to receive Assing’s gold pens and books. Theyear 1871 had been a particularly difficult time financially for Douglass, withthe New National Era struggling to survive, his sons in and out of employments,and the pending move to Washington. Ottilie had also left a substantial sum to aniece, who by 1883 had died. Thus, the European traveler had made revisions inthe will. She also included some of her Hoboken friends, especially theKoehlers. Bergh informed Douglass of the death and these arrangements in anearly–October 1884 letter; Douglass may also have learned details in a publishedconversation with Bergh in the New York Tribune late that month. He received acopy of the will by January 1885, but as Bergh declined to be executor, Douglassand Sylvester Koehler enlisted a young former student of Assing’s and attorney,Hermann C. Kudlich, to handle the affairs.43 [notes02.html#ch28fn_43a]As Assing’s obituaries appeared in American papers in 1885, due to theprocessing of the will, most of them highlighted her suicide but especially thatshe left money, variously reported at either $18,000 or $20,000, to Douglass.The Washington Critic even ran a brief notice under the headline “FredDouglass’s Fortune.” One significant stipulation in the will garnered no publiccomment, but gained Douglass’s keen interest: “All the letters which will befound in my possession are to be destroyed immediately.” By the summer of 1885,Kudlich informed Douglass that he had done the painful duty. “I . . . destroyeda large number of carefully preserved packages of letters arranged according todate from the year 1830. They constituted a treasure in themselves and bore thesignatures of eminent men and women and I was reluctant to permit these preciousdocuments to disappear in smoke.” Was Assing protecting or, as Diedrich hasargued, “haunting” Douglass with these acts?44 [notes02.html#ch28fn_44a] Whatwere Douglass’s most personal views of this erasure of memory and evidence? Hisvirtual silence about “Miss Assing” had always been his only stance. The man whowrote so much to try to shape his life and legacy supported the destruction ofthis valuable historical record. Moving ahead with his personal life at thiscrossroads meant a good deal of private forgetting and public control. He hadlost a dear friend and left it at that.• • •In the presidential election of 1884, Grover Cleveland and the Democratsnarrowly won back the White House for the first time since 1861. The campaignwas raucous and full of ugly mudslinging. If the Reconstruction-era electionswere the most racist, this may have been the dirtiest in American history tothat date. The Republicans ran the former secretary of state James G. Blaine ofMaine. Blaine was popular with the Irish but somewhat notorious for financialshenanigans. Cleveland, the one-term governor of New York, an anti–Tammany Hallworthy, and bachelor, got mired in a paternity matter, an out-of-wedlock childfrom previous years. Cleveland won by only a razor-thin margin of undertwenty-five thousand votes out of almost 10 million cast. He took the electoralcollege 218–182, with an extremely close win in New York and by carrying theDemocratic “solid South” as well as all the border states. Blaine may haveblundered into the close loss in New York; while attending a sermon by aProtestant minister who attacked the Democrats as the party of “rum, Romanism,and rebellion,” he failed to react, losing some support with immigrantCatholics.45 [notes02.html#ch28fn_45a]Douglass took to the stump for Blaine, especially again where the RepublicanParty most desired his voice, the swing state of Indiana. But he startedcampaigning in August in New England and across New York, and this time hetraveled with Helen. They stayed quite visibly at the Parker House in Boston; inRhode Island Douglass spoke to a gathering of black Union veterans. The oratorjudged the earlier part of this tour, a kind of extended honeymoon at twothousand miles, and observed that he had “not been subjected to a singleinstance of indignity.” They vacationed at Niagara Falls, went up the St.Lawrence River, and visited the Thousand Islands area, as well as other parts ofCanada. Such experiences told Douglass that the country did not need more laws;it needed to enforce existing ones. In Indianapolis he spoke to four thousand ina baseball park after a torchlight parade. The Republican Party was for blacksthe good “helmsman,” the “capable pilot,” Douglass maintained, who could chartthe way through the troubled waters of the 1880s. He assured the throng, aracially and ethnically mixed audience, that despite his gray head and “voiceless powerful,” he would always remain a Republican “battling in your interest.”Republicans would keep “memory” and “truth” alive, he insisted, while Democratswould make the nation forget the past.46 [notes02.html#ch28fn_46a]In Syracuse in early October, at an anniversary of the Jerry Rescue (a fugitiveslave) of 1851, Douglass delivered an extraordinary speech about memory: “It isnot well to forget the past. Memory was given to man for some wise purpose.” Hewas worried about sectional reconciliation and its costs for blacks, especiallyin this election year. Douglass summoned remembrance of the vast transformationof the Civil War era; it could make one “almost realize the feeling of John,” hesaid, “when he saw in the apocalyptic vision a new heaven and a new earth.” ButAmericans were “far more likely to forget too soon, than remember too long, thehistory of the great American conflict with slavery.” Douglass reminisced aboutall the deceased abolitionists in the New York region, then turned his attentionto current race relations. Mobs and lynchings were escalating. “This color hateis so universal and so intense.” Douglass especially analyzed the socialimplications of whites’ racist expectations of blacks. “Everybody is ready tohelp him [a black man] on his downward way,” he observed. “But if he aspires tobe a man, and his course is upward, his way will be disputed at every turn.”47[notes02.html#ch28fn_47a]The black man was the universal subject on everyone’s mind in the Gilded Age.“He is pictured on our street corners, heard in our songs, seen and talked of inall our market places.” Douglass insisted that nothing less than “the wheels ofthe world’s moral progress must be reversed.” It was as if Gilded Age whitesupremacy had become a soul-killing hydra worse than slavery itself. He stillput his faith in an ultimate jubilee rooted in faith (“the steady light ofstars”), in ideas and laws. Ever the moralist and the believer in politics, hebreathed a hope that in these darkening days, the cause of justice, “like theghost of the murdered Hamlet, will appear and reappear.” Even more poignantly,the old abolitionist reached deep into his spiritual and rhetorical well.Paraphrasing John 11:11, he demanded hope. “The assumption that the cause of thenegro is a dead issue is an utter illusion. For the moment he may be buriedunder the dust and rubbish of endless discussion concerning civil service,tariff, and free trade, labor and capital . . . but our Lazarus is not dead. Heonly sleeps.”48 [notes02.html#ch28fn_48a] Douglass often drew upon this biblicalstory of miraculous rebirth, on its anguished but affirming fusion of life withdeath.This kind of faith in historical and moral rebirth was much in need after theRepublican defeat that fall. After twenty-four years, what Douglass called in apostelection interview “the old exploded slave power” was back in charge. Apolitical force “opposed to negro citizenship, negro equality before law, negroeducation, and negro progress,” and its constitutionalism defined by “thedoctrine of state sovereignty,” threatened to reduce black people “tosemi-slavery.” Press reports from across the country, especially emanating fromDemocratic regions, confirmed the case for fear. Under headlines in the New YorkTribune such as “Dixie, Victorious, at Last Exults” came stories of celebrationin the South of a return to the “white man’s country,” rule by the “proudAnglo-Saxon race, whose courage, genius and energy rescued this country frombarbarism.” “Africa has been vanquished, and it is settled forever,” announced aLynchburg, Virginia, paper. In some Southern towns election celebrationsinvolved joyous displays of Confederate flags, uniforms, and other symbols,including mock slave auctions.49 [notes02.html#ch28fn_49a]In late 1884 and into 1885, Douglass came under stinging criticism from someblacks for not resigning his recorder’s post in the Cleveland administration. Asearly as November 29 a black editor, Howard S. Smith, attacked Douglass andBlanche Bruce as “renegades,” claiming they had come to support Cleveland andthat the two Washington functionaries “live solely for themselves and not forthe race.” The Sage of Anacostia tried to ignore this kind of ugly harping, butas usual he could not. He saved his fullest defense for the second edition ofLife and Times, where he pointed out that the recorder’s position was not afederal job, but a thoroughly local matter. He had been employed by the Districtof Columbia, his salary the result of a fee-based system determined by the workdone by himself and his employees. But his defense rested primarily on an imageof Cleveland, despite his party’s evils, as an advocate of civil service reform,of keeping professional government workers in office based on performance andnot on party spoils. Cleveland did keep Douglass in the job for well over ayear, which was so important to Rosetta, Lewis, Frederick Jr., Charles, andtheir families. The elder Douglass based his strongest case against resigning,though, on the lack of home rule in the District of Columbia. The District wasunder congressional control, its citizens a “disfranchised people,” strugglingunder “plenty of taxation, but no representation.” The issue of District homerule is still mired in a partisan morass today. Douglass also admitted thatdespite all his bitter political differences with Cleveland, this president hadinvited him and Helen to numerous White House receptions, unfazed by theinterracial marriage. Douglass thought these social gestures remarkable at atime when “false friends of both races were loading me with reproaches.”50[notes02.html#ch28fn_50a]• • •From 1884 to 1886, Douglass tried to find a new equilibrium between his privatepeace and happiness with Helen, and the despairing and dangerouspublic-political climate. He frequently had to face the impression among youngerblack leaders that he had become irrelevant. He and Helen appeared frequently inmany public venues, including front pews in major churches in Washington, wherewhite congregants were sometimes outraged at their presence, as at the prominentFirst Presbyterian Church in 1885. With such incidences so often splashed in thepress, Douglass had to deny publicly that he had tried to rent a pew close tothe president’s pew. Douglass always tried humor in these instances, suggestingthat the “critics must be people who want his job as Recorder,” now that aDemocrat was president. He and Helen occasionally caused a great stir byattending a session of Congress and sitting in the “ladies gallery,” whereuponall business stopped during the “craning of necks in all parts of the House,”and “opera glasses” flashing in the hands of members on the floor. The couple’slife was more public than they may have wished, but Helen also now took over andhosted receptions for invited guests at Cedar Hill, a practice never done whileAnna was alive. Unfortunately, funerals still visited regularly at the mansionon the heights. On February 9, 1886, Frederick Aaron Douglass, son of FrederickJr. and Virginia Douglass, died at age fifteen. He was a successful student atthe Howard Normal School. Douglass almost never commented on these recurringdeaths of his grandchildren, many more of which would darken his household inthe coming year.51 [notes02.html#ch28fn_51a]During the mid and late eighties, one of the sons, as well as Nathan Sprague,occasionally fell into more legal trouble either in lawsuits or in scrapes withthe police. Douglass himself continued to carry on open disputes with some ofhis black rivals. Beginning in the 1884 election year, John Mercer Langston andthe recorder sparred, often viciously, with their scraps always becomingbrutally personal, over the usefulness of conventions and Republican loyalty.Langston believed blacks ought to “divide up between the parties” with theirvotes. Langston accused Douglass of convening black conventions to achieve acabinet position in a Republican administration. Personal vitriol seemed to knowno limit for Langston in judging his rival’s ambitions and character. Langstoncharged Douglass with the “climax” of “marrying a white woman and announcingthat there is not a drop of black blood in his veins.” Worse, he aimed atDouglass’s alleged greed. “We have been pouring money into his pockets for yearsbecause he is a colored man. . . . It is enough to make a man sick to hear himprate about his Caucasion blood.” Langston further ground in the knife about theold issue of the failure of the Freedmen’s Bank, which he attributed to theformer slave’s “insane itching desire for prominence.”52[notes02.html#ch28fn_52a]This meltdown between two titans only got worse in the coming two to threeyears. Langston’s son was indicted for murder in the District of Columbia, andby early 1886 the lawyer accused the recorder of trying to get the sonconvicted. Douglass had no choice but to fire back more than once, accusingLangston of a “murderous assault on my reputation,” and with being a “heartlessmaligner.” The Washington Bee claimed its reporter overheard a chance encounterbetween the two men in January 1886, at which Langston reportedly said toDouglass, “I hate you, sir! I hate the ground upon which you walk!” Some blackreaders of the press coverage of this kind of ugly personal warfare were likelyentertained, and others sickened.53 [notes02.html#ch28fn_53a]In March 1886, President Cleveland did finally decide to replace Douglass asrecorder, appointing a black lawyer from Albany, New York, James C. Matthews.The two men exchanged letters and had a smooth transition, with some ofDouglass’s children staying on as employees. When asked by reporters about hisfuture plans, Douglass said he was considering taking a trip to Europe, and thathe might now spend the “remainder of my days in peaceful retirement.” TheBrooklyn Eagle declared a kind of official “Retirement of Frederick Douglass,”in a bold headline, as it also claimed the great man had “made and saved afortune” from public money.54 [notes02.html#ch28fn_54a] In such reports, thetrip to Europe survived as the only secure fact.Image [../images/f0664-01.jpg]John Mercer Langston, professor of law at Howard University, 1870s.Douglass knew the Lazarus story well. He knew that Jesus had been stoned forblasphemy before and after his raising Lazarus from the dead. Deep in its tragicheart the story was about faith. Douglass hardly knew what to do about miracles,although something akin to that is what he sometimes wished for in history andin his own life. Above all, from the Lazarus tale and from his long experience,personal and public, he came to understand the utterly intertwined nature oflight and darkness, love and hatred, life and death. “Except a corn of wheatfall into the ground and die,” God said to his doubters, “it abides alone; butif it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.”55 [notes02.html#ch28fn_55a] Without ajob at sixty-eight years old, some of Douglass had died even as he chose newlife."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 29--------------------------------------------------------------------------------BORN TRAVELERMan is by nature a migratory animal . . . a born traveler.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1886In April 1886, in the burgeoning black community of Washington, DC, considerablecontroversy arose over the anniversary of emancipation in the capital. Two rivalcelebrations took place, one organized by the editor of the Washington Bee,Calvin Chase, and a faction that had grown around him. This year they planned amore decorous parade than ever. A second faction emerged around a saloonkeepernamed Perry Carson. Both factions conducted parades on April 16, with the Carsongroup, calling themselves the “people’s procession,” managing the largerperformance, culminating in Lincoln Park. The Chase group held evening speechesat the Israel Bethel Colored Methodist Church, with Douglass delivering thekeynote. The old orator found the competitive parades “mortifying” but cautionedthat the “best of men will sometimes differ.” Such rivalries and controversiescontinued for years over the anniversary.1 [notes02.html#ch29fn_1a]Douglass delivered a full-throated jeremiad against the depressing state ofAmerican race relations, and especially at the federal government’s refusal toenforce law and protect black people. In an address infused with biblicalpassages and storytelling, the orator placed American emancipation in atradition dating back to when Moses “smote the Red Sea and the Hebrews passedsafely over from Egyptian bondage.” His aggressive attacks got him accused ofwaving the bloody shirt by Democrats. Indeed he did; in the face of all thepolitical violence in the South, Douglass wondered why the nation did not letforth a collective scream of pain. Drawing from Genesis, he declared, “How canI, how can you, how can any man with a heart . . . do otherwise when, louderthan the blood of Abel, the blood of his fellow man cries from the ground.”2[notes02.html#ch29fn_2a]Douglass accused both political parties of immoral inaction, although he chargedthe Democrats with outright complicity in murder. His people had been abandonedin the South, he maintained, and the nation had abdicated its responsibilities.He pointed specifically to the recent massacre of a dozen or more blacks at theCarrollton, Mississippi, courthouse. An attempt by a mob to lynch three blackmen accused of crimes exploded into a mass murder, about which the Mississippiauthorities refused even to hold an inquest. Douglass vividly captured a tragicnational mood that later generations of Americans know all too well: “The sadthing is that in the average American mind, horrors of this character havebecome so frequent since the slaveholding rebellion, that they excite neithershame nor surprise; neither pity for the slain, nor indignation for theslayers.” He used a verse from Alexander Pope, a line of which captured howinured American society had become to domestic terror as a part of politics: “Wefirst endure, then pity, then embrace.”3 [notes02.html#ch29fn_3a]Douglass ended on what he called a “moderate” hope in that springtime ofanguish. He took some solace from the belief that “the white people of thiscountry are asleep, but not dead.” He could also still trust that “both theconstitution of 1789 and the constitution with the fourteenth and fifteenthamendments” might still become “the law of the land for all the people.”4[notes02.html#ch29fn_4a] In speaking engagements that summer Douglass continuedto try to fashion hope from despair. But mostly, he planned with Helen a longand cherished trip to Europe. It was time to leave for a while the America ofturmoil and conflict and seek joy, spirit, and new knowledge in travel abroad.• • •In forty-five years, since he first took to the platform as a Garrisonianitinerant in 1841, Douglass had logged well in excess of one hundred thousandmiles on land and water in pursuit of both the cause of human freedom andequality as well as his own livelihood. More than perhaps any other American ofthe nineteenth century, Douglass had been traveling all of his adult life. Butnever like this—a private citizen on a grand European and classicalMediterranean tour intended as a vacation.Douglass had many reasons to escape the country and his life as he knew it in1886. The Douglasses had planned for an earlier departure, but several matterskept them at Cedar Hill through the summer. The old editor continued to endureall manner of criticism in the press, with one black Chicago paper evenattacking him for the “courtesy” of his resignation letter from the position ofrecorder to President Cleveland. The Senate, moreover, lagged on the approval ofhis successor at the Recorder’s Office. In late April he wrote to his friendFrancis Grimké that the dire state of violence and deteriorating race relationswas so “pressing as to claim nearly all my time and attention.” Then he quipped,“You will observe by the papers that I have almost as much trouble to get out ofoffice as some men do to get into office.” He wrote to one solicitous editor whowas trying to get Douglass to produce an article that the sheer multitude of“requests for contributions from my pen and pocket stagger me.”5[notes02.html#ch29fn_5a]And then, journalists just showed up at Cedar Hill without appointmentsrequesting interviews. He suffered through one of them in late May with areporter from the Washington Star who subsequently wrote a rather exotic pieceon Frederick and Helen. The writer misjudged the sixty-eight-year-old Douglassas seventy-six! He said the sage “looked like the King of Madagascar, or someland we have dimly heard of.” Then came detailed descriptions of facial andbodily features, his “chin and jaws,” the white mane of hair, of course, eventhe shape of his “nostrils.” Although identifying Douglass as mixed race, thereporter thought the “colored portion of him . . . probably the most vigorouselement.” The intrusive guest acknowledged Douglass’s great intelligence andfelt assured that “after visiting him white men who came away find nothing tocriticize in either taste or talk.” Mrs. Douglass was “neither stout nor thin”and reminded this reporter of “the matron or superintendent of somephilanthropic institution in which charity plays the principal part.” He furtheradmired her demonstrated “subordination . . . to her husband.”6[notes02.html#ch29fn_6a] Reading such reports surely made Frederick and Helenrelish sailing away to faraway lands.With a Baedeker guidebook in hand, the Douglasses departed New York harbor onSeptember 15 for an eight-day passage to Liverpool on the City of Rome, a560-foot-long steamer, launched in 1881 and considered one of the largest andmost beautiful ships afloat. It was Douglass’s third Atlantic crossing fromAmerica, and Helen’s first. Both Douglasses wrote diaries during theeleven-month journey, Frederick intermittently throughout their travels, butHelen only for the first three weeks. On the evening before the morning sail,they received a visit from Gustav Frauenstein, one of Ottilie Assing’s closestfriends in her old gang. Helen recorded a “pleasant visit” for the three ofthem. “We talked of Miss Assing,” said Helen, “& as the genial Dr left he threwhis arms around Frederick’s neck in a good old fashioned hug & kissed him,kissed me, and ran off the steamer.”7 [notes02.html#ch29fn_7a] PerhapsFrauenstein conveyed some further knowledge of Assing’s tragic demise, or of theestate, a portion of which Douglass may have used to pay for this long tour. ButDouglass left no remarks in his diary about the conversation.Both Frederick and Helen commented during the crossing on the majesty of thesea. Both read books about England in preparation for the first part of theirtour, she a work by Richard Grant White, England Without and Within, and heRalph Waldo Emerson’s widely acclaimed English Traits. The couple shared manyliterary tastes and conversations and by all indications were remarkablycompatible. Douglass hoped for solitude and to go unrecognized on the voyage.But that was not to be. Passengers asked him to deliver a speech, which heconsidered an “infliction.” With Douglass dreading another lecture while heimagined a vacation, Helen considered his discomfort to be “nonsense.” Shedescribed his shipboard “little address” as “over before anyone was ready forhim to stop.”8 [notes02.html#ch29fn_8a]The City of Rome docked in Liverpool on September 22. During a full week inLiverpool, Frederick and Helen walked the streets and visited art galleries,libraries, and churches. They both commented on the multitude of poor, barefootchildren and women with “babe in arms . . . singing in mournful . . . heartbreaking strains.” Douglass, however, honored what he observed as the “immenseenergy” of the English working people. In a visit to the town of Chester, theDouglasses toured the cathedral, and Frederick made his first of many commentson the nature of “Romanism” and its influence on European culture. Over andagain as their tour moved to the Continent and southward to Italy, Douglassreleased in his diary a level of anti-Catholicism that he had seldom expressedin public speeches. Helen wrote mostly with joy and awe. She observed themagnificence of the statuary in and around St. George’s Hall in Liverpool. Sheinsisted that they attend worship services most Sundays at Protestant churches.She also laced her diary with observations about how the public treated orviewed Douglass. “People will look at Frederick wherever we go,” Helen wrote,“but they wear no unpleasant expression. Many have a decided appearance ofinterest.” Sometimes she noted when an American recognized the famed orator and“accosted” him.9 [notes02.html#ch29fn_9a]Douglass had vainly hoped to see many old abolitionist comrades in England, onlyto realize that most were already dead. In Life and Times, he later trudgedthrough a “melancholy enumeration” of the English notables of antislavery fame,demonstrating his deep connections to them. He reconnected with Anna and EllenRichardson, the Quaker sisters, both now in their eighties, who had led theeffort forty years earlier to purchase his freedom. Most important, theDouglasses spent a full week in October staying with Julia Griffiths Crofts inher small town of St. Neots, just west of Cambridge. Elderly and widowed, Juliahosted them with charm and joy. Interestingly, Helen referred to their littlegroup as “the trio.” Douglass wrote nothing in his diary about the week withJulia; he had not seen her in twenty-six years. Helen honored Julia foraccepting them with open arms and marveled at experiencing her “first night in areal English home.” She loved the flat beautiful country roads ofCambridgeshire. They attended a Methodist church with Julia and took tea everyday somewhere special. And the “trio” made an excursion to see “all the gloriesof Cambridge,” including attending Evensong at the famed King’s Chapel. Helencalled it a time to be “treasured in memory forever.”10[notes02.html#ch29fn_10a] What this all meant to Douglass to spend such time ofsolemnity and beauty with these two women from different times in his life hedid not tell us.Before leaving England, Douglass was imposed on to speak at least once inBridgport. He also did an extensive interview with the London Daily News. Thereporter noted Douglass’s “features . . . of the negro type,” although he“nevertheless” seemed a “man born for distinction” and a “name all England isfamiliar with.” In the 1880s, though, Douglass’s fame still had to be couched inthe racialized claim that he represented “the one, and apparently only one,exception to the general laziness and ignorance of the black population in themidst of which he was born.” Decades after emancipation, parts of the Britishpress still marveled at how such a “cultured gentleman could have ever been aslave.”11 [notes02.html#ch29fn_11a] How old and tortured such notions must haveseemed to the famous tourist.Soon the touring couple crossed the Channel for the Continent and arrived inParis on October 20. They appear to have spent the rest of the fall in or aroundParis, staying at least two and a half months. Douglass ceased writing the diarywhen in Paris, although numerous press reports back in the United States hadtitles such as “Frederick Douglass in Paris.” In January 1887, Douglass wrote along piece about his observations on Parisian life, labor, and politics. Thecurious essay is full of his admiration as well as disdain for French society.In was sixteen years since the disaster of the Franco-Prussian War and thebloody Paris Commune. Douglass had little to say on that recent history, but headmired and cheered for the “possible permanency” of the French Republic. Hegreatly praised the dignity of labor, for men and women, among the busy andindustrious Parisians: “All labor is here held in honor, all useful callings arerespectable.” This would have been news to many of Paris’s working poor and tothe growing anarchist groups. Douglass was later fond of describing how warmlyhe was received when he visited the French Senate, but he did not deliverwell-informed observations on the country’s politics. He liked the ways thecity’s people conserved fuel in winter. But he was less enamored with their“street manners” and their “Sabbath customs” as they conducted many businessenterprises on Sundays. And he was intrigued to “notice much drinking, butlittle drunkenness.”12 [notes02.html#ch29fn_12a]Douglass was an honest, if parochial, American in Paris. He knew enough of thecity’s bloody and volatile history to be wary of a “deep shadow of a terribledisaster” that might at any time explode, and he saw an alarming level of“divergence of classes.” In later speeches he did stress how this city ofbeauty, fashion, and art had also “withstood the destructive shocks of twelverevolutions in a single century.” But like almost any other visitor to the cityof light, he marveled that no other place had done so much to “gratify theesthetic taste” of humanity. He was awed by the “miles of corridors” and the artat the Louvre. Douglass acknowledged the guidance around the city by TheodoreStanton, the son of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. He especially glowed with joy overmeeting the eighty-two-year-old Victor Schoelcher, French senator andabolitionist who had led the effort for French slave emancipation in 1848. Hewas invited to Schoelcher’s home for an extensive interview and, stunningly,found himself in the reformer’s study “surrounded by broken fetters and othercast-off paraphernalia of the slave system.”13 [notes02.html#ch29fn_13a] Back atCedar Hill, Douglass had already made his own parlors into a kind of museum ofAmerican abolitionism; he may have gained a few more ideas in Schoelcher’s den.By the time the couple left Paris to go south in early January, Douglass resumedbrief entries about various French towns and landmarks. “I am keeping a diary,”he wrote to his son Lewis in February, “and shall I live to get home be able totalk to you of my journeys.” A little later that month he said that he had“little time to write. . . . I am not writing anything for publication” (whichwas untrue). The towns of Dejun, Lyon, Avignon, Marseille, and Nice all garneredspecial attention, as the Douglasses reached the Mediterranean. In Lyon,Douglass searched carefully and in vain for the grave of his old AfricanAmerican friend Henry O. Wagoner’s son, who he knew had died in that town. AtMarseilles, Frederick “took Helen into a small boat and was rowed out to the oldChateau D’If made famous by the story of Monte Cristo by Alex. Dumas.” He lovedAvignon, the “quaintest, crookedest, and queerest” place they had seen, with itsnarrow streets and alleys. But Avignon was also the city of “popes,” and hereDouglass let loose his contempt for the “dogmas of the Romish faith.” “What ahorrible lie that Romish Church has palmed off upon the people of this and othercountries pretending that its Pope is the vice gerant of God. . . . How strangeit is that millions of sane men have believed this stupendous and most arrogantlie.”14 [notes02.html#ch29fn_14a] When he encountered the vast physical remnantsof feudalism and the historical power of Catholicism, Douglass was no culturalpluralist on a learning expedition.By mid-January, the Douglasses had traversed the southern French coast andarrived in Genoa in Italy. Strikingly, as Douglass moved southward in Europe, heremembered seeing more “black hair, black eyes, full lips and dark complexions.”He also observed that the “style of dress” with “gay colors” increased. Heattributed all of this to the “wisdom of Africa and the social disposition ofAfricans imitated.” By far, he was most taken in Genoa by Paganini’s violin,“treasured in a glass case” in a museum. Douglass loved the violin and was proudof his own modest ability to play it. In Life and Times, he would spend twopages capturing how moved he was by this one “sacred” object, this “old violinof wood, horsehair and catgut” that had “delighted thousands” with its musicalmagic.15 [notes02.html#ch29fn_15a]After a stop in Pisa, the city of Galileo, about whom Douglass mused whilevisiting the Leaning Tower, the couple arrived in Rome on January 19. Douglasscalled the moment the “day of days,” and soon he felt enveloped in the EternalCity’s magnificence. Douglass’s sense of history had never before been stirredquite like this. At every turn the “scenes and sounds” carried his “mind backover vast periods of history.” Standing in the dome of St. Peter’s Basilica, “nowords at my command,” wrote Douglass, could “fitly describe” his feelings ofawe. Yet, “in looking at its splendor,” he recorded, “one could not help beingdeeply impressed by its gorgeousness and perfection despite of its uttercontradiction to the life and lessons of Jesus.” But the more he saw of theVatican’s “treasures . . . of costly vestments ornamented with gold,silver . . . and all manner of precious stones,” the more this son of ProtestantAmerica became the foreigner and religious critic. “The sight of these things,”he wrote, “only increased my sense of the hollowness of the vast structure ofthe Romish Church and my conviction that Science must in the end do for thatchurch what time has done for the vast structures of kingly pride and power.”16[notes02.html#ch29fn_16a]But when Douglass walked through the “ancient greatness” of the Roman Forum, hecould only gush that he had “seen nothing more impressive and solemn, nothingthat tells so eloquently the story that all who live must die and at last, notonly for man, but for all his best endeavors it is dust to dust and ashes toashes.” Douglass relished, intellectually and spiritually, imagining “twothousand years” of the Roman ruins. In his narrative about Rome crafted afterreturning to America, he admitted to being “much more interested in the Rome ofthe past than in the Rome of the present,” by which he meant the city-stateruled by the Vatican. He wanted to know more of the “preaching of Paul eighteenhundred years ago than of the preaching of the priests and popes of today.” Hewanted to find the location of Paul’s house, and to walk “on the Appian Waywhere he walked.” To Douglass, surrounded and awed by all the splendor of Rome,the origin story he most sought was that of his hero Paul, “the first greatpreacher of Christianity.”17 [notes02.html#ch29fn_17a]Before leaving Rome for Naples, the Douglasses engaged in social visits with oldfriends, especially the African American sculptor Edmonia Lewis. The six-hourtrain ride to Naples offered glorious views of the “blue Mediterranean” and leftDouglass “breathless” at a clear sighting of Mount Vesuvius. He could hardlycontain himself in writing of a visit to the ruins of Pompeii, and to the Greektemple of Neptune at Paestum. But what especially impressed Douglass was “thelanding place of Paul.” He was well aware of Paul’s epistles, but now he couldsee a landscape from which they emerged. In southern Italy, what interested himmost, wrote Douglass, “was the fact that I was looking upon the country seeneighteen hundred years ago by the Prisoner apostle on his way to Rome to answerfor his religion. It somehow gave me a more vivid impression of the heroism ofthe man as I looked upon the grand ruins of the religion against which Pauldared to preach.” Arrested by the Romans in Jerusalem, Paul journeyed to Romewhere he spent two years in house arrest, living with a chain. Douglass felt anaffinity with Paul, perhaps seeing his own enslavement of twenty years in Paul’sstory of arrest and persecution.18 [notes02.html#ch29fn_18a]In Naples, Douglass lectured on the martyrdom of John Brown at the UnitedPresbyterian Church. Sometime in February the Douglasses decided to extend theirtour to Egypt and Greece. In the diary, Douglass declared his anticipation ofseeing the “land of Joseph and his brethren, and from which Moses led thechildren of Abraham out of the house of bondage.” Frederick marveled at his ownfate, “born as I was a slave marked for a life under the lash in a corn field,”and now to be “plowing this classic sea and on my way to the land of Moses andthe Pharaohs.” Aboard the steamer while passing Crete, Douglass again rememberedthe prisoner apostle: “I suppose there was no light there when Paul sailed alongits coast.”19 [notes02.html#ch29fn_19a] The old orator may have envisionedhimself the exiled prophet, this time as a world tourist.On February 16 the Douglasses arrived at Port Said, the entrance to the SuezCanal. Going ashore at Ismailia, they took a train to Cairo. Douglass now hadyet a new encounter with religion. He was at first much taken with Islam. Hecommended the Muslim faith because it did “not make color the criterion offellowship,” and he liked the mosques because they displayed no “images orpictures of saints or God.” But the Egyptian crowds in the streets and bazaarswore on him. The bulk of the people were desperately poor, and the “most painfulfeature” of life was the “veiled women” and the “men who own them as slaves.”20[notes02.html#ch29fn_20a] Douglass spared few elements of Egyptian culture fromjudgment even as he felt enthralled by it.On February 22, Douglass climbed the Great Pyramid of Cheops at Giza. For thesixty-nine-year-old the effort was all but overwhelming. He and Helen had theirphotograph taken at its base. The more than four-hundred-foot “ascent is bothdifficult and dangerous,” the diarist recorded, “and I would not undertake itagain for any consideration.” After resting for a day or so to write letters,the Douglasses visited a Coptic Christian church and a Jewish synagogue inCairo. Most strikingly, they also witnessed a group he called “HowlingDervishes,” who reminded him of a Methodist camp meeting. He scolded themystics. This rationalist student of the King James language could not resistrejecting so much of the religiosity he encountered in foreign lands. After amorning visit to an Islamic college, the best he could say about the devotion hewitnessed among the students reading the Koran was that “if sincerity is anyproof of the truth of their creed, they certainly give that proof—but alas!Sincerity is no proof.” Douglass did admit to real enjoyment on a six-miledonkey ride among throngs of Egyptians, and especially on a five-day trip up theNile River.21 [notes02.html#ch29fn_21a]By mid-March the Douglasses took passage on a steamer to Athens. When Douglassfirst saw the Acropolis and the Parthenon, he could hardly contain his romanticjoy. They were “so beautiful in their ruin.” He was utterly enchanted by the“power of the ancient people of this famous city.” Just before departing Athens,Douglass went back up to the Acropolis, ascended a nearby hill known asAreopagus, and either read or listened to a reading of “Paul’s famous address tothe Athenians 18 hundred years ago.” According to Acts 17:19, Paul had addressedan assemblage of Greek philosophers from that very hill, challenging what heconsidered their idolatry, and preaching about Jesus and the resurrection. Itwas also in that address that Paul declared all peoples the “offspring” of Godand spoke the famous passage used over the ages by advocates of human unity: God“hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of theearth.”22 [notes02.html#ch29fn_22a] It is fascinating that Douglass the tourist,the old abolitionist, chose to remember these biblical texts on his final dayamid the temples of the Greek gods. Released from the ever-grinding Americanobsessions with race, the former slave sought ways in his imagination, and inreturning to Paul’s heroism, to recollect his own quest for self-creation anduniversal recognition. Douglass never sought to be a martyr, although he spent alifetime admiring them.Image [../images/f0674-01.jpg]The Acropolis as seen from the Areopagus Rock. Douglass went up to Areopagus toread Saint Paul’s letter to the Athenians and commemorate the apostle’s speechto the Greek skeptics.By April the Douglasses sailed back to Italy. After a second stay in Rome, thecouple traveled north in mid-May and stopped in Florence and Venice beforetraversing the Alps and returning to Paris. In Florence, Douglass located thegrave of the American abolitionist Theodore Parker and also inquired about andsearched unsuccessfully for the home of Ludmilla Assing, “the sister of myfriend of many years Miss Ottilie Assing.” In Venice, Douglass found himself intouch with favorite scenes in Shakespeare. He was thrilled to find the “housewhere Desdemona resided when wooed by Othello.” By early June, back in London,Douglass ceased writing in his leatherbound diary. On June 10, he wrote atelling letter to his old Rochester friend Amy Post in which he mused on old ageand travel: “When I consider my starting point in life, it is marvelous that Ihave accomplished so much, but I feel that it has all come too late in life. Ishould have traveled thus when I was younger, and when my ambition forachievement was more vigorous.”23 [notes02.html#ch29fn_23a] After a short visitback to Dublin, Ireland, the couple returned to America by early August; butambition was not yet played out for the weary traveler.Image [../images/f0675-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, Dublin, Ireland, at the end of the European tour with Helen,July 1887. Alice M. Shackelton photographer.Douglass’s return to America and to Washington was news; some of the press wasquite fascinated by the interracial couple’s long tour, and the Sage of CedarHill cultivated their interest. By late August, the celebrity would hold courtsome afternoons with reporters and talk at length about his European journey. Hetold the National Republican that everywhere he went he was treated withequality. He had encountered not a “single gesture” of disapproval about his“color or the kink in my hair.” Walking the grounds of Cedar Hill, Douglassentertained Washington Post writers with stories of Egypt. He assured them thatNegroes were not the descendants of pharaohs. Recollecting the climbing of thepyramid, he told of carrying his “seventy years and 230 pounds,” but joked thathe “had four Arabs to help me.” He also received a good deal of correspondencefrom friends and acquaintances who were reassured to have him back home, desiredfavors, or invited him to lecture. Soon, at Metropolitan AME Church andelsewhere, Douglass began to deliver formal speeches detailing his tour.24[notes02.html#ch29fn_24a]The first of these lectures occurred on September 22, at which the oratordwelled largely on the question of Irish home rule versus “coercion” fromEngland. He thought that the “spirit of the age” favored unification and largernationalities, reflecting no doubt his own American experience. But he sidednonetheless with Ireland’s independence as a matter of justice. At the end ofthe address, the host pastor, Theophilus Stewart, to loud applause, called for aRepublican ticket in 1888 of Robert Todd Lincoln for president and Douglass asvice president.25 [notes02.html#ch29fn_25a]In December, again at Metropolitan AME, Douglass delivered a more formal speechabout his European tour. This celebrity tourist had clearly taken to the idea oftravel as a philosophical as well as a narrative challenge. The whole speciesfollowed a kind of destiny. “Man is by nature,” said Douglass, “a migratoryanimal. It does not appear that he was intended to dwell in any one locality. Heis a born traveler.” Douglass even predicted air travel. “When lightning shalltake the place of steam, he imagined, as it will do, just as steam has taken theplace of wind, when men shall navigate the air just as freely as they nownavigate the sea, travel will cease to be the exclusive privilege and luxury ofthe few and the wealthy.”26 [notes02.html#ch29fn_26a] But Douglass had nowbecome one of the privileged.On this December night Douglass talked into late hours and only got through thetour of England and to Paris. A text survives of an even longer address he wrotecarrying the story all the way to Egypt and Greece. These public lectures werelaced with more hostile reactions to the “religious shows” of Rome andelsewhere, but also wonderful anecdotes. Douglass remembered going in Paris tothe Bibliothèque Nationale, “the largest library in the world,” where he took aseat in the vast reading room and quietly inquired whether they might have anyof his writings. In only minutes a librarian appeared at his desk with a copy ofMy Bondage and My Freedom, as well as a copy of a public letter Douglass hadpublished in 1846.27 [notes02.html#ch29fn_27a] The unschooled author was clearlymoved; he had just done what most writers do in seeking a kind of immortality inthe stacks of libraries.Douglass maintained that his object in Egypt was ethnological research. He saidhe had intended to test the theory whether the darker races had indeed achievedthe highest of civilization in ancient times. Were the people who built thepyramids black or white? he had asked. Among modern Egyptians answering thisquestion, Douglass found only ambiguity about race. But he felt quite certainthat he had transcendently experienced some of the lands of the Old Testamentand its greatest stories. He felt an “infinite presence” of religious ideas fromthe deserts and mountaintops. “Moses learned more of the laws of God in themountains than down among the people.” The “Hebrew prophets,” Douglass mused,“frequented dens and caves and desert places.” His lifetime of reading andexpropriating biblical narratives no longer solely occurred on an imaginedphysical landscape. His greatest “thrill of satisfaction” from visiting Egyptcame when “viewing the scenes of one of the most affecting stories everwritten—the story of Jacob.”28 [notes02.html#ch29fn_28a]Douglass knew his Genesis, and he felt in its presence. Joseph, one of the sonsof Jacob, who was himself a son of the patriarch, Abraham, was sold into slaveryin Egypt by his own brothers. They then lied to their father, saying Joseph wasdead. But Joseph had special powers to interpret dreams, and while imprisoned,he interpreted one of Pharaoh’s nightmares. Joseph was freed and made, ineffect, the second most powerful man in Egypt. Then a terrible famine ravagedall the lands surrounding Egypt, which became the only place left producingcorn. Jacob and his many sons came down to Egypt from Canaan for survival, andJoseph arranged an audience for his father with Pharaoh. As a result, theseearliest Israelites (Jacob’s other name was Israel) were allowed to settle inthe fertile land of Goshen. Joseph, the formerly enslaved and betrayed one, nowredeemed and provided bread for his father, for all his brothers, and for thepeople of Egypt.29 [notes02.html#ch29fn_29a] Thus all the descendants of Jacob’stwelve sons were the founding Israelites who were eventually brutally enslaved,necessitating the ultimate “Exodus.”Here were the origins of the essential biblical story Douglass had adapted tohimself, to his people, and to America itself for most of his life. It is a taleof “how the slave boy Joseph gained favor in the eyes of Pharaoh,” saidDouglass, and prophetically saved the people and the land. It is to theJudeo-Christian world the oldest story of betrayal, suffering, famine, andinternecine family warfare, but then also of forgiveness, generosity,liberation, and redemption. It is the story of a people destined fordestruction, yet who are ultimately renewed and reborn. “Than this simple talenothing has been written,” Douglass declared in his public addresses, “nothingcan be found in modern literature more pathetic and touching.” He marveled thathe had set foot “here in the land of Goshen, with fields yet green, its camelsstill grazing and its corn still growing as when Jacob and his sons with theirflocks and herds were settled here three thousand years ago.”30[notes02.html#ch29fn_30a] To the extent Douglass had seen himself over the yearsas the slave boy who would confront and tell tales to American pharaohs, thenbecome the shepherd-prophet, he had stood on the soil that gave that idea birth.He had seen the landscape that had given the world the Exodus story. He had seenthe ancient roots of his own story. He could feel some mystical sense of beingan American Joseph.During these first months back in Washington after the foreign tour, and beneaththese high moments of public storytelling, tragedy struck Douglass’s extendedfamily again. During a two-week period in November, five more of Douglass’sgrandchildren died, all apparently in a typhoid-fever epidemic. On November 2,Charles Frederick Douglass, oldest son of Charles and Libbie, died at twenty-oneyears old. The next day, Julia Ada Douglass, daughter of Charles, died at agefourteen. By the middle of the month, Charles and Libbie lost two more children,Edward and Anne Elizabeth. And on November 14, Gertrude Pearl Douglass, daughterof Frederick Jr. and his wife, Virginia, died at only four years old. Thismarked the deaths of six grandchildren over just a year and a half. All weregiven funerals from Cedar Hill and buried in Graceland Cemetery.31[notes02.html#ch29fn_31a]In large families death could seem omnipresent in the nineteenth century. Duringhis lifetime, Douglass saw ten of his grandchildren die of disease. ForFrederick Jr. and Charles, these personal losses were devastating. By latesummer of 1887 Frederick Jr. had lost his job at the Recorder’s Office and wastaking loans from his father and his brothers. His financial story was nearly astragic as his family’s loss by death. In December 1890, Frederick Jr.’s wife,Virginia Hewlett Douglass, died at age forty-one of what obituaries called“consumption.” At her death, Virginia’s brother, Emanuel Molyneaux Hewlett, tookcustody of the couple’s two remaining children, Charles Paul and Robert SmallsDouglass.32 [notes02.html#ch29fn_32a] How Douglass himself coped with all thesepersonal losses that autumn, or during the final two decades of his life, he didnot tell us. Having Helen always at his side had to be crucial and bracing,however tepid her relationships with the adult Douglass children. These familytragedies may partly explain why the old orator took so assiduously to thelecture circuit and to the political stump.• • •In 1888, in a new political season, Douglass, the traveling man, soon reenteredthe fray, in the press and on the road. Before their father arrived back inWashington in 1887, Lewis and Frederick Douglass Jr. both took to publicplatforms to condemn blacks who would change parties and support Democrats. ByOctober and November, the elder Douglass resumed bitter press exchanges with hiscritics, especially those who advocated that blacks divide their loyaltiesbetween the two political parties for leverage. To Douglass this scheme was“absurd,” even “madness.” He engaged in a particularly nasty exchange throughoutNovember in the New York Age with T. McCants Stewart, an AME minister andlawyer, thirty-five years younger than Douglass, who had spent two yearsteaching in Liberia, and who advocated that the race consider joining theDemocrats. Douglass would have none of it: “It is far better that all ourventures should be in a sound ship than to have any part of them in a ship thatis unseaworthy.” Even more directly, he pulled out the old bloody shirts. “Ifind that every shotgun aimed at the breast of a Negro at the South today isleveled by the hand of a Democrat; that every Negro strung up at the crossroadswithout judge or jury is so strung up by a Democratic mob; that every effort todefeat and annul the 14th and 15th Amendments . . . is made by Democrats.”Douglass even wrote bloody-shirt letters to Republican state leaders in NewYork.33 [notes02.html#ch29fn_33a]On February 28, 1888, at Metropolitan AME in Washington, which became a kind ofhome church and public pulpit for Douglass, a huge gathering, including somecongressmen, celebrated what they assumed was the famous man’s seventy-firstbirthday. The guest of honor embraced the occasion, although in his speech hereminded the audience that he “had never had a birthday.” Douglass toldlisteners, “We [slaves] were born at times—harvest times, watermelon times, andgenerally hard times.” For Douglass, the occasion was about the power of thepast, a chance to embrace living memory, and to make slavery that story neverforgotten for the many children attending. “They used to tell me up in NewEngland not to refer to the stripes on my back. But when I remembered that sucha great man as Paul had told of the stripes he had received, I thought whyshould a little fellow like me be ashamed to acknowledge that I had beenflogged.” In this shared sense of suffering lay Douglass’s personal affinitywith the Prisoner Apostle. Douglass insisted on remembrance before any action:“Perhaps there is too much past. But remember that all the present rests on allthe past. Remember is as good a word as forget.”34 [notes02.html#ch29fn_34a]The next day he hit the rails for a speaking tour of South Carolina and Georgia.In the late 1880s a journey into the Deep South for such a conspicuous AfricanAmerican man was not without danger. Douglass went to lecture, but also to seefirsthand the conditions of the freedpeople after almost a quarter century offreedom and its denial.In the cradle of the Confederacy, Charleston, the storied city of secession andthe entrepôt of so many African Americans and their ancestors as slaves into theUnited States, Douglass gave two lectures at the Mount Zion Church. Often calledthe daughter church of Mother Emanuel AME, Mount Zion was opened for worship in1883; its first minister, the Reverend Norman B. Sterrett, was a former Unionsoldier. Douglass delivered versions of “Self-Made Men” and of the “EuropeanTravels” addresses. He was given a carriage ride around the old city ofCharleston, much of it still being rebuilt since the war, and was met by a blackmilitia unit calling itself the Douglass Light Infantry. Just what Douglassthought of the charms and haunts of Charleston he did not tell us. One pressreport indicated that the large audience may have wanted to hear more from thegreat orator on the racial conditions in the South than about his pursuit of theracial character of Egyptians. Douglass found that the Egyptian “if . . . not anegro . . . could pass for one in the United States. He was of a color betweenthat of a new saddle and that of an old one. He was of a mixed race, very muchlike some seen all around us.”35 [notes02.html#ch29fn_35a]Douglass moved on to speak to large black audiences in Augusta, Georgia, where alocal, embittered Lost Cause advocate lampooned him. “When it comes to degradingand debasing myself at the feet of a thick-lipped nigger demagogue,” wrote“Indes,” “a sense of decency . . . compels me to say to the white people of thiscommunity, leave my part of the freedom of the city when the keys are handedover to the Hon. Fred Douglass.” Here was the irreconcilable divide in the Southsince the war, embodied in the presence of the country’s most famous black man.Douglass was no mere carpetbagger; he was to the local Augustan the “politicalfirebrand” thrown “into our midst.” As in the old abolitionist tours of the1840s in the North, Douglass relished this role of the hated outsider speakingtruth to power, as long as he was not killed in the effort; that year anestimated 137 lynchings occurred across the country, most in the Deep South.36[notes02.html#ch29fn_36a]Among the places Douglass spoke in Augusta was the Ware high school for blacks;the setting was decked out in flowers and a big sign in golden letters: WELCOME.Beneath on an easel were pictures of Ulysses Grant, Abraham Lincoln, BlancheBruce, and Douglass. A program with students reading excerpts from Life andTimes, according to local press, left the guest of honor conspicuously listeningas “tears glistened in his eyes.” Douglass traveled back into South Carolina,lecturing in Orangeburg, where he was verbally attacked for discussing equalityof the races. He returned northward by mid-March, full of impressions of theSouth, which he soon examined in public speeches. En route, he was Jim-Crowed inWeldon, North Carolina, as the train stopped and he was not allowed to eat in alocal restaurant.37 [notes02.html#ch29fn_37a]In Washington, on April 16, the annual anniversary celebration of DCemancipation once again occurred amid controversy. Whether to have raucousparades and just where black political allegiances best lay led to two separatekeynote addresses, one by Douglass at the Fourth Baptist Church, and one by hisrival John Mercer Langston at the Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church. Douglassrode in a carriage at the front of a long procession of militia units, floats,and bands. In his speech, Douglass addressed the conditions and violence in thelives of the freedmen. What he’d learned in South Carolina and Georgia was “notfavorable to my hopes for the race.” He acknowledged that anniversaries areoften devoted to “prophecy” of “smooth things,” the “joyful and glad.” But onthis occasion he told a dark story, whether people found it tasteful or not.“There are times when neither hope nor fear should be allowed to control ourspeech,” he declared, and sought tone and justification in Isaiah: “Cry aloudand spare not.”38 [notes02.html#ch29fn_38a]Douglass was back to playing his old antebellum role of the Jeremiah. Above all,his address in April 1888 was a diatribe against the Democratic Party as a newkind of Slave Power conspiracy intending to seize “the powers of the federalgovernment” to sustain white supremacy and crush the liberties of blacks. Heportrayed the nation’s condition as a struggle over memory. “Well may it be saidthat Americans have no memories. We look over the House of Representatives andsee the solid South enthroned there. We listen with calmness to eulogies . . .of traitors, and forget Andersonville. We look over the Senate and see thesenator from South Carolina, and we forget Hamburg” (a massacre of blacks in1876). African Americans, Douglass maintained, had a special responsibility tomake the nation remember the deepest meanings of the Civil War and emancipation.“Well the nation may forget; it may shut its eyes to the past, but the coloredpeople of this country are bound to keep fresh a memory of the past till justiceshall be done them in the present.”39 [notes02.html#ch29fn_39a] Howeverdifficult, Douglass asked his people to shoulder this long-term burden.The victim of a “cunningly devised swindle” (the sharecropping system), the“plantation negro” in the South was worse off than when a slave, Douglassmaintained. Freedmen farmers were in the orator’s view systematically cheatedout of fair wages and of land. They were “like a man in a morass, the more hestruggles the deeper he sinks.” This “Satanic arrangement,” as Douglass termedthe Southern agricultural system and its new labor relations, especially throughlandlord and tenant laws, had buried the freedmen in a dead end of debt andtenancy. Some in the press attacked Douglass for his harsh rhetoric in thisspeech. The Washington Bee thought the address a mere “scarecrow” to cover upmore positive realities. But other papers, such as the Boston Morning Journal,considered the speech a “staggering blow to the pleasing fiction of a newregenerated South.”40 [notes02.html#ch29fn_40a]To all those twenty-first-century Republicans, desperate to find AfricanAmerican heroes and adherents in their long-ago past, Douglass left thisstatement of his real views on the nature of government: “I know it is said thatthe general government is a government of limited powers. It was also once saidthat the national government could not coerce a state. . . . But whenever anadministration has had the will to do anything, it has generally foundconstitutional power to do it.” Douglass drew on sacred memory and experiencerooted in the federal power exercised to free the slaves in war and deliver themrights in a new Constitution. “If the general government had the power to makeblack men citizens,” he sternly declared, “it has the power to protect them inthat citizenship. If it had the right to make them voters it has the right toprotect them in the exercise of the elective franchise.” As Douglass condemnedDemocrats, he also challenged his own party to embody a “new departure” in whichit would remember its storied past and use federal power to stem the “bloodytide” in the South and to win new victories in 1888 at the ballot box. “Enoughof shaking hands over the bloody chasm,” Douglass shouted, “enough ofconciliation, enough of laudation of the bravery of our southern brethren.”There was no honor to be found among ex-Confederates. Douglass demanded ofRepublicans a politics of confrontation before it was too late.41[notes02.html#ch29fn_41a] The old lion had found a new roar and was ready totake it out on the stump.Douglass attended the Republican National Convention in Chicago in June, not asa delegate, but essentially as the celebrity symbol he had become for his party.Tall and conspicuous standing at the rear of the stage at the Chicago Armory onthe convention’s first day, he was, as usual, called on to speak by a swellingchorus from the thousands attending. “Douglass! Douglass!” the old familiarappeal rolled over the room. Douglass later admitted that he preferred SenatorJohn Sherman of Ohio as the presidential candidate, but acquiesced in thenomination of Benjamin Harrison of Indiana. With a reputation as a moderate,Harrison had nevertheless supported Radical Reconstruction. He had also risenfrom lieutenant to brigade commander in a distinguished record as a soldierduring the war. So the orator played off that story in his brief, one that heclaimed was not “to tickle men’s ears or to flatter party pride.” He appealed toRepublicans to act on their commitment to black rights and security because when“Abraham Lincoln called upon the Negro” in the crisis of war, he [the black man]reached “forth with his iron arm” and caught “with his steel fingers yourfaltering flag, and he came, he came full two hundred thousand strong.” Thepartisan throng loved it. Now those same men in the South were “compelled towade to the ballot box through blood.” In these images of flag, blood sacrifice,and military glory, Douglass demanded that his party live up to its historicpromises. As he ended, the crowd of delegates cheered wildly and shouted,“Douglass! Douglass!” So taken was the Chicago Tribune with Douglass’sappearance at the convention that it printed two drawings of him, one speakingand the other holding the gavel.42 [notes02.html#ch29fn_42a]By August, Douglass resumed his ugly rivalry with John Mercer Langston, who wasrunning for Congress from the heavily black Fourth District of Virginia.Douglass opposed Langston’s candidacy on the grounds that he was insufficientlyloyal to the Republican Party. The Sage of Cedar Hill exposed his insider statusin the party by sidestepping this historic chance to see a black congressmanfrom a state such as Virginia. Instead, he supported William Mahone, a formerConfederate, although much changed, and now the Republicans’ veritable partyboss. Mahone would not step aside, forcing Langston to run as an independent.Douglass’s public and personal disavowal of Langston brought a wave ofcriticism, even from old friends. T. Thomas Fortune in the New York Age accusedDouglass of a “vain sacrifice of race to the fetish of party and personalpique.” The Washington Bee claimed the dispute was pure “personal animosity” onDouglass’s part and that the old leader “dislikes to see others succeed.” It gotworse, with some papers calling on Mrs. Douglass to step in and bring the oldman to his senses. The family found itself dragged into the mud. Charles went tothe press with a public letter defending his father and attacking Langston, evenas Nathan Sprague condemned his father-in-law for not supporting the blackcandidate. Feuds occurred within feuds.43 [notes02.html#ch29fn_43a]Douglass wrote a long letter of defense that someone should have told him toscrap. It rather lamely made the old case for the Republican Party as the “sheetanchor” for black political hopes. He trotted out long quotations demonstratingthe white-supremacist desires of Democrats to eliminate blacks from Americanlife. He further claimed that Langston’s candidacy was staked solely on colorand not principle. Color, in this instance, Douglass argued, carried no “moralor political quality.” The solidity of the Republican Party was at stake. Heeven attacked Langston, who had served seven years as US minister to Haiti,personally for past political sins, especially his advocacy that blacks dividetheir votes between the parties. Langston lost a close election, but after atwo-year legal challenge to the fraud practiced by the Democrats in Virginia towin the election, he was seated by Congress in 1890 and served the last threemonths of the term. This entire affair embarrassed Douglass; a supreme irony ofsuch a bitter relationship is that the two men agreed on many crucial issuessuch as federal supervision of voting in the South, integrated education, andenforcement of civil rights based on the Fourteenth Amendment.44[notes02.html#ch29fn_44a] Douglass simply was not good at forgetting.In the fall campaign, reluctant as he was about Harrison, Douglass took thestump in at least five states: Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Michigan, andIndiana. There comes a time, he wrote in Life and Times, when in every election“the judgment of factions must yield to the judgment of the majority.” Howagonizingly he had learned this lesson over and again at least since 1856. In1888 the Democrats ran incumbent Grover Cleveland, this time on a platform offree trade and denunciation of the longtime protective-tariff policies of theRepublicans. Harrison and the Republicans tried to focus their campaign squarelyon the tariff; “protection” became all but a moral claim to saving Americanprofits and workers at the same time. Neither party much addressed the race andviolence question in the South. Douglass admitted that he felt almost too oldfor the daily speaking demands of an election tour. But he also stressed, as hedid in New Haven, Connecticut, in October, that he did not want the Republicaneffort “confined to a single issue, though that be a grand economicalquestion.”45 [notes02.html#ch29fn_45a]In his stump speeches for Harrison, Douglass made his halfhearted arguments forthe national tariff, but demanded more from the idea of protection. The parties,declared Douglass to a packed house in the Hyperion Theater, near YaleUniversity, represented two opposite ideas. Ideological political warfare hadformerly been a matter of “bullets” versus the “ballot.” But now the two greatideas were one “born of slavery, of class dominion,” and the other “born ofliberty, of the respectability of labor.” Democrats were afraid of the past,Douglass asserted; Republicans should embrace and use it. He offered a new partyslogan few if any adopted: “I am for protection because I am forcivilization.”46 [notes02.html#ch29fn_46a]In an extremely close election, Cleveland won the popular vote by about 100,000votes (5,540,309 to 5,439,853), but lost in the electoral college, 233–168.Harrison carried virtually all of New England, all of the Midwest, the GreatPlains, and the far-western states. Cleveland’s states, exclusively the “solidSouth,” were insufficient to win a general election at this point in the GildedAge. A Republican was going back to the White House with a geographicallyexpanded Yankee vote. In early January 1889, Douglass gave a newspaper interviewat Cedar Hill. When the journalist arrived, the host was practicing on hisviolin. The two had a wide-ranging conversation about the scale of suppressionof the black vote in the recent election, but also about Douglass’s excitementabout a Republican return to power. He expressed the sunny faith that now the“American people . . . are to have one country, one law, one liberty, and acommon destiny.” As the interview ended, Douglass took up his violin, sayinggood-bye by playing “The Star-Spangled Banner” for his guest.47[notes02.html#ch29fn_47a]As a surrogate who had labored hard for the Republican ticket, Douglass would begiven a significant reward by President Harrison, if he chose to take it. Butbefore that happened, in the winter and spring of 1889 Douglass made a secondspeaking tour of the Deep South.• • •On February 4, 1889, just as he arrived in Little Rock, Arkansas, Douglass senta postcard to Helen: “All right. I am among . . . friends. Shall speak heretomorrow eve. . . . Somewhat worn by two days and two nights travel.” After twoweeks of lectures in at least three Arkansas cities, and then several in Kansas,Douglass rode the cars back home to Washington.48 [notes02.html#ch29fn_48a] Hewas still making these trips and delivering “Self-Made Men” and other speechesfor money; people flocked to see Old Man Eloquent, especially in places where hehad never before appeared. Douglass was an icon of a kind in American civilreligion, both a ghostlike figure of the bygone era of slavery and the war, aswell as the living voice about the ever-dominant race question in the present.In the first week of April, Douglass took the trains south again. In March,newspapers reported that the traveling man had committed to be the guest ofhonor at the Jacksonville, Florida, “Sub-Tropical Exposition.” When his trainstopped in Savannah, Georgia, a crowd of blacks, led by a black militarycompany, gathered to see and greet the famous leader. “The train stayed onlyabout half an hour,” reported a local paper. But it was time enough for Old ManEloquent to come out and greet the gathering. He begged off from making aspeech, but reviewed the militia unit. The train rolled out of the depot amidloud cheering.49 [notes02.html#ch29fn_49a] Within a stone’s throw of one of thelargest cotton-trading centers in the South, and in a city with thousands ofblack freedmen struggling to survive and live meaningful lives amid hostilewhite supremacy festering around each of its beautiful squares, the locals hadonly glimpsed their mysterious hero.Douglass’s extraordinary arrival amid huge crowds in Jacksonville was news evenin the North. Excursion trains full of black folk from southern Georgia and allover northern and central Florida filled Jacksonville with an estimated twentythousand visitors. Two trains organized in Bainbridge, Georgia, charged $3 perperson for the two days’ journey. Some arrived by foot and some riding mules. Aprocession said to be over a mile long led Douglass, riding in a carriage, intothe exposition grounds. Perhaps no other such assemblage of black people hadever occurred so openly in the Deep South. The Florida Times Union calledDouglass “the most historic character” in the “checkered history” of blackAmericans. The white reporter was astonished at how “the colored people had theright of way” in the streets, dressed in all manner of gay clothing, and fillingthe thoroughfares as “a moving mass of picturesque humanity.” The journalistseemed both fearful and impressed with such “turbulent exuberance of a tropicalrace.” A band played at the station and at every stop Douglass made.50[notes02.html#ch29fn_50a]It was April; flowers were everywhere. Douglass’s reception was almost that of avisiting head of state. At the main exposition building, a double line of people“escorted him down a central aisle with the band blaring. He stepped up onto a“pedestal . . . richly decorated by magnolia leaves and choice flowers, thefloor being carpeted by cut flowers.” Douglass sat on a chair and received aline of local dignitaries who came to shake his hand. A line of“light-complexioned” teenage black girls, all dressed in white, also presentedthemselves, each representing one of the American states. After a couple hoursof rest for the orator of the day, the crowds gathered at a grandstand to hearthe “patriarch’s speech,” as the reporter called it. According to a young blackman who helped with the introduction of Douglass, the old orator had arrived inthe top rank of the American pantheon. “We have always learned in our schools,”said Joseph E. Lee, “that the one who gave liberty to our country was GeorgeWashington. The one who will always be known as the savior of his country isUlysses S. Grant. But we have one of our own race who . . . is as great as thegreatest—one who carved his way from darkness into light. This man is Hon.Frederick Douglass!”51 [notes02.html#ch29fn_51a]After more pomp and introductions, one by the distinguished AME bishop DanielAlexander Payne, Douglass finally took the lectern, smiling amid “deafeningapplause.” He used some of his old self-effacing jokes: he feared he could onlyoffer his “poor job-trot eloquence” compared to the good bishop’s. Douglass’saddress, only one among several he was asked to give at the exposition, was avintage combination of postemancipation hope and progress with jeremiadicwarnings about the fragile nature of black freedom. Sometimes speaking in aSouthern black dialect, he wrapped his message in occasional self-deprecatinghumor, as well as laughs gained at the expense of the old masters. Douglassstressed the “vast and wonderful change” since the 1860s. He marveled that hecould “live to see the day when I could with safety to my person, to my liberty,tread the soil of Florida, of South Carolina, of Georgia.” For so long the verynames of those states “sent a shudder through me.” But now, Douglass declaredvia Isaiah, “We see . . . a new heaven and a new earth.” Many whites were in theaudience that day as well, and the guest orator drew them in. “Even the oldmasters shall rejoice that they are liberated in our deliverance.”52[notes02.html#ch29fn_52a]But Douglass urged the freedmen and their sons and daughters to not overratetheir progress. He urged remembrance of the blood and terror in the crucible ofemancipation; they had not been “emancipated by moral convictions,” but “in thetempest and whirlwind of civil rebellion.” Then in a refrain, he argued thatblacks had not been freed so much as “turned loose to the open sky.” “Turnedloose!” Douglass roared to the rear of the huge crowd. But he left thiscelebratory crowd laughing. He told of how the old masters desperately neededtheir black laborers and begged them to come back after 1865. “They found theyhad sent away the hands and left the mouths; they had sent away the muscle andhad left the stomachs.” He chided any old slaveholders present about theirnaming habits for their slaves. “Come back, Pompey, and come back, Caesar!”Douglass shouted in mimicry of the former master class. How honored blacksshould have been, he said mockingly, that slaveholders “never called us by anyother than those great names of the Greeks.” He further ridiculed the old ideathat with freedom blacks would begin to die out as a race. “If slavery could notkill us, liberty will not,” he announced to great laughter and cheering.Douglass broke into dialect to proclaim how blacks and whites must learn to livewith one another. Speaking to whites, he said, “Bre’dren, I has been wid you,and is still wid you, and mean to be wid you to de end.” But as entertainer hewas not finished. To show how blacks should be “measured from the depths fromwhich we came,” Douglass gave the howling audience almost a piece of minstrelsy(at least as portrayed by a reporter). “Did you ever think of a man like myself,who has grown up to weigh 235 pounds, that I have had to fight with a dog namedNep under my master’s table for crumbs of bread? Well, I did. I had to skirmishwith old Nep for a share of the Johnny-cakes. I used to fight for them; and nowmy friends, see how fat I am!”53 [notes02.html#ch29fn_53a]The following day Douglass spoke again, this time a speech called “The Lessonsof the Hour,” in which he condemned all talk of a “Negro problem.” As he had sooften before, he declared such a problem the nation’s dilemma with racism andnot with his race. On that second day, Douglass met a seventy-nine-year-oldformer slave who approached him to say that they had been companions in bondagenear St. Michaels on the Eastern Shore. But the most remarkable member ofDouglass’s audiences in Jacksonville was the future poet, novelist, songwriter,and civil rights leader James Weldon Johnson. The seventeen-year-old native ofthe town, in his later autobiography, Along This Way, remembered seeing andhearing Douglass with great reverence. For a teenager who would later leave suchan enduring mark on African American letters and leadership, this encounter withthe great Douglass was transcendent.54 [notes02.html#ch29fn_54a]Johnson had not only heard a great deal about Douglass while growing up; as achild at the Stanton Grammar School he had won a book as a prize, The Life andTimes of Frederick Douglass. Johnson said he read the autobiography with“feverish intensity,” and that he looked forward to the former slave’s coming toJacksonville with “more than the glamorous curiosity with which” he had “lookedforward to the coming of General Grant.” He wanted to hear him speak and “catchhis words.” But, like all others, Johnson never forgot seeing Douglass. “No onecould ever forget the first sight of Frederick Douglass,” Johnson lyricallywrote. “A tall, straight, magnificent man with a lion-like head covered with aglistening white mane, who instantly called forth in one form or anotherNapoléon’s exclamation when he first saw Goethe, ‘Behold a man!’ ” Johnson’stribute left no doubt about a long-term inspiration that many in the Floridian’sgeneration felt for their intellectual ancestor. “As I watched and listened tohim,” Johnson said, “for a half century the unafraid champion of freedom andequality for his race, I was filled with a feeling of worshipful awe.” He didcatch some of Douglass’s memorable words. In particular he recalled the sage’sresponse to a question about his second marriage, a statement Johnson claimed noone in his own time of the 1930s would “dare to make.” He recollected Douglasssaying that in his first marriage he “paid . . . compliments” to his mother’srace, and in his second marriage to the race of his father. For the man whowould write the complex and haunting novel Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man,in which racial passing plays a powerful, ironic role, and who would work solong with the NAACP for a racially integrated vision of America, those words nodoubt had staying power.55 [notes02.html#ch29fn_55a]Image [../images/f0688-01.jpg]James Weldon Johnson, c. 1900. Grace Nail photographer.After the festival in Jacksonville, on his journey north, Douglass stopped tospeak to freedmen in Thomasville, Georgia. There, he again delivered sternadvice about self-reliance to an audience of freedmen and had some exchanges indialect. One black farmer kept interrupting the speaker with “Dat’s so!” Beforeleaving Thomasville, Douglass went to a local bank and had his host convert thehonorarium check from $150 down to $125 because the night’s proceeds did notcover the full fee. A local paper expressed astonishment at the famous man’sgenerosity. The wandering lecturer arrived back in Washington to deliver hisusual annual address on April 16, DC Emancipation Day. In that effort, fraughtwith controversy again and much attacked by some black papers, Douglass used hisrecent Southern tour to argue forcefully that blacks in the former Confederacywere in dire danger for their rights and their lives. He also sought to banishthe idea of a “negro problem.” To Douglass this question was always andeverywhere the “great national problem.”56 [notes02.html#ch29fn_56a]• • •Douglass could still command fees for lecturing and invitations poured in. Buthe was once again looking for a steady job. Back on March 7, between his twoSouthern tours, he wrote a carefully worded letter of application to the newlyinaugurated President Harrison, seeking his old office as recorder of deeds.That would not work out. But another, perhaps more glamorous and dramaticappointment, one he had already explored for some time, appeared on the foreignhorizon. Some in the black press attacked Douglass again as an office seeker outfor his own fame and fortune. By late June, Harrison named theseventy-one-year-old Douglass US minister to Haiti.57 [notes02.html#ch29fn_57a]Soon, he traveled on a steamer yet again on the deep blue sea, this time into adiplomatic quagmire."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 30--------------------------------------------------------------------------------HAITI: SERVANT BETWEEN TWO MASTERSA man must defend himself, if only to demonstrate his fitness to defend anythingelse.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1891Douglass had been part of numerous racial firsts in his life, but this was notone of them. The position as minister and consul general to Haiti had beentreated as a designated black assignment in the foreign service since the Grantadministration. Douglass’s old friend Ebenezer Bassett and Douglass’s archrivalJohn Mercer Langston had both served long terms in the post. Langston servedwith distinction from 1877 to 1885. Douglass and Bassett had first met in theyounger man’s hometown of New Haven, Connecticut, in 1855. Bassett had beenprimarily a career diplomat; his stint as US minister in Haiti (1869–77) endedless than successfully as he landed on the wrong side of a Haitian civilconflict. Bassett and Douglass communicated frequently in the months leading upto the old abolitionist’s appointment as minister. They had reconnected duringthe 1888 campaign as Douglass spoke in New Haven. The two men also shared familyconnections and memories; Bassett and his wife, Eliza, had named a son FrederickDouglass Bassett, who died in his youth in Port-au-Prince.1[notes02.html#ch30fn_1a] The Sage of Cedar Hill would have preferred to stayhome and resume his old job as recorder of deeds. But President Harrison and hissecretary of state, James G. Blaine, had other plans for the most famous blackRepublican.In 1889, Haiti was emerging from yet another civil war in its turbulent history;the appointment was therefore fraught with controversy over the character of USinterests in the Caribbean, and of particular concern to New York merchants withkeen eyes on Haiti’s resources and steamship lines. From the beginning of hisappointment to the Haiti position until well after it ended, Douglass served asa diplomatic spokesman (sometimes for both countries, explaining one to theother) as well as with ever-escalating self-justification. His Haitian sojourn,a difficult and exhausting interlude in an aging and unhealthy man’s life, wasanything but a diplomatic success; but it led Douglass to a new level ofinternational and Atlantic consciousness, and to some degree even racialconsciousness.2 [notes02.html#ch30fn_2a]• • •Douglass’s appointment as minister and consul general to Haiti in the summer of1889 received both rave and critical reviews in the press, initiating the rollercoaster of controversy to follow. The New York Tribune admired the appointment,although reminded readers that the “venerable” and yet “active and vigorous”Douglass was seventy-two years old. Initially the New York Herald thoughtDouglass’s appointment would bring “universal satisfaction” because of hisstature and because he was “above suspicion” regarding the influence of wealthyAmerican merchants. The New York Press believed Douglass, because of “racekinship” with the Haitians, would make a “permanent pacificator . . . of thatperturbed republic.” Many black papers celebrated this elevation once again for“the Lion of the Colored People.” The New York World overmatched all otherhyperbole, although possibly tongue in cheek: “The Haytians will doubtless quitfighting when they hear that Mr. Douglass is coming to live among them.”3[notes02.html#ch30fn_3a] Some of this rhetoric showed only how little mostAmericans knew about Haiti.Somewhat more informed, the Washington Post nevertheless belittled theappointment, suggesting that Douglass had favored coercion and annexation ofSanto Domingo when serving the 1871 commission under Grant. Douglass respondedwith a vigorous defense of himself and of Haiti. Harrison’s appointment likelywas not a “thoughtless reward” to a party loyalist, as a previous biographersuggested. But the new minister stood ready to protect his own honor as well asHaiti’s history. Like many other African American intellectuals of thenineteenth century, Douglass had long admired the transcendent Haitianrevolutionary leader Toussaint Louverture. Douglass and his sons had contributedto Toussaint’s mythic place among black Americans by purchasing hundreds ofpictures of the former slave general to use for publicity during the final twoyears (1873–74) of publication of the New National Era. By 1889, Douglassmaintained a significant distinction between “coercion” and “annexation”; therehad been a good argument (export of American abolitionist ideals to a desperateCaribbean country), he said, for annexing Santo Domingo without military forceduring Reconstruction. He especially claimed for Haiti an important place in the“future of the colored man on this continent.” He believed Haiti was unfairlymaligned as evidence that black people could not govern themselves. Haiti’srecurring revolutions represented “the process of evolution, not of decay orretrogression.” He urged Post readers to bury their racism and remember thatFrance had experienced twelve revolutions in a century, and that the UnitedStates had only recently risen from a “tempest and whirlwind” of civil war “aswild, persistent and turbulent” as anything Haiti had experienced.4[notes02.html#ch30fn_4a]Such bold words soon ran headlong into the silencing strictures of diplomaticoffice. But first Douglass had to endure the usual slamming from his blackenemies at the Washington Bee and the New York Sun. Harrison had rewarded OldMan Eloquent whether, according to the Sun, the “chronic officeholder” neededemployment or not. Worse, the Sun editor accused Douglass once again of nepotismin seeking federal appointments for his soon-to-be grandson-in-law, Charles S.Morris, who was still a college student. Annie Sprague, Rosetta’stwenty-four-year-old daughter, married Morris, who did not get a foreign-serviceposition and moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, to attend college. The ClevelandGazette wished that Douglass had stepped aside for the “more deserving, and moreintelligent young men of the race.” A younger Republican, the paper contended,was “not a blind follower of Fred. Douglass.”5 [notes02.html#ch30fn_5a] Thecritics were ever awaiting any misstep.By late August, with Douglass’s departure postponed because of the uncertainmilitary situation on the island, the New York Herald changed its tune and urgedthe US State Department to send a white man to such a sensitive post, since “ifthere is anything the average Haytian loathes it is a mulatto”; and worse,Douglass was a “pronounced mulatto” married to a white woman. By September andOctober, when Frederick and Helen did depart, the New York Times and the Heraldran stories with rumors that Douglass’s appointment was to be scuttled. Thesereports were likely the machinations of New York merchants who desired adifferent US envoy, one who might accommodate their interests. An elaborateceremony at Metropolitan AME Church in Washington at which Douglass waspresented with the departure gift of a special Bible likely assuaged some of thenegative press coverage. The pastor honored the new minister’s acceptance of theappointment in his “old age,” comparing him to Moses and Joshua, who were saidto be over eighty. After news that certain naval officers refused to sail withthe interracial couple on board, the Douglasses finally embarked forPort-au-Prince on October 12 aboard the famous Civil War battleship theKearsarge.6 [notes02.html#ch30fn_6a] The former slave from the Tuckahoe hadagain managed, through thick and thin, to climb another historical height. Hewould soon find out whether he wanted to be there at all.Image [../images/f0694-01.jpg]“Hon. Frederick Douglass Off for Hayti,” Indianapolis Freeman, October 5, 1889.Henry Jackson Lewis illustrator.Rumors flew that Douglass had been assigned to Haiti with instructions tonegotiate annexation of the country, and especially to secure a US naval stationat Môle Saint-Nicolas, with its splendid harbor on the island’s northwest coast.At least the second rumor was true, although it took time to evolve as adiplomatic strategy. Helen willingly accompanied her husband on this new journeyto the tropics, although their interracial marriage was not easy to negotiate inthe diplomatic social environment of Port-au-Prince. The flowers would bebeautiful, the climate rough.7 [notes02.html#ch30fn_7a]Joining Douglass also was Ebenezer Bassett, who had in professional desperationbegged the new minister to take him along as his personal secretary. Bassettspoke French, which Douglass did not, and the former minister had valuableknowledge of Haiti’s labyrinthine political landscape. “I know them [Haitians],”Bassett wrote to Douglass, “their language and their inspirations, just as youknow the people of the District of Columbia.” Douglass needed Bassett as well toprepare him for the apparent transition of power, after bloody insurrection andwar, from François Légitime’s regime to that of the new ruler, General FlorvilHyppolite. The situation was fluid and violent in Haiti; as Douglass’s departurewas officially delayed, he relied on Bassett’s experience and advice. On theidea of an American coaling station at Môle Saint-Nicolas, Bassett urged greatcaution. “Haytians generally are very sensitive to this matter of losing theirautonomy,” Bassett instructed in one of his letters, which he always labeled“Confidential.” “It is one subject in which they all agree.” The American schemeof gaining a naval station and greater commerce on Haitian soil would berelentless, Bassett warned. But he believed the two of them as a team could“face the music and . . . hold our own in the diplomatic dance around theHaytian plum when once we are on the scene.”8 [notes02.html#ch30fn_8a]• • •The scene in Port-au-Prince was hot, slow moving, and politically delicate. Uponhis arrival in Haiti on October 15 and for some weeks afterward, Douglass wroteto Secretary of State Blaine about the “order and tranquility” in the capital,about how Hyppolite had just been “unanimously elected” by the ConstituentAssembly and inaugurated amid “demonstrations of popular confidence.” EveryHaitian he met, said Douglass, had “had enough of war and is willing now toacquiesce in a condition of peace.” But he was anxious to get his letter ofcredence to present to the new president; otherwise, he seems to have felt likea diplomat without portfolio or a functioning legation.9[notes02.html#ch30fn_9a]With Bassett’s assistance and from his own reading and correspondence, Douglassslowly became aware of the deeper context for his immediate challenge. As ascholar of Haiti has suggested, Harrison’s appointment of Douglass had beencarefully managed to put a distinguished black American in the role ofnegotiating deals already long in the making. Harrison and especially Blainewere advocates of a foreign policy of Pan-Americanism, the idea ofever-expanding commercial networks of trade, supported by US naval power,throughout the Western Hemisphere. Rhetorically, as Blaine expressed it at aninternational conference in Washington in October 1889, just as Douglass arrivedin Haiti, such a policy was friendly and unthreatening. Blaine termed the policy“enlightened and enlarged intercourse of all.”10 [notes02.html#ch30fn_10a] Thisopen trade, though, and especially the American desire to enforce its controlover the Caribbean, required naval coaling stations. Neighborly and acquisitiveat the same time, such policies embodied the contradictions of an emergingempire.Hyppolite had overthrown Légitime’s regime and come to power in a militaryinsurgency supported in part by US weapons, including seventeen Gatling gunsprovided by an American merchant. A key figure in Hyppolite’s new regime wasAnténor Firmin, a lawyer and former schoolteacher from Le Cap in the north ofHaiti, an intellectual who had lived and studied in Paris as an expatriate andwritten an important work of anthropology, The Equality of the Human Races.Firmin became Hyppolite’s minister of foreign affairs and a key player for thenext year and a half of negotiations about the US desire to possess MôleSaint-Nicolas.11 [notes02.html#ch30fn_11a]After an awkward wait of some three weeks, Douglass finally got his audiencewith President Hyppolite on November 14. Douglass wrote officially to Blainethat as Douglass’s carriage approached the National Palace in Port-au-Prince,“long lines of soldiers . . . saluted” as he passed, their officers in“brilliant uniforms imparting to the scene quite a gay military aspect.” Insidethe grounds of the palace a band played “The Star-Spangled Banner” with “skilland effect.” Douglass met Hyppolite, surrounded by his cabinet and trustedgenerals. Firmin formally presented Douglass, who delivered a short address. Inhis description of the scene for his boss back in Washington, Douglass offered acharacter sketch of the new leader. Hyppolite, wrote the minister, was a man of“medium height, of dark brown complexion and gray hair. He has a well balancedhead, a clear steady eye, a calm temper and high intelligence.” He was“evidently a man not to be trifled with.”12 [notes02.html#ch30fn_12a] The writerin Douglass could not be completely contained within the formality of diplomaticprose.In his address Douglass said all the appropriate words about cordial relationsand historical friendship. Then he moved quickly to stress modernity. “Art,science, discovery and invention” had advanced with such speed as to “transcendour ability to keep pace.” “Steam, electricity, and enterprise” could now linkthe nations of the world in “universal brotherhood” and interdependence. Growingcommerce would mean the “enlargement of human sympathies.” Before closing,Douglass begged to speak a personal word about the symbolic meaning of hispresence: “Mine has been a long and eventful life, identified with themaintenance of principles illustrated in the example of Haiti.” The former slavefrom a backwater in a corner of the upper South did not have to put a name toslavery in front of men who had lived the history of Haiti. In his response,Hyppolite too pointed to a common fate for “all peoples of the civilized world.”But he also trained that steady eye on Douglass and reminded him, asrepresentative of the giant to the north that coveted coaling stations, that“every nation has therefore the right to be proud of its autonomy.” Hyppoliteended, however, by acknowledging that Douglass himself was the “incarnation ofthe idea which Haiti is following—the moral and intellectual development of menof the African race by personal effort and mental culture.”13[notes02.html#ch30fn_13a] For now, both men could walk away from this formalmeeting with pride.In the fall of 1889 the Douglasses looked with difficulty for suitable housingin Port-au-Prince. First they stayed in a hotel, then looked at various rentals,then took a temporary cottage up in the hills above the city. Eventually theysettled into the Lucie Villa, which pleased Helen because of its beautifulgardens. They stayed there until Douglass took a leave back in the United Statesbeginning in July 1890. In December, when they returned to Haiti after severalmonths, the Douglasses, with more local knowledge, found an even nicer residencecalled Tivoli. Helen again described with near rapture the beauty of the place:“Many and many a night Mr. Douglass would arise, & while others slept, standbeneath the open sky & commune with the stars.” Helen was more than equallyinspired by the natural surroundings. Eloquently she declared, “Here I learnedthe mystery of the dawn & saw the night flee away—Down the mountain it wouldcome audibly—the great banana leaves would begin to stir—& the air would befilled with the sense of life—and lo! Great diverging rays of rose & blue,perfect in their symmetry, would fill the east from horizon to zenith.”14[notes02.html#ch30fn_14a]The beauty of Haiti also inspired Frederick. He later characterized the islandas “wonderfully beautiful, grand and impressive. Clothed in its blue and balmyatmosphere it rises from the surrounding sea in surpassing splendor.” Douglassalso admired Haiti’s resources and therefore commercial potential. He thought ita land “of perpetual fertility. Its tropical heat and insular moisture keep itsvegetation fresh, green and vigorous all the year round. . . . Its mountains arestill covered with woods of great variety and of great value. Its climate . . .like that of California.” He thought the Bay of Port-au-Prince almost asbeautiful as the Bay of Naples, and Môle Saint-Nicolas the Gibraltar of theCaribbean.15 [notes02.html#ch30fn_15a] Inspired by this extraordinary beauty,Douglass nevertheless arose every day to face the complex issues ofword-twisting diplomacy.In Haiti, Douglass found himself snared in policies he half believed in butcould not fully embrace. He tried to imagine American expansion as humane andultimately beneficial to Haitians. Especially on the issue of the coalingstation at Môle Saint-Nicolas, but also on the overall relationship of the twonations, Douglass aimed for what the historian of Haiti Laurent Dubois called“happy globalization.” The benevolent, emerging naval giant, presumably stilladvancing its egalitarian transformations from the Civil War and Reconstruction,would gain its exclusive port in one of Haiti’s best harbors; the latest regimein Port-au-Prince would gain stability, prestige, protection, and especiallygrowing commercial ties for its lucrative coffee, sugarcane, and logwoodproducts. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, such anapproach to foreign affairs became known as soft power, the use of persuasion,not coercion, negotiations and not military action, in the conduct of relationsbetween nations. An early if unwitting visionary of “soft power,” Douglass hopedthat words would win over warships.16 [notes02.html#ch30fn_16a]In Anténor Firmin, the Haitian foreign minister, Douglass almost had alike-minded partner in this dual quest. But by December 1889, Firmin asked himto explain why an American warship, Yantic, ostensibly doing scientific work forthe laying of a French cable between Haiti and Cuba, was so visible a presenceat Môle Saint-Nicolas. The US minister conducted a good deal of correspondence,some of it awkward, with both Firmin and the captain of the Yantic, Commander C.H. Rockwell. On December 9, Douglass wrote to Blaine with what was, indiplomatic speak, a firm warning. Since so many articles had appeared in theAmerican press, Douglass argued, “relative to an alleged purpose of the UnitedStates to gain some sort of foothold at the Môle, and in view also of whatappears to me to be an extreme sensitiveness of the Haitian people generally onthe subject of any possible alienation of their territory, it is but naturalthat the presence of the ‘Yantic’ and our naval officers at the Môle shouldoccasion some comment in Haitian circles.” Douglass even suggested that thisissue could endanger the stability of the Hyppolite government; opponentsalready accused the president of a plan to “sell the country to theAmericans.”17 [notes02.html#ch30fn_17a] Here began a year and a half ofengagement with the central policy contention between the United States andHaiti. For now, the minister did his duty, and he and Helen enjoyed life amongthe diplomatic corps in Port-au-Prince.On New Year’s Eve 1889, the Douglasses attended a gala event at the NationalPalace; so did some well-dressed American naval officers, led by Rear AdmiralBancroft Gherardi, now Blaine’s primary emissary, and soon the US minister’sinternal adversary in conducting diplomacy in Port-au-Prince. Admiral Gherardi,a Civil War veteran of the Battle of Mobile Bay, had been commissioned by theNavy and State Departments to conduct a thorough study of all possible coalingstations in the West Indies. But during these winter months, financial matterspreoccupied Douglass—the condition of the Haitian currency, rumors that Europeanpowers would be sending naval expeditions to Haiti to collect debts, andespecially a debt of $60,000, dating from 1887, owed to an American citizen,Charles Adrian Van Bokkelen. Under Firmin’s pleading, Douglass requested a delayby Blaine and the State Department; by summer 1890 Douglass successfullyarranged for payment on installments over six years.18 [notes02.html#ch30fn_18a]These kinds of matters seemed at times to consume Douglass, who was no noviceabout money and persuasion. He frequently referred in his official letters toWashington to the interests of the “merchants and capitalists” on both sides.But he also reported often on the problems of social order and violence inHaiti. On January 17, 1890, Douglass described the Haitian legislative electionsunder way as “extremely cumbersome and complicated,” with voting conducted overfifteen days. He acknowledged “considerable disorder and violence in somequarters, but not more than occur in some parts of our own country atelections.” He was looking for silver linings in an election process wherewhatever party was in power, he admitted, was accused of “improper and undueinfluences.” The presence of soldiers had intimidated some voters, herecognized. But trying to find a diplomatic middle ground, he declared theelection “in the main . . . fair.” In February, however, he reported violentunrest simmering in Port-au-Prince. A “possible danger to public peace” and toHyppolite’s government seemed a daily threat. At this very time, AdmiralGherardi produced his report about the strategic value of Haiti to the UnitedStates because of the “millions which American citizens are investing in theNicaragua Canal,” and “our fixed determination to allow no one to gain afoothold” on the island. Bassett had warned Douglass of the American desire tobuild a “white man’s canal” across the isthmus of Central America.19[notes02.html#ch30fn_19a] Just how to represent that “fixed determination” ofAmerican expansion became the central challenge of the rest of Douglass’s tenurein Haiti.In late January 1890, Douglass made an official two-week visit to Santo Domingo,the capital of the Dominican Republic, to the east of Haiti. He went by seaaboard the US Navy ship Dolphin, to the Spanish-speaking city he had visitednearly twenty years earlier. But amid the tensions and adventures of hisminister’s duties, tragic news arrived from back home in Washington.Relentlessly, death continued to visit the extended Douglass family. TheDouglasses got the news before Christmas; Virginia Hewlett Douglass, for twentyyears the wife of Frederick Jr., died after an extended illness. In handwrittennotes preserved in scrapbooks Frederick Jr. recorded that his wife was “takenwith hemorrhage” on October 18. At Virginia’s death their four-year-old son,Robert Smalls Douglass, was sent to live with Hattie Sprague (where he remainedfor more than a year and a half), the twenty-three-year-old second daughter ofRosetta. Four of Frederick Jr.’s six children had already died young; he was nowonce again in dire straits as well as mourning for his forty-one-year-old wife.In that same December he ceased keeping his detailed personal account book. Thatfall Frederick Jr. had received yet three more loans totaling $130 from hisfather.20 [notes02.html#ch30fn_20a]Frederick, Jr., not in good health himself now at the age of forty-nine, seemedto process his confusion and grief in numbing, if settling, mathematical detailof his account books and in his notes about Virginia’s death. “We were married20 years, 6 months and 10 days,” he wrote in careful words on December 21, 1889.“She was 40 years, 6 months and 13 days old at the time of her death. She wasmarried 4 months and 10 days longer than she remained single.” In Port-au-Princethat winter, Douglass may have stopped counting these deaths in his family as hefelt the grief all over again for his son and his children. In less than threemonths came yet more bad news: Mary Louise Douglass, the sixteen-year-old onlysurviving daughter of Charles, died in early March. This made four of Charles’sfive children who had died in their youth. In a letter from Haiti, Douglasswrote to his son about death: “The blow is a sad one to us all, but we mustsuffer and be strong. I feel deeply for you because yours has been a most bitterexperience. Few families have been made to suffer as yours has in the loss ofdear ones but your experience should make you strong. You are still young . . .and have I hope much of life and usefulness before you. It is not for you todespair.”21 [notes02.html#ch30fn_21a]Charles had heard this form of fatherly advice and anguish before. Like hisbrother’s, Charles’s grief was compounded by his long-term indebtedness to hisfather. Just as Douglass received his appointment to go to Haiti, Charles hadwritten a deeply despondent letter to his father about being in arrears on hisrent in a house for which the elder had staked his son the money. Charles’s onlysurviving son, twenty-year-old Joseph, a skilled violinist, was in Bostonstudying music at costs Charles could no longer afford and for which he alsoreached to his father for help. For ten years, Charles lamented, he had “triedto make ends meet” and “pay everybody something.” He was once again without asteady job and hoped to find one through “connections to the Grand Army,” theUnion veterans’ organization. “I shall pay you father, and it is not fromdishonesty that I am behind.”22 [notes02.html#ch30fn_22a] The great voice ofemancipationist Civil War memory, and of Union veterans’ respect, must at timeshave felt anguish at the chasm between this national cause and the plight of hisown sons. Only Lewis, who had no children due to his war wounds, seems to havedeveloped a genuinely independent life.• • •By June, to avoid the repressive tropical heat, Douglass requested a leave toreturn home for the duration of the summer. He was fully aware now that he wasat the center of an internal struggle in the Harrison administration, involvingnavy officers and merchants as well, over the American quest for foreignexpansion in an age of empire. He still believed, against the tide, that Haitiwas a place where those impulses could be tamed or restrained and made into aforce for freedom. Douglass sailed for home with Helen on July 20, 1890, withrumors already at large about his possible resignation from the position asminister.23 [notes02.html#ch30fn_23a]As he and Helen waited at the New York train station for their journey toWashington, a New York Tribune reporter cornered Douglass to query him about hisexperience in Haiti. The minister tried to decline political questions, butpressed by the reporter, he came to Haiti’s defense. The Hyppolite regime sat“as firmly seated as at any former time.” Douglass strongly cautioned againstthe assumption that Haiti was always on the verge of chaos and incapable ofself-government. “There is one thing in which the people of the United Statescould help the Haytians—by telling the truth about them, and not having themconstantly paraded before the world as ‘on the eve of revolution.’ ” Hedenounced the notion that he had been ostracized as a colored man inPort-au-Prince. Indiscreetly, Douglass warned of the impression in the islandnation that the “United States is very anxious to get possession of Haiti.” Heclaimed that “some of our papers” had created the impression, but he also knewthat acquiring at least the Môle Saint-Nicolas harbor was the intention at thehighest levels of American government and business.24 [notes02.html#ch30fn_24a]Douglass knew of what he spoke about American attitudes toward Haiti. He hadendured an ugly piece of doggerel about himself back in March by an unknown poetpublished in the New York Herald:Will you come back to us, Douglass, DouglassDouglass, Douglass, tender and true?Is it a hated isle of Hayti,Is it true they’ll have none of you . . . ?Can’t we get that Mole St. Nicolas, Douglass,Frederick Douglass, “tender and true?”As there are cannibals still in Hayti.Aren’t you afraid that they may eat you?“Tender” hearts have been known to beat wellUnder a sable skin, as a buff—Ministers have been known to eat well;Look out, Douglass, tender or tough?Far more respectful, the black paper New York Age sent a reporter to interviewDouglass immediately after his return to Cedar Hill. The Age called him the“venerable Moses of his race” and pointed to his concern about what Haiti mighthave done to his health. “Time is telling on me,” said the tired Douglass, onlyhours off the train, “and the ten months in Hayti have made my step less firm.”Again, he defended Haiti’s “eighty-seven years” of revolutionary heritage in aworld of hostility.25 [notes02.html#ch30fn_25a]Douglass’s leave of two months turned into four, in large part because of astruggle within the administration. Blaine, Secretary of the Navy and formerCivil War general Benjamin F. Tracy, and an American businessman with ravenousinterests in Haiti, William P. Clyde, all either opposed or were at leastsuspicious of Douglass’s return as minister. They did not trust the oldabolitionist’s dedication to expansion, especially the quest for MôleSaint-Nicolas. Still roiling among them was their desire for a white ambassadorfor their schemes. President Harrison seems to have played the key role in notonly sustaining Douglass, but in moderating the imperialism of his chief aidesand their clients. Harrison did, however, appoint Admiral Gherardi “to cooperateas special commissioner” with Douglass in the looming negotiations with theHaitian government, setting up an ultimately untenable arrangement. In thepresident’s official instructions to Gherardi, Harrison made it clear that hesought “to acquire a coaling station for the United States in West Indiawaters,” but that it should be accomplished by a lease rather than by seizure ofland. The idea of a lease on the Môle served as a vain American hope ofcircumventing Haitian sovereignty.26 [notes02.html#ch30fn_26a]Douglass had no intention of resigning his position during this leave period. Ata large gathering at the black Methodist camp Wayman’s Grove, outside Baltimore,he denounced those urging his resignation: “At them I fling the old adage: ‘Fewdie and none resign.’ . . . I am going back.” He and Helen returned to Haitiunder these diplomatic challenges on December 13, 1890; as they arrived in theharbor at Port-au-Prince, President Hyppolite sent two officers to meet them anddrive them in his personal carriage to their residence. Douglass reported “goodorder” in the capital and progress in conditions, especially the “erection ofnumerous buildings for stores and dwellings.” He also expressed great optimismabout the imminent completion of the telegraph cable from Môle Saint-Nicolas to“all the great centers of modern civilization.”27 [notes02.html#ch30fn_27a] Bothhe and Helen were glad to be back among the flowering winter hibiscus.But soon the coaling station negotiations began to run into trouble, despiteDouglass’s good relationship with Haitian foreign minister Firmin. On New Year’sDay 1891, Firmin paid a visit to Douglass’s home. The two had a frank exchange,with Firmin condemning a report in a New York paper claiming that Hyppolite hadmade a promise to allow the United States possession of Môle Saint-Nicolas.“With some feeling,” Douglass reported, Firmin denied any such promise. The USminister did his best to support his counterpart’s disdain for the scurrilousand jingoistic American press, something they shared. But he also told Firminthat his country was “very willing to acquire by any proper means, by lease,rent, purchase or any other way” the coveted coaling station. Douglass alsoreported, however, that he left this meeting “not sanguine of receiving anyimmediate encouragement” in negotiating for the Môle.28[notes02.html#ch30fn_28a] Admiral Gherardi was about to arrive and all butsubvert the minister’s best intentions. And Douglass had lost Firmin’s trust.Image [../images/f0703-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass at his desk in Port-au-Prince, as US minister to Haiti, c.1890.Among Douglass’s nemeses now in the troubled diplomatic relationship was WilliamClyde, the steamship line owner who tried to negotiate his own elaborate dealwith Hyppolite’s government, offering arms and ships for a monopoly on Haitiantrade. Clyde attacked Douglass as soft and an obstacle to enterprise. Themagnate pressed Douglass to help him seal the deal and get the Haitians to payhim for his “time and money” expended in establishing the trade line. But theminister, dropping any diplomatic pose, told the businessman no, while plunginga dagger into his integrity: “Then sir, as they will not allow you to put a hotpoker down their backs, you mean to make them pay you for heating it!” Douglasslater wrote that Clyde had viewed him as “more a Haitian than an American.”Douglass described himself as “both surprised . . . and amused” by Clyde’s greedand bad manners. Douglass admitted that he actually supported the idea of asteamship line, but had “nothing but disgust for the method by which this schemewas pressed upon Haiti.”29 [notes02.html#ch30fn_29a] Events and Douglass’s ownattempts to find middle paths to agreements that were out of reach painted himinto a corner.Admiral Gherardi’s warship, the Philadelphia, anchored in Port-au-Prince harboron January 25, 1891. The next day Douglass met with the admiral on board andread Blaine’s, and therefore President Harrison’s, instructions to seek andobtain the Môle as a coaling station. Douglass, Gherardi, and an interpreter metat the palace with Hyppolite and Firmin two days later. Since it had been madeclear to Douglass that Gherardi was to be his “superior” in this negotiation, heunfortunately let the admiral dominate the exchanges over the “lease.” Gherardisowed the seeds of ultimate failure by stressing the “promises” made byHyppolite’s original provisional government to pay back the United States insome way for the arms and assistance given it as he took over Haiti in 1889.Firmin respectfully disagreed that there were any such promises, although theHaitian foreign minister did acknowledge that the request for the coalingstation was “a simple application from one friendly power to another.”Unwittingly, Gherardi may have doomed his cause when he claimed to Firmin andHyppolite that “it was the destiny of the Môle to belong to the United States.No other power would be allowed to occupy it even though the Government of Haitishould cede it.” That word “destiny” surely clanged in the ears of the Haitiansas it was translated. The Americans left the meeting thinking they might have adeal.30 [notes02.html#ch30fn_30a]Any hope of the deal, however, collapsed within two months. A negotiation hadquickly become a demand by an admiral backed up by warships arriving in Haitianports. In later public writings Douglass distanced himself from Gherardi as healso condemned Clyde. Douglass felt trapped, or as he put it, “a servant betweentwo masters.” Negotiations faltered when Hyppolite left Port-au-Prince at theend of February for nearly two months to quell a rebellion in Jacmel in thesouth of the island. Moreover, in March some New York newspapers began to attackDouglass for the apparent failure of American interests in Haiti. “The remedy[for any further revolution],” said the New York Herald, “is clear. Let theUnited States send to Hayti a Minister of recognized force, ability, and aboveall, honesty. . . . He must be able to speak the French language. To gain anyinfluence in the island he must be white” because Haitians “look upon a coloredman as one of themselves, whereas they unwittingly recognize the superiority ofthe white race.” Douglass was caught in contradictions of his own making, aswell as in historical contexts over which he had little control. What he hadlearned, as he later wrote, was that Haitians would not tolerate “alienation ofa single rod of their territory to a foreign power.”31 [notes02.html#ch30fn_31a]He also knew he faced a growing cadre of enemies in the rear at home.By mid-April the US naval presence reached seven warships, which causedconsiderable alarm among Haitians. But the show of force did not work. Gherardifavored use of force to obtain the Môle. Douglass, however, broke with hisconegotiator. In a message to Blaine he denied “in terms as explicit as usagesof diplomatic correspondence will permit” that he in any way favored seizure, asGherardi had implied. By April 21, Douglass reported to the State Departmentthat “the presence in this harbor . . . of our war vessels . . . has created afeeling of apprehension, anxiety . . . beyond anything of the kind that I haveever before personally known to exist here.” Rumors of war and an Americanmilitary takeover flew around Haiti. On that same day Douglass, with Bassett ashis translator, and Gherardi met with Firmin to make one more official appealfor the lease of the Môle. Firmin’s written reply on the next day deftlycaptured the reality. The American request included a clause that, so long asthe United States remained the lessee of Môle Saint-Nicolas, Haiti could not“dispose of any port or harbor or other territory in its dominions, or grant anyspecial privileges or rights of use therein, to any other power, state, orgovernment.” This offending language, Firmin argued, was “an outrage on thenational sovereignty of the Republic, and a flagrant violation of Article I ofour Constitution; for in renouncing the right to dispose of its territory, itwould tacitly consent to the alienation of it.”32 [notes02.html#ch30fn_32a]Douglass thus saw to the crux of the failure. As he later wrote, the US demandto exclusive rights to Haitian ports was “a denial to all others of that whichwe claimed for ourselves.” He chastised his fellow American policymakers fortheir refusal to grasp Haitian history. Her fierce territorial sensitivitiesoriginated, he wrote, “very naturally, in the circumstance in which Haiti beganher national existence. . . . She, by her bravery and her blood, was free.” Withwarships in the harbor, the negotiation became impossible. “We appeared beforethe Haitians,” Douglass said later, when out of office, “and before the world,with the pen in one hand and the sword in the other.” In Haiti’s entire nationalhistory it had been menaced by imperial powers. Now the United States acted likeone of those powers. On April 23, Douglass sent a telegram to Blaine with thesimple statement “Hayti has declined lease of Mole.” Douglass made his case evenin formal dispatches to his boss in Washington. On May 3, he wrote to Blaineabout “passionate” Haitian press accounts calling for resistance to the presenceof US ships in the island’s harbors. He told Blaine and official Washington whatthey did not want to hear: the United States had bullied its way to thisdiplomatic debacle.33 [notes02.html#ch30fn_33a] Slowly but surely, Douglassbecame a defender of Haiti more than an advocate for his own country’s policy, acontradiction he could only sustain for a short while longer.• • •By May 1891, Frederick and Helen Douglass witnessed a bloody Haitian riot andrebellion against the Hyppolite regime. As early as May 7, Douglass warned theState Department of “signs of incipient revolution” and a conspiracy tooverthrow Hyppolite. On May 28, during the Feast of Corpus Christi, a majorCatholic holiday, as Haitians packed churches and President Hyppolite and hisministers attended a service in a cathedral, a band of some seventy armed rebelsstormed down from mountains above the city, attacked the jail, and released morethan a hundred prisoners. Then the rebels dashed to attack the arsenal, but wererepulsed. The initial uprising lasted just over a half hour, but “the whole citywas thrown into an uproar,” the minister reported to Washington.Like everyone else in Port-au-Prince, the Douglasses were initially terrified bythe violence. They dragged furniture to block their doors and heard “straybullets that were flying past.” Douglass described hearing a “sharp” streetfight and reported that Hyppolite himself took to the streets on horseback tolead the reprisals, ordering and participating in the killings. Bassett andDouglass did not find each other until evening at a hotel veranda, whereuponthey fled to safety after hearing the firing of a Gatling gun. The killings thatday by government troops were rather indiscriminate. Helen Douglass wrote, “Theair was rent by the wailings, from various cottages, of women bereft of thosethey loved.” In the wake of the uprising there were many accounts of summaryexecutions as well as of the torture and killing of prisoners in custody.34[notes02.html#ch30fn_34a] For a time the scent of gunpowder replaced thefragrance of Haitian flowers.Some have suggested that in his reporting on the violence Douglass demonstratedan undue coziness with Hyppolite’s regime, to which he needed a relationship,and that he was just too naïve about the prospects of a black-led government.Hyppolite’s “court,” as it was called in the American press, shimmered with thetrappings of pomp and circumstance that Douglass may have admired. When thepresident went into public for official matters, according to an engineer onGherardi’s ship, he surrounded himself with a detail of nearly thirty sharplyuniformed military aides. Douglass’s “failure,” as it became widely viewed, inleading the Môle Saint-Nicolas strategy in Haiti was not due merely to naïveté.It was rooted in fundamental contradictions that he both embraced and ultimatelyrejected. But it may also have been simply one episode among many in the UnitedStates’ approach to Haiti in the late nineteenth century. According to historianMichel-Rolph Trouillot, American foreign-policy leaders in Washington, and eventhe members of the black elite such as Douglass, never fully integratedthemselves into the social and cultural practices, including how colordetermined status, within the island nation. German and French merchants anddiplomats, Trouillot asserts, developed deeper personal and economic ties thanthe Americans by marrying Haitian women and engaging in the life of provincialtowns.35 [notes02.html#ch30fn_35a] The American racial symbolism Douglassrepresented was never the most significant element of such a relationship to theHaitians.Douglass often described just what he saw. In his long dispatches to Blaine, hecalled Hyppolite’s reactions to the attempted coup d’état “severe repressivemeasures.” Very much against the actions and positions of the Haitian regime, hemade a strong case for the principle of diplomatic asylum as the bloodshedresulted “in filling the legations and consulates with refugees.” By his count,twenty-one refugees sought safety at the US legation and in Douglass’s ownhouse. They embarked on a French steamer to safety in Kingston, Jamaica. Withoutequivocation, the minister offered an earnest American judgment about Haitianpolitical violence. “The real remedy will be found,” he wrote on June 17, “whenthis people shall have worked their way out of the habit of irregular andviolent changes of government, and shall come to a full respect for theindependence and impartiality of their courts of justice.”36[notes02.html#ch30fn_36a] Douglass criticized Haitian politics, all the whileperforming as a kind of protector of its history. This became a balancing act hecould not sustain.Increasingly the Douglasses were eager to leave Haiti. Douglass planned toresign his position, but on his own terms and by his own timing, not under theassault of American newspapers, many of which blamed him even for the Mayrebellion. As early as February 7, 1891, the Washington Bee claimed Douglass wasabout to resign under pressure. The minister had to remain largely mum aboutsuch matters publicly. But in letters to his sons he opened up with blunthonesty, providing templates for his more formal self-defenses written later. Hewas, as always, worried about the health and finances of the extended family. Ina late-February letter to Charles he expressed hope that Frederick Jr. was aboutto get work. He would not yet give the Bee’s editor the satisfaction ofDouglass’s leaving his post. “I shall take my own time for resigning,” wroteDouglass confidentially. “The aspirants for the place must wait a littlelonger.” In April, he told Charles at length about his deep consternation withGherardi and Clyde over the coaling station, the steamship line, and itsattendant bribes, with which he would not associate. He complained of the racismamong those who wished him out of their way. Somewhat petulantly, he alsomaintained he had been “selected to bear the blame” for failure of Americanpolicy.37 [notes02.html#ch30fn_37a]And in March to his oldest son, Lewis, Douglass especially wrote of familydistress. He was particularly anxious about “how Fredk made out in obtaining thesituation.” Douglass recounted how Helen was sick with rheumatic fever. His ownhealth too suffered in the Haitian climate. He felt weak, worn-out, and too farfrom home. Douglass probably already suffered symptoms of heart disease, whetherhe knew it or not. “My absence from home has been marked by so many changes,”wrote the patriarch, “and some of them so distressing that I feel quite easilyalarmed when I am told of ailments in our circle.” His first wife, most of hisold abolitionist friends, so many grandchildren, and one daughter-in-law hadalready died. More tragedies were yet to come. It was time once again to tryretirement if he could. On June 27, 1891, Frederick and Helen took the steamerPrince Willem III to New York. Three days later from Cedar Hill, Douglass wrotea brief, formal resignation letter to President Harrison.38[notes02.html#ch30fn_38a] Douglass’s Haitian sojourn was over, but not hisdefense of it nor his relationship to the island nation.• • •Upon his return to the United States and after his resignation, Douglass gavenumerous interviews. One of the longest was with an unidentified black reporterfor the New York World on July 12. The reporter arrived at Cedar Hill whileparts of Douglass’s family were playing croquet in the backyard. The two men saton a bench in the summer heat before the host took him indoors. In this andother interviews and essays, Douglass made a forceful self-defense of his workin Haiti, blaming the failure of the coaling station policy especially onGherardi and Clyde’s quest for money and monopoly. But he especiallycounterattacked against the New York press that had held him personallyresponsible. He portrayed himself as the victim of outrageous attacks full ofinnuendo. “There are certain convenient forms under which a thousand lies maylurk in safety,” he said, “such as ‘It is said,’ ‘It is rumored,’ ‘It isgenerally believed to be true,’ ‘It is an open secret.’ . . . They are allconvenient formulas under which to hide a slander.” Such language had been usedagainst him and against Haiti. He defended Hyppolite as perhaps “unwise,” butjustly protecting his regime from violent disorder. Douglass called it“nonsense” that he or Bassett might have done anything to prevent the rebellionand bloodshed on May 28. In a Washington Post interview Douglass argued that hehad worked assiduously to obtain Môle Saint-Nicolas, but that for “politicalreasons” Haitian leaders simply could not relinquish land or harbors to foreignpowers.39 [notes02.html#ch30fn_39a]His most forceful self-defense came in two remarkable articles in September andOctober in the North American Review. Freed from diplomatic restraint, Douglassfought back for his reputation especially against the “grosser errors” of whathe deemed a racist press and their commercial and political allies determined toblame him for the debacle of US policy in Haiti. He made no apologies fordefending himself, and at this stage of his life he was particularly sensitiveto preserving his historical legacy. He had a “duty” to respond forcefully, hesaid, because the “charges vitally affect one’s standing with the people and thegovernment of one’s country.”40 [notes02.html#ch30fn_40a]The two articles vented pent-up anger. “In such a case a man must defendhimself,” Douglass wrote, “if only to demonstrate his fitness to defend anythingelse.” The great autobiographer and symbol of his race had much at stake. He hadbeen accused of slothfulness, indifference, excessive sympathy for Haiti, allbut disloyalty to the United States, and a general incompetence that some paperswere all too willing to attribute to his race. The proud Douglass did as he hadalways done—he took to his pen and wrote a personal manifesto. He deliveredpoint-by-point rebuttals of specific charges about moments in the negotiations.But most important, he counterattacked about race. Too many reporters, safelybehind desks and the comfort of consensus white racial prejudice, openly statedthat “my failure is my color.” He had heard all of this a thousand times before,but the hyperpublic nature of this episode required the kind of irony andreversal at which Douglass excelled. Many in power in press and government“thought it monstrous to compel black Haiti to receive a minister as black asherself.” Racism “sets all logic at defiance,” Douglass wrote from experience.If the United States had sent a distinguished white diplomat, “would hisAmerican contempt for the colored race at home fit him to win the respect andgood-will of colored people abroad? Or would he play the hypocrite and pretendto love negroes in Haiti when he is known to hate negroes in the UnitedStates?”41 [notes02.html#ch30fn_41a] Douglass did not always paint whites withsuch a broad brush, but he did with fervor in this case.With a subtlety that hardly made his enemies blink, Douglass argued that as longas white supremacy lay at the root of American foreign affairs, the countrycould never achieve noble aims abroad. The racial assumption that a whiteminister could woo the Haitians flew in the face of “plain facts” (Gherardi andClyde had both spectacularly failed), but also showed only contempt for theHaitians. “Is the weakness of a nation a reason for robbing it?” Douglass asked.“Are we to wring from it by dread of our power what we cannot obtain by appealsto its justice and reason?”42 [notes02.html#ch30fn_42a] This was not the voiceof diplomatic dispatches nor of formal interviews. It was the old declarativeabolitionist fire; Douglass knew he was not living back in the land of theFourteenth Amendment anymore, and that he could not fully trust his own country.But the former diplomat also vehemently defended his support of expansion. Manyreporters attacking him “were in their petticoats,” he claimed, when headvocated the acquisition of Samaná Bay in Santo Domingo in the early 1870s. Hedelivered a firm statement of his own brand of idealistic imperialism. “Whileslavery existed, I was opposed to all schemes of the extension of American powerand influence. But since its abolition I have gone with him who goes farthestfor such extension.”43 [notes02.html#ch30fn_43a] He placed himself in the longtradition of faith that American foreign policy could represent the enlightenedvalues of the Civil War amendments, of the human-rights tradition, of respectfor equality before law. If Douglass’s approach to American foreign policy hadan ideological core, this was it. He understood realpolitik, but preferredenlightened self-interest and the export of antislavery values. He had made thecase to Firmin and the Haitians that an American presence at the Môle and as acommercial partner was in their best interests. This made him hardly the firstAmerican diplomat to fail at trying to advance a set of self-awarecontradictions in a volatile foreign land. He had willfully lived by thesecontradictions, and his ministry died by them as well. He was a servant servingat least two masters, each of them at war within himself.Douglass further came clean with his contempt for Gherardi, whom he accused ofall manner of racial slights as well as bungling behavior. “Acting like a goodsoldier,” as the admiral’s subordinate, Douglass admitted that he found hisposition in the negotiations “galling.” He reflected that he might have resignedout of “honor” in midwinter 1891, but that he “did not propose to be pushed outof office in this way.” Accused of too much “sympathy for Haiti,” he wrote, “Iam not ashamed of that charge.” But he steadfastly believed he did his“honorable duty” to his own country. A year later, when Douglass sat down toupdate Life and Times, bringing his story up-to-date with thirteen new chapters,three of them covered his experience in Haiti. He believed he could not improveon his two articles in the North American Review and reprinted them almostverbatim as chapters. The Haitian sojourn forms the ending of this final editionof Life and Times. In the book Douglass summed up his life as both “dark andstormy” and full of “sunshine and joy.” He made a painful list of the obstaclesovercome: “Servitude, persecution, false friends, desertion, and depreciationhave not robbed my life of happiness or made it a burden.” Haiti hangs uneasilyin the balance of that statement. The two most “crowning” honors, he concluded,were President Harrison’s appointment of him as minister to Haiti, and now justrecently an invitation from President Hyppolite to “represent Haiti among allthe civilized nations of the globe at the World’s Columbian Exposition” inChicago.44 [notes02.html#ch30fn_44a] Douglass lived by many of the best elementsof ambition and honor. Sometimes it brought out of him a nearly self-destructivehypersensitivity, and sometimes it prompted his best work.• • •In a newspaper interview in August 1891, Douglass was asked about his plans forthe future. He answered, “I have labored many years for the advancement of thecolored race and I shall again take up the work. I can talk and I can write. Ishall use both of these methods of usefulness until I am summoned hence.” Latethat summer and through the fall, he lectured many times in Washington andBaltimore, especially in black Methodist and Baptist churches. In anotherinterview in early September in Baltimore, Douglass remarked that at the age ofseventy-four he had a right to retire but was “unwilling to be an idler.” Hewould devote his remaining time to literary work, “preparing for publicationreminiscences . . . as a duty I owe to my children and grandchildren . . . thatI may leave it as a monumental record of my life.” Such familial motivationswere surely true, but the engine of autobiography, updating as well as nowdefending his famous story, had been the driving force of his literary life forfifty years. Douglass could no more stop crafting his life’s narrative than hecould cease being the sibylline black man of words. In a ceremonial address atthe Asbury Methodist Church in Washington on August 31, in honor of itsminister, the Reverend John W. E. Bowen, Douglass paid a tribute unmistakablyself-referential. He announced that he was himself not finished. “Great is thepower of human speech,” Douglass declared, “by it nations are enlightened andreformed; by it the cause of justice and liberty is defended.” Then he invokedhis favorite apostle. “The words of Paul still rock the world, though spoken twothousand years ago.” Addressing the Reverend Bowen, he pronounced, “Yourvocation is to speak the word; there is none higher.”45[notes02.html#ch30fn_45a] With pen and voice, echoing the final sentence of MyBondage and My Freedom, the aged reformer still sought to change the world.But the America of the 1890s was a wholly different world of troubles from the1850s. That fall and into the winter of 1892 Douglass wrote the more than onehundred new pages for Life and Times. He was painfully aware that his memoir nowlanded in a society riven by escalated and violent racial strife. Had thestories of emancipation and legal equality that he had narrated through his ownepic life been eclipsed or destroyed by a new white supremacy as potent asslavery ever was? Was the power of the word, the weapon of language, any longerenough to combat the growing horror of lynching? Could the Sage of Cedar Hillremain a relevant spokesman of his people as he defended himself? Were thespecter of Jim Crow laws just a new challenge, or a resounding defeat of therevolutions of 1863 and 1868?In February 1892, Douglass wrote to an old abolitionist friend, Marshall Pierce,about the struggles of old age, of losing their antislavery comrades who werelike “trees falling all round us.” He also reflected on the daunting task of thenew revision of Life and Times: “When I laid down my pen a dozen years ago Ithought . . . I had reached the end, not of life, but of autobiographicwriting. . . . I have always found it easier to speak than to write. These tenor twelve years have not been cheerful.” Those lines contain multitudes—thepassing of Anna, the death of grandchildren and of other kinfolk, the loss ofOttilie Assing, the social and familial turbulence over his marriage to HelenPitts, the many events in the nation’s retreat from Reconstruction, theambivalence of his place as insider functionary in official Washington. “Theyhave been years of reaction and darkness,” Douglass went on. “The air has beenfilled with reconciliations between those who fought for freedom and those whofought for slavery. We have been . . . morally obscuring the difference betweenright and wrong. The Ship of State has been swinging back to its ancientmoorings.” Here Douglass showed how his private and public rhetoric about memoryflowed into each other and informed his worldview. And he worried about hishealth and stamina to fight on: “Though my eyes are failing and my hand is notas nimble as it once was,” he concluded, “I hope to do some service in writing[of] this period.”46 [notes02.html#ch30fn_46a]With the kind of irony he had always thrived on, the nation of Haiti, as well asthe increasing atrocities committed by lynch mobs in America, which he wasforced to confront after touring the South, provided the elderly Douglass onelast opportunity to rock the world."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER 31--------------------------------------------------------------------------------IF AMERICAN CONSCIENCE WERE ONLY HALF-ALIVEWhen it is asked why we [blacks] are excluded from the World’s ColumbianExposition, the answer is Slavery.—FREDERICK DOUGLASS, 1893Writing in 1901, the great critic William Dean Howells compared FrederickDouglass and Booker T. Washington favorably as great, if different, black men oftheir times. Howells thought both men had exhibited “cool patience” for thechallenges of their respective eras, but that the “temper” of Washington’s mindwas conservative, while Douglass’s was “essentially militant.” Washington led by“mild might,” and Douglass was “a fighter.”1 [notes02.html#ch31fn_1a] Theseimages folded a great deal of historical complexity into typologies ofleadership. By 1892 the seventy-four-year-old Douglass and thethirty-six-year-old Washington were surely aware of each other. The twogenerational, transformative leaders were finally about to meet.The famous “normal school” at Tuskegee, Alabama, was already ten years old whenits founder came to Washington, DC, to speak in November of 1891. Because of illhealth Douglass sent Washington a note of regret that he could not attend. TheSage of Anacostia wished the young institution builder the best with “yourlecture and your vocation.”2 [notes02.html#ch31fn_2a] By the next spring,Douglass planned a lecture tour in Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama as the Wizardof Tuskegee worked to get Old Man Eloquent to give the commencement address athis institute.The two former slaves met in Washington on April 27, 1892, on one ofWashington’s many fund-raising and networking trips. Two days later on hisreturn to Tuskegee the principal wrote a black organizer in Montgomery, Alabama,informing him that a plan to have Douglass speak in that city the day before theschool’s commencement was not acceptable. Ever attentive to the reputation andthe funding of Tuskegee, Washington complained that arranging Douglass’s visitwas “a matter of business” with a “great amount of expense.” Washington furthergroused that he had “to pay a man to accompany him [Douglass] on this trip.” Theprincipal was frustrated but determined. “It has taken me nearly six months toarrange this trip and [I] have had to bring pressure to bear from a very largenumber of sources in order to get Mr. Douglass to come.” The famed abolitionistwas still getting $100 to $150 for his speeches in most venues plus his travelexpenses. Washington wrote to Douglass on April 29 to finalize the plan and makesure in no uncertain terms that the orator would not speak anywhere else inAlabama before the commencement.3 [notes02.html#ch31fn_3a]Washington wanted Douglass’s imprimatur at Tuskegee without any competingpublicity. The evolution of the old abolitionist’s visit to Tuskegeedemonstrates the wide difference between the leadership styles and purposes ofthe two leaders. Washington was ever the marketer of his institution, itssecurity and interests. Douglass was at this late stage in life the celebritycourted to appear and speak, sometimes through elaborate planning. Both menwould always be remembered as national black leaders, but in different nationsin different eras. Washington built the remarkable Tuskegee, the Negro BusinessLeague, and other institutions. Douglass was in some ways his own Tuskegee.• • •Douglass’s spring 1892 speaking tour began first with lectures in New York,Boston, and Asbury Park, New Jersey, in March. Then in May he took the trainsouth to Tennessee, where he spoke in Knoxville, Nashville, and Chattanooga, May18–21. On May 23 he spoke at a church in Atlanta as well as to the blackgraduates at the Atlanta University commencement. Three days later, and 130miles southwest by rail, he was in Tuskegee as Washington’s special guest. Ninemen and six women with an average age of twenty-one graduated that day. The menwent forth, according to a press report, into farming, sawmill work, carpentry,wheelwrighting, and printing, while the women had prepared for sewing, cooking,and housekeeping. As part of the day’s ceremonies, the cornerstone was laid fora new “Bible training school.” The scene, recorded another reporter, was “mostpicturesque,” with a crowd of at least five thousand people arriving “in wagons,in carts, in ox-teams, on horse-back, on mule-back, and on foot.” As the throngfilled the school grounds, Douglass delivered a version of the “Self-Made Men”speech. A journalist called the address “calm and dispassionate,” as Douglasspreached a customary cluster of “economy, thrift, and common sense.” Douglassonce again urged the larger white society to “let us alone, and give us a fairchance. But be sure you do give us a fair chance.” A stunning photographsurvives of the orator standing on a stage in the round, flanked by a tightlypacked audience, American flags aplenty throughout the pavilion.4[notes02.html#ch31fn_4a]Image [../images/f0716-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass in the pavilion at Tuskegee Institute, Tuskegee, Alabama,commencement day, May 26, 1892.Douglass had taken the decades-old “let alone” dictum and his doctrine ofself-reliance to the new mecca, Booker Washington’s industrial school in theheart of cotton-belt Alabama. Just what Douglass thought of this extraordinaryexperience at Tuskegee he did not publicly record. But thousands of Southernblacks in the heart of the old Confederacy had now seen and heard Douglass, theliving legend whose life and words had long provided a mythic backdrop to theshamanism of the Tuskegee founder.The next day the traveling orator was in Montgomery, Alabama, speaking to yetanother black audience. Then he boarded another train for the long ride backnorth to Rochester, where on Memorial Day, May 30, he joined President BenjaminHarrison to dedicate a Civil War Soldiers’ Monument in his old hometown. He andHarrison returned to Washington, DC, on an overnight train, where on the 31stDouglass gave an interview at Cedar Hill to an Indianapolis reporter about theimpending 1892 Republican National Convention. He fully supported Harrison forrenomination, stressing that this president had vigorously supported the FederalElections Bill of 1890, which narrowly failed in Congress at creating renewedaction to protect black voters in the South. The reporter could not resistphysical descriptions of the venerable Douglass, “the old white-haired coloredpatriot,” who when “the breezes . . . of Maryland blew about his shoulders, hislong white fluffy locks” made him appear “the embodiment of all that could bepure and wise in man.” Douglass returned the flight of rhetoric, declaringHarrison “the best president since Lincoln.”5 [notes02.html#ch31fn_5a]With barely enough time to repack a bag, Douglass was off again on the longjourney to Minneapolis for the Republican convention, where he performed not asa delegate but as a symbolic presence. During his tour of the South, Douglasscould not have yet known that 1892 would suffer the most recorded lynchings (230total, 161 blacks, 69 whites) of any year over the more than half century thatthe Tuskegee Institute archives kept its famous records. What he did soon knowis that in March a white mob had destroyed the offices of the Memphis FreeSpeech, leading to the lynchings of three black businessmen, and the rapidemergence of a young antilynching and civil rights activist named Ida B. Wells.6[notes02.html#ch31fn_6a] Douglass soon met this extraordinary woman, who in herown way reinvigorated the aging leader’s career as she also challenged him.• • •At the 1892 Republican convention in June, President Harrison was renominated,and Douglass joined other stalwarts in keeping his shoulder loyally to the stoneof party unity. He saw no alternative to Harrison at the raucous convention and,as always, pledged to stump wherever Republicans would send him. But that springand summer, an increasingly exhausted Douglass was deluged at times withrequests to lecture as well as write for journals. He also heard frequently fromold friends and from people he did not know with complaints and advice. Oldcomrade Martha Greene sewed Douglass a dressing gown and urged him upon hisreturn from the Minneapolis convention to take a vacation and hoped he was not“wholly used up.”7 [notes02.html#ch31fn_7a]All of these matters were normal in old age. But some must have deeply affectedhim. Elizabeth Cady Stanton wrote in early 1892 about how her movement forwomen’s suffrage had made some progress, but that it felt like a horrible “taxon human patience to be forty years going through this moral wildernesswith . . . no pillar of light to lead the way.” She wished for a “golden calfwhose ears and tails and legs . . . could provide us the means of war.” JuliaCrofts wrote in June, wishing the busy Frederick would write to her more often.She described her ill health and dwindling income. Her husband had died sometime ago and she was lonely. “Think of me always as your old true friend,” shebegged, and urged Douglass to persist “til our work is done.” His old friend andonce employer of two of Douglass’s sons, H. O. Wagoner, in Denver, wrote to sayhe had suffered blindness, but still had someone to read to him an essay the oldabolitionist had written. Ellen Richardson from England, who had led thecampaign to purchase Douglass’s freedom, wrote to urge him to bear down onrevising Life and Times because it was “fitting employment in old age.”8[notes02.html#ch31fn_8a]But Douglass, despite fatigue and likely the beginning of arterial heartdisease, now had at least three jobs—as professional Republican; as commissionerfor Haiti to the Chicago Exhibition, including planning and funding of theHaitian Pavilion; and still as patriarch and provider for his troubled extendedfamily. In June, after returning from the Republican convention, he wrote to afriend that even after four days he had “not yet gotten over the strain put uponmy nerves” by the political event. He felt in constant demand, and inadequate tothe challenge. He complained that now he could “not stand the excitement of thecrowd” as he once had. He further had to suffer hearing himself “referred to asan ‘old man.’ ” But there was “still much work to do in the time I have”; heplanned to spend up to six months in Chicago at the Exposition the followingyear. And famous friends kept prodding him to keep up the fight.9[notes02.html#ch31fn_9a] Douglass still had to be Douglass, as best he could.The demands of fame and influence constantly beckoned. A “colored boy 18 yearsof age” from Natchitoches, Louisiana, named Edward Wright wrote in 1892 askingDouglass for advice on where he might “secure a splendid Educatchion north orsouth and where he can get his Legal Rights.” He wanted the great man to helphim “make a man of myself.” In a long letter, a seventeen-year-old black girlfrom Omaha, Nebraska, Augusta Johnson, begged Douglass to financially supporther effort to go to Tennessee Central College in Nashville. She currently had towork for her ill sister and family and did not want to be a servant anymore. “Ihave broader ideas than that,” Miss Johnson asserted with confidence. She andher sister had read Life and Times and yearned for attention from the author.“Girls have to be so particular about where they are and what they do,” wrotethis child of Reconstruction. Sometimes groups in the Deep South, such as one inLouisiana in June 1892, wrote to inform Douglass, the “hero” of the race, of thedepths of oppression they faced. Their ballots suppressed, with no onerepresenting them, in desperate need of physical protection, they beseeched theold leader to try to influence Congress. Naming only their parish, Terrebonne,they declared themselves “afraid to sign their names.”10[notes02.html#ch31fn_10a] In the face of these requests and more, Douglass feltessentially helpless. His correspondence could be both heartening andheartbreaking.Image [../images/f0719-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, on the grounds of Cedar Hill, c. 1892.But the wave of lynchings prompted him to take up the pen. In July 1892 hepublished “Lynch Law in the South” in the North American Review. Douglass triedto maintain composure as he developed an analysis of why lynching mobs seemed soshockingly ubiquitous across the South. But outrage and despair crept out of hiswords. Controversially, he suggested that even if some black men, like men ofother races, had committed a rape, lynching provided merely “an effort toneutralize one poison by the employment of another.” A “howling mob” rituallyexecuting a man in public “without judge or jury,” he wrote, is the real“crime,” and the destruction of law and order. The alleged act of sexualoutrage, Douglass maintained, was a mere “excuse” for violence against blacks.He still claimed a hope in good white people in the South, but acknowledged thattoo many in the mobs “have eyes, but see not, ears but hear not, and they rushto their work of death as pitilessly as the tiger rushes upon his prey.”11[notes02.html#ch31fn_11a] The beast in the dark recesses of the human psyche wasin the mob, not in the victim of ritual violence.Douglass reminded his readers that the crime of rape had for more than twohundred years been committed by white men against black women with no redress.Protecting the “purity of white women” only provided yet another excuse to hidereal causes. Douglass believed lynching occurred because blacks had made so much“progress” and were becoming “prosperous”: “The negro meets no resistance whenon a downward course.” But “when he shakes off his rags and wretchedness andpresumes to be a man . . . he contradicts this popular standard and becomes anoffence to his surroundings.” Douglass also asserted that during the Civil War,with white men gone to the battlefronts, many blacks were left on plantationswith white women and no such sexual attacks occurred. So evolved Douglass’sargument, made more fully in the coming two years, that lynching was amurderous, lawless, anarchic form of racial and social control justified byracist canards. He offered “two answers, one of hope and one of fear.” The hope,expressed somewhat lamely, was in the law, the courts, and the good men andwomen of the South who might rise up and stop such horrors. The fear, however,stated in the old abolitionist line that “oppression can make a wise man mad,”smoldered in the prospect of black retaliatory violence. Those who “sow thewind” will “reap the whirlwind,” Douglass warned with a trusted Old Testamentmaxim.12 [notes02.html#ch31fn_12a] He reached into his well of 1850s hope fromthe slavery crisis—faith placed in the best of human nature, in progress, in theConstitution, in evil that sows good through tragedy—but not much hope emergedfrom the lynching crisis of the 1890s.Despair of another kind visited Douglass and his family in late July 1892. Afterhis wife, Virginia, died in 1889, Frederick Douglass Jr.’s life spiraleddownward. He had always struggled financially; now his health collapsed. InSeptember of the previous year Frederick Jr. had checked into Freedmen’sHospital at Howard University for surgery. He suffered with respiratory disease,and now on July 26 he died at age fifty of what the era called consumption, orwhat the twentieth century knew as pulmonary tuberculosis. A funeral took placeon the twenty-eighth at Frederick Jr.’s home in Hillsdale, District of Columbia,where on the same property for some years he had operated a grocery. Accordingto a press report, the elder Douglass requested the ceremonies be kept brief andsimple. Many friends gathered around a casket in the parlor, a quartet from anAME Church sang “Rock of Ages,” and the Reverend Francis Jesse Peck officiated.The elder Douglass did not speak. A carriage transported the deceased toGraceland Cemetery, where he was buried next to Anna Murray Douglass, hismother.13 [notes02.html#ch31fn_13a]Although comforted by Helen and his other three children, this death of a son,in the wake of so many lost grandchildren, tested Douglass’s emotional conditionas few events had before. His sons had for so long been a source of pride andpersonal travail. Virtually nothing survives in his words of what this lossmeant to him. Duty beckoned all around as he quietly mourned. Douglass receivednumerous condolence letters from friends and acquaintances, but some came as“sympathy” couched in demands on his time, and invitations to lecture, includingdetails of train schedules. Some seemed to genuinely care about the father’sgrief, while others could not hide their desire for the orator’s performance.And the begging letters still arrived as well. Two young black men in direcircumstances, one a “poor man without any parents,” wrote in September, askingDouglass to help them get into Howard University. Douglass had trained his sonsas printers, but they never enrolled at Howard.Rock of ages, cleft for me,Let me hide myself in thee:Could my tears forever flow,Could my zeal no languor know.14 [notes02.html#ch31fn_14a]Douglass could not hide, nor did he intend to; his rock had broken apart manytimes before. He had to be a rock—for family and for the race. By August andSeptember he was off on speaking tours for the election campaign and in frequentcorrespondence and planning for the Haitian Pavilion at the Chicago World’sFair. Sometime that summer of 1892 he finally met Ida B. Wells, striking up anactivist friendship that would animate his remaining years. Douglass was wellaware of this extraordinary, but young and vulnerable, radical woman. He took ona fatherly mentor role toward her from the beginning, and she welcomed hissupport. From their first encounter, she saw Douglass as a heroic model, but oneshe felt safe in criticizing as well as adoring. Wells, who had fled Memphis andher native Mississippi for safety after writing bitter diatribes about lynchersand their acts, contemplated a tour of England to spread her cause. Douglasscounseled her to take to the speaking and journalistic-writing circuit with allthe courage and energy she could muster. He had told his people’s story as noother; now she would be that person on the searing cause of antilynching. Fortwo years they made a historic, if sometimes volatile, team. Wells consideredherself, nevertheless, only a “mouthpiece” about the lynching story, whereasDouglass she considered the true “orator.”15 [notes02.html#ch31fn_15a]Douglass wrote a public letter in October that Wells employed as an imprimaturin both of her famous books, Southern Horrors and The Red Record, each firstpublished in 1892 and 1895 respectively; she also invoked Douglass’srecommendation in sensitive situations where her veracity and gender equalitywere challenged. He in turn thanked Wells for her exposure of the “lynchabomination.” Nowhere in journalism, Douglass said, had there been any “wordequal to it in convincing power.” “Brave woman!” he declared, “you have doneyour people and mine a service. . . . If American conscience were only halfalive, if the church and clergy were only half Christianized, if American moralsensibility were not hardened . . . a scream of horror, shame, and indignationwould rise to Heaven wherever your pamphlet shall be read.” The letter was botha public appeal and a statement of spiritual and moral solidarity. It oftenfelt, he wrote, that “we are deserted by earth and Heaven—yet we must stillthink, speak and work, and trust in the power of a merciful God for finaldeliverance.” This was a newly impassioned and inspired Douglass. In her prefaceto Southern Horrors, Wells wrote that she offered no “shield” or “defense forthe poor blind Afro-American Samsons who suffer themselves to be betrayed bywhite Delilahs.” Instead, in a tradition Douglass and the abolitionists hadforged, she presented the “truth, an array of facts” by which she hoped through“this great American Republic . . . justice be done though the heavens fall.”16[notes02.html#ch31fn_16a] With help from political power and armies, truth andfacts had brought down slavery; might that be true someday of the horror oflynching?• • •At the same time Douglass joined the antilynching crusade, he stumped forHarrison’s reelection and felt the pain of the second presidential defeat forRepublicans since the war. Harrison had been elected in 1888 without winning thepopular vote, and Republicans had taken both houses of Congress. But the partyhad now evolved more as the agent of big business, of Andrew Carnegie’s notionof wealth that would enable entrepreneurs to foster some trickle down to themasses. Above all the Republicans became the proponents of high tariffs. TheHarrison administration wielded patronage without scruples, and its corporateidentity made it vulnerable to populist insurgency. Between 1877 and 1890, 6.3million immigrants had arrived in America, flooding labor markets and promptingindustries to pay lower wages, thus fueling an ever-intense and violent conflictbetween labor and capital. Between 1880 and 1900 some 6.5 million workersparticipated in approximately twenty-three thousand strikes. Republicans becamemore and more antilabor, and the farmers’ alliances, especially in the West,organized against them. The party of tariffs seemed to have abandoned workers by1892, and of even greater importance to Douglass, it all but avoided talkingabout race or the party’s egalitarian legacies from the Civil War andReconstruction. Douglass went on the stump as usual, but the election was adisaster for the Republicans. The Democrat, Grover Cleveland, won the popularvote by nearly half a million votes, and the electoral college in a landslide.His party took back both houses of Congress; the entire federal governmentrested suddenly in Democratic hands for the first time since before the CivilWar.17 [notes02.html#ch31fn_17a]Image [../images/f0723-01.jpg]Ida B. Wells, c. 1893, Mary Garrity photographer.The Republican Party was not quite in a death spiral, but it teetered inpolitical shock. Economic collapse in 1893 would give it new opportunities toregain power. But the 1892 debacle would be the last presidential canvass forDouglass. He received so many requests to give his views on the lost electionthat he wrote an essay, distributed widely in printed form. In “Douglass on theLate Election,” he tried to soft-pedal the defeat, predicting “no disastrousassault” upon the “welfare of the country,” as well as “no marked and visibledifference . . . in the condition of the colored people North or South.”Incongruently, he seemed to speak as an official within government (though henow was not) trying to hold together a center and some institutional confidencein the midst of fear and turmoil. Douglass maintained that the Democrats’ ideasabout free trade were “more easily managed on the stump than in Congress.” Heurged calm and argued against the evidence that “mere party, as such, has uponthe masses a weaker hold than at any time during the last thirty years.”18[notes02.html#ch31fn_18a] A partisan to the end, this prophet of self-reliancemisread once again the fervor of economic and labor populism.Douglass admitted to both “fears and hopes” for blacks, despite racial violenceand disfranchisement. He delivered, though, a harsh critique of his own party.He warned that for the short term, matters could be frightful. Contradictinghimself, he suggested that blacks might “feel that the old slave power is againsafely and securely in the national saddle.” He warned that Democrats exhibited“contempt for human rights.” But he somehow believed the Democratic insurgencywould be only temporary. Republicans had too often backed off, refusing tocounter the slanders of their opponents. He chastised his party for notaggressively defending blacks’ right to vote. Republicans, he said, offered “nota single idea to touch the conscience. . . . All is as cold as dollars anddimes.” But Douglass somehow extracted hope from defeat—the old wartime idea ofnecessary losses leading to ultimate victories. Straining for hope, he remarked,“I am convinced that as in the Bull Run disaster during the war, it [theelection] will prove a blessing in disguise.” He even put faith in Clevelandhimself, a man who, he contended, would not tolerate lawless violence (aterrible prediction). Above all, Douglass would not abandon the RepublicanParty. “No party could have behind it a grander record,” he asserted. “It hasonly to resume its old time character.”19 [notes02.html#ch31fn_19a] But thecrises of the 1890s required much more than nostalgia for the days of RadicalRepublicanism.• • •In the spring of 1892, Douglass visited Chicago to see the sites for thefairgrounds and examine construction of the Columbian Exposition. In February hehad been appointed “Full Commissioner of the Republic of Haiti” and later thatsummer learned that he would be paid $50 per month through May 1893 for hisservices. He worked for most of a year in close association with CharlesPreston, the Port-au-Prince–born former head of the Haitian legation inWashington. Douglass became involved in selection of the site of the pavilion,its costs and fund-raising, the transport of exhibition contents from theisland, and even in questions of whether the pavilion would be open on theSabbath, which he strongly favored, denouncing opposition as “bigotry andsuperstition.” By June he wrote to Preston about his apprehensions over whetherthe pavilion would be completed on time, and especially over whether thegovernment in Haiti would fully fund the project. Despite family affairs and hisdeclining health, Douglass made his representation of Haiti the centralcommitment of his life over the next year.20 [notes02.html#ch31fn_20a]The Columbian Exposition was so vast and ambitious that it could not becompleted and opened until 1893, a year later than planned. The fair had beenmany years in the planning by the business titans of Chicago, as well as bystate and federal governments. The “White City,” as the exposition became known,ultimately displayed a neoclassical and Romanesque architectural achievementlike no other. The great theme of the fair was “progress” and the onward marchof civilization, categorized and displayed in racial and ethnic hierarchies, aswell as machines and technology. Visitors were invited to come and dream of newutopian futures. Spectacular expectation and boosterism led to a totalattendance of 27,529,400 people at the fair in its six months of operation in1893. The fair drew people to the idea of immensity, to artistic beauty, to avision of the United States as gleaming and unified a mere twenty-eight yearsafter its Civil War, to the experience of collective play in a circusatmosphere, and to the fascination with categories of racial types as well asinferior and superior cultures. The fair trumpeted the forces of nationalism,imperialism, and consumerism as verities of the age. Moreover, the exposition,writes one of its best historians, rested on a “dual foundation”: one, theMidway Plaisance, a “honky-tonk sector” over a mile long and six hundred feetwide, characterized by the giant 280-foot-high Ferris wheel; and two, the theoryof “evolution,” rooted in ethnological or racial performances by groups from allcorners of the world.21 [notes02.html#ch31fn_21a]Architecturally, the mixtures of images and scale inspired awe. The grand Courtof Honor, with its long lagoon, gondolas afloat, and Daniel Chester French’shuge Statue of the Republic in its midst stopped anyone in his or her tracks togaze in wonder. The horizontal magnificence of the Machinery Hall, or the towersand glow of the Electricity Building, or the Golden Door on the TransportationBuilding, or the United States Government Building with its stunning blue dome,looking like some combination of an English palace and the US Capitol, as wellas many other edifices gave visitors all manner of illusions of an imperialVenice on Lake Michigan. Most of the structures were built to be temporary, withsteel skeletons covered over with a mixture of jute and plaster, designed toprovide an alabaster gleam. But the fair was about people, about whichcivilizations, cultures, or races had prevailed in the world. The superiority ofAnglo-Saxon thought and arts, of an America run by a white ruling class forgingprogress, unmistakably dominated the Exhibition.22 [notes02.html#ch31fn_22a]• • •African Americans and Native Americans were conspicuous at the fair either bytheir absence or by their vivid denigration. Along the Midway the fairorganizers placed a variety of “ethnological villages,” depicting the culturesof many nonwhite groups. As the manager of such exhibits the fair appointed theHarvard anthropologist Frederic Ward Putnam. Exoticism became a commodity aspeople paid admission to see a village of the Inuit tribes—Native peoples fromAlaska and Canada, commonly called Eskimos in the United States. The Inuit setup camps on the edge of the fair in the fall of 1892, and their physicalconditions worsened over the winter and into the spring of 1893. They were askedto don their fur garments and hoods and perform dances as though in the Articduring a Chicago summer.23 [notes02.html#ch31fn_23a]In early planning, several Native American leaders petitioned the fairorganizers to create their own exhibits “in the hands of capable men of our ownblood.” They asked to be part of the central purpose of the grand show: “Giveus . . . some reason to be glad with you that [America] was so discovered.” Fairauthorities were all too happy to have Indians as part of the ethnologicalMidway, but not on Indian terms. They were instead exploited for entertainmentas concessions were awarded to white showmen who specialized in degradingexhibitions of premodern Indian culture. They staged a “Sitting Bull’s Cabin,” alarge tepee lived in by nine Sioux in crowded conditions. Moreover, out beyondthe boundaries of the fair Buffalo Bill Cody’s “Wild West Show” competed withthe grand Midway. Native Americans were paid for their humiliations in acomplicated mixture of commerce and racism.24 [notes02.html#ch31fn_24a]Despite the hopes of Douglass and other black leaders, exposition officialstreated African Americans at the fair with a combination of neglect,paternalism, and tokenism. Frederick and Helen journeyed to Chicago for theOctober 12, 1892, dedication of the exposition. They stayed first at the PalmerHouse hotel, and later, during the long months of 1893, the Haitian commissionerboarded with Fannie Barrier Williams and S. Laing Williams, a prominent Chicagoclubwoman and her husband, a lawyer. The event would not actually open for someseven more months, but over one hundred thousand people turned out for paradesand for prolonged celebrations of the “progress of civilization.” Douglassattended receptions in his role as Haitian commissioner, often receiving formalapplause. Other than symbolism, he had no role in representing black Americans.Francis J. Bellamy, editor of Youth’s Companion, composed the Pledge ofAllegiance for the occasion, and on a well-organized cue, millions of childrenacross the country recited the pledge to “one nation indivisible, with libertyand justice for all.” African American proposals and exhibits were rejected bythe fair’s organizing committees. The black press condemned the exposition’sracial exclusion. In the wake of the dedication day, Douglass delivered arestrained rebuke. He found the inauguration ceremonies “glorious,” he said, but“one thing . . . dimmed their glory.” He admired the talk of “humanbrotherhood,” yet he detected “an intentional slight to that part of theAmerican population with which I am identified.”25 [notes02.html#ch31fn_25a] Theproblems had only begun.Back home in November for a while, Douglass became preoccupied with the belatedand disappointing publication of the final edition of Life and Times. He did notlike DeWolfe and Fiske’s layout, the paper quality, and their long delays. Butit was out, the final installment in all of its sometimes overwritten, oftenrigidly protective, name-dropping, but also richly detail-laden glory. The greatautobiographer had completed this part of his literary journey, begun on hissmall desk in Lynn, Massachusetts. More than seventy years of memory had beenplowed into one of the greatest autobiographical performances in Americanhistory. In the same month, Douglass exchanged letters with Julia Crofts. Shewas ill and lonely and worried about money. But she also observed her friend’s“weakened handwriting” and warned him to take care of his ever-present cough.She reminisced about the forty years since they had first met and looked aheadto meeting in “the blessed place where farewells are . . . unknown—where thewicked cease from troubling & and the weary are at rest.”26[notes02.html#ch31fn_26a] A weary and unhealthy Douglass rested up before hisreturn to the fray on the Chicago Midway.By comparison to some of the grand structures, the Haitian Pavilion emerged as asmall but significant feature of the Columbian Exposition. Completed ahead ofschedule and on budget, the structure was ready for its commissioner to takepossession by January 1893. The combination colonial- and Grecian-style buildingstood in a corner lot next to the much larger German pavilion, Das DeutscheHaus, as well as the national edifices of Spain and Canada. Forty-nine nationsin all participated in the exposition. One hundred fifty by one hundred feet andfifty feet high at the top of its central dome, the all-wood Haitian Pavilionspread its footprint with twelve-foot-wide verandas on three sides. The frontportico displayed the coat of arms of the island nation and the words RÉPUBLIQUEHAITIENNE in gold letters along with three dates—1492, 1804, and 1892. Thebuilding had the look of one built for the tropical islands, where any breezescould be captured on the verandas. Inside, a kitchen served Haitian coffee atten cents per cup. Assorted other relics and special objects included a bust ofToussaint Louverture, and allegedly one of Columbus’s anchors. The left wing ofthe building contained offices; here Douglass moved into the largest one, setaside for the commissioner.27 [notes02.html#ch31fn_27a] The former diplomat nowpresided over a symbolic representation of Haiti, a black nation born in one ofthe most violent slave rebellions in history, placed in a gigantic world’s fairin the middle of the great White City in the dead of a Chicago winter.Back in Chicago for the building’s completion ceremony, Douglass delivered twospeeches on January 2, the first to a hastily gathered small audience at thepavilion. In this short address, he heaped great praise on President Hyppolitefor his “diligence . . . sagacity and his patriotism” in providing the money andmaterial to build the pavilion. Douglass garnered applause in placing Haitisecurely by this act in “possession of our nineteenth century’s civilization.”Douglass spoke not as an American, but as an honorary Haitian. But he honoredthe fair’s directors for giving “us” one of “the very best sites,” and notrelegating Haiti to an obscure corner of the grounds. “It is not a candle putunder a bush,” he gushed, “but a city set upon a hill.” Douglass believed Haitihad added its piece to the fair’s “magic to dazzle and astonish the world.”28[notes02.html#ch31fn_28a]Then the orator shifted to a full-throated celebration of Haitian independenceand a somewhat purple narrative of the military victory of the black forcesagainst the inhumane French. The Haitian rebels, said Douglass, with their slaveheritage and lack of training, nevertheless fought “deception with deception,arms with arms . . . blood with blood,” and they never gave up. Above all,Haitians had in ninety years “never surrendered” their precious independence.Their victory had been more “herculean,” fought through more “terribleness,”than the Americans had endured in their revolution against the British. Douglassleft his afternoon audience contemplating Bonaparte and the “bones of hisunfortunate soldiers whitened upon a soil made rich with patriot blood.”Progress needed some transformative history in order to seem real.29[notes02.html#ch31fn_29a]Image [../images/f0729-01.jpg]The Haitian Pavilion, Columbian Exposition, Chicago, summer 1893.In the evening of January 2, at the Quinn Chapel, the oldest black church (AME)in the city, founded by former slaves, and now in a brand-new neo-Gothicstructure on Wabash Avenue in a growing black neighborhood known as Bronzeville,Douglass delivered a much longer speech to a crowd of fifteen hundred prominentChicagoans. In the United States, Haiti, its natural beauty and its history, hadnever been celebrated quite like this. He announced his big theme as Haiti’s“history . . . her probable destiny.” It was particularly an address about themeaning of Haiti in the nineteenth century for black people. A revolution andthe making of a republic by Africans and their descendants drove his narrative.“We have not yet forgiven Haiti for being black, or forgiven the Almighty formaking her black.” The oration simmered throughout with the tense politics ofrace in Douglass’s own country. A Haitian, he claimed, could travel anywhere inthe world with respect, except within the United States.30[notes02.html#ch31fn_30a] Douglass thus made Haiti a grand metaphor for humanfreedom won in blood.The orator wove natural beauty into politics at nearly every rhetorical turn,warning his American audience that the Unites States’ quest to obtain themagnificent Môle Saint-Nicolas would fail because of Haiti’s “repugnance tolosing control over a single inch of her territory.” Douglass warned off theAmerican “sharks, pirates, and Shylocks” who would exploit Haiti. Having knownand worked with President Hyppolite, he vigorously defended the dictator, evencomparing him to Lincoln in defending his nation against treason andrebellion.31 [notes02.html#ch31fn_31a]After some awkward defenses of Haitian society against accusations about itspoverty (children “running nude in the streets”), its strange practices ofvoodoo, its “snake worship,” or its alleged lazy cultural habits, Douglasshonored the country for its world-historical mission. Haiti had “taught theworld the danger of slavery and the value of liberty. In this respect she hasbeen the greatest of all our modern teachers.” “Until Haiti spoke,” he declaredin a refrain used many times, the world had not comprehended a path to theabolition of slavery. Douglass celebrated the slaughter of the French army onHaitian soil as a triumph of black people, sanctioned by ancient biblical roots.In blood sacrifice are nations and peoples born, Douglass asserted. “Pharaoh andhis hosts” met their just fate at the hands of “Negro manhood, Negro bravery,Negro military genius and skill.”32 [notes02.html#ch31fn_32a] On a cold night inChicago, the most famous black American warmly embraced the bloodiestnation-building story in the history of the Americas. In a United States wherelynchings were now constantly in the news and Jim Crow laws emerged fromSouthern legislatures, Douglass stood as the spokesman of the once dreadedlegacy of the Haitian Revolution. At Chicago in 1893 this American patriot,sickened once again at the power of white supremacy, needed an alternativenation to celebrate.• • •Douglass returned home to Cedar Hill for much of the winter of 1892–93. Thefair’s official opening did not take place until May. But the man from theTuckahoe still wore many hats. Despite the embrace of his honorary Haitianidentity and a kind of Pan-Africanism in the Chicago speech, he was still aprofessional Republican in this season of the party’s defeat. On February 13, atthe Union League Club of Brooklyn, New York, Douglass delivered an hour-longtribute to Abraham Lincoln. At this annual birthday commemoration of Lincoln,three hundred Republicans gathered for an elaborate banquet amid “bunting, flagsand flowers, and a fine oil painting of the martyred President,” as reported inthe press.33 [notes02.html#ch31fn_33a]Introduced to a prolonged ovation, Douglass served up his share of Lincolnlegend. But he never spoke publicly about the sixteenth president without apolitical purpose that served the cause of black freedom or civil rights. Inthis atmosphere of mystic hero worship Douglass called Lincoln “godlike” and thegreatest American who “ever stood or walked upon the continent.” Douglass placedLincoln in the line of classic heroes, those who had been tested in crisis andled nations through their “darkest hours.” Douglass had this audience of GildedAge New Yorkers in the palm of his hand: “The time to see a great captain is notwhen the wind is fair and the sea is smooth, and the man in thecross-trees . . . can safely sing out, ‘All is well.’ At such a time a pigmy mayseem a giant. . . . You must see him when the sky is dark . . . see him in thehour of danger . . . when his ship is in distress.” Because he had taken thecountry through its worst storm, Lincoln was “such a captain” and a “hero worthyof your highest worship.”34 [notes02.html#ch31fn_34a] How dearly in the 1890s,the orator implied, the nation needed such a captain now.The image of the savior Lincoln characterized much Lincoln oratory. But Douglassput it to his own ends: “I had the good fortune to know Abraham Lincolnpersonally and peculiarly.” The “peculiar” element was the black man welcomedwithout racist pretension at the White House. Douglass thus brought attention tohis own prominence, relishing the tales of his meetings with Lincoln and hispride of place in history, which is what almost every Yankee did who knewLincoln. But it was also a commentary on the racism deep in so many humanrelationships all over America. Douglass was fond of using Lincoln’s ability to“make me at ease” as a metaphor for the possibility of equality in racerelations. Gone in this speech were any “stepchildren” metaphors, used sobrilliantly in 1876; gone also were any identifications with Pan-Africanism orrefrains about “when Haiti spoke.” Instead, he returned to the idea of acomposite America: “I have seen both sides of this great world. I have seen menof all conditions . . . high and low, rich and poor, slave and free, white andblack.” Douglass used Lincoln to appeal to human unity. “I feel it more to be aman and a member of the great human family,” he announced, “than to be a memberof any one of the many varieties of the human race, whether Anglo-Saxon,Anglo-African, or any other.”35 [notes02.html#ch31fn_35a] In this his lastpublic Lincoln eulogy, it was as if Douglass imagined that the perniciousexhibition of human types about to be displayed on the Chicago Midway could berefuted by a vision of human unity forged through the prairie politician whoovercame his roots and saved the Union.The Chicago Haiti speech and the Brooklyn Lincoln speech, though they seem sodifferent, were not opposite stories for Douglass. Even if stretching thethreads of history a bit, they were a way of linking Toussaint and Lincoln asdifferent kinds of liberators, different providential actors in an apocalyptichistorical trajectory; portraits of both figures hung in prominent places inDouglass’s parlor at Cedar Hill. Nation making needed blood sacrifice and evenmartyrdom. If the times demanded the model of Haiti as a black republic, theyneeded even more the legacy of a reinvented American republic and the life anddeath of Lincoln in whose blood symbolically a new country was born. In nationalmemory, blacks now needed Lincoln as he now needed them. But the symbolicLincoln could do nothing about a collapsing economy. A mere three weeks beforeGrover Cleveland’s second inauguration, three major American railroads wentunder, and before long some five hundred banks and fifteen thousand companieswould fail in the devastating Panic of 1893.36 [notes02.html#ch31fn_36a]With his Brooklyn audience Douglass remembered walking in the mud ofPennsylvania Avenue behind Lincoln’s carriage on the day of his secondinauguration, a deep “foreboding” in Douglass’s mind about plots to murder thepresident. Then deftly, Douglass quoted the strongest antislavery lines from theSecond Inaugural Address: “Every drop of blood drawn by the lash shall be paidby another drawn by the sword.” Such inspiring language, Douglass claimed, hehad never otherwise witnessed. “There seemed at the time to be in the man’s soulthe united souls of all the Hebrew prophets.” This was no mere hyperbole by onewho had so carefully read those prophets and adopted their stories ofdestruction and rebirth. Moreover, Douglass instructed these staunch advocatesof tariffs and sound money that Lincoln’s assassination was the “natural outcomeof a war for slavery.” Lincoln the emancipator loomed large not only for a partythat had lost its conscience, but in an era when the federal government wouldexercise “no power . . . to protect the lives and liberties of American citizensin any of our Southern states from barbarous, inhuman, and lawless violence.”37[notes02.html#ch31fn_37a] Ever the ironist, and modeling his favorite prophets,even as the after-banquet speaker in the club of his friends, Douglass enlistedLincoln in the fight against lynching.• • •With Douglass’s strong support, on April 5, 1893, Ida Wells embarked on aspeaking tour of England. Two of Douglass’s friends, Isabella Fyvie Mayo, awell-connected Scottish reformer, and Catherine Impey, a wealthy English Quakeractivist and editor, invited Wells to make the journey and spread the cause ofantilynching. Impey in particular corresponded with Douglass, often looking forblack activists who might come to England and help her promote her own journal,Anti-Caste, and its various causes. “I was a guest in Mr. Douglass’s home whenthe letter [from Impey] came,” Wells remembered in her autobiography. “It saidthat they knew Mr. Douglass was too old to come. . . . I gave him the letter toread and . . . he said, ‘You go my child, you are the one to go, for you havethe story to tell.’ ” The frustrated young activist was elated: “It seemed likean open door in a stone wall.”38 [notes02.html#ch31fn_38a]At first Wells’s tour succeeded gloriously, especially in Scotland, with Mrs.Mayo and Miss Impey organizing the engagements and introducing Wells to reformleadership. Just as Douglass had done forty-six years earlier with theabolitionist cause, Wells now stood before large audiences (one thousand fivehundred men in Aberdeen), she later wrote, “telling of conditions in the Southsince the Civil War, Jim Crow laws, ballot-box intimidation . . . laws againstinter-marriage . . . , cruel physical atrocities vented upon my race.” Wells wasa sensation; a new era with new issues had a new voice. She collected piles ofclippings about her performances from the British press, carried them home, andlater filled her autobiography with extensive excerpts. A feud and scandalerupted, however, over Impey’s open sexual relationship with the “darker” GeorgeFerdinands, a dentist and house guest of Mayo’s who was from Ceylon. Wellsdefended Impey and her right to any interracial relationship. Mayo condemned andshunned both women. Wells had also openly defended Douglass’s marriage to HelenPitts, whom she warmly befriended. Mayo had financed the young American’stravels; after five weeks Wells returned to America, worried for her ownreputation but inspired by her experience abroad.39 [notes02.html#ch31fn_39a]Soon she was in Chicago planning and working with Douglass at the HaitianPavilion.Even before her British tour, Wells had discussed with Douglass and two othermen, Ferdinand Barnett, a Chicago lawyer and her future husband, and I. GarlandPenn, an educator, the prospect of producing a pamphlet that would expose thediscrimination against blacks at the Columbian Exposition. But the projectneeded money, and though Douglass took the lead in fund-raising among hisfriends, he initially failed in the face of the deepening Panic of 1893. It tookmany months and much controversy before The Reason Why the Colored American IsNot in the World’s Columbian Exposition was published. Douglass enlistedFrederick J. Loudin, a shoe manufacturer and manager of the Fisk JubileeSingers, to join him in issuing a fund-raising appeal, “To the Friends of EqualRights.” Douglass and Loudin each put up $50 of their own money, but the appealfailed with blacks, much less with whites.40 [notes02.html#ch31fn_40a]The Chicago fair was a spectacle that all wanted to see; but for blacks andother nonwhite groups it was both irresistible and appalling. It offered allmanner of intellectual and scientific “congresses,” as well as ananthropological freak show. The exposition leadership planned a Colored People’sDay on August 25. Wells vehemently opposed such a segregated day, while Douglassdecided that such a “Jubilee Day” could be used to show and tell the story ofAfrican American progress. The old pragmatist thought he could still reach openminds. He had not come to Chicago for the entire summer merely to provide anobject for gawkers. Douglass would use the day to challenge the White City.Wells worried that to participate in such a day would imply black contentmentwith their lot. Some black newspapers, especially the Indianapolis Freeman,attacked the idea as well as the proposed pamphlet. “No ‘Nigger Day’ ” and “No‘Nigger Pamphlet’!” screamed its headlines. While Wells was still in England,Douglass fought back. “Why may we not tell of our persecution and murder in thiscountry because of our race and color?” he demanded in a letter to the paper.“Shall our voices be mute and our tongues paralyzed because our words may painthe ears of our oppressors? . . . No brother Freeman, we must not be silent. Wehave but one weapon unimpaired and that is the weapon of speech, and not to useit . . . is treason to the oppressed.” Douglass almost gave up on the pamphlet,but when Wells returned to Chicago, the two allies raised $500 from blackwomen’s organizations, and the book moved ahead. It was not published in fourlanguages as hoped (including French, Spanish, and German) but only in Englishwith prefaces in the other three.41 [notes02.html#ch31fn_41a]Privately, however, in midsummer Douglass admitted to his daughter Rosetta adeep frustration. Complaining of his failing eyesight and feeling that he was“going downhill,” he also revealed that he had loaned the Haitian government$1,400 to keep the pavilion open. Worse, he felt discouraged at the fate ofblacks amid all the wonders of the fair: “We cut no great figure at this fair.We do not seem to be a part of it. . . . It seems like hoping against hope.” AsColored People’s Day neared, many blacks planned to boycott the event. Wellsagreed to disagree with her hero. August 25 became a day of anguish for many andinspiration for some. For many weeks, the large Midwestern R. T. Davis MillingCompany had maintained a booth at the fair, featuring Nancy Green, afifty-nine-year-old former slave and longtime servant for a prominent whiteChicagoan, as “Aunt Jemima.” The stereotypical plantation “mammy” Green flippedpancakes while wearing a red bandanna, smiling and talking in Southern countrydialect. The booth, in the shape of a huge flower barrel, became a must-see atthe fair. But worse, on Jubilee Day as people arrived in the morning, they weremet with watermelon stands placed throughout the grounds. Douglass joined manyof his race in bitter disappointment when he saw this affront and nearly calledoff the events he had planned for Festival Hall, a large venue at theexposition. More than a thousand people attended on a hot day, most of themblack. Wells stayed home in disgust and left the old man to preside over whatcould have been one of the greatest embarrassments of his life.42[notes02.html#ch31fn_42a]The best eyewitness account of what happened is that of the twenty-one-year-oldpoet Paul Laurence Dunbar. Dunbar had recently relocated to Chicago andpublished his first book of poems, Oak and Ivy. Dunbar found a job working formeager wages as a “washroom caretaker” at the fair. He also made good friendswith the young poet-artist James Weldon Johnson, who with a group of collegeclassmates came up from Atlanta for the summer to work as “chair boys,” drivingcarts carrying people around the fair. Johnson too witnessed Douglass’s ColoredPeople’s Day address. Dunbar, unlike Johnson, had met Douglass, at a socialevent; the Sage had read some of the young man’s poems and all but adopted himon the spot. A music teacher introduced Dunbar to Joseph Douglass, the violinistgrandson, who was to play at the festivities. When he met the elder statesman,Dunbar remembered the scene: “The old man was just finishing dinner. He got upand came tottering into the room. ‘And this is Paul Dunbar,’ he said, shakinghands and patting me on the shoulder.” The artist was awed and quoted Douglassas saying, “Paul, how do you do? I’ve been knowing you for some time and you’reone of my boys.” Then Douglass asked Dunbar to read his “Ode to Ethiopia” to thegathered social group, after which Old Man Eloquent took up the young man’s bookand himself read “The Ol’ Tunes.” Douglass further invited Dunbar to come toWashington and live with him for a while after the fair. He said he would takecare of the struggling artist. “I have got one fiddler” (the grandson), Douglassremarked, “and now I want a poet.” After this extraordinary meeting Douglassmade sure that Dunbar had a place on the program for August 25 and gave him aposition at the Haitian Pavilion as well at $5 per week out of thecommissioner’s own pocket.43 [notes02.html#ch31fn_43a] He took care of the youngartist.Image [../images/f0736-01.jpg]Paul Laurence Dunbar, c. 1893.At the ceremony Douglass walked to the stage with Isabella Beecher-Hooker,sister of Harriet Beecher Stowe. Then he took the podium and introduced numerousblack ministers, including the AME bishop Henry McNeal Turner. As keynoter,Douglass delivered a version of his speech “The Race Problem in America.” As theSage began reading the typewritten address, hecklers around the rim of the hallshouted catcalls, recorded Dunbar. Douglass became unnerved; his hand holdingthe text began shaking and his “voice faltered.” But suddenly he threw the pagesdown on the lectern, pulled off his spectacles, and tossed them down on thetext. With “fire in his eyes,” the Lion showed the “battle that had flamed on somany abolition platforms.” Dunbar recited his stunning memory: Douglass “tossedback his head, ran his fingers through the lion-like mane of hair,” and spoke in“sonorous tones, compelling attention, drowning out catcalls as an organ would apenny whistle.” The hecklers, recalled Dunbar, went silent.44[notes02.html#ch31fn_44a]In what became a precursor for the last great speech of the orator’s life, “TheLessons of the Hour,” first delivered in the fall of 1893 and then many times in1894, Douglass found the old voice and preached an old creed. He forthrightlyfaced the lynching issue on this supposed day of celebration: “Men talk of theNegro problem. There is no Negro problem. The problem is whether the Americanpeople have honesty enough, loyalty enough, honor enough, patriotism enough tolive up to their Constitution.” Too many whites had branded the Negro a “moralmonster,” against all reasonable evidence. In too many places “mobs have takenthe place of law. . . . They hang, shoot, burn men of the race without justiceand without right.” An embittered Douglass declared the United States a tyranny,a nation of corrupted memory, abandoning its victories in favor of power, greed,racial fear, and pride. “We only ask to be treated as well as you treat the lateenemies of your national life.” These were stirring strokes about how the CivilWar now felt nearly lost. But he also acknowledged the ugly theme of theexposition. He asked the audience to observe black progress since slavery: Donot “measure the Negro” by the “standard of the splendid civilization of theCaucasian. . . . Measure him by the depths out of which he has risen.” When IdaWells heard about Douglass’s performance, she hurried down to the fair and“begged his pardon,” she recalled, “for presuming in my youth and inexperienceto criticize him for an effort which had done more to bring our cause to theattention of the American people than anything else which had happened duringthe fair.”45 [notes02.html#ch31fn_45a]Five days later ten thousand copies of The Reason Why the Colored American IsNot in the World’s Columbian Exposition were published, and Douglass, Wells, andDunbar handed it out in the central hall of the Haitian Pavilion every day forthe remaining two months of the exposition. According to Wells, Douglass hadreported for duty daily at the pavilion all summer, where he “held high court.”Most days, she said, the black celebrity was “swamped by white persons whowanted to shake his hand, tell of some former time when they had heard himspeak.” She even complained that while walking around the fairgrounds withDouglass, she never managed any conversation because he attracted constant fansand onlookers. These images prompted one Douglass biographer to call hispresence in Chicago that of “the antique abolitionist . . . as much a relic asany on display” over on the Midway.46 [notes02.html#ch31fn_46a] Hordes of whiteand foreign visitors did gaze at a symbol of a vanished slavery, and of a bloodyold conflict now, in their view, overcome. The large, stocky, elderly black manwith stunning white hair might have stimulated both pride and perversity in thethrongs of people who came to “see Douglass.” But Douglass was no caged exhibit;he brought his pen and voice and they were not yet worn-out. No relic, he was aliving, talking monument with much left to say, even if his voice could notunseat the powerful. Nowhere in the United States had a humane memorial yet beenerected to the endurance and life-affirming survival of American slaves, muchless to the black soldiers who had fought and died for freedom. But in Chicagofor six months in 1893 slavery had both an embodiment and a refutation.Douglass wrote the introduction for The Reason Why, and anyone who read it couldnot miss the author’s central point: slavery—its moral tentacles, its spirit,its revived ideology, its history—still infested the fabric of American society.Douglass delivered an indictment of his country and its failure to live up tothe promises of 1863 to 1868. “So,” he wrote directly, “when it is asked why weare excluded from the World’s Columbian Exposition, the answer is Slavery.”47[notes02.html#ch31fn_47a]Douglass plunged his reader into a past that would not die. Many good thingsawaited saying, he wrote, about “our country and countrymen, of which we wouldbe glad to tell . . . if we could do so, and at the same time tell the truth.”Then followed perhaps the longest sentence Douglass ever wrote (a page and ahalf), identifying more than twenty “things” he wished were true: “that Americanlaw is now the shield alike of black and white; that the spirit of slavery andclass domination has no longer any lurking place in any part of thiscountry; . . . that here Negroes are not tortured, shot, hanged or burned todeath, merely on suspicion of crime and without seeing a judge.” The litany ofdispossession, horror, and betrayal finally ended with “that to the coloredpeople of America, morally speaking, the World’s Fair now in progress is not awhited sepulcher.” This was Douglass the orator of old, the master of repetitionand metaphor. To read it closely was to hear Jeremiah updated to 1893. He mayhave stunned readers into despair. Too many white Americans gave no value toblack life, he argued fifty-one years after his Fourth of July speech. Themurder of a black man, said Douglass, no longer mattered “in point of economy”as it had during slavery. And the central motive of lynching? he asked.Political “disfranchisement”—the elimination of black votes.48[notes02.html#ch31fn_48a] History, he demanded, was never over, whether atmoments of high triumph or horrible defeat.The truth was terrifying; the “whited sepulcher” needed some kind of redemptivemeaning. Like the Douglass of old, he provided an ending of strained hope. Allthe violent reaction to black progress was proof of the race’s advancement: “Aship rotting at anchor meets with no resistance, but when she sets sail on thesea, she has to buffet opposing billows.” Keep “faith in the power of truth,” heurged, “faith in work and faith in . . . manly character.” He even suggested a“cheerful spirit” and that readers exercise patience. Lamely he counseled, “Nextto victory is the glory and happiness of manfully contending for it. Therefore,contend! contend!”49 [notes02.html#ch31fn_49a] A sad, if not defeated, man hadwritten those words. If only metaphors could stop lynch mobs.• • •Douglass stayed in the Midwest most of the fall of 1893, closing out his dutiesfor Haiti and reworking a lecture he took on the road. But more anguished newssoon arrived from the family. Rosetta’s oldest daughter, Annie, married toCharles S. Morris, sometimes Douglass’s young traveling companion, and a studentat the University of Michigan who tried to finance his education as a bootblack,had taken ill. She had been living at Cedar Hill, apart from her husband. InOctober, Douglass reluctantly loaned $300 to Charles to move Annie, who was nowpregnant, out to Ann Arbor, Michigan. On November 11, Rosetta wrote in shock toher father, who was off lecturing, “I received the heartbreaking news of my dearAnnie’s death. . . . I am utterly dazed and crushed.” Two weeks later, Rosettawrote again in grief; Annie had died just before her twenty-ninth birthday. “Ifonly she hadn’t gone to Ann Arbor she would have been living today.” The doctorhad said she was “not equal to such travel.”50 [notes02.html#ch31fn_50a]Douglass may have lost count of how many grandchildren had passed on, and bylate fall he had not seen any of them in many months. Rosetta and Nathan had nowlost two of their seven children. Through motherhood, joy and loss had long beenRosetta’s fate. Out on the lonely lecture circuit, a grandfather wept. He hadnow lost an Anna and two Annies.• • •The Columbian Exposition concluded at the end of October after 184 days.Lynchings continued throughout the country; the economic depression deepened aslabor unrest exploded. Among the many “congresses” held during the fair was oneon labor late in the summer. On September 2, Douglass presided at anextraordinary session, “Negro Labor.” The speakers included Booker T.Washington, Ida B. Wells, and Henry Demarest Lloyd, the muckraking progressivejournalist and labor activist who organized the session. Labor leaders andreformers from around the world attended the congress. In his remarks, the stillrelatively little-known Washington criticized the crop lien system in the Southand the endless debt it forced blacks to suffer. He emphasized Southern blacks’desire for manual labor, and to receive a “fair chance,” as he touted thesuccesses of Tuskegee Institute in its short history. If fairness andconciliation prevailed, “friction between the races is to pass away,” and asolution could be found to the race problem, said Washington.Wells and Douglass expressed starkly different views. Wells challenged the ideathat good race relations lay ahead, since whites desperately needed blackworkers and purposely kept them in poverty and debt. For his part, Douglassacknowledged the necessity of self-reliance, since he had so often preached ithimself. But he countered Washington, arguing that blacks in the South weredenied property ownership, money, and savings. They were victims of the“mortgage system” and the “script system.” Blacks, said Douglass, faced avicious economic structure. “The man who in slavery days said to the Negro, ‘Youshall be a slave or die,’ now added, ‘You shall work for me at the wages Ipropose or starve.’ ”51 [notes02.html#ch31fn_51a] The panel had laid bare thefault lines in economic and social thought among black leadership for ageneration to come.On September 22, Emancipation Day, Douglass spoke in Springfield, Illinois, andvisited Lincoln’s tomb. Struggling now with his strength and health, henevertheless stayed on the road, and in Detroit on October 5 at a theater hedelivered what was likely the first full version of “The Lessons of the Hour,” aspeech that sometimes also went under the titles “Why the Negro Is Lynched” and“The Negro Problem.” On October 7, he wrote a telling letter to his son Charles.Douglass’s hand no longer worked effectively while writing, and he complainedabout dictation. Worn-out and homesick, he reported that he was “still sufferingfrom my cough and am tempted to break away and come home. . . . I shall tryhowever to pull through to the end of the fair.” He told Charles that his sonJoseph was “playing finely,” but he (the grandfather) still urged him “on toperfection.” Douglass worried about his apples and pears going to waste in theCedar Hill orchards. He hoped someone back home could make sure he “could have alittle apple sauce in the coming winter.” He had frequently written about hisill health, complaining to Charles earlier in the summer of “a cough and lagrippe” (diarrhea).Charles “shuddered” at the reports of his father’s recurring bad health, beggingthat “if you ever intend to relax your efforts, it seems to me that now is fullthe time.” Exhausted and lonely, the elder Douglass oddly sought recognition andrespect from his sons. He yearned so much to “plant my feet on Cedar Hill”again, but admitted he should be satisfied. “I am certainly doing . . . good inthe life I am living,” wrote Douglass, feeling old but in a tender moment. “I amholding up the standard for my people—you would be proud to see the respect andesteem I am everywhere commanding for my race as well as for myself.”52[notes02.html#ch31fn_52a] In such personal tones, Douglass seemed to need toconvince himself of the public relevance of his storied career, and that hecould still forge on.Having started life around brutal violence on the Wye plantation, having beenpummeled by thugs on the Baltimore docks and beaten to his knees by EdwardCovey, and having argued righteously for the blood of slaveholders as a warpropagandist during the war, Douglass had at least one more fight in him. Blackvotes were endangered, but he still owned his pen and his voice. So he purloinedhope and despair through an analysis of the times. Douglass delivered “Lessons”in many cities and venues in 1894. One of the most telling was in MetropolitanAME Church on January 9 in front of a packed house. He had long rehearsed manyof the oration’s arguments, even in brief inscriptions in his books. On January22, 1893, in the flyleaf of a copy of Life and Times signed to a De Witt Miller,Douglass wrote, “Not a Negro Problem, not a race problem, but a nationalproblem; whether the American people will ultimately administer equal justice toall the varieties of the human race in this Republic.”53[notes02.html#ch31fn_53a]In a careful explication of the origins of lynching emerged the final cause ofhis life. It was an ugly irony. Douglass grabbed his audience’s attention bydescribing the lawless terror practiced at lynchings: “mob law” had taken on“frantic rage and savage extravagance.” Evil had been unleashed in the humanspirit. Using Psalm 91, he declared, “When the poison of anarchy is once in theair, like the pestilence that walketh in the darkness, the winds of heaven willtake it up and favor its diffusion.” Douglass acknowledged that the “mis-callednegro problem” belonged to the “whole country.” The shock of the news camenearly every day now: “Not a breeze comes to us from the late rebellious statesthat is not tainted and freighted with negro blood.” Mobs had replacedconstables and police. America had descended into racial chaos, and apologistsfor the “mobocratic murderers” had too much sway over public opinion. Facts andtruth seemed hardly to matter anymore. Douglass first demanded that his auditorssee and listen, before analyzing a lynching: “It is commonly thought that onlythe lowest and most disgusting birds and beasts, such as buzzards, vultures andhyenas, will gloat over and prey upon dead bodies. But the southern mob in itsrage feeds its vengeance by shooting, stabbing and burning when their victimsare dead.”54 [notes02.html#ch31fn_54a]Douglass contended that antilynching activists faced a virulent misinformationcampaign. Blacks had to be defended as a group against the charge of “rape.”Though it is difficult to “prove a negative,” he asserted that the long-standingcharacter of black Southerners, as well as the character of their accusers, wereboth grounds for denial. “The mob . . . brings this charge,” Douglass declared,and “it is the mob that the country has accepted as its witness.” He offered anargument that has resonated right into the twenty-first century. The accusers aswell as those who committed the atrocities were “men who justify themselves incheating the Negro out of his constitutional right to vote.” No one shouldbelieve those who surround “the ballot box with obstacles and sinuosities . . .intended to . . . defeat . . . the elective franchise.” At the bottom oflynchings lay lodes of “vulgar popular prejudice.”55 [notes02.html#ch31fn_55a]But so did bold political motives of greed and power. A colossal lie in theservice of political and social control drove the terror. A disfranchiser todaymight be a lyncher tomorrow. Killing blacks killed their votes.Douglass offered some history, and thereby a kind of lawyerly devastation oflynching’s defenses. Three “distinct periods of persecution” against blacks, andtherefore three sets of “excuses,” provided the hideous mythology that fueledthe lynching epidemic. All of the excuses began with the idea that if charges ofrape by black men of white women were true, why did authorities not stop mobsand demand adjudication in courts? The “modesty” of white women had always beena central concern of courts. But Douglass gave the story a long view. In theprolonged night of slavery, violence always lurked ready to respond to theexcuse of “insurrection.” Rumor of rebellion, much less actual revolts, had ledto many a terrified slave’s death. During Reconstruction, the fear of “negrosupremacy” (the second excuse) became the battle cry of white supremacists, whoused murder to destroy their potential political adversaries. And now, in athird era in which social order seemed desperately at stake and blacks demandedtheir promised citizenship rights, the alleged “assault upon defenseless women”provided the third and most lethal excuse for ritualistic murder of black men.When old excuses wore out their use, white Southerners found “sterner andstronger” reasons to destroy the African American quest for dignity and life.56[notes02.html#ch31fn_56a]The “new charge,” rape, Douglass maintained, had tainted everything about racerelations across the land. He especially argued that alleged sexual assault andthe violence exacted against blacks meant “paving the way for our [blacks’]entire disfranchisement.” Slavery had always been a “system of legalizedoutrage” upon black women by white men, and “no white man was ever shot, burned,or hanged for availing himself of all the power that slavery gave him.” Theperceived loss of that power drove men now to lynch mobs and ritual killings.Too many white Southerners still lived by a slaveholding mentality: “Theirinstitutions have taught them no respect for human life, and especially the lifeof the negro.” A Black Lives Matter counterargument to the extralegal killing ofblack people is more than a century old. It leaped from the text of Douglass’s“Lessons” speech. On the day of Douglass’s speech in Washington, January 9,1894, a black man named Samuel Smith was lynched in Greenville, Madison County,Florida. He had been accused of murder.57 [notes02.html#ch31fn_57a]Douglass’s speech on lynching oozed pain and despair. He believed that lynchingsconstituted the political silencing of black people. Such a big goal needed abig “lie” as justification: “Yet, while any lie may be safely told against thenegro . . . this lie will find eloquent mouths bold enough to tell it, and pridethemselves upon their superior wisdom in denouncing the ignorant negro voter.”Lynching, therefore, was fundamentally a problem of politics, morality, economy,and memory. Looming behind sharecropping and the desire of landholders to keepblacks “fastened to the land as by hooks of steel” were their threats ofviolence. Whites, North and South, could twist language and contend thatdisfranchisement was a moderate reform to contain black lust and aggression.Moreover, the struggle over the memory of the Civil War and Reconstruction hadbeen hijacked and corrupted by the lynching narrative. “Principles which we allthought to have been firmly and permanently settled by the late war have beenboldly assaulted and overthrown by the defeated party.” Douglass had nearly losthope. “Rebel rule is nearly complete in many states,” he declared nearly threedecades after Appomattox, “and it is gradually capturing the nation’s Congress.The cause lost in the war, is the cause regained in peace, and the cause gainedin war, is the cause lost in peace.” This was about as bad a fate as Douglassmight ever have imagined for the cause at the heart of his life. Some hostilewhite newspapers, such as one in Alexandria, Virginia, found the speech“incendiary” and “dangerous,” even fearing it would only instill “nihilisticideas” in his audiences.58 [notes02.html#ch31fn_58a]In Metropolitan AME’s pulpit that night in January 1894, Douglass tried toawaken the slumbering conscience of the country with a renewed fire andindignation, to drive a dagger into the political heart of the nation thatbetrayed its own rebirth. The fate of the republic was at stake in this crisisof violence. Stop violating the Constitutional amendments, he demanded.“Cultivate kindness and humanity” instead of hatred. Cease degrading one groupto elevate another. And to white people, he admonished, “Conquer yourprejudices.” As a great and abiding nineteenth-century liberal he asked thenation to go back to the “glorious truths” in its creeds, to hear the bestvoices of its history as the “trump of an arch angel, summoning hoary forms ofoppression and time honored tyranny to judgment.” Never forget, he pleaded, thatAmerica’s mission still stood as “the redemption of the world from the bondageof ages.”59 [notes02.html#ch31fn_59a] The best instincts of moral suasion werenever out-of-date, but in this moment they were as much a prayer as an analysis.The crowd in the pews were on their feet cheering as Douglass reached thesecrescendos. Then the exhausted old orator folded his text to sit down. Areporter for the Evening Star recorded, “Thus spoke Frederick Douglass . . .with uplifted eyes and arms, as if to invoke heaven to bear witness, and theechoes of his words were drowned in a tumultuous storm of applause.” Douglassremained “slightly bent” during the address, wrote the journalist, but performedwith “voice unshaken.” Just as he had begun his career fifty-four years earlier,he fought with his only real weapon—the infinity, majesty, and power of words.Douglass concluded, “Based upon the eternal principles of truth, justice andhumanity . . . your Republic will stand and flourish forever.”60[notes02.html#ch31fn_60a] Then he dropped his arms and bowed."},{"pageContent":"EPILOGUE--------------------------------------------------------------------------------THEN DOUGLASS PASSEDOh, Douglass, thou hast passed beyond the shore,But still thy voice is ringing o’er the gale!Thou’st taught thy race how high her hopes may soar,And bade her seek the heights, nor faint, nor fail.She will not fail, she heeds thy stirring cry,She knows thy guardian spirit will be nigh,And, rising from beneath the chast’ning rod,She stretches out her bleeding hands to God!—PAUL LAURENCE DUNBAR, “FREDERICK DOUGLASS,” 1895Amid weariness and inconsistent health, Douglass remained astonishingly activeand engaged in the last months of life. In February 1894 he wrote to old comradeJulia Crofts, “I am still alive and in active service.” Given the violence andracism that now “assailed” blacks, he fell back upon a sense of Providencearound which he and Julia had long ago found common cause: “As things are, wecan only labor and wait in the belief that God reigns in Eternity and that allthings work together for good.” Nearly a year later, he wrote to J. E. Rankin,of Howard University, banishing any rumors that he would be interested in takingon the presidency of that institution: “I have been a long time in this worldand a long time acquainted with myself, and I know . . . just what I am fitfor.” On February 6, 1895, he rejected an invitation to speak on February 21(which would be the day after his death) with the disclaimer: “I have more workon my hands than I know how to accomplish and cannot well take any more on orgive promises to any more.”1 [notes02.html#epifn_1a] It was a time for takingstock of past and present, but Douglass never retired his pen or his voice.Until his dying day Old Man Eloquent received an unending array of invitationsto lecture, many of which he accepted. He continued to deliver the “Lessons”lecture in various forms. The extended Douglass family still provided him withjoy, especially the surviving grandchildren, as well as financial and emotionaltravail. With son Lewis taking the lead, Douglass invested further in realestate in Washington, near Annapolis, and in Baltimore. Fame remained a seriousproblem; he performed repeatedly as the race’s representative man, enduring theusual slings and arrows that role entailed. His health seemed to rise and fall,and he disliked the perception that he was now an old man.2[notes02.html#epifn_2a] Moreover, Douglass never stopped trying to ascertain theidentity of his father and his own birthday. It gnawed at him like a hunger thatcould never be fulfilled.After trying to rest at Cedar Hill through the winter following the eight-monthChicago sojourn, by March 1894, Douglass resumed his never-ending pursuit ofjust who he was amid all the mysteries of the Eastern Shore. While his heartstill beat, the lynching crisis and the nation’s fate might wait for a moment.Douglass wrote to Benjamin F. Auld, a son of Hugh Auld, Douglass’s former owner,asking for information less about the paternity than about his accurate age. Hereminisced of going to Baltimore in 1825 to be the companion of Benjamin’sbrother, Thomas, and believed himself to have been eight years old then.Douglass wondered if Auld could help him “get some idea of my exact age.” Heremembered amusingly that he had been “big enough to bring a good sized bucketof water from the pump on Washington Street to our house.” The search continuedto the very end. “I have always been troubled by the thought of having nobirthday.” He reckoned that he was “about 77 years old,” as usual one year inerror. But in his assiduous search among possible kinfolk Douglass assuredBenjamin how “happy” he had been to be sent back to Baltimore, to his “goodhome” with Benjamin’s “good mother,” Sophia Auld, after the Anthony slaves weredivided.3 [notes02.html#epifn_3a] Douglass had to feel secure at least in hiswaning years to thus alter older versions of these traumas in his youth; theAulds now appeared in memory in soft tones. The appeal turned up no newevidence. His process of always giving shape and meaning to his life’s storyremained frustrated by his being unable to give it a fully factual beginning.Image [../images/f0747-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, in his library at Cedar Hill, c. 1893.Over his final year Douglass gave the “Lessons” speech about lynching manytimes, and he received a great deal of heartening response. So concerned was theorator about the substance of this lecture, and for his delivery style now as anelderly man, that just before first giving the address in Washington, Douglassinvited a friend, William Tunnell, up to Cedar Hill to listen to a dry run.Tunnell worked as a kind of press agent for the speech, visiting the WashingtonPost and other papers, drumming up “sympathy and interest” as well as“influential circulation.” Since his first days on the North Star in the 1840s,Douglass’s career had been in some form a marketing operation. Ida Wells alsotried to sell copies of the “Lessons” speech during her second tour of England.The day after the performance in Washington at Metropolitan AME in January 1894,a worker at the Record and Pensions Bureau of the War Department, AlfredAnderson, wrote to say that it was “all the topic of conversation” around hisoffice. He believed he had just read the “great Negro Gladstone of America.”Patients gathered in the District of Columbia Homeopathic Hospital to read thespeech and begged Douglass to come visit them. Some people wrote just to tellDouglass that their entire families were discussing the speech, including theirchildren. His granddaughter Estelle Sprague wrote to tell Douglass that at theschool in which she taught in Virginia the entire student body gathered on aSunday to listen to the young teacher read aloud her famous grandfather’sspeech.4 [notes02.html#epifn_4a] Could an old man still living by his voice everreceive better affirmations?Gratified, Douglass had produced for the violent and depression-ridden 1890s oneof his best efforts, and it led to endless invitations from churches, clubs,schools, and colleges to speak all across the nation. He had named the problembrilliantly and laid a dagger once again into the nation’s moral heart. Thedisruptive, disturbing prophet of justice was back on his game. In 1893, blacksin Kansas wanted Douglass to come on Emancipation Day, September 22, and a civicclub in Nebraska wanted him for a similar event on January 1, 1894. Some all butdemanded that he come support their schools or communities, such as a blackchurch in Baltimore that audaciously asked, “Will not he who has reachedtranscendent eminence remember the rock from which he was hewn?” His friendskept warning him about all the “self-seeking” in the world that weighed himdown, but the unknown and intimately known kept beseeching him to go speak,including Susan B. Anthony and his daughter Rosetta. As the “venerable chieftainof the race,” so called by the leaders of a Baptist church in West Virginia,Douglass took in the cascade of invitations. He accepted too many. “Though I amno longer young and begin to feel the touch of time and toil,” he admitted to afriend in May 1894, “I spend much of my time in traveling and speaking.” Herejoiced in reporting that he had just addressed an audience of two thousand inBoston about lynching.5 [notes02.html#epifn_5a]• • •Fame further meant that Douglass remained the target of never-ending requestsfor money. Begging letters poured into Cedar Hill from unknown people, friends,and family members. The family was constantly a draw on the patriarch’s bankaccounts and emotions. The handsome grandson-in-law Charles Morris became awanderer after his wife’s death, as well as a frequent correspondent in need ofmoney. Douglass’s generosity was remarkable, but sometimes he expressed anger athow some kinfolk squandered his largess. He considered the $200 advanced toCharles to pay for his wife’s funeral “as so much taken out of my pocket forwhich no note or written acknowledgement was given.” Douglass chastised hisgrandson-in-law, who had apparently lost the money: “There is nothing thatseparates people more widely than the failure to pay honest debts.” On the morepositive side of the ledger, the grandfather lovingly supported Joseph,Charles’s son and the violin prodigy, in his musical education and tours.6[notes02.html#epifn_6a]Four granddaughters, all Rosetta’s children, worked or taught at black schoolsor in a federal agency: Annie in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, Hattie at theFlorida Baptist Academy, Estelle at the Gloucester County School in Virginia,and Fredericka at the Recorder of Deeds Office in Washington. Hattie wrote inMarch 1894 thanking her grandfather profusely for the $15 that had just arrived.She would have borrowed it from Uncle Lewis, she said, but “both Estelle andFredericka had borrowed same from him.” Trying to step out independently intothe work world, these young women surely had their mother’s moral support, butcould not rely upon their father, Nathan Sprague, who was still a personal andfinancial embarrassment to the elder Douglass. In January 1894, a coal dealerwrote to Douglass complaining of a debt owed him by Nathan. After many excusesand being rejected at the Spragues’ doorstep, the coal provider wrote to CedarHill, “For forty years I have known and honored Mr. Douglass and I regret that Iam compelled to think less of a member of his family.”7 [notes02.html#epifn_7a]As always, Douglass mostly suppressed his anger and absorbed these woesstoically.To some extent, Douglass had joined a donor class. He gave money to variousblack schools, colleges, and churches, including to Tuskegee Institute, where hehelped Booker Washington by enlisting old abolitionist friends to donate aswell. He donated more than his speaking fee to Metropolitan AME Church shortlyafter he delivered the “Lessons” address there in January 1894. He sometimesanswered money requests from ordinary people with checks for small amounts. Ayoung black portrait artist in Illinois enlisted a friend to write to the “greatchieftain among the Negroes,” asking to paint his portrait for a fee. Atwelve-year-old boy in North Carolina did the same in sending his crayon drawingof the famous man. Douglass sent a $15 payment to a carpenter in South Carolinawho made him a cane and then promptly asked for more money for personal support.An “orphan boy” who was “born free” in Georgia had three more terms in schooland demanded, “Oh! kind sir, please do not deny me. Help me all you can.”Moreover, good friends, old and young, begged Douglass for support. EbenezerBassett, down on his luck in the depression of 1894 and looking for work, was“far from giving up on the race of life,” but deeply stressed at the debts healready owed Douglass. The desperate young poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, who couldnot find work in Ohio, reported himself “well in body but not in mind”; heneeded help sustaining his reputation and begged for “rescue.” Douglass’scollaborator on the Chicago World’s Fair book I. Garland Penn, his situation“urgent,” appealed openly for funds.8 [notes02.html#epifn_8a] Hard times causedawkward letters, strained friendships, and endless decisions on whom or what tosupport.All was not stress and strain, however, in Douglass’s life during his finalyear. From May through October 1894 in at least three cities—Boston and NewBedford, Massachusetts, and Flemington, New Jersey—he sat for some endearingphotographs. They included beautiful pictures of the patriarch with grandsonJoseph (violin in hand), and with his grandson-in-law Charles Morris, standingwith a hand on the old man’s shoulder. They also include the splendid images ofa sitting, and portly, Douglass, and two exquisite views of the great wise face,crowned with white mane, and in one of them, smiling. In one image from May, byDenis Bourdon of Boston, the eyes almost gleam with an old fire and he seemsabout to utter an oracle. In a second, from October, by Phineas Headley Jr. andJames Reed of New Bedford, Douglass seems about to grin his way into an amusingstory. For nearly fifty years he had been photographed more than any otherAmerican of the nineteenth century. The old radical was going out with a gentlesmile.9 [notes02.html#epifn_9a]Moreover, Douglass enjoyed the deep love and companionship of his wife, Helen;no amount of public hostility ever seems to have damaged their genuine mutualaffection. Near the end of his long stay in Chicago, she wrote to him confessingthat she felt “awfully lonesome” without him. Their mutual tenderness floweredin letters. “If I could take your cold and your perplexities I would do so,”Helen confided. “May God in heaven keep you and bring you safely home, and mayyour spoken word be like winged arrows.” Helen also wrote of her husband toother prominent people, demonstrating not only her unconditional devotion, but acertain savvy ability in promoting his image. To a New York minister who hadjust delivered a sermon on Douglass, Helen wrote in January 1895 describing theorator as a “witness against a nation . . . the shining angel of truth by whoseside I believe he was born, and by whose side he unflinchingly walked throughlife.” Helen’s perception of her husband became deeply religious, prophetic byany measure of the era. In March 1895, just after returning from Douglass’sfuneral in Rochester, she would write to Francis Grimké, the friend who hadmarried them and who had written an extraordinary eulogy-essay. Helen wroterevealingly, “I used to tell Mr. Douglass that nothing in his later life was tome more wonderful than his character as a child, and it does seem as if theflaming sword of an archangel had been about him from his birth to his death.”10[notes02.html#epifn_10a] Like few others, Helen had taken on the role ofcustodian of the legacy. In domestic terms, Douglass was a lucky man; with Helenhe had found a stable intellectual and spiritual partner.Image [../images/f0750-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass, New Bedford, Massachusetts, October 31, 1894. Phineas C.Headley Jr. and James E. Reed photographers.The old radical also became somewhat of an art patron. In spring 1894 hecombined with a wealthier friend to buy the painter Henry Ossawa Tanner’s TheBagpipe Lesson for the library at Hampton Institute in Virginia. Douglass lovednot only music and art, but also modern technologies. In that last spring of hislife, one evening he visited a friend, “Mr. Anderson,” at his home to listen forthe first time to a phonograph. Douglass’s fascination with modernity neverabated. He declared himself “amazed and wonderstruck” as he “heard coming out ofthat trumpet the voice and clear cut sentences of my friend Isaiah Wear”(probably Isaiah C. Wears, prominent black orator from Philadelphia). Douglasswrote a letter of gratitude and profound delight: “The phonograph brought menearest to a sense of divine creative power than anything I ever witnessedbefore. It raises the question as to the boundary of the human soul, thedividing line between the finite and the infinite.” Douglass’s reaction to thismachine revealed much about himself. He found “something solemn in the thoughtthat though being dead and turned to dust a man’s voice may yet live and speak.”His reaction was genuinely spiritual: “I feel somewhat over this instrument inyour hand as a man feels when he embraces religion.” The “faces and forms of ourdeparted” were important; but “this thing makes us hear their voices.”11[notes02.html#epifn_11a] We have no evidence that Douglass was ever recorded ona phonograph. But he desired nothing more than that his spoken and written voicewould survive infinitely for humankind. Survive it did by other means.• • •On February 20, 1895, a destitute African American named Lucius Harrod wrote tothe Sage of Anacostia from just down the road in Hillsdale. Harrod was feeble,in ill health, and had not worked since 1888. He had no coal for heating fuel inthe winter. “I am poor and needy, yet the Lord thinketh upon me,” he wrote,directly quoting Psalm 40:17 to the great man up on the hill. “If you can do meany good in whatever way.” The letter included at bottom a PS: “Often read 32ndch. Isaiah, 2nd v of your 1862 July.” Harrod may have remembered a Douglassspeech he had read that included the Isaiah passage, but on this day of alldays, to reference Isaiah, which Douglass had done so many times himself, givesa special poignancy to the moment: “And a man shall be as a hiding place fromthe wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, asthe shadow of a great rock in a weary land.”12 [notes02.html#epifn_12a] Harrodhad no idea he had suggested an apt epitaph for the man whose aid he sought.At approximately 7:00 p.m. that evening, at age seventy-seven, Douglass fell tothe floor in the front hallway of Cedar Hill, dead from an apparent heartattack. He first fell slowly to his knees, then spread out on the floor. HelenDouglass was at his side, alone. She went to the front door and cried for help.In a short while a doctor, J. Stewart Harrison, was at the stricken man’s sideand pronounced him dead. The man of millions of words had gone cold and silent.He was scheduled to give a lecture that evening in a local black church inHillsdale, and the carriage arrived just as he fell dead. Lucius Harrod neverreceived a reply as he searched for a covert that winter from his travail.13[notes02.html#epifn_13a] Douglass’s joyous and turbulent tempest was over.That morning, February 20, Frederick and Helen had taken a carriage down intothe middle of Washington. Helen went to the Library of Congress while Douglassattended for most of the day the meeting of the National Council of Women atMetzerott Hall on Pennsylvania Avenue (at the location of today’s FBI Building).May Wright Sewall presided, and Douglass sat on the platform next to his oldfriend Susan B. Anthony. Douglass seemed in good health through the day amongthe fifty delegates, although one woman later reported that he continuallyrubbed his left hand as though it were “benumbed.” He did not make an address.He returned home to Cedar Hill around 5:00 p.m. The news of his death spreadrapidly through Washington that evening and across the country. At the Women’sCouncil meeting that evening Sewall announced that Douglass had died. Anthony,in agony, could not continue. The next day, with bitter opposition from Southernmembers, the US Senate passed a resolution, 32–25, to adjourn out of respect forDouglass.14 [notes02.html#epifn_14a]Within four days funeral preparations had been completed. On February 25, thememorial for Douglass was primarily a black-Washington solemn tribute to itsmost famous resident. After a small family service at Cedar Hill ahearse-carriage transported the oak casket down into the city to MetropolitanAME Church, where Douglass not only had been a member but had delivered so manymemorable addresses. A huge mixed-race crowd gathered at the church early in themorning. Between 9:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. that day throngs of people processed bythe casket, in one side of the edifice and out the other. “Quiet and orderly,”reported the Washington Post, the young and old, black and white, passed aroundthe funeral bier. Lewis and Charles were conspicuous in organizing theprocession. The church groaned to capacity, and during the nearly four-hourservice to follow, “thousands” more waited and milled around outside. Fivehundred seats inside were reserved, and a “wild rush” occurred for the rest ofthe pews when the signal came. Actress, lecturer, and journalist Kate Fieldattended the service. She marveled at the mixture at Douglass’s funeral of thefamous and the ordinary, even if the speeches were much too long. She watched“the Moses of the black race” honored in death.15 [notes02.html#epifn_15a]Four members of the black Sons of Veterans stood, two at either end of thecoffin, as honor guards throughout the ceremony. The actual pallbearersconsisted of twelve men in uniform from the “colored letter carriers” of theCity of Washington. Among the honorary pallbearers were a who’s who of blackWashington, including former senator Blanche Bruce, former congressman JohnLynch, hotel entrepreneur W. H. A. Wormley, and Douglass’s old friend CharlesPurvis. Senator John Sherman as well as Supreme Court justice John MarshallHarlan also attended the service. A Boston singer, Moses Hodges, sangMendelssohn’s “O Rest in the Lord,” and John Hutchinson, a survivor of thefamous abolitionist Hutchinson Family Singers, who had many times appeared withDouglass, sang and chanted “Dirge for a Soldier”: “Lay him low, lay him low /Under the grasses or under the snow; / What cares he? He cannot know. / Lay himlow, lay him low.”16 [notes02.html#epifn_16a]Among the many sermons and eulogies was one biblical tribute by the whitepresident of Howard University, the Reverend J. E. Rankin. Rankin knew hisaudience. He preached on Psalm 105:17–19: “He sent a man before them. He wassold for a servant. His feet they hurt with fetters. He was laid in chains ofiron. Until the time when his word came to pass, the word of the Lord triedhim.” Rankin likened the youthful Douglass to the Dante of the Inferno, a manwho had been to hell to find righteousness. Like other eulogists Rankin stressedthe “wonderful contrasts and antitheses” of the deceased’s life. He also pointedto the theme of forgiveness in how Douglass had searched to know hisslaveholding kinfolk. Those close to the altar would have noticed that among theflower displays was one from the Auld family. But Rankin framed his sermon withthe story of young Douglass’s many sessions with the Baltimore preacher “UncleLawson.” Helen likely approved of Rankin’s theme of how the old preacher hadshowed the teenager “how God was girding him for that day when he was to go townto town, from state to state, a flaming herald of righteousness; to crossoceans . . . lifting up the great clarion voice, which no one who ever heard canforget.” This was funeral rhetoric, but who could resist the story of the orphanslave who would be king of abolitionism?17 [notes02.html#epifn_17a]The casket was taken through the streets of Washington, guarded by a contingentof 150 black Grand Army of the Republic veterans, to the train station, where itdeparted at 7:00 p.m. for New York City. From Grand Central Terminal the casketwas taken downtown to City Hall early in the morning of the twenty-sixth. Therethe next morning in City Hall, where both Lincoln and Ulysses Grant had lain instate, Douglass too received such an honor for two hours. From 8:00 to 10:00a.m. a long winding line of New Yorkers viewed Douglass’s remains in the hall’svestibule. Promptly the New York stop ended, and soon the casket and family wereon the train again across New York State to Rochester.18[notes02.html#epifn_18a]All business and upper grades of schools were suspended in Rochester on the dayof Douglass’s burial, February 27. Huge crowds gathered around City Hall, drapedin black bunting and American flags, as the body arrived, escorted by theleaders of a local “Douglass League.” At Central Church, the largest in thecity, eulogies were offered by the Reverends H. H. Stebbins and W. R. Taylor. Amale quartet sang “Hide Thou Me,” and the organist struck up the old spiritual“Swing Low, Sweet Chariot.” A “surging mass of people,” said the New YorkTribune, surrounded the church and the streets during the three hours of publicviewing. Accompanying Douglass’s body to Rochester were Helen, sons Lewis andCharles, Rosetta and two of her daughters, Estelle and Harriet, and the grandsonJoseph. Nathan Sprague apparently did not attend. After the church service inthe afternoon, dozens of carriages followed the hearse out to Mount HopeCemetery, and on a gentle hillside Douglass was laid to rest in the winterlandscape. A year later, Lewis and Charles had their mother, Anna Douglass,reinterred from Graceland Cemetery in Washington, DC, to Rochester; she isburied between Frederick and their daughter Annie. The three living children hadmany years of memories associated with Rochester, some cherished and someanguished. It had never been Helen’s home. In a short time Lewis, perhaps withsome help from Charles, would paste dozens of newspaper obituaries and eulogiesabout their father into a scrapbook. Among them was one from a Californiagathering at which Ida Wells gave the eulogy, and a newspaper report claimingthat each son had received a $50,000 inheritance. The battle over Douglass’sestate, his will, and for Cedar Hill itself had only begun.19[notes02.html#epifn_19a] On this day, though, a nation and even other parts ofthe world thought of inheritances of other kinds from the man who had left somuch to contemplate with his voice, his pen, and his vote.• • •In countless speeches and in the autobiographies, Douglass had imposed himselfon so many who would attempt his eulogy. As early as the very next day, longobituaries and tributes appeared in newspapers across the country. He was the“self-made” American who had conquered the greatest odds, the man of mixed racebut in some ways of no race, the “serf” who had risen to the unrivaled“intellectual standard” of his people, the stunning physical presence—one of themost recognizable persons in the nation. Many eulogies drew deeply from thememoirs and recited actual scenes from Douglass’s life. The story was ready andwaiting, and Americans in the age of Horatio Alger loved the tale, or perhapsespecially needed it in a time when fiends with lynching ropes and torchesstalked black men of lesser fame, as well as a time when banks failedeverywhere, savings accounts vanished, and economic failure hounded millions.“His history has often been told,” said the Brooklyn Eagle, as it also declaredDouglass “thrice an American . . . in his veins ran the blood of threeraces . . . the Indian, the white man, and the Negro.” Other eulogies played outthis fascination with the orator’s race. The New York Times announced withcertainty that Douglass’s “white blood” explained his “remarkable energy” and“superior intelligence.” A paper in Rome, New York, characterized him as the“most picturesque” of Americans, and his rare ability it attributed to that he“was almost a white man.”20 [notes02.html#epifn_20a]But at the center of most eulogies stood the slave who had conquered chattelbondage, this most notorious of American fates. “Sweet are the uses ofadversity,” rhapsodized the Eagle. “It is the north wind that toughens the oak,not the caressing breezes of the south.” And the New York Tribune instructed itsreaders that Douglass “became the representative man of his race . . . by virtueof self-help . . . [and] self-education.” Douglass’s death inspired loftylanguage, North and South. The “world’s greatest Negro” had died, said aSpringfield, Illinois, paper, and in a Norfolk, Virginia, journal the “greatestman of African descent this century has seen” passed on. The Washington Stardeclared the passing era the “Douglassian age” and compared the deceased assymbol to the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor. Exuberant eulogists comparedthe fallen statesman and man of letters to Gladstone and Bismarck, Goethe andSchiller, Emerson and Victor Hugo.21 [notes02.html#epifn_21a]Eulogies also took on odd, mixed forms. Some papers competed with claims ofpossessing the last letter Douglass wrote. Some groups, such as a gathering ofblack Methodist preachers in Richmond, decided it would be too time-consuming toconduct a major memorial for Douglass, who had appeared in so many of theirpulpits, since three to four such “men of genius” now came along every year.Some papers reprinted from other sources the claim, without evidence, thatDouglass was worth $300,000 at his death. Many press reports from the whiteSouth were anything but mournful. The Wilmington, North Carolina, Messengermocked blacks for being “anxious that Congress should prostitute itself like theRadical Legislature—by allowing the remains of Fred Douglass ‘to lie in state’in the national capital. Why . . . what has he done to merit such attentions?”This paper dismissed the deceased as a “stirrer up of bad blood and a verydiligent Government teat holder and sucker, and enemy of the South.” The NorthCarolinian editor cultivated common public racism by urging “white facedfellows” never to “feel that they are no better than Sambo and Cuffee.” AnOshkosh, Wisconsin, account, otherwise laudatory, could not resist pointing outthat Douglass had caused “serious detraction” for his reputation by the“unnatural step” of marrying a white woman. But a Milwaukee paper quicklypointed out that Frederick Bailey’s owner had taken a black woman as his“consort” to give birth to the man in question. The New Orleans Picayune triedto acknowledge Douglass as the “most eminent” man of his race, but since he wasa “half-breed,” he could never be the group’s exemplar.22[notes02.html#epifn_22a] In Douglass, living and dead, Americans found a personaaround which to exhibit some of their worst prejudices. But it is equallystunning how much of the country seemed to know his story.All kinds of reminiscences flowed from articles and public memorials by peoplewho had heard Douglass speak. Someone in every town seemed to claim thatdistinction. Douglass could be a man for all tastes and seasons. A Washington,DC, account admired how his “intellectuality” grew from an early “fanaticism” tomore “conservative” positions. A journalist named Charles T. Congdon rememberedhearing Douglass engage a hostile audience from an abolitionist platform in NewBedford. As an anti-abolitionist heckler “hissed,” the young orator pointed atthe offender and launched into a paraphrase of Genesis 3:14—“I told you so. Uponthy belly shalt thou go, dust shalt thou eat, and hiss all the days of thylife.” In these tellings the hecklers always shut up in the face of Douglass’smoral and verbal power. Some reminiscences relished stories of the great man’sgrace and humor. The Boston Transcript repeated the oft told tale of howDouglass so often ended up sitting alone on railcars, since no one would takethe seat next to the black man. “ ‘You are occupying an entire seat,’ complaineda patron. ‘I know that,’ said Mr. Douglass. ‘Well, what right have you to it?’exclaimed the man. ‘Because I am a nigger,’ returned Douglass. ‘That don’t giveyou a right to two seats,’ said the man—and Mr. Douglass made room for him.”Douglass thus received credit for laughing at and changing racial habits.23[notes02.html#epifn_23a]Above all, blacks in communities all across the land, in the South and the farWest, as well as the North, held meetings of tribute to Douglass, often passinglocal resolutions of honor and gratitude. The Assembly Club of San Franciscosent a list of typed resolutions to Lewis Douglass and the family. Within a weekand a half of the death a gathering in Sumter County, Georgia, produced ten suchresolutions. One large meeting in Atlanta rocked with “protests” against racismand violence, while another in Tuskegee came off with propriety and good order.At the Atlanta gathering, Charles Morris, the grandson-in-law, delivered aeulogy devoted to the crisis of Jim Crow railway cars and got carried away,comparing Douglass to Jesus Christ. The black Cleveland Gazette announced asimple truth exhibited during the months of Douglass commemorations: “His lifeand work has been public property almost since the day of his birth. . . . Therace will miss him more than it can at this time realize.”24[notes02.html#epifn_24a]But Douglass was not gone; he was merely dead. New geniuses were, indeed, comingalong, and two of them would utter important speeches, albeit one famous and theother obscure, that very year. Booker Washington later that fall delivered hispivotal public address, often called the “Atlanta Compromise,” at the CottonStates Exhibition. In it he called for acommodation by blacks with certainelements of white supremacy and Jim Crow in exchange for industrial educationand social security. Washington would to a degree trade disfranchisement andsegregation for racial peace and economic opportunity.25[notes02.html#epifn_25a] Although never sharing Washington’s acquiescence withJim Crow or any diminution of the right to vote, Douglass had long prefiguredthe Wizard of Tuskegee on the philosophy of self-reliance.On March 9 in Wilberforce, Ohio, W. E. B. Du Bois, a twenty-seven-year-oldprofessor at the black college, just returned the previous year from hisextraordinary educational sojourn in Germany, gave a short, remarkable speech,“Douglass as a Statesman.” In his eulogy the Massachusetts-born andHarvard-educated Du Bois urged students and faculty not to cry out in “halftriumphant sadness” at the death of their leader, but to engage in “carefulconscientious emulation.” Du Bois remembered Douglass’s leadership inabolitionism, in the recruiting of black soldiers in the war, in the achievementof black male suffrage, and in civil rights. As a leader Douglass had reachedfor goals considered “dangerous” and all but “impossible.” He was not afraid ofthe American “experiment in citizenship.” Douglass had proven himself a “builderof the state” largely from outside traditional power. “Our Douglass,” assertedthe young intellectual, was the man of the race, but he had also “stood outsidemere race lines . . . upon the broad basis of humanity.” It had been Du Bois’smanner of thought and ambition to say whenever possible that history should makeway now for a humane, learned race man much like himself.26[notes02.html#epifn_26a] He seemed to understand and admire Douglass’s work andpersona enough to make the model in part his own.At the end of his speech, Du Bois offered a brief but remarkable anecdote: “Thefirst and last time I saw Douglass, he lectured on Hayti and the Haytians andhere again he took a position worthy of his life and reputation.” Du Boishonored Douglass for choosing principle over diplomacy in regard to seizure ofHaitian territory when he had served as US minister. Du Bois pushed hard on theirony: “To steal a book is theft, but to steal an island is missionaryenterprise.” Du Bois the graduate student was in Berlin all of 1893 andtherefore did not witness the Chicago Haiti speeches. It is likely, then, thatDu Bois heard Douglass speak in Boston at Tremont Temple on March 16, 1892,before the younger man departed for Germany. According to the Boston press,Douglass did indeed speak that night on Haiti and the Haitians to a full house.Du Bois needed to claim Douglass, to own the mantle, to join the national chorusof those older than him who saw Douglass. The old abolitionist had fought the“preliminaries . . . for us,” said the brilliant new voice, “but the main battlehe has left for us.” We cannot know whether the fresh-faced Du Bois had felt inawe of what a Boston reporter called Douglass’s “manly bearing” on the TremontTemple stage with his “thick whitening hair brushed back from his forehead, andhis eye as keen and brain as clear as ever.” But Du Bois no doubt joined the“rounds of applause” when the venerable orator announced himself “a friend toHaiti. . . . I say I am a friend to any people who have known the yoke ofslavery as I have.”27 [notes02.html#epifn_27a] Few people ever awed Du Bois; butDouglass may have been one of them.Du Bois knew his Douglass well enough that only a few years later as he craftedthe lyrical history in his masterpiece, The Souls of Black Folk, a reader canfeel and almost hear Douglass’s words informing the text. In his chapter onBooker T. Washington, Du Bois pays an homage to Douglass, saying that the formerabolitionist, “in his old age, still bravely stood for the ideals of his earlymanhood” and had “passed away in his prime.” In the famous second chapter ofSouls, “Of the Dawn of Freedom,” a vivid, polemical account of Reconstruction,the author offered what many scholars have come to consider a “Du Boisian” formof history. His biographer David Levering Lewis calls this Du Bois’s“signature,” the compression of huge pieces of history and human aspiration intosingle paragraphs, images, or metaphors.28 [notes02.html#epifn_28a]The brooding ending of “Dawn of Freedom” argues that for America to find itssoul, it had to free the slaves and now continue freeing the slaves’ “children’schildren.” “I have seen a land right merry with the sun. . . .” Du Bois wrote,“and there in the King’s Highway . . . sits a figure veiled and bowed, by whichthe traveller’s footsteps hasten as they go. On the tainted air broods fear.Three centuries’ thought has been the raising and unveiling of that bowed humanheart, and now behold a century new for the duty and the deed. The problem ofthe Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.” Significantly thistragic ending is placed between two chapters in Souls that end with ringingappeals to the first principles of the Declaration of Independence. Du Bois’shistory is a prophetic demand upon the creeds of a forgetful country. In thenineteenth century, no one had laid down that prophetic demand quite likeDouglass, and Du Bois knew it.29 [notes02.html#epifn_29a] Du Boisian history wasfirst Douglassonian history: the problem of the nineteenth century had been theproblem of slavery, revealed and written in thousands of pages and spoken fromcountless platforms by the fugitive from the Tuckahoe. Douglass had seen to itthat his story had always provided a “raising and an unveiling”—by propheticwitness, through scars, pain, anger, unforgettable metaphors, and patriotictriumphs.Douglass had long offered himself as Du Bois’s “figure veiled and bowed” alongthe highway, yet one who stood up to preach a “sacrilegious irony” about thecrimes of the nation, as he put it in the Fourth of July speech. In Douglass’sgreat orations of the 1850s, the air also hung tainted with a fear perhaps evengreater than Du Bois imagined for the turn of the twentieth century. Just afterplacing his people in the midst of the ancient Hebrews’ Bablylonian Captivity,Douglass announced the essential theme of his life: “My subject, then,fellow-citizens, is AMERICAN SLAVERY.” And so it always was. The abolitionistfilled the tainted air with jeremiadic words and sounds. He heard the “mournfulwail of millions! whose chains” clanked “heavy and grievious.” Throughout hisfifty years of oratory and writing, Douglass had employed all manner of bloodmetaphors for the nature of African American history, none more often than theline used yet again in his Haiti speeches, which Du Bois heard: the history ofblack people “might be traced, like a wounded man through a crowd, by theblood.” Douglass had been the man bowed by the roadside, with a trail of blood,but then the risen slave, the free man and voice, telling the nation a historyit did not wish to hear. He told it all over again in the lynching crisis of the1890s. “My language . . . is less bitter than my experience,” he announced in an1853 address. “I am alike familiar with the whip and the chain of slavery, andthe lash and the sting of public neglect and scorn.” Speaking for the bowedfigure, he argued that slavery had always “shot its leprous distilment throughthe life-blood of the nation.” It had always “intended to put thorns under feetalready bleeding, to crush a people already bowed down.”30[notes02.html#epifn_30a] Hundreds of thousands of people across the nineteenthcentury had witnessed or read Douglass’s story of the risen figure from the sideof the road. He had striven to be both a prophet of doom and of redemption.When Douglass died, Du Bois wrote a private poem he called “The Passing ofDouglass.” He etched the date, “20 February, 1895,” and the place, “Wilberforce,Green Co., Ohio,” beneath and above his title.Then Douglass passed—his massive formStill quivering at unrightful wrong;His soul aflame, and on his lipsA tale and prophecy of waiting work.Personal, heroic, elegiac, Du Bois tried to take up a standard for the nextgeneration.Not as the sickening dying flame,That fading glows into the nightPassed our mightiest—nay, but as the watch-Warning and sending in common glory,Suddenly flocks to the Mountain, and leavesA grim and horrid blackness in the world.But amid the feeling of darkness, Du Bois made Douglass his own.Live, warm and wondrous memory, my DouglassLive, all men do love thee. . . .Rest, dark and tired soul, my Douglass,Thy God receive thee.Amen!31 [notes02.html#epifn_31a]For decades countless Americans had looked at and listened to Douglass; they hadadmired and hated him, loved, followed, envied, denounced, and tried to destroyhim. Many had tried to make him their own, to control his trajectory, even hiswords. He had been gawked at, photographed, and studied; he had won manyarguments and lost many others. People had for decades named their children forhim. Eulogies reflected this range of reactions over the decades. Similar toLincoln, Douglass offered an original American to those who sought such images;he was the sui generis former slave who found books, the boy beaten into abenumbed field hand who fought back and mastered language and wielded a KingJames–inspired prose at the world’s oppressions with a genius to behold. He wasspiritual and secular, consummately political and deeply moralistic, romanticand pragmatic, a philosopher of democracy and natural rights and a preacher of afirm doctrine of self-reliance. Douglass provided a living symbol by hisphysical presence and skill that refuted all manner of racist notions andreinforced others for the ignorant and the fearful. He rose from nowhere to thecenters of power, or so it had seemed. He loved power but found he could wieldit only with limits and often softly. He had made vanity and pride often intoweapons alongside his words; he outlasted most of his enemies, except theideology of white supremacy, which only seemed to transmogrify into morevirulent forms in his old age. Underneath Douglass’s grand dignity, deep in hissoul, ran a lode of humility born of experience and a long view of history, butembedded in that soul as well was his fierce, sometimes insecure, but oftenmagnificent quest for respect, to compete, and to conquer his foes. Embeddedthere as well were an insatiable intellectual curiosity and a spirituality thatsustained him through many trials. And so Douglass passed, but the words, andmuch more, endure.In the frightening racial climate of the mid-1890s some in the next generationof black artists and thinkers saw Douglass’s death with dark foreboding.Douglass’s young protégé Paul Dunbar viewed blacks in the 1890s as a kind ofcrucified people, and his mentor as their “guardian” prophet, the voice forever“nigh” and sounding forth over “the gale” of racism and violence. In his 1895poem, Dunbar also imagined Douglass as both a warrior and a resurrected Christfigure for the race. Whatever a prophet really is, in his grief at Douglass’sdeath, Dunbar believed blacks had lost theirs.32 [notes02.html#epifn_32a]One of the most remarkable eulogies of Douglass was delivered on March 10, 1895,in Washington by his close younger friend the Reverend Francis Grimké, thePresbyterian minister who had married Frederick and Helen. Grimké especiallydefended his friend against all claims about his “selfishness,” that the Sage ofCedar Hill had always looked out for himself and his pocketbook. No one had evergiven or sacrificed more for the race than Douglass, argued Grimké. But placedin that long address is a short, compelling anecdote about Douglass’s humanity,and especially his love of music. Three weeks before Douglass died, Grimké hadbeen at Cedar Hill for dinner. As the meal ended, “all repaired to the sittingroom,” and the old orator demanded they all sing. Grandson Joseph took the leadon the violin, and someone else played the piano. Grimké remembered poignantly,“In the singing he [Douglass] took the lead.” The guest left this unforgettableimage of the host: “Standing in the doorway between the sitting room and thehall, with violin in hand, he struck up . . . ‘In Thy cleft, O Rock of Ages,’and sang it through to the very end with a pathos that moved us all. . . . Itseemed to take hold of him so.” Grimké witnessed Douglass’s spirituality in fullforce. “I can almost hear now the deep mellow tones of his voice and feel thesolemnity that pervaded the room as he sang the words:In the sight of Jordan’s billow,Let Thy bosom be my pillow;Hide me, O Thou Rock of Ages,Safe in Thee.”Grimké felt a “kind of presentiment that the end was near, that he [Douglass]was already standing on the very brink of that Jordan over which he was soon topass.”33 [notes02.html#epifn_33a]• • •If slavery and race were the centerpieces of American history through thenineteenth century’s rise, fall, and then resurrection of the republic, no onerepresented that saga quite like Douglass. As the modern poet Robert Hayden sobeautifully put it:When it is finally ours, this freedom, this beautifuland needful thing, needful to man as air, usable as earth; when it belongs atlastto all . . . when it is finally won . . .this man, this Douglass, this former slave, this Negrobeaten to his knees, exiled, visioning a worldwhere none is hunted, alien,this man, superb in love and logic, this manshall be remembered.Oh, not with statues’ rhetoric,Not with legends and poems and wreaths of bronze alone,But with the lives grown out of his life, the livesFleshing his dream of the beautiful, needful thing.34 [notes02.html#epifn_34a]Image [../images/f0763-01.jpg]Frederick Douglass seated with grandson Joseph Douglass, who was a concertviolinist, New Bedford, Massachusetts, October 31, 1894. Phineas C. Headley Jr.and James E. Reed photographers.Douglass was the prose poet of America’s and perhaps of a universal bodypolitic; he searched for the human soul, envisioned through slavery and freedomin all their meanings. There had been no other voice quite like Douglass’s; heinspired adoration and rivalry, love and loathing. His work and his words stillwear well. What shall we make of “our Douglass” in our own time? The problem ofthe twenty-first century is still some agonizingly enduring combination oflegacies bleeding forward from slavery and color lines. Freedom in its infinitemeanings remains humanity’s most universal aspiration. Douglass’s life, andespecially his words, may forever serve as our watch-warnings in our unendingsearch for the beautiful, needful thing."},{"pageContent":"ACKNOWLEDGMENTSThis book reflects nearly a decade of research, conversations, and writing. Butsince my first book in 1989 was also on Frederick Douglass, this work is in someways the product of nearly my entire professional career.My gratitude goes to more people and institutions than I can express. I had nointention of writing a full life of Douglass until I went to Savannah, Georgia,to deliver a lecture to local teachers on Douglass’s Narrative. While there myhosts, the Georgia Historical Society, introduced me to Walter Evans, acollector extraordinaire of African American art, rare books, and manuscripts.Walter’s remarkable collection of Douglass materials is the reason I wrote thisbook. I have spent countless days and weeks doing research on the dining roomtable—at “my chair”—at the Evans house on Jones Street. To Walter and LindaEvans I have, in part, dedicated this book. I owe them this opportunity and amforever grateful for the special private access to the scrapbooks and otherdocuments, but most of all for their abiding friendship and confidence in me. Igive a special thanks as well to Stan Deaton, Todd Groce, and the staff at theGeorgia Historical Society for their many kindnesses during my Savannahsojourns.Over the years I have benefited enormously from conversations, critiques, andreadings from many scholars of Douglass and other subjects. William S. McFeelyhelped and mentored me when I really needed it, and his biography and prose arestill an inspiration. The late James Horton was as good a friend as I ever hadtelling the world our stories. I owe a great deal to Lonnie Bunch, who sees andcreates worlds while the rest of us try to help as mates on the ship. CarylPhillips is a confidant and writer like no other; he knows Douglass and shouldstill write the script. Peter Almond and I have shared perhaps more hours ofDouglass discussion and imagination than anyone. Richard Rabinowitz is anintellectual companion, fellow traveler, and theological and life adviser; Iwish I knew as much about anything as Richard does about everything. JoyceSeltzer is a legendary editor, and I count myself fortunate to have worked withher. Marsha Andrews endured and supported the writing of this book for manyyears, from Savannah to Cambridge and the Eastern Shore.For reading chapters and sending me critiques I am deeply indebted to HenryLouis Gates Jr., Lois Horton, Richard Blackett, Leigh Fought, RichardRabinowitz, John Stauffer, Zoe Trodd, Peter Almond, and Jane Coppock. All tookmore time with my writing than I deserved. Jane gave me the failsafe eye of aformer editor. To Leigh I am grateful for many shared documents andcollaborations. Thanks to Skip for his deep knowledge of Mr. D, detailed notes,and Sunday-morning emails. Lois got my attention about gender many times. Zoe’sand John’s legendary knowledge of the photographs was invaluable. No one knowstransatlantic abolitionists like Blackett. David Brion Davis’s inspiration flowsthrough this book. Four great deceased Douglass scholars have been with me fromthe beginning: Benjamin Quarles, Philip S. Foner, Dickson J. Preston, and NathanI. Huggins.All of the following had important professional and personal influence inhelping me think about and write this book: A. J. Aiséirithe, Steve Alderman,Shawn Alexander, James Basker, Ira Berlin, Celeste-Marie Bernier, W. FitzhughBrundage, Nicholas Buccola, Randall Burkett, Jeannine DeLombard, Maria Diedrich,Douglas Egerton, Eric Foner, Leslie Frost, Annette Gordon-Reed, James Grossman,Christopher Hager, Lesley Herrmann, Nzadi Keita, Peter Kunhardt, Rudy Langlais,Michael LeMahieu, Michael McManus, Uday Mehta, James Miller, Fred Morsell,Hannah-Rose Murray, Richard Newman, James Oakes, Peter Onuf, Gunther Peck, JohnPepper, James B. Stewart, Jean Strouse, James Trotman, Paul Webb, and SeanWilentz.Karin Beckett has listened and read for many years about Douglass and mytravails in pursuing him; I am forever grateful. I am thrilled that PerryBeckett loves history. My brother and sister-in-law, James Blight and JanetLang, remain my closest kin and my heroes. Richard Sewell taught me how to writewhen I first tackled Douglass.For particularly helpful theological advice on Douglass as a biblical reader andstoryteller, I am grateful to Reverend Donald Shriver, Rabbi James Ponet andElana Ponet, the late Reverend Eugene Winkler, Reverend Ally Brundige, and theReverend Doug Tanner. Many of my former graduate students have endured andcontributed to this book in ways they know. Among them are Alice Baumgartner,Christopher Bonner, Sarah Bowman, Blake Gilpin, Tiffany Hale, Andrew Horowitz,Brian Jordan, Carolee Klimchock, Jake Lundberg, Katherine Mooney, NicholeNelson, Benjamin Parten, Steven Prince, Justin Randolph, Samuel Schaffer, JamesShinn, Caitlin Verboon, Connor Williams, and Owen Williams. Katherine, thanksonce again for the detour down the Robert Penn Warren road.Several former students have provided crucial research assistance. They include:Ilan Ben-Meir, Griffin Black, Bianca Dang, Shoshana Davidoff-Gore, and IsabelSinger. Griffin has found original Douglass sources and his readings of my notesare superhuman. A very special thanks to Katharina Schmidt, lawyer andhistorian, who so expertly translated the Ottilie Assing letters for me from theold German to English. Her interpretations of Assing, in both writing and manyconversations, have been crucial to my own analysis of this complex woman.Among my supportive colleagues at Yale on the long journey of this book areElizabeth Alexander, Beverly Gage, Glenda Gilmore, Jacqueline Goldsby, JonathanHolloway, Matthew Jacobson, Naomi Lamoreaux, Edward Rugemer, Caleb Smith, RobertStepto, Laura Wexler, and John Witt. I am grateful to Tony Kronman, Robert Post,and Akhil Amar for many conversations. Jay Winter, teaching comrade and ultimatememory man, led me to a book title. I am further thankful to a series of deans,two provosts, and two Yale presidents for their support. At Yale UniversityPress I give thanks to John Donatich, Sarah Miller, and Heather Gold for pullingme in to edit Douglass’s second autobiography at just the time I needed to doit.In the Yale libraries I am grateful to many curators and archivists, especiallyNancy Kuhl, Melissa Barton, George Miles, David Gary, and William Landis. Thanksespecially to George for helping me use all the “missing issues” of Douglass’snewspaper. Many other institutions helped me with research. They include: theUniversity of Rochester Library; the American Philosophical Society; theHistorical Society of Pennsylvania; the Gilder Lehrman Collection at theNew-York Historical Society (especially Sandra Trenholm); the New York PublicLibrary; the Moorland-Spingarn Collection at Howard University; the infinitedepths of the Library of Congress; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; theMaryland Historical Society in Baltimore; the Boston Public Library; theSyracuse University Library; the University Library, Cambridge University,United Kingdom; the Whaling Museum, New Bedford, Massachusetts; the New BedfordFree Public Library; the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, Scotland; Talbot CountyArchives, Easton, Maryland; the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester,Massachusetts.To Jack McKivigan and Robin Condon at the Frederick Douglass Papers inIndianapolis, Indiana, I owe many thanks. Jack’s headnotes, and those of hismany assistants over the years, in the volumes of speeches and correspondenceare a gold mine of information. The National Park Service in New Bedford,Massachusetts, was graciously helpful. And the National Park Service curators atCedar Hill, the Frederick Douglass National Historic Site in Washington, DC,have been special partners on this book. I am deeply thankful to Ka’Mal McClarinfor the research aid, special after-hours tours, and many photographs. WithoutPembroke Herbert of Picture Research Consultants, I would never have assembledthe images in this book. Her work was beyond crucial; Pembroke is the best inthe business.My numerous visits to the Eastern Shore of Maryland have been supported by thegood people of Washington College, particularly Adam Goodheart, and especiallyby Harriette and Eric Lowery of the Frederick Douglass Honor Society, PriscillaMorris, and Tenny Sener. A special thanks to Richard and Beverly Tilghman,owners of the Wye House plantation. The Tilghmans’ hospitality, knowledge,photographs, and grace in their embrace of Douglass are truly special. Priscillahas been my angel of the Shore for local knowledge and research. The boat ridesout to the Wye House and especially up the Tuckahoe on that misty morning areunforgettable. I am thankful to a Douglass descendant on the Eastern Shore,Tarence Bailey, for a new friendship. Robert Benz of the Frederick DouglassFamily Foundation is a longtime confidant and collaborator. And a heartfeltthanks to the Douglass descendants Nettie Washington Douglass and her son, KenMorris, whose work on behalf of their famous ancestor’s legacy is exemplary. Iowe Ken a great deal for his friendship and collaborations out on the Douglasstrails.Three fellowships helped support the conception and writing of this book. I amgrateful to Jean Strouse and the Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers at theNew York Public Library for the Performing Arts; Roy Ritchie and the manybrilliant curators at the Huntington Library, especially Jenny Watts; and to mywonderful colleagues at Cambridge University in England for hosting me as thePitt Professor. Sarah Pearsall, Andrew Preston, Sarah Meer, and Tony Badger wereperfect companions. The late Michael O’Brien, as good a historian of Americanideas and the South as ever lived, was my principal host. He still inspires meby his sublime writing and for introducing me to the Tottenham Spurs.At Yale I could not function in my multiple tasks without the team at the GilderLehrman Center for the Study of Slavery, Resistance, and Abolition, of which Iam director. Dana Schaffer and David Spatz have served as associate directors,and they know how much they mean to me. Michelle Zacks currently holds thatposition and has aided and advised me on numerous aspects of finishing thisbook. She was by my side for support on the day I hit the send button. TomThurston has been a partner in taking the history of slavery to the world forthirteen wonderful years. Daniel Vieira took a photograph in this book and givesus youthful media savvy. And I cannot thank Melissa McGrath enough for all herwork at the GLC, for her joyous deep intelligence, and for making me family. TheGLC team has lived the life of this book. On York Street in New Haven,Connecticut, I robustly thank two generations of baristas at Blue State Coffee,especially Cody Whetstone.At Simon & Schuster I have been a very lucky author to work with the consummateprofessional editor, Bob Bender. His two astute line-edits of the manuscriptastonished me for their friendly toughness. And I also give warm thanks toJohanna Li, Elizabeth Gay, and Jonathan Karp for their persistent help andconfidence.My agent, Wendy Strothman, is a magnificent professional, a great friend, and myenduring source of advice and confidence.At the copyediting stage of this book I lost the best friend I ever had, and mytribute to Jeff Ferguson appears on the dedication page. I will forever try toread, think, and embrace friendship like Jeff.David W.

They also provided me with extraordinary maps, bothnineteenth century and current. On June 18–20, 2011, Priscilla took me all overTalbot and Caroline Counties, as well as out on the Wye and Tuckahoe Rivers. Mynotes are crucial to writing Douglass’s early life.21 [ch01.html#ch1fn_21] Bondage, 39–40; Preston, Young Frederick Douglass, 6.22 [ch01.html#ch1fn_22] Bondage, 42. In the year or two before finishing MyBondage and My Freedom (1855), Douglass had been reading a great deal of“natural history” and ethnography for his major address “The Claims of the NegroEthnologically Considered,” delivered at Western Reserve College, July 12, 1854.Prichard’s work was not published until 1855, but Douglass must have beenreading it as he wrote Bondage. He found the picture of Ramses in the chapter“Of the Egyptian Race,” and in the text the features of the figure are describedas “calm and dignified; the forehead is somewhat flat; the eyes are widelyseparated from each other; the nose is elevated, but with spreading nostrils;the ears are high; the lips large, broad, and turned out, with sharp edges; inwhich points there is a deviation from the European countenance.” Douglassdenounced the racism at the core of most natural-history writing in those years,yet in the autobiography he attributed his skill with words “not to my admittedAnglo-Saxon paternity,” but to his black (and vaguely Egyptian) mother. SeeJames Cowles Prichard, The Natural History of Man: Inquiries into the ModifyingInfluence of Physical and Moral Agencies on the Different Tribes of the HumanFamily (London: H. Baillieer, 1855), 143. At the top of the following page arethree images, “painted in fresco,” that appear to be particularly attractiveEgyptian women; it is possible this affected Douglass’s use of the imagestogether to remember his mother.23 [ch01.html#ch1fn_23] Preston, Young Frederick Douglass, 62–64; Bondage,44–45.24 [ch01.html#ch1fn_24] Bondage, 45–46.25 [ch01.html#ch1fn_25] Narrative, 42; Bondage, 42, 46; Frederick Douglass,Life and Times of Frederick Douglass (1881; repr., New York: Collier, 1962), 29.See Preston, Young Frederick Douglass, 23.

Theidentities and numbers of fugitive slaves are difficult to determine. Towndirectories and censuses recorded blacks, but rarely determined whether theywere fugitives. Grover cites white abolitionists who put the total of fugitivesin New Bedford at 300–700 between 1845 and 1863. Grover found the names orlocations of some 170 in her study. Because fugitives tended to dominate theblack population, it was predominantly male. The 12,354 residents in New Bedfordin 1839 included 709 black males and 342 black females.

But there is little reason for Douglass to assume Harriet wouldknow that tune. It just as easily could have been some variation on the biblicalstory Genesis 24:60–63. “And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou artour sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seedpossess the gate of those which hate them. / And Rebekah arose, and her damsels,and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant tookRebekah, and went his way. / And Isaac came from the way of the well La-hai-roi;for he dwelt in the south country. / And Isaac went out to meditate in the fieldat the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camelswere coming.” Also see John Stauffer, The Black Hearts of Men: RadicalAbolitionists and the Transformation of Race (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UniversityPress, 2002), 159–60.

In McFeely,Frederick Douglass, 197–98, the author mistakenly adds one more piece of dramato Douglass’s presence in Philadelphia. In Life and Times, Douglass (much laterin the book than his coverage of the Harpers Ferry revelations) describesreceiving a note following a speech at National Hall in Philadelphia, informinghim that a Mrs. Amanda Auld Sears had been in the audience. She was the daughterof Douglass’s former owners, Thomas and Lucretia Auld. Amanda and Frederick hadnot seen each other since childhood, and Douglass tells of their emotionalreunion a full day after his speech, and of how Amanda had forgiven any harshelements of the author’s representations of her father. McFeely portraysDouglass as staying nearly two extra days in the city before fleeing for hislife northward. Maria Diedrich, in Love across Color Lines, 216–17, picked upthe story from McFeely and made it part of her narrative as well. Douglass spokeat National Hall, Philadelphia, at least two other times, January 14, 1862, andJuly 6, 1863. This first reunion with Amanda Sears could not have occurred inOctober of 1859, given how hurriedly Douglass fled the city.
