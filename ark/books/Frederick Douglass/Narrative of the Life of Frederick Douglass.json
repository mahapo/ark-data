O, yea! O, yea! O!(page 25)I have sometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs [of the slaves]would do more to impress some minds with the horrible character of slavery, thanthe reading of whole volumes of philosophy on the subject could do.... To thosesongs I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character ofslavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, todeepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds.(page 26)From my earliest recollection, I date the entertainment of a deep convictionthat slavery would not always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and inthe darkest hours of my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spiritof hope departed not from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer methrough the gloom.(page 39)There were horses and men, cattle and women, pigs and children, all holding thesame rank in the scale of being, and were all subjected to the same narrowexamination. Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth, maids and matrons, had toundergo the same indelicate inspection. At this moment, I saw more clearly thanever the brutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder.(page 49)I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, myintellect languished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark thatlingered about my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; andbehold a man transformed into a brute! (page 63)You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave was made aman. (page 64)My long-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place;and I now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the dayhad passed forever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let itbe known of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, mustalso succeed in killing me. (page 69)I assert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere coveringfor the most horrid crimes,—a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,—asanctifier of the most hateful frauds,—and a dark shelter under, which thedarkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find thestrongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, nextto that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master thegreatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slaveholders with whom I haveever met, religious slaveholders are the worst.

He became a leading abolitionist and women’s rights advocate andone of the most influential public speakers and writers of the nineteenthcentury.Frederick’s mother, Harriet Bailey, was a slave; his father was rumored to beAaron Anthony, manager for the large Lloyd plantation in St. Michaels, Maryland,and his mother’s master. Frederick lived away from the plantation with hisgrandparents, Isaac and Betsey Bailey, until he was six years old, when he wassent to work for Anthony.When Frederick was eight, he was sent to Baltimore as a houseboy for Hugh Auld,a shipbuilder related to the Anthony family through marriage. Auld’s wife,Sophia, began teaching Frederick to read, but Auld, who believed that a literateslave was a dangerous slave, stopped the lessons. From that point on, Frederickviewed education and knowledge as a path to freedom. He continued teachinghimself to read; in 1831 he bought a copy of The Columbian Orator, an anthologyof great speeches, which he studied closely.In 1833 Frederick was sent from Auld’s relatively peaceful home back to St.Michaels to work in the fields. He was soon hired out to Edward Covey, anotorious “slave-breaker” who beat him brutally in an effort to crush his will.However, on an August afternoon in 1834, Frederick stood up to Covey and beathim in a fight. This was a turning point, Douglass has said, in his life as aslave; the experience reawakened his desire and drive for liberty.After a failed escape attempt, Frederick was sent back to Baltimore, where heagain worked for Hugh Auld, this time as a ship caulker. In Baltimore he met andfell in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman.In 1838 Frederick Bailey escaped from slavery by using the papers of a freeseaman. He traveled north to New York City, where Anna Murray soon joined him.Later that year, Frederick and Anna married and moved to New Bedford,Massachusetts. Though settled in the North, Frederick was a fugitive,technically still Auld’s property. To protect himself, he became FrederickDouglass, a name inspired by a character in Sir Walter Scott’s poem Lady of theLake.Douglass began speaking against slavery at abolitionist meetings and soon gaineda reputation as a brilliant orator. In 1841 he began working full-time as anabolitionist lecturer, touring with one of the leading activists of the day,William Lloyd Garrison.Douglass published his first autobiography, Narrative of the Life of FrederickDouglass, an American Slave, in 1845. The book became an immediate sensation andwas widely read both in America and abroad. Its publication, however,jeopardized his freedom by exposing his true identity. To avoid capture as afugitive slave, Douglass spent the next several years touring and speaking inEngland and Ireland. In 1846 two friends purchased his freedom. Douglassreturned to America, an internationally renowned abolitionist and orator.Douglass addressed the first Women’s Rights Convention in Seneca Falls, NewYork, in 1848. This began his long association with the women’s rights movement,including friendships with such well-known suffragists as Susan B. Anthony andElizabeth Cady Stanton.During the mid-1840s Douglass began to break ideologically from William LloydGarrison. Whereas Garrison’s abolitionist sentiments were based in moralexhortation, Douglass was coming to believe that change would occur throughpolitical means. He became increasingly involved in antislavery politics withthe Liberty and Free-Soil Parties. In 1847 Douglass established and edited thepolitically oriented, antislavery newspaper the North Star.During the Civil War, President Lincoln called upon Douglass to advise him onemancipation issues. In addition, Douglass worked hard to secure the right ofblacks to enlist; when the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers was establishedas the first black regiment, he traveled throughout the North recruitingvolunteers.Douglass’s governmental involvement extended far beyond Lincoln’s tenure. He wasconsulted by the next five presidents and served as secretary of the SantoDomingo Commission (1871), marshal of the District of Columbia (1877—1881),recorder of deeds for the District of Columbia (1881-1886), and minister toHaiti (1889-1891). A year before his death Douglass delivered an importantspeech, “The Lessons of the Hour,” a denunciation of lynchings in the UnitedStates.On February 20, 1895, Frederick Douglass died of a heart attack. His deathtriggered an outpouring of grief and mourning; black schools in Washington,D.C., closed for a day, and thousands of children were taken to the MetropolitanAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church to view his open casket. In his thirdautobiography, Douglass succinctly and aptly summarized his life; writing thathe had “lived several lives in one: first, the life of slavery; secondly, thelife of a fugitive from slavery; thirdly, the life of comparative freedom;fourthly, the life of conflict and battle; and fifthly, the life of victory, ifnot complete, at least assured.”"},{"pageContent":"THE WORLD OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS AND NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS,AN AMERICAN SLAVE[images/00004.jpg]1818 In February Frederick Douglass is born Frederick Augustus Washington Baileyin Tuckahoe, Maryland. His mother, Harriet Bailey, is a slave; his father’sidentity is unknown, though many believe he was Douglass’s white master, AaronAnthony. Frederick is sent to be raised by his grandparents, Betsey and IsaacBailey.1824 Six-year-old Frederick is sent to St. Michaels, Maryland, to work on theLloyd plantation, managed by Aaron Anthony.1826 Frederick’s mother dies. He is sent to Baltimore to work for Hugh Auld, ashipbuilder and the brother of Thomas Auld, Anthony’s son-in-law Frederick’s jobis to look after Auld’s son, Tommy, and to work as a houseboy for Auld’s wife,Sophia.1827 Sophia Auld begins to teach Frederick to read, but her husband stops thelessons. Frederick continues learning on his own.1831 Having saved fifty cents, he purchases a copy of The Columbian Orator, ananthology of great speeches from leading orators throughout history, on suchissues as liberty, equality, and justice.1833 In March Frederick is sent back to St. Michaels to work for Thomas Auld.1834 In January he is hired out as a field hand to Edward Covey, a professional“slave-breaker” who beats intransigent slaves into submission. After nearlyeight months, Frederick stands up to Covey and beats him in a fight.1835 Frederick is hired out to William Freeland as a field hand. He opens aSunday school for young blacks and begins teaching them to read and write.1836 Frederick and several other of Covey’s slaves attempt to escape, but arecaught and imprisoned. Thomas Auld takes him out of prison and sends him back toBaltimore, where Hugh Auld trains him to become a ship caulker.1837 He meets and falls in love with Anna Murray, a free black woman.1838 On September 3 Frederick successfully escapes from slavery using a sailor’s“protection papers” (documents certifying the bearer is a free seaman). Hearrives in New York City on September 4 and, to avoid recapture, changes hisname to Frederick Johnson. Anna Murray joins him in New York and they marry onSeptember 15. They move to New Bedford, Massachusetts. Frederick again changeshis name, this time to Frederick Douglass, after a character in Lady of the Lake(1810), a historical poem by Sir Walter Scott.1839 In New Bedford Douglass works as a day laborer and begins speaking atabolitionist meetings. His first child, Rosetta, is born on June 24.1840 The Douglass’s son Lewis is born.1841 In August Douglass travels to Nantucket to attend a meeting of theMassachusetts Anti-Slavery Society; he meets the abolitionist William LloydGarrison, president of the American Anti-Slavery Society and editor of thewell-known abolitionist paper The Liberator. Impressed by Douglass’s eloquentand powerful speech, Garrison employs him as an antislavery speaker.1842 A second son, Frederick, is born. Douglass begins traveling in New England,New York, and elsewhere around the North as an abolitionist speaker. He tellshis personal story and attacks both slavery and northern racism. He and hisfamily move to Lynn, Massachusetts, where Anna finds work in a shoe factory.1844 Another son, Charles Remond, is born.1845 In May Douglass publishes Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, anAmerican Slave. The book is well received and widely publicized. However, itspublication exposes his identity, and fearing capture as a fugitive slave, heleaves the country. He begins traveling through England and Ireland, speakingagainst slavery.1846 On December 5, 1846, friends purchase Douglass’s freedom from Thomas Auld.1847 Douglass returns to the United States in the spring; he and his family moveto Rochester, New York. On December 3 he founds an antislavery newspaper, theNorth Star, which he continues to edit until 1860 (the paper’s name becomesFrederick Douglass’s Paper in 1851).1848 Douglass attends and speaks at the first Women’s Rights Convention inSeneca Falls, New York, beginning his long association with the women’s rightsmovement.1849 His daughter, Annie, is born.1850 Douglass becomes part of the Underground Railroad network, using his homeas a hiding place for fugitive slaves traveling north.1851 Douglass definitively breaks with Garrison, disagreeing over the issue ofmoral exhortation (which Garrison favored) versus political action (Douglass’spreference) as the major tool for eliminating slavery.1852 On July 4 Douglass delivers an impassioned speech about the meaning offreedom and slavery in a republic and about continuing hypocrisy and injustice.1855 His second autobiography, My Bondage and My Freedom, is published.1859 Abolitionist John Brown tries to enlist Douglass’s support in a raid toliberate slaves at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia); Douglassrefuses, believing it to be a doomed effort. On October 16 Brown goes throughwith his raid and is caught; he is later tried and hanged for treason. Becauseof his association with Brown, Douglass flees to England.1860 Douglass’s daughter, Annie, dies and he returns to Rochester. He campaignsfor Abraham Lincoln, who is elected president in November.1861 The Civil War begins. Douglass is a vocal proponent of the right of blacksto enlist and an aggressive propagandist for the Union cause.1863 On January 1 President Abraham Lincoln issues the EmancipationProclamation, freeing all slaves in Confederate areas not held by Union troops.The first black regiment, the Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, isassembled. Two of Douglass’s sons, Lewis and Charles, are among the recruits.Douglass travels throughout the North and recruits more than 100 members for theregiment; but he stops recruiting after a few months because of rampantdiscrimination against the black soldiers.1864 Douglass is called to the White House to discuss strategies foremancipation.1865 He attends the White House reception following Lincoln’s secondinauguration. The Civil War ends on April 9, and on April 14 Lincoln isassassinated. In December Congress ratifies the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S.Constitution, abolishing slavery.1866 Douglass supports Republican Reconstruction plans. He is part of adelegation that meets with President Andrew Johnson (who harbors Confederatesympathies) to push for black suffrage.1868- Douglass campaigns for Ulysses S. Grant, who wins the 1870 presidency in1868. On March 30, 1870, Congress passes the Fifteenth Amendment, which givesblacks the right to vote. Douglass’s support for this measure, which does notinclude women, causes a temporary rift with women’s rights supporters.1871 Grant appoints Douglass secretary of a commission to Santo Domingo.1872 The Douglass’s Rochester home is destroyed by fire; no one is injured, butmany of Douglass’s important papers are lost. The family moves to Washington,D.C.1874 Douglass is named president of Freedman’s Savings and Trust Company, a bankthat had been founded to encourage blacks to save and invest their money. Thebank is on the verge of collapse when Douglass takes it over, and it sooncloses. A newspaper Douglass had purchased in 1870—the New National Era—alsocloses.1877 President Rutherford B. Hayes appoints Douglass marshal of the District ofColumbia, a post he holds until 1881. Douglass returns to St. Michaels,Maryland, and meets with his former owner Auld, who is dying.1881 President James Garfield appoints Douglass recorder of deeds for theDistrict of Columbia, a post he holds until 1886. Douglass publishes his thirdautobiographical volume, Life and Times of Frederick Douglass.1882 His wife, Anna, dies in August.1884 Douglass causes something of a scandal when he marries his formersecretary, Helen Pitts, who is white.1889 President Benjamin Harrison appoints him minister and consul general toHaiti, a post he holds until 1891.1894 Douglass delivers his last major speech, “The Lessons of the Hour,” adenunciation of lynchings in the United States.1895 On February 20 Frederick Douglass dies in Washington, D.C., of a heartattack. He is buried in Rochester beside his first wife and his daughter, Anna.1988 On February 12 Douglass’s home in Washington, D.C., is designated theFrederick Douglass National Historic Site."},{"pageContent":"INTRODUCTION[images/00005.jpg]Crossing Over: Frederick Douglass’s Run for FreedomTHE VERY FIRST TIME I assigned Frederick Douglass’s Narrative was in the fall of1972, in Boston, Massachusetts, when I was teaching a high school equivalencynight-course for working adults. I remember the occasion well because one of thestudents complained to the school director that I was teaching hate. The classhad met only once, and we had not yet discussed the book at all, so thisstudent, a white nurse’s aide in her late twenties, directed her protest againstthe fiery book itself, which she took to be an attack upon her and all whitepeople in America.In a peculiarly American turn of events, the director, who like me was anAfrican American, happened also to be one of my friends and hallmates atHarvard, where we both were working on our doctorates. In the night-school’shallway, he told me about the complaint with a long, stern face, and then closedhis office door so we could laugh until we nearly fell to the floor. “OleBrother Douglass is still working them roots,” he said, sliding into thevernacular once we could speak in private. “Go easy on the lady,” he went on.“Gentle her into the twentieth century.”At that time Douglass was not considered a canonical American author, though hedid sometimes turn up in surveys of nineteenth-century writing and in courseswith titles like “The Negro in American Literature.” The revolution in blackliterary studies was just beginning to catch fire; but still at Harvard, forexample, there was no course in black literature offered at the graduate level,and the one such undergraduate course, in which I was a teaching assistant, wasoffered by a linguist through the Afro-American Studies Department. (It was anexcellent course.) So it was not a shock that this young woman, a few yearsolder than I and not yet a high school graduate, had never heard of FrederickDouglass. What was surprising was that this slender volume, with its antiquefigures of speech and rhetorical strategies (as well as literary structures thatwere so modern they seem to have influenced such revolutionaries in writing asHemingway eighty years later) would strike her as so current in its potency thatshe wanted to swing back at it.Part of the answer to the mystery of her response is that many of white Boston’scitizenry in the early seventies were literally up in arms against the “forceddesegregation” of schools and neighborhoods that had been as firmly closed toblacks and members of other groups considered unwelcome as were theircounterparts in Mississippi or Alabama. No doubt my student was as unaccustomedto a black teacher as she was to a black author. (What on earth went through hermind when she discovered that the program director was black, too?!)Does not this woman’s bewildered anger indicate that although the Narrative ofthe Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave existed as a mightilyeffective political weapon, it is much more than a political weapon, which mighthave dulled over time? That it is also a work of art whose sentences, with theircareful twists and balances and their unrelenting drive, continue to evoke adirect, visceral response? She may have felt the power of the book’s stark,biblical last-first /first-last language: the reverse-English of a man belongingto the group counted last in the American social hierarchy but who nonethelessbecame a leader of his people—meaning (though my student did not realize it) notjust blacks but all Americans and indeed all who love freedom.With his Narrative, Douglass succeeded in offering his readers, and eventuallyalso historians of American life, an unassailably reliable record of slaveryfrom the viewpoint of one who had been enslaved. (It is important to realizethat Douglass could not afford to exaggerate or get any name or detail wronglest the proponents of slavery leap to declare him a fraud, as they were eagerto do in the case of such an accomplished former slave.) But the book alsobrilliantly performed the aesthetic task of a work of art in depicting how itfeels to be a human locked in a struggle against tyrannical odds for freedom andculture; a man seeking a place in a world where no place looks like home. Inother words, yes, Douglass was still working those roots.Douglass’s book lures its reader through the unrelenting power of its narrativeline—perhaps literature’s most irresistible force. It is driven by impulsesevidently built into the reflex and bone structure of Homo sapiens, the animalthat wants a story. Douglass shapes his story to resonate with certain mythicpatterns in the modern world. The Douglass of this narrative is a poor lost boya long way from home, one who has no home to miss or to which he can return.With no place and nothing to call his own, no name, no birthday, no mother towhom he feels closely attached, no father to nurture or even to acknowledge him,this scarred and battered slave boy is an exile in the land of his birth. WhatDouglass does not invoke is a sense of special honor or privilege based onlineage. He knows little about his past—either of his unknown white father’sside or his mother‘s—and, even if he did, could make no claim to either side.This aligns him with many of America’s dispossessed immigrants, black andnonblack, who either were brought to the New World as slaves or who came hereunder dire economic distress. Having virtually nothing more than his own health,strength, will, and a strong sense that God’s mysterious power is on his side,Douglass’s task in the new land will be to improvise—that is, not just to findbut to help create—a new way of life, a home at last.What separates Douglass’s quest for improvement from, say, those of dime-storeHoratio Alger heroes of a generation later, is that his will to free himself isso directly related to his will to help others free themselves. The climax ofhis narrative is not just his own escape and, crucially, his marriage, whichbrings the beginnings of a new family and community; he also finds redeemingwork as an activist in the abolition movement, and, as it turns out, as anartist. His identity, in other words, is not that of the bourgeois individualwho puts himself first; instead it depends deeply on his providential fellowshipwith an activist community that gives his own being its most profound meaning.From the first “I was born ...” to the final ringing words addressed to “themillions of my brethren in bonds,” Douglass speaks for that community and for asense of ideal community that has implications for the nation. As the writerAlbert Murray has observed, compared with other American icons seekingfreedom—Davy Crockett or Daniel Boone, for example—the case of Douglass standsout. “Nobody was chasing Daniel Boone!” “Not even such justly canonized FoundingFathers as Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson represent a more splendidimage and pattern for the contemporary American citizen,” writes Murray. “Onbalance, not even Abraham Lincoln was a more heroic embodiment of the Americanas self-made man. After all, Lincoln like Franklin and Jefferson was bornfree.”a [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos374111]Douglass was an American improviser whose mighty task was to have the courage,simply, to be—an achievement that by no means could be taken for granted in asociety that defined him as a domestic animal, a piece of property to buy, work,rent, inherit, or sell. The simple assertion of Douglass’s selfhood beginsquietly, on the title page, with the announcement that this Narrative of theLife of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave was “written by himself.” Indirect opposition to the southern slave codes, which he repeatedly mocks andderides in his Narrative, Douglass has garnered sufficient literacy to get hisstory down in black and white. And lest anyone miss the connection between hisachievement of authorial power and his fight against slavery’s hardships, hedeclares, “My feet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with whichI am writing might be laid in the gashes” (p. 36).The two stirringly oratorical introductory notes by Douglass’s white brothers inthe movement, William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips, serve to guaranteethe authenticity of the narrative that follows. But Douglass is the one incontrol of his story, its author and authority asserting the truth of what hesays not through the presence of white guarantors but through the power of hisown language as a persuasive, sometimes poetic writer whose voice and witness wetrust. His book is a shining example of what Robert Stepto has brilliantlytermed a “self-authenticating narrative”;b[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos374413] it is a bookwhose proof of truth-value lies precisely in its own language.Douglass’s Narrative presents its hero as a reasonable and feeling human being,a man with a soul. But it also argues, implicitly, for the whole slave communityas worthy members of the world community of culture-makers, all denials of theirhumanity to the contrary (that is, all the scenes of the slaves herded, fed, andbeaten like animals). Douglass is a maker of literature and history; the blackcommunity writ large has created cultural forms people can use to survive thepit of slavery and to help rebuild a modern world.For one thing, African Americans created the slave songs—the musical fountainfrom which virtually all modern American music, including the blues, has sprung.In terms echoed by W. E. B. Du Bois nearly sixty years later,c[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos374989] Douglassdescribes the rich mix of feeling in the songs of sorrow sung by slaves as theytook off for the Great House Farm:> While on their way, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around,> reverberate with their wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the> deepest sadness. They would compose and sing as they went along, consulting> neither time nor tune. The thought that came up, came out—if not in the word,> in the sound;—and as frequently in the one as in the other. They would> sometimes sing the most pathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the> most rapturous sentiment in the most pathetic tone.... They would sing, as a> chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaning jargon, but which,> nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I have sometimes thought> that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impress some minds with> the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of whole volumes of> philosophy on the subject could do (pp. 25-26).It is true that Douglass is concerned about the dangers of misreading thismusic. He concludes his eloquent discussion of the slave’s songs with a warningthat they could easily be misunderstood. Douglass:> I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude and> apparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neither> saw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe> which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones> loud, long, and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling> over with the bitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery,> and a prayer to God for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild> notes always depressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have> frequently found myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to> those songs, even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an> expression of feeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs> I trace my first glimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of> slavery. I can never get rid of that conception. Those songs still follow me,> to deepen my hatred of slavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in> bonds. If any one wishes to be impressed with the soul-killing effects of> slavery, let him go to Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day,> place himself in the deep pine woods, and there let him, in silence, analyze> the sounds that shall pass through the chambers of his soul,—and if he is not> thus impressed, it will only be because “there is no flesh in his obdurate> heart” (p. 26).Aware that he himself had misread the meanings of this music, Douglass warns hisreader against missing the note of sadness and implied protest—against the“soul-killing effects of slavery”—embedded in the music. Addressing inparticular his sympathetic northern white reader, he writes:> I have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find> persons who could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their> contentment and happiness. It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake.> Slaves sing most when they are most unhappy.

What fascinates me here is the vital connection between Douglass’songoing physical struggle and his flaming determination to learn how to writeand read—including the ability to read such cultural manifestations of slaveryas the slave songs.In the compressed and powerful chapter VI, Douglass describes overhearing Mr.Auld, his new owner, warning his wife against teaching the slave boy Frederickhis ABCs. He told her “that it was unlawful, as well as unsafe, to teach a slaveto read.” Further, he declared these infamous words:> “If you give a nigger an inch, he will take an ell. A nigger should know> nothing but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning would spoil> the best nigger in the world.... If you teach that nigger ... how to read,> there would be no keeping him. It would forever unfit him to be a slave. He> would at once become unmanageable, and of no value to his master. As to> himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal of harm. It would make him> discontented and unhappy” (pp. 40-41).Douglass’s recollected response to his master’s words is mythic:> These words sank deep into my heart, stirred up sentiments within that lay> slumbering, and called into existence an entirely new train of thought. It was> a new and special revelation, explaining dark and mys terious things, with> which my youthful understanding had struggled, but struggled in vain. I now> understood what had been to me a most perplexing difficulty—to wit, the white> man’s power to enslave the black man. It was a grand achievement, and I prized> it highly. From that moment, I understood the pathway from slavery to> freedom.... In learning to read, I owe almost as much to the bitter opposition> of my master, as to the kindly aid of my mistress. I acknowledge the benefit> of both (p. 41, emphasis mine).As a reader and writer, Douglass could read the newspaper as well as books thathappened his way—so that he could better understand his predicament and possiblesolutions to it; he also was literally able to write himself a false pass (inhis first failed escape attempt, he also wrote passes for his co-conspirators),which was crucial to his eventual plan to get out of the slave South. Freedomand literacy—tightly bound strands in the fabric of Douglass’s mythic quest.Further, as we have seen, Douglass’s quest for literacy involved not merely thetechnical ability to read and write but also the skill to “read” the people,places, situations, and expressive forms around him with deeper and deeperunderstanding. He wrote his way to freedom not just with a pass but also byarticulating new terms for living: “to dream of vast horizons of the soul,” asLangston Hughes has put it, to “make our world anew.”e[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos375761]Along with the complex songs, black Americans also created a cycle of trickstertales—yarns about Brer Rabbits, Brother Johns, and others living by their witsin the briar patch of the United States. As he tells in this Narrative—as iftempered by these slave stories—Douglass learns, by degrees, that he is borninto a world controlled by slave-owners whose power is nearly absolute, that asan American slave he lives in what might be called the world of the trickster,and that to survive he must learn the games of trickery by which he is beingkept.In the realm of the tales told by black Americans, and by many other groupsaround the world, the trickster is a paradoxical charac ter, bothwish-fulfillment hero and horrific villain. The Brer Rabbit of black Americantales collected “in the field,” both in the nineteenth century of FrederickDouglass and through the mid-twentieth century not far from our own times, isprecisely such a figure of double purposes: admired for his ability to overturnthe powerful with cleverness and stealth, and yet hated for his insatiable greedand selfishness. Conditioned, perhaps, by the Brer Rabbits on television (in asense Bugs Bunny is a latter-day Brer Rabbit) and in the movies (every otherAmerican over the age of fifty has seen Walt Disney’s 1946 film Song of theSouth, with its fast, fluffy wish-fulfillment hero Brer Rabbit), we tend toremember our admiration for his good humored ability to dance away from trapsset for him by the Elmer Fudds of the world.In the context of trickster behavior in Douglass’s Narrative, though, we mustnot forget the other Brer Rabbit: the one who eats the food of all the otheranimals, the one who cares nothing for the community but lives only for privatepleasure, the monster who will deceive, punish, and kill even his own family togain and maintain personal power. The trickster is he, and sometimes she, whosetokens almost always take the same forms: sex (not love, but pure physicalpleasure through domination), food, and money. As Robert Bone has argued sowell,f [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos376136] the BrerRabbit tales that circulated orally among the slaves had two purposes: to teachthe small but clever bunny’s survival skills, required if the weak were to stayalive under the dominion of the powerful; and also, crucially, to serve ascautionary tales exposing the slave-holder (and those like him) as a kind ofBrer Rabbit run wild and somehow elected to the presidency. It is this lattertrickster as great white monster against which Douglass first learns to bracehimself.In the Narrative’s first chapter, Douglass lets his readers know that he livesin this dangerous trickster’s den by describing the extraordinarily cruelbeating of his beautiful Aunt Hester. As a baby and toddler living with hisgrandmother on the outskirts of the plantation, Douglass had been protected fromthe workaday life of the slave. But now, moved to the plantation itself, hewitnesses the first evidence of his true situation as he sees Hester under thelash. Jealous that she has been spending time with another man, a slave namedNed Roberts, Mr. Anthony, the master, strips Aunt Hester from neck to waist,fastens her hands with a rope hooked to the ceiling, and slashes her naked backwith heavy rawhide. “And soon the warm, red blood (amid heart-rending shrieksfrom her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping to the floor,” writesDouglass, who was “so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight, that I hidmyself in a closet, and dared not venture out till long after the bloodytransaction was over. I expected it would be my turn next” (p. 21).This terrible scene initiates the boy Douglass into the treacherous and chaoticworld of the trickster in power. If in this nineteenth-century world of southernchivalry, a young black woman had no protection from raw, lawless brutality, howcould Douglass not assume that there were no laws or limits at all, that indeedhis turn would come next?—particularly when the perpetrator of the arbitraryviolence seemed “to take,” in Douglass’s words, “great pleasure” in the act ofwhipping. All of her human responses, voluntary and involuntary, made thesituation worse: “The louder she screamed, the harder he whipped; and where theblood ran fastest, there he whipped longest. He would whip her to make herscream, and whip her to make her hush; and not until overcome by fatigue, wouldhe cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin” (p. 20). This terrifying scene,says Douglass, “was the blood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery,through which I was about to pass” (p. 20).In his Narrative Douglass delivers a modicum of justice to the sadistic Anthonyby the sheer act of describing his brutality and then exposing the baseness ofhis motives. As we shall see, Douglass the slave has learned to beware BrerRabbit in master’s clothing as well as to become enough of a trickster himselfto survive the trickster’s lair. And listen for the trickster-like aggressivelaughter of Douglass the writer, who describes, with a blue-hot rage barelyconcealed under the language’s deadpan surfaces, the man who beat his mother’ssister: “I have had two masters. My first master’s name was Anthony. I do notremember his first name. He was generally called Captain Anthony—a title which,I presume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay” (p. 19). Inother words, this miserable man was no more a legitimate captain or leader ofany kind than any other pretentious little man, any other human ant-ony, orwhatever his name was.Later Douglass would level his verbal guns on Captain Auld, presumably anotherbogusly titled figure, describing him as so emphatically mean that “the leadingtrait in his character was meanness; and if there were any other element in hisnature, it was made subject to this. He was mean; and, like most other mean men,he lacked the ability to conceal his meanness.” To top off his depiction of Auldas ridiculous—“incapable of managing his slaves either by force, fear, orfraud”—Douglass says, “he might have passed for a lion, but for his ears” (p.55). The man pretended a lion’s power, but still he looked foolish: He had “hisears.” Were they Brer Rabbit’s ears?This verbal aggressiveness is also seen in Douglass’s description of Mr. Severe:“rightly named.... His presence [where slaves were at work] made it both thefield of blood and of blasphemy. From the rising till the going down of the sun,he was cursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves of the field, inthe most frightful manner” (p. 24). And of Mr. Gore, whom we presume also tohave been “rightly named,” at home as he was in the realm of cruelty to slaves:“He was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place for such aman.... Though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, said no funny words, seldomsmiled. His words were in perfect keeping with his looks, and his looks were inperfect keeping with his words.... He spoke but to command, and commanded but tobe obeyed; he dealt sparingly with his words, and bountifully with his whip,never using the former where the latter would answer as well” (pp. 32-33).Without question the clearest evidence that Douglass saw the slave-holders asgrim tricksters-in-command comes in his descriptions of the slave-breaker EdwardCovey. Douglass reports that among themselves the slaves called Covey “thesnake.” Was Covey thus given the name of another trickster from the realm ofanimal tales? In careful language, Douglass describes how “the snake”> had the faculty of making us feel that he was ever present with us. This he> did by surprising us. He seldom approached the spot where we were at work> openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimed at taking us by> surprise.... When we were at work in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl> on his hands and knees to avoid detection, and all at once he would rise> nearly in our midst, and scream out, “Ha, ha! Come, come! Dash on, dash on!”> This being his mode of attack, it was never safe to stop a single minute. His> comings were like a thief in the night. He appeared to us as being ever at> hand. He was under every tree, behind every stump, in every bush, and at every> window, on the plantation. He would sometimes mount his horse, as if bound to> St. Michael‘s, a distance of seven miles, and in half an hour afterwards you> would see him coiled up in the corner of the wood-fence, watching every motion> of the slaves (p. 61).On another day Covey would pretend to give frank instructions in connection witha long trip he was taking; but then, “before he would get half way thither, hewould turn short and crawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and therewatch us till the going down of the sun.”Lest anyone miss the point, Douglass tells his reader that “Covey’s forteconsisted in his power to deceive. His life was devoted to planning andperpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he possessed in the shape oflearning or religion, he made conform to his disposition to deceive. He seemedto think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty” (p. 61). This white trickster,lying in wait for potential black tricksters, recalls the ruse of Douglass’sformer owner Colonel Lloyd, whose plan to keep slaves out of his beautiful,fruit-filled garden was a variation on the rabbit’s strategy in the tale of BrerRabbit and the tar-baby. Lloyd put tar on the fence around the garden, “afterwhich, if a slave was caught with any tar upon his person, it was deemedsufficient proof that he had either been into the garden, or had tried to getin. In either case, he was severely whipped by the chief gardener” (p. 28). Theother side of this, of course, is that doubtless the slaves were working just ashard to avoid the tar, while getting the fruit, as Lloyd was to keep them out ofhis garden in the first place. Trickster versus trickster.As with the names of Captain Anthony, Mr. Severe, and Mr. Gore,g[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos376399] so with Covey’sname, which, as with the others, Douglass underscores for mockery by repeatingit over and over again. According to Noah Webster’s 1828 dictionary, thedictionary that would have been on Douglass’s desk, “covey” is derived from theFrench noun couvee, meaning “brood” or “hatch of offspring,” and the verbcubare, meaning “to lurk or lie hid”; the dictionary defines “covey” as: “1. abrood or hatch of birds; an old fowl with her brood of young,” and “2. acompany; a set.” The modern Oxford English Dictionary specifies that a covey is“a family of partridges keeping together during the first season.” As weconsider Douglass’s ongoing strategy of gaining elbow-room on these trickstersby deflating them with sharp, aggressive language, note his constant naming ofMr. Covey, whose pluralized moniker suggests, under the pressure of Douglass’sinsistent mockery, both the slave-driver’s egotistical pretenses of omnipresenceand Covey’s secret identity not only as a snake but as “an old fowl” and lurkingmother bird—this in a book all about the exigencies of true manhood.This “Covey‘s” teenage charge, Douglass, ultimately refuses to recognize theslave-driver’s legitimate authority; he turns the tables on Covey not only withartful language but also with physical force. In the highly charged terms ofthis encounter, Douglass’s victory over Covey indicates more than one man’sdefeat of another. It is the boy David’s defeat of mighty Goliath. The languagealso suggests the smashing by Frederick (soon to be renamed Douglass, after astory-book hero) of what might be called a whole covey of Coveys, of the systemof American slavery itself, with its absurd pretensions of protecting andnurturing a black child-race in need of white “covey ing.” In Douglass’s subtlebut take-no-prisoners formulation, this absurd, brooding mother-partridge isnothing but a snake!It was under Covey’s brutal management that Douglass took seven-leagueboot-sized strides toward freedom. Again in mythic terms, Douglass describes howat first Covey’s snaky brutality and interminable regimen of hard labor defeatedhis spirit. “A few months of this discipline tamed me,” Douglass says. “Mr.Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken in body, soul, and spirit. Mynatural elasticity was crushed, my intellect languished, the disposition to readdeparted, the cheerful spark that lingered about my eye died; the dark night ofslavery closed in upon me; and behold a man transformed into a brute!” He was“sometimes prompted” to kill Covey and himself, “but was prevented by acombination of hope and fear” (p. 63).Douglass describes his reversal of fortune in terms that are at once mysticaland deeply responsive to his hard-fought struggles in trick sterdom. In anow-famous passage, he apostrophizes the sparkling Chesapeake Bay, “whose broadbosom was ever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe” (p.63), choosing terms that suggest a refusal of Covey’s thorny hatch in favor ofprotection under the majestic wings of the beautiful ships on the bay: “You arefreedom’s swift-winged angels, that fly round the world,” he calls to the winds.“I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O, that I were on one ofyour gallant decks, and under your protecting wing!” With these angels offreedom before his eyes, he resolves to risk his life to get away. “I have onlyone life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing.... Try it?Yes! God helping me, I will.” He rounds off this paragraph of mysticalrevelation and conviction quite appropriately, with a quote from the spirituals:“There is a better day coming.”Douglass resolves never again to be beaten by Covey, or anyone else, without afight. In anticipation of his showdown with Covey, while watching the ships onChesapeake Bay he says, “You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall seehow a slave was made a man.” By framing the sentence in this way, Douglass usesthe diagonal turn of phrase that we saw in his previous descriptions of Auld andGore (for example, “just the man for such a place, just the place for such aman”): a strategy of Latin and Greek speeches called chiasmus, a verbalcrisscrossing in which the order of words in the first clause of a sentence isinverted in the second. ( John F. Kennedy used chiasmus when he said, “Ask notwhat your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.”)I linger on chiasmus because this figure of speech, this verbal reversal, isimportant to the structure and meaning of Douglass’s whole book, and to themeaning of Douglass’s reversal of fortunes, his turning of the tables on histrickster-adversaries. Indeed, as we shall see, we may describe this as adouble-double-cross, as one kind of trickster reverses the fortunes of another.For Douglass’s mission was not merely to write a nicely balanced set ofsentences but to undermine and reverse a system of power relations: to show themaster as slave (to liquor, to power, to sadism), the professed Christian ashypocrite, the weak as strong, the slave as free—from one point of view,ironically freer than the master. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr., has observed, thispattern of reverse language begins in the first pages of the narrative, h[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos376720] where Douglassrepeatedly describes the very dark skin of his mother, whom he seemed to see, ashe repeats, only at night, emphasizing the darkness drawn in opposition to thestark daylight world of white control. Eventually—in a broad pattern ofchiasmus—the dark people enjoying only flashes of family togetherness andcontrol in the night will take control of their daylight hours, too, as theirfortunes turn like a chiasmus-reversed sentence: a sea-change at 180-degrees,toward freedom.i [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos377097]Back at work after his revelation at Chesapeake Bay, Douglass falls sick, and aspunishment Covey beats him severely. Failing to find protection from his(il)legal owner Master Thomas, who had rented Douglass to Covey, Douglassreturns to Covey; but when Covey runs out to beat him again, Douglass runs awayagain to hide in the woods. “My behavior,” says Douglass, “was altogetherunaccountable.” What follows is a highly significant scene in which Douglass, onthe run but without resources to attempt a run for freedom, falls in withfellow-slave Sandy Jenkins, and seeks his advice concerning what to do next. “Ifound Sandy an old adviser,” writes Douglass. Sandy Jenkins’s advice issurprising in the context of Christianity but not in the context of Douglass’songoing battle against the forces of tricksterism.> He told me, with great solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that before I> went, I must go with him into another part of the woods, where there was a> certain root, which, if I would take some of it with me, carrying it always on> my right side, would render it impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white> man, to whip me. He said he had carried it for years; and since he had done> so, he had never received a blow, and never expected to while he carried it. I> at first rejected the idea, that the simple carrying of a root in my pocket> would have any such effect as he had said, and was not disposed to take it;> but Sandy impressed the necessity with much earnestness, telling me it could> do no harm if it did no good. To please him, I at length took the root, and,> according to his direction, carried it upon my right side (pp. 67-68).The best gloss for this scene has been provided by the writer Toni Morrison, whoargues that Sandy embodies an ancestral tradition of root workers and doctorstraceable back through African-American religio-medicinal practices of the Southand the Caribbean to the continent of Africa. Further, Sandy (whose name seemsto reinforce his identity as a man of the spirit and of the earth—perhaps of theseashore) offers a “safe space” and encouragements that serve to reconnectDouglass with a sense of a black community that cares about him, and which hasways of its own that are beyond the watch and guard of slavery andslave-holders, with their officially sanctioned practices and epistemologies.j[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos378068] Sandy’s identityas an “old adviser” married to a free woman suggests possibilities of freedomand family for Douglass, too. Slavery has been a cauldron of family separation;but here are a wise man and family unit to prove, as Douglass had announced atChesapeake Bay, a better day coming. Here, too, is hope that the powers of theblack world—the dark mother, the night, the root from the ground now secretlyheld in the pocket—will invade and reverse the bleak, blaring bright worldoverseen by the likes of Covey, a snake in the sun watching and waiting toattack.The power of Sandy’s root is tested that Sunday morning when Douglass takes hisfriend’s advice and heads straight back to Covey’s place. He immediately seesCovey, who speaks kindly, gives Douglass a minor task, and continues on his wayto church. Perhaps the root was working! That Monday morning, the root’sefficacy is fully tested. Covey comes at Douglass with a long rope, and setsabout tying him up for a thrashing. As soon as Douglass realizes Covey’s plan,the young man springs away but is again secured. “But at this moment—from whencecame the spirit I don’t know—I resolved to fight; ... I seized Covey hard by thethroat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him” (p. 68). Theyfought for nearly two hours, remembers Douglass. “I considered him as gettingentirely the worst end of the bargain; for he had drawn no blood from me, but Ihad from him.... This battle with Covey,” says Douglass, “was the turning-pointin my career as a slave” [emphasis mine]. As a result of the fight, “mylong-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place; andI now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day hadpassed forever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let it beknown of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must alsosucceed in killing me.” Covey never touches him again, and in the four remainingyears of his bondage, “I had several fights, but was never whipped” (p. 69).The fight with Covey indicates that to survive slavery Douglass needs thestrategies of both trickster and strongman—“the hare and the bear,” as RalphEllison once put it. Still the presence of the good-luck root(rabbit‘s-foot-like charm that it is) makes clear that stealth and otherqualities represented by the root are more important than sheer physical forcein reversing Douglass’s fortunes. Chiasmus—the art of turning things around—wasworking as a hard-bought strategy in Douglass’s life before he had learned tomaster it as a figure of speech.Silence and masquerade are also key ingredients in Douglass’s reversal offortune. It is a commonplace of Douglass criticism to underscore the writer’srefusal to let his reader know exactly how he got away, lest future runawayslose an effective avenue of escape. In this same spirit, Douglass refrains fromthanking the poor white boys on the streets of Baltimore who, when he was ayoung boy, traded Douglass’s bread for reading lessons, “that more valuablebread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three ofthose little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them;but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them;for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in thisChristian country.” He reveals only the street name on which they lived andindicates that they not only taught a slave to read but also were troubled whenthey learned his legal status. “They would express for me the liveliestsympathy, and console me with the hope that something would occur by which Imight be free” (p. 44).These particular instances of purposive silence in fact lend credibility to theentire Narrative, and there are several other important scenes in which silencespeaks more clearly than words. At times, for instance, Douglass does notdescribe a scene that he finds too com plexly moving to convey in words. Such isthe case when Aunt Hester is beaten as he looks on in horror. This entrance toslavery’s bloody gate “was a most terrible spectacle,” he says. “I wish I couldcommit to paper the feelings with which I beheld it” (p. 20).Elsewhere, silence is a strategy for the slave’s survival in the tricksters’world. Colonel Lloyd owned so many slaves> that he did not know them when he saw them; nor did all the slaves of the> out-farms know him. It is reported of him, that, while riding along the road> one day, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual manner of> speaking to colored people on the public highways of the south: “Well, boy,> whom do you belong to?” “To Colonel Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does the> colonel treat you well?” “No, sir,” was the ready reply. “What, does he work> you too hard?” “Yes, sir.” “Well, don’t he give you enough to eat?” “Yes, sir,> he gives me enough, such as it is.” (p. 30).A few weeks later the poor man, who never realized he had been speaking toColonel Lloyd himself, is sold to a Georgia trader as punishment for findingfault with his master. “This is the penalty of telling the truth, of telling thesimple truth, in answer to a series of plain questions.” Sometimes spies weresent among the slaves to report their views to their master. This constantdanger, says Douglass, explains why slaves routinely assured whites that theywere contented, and established among the slaves the saying, “a still tonguemakes a wise head” (p. 30). Perhaps it is with these words in mind that Douglasspasses the word among his fellow escapees, once they are betrayed: “Ownnothing,” he says, (meaning “admit nothing”) “and ‘Own nothing!‘ said we all”(p. 81).These strategies of silence and masquerade come into play in the final days ofDouglass’s career as a slave. Here, too, the maxim that geography is fate provedtrue. Each move—from the remote farm to the Great House Farm, and from the GreatHouse Farm to Baltimore, and even the trip back to eastern Maryland where hefaced Covey—proved to be progressive steps. Clearly, the more complex andvariegated the setting, the easier it would be to get away. In a large port townlike Baltimore, so many people from so many backgrounds came and went that thetrickster-trained slave could turn many situations to his or her advantage or,given a piece of luck, could simply vanish.Working as a caulker in Baltimore, Douglass earned from six to nine dollars aweek, and he turned it all over to Master Hugh. To encourage him to keep up thegood work, Hugh would sometimes give Douglass six cents. This gift had theopposite effect, admits Douglass. “I regarded it as a sort of admission of myright to the whole” (p. 89). Eventually, at his own suggestion, Douglass beginsto hire out his time; but only with the understanding that he must cover all hisown expenses and bring the master his money come rain or come shine. Because itafforded greater independence, Douglass agrees to this arrangement; but hisanalysis of it shows that he was not being fooled: The deal “was decidedly in mymaster’s favor,” writes Douglass. “It relieved him of all need of looking afterme. His money was sure.” Fascinatingly, Douglass frames part of his analysis interms close to those of a chiasmus. Of the master, Douglass says: “He receivedall the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all theevils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman” (p. 90).But it is Douglass who will force the final reversal of terms. Resolving to runaway, he acts as if he has taken to heart Hugh’s advice, which was “to contentmyself, and be obedient, ... lay out no plans to the future” (p. 90). To putHugh’s mind at rest, Douglass brings him more money than originally contracted.“He seemed very well pleased.... He little knew what my plans were. My object inworking steadily was to remove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent torun away; and in this I succeeded admirably. I suppose he thought I was neverbetter satisfied with my condition than at the very time during which I wasplanning my escape.” Master Hugh is so pleased by Douglass’s faithfulness thathe rewards him with twenty-five cents, “quite a large sum for a slaveholder togive a slave,” observes Douglass, “and bade me to make a good use of it. I toldhim I would” (p. 92).On September 3, 1838, Douglass escaped to New York. “How I did so,—what means Iadopted,—what direction I travelled, and by what mode of conveyance,—I mustleave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned” (pp. 92-93). He is offtoward taking his place in the abolition movement. Here, indeed, is another keyinstance of chiasmus, as the man who has learned to keep silent and “ownnothing” prepares to take his place as a speaker and writer whose words will notgo away.Finding himself in a thick briar patch with tricksters owning power that isnearly absolute, Douglass quickly learns to become something of a tricksterhimself. Finding himself ruled by a system of what he terms Lynch Law—thearbitrary prerogatives of those who have all the official power—Douglass learnsto read and write; in so doing he develops a rhetorical strategy that trains hismind for revolutionary action, for literally turning the tables on the powerful.He learns to write sentences that outlast theirs; and then, through speeches andthrough his speechlike narrative, he helps generation after generation of thoseseeking freedom to find their way from learning how a man or woman becomes aslave to knowing how a slave becomes a man or woman.This vital knowledge, and the images of freedom through conscientious struggle,ultimately served me well as equipment for living, helping me to survive boththe Boston and the Harvard of those difficult years. Perhaps eventually ithelped my Boston student as well. I hope that as she made her own leap towardthe sense of possibility embodied in the high school diploma and college degree,she made another leap as well: toward recognizing Douglass not as her adversarybut as her own great-great-grandfather—for in art there are no degrees ofseparation—and an inspiration to her own daughters and sons and granddaughters-and grandsons-to-be. I truly hope she came to know that Douglass was workingthose roots for reversals of ill fortune not just for himself or for me and mypeople, but for us all.Robert G.

He was a stranger to nearlyevery member of that body; but, having recently made his escape from thesouthern prison-house of bondage,1[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos323326] and feeling hiscuriosity excited to ascertain the principles and measures of theabolitionists,—of whom he had heard a somewhat vague description while he was aslave,—he was induced to give his attendance, on the occasion alluded to, thoughat that time a resident in New Bedford.Fortunate, most fortunate occurrence!—fortunate for the millions of his manacledbrethren, yet panting for deliverance from their awful thraldom!—fortunate forthe cause of negro emanicpation, and of universal liberty!—fortunate for theland of his birth, which he has already done so much to save andbless!—fortunate for a large circle of friends and acquaintances, whose sympathyand affection he has strongly secured by the many sufferings he has endured, byhis virtuous traits of character, by his ever abiding remembrance of those whoare in bonds, as being bound with them!—fortunate for the multitudes, in variousparts of our republic, whose minds he has enlightened on the subject of slavery,and who have been melted to tears by his pathos, or roused to virtuousindignation by his stirring eloquence against the enslavers of men!—fortunatefor himself, as it at once brought him into the field of public usefulness,“gave the world assurance of a MAN,”2[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos323741] quickened theslumbering energies of his soul, and consecrated him to the great work ofbreaking the rod of the oppressor, and letting the oppressed go free!I shall never forget his first speech at the convention3[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos324162]—the extraordinaryemotion it excited in my own mind—the powerful impression it created upon acrowded auditory,l[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos379279] completely takenby surprise—the applause which followed from the beginning to the end of hisfelicitous remarks. I think I never hated slavery so intensely as at thatmoment; certainly, my perception of the enormous outrage which is inflicted byit, on the godlike nature of its victims, was rendered far more clear than ever.There stood one, in physical proportion and stature commanding and exact—inintellect richly endowed—in natural eloquence a prodigy—in soul manifestly“created but a little lower than the angels”m[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos379451]—yet a slave, ay,a fugitive slave,—trembling for his safety, hardly daring to believe that on theAmerican soil, a single white person could be found who would befriend him atall hazards, for the love of God and humanity! Capable of high attainments as anintellectual and moral being—needing nothing but a comparatively small amount ofcultivation to make him an ornament to society and a blessing to his race—by thelaw of the land, by the voice of the people, by the terms of the slave code,4[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos324647] he was only apiece of property, a beast of burden, a chattel personal,n[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos379666] nevertheless!A beloved friend from New Bedford5[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos325089] prevailed on Mr.DOUGLASS to address the convention. He came forward to the platform with ahesitancy and embarrassment, necessarily the attendants of a sensitive mind insuch a novel position. After apologizing for his ignorance, and reminding theaudience that slavery was a poor school for the human intellect and heart, heproceeded to narrate some of the facts in his own history as a slave, and in thecourse of his speech gave utterance to many noble thoughts and thrillingreflections. As soon as he had taken his seat, filled with hope and admiration,I rose, and declared that PATRICK HENRY, of revolutionary fame,6[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos325375] never made aspeech more eloquent in the cause of liberty, than the one we had just listenedto from the lips of that hunted fugitive. So I believed at that time—such is mybelief now. I reminded the audience of the peril which surrounded thisself-emancipated young man at the North,—even in Massachusetts, on the soil ofthe Pilgrim Fathers, among the descendants of revolutionary sires; and Iappealed to them, whether they would ever allow him to be carried back intoslavery,—law or no law, constitution or no constitution. The response wasunanimous and in thunder-tones—“NO!” “Will you succor and protect him as abrother-man—a resident of the old Bay State?”o[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos379885] “YES!” shoutedthe whole mass, with an energy so startling, that the ruthless tyrants south ofMason and Dixon’s linep[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos380060] might almost haveheard the mighty burst of feeling, and recognized it as the pledge of aninvincible determination, on the part of those who gave it, never to betray himthat wanders, but to hide the outcast, and firmly to abide the consequences.It was at once deeply impressed upon my mind, that, if Mr. DOUGLASS could bepersuaded to consecrate his time and talents to the promotion of theanti-slavery enterprise, a powerful impetus would be given to it, and a stunningblow at the same time inflicted on northern prejudice against a coloredcomplexion. I therefore en deavored to instill hope and courage into his mind,in order that he might dare to engage in a vocation so anomalous and responsiblefor a person in his situation; and I was seconded in this effort by warm-heartedfriends, especially by the late General Agent of the Massachusetts Anti-SlaverySociety, Mr. JOHN A. COLLINS,7[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos325844] whose judgment inthis instance entirely coincided with my own. At first, he could give noencouragement; with unfeigned diffidence,q[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos380352] he expressed hisconviction that he was not adequate to the performance of so great a task; thepath marked out was wholly an untrodden one; he was sincerely apprehensive thathe should do more harm than good. After much deliberation, however, he consentedto make a trial; and ever since that period, he has acted as a lecturing agent,under the auspices either of the American or the Massachusetts Anti-SlaverySociety. In labors he has been most abundant; and his success in combatingprejudice, in gaining proselytes,r[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos380531] in agitating thepublic mind, has far surpassed the most sanguine expectations that were raisedat the commencement of his brilliant career. He has borne himself withgentleness and meekness, yet with true manliness of character. As a publicspeaker, he excels in pathos, wit, comparison, imitation, strength of reasoning,and fluency of language. There is in him that union of head and heart, which isindispensable to an enlightenment of the heads and a winning of the hearts ofothers. May his strength continue to be equal to his day! May he continue to“grow in grace, and in the knowledge of God,”s[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos380701] that he may beincreasingly serviceable in the cause of bleeding humanity, whether at home orabroad!It is certainly a very remarkable fact, that one of the most efficient advocatesof the slave population, now before the public, is a fugitive slave, in theperson of FREDERICK DOUGLASS; and that the free colored population of the UnitedStates are as ably represented by one of their own number, in the person ofCHARLES LENOX REMOND,8[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos326134] whose eloquentappeals have extorted the highest applause of multitudes on both sides of theAtlantic. Let the calumniatorst[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos380899] of the coloredrace despise themselves for their baseness and illiberality of spirit, andhenceforth cease to talk of the natural inferiority of those who require nothingbut time and opportunity to attain to the highest point of human excellence.It may, perhaps, be fairly questioned, whether any other portion of thepopulation of the earth could have endured the privations, sufferings andhorrors of slavery, without having become more degraded in the scale of humanitythan the slaves of African descent. Nothing has been left undone to crippletheir intellects, darken their minds, debase their moral nature, obliterate alltraces of their relationship to mankind; and yet how wonderfully they havesustained the mighty load of a most frightful bondage, under which they havebeen groaning for centuries! To illustrate the effect of slavery on the whiteman,—to show that he has no powers of endurance, in such a condition, superiorto those of his black brother,—DANIEL O‘CONNELL,9[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos326630] the distinguishedadvocate of universal emancipation, and the might iest champion of prostrate butnot conquered Ireland, relates the following anecdote in a speech delivered byhim in the Conciliation Hall, Dublin, before the Loyal National RepealAssociation, March 31, 1845. “No matter,” said Mr. O‘CONNELL, “under whatspecious term it may disguise itself, slavery is still hideous. It bas anatural, an inevitable tendency to brutalize every noble faculty of man. AnAmerican sailor, who was cast away on the shore of Africa, where he was kept inslavery for three years, was, at the expiration of that period, found to beimbruted and stultifiedu[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos381082]—he had lost allreasoning power; and having forgotten his native language, could only utter somesavage gibberish between Arabic and English, which nobody could understand, andwhich even he himself found difficulty in pronouncing. So much for thehumanizing influence of THE DOMESTIC INSTITUTION!”v[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos381335] Admitting this tohave been an extraordinary case of mental deterioration, it proves at least thatthe white slave can sink as low in the scale of humanity as the black one.Mr. DOUGLASS has very properly chosen to write his own Narrative, in his ownstyle, and according to the best of his ability, rather than to employ some oneelse. It is, therefore, entirely his own production; and, considering how longand dark was the career he had to run as a slave,—how few have been hisopportunities to improve his mind since he broke his iron fetters,—it is, in myjudgment, highly creditable to his head and heart. He who can peruse it withouta tearful eye, a heaving breast, an afflicted spirit,—without being filled withan unutterable abhorrence of slavery and all its abettors,w[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos381572] and animated witha determination to seek the immediate overthrow of that execrablex[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos381743] system,—withouttrembling for the fate of this country in the hands of a righteous God, who isever on the side of the oppressed, and whose arm is not shortened that it cannotsave,—must have a flinty heart, and be qualified to act the part of a trafficker“in slaves and the souls of men.”y[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos381915] I am confidentthat it is essentially true in all its statements; that nothing has been setdown in malice, nothing exaggerated, nothing drawn from the imagination; that itcomes short of the reality, rather than overstates a single fact in regard toSLAVERY AS IT IS.10[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos326966] The experience ofFREDERICK DOUGLASS, as a slave, was not a peculiar one; his lot was notespecially a hard one; his case may be regarded as a very fair specimen of thetreatment of slaves in Maryland, in which State it is conceded that they arebetter fed and less cruelly treated than in Georgia, Alabama, or Louisiana. Manyhave suffered incomparably more, while very few on the plantations have sufferedless, than himself. Yet how deplorable was his situation! what terriblechastisements were inflicted upon his person! what still more shocking outrageswere perpetrated upon his mind! with all his noble powers and sublimeaspirations, how like a brute was he treated, even by those professing to havethe same mind in them that was in Christ Jesus! to what dreadful liabilities washe continually subjected! how destitute of friendly counsel and aid, even in hisgreatest extremities! how heavy was the midnight of woe which shrouded inblackness the last ray of hope, and filled the future with terror and gloom!what longings after freedom took possession of his breast, and how his miseryaugmented, in proportion as he grew reflective and intelligent,—thusdemonstrating that a happy slave is an extinct man! how he thought, reasoned,felt, under the lash of the driver, with the chains upon his limbs! what perilshe encountered in his endeavors to escape from his horrible doom! and how signalhave been his deliverance and preservation in the midst of a nation of pitilessenemies!This Narrative contains many affecting incidents, many passages of greateloquence and power; but I think the most thrilling one of them all is thedescription DOUGLASS gives of his feelings, as he stood soliloquizing respectinghis fate, and the chances of his one day being a freeman, on the banks of theChesapeake Bay—viewing the receding vessels as they flew with their white wingsbefore the breeze, and apostrophizingz[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos382117] them as animatedby the living spirit of freedom. Who can read that passage, and be insensible toits pathos and sublimity? Compressed into it is a whole Alexandrian libraryaa[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos382372] of thought,feeling, and sentiment—all that can, all that need be urged, in the form ofexpostulation, entreaty, rebuke, against that crime of crimes,—making man theproperty of his fellow-man! O, how accursed is that system, which entombs thegodlike mind of man, defaces the divine image, reduces those who by creationwere crowned with glory and honor to a level with four-footed beasts, and exaltsthe dealer in human flesh above all that is called God! Why should its existencebe prolonged one hour? Is it not evil, only evil, and that continually? Whatdoes its presence imply but the absence of all fear of God, all regard for man,on the part of the people of the United States? Heaven speed its eternaloverthrow!So profoundly ignorant of the nature of slavery are many persons, that they arestubbornly incredulous whenever they read or listen to any recital of thecruelties which are daily inflicted on its victims. They do not deny that theslaves are held as property; but that terrible fact seems to convey to theirminds no idea of injustice, exposure to outrage, or savage barbarity. Tell themof cruel scourgings, of mutilations and brandings, of scenes of pollution andblood, of the banishment of all light and knowledge, and they affect to begreatly indignant at such enormous exaggerations, such wholesale misstatements,such abominable libels on the character of the southern planters! As if allthese direful outrages were not the natural results of slavery! As if it wereless cruel to reduce a human being to the condition of a thing, than to give hima severe flagellation, or to deprive him of necessary food and clothing! As ifwhips, chains, thumb-screws, paddles, bloodhounds, overseers, drivers, patrols,were not all indispensable to keep the slaves down, and to give protection totheir ruthless oppressors! As if, when the marriage institution is abolished,concubinage,ab [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos382664]adultery, and incest, must not necessarily abound; when all the rights ofhumanity are annihilated, any barrier remains to protect the victim from thefury of the spoiler; when absolute power is assumed over life and liberty, itwill not be wielded with destructive sway! Skeptics of this character abound insociety. In some few instances, their incredulity arises from a want ofreflection; but, generally, it indicates a hatred of the light, a desire toshield slavery from the assaults of its foes, a contempt of the colored race,whether bond or free. Such will try to discredit the shocking tales ofslaveholding cruelty which are recorded in this truthful Narrative; but theywill labor in vain. Mr. DOUGLASS has frankly disclosed the place of his birth,the names of those who claimed ownership in his body and soul, and the namesalso of those who committed the crimes which he has alleged against them. Hisstatements, therefore, may easily be disproved, if they are untrue.In the course of his Narrative, he relates two instances of murderouscruelty,—in one of which a planter deliberately shot a slave belonging to aneighboring plantation, who had unintentionally gotten within his lordly domainin quest of fish; and in the other, an overseer blew out the brains of a slavewho had fled to a stream of water to escape a bloody scourging. Mr. DOUGLASSstates that in neither of these instances was any thing done by way of legalarrest or judicial investigation. The Baltimore American, of March 17, 1845,relates a similar case of atrocity, perpetrated with similar impunity—asfollows: —“Shooting a Slave.—We learn, upon the authority of a letter fromCharles county, Maryland, received by a gentleman of this city, that a youngman, named Matthews, a nephew of General Matthews, and whose father, it isbelieved, holds an office at Washington, killed one of the slaves upon hisfather’s farm by shooting him. The letter states that young Matthews had beenleft in charge of the farm; that he gave an order to the servant, which wasdisobeyed, when he proceeded to the house, obtained a gun, and, returning, shotthe servant. He immediately, the letter continues, fled to his father’sresidence, where he still remains unmolested.”—Let it never be forgotten, thatno slaveholder or overseer can be convicted of any outrage perpetrated on theperson of a slave, however diabolical it may be, on the testimony of coloredwitnesses, whether bond or free. By the slave code, they are adjudged to be asincompetent to testify against a white man, as though they were indeed a part ofthe brute creation. Hence, there is no legal protection in fact, whatever theremay be in form, for the slave population; and any amount of cruelty may beinflicted on them with impunity. Is it possible for the human mind to conceiveof a more horrible state of society?The effect of a religious profession on the conduct of southern masters isvividly described in the following Narrative, and shown to be any thing butsalutary. In the nature of the case, it must be in the highest degreepernicious. The testimony of Mr. DOUGLASS, on this point, is sustained by acloud of witnesses, whose veracity is unimpeachable. ac[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos382862] “A slaveholder’sprofession of Christianity is a palpable imposture. He is a felon of the highestgrade. He is a man-stealer. It is of no importance what you put in the otherscale.”Reader! are you with the man-stealers in sympathy and purpose, or on the side oftheir down-trodden victims? If with the former, then are you the foe of God andman.

One might, indeed, rest sufficiently satisfied with what, it isevident, must be, in general, the results of such a relation, without seekingfurther to find whether they have followed in every instance. Indeed, those whostare at the half-peck of corn a week, and love to count the lashes on theslave’s back, are seldom the “stuff” out of which reformers and abolitionistsare to be made. I remember that, in 1838, many were waiting for the results ofthe West India experiment, 12[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos327893] before they couldcome into our ranks. Those “results” have come long ago; but, alas! few of thatnumber have come with them, as converts. A man must be disposed to judge ofemancipation by other tests than whether it has increased the produce ofsugar,—and to hate slavery for other reasons than because it starves men andwhips women,—before he is ready to lay the first stone of his anti-slavery life.I was glad to learn, in your story, how early the most neglected of God’schildren waken to a sense of their rights, and of the injustice done them.Experience is a keen teacher; and long before you had mastered yourABC, or knewwhere the “white sails” of the Chesapeake were bound, you began, I see, to gaugethe wretchedness of the slave, not by his hunger and want, not by his lashes andtoil, but by the cruel and blighting death which gathers over his soul.In connection with this, there is one circumstance which makes yourrecollections peculiarly valuable, and renders your early insight the moreremarkable. You come from that part of the country where we are told slaveryappears with its fairest features. Let us hear, then, what it is at its bestestate—gaze on its bright side, if it has one; and then imagination may task herpowers to add dark lines to the picture, as she travels southward to that (forthe colored man) Valley of the Shadow of Death, where the Mississippi sweepsalong.Again, we have known you long, and can put the most entire confidence in yourtruth, candor, and sincerity. Every one who has heard you speak has felt, and, Iam confident, every one who reads your book will feel, persuaded that you givethem a fair specimen of the whole truth. No one-sided portrait,—no wholesalecomplaints,—but strict justice done, whenever individual kindliness hasneutralized, for a moment, the deadly system with which it was strangely allied.You have been with us, too, some years, and can fairly compare the twilight ofrights, which your race enjoy at the North, with that “noon of night” underwhich they labor south of Mason and Dixon’s line. Tell us whether, after all,the half-free colored man of Massachusetts is worse off than the pampered slaveof the rice swamps!In reading your life, no one can say that we have unfairly picked out some rarespecimens of cruelty. We know that the bitter drops, which even you have drainedfrom the cup, are no incidental aggravations, no individual ills, but such asmust mingle always and necessarily in the lot of every slave. They are theessential ingredients, not the occasional results, of the system.After all, I shall read your book with trembling for you. Some years ago, whenyou were beginning to tell me your real name and birth-place, you may remember Istopped you, and preferred to remain ignorant of all. With the exception of avague description, so I continued, till the other day, when you read me yourmemoirs. I hardly knew, at the time, whether to thank you or not for the sightof them, when I reflected that it was still dangerous, in Massachusetts, forhonest men to tell their names! They say the fathers, in 1776, signed theDeclaration of Independence with the halterae[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos383394] about theirnecks. You, too, publish your declaration of freedom with danger compassingaf[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos383590] you around. Inall the broad lands which the Constitution of the United States overshadows,there is no single spot,—however narrow or desolate,—where a fugitive slave canplant himself and say, “I am safe.” The whole armory of Northern Law has noshield for you. I am free to say that, in your place, I should throw the MS.into the fire.You, perhaps, may tell your story in safety, endeared as you are to so many warmhearts by rare gifts, and a still rarer devotion of them to the service ofothers. But it will be owing only to your labors, and the fearless efforts ofthose who, trampling the laws and Constitution of the country under their feet,are determined that they will “hide the outcast,” and that their hearths shallbe, spite of the law, an asylum for the oppressed, if, some time or other, thehumblest may stand in our streets, and bear witness in safety against thecruelties of which he has been the victim.Yet it is sad to think, that these very throbbing hearts which welcome yourstory, and form your best safeguard in telling it, are all beating contrary tothe “statute in such case made and provided.” Go on, my dear friend, till you,and those who, like you, have been saved, so as by fire, from the darkprison-house, shall stereotypeag[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos383763] these free,illegal pulses into statutes; and New England, cutting loose from ablood-stained Union, shall glory in being the house of refuge for theoppressed;--till we no longer merely “hide the outcast,”ah[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos384021] or make a meritof standing idly by while he is hunted in our midst; but, consecrating anew thesoil of the Pilgrims as an asylum for the oppressed, proclaim our welcome to theslave so loudly, that the tones shall reach every hut in the Carolinas, and makethe broken-hearted bondman leap up at the thought of old Massachusetts.God speed the day!Till then, and ever,Yours truly,Wendell Phillips"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER I[images/00008.jpg]I WAS BORN IN Tuckahoe, near Hillsborough, and about twelve miles from Easton,in Talbot county, Maryland. I have no accurate knowledge of my age, never havingseen any authentic record containing it.13[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos328341] By far the largerpart of the slaves know as little of their ages as horses know of theirs, and itis the wish of most masters within my knowledge to keep their slaves thusignorant. I do not remember to have ever met a slave who could tell of hisbirthday. They seldom come nearer to it than planting-time, harvest-time,cherry-time, spring-time, or fall-time. A want of information concerning my ownwas a source of unhappiness to me even during childhood. The white childrencould tell their ages. I could not tell why I ought to be deprived of the sameprivilege. I was not allowed to make any inquiries of my master concerning it.He deemed all such inquiries on the part of a slave improper and impertinent,and evidence of a restless spirit. The nearest estimate I can give makes me nowbetween twenty-seven and twenty-eight years of age. I come to this, from hearingmy master say, some time during 1835, I was about seventeen years old.My mother was named Harriet Bailey. She was the daughter of Isaac and BetseyBailey, both colored, and quite dark. My mother was of a darker complexion thaneither my grandmother or grandfather.My father was a white man.14[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos328806] He was admittedto be such by all I ever heard speak of my parentage. The opinion was alsowhispered that my master was my father; but of the correctness of this opinion,I know nothing; the means of knowing was withheld from me. My mother and I wereseparated when I was but an infant—before I knew her as my mother. It is acommon custom, in the part of Maryland from which I ran away, to part childrenfrom their mothers at a very early age. Frequently, before the child has reachedits twelfth month, its mother is taken from it, and hired out on some farm aconsiderable distance off, and the child is placed under the care of an oldwoman, too old for field labor. For what this separation is done, I do not know,unless it be to hinder the development of the child’s affection toward itsmother, and to blunt and destroy the natural affection of the mother for thechild. This is the inevitable result.I never saw my mother, to know her as such, more than four or five times in mylife; and each of those times was very short in duration, and at night. She washired by a Mr. Stewart, who lived about twelve miles from my home. She made herjourneys to see me in the night, travelling the whole distance on foot, afterthe performance of her day’s work. She was a field hand, and a whipping is thepenalty of not being in the field at sunrise, unless a slave has specialpermission from his or her master to the contrary—a permission which they seldomget, and one that gives to him that gives it the proud name of being a kindmaster. I do not recollect of ever seeing my mother by the light of day. She waswith me in the night. She would lie down with me, and get me to sleep, but longbefore I waked she was gone. Very little communication ever took place betweenus. Death soon ended what little we could have while she lived, and with it herhardships and suffering. She died when I was about seven years old, on one of mymaster’s farms, near Lee’s Mill. I was not allowed to be present during herillness, at her death, or burial. She was gone long before I knew any thingabout it. Never having enjoyed, to any considerable extent, her soothingpresence, her tender and watchful care, I received the tidings of her death withmuch the same emotions I should have probably felt at the death of a stranger.Called thus suddenly away, she left me without the slightest intimation of whomy father was. The whisper that my master was my father, may or may not be true;and, true or false, it is of but little consequence to my purpose whilst thefact remains, in all its glaring odiousness, that slaveholders have ordained,and by law established, that the children of slave women shall in all casesfollow the condition of their mothers; and this is done too obviously toadminister to their own lusts, and make a gratification of their wicked desiresprofitable as well as pleasurable; for by this cunning arrangement, the slaveholder, in cases not a few, sustains to his slaves the double relation of masterand father.I know of such cases; and it is worthy of remark that such slaves invariablysuffer greater hardships, and have more to contend with, than others. They are,in the first place, a constant offence to their mistress. She is ever disposedto find fault with them; they can seldom do any thing to please her; she isnever better pleased than when she sees them under the lash, especially when shesuspects her husband of showing to his mulatto children favors which hewithholds from his black slaves. The master is frequently compelled to sell thisclass of his slaves, out of deference to the feelings of his white wife; and,cruel as the deed may strike any one to be, for a man to sell his own childrento human flesh-mongers, it is often the dictate of humanity for him to do so;for, unless he does this, he must not only whip them himself, but must stand byand see one white son tie up his brother, of but few shades darker complexionthan himself, and ply the gory lash to his naked back; and if he lisp one wordof disapproval, it is set down to his parental partiality, and only makes a badmatter worse, both for himself and the slave whom he would protect and defend.Every year brings with it multitudes of this class of slaves. It was doubtlessin consequence of a knowledge of this fact, that one great statesman of thesouth predicted the downfall of slavery by the inevitable laws of population.Whether this prophecy is ever fulfilled or not, it is nevertheless plain that avery different-looking class of people are springing up at the south, and arenow held in slavery, from those originally brought to this country from Africa;and if their increase will do no other good, it will do away the force of theargument, that God cursed Ham,15[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos329150] and thereforeAmerican slavery is right. If the lineal descendants of Ham are alone to bescripturally enslaved, it is certain that slavery at the south must soon becomeun-scriptural; for thousands are ushered into the world, annually, who, likemyself, owe their existence to white fathers, and those fathers most frequentlytheir own masters.I have had two masters. My first master’s name was Anthony. I do not rememberhis first name. He was generally called Captain Anthony—a title which, Ipresume, he acquired by sailing a craft on the Chesapeake Bay. He was notconsidered a rich slaveholder. He owned two or three farms, and about thirtyslaves. His farms and slaves were under the care of an overseer. The overseer’sname was Plummer. Mr. Plummer was a miserable drunkard, a profane swearer, and asavage monster. He always went armed with a cowskin and a heavy cudgel.ai[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos384219] I have known himto cut and slash the women’s heads so horribly, that even master would beenraged at his cruelty, and would threaten to whip him if he did not mindhimself. Master, however, was not a humane slaveholder. It requiredextraordinary barbarity on the part of an overseer to affect him. He was a cruelman, hardened by a long life of slaveholding. He would at times seem to takegreat pleasure in whipping a slave. I have often been awakened at the dawn ofday by the most heartrending shrieks of an own aunt of mine, whom he used to tieup to a joist, and whip upon her naked back till she was literally covered withblood. No words, no tears, no prayers, from his gory victim, seemed to move hisiron heart from its bloody purpose. The louder she screamed, the harder hewhipped; and where the blood ran fastest, there he whipped longest. He wouldwhip her to make her scream, and whip her to make her hush; and not untilovercome by fatigue, would he cease to swing the blood-clotted cowskin. Iremember the first time I ever witnessed this horrible exhibition. I was quite achild, but I well remember it. I never shall forget it whilst I remember anything. It was the first of a long series of such outrages, of which I was doomedto be a witness and a participant. It struck me with awful force. It was theblood-stained gate, the entrance to the hell of slavery, through which I wasabout to pass. It was a most terrible spectacle. I wish I could commit to paperthe feelings with which I beheld it.This occurrence took place very soon after I went to live with my old master,and under the following circumstances. Aunt Hester went out one night,—where orfor what I do not know,—and happened to be absent when my master desired herpresence. He had ordered her not to go out evenings, and warned her that shemust never let him catch her in company with a young man, who was payingattention to her belonging to Colonel Lloyd.16[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos329616] The young man’sname was Ned Roberts, generally called Lloyd’s Ned. Why master was so careful ofher, may be safely left to conjecture. She was a woman of noble form, and ofgraceful proportions, having very few equals, and fewer superiors, in personalappearance, among the colored or white women of our neighborhood.Aunt Hester had not only disobeyed his orders in going out, but had been foundin company with Lloyd’s Ned; which circumstance, I found, from what he saidwhile whipping her, was the chief offence. Had he been a man of pure moralshimself, he might have been thought interested in protecting the innocence of myaunt; but those who knew him will not suspect him of any such virtue. Before hecommenced whipping Aunt Hester, he took her into the kitchen, and stripped herfrom neck to waist, leaving her neck, shoulders, and back, entirely naked. Hethen told her to cross her hands, calling her at the same time a d—d b—h. Aftercrossing her hands, he tied them with a strong rope, and led her to a stoolunder a large hook in the joist,aj[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos384454] put in for thepurpose. He made her get upon the stool, and tied her hands to the hook. She nowstood fair for his infernal purpose. Her arms were stretched up at their fulllength, so that she stood upon the ends of her toes. He then said to her, “Now,you d—d b—h, I’ll learn you how to disobey my orders!” and after rolling up hissleeves, he commenced to lay on the heavy cowskin, and soon the warm, red blood(amid heartrending shrieks from her, and horrid oaths from him) came dripping tothe floor. I was so terrified and horror-stricken at the sight, that I hidmyself in a closet, and dared not venture out till long after the bloodytransaction was over. I expected it would be my turn next. It was all new to me.I had never seen any thing like it before. I had always lived with mygrandmother on the outskirts of the plantation, where she was put to raise thechildren of the younger women. I had therefore been, until now, out of the wayof the bloody scenes that often occurred on the plantation."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER II[images/00009.jpg]MY MASTER’S FAMILY CONSISTED of two sons, Andrew and Richard; one daughter,Lucretia, and her husband, Captain Thomas Auld. They lived in one house, uponthe home plantation of Colonel Edward Lloyd. My master was Colonel Lloyd’s clerkand superintendent. He was what might be called the overseer of the overseers. Ispent two years of childhood on this plantation in my old master’s family. Itwas here that I witnessed the bloody transaction recorded in the first chapter;and as I received my first impressions of slavery on this plantation, I willgive some description of it, and of slavery as it there existed. The plantationis about twelve miles north of Easton, in Talbot county, and is situated on theborder of Miles River. The principal products raised upon it were tobacco, corn,and wheat. These were raised in great abundance; so that, with the products ofthis and the other farms belonging to him, he was able to keep in almostconstant employment a large sloop,ak[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos384688] in carrying themto market at Baltimore. This sloop was named Sally Lloyd, in honor of one of thecolonel’s daughters. My master’s son-in-law, Captain Auld, was master of thevessel; she was otherwise manned by the colonel’s own slaves. Their names werePeter, Isaac, Rich, and Jake. These were esteemed very highly by the otherslaves, and looked upon as the privileged ones of the plantation; for it was nosmall affair, in the eyes of the slaves, to be allowed to see Baltimore.Colonel Lloyd kept from three to four hundred slaves on his home plantation, andowned a large number more on the neighboring farms belonging to him. The namesof the farms nearest to the home plantation were Wye Town and New Design. “WyeTown” was under the overseership of a man named Noah Willis. New Design wasunder the overseership of a Mr. Townsend. The overseers of these, and all therest of the farms, numbering over twenty, received advice and direction from themanagers of the home plantation. This was the great business place. It was theseat of government for the whole twenty farms. All disputes among the overseerswere settled here. If a slave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, becameunmanageable, or evinced a determination to run away, he was brought immediatelyhere, severely whipped, put on board the sloop, carried to Baltimore, and soldto Austin Woolfolk, or some other slave-trader,17[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos329849] as a warning tothe slaves remaining.Here, too, the slaves of all the other farms received their monthly allowance offood, and their yearly clothing. The men and women slaves received, as theirmonthly allowance of food, eight pounds of pork, or its equivalent in fish, andone bushel of corn meal. Their yearly clothing consisted of two coarse linenshirts, one pair of linen trousers, like the shirts, one jacket, one pair oftrousers for winter, made of coarse negro cloth,al[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos384879] one pair ofstockings, and one pair of shoes; the whole of which could not have cost morethan seven dollars. The allowance of the slave children was given to theirmothers, or the old women having the care of them. The children unable to workin the field had neither shoes, stockings, jackets, nor trousers, given to them;their clothing consisted of two coarse linen shirts per year. When these failedthem, they went naked until the next allowance-day. Children from seven to tenyears old, of both sexes, almost naked, might be seen at all seasons of theyear.There were no beds given the slaves, unless one coarse blanket be consideredsuch, and none but the men and women had these. This, however, is not considereda very great privation. They find less difficulty from the want of beds, thanfrom the want of time to sleep; for when their day’s work in the field is done,the most of them having their washing, mending, and cooking to do, and havingfew or none of the ordinary facilities for doing either of these, very many oftheir sleeping hours are consumed in preparing for the field the coming day; andwhen this is done, old and young, male and female, married and single, drop downside by side, on one common bed,—the cold, damp floor,—each covering himself orherself with their miserable blankets; and here they sleep till they aresummoned to the field by the driver’s horn. At the sound of this, all must rise,and be off to the field. There must be no halting; every one must be at his orher post; and woe betides them who hear not this morning summons to the field;for if they are not awakened by the sense of hearing, they are by the sense offeeling: no age nor sex finds any favor. Mr. Severe, the overseer, used to standby the door of the quarter, armed with a large hickory stick and heavy cowskin,ready to whip any one who was so unfortunate as not to hear, or, from any othercause, was prevented from being ready to start for the field at the sound of thehorn.Mr. Severe was rightly named:18[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos330357] he was a cruelman. I have seen him whip a woman, causing the blood to run half an hour at thetime; and this, too, in the midst of her crying children, pleading for theirmother’s release. He seemed to take pleasure in manifesting his fiendishbarbarity. Added to his cruelty, he was a profane swearer. It was enough tochill the blood and stiffen the hair of an ordinary man to hear him talk. Scarcea sentence escaped him but that was commenced or concluded by some horrid oath.The field was the place to witness his cruelty and profanity. His presence madeit both the field of blood and of blasphemy. From the rising till the going downof the sun, he was cursing, raving, cutting, and slashing among the slaves ofthe field, in the most frightful manner. His career was short. He died very soonafter I went to Colonel Lloyd’s; and he died as he lived, uttering, with hisdying groans, bitter curses and horrid oaths. His death was regarded by theslaves as the result of a merciful Providence.Mr. Severe’s place was filled by a Mr. Hopkins. He was a very different man. Hewas less cruel, less profane, and made less noise, than Mr. Severe. His coursewas characterized by no extraordinary demonstrations of cruelty. He whipped, butseemed to take no pleasure in it. He was called by the slaves a good overseer.The home plantation of Colonel Lloyd wore the appearance of a country village.All the mechanical operations for all the farms were performed here. Theshoemaking and mending, the blacksmithing, cartwrighting, coopering,am[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos385129] weaving, andgrain-grinding, were all performed by the slaves on the home plantation. Thewhole place wore a business-like aspect very unlike the neighboring farms. Thenumber of houses, too, conspired to give it advantage over the neighboringfarms. It was called by the slaves the Great House Farm. Few privileges wereesteemed higher, by the slaves of the out-farms, than that of being selected todo errands at the Great House Farm. It was associated in their minds withgreatness. A representative could not be prouder of his election to a seat inthe American Congress, than a slave on one of the out-farms would be of hiselection to do errands at the Great House Farm. They regarded it as evidence ofgreat confidence reposed in them by their overseers; and it was on this account,as well as a constant desire to be out of the field from under the driver’slash, that they esteemed it a high privilege, one worth careful living for. Hewas called the smartest and most trusty fellow, who had this honor conferredupon him the most frequently. The competitors for this office sought asdiligently to please their overseers, as the office-seekers in the politicalparties seek to please and deceive the people. The same traits of charactermight be seen in Colonel Lloyd’s slaves, as are seen in the slaves of thepolitical parties.The slaves selected to go to the Great House Farm, for the monthly allowance forthemselves and their fellow-slaves, were peculiarly enthusiastic. While on theirway, they would make the dense old woods, for miles around, reverberate withtheir wild songs, revealing at once the highest joy and the deepest sadness.They would compose and sing as they went along, consulting neither time nortune. The thought that came up, came out—if not in the word, in the sound;—andas frequently in the one as in the other. They would sometimes sing the mostpathetic sentiment in the most rapturous tone, and the most rapturous sentimentin the most pathetic tone. Into all of their songs they would manage to weavesomething of the Great House Farm. Especially would they do this, when leavinghome. They would then sing most exultingly the following words:—> I am going away to the Great House Farm! O, yea! O, yea! O!This they would sing, as a chorus, to words which to many would seem unmeaningjargon, but which, nevertheless, were full of meaning to themselves. I havesometimes thought that the mere hearing of those songs would do more to impresssome minds with the horrible character of slavery, than the reading of wholevolumes of philosophy on the subject could do.I did not, when a slave, understand the deep meaning of those rude andapparently incoherent songs. I was myself within the circle; so that I neithersaw nor heard as those without might see and hear. They told a tale of woe whichwas then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension; they were tones loud, long,and deep; they breathed the prayer and complaint of souls boiling over with thebitterest anguish. Every tone was a testimony against slavery, and a prayer toGod for deliverance from chains. The hearing of those wild notes alwaysdepressed my spirit, and filled me with ineffable sadness. I have frequentlyfound myself in tears while hearing them. The mere recurrence to those songs,even now, afflicts me; and while I am writing these lines, an expression offeeling has already found its way down my cheek. To those songs I trace my firstglimmering conception of the dehumanizing character of slavery. I can never getrid of that conception. Those songs still follow me, to deepen my hatred ofslavery, and quicken my sympathies for my brethren in bonds. If any one wishesto be impressed with the soul-killing effects of slavery, let him go to ColonelLloyd’s plantation, and, on allowance-day, place himself in the deep pine woods,and there let him, in silence, analyze the sounds that shall pass through thechambers of his soul,—and if he is not thus impressed, it will only be because“there is no flesh in his obdurate heart.”an[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos385407]I have often been utterly astonished, since I came to the north, to find personswho could speak of the singing, among slaves, as evidence of their contentmentand happiness. It is impossible to conceive of a greater mistake. Slaves singmost when they are most unhappy. The songs of the slave represent the sorrows ofhis heart; and he is relieved by them, only as an aching heart is relieved byits tears. At least, such is my experience. I have often sung to drown mysorrow, but seldom to express my happiness. Crying for joy, and singing for joy,were alike uncommon to me while in the jaws of slav ery. The singing of a mancast away upon a desolate island might be as appropriately considered asevidence of contentment and happiness, as the singing of a slave; the songs ofthe one and of the other are prompted by the same emotion."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER III[images/00010.jpg]COLONEL LLOYD KEPT A large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded almostconstant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener, (Mr. M‘Durmond.)This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place. During the summermonths, people came from far and near—from Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis—tosee it. It abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy appleof the north to the delicate orange of the south. This garden was not the leastsource of trouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was quite a temptationto the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to thecolonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it. Scarcely a daypassed, during the summer, but that some slave had to take the lash for stealingfruit. The colonel had to resort to all kinds of stratagems to keep his slavesout of the garden. The last and most successful one was that of tarring hisfence all around; after which, if a slave was caught with any tar upon hisperson, it was deemed sufficient proof that he had either been into the garden,or had tried to get in. In either case, he was severely whipped by the chiefgardener. This plan worked well; the slaves became as fearful of tar as of thelash. They seemed to realize the impossibility of touching tar without beingdefiled.The colonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. His stable and carriage-housepresented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments. Hishorses were of the finest form and noblest blood. His carriage-house containedthree splendid coaches, three or four gigs, besides dearborns and barouches ofthe most fashionable style.19[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos330944]This establishment was under the care of two slaves—old Barney and youngBarney—father and son. To attend to this establishment was their sole work. Butit was by no means an easy employment; for in nothing was Colonel Lloyd moreparticular than in the management of his horses. The slightest inattention tothese was unpardonable, and was visited upon those, under whose care they wereplaced, with the severest punishment; no excuse could shield them, if thecolonel only suspected any want of attention to his horses—a supposition whichhe frequently indulged, and one which, of course, made the office of old andyoung Barney a very trying one. They never knew when they were safe frompunishment. They were frequently whipped when least deserving, and escapedwhipping when most deserving it. Every thing depended upon the looks of thehorses, and the state of Colonel Lloyd’s own mind when his horses were broughtto him for use. If a horse did not move fast enough, or hold his head highenough, it was owing to some fault of his keepers. It was painful to stand nearthe stable-door, and hear the various complaints against the keepers when ahorse was taken out for use. “This horse has not had proper attention. He hasnot been sufficiently rubbed and curried, ao[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos385662] or he has notbeen properly fed; his food was too wet or too dry; he got it too soon or toolate; he was too hot or too cold; he had too much hay, and not enough of grain;or he had too much grain, and not enough of hay; instead of old Barney’sattending to the horse, he had very improperly left it to his son.” To all thesecomplaints, no matter how unjust, the slave must answer never a word. ColonelLloyd could not brookap[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos385853] any contradictionfrom a slave. When he spoke, a slave must stand, listen, and tremble; and suchwas literally the case. I have seen Colonel Lloyd make old Barney, a man betweenfifty and sixty years of age, uncover his bald head, kneel down upon the cold,damp ground, and receive upon his naked and toil-worn shoulders more than thirtylashes at the time. Colonel Lloyd had three sons—Edward, Murray, and Daniel,—andthree sons-in-law, Mr. Winder, Mr. Nicholson, and Mr. Lowndes. All of theselived at the Great House Farm, and enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servantswhen they pleased,20[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos331727] from old Barneydown to William Wilkes, the coach-driver. I have seen Winder make one of thehouse-servants stand off from him a suitable distance to be touched with the endof his whip, and at every stroke raise great ridges upon his back.To describe the wealth of Colonel Lloyd would be almost equal to describing theriches of Job.aq [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos386024]He kept from ten to fifteen house-servants. He was said to own a thousandslaves, and I think this estimate quite within the truth. Colonel Lloyd owned somany that he did not know them when he saw them; nor did all the slaves of theout-farms know him. It is reported of him, that, while riding along the road oneday, he met a colored man, and addressed him in the usual manner of speaking tocolored people on the public highways of the south: “Well, boy, whom do youbelong to?” “To Colonel Lloyd,” replied the slave. “Well, does the colonel treatyou well?” “No, sir,” was the ready reply. “What, does he work you too hard?”“Yes, sir.” “Well, don’t he give you enough to eat?” “Yes, sir, he gives meenough, such as it is.”The colonel, after ascertaining where the slave belonged, rode on; the man alsowent on about his business, not dreaming that he had been conversing with hismaster. He thought, said, and heard nothing more of the matter, until two orthree weeks afterwards. The poor man was then informed by his overseer that, forhaving found fault with his master, he was now to be sold to a Georgia trader.He was immediately chained and handcuffed; and thus, without a moment’s warning,he was snatched away, and forever sundered,ar[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos386241] from his familyand friends, by a hand more unrelenting than death. This is the penalty oftelling the truth, of telling the simple truth, in answer to a series of plainquestions.It is partly in consequence of such facts, that slaves, when inquired of as totheir condition and the character of their masters, almost universally say theyare contented, and that their masters are kind. The slaveholders have been knownto send in spies among their slaves, to ascertain their views and feelings inregard to their condition. The frequency of this has had the effect to establishamong the slaves the maxim, that a still tongue makes a wise head. They suppressthe truth rather than take the consequences of telling it, and in so doing provethemselves a part of the human family. If they have any thing to say of theirmasters, it is generally in their masters’ favor, especially when speaking to anuntried man. I have been frequently asked, when a slave, if I had a kind master,and do not remember ever to have given a negative answer; nor did I, in pursuingthis course, consider myself as uttering what was absolutely false; for I alwaysmeasured the kindness of my master by the standard of kindness set up amongslaveholders around us. Moreover, slaves are like other people, and imbibeprejudices quite common to others. They think their own better than that ofothers. Many, under the influence of this prejudice, think their own masters arebetter than the masters of other slaves; and this, too, in some cases, when thevery reverse is true. Indeed, it is not uncommon for slaves even to fall out andquarrel among themselves about the relative goodness of their masters, eachcontending for the superior goodness of his own over that of the others. At thevery same time, they mutually execrate their masters when viewed separately. Itwas so on our plantation. When Colonel Lloyd’s slaves met the slaves of JacobJepson, they seldom parted without a quarrel about their masters; ColonelLloyd’s slaves contending that he was the richest, and Mr. Jepson’s slaves thathe was the smartest, and most of a man. Colonel Lloyd’s slaves would boast hisability to buy and sell Jacob Jepson. Mr. Jepson’s slaves would boast hisability to whip Colonel Lloyd. These quarrels would almost always end in a fightbetween the parties, and those that whipped were supposed to have gained thepoint at issue. They seemed to think that the greatness of their masters wastransferable to themselves. It was considered as being bad enough to be a slave;but to be a poor man’s slave was deemed a disgrace indeed!"},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IV[images/00011.jpg]MR. HOPKINS REMAINED BUT a short time in the office of overseer. Why his careerwas so short, I do not know, but suppose he lacked the necessary severity tosuit Colonel Lloyd. Mr. Hopkins was succeeded by Mr. Austin Gore, a manpossessing, in an eminent degree, all those traits of character indispensable towhat is called a first-rate overseer. Mr. Gore had served Colonel Lloyd, in thecapacity of overseer, upon one of the out-farms, and had shown himself worthy ofthe high station of overseer upon the home or Great House Farm.Mr. Gore was proud, ambitious, and persevering. He was artful, cruel, andobdurate. He was just the man for such a place, and it was just the place forsuch a man. It afforded scope for the full exercise of all his powers, and heseemed to be perfectly at home in it. He was one of those who could torture theslightest look, word, or gesture, on the part of the slave, into impudence, andwould treat it accordingly. There must be no answering back to him; noexplanation was allowed a slave, showing himself to have been wrongfullyaccused. Mr. Gore acted fully up to the maxim laid down by slaveholders,—“It isbetter that a dozen slaves suffer under the lash, than that the overseer shouldbe convicted, in the presence of the slaves, of having been at fault.” No matterhow innocent a slave might be—it availed him nothing, when accused by Mr. Goreof any misdemeanor. To be accused was to be convicted, and to be convicted wasto be punished; the one always following the other with immutable certainty. Toescape punishment was to escape accusation; and few slaves had the fortune to doeither, under the overseership of Mr. Gore. He was just proud enough to demandthe most debasing homage of the slave, and quite servile enough to crouch,himself, at the feet of the master. He was ambitious enough to be contented withnothing short of the highest rank of overseers, and persevering enough to reachthe height of his ambition. He was cruel enough to inflict the severestpunishment, artful enough to descend to the lowest trickery, and obdurate enoughto be insensible to the voice of a reproving conscience. He was, of all theoverseers, the most dreaded by the slaves. His presence was painful; his eyeflashed confusion; and seldom was his sharp, shrill voice heard, withoutproducing horror and trembling in their ranks.Mr. Gore was a grave man, and, though a young man, he indulged in no jokes, saidno funny words, seldom smiled. His words were in perfect keeping with his looks,and his looks were in perfect keeping with his words. Overseers will sometimesindulge in a witty word, even with the slaves; not so with Mr. Gore. He spokebut to command, and commanded but to be obeyed; he dealt sparingly with hiswords, and bountifully with his whip, never using the former where the latterwould answer as well. When he whipped, he seemed to do so from a sense of duty,and feared no consequences. He did nothing reluctantly, no matter howdisagreeable; always at his post, never inconsistent. He never promised but tofulfil. He was, in a word, a man of the most inflexible firmness and stone-likecoolness.His savage barbarity was equalled only by the consummate coolness with which hecommitted the grossest and most savage deeds upon the slaves under his charge.Mr. Gore once undertook to whip one of Colonel Lloyd’s slaves, by the name ofDemby. He had given Demby but few stripes, when, to get rid of the scourging, heran and plunged himself into a creek, and stood there at the depth of hisshoulders, refusing to come out. Mr. Gore told him that he would give him threecalls, and that, if he did not come out at the third call, he would shoot him.The first call was given. Demby made no response, but stood his ground. Thesecond and third calls were given with the same result. Mr. Gore then, withoutconsultation or deliberation with any one, not even giving Demby an additionalcall, raised his musket to his face, taking deadly aim at his standing victim,and in an instant poor Demby was no more. His mangled body sank out of sight,and blood and brains marked the water where he had stood.A thrill of horror flashed through every soul upon the plantation, excepting Mr.Gore. He alone seemed cool and collected. He was asked by Colonel Lloyd and myold master, why he resorted to this extraordinary expedient. His reply was, (aswell as I can remember,) that Demby had become unmanageable. He was setting adangerous example to the other slaves,—one which, if suffered to pass withoutsome such demonstration on his part, would finally lead to the total subversionof all rule and order upon the plantation. He argued that if one slave refusedto be corrected, and escaped with his life, the other slaves would soon copy theexample; the result of which would be, the freedom of the slaves, and theenslavement of the whites. Mr. Gore’s defence was satisfactory. He was continuedin his station as overseer upon the home plantation. His fame as an overseerwent abroad. His horrid crime was not even submitted to judicial investigation.It was committed in the presence of slaves, and they of course could neitherinstitute a suit, nor testify against him; and thus the guilty perpetrator ofone of the bloodiest and most foul murders goes unwhipped of justice, anduncensured by the community in which he lives. Mr. Gore lived in St. Michael‘s,Talbot county, Maryland, when I left there; and if he is still alive, he veryprobably lives there now; and if so, he is now, as he was then, as highlyesteemed and as much respected as though his guilty soul had not been stainedwith his brother’s blood.I speak advisedly when I say this,—that killing a slave, or any colored person,in Talbot county, Maryland, is not treated as a crime, either by the courts orthe community. Mr. Thomas Lanman, of St. Michael‘s, killed two slaves, one ofwhom he killed with a hatchet, by knocking his brains out. He used to boast ofthe commission of the awful and bloody deed. I have heard him do so laughingly,saying, among other things, that he was the only benefactor of his country inthe company, and that when others would do as much as he had done, we should berelieved of “the d—d niggers.”The wife of Mr. Giles Hick, living but a short distance from where I used tolive, murdered my wife’s cousin, a young girl between fifteen and sixteen yearsof age, mangling her person in the most horrible manner, breaking her nose andbreastbone with a stick, so that the poor girl expired in a few hours afterward.She was immediately buried, but had not been in her untimely grave but a fewhours before she was taken up and examined by the coroner, who decided that shehad come to her death by severe beating. The offence for which this girl wasthus murdered was this:—She had been set that night to mind Mrs. Hick’s baby,and during the night she fell asleep, and the baby cried. She, having lost herrest for several nights previous, did not hear the crying. They were both in theroom with Mrs. Hicks. Mrs. Hicks, finding the girl slow to move, jumped from herbed, seized an oak stick of wood by the fireplace, and with it broke the girl’snose and breastbone, and thus ended her life. I will not say that this mosthorrid murder produced no sensation in the community. It did produce sensation,but not enough to bring the murderess to punishment. There was a warrant issuedfor her arrest, but it was never served. Thus she escaped not only punishment,but even the pain of being arraignedas[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos386413] before a courtfor her horrid crime.Whilst I am detailing bloody deeds which took place during my stay on ColonelLloyd’s plantation, I will briefly narrate another, which occurred about thesame time as the murder of Demby by Mr. Gore.Colonel Lloyd’s slaves were in the habit of spending a part of their nights andSundays in fishing for oysters, and in this way made up the deficiency of theirscanty allowance. An old man belonging to Colonel Lloyd, while thus engaged,happened to get beyond the limits of Colonel Lloyd‘s, and on the premises of Mr.Beal Bondly. At this trespass, Mr. Bondly took offence, and with his musket camedown to the shore, and blew its deadly contents into the poor old man.Mr. Bondly came over to see Colonel Lloyd the next day, whether to pay him forhis property, or to justify himself in what he had done, I know not. At anyrate, this whole fiendish transaction was soon hushed up. There was very littlesaid about it at all, and nothing done. It was a common saying, even amonglittle white boys, that it was worth a half-cent to kill a “nigger,” and ahalf-cent to bury one."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER V[images/00012.jpg]As TO MY OWN treatment while I lived on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation, it was verysimilar to that of the other slave children. I was not old enough to work in thefield, and there being little else than field work to do, I had a great deal ofleisure time. The most I had to do was to drive up the cows at evening, keep thefowls out of the garden, keep the front yard clean, and run of errands for myold master’s daughter, Mrs. Lucretia Auld. The most of my leisure time I spentin helping Master Daniel Lloyd in finding his birds, after he had shot them. Myconnection with Master Daniel was of some advantage to me. He became quiteattached to me, and was a sort of protector of me. He would not allow the olderboys to impose upon me, and would divide his cakes with me.I was seldom whipped by my old master, and suffered little from any thing elsethan hunger and cold. I suffered much from hunger, but much more from cold. Inhottest summer and coldest winter, I was kept almost naked—no shoes, nostockings, no jacket, no trousers, nothing on but a coarse tow linen shirt,reaching only to my knees. I had no bed. I must have perished with cold, butthat, the coldest nights, I used to steal a bag which was used for carrying cornto the mill. I would crawl into this bag, and there sleep on the cold, damp,clay floor, with my head in and feet out. My feet have been so cracked with thefrost, that the pen with which I am writing might be laid in the gashes.21[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos332038]We were not regularly allowanced. Our food was coarse corn meal boiled. This wascalled mush. It was put into a large wooden tray or trough, and set down uponthe ground. The children were then called, like so many pigs, and like so manypigs they would come and devour the mush; some with oystershells, others withpieces of shingle, some with naked hands, and none with spoons. He that atefastest got most; he that was strongest secured the best place; and few left thetrough satisfied.I was probably between seven and eight years old when I left Colonel Lloyd’splantation. I left it with joy. I shall never forget the ecstasy with which Ireceived the intelligence that my old master (Anthony) had determined to let mego to Baltimore, to live with Mr. Hugh Auld, brother to my old master’sson-in-law, Captain Thomas Auld. I received this information about three daysbefore my departure. They were three of the happiest days I ever enjoyed. Ispent the most part of all these three days in the creek, washing off theplantation scurf,at[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos386622] and preparingmyself for my departure.22[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos332604]The pride of appearance which this would indicate was not my own. I spent thetime in washing, not so much because I wished to, but because Mrs. Lucretia hadtold me I must get all the dead skin off my feet and knees before I could go toBaltimore; for the people in Baltimore were very cleanly, and would laugh at meif I looked dirty. Besides, she was going to give me a pair of trousers, which Ishould not put on unless I got all the dirt off me. The thought of owning a pairof trousers was great indeed! It was almost a sufficient motive, not only tomake me take off what would be called by pig droversau[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos386800] the mangel,av[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos386993] but the skinitself. I went at it in good earnest, working for the first time with the hopeof reward.The ties that ordinarily bind children to their homes were all suspended in mycase. I found no severe trial in my departure. My home was charmless; it was nothome to me; on parting from it, I could not feel that I was leaving any thingwhich I could have enjoyed by staying. My mother was dead, my grandmother livedfar off, so that I seldom saw her. I had two sisters and one brother, that livedin the same house with me; but the early separation of us from our mother hadwell nigh blotted the fact of our relationship from our memories. I looked forhome elsewhere, and was confident of finding none which I should relish lessthan the one which I was leaving. If, however, I found in my new home hardship,hunger, whipping, and nakedness, I had the consolation that I should not haveescaped any one of them by staying. Having already had more than a taste of themin the house of my old master, and having endured them there, I very naturallyinferred my ability to endure them elsewhere, and especially at Baltimore; for Ihad something of the feeling about Baltimore that is expressed in the proverb,that “being hanged in England is preferable to dying a natural death inIreland.” I had the strongest desire to see Baltimore. Cousin Tom, though notfluent in speech, had inspired me with that desire by his eloquent descriptionof the place. I could never point out any thing at the Great House, no matterhow beautiful or powerful, but that he had seen something at Baltimore farexceeding, both in beauty and strength, the object which I pointed out to him.Even the Great House itself, with all its pictures, was far inferior to manybuildings in Baltimore. So strong was my desire, that I thought a gratificationof it would fully compensate for whatever loss of comforts I should sustain bythe exchange. I left without a regret, and with the highest hopes of futurehappiness.We sailed out of Miles River for Baltimore on a Saturday morning. I rememberonly the day of the week, for at that time I had no knowledge of the days of themonth, nor the months of the year. On setting sail, I walked aft,aw[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos387201] and gave toColonel Lloyd’s plantation what I hoped would be the last look. I then placedmyself in the bowsax[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos387387] of the sloop, andthere spent the remainder of the day in looking ahead, interesting myself inwhat was in the distance rather than in things near by or behind.In the afternoon of that day, we reached Annapolis, the capital of the State. Westopped but a few moments, so that I had no time to go on shore. It was thefirst large town that I had ever seen, and though it would look small comparedwith some of our New England factory villages, I thought it a wonderful placefor its size—more imposing even than the Great House Farm!We arrived at Baltimore early on Sunday morning, landing at Smith’s Wharf, notfar from Bowley’s Wharf We had on board the sloop a large flock of sheep; andafter aiding in driving them to the slaughterhouse of Mr. Curtis on LoudenSlater’s Hill, I was conducted by Rich, one of the hands belonging on board ofthe sloop, to my new home in Alliciana Street, near Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard, onFells Point.Mr. and Mrs. Auld were both at home, and met me at the door with their littleson Thomas, to take care of whom I had been given. And here I saw what I hadnever seen before; it was a white face beaming with the most kindly emotions; itwas the face of my new mistress, Sophia Auld. I wish I could describe therapture that flashed through my soul as I beheld it. It was a new and strangesight to me, brightening up my pathway with the light of happiness. LittleThomas was told, there was his Freddy,—and I was told to take care of littleThomas; and thus I entered upon the duties of my new home with the most cheeringprospect ahead.I look upon my departure from Colonel Lloyd’s plantation as one of the mostinteresting events of my life. It is possible, and even quite probable, that butfor the mere circumstance of being removed from that plantation to Baltimore, Ishould have to-day, instead of being here seated by my own table, in theenjoyment of freedom and the happiness of home, writing this Narrative, beenconfined in the galling chains of slavery. Going to live at Baltimore laid thefoundation, and opened the gateway, to all my subsequent prosperity. I have everregarded it as the first plain manifestation of that kind providence which hasever since attended me, and marked my life with so many favors. I regarded theselection of myself as being somewhat remarkable. There were a number of slavechildren that might have been sent from the plantation to Baltimore. There werethose younger, those older, and those of the same age. I was chosen from amongthem all, and was the first, last, and only choice.I may be deemed superstitious, and even egotistical, in regarding this event asa special interposition of divine Providence in my favor. But I should be falseto the earliest sentiments of my soul, if I suppressed the opinion. I prefer tobe true to myself, even at the hazard of incurring the ridicule of others,rather than to be false, and incur my own abhorrence. From my earliestrecollection, I date the entertainment of a deep conviction that slavery wouldnot always be able to hold me within its foul embrace; and in the darkest hoursof my career in slavery, this living word of faith and spirit of hope departednot from me, but remained like ministering angels to cheer me through the gloom.This good spirit was from God, and to him I offer thanksgiving and praise."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VI[images/00013.jpg]MY NEW MISTRESS PROVED to be all she appeared when I first met her at thedoor,—a woman of the kindest heart and finest feelings. She had never had aslave under her control previously to myself, and prior to her marriage she hadbeen dependent upon her own industry for a living. She was by trade a weaver;and by constant application to her business, she had been in a good degreepreserved from the blighting and dehumanizing effects of slavery. I was utterlyastonished at her goodness. I scarcely knew how to behave towards her. She wasentirely unlike any other white woman I had ever seen. I could not approach heras I was accustomed to approach other white ladies. My early instruction was allout of place. The crouching servility, usually so acceptable a quality in aslave, did not answer when manifested toward her. Her favor was not gained byit; she seemed to be disturbed by it. She did not deem it impudent or unmannerlyfor a slave to look her in the face. The meanest slave was put fully at ease inher presence, and none left without feeling better for having seen her. Her facewas made of heavenly smiles, and her voice of tranquil music.But, alas! this kind heart had but a short time to remain such. The fatal poisonof irresponsible power was already in her hands, and soon commenced its infernalwork. That cheerful eye, under the influence of slavery, soon became red withrage; that voice, made all of sweet accord, changed to one of harsh and horriddiscord; and that angelic face gave place to that of a demon.Very soon after I went to live with Mr. and Mrs. Auld, she very kindly commencedto teach me the A, B, C. After I had learned this, she assisted me in learningto spell words of three or four letters. Just at this point of my progress, Mr.Auld found out what was going on, and at once forbade Mrs. Auld to instruct mefurther, telling her, among other things, that it was unlawful, as well asunsafe, to teach a slave to read. To use his own words further, he said, “If yougive a nigger an inch, he will take an ell.ay[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos387592] A nigger shouldknow nothing but to obey his master—to do as he is told to do. Learning wouldspoil the best nigger in the world. Now,” said he, “if you teach that nigger(speaking of myself) how to read, there would be no keeping him. It wouldforever unfit him to be a slave. He would at once become unmanageable, and of novalue to his master. As to himself, it could do him no good, but a great deal ofharm. It would make him discontented and unhappy.” These words sank deep into myheart, stirred up sentiments within that lay slumbering, and called intoexistence an entirely new train of thought. It was a new and special revelation,explaining dark and mysterious things, with which my youthful understanding hadstruggled, but struggled in vain. I now understood what had been to me a mostperplexing difficulty—to wit, the white man’s power to enslave the black man. Itwas a grand achievement, and I prized it highly. From that moment, I understoodthe pathway from slavery to freedom. It was just what I wanted, and I got it ata time when I the least expected it. Whilst I was saddened by the thought oflosing the aid of my kind mistress, I was gladdened by the invaluableinstruction which, by the merest accident, I had gained from my master. Thoughconscious of the difficulty of learning without a teacher, I set out with highhope, and a fixed purpose, at whatever cost of trouble, to learn how to read.The very decided manner with which he spoke, and strove to impress his wife withthe evil consequences of giving me instruction, served to convince me that hewas deeply sensible of the truths he was uttering. It gave me the best assurancethat I might rely with the utmost confidence on the results which, he said,would flow from teaching me to read. What he most dreaded, that I most desired.What he most loved, that I most hated. That which to him was a great evil, to becarefully shunned, was to me a great good, to be diligently sought; and theargument which he so warmly urged, against my learning to read, only served toinspire me with a desire and determination to learn. In learning to read, I owealmost as much to the bitter opposition of my master, as to the kindly aid of mymistress. I acknowledge the benefit of both.I had resided but a short time in Baltimore23[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos332960] before I observeda marked difference, in the treatment of slaves, from that which I had witnessedin the country. A city slave is almost a freeman, compared with a slave on theplantation. He is much better fed and clothed, and enjoys privileges altogetherunknown to the slave on the plantation. There is a vestige of decency, a senseof shame, that does much to curb and check those outbreaks of atrocious crueltyso commonly enacted upon the plantation. He is a desperate slaveholder, who willshock the humanity of his nonslaveholding neighbors with the cries of hislacerated slave. Few are willing to incur the odium attaching to the reputationof being a cruel master; and above all things, they would not be known as notgiving a slave enough to eat. Every city slaveholder is anxious to have it knownof him, that he feeds his slaves well; and it is due to them to say, that mostof them do give their slaves enough to eat. There are, however, some painfulexceptions to this rule. Directly opposite to us, on Philpot Street, lived Mr.Thomas Hamilton. He owned two slaves. Their names were Henrietta and Mary.Henrietta was about twenty-two years of age, Mary was about fourteen; and of allthe mangled and emaciated creatures I ever looked upon, these two were the mostso. His heart must be harder than stone, that could look upon these unmoved. Thehead, neck, and shoulders of Mary were literally cut to pieces. I havefrequently felt her head, and found it nearly covered with festering sores,caused by the lash of her cruel mistress. I do not know that her master everwhipped her, but I have been an eye-witness to the cruelty of Mrs. Hamilton. Iused to be in Mr. Hamilton’s house nearly every day. Mrs. Hamilton used to sitin a large chair in the middle of the room, with a heavy cowskin always by herside, and scarce an hour passed during the day but was marked by the blood ofone of these slaves. The girls seldom passed her without her saying, “Movefaster, you black gip!”az[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos387836] at the same timegiving them a blow with the cowskin over the head or shoulders, often drawingthe blood. She would then say, “Take that, you black gip!”—continuing, “If youdon’t move faster, I’ll move you!” Added to the cruel lashings to which theseslaves were subjected, they were kept nearly half-starved. They seldom knew whatit was to eat a full meal. I have seen Mary contending with the pigs for theoffalba [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos388004] throwninto the street. So much was Mary kicked and cut to pieces, that she was oftenercalled “pecked” than by her name."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VII[images/00014.jpg]I LIVED IN MASTER Hugh’s family about seven years. During this time, I succeededin learning to read and write. In accomplishing this, I was compelled to resortto various stratagems. I had no regular teacher. My mistress, who had kindlycommenced to instruct me, had, in compliance with the advice and direction ofher husband, not only ceased to instruct, but had set her face against my beinginstructed by any one else. It is due, however, to my mistress to say of her,that she did not adopt this course of treatment immediately. She at first lackedthe depravity indispensable to shutting me up in mental darkness. It was atleast necessary for her to have some training in the exercise of irresponsiblepower, to make her equal to the task of treating me as though I were a brute.My mistress was, as I have said, a kind and tender-hearted woman; and in thesimplicity of her soul she commenced, when I first went to live with her, totreat me as she supposed one human being ought to treat another. In enteringupon the duties of a slave holder, she did not seem to perceive that I sustainedto her the relation of a mere chattel, and that for her to treat me as a humanbeing was not only wrong, but dangerously so. Slavery proved as injurious to heras it did to me.24[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos333236] When I wentthere, she was a pious, warm, and tender-hearted woman. There was no sorrow orsuffering for which she had not a tear. She had bread for the hungry, clothesfor the naked, and comfort for every mourner that came within her reach. Slaverysoon proved its ability to divest her of these heavenly qualities. Under itsinfluence, the tender heart became stone, and the lamb-like disposition gave wayto one of tiger-like fierceness. The first step in her downward course was inher ceasing to instruct me. She now commenced to practise her husband’sprecepts. She finally became even more violent in her opposition than herhusband himself. She was not satisfied with simply doing as well as he hadcommanded; she seemed anxious to do better. Nothing seemed to make her moreangry than to see me with a newspaper. She seemed to think that here lay thedanger. I have had her rush at me with a face made all up of fury, and snatchfrom me a newspaper, in a manner that fully revealed her apprehension. She wasan apt woman; and a little experience soon demonstrated, to her satisfaction,that education and slavery were incompatible with each other.From this time I was most narrowly watched. If I was in a separate room anyconsiderable length of time, I was sure to be suspected of having a book, andwas at once called to give an account of myself. All this, however, was toolate. The first step had been taken. Mistress, in teaching me the alphabet, hadgiven me the inch, and no precaution could prevent me from taking the ell.The plan which I adopted, and the one by which I was most successful, was thatof making friends of all the little white boys whom I met in the street. As manyof these as I could, I converted into teachers. With their kindly aid, obtainedat different times and in different places, I finally succeeded in learning toread. When I was sent of errands, I always took my book with me, and by goingone part of my errand quickly, I found time to get a lesson before my return. Iused also to carry bread with me, enough of which was always in the house, andto which I was always welcome; for I was much better off in this regard thanmany of the poor white children in our neighborhood. This bread I used to bestowupon the hungry little urchins, who, in return, would give me that more valuablebread of knowledge. I am strongly tempted to give the names of two or three ofthose little boys, as a testimonial of the gratitude and affection I bear them;but prudence forbids;—not that it would injure me, but it might embarrass them;for it is almost an unpardonable offence to teach slaves to read in thisChristian country. It is enough to say of the dear little fellows, that theylived on Philpot Street, very near Durgin and Bailey’s ship-yard. I used to talkthis matter of slavery over with them. I would sometimes say to them, I wished Icould be as free as they would be when they got to be men. “You will be free assoon as you are twenty-one, but I am a slave for life! Have not I as good aright to be free as you have?” These words used to trouble them; they wouldexpress for me the liveliest sympathy, and console me with the hope thatsomething would occur by which I might be free.I was now about twelve years old, and the thought of being a slave for lifebegan to bear heavily upon my heart. Just about this time, I got hold of a bookentitled “The Columbian Orator.”25[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos333556] Every opportunityI got, I used to read this book. Among much of other interesting matter, I foundin it a dialogue between a master and his slave. The slave was represented ashaving run away from his master three times. The dialogue represented theconversation which took place between them, when the slave was retaken the thirdtime. In this dialogue, the whole argument in behalf of slavery was broughtforward by the master, all of which was disposed of by the slave. The slave wasmade to say some very smart as well as impressive things in reply to hismaster—things which had the desired though unexpected effect; for theconversation resulted in the voluntary emancipation of the slave on the part ofthe master.In the same book, I met with one of Sheridan’s mighty speeches on and in behalfof Catholic emancipation.26[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos334589] These were choicedocuments to me. I read them over and over again with unabated interest. Theygave tongue to interesting thoughts of my own soul, which had frequently flashedthrough my mind, and died away for want of utterance. The moral which I gainedfrom the dialogue was the power of truth over the conscience of even aslaveholder. What I got from Sheridan was a bold denunciation of slavery, and apowerful vindication of human rights. The reading of these documents enabled meto utter my thoughts, and to meet the arguments brought forward to sustainslavery; but while they relieved me of one difficulty, they brought on anothereven more painful than the one of which I was relieved. The more I read, themore I was led to abhor and detest my enslavers. I could regard them in no otherlight than a band of successful robbers, who had left their homes, and gone toAfrica, and stolen us from our homes, and in a strange land reduced us toslavery. I loathed them as being the meanest as well as the most wicked of men.As I read and contemplated the subject, behold! that very discontentment whichMaster Hugh had predicted would follow my learning to read had already come, totorment and sting my soul to unutterable anguish. As I writhed under it, I wouldat times feel that learning to read had been a curse rather than a blessing. Ithad given me a view of my wretched condition, without the remedy. It opened myeyes to the horrible pit, but to no ladder upon which to get out. In moments ofagony, I envied my fellow-slaves for their stupidity. I have often wished myselfa beast. I preferred the condition of the meanest reptile to my own. Any thing,no matter what, to get rid of thinking! It was this everlasting thinking of mycondition that tormented me. There was no getting rid of it. It was pressed uponme by every object within sight or hearing, animate or inanimate. The silvertrump of freedom had roused my soul to eternal wakefulness. Freedom nowappeared, to disappear no more forever. It was heard in every sound, and seen inevery thing. It was ever present to torment me with a sense of my wretchedcondition. I saw nothing without seeing it, I heard nothing without hearing it,and felt nothing without feeling it. It looked from every star, it smiled inevery calm, breathed in every wind, and moved in every storm.I often found myself regretting my own existence, and wishing myself dead; andbut for the hope of being free, I have no doubt but that I should have killedmyself, or done something for which I should have been killed. While in thisstate of mind, I was eager to hear any one speak of slavery. I was a readylistener. Every little while, I could hear something about the abolitionists. Itwas some time before I found what the word meant. It was always used in suchconnections as to make it an interesting word to me. If a slave ran away andsucceeded in getting clear, or if a slave killed his master, set fire to a barn,or did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spoken of asthe fruit of abolition.27[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos335087] Hearing the wordin this connection very often, I set about learning what it meant. Thedictionary afforded me little or no help. I found it was “the act ofabolishing;” but then I did not know what was to be abolished. Here I wasperplexed. I did not dare to ask any one about its meaning, for I was satisfiedthat it was something they wanted me to know very little about. After a patientwaiting, I got one of our city papers, containing an account of the number ofpetitions from the north, praying for the abolition of slavery in the Districtof Columbia, and of the slave trade between the States. From this time Iunderstood the words abolition and abolitionist, and always drew near when thatword was spoken, expecting to hear something of importance to myself andfellow-slaves. The light broke in upon me by degrees. I went one day down on thewharf of Mr. Waters; and seeing two Irishmen unloading a scowbb[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos388218] of stone, I went,unasked, and helped them. When we had finished, one of them came to me and askedme if I were a slave. I told him I was. He asked, “Are ye a slave for life?” Itold him that I was. The good Irishman seemed to be deeply affected by thestatement. He said to the other that it was a pity so fine a little fellow asmyself should be a slave for life. He said it was a shame to hold me. They bothadvised me to run away to the north; that I should find friends there, and thatI should be free. I pretended not to be interested in what they said, andtreated them as if I did not understand them; for I feared they might betreacherous. White men have been known to encourage slaves to escape, and then,to get the reward, catch them and return them to their masters. I was afraidthat these seemingly good men might use me so; but I nevertheless rememberedtheir advice, and from that time I resolved to run away. I looked forward to atime at which it would be safe for me to escape. I was too young to think ofdoing so immediately; besides, I wished to learn how to write, as I might haveoccasion to write my own pass. I consoled myself with the hope that I should oneday find a good chance. Meanwhile, I would learn to write.The idea as to how I might learn to write was suggested to me by being in Durginand Bailey’s ship-yard, and frequently seeing the ship carpenters, after hewing,and getting a piece of timber ready for use, write on the timber the name ofthat part of the ship for which it was intended. When a piece of timber wasintended for the larboard side,bc[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos388438] it would bemarked thus—“L.” When a piece was for the starboard side, it would be markedthus—“S.” A piece for the larboard side forward, would be marked thus—“L.F.”Whena piece was for starboard side forward, it would be marked thus—“S.F.” Forlarboard aft, it would be marked thus—“L.A.” For starboard aft, it would bemarked thus—“S.A.” I soon learned the names of these letters, and for what theywere intended when placed upon a piece of timber in the ship-yard. I immediatelycommenced copying them, and in a short time was able to make the four lettersnamed. After that, when I met with any boy who I knew could write, I would tellhim I could write as well as he. The next word would be, “I don’t believe you.Let me see you try it.” I would then make the letters which I had been sofortunate as to learn, and ask him to beat that. In this way I got a good manylessons in writing, which it is quite possible I should never have gotten in anyother way. During this time, my copy-book was the board fence, brick wall, andpavement; my pen and ink was a lump of chalk. With these, I learned mainly howto write. I then commenced and continued copying the Italics in Webster’sSpelling Book,bd [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos388709]until I could make them all without looking on the book. By this time, my littleMaster Thomas had gone to school, and learned how to write, and had written overa number of copy-books. These had been brought home, and shown to some of ournear neighbors, and then laid aside. My mistress used to go to class meetingbe[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos388953] at the WilkStreet meetinghouse every Monday afternoon, and leave me to take care of thehouse. When left thus, I used to spend the time in writing in the spaces left inMaster Thomas’s copy-book, copying what he had written. I continued to do thisuntil I could write a hand very similar to that of Master Thomas. Thus, after along, tedious effort for years, I finally succeeded in learning how to write."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER VIII[images/00001.jpg]IN A VERY SHORT time after I went to live at Baltimore, my old master’s youngestson Richard died; and in about three years and six months after his death, myold master, Captain Anthony, died, leaving only his son, Andrew, and daughter,Lucretia, to share his estate. He died while on a visit to see his daughter atHillsborough. Cut off thus unexpectedly, he left no will as to the disposal ofhis property. It was therefore necessary to have a valuation of the property,that it might be equally divided between Mrs. Lucretia and Master Andrew. I wasimmediately sent for, to be valued with the other property. Here again myfeelings rose up in detestation of slavery. I had now a new conception of mydegraded condition. Prior to this, I had become, if not insensible to my lot, atleast partly so. I left Baltimore with a young heart overborne with sadness, anda soul full of apprehension. I took passage with Captain Rowe, in the schoonerWild Cat, and, after a sail of about twenty-four hours, I found myself near theplace of my birth. I had now been absent from it almost, if not quite, fiveyears. I, however, remembered the place very well. I was only about five yearsold when I left it, to go and live with my old master on Colonel Lloyd’splantation; so that I was now between ten and eleven years old.We were all ranked together at the valuation. Men and women, old and young,married and single, were ranked with horses, sheep, and swine. There were horsesand men, cattle and women, pigs and children, all holding the same rank in thescale of being, and were all subjected to the same narrow examination.Silvery-headed age and sprightly youth, maids and matrons, had to undergo thesame indelicate inspection. At this moment, I saw more clearly than ever thebrutalizing effects of slavery upon both slave and slaveholder.After the valuation, then came the division. I have no language to express thehigh excitement and deep anxiety which were felt among us poor slaves duringthis time. Our fate for life was now to be decided. We had no more voice in thatdecision than the brutes among whom we were ranked. A single word from the whitemen was enough—against all our wishes, prayers, and entreaties—to sunder foreverthe dearest friends, dearest kindred, and strongest ties known to human beings.In addition to the pain of separation, there was the horrid dread of fallinginto the hands of Master Andrew. He was known to us all as being a most cruelwretch,—a common drunkard, who had, by his reckless mismanagement and profligatedissipation, already wasted a large portion of his father’s property. We allfelt that we might as well be sold at once to the Georgia traders, as to passinto his hands; for we knew that that would be our inevitable condition, —acondition held by us all in the utmost horror and dread.I suffered more anxiety than most of my fellow-slaves. I had known what it wasto be kindly treated; they had known nothing of the kind. They had seen littleor nothing of the world. They were in very deed men and women of sorrow, andacquainted with grief. Their backs had been made familiar with the bloody lash,so that they had become callous; mine was yet tender; for while at Baltimore Igot few whippings, and few slaves could boast of a kinder master and mistressthan myself; and the thought of passing out of their hands into those of MasterAndrew—a man who, but a few days before, to give me a sample of his bloodydisposition, took my little brother by the throat, threw him on the ground, andwith the heel of his boot stamped upon his head till the blood gushed from hisnose and ears—was well calculated to make me anxious as to my fate. After he hadcommitted this savage outrage upon my brother, he turned to me, and said thatwas the way he meant to serve me one of these days,—meaning, I suppose, when Icame into his possession.Thanks to a kind Providence, I fell to the portion of Mrs. Lucretia, and wassent immediately back to Baltimore, to live again in the family of Master Hugh.Their joy at my return equalled their sorrow at my departure. It was a glad dayto me. I had escaped a worse than lion’s jaws. I was absent from Baltimore, forthe purpose of valuation and division, just about one month, and it seemed tohave been six.Very soon after my return to Baltimore, my mistress, Lucretia, died, leaving herhusband and one child, Amanda; and in a very short time after her death, MasterAndrew died. Now all the property of my old master, slaves included, was in thehands of strangers,—strangers who had had nothing to do with accumulating it.Not a slave was left free. All remained slaves, from the youngest to the oldest.If any one thing in my experience, more than another, served to deepen myconviction of the infernal character of slavery, and to fill me with unutterableloathing of slaveholders, it was their base ingratitude to my poor oldgrandmother. She had served my old master faithfully from youth to old age. Shehad been the source of all his wealth; she had peopled his plantation withslaves; she had become a great grandmother in his service. She had rocked him ininfancy, attended him in childhood, served him through life, and at his deathwiped from his icy brow the cold death-sweat, and closed his eyes forever. Shewas nevertheless left a slave—a slave for life—a slave in the hands ofstrangers; and in their hands she saw her children, her grandchildren, and hergreat-grandchildren, divided, like so many sheep,28[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos335536] without beinggratified with the small privilege of a single word, as to their or her owndestiny. And, to cap the climax of their base ingratitude and fiendishbarbarity, my grandmother, who was now very old, having outlived my old masterand all his children, having seen the beginning and end of all of them, and herpresent owners finding she was of but little value, her frame already rackedwith the pains of old age, and complete helplessness fast stealing over her onceactive limbs, they took her to the woods, built her a little hut, put up alittle mud-chimney, and then made her welcome to the privilege of supportingherself there in perfect loneliness; thus virtually turning her out to die! Ifmy poor old grandmother now lives, she lives to suffer in utter loneliness; shelives to remember and mourn over the loss of children, the loss ofgrandchildren, and the loss of great-grandchildren. They are, in the language ofthe slave’s poet, Whittier,—> Gone, gone, sold and gone> To the rice swamp dank and lone,> Where the slave-whip ceaseless swings,> Where the noisomebf> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos389122] insect stings,> Where the fever-demon strews> Poison with the falling dews,> Where the sickly sunbeams glare> Through the hot and misty air:—> Gone, gone, sold and gone> To the rice swamp dank and lone,> From Virginia hills and waters—> Woe is me, my stolen daughters!bg> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos389303]The hearth is desolate. The children, the unconscious children, who once sangand danced in her presence, are gone. She gropes her way, in the darkness ofage, for a drink of water. Instead of the voices of her children, she hears byday the moans of the dove, and by night the screams of the hideous owl. All isgloom. The grave is at the door. And now, when weighed down by the pains andaches of old age, when the head inclines to the feet, when the beginning andending of human existence meet, and helpless infancy and painful old age combinetogether—at this time, this most needful time, the time for the exercise of thattenderness and affection which children only can exercise towards a decliningparent—my poor old grandmother, the devoted mother of twelve children, is leftall alone, in yonder little hut, before a few dim embers. She stands—shesits—she staggers—she falls—she groans—she dies—and there are none of herchildren or grandchildren present, to wipe from her wrinkled brow the cold sweatof death, or to place beneath the sod her fallen remains. Will not a righteousGod visit for these things?bh[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos389560]In about two years after the death of Mrs. Lucretia, Master Thomas married hissecond wife. Her name was Rowena Hamilton. She was the eldest daughter of Mr.William Hamilton. Master now lived in St. Michael’s.29[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos336208] Not long afterhis marriage, a misunderstanding took place between himself and Master Hugh; andas a means of punishing his brother, he took me from him to live with himself atSt. Michael’s. Here I underwent another most painful separation. It, however,was not so severe as the one I dreaded at the division of property; for, duringthis interval, a great change had taken place in Master Hugh and his once kindand affectionate wife. The influence of brandy upon him, and of slavery uponher, had effected a disastrous change in the characters of both; so that, as faras they were concerned, I thought I had little to lose by the change. But it wasnot to them that I was attached. It was to those little Baltimore boys that Ifelt the strongest attachment. I had received many good lessons from them, andwas still receiving them, and the thought of leaving them was painful indeed. Iwas leaving, too, without the hope of ever being allowed to return. MasterThomas had said he would never let me return again. The barrier betwixt himselfand brother he considered impassable.I then had to regret that I did not at least make the attempt to carry out myresolution to run away; for the chances of success are tenfold greater from thecity than from the country.I sailed from Baltimore for St. Michael’s in the sloop Amanda, Captain EdwardDodson. On my passage, I paid particular attention to the direction which thesteamboats took to go to Philadelphia. I found, instead of going down, onreaching North Point they went up the bay, in a north-easterly direction. Ideemed this knowledge of the utmost importance. My determination to run away wasagain revived. I resolved to wait only so long as the offering of a favorableopportunity. When that came, I was determined to be off."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER IX[images/00020.jpg]I HAVE NOW REACHED a period of my life when I can give dates. I left Baltimore,and went to live with Master Thomas Auld, at St. Michael‘s, in March, 1832. Itwas now more than seven years since I lived with him in the family of my oldmaster, on Colonel Lloyd’s plantation. We of course were now almost entirestrangers to each other. He was to me a new master, and I to him a new slave. Iwas ignorant of his temper and disposition; he was equally so of mine. A veryshort time, however, brought us into full acquaintance with each other. I wasmade acquainted with his wife not less than with himself. They were wellmatched, being equally mean and cruel. I was now, for the first time during aspace of more than seven years, made to feel the painful gnawings of hunger—asomething which I had not experienced before since I left Colonel Lloyd’splantation. It went hard enough with me then, when I could look back to noperiod at which I had enjoyed a sufficiency. It was tenfold harder after livingin Master Hugh’s family, where I had always had enough to eat, and of that whichwas good. I have said Master Thomas was a mean man. He was so. Not to give aslave enough to eat, is regarded as the most aggravated development of meannesseven among slaveholders. The rule is, no matter how coarse the food, only letthere be enough of it. This is the theory; and in the part of Maryland fromwhich I came, it is the general practice,—though there are many exceptions.Master Thomas gave us enough of neither coarse nor fine food. There were fourslaves of us in the kitchen—my sister Eliza, my aunt Priscilla, Henny, andmyself; and we were allowed less than a half of a bushel of corn-meal per week,and very little else, either in the shape of meat or vegetables. It was notenough for us to subsist upon. We were therefore reduced to the wretchednecessity of living at the expense of our neighbors. This we did by begging andstealing, whichever came handy in the time of need, the one being considered aslegitimate as the other. A great many times have we poor creatures been nearlyperishing with hunger, when food in abundance lay mouldering in the safebi[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos389760] and smoke-house,and our pious mistress was aware of the fact; and yet that mistress and herhusband would kneel every morning, and pray that God would bless them in basketand store!Bad as all slaveholders are, we seldom meet one destitute of every element ofcharacter commanding respect. My master was one of this rare sort. I do not knowof one single noble act ever performed by him. The leading trait in hischaracter was meanness; and if there were any other element in his nature, itwas made subject to this. He was mean; and, like most other mean men, he lackedthe ability to conceal his meanness. Captain Auld was not born a slaveholder. Hehad been a poor man, master only of a Bay craft. He came into possession of allhis slaves by marriage; and of all men, adopted slaveholders are the worst. Hewas cruel, but cowardly. He commanded without firmness. In the enforcement ofhis rules, he was at times rigid, and at times lax. At times, he spoke to hisslaves with the firmness of Napoleon and the fury of a demon; at other times, hemight well be mistaken for an in quirer who had lost his way. He did nothing ofhimself. He might have passed for a lion, but for his ears. In all things noblewhich he attempted, his own meanness shone most conspicuous. His airs, words,and actions, were the airs, words, and actions of born slaveholders, and, beingassumed, were awkward enough. He was not even a good imitator. He possessed allthe disposition to deceive, but wanted the power. Having no resources withinhimself, he was compelled to be the copyist of many, and being such, he wasforever the victim of inconsistency; and of consequence he was an object ofcontempt, and was held as such even by his slaves. The luxury of having slavesof his own to wait upon him was something new and unprepared for. He was aslaveholder without the ability to hold slaves. He found himself incapable ofmanaging his slaves either by force, fear, or fraud. We seldom called him“master;” we generally called him “Captain Auld,” and were hardly disposed totitle him at all. I doubt not that our conduct had much to do with making himappear awkward, and of consequence fretful. Our want of reverence for him musthave perplexed him greatly. He wished to have us call him master, but lacked thefirmness necessary to command us to do so. His wife used to insist upon ourcalling him so, but to no purpose. In August, 1832, my master attended aMethodist camp-meetingbj[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos389969] held in theBay-side, Talbot county, and there experienced religion. I indulged a faint hopethat his conversion would lead him to emancipate his slaves, and that, if he didnot do this, it would, at any rate, make him more kind and humane. I wasdisappointed in both these respects. It neither made him to be humane to hisslaves, nor to emancipate them. If it had any effect on his character, it madehim more cruel and hateful in all his ways; for I believe him to have been amuch worse man after his conversion than before. Prior to his conversion, herelied upon his own depravity to shield and sustain him in his savage barbarity;but after his conversion, he found religious sanction and support for hisslaveholding cruelty. He made the greatest pretensions to piety. His house wasthe house of prayer. He prayed morning, noon, and night. He very soondistinguished himself among his brethren, and was soon made a class-leader bk[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos390172] and exhorter. Hisactivity in revivals was great, and he proved himself an instrument in the handsof the church in converting many souls. His house was the preachers’ home. Theyused to take great pleasure in coming there to put up; for while he starved us,he stuffed them. We have had three or four preachers there at a time. The namesof those who used to come most frequently while I lived there, were Mr. Storks,Mr. Ewery, Mr. Humphry, and Mr. Hickey. I have also seen Mr. George Cookman atour house. We slaves loved Mr. Cookman. 30[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos336505] We believed himto be a good man. We thought him instrumental in getting Mr. Samuel Harrison, avery rich slaveholder, to emancipate his slaves; and by some means got theimpression that he was laboring to effect the emancipation of all the slaves.When he was at our house, we were sure to be called in to prayers. When theothers were there, we were sometimes called in and sometimes not. Mr. Cookmantook more notice of us than either of the other ministers. He could not comeamong us without betraying his sympathy for us, and, stupid as we were, we hadthe sagacity to see it.While I lived with my master in St. Michael‘s, there was a white young man, aMr. Wilson, who proposed to keep a Sabbath school for the instruction of suchslaves as might be disposed to learn to read the New Testament. We met but threetimes, when Mr. West and Mr. Fairbanks, both class-leaders, with many others,came upon us with sticks and other missiles, drove us off, and forbade us tomeet again. Thus ended our little Sabbath school in the pious town of St.Michael’s.I have said my master found religious sanction for his cruelty. As an example, Iwill state one of many facts going to prove the charge. I have seen him tie up alame young woman, and whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders,causing the warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, hewould quote this passage of Scripture—“He that knoweth his master’s will, anddoeth it not, shall be beaten with many stripes.”bl[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos390426]Master would keep this lacerated young woman tied up in this horrid situationfour or five hours at a time. I have known him to tie her up early in themorning, and whip her before breakfast; leave her, go to his store, return atdinner, and whip her again, cutting her in the places already made raw with hiscruel lash. The secret of master’s cruelty toward “Henny” is found in the factof her being almost helpless. When quite a child, she fell into the fire, andburned herself horribly. Her hands were so burnt that she never got the use ofthem. She could do very little but bear heavy burdens. She was to master a billof expense; and as he was a mean man, she was a constant offence to him. Heseemed desirous of getting the poor girl out of existence. He gave her away onceto his sister; but, being a poor gift, she was not disposed to keep her.Finally, my benevolent master, to use his own words, “set her adrift to takecare of herself.” Here was a recently-converted man, holding on upon the mother,and at the same time turning out her helpless child, to starve and die! MasterThomas was one of the many pious slaveholders who hold slaves for the verycharitable purpose of taking care of them.My master and myself had quite a number of differences. He found me unsuitableto his purpose. My city life, he said, had had a very pernicious effect upon me.It had almost ruined me for every good purpose, and fitted me for every thingwhich was bad. One of my greatest faults was that of letting his horse run away,and go down to his father-in-law’s farm, which was about five miles from St.Michael’s. I would then have to go after it. My reason for this kind ofcarelessness, or carefulness, was, that I could always get something to eat whenI went there. Master William Hamilton, my master’s father-in-law, always gavehis slaves enough to eat. I never left there hungry, no matter how great theneed of my speedy return. Master Thomas at length said he would stand it nolonger. I had lived with him nine months, during which time he had given me anumber of severe whippings, all to no good purpose. He resolved to put me out,as he said, to be broken; and, for this purpose, he let me for one year to a mannamed Edward Covey. Mr. Covey was a poor man, a farm renter. He rented the placeupon which he lived, as also the hands with which he tilled it. Mr. Covey hadacquired a very high reputation for breaking young slaves, and this reputationwas of immense value to him. It enabled him to get his farm tilled with muchless expense to himself than he could have had it done without such areputation. Some slaveholders thought it not much loss to allow Mr. Covey tohave their slaves one year, for the sake of the training to which they weresubjected, without any other compensation. He could hire young help with greatease, in consequence of this reputation. Added to the natural good qualities ofMr. Covey, he was a professor of religion—a pious soul—a member and aclass-leader in the Methodist church. All of this added weight to his reputationas a “nigger-breaker.” I was aware of all the facts, having been made acquaintedwith them by a young man who had lived there. I nevertheless made the changegladly; for I was sure of getting enough to eat, which is not the smallestconsideration to a hungry man."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER X[images/00016.jpg]I LEFT MASTER THOMAS’S house, and went to live with Mr. Covey, on the 1st ofJanuary, 1833.bm [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos390623]I was now, for the first time in my life, a field hand. In my new employment, Ifound myself even more awkward than a country boy appeared to be in a largecity. I had been at my new home but one week before Mr. Covey gave me a verysevere whipping, cutting my back, causing the blood to run, and raising ridgeson my flesh as large as my little finger. The details of this affair are asfollows: Mr. Covey sent me, very early in the morning of one of our coldest daysin the month of January, to the woods, to get a load of wood. He gave me a teamof unbroken oxen. He told me which was the in-hand ox, and which the off-handone.bn [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos390851] He thentied the end of a large rope around the horns of the in-hand ox, and gave me theother end of it, and told me, if the oxen started to run, that I must hold onupon the rope. I had never driven oxen before, and of course I was very awkward.I, however, succeeded in getting to the edge of the woods with littledifficulty; but I had got a very few rods into the woods, when the oxen tookfright, and started full tilt, carrying the cart against trees, and over stumps,in the most frightful manner. I expected every moment that my brains would bedashed out against the trees. After running thus for a considerable distance,they finally upset the cart, dashing it with great force against a tree, andthrew themselves into a dense thicket. How I escaped death, I do not know. ThereI was, entirely alone, in a thick wood, in a place new to me. My cart was upsetand shattered, my oxen were entangled among the young trees, and there was noneto help me. After a long spell of effort, I succeeded in getting my cartrighted, my oxen disentangled, and again yoked to the cart. I now proceeded withmy team to the place where I had, the day before, been chopping wood, and loadedmy cart pretty heavily, thinking in this way to tame my oxen. I then proceededon my way home. I had now consumed one half of the day. I got out of the woodssafely, and now felt out of danger. I stopped my oxen to open the woods gate;and just as I did so, before I could get hold of my ox-rope, the oxen againstarted, rushed through the gate, catching it between the wheel and the body ofthe cart, tearing it to pieces, and coming within a few inches of crushing meagainst the gate-post. Thus twice, in one short day, I escaped death by themerest chance. On my return, I told Mr. Covey what had happened, and how ithappened. He ordered me to return to the woods again immediately. I did so, andhe followed on after me. Just as I got into the woods, he came up and told me tostop my cart, and that he would teach me how to trifle away my time, and breakgates. He then went to a large gum-tree, and with his axe cut three largeswitches, and, after trimming them up neatly with his pocket-knife, he orderedme to take off my clothes. I made him no answer, but stood with my clothes on.He repeated his order. I still made him no answer, nor did I move to stripmyself. Upon this he rushed at me with the fierceness of a tiger, tore off myclothes, and lashed me till he had worn out his switches, cutting me so savagelyas to leave the marks visible for a long time after. This whipping was the firstof a number just like it, and for similar offences.I lived with Mr. Covey one year. During the first six months, of that year,scarce a week passed without his whipping me. I was seldom free from a soreback. My awkwardness was almost always his excuse for whipping me. We wereworked fully up to the point of endurance. Long before day we were up, ourhorses fed, and by the first approach of day we were off to the field with ourhoes and ploughing teams. Mr. Covey gave us enough to eat, but scarce time toeat it. We were often less than five minutes taking our meals. We were often inthe field from the first approach of day till its last lingering ray had leftus; and at saving-fodder time,bo[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos391129] midnight oftencaught us in the field binding blades.Covey would be out with us. The way he used to stand it, was this. He wouldspend the most of his afternoons in bed. He would then come out fresh in theevening, ready to urge us on with his words, ex ample, and frequently with thewhip. Mr. Covey was one of the few slaveholders who could and did work with hishands. He was a hard-working man. He knew by himself just what a man or a boycould do. There was no deceiving him. His work went on in his absence almost aswell as in his presence; and he had the faculty of making us feel that he wasever present with us. This he did by surprising us. He seldom approached thespot where we were at work openly, if he could do it secretly. He always aimedat taking us by surprise. Such was his cunning, that we used to call him, amongourselves, “the snake.”bp[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos391319] When we were atwork in the cornfield, he would sometimes crawl on his hands and knees to avoiddetection, and all at once he would rise nearly in our midst, and scream out,“Ha, ha! Come, come! Dash on, dash on!” This being his mode of attack, it wasnever safe to stop a single minute. His comings were like a thief in the night.He appeared to us as being ever at hand. He was under every tree, behind everystump, in every bush, and at every window, on the plantation. He would sometimesmount his horse, as if bound to St. Michael‘s, a distance of seven miles, and inhalf an hour afterwards you would see him coiled up in the corner of thewood-fence, watching every motion of the slaves. He would, for this purpose,leave his horse tied up in the woods. Again, he would sometimes walk up to us,and give us orders as though he was upon the point of starting on a longjourney, turn his back upon us, and make as though he was going to the house toget ready; and, before he would get half way thither, he would turn short andcrawl into a fence-corner, or behind some tree, and there watch us till thegoing down of the sun.Mr. Covey’s forte consisted in his power to deceive. His life was devoted toplanning and perpetrating the grossest deceptions. Every thing he possessed inthe shape of learning or religion, he made conform to his disposition todeceive. He seemed to think himself equal to deceiving the Almighty. He wouldmake a short prayer in the morning, and a long prayer at night; and, strange asit may seem, few men would at times appear more devotional than he. Theexercises of his family devotions were always commenced with singing; and, as hewas a very poor singer himself, the duty of raising the hymn gener ally cameupon me. He would read his hymn, and nod at me to commence. I would at times doso; at others, I would not.bq[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos391595] My non-compliancewould almost always produce much confusion. To show himself independent of me,he would start and stagger through with his hymn in the most discordant manner.In this state of mind, he prayed with more than ordinary spirit. Poor man! suchwas his disposition, and success at deceiving, I do verily believe that hesometimes deceived himself into the solemn belief, that he was a sincereworshipper of the most high God; and this, too, at a time when he may be said tohave been guilty of compelling his woman slave to commit the sin of adultery.The facts in the case are these: Mr. Covey was a poor man; he was justcommencing in life; he was only able to buy one slave; and, shocking as is thefact, he bought her, as he said, for a breeder. This woman was named Caroline.Mr. Covey bought her from Mr. Thomas Lowe, about six miles from St. Michael’s.She was a large, able-bodied woman, about twenty years old. She had alreadygiven birth to one child, which proved her to be just what he wanted. Afterbuying her, he hired a married man of Mr. Samuel Harrison, to live with him oneyear; and him he used to fasten up with her every night! The result was, that,at the end of the year, the miserable woman gave birth to twins. At this resultMr. Covey seemed to be highly pleased, both with the man and the wretched woman.Such was his joy, and that of his wife, that nothing they could do for Carolineduring her confinement was too good, or too hard, to be done. The children wereregarded as being quite an addition to his wealth.If at any one time of my life more than another, I was made to drink thebitterest dregs of slavery, that time was during the first six months of my staywith Mr. Covey. We were worked in all weathers. It was never too hot or toocold; it could never rain, blow, hail, or snow, too hard for us to work in thefield. Work, work, work, was scarcely more the order of the day than of thenight. The longest days were too short for him, and the shortest nights too longfor him. I was somewhat unmanageable when I first went there, but a few monthsof this discipline tamed me. Mr. Covey succeeded in breaking me. I was broken inbody, soul, and spirit. My natural elasticity was crushed, my intellectlanguished, the disposition to read departed, the cheerful spark that lingeredabout my eye died; the dark night of slavery closed in upon me; and behold a mantransformed into a brute!Sunday was my only leisure time. I spent this in a sort of beastlike stupor,between sleep and wake, under some large tree. At times I would rise up, a flashof energetic freedom would dart through, my soul, accompanied with a faint beamof hope, that flickered for a moment, and then vanished. I sank down again,mourning over my wretched condition. I was sometimes prompted to take my life,and that of Covey, but was prevented by a combination of hope and fear. Mysufferings on this plantation seem now like a dream rather than a stern reality.Our house stood within a few rods of the Chesapeake Bay, whose broad bosom wasever white with sails from every quarter of the habitable globe. Those beautifulvessels, robed in purest white, so delightful to the eye of freemen, were to meso many shrouded ghosts, to terrify and torment me with thoughts of my wretchedcondition. I have often, in the deep stillness of a summer’s Sabbath, stood allalone upon the lofty banks of that noble bay, and traced, with saddened heartand tearful eye, the countless number of sails moving off to the mighty ocean.The sight of these always affected me powerfully. My thoughts would compelutterance; and there, with no audience but the Almighty, I would pour out mysoul’s complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to the moving multitude ofships:—“You are loosed from your moorings,br[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos391876] and are free; Iam fast in my chains, and am a slave! You move merrily before the gentle gale,and I sadly before the bloody whip! You are freedom’s swift-winged angels, thatfly round the world; I am confined in bands of iron! O that I were free! O, thatI were on one of your gallant decks, and under your protecting wing! Alas!betwixt me and you, the turbid waters roll. Go on, go on. O that I could alsogo! Could I but swim! If I could fly! O, why was I born a man, of whom to make abrute! The glad ship is gone; she hides in the dim distance. I am left in thehottest hell of unending slavery. O God, save me! God, deliver me! Let me befree! Is there any God? Why am I a slave? I will run away. I will not stand it.Get caught, or get clear, I’ll try it. I had as well die with aguebs[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos392081] as the fever. Ihave only one life to lose. I had as well be killed running as die standing.Only think of it; one hundred miles straight north, and I am free! Try it? Yes!God helping me, I will. It cannot be that I shall live and die a slave. I willtake to the water. This very bay shall bear me into freedom. The steamboatssteered in a north-east course from North Point. I will do the same; and when Iget to the head of the bay, I will turn my canoe adrift, and walk straightthrough Delaware into Pennsylvania. When I get there, I shall not be required tohave a pass; I can travel without being disturbed. Let but the first opportunityoffer, and, come what will, I am off. Meanwhile, I will try to bear up under theyoke. I am not the only slave in the world. Why should I fret? I can bear asmuch as any of them. Besides, I am but a boy, and all boys are bound to someone. It may be that my misery in slavery will only increase my happiness when Iget free. There is a better day coming.“31[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos336808]Thus I used to think, and thus I used to speak to myself; goaded almost tomadness at one moment, and at the next reconciling myself to my wretched lot.I have already intimated that my condition was much worse, during the first sixmonths of my stay at Mr. Covey‘s, than in the last six. The circumstancesleading to the change in Mr. Covey’s course toward me form an epoch in my humblehistory. You have seen how a man was made a slave; you shall see how a slave wasmade a man. On one of the hottest days of the month of August, 1833, Bill Smith,William Hughes, a slave named Eli, and myself, were engaged in fanning wheat.bt[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos392332] Hughes wasclearing the fanned wheat from before the fan, Eli was turning, Smith wasfeeding, and I was carrying wheat to the fan. The work was simple, requiringstrength rather than intellect; yet, to one entirely unused to such work, itcame very hard. About three o’clock of that day, I broke down; my strengthfailed me; I was seized with a violent aching of the head, attended with extremedizziness; I trembled in every limb. Finding what was coming, I nerved myselfup, feeling it would never do to stop work. I stood as long as I could staggerto the hopper with grain. When I could stand no longer, I fell, and felt as ifheld down by an immense weight. The fan of course stopped; every one had his ownwork to do; and no one could do the work of the other, and have his own go on atthe same time.Mr. Covey was at the house, about one hundred yards from the treading-yard wherewe were fanning. On hearing the fan stop, he left immediately, and came to thespot where we were. He hastily inquired what the matter was. Bill answered thatI was sick, and there was no one to bring wheat to the fan. I had by this timecrawled away under the side of the post and rail-fence by which the yard wasenclosed, hoping to find relief by getting out of the sun. He then asked where Iwas. He was told by one of the hands. He came to the spot, and, after looking atme awhile, asked me what was the matter. I told him as well as I could, for Iscarce had strength to speak. He then gave me a savage kick in the side, andtold me to get up. I tried to do so, but fell back in the attempt. He gave meanother kick, and again told me to rise. I again tried, and succeeded in gainingmy feet; but, stooping to get the tub with which I was feeding the fan, I againstaggered and fell. While down in this situation, Mr. Covey took up the hickoryslatbu [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos392570] with whichHughes had been striking off the half-bushel measure, and with it gave me aheavy blow upon the head, making a large wound, and the blood ran freely; andwith this again told me to get up. I made no effort to comply, having now madeup my mind to let him do his worst. In a short time after receiving this blow,my head grew better. Mr. Covey had now left me to my fate. At this moment Iresolved, for the first time, to go to my master, enter a complaint, and ask hisprotection. In order to [do] this, I must that afternoon walk seven miles; andthis, under the circumstances, was truly a severe undertaking. I was exceedinglyfeeble; made so as much by the kicks and blows which I received, as by thesevere fit of sickness to which I had been subjected. I, however, watched mychance, while Covey was looking in an opposite direction, and started for St.Michael’s. I succeeded in getting a considerable distance on my way to thewoods, when Covey discovered me, and called after me to come back, threateningwhat he would do if I did not come. I disregarded both his calls and histhreats, and made my way to the woods as fast as my feeble state would allow;and thinking I might be overhauledbv[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos392745] by him if I keptthe road, I walked through the woods, keeping far enough from the road to avoiddetection, and near enough to prevent losing my way. I had not gone far beforemy little strength again failed me. I could go no farther. I fell down, and layfor a considerable time. The blood was yet oozing from the wound on my head. Fora time I thought I should bleed to death; and think now that I should have doneso, but that the blood so matted my hair as to stop the wound. After lying thereabout three quarters of an hour, I nerved myself up again, and started on myway, through bogs and briers, barefooted and bareheaded, tearing my feetsometimes at nearly every step; and after a journey of about seven miles,occupying some five hours to perform it, I arrived at master’s store. I thenpresented an appearance enough to affect any but a heart of iron. From the crownof my head to my feet, I was covered with blood. My hair was all clotted withdust and blood; my shirt was stiff with blood. My legs and feet were torn insundry places with briers and thorns, and were also covered with blood. Isuppose I looked like a man who had escaped a den of wild beasts, and barelyescaped them. In this state I appeared before my master, humbly entreating himto interpose his authority for my protection. I told him all the circumstancesas well as I could, and it seemed, as I spoke, at times to affect him. He wouldthen walk the floor, and seek to justify Covey by saying he expected I deservedit. He asked me what I wanted. I told him, to let me get a new home; that assure as I lived with Mr. Covey again, I should live with but to die with him;that Covey would surely kill me; he was in a fair way for it. Master Thomasridiculed the idea that there was any danger of Mr. Covey’s killing me, and saidthat he knew Mr. Covey; that he was a good man, and that he could not think oftaking me from him; that, should he do so, he would lose the whole year’s wages;that I belonged to Mr. Covey for one year, and that I must go back to him, comewhat might; and that I must not trouble him with any more stories, or that hewould himself get hold of me. After threatening me thus, he gave me a very largedose of salts, telling me that I might remain in St. Michael’s that night, (itbeing quite late,) but that I must be off back to Mr. Covey’s early in themorning; and that if I did not, he would get hold of me, which meant that hewould whip me. I remained all night, and, according to his orders, I started offto Covey’s in the morning, (Saturday morning,) wearied in body and broken inspirit. I got no supper that night, or breakfast that morning. I reached Covey’sabout nine o‘clock; and just as I was getting over the fence that divided Mrs.Kemp’s fields from ours, out ran Covey with his cowskin, to give me anotherwhipping. Before he could reach me, I succeeded in getting to the cornfield; andas the corn was very high, it afforded me the means of hiding. He seemed veryangry, and searched for me a long time. My behavior was altogetherunaccountable. He finally gave up the chase, thinking, I suppose, that I mustcome home for something to eat; he would give himself no further trouble inlooking for me. I spent that day mostly in the woods, having the alternativebefore me,—to go home and be whipped to death, or stay in the woods and bestarved to death. That night, I fell in with Sandy Jenkins, bw[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos392917] a slave with whomI was somewhat acquainted. Sandy had a free wifebx[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos393197] who lived aboutfour miles from Mr. Covey’s; and it being Saturday, he was on his way to seeher. I told him my circumstances, and he very kindly invited me to go home withhim. I went home with him, and talked this whole matter over, and got his adviceas to what course it was best for me to pursue. I found Sandy an old adviser.32[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos337552] He told me, withgreat solemnity, I must go back to Covey; but that before I went, I must go withhim into another part of the woods, where there was a certain root, which, if Iwould take some of it with me, carrying it always on my right side, would renderit impossible for Mr. Covey, or any other white man, to whip me. He said he hadcarried it for years; and since he had done so, he had never received a blow,and never expected to while he carried it. I at first rejected the idea, thatthe simple carrying of a root in my pocket would have any such effect as he hadsaid, and was not disposed to take it; but Sandy impressed the necessity withmuch earnestness, telling me it could do no harm, if it did no good. To pleasehim, I at length took the root, and, according to his direction, carried it uponmy right side. This was Sunday morning. I immediately started for home; and uponentering the yard gate, out came Mr. Covey on his way to meeting. He spoke to mevery kindly, bade me drive the pigs from a lot near by, and passed on towardsthe church. Now, this singular conduct of Mr. Covey really made me begin tothink that there was something in the root which Sandy had given me; and had itbeen on any other day than Sunday, I could have attributed the conduct to noother cause than the influence of that root; and as it was, I was half inclinedto think the root to be something more than I at first had taken it to be. Allwent well till Monday morning. On this morning, the virtue of the root was fullytested. Long before daylight, I was called to go and rub, curry, and feed, thehorses. I obeyed, and was glad to obey. But whilst thus engaged, whilst in theact of throwing down some blades from the loft, Mr. Covey entered the stablewith a long rope; and just as I was half out of the loft, he caught hold of mylegs, and was about tying me. As soon as I found what he was up to, I gave asudden spring, and as I did so, he holding to my legs, I was brought sprawlingon the stable floor. Mr. Covey seemed now to think he had me, and could do whathe pleased; but at this moment—from whence came the spirit I don’t know—Iresolved to fight; and, suiting my action to the resolution, I seized Covey hardby the throat; and as I did so, I rose. He held on to me, and I to him. Myresistance was so entirely unexpected, that Covey seemed taken all aback. Hetrembled like a leaf. This gave me assurance, and I held him uneasy, causing theblood to run where I touched him with the ends of my fingers. Mr. Covey sooncalled out to Hughes for help. Hughes came, and, while Covey held me, attemptedto tie my right hand. While he was in the act of doing so, I watched my chance,and gave him a heavy kick close under the ribs. This kick fairly sickenedHughes, so that he left me in the hands of Mr. Covey. This kick had the effectof not only weakening Hughes, but Covey also. When he saw Hughes bending overwith pain, his courage quailed. He asked me if I meant to persist in myresistance. I told him I did, come what might; that he had used me like a brutefor six months, and that I was determined to be used so no longer. With that, hestrove to drag me to a stick that was lying just out of the stable door. Hemeant to knock me down. But just as he was leaning over to get the stick, Iseized him with both hands by his collar, and brought him by a sudden snatch tothe ground. By this time, Bill came. Covey called upon him for assistance. Billwanted to know what he could do. Covey said, “Take hold of him, take hold ofhim!” Bill said his master hired him out to work, and not to help to whip me; sohe left Covey and myself to fight our own battle out. We were at it for nearlytwo hours. Covey at length let me go, puffing and blowing at a great rate,saying that if I had not resisted, he would not have whipped me at all. Iconsidered him as getting entirely the worst end of the bargain; for he haddrawn no blood from me, but I had from him. The whole six months afterwards,that I spent with Mr. Covey, he never laid the weight of his finger upon me inanger. He would occasionally say, he didn’t want to get hold of me again. “No,”thought I, “you need not; for you will come off worse than you did before.”This battle with Mr. Covey was the turning-point in my career as a slave. Itrekindled the few expiring embers of freedom, and revived within me a sense ofmy own manhood. It recalled the departed self-confidence, and inspired me againwith a determination to be free. The gratification afforded by the triumph was afull compensation for whatever else might follow, even death itself. He only canunderstand the deep satisfaction which I experienced, who has himself repelledby force the bloody arm of slavery. I felt as I never felt before. It was aglorious resurrection, from the tomb of slavery, to the heaven of freedom. Mylong-crushed spirit rose, cowardice departed, bold defiance took its place; andI now resolved that, however long I might remain a slave in form, the day hadpassed forever when I could be a slave in fact. I did not hesitate to let it beknown of me, that the white man who expected to succeed in whipping, must alsosucceed in killing me.From this time I was never again what might be called fairly whipped,by[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos393430] though I remaineda slave four years afterwards. I had several fights, but was never whipped.It was for a long time a matter of surprise to me why Mr. Covey did notimmediately have me taken by the constable to the whipping-post, and thereregularly whipped for the crime of raising my hand against a white man indefence of myself. And the only explanation I can now think of does not entirelysatisfy me; but such as it is, I will give it. Mr. Covey enjoyed the mostunbounded reputation for being a first-rate overseer and negro-breaker. It wasof considerable importance to him. That reputation was at stake; and had he sentme—a boy about sixteen years old—to the public whipping-post, his reputationwould have been lost; so, to save his reputation, he suffered me to gounpunished.My term of actual service to Mr. Edward Covey ended on Christmas day, 1833. Thedays between Christmas and New Year’s day are allowed as holidays; and,accordingly, we were not required to perform any labor, more than to feed andtake care of the stock. This time we regarded as our own, by the grace of ourmasters; and we therefore used or abused it nearly as we pleased. Those of uswho had families at a distance, were generally allowed to spend the whole sixdays in their society. This time, however, was spent in various ways. The staid,sober, thinking, and industrious ones of our number would employ themselves inmaking cornbrooms,bz[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos393640] mats,horse-collars, and baskets; and another class of us would spend the time inhunting opossums, hares, and coons. But by far the larger part engaged in suchsports and merriments as playing ball, wrestling, running foot-races, fiddling,dancing, and drinking whisky; and this latter mode of spending the time was byfar the most agreeable to the feelings of our masters. A slave who would workduring the holidays was considered by our masters as scarcely deserving them. Hewas regarded as one who rejected the favor of his master. It was deemed adisgrace not to get drunk at Christmas; and he was regarded as lazy indeed, whohad not provided himself with the necessary means, during the yeat, to getwhisky enough to last him through Christmas.From what I know of the effect of these holidays upon the slave, I believe themto be among the most effective means in the hands of the slaveholder in keepingdown the spirit of insurrection. Were the slaveholders at once to abandon thispractice, I have not the slightest doubt it would lead to an immediateinsurrection among the slaves. These holidays serve as conductors, orsafety-valves, to carry off the rebellious spirit of enslaved humanity. But forthese, the slave would be forced up to the wildest desperation; and woe betidethe slave holder, the day he ventures to remove or hinder the operation of thoseconductors! I warn him that, in such an event, a spirit will go forth in theirmidst, more to be dreaded than the most appalling earthquake.The holidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity ofslavery. They are professedly a custom established by the benevolence of theslaveholders; but I undertake to say, it is the result of selfishness, and oneof the grossest frauds committed upon the down-trodden slave. They do not givethe slaves this time because they would not like to have their work during itscontinuance, but because they know it would be unsafe to deprive them of it.This will be seen by the fact, that the slaveholders like to have their slavesspend those days just in such a manner as to make them as glad of their endingas of their beginning. Their object seems to be, to disgust their slaves withfreedom, by plunging them into the lowest depths of dissipation. For instance,the slaveholders not only like to see the slave drink of his own accord, butwill adopt various plans to make him drunk. One plan is, to make bets on theirslaves, as to who can drink the most whisky without getting drunk; and in thisway they succeed in getting whole multitudes to drink to excess. Thus, when theslave asks for virtuous freedom, the cunning slaveholder, knowing his ignorance,cheats him with a dose of vicious dissipation, artfully labelled with the nameof liberty. The most of us used to drink it down, and the result was just whatmight be supposed: Many of us were led to think that there was little to choosebetween liberty and slavery. We felt, and very properly too, that we had almostas well be slaves to man as to rum. So, when the holidays ended, we staggered upfrom the filth of our wallowing, took a long breath, and marched to thefield,—feeling, upon the whole, rather glad to go, from what our master haddeceived us into a belief was freedom, back to the arms of slavery.33[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos337938]I have said that this mode of treatment is a part of the whole system of fraudand inhumanity of slavery. It is so. The mode here adopted to disgust the slavewith freedom, by allowing him to see only the abuse of it, is carried out inother things. For instance, a slave loves molasses; he steals some. His master,in many cases, goes off to town, and buys a large quantity; he returns, takeshis whip, and commands the slave to eat the molasses, until the poor fellow ismade sick at the very mention of it. The same mode is sometimes adopted to makethe slaves refrain from asking for more food than their regular allowance. Aslave runs through his allowance, and applies for more. His master is enraged athim; but, not willing to send him off without food, gives him more than isnecessary, and compels him to eat it within a given time. Then, if he complainsthat he cannot eat it, he is said to be satisfied neither full nor fasting, andis whipped for being hard to please! I have an abundance of such illustrationsof the same principle, drawn from my own observation, but think the cases I havecited sufficient. The practice is a very common one.On the first of January, 1834, I left Mr. Covey, and went to live with Mr.William Freeland, who lived about three miles from St. Michael’s. I soon foundMr. Freeland a very different man from Mr. Covey. Though not rich, he was whatwould be called an educated southern gentleman. Mr. Covey, as I have shown, wasa well-trained negro-breaker and slave-driver. The former (slaveholder though hewas) seemed to possess some regard for honor, some reverence for justice, andsome respect for humanity. The latter seemed totally insensible to all suchsentiments. Mr. Freeland had many of the faults peculiar to slaveholders, suchas being very passionate and fretful; but I must do him the justice to say, thathe was exceedingly free from those degrading vices to which Mr. Covey wasconstantly addicted. The one was open and frank, and we always knew where tofind him. The other was a most artful deceiver, and could be understood only bysuch as were skillful enough to detect his cunningly-devised frauds. Anotheradvantage I gained in my new master was, he made no pretensions to, orprofession of, religion; and this, in my opinion, was truly a great advantage. Iassert most unhesitatingly, that the religion of the south is a mere coveringfor the most horrid crimes,—a justifier of the most appalling barbarity,—asanctifier of the most hateful frauds,—and a dark shelter under which thedarkest, foulest, grossest, and most infernal deeds of slaveholders find thestrongest protection. Were I to be again reduced to the chains of slavery, nextto that enslavement, I should regard being the slave of a religious master thegreatest calamity that could befall me. For of all slave holders with whom Ihave ever met, religious slaveholders are the worst. I have ever found them themeanest and basest, the most cruel and cowardly, of all others. It was myunhappy lot not only to belong to a religious slaveholder, but to live in acommunity of such reli gionists. Very near Mr. Freeland lived the Rev. DanielWeeden, and in the same neighborhood lived the Rev. Rigby Hopkins. These weremembers and ministers in the Reformed Methodist Church. Mr. Weeden owned, amongothers, a woman slave, whose name I have forgotten. This woman’s back, forweeks, was kept literally raw, made so by the lash of this merciless, religiouswretch. He used to hire hands. His maxim was, Behave well or behave ill, it isthe duty of a master occasionally to whip a slave, to remind him of his master’sauthority. Such was his theory, and such his practice.Mr. Hopkins was even worse than Mr. Weeden. His chief boast was his ability tomanage slaves. The peculiar feature of his government was that of whippingslaves in advance of deserving it. He always managed to have one or more of hisslaves to whip every Monday morning. He did this to alarm their fears, andstrike terror into those who escaped. His plan was to whip for the smallestoffences, to prevent the commission of large ones. Mr. Hopkins could always findsome excuse for whipping a slave. It would astonish one, unaccustomed to aslaveholding life, to see with what wonderful ease a slaveholder can findthings, of which to make occasion to whip a slave. A mere look, word, ormotion,—a mistake, accident, or want of power,—are all matters for which a slavemay be whipped at any time. Does a slave look dissatisfied? It is said, he hasthe devil in him, and it must be whipped out. Does he speak loudly when spokento by his master? Then he is getting high-minded, and should be taken down abutton-hole lower. Does he forget to pull off his hat at the approach of a whiteperson? Then he is wanting in reverence, and should be whipped for it. Does heever venture to vindicate his conduct, when censured for it? Then he is guiltyof impudence,—one of the greatest crimes of which a slave can be guilty. Does heever venture to suggest a different mode of doing things from that pointed outby his master? He is indeed presumptuous, and getting above himself; and nothingless than a flogging will do for him. Does he, while ploughing, break aplough,—or, while hoeing, break a hoe? It is owing to his carelessness, and forit a slave must always be whipped. Mr. Hopkins could always find something ofthis sort to justify the use of the lash, and he seldom failed to embrace suchopportunities. There was not a man in the whole county, with whom the slaves whohad the getting their own home, would not prefer to live, rather than with thisRev. Mr. Hopkins. And yet there was not a man any where round, who made higherprofessions of religion, or was more active in revivals,—more attentive to theclass, love-feast, prayer and preaching meetings, or more devotional in hisfamily,—that prayed earlier, later, louder, and longer,—than this same reverendslave-driver, Rigby Hopkins.But to return to Mr. Freeland, and to my experience while in his employment. He,like Mr. Covey, gave us enough to eat; but, unlike Mr. Covey, he also gave ussufficient time to take our meals. He worked us hard, but always between sunriseand sunset. He required a good deal of work to be done, but gave us good toolswith which to work. His farm was large, but he employed hands enough to work it,and with ease, compared with many of his neighbors. My treatment, while in hisemployment, was heavenly, compared with what I experienced at the hands of Mr.Edward Covey.Mr. Freeland was himself the owner of but two slaves. Their names were HenryHarris and John Harris. The rest of his hands he hired. These consisted ofmyself, Sandy Jenkins,ca[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos393849] and Handy Caldwell. Henry and John were quite intelligent, and in a very little while after Iwent there, I succeeded in creating in them a strong desire to learn how toread. This desire soon sprang up in the others also. They very soon mustered upsome old spelling-books, and nothing would do but that I must keep a Sabbathschool. I agreed to do so, and accordingly devoted my Sundays to teaching thesemy loved fellow-slaves how to read. Neither of them knew his letters when I wentthere. Some of the slaves of the neighboring farms found what was going on, andalso availed themselves of this little opportunity to learn to read. It wasunderstood, among all who came, that there must be as little display about it aspossible. It was necessary to keep our religious masters at St. Michael’sunacquainted with the fact, that, instead of spending the Sabbath in wrestling,boxing, and drinking whisky, we were trying to learn how to read the will ofGod; for they had much rather see us engaged in those degrading sports, than tosee us behaving like intellectual, moral, and accountable beings. My blood boilsas I think of the bloody manner in which Messrs. Wright Fairbanks and GarrisonWest, both class-leaders, in connection with many others, rushed in upon us withsticks and stones, and broke up our virtuous little Sabbath school, at St.Michaels—all calling themselves Christians! humble followers of the Lord JesusChrist! But I am again digressing.I held my Sabbath school at the house of a free colored man, whose name I deemit imprudent to mention; for should it be known, it might embarrass him greatly,though the crime of holding the school was committed ten years ago. I had at onetime over forty scholars, and those of the right sort, ardently desiring tolearn. They were of all ages, though mostly men and women. I look back to thoseSundays with an amount of pleasure not to be expressed. They were great days tomy soul. The work of instructing my dear fellow-slaves was the sweetestengagement with which I was ever blessed. We loved each other, and to leave themat the close of the Sabbath was a severe cross indeed. When I think that theseprecious souls are to day shut up in the prison-house of slavery, my feelingsovercome me, and I am almost ready to ask, “Does a righteous God govern theuniverse? and for what does he hold the thunders in his right hand, if not tosmite the oppressor, and deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the spoiler?”These dear souls came not to Sabbath school because it was popular to do so, nordid I teach them because it was reputable to be thus engaged. Every moment theyspent in that school, they were liable to be taken up, and given thirty-ninelashes. They came because they wished to learn. Their minds had been starved bytheir cruel masters. They had been shut up in mental darkness. I taught them,because it was the delight of my soul to be doing something that looked likebettering the condition of my race. I kept up my school nearly the whole year Ilived with Mr. Freeland; and, beside my Sabbath school, I devoted three eveningsin the week, during the winter, to teaching the slaves at home. And I have thehappiness to know, that several of those who came to Sabbath school learned howto read; and that one, at least, is now free through my agency.The year passed off smoothly. It seemed only about half as long as the yearwhich preceded it. I went through it without receiving a single blow. I willgive Mr. Freeland the credit of being the best master I ever had, till I becamemy own master. For the ease with which I passed the year, I was, however,somewhat indebted to the society of my fellow-slaves. They were noble souls;they not only possessed loving hearts, but brave ones. We were linked andinterlinked with each other. I loved them with a love stronger than any thing Ihave experienced since. It is sometimes said that we slaves do not love andconfide in each other. In answer to this assertion, I can say, I never loved anyor confided in any people more than my fellow-slaves, and especially those withwhom I lived at Mr. Freeland’s. I believe we would have died for each other. Wenever undertook to do any thing, of any importance, without a mutualconsultation. We never moved separately. We were one; and as much so by ourtempers and dispositions, as by the mutual hardships to which we werenecessarily subjected by our condition as slaves.At the close of the year 1834, Mr. Freeland again hired me of my master, for theyear 1835. But, by this time, I began to want to live upon free land as well aswith Freeland; and I was no longer content, therefore, to live with him or anyother slaveholder. I began, with the commencement of the year, to prepare myselffor a final struggle, which should decide my fate one way or the other. Mytendency was upward. I was fast approaching manhood, and year after year hadpassed, and I was still a slave. These thoughts roused me—I must do something. Itherefore resolved that 1835 should not pass without witnessing an attempt, onmy part, to secure my liberty. But I was not willing to cherish thisdetermination alone. My fellow-slaves were dear to me. I was anxious to havethem participate with me in this, my life-giving determination. I therefore,though with great prudence, commenced early to ascertain their views andfeelings in regard to their condition, and to imbue their minds with thoughts offreedom. I bent myself to devising ways and means for our escape, and meanwhilestrove, on all fitting occasions, to impress them with the gross fraud andinhumanity of slavery. I went first to Henry, next to John, then to the others.I found, in them all, warm hearts and noble spirits. They were ready to hear,and ready to act when a feasible plan should be proposed. This was what Iwanted. I talked to them of our want of manhood, if we submitted to ourenslavement without at least one noble effort to be free. We met often, andconsulted frequently, and told our hopes and fears, recounted the difficulties,real and imagined, which we should be called on to meet. At times we were almostdisposed to give up, and try to content ourselves with our wretched lot; atothers, we were firm and unbending in our determination to go. Whenever wesuggested any plan, there was shrinking—the odds were fearful. Our path wasbeset with the greatest obstacles; and if we succeeded in gaining the end of it,our right to be free was yet questionable—we were yet liable to be returned tobondage. We could see no spot, this side of the ocean, where we could be free.We knew nothing about Canada. Our knowledge of the north did not extend fartherthan New York; and to go there, and be forever harassed with the frightfulliability of being returned to slavery—with the certainty of being treatedtenfold worse than before—the thought was truly a horrible one, and one which itwas not easy to overcome. The case sometimes stood thus: At every gate throughwhich we were to pass, we saw a watchman—at every ferry a guard—on every bridgea sentinel—and in every wood a patrol. We were hemmed in upon every side. Herewere the difficulties, real or imagined—the good to be sought, and the evil tobe shunned. On the one hand, there stood slavery, a stern reality, glaringfrightfully upon us,—its robes already crimsoned with the blood of millions, andeven now feasting itself greedily upon our own flesh. On the other hand, awayback in the dim distance, under the flickering light of the north star, behindsome craggy hill or snow-covered mountain, stood a doubtful freedom—halffrozen—beckoning us to come and share its hospitality. This in itself wassometimes enough to stagger us; but when we permitted ourselves to survey theroad, we were frequently appalled. Upon either side we saw grim death, assumingthe most horrid shapes. Now it was starvation, causing us to eat our ownflesh;—now we were contending with the waves, and were drowned;—now we wereovertaken, and torn to pieces by the fangs of the terrible bloodhound. We werestung by scorpions, chased by wild beasts, bitten by snakes, and finally, afterhaving nearly reached the desired spot,—after swimming rivers, encountering wildbeasts, sleeping in the woods, suffering hunger and nakedness,—we were overtakenby our pursuers, and, in our resistance, we were shot dead upon the spot! I say,this picture sometimes appalled us, and made us> rather bear those ills we had,> Than fly to others, that we knew not of.cb> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos394424]In coming to a fixed determination to run away, we did more than Patrick Henry,when he resolved upon liberty or death. With us it was a doubtful liberty atmost, and almost certain death if we failed. For my part, I should prefer deathto hopeless bondage.Sandy, one of our number, gave up the notion, but still encouraged us. Ourcompany then consisted of Henry Harris, John Harris, Henry Bailey, CharlesRoberts, and myself. Henry Bailey was my uncle, and belonged to my master.Charles married my aunt: he belonged to my master’s father-in-law, Mr. WilliamHamilton.The plan we finally concluded upon was, to get a large canoe belonging to Mr.Hamilton, and upon the Saturday night previous to Easter holidays, paddledirectly up the Chesapeake Bay. On our arrival at the head of the bay, adistance of seventy or eighty miles from where we lived, it was our purpose toturn our canoe adrift, and follow the guidance of the north star till we gotbeyond the limits of Maryland. Our reason for taking the water route was, thatwe were less liable to be suspected as runaways; we hoped to be regarded asfishermen; whereas, if we should take the land route, we should be subjected tointerruptions of almost every kind. Any one having a white face, and being sodisposed, could stop us, and subject us to examination.The week before our intended start, I wrote several protections, one for each ofus. As well as I can remember, they were in the following words, to wit:—> This is to certify that I, the undersigned, have given the bearer, my servant,> full liberty to go to Baltimore, and spend the Easter holidays. Written with> mine own hand, &c., 1835.> William Hamilton,> Near St. Michael‘s, in Talbot county, Maryland.We were not going to Baltimore; but, in going up the bay, we went towardBaltimore, and these protections were only intended to protect us while on thebay.As the time drew near for our departure, our anxiety became more and moreintense. It was truly a matter of life and death with us. The strength of ourdetermination was about to be fully tested. At this time, I was very active inexplaining every difficulty, removing every doubt, dispelling every fear, andinspiring all with the firmness indispensable to success in our undertaking;assuring them that half was gained the instant we made the move; we had talkedlong enough; we were now ready to move; if not now, we never should be; and ifwe did not intend to move now, we had as well fold our arms, sit down, andacknowledge ourselves fit only to be slaves. This, none of us were prepared toacknowledge. Every man stood firm; and at our last meeting, we pledged ourselvesafresh, in the most solemn manner, that, at the time appointed, we wouldcertainly start in pursuit of freedom. This was in the middle of the week, atthe end of which we were to be off. We went, as usual, to our several fields oflabor, but with bosoms highly agitated with thoughts of our truly hazardousundertaking. We tried to conceal our feelings as much as possible; and I thinkwe succeeded very well.After a painful waiting, the Saturday morning, whose night was to witness ourdeparture, came. I hailed it with joy, bring what of sadness it might. Fridaynight was a sleepless one for me. I probably felt more anxious than the rest,because I was, by common consent, at the head of the whole affair. Theresponsibility of success or failure lay heavily upon me. The glory of the one,and the confusion of the other, were alike mine. The first two hours of thatmorning were such as I never experienced before, and hope never to again. Earlyin the morning, we went, as usual, to the field. We were spreading manure; andall at once, while thus engaged, I was overwhelmed with an indescribablefeeling, in the fulness of which I turned to Sandy, who was near by, and said,“We are betrayed!” “Well,” said he, “that thought has this moment struck me.” Wesaid no more. I was never more certain of any thing.34[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos338522]The horn was blown as usual, and we went up from the field to the house forbreakfast. I went for the form, more than for want of any thing to eat thatmorning. Just as I got to the house, in looking out at the lane gate, I saw fourwhite men, with two colored men. The white men were on horseback, and thecolored ones were walking behind, as if tied. I watched them a few moments tillthey got up to our lane gate. Here they halted, and tied the colored men to thegate-post. I was not yet certain as to what the matter was. In a few moments, inrode Mr. Hamilton, with a speed betokening great excitement. He came to thedoor, and inquired if Master William was in. He was told he was at the barn. Mr.Hamilton, without dismounting, rode up to the barn with extraordinary speed. Ina few moments, he and Mr. Freeland returned to the house. By this time, thethree constables rode up, and in great haste dismounted, tied their horses, andmet Master William and Mr. Hamilton returning from the barn; and after talkingawhile, they all walked up to the kitchen door. There was no one in the kitchenbut myself and John. Henry and Sandy were up at the barn. Mr. Freeland put hishead in at the door, and called me by name, saying, there were some gentlemen atthe door who wished to see me. I stepped to the door, and inquired what theywanted. They at once seized me, and, without giving me any satisfaction, tiedme—lashing my hands closely together. I insisted upon knowing what the matterwas. They at length said, that they had learned I had been in a “scrape,” andthat I was to be examined before my master; and if their information provedfalse, I should not be hurt.In a few moments, they succeeded in tying John. They then turned to Henry, whohad by this time returned, and commanded him to cross his hands. “I won‘t!” saidHenry, in a firm tone, indicating his readiness to meet the consequences of hisrefusal. “Won’t you?” said Tom Graham, the constable. “No, I won’t!” said Henry,in a still stronger tone. With this, two of the constables pulled out theirshining pistols, and swore, by their Creator, that they would make him cross hishands or kill him. Each cocked his pistol, and, with fingers on the trigger,walked up to Henry, saying, at the same time, if he did not cross his hands,they would blow his damned heart out. “Shoot me, shoot me!” said Henry; “youcan’t kill me but once. Shoot, shoot,—and be damned! I won’t be tied!” This hesaid in a tone of loud defiance; and at the same time, with a motion as quick aslightning, he with one single stroke dashed the pistols from the hand of eachconstable. As he did this, all hands fell upon him, and, after beating him sometime, they finally overpowered him, and got him tied.During the scuffle, I managed, I know not how, to get my pass out, and, withoutbeing discovered, put it into the fire. We were all now tied; and just as wewere to leave for Easton jail, Betsy Freeland, mother of William Freeland, cameto the door with her hands full of biscuits, and divided them between Henry andJohn. She then delivered herself of a speech, to the followingeffect:—addressing herself to me, she said, “You devil! You yellow devil! it wasyou that put it into the heads of Henry and John to run away. But for you, youlong-legged mulatto devil!35[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos338860] Henry nor Johnwould never have thought of such a thing.” I made no reply, and was immediatelyhurried off towards St. Michael’s. Just a moment previous to the scuffle withHenry, Mr. Hamilton suggested the propriety of making a search for theprotections which he had understood Frederick had written for himself and therest. But, just at the moment he was about carrying his proposal into effect,his aid was needed in helping to tie Henry; and the excitement attending thescuffle caused them either to forget, or to deem it unsafe, under thecircumstances, to search. So we were not yet convicted of the intention to runaway.When we got about half way to St. Michael‘s, while the constables having us incharge were looking ahead, Henry inquired of me what he should do with his pass.I told him to eat it with his biscuit, and own nothing; and we passed the wordaround, “Own nothing;” and “Own nothing!”36[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos339472] said we all. Ourconfidence in each other was unshaken. We were resolved to succeed or failtogether, after the calamity had befallen us as much as before. We were nowprepared for any thing. We were to be dragged that morning fifteen miles behindhorses, and then to be placed in the Easton jail. When we reached St. Michael’s,we underwent a sort of examination. We all denied that we ever intended to runaway. We did this more to bring out the evidence against us, than from any hopeof getting clear of being sold; for, as I have said, we were ready for that. Thefact was, we cared but little where we went, so we went together. Our greatestconcern was about separation. We dreaded that more than any thing this side ofdeath. We found the evidence against us to be the testimony of one person; ourmaster would not tell who it was; but we came to a unanimous decision amongourselves as to who their informant was. We were sent off to the jail at Easton.When we got there, we were delivered up to the sheriff, Mr. Joseph Graham, andby him placed in jail. Henry, John, and myself, were placed in one roomtogether—Charles, and Henry Bailey, in another. Their object in separating uswas to hinder concert.We had been in jail scarcely twenty minutes, when a swarm of slave traders, andagents for slave traders, flocked into jail to look at us, and to ascertain ifwe were for sale. Such a set of beings I never saw before! I felt myselfsurrounded by so many fiends from perdition. A band of pirates never looked morelike their father, the devil. They laughed and grinned over us, saying, “Ah, myboys! we have got you, haven’t we?” And after taunting us in various ways, theyone by one went into an examination of us, with intent to ascertain our value.They would impudently ask us if we would not like to have them for our masters.We would make them no answer, and leave them to find out as best they could.Then they would curse and swear at us, telling us that they could take the devilout of us in a very little while, if we were only in their hands.While in jail, we found ourselves in much more comfortable quarters than weexpected when we went there. We did not get much to eat, nor that which was verygood; but we had a good clean room, from the windows of which we could see whatwas going on in the street, which was very much better than though we had beenplaced in one of the dark, damp cells. Upon the whole, we got along very well,so far as the jail and its keeper were concerned. Immediately after the holidayswere over, contrary to all our expectations, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Freeland cameup to Easton, and took Charles, the two Henrys, and John, out of jail, andcarried them home, leaving me alone. I regarded this separation as a final one.It caused me more pain than any thing else in the whole transaction. I was readyfor any thing rather than separation. I supposed that they had consultedtogether, and had decided that, as I was the whole cause of the intention of theothers to run away, it was hard to make the innocent suffer with the guilty; andthat they had, therefore, concluded to take the others home, and sell me, as awarning to the others that remained. It is due to the noble Henry to say, heseemed almost as reluctant at leaving the prison as at leaving home to come tothe prison. But we knew we should, in all probability, be separated, if we weresold; and since he was in their hands, he concluded to go peaceably home.I was now left to my fate. I was all alone, and within the walls of a stoneprison. But a few days before, and I was full of hope. I expected to have beensafe in a land of freedom; but now I was covered with gloom, sunk down to theutmost despair. I thought the possibility of freedom was gone. I was kept inthis way about one week, at the end of which, Captain Auld, my master, to mysurprise and utter astonishment, came up, and took me out, with the intention ofsending me, with a gentleman of his acquaintance, into Alabama. But, from somecause or other, he did not send me to Alabama, but concluded to send me back toBaltimore, to live again with his brother Hugh, and to learn a trade.Thus, after an absence of three years and one month, I was once more permittedto return to my old home at Baltimore. My master sent me away, because thereexisted against me a very great prejudice in the community, and he feared Imight be killed.In a few weeks after I went to Baltimore, Master Hugh hired me to Mr. WilliamGardner, an extensive ship-builder, on Fell’s Point. I was put there to learnhow to calk. It, however, proved a very unfavorable place for the accomplishmentof this object. Mr. Gardner was engaged that spring in building two largeman-of-war brigs, professedly for the Mexican government. The vessels were to belaunched in the July of that year, and in failure thereof, Mr. Gardner was tolose a considerable sum; so that when I entered, all was hurry. There was notime to learn any thing. Every man had to do that which he knew how to do. Inentering the ship-yard, my orders from Mr. Gardner were, to do whatever thecarpenters commanded me to do. This was placing me at the beck and call of aboutseventy-five men. I was to regard all these as masters. Their word was to be mylaw. My situation was a most trying one. At times I needed a dozen pair ofhands. I was called a dozen ways in the space of a single minute. Three or fourvoices would strike my ear at the same moment. It was—“Fred., come help me tocant this timbercc[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos394655] here.”—“Fred.,come carry this timber yonder.”—“Fred., bring that roller here.”—“Fred., go geta fresh can of water.”—“Fred., come help saw off the end of thistimber.”—“Fred., go quick, and get the crowbar.”—“Fred., hold on the end of thisfall.”—“Fred., go to the blacksmith’s shop, and get a new punch.”—“Hurra, Fred.!run and bring me a cold chisel.”—“I say, Fred., bear a hand, and get up a fireas quick as lightning under that steam-box.”—“Halloo, nigger! come, turn thisgrindstone.”—“Come, come! move, move! and bowsecd[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos394853] this timberforward.”—“I say, darky, blast your eyes, why don’t you heat up somepitch?”—“Halloo! halloo! halloo!” (Three voices at the same time.) “Comehere!—Go there!—Hold on where you are! Damn you, if you move, I’ll knock yourbrains out!”This was my school for eight months; and I might have remained there longer, butfor a most horrid fight I had with four of the white apprentices, in which myleft eye was nearly knocked out, and I was horribly mangled in other respects.The facts in the case were these: Until a very little while after I went there,white and black ship-carpenters worked side by side, and no one seemed to seeany impropriety in it. All hands seemed to be very well satisfied. Many of theblack carpenters were free men. Things seemed to be going on very well. All atonce, the white carpenters knocked off, and said they would not work with freecolored workmen. Their reason for this, as alleged, was, that if free coloredcarpenters were encouraged, they would soon take the trade into their own hands,and poor white men would be thrown out of employment. They therefore felt calledupon at once to put a stop to it. And, taking advantage of Mr. Gardner’snecessities, they broke off, swearing they would work no longer, unless he woulddischarge his black carpenters. Now, though this did not extend to me in form,it did reach me in fact. My fellow-apprentices very soon began to feel itdegrading to them to work with me. They began to put on airs, and talk about the“niggers” taking the country, saying we all ought to be killed; and, beingencouraged by the journeymen, they commenced making my condition as hard as theycould, by hectoring me around, and sometimes striking me. I, of course, kept thevow I made after the fight with Mr. Covey, and struck back again, regardless ofconsequences; and while I kept them from combining, I succeeded very well; for Icould whip the whole of them, taking them separately. They, however, at lengthcombined, and came upon me, armed with sticks, stones, and heavy handspikes. Onecame in front with a half brick. There was one at each side of me, and onebehind me. While I was attending to those in front, and on either side, the onebehind ran up with the handspike, and struck me a heavy blow upon the head. Itstunned me. I fell, and with this they all ran upon me, and fell to beating mewith their fists. I let them lay on for a while, gathering strength. In aninstant, I gave a sudden surge, and rose to my hands and knees. Just as I didthat, one of their number gave me, with his heavy boot, a powerful kick in theleft eye. My eyeball seemed to have burst. When they saw my eye closed, andbadly swollen, they left me. With this I seized the handspike, and for a timepursued them. But here the carpenters interfered, and I thought I might as wellgive it up. It was impossible to stand my hand against so many. All this tookplace in sight of not less than fifty white ship-carpenters, and not oneinterposed a friendly word; but some cried, “Kill the damned nigger! Kill him!kill him! He struck a white person.” I found my only chance for life was inflight. I succeeded in getting away without an additional blow, and barely so;for to strike a white man is death by Lynch law,37[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos339777]—and that was thelaw in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard; nor is there much of any other out of Mr.Gardner’s ship-yard.I went directly home, and told the story of my wrongs to Master Hugh; and I amhappy to say of him, irreligious as he was, his conduct was heavenly, comparedwith that of his brother Thomas under similar circumstances. He listenedattentively to my narration of the circumstances leading to the savage outrage,and gave many proofs of his strong indignation at it. The heart of my onceoverkind mistress was again melted into pity. My puffed-out eye andblood-covered face moved her to tears. She took a chair by me, washed the bloodfrom my face, and, with a mother’s tenderness, bound up my head, covering thewounded eye with a lean piece of fresh beef. It was almost compensation for mysuffering to witness, once more, a manifestation of kindness from this, my onceaffectionate old mistress. Master Hugh was very much enraged. He gave expressionto his feelings by pouring out curses upon the heads of those who did the deed.As soon as I got a little the better of my bruises, he took me with him toEsquire Watson‘s, on Bond Street, to see what could be done about the matter.Mr. Watson inquired who saw the assault committed. Master Hugh told him it wasdone in Mr. Gardner’s ship-yard, at midday, where there were a large company ofmen at work. “As to that,” he said, “the deed was done, and there was noquestion as to who did it.” His answer was, he could do nothing in the case,unless some white man would come forward and testify. He could issue no warranton my word. If I had been killed in the presence of a thousand colored people,their testimony combined would have been insufficient to have arrested one ofthe murderers. Master Hugh, for once, was compelled to say this state of thingswas too bad. Of course, it was impossible to get any white man to volunteer histestimony in my behalf, and against the white young men. Even those who may havesympathized with me were not prepared to do this. It required a degree ofcourage unknown to them to do so; for just at that time, the slightestmanifestation of humanity toward a colored person was denounced as abolitionism,and that name subjected its bearer to frightful liabilities. The watchwords ofthe bloody-minded in that region, and in those days, were, “Damn theabolitionists!” and “Damn the niggers!” There was nothing done, and probablynothing would have been done if I had been killed. Such was, and such remains,the state of things in the Christian city of Baltimore.Master Hugh, finding he could get no redress, refused to let me go back again toMr. Gardner. He kept me himself, and his wife dressed my wound till I was againrestored to health. He then took me into the ship-yard of which he was foreman,in the employment of Mr. Walter Price. There I was immediately set to calking,and very soon learned the art of using my mallet and irons.ce[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos395026] In the course ofone year from the time I left Mr. Gardner‘s, I was able to command the highestwages given to the most experienced calkers. I was now of some importance to mymaster. I was bringing him from six to seven dollars per week. I sometimesbrought him nine dollars per week: my wages were a dollar and a half a day.After learning how to calk, I sought my own employment, made my own contracts,and collected the money which I earned. My pathway became much more smooth thanbefore; my condition was now much more comfortable. When I could get no calkingto do, I did nothing. During these leisure times, those old notions aboutfreedom would steal over me again. When in Mr. Gardner’s employment, I was keptin such a perpetual whirl of excitement, I could think of nothing, scarcely, butmy life; and in thinking of my life, I almost forgot my liberty. I have observedthis in my experience of slavery,—that whenever my condition was improved,instead of its increasing my contentment, it only increased my desire to befree, and set me to thinking of plans to gain my freedom. I have found that, tomake a contented slave, it is necessary to make a thoughtless one. It isnecessary to darken his moral and mental vision, and, as far as possible, toannihilate the power of reason. He must be able to detect no inconsistencies inslavery; he must be made to feel that slavery is right; and he can be brought tothat only when he ceases to be a man.I was now getting, as I have said, one dollar and fifty cents per day. Icontracted for it; I earned it; it was paid to me; it was rightfully my own;yet, upon each returning Saturday night, I was compelled to deliver every centof that money to Master Hugh. And why? Not because he earned it,—not because hehad any hand in earning it,—not because I owed it to him,—nor because hepossessed the slightest shadow of a right to it; but solely because he had thepower to compel me to give it up. The right of the grim-visaged pirate upon thehigh seas is exactly the same."},{"pageContent":"CHAPTER XI[images/00017.jpg]I NOW COME TO that part of my life during which I planned, and finally succeededin making, my escape from slavery. But before narrating any of the peculiarcircumstances, I deem it proper to make known my intention not to state all thefacts connected with the transaction. My reasons for pursuing this course may beunderstood from the following: First, were I to give a minute statement of allthe facts, it is not only possible, but quite probable, that others wouldthereby be involved in the most embarrassing difficulties. Secondly, such astatement would most undoubtedly induce greater vigilance on the part ofslaveholders than has existed heretofore among them; which would, of course, bethe means of guarding a door whereby some dear brother bondman might escape hisgalling chains. I deeply regret the necessity that impels me to suppress anything of importance connected with my experience in slavery. It would afford megreat pleasure indeed, as well as materially add to the interest of mynarrative, were I at liberty to gratify a curiosity, which I know exists in theminds of many, by an accurate statement of all the facts pertaining to my mostfortunate escape. But I must deprive myself of this pleasure, and the curious ofthe gratification which such a statement would afford. I would allow myself tosuffer under the greatest imputations which evil-minded men might suggest,rather than exculpate myself,cf[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos395212] and thereby runthe hazard of closing the slightest avenue by which a brother slave might clearhimself of the chains and fetters of slavery.I have never approved of the very public manner in which some of our westernfriends have conducted what they call the underground railroad,38[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos340143] but which, Ithink, by their open declarations, has been made most emphatically theupperground railroad. I honor those good men and women for their noble daring,and applaud them for willingly subjecting themselves to bloody persecution, byopenly avowing their participation in the escape of slaves. I, however, can seevery lit tle good resulting from such a course, either to themselves or theslaves escaping; while, upon the other hand, I see and feel assured that thoseopen declarations are a positive evil to the slaves remaining, who are seekingto escape. They do nothing towards enlightening the slave, whilst they do muchtowards enlightening the master. They stimulate him to greater watchfulness, andenhance his power to capture his slave. We owe something to the slaves south ofthe line as well as to those north of it; and in aiding the latter on their wayto freedom, we should be careful to do nothing which would be likely to hinderthe former from escaping from slavery. I would keep the merciless slaveholderprofoundly ignorant of the means of flight adopted by the slave. I would leavehim to imagine himself surrounded by myriads of invisible tormentors, ever readyto snatch from his infernal grasp his trembling prey. Let him be left to feelhis way in the dark; let darkness commensurate with his crime hover over him;and let him feel that at every step he takes, in pursuit of the flying bondman,he is running the frightful risk of having his hot brains dashed out by aninvisible agency. Let us render the tyrant no aid; let us not hold the light bywhich he can trace the footprints of our flying brother. But enough of this. Iwill now proceed to the statement of those facts, connected with my escape, forwhich I am alone responsible, and for which no one can be made to suffer butmyself.In the early part of the year 1838, I became quite restless. I could see noreason why I should, at the end of each week, pour the reward of my toil intothe purse of my master. When I carried to him my weekly wages, he would, aftercounting the money, look me in the face with a robber-like fierceness, and ask,“Is this all?” He was satisfied with nothing less than the last cent. He would,however, when I made him six dollars, sometimes give me six cents, to encourageme. It had the opposite effect. I regarded it as a sort of admission of my rightto the whole. The fact that he gave me any part of my wages was proof, to mymind, that he believed me entitled to the whole of them. I always felt worse forhaving received any thing; for I feared that the giving me a few cents wouldease his conscience, and make him feel himself to be a pretty honorable sort ofrobber. My discontent grew upon me. I was ever on the look-out for means ofescape; and, finding no direct means, I determined to try to hire my time, witha view of getting money with which to make my escape. In the spring of 1838,when Master Thomas came to Baltimore to purchase his spring goods, I got anopportunity, and applied to him to allow me to hire my time. He unhesitatinglyrefused my request, and told me this was another stratagem by which to escape.He told me I could go nowhere but that he could get me; and that, in the eventof my running away, he should spare no pains in his efforts to catch me. Heexhorted me to content myself, and be obedient. He told me, if I would be happy,I must lay out no plans for the future. He said, if I behaved myself properly,he would take care of me. Indeed, he advised me to complete thoughtlessness ofthe future, and taught me to depend solely upon him for happiness. He seemed tosee fully the pressing necessity of setting aside my intellectual nature, inorder to contentment in slavery. But in spite of him, and even in spite ofmyself, I continued to think, and to think about the injustice of myenslavement, and the means of escape.About two months after this, I applied to Master Hugh for the privilege ofhiring my time. He was not acquainted with the fact that I had applied to MasterThomas, and had been refused. He too, at first, seemed disposed to refuse; but,after some reflection, he granted me the privilege, and proposed the followingterms: I was to be allowed all my time, make all contracts with those for whom Iworked, and find my own employment; and, in return for this liberty, I was topay him three dollars at the end of each week; find myself in calking tools, andin board and clothing. My board was two dollars and a half per week. This, withthe wear and tear of clothing and calking tools, made my regular expenses aboutsix dollars per week. This amount I was compelled to make up, or relinquish theprivilege of hiring my time. Rain or shine, work or no work, at the end of eachweek the money must be forthcoming, or I must give up my privilege. Thisarrangement, it will be perceived, was decidedly in my master’s favor. Itrelieved him of all need of looking after me. His money was sure. He receivedall the benefits of slaveholding without its evils; while I endured all theevils of a slave, and suffered all the care and anxiety of a freeman. I found ita hard bargain. But, hard as it was, I thought it better than the old mode ofgetting along. It was a step towards freedom to be allowed to bear theresponsibilities of a freeman, and I was determined to hold on upon it. I bentmyself to the work of making money. I was ready to work at night as well as day,and by the most untiring perseverance and industry, I made enough to meet myexpenses, and lay up a little money every week. I went on thus from May tillAugust. Master Hugh then refused to allow me to hire my time longer. The groundfor his refusal was a failure on my part, one Saturday night, to pay him for myweek’s time. This failure was occasioned by my attending a camp meeting aboutten miles from Baltimore. During the week, I had entered into an engagement witha number of young friends to start from Baltimore to the camp ground earlySaturday evening; and being detained by my employer, I was unable to get down toMaster Hugh’s without disappointing the company. I knew that Master Hugh was inno special need of the money that night. I therefore decided to go to campmeeting, and upon my return pay him the three dollars. I staid [sic] at the campmeeting one day longer than I intended when I left. But as soon as I returned, Icalled upon him to pay him what he considered his due. I found him very angry;he could scarce restrain his wrath. He said he had a great mind to give me asevere whipping. He wished to know how I dared go out of the city without askinghis permission. I told him I hired my time, and while I paid him the price whichhe asked for it, I did not know that I was bound to ask him when and where Ishould go. This reply troubled him; and, after reflecting a few moments, heturned to me, and said I should hire my time no longer; that the next thing heshould know of, I would be running away. Upon the same plea, he told me to bringmy tools and clothing home forthwith. I did so; but instead of seeking work, asI had been accustomed to do previously to hiring my time, I spent the whole weekwithout the performance of a single stroke of work. I did this in retaliation.Saturday night, he called upon me as usual for my week’s wages. I told him I hadno wages; I had done no work that week. Here we were upon the point of coming toblows. He raved, and swore his determination to get hold of me. I did not allowmyself a single word; but was resolved, if he laid the weight of his hand uponme, it should be blow for blow. He did not strike me, but told me that he wouldfind me in constant employment in future. I thought the matter over during thenext day, Sunday, and finally resolved upon the third day of September, as theday upon which I would make a second attempt to secure my freedom. I now hadthree weeks during which to prepare for my journey. Early on Monday morning,before Master Hugh had time to make any engagement for me, I went out and gotemployment of Mr. Butler, at his ship-yard near the draw-bridge, upon what iscalled the City Block, thus making it unnecessary for him to seek employment forme. At the end of the week, I brought him between eight and nine dollars. Heseemed very well pleased, and asked me why I did not do the same the weekbefore. He little knew what my plans were. My object in working steadily was toremove any suspicion he might entertain of my intent to run away; and in this Isucceeded admirably. I suppose he thought I was never better satisfied with mycondition than at the very time during which I was planning my escape. Thesecond week passed, and again I carried him my full wages; and so well pleasedwas he, that he gave me twenty-five cents, (quite a large sum for a slaveholderto give a slave,) and bade me to make a good use of it. I told him I would.Things went on without very smoothly indeed, but within there was trouble. It isimpossible for me to describe my feelings as the time of my contemplated startdrew near. I had a number of warm-hearted friends in Baltimore,—friends that Iloved almost as I did my life,—and the thought of being separated from themforever was painful beyond expression. It is my opinion that thousands wouldescape from slavery, who now remain, but for the strong cords of affection thatbind them to their friends. The thought of leaving my friends was decidedly themost painful thought with which I had to contend. The love of them was my tenderpoint, and shook my decision more than all things else. Besides the pain ofseparation, the dread and apprehension of a failure exceeded what I hadexperienced at my first attempt. The appalling defeat I then sustained returnedto torment me. I felt assured that, if I failed in this attempt, my case wouldbe a hopeless one—it would seal my fate as a slave forever. I could not hope toget off with any thing less than the severest punishment, and being placedbeyond the means of escape. It required no very vivid imagination to depict themost frightful scenes through which I should have to pass, in case I failed. Thewretchedness of slavery, and the blessedness of freedom, were perpetually beforeme. It was life and death with me. But I remained firm, and, according to myresolution, on the third day of September, 1838, I left my chains, and succeededin reaching New York without the slightest interruption of any kind. How I didso,—what means I adopted,—what direction I travelled, and by what mode ofconveyance,—I must leave unexplained, for the reasons before mentioned.I have been frequently asked how I felt when I found myself in a free State. Ihave never been able to answer the question with any satisfaction to myself. Itwas a moment of the highest excitement I ever experienced. I suppose I felt asone may imagine the unarmed mariner to feel when he is rescued by a friendlyman-of-war from the pursuit of a pirate. In writing to a dear friend,immediately after my arrival at New York, I said I felt like one who had escapeda den of hungry lions. This state of mind, however, very soon subsided; and Iwas again seized with a feeling of great insecurity and loneliness. I was yetliable to be taken back, and subjected to all the tortures of slavery. This initself was enough to damp the ardor of my enthusiasm. But the lonelinessovercame me. There I was in the midst of thousands, and yet a perfect stranger;without home and without friends, in the midst of thousands of my ownbrethren—children of a common Father, and yet I dared not to unfold to any oneof them my sad condition. I was afraid to speak to any one for fear of speakingto the wrong one, and thereby falling into the hands of money-loving kidnappers,whose business it was to lie in wait for the panting fugitive, as the ferociousbeasts of the forest lie in wait for their prey. The motto which I adopted whenI started from slavery was this—“Trust no man!” I saw in every white man anenemy, and in almost every colored man cause for distrust. It was a most painfulsituation; and, to understand it, one must needs experience it, or imaginehimself in similar circumstances. Let him be a fugitive slave in a strangeland—a land given up to be the hunting-ground for slaveholders—whose inhabitantsare legalized kidnappers—where he is every moment subjected to the terribleliability of being seized upon by his fellow-men, as the hideous crocodileseizes upon his prey!—I say, let him place himself in my situation—without homeor friends—without money or credit—wanting shelter, and no one to giveit—wanting bread, and no money to buy it,—and at the same time let him feel thathe is pursued by merciless men-hunters, and in total darkness as to what to do,where to go, or where to stay,—perfectly helpless both as to the means ofdefence and means of escape,—in the midst of plenty, yet suffering the terriblegnawings of hunger,—in the midst of houses, yet having no home,—amongfellow-men, yet feeling as if in the midst of wild beasts, whose greediness toswallow up the trembling and half famished fugitive is only equalled by thatwith which the monsters of the deep swallow up the helpless fish upon which theysubsist,—I say, let him be placed in this most trying situation,—the situationin which I was placed,—then, and not till then, will he fully appreciate thehardships of, and know how to sympathize with, the toil-worn and whip-scarredfugitive slave.Thank Heaven, I remained but a short time in this distressed situation. I wasrelieved from it by the humane hand of MR. DAVID RUGGLES,39[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos340430] whose vigilance,kindness, and perseverance, I shall never forget. I am glad of an opportunity toexpress, as far as words can, the love and gratitude I bear him. Mr. Ruggles isnow afflicted with blindness, and is himself in need of the same kind officeswhich he was once so forward in the performance of toward others. I had been inNew York but a few days, when Mr. Ruggles sought me out, and very kindly took meto his boarding-house at the corner of Church and Lespenard Streets. Mr. Ruggleswas then very deeply engaged in the memorable Darg case,40[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos340923] as well asattending to a number of other fugitive slaves, devising ways and means fortheir successful escape; and, though watched and hemmed in on almost every side,he seemed to be more than a match for his enemies.Very soon after I went to Mr. Ruggles, he wished to know of me where I wanted togo; as he deemed it unsafe for me to remain in New York. I told him I was acalker, and should like to go where I could get work. I thought of going toCanada; but he decided against it, and in favor of my going to New Bedford,thinking I should be able to get work there at my trade. At this time, Anna, myintended wife,41 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos341265]came on; for I wrote to her immediately after my arrival at New York,(notwithstanding my homeless, houseless, and helpless condition,) informing herof my successful flight, and wishing her to come on forthwith. In a few daysafter her arrival, Mr. Ruggles called in the Rev. J. W. C. Pennington, who, inthe presence of Mr. Ruggles, Mrs. Michaels, and two or three others, performedthe marriage ceremony, and gave us a certificate, of which the following is anexact copy:—> THIS may certify, that I joined together in holy matrimony Frederick Johnsoncg> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos395397] and Anna> Murray, as man and wife, in the presence of Mr. David Ruggles and Mrs.> Michaels.> James W. C. Pennington.42> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos341687]> New York, Sept. 15, 1838.Upon receiving this certificate, and a five-dollar bill from Mr. Ruggles, Ishouldered one part of our baggage, and Anna took up the other, and we set outforthwith to take passage on board of the steamboat John W Richmond for Newport,on our way to New Bedford. Mr. Ruggles gave me a letter to a Mr. Shaw inNewport, and told me, in case my money did not serve me to New Bedford, to stopin Newport and obtain further assistance; but upon our arrival at Newport, wewere so anxious to get to a place of safety, that, notwithstanding we lacked thenecessary money to pay our fare, we decided to take seats in the stage, andpromise to pay when we got to New Bedford. We were encouraged to do this by twoexcellent gentlemen, residents of New Bedford, whose names I afterwardascertained to be Joseph Ricketson and William C. Taber. They seemed at once tounderstand our circumstances, and gave us such assurance of their friendlinessas put us fully at ease in their presence. It was good indeed to meet with suchfriends, at such a time. Upon reaching New Bedford, we were directed to thehouse of Mr. Nathan Johnson, by whom we were kindly received, and hospitablyprovided for. Both Mr. and Mrs. Johnson took a deep and lively interest in ourwelfare. They proved themselves quite worthy of the name of abolitionists. Whenthe stage-driver found us unable to pay our fare, he held on upon our baggage assecurity for the debt. I had but to mention the fact to Mr. Johnson, and heforthwith advanced the money.We now began to feel a degree of safety, and to prepare ourselves for the dutiesand responsibilities of a life of freedom. On the morning after our arrival atNew Bedford, while at the breakfast-table, the question arose as to what name Ishould be called by. The name given me by my mother was, “Frederick AugustusWashington Bailey.” I, however, had dispensed with the two middle names longbefore I left Maryland so that I was generally known by the name of “FrederickBailey.“ I started from Baltimore bearing the name of ”Stanley.“ When I got toNew York, I again changed my name to ”Frederick Johnson,“ and thought that wouldbe the last change. But when I got to New Bedford, I found it necessary again tochange my name. The reason of this necessity was, that there were so manyJohnsons in New Bedford, it was already quite difficult to distinguish betweenthem. I gave Mr. Johnson the privilege of choosing me a name, but told him hemust not take from me the name of ”Frederick.“ I must hold on to that, topreserve a sense of my identity. Mr. Johnson had just been reading the ”Lady ofthe Lake,“ and at once suggested that my name be ”Douglass.“43[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos342230] From that timeuntil now I have been called ”Frederick Douglass;“ and as I am more widely knownby that name than by either of the others, I shall continue to use it as my own.I was quite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford.44[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos343315] The impressionwhich I had received respecting the character and condition of the people of thenorth, I found to be singularly erroneous. I had very strangely supposed, whilein slavery, that few of the comforts, and scarcely any of the luxuries, of lifewere enjoyed at the north, compared with what were enjoyed by the slaveholdersof the south. I probably came to this conclusion from the fact that northernpeople owned no slaves. I supposed that they were about upon a level with thenon-slaveholding population of the south. I knew they were exceedingly poor, andI had been accustomed to regard their poverty as the necessary consequence oftheir being non-slaveholders. I had somehow imbibed the opinion that, in theabsence of slaves, there could be no wealth, and very little refinement. Andupon coming to the north, I expected to meet with a rough, hard-handed, anduncultivated population, living in the most Spartan-like simplicity, knowingnothing of the ease, luxury, pomp, and grandeur of southern slaveholders. Suchbeing my conjectures, any one acquainted with the appearance of New Bedford mayvery readily infer how palpably I must have seen my mistake.In the afternoon of the day when I reached New Bedford, I visited the wharves,to take a view of the shipping. Here I found myself surrounded with thestrongest proofs of wealth. Lying at the wharves, and riding in the stream, Isaw many ships of the finest model, in the best order, and of the largest size.Upon the right and left, I was walled in by granite warehouses of the widestdimensions, stowed to their utmost capacity with the necessaries and comforts oflife. Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so,compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loudsongs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard no deepoaths or horrid curses on the laborer. I saw no whipping of men; but all seemedto go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand his work, and went at itwith a sober, yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest whichhe felt in what he was doing, as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man. Tome this looked exceedingly strange. From the wharves I strolled around and overthe town, gazing with wonder and admiration at the splendid churches, beautifuldwellings, and finely-cultivated gardens; evincing an amount of wealth, comfort,taste, and refinement, such as I had never seen in any part of slaveholdingMaryland.Every thing looked clean, new, and beautiful. I saw few or no dilapidatedhouses, with poverty-stricken inmates; no half-naked children and barefootedwomen, such as I had been accustomed to see in Hillsborough, Easton, St.Michael‘s, and Baltimore. The people looked more able, stronger, healthier, andhappier, than those of Maryland. I was for once made glad by a view of extremewealth, without being saddened by seeing extreme poverty. But the mostastonishing as well as the most interesting thing to me was the condition of thecolored people, a great many of whom, like myself, had escaped thither as arefuge from the hunters of men. I found many, who had not been seven years outof their chains, living in finer houses, and evidently enjoying more of thecomforts of life, than the average of slaveholders in Maryland. I will ventureto assert that my friend Mr. Nathan Johnson (of whom I can say with a gratefulheart, “I was hungry, and he gave me meat; I was thirsty, and he gave me drink;I was a stranger, and he took me in”)ch[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos395653] lived in a neaterhouse; dined at a better table; took, paid for, and read, more newspapers;better understood the moral, religious, and political character of thenation,—than nine tenths of the slave holders in Talbot county, Maryland. YetMr. Johnson was a working man. His hands were hardened by toil, and not hisalone, but those also of Mrs. Johnson. I found the colored people much morespirited than I had supposed they would be. I found among them a determinationto protect each other from the blood-thirsty kidnapper, at all hazards. Soonafter my arrival, I was told of a circumstance which illustrated their spirit. Acolored man and a fugitive slave were on unfriendly terms. The former was heardto threaten the latter with informing his master of his whereabouts. Straightwaya meeting was called among the colored people, under the stereotyped notice,“Business of importance!” The betrayer was invited to attend. The people came atthe appointed hour, and organized the meeting by appointing a very religious oldgentleman as president, who, I believe, made a prayer, after which he addressedthe meeting as follows: “Friends, we have got him here, and I would recommendthat you young men just take him outside the door, and kill him!” With this, anumber of them bolted at him; but they were intercepted by some more timid thanthemselves, and the betrayer escaped their vengeance, and has not been seen inNew Bedford since. I believe there have been no more such threats, and shouldthere be hereafter, I doubt not that death would be the consequence.I found employment, the third day after my arrival, in stowing a sloop with aload of oil. It was new, dirty, and hard work for me; but I went at it with aglad heart and a willing hand. I was now my own master. It was a happy moment,the rapture of which can be understood only by those who have been slaves. Itwas the first work, the reward of which was to be entirely my own. There was noMaster Hugh standing ready, the moment I earned the money, to rob me of it. Iworked that day with a pleasure I had never before experienced. I was at workfor myself and newly-married wife. It was to me the starting-point of a newexistence. When I got through with that job, I went in pursuit of a job ofcalking; but such was the strength of prejudice against color, among the whitecalkers, that they refused to work with me, and of course I could get noemployment.ci [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos395853]Finding my trade of no immediate benefit, I threw off my calking habiliments,cj[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos396146] and preparedmyself to do any kind of work I could get to do. Mr. Johnson kindly let me havehis woodhorse and saw, and I very soon found myself a plenty of work. There wasno work too hard—none too dirty. I was ready to saw wood, shovel coal, carry thehod,ck [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos396316] sweep thechim ney, or roll oil casks,—all of which I did for nearly three years in NewBedford, before I became known to the anti-slavery world.In about four months after I went to New Bedford, there came a young man to me,and inquired if I did not wish to take the “Liberator.” cl[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos396528] I told him I did;but, just having made my escape from slavery, I remarked that I was unable topay for it then. I, however, finally became a subscriber to it. The paper came,and I read it from week to week with such feelings as it would be quite idle forme to attempt to describe. The paper became my meat and my drink. My soul wasset all on fire. Its sympathy for my brethren in bonds—its scathingdenunciations of slaveholders—its faithful exposures of slavery—and its powerfulattacks upon the upholders of the institution—sent a thrill of joy through mysoul, such as I had never felt before!I had not long been a reader of the “Liberator,” before I got a pretty correctidea of the principles, measures, and spirit of the anti slavery reform. I tookright hold of the cause. I could do but little; but what I could, I did with ajoyful heart, and never felt happier than when in an anti-slavery meeting. Iseldom had much to say at the meetings, because what I wanted to say was said somuch better by others. But, while attending an anti-slavery convention atNantucket, on the 11th of August, 1841, I felt strongly moved to speak, and wasat the same time much urged to do so by Mr. William C. Coffin, a gentleman whohad heard me speak in the colored people’s meeting at New Bedford. It was asevere cross, and I took it up reluctantly. The truth was, I felt myself aslave, and the idea of speaking to white people weighed me down. I spoke but afew moments, when I felt a degree of freedom, and said what I desired withconsiderable ease. From that time until now, I have been engaged in pleading thecause of my brethren—with what success, and with what devotion, I leave thoseacquainted with my labors to decide."},{"pageContent":"APPENDIX[images/00015.jpg]I FIND, SINCE READING over the foregoing Narrative that I have, in severalinstances, spoken in such a tone and manner, respecting religion, as maypossibly lead those unacquainted with my religious views to suppose me anopponent of all religion. To remove the liability of such misapprehension, Ideem it proper to append the following brief explanation. What I have saidrespecting and against religion, I mean strictly to apply to the slaveholdingreligion of this land, and with no possible reference to Christianity proper;for, between the Christianity of this land, and the Christianity of Christ, Irecognize the widest possible difference—so wide, that to receive the one asgood, pure, and holy, is of necessity to reject the other as bad, corrupt, andwicked. To be the friend of the one, is of necessity to be the enemy of theother. I love the pure, peaceable, and impartial Christianity of Christ: Itherefore hate the corrupt, slaveholding, women-whipping, cradle-plundering,partial and hypocritical Christianity of this land. Indeed, I can see no reason,but the most deceitful one, for calling the religion of this land Christianity.I look upon it as the climax of all misnomers, the boldest of all frauds, andthe grossest of all libels. Never was there a clearer case of “stealing thelivery of the court of heaven to serve the devil in.”45[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos343759] I am filled withunutterable loathing when I contemplate the religious pomp and show, togetherwith the horrible inconsistencies, which every where surround me. We havemen-stealers for ministers, women-whippers for missionaries, andcradle-plunderers for church members. The man who wields the blood-clottedcowskin during the week fills the pulpit on Sunday, and claims to be a ministerof the meek and lowly Jesus. The man who robs me of my earnings at the end ofeach week meets me as a class-leader on Sunday morning, to show me the way oflife, and the path of salvation. He who sells my sister, for purposes ofprostitution, stands forth as the pious advocate of purity. He who proclaims ita religious duty to read the Bible denies me the right of learning to read thename of God who made me. He who is the religious advocate of marriage robs wholemillions of its sacred influence, and leaves them to the ravages of wholesalepollution. The warm defender of the sacredness of the family relation is thesame that scatters whole families,—sundering husbands and wives, parents andchildren, sisters and brothers,—leaving the hut vacant, and the hearth desolate.We see the thief preaching against theft, and the adulterer against adultery. Wehave men sold to build churches, women sold to support the gospel, and babessold to purchase Bibles for the poor heathen! all for the glory of God and thegood of souls! The slave auctioneer’s bell and the church-going bell chime inwith each other, and the bitter cries of the heart-broken slave are drowned inthe religious shouts of his pious master. Revivals of religion and revivals inthe slave-trade go hand in hand together. The slave prison and the church standnear each other. The clanking of fetters and the rattling of chains in theprison, and the pious psalm and solemn prayer in the church, may be heard at thesame time. The dealers in the bodies and souls of men erect their stand in thepresence of the pulpit, and they mutually help each other. The dealer gives hisblood-stained gold to support the pulpit, and the pulpit, in return, covers hisinfernal business with the garb of Christianity. Here we have religion androbbery the allies of each other—devils dressed in angels’ robes, and hellpresenting the semblance of paradise.> Just God! and these are they,> Who minister at thine altar, God of right!> Men who their hands, with prayer and blessing, lay> On Israel’s ark of light.cm> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos396778]> What! preach, and kidnap men?> Give thanks, and rob thy own afflicted poor?> Talk of thy glorious liberty, and then> Bolt hard the captive’s door?> What! servants of thy own> Merciful Son, who came to seek and save> The homeless and the outcast, fettering down> The tasked and plundered slave!> Pilate and Herod friends! 46> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_022.html#filepos344211]> Chief priests and rulers, as of old, combine!> Just God and holy! is that church which lends> Strength to the spoiler thine?cn> [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos397051]The Christianity of America is a Christianity, of whose votaries co[Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos397282] it may be astruly said, as it was of the ancient scribes and Pharisees, “They bind heavyburdens, and grievous to be borne, and lay them on men’s shoulders, but theythemselves will not move them with one of their fingers. All their works they dofor to be seen of men.—They love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chiefseats in the synagogues, ... ... and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.—But woeunto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom ofheaven against men; for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye them thatare entering to go in. Ye devour widows’ houses, and for a pretence make longprayers; therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation. Ye compass sea andland to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more thechild of hell than yourselves.—Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!for ye pay tithe of mint, and anise, and cumin, and have omitted the weightiermatters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith; these ought ye to have done, andnot to leave the other undone. Ye blind guides! which strain at a gnat, andswallow a camel. Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye makeclean the outside of the cup and of the platter; but within, they are full ofextortion and excess.—Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for yeare like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but arewithin full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness. Even so ye alsooutwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy andiniquity.”cp [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_026.html#filepos397462]Dark and terrible as is this picture, I hold it to be strictly true of theoverwhelming mass of professed Christians in America. They strain at a gnat, andswallow a camel. Could any thing be more true of our churches? They would beshocked at the proposition of fel lowshipping a sheep-stealer; and at the sametime they hug to their communion a man-stealer and brand me with being aninfidel, if I find fault with them for it. They attend with Pharisaicalstrictness to the outward forms of religion, and at the same time neglect theweightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith. They are always readyto sacrifice, but seldom to show mercy. They are they who are represented asprofessing to love God whom they have not seen, whilst they hate their brotherwhom they have seen. They love the heathen on the other side of the globe. Theycan pray for him, pay money to have the Bible put into his hand, andmissionaries to instruct him; while they despise and totally neglect the heathenat their own doors.Such is, very briefly, my view of the religion of this land; and to avoid anymisunderstanding, growing out of the use of general terms, I mean, by thereligion of this land, that which is revealed in the words, deeds, and actions,of those bodies, north and south, calling themselves Christian churches, and yetin union with slaveholders. It is against religion, as presented by thesebodies, that I have felt it my duty to testify.I conclude these remarks by copying the following portrait of the religion ofthe south, (which is, by communion and fellowship, the religion of the north,)which I soberly affirm is “true to the life,” and without caricature or theslightest exaggeration. It is said to have been drawn, several years before thepresent anti-slavery agitation began, by a northern Methodist preacher, who,while residing at the south, had an opportunity to see slaveholding morals,manners, and piety, with his own eyes. “Shall I not visit for these things?saith the Lord.

Henry is renownedfor his saying “Give me liberty, or give me death,” delivered in a conventionspeech in 1775; Douglass alludes to these famous words in his Narrative (see p.79).7 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_008.html#filepos84469] (p. 5) John A.Collins: Collins (1810-1879) was an abolitionist and reformer and a member ofthe Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society; he resigned from the Society in 1843.8 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_008.html#filepos86791] (p. 6) CharlesLenox Remond : Born in Massachusetts to free parents, Remond (1810-1873) becamean agent of the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society in 1838; he was the firstAfrican American employed by the Society as a lecturer.

He later clerked in the Boston Custom House.9 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_008.html#filepos87678] (p. 6) DanielO‘Connell: Known as the Liberator, Daniel O’Connell (1775-1847) was an Irishnationalist leader who fought for Catholic emancipation and Irish independence;O‘Connell toured with Douglass in 1842.10 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_008.html#filepos89812] (p. 8) SLAVERYAS IT IS: Here and throughout this paragraph, Garrison offers a guarantee of theauthenticity of Douglass’s report on slavery in terms that were typical of whiteabolitionists’ prefaces to slave narratives. The phrase “slavery as it is” mayrefer to Theodore Weld’s American Slavery As It Is: Testimony of a ThousandWitnesses (New York: The American Anti-Slavery Society, 1839), a best-sellingcompilation of reports in southern newspapers of brutalities suffered by slaves.11 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_008.html#filepos99296] (p. 11) “NOCOMPROMISE WITH SLAVERY NO!

The question of his correct birth date and age plagued Douglassthrough his life.14 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_010.html#filepos109111] (p. 17) Myfather was a white man: Circumstantial and inconclusive evidence suggests thatDouglass’s father was either Aaron Anthony, manager of the plantation Douglasswas born on, or Thomas Auld, Anthony’s son-in-law.15 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_010.html#filepos113621] (p. 19) itwill do away the force of the argument, that God cursed Ham: Noah’s punishmentof his son Ham (which was to pronounce Ham’s son Canaan a slave to his brothers;see the Bible, Genesis 9:20-27) has been used to justify racism and prejudiceagainst peoples of African descent, as some of Ham’s descendants, notably Cush,are black.16 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_010.html#filepos116842] (p. 20)Colonel Lloyd: Edward Lloyd V (1779-1834) was a governor of Maryland, a U.S.senator, and a slaveholder.17 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_011.html#filepos121426] (p. 23) If aslave was convicted of any high misdemeanor, ... he was... sold to AustinWoolfolk, or some other slave-trader: Before Douglass had reached the age offourteen, one of his sisters, two aunts, seven cousins, and at least five otherrelatives, as well as other slaves he knew well, were sold farther south, manyof them by the notorious Baltimore slave trader Austin Woolfolk.18 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_011.html#filepos125113] (p. 24) Mr.Severe was rightly named: Throughout his Narrative, Douglass is careful to givethe actual names of all the individuals he mentions; he is just as careful toemphasize the irony of a name like this one (and Mr. Gore, Mr. Freeland, andothers). In this case, Douglass has the local pronunciation (and thus its irony)correct, but the actual spelling was ”Sevier“; an overseer on Lloyd’splantation, William Sevier had control over 165 slaves.19 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_012.html#filepos133851] (p. 28) Thecolonel also kept a splendid riding equipage. His stable and carriage-housepresented the appearance of some of our large city livery establishments.... Hiscarriage-house contained... three or four gigs, besides dearborns and baroucbesof the most fasbion able style: Douglass is comparing the colonel’s ridingequipage—his carriages and horses—to the city’s large commercial stables, knownas livery establishments. Gigs are light, two-wheeled carriages drawn by onehorse; dearborns are light, four-wheeled carriages with curtained sides; andbarouches are four-wheeled carriages with a covered passenger area that hasfacing double seats.20 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_012.html#filepos134311] (p. 29)enjoyed the luxury of whipping the servants when they pleased: Here andelsewhere Douglass’s sarcasm is very sharp concerning the sadistic nature ofslavery’s systems of control.21 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_014.html#filepos151965] (p. 36) Myfeet have been so cracked with the frost, that the pen with which I am writingmight be laid in the gashes: Douglass uses this powerful literary device—inwhich the writer’s physical response or demonstration adds weight to a memory ofthe past—several times. See, for another example, the end of chapter II (p. 26),where he reports that as he was writing ”an expression of feeling has alreadyfound its way down my cheek.“22 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_014.html#filepos153315] (p. 37) Ispent most of all these three days in the creek, ... preparing myselffor mydeparture: Douglass’s attention to washing implies a ritual cleansing or baptismas he prepares for a new life in the celebrated city of Baltimore.23 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_015.html#filepos165852] (p. 41)Baltimore: Baltimore had one of the largest concentrations of free people ofcolor in the South; the free black community was nearly 30,000 strong.24 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_016.html#filepos169815] (p. 43)Slavery proved as injurious to her as it did to me: One of the themes inDouglass’s Narrative is that slavery was ruinous to all participants, black andwhite, slave and slaveholder.25 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_016.html#filepos173786] (p. 45) Justabout this time, I got hold of a book entitled ”The Columbian Orator“: CalebBingham edited The Columbian Orator: Containing a Variety of Original andSelected Pieces Together with Rules Calculated to Improve Youth and Others inthe Ornamental and Useful Art of Eloquence. First published in 1797, thisanthology contained speeches dating from classical antiquity through theAmerican Revolution and featured passage after passage about freedom, democracy,and courage—including the crucial ”Dialogue Between a Master and Slave.“ Inaddition, there was an extensive preface by Bingham on public speaking. Douglassbought a secondhand copy of the anthology for fifty cents at a bookstore onThames Street, Baltimore. In preparation for his role in the abolition movementand as a spokesman for justice and freedom, Douglass could hardly have purchaseda better guide and source book.26 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_016.html#filepos174827] (p. 45) one ofSheridan’s mighty speeches on and in behalf of Catholic emancipation: Douglassis referring here not to the speeches of Richard Brinsley Sheridan (1751-1816),the Irish political leader and dramatist, but to the ”Speech in the Irish Houseof Commons in Favour of the Bill for Emancipating the Roman Catholics, 1795,“ bythe Irish patriot Arthur O‘Connor.27 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_016.html#filepos177407] (p. 46) If aslave ... did any thing very wrong in the mind of a slaveholder, it was spokenof as the fruit of abolition: It is likely that thirteen-year-old Douglass firstread about ”abolitionists“ in the Baltimore American in August 1831, when NatTurner’s slave rebellion in Virginia was front-page news.28 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_017.html#filepos187887] (p. 51) shesaw her children, her grandchildren, and her great-grandchildren, divided, likeso many sheep: It turns out that Douglass was mistaken in his accusationsagainst Thomas Auld regarding his grandmother’s treatment. In fact, after BetseyBailey’s husband, Isaac, died Auld took her in and cared for her until her deathin 1849. In a letter published in the North Star on September 7, 1849, Douglassapologized to Auld for the misstatement; he did so again during his famousmeeting with Auld in June 1877, as Auld was dying.29 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_017.html#filepos192148] (p. 52) St.Michael’s: It was on this neck of land between the Miles and Broad Rivers thatmany of the clippers that established Baltimore as a major port city wereproduced.30 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_018.html#filepos197086] (p. 56) I havealso seen Mr. George Cookman at our house. We slaves loved Mr. Cookman: GeorgeCookman was a Methodist minister, twice chaplain to the House ofRepresentatives.31 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos217715] (pp. 63-64) Iwould pour out my soul’s complaint, in my rude way, with an apostrophe to themoving multitude of ships:—”You are loosed from your moorings, and are free; Iam fast in my chains, and am a slave!... There is a better day coming“-Thisapostrophe (a rhetorical address to a personified thing) echoes the biblicallament of Job when he speaks ”in the bitterness of [his] soul“ (see the Bible,Job 7:11, 10:1; King James Version); it ends with a line found in many Negrospirituals, ”There’s a better day a-coming.“ Perhaps the passage containssomething of the teenager’s voice as well.32 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos221403] (p. 67) Ifound Sandy an old adviser: Here ”old“ implies ancient wisdom won throughlong-cultivated experience and, perhaps, a connection with African traditions.The man’s name, Sandy, also may imply a connection between the natural and thespiritual realms.33 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos236569] (p. 71) Theholidays are part and parcel of the gross fraud, wrong, and inhumanity ofslavery.... So, when the holidays ended, we staggered up ... feeling, upon thewhole, rather glad to go ... back to the arms of slavery: This passage ondrunkenness during the holidays typifies the abolitionist-temperance rhetoric ofthe time. Note how elsewhere in this book the slaveholders’ extravagances ofinjustice are often enflamed by their drunkenness.34 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos257959] (p. 79) I wasnever more certain of any thing: Here again—as in the incident with the root(pp. 67-68)—Sandy’s extraordinary powers are displayed; and again Douglassshares with him an experience of such powers.35 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos261890] (p. 81) ”Youyellow devil.... you long-legged mulatto devil!“: The theme of miscegenation(mixing of races) runs throughout the Narrative. Douglass knows his father is awhite man; he observes that the white masters’ illicit slave children—a reproachto the white men’s wives—are sometimes singled out for special mistreatment (p.19); here Douglass himself is vilified in terms that recall racist typologiesconcerning the peculiarly dangerous character of people of mixed race.36 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos263220] (p. 81) ”Ownnothing!“: Note that this advice follows several other examples of Douglass’slesson that silence is often the best defense: ”A still tongue makes a wisehead“ (p. 30).37 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_019.html#filepos270462] (p. 85) tostrike a white man is death by Lynch law: The phrase ”lynch law“ refers to thepunishment, usually by execution, of an accused person without legal procedureor authority. Lynch law was part of the slave codes (see note 4, above).38 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos280784] (p. 88)underground railroad: This term describes the abolition movement’s practice ofassisting fugitive slaves in their escape from the South to the free North andWest.39 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos294854] (p. 94) I wasrelieved... by the humane hand ofMR. DAVID RUGGLES : An African American bornfree in Connecticut, David Ruggles (1810-1849) founded the New York VigilanceCommittee, an organization that helped fugitive slaves escape slavery. He aidedDouglass in his escape from Maryland, and permitted Douglass to stay in his homeon his way to New Bedford in 1838.40 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos294854] (p. 94) Mr.Ruggles was then very deeply engaged in the memorable Darg case: On September 6,1839, Ruggles was arrested for harboring Thomas Hughes, a fugitive slave fromArkansas who was pursued by his owner John P Darg.41 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos295952] (p. 94) Anna,my intended wife: Douglass met Anna Murray (1813-1882), a free black and anabolitionist, in Baltimore. She sold one of her two featherbeds to help Douglasspay for his escape, and later joined him in New York. She and Douglass weremarried for forty-four years and raised five children.42 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos297252] (p. 95) J W.C. Pennington”: After escaping from slavery in Maryland around 1831, Pennington(1807-1870) went on to teach, write, and speak against slavery, and to pastorCongregational and Presbyterian churches. He wrote The Fugitive Blacksmith; or,Events in the history of James W C. Pennington, pastor of a Presbyterian church,New York, formerly a slave in the State of Maryland (London, 1850).43 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos299008] (p. 96) Mr.Johnson had just been reading the “Lady of the Lake,” and at once suggested thatmy name be “Douglass”: The name “Douglas,” to which Douglass added an s, is fromSir Walter Scott’s 1810 poem Lady of the Lake, a historical romance set in theScottish Highlands. Scott’s Lord James of Douglas is a wrongfully exiledScottish chieftain, revered for his goodness and bravery. This whole paragraph,which deals with names and naming, is quite significant in a context in whichslaves in America could not be sure of their ancestry, or sometimes even—as inthe case of Douglass—of their father’s identity. From the slave narrativesthrough The Autobiography of Malcolm X (1965), this problem of names hasreflected larger problems of identity and familial linkage: the sometimesheroic, sometimes blundering and comic, quest for home and family in a worldwhere one’s name is invented, one’s identity an improvisation.44 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_020.html#filepos300493] (p. 96) I wasquite disappointed at the general appearance of things in New Bedford: By“disappointed,” Douglass means “unsettled” or “surprised”; the reality of lifein New Bedford was much more orderly and prosperous than the southern planterswould have had Douglass believe to be the case in the free North.45 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_021.html#filepos309838] (p. 100) Neverwas there a clearer case of “stealing the livery of the court ofheaven to servethe devil in”: Douglass is recalling lines from The Course of Time, by Scottishpoet Robert Pollok (1799-1827): “He was a man / Who stole the livery of thecourt of Heaven / To serve the Devil in” (book 8, lines 616-618).46 [Narrative_of_the_Life_of_Freder_split_021.html#filepos314480] (p. 102)Pilate and Herod friends!: Pontius Pilate was the Roman procurator of Judea(26-c.36 A.D.) who tried and condemned Jesus. Herod I (known as Herod the Great)was the Roman-appointed king of Judea (37-4 B.C.) when Jesus was bom; in theBible, Herod is responsible for the extermination of infants of Bethlehem(Matthew 2:16-18)."},{"pageContent":"INSPIRED BY NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS, AN AMERICAN SLAVE[images/00018.jpg]> America has the mournful honor of adding a new department to the literature of> civilization,—the autobiographies of escaped slaves.—Ephraim PeabodySlave NarrativesThe autobiographical slave narrative is a specific literary genre that includesworks from as long ago as the early 1700s. A Narrative of the UncommonSufferings and Surprizing Deliverance of Briton Hammon, a Negro Man (1760) isgenerally considered the first slave narrative, although Adam Negro’s Tryallappeared in 1703. The age of Robinson Crusoe-type adventure tales includedseveral chronicles of slavery, among them A Narrative of the Lord’s WonderfulDealings with, j. Mur- rant, a Black, Taken Down from His Own Relation (1784)and The Interesting Narrative of Olaudab Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, the African(1789). The History of Mary Prince:A West Indian Slave, the first slavenarrative written by a woman, was published in 1831.But slave narratives did not gel as a literary form until 1845, when FrederickDouglass published his story. His articulate descriptions of the abusesperpetrated by his masters revealed horrors of slavery that previously wereunimaginable to most Americans and spurred a nation-wide public outrage againstslavery.Douglass’s narrative was followed by more slaves’ stories, including Incidentsin the Life of a Slave Girl (1861), published under the pseudonym Linda Brent;the author was actually Harriet Jacobs, an escaped slave who worked for a timewith Douglass’s circle of abolitionists in Rochester, New York. Harriet Tubmanled so many slaves to freedom as a “conductor” of the Underground Railroad thatshe earned the nickname “Moses.” Unable to read or write, Tubman dictated her1869 narrative, Scenes in the Life of Harriet Tubman.Slave narratives not only gave voice to many African Americans, who werepreviously excluded from the literary life of the nation; they also left theirmark on modem literature. For example, describing her aim in writing the novelBeloved (1987), Toni Morrison said she wished “to fill in the blanks that theslave narratives left, to part the veil that was so frequently drawn.” Beloved,which includes descriptions of the Middle Passage (the delivery of Africans onships to the Americas) and the Underground Railroad, earned Morrison a PulitzerPrize in 1988.VisualArtOne of the most highly regarded artists of the twentieth century, Jacob Lawrence(1917-2000) produced a huge body of work. After attending Frederick DouglassJunior High School in New York City, Lawrence began forging his identity as amodern artist and became associated with the Harlem Renaissance in its laterstages. Later, almost echoing Douglass’s ideas, Lawrence said, “My belief isthat it is most important for an artist to develop an approach and philosophyabout life—if he has developed this philosophy, he does not put paint on canvas,he puts himself on canvas.” When he was twenty-two, Lawrence painted a series ofthirty-two panels titled The Life of Frederick Douglass. Executed in a simple,allegorical style and striking, vibrant colors, the panels depict many of theevents Douglass describes in his Narrative—learning to read, resisting theslave-breaker Mr. Covey, planning his escape, listening to William LloydGarrison lecture in the North, and receiving government appointments.Children’s LiteratureA civil-rights activist, distinguished actor, accomplished director, andpublished author, Ossie Davis personifies the achievement Frederick Douglasssought for African Americans. Davis wrote and directed Escape to Freedom: TheStory of Young Frederick Douglass (1978), a chronicle of Douglass’s early lifethrough his escape to the North. The play educates children on Douglass’s manyaccomplishments, including his books, speeches, and political appointments.Davis has been honored with the NAACP Image Award, the National Medal of Arts,the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award, and the New York Urban LeagueFrederick Douglass Award.StatuaryFrederick Douglass was the first African American to whom a public sculpture wasdedicated. The bronze statue was dedicated on June 9,1899, in Rochester, NewYork, with Theodore Roosevelt, governor of New York, in attendance. The cast ofDouglass stands with arms held forward, palms up, as if welcoming visitors. Thestatue is the work of James W. Thomas, an African-American artist fromRochester. Originally erected near the train station, the statue enjoyed aprominent position in the city; in 1941 it was moved to Highland Park, near thesite of Douglass’s Rochester home."},{"pageContent":"COMMENTS & QUESTIONS[images/00019.jpg]In this section, we aim to provide the reader with an array of perspectives onthe text, as well as questions that challenge those perspectives.

All who know the wonderful gifts offriend Douglass know that his narrative must, in the nature of things, bewritten with great power. It is so indeed. It is the most thrilling work whichthe American press ever issued—and the most important. If it does not open theeyes of this people, they must be petrified into eternal sleep.The picture it presents of slavery is too horrible to look upon, and yet it isbut a faint picture of what to millions is a vivid life. It is evidently drawnwith a nice eye, and the coloring is chaste and subdued, rather than extravagantor overwrought. Thrilling as it is, and full of the most burning eloquence, itis yet simple and touching as the impulses of childhood. There are passages init which would brighten the reputation of any living author,—while the book, asa whole, judged as a mere work of art would widen the fame of Bunyan or De Foe.A spirit of the loftiest integrity, and a vein of the purest religioussentiment, runs through its pages, and it must leave on every mind a deepconviction of the author’s strength of mind and purity of heart. I predict forit a sale of at least twenty thousand in this country, and equally great inEurope. It will leave a mark upon this age which the busy finger of time willdeepen at every touch. It will generate a public sentiment in this nation, inthe presence of which our pro-slavery laws and constitutions shall be like chaffin the presence of fire. It contains the spark which will kindle up thesmoldering embers of freedom in a million souls, and light up our wholecontinent with the flames of liberty. Great efforts will be made in the name ofthe Constitution and the Bible, of James Polk and the Apostle Paul, to suppressit; but it will run through this nation from house to house, and from heart toheart, as the wild fire, finding wings in every wind which blows, flies acrossthe tall and boundless prairies. Its stirring incidents will fasten themselveson the eager minds of the youth of this country with hooks of steel. Thepolitics of the land will stand abashed before it, while her more corruptreligion will wish to sink back into the hot womb which gave it birth. It willfall in among the churches and state-houses of the land like a bomb-shell.—from The Liberator (May 30, 1845)MARGARET FULLERFrederick Douglass has been for some time a prominent member of the Abolitionparty. He is said to be an excellent speaker—can speak from a thorough personalexperience—and has upon the audience, beside, the influence of a strongcharacter and uncommon talents. In the book before us he has put into the storyof his life the thoughts, the feelings, and the adventures that have been soaffecting through the living voice; nor are they less so from the printed page.He has had the courage to name the persons, times and places, thus exposinghimself to obvious danger, and setting the seal on his deep convictions as tothe religious need of speaking the whole truth. Considered merely as anarrative, we have never read one more simple, true, coherent, and warm withgenuine feeling. It is an excellent piece of writing, and on that score to beprized as a specimen of the powers of the Black Race, which Prejudice persistsin disputing. We prize highly all evidence of this kind, and it is becoming moreabundant....The book is prefaced by two communications—one from Garrison and one fromWendell Phillips. That from the former is in his usual over-emphatic style. Hismotives and his course have been noble and generous. We look upon him with highrespect, but he has indulged in violent invective and denunciation till he hasspoiled the temper of his mind. Like a man who has been in the habit ofscreaming himself hoarse to make the deaf better, he can no longer pitch hisvoice on a key agreeable to common ears. Mr. Phillips’s remarks are equallydecided, without the exaggeration in the tone. Douglass himself seems very justand temperate. We feel that his view, even of those who have injured him most,may be relied upon. He knows how to allow for motives and influences. Upon thesubject of Religion, he speaks with great force, and not more than our ownsympathies can respond to. The inconsistencies of Slaveholding professors ofreligion cry to Heaven. We are not disposed to detest, or refuse communion withthem. Their blindness is but one form of that prevalent fallacy whichsubstitutes a creed for a faith, a ritual for a life. We have seen too much ofthis system of atonement not to know that those who adopt it often began withgood intentions, and are, at any rate, in their mistakes worthy of deepest pity.But that is no reason why the truth should not be uttered, trumpet-tongued,about the thing. “Bring no more vain oblations”: sermons must daily be preachedanew on that text. Kings, five hundred years ago, built Churches with the spoilsof war; Clergymen today command Slaves to obey a Gospel which they will notallow them to read, and call themselves Christians amid the curses of theirfellow men. The world ought to get on a little faster than that, if there bereally any principle of movement in it. The Kingdom of Heaven may not at thebeginning have dropped seed larger than a mustard seed, but even from that wehad a right to expect a fuller growth than can be believed to exist, when weread such a book as this of Douglass....We wish that every one may read his book and see what a mind might have beenstifled in bondage—what a man may be subjected to the insults of spendthriftdandies, or the blows of mercenary brutes, in whom there is no whiteness exceptof the skin, no humanity except in the outward form, and of whom the Avengerwill not fail yet to demand—“Where is thy brother?”—from the New York Tribune ( June 10, 1845)NATIONAL ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARDWe had a book put into our hands the other day, purporting to be theautobiography of a slave, who had escaped from bondage, by the name of FrederickDouglass, and we frankly acknowledge, that had it not been for our confidence inthe good judgment of the friend from whom the book came, who we knew had littlesympathy with the class of technical Abolitionists, we might possibly have laidit aside, without reading it, from perceiving that it was published under thepatronage of several individuals, whose course on the subject of Slavery we havenever regarded as either politic or right.On looking into the book, however, we have found it to contain one of the mostremarkable and thrilling narratives that have ever fallen under our eye; andthough there are some things in it which we regret, particularly the strongexpressions against professing Christians at the South, yet we see nothing tocast even a shade of doubt over the authenticity of the narrative, even inrespect to its minutest details. We should indeed, have made a single exceptionto this remark—that is, we should have doubted the practicability of such a bookbeing produced by a poor runaway slave, had it not been that we are assured thathis efforts as a public speaker are quite equal to what he has here shownhimself to be as a writer; and we have it upon good authority, that his lecturesare characterized by as able reasoning, as genuine wit, and as bold and stirringappeals, as we almost ever find in connection with the highest intellectualculture.Unless we greatly mistake, this small work to which we are referring is destinedto exert a mighty influence in favor of the great cause of Emancipation. Weacknowledge for ourselves, that we might have heard the system of Slaveryreasoned against abstractly, no matter how ably, and no matter how long, and yetwe could not have been so deep impressed with it as an outrage against humanity,as we have been by reading this simple story. It is especially fitted to correcta too prevalent error that Slavery in itself is not deserving of any severereprobation—that it is only the abuses of the system with which we have a rightto find fault.And we acknowledge ourselves to be among those who look for its removal at nodistant day. It seems to us as clear as the shining of the sun, that there aresigns of the times which betoken a speedy and mighty revolution on this subject.The march of public opinion is evidently in favor of emancipation; andopposition can no more arrest it than it can arrest the motion of the planets.There is a spirit awake throughout all the North, that cries out for universalFreedom, and all the agitation and opposition that we witness at the South isbut the heaving of the same spirit under different circumstances. It tells of aterrible conflict between selfishness and conscience, which will certainlyterminate at last in favor of the better principle.What particular mode of abolishing Slavery from our land, Providence mayordain—whether it shall be by bringing the South to bow to the high dictates ofconscience and of duty, or by suffering the slaves themselves to becomeministers of vengeance toward their oppressors, or by some other means, of whichwe know nothing—we pretend not to say; but the event of ultimate emancipation,in some way, we consider as absolutely certain; and while we would have alllabor to bring it about, we would have all take counsel of the spirit ofprudence, as well as philanthropy, in respect to the channel in which theirlabors shall be directed.—August 7, 1845EPHPAIM PEABODYThe narrative of Douglass contains the life of a superior man. Since his escapefrom slavery, he has been employed as an antislavery lecturer, and is now theeditor of a newspaper in Rochester, N.Y. He does not belong to the class, alwayssmall, of those who bring to light great principles, or who originate newmethods of carrying them out. He has, however, the vividness of sensibility andof thought which we are accustomed to associate with a Southern climate. He hasa natural and ready eloquence, a delicacy of taste, a quick perception ofproperties, a quick apprehension of ideas, and a felicity of expression, whichare possessed by few among the more cultivated, and which are surprising when weconsider that it is but a few years since he was a slave. In any popularassembly met for the discussion of subjects with which he has had theopportunity to become familiar, he is a man to command and hold attention. He isa natural orator, and his original endowments and the peculiarity of hisposition have given him a high place among antislavery speakers.But while our sympathies go strongly with him, and because they go with him, weare disposed to make a criticism on a mode of address in which he sometimesindulges himself, which we believe is likely to diminish, not only hisusefulness, but his real influence. We would not detract from his merits, and wecan easily excuse in him a severity of judgment and a one-sidedness of viewwhich might be inexcusable in another. We can hardly condemn one who has been aslave for seeing only the evils of slavery, and for thinking lightly of thedifficulty of remedying them; but we have wished, when we have heard him speak,or read what he has written, that he might wholly avoid a fault from which anatural magnanimity does something towards saving him, but to which he isnevertheless exposed. His associates at the North have been among those who areapt to mistake violence and extravagance of expression and denunciation foreloquence; —men who, whatever their virtues otherwise, are not in the habit ofusing discrimination to their judgments of men or of measures which they do notapprove. To him they have doubtless been true and faithful friends, and henaturally adopts their style of speech. But it is a mistaken one, if the speakerwishes to sway the judgment of his hearers and to accomplish any practical end.No matter what the vehemence of tone or expression, whenever a public speakerindulges himself in violent and unqualified statements and in sweepingdenunciations, he not only makes it apparent that he is deficient in a sound andfair judgment, but what is worse, he creates in his hearers a secret distrust ofhis real earnestness,—a vague feeling that after all he is thinking more of hisspeech than of the end for which he professes to make it. When men areprofoundly in earnest, they are not apt to be extravagant. The more earnest, themore rigidly true. A merchant, in discussing the politics of the day, aboutwhich he knows or cares little, freely indulges in loose, extravagant, andviolent declarations. But follow him to his counting-room; let him be makinginquiries or giving directions about some enterprise which he really has deeplyat heart, and the extravagance is gone. Nothing will answer here but truth, andthe exact truth. His earnestness makes him calm. It is seen in the moderatedaccuracy, as well as in the decision and strength, of his statements.Extravagance and passion and rhetorical flourishes might do when nothing whichhe greatly valued was at stake; but here is something too serious for trifling.Just so it is in other cases. A flippant, extravagant speaker, especially if hebe gifted with the power of sarcasm, will probably be listened to and applauded,but nothing comes of it. They who applaud the most understand very well thatthis is not the kind of person whose judgment is to be relied on as a guide inaction. His words are listened to with much the same sort of interest that isgiven to the personated passion of the theatre. A few sober words from a calm,wise, discriminating mind are, after all, the ones which are followed. Nothingis less effective, for any practical end, than the “withering and scorching”eloquence with which American speeches seem so to abound. It conciliates noopponent, and though it may light up the momentary passions, it gives no newstrength of conviction to the friends of a cause. It is the last kind ofeloquence to be cultivated by those who are heartily in earnest in their desireto promote any great reform.—from the Christian Examiner ( July 1849)BENJAMIN BRAWLEYAt the time of his death in 1895 Douglass had won for himself a place of uniquedistinction. Large of heart and of mind, he was interested in every forwardmovement for his people; but his charity embraced all men and all races. Hisreputation was international, and to-day many of his speeches are to be found inthe standard works on oratory ...> In an address on the 7th of December, 1890, [Frederick Douglass] said:> “I have seen dark hours in my life, and I have seen the darkness gradually> disappearing, and the light gradually increasing. One by one I have seen> obstacles removed, errors corrected, prejudices softened, proscriptions> relinquished, and my people advancing in all the elements that make up the sum> of general welfare. I remember that God reigns in eternity, and that, whatever> delays, disappointments, and discouragements may come, truth, justice,> liberty, and humanity will prevail.”> —from The Negro in Literature and Art (1921)Questions> 1. Margaret Fuller distinguishes between overemphatic and temperate—or what> may be termed preachy and reasoned—styles of address. Fuller finds Douglass to> be of the temperate category.
