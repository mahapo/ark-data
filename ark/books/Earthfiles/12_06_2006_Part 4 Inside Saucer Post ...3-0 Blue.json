This photo was borrowed from me, after my lecture to Ground Observer Corps in September 1955, by a Cincinnati Post reporter. Later I learned that the Post could not reproduce photo for publication because of 'too much graininess.' Photo sent to CRIFO by Jesse Leaf of Brooklyn, N. Y.\" BEHIND THE LOCAL MUZZLE During the local flap of 1955, I visited a saucer-sympathetic newspaperman in the editorial office of the Times Star . After discussing several recent developments, which did not merit review in his newspaper, he assured me that they weren't being cut because of any restrictions he knew of. But as the Enquirer had told me, he was sure that the \"public was tired of reading about lights in the sky.\" His reasoning was sound, I thought, and as I expressed my understanding, I turned to leave. Smilingly, he said, \"Now if anything big happens, let me know.\" On August 23, 1955, it happened! About midnight, residents throughout the city were jarred by the roar of jets. From SAC, Lockbourne AFB, south of Columbus, the Air National Guard jets were alerted, scrambled and were over Cincinnati in 12 minutes. The alert began when three UFOs were sighted and confirmed by radar somewhere between Columbus and Cincinnati. In the meantime, Walter Paner, Superintendent of Hamilton County GOC, on duty at the Mt. Healthy Post, phoned me about the existent alert and relayed the word that jet interceptors were due over the area. He said the UFOs had been active over Mt. Healthy, Ohio, and could be seen clearly by observers from the tower. In short time, the jets flying at approximately 20,000 feet were over Cincinnati, but poor visibility prevented me and a visiting friend from Toronto, Canada, from seeing the UFOs, which had deployed over a wide area. According to radar, the interlopers had extended 37 miles south, 24 miles north of the city, and as far as 10 miles east of Mt. Healthy. A later call from Paner disclosed that a UFO was seen hovering in pendulum-like motions directly over the tower. At about 12:10 a.m., the jet interceptors made contact, swooped in and chased the UFO, which disappeared at incredible speed. In the meantime, the Forestville and Loveland GOC Posts reported the erratic flights of UFOs to the Air Filter Center and described them as round, brilliant white spheres and discs. I remained on watch from Madison Place with binoculars until 2 a.m. But heavy clouds prevailed and obscured the activity. However, overhead the continuous din of low flying jets reminded me of action in the Pacific campaigns while waiting for the inevitable attack. Incongruously, the public was asleep or perhaps wondered about the noisy jets, but did not suspect the truth. The following morning, jet aircraft were still aloft over greater Cincinnati, but it was not until nightfall that a UFO again was spotted by GOC in Forestville. Herb Clark, Ralph Bardoff and Fred Pfeffer were on duty and described the object to the Filter Center as brilliant white and made no sound. Confirming reports of UFO activity came from GOC in Loveland and as far west as Vevay, Indiana. From a researcher's standpoint, the incident was extraordinary! Here, like the dawn of day, was evidence with radar confirmation of a solid body, or machine; evidence, according to GOC observers, of its control and maneuverability; evidence of the Air Force's policy to scramble and intercept the UFO; and evidence of our government's concern over the UFO pervading American skies. Equally extraordinary, I thought, was the fact that the entire incident was \"cleared\" for publication in Orbit. This, too, had come about uniquely. Having written up the report as I knew it had happened, I phoned Paner at his home and asked for his advice about publishing it. He said he was not sure, but would check with the authorities and suggested that I call back. Doing so minutes later, Paner told me it was perfectly acceptable as I had written it. Then to my surprise, he volunteered additional information regarding the radar tracking which included the distances traveled by the UFOs. For further confirmation of the UFOs' activity, I phoned the Control Tower of the Greater Cincinnati Airport in Boone County, Kentucky. They admitted, too, that unidentified blips were tracked on their radar screen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Stunned, my only rationalization wa that the Air Force had suddenly changed from their program of silence - or that I was being taken under their wing for special duty - or that somebody was talking out of turn. Indeed, before me was startling evidence and a startling story that Cincinnati and the world had awaited. But the Cincinnati newspapers were not interested! When I phoned the Enquirer, they shrugged it off. A Post reporter took notes, but the story never appeared in print. The Times Star , however, stumbling with promises to send a reporter out to get all the facts finally, after a conference between reporter and city editor, decided against it. Reeling from these rebuffs, I now felt sure the press was playing the Air Force game. Remembering my Lake Charles interview, I also took greater stock in my assumption that PIOs had long ago visited the local newspapers seeking their pledge of cooperation. Looking back, I recalled that similar security measures had been affected with the press during World War II, especially in regards to matters concerning the Manhattan Project. While I could understand the necessity for these wartime measures, I could find only cause to wonder about a peacetime blackout on the UFO. Was the news bad? Were UFOs belligerent? Was the jet intercept incident of August 23, one example of a global defensive action? Perhaps the evidence within the record of local events could supply the answer. Mrs. Isabel Hagglund of Palo Alto, California, commented on a series of local events which I reviewed in Orbit: \"The silence of all conventional communication media on the subject of the UFO has a nightmare quality. Three days after reading CRIFO I look around and wonder if I live in the same world in which your newsletter was published? It must have been another Ohio in another United States on another planet where the orange globes and balls of light and small green men were seen, for neither the press nor radio mentioned it here.\" With little or no reprieve in UFO activity through September and October of 1955 I decided to headline, \"The Case for Interplanetary war\" in the November issue of Orbit. Research was shocked! While I was absorbing the complaints of those who preferred to think that saucerlings were peace-loving, another event in the \"spirit of cooperation\" was shaping. The Cincinnati Enquirer - reiterating its allegiance to the Air Force, I thought - summed it up as follows: \"Once again, and in the most unqualified terms, we have the word of the Air Force that the flying saucers seen by so many people in so many places were not there at all. Whatever all these people saw, they were not aircraft, missiles or spaceships from this or any other planet, according to Donald A. Quarles, Secretary of the Air Force ... Even if the story stopped there, we could expect a good many flying saucer enthusiasts to ignore the dictum of the Air Force and to go right on accumulating their sightings, their theories and their campaigns to persuade the public that these saucer-shaped space ships are real.\" Reading this, I almost chuckled. Had the editorial writer, I thought, forgotten his respect for his fellow newspapermen who had seen UFOs, which included no less than the Enquirer 's own managing editor; not to mention the managing editor of the Post and several other prominent columnists and reporters, representing each of the three Cincinnati newspapers? Instead of crowing, I decided to drop the matter. Besides, who was there to crow to, except to Orbit readers and most of them already knew that editors and saucers weren't mixing well. It was not until March 21, 1956, that saucers brought the Enquirer and CRIFO together again. It all began peaceably when a member of its staff called to inquire whether I had received \"saucer\" reports that evening. He related that his paper had received a number of calls and wondered if I could add to their story? I told him that I had received several calls, some reporting a bright luminous object hovering in the west, which was obviously Venus. However, others described objects, not Venus. One told of a low-flying object changing from red to white, making no sound. Another reported a steady green light darting away swiftly after hovering. Another described an object with swept-back wings. Still another report, received before the evening's rash of sightings, said a long, metallic cigar-shaped object flew lower over a highway near Harrison, Ohio. The object \"without windows or protruding parts\" buzzed an automobile, terrifying three male occupants."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The next morning on March 22, 1956, the Enquirer 's jaunty play-up of the incident touched off the usual controversy. Under glaring headlines, accompanied by four photographs, two showing amorphous blobs, two lights shaped like baseball bats, the Enquirer reported the sightings I contributed, in addition to the following: \"An unidentified object burned like a bright beacon for at least 45 minutes high in the western sky ... That's how long it was observed by an Enquirer reporter and photographer who took up stations at North Bend following telephone calls ... To the naked eye, the object appeared to be an extraordinarily intense bluish-white light, suspended at about a 30-degree angle above the horizon. However, through binoculars the object appeared to be a compact galaxy of lights, changing form as they revolved slowly. At one point, with binoculars set slightly out of focus, it assumed the appearance of a diamond brooch ringed with emeralds turning lazily on an eccentric axis. ...Residents of a large area in the down river section reported that it was the third consecutive night 'the thing' has appeared.\" On March 23, the Enquirer had the mystery object simply explained! Under a headline which read, \" It's only a star, folks! 'Thing\" is Identified from Plane Window.\" The newspaper told of a F-84 Thunderjet that swooped the night before overhead at 30,0000 feet, unseen, but in radio contact with a C-45 piloted by Brig. General Edsel Clark, Ohio Air National Guard Adjutant General. Joining the General in this reconnaissance was Alan Kain, who photographed the object on the night of March 21, for the Enquirer. Kain, who knew what to look for, was the first to sight the object. Then, according to the Enquirer , the General spoke into the microphone to the jet pilot, received an answer and turned to Kain smiling, \"Pretty star, isn't it?\" The case was closed. The saucer was Venus! However, in the days following, I had continued to collect sighting reports, most of which reverted back to the night of March 21, 1956. In all, I had seventeen covering a three day period. Eleven, according to my analysis, were explainable as Venus - six were not! Armed with this composite report, I called on the Enquirer 's city editor, George Carr, hoping to impress him with the six sightings which could not be explained as Venus. Carr, however, refused to review my analysis and told me he considered the case closed! In spite of this, on March 26, the Enquirer reopened the case, featuring a story in which Dr. Paul Herget, Director of Cincinnati Observatory of the University of Cincinnati, was quoted as follows: \"The planet Venus will keep getting brighter until the middle of May. Every fool who goes out and looks at it for the first time will see a flying saucer.\" Herget was asked to explain why the UFO object appeared like emeralds and changed shapes. He commented, \"A completely spurious image - your observation must have been made under poor conditions. And I don't want to explain your poor binoculars.\" Herget's voice was final as far as the Enquirer was concerned, but to me the most significant event of the evening of March 21 - and which I am revealing for the first time - took place after Venus had set into the horizon. Charles Deininger of the Mt. Healthy GOC Post in the city's northwest had just hung up the phone after reporting mysterious lights seen in his area. Running outdoors to check the eastern skies, I immediately spotted two large, low-flying lights, similar to those on a plane's wing-tips. One glowed green and one yellow, both speeding north. Between the lights was a dark mass, the body. But it was the soft eerie glow of the lights and their distance apart in relation to their nearness to the ground that impressed me the most. Watching the object skimming over a nearby hill into the horizon, I knew that it was not an aircraft. For it to be that large and low, its engines would have been easily heard. But at no time was there any sound. Running back indoors, I flashed a call to the Air Filter Center in Columbus. While giving a quick descriptive run-down on the object to the sergeant on duty, I was suddenly interrupted and told to stand by. After moments of silence, the sergeant returned"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"and asked me to repeat the object's course. \"We're trying an experiment,\" he said. \"Now describe the object again as loud as you can.\" While repeating it for the third time, the sergeant again cut in and told me to stand by. This time I could hear him calling a code name (purposely omitted because of possible security infringement). Then his voice, in a one-sided conversation, asked someone if my descriptions were clear. After another lull and without further comment about the experiment, the sergeant then began filling out a \"column 9\" report. For reference, I quote from S.O.P. No. 13, May 17, 1955, Page 2, Paragraph 5, entitled \"Operations - Types of Aircraft to Report\" as follows: \"In case of unknown flying objects or aircraft in distress or any unusual occurrences, a column 9 report should be made. Give a description of the unknown object, its size, shape and speed; or if an aircraft is in distress give complete details. Air Force personnel on duty will ask additional questions pertaining to the object or aircraft in distress or occurrence and additional information you can give will be helpful.\" In the meantime, hearing a jet's hum over my area strengthened my first suspicions of being in direct communication with a jet pilot. Maybe the one aloft! To me, this meant radar had confirmed the object and that some of the people seeing a light in the sky over Cincinnati were seeing something besides Venus!\" C ontinued in Part 5 - Media's Biased Editing of UFO Incidents More Information: For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprints below from the Earthfiles Archives: Status Reports I • 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash • 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody Status Reports II • 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data Status Reports III • 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 by Leonard H.
