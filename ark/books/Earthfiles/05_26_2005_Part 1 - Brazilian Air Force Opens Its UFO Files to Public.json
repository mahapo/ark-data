There it was announced that current Brazil President, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva known to the Brazil public as \"President Lula\" - supports opening most government suppressed files including UFO cases, political prisoner files and other secrets kept by previous Brazil administrations. One of the UFO researchers invited to the May 20th Brazilian Air Force meeting was farmer, Urandir Oliveira, from Corguinho in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul.

Mr. Oliveira operates a farm with his wife, children, parents and cousins where many strange aerial objects and lights have been seen for decades by the Corguinho residents. Over the past seven years, Mr. Oliveira has also described his own encounters with craft and tall blond extraterrestrials for Globo TV and other Brazilian media, which is why he was invited to the Brasilia meeting last Friday.

This week I talked with Urandir Oliveira in Corguino. The Portuguese-to-English translation was provided by Brazilian businessman, Felipe Branco. Mr. Branco is an executive in his family's company, Castelo Branco Ltd. - a ranching and holding company with offices in Rio de Janeiro, Campo Grande and Italy. Mr. Branco has taken a deep interest in researching UFOs and close encounters with what seem to be non-human beings since his own first experience with a tall, red-haired, green-eyed female in 1968. He was 5-years-old then, living in Campo Grande. He and his family have a ranch there which is about 60 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of Corguinho. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sao Paulo, Brazil, has a population around 18 million. Campo Grande, in the state of Mato Grosso Do Sul, has a population of about 850,000. Rochedo (\"Little Rock),\" the nearest town to Corguinho and Urandir Oliveira's farm, has a population of a few hundred people and is nearly two hours on rough, dirt roads from Campo Grande. In 1996, Felipe and his brother began traveling to Corguinho after they heard about the alleged UFO abductions of farmer Urandir Oliveira. Since then, Mr. Branco and his family have researched phenomena in the remote valley where he and many others have seen unidentified aerial craft and various types of non-human entities, and where recently he had an encounter with what he calls a \"plasma ball\" which entered his body. More about that later in this report. But first, the news from Brasilia. I asked Urandir Oliveira and Felipe Branco why the Brazilian Air Force now suddenly opened up UFO and other government files to the public? Interview: Urandir Oliveira, Farmer and UFO Abductee, Corguinho, Mato Grosso Do Sul, Brazil, Translated by Felipe Branco, Castelo Branco Ltd., Campo Grande, Mato Grosso Do Sul, Brazil : \"Urandir says there is a Congressman in 2004 who started putting pressure on the government. He said it is also policy from the Lulu government to open all its files not only UFOs, but also concerning the political prisoners in the early 1960s. All secret files, they want to open everything to the public like a general effort of disclosure of all secret documents concerning all different fields not only UFOs. Also political persecutions. SO WAS THIS INITIATED BY THE PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL? He is saying the Congressman last year started the pressure to specifically open Brazil's Air Force UFO files. Then he utilized the good will of Lulu's government to open all files and then the Air Force proceeded to open its files on UFOs, apparently. As far as I understood, it only initiated with this Congressman Joae Caldas, who represents the State of Sao Paulo and the Liberal Front Party. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT HAS COME OUT THAT IS SURPRISING TO ANYBODY? On Sunday, a couple of days ago, there is this TV program called Fantastico! and they showed this meeting in Brasilia with the Air Force headquarters. It was an interview with the Brazil Air Force Commander and a couple of Air Marshals. They were talking about UFO files and UFO reality and their research of UFOs, how they are not able to fully understand because of the technology involved is far beyond their comprehension. They were speaking openly for about 15 minutes on national television."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THAT WAS ON SUNDAY? A couple of days it was unbelievable, unbelievable! DID THEY SPECIFICALLY SHOW ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR FILM OF CRASHED DISCS OR BODIES OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT? They did not go into specifics. They only spoke in general terms. They showed a large amount of data and documents and studies and they spoke about Operation Prato. They spoke in general affirming that UFOs are a reality, they are studying it, they do have files and they are opening them up to the public. Whoever is interested can go there, show up and request and receive them. That's it. This was on national TV. WHAT WAS THE OPERATION CALLED? Operation Prato, means 'plate.' OPERATION PLATE LIKE MEANING AN AERIAL DISC? Ye s . DID THEY SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT TO THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT CONCERNING UFO INVESTIGATIONS? No, they did not say that. THAT REMAINS THE MYSTERY ABOUT WHO IS IN CONTROL OF INVESTIGATIONS IN BRAZIL? They said that they are willing to work also with various UFO research groups, to make a partnership in a joint study effort to study the phenomenon. BUT THEY DID NOT SHOW PHOTOGRAPHS OF CRAFT OR BODIES? No, they did not show anything specific. They just spoke in general terms. They did show the files, the place where they store the files they showed where they keep the documents. But they did not go into specifics. THAT WAS IN WHICH BUILDING IN BRASILIA? They have been to CINDACTA I which is like a NORAD, a Brazilian NORAD. IN THE UNITED STATES, IT'S INSIDE A MOUNTAIN IN COLORADO. IN BRAZIL, WHERE IS CINDACTA? Brasilia. IT'S IN THE CAPITOL OF BRAZIL? IS IT INSIDE A MOUNTAIN OR UNDERGROUND? No, it's a building. I sent you a picture of Urandir in front of Cindacta. WHEN URANDIR WENT TO THE MEETING, WAS HE IN BRASILIA AT THAT BUILDING? Ye s . DID THE BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT MAKE A STATEMENT IN WHICH THEY SAID THERE WOULD BE A CERTAIN DATE IN WHICH EVERYTHING, ALL OF THE FILES, WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE WHO WENT TO BRASILIA TO ASK? They are already open, effective from now. He said the only thing is there are certain secret files. You can go there, review them, look at them, copy them, but you cannot take the originals away from the building. No Major Newspaper Coverage of Brazil Air Force Meeting in Brasilia WHAT EXACTLY WERE THE HEADLINES IN THE BRASILIA AND RIO DE JANEIRO MEDIA WHAT DID THE HEADLINES IN THE NEWSPAPERS SAY?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So far nothing in the press media has come out about this, but there were journalists from Folha de Fao de Paulo , which is a major newspaper and another major newspaper from Sao Paulo. But so far nothing has come out in the press only on television. Fantastico! which is 67% of the country follows this program on Sunday nights. WHICH STATION IS THAT ON AND FROM WHICH CITY? Globo TV GLOBO TV, AND IS THAT BROADCAST OUT OF RIO DE JANEIRO OR BRASILIA? Rio de Janeiro. WHAT KIND OF SUBJECTS DO THEY COVER? Everything it's like news, football news, entertainment it's like an electronic magazine. 2.5 hour program. AND RIGHT NOW FA N TA S T I C O ! IS THE ONLY PROGRAM THAT YOU ARE AWARE THAT THIS OPEN DISCUSSION WITH AIR FORCE AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS TOOK PLACE ABOUT OPENING UFO FILES? Yes. That's the amazing thing. AND IT HAS NOT BEEN IN ANY OF THE NEWSPAPERS? None that I'm aware of. HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT? As if they are fishing the public they are testing the pulse of the public. That's what I think because Fantastico! is a major, major program in the Brazilian TV seen by millions of people. FELIPE, THAT'S MY POINT. IF A TELEVISION BROADCAST THAT REACHES MOST OF THE BRAZILIAN POPULATION HAS AN OPEN DISCUSSION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT OF BRAZIL OPENING UP ALL THESE FILES, WOULDN'T THAT BE HEADLINES IN ALL OF THE NEWSPAPERS? It should have been headlines first thing on Monday, not only in the Brazilian press but also in the 24-hour news we have a CNN, Globo News , it's a Brazilian news. It should be covered by Globo News and all other networks. It was a major I watched the program. It was amazing. But there was no follow up. THAT'S IT, WHY HAVEN'T THE MAJOR NEWSPAPERS FOLLOWED UP ON THE MAJOR TV SHOW? I cannot guess.\" Continued in Part 2 - Corguinho, Brazil: Plasma Balls Which Enter Humans More Information: See other Earthfiles reports about Corguinho, Brazil, events in the Earthfiles Archives : · 05/24/2004 -- Biophysicist W.
