P resident Bill Clinton: 'There's a government inside the government and I don't control it.' Return to Part 1 Interview: Grant Cameron, a building facility manager at the University of Manitoba; reporter and producer of www.presidentialufo.com, Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada: How Does U.S. Government Reverse Its Policy of Lies and Denials About ETs YOU CAN HEAR THAT DISCUSSION DECADE AFTER DECADE FROM TRUMAN AT LEAST UP TO THE CURRENT DAY. GRANT, WHAT HAS CHANGED - IF ANYTHING - THAT MIGHT OPEN UP THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH THIS PLANET FOR MILLENNIA? WHAT WOULD REVERSE THE LIES AND OPEN UP THAT TRUTH - LET'S SAY IN THE NEXT 20 YEARS? Good question. I don't know. Basically, I think you are talking the same things that have held it up. I can't really see unless they make a mistake. My idea is to get a high ranking leader who has been briefed and confirms the fact he was briefed, which leads you to a date, a briefing date, where you can get a document. The document will have the truth, not the misinformation they are putting out. It will have the actual truth of what is going on. Government is very short-sighted. It's very 'Let's do things for the next four years.' There is no long term thought inside of government because it is very vote-oriented. I always say they look at the shortest distance between two votes. GRANT, WHAT YOU ARE JUST SUMMARIZING INDIRECTLY IS THE FACT THAT IT WILL PROBABLY BE ANOTHER 60 YEARS BEFORE ANY OF THE REAL TRUTH WILL OPEN UP ON THIS PLANET. Yes, unless there is some sort of accident, a crash retrieval they can't control, or some aspect where somebody gets the idea that this is for real some media that is not controlled by the government. And I think a lot of them are controlled by the government. Somebody might break ranks and say we're going to put this story out, we're going to do it and it snowballs from there. It has to be something outside the ordinary because right now, it's status quo. Things are going along, no one is asking any questions, no one seems to be interested. It really doesn't get into the media. THAT'S THE HUMAN SIDE OF THE EQUATION. FOR A MOMENT, WHAT IS YOUR PRIVATE, PERSONAL OPINION ABOUT WHY ON THE NON-HUMAN SIDE OF THE EQUATION, THERE WOULD NOT BE SOME KIND OF BLATANT PRESENTATION THAT WOULD PULL THE RUG OUT FROM UNDER OUR GOVERNMENT AND ALL GOVERNMENTS OF THE PLANET? You hear about the concept of universal law that you can't interfere with someone else's evolution. They are sitting back and watching. You'll see a number of cases Bentwaters and Rendlesham Forest, for example. When we were in Las Vegas, this discussion about the fact that the alien presence there sent a beam down through all this concrete and metal "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and disarmed the nuclear weapons the Americans had in the United Kingdom that should not have been there. The aliens are basically sitting on the sidelines and will step in if there is a nuclear war. But otherwise, they are going to let us make the mistakes that we have. They are going to have gradual disclosure as well. They are sort of indicating indirectly to us through people who get discredited that there is an alien presence, and allowing people to gradually acclimatize themselves to the fact that they are there. They must realize the same thing about panic and all those issues. BUT, ISN'T THERE AN IMMEDIATE CONTRADICTION TO THAT PERSPECTIVE IN THE VERY EXISTENCE OF HUMAN ABDUCTIONS AND ANIMAL MUTILATIONS WHICH ARE PHYSICAL INTRUSIONS IN HUMANS AND ANIMALS? But it's still done in the background. It's not like the aliens take 500 cattle and fly into downtown New York City and drop them where everyone can see them. It's still done in the background. it's very indirect. You and I can link it. We put the pieces together, but it's not directly linked for the public. It's sort of done indirectly. It's like you are trying to prove that it's going on. I've always said that if they wanted to announce themselves, they could announce themselves. They could land in 5 or 6 cities all at the same time. They could control the whole thing and come out and say, 'Here we are.' And they don't. That's what scares the government. That's my impression of why the aliens don't: there is a law of non-interference. This is disagreed with in the animal mutilations and abductions which confuse me as well how does this fit in? It's like a little bit of interference with our evolution, but it's sort of passes like an exception to the rule. It confuses me. WHAT SHOULD ALSO BE ON OUR LIST IS THE COMPLEXITY OF AGENDAS AND THE FACT THAT IT SEEMS TO BE INCREASINGLY CLEAR THERE ARE MANY MORE THAN ONE INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET. ONCE YOU GET A CLEAR FOCUS ON MORE THAN ONE INTELLIGENCE, AND THAT THERE ARE MORE AGENDAS, THEN THE COMPLEXITY RATCHETS UP SO HIGH THAT FOR ANY OF US HUMANS, INCLUDING THE GOVERNMENT, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ANY ONE INTELLIGENCE AND ITS AGENDA MIGHT BE IS ALMOST NOT POSSIBLE FOR HUMANS THAT ARE LIVING ON THIS EARTH. 20) Alien agenda incomprehensible. Yes, and that's one of the big reasons the government does not fully understand the alien agenda that the aliens haven't made it public to the government. It might in the end be a take over. That cold be one of the scenarios, through abductees and through genetic manipulation, that they are going to interbreed and take over. That is always one of the scenarios. 21) Alien intelligences deceive. ONE GUY WHO WORKED FOR THE MILITARY AND INTEL TOLD ME BACK IN THE EARLY 1980S, 'LINDA, THE GREYS LIE TO US. WE KNOW THEY LIE.' THAT CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD BECAUSE I THINK THE NAIVE IMPRESSION MOST HUMANS HAVE IS THAT SOMETHING FROM SOME PLACE ELSE IN THE UNIVERSE THAT IS ADVANCED ENOUGH TO TRAVEL FROM FAR AWAY TO GET HERE WOULD SOME HOW BE MORE MENTALLY, SPIRITUALLY ADVANCED AND THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE MANIPULATION OR DECEPTION OR LIES. That's one thing about the aliens. They don't seem to be much more spiritually advanced than we are. OR AT LEAST SOME OF THEM. THEN YOU TALK TO SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER INTELLIGENCES THAT SEEM TO BE VERY ADVANCED AND MORE INTERESTED IN SPIRITUAL EVOLUTION THAN ANYTHING PHYSICAL. IT'S THIS COMPLEXITY, THIS CONFUSION, THAT REIGNS AS MUCH AT THE END OF 2004 AS WE HEAD INTO 2005 AS IT DID BACK IN 1947. 22) Government does not know what to do about ETs. Yes, and back in 1950, one of the reasons that ties in with this: Wilbert Smith ran the Canadian government's flying saucer investigation. He talked a number of times about why the government had covered it up and he said it was very simple: They (govt) did not know what to do. He said that when they realized the existence of the saucers and people from elsewhere, they didn't know what to do about it, couldn't control it, and they closed their eyes and hoped it would go away.' They simply did not know what to do. That is one of the things: they are throwing their hands up, it's out of their control and the best thing is not to let everybody know you can't control it. AND TO HOPE THAT IT GOES AWAY WHAT A NAIVE POSITION! ESPECIALLY 60 YEARS LATER, REALIZING THAT ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND HUMAN ABDUCTIONS AND A MYRIAD OTHER MORE COMPLEX PIECES OF EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHING INTERACTS WITH OUR PLANET AND IS STILL HERE, NOT GOING AWAY, AND WHEN IS THIS WORLD GOING TO BE TOLD THE TRUTH?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. And another reason for non-disclosure that I have is: 23) Nationalism. Especially when you consider that the U. S has a lot of the UFO technology and a lot of nationalism. If you go to a world view of aliens versus us, nationalism is out. But nationalism is a big thing in the USA. If you are the American government, it's hard to accept your government is not going to exist anymore. It's going to be a world government and you're just going to be a little puppet doing what you are being told by a world government. So, nationalism is something the USA does not want to give up. The Brookings Institution 1961 Report 24) Advanced intelligences absorb/defeat less advanced intelligences. The Brookings study on the implications of discovery of extraterrestrial life and intelligence talked about extinction. This is the idea that if you get an advanced civilization and a non-advanced civilization (which would be us), the one that is less advanced could become extinct. Editor's Note : Page 215 of Peaceful Space Activities for Human Affairs by The Brookings Institution, dated April 18, 1961 , states: \"... anthropological files contain many examples of societies sure of their place in the universe, which have disintegrated when they had to associate with previously unfamiliar societies espousing different ideas and different life ways. Others that survived such an experience usually did so by paying the price of changes in values and attitudes and behavior.\" April 18, 1961, report for NASA by The Brookings Institution. This is the idea of the Native Indian. When the white man came, that Indian society just fell apart. That's probably in the back ground of the briefings that this is a very likely scenario and would mean to the President, 'I['m just not going down this road.' This is something we'd have a hard time dealing with if it turns out to be true. GRANT, DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERE IS NO DISCLOSURE ABOUT OTHER LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE BECAUSE IT IS SO POLITICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OPEN UP? Yes, I think there are so many scenarios they are unsure of, or they know for a fact are going to cause trouble, that when you weigh the way the world is right now versus all the things that could go wrong! And a government wants to be in control. I always say"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"disclosure is like a snowball going down a hill. Once you disclose all you have to say is 'ETs are real.' The snowball starts going down the hill and you could get an avalanche. At that point, you can no longer control it and it's a situation where, for example, it green lights everything. If the President said, 'ETs are here, but I'm not going to talk about the rest of it.' That would automatically green light all the people that you've talked to, Linda; that I've talked to; all those inside the Intel community who say, 'OK, now it's open. The President has said this is for real.' They start talking and you can't control what they are going to say. It's something that once it's out of the bag, it's out! Now they can control it by indirectly leaking material with misinformation to indirectly tell us what is going on. But once you confirm it, then you have this massive rush of reporters and people who demand answers and it's something you totally lose control over; the government wants to be in control. If you take a look at President Reagan when he was shot, the National Security Adviser advised minutes after Reagan was shot that the more people think things are normal, the better off we are going to be. You want to keep people thinking that nothing has changed. If you change the scenario that's changed, this is changed the stock market is moving down, a hundred different things it gets out of control. IT'S LIKE Orwell's 1984 IN WHICH THE LIE HAS BECOME THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH HAS BECOME THE LIE. Ye s . HOW DO WE UPEND THAT AND HAVE THE TRUTH BE THE TRUTH? Exactly. One of the scary things I've looked at for one of the possible reasons is: 25) Counter-measures - Space-based weapons to fight ETs. The government might actually be stupid enough to say that it can develop weapons in order to handle the alien situation by wiping them out that we could actually win in a war against the aliens that the government is working on counter-measures to go after the aliens. If that is true - and I think it looks like they actually are working on that kind of stuff - this is total stupidity. Clinton was asked after the movie Independence Day in 1996, 'Mr. President, do you think we would win a war against the aliens?' And he said, 'Yes, I think the people would come together and we would win.' I hope he was joking when he said that, but that's a scary scenario that a lot of the secrecy is the fact that we are going to go to war against the aliens. BUT HOW COULD WE ASSUME SUCH A POINT OF VIEW WHEN THE NON-HUMANS CAN NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY? Exactly. We would have to make the assumption that they have a certain amount of technology to go to war and then find out that they have ten times that and they just wipe us off the map, which would be a scary scenario. And yet you look at the whole Star Wars \"anti-missile shield\" thing. It's being built and yet there is no country that can launch a missile against the United States and you sit there and ask: What are they (U.S. government) actually doing? Why are they spending billions and billions of dollars on this stuff that doesn't seem to work, but they are determined to get it up there and take a war into space? U. S. National Missile Defense System - \"Unknown Anomaly\" Causes Test Failure Thursday, December 16, 2004, Page A16 Headline, Albuquerque Journal, Albuquerque, New Mexico."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Editor's Note: The phrase, \"unknown anomaly\" is reminiscent of a similar phrase, \"peculiar phenomena\" used by Lt. Col. Harold R. Turner to describe what caused the May 1947 White Sands V-2 rocket tests to veer off course.

Cover-Up Policy Hides Constitutional Abuses and Murders \"In The Interest of National Security\" 26) Dark inner secrets. That is the fact that it might not be the cover-up as much as what they've done to cover it up. For example, let's assume in the past sixty years, they've had to kill 5,000 people to keep it all a secret. All these things behind the scenes that you don't know what is going on that they are trying to cover up and that might be the real reason for the cover-up what they did to keep it covered up. 27) Who is in charge? Former President Bill Clinton, according to Steven Greer, told Sarah McClendon - a longtime White House reporter: R eporter Sarah McClendon: 'Mr. President, why don't you do something about the ET cover-up?' P resident Bill Clinton: 'There's a government inside the government and I don't control it.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Maybe we're going after the government for disclosure and the government has no input whatsoever. Maybe there is a government inside the government. They are the government and cannot control it. THAT WOULD BE MJ-12 THAT WAS PUT IN MOTION BY PRES. HARRY S. TRUMAN AND THAT THERE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A HIGHLY CLASSIFIED ORDER BY TRUMAN THAT WOULD MAKE CERTAIN THERE WAS A POLICY OF DENIAL, THAT THERE WOULD BE A GOVERNMENT INSIDE THE GOVERNMENT, A SMALL GROUP THAT WOULD BE ASSIGNED TO MONITORING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE ET PRESENCE WITHOUT ANYONE IN THE PUBLIC AND MEDIA KNOWING. THAT POLICY SEEMS TO TRULY BE IN EFFECT IN 2004. Yes, and if Bill Clinton did know anything or figured out something during his administration, that would indicate that the whole story is true, confirmed by a president that the (elected) government is not running the show. And if they are running the show, that inner government can take over all sorts of aspects of the government and pretty soon you are running around trying to take democracy to the world and there is no democracy here! WHAT YOU MEAN HERE IS THAT THE ELECTED GOVERNMENT IS NOT THE ONE IN CONTROL OF THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL STORY AT ALL. IT IS THE NON-ELECTED SECRET GROUP THAT WE REFER TO AS MAJESTIC 12, OR MJ 12, WITH MAJIC AUTHORITY AND IT IS THAT GROUP THAT HAS BEEN PASSING THE BATON OF POWER FOR AT LEAST THE PAST 60 YEARS, TOTALLY SEPARATE FROM - AND WITH DISDAIN ABOUT - ELECTED OFFICIALS. Yes, and how do you disclose that this group has been running the government for the past 60 some years? Do you want to be the President that makes that announcement? I think you even said that you had talked to someone about that. YES, A MILITARY MAN TOLD ME, 'THERE IS NOT A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN IN MJ-12 AND IN CONTROL OF THE ET STORY WHO WANTS TO BE ALIVE WHEN THE TRUTH COMES OUT.' Exactly. It's a scary situation.\" More Information: For more information about MJ-12, the \"Secret Government\" in charge of ET research and cover-up, please see other Earthfiles reports: 'MJ-12': · 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 12/07/2004 -- Part 2: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 12/04/2004 -- Part 1: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 11/03/2004 -- Gen.
