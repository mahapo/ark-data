Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Unusual Animal Deaths, Part 1: Nevada © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe September 12, 1999 Battle Mountain, Nevada Recently I received an e-mail from Sergeant Investigator Klaus Altemueller with the Lander County Sheriff's office in Battle Mountain, Nevada. He wrote: \"We have been having cow mutilations here for at least the past ten or so years.\" I also received photographs of one of those mutilations that occurred on January 12, 1995 from Battle Mountain rancher, Eddyann Filippini. With the photos, she wrote: \"It was very wet that day, so it looks like there is blood on the ground. It was the snow and rain on the fresh cuts that pooled where she was laying.\" Mutilated cow discovered January 12, 1995 in Battle Mountain, Nevada. Photograph © 1999 by owner, Eddyann Filippini.

Photograph © 1999 by owner, Eddyann Filippini. The Lander County Sheriff's Offense Report said that it was an Angus Cross cow dead only about 24 hours. The several excisions included a neat 18-inch hide-deep circle of flesh removed \"with a very sharp instrument\" where the udder had been. Rectal and vaginal tissue had also been neatly excised. The left side of the jaw had been stripped of flesh and the tongue had been removed deep within the throat. No tracks or signs of struggle. I called and talked with Sergeant Investigator Altemueller about the most recent heifer calf found at the Filippini's Badger Ranch on June 14, 1999. The calf was last seen alive around 6:30 PM the evening before by the owners whose family have ranched in Battle Mountain since the 1940s. Sgt. Altemueller investigated and described what he found. Interviews: 1) Klaus Altemueller, Sergeant Investigator, Lander County Sheriff's Office, Battle Mountain, Nevada: \"This was a red heifer - just a calf not very old. When I arrived at the ranch, I had to go with the rancher and we went way out into the area. The injuries on this (calf) were: the tongue had been cut out, the anus was removed and the naval area was cut out. The naval area was cut in a perfect circle and as well the anus. There was a portion of the face removed of what was up. THE HEAD WAS LAYING UP AND THAT HALF OF THE HEAD, THE SKIN OR HIDE, WAS REMOVED? Actually it was just the lower portion of the jaw. And the tongue was removed. I couldn't tell how far back. We didn't do any further investigation on that. IN TERMS OF TRACHEA OF LARYNX? Yeah, I would have no idea. We don't have the abilities to conduct those type of examinations on animals. BUT THE TONGUE WAS DEFINITELY REMOVED DEEP WITHIN THE THROAT? I couldn't see any part of it. There were no tire tracks. There was no blood. There was no evidence of any type indicating any foot traffic or vehicular traffic. We have a type of soil around here. It's called the 'bug dust.' And what it is - it's real fine and powdery, really fine powdery dust. And when you drive over it, it leaves pretty distinct tracks. And there was nothing of that nature anywhere near this cow. COULD YOU FIND ANY TRACKS OF THE CALF ITSELF WHERE IT WAS LAYING? I didn't notice any. The wind had blown earlier in the morning, so it might have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"obscured any possible tracks or anything like that. But the unusual thing was that this was a 2-month-old calf, so it still would have been suckling and the mother cow as nowhere to be found. DID YOUR SHERIFF OFFICE ASK TO HAVE ANY KIND OF NECROPSY OR ANALYSES DONE? No, we don't even have anyone in the area that can do that. Because of the remoteness of the location and probably the state of decomposition would be so high, particularly in this time of the year - by the time we were even able to get someone out there - just the simple logistics of it. The rancher calls us. He's seventeen miles to his ranch and another five miles out into the pasture areas. That's probably close to a 45-minute to hour project and I have to locate the animal, come back to town. As far as I know, the nearest person who can do that (necropsy) is in Salt Lake City or Reno which is 300 miles in one direction and 220 miles in the other direction. THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FOCUS ON THESE RANCH PROPERTIES OF THE FILIPPINIS. There the only ones in the entire county and we have 5700 square miles. And those are the only ones that have been reported to us that I'm aware of. WHEN YOU TALK WITH OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATORS, WHAT IS THEIR COMMENT ABOUT THESE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS? They say things like, 'Strange. Weird. Odd. Wonder what that is? I've heard about those elsewhere.' But no one that I've talked to in the area as far as adjoining counties has experienced those, that I know of. AND IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH FELLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT PEOPLE AND YOUR SHERIFF, WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE SOURCE OF THIS COULD BE RANGING FROM GOVERNMENT POSSIBLY TO A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, WHAT IS THE DISCUSSION LIKE? Well, basically, the main gist is that we're not willing to rule anything out at this point because we don't have any answers. So, I don't have any personal theories. It's just really strange. And I don't have any clues. And I know it's been going on for awhile.\" SGT. ALTEMUELLER FOUND SEVEN ANIMAL MUTILATION OFFENSE REPORTS IN THE LANDER COUNTY SHERIFF'S FILES SINCE DECEMBER 28, 1994 - ALL ON THE SAME RANCHES EIGHTEEN MILES SOUTH OF BATTLE MOUNTAIN. THE OWNERS SPAN TWO GENERATIONS: HANK FILIPPINI, SR., AND HIS SON DAN. SGT. ALTEMUELLER ALSO KNOWS THE FORMER SHERIFF INVESTIGATED ANIMAL MUTILATIONS ON THE FILIPPINI RANCHES IN THE 1980S. DAN'S WIFE, EDDYANN FILIPPINI, TOLD ME THERE HAVE BEEN HORSE AND CATTLE MUTILATIONS THEY HAVE NOT EVEN BOTHERED TO REPORT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. SHE FIGURES THE COUNT NOW IS NEARLY A DOZEN AND SHE IS PARTICULARLY PUZZLED BY THE LACK OF BLOOD AND ODD REACTIONS OF NATURAL PREDATORS TO THE MUTILATED ANIMALS ON THEIR RANCHES. 2) Eddyann Filippini, wife of Dan Filippini, Owners of Badger and Chiari Ranches, Battle Mountain, Nevada: \"There's no blood and no signs of struggle. No tracks. The predators, coyotes or birds, won't even eat them. The birds will land on them and poop on them, but they won't eat them. And it will take probably months before - say, like the crows. The coyotes never do. They won't touch them. IN TERMS OF A NECROPSY, DID YOU CALL ANY VETERINARIAN TO COME OUT ON THAT ONE? No, we haven't called any vets. We just called the sheriff so it's documented. But no veterinarians."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IS IT THE ISSUE OF MONEY? No, not really. We don't live in a place - where like a veterinarian, the closest one is seventy miles. So, for them to come and do it, wouldn't be - well, we just never thought about it. But, no it's not a question of money. It's just something we never thought about. BUT IT'S A BIG DEAL TO GET A VET OUT THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE? Sure, it is. It's a big deal for an emergency to get a vet out here. DO YOU HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS ON ALL THE MUTILATIONS ON YOUR RANCH? No. I have photographs of one of the first one that we had. WHICH IS WHAT YEAR? Oh, man, it's been probably four years ago. And she - it happened in the winter, too - I remember that very distinctly because it was so muddy that you could hardly, you couldn't get off the road. Even the gravel road. If you stepped on to the shoulder of the road, you would get stuck or sink clear to your knees. And we went to feed there and there was, she was laying right under a power line. And it's right next to the feed grounds. She was mutilated. But there was no tracks and it was so muddy, we just thought, 'Whoooah, this is weird!' THERE WERE NO TRACKS, EVEN IN THE MUD? There was no tracks in the mud. And my father-in-law had a bull a few years ago. And it was so dusty, you could sink clear to your ankles in the dust and there was no tracks. MEANING THAT YOUR, MR. HANK FILIPPINI, HAD A MUTILATION OF A BULL AND THE BULL WAS FOUND IN DUST AND THERE WERE NO TRACKS. No tracks, no tracks. WHEN YOU SEE GROUND LIKE THAT WITH NO TRACKS WITH A MUTILATED ANIMAL LAYING IN THE MIDDLE, WHAT GOES THROUGH YOUR MIND? The thing that really bothers me. I say this is open space. We run miles and miles of range, twenty or thirty miles. And there are cows all over it. Why would you pick a cow out of a pasture and then put it back? And who knows - we know our cow because it's identified with brands and marks. But that cow could have been taken from somewhere else and put there. THE VERY FACT THAT RANCHERS HAVE SAID THIS EXACT THING OVER FORTY YEARS - WHY IS THE ANIMAL PUT BACK TO BE FOUND? - HAS BEEN PART OF THE HIGH STRANGENESS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS THAT WHEN COMBINED WITH SOME OF THE EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS HAS CIRCUMSTANTIALLY LINKED ANIMAL MUTILATIONS TO THE PRESENCE OF AN ALIEN LIFE FORM. Well, there's no blood. And there's no body fluid draining out. There's not like most animals die, they urinate or they poop. And there's not that. There's no blood. There's no blood around the incisions. All of the cuts are perfect. Nobody could do that on a loose skinned animal and make a perfectly round circle. It has to be done with a laser, but you don't see burns. You don't see like something that had been seared. That's not visible on a fresh mutilation. And the fact that predators won't go around them is odd. They sense something and won't eat it. Like a crow will eat anything! Heck, if I laid down in the road, he'd eat me in a minute! But they won't even touch those (mutilations). They will land on them, but they won't eat them. They won't even peck their eyes out. That's strange. That sounds gory, but predators will eat whatever. YOU ARE USED TO RANCHING AND SEEING THE NORMAL KINDS OF DEATHS ON A RANCH AND WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS THAT THESE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS REALLY STAND OUT AS"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BEING STRANGE. Yeah, sure. You might not find them for a day or so and they are still there and they're not eaten. The cuts are still real visible and real round and perfect. And the things that are missing like the udder, they take the skin off their jaw, they take the sexual organs. Like with the bull, they'll take the whole strip, the whole cord to the penis and the testicles and it's all round. And in the cow they take the vagina and rectum. That's what I found is odd. Why would they take? But we never had an autopsy to see if any internal organs are gone. THERE HAVE BEEN MISSING ORGANS WHEN NECROPSIES HAVE BEEN DONE. Really? YES. Like what? HEARTS HAVE BEEN REMOVED INSIDE OF PERICARDIUM WITH THE PERICARDIUM AROUND THE HEART STILL INTACT. EIGHT INCHES OF TRACHEA AND ESOPHAGUS HAVE BEEN REMOVED IN SEVERAL ANIMALS. THE BLADDER HAS BEEN COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM SOME ANIMALS. With no external incisions. NO EXTERNAL EXCISIONS IN TERMS OF THE BLADDER OR THE HEART. Yeah, pretty odd. But I just say, 'It's our government out to get us. They're practicing on us.' The only people I know who would be that low would be the U. S. government to do something that humiliating and awful to an animal. BUT THEY MAY BE TRYING TO COPE WITH THIS AS WELL AND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO IF IT IS IN FACT AN ALIEN LIFE FORM, WHAT CAN THEY DO TO STOP IT? CLEARLY MUTILATIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON FOR OVER 40 YEARS WITHOUT ANYONE BEING ABLE TO STOP IT. Oh, no. I don't know. The one police officer who came here - he was pretty green, greener than grass. And he was saying something about a satanic cult was doing this. And like we're going, 'There are no tracks.' If there was a bunch of stupid kids, there would be blood and guts and just chewed up like you can't believe. This was a little too professional for a bunch of cult things.\" More Information: Then last month in South Dakota on August 5th, an 1,800 pound bull was found laying on a barbwire fence dead and mutilated as if lowered chest first straight down onto the sharp wire that penetrated into the hide without cuts or tears . The bull belonged to Milo and Marilee Hauck in Menno, a ranching community in Hutchinson County. The testicles and scrotum were removed in a neat, oval cut, but the penile tissue was laying along one leg, pulled through the sheath while still connected to tissue inside the abdomen. A week later, on Tuesday, August 10th, a cow was found dead and mutilated on the Mark and Cindy Ulmer ranch next door. The cow's vagina and rectal tissue were removed in a U-shaped cut. The lips and tongue were also gone. Again, no blood, no tracks. Several days later, four different Menno residents reported large, white lights hovering or moving silently. Please see: Unusual Animal Deaths, Part 2: South Dakota. If mutilations are reported within 24 hours, necropsies and pathology analyses can be done as well as soil and plant analyses.
