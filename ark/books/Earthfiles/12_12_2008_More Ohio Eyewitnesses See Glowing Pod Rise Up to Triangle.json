He was excited to tell us what he had seen at 3:45 AM on October 23, in Empire, Ohio - a triangular craft with glowing lights at the three corners above a glowing object that was rising up to the craft’s dark, crystalline surface. Tim took three photos of the objects on his cell phone, which I reported in an October 31, 2008, Earthfiles report. See: 103108 Earthfiles. Since then, I have received more reports from Ohio residents provoked enough by Tim Comstock’s photographs at Earthfiles to contact me about their own sightings of the triangle and the very strange, glowing “pod,” or “cocoon” as Tim described it, rising up into the triangular craft. Another eyewitness is a security guard I’ll call Sarah, who works in the Stratton and Empire, Ohio, region. The largest company there is the W. H. Sammis coal power plant. About 40 miles northeast are three other power plants owned and operated by FirstEnergy Corp. Two are nuclear stations at Beaver Valley Power Station and FENOC (FirstEnergy Nuclear Operating Co.), both in Shippingport on the Pennsylvania side of the Ohio River. The third First Energy company in Shippingport is the Bruce Mansfield Plant, First Energy's largest coal-fired power plant. F ar left red circle is Midvale in Tuscarawas County, Ohio, about an hour west of Empire and Stratton (middle red circle). The Ohio River separates Ohio from Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Upstream from Empire and Stratton on the Ohio River at Shippingport, Pennsylvania (far right red circle), are two nuclear power plants and one large coal power plant. Sarah is 48-years-old, was born and raised in the Steubenville, Ohio, region north of Empire and has worked as a security guard the past eleven years. She was very surprised to learn about Tim Comstock’s October 23rd photographs because three months earlier in the first week of August 2008, Sarah was on security duty around midnight when she saw a triangle pattern of lights, “just like the one in Tim Comstock’s photos.” And she watched again on October 23rd at 3:45 AM Eastern. While Tim Comstock had slowed his big truck down to about two miles an hour on new Route 7 south of Empire to watch the amazing lights and snap images on his cell phone, Sarah was about three-tenths of a mile further north on old Route 7 watching the exact same phenomenon from a different angle. Sarah describes the large triangular craft she has seen, beginning with her first August sighting. Interviews: Sarah, Security Guard, Empire and Stratton, Ohio: “The first time I saw the triangular shape of lights was in the beginning of August 2008. I was at work. I was sitting at our north gate. My dad always taught me you can learn many things looking at the sky, so I’m a sky watcher. I was looking at the different stars and in this one section of sky above the plant, the stars just suddenly seemed to disappear. As I was watching, there were these three, bright, yellowish-white lights that appeared. They were in a triangular pattern. You couldn’t see any 3-dimensional form to it. There were just the three lights. Those three lights hovered for a while. They would get bright and then they would go a little duller like they would have a little bit of orange mixed into them. They hovered for a while and then it moved straight up in the sky and it moved towards the east. Then it stopped and started to go north and then zigzagged from west to east and then it took off straight up. It was almost faster than your eyes could follow it. DO YOU REMEMBER THE DATE IN AUGUST? I believe it was like August 5 or 6, right around midnight. But at that time in August, it did not have the 3-D pod under it. It didn’t have that in August. And there was one person who was working that night, who said they had seen something, but they were up a little further north than I was. They said they saw something block out the stars and there were"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"bright lights.” 3:45 AM, October 23, 2008 S arah Also Sees Glowing “Pod” Rising Toward Triangle of Lights Sarah didn’t talk to anyone else about the early August sighting of the triangle pattern of lights that moved so strangely. But three months later at 3:45 AM on October 23, 2008, not only was she seeing the triangle pattern of round lights again, but rising below the triangular aircraft was a mysterious, large, orange-yellow, glowing object that she refers to as a “pod.” Truck driver Tim Comstock felt the rising, glowing object was somehow alive and organic and called it a “cocoon.” Tim could not stop his truck and never saw what happened when the glowing cocoon, or pod, reached the triangle of lights. But Sarah did and now continues her description of what happened after she again saw stars disappearing in the sky. S arah: “This sketch is when I first saw the triangle of lights and the orange-yellow, 3-D pod coming up from out of the trees. At first I thought that the pod was the moon coming up. The only problem was that this is West and the moon comes up in the East. The three whitish-blue, circle lights were super bright like looking into a spot light up close.” Sketch © 2008 by Sarah. Sarah: “I was doing a patrol down at our abandoned Toronto plant. I was coming northbound on old Route 7 looking at the sky and I noticed that the stars were disappearing. I pulled off to the side of the road and I noticed these three, really bright, lights. They were circular shaped and they were almost like looking into a spotlight. There were three round lights in a triangular pattern and it just hovered above the trees and there was this pod, like a 3-D (3-dimensional) pod shape that was a bright, yellowish-orange that was rising up. It came from the trees and went up towards the triangular shaped object. The closer the glowing pod got (to the triangle craft), you could see there was a bottom surface between the three bright circular lights - a dark, charcoal grey or black - that had a rough texture like burnt aluminum foil all crumpled up and you straighten it out."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"S arah: “This is a drawing of the underside of the craft that looked something like burnt and crumpled aluminum foil after you tried to straighten it back out.” Sketch © 2008 by Sarah. SO KIND OF A CRYSTALLINE, CRINKLY SURFACE? Ye s . I WONDER IF COULD DESCRIBE THE POD A LITTLE MORE IN TERMS OF COLOR, WHAT EXACTLY YOU ARE SEEING AND WHAT HAPPENS AS IT RISES TOWARD THE TRIANGULAR CONFIGURATION OF LIGHTS? The bottom of it almost looked like if you were looking at the bottom of a boat – like it’s an oval, but has a ridge through the middle of it. It kind of looked like that and then was kind of squared off further up. From the way I was looking at it, it almost looked like a bright, yellowish-orange in color. S arah: “This is a sketch of the triangular craft's bottom surface between the three circular lights I could see as the glowing pod was getting closer to it. The bottom was like a mix of charcoal grey and black in color. The texture looked almost like burnt, crumpled foil that someone had tried to straighten out. It was one of the strangest sights I have ever seen.” Sketch © 2008 by Sarah."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"S arah: “This sketch is what the 3-D pod looked like to me. I did have a strange feeling all the time that it was in the sky. The feelings disappeared after the craft was out of sight.” Sketch © 2008 by Sarah. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK YOU WERE FROM THAT RISING COCOON OR POD IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHERE TIM COMSTOCK WAS? From there, I was probably three-tenths of a mile further north from where he was. The 3-D pod kept rising up. I never saw an opening in the bottom of the craft. But it was as the pod got closer, it was like the triangular craft sucked it in. I can’t explain. It was just like the pod suddenly disappeared. And then the bright lights hovered there for a few minutes and then they just shot up! “Not from this Earth!” INTUITIVELY, DID YOU HAVE ANY INSTINCT ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE WATCHING? At first, no. When I first saw the lights, I wasn’t sure what it was. But when I saw the 3-D pod shape coming up and it was not like anything I have ever seen. MEANING THAT THE GLOWING OBJECT WAS RISING INTO THAT CRAFT THAT HAD THE THREE TRIANGULAR LIGHTS? Yes. My immediate thought was that I had just witnessed another UFO. NOT FROM THIS PLANET? No. Wholeheartedly, I believe that triangular craft and pod were not from this Earth! YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE? Just by the feeling I got and the way it looked. I had never seen anything like that before. I had a strange feeling. You could tell by looking at it that it was not from the Earth. I have seen different airplanes and I just got this weird, almost like a tingling feeling, almost like when you know someone is watching you, but you can’t see them? It was almost like that feeling. That whole feeling quit as soon as the triangular-shaped craft disappeared, shot off. Then it was like everything went back to normal again. IN YOUR SECURITY WORK, DID YOU GET ON THE PHONE TO ANYBODY ABOUT THIS? I didn’t get on the phone. I was driving and went straight up to the next gate going in and asked the guard there, ‘Did you see that thing in the sky?’ And they said, ‘What?’ I asked, ‘You didn’t see the lights?’ And they said, ‘No.’ I looked south from where the guard shack was and there is a bend where one hill is coming down and then a valley and another hill. The other hill is where the lights were. So from the guard shack, they weren’t going to see anything. Glowing “Pod” Was Rising Near Sugar Grove Neighborhood"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BACK AT THAT HILLSIDE ALONG ROUTE 7 WHERE TIM COMSTOCK PASSED THE HALF DOZEN PEOPLE PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROAD AND PULLED HIS BIG TRUCK RIG DOWN TO 2 OR 3 MPH SO HE COULD WATCH AND TAKE HIS CELL PHONE PHOTOS, WHAT IS THAT HILL? On top of that hill is a place called Sugar Grove. WHAT IS SUGAR GROVE? It’s basically a road with houses spread out on it. Then there is a large plot of land that drops down the hill. Where the pod seemed to be rising from was from the trees near the bottom of the hill. SO A RESIDENTIAL AREA IS AT THE TOP OF THE HILLSIDE THAT TIM COMSTOCK COULD SEE FROM HIS TRUCK? Yes. The Sammis power plant even has a microwave tower up there where all of our communications go through. After seeing the lights, I took a trip up there because it seemed to be the general area where the pod was lifting up. I couldn’t see anything up there. I thought maybe if it had landed, there might be marks on the ground. But it was dark and I kept looking around and I didn’t see anything. The following weekend I went up there. We have cameras up there around the microwave tower and I was moving the cameras around to see if I could find anything like burn marks or grass laid down. I couldn’t find anything and nothing on a camera. I have seen several odd objects in the sky or hovering over that area at night. Sarah Has Seen Many Unidentified Aerial Objects Over Sammis Power Plant and Sugar Grove WHAT OTHER TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN UFOS THERE? Back in July 2006, I was on a mobile (security) round and had stopped at the north gate to talk with one of my friends there. We were standing outside talking and there was a disc-shaped object that was between us and the smokestacks for the Sammis power plant. The smoke stacks from that guard shack, they are probably only about one-tenth of a mile away. THOSE ARE SMOKE STACKS AT THE W. H. SAMMIS POWER PLANT? Yes. And this object appeared to the west of the plant at first between where we were standing and the smokestacks. At first, we kind of thought it was a star. But then, it dropped down to probably treetop level and it went east, which put it right between where we were and the smokestacks. Then you could see the different colored lights. There was blue, orange, yellow, red and an odd color that you couldn’t even put a name to it doing circles around the disc object. AS IF THERE WAS SOME OTHER GLOWING OBJECT ROTATING OR ORBITING AROUND THE LARGER OBJECT? Ye s . THEN WHAT HAPPENED? It kind of hovered there for a little bit and then it shot off toward the east. SO HOW MANY TIMES DO YOU THINK YOU’VE SEEN THE STRANGE ZIGZAGGING LIGHTS? I would say close to fifty times or more. Large, Multi-Colored UFO November 21, 2008 From: Sarah Subject: New Sighting Date: November 22, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"“There was a new sighting just south of the W.H. Sammis plant last night (November 21, 2008). While I was at work last night, there was a very bright light in the sky above Toronto, Ohio. It was like looking at a spotlight up close, but you could see colored light going around it - first blue, then red, then yellow, then orange. It was very strange. As I was watching, it just all of a sudden shot off to the west so fast that you could hardly follow it. Then it stopped and started zig- zagging in the sky. Then it just disappeared.” I sent you an email about the other object that we saw the night of November 21st. I was down at the Toronto plant and looking at the sky probably five miles south of Empire. There was a bright light in the sky. It was too high to distinguish exactly what shape it was, but it had the multi-colored lights going around it – first blue would go around it, then there was the red, there was the orange, there was the yellow. And I motioned for one of the contractors down there to look and he and I stood there and watched it. It probably hovered there for a good five minutes. HOW CLOSE TO THE GROUND? It was way up in the sky, probably 3,000 to 4,000 feet, if not more. BUT WAS IT LARGE? Ye s . IF YOU EXTENDED YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW ARM’S LENGTH, WOULD YOUR HAND COVER IT? My hand might barely cover it. SO, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LARGER THAN THE FULL MOON IN THE SKY? Yeah, pretty much – that night it was. It was huge! THE MULTI-COLORED LIGHTS, WERE THEY SPINNING AROUND THE PERIMETER? Yes, they were going from left to right. FLASHING ON AND OFF? Not really flashing on and off. It was like a steady color. When it circled, you could almost see like a trail behind it. First, it was a blue light that circled it and you could see the trail. And then there was an orange one that circled it and you could see the trail. Then it went to red and you could see the trail. Then there was a yellow one that went around it.” Another Triangle and Glowing Pod in Midvale, Ohio 2:33 AM Eastern, November 2, 2008 Another surprising discovery after I posted my Earthfiles news report about Tim Comstock’s photos of the highly strange triangle of lights and glowing cocoon or pod rising up into it came from Midvale, Ohio, about an hour’s drive west of Empire. Midvale is in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Tuscarawas County and has a population of about 550. One young resident there is 22-years-old, recently married and goes by the nickname, “Joy.” Joy has insomnia and is often up after midnight, as she was in the early morning hours of Sunday, November 2, 2008. Joy, Midvale, Ohio: “The last time I looked at the clock, it was 2:33 AM, on November 2, 2008, early in the morning. I’m usually up then watching TV and I decided to have a cigarette. I always go over to the desk to smoke beside the window. Something caught my eye out the window and I looked out to see a very large, orange-yellow-white-colored ‘orb,’ lacking a better word. The orb didn’t seem to keep one shape. I saw it at the edge of the tree line behind my house. WHEN YOU SAY IT DIDN’T KEEP A SHAPE, CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT? It just seemed to kind of waver around. IN YOUR EMAIL TO ME, YOU DESCRIBED IT AS WATCHING AN AMOEBA MOVING? Yes. It looked like if you were looking under a microscope – the little blobs that you see, how they sort of just wiggle around? AMOEBAS. Yeah. SO, THIS WAS GLOWING, BUT IT WAS CHANGING SHAPE RAPIDLY? Ye s . IT WAS RISING AT THE SAME TIME? It moved horizontally and it was changing shape, but it wasn’t like going up or down. It was just following a straight line through the tree line. Then, it dipped down behind the trees and when it did that, I could see the silhouette of the trees in front of it, but I could not see the trees behind it, as if it were solid. M oving left to right, the glowing “orb” or “pod,” moved horizontally along tree line before moving upward (far right) and into triangle of lights higher in the sky. Photo and graphic illustration © 2008 by Joy. After that, it hung in the air in the same spot for probably less than 30 seconds; moved backwards and upwards a little bit; and then a lot more rapidly then it had been moving, it moved forward but further away from me and up way higher than the tree line. It seemed from the distance I could tell in the dark – it moved about a few football field lengths from where the back of my house is where it had been moving steadily parallel to my house, the object moved away and up. So, I can’t tell exactly how far the lights were in the triangular pattern, but I didn’t even notice those lights until the glowing, changing shape reached them and I then realized there were dim lights in the triangular pattern."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"“P od” continued left to right along tree line and up and disappeared with triangular pattern of lights at approximately 2:33 AM Eastern, November 2, 2008, near Midvale, Ohio, home. Dark circles show position in daylight photo where lights were in night sky as glowing, orange-yellow object moved upward. Photograph and graphic illustration © 2 008 by “Joy.” After the glowing thing reached the triangle, from the angle it was at I could not see any reflections, but right way I called a friend who lives on the next road over and asked her if anything was going on there. She said there was something behind her house approximately over the wooded area that’s right behind the first road in town. Neighborhood Dogs Agitated and Barking IS SHE THE NEIGHBOR WHO SAID HER DOG WAS GOING CRAZY? Yes, but they are always barking – the ones that are closest to me. But they were going absolutely crazy that night. FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, THE GLOWING, ‘AMOEBA-CHANGING’ OBJECT ROSE UP TO A TRIANGULAR PATTERN OF WHITISH LIGHTS IN THE SKY AND DISAPPEARED? Yes. It (glowing pod) reached the triangle and hung there for a few moments and then all the lights went out as if someone just flipped a switch and turned them off. AS YOU WERE STARING FROM THE WINDOW, DID YOU HAVE ANY INTUITIVE FLASH ABOUT WHAT IT MIGHT BE? I didn’t until afterward. I was just kind of frozen to the window and I was so shocked because it was just so odd. It takes you by surprise when there is something that close right to you and there is no way to explain what it is. I just watched it and I’m surprised that I even had the common sense to open the window to get a better look. I was just kind of hypnotized by it, you know? I did not want to run for the camera and then lose it and it go out of sight or vanish. I wanted to see what it did, where it went, all these things going through my head like what could it be? HOW FAR DO YOU THINK IT WAS FROM YOU? It was about a large back yard distance away from me. LESS THAN 300 FEET AWAY? Yes. [ Joy measured the distance to the tree line from her window and it is 152 feet.] THE COLOR WAS WHAT ORANGE THAT I MIGHT KNOW? It was a little lighter than pumpkin orange with yellow and white softly mixed in. Those colors weren't coming from the center of it, but it looked like they were bouncing around inside of it."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" Glowing “Orb” Tilted When Moving Backward or Forward WAS THE OBJECT THAT WAS CHANGING SHAPE, DID IT EVER GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT IT WAS SPINNING? Not spinning, necessarily, but tilting a little. TILTING. Even though it was changing shape, it appeared there was a front and a back to it because whenever it stopped and backed up, it started to tilt as if it were turning like toward one direction or the other. Then it went back horizontally and instead of turning around, it just backed up like reverse and then went forward. YOU COULD SEE IT TILT WHEN IT WAS MAKING THOSE BACK AND FORWARD MOTIONS? Ye s . THIS WAS NOT VERY FAR FROM YOU. COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND? No sound whatsoever, except the dogs. My dog inside of the house was (barking) and he is not in the same room. He’s kept in a cage at night. And he had been whimpering and whining all night. “It Did Not Seem Manmade” WHEN YOU THINK OF NOVEMBER 2ND AND STARING AT THE AMOEBA ORANGE OBJECT THAT FINALLY RISES UP INTO THE TRIANGLE OF LIGHTS, DOES ANYTHING COME INTO YOUR MIND THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH WHAT MIGHT BE IN THE GLOWING LIGHT OR THE TRIANGLE? That’s what I wonder. I mean I tried to come up with any possible explanation. What could this be? It did not seem to be a manmade object or anything mechanical or a spotlight or a flashlight beam or anything. It was different than anything I’d ever seen.” I f anyone has more information about the triangular craft and glowing pod in Ohio or elsewhere, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
