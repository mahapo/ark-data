R eturn to Updated Part 1 August 23, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The Writers' list of ancient and modern books concerning spiritual warfare with negative forces in the unseen included Campbell Thompson's Volume 2 of The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia: “Fever Sickness and Headache, Etc.” ©1904. Given the reptilian humanoid sculptures in Volume 1, it is noteworthy that in Thompson's list of the 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablets from which his book emerged, there is this description: “A group of tablets which contain descriptions of a number of supernatural beings, which corresponded roughly to the modern Arabic Jinn and Jann. The identification of the greater number of these is difficult; among those worthy of special note is the goddess NIN-TU, who is said to wear an elaborate tiara and veil and to be girt about the loins with a zone or garment, her breast being uncovered. The upper part of her body is that of a naked woman, and the lower part is said to be scaly like the skin of a snake. “It is important from many points of view to observe that she is represented suckling her babe at the left breast. In the course of excavations, which have been made in Assyria during the last fifty years (1850 to 1900), numbers of clay figures possessing the characteristics described above have been found...” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" L eft: Sumerian goddess figurine from Ubaid in Mesopotamia c. 5000 B.

January 24, 1992 - Writers First Talk with Ray Boeche in Nebraska Two years before I received my first June 21, 1994, floppy disc from the Writers through Ray Boeche in Nebraska, Ray had his first face-to-face meeting with them. Ray is a university computer graphics professional and privately has investigated UFO phenomena for a long time. The men introduced themselves to Ray as working in intelligence for the Department of Defense and were interested in sharing information they thought relevant to Ray's research, his work in a local Protestant church and devotion to Christ. The date was January 24, 1992, and Ray later wrote in his notes about that meeting, “Presentation seemed very much ‘scripted’ as if the men were presenting material memorized from master script. Presentation was deliberately slow enough to allow me to take notes almost verbatim, except for portions when I was told to cease writing.” Ray Boeche has now given me permission to include some of his January 24, 1992, summary notes of that first meeting with the Writers. Ray Boeche: One leading American researcher stated that a division exists in the field of paranormal research between “black” and “white” projects, but maintains that there are no “good” paranormal research efforts because “the occult is inherently evil.” There is a growing awareness that this type of research is very dangerous, not only in a physical sense, but “in a spiritual sense as well.” Whatever doesn't come from God is evil, and Satan can counterfeit many of God's miraculous actions.\" Research is being done on teleportation, healing, extracting information from the brains of dead subjects, remote viewing, developing computers with the ab ility to interpret and record the waveforms of thoughts, enabling them to be recorded and or transmitted. Several projects have been designed to study “negative healing,” the psychic infliction of pain, injury and death. Proposed Mechanism of Paranormal Events, Based on the Research of Physicist David Bohm, Author of Wholeness and the Implicate Order © 1981 Take 2 glass cylinders, one smaller than the other. Place the smaller inside the larger and fill the space between with glycerine, a colorless, thick, viscous fluid. Introduce a drop of ink into the glycerine and revolve the outer cylinder. As you do, the ink will stretch into a thread, growing longer, thinner and fainter, until it completely disappears. The ink is now enfolded into the glycerine - you can no longer see it, but you know it's there. Where is it? It is no longer in any single position. It is spread out, nowhere and everywhere."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In extensive research, here and abroad, there is much evidence to suggest that everything that exits today, or ever did exist, is similarly enfolded in an invisible medium. We become aware of things only when they are unfolded out of the invisible medium into our reality. Now, if you reverse the direction of the cylinders, the thread of ink begins to reappear, much as if a film of the enfolding process were being run backward. One could enfold any number of ink droplets into the medium and by turning the cylinder backward very rapidly, they would suddenly appear as if out of nowhere. This is the mechanism of how we become aware of the reality of our world. Enfolding and unenfolding the ink drops in the glycerine is comparable to enfolding and unenfolding an object backward and forward through time and space. Everything exists everywhere at once, enfolded into an invisible, seemingly timeless medium. Any object you could imagine might not be visible to you right now, but nevertheless, a portion of it exists with you, invisibly enfolded, just as the ink drop existed invisibly enfolded throughout the glycerine. When you throw a pebble into a pond, the ripples expand from the point the pebble strikes the water, hit the edge of the pond, create more ripples that move back toward the center of the pool, and all these ripples run into each other and the points at which they cross are called interferences. If you could suddenly freeze the pond, the points at which the ripples interfered with each other would provide information about the weight, shape and movement of the pebble that caused them. Theoretically, you would have enough information to actually create a 3-dimensional representation of the pebble. This is exactly the principle behind the hologram. Every point in a hologram contains the entire picture, just as in our first example, every point in the glycerine contained ink. What this means, to go back to our other analogy, is that to form a picture of the pebble, we don't have to have all the points where the ripples interfered with each other. We need only some of them, perhaps only one of them. Highly complex wave patterns can be reduced to a collection of simple waves that can be represented numerically. These numbers are called Fourier components and the transformation of those waves into these numerical components is called a Fourier transform. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - F ourier transform on Euclidean space. “In mathematics, the Fourier transform (often abbreviated FT) is an operation that transforms one complex-valued function of a real variable into another. In such applications as signal processing, the domain of the original function is typically time and is accordingly called the time domain. That of the new function is frequency, and so the Fourier transform is often called the frequency domain representation of the original function. For instance, a note played on a flute is reasonably pure: a single frequency with only minor overtones, which are additional, related frequencies. It may be envisaged as a simple repeating wave; a sine wave, because of the relative absence of such overtones. But the same note played on an oboe or guitar would have a somewhat shriller sound, caused by a higher level of overtones. It would appear visually more complex, because of the significant presence of such overtones. In this example, a Fourier transform is the representation of the frequencies (and their amplitudes) present in that note of that instrument. For the flute note it would be approximately a single vertical line at the single frequency; for the oboe note there would be additional, smaller (lower amplitude) vertical lines representing the overtones. It is also possible to generalize the Fourier transform on discrete structures such as finite groups, efficient computation of which through a fast Fourier transform is essential for high-speed computing.” ] Using this process, we can search the enfolding medium of space and time for the Fourier components of any object, forward or backward through time. Everything that has ever existed in the universe has produced lasting interference patterns in the sea of radiation crated at the instant God said, “Let there be light.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Holography and Fourier transforms are simply a way of separating an image from its object, then viewing the image at a distance. Your mind actually does this every time you remember something. You see the image in your mind, though the object itself is somewhere else, distant in time and space. There is quite probably more than one medium. Each is itself enfolded within another, a regressing series of enfolding media. The ultimate medium, the one into which everything is enfolded, is not a medium at all. It is a Person, the Creator, transcendent and existing prior to His creation. The world is composed, in one sense, of interference patterns - of frequencies. Just as the frequency of music over the radio can be disrupted by a static-inducing appliance in the next room, the frequency of things in this world can be interfered with by disruptive static frequencies. If any object is characterized by - that is, it is the product of - certain frequencies, certain Fourier components, then it will be altered if those frequencies are altered. The human brain itself constantly performs Fourier analysis on all the interference patterns in the enfolding medium. The universe itself is a hologram, and the brain is part of that hologram. The brain contains all of space and time, just as each fragment of a hologram contains the entire picture. If you had full access to the content of your brain, you'd be able to see everything. This is how the paranormal works. That's how psychic s know what is happening remotely. And by interfering with the Fourier components of objects, whether inanimate or living cells, they can heal, induce illness or influence electronic components or the roll of dice. Their minds are tuned to the universal hologram - they have access to all the Fourier components. All human brains perform Fourier analysis, and some can access the Fourier transforms to achieve paranormal feats. These feats, performed by humans, are unreliable and unquantifiable. However, a psychotronic device could perform these functions better than humans, much as a computer performs mathematical functions better than humans. In addition to being able to see and predict, to perform these passive functions, the device would also be able to exert an effect upon both animate and inanimate objects. Psychokinetic capab ility a ppears to follow an inverse-square law - that is, the degree of motion which can be caused, decreases as the square of the mass of the affected body. What is being attempted is to electronically recognize frequency interference patterns in space, screen them for the desired Fourier components, transform the components into viewable holographic images, and then sharpen these images with holographic image deblurring. In this way, you can see anything you want, particularly with laser assistance. The psychotronic device operates by performing Fourier transforms on background radiation. This is achieved by analysis of laser radiation. Light from an airborne excimer laser can easily penetrate cloud cover and seawater, for instance. Large areas of ocean, to a depth of several thousand feet, could be scanned. By analyzing the laser return from molecules ejected by a submarine, for instance, one could tell how many and what type of missiles are aboard, how many men in the crew and so on. Laser radiation can be used to observe electrons moving in silicon chips. the psychotronic device could divert those electrons. It has the potential capability to defeat any computer, every electronic or mechanical device, using nothing more than the natural radiation present everywhere in the universe - electromagnetic radiation. These Fourier components can be stored like any other numerical data. After capturing the interference patterns, the entire “imaging process” is computerized, so saving and transmitting the data would be routine.” [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The akashic records (akasha is a Sanskrit word meaning sky, space or aether ) is a term used in theosophy (and Anthroposophy) to describe a compendium of mystical knowledge encoded in a non-physical plane of existence. These records are described to contain all knowledge of human experience and the history of the cosmos. They are metaphorically described as a library and other analogues commonly found in discourse on the subject include a “universal computer” and the “Mind of God.” Descriptions of the records assert that they are constantly updated and that they can be accessed through astral projection. ” ] C ontinued in Part 9.
