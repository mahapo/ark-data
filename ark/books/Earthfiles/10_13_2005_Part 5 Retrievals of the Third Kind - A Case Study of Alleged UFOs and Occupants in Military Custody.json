Here begins Part 5 of Status Report I, written July 29, 1978. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report II begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" ABSTRACT 17 On June 29, 1978, my son-in-law, Jeffrey Sparks, Assistant Professor of Theater Arts at St. Leo's College, Dade City, Florida, informed me that he had talked with a person who had witnessed the alien humanoids at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1966. According to my son-in-law, his contact holds a responsible position in a financial capacity with a private firm in Tampa and had formerly served in military Intelligence. He gave me the individual's name and where he could be reached. On July 5, 1978, I talked with Mr. JK at length concerning his functions in military Intelligence; what he had observed at Wright-Patterson, and many other aspects of crashed alien craft. He also made reference to the computer bank, or 'dump file' which contains secret information about UFOs dating back to 1948. JK, who served in Nike Missile Air Intelligence (ADCAP), related to me the following data: 1. He observed nine deceased alien bodies preserved in deep freeze conditions under well-lighted, thick glass enclosures. The bodies were short in stature, about four feet in height. They appeared, under the lighting, to be of grayish color in skin tone. The research area where the bodies were preserved was under heavy guard, inside and out. He was told while viewing the subjects that 30 bodies were held in preservation at that time in the Air Base. 2. He did not see firsthand alien craft stored at Wright-Patterson, but was told that such craft were on the base. He was also told that an alien craft was held at Langley AFB in Virginia and another at McDill AFB in Florida. 3. JK knew of three key areas in the 1960s where certain secret UFO operations were conducted other than at Wright-Patterson AFB. Bases cited were Langley, Avon Bombing Range - a part of the McDill AFB complex near Sebring, Florida; and at Seymour-Johnson, a Navy Training Center in Goldsboro, South Carolina. 4. At certain military bases, highly trained mobilized units were in a constant 'ready' state for dispatch to any area in the U. S. to recover downed or crashed UFOs. 5. During the Vietnam crisis, during JK's tenure of service (1966-1968), five "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"crashes of UFOs occurred in the Tri-State area of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. There was one known incident of a retrieval of three alien bodies. During this latter incident, there occurred an alleged shooting with the alien forces by our military units. This was triggered by the uncertainty of the alien's intent. Hostility was presumed, said JK. The location or time of these incidents were not disclosed. 6. Said JK, 'Since 1948, secret information concerning UFO activity involving the U. S. military has been contained in a Computer Center at Wright- Patterson. At this base, a master file, written in computer language, is maintained with duplicate support backup files secreted at other military installations.' Said JK, 'Get the complete 'file dump,' both the master and the support backup files and you've got all the hidden UFO data.' COMMENT: Obviously, the UFO files available to the public at the National Archives in Washington, D. C., do not reveal the hard facts regarding UFO military cases. Concerning JK's disclosures relative to military units subject to dispatch to UFO retrieval areas, I have been aware from other military sources that special forces have been maintained for emergency situations such as UFO retrievals or other conditions, including riots. These special forces, known as 'Blue Berets' can operate secretly and effectively by using 'diversionary tactics' to prevent public interference. Such diversions include creating power blackouts. ABSTRACT 18 This abstract concerns limited biological data with Exhibits A and B which reliable informants have described concerning the alien humanoids held in institutions in the U. S. where special examinations were conducted. Because this information treats a sensitive area within the framework of secrecy such as the names of the medical centers, the identity of the informants will not be disclosed at this time. Data mentioned in a number of the previous abstracts have been correlated by me to establish only a general anatomical configuration of the alien beings. Needless to say, the general features of the alien are akin to Earth's Homo sapiens . That is to say, the alien has a head, torso, arms, hands and is bipedal. There, the likeness ends. From anonymous medical and military sources, the following composite or general data were obtained: 1. The approximate height of the alien humanoid is 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall. One source approximated 5 feet. 2. The head, by human standards, is large when compared with the size of the torso and limbs. (See drawing of head, Exhibit A.) 3. The facial features show a pair of eyes described variously as large, sunken or deep set, far apart or distended more than human; and slightly slanted, appearing 'Oriental' or 'Mongoloid.' 4. No ear lobes or flesh extending beyond apertures on each side of the head. 5. Nose is vague. Aperture or nares are indicated with slight protuberance. One, and two nares, have been mentioned. 6. Mouth is indicated as a small 'slit.' In some instances, no mouth described. Mouth appears not to function as a means for communication or as orifice for food ingestion. 7. Neck. Described as being thin; and in some instances, not being visible because of garment in that section of body. 8. Hair. Some observers describe the humanoids as hairless. Some say that the pate shows a slight fuzz. Bodies are described as hairless. 9. Torso. Small and thin fits the general description. In many instances, the body was observed wearing a garment. From medical authorities, no comment. No abdominal naval indicated. 10. Arms are described as long and thin and reaching down to the knee section."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 11. Hands. Four fingers, no thumb. Two fingers appear longer than others. Some observers had seen fingernails; others without. A webbing effect between fingers was noted by three authoritative observers. (See drawing of hand, Exhibit B, and testimonial letter from Mr. Ted Phillips, Exhibit C. Phillips is specialist for MUFON and CUFOS in investigation of UFO trace evidence.) 12. No description available of legs or feet. 13. Skin description is NOT green. It is of rough texture and gray according to most observers. Some claim beige, tan, brown, or tannish or pinkish-gray and one said it looked almost 'bluish-gray' under deep freeze lights. In one instance, the bodies were charred to a dark brown. 14. Teeth unknown. No data from dental authorities. 15. Reproductive organs. This biological region is 'sensitive' - meaning 'secret.' One observer claims no male or female organs were identified. No genitalia. In my nonprofessional judgment, the absence of sexual organs suggests some of the aliens, and perhaps all, do not reproduce as do the Homo sapiens. Perhaps some of the bodies studied are produced by a system of cloning or other unknown means. 16. In some incidents of retrieval, the humanoids appear to be 'formed out of a mold,' or share identical biological characteristics. 17. Brain capacity. Unknown. 18. Blood. Liquid is prevalent, but not blood as we know it. 19. Sustenance for existence. No food or water intake is known. No food found on craft in one known retrieval. No alimentary canal or rectal area described. 20. Humanoid types. Unknown. Descriptive variations of anatomy might be no more diverse than those known among Earth Homo sapiens. Other alien types, reportedly varying in range from human to more grotesque configurations, are unknown to me. Speculatively, if these types exist, they might have their origins in other solar systems or have roots on different planets within one solar system. 21. I know of the names of two major medical centers in the eastern United States where continuing specialized intensive research is conducted on deceased alien bodies. Other hospitals where research reportedly has been conducted are in Indiana, Illinois, Texas, Southeastern and Western U.S.A. SUMMARY: It is beyond the scope of this paper to treat all the stories and rumors of stories still emerging to this writer, each alleging the occurrence of a UFO crash, with or without occupants, and its subsequent hush-hush military retrieval. As of July 20, 1978, for the record, I am aware of more than 50 sources who bear information relative to the subject of retrievals or storage of alien craft, and/or the deceased alien humanoids recovered from the craft. From this number, I have selected 18 of these sources whose testimony is reviewed in this paper. Most others lack sufficient data and a few have 'dried up,' so to speak, out of fear of military reprisal or public ridicule. Stories of long ago and as recently as 1977 clearly show that the U.S.A. is not the only territory in the world where UFOs and crews err in their tactical mission and crash to meet their doom. On foreign soil, we have a number of reported crashes. One allegedly occurred on the island of Spitzbergen in 1952, which was secretly recovered by Norwegian military authorities. Another UFO crash and retrieval report was contained in a special dispatch from the late columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, datelined May 23, 1955, London, England, INS, as follows."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" May 23, 1955 news report from Dorothy Kilgallen, London, England: \"British scientists and airmen, after examining the wreckage of one mysterious flying ship, are convinced that these strange aerial objects are flying saucers from another planet. The source of my information is a British official of Cabinet rank. He told me: 'We believe, on the basis of our inquiries thus far, that the saucers were staffed by small men - probably under four feet. It's frightening, but there's no denying that flying saucers are from another planet.' This official quoted scientists as saying a flying ship of this type could not have been constructed on Earth. The British Government, I learned, is withholding an official report on the flying saucer examination at this time, possibly because it does not want to frighten the public.\" Still other foreign reports in the past and of recent times tell of objects falling to Earth looking like fireballs, of objects exploding on impact. Many crashes have conventional explanations, but others do not, such as the circular craft that allegedly crashed in Nauta, Peru, on November 11, 1975. This object, according to Robert Barry, measured 12 feet, eight inches in diameter, which featured a strange metallic coating. Other reported crashes have occurred in Australia, May 1976; in Mexico, August 1977; and in Bolivia, May 1978. One report of a UFO crash, with recovered humanoid occupants, stands out above the others. Occurring in 1953, a hundred miles outside of Johannesburg, South Africa, the incident prompted investigation by a U. S. Air Force General. Larry Moyers, MUFON State Director of Ohio, uncovered the case and I recently had it confirmed from an Intelligence source. Perhaps the most significant of the reported foreign UFO crashes are those in the Communist world. My informant, Robert Barry, has learned from a reliable Intelligence source that Red China has two 'downed' UFOs, one of which landed in water without occupants; and two, possibly three, crashes and retrievals in Russia. In the U. S., reports of UFO crash and retrievals continue through the 1970s. One recent incident, for example, not yet substantiated, came to light from reliable sources not to be named at this time as our search for data continues. This incident, allegedly occurring in the Spring of 1977 in a rural area of southwestern Ohio, involved a landed craft, perhaps disabled, and a number of its occupants who engaged a military unit dispatched to the scene. Whatever happened during this Encounter of Third Kind, the sketchy data we have thus far, suggests violence. Reportedly, eleven members of the U. S. military detachment were either injured or killed. There was no word of alien casualties. The story is tr aceable through a handful of qualified researchers, then it stops at a dead end. Unreachable is a medical specialist supposedly called in by the military authorities to perform his expertise. In the Fall of 1977, I was approached by a Cincinnati researcher and told that he had learned from a source who worked at Wright-Patterson that in the Spring of 1977, military personnel had carried into a certain area on the base, several litters with little alien bodies from an undisclosed location. Perhaps in time, new data might appear to give credence to one or both of these possibly connected stories. Indeed, a pitched land battle between U. S. military and alien forces seems more like fantasy. But if true, then it would be reasonable to assume that the secrecy lid would come down hard on it! The effects from such a disclosure would certainly create more than a 'cultural shock.'\" ontinued in Part 6 - Drawings Exhibits A and B of alien head and hand.
