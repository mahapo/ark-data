April 9, 2007 Corpus Christi, Texas - Texas has had repeating cycles of cat and other animal mutilations for at least sixteen years. In Plano, Texas, an affluent suburb north of Dallas, in 1991 and 1993, police received dozens of reports about cats found cut in half, usually with the front half near the owners' yards or sidewalks. Plano Police Detective Mike Box also had missing reports on more than 80 domestic house cats that wore collars and identification tags, but were never found. Detective Box investigated satanic cult activities, but could not find any evidence that connected them to the mutilated and missing cats and other animals such as dogs. Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officer for Incident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991. In Sandia northwest of Corpus Christi on January 5, 2005, James Lund was traveling with his nephew, Chris. Mr. Lund owns a direct satellite installation company called Exodus Communications Co. and was making repairs. The men were on Route 359 just south of Sandia when Chris noticed a cow down in the pasture about 150 yards from the road dead and mutilated. Now in the south side of Corpus Christi since November 2006, half a dozen cats have been cut open, organs removed and/or head and paw excised - all without blood. New report in interview below. Background Twenty-seven years before in 1978 in St. Catharines near Toronto, Canada, authorities were frustrated by more than 100 missing cats and dogs and many others found in their owners' yards skinned, decapitated, disemboweled, cut in half or paws removed, without blood at the site. Ten years later on August 13, 1989, The New York Times reported about 67 cats found mutilated in Tustin, California - a suburb of Los Angeles near Santa Ana. The NYT wrote: \"Some of the cats were cut in half with what some say is almost surgical "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"precision, others disemboweled or skinned. One resident said, 'There is never any blood at the scene, the animals are often dismembered with surgical precision and paws and other body parts are often left on the ground in strikingly similar arrangements. No one ever seems to hear anything, nor do dogs bark during the killing.' It was believed the cats are captured, taken elsewhere, their blood drained and organs removed, then replaced on their owners' lawns.\" By 1992-1993, dozens of half cats had been discovered in Vancouver, British Columbia, and taken to the animal control office there for examination. Usually the front half was found on the owner's lawn. The Supervisor of Animal Control for the Vancouver City Pound told reporters, \"The cats are clearly being butchered by someone. It's a real surgical job. And all I hope is that these cats were already dead when they were cut in half.\" At the time during those rash of cat mutilations in Vancouver, I was working with pathologist and hematologist John Altshuler, M. D., in Denver, Colorado. We were able to obtain one of the half cats - the front half - for analysis of the abdominal excision. Dr. Altshuler confirmed that the entire excision had been cut with something hot enough to cook the collagen and hemoglobin. [ See Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 in Earthfiles Shop .] Similar waves of cat, and half cat, mutilations have been reported throughout the world since at least the 1970s. The following are some of the locations where small animal mutilations have occurred - some with cyclic incidents every few years: London, England; Toronto and Vancouver, Canada; Ft. Worth, Austin, Plano, and Corpus Christi, Texas; Seattle, Bothel and Bellingham, Washington; Falls Church, Virginia; Pensacola, Florida; Lee, New York; Los Alamos, New Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Tustin, San Jose and San Diego, California; Denver and Aurora, Colorado; and Salt Lake City, Utah. Mutilated Cat Headlines At Earthfiles August 15, 1995 Toronto, Ontario, Canada - A series of cat mutilations occurred in Toronto. There were no arrests. Across the continent in Vancouver, B. C. in May to June, 1992, several half cats were found without finding the culprit or culprits. Further back in 1978, authorities in St. Catharines near Toronto were also frustrated by more than one hundred missing cats and dogs and others found skinned and badly mutilated. In each of these mutilation cycles, many of the animals have been found cut in half bloodlessly, usually with the front half of the cat placed to be found. These facts have convinced many investigators that the animals are taken some place, killed and cut, and then returned to yards and sidewalks near their owner's homes. June 14, 1999 Tucscon, Arizona - The Arizona Daily Star reported that the Humane Society of Tucson and Pima County Animal Control were investigating a rash of cat mutilations in March and June. In March, six cats were found with their back paws cut off. Humane Society Education Director, Marsh Myers, said, \"With the original (March) cat mutilations, we were seeing that the animals had (parts of) hind legs removed. What we're seeing now is a new type of mutilation in which cats are cut down the center from the throat to the pubic area. The rib cage is spread and then the organs are either removed or tied around the animal.\" One cat owner, Dennis Tulino, lost one of his eight cats and found another injured. Elvis was found across the street from Tulino's home. His throat was slit, the rib cage opened, but there was no blood. At about the same time, another Tulino cat, Sonic, was found with one of its back legs injured by an unknown attacker. Tucson Police Sergeant Brett Klein said, \"(The reports) have been so disjointed. They have been anywhere from the east side to west side of town. There's nothing to pinpoint. I haven't really seen enough of a trend to tell people to keep their cats in.\" August 13, 1999 Toronto, Ontario, Canada -The Toronto cases, which have included bloodless decapitations, were the subject of a Toronto Sun news report on August 13, 1999. Under the headline \"More cats slain in Willowdale,\" reporter Joe Warmington wrote: \"The mysterious death and mutilation of three more cats in North York (August 12, 1999) has animal cruelty investigators on alert for a potential serial cat killer. (These new deaths) come just weeks after five other cats were reported killed and mutilated in the Leslie Street and Finch Avenue area. \"The way they were cut and the fact there wasn't a trail of blood leads investigators to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"discount a predator - like a fox - is responsible for the killings. As many as fifteen cats in the vicinity of Finch Avenue have also been reported missing in the last year.\" Debby Hunt, Inspector of the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Warmington, \"If somebody is deliberately doing this, they could face a $2,000 fine and six months in jail.\" Hunt has appealed to the public to come forward with information. September 15, 1999 San Jose, California - Since May 1999, in San Jose, California, two dozen cats, a raccoon and a rat have been found disemboweled, cut in half and oddly skinned. The San Jose Mercury newspaper headlined \"Cat killer men aces southern San Jose.\" The article began, \"A killer is stalking the cats of southern San Jose, mutilating 21 felines since May 31 - primarily pets taken from owners' yards at night and returned dead, often dismembered and skinned.\" More than 2,000 fliers were distributed by police into south San Jose neighborhoods warning owners to keep their cats indoors. And the Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley posted a cash reward that has kept growing as animals have been discovered. October 3, 1999 London, England - Over the past year, the London Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has received dozens of reports from residents who have found on their sidewalks or front yards their cats and rabbits disemboweled, cut in half and even decapitated. And usually without blood at the site October 10, 1999 Fort Worth, Texas - WFAA-TV in Fort Worth, Texas reported on October 7th the discovery of five mutilated cats in Tarrant County, Texas since June. These unusual cat deaths have been found in West Fort Worth near Interstate 30 between Forest Park Boulevard and Cherry Lane. Humane Society investigators say what happened was not an accident, but calculated cruelty by at least one individual. The strange deaths have included a hanging, a cat that had been skinned, and another that had its tail sliced in two halves down its length. FBI behavioral scientists warn that many serial killers start out venting anger on cats and take pleasure in cat torture. But so far, law enforcement does not have any suspects and Fort Worth residents are urged to keep their pets inside. Over the same time period, bloodlessly decapitated and mutilated cats have been found in San Jose, California (See: 10/3/99); London, England (See: 8/25/99); and Toronto, Canada. Other cases involving excisions of paws and/or back leg from cats in Tucson, Arizona occurred back in March and June 1999. November 5, 1999 Toronto, Canada - A $60,000 reward has been offered by the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for information about ten mutilated cats since the current mystery began in August 1999. The reward offer has generated phone calls, but no suspects. The SPCA's lead inspector, Debbie Hunt, is now seeking help from the Toronto Police: \"We don't have the resources or enough experience in profiling criminals.\" Inspector Tony Warr, recent chief investigator in a Toronto bedroom rapist case, will head a new behavioral assessment unit. Their focus will be serial killers, and presumably an international ring of them since similar cat mutilations have been occurring in London, England, San Jose, California, Ft. Worth, Texas and Ontario, Canada at the same time in 1999. Hunt has photographs of the current Ontario mutilated cats, many of them precisely and bloodlessly cut in half. One is an orange and white cat, collar still attached. There is a wound above the cat's eye and some bruising around the neck where odd punctures in the throat have been found in some of the mutilated animals. The abdomen was severed in half with a \"razor-straight cut.\" Only the front half remained with all its organs intact. Debbie Hunt told reporters, \"It's like a band saw or a very sharp knife is doing this. Wild animals aren't. (Otherwise) the liver, the lungs and the organs would be strewn about.\" Further, the half cats are left near schoolyards or on well-lit street corners as if purposely laid out to be found. Ms. Hunt told me, \"We're talking to some pathologists about the nature of the cuts and have been sworn to secrecy on some things.\" In the past two weeks, the case number climbed from seven to ten as three more mutilated cats were found beyond North York, a Toronto suburb where the first animal was discovered on August 12th. Those three new cases included a cat body found in Mississauga, a community west of Toronto. Another was located in Parry Sound approximately 100 miles directly north of Toronto. Another recent mutilation was in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario at the western edge of the Ontario province. August 12, 2001 Navarre, Florida and Austin, Texas -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"P attie and John Goodfleisch hold their surviving white female cat, Kitty, after they found their other black male cat, Maximum, cut in half on Saturday, June 30, 2001. Photograph © 2001 by Daily News , Milton, Florida. On Saturday, June 30, in the small beach town of Navarre, Florida about fifteen miles east of Pensacola a cat was found strangely cut up near its home. The owners, John and Pattie Goodfleisch, had two cats: one female all white and the other male all black. On that Saturday morning, after the couple had let the cats out and awaited their return, the black male cat did not come back. The couple began searching and found the cat's severed front body on a sandy path near their house. He had been sliced from just behind his front legs all the way back to his tail bone. The missing half was never found. The Tiger Point Animal Hospital was asked to do a necropsy to determine cause of death. The veterinarian said the wound did not appear to be accidental and the assumption was that a human with specific intent had cut the cat lengthwise and removed one half. Austin, Texas Further west, northwestern Austin, Texas law enforcement are investigating a dozen incidents since March 2001 in which the head, neck and front legs of domestic cats have been severed bloodlessly through the spine by a sharp instrument and most of the internal organs, rib cage and spine removed. Since March at least a dozen cats have been found cut in half behind their front legs in the northwestern residential area of Austin, Texas. The internal organs and spine sections are cleanly severed, but there is very little if any blood at the scene and no signs of struggle, leading investigators to speculate that the cats are being cut up somewhere else and then returned to their home vicinity. The Austin Police Department and the Travis County Sheriff's Office have been investigating and a large monetary reward has been offered for any information about the perpetrators. Currently, there are no current suspects and law enforcement officials are baffled. October 20, 2001 Ocean Beach, California - Since September at least a dozen domestic and wild cats around the Naval Air Station in Point Loma or a neighborhood in Ocean Beach have been found cut in half, similar to the Austin, Texas cases, or completely eviscerated by a clean, bloodless excision in the belly from which all internal organs were removed. One of the cat owners talked to me this weekend about her loss. Alicia Baskette is an attorney who specializes in workers compensation insurance defense. She and her husband were shocked when they found only the front half of their dead 10-year-old male cat across the street on Monday, September 10. May 31, 2002 Bellingham, Washington and Austin, Texas - In the week between Thursday, May 16 and Thursday, May 23, 2002, four domestic cats were found in the Fairhaven district of Bellingham slit from the throat to the pelvis. But there was no blood on the fur or the ground. Bellingham Police Lt. Dac Jamison said, \"There is methodology to what's going on.\" The speculation is that the cats are some how removed from their home or neighborhood, taken somewhere for the cut and excision of internal organs, and returned close to their homes. This week I asked the head of the Whatcom Humane Society in Bellingham if she knew about previous cat mutilations in 1993 north of her in Vancouver (See More Information below) or the current rounds of other cat mutilations in Austin and San Diego. She had no knowledge of the other cases, but explained to me some of the details about what has happened in the Bellingham cases. Austin, Texas"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"At the same time in Austin, Texas, the number of mutilated cats since March 2001 climbed to 25 when residents near the 7900 block of Stone Cliff found one dead cat on May 12 and another on May 16. The Austin Police Department has taken over the investigation and are only saying the cats were cut in a \"meticulous and precise way. No blood.\" Other recent unusual cat deaths have also surfaced in San Diego. November 16, 2002 Aurora, Colorado - According to the Aurora Animal Control Office, the Denver Dumb Friends League, and local residents, between June and mid-November 2002, ten cats and other small animals such as rabbits and squirrels have been found strangely cut up without blood or signs of struggle. (9 cats, 2 squirrels and 1 rabbit in Aurora; 1 cat and 1 rabbit in Denver). The region affected has been where southwest Aurora and southeastern Denver come together between the University of Denver and the Aurora Medical Center. One investigator who wishes to remain anonymous told me, \"Very precise cuts. Some are just cut in half, like with a band saw or very sharp knife or something like that. Just cut in half and either the front half or the back half is left to be found. Others have only flesh removed from the abdomen area, or a few organs removed, or all organs removed. A few have had just the spine removed in a very precise way. Usually there is no blood. There have been at least two other cycles of cat mutilations here since 1990.\" So far, officials are not releasing photographs of the mutilated animals. Investigators don't want to encourage copycats and want to preserve evidence details for trial if anyone is arrested. However, the Plano, Texas Police Department's 1993 photograph in More Information below is a good example of what half cats look like wherever found around the world. May 27, 2003 Salt Lake City, Utah - Since May 14, 2002, the Salt Lake County Animal Services in Utah has received nine reports of mutilated cats and one report of a mutilated dog. The May 14th case was a domestic male cat with black short hair. The officer who picked it up thought it might have been attacked by another animal, but the resident who found it thought its throat had been slit. Then on July 2, 2002, another domestic cat with short black and white hair was reported, sex unknown. Ray Kelleher, Staff Sergeant and Senior Officer, who has worked 25 years for the Salt Lake County Animal Services, talked to me about that case and the eight others since that have all been found in a six block radius \"in the Avenues\" of northeastern Salt Lake City. Salt Lake City, Utah Animal Mutilation Cases Reported Between July 2, 2002 and May 22, 2003: 1) May 14, 2002, cat. 2) July 2, 2002, cat. 3) July 17, 2002, cat. 4) July 18, 2002, cat. 5) July 21, 2002, cat. 6) July 25, 2002, cat. 7) October 17, 2002, dog. 8) Oct. 28, 2002, cat. 9) November 7, 2002, cat. 10) April 23, 2003, cat. July 1, 2003 Denver and Aurora, Colorado - The Denver Dumb Friends League is offering a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone found responsible for the small animal mutilations in the greater Denver area over the past year. One investigator who wished to remain anonymous told me, \"Very precise cuts. Some are just cut in half, like with a band saw or very sharp knife or something like that.

Twelve miles northeast of Seattle, Bothell is a city of 32,985 people, 23 parks and the Bothell Police Department has case files on three cat mutilations in May and June 2002, and three cat mutilations between August 1 and September 1, 2003. Not far to the northwest, Animal Control for the Vancouver, B. C. City Pound filed several mutilation reports in 1992 to 1994 on domestic cats found neatly cut in half without blood. Two of the 2003 Bothell cats were cut up into thirds and the middle part taken. The cat body portions left behind show on x-rays that all internal organs are missing except for the bladder, all without any blood on the animal or in the owner's or neighbor's yards where the dead cats have been discovered. Salt Lake City, Utah Over the past several months in Salt Lake City, Utah, a dozen cats have also been found cut up the same bloodless way. In Denver, Colorado, more than forty small animals have been mutilated over the past couple of years and the Denver Dumb Friends League is offering a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone found responsible. In Bothell, Washington, a non-profit group known as Pasado Safe Haven now has a $5,000 reward there. In addition to Bothell, Vancouver, Denver, and Salt Lake City, hundreds of other cat mutilations over the years have been reported in Falls Church, Virginia; Lee, New York; Los Alamos, New Mexico; Ahwatakee Foothills, Arizona; Plano and Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Navarre and Pensacola, Florida; Tustin, San Diego and San Jose, California, London, England, and Toronto, Canada.

Now it's happening again in Bothell, Washington, and so far all the victims have been males. The first case was reported the first week of August and the most recent was found September 1st. This week I talked with a veterinarian there who has examined the three mutilated cats in the past four weeks. She is Cherie Good, D.V.M., who runs The Cat Clinic at Canyon Park in Bothell. She received her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Oklahoma State University in 1995 and has been practicing in the Bothell area since then, now exclusively for cats. January 15, 2005 Sandia, Texas near Corpus Christi - I have investigated the phenomenon of animal mutilations since 1979 and before he died, U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso told me that he had seen with his own eyes, during his work for the Eisenhower and Kennedy Administrations, highly classified documents about unusual and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"bloodless animal deaths around the world dated as early as 1951. That would be only four years after the Roswell, New Mexico, headlines about an unidentified flying disc that had crashed near Corona. In the early 1990s, documents were leaked about a small group called Majestic 12, allegedly appointed by President Harry S. Truman to study the \"interplanetary\" mystery. At that 1947 Corona, New Mexico, UFO crash site, bodies were allegedly found \"dissected as you would a frog.\" But the documents do not make clear if the dissected bodies were animals, humans or non-humans. Another document says that at another 1947 UFO crash site on the White Sands Missile Proving Ground, \"Animal parts were reportedly discovered inside the craft.\" If the U. S. government has linked extraterrestrial biological entities to the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon since at least 1947, the fact that the mutilations continue to occur to this day means that the government has no control over the mutilators.

But there was no blood on the fur or the ground. Bellingham Police Lt. Dac Jamison said, \"There is methodology to what's going on.\" The speculation was that the cats were some how removed from their home or neighborhood, taken somewhere for the cut and excision of internal organs, and returned close to their homes. Now it's happening again in Seattle and the surrounding region, including Oak Harbor. Oak Harbor is a town of about 19,000 people, of which 6,000 work for the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station and Ault Field. Whidbey Island is the longest island in the continental United States and is surrounded by the waters of Puget Sound. By car, Oak Harbor is about 1.5 hours north of Seattle and two hours south of Vancouver, British Columbia. I talked with Oak Harbor's Animal Control Officer, Terry Sampson, this week who confirmed his office has seven half cat cases. There were three more this past weekend in Anacortes and several more in Burlington, Mt. Vernon and Seattle. He said that he and the other city animal control officers are convinced the culprits are coyotes. But when I talked to one Oak Harbor resident who found only the upper half of her cat, she rejected the coyote explanation. She did not want to comment for radio, but she told me where her half cat laid in the grass was \"quite tidy.\" She compared the cat's upper half to a \"glove puppet,\" meaning it resembled a child's puppet toy that is empty inside and fits over a hand. Another Oak Harbor resident is Betty Gable who drives buses in the city. One of the half cats belonged to her neighbor who was out of town. So Betty took responsibility to get the cat remains to Oak Harbor Animal Control for investigation. Authorities there told Betty it was coyote, that all the half cat kills were by coyotes. August 13, 2005 Seattle, Washington - The Federal Way Police and King County Animal control in Seattle, Washington, confirmed they have in their recent animal mutilation files three cats and one dog since May 2005, bringing the total in the greater Seattle/Oak Harbor/Anacortes/Burlington/Mt. Vernon region to at least fourteen. The most recent were two cat victims in August. Federal Way Police and King County Animal Control are putting the word out to pet owners to \"keep your critters safe following a rash of mutilations. Three victims were cats. A small dog was also mutilated. Animal Control is investigating the attacks. Officials said the attacks occurred within South 320th Street to the south, First Way South to the west, Southwest Dash Point Road to the north and Pacific Highway South to the east.\" August 22, 2005 San Jose, California - On August 16, 2005, I received the following email from Thomas G. Holford, a San Jose, California resident: (Photos in yard)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"C at cut in half, laying in front yard of south San Jose, California, home, discovered on August 16, 2005. Images provided to Earthfiles by Thomas G. Holford. \"Linda: Today, August 16, 2005, about 4:00 PM, I was walking in a residential neighborhood in south San Jose, California, when I noticed the remains of an orange cat, in two pieces, on the front lawn of a home. I was on my way to a business meeting, but stopped long enough to snap some pictures. Attached are digital photos of the scene. On my way to the meeting, I stopped at an animal clinic and reported the incident to the staff, and they indicated that they would call animal control. Ten minutes later, I phoned the clinic and suggested that they might call the police and have the police secure the area. The clinic reported that they had called animal control, and that animal control was on their way to the site. In my quick observation of the carcass, I did not observe any blood, which suggested that the carcass may have been dropped there after the cat had been killed. Also, the fur of the cat seems to have been rather mussed up and \"ungroomed\". This incident is particularly significant since San Jose had been the location of cat mutilations several years back. [ See 100399 Earthfiles. ] As a probably unrelated, but possibly bizarre sidelight to this incident, the house on whose front yard the cat carcass was found was the site of a suicide several years ago. One might speculate that cultists of some sort were somehow linking the cat death to a known \"death house.\" But this may be giving cultists to much credit for record keeping and planning.

Another half cat has been reported in San Antonio, Texas, by resident Robert Casell, a customer care representative for Malin Integrated Handling Solutions and Design (forklift manufacturer). Mr. Casell also worked as a policeman in Los Angeles before moving to San Antonio where he and his family have lived for nine years in a well-established neighborhood. Nothing dramatic had ever happened around the Casell residence until the early morning of Monday, October 17, 2005. June 28, 2006 Destin, Florida - Exactly five years ago in June 2001, cat mutilations were reported in Navarre, Florida, and Austin, Texas. Navarre is southwest of Eglin AFB in the Florida panhandle. Now in the spring of May 2006 in Destin, Florida, only a few miles east of Navarre, another round of half cat mutilations have been reported since early April, especially along Holly Street. Tony Tenore found his cat cut in half on his front yard lawn. Half a dozen other neighbors have found mutilated cats in their yards. And at the end of May, Henry Boenning, who lives only a couple of doors from Tony Tenore, found his 16-year-old cat gutted without blood. August 23, 2006 Spokane, Washington - In the Spokane region for the sixth summer in a row, cats have been found cut in half without blood or signs of struggle. One of the animal groups in Spokane is SpokAnimal CARE. That agency reports there have been at least nine half cats in August; either the back half or front half remain. Six of those were found around Joe Albi Stadium. Veterinarians reported that the cuts were \"very clean\" without tears and are not the work of coyotes. The latest cat was found on the 5600 block of North Elgin Street. In this case, it was the front half of the cat that was found. There was no blood anywhere in, or near, the bodies. Authorities say the cats seem to have been “strategically and methodically placed where they were found.” SpokAnimal told reporters on August 23, it wants to have a veterinarian from outside the Spokane region examine the dead cats' bones to determine if the \"cats were torn apart by animals, or whether they were cut by instruments\" of some kind. SpokAnimal is dubious that natural predators are to blame. The agency is offering a $2,500 reward from its animal cruelty fund. SpokAnimal also reported that half cats are also being found in western Canada. Investigators from Spokane and Canada are comparing notes about the unusual half cat deaths in the two countries. Officials are very concerned about the violent nature of the bloodless acts and recommend that cat owners keep their pets indoors until the animal mutilator is caught. Anyone with information about who might be killing the cats are asked to contact SpokAnimal CARE at 509-534-8133, or contact an Animal Protection Officer.

November 2006 - April 2, 2007 Corpus Christi, Texas C orpus Christi, on the Gulf of Mexico, is 120 miles southeast of San Antonio. Both regions have had cat and cattle mutilations, as indicated by the yellow regions on the map. On Monday evening, April 2, 2007, residents from the south side of Corpus Christi, Texas – especially those living on Stonemill Circle – met with a Corpus Christi Police Department representative to discuss the sad and disturbing mystery affecting their neighborhood since early November 2006 – the mutilation of house cats. Like so many other previous incidents of this terrible earth mystery, the cats are found sliced bloodlessly in a variety of patterns and laid out in their owner’s yard with no tracks or signs of struggle. One of the Stonemill Circle residents, Cindy Kurtz, lives near two homes next door to each other where dead and mutilated cats were found between March 29 and April 2, 2007. Interview: Cindy Kurtz, Stonemill Circle resident, Corpus Christi, Texas: \"It’s happened in several places around our neighborhood, but nobody ever reported it. Now, when it happened again last Wednesday night (March 27), it was found Thursday morning (March 28, 2007). It’s very sad. I mean, everybody knew this cat. It was a really cute little cat. He was grey and white and always had his collar on and little bell. When he was found on Thursday morning, all I can tell you is that he was cut down the middle. His insides were gutted and he was put back in the person’s yard with its little collar next to it. WAS THE CAT CUT FROM THE NECK DOWN TO THE PUBIC BONE? Ye s . THE WHOLE CAT WAS RETURNED TO THE OWNER’S YARD WITH ALL OF THE INTERNAL ORGANS REMOVED? Yes, and there was no blood found anywhere in the vicinity, so whoever it was, took it away and did it and brought it back. DID THE POLICE COME AND HAS A VETERINARIAN DONE A NECROPSY ON THAT CAT? Yes. They did do it and he (vet) said whoever did it – the police did come. They called the police and the police came. They really didn’t want to speculate on what this was because this was the first report given to them (police) and I think they just started getting other"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"reports after the fact. They did take it to a vet and the vet said it was done by somebody who knew what they were doing. SURGICAL? Ye s . WITH NO BLOOD. None. AND PRECISE EXCISIONS OF ORGANS FROM INSIDE THE CAT. Ye s . AND IN THIS CAT, OR ANOTHER CAT, WAS THE HEAD AND/OR PAW REMOVED? Yes, the one that was Sunday night (April 1), that cat was decapitated and a paw was cut off. And then the very first one was the beginning of November, and that one was gutted. SO IT WAS VERY SIMILAR TO THE CAT WITH THE BELL? Ye s . AND THE ONE IN NOVEMBER, COULD YOU EXPLAIN AGAIN WHAT HAPPENED TO IT? Same thing – the owners found it in their front yard. It was gutted. Same excision. ORGANS? Organs removed and put back in their front yard. AND NO BLOOD? No blood. SO THREE ON YOUR STREET AND POSSIBLY FOUR OTHERS IN ... Areas around our neighborhood, yes. HAVE YOU HEARD ANY RUMORS ABOUT HEADS OR PAWS BEING REMOVED ON ANY OF THOSE OTHERS? No, I haven’t. IN THE CAT THAT HAD THE HEAD AND PAW REMOVED, WHERE WAS THAT YARD IN COMPARISON THE CAT THAT HAD THE BELL? Next door. SO, THE TWO WERE RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO EACH OTHER? Ye s . WITHIN LESS THAN A WEEK? Ye s . Neighborhood and Police Meeting, Monday, April 2, 2007 CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE MEETING WITH POLICE? It was Monday night (April 2, 2007). We had a man from the police department there talking to us, telling us what we can do to protect ourselves and our animals and the best thing is to keep your animals inside. The neighborhood has taken our own measures, like my husband and I put up a video camera. We already have an alarm. And several people on the street – I know that one has already gotten a video camera. So, it’s us and somebody else has already gotten their video cameras and I know of three other people I think are going to get them."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"There were two television stations there, so we asked about the Satanic thing and he (police officer) really didn’t say much and when the television stations left, he said he didn’t want to say anything about it. He never really got into it, to tell you the truth, because he said the media will take it and run with it and we don’t know if that’s what it is. EXACTLY. And it was basically like a Neighbors On Watch meeting. We told him what our fears were. DID THE POLICE HAVE A VETERINARIAN THERE TO TALK WITH YOU ALL? No, he did not. BUT DID HE TALK ABOUT WHAT THE VETERINARIAN HAS FOUND SO FAR? One of the women told everybody what the veterinarian had found. WHICH WAS? That it was done by somebody who knew what they were doing. It was done precisely. It was done like surgically. AND THAT WOULD EXCLUDE ANY NATURAL PREDATORS? Yes. (laughs) The police tried to say it could be a coyote. Well, for one thing, we’re kind of in the middle of town. (laughs) And I know in Texas there are a lot of coyotes, but I can’t see a coyote in this neighborhood! Another thing, and I told the police officer, that’s kind of insulting because we’re not stupid and a coyote can’t do that (precise surgical cuts) to another animal (cat) like that. But I know the police need more information. People need to start turning this stuff in and they said it on TV several times – if something happens to your pet, you’ve got to tell us. We don’t have much to go on because people aren’t turning these things in! We need to know. HOW ARE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND GOING TO USE YOUR VIDEO CAMERA FOR SURVEILLANCE? We put it up on our house right by our driveway. We live right at the end of our cul de sac, so we can get a pretty good view of what’s going on. And we’re recording it, recording everything. And it’s got infrared on it so it can record at night, too. And I’m going around getting car license numbers and everybody will have that information, so if there is something fishy going on our street, we’ll all know.\" I f anyone has more information about the cat mutilations in Corpus Christi, please contact Crime Stoppers at 361-888-8477 or the Corpus Christi Police Department: 361-886-2876.
