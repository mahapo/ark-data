Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist R eturn to Part 1 December 29, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda Moulton Howe's May 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston, Te x a s , h o m e : “D O YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE BOTTOM OF THE BIG DISC CRAFT LOOKED LIKE THAT CAME DOWN IN THE NEVADA DESERT IN 1964? It was a big oval on the bottom and on the top. WHAT THE SURFACE LIKE? Bright silver-colored metal, looked sort of like bright stainless steel. THAT SOUNDS SOLID. HOW DID THE MILITARY AND SCIENTISTS LOOK INTO THE TOP PART AND SEE THREE MORE HUMANOID BODIES AS YOU DESCRIBED? The Edwards AFB people said that there were little slits up there in a narrow rise only about 8 or 10 inches high atop the disc. It was through the slits they could shine lights and saw three humanoids sitting inside at what looked like an operating console. LIKE THE HUMANOIDS WERE IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION? OR WERE THEY MOVING? They were just sitting there, so they would have to have been in suspended animation like the other ones that laid down in the desert, I guess. Everyone had a hard time with that concept because no one thought that could be done to a human being. We've got to feed all our tissues or they will die. What was feeding those beings inside the top of the disc and those that laid down on the ground? DID YOU CLIMB UP TO LOOK THROUGH THE CRACK AT THE BEINGS YOURSELF? No. Davis was the guy who was up there and he came down and told me, ‘There are three guys sitting there as still as those other three men who laid down on the ground. Identical to them.’ Davis and another guy named David were both scientists and they knew more about the non-human phenomenon than anyone on Earth, I think. From my point of view, those three on the ground had the same shape, same form, same everything, but with some differences that you could tell them apart. DID THE HUMANOIDS BREATHE? No, they didn't breathe at all. HEART BEAT? No heart beat. YET, THOSE BEINGS COULD GET UP AND MOVE? I think they were robots, controlled by some distant planet or spacecraft or something, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"because those bodies in suspended animation could be brought back to life in an instant and probably put the big disc right back into service. I don't know why that didn't happen. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARRIVED AND WENT INTO SUSPENDED ANIMATION? None of the people I knew at Edwards AFB found out. I think they are still trying to find out. The last grilling I took with the space agency was that the space agency set up a department to investigate spacecraft and things like flying saucers. ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NASA? Ye s . DID DAVIS AND DAVID WORK FOR NASA? I never did find out who exactly they worked for because I was introduced to a lot of professors and doctors from universities all over the United States trying to study the disc and the humanoids. WHEN YOU WERE CALLED IN FROM CHICAGO TO SEE THE BODIES AND SPACECRAFT, WHAT DID THE AUTHORITIES WANT YOU TO DO? They put it to me this way: ‘Were those bodies burned?’ I said, ‘No.’ ‘Was there any nuclear radiation around the craft that would hurt military or scientists who walked around it?’ I got two scintillators that I had designed and built myself to test for radiation. And we could not find any form of radiation there whatsoever. WHAT ELSE DID THE AUTHORITIES WANT YOU TO DO? They wanted me to look at the craft and see if I could determine what was causing it to travel at the immense speed it had traveled and how could it turn on a 90-degree angle at those very high speeds. SO THE MILITARY HAD TRACKED THE CRAFT ON RADAR? Well, they had some radar images that showed craft doing such maneuvers, but not the specific disc that came down in the Nevada desert that the humanoids came out of and laid down on the ground. DID DAVID OR DAVIS TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BODIES AND CRAFT WERE PUT THERE DELIBERATELY FOR HUMANS TO TEST AND EXAMINE? No. Those scientists told me the humanoids were there to protect that spacecraft. David and Davis thought those beings could be deactivated at any moment and that we don't know what their potential damage might be as far as energy is concerned. What if the humanoids could reduce a tank to dust if they were ordered to? SO EDWARDS AFB AND OTHERS WERE WORRIED ABOUT A TECHNOLOGICAL AT TA C K ? Right. They didn't know what the devil - if these humanoids landed there, why hadn't they made contact other than laying those three guys down on the ground? DID ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT THE U. S. HAS OTHER NON-HUMAN BODIES AND CRAFT THAT LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE DISC AND ITS HUMANOIDS THAT YOU SAW? Yeah, I heard that, but I haven't seen other craft and bodies. I do remember them talking about other alien beings that had Chinese-looking eyes, slanted, and had no ears, no holes for a nose and not much of a mouth. I wondered if those robots laying there might not even need the mouths they had! I don't know. Maybe cosmetic camouflage? LET'S GO BACK TO 1964 WHEN YOU WERE IN THE NEVADA DESERT FIRST. WHAT HAPPENED? Well, I was told the disc was going to be moved to Edwards AFB for further research. But then everyone realized it would not fit in the hangars there, which were not large enough to fit around the big disc. HOW LARGE WAS THE CRAFT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The disc was about twice the width of our biggest bombers at the time - at least as long as a football field (100 yards or some 300 feet). So, I was told the disc would be taken to Air Force 5 in southern Nevada and as soon as it was there, they would send for me and I could really test it. I figured I would have a free hand. But when I went down there, I was told, ‘No, don't touch that. Don't do this. Don't do that.’ I said, ‘You told me to come down here and check the thing out. So, why don't you let me do that?’ The military guy said, ‘There are certain things we've already checked and there's no use your looking at them.’ I said, ‘If you already knew, what the hell am I doing down here?’ ‘Well, the thing is that maybe you can discover something we haven't discovered.’ ‘How can I do that if I can't be free to explore and investigate? I would like to look in that window that the scientists looked in and saw those three guys sitting in there. I'd like to see what the instrumentation looks like.’ But for some unknown reason, he wouldn't let me do that. He said it was not necessary and I was not going to beg them to do anything. In fact, I became anxious to get out of there. WHY? It was weird! I mean, what was I doing in there? What business was it of mine to find out what those humanoids were up to? It was up to the military and government to handle that - not up to a civilian scientist like me! DID DAVIS OR DAVID SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LOOKING THROUGH THAT SLIT AND SEEING PANELS WITH HAND PRINTS EMBEDDED IN THE OPERATING CONSOLE? They said they saw a lot of instruments that had knobs on them, but I don't remember about hand prints. They did say that if it were possible to open that craft up ever again and/or those humanoids in there came out or the three on the ground went back in - then the scientists figured those humanoids would take off and that would be the end of that. There was another odd hypothesis - those scientists figured that when those humanoids came down into the Nevada desert, they brought down some transparent individuals with them who are out seeing Earth to find out what's going on here. But we can't see the explorers who control the humanoid robots tending the disc! Those men had more phenomenal theories than anyone in my life! YOU MEAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSPARENT BEINGS MOVING AROUND ON OUR PLANET? Yes. That was a conversation with an Army military intelligence doctor named Graham. He was a real regular fellow, very nice. He did not wear a uniform. He was one of the top men in that military intelligence unit. DID GRAHAM TELL YOU ABOUT ANY OTHER BEINGS AND CRAFT HE HAD SEE N? No, but he said he had gone to 40/11 sites. WHAT DOES 40/11 MEAN? It means sites where spacecraft had landed. I don't know how many. Graham said that out of all of them, he had seen where some had scraped the ground. And two or three others you could see where the craft hit the ground. So, the big disc in the Nevada desert was one of the only ones he had seen that appeared to have actually landed. ANY DISCUSSION WITH HIM ABOUT CRASHED SAUCERS IN NEW MEXICO? No. I asked him about that particularly because I had heard from a guy in Pueblo, Colorado, who said that he and his wife had driven around up there and saw a spacecraft land. I was so intersted, I went to Pueblo to see the husband and he told me, ‘All of a sudden, a big, bright light shown in our car and we could not see anything. Then these ‘people’ came around and whisked us out of the car. I don't know how we got out of the car! We went up some steps and went inside their craft. I couldn't get my bearings. I couldn't tell if I was waling on my side, walking upside down or what.’ Then he said, ‘They set me in a room and put my wife in another compartment. I could see her sitting right there! And those ‘people’ put all kinds of electrodes on our heads, backs"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and stomachs and we were there for about two minutes. Then they took the electrodes off and put us back in our car and we were driving on our way again.’ YOU HEARD THIS AT EDWARDS AFB? Right. Those people in Pueblo reported what happened to someone in the government. Then the government turned around and told them they were lying. I don't know. LET'S GO BACK TO THE CRAFT IN THE NEVADA DESERT. HOW DID THE MILITARY MOVE A 300-FOOT-DIAMETER DISC? I wasn't there to watch, but I know they had to take it around a mountain. HOW DO YOU THINK IT WAS MOVED? The only thing I know is they put the disc on huge roller beds. HOW MUCH OF THE CRAFT DID YOU GET TO TOUCH WITH YOUR HANDS? I touched the bottom and everywhere I could touch, except that slit on top that I wanted to look through and was told I couldn't. WHAT DID THE CRAFT'S SURFACE FEEL LIKE? Like smooth stainless steel, but it wasn't. Any time you take a carbon torch and hit a piece of stainless steel, you've got a mass of molten metal there. But we hit that surface with not only a carbon torch, we put carbon-hydrogen arcs on that thing for hours upon hours and that disc surface never even got red hot! DID YOU EVER LEARN WHAT COULD BE SO RESISTANT? No, that's why the authorities wanted a piece of the craft cut off so they could analyze it. BUT HOW COULD ANYTHING BE CUT OFF FROM METAL THAT CARBON ARCS CAN'T CUT? Well, I don't know, but that's why we were trying to cut it. We knew we could not use saws. I watched one saw just sit there running on the disc's surface like you were polishing with the blades! And we used a diamond saw that never showed a scratch. The military tried to use the latest things they could think of to get into that disc.” C ontinued in Part 3.
