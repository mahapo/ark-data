Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mystery Stalks The Prairie Â© 1976 by Roberta Donovan and Keith Wolverton Chapter 9 Egg-Shaped Craft with Arms s UFO sightings were publicized by the news media in Montana, there was bound to be a number of honest mistakes by individuals who mistook an extremely bright star for a UFO (unidentified flying object). A report of six UFOs near Raynesford turned out to be Venus, Mars and a constellation of stars. What two Great Falls girls thought was a UFO was believed to be a beacon light. A sighting near Fairfield was believed to be another planet. But not all sightings could be explained that easily. In fact, most reports defied explanation. There was the case of the UFO that paced a B-52. It was reported to Sheriff Pete Howard at his office in Choteau. He said a Montana Fish and Game Department employee told of watching a UFO fly above a B-52 as the plane was flying over Freezeout Lake where the man worked. The man said he first saw the B-52 and then noticed another light flying directly over the plane. Using his rifle scope to get a better look, he noted that the strange object seemed to be pacing the B-52. In a short time the UFO climbed out of sight. The B-52 was flying in an easterly direction, he told officers. The same evening, the Cascade County Sheriff's Office had a first hand account of a UFO sighting when Captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson saw one as they were returning to Great Falls from Missoula. If either of the two men had blinked his eyes, he might have missed seeing the strange object as it was traveling so rapidly it was within their range of vision only an estimated four seconds. The dull orange or tan object passed within a quarter of a mile of the front of their car at an elevation of about 500 feet. It was traveling from north to south-southeast. The two officers said it was impossible for them to determine its size or shape in the brief time they saw it. A couple of nights earlier, Malmstrom notified the sheriff's office that two UFOs had been sighted south of Moore in the Lewistown area. The objects appeared as a bright white light with a whitish beam descending toward the ground. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Moore near Lewistown, southeast of Great Falls, where two bright white lights with white beams going to the ground were reported by Malmstrom AFB to the Cascade County Sheriff's Office in Great Falls, Montana in December 1975. About this same time, the Cascade County Sheriff's Office learned that a woman at Stockett had observed a UFO hovering in the sky for a period of from one to two hours. She said it appeared to be a flashing red and white light. Apparently UFOs come in different colors as reports have varied in this respect. Law officers at Chester reported seeing a UFO that had green and blue lights ten miles southwest of that community. A Great Falls man, traveling on the freeway by Ulm, said he and his friends saw a UFO with a red light and a green light. The object appeared stationary. A state official, while traveling one evening, reported seeing UFOs near Fort Benton and north of Carter. He said both of them cast a bluish light. Perhaps one of the most unusual descriptions of a UFO was given to Teton County Sheriff Pete Howard by a ranch couple in that area. They had an excellent opportunity to get a description of the craft as it was about five-eighths of a mile from their house and they watched it through field glasses. They also had the advantage of daylight, since it happened about 4:30 p.m. They described the craft as egg-shaped with the large end on the ground. It had one light which had a dull glow and then became brighter. They described the light as yellowish gold or light orange. The most unusual part of the description was the fact the object had two appendages which came out of it, one on each side. The two arms made a continual motion like a breast stroke. The craft remained stationary for five minutes. then the appendages retracted into the craft and it went straight up and out of sight. The possible connection between UFOs and cattle mutilations again came to the forefront when a Simms rancher reported that his wife and children had seen a UFO land near the place where he had left a dead calf. He later discovered that the carcass had been mutilated after he placed it there. There were actually two UFO landings at the ranch - one on December 8 and one the following night. The second incident was the same night that Captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson sighted a UFO as they were traveling home and the same night that the B-52 was paced by a UFO. The rancher was reluctant at first to talk about the incidents for fear people would think he was \"silly.\" A little later, realizing the seriousness of the situation, he gave officers a full report and encouraged his wife to tell them about the extraordinary happening, too. The calf died about five days earlier. The rancher had dragged it down into a brush area near the Sun River about a half mile from the house. The area was inaccessible by road except by going through the ranch house yard. On the evening of December 8, about 6 or 6:30 p.m., the rancher's wife and children saw a UFO land in the area where the calf's body was. They said it descended from the air, stayed down a short time and then took off in a westerly direction toward Augusta. The woman described the object as a large white light with a red light on top. When it ascended, she said it appeared to roll on its side,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"as the red light was no longer on top, but on the side. As it left, it was flying at a low level. The object, or one like it, returned at almost the exact hour the next evening. This time it stayed only about one minute and instead of heading west, it flew east. Captain Wolverton and two other deputies, after interviewing the woman, examined the dead calf. The bag area had been removed and the cut marks around the wound were consistent with those found in earlier cases that pathologists had verified were made with a very sharp instrument. Samples of the hide were sent to a laboratory for analysis. The rancher verified that there were no marks on the calf when he had last observed it two days before the first landing. He told the officers that he planned to go home from work early, load all his weapons and wait for the \" thing\" to shoot it down. Three deputies returned to the house the evening of December 10, 1975, with photographic equipment so that they would be prepared to get pictures should the UFO make a third landing. They were disappointed because nothing happened. About ten days later another report of a UFO landing came in from the Lewistown area. An Air Force missile crew, traveling between Roy and Fergus northeast of Lewistown late at night, said they saw an object on the ground that was glowing and pulsating. They reported watching it for five to ten minutes. The Fergus County Sheriff's Office at Lewistown was notified and a deputy went out to investigate, but he was unable to find anything. A couple of nights earlier, the Air Force had some hectic moments when an unidentified flying object was sighted over Fairfield and was tracked on radar for about an hour and a half. the oblong-shaped object was first locked in on radar at 8,000 feet. A little later, it was fluctuating between 9,000 and 18,000 feet. A commercial airlines plane flying in the vicinity was contacted by NORAD to see if visual contact could be made, but the pilot was unable to see it. Within a short time, the radar contact was lost, but law officers working in the area could still see the object. Radar contact was again made, locking the object in at 14,100 feet as it moved very slowly in a northwesterly direction. The object was also located by radar equipment at Havre. Air Force officials said the object was in the Power-Fairfield area, but they could not pinpoint it any better. At one point during the tracking, when the UFO was in the Dutton area, radar showed the object suddenly ascending vertically from 14,750 feet to 44,400 feet at 850 knots or approximately 1,000 miles per hour and then stopping suddenly. The maneuver startled military officials and law officers. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Over Dutton, northwest of Great Falls, an unidentified aerial object was tracked on Malmstrom AFB radar ascending vertically from 14,750 feet to 44,400 feet at 850 knots (1000 mph) and then stopping suddenly . A few days later, another Cascade County deputy had an opportunity to see a UFO, as Captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson had. Deputy Barry Michelotti and two friends were on a hunting trip and were camped in the Ford Creek area near Augusta. Describing the incident, Deputy Mitchelotti said: \" We were sleeping in my horse trailer that night with two horses tied to the back of the trailer. About midnight, I was awakened by the horses. They were creating a disturbance, pulling back on the ropes, whinnying and pawing the ground. I looked up and noticed an object that I can describe best as shaped like a football. This object was a solid white light, no flashing, glare or any beams of smoke or light. The object was at least five times as large as a star and was moving horizontally across the sky heading north. \" I woke up one of the other fellows and we watched it for a few short seconds. It was moving at a very rapid speed. After it left our sight, I checked the horses and one was missing. I heard it down the road running. I called and it returned, but it was very nervous which is unusual for that horse. Both horses simmered down and there was no further trouble.\" Captain Wolverton got a second look at a UFO on January 17, 1976, but again it was a brief one. He was driving at dusk on the lower river road just out of Great Falls when he saw an orange or amber- colored light traveling from east to northwest. It was going so fast that he was only able to see it for one or two seconds. He checked with Malmstrom AFB, but they had nothing on radar. Just a week earlier on January 10, a Belt area rancher noticed two red lights over his barn and corral as he was driving home along a country road. It was about 11 p.m. When he reached the approach to his place, he stopped in order to take a closer look at the lights. He noticed the red lights were pulsating and then a bright white light appeared, and beamed toward the ground. The rancher rolled down the window of his vehicle to try to hear whatever it was, but there was no noise coming from the object. The white light went off and the object started to move north. It went a distance, then stopped and the white light came on again. It disappeared shortly thereafter to the north. The rancher described the craft as about 25 to 30 feet wide and said it appeared to be about 500 feet above the ground. He checked his livestock, but they seemed all right and were not restless. The incident made him recall something that had happened a couple of months earlier. During the night, a bright white light lit up the interior of his home,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"waking his son and a friend who had been sleeping with him. The boys told the rancher, who went outside, but was unable to see anything unusual. On the same day - and in fact, the same hour that Captain Wolverton saw his second UFO - a Great Falls man had an unusual experience at his ranch west of Augusta. The man reported that he was outside when he happened to notice out of the corner of his eye a strange object in the sky. He described it as pear-shaped, about the size of a very large light bulb, and was a very bright incandescent color, almost like a ball of fire. He said it was traveling about 60 to 70 feet off the ground in a west to east direction. The object appeared to burn out directly over his yard. \" At the end, pieces seemed to fall off the tail of it and burn up and the whole thing appeared to burn up in the manner that I visualized a large ball from a Roman candle,\" the man told authorities. He said his first reaction was that it was a meteor, but as he thought about it, he decided it would have been dropping to the ground, which this object did not do. He commented that it was odd that the object, while in flight, seemed to maintain the same altitude at all times while he observed it, which was over a distance of approximately 100 yards. A few seconds after the object burned up, the man heard a sonic boom a distance away.
