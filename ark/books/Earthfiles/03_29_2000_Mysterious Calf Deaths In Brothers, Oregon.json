The Millican Valley between Millican and Brothers is where the dozen dead calves were found March 18 and 19, 2000. It's also where fourteen dead calves and a pig with its legs cut off were found in March 1999. The circled X marks the area where eyewitness Dwain Wright saw mutilated bull and where a cowboy described having seen glowing discs that lifted cattle up in glowing beams and dropped them back down through the trees in late 1970s to early 1980s. Brothers, Oregon March 29, 2000 - The high desert area southeast of Bend, Oregon has long been associated with unusual animal deaths known as \"animal mutilations.\" A very active area back in the 1970s and early 1980s was the Pine Mountain area that included Sand Springs and Brothers, Oregon. In the second half of this report, an eyewitness describes animal mutilations in Sand Springs associated with glowing discs and beams of light. On Saturday, March 18th, a Deschutes County Sheriff Deputy and Oregon Animal Humane Agent, Kimball Lewis, were called out to investigate four dead calves in the remote Millican Valley northwest of Brothers. The calves were divided up in pairs about a quarter mile apart. All four had been strangely and bloodlessly skinned. The next day, Sunday, March 19th, eight more calves were found in the same area. Four of those had also been skinned the same way. Puzzling over the lack of tracks and blood on the ground, Kimball Lewis decided to call in a veterinarian to do necropsies to see what the calves looked like inside. Lewis has worked sixteen years on animal abuse cases, first in Colorado. Then in 1996, Lewis was appointed by Oregon's governor to be one of the state's four commissioned agents specializing in large animal abuse and neglect. But he had never seen anything before like the skinned calves. Only one year ago in March 1999, fourteen other dead calves and a pig with its legs cut off had been found only a couple of miles from this new batch of dead calves in March 2000. Early last week, an Oregon judge placed a temporary gag order on the case. Afterward, another eighteen calves were reported dead, but "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by March 28th, Kimball Lewis said those additional eighteen belonged to a rancher who had simply dumped dead spring calves to avoid going to a landfill. Mr. Lewis agreed to talk with me on the record about what he knows so far, particularly about the eight skinned calves. Interviews: Kimball Lewis, Oregon Humane Agent, Bend, Oregon : \"And these animals had their skins removed from just behind their front shoulders, if you will, in a 360 degree pattern down to if you can imagine what would be the equivalent of our ankles on their hind legs. The skin removed was neatly and uniformly down to that area on these animals. The hide on the head and neck was there. But everything else was removed down to the lower half of each leg? That's correct. Was the lumen tissue, that thin tissue over muscle, still intact? It appeared to be, yes. Did you find that to be unusual? From a forensics standpoint, it appeared to be an anomaly. And I really didn't have any explanation for that. I did at that point elect to have a state certified large animal specialist, a veterinarian, return to the scene for the purposes of taking tissue samples and to obtain any other physical evidence that we could garner from that scene. That was Dr. Trish Kentner? Ye s . She is a veterinarian. Did she take these animals back to her clinic? Or did she do the necropsies in the field? We conducted the necropsies in the field at the site and removed some tissue samples and removed those. In hind sight, it's difficult to say one way or the other which would have been the preferred method. But given the size of these animals, it's not as easy to pick them up and take them up as it would be smaller specimens. And so, we discussed that between us and thought that taking of tissue samples would be sufficient for analyses at that point. We're talking about two-week-old calves? Yeah, they appeared to be about two weeks old and along those lines, one of the first questions was: Is it possible these were calves that died during the birthing process because this is calving season. This is the time of year when calves are born. So, one of the things we wanted to determine through the necropsy, and necropsy being the animal version of an autopsy, we wanted to determine if"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"these animals were stillborn? Or had they been alive and thriving? And when we opened the cavities into the internal organs of the animals, we were able to determine that there was food stuffs or milk in the digestive process and that we were able to determine that these calves had been nursing. So we know they weren't stillborn. They were alive. What were the other anomalies the veterinarian discovered when she opened them up for the necropsies? There appeared to be a diminished amount or lack of blood in the internal areas that you would normally expect to see blood in a deceased animal. And to that extent, in the heart and other organs there was less blood than what one would expect to find in an animal in that state. Was there any blood in the chambers of the hear at all? Not that I was able to see. And I don't think that Trish found any. She is a veterinarian opening up the two calves and finding lack of blood in the heart. What was her comment at the time? At that point, she turned to me and said there seemed to be a lack of blood in these animals and that was one of the remarkable observations that we made in the field there that day. I can't say there wasn't any blood because there was some blood. But certainly much less than what we would expect to find. What about the genitals and the sex of the calves? We went to determine the sex of the animals for our reports and she made the observations that the sexual organs were absent and that we could not determine if they were male or female from what we were looking at from a cursory overview. And attempting to look at the organs, there were none. If we look at the case overall and we say, 'What stumped us about this particular case?' it would be the lack of sexual organs, it would be the absence of the skin, it would be the manner in which the animals were disposed of and the lack of blood in the cavity. Being pragmatic, I try to look towards logical explanations for these things. And yet, I don't have a logical explanation. So, I find myself being frustrated in being unable to ascertain what really happened out there. The other thing that was remarkable to us was that the coyotes, which are prolific in that area it's an area that has a large coyote and other population of wild animals that none of these animals had touched these carcasses. And even over a period from Friday, March 17 when we think they came to be there up to March 23rd, it was obvious that no coyotes or birds or other predators had disturbed these carcasses. So, that was one thing that stuck out in our minds and that was one thing that Dr. Kentner had commented that she found to be strange about the scene there. Or strange because it would be an entire week without predation. It would be an entire week without predation. We were surprised to find that coyotes had not predated or disturbed these carcasses. And we were surprised to find that the birds would not even disturb them. So, these were just the anomalies that stood out in our minds overall. And another factor that left us a little curious is that no one has ever come forward to report their cattle missing or that these were their livestock animals. After two weeks at the end of March, you still don't even know whose calves these are? We don't have a clue. We are nowhere nearer to resolution to this than we were the day we went out there the first time. There has been some publicity, too, in that press release from your Humane Agent office in Oregon and articles in local newspapers."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ye s . There has also been some local television and radio. You would think that out of all that, somebody who had lost these many calves - twelve or fourteen - would report it. Twelve. And these types of cases do generate a lot of public interest for a number of reasons, particularly in an area like this where livestock production is a big activity. You know, in the barber's chair in town or the school room, there has been a lot of discussion about what it could be. Certainly, there is no secret this happened. And all the ranchers in the area are familiar with it. I think if somebody owned the animals in the region would have found out by now they were missing and would have contacted us, but that isn't what has occurred. The implication might be that these eight calves cut so strangely might have originated in another part of the country and been placed near Brothers, Oregon for reasons unknown. Well, it would be hard for me to speculate. I don't have a scientific background, I couldn't comment to the origins of the animals, although naturally I would believe they came from somewhere in a geographically relevant area that they were able to be placed there. But again, there are factors in this case we don't have answers to. And at this point, I would doubt the answers will ever manifest themselves to us. You don't think you are going to solve this? I hate to say this, but I don't. I'm not optimistic that we will have resolution to this. I think it is something there is a file drawer for unresolved cases. Call it what you will, we quipped about the X-Files because it was a curious event. It was a curious event where we said there is no answer for that. Naturally when you find mutilated animals out in the desert, office humor can run rampant. You can say all types of things. But I think the reality of it is, I doubt we are going to have answers for how the calves came to be there or who owns them. I don't see any resolution to that forthcoming.\" Lab Analysis and Other High Strangeness in Eastern Oregon Tissue samples from the bloodless heart and lungs of the two calves necropsied by Dr. Trish Kentner were sent to the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Colm Kelleher, Director of NIDS Research, said he might have results about element composition and capillary blood by the second week in April. In 1980, southeast of Bend, Oregon, then 34-year-old Dwain Wright had joined a friend on a hunting trip. Wright, who received a Ph.D. in Psychology from UCLA and a masters degree in graphic design, went along to enjoy the outdoors, not to hunt. the men were in a place called Sand Springs where forest and open range meet. The year before, Wright had discovered a dead cow wedged in the upper limbs of a huge ponderosa pine tree. On this hunting trip, he went off to explore again on his own and stopped at some cattle watering tanks. Dwain Wright, Graphic Artist, Grants Pass, Oregon : \"There was quite a number of what they called cattle mutilations all over the high desert. Bend sits right on the edge of forest with another ridge of mountains and more forest and that opens up into eastern Oregon which is all high desert. It's open cattle range. The current place where there have been these calf deaths in Brothers, Oregon, is only about ten miles from Sand Springs? Yes, as the crow flies, it's about ten miles across the desert. Sand Springs was a watering station where they had large watering troughs. And an old rancher lived in a small travel trailer in the forest in the trees to kind of watch over open range herd and to keep the water tanks full."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So, please explain what happened that day and what you first found in the ground before you talked to that cowboy. I had gone up there with a friend who wanted to go hunting. But the hunting season in Oregon that particular year was very early. There are two seasons in Bend. They call it winter and August. It's either very hot or very cold. It happened to be extremely hot, well over 100 degrees. You don't find deer when it's that hot. Most deer hunters go out for the exercise and nature and not necessarily to hunt deer. So, I stayed behind and I had parked by the watering tanks and was just walking around looking at some unusual things like I found a cow (bull) kind of dead. And I was noticing that particular parts were missing. I have five degrees from UCLA, including a doctorate (in Psychology), and I thought it was fairly unusual. And the more I looked, pretty soon I noticed someone approaching me. And he was an old rancher type. We got to talking and once a little bit of trust was built up, he began to say things that weren't common at the time. People didn't talk about what was happening. Essentially, the bull looked to me like it had been dropped from a great distance in the sky. Cows are fairly heavy, a thousand or more pounds. So, this is sandy soil and it was obviously imprinted in the soil. It reminded me a lot of what they do in England with catapults. They catapult dead animals and I've seen pictures of where they land and it makes quite an impression in the soil. So literally you were looking at a dead cow laying in a shallow crater made by its own body weight landing in the sandy soil? Yes, that's correct. And there were things missing like the tongue, the eyes, the anus. All these things were missing and yet they looked like they had been done bloodlessly. I had cleaned lots of animals having been raised on a farm. And despite the fact the animal is dead, there is still profuse bleeding and there didn't seem to be any blood. And the question in my mind was: the desert and forests are full of wild animals. Why hadn't these (mutilated) animals been consumed by the coyotes or mountain lions or bears? Or just decayed? Those things hadn't happened. You're looking at the body of an animal that is mutilated. How did you come to talk to the cowboy? As I stood up, he was almost behind me. And we started talking, first about the rifle I had along and pretty soon I started asking him about the cows and what had happened and what his function there was. And after half an hour or so, he began to talk about, he asked me if I believed in flying saucers. And he in turn began to talk about what he had seen at night. And he had seen that glowing objects, saucer-shaped objects, would come across the desert. It's clear. It's beautiful at night in Bend out there in the desert. And they would come across the desert and where there was a herd grazing at night, some of these would just be lifted up right up towards the objects and later dropped out through the trees. And he said, they would come down crashing through the trees and hit the ground and he said, 'It was frightening.' He said some of these cows had been dragged across the sand that he couldn't see but made a barking noise a lot like an arc welder. I've heard other people give that same description. The arc welding sound was associated with the beams or these round, glowing discs dropping the animals down through the trees? Or dragging the animals across the ground? Well, he said some were just picked up in a beam of light and just floated up off the ground. He said others were just literally like they were struck over the head and fell flat on the ground and then were dragged off and picked up by a beam of light. He said the whole thing was so bizarre. I had a similar experience on a piece of property I had at the Tumalo Reservoir. I had a huge pine tree in a canyon and it was hundreds of feet from either side of the canyon and yet, there was a cow that was probably a half-size cow at any rate in the top of that pine tree. There was just no way it could have gotten up"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"there. And I thought about it for years. I thought it must have, the only way it could have gotten there was taken up by a flying saucer and dropped out. There weren't any helicopters working in the Bend area at that time. No helicopter pilots I went to helicopter school in the U. S. Army in the Viet Nam era. They are responsible people. No one would pick up a cow and drop it into a pine tree! This finding animals up in trees also was described sporadically back in the 1970s in various parts of the U. S. Did the cowboy describe the sound of the animals dropping down through the trees? Did he actually see the cows drop with his own eyes? Yes, he had actually seen it happening. He said it was frightening and he feared for his own life. It was at the time on the radio, this was happening once to twice every week. It would be on the local radio station about strange things happening to cows out in the desert. And it was always blamed on some type of cult activity. There were no cults out there, period. At that time, this was a very cowboy or redneck type community. Very conservative. If there had been anybody practicing anything, they would have been known about and eliminated from the community. How many times had the cowboy seen those glowing discs put the beams down? He mentioned it happened many times. It was a common occurrence. It was, he didn't say it happened four times a week, or three times a week. He said it happened a lot. And from the news reports, it did happen a lot. Did he ever try to report that to anyone in law enforcement or anyone else? He didn't say if he did or not. I believe at the time he tried to report it, you would either be listed as a nut case or maybe involved with it. People tended to report it like ranchers would say missing cattle. Something has happened and the sheriff would come out and say, 'Well, it was a mountain lion.' I don't believe there are any mountain lions in the high desert around central Oregon. There may be. But where I live here in southern Oregon, mountain lions don't do surgical work on deer or cows. They eat the carcass up in such a means they don't care which part they eat. They just gobble it up. When you heard about this most recent round of the mutilated calves near Brothers, Oregon, what went through your mind? The exact same thing happening that happened before, but I believe it has been happening all along. It's just that there were so many of them in such a short time frame that it got more attention.\" More Information: Book Reference : You can read much more about Sand Springs, Oregon and related accounts in my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness in bookstores and at amazon.com and barnes&noble.com.

Strange Sound As Large Cow Dragged Across Ground in Chacon, New Mexico: Chacon is a remote small ranching community at the base of New Mexico mountains canyons that rise to 10,000 foot peaks. There are only a few hundred farm residents who depend on each other to survive. They watch their pastures, the mountains and the sky for any signs of trouble. Around September 11th, 1994, two people reported seeing an object moving in the night sky that \"looked like a house with lighted windows.\" Three days later on September 13, 1994, at the base of Luhan Canyon, a cow"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"was found dead and mutilated. Its tongue had been removed deep within the throat and a neat circle of hide had been removed around the front jaws. The rectal and vaginal tissue had also been removed in a neat circular cut that was dry and bloodless. A carpenter named Larry Gardea found the dead cow on his way toward Luhan Canyon to go bear hunting at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. He had a 30.6 rifle with him. Larry Gardea, Carpenter, Chacon, New Mexico, September 1994 : \"I was walking through the canyon about 1/2 mile from the house and when I came upon that cow and saw that hole (the cow's rectum), it kind of freaked me out. And as I kept on getting closer, I saw another cow, but it didn't have a hole. It didn't have the mouth mutilated or anything. And I was just looking at it when all of a sudden, I heard that noise and ... September 13, 1994, mutilated cow's head in Chacon, New Mexico; one half jaw stripped of flesh, tongue removed. Polaroid photograph by Chacon Sheriff's Deputy. Chacon, New Mexico cow's bloodlessly excised rectum, September 13, 1994. Photograph by Chacon Sheriff's Deputy. Can you describe the noise as best you can? The noise to me, I've heard it before when I barely first came here. It was in the middle of the day about 2 o'clock, but it didn't phase me then. I didn't think about it. I just ignored it except I looked out and it wasn't in the same area. It was the opposite from where I had seen the cow. I thought it was someone working with an arc welder. It sounds like an arc weld sound. It goes zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and that was the thing that came into my mind at that second. Arc weld. And everything like happened so quick. When I heard that noise, I heard the cows I had passed coming up the canyon because I heard the running of the steps, running the opposite direction away from me. And in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"those few seconds I had to look around where sound was coming from, I saw a cow going over the fence and being dragged along the ground and making a sound like being tortured. Like being tortured? Ye s . Do you mean the cow was being dragged on the ground? It was being dragged, but sort of in the air low to the ground. The cow was able to touch the ground with its feet. Its back was going toward the sound, but it couldn't get up. You mean the cow was on its side with its legs dragging but the back was slightly up in the air? Right. Any tracks where the cow was dragged? No tracks. By the time I came back down to call the sheriff's office and friends, we couldn't find no tracks. The only thing I found were broken branches. I know I saw what I saw. But we couldn't find no tracks. And it had barely rained. So the ground was wet, but still no tracks? There still was no tracks. Does that mean the cow was floating a bit above the ground while it was being dragged? I guess so.\" Carpenter Larry Gardea pointing to the wide ditch that the dragged cow seemed to \"float over\" under the influence of the loud sound that resembled an arc welder's torch. The mutilated cow in photographs above was laying inside the grove of aspens to Gardea's left. The dead cow on its knees was laying behind where Gardea is standing. Photograph © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe. Larry Gardea and I walked all over the hill side looking for any obscure antenna, metallic equipment or signs of any new structures, but did not find anything unusual. I also collected plant samples from the three areas where the mutilated cow, the dead cow crumpled on its knees and the dragged cow had been. Those plants were studied by biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan. On some broken aspen branches five feet above the head of the mutilated cow, he found a reddish-black stain which showed the strong presence of iron when analyzed for elemental composition. Dr. Levengood's hypothesis is that some of the cow's blood was somehow sprayed thinly onto the broken branches. Was the cow being lowered down from above by a mysterious force, mutilated, while another force sent the second cow dead to its knees and the noise welder's arc frequency lifted the third cow over the fence and dragged it along the ground?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Larry Gardea in a panic raised his 30.6 to fire in the sky above the trees at what seemed the source of the terrible noise. His first blast had no effect. He raised his gun sight a little higher above the trees and blasted again. Immediately, all went silent. The cow moving across the ground had disappeared into the trees in front of him. \"Suddenly I realized that whatever was making that noise and dragging that cow away knew I was there. And I turned around and ran back to the house to call the sheriff and my friends.\" Contact Me: I welcome information about the Brothers, Oregon calf mutilations or any other eastern Oregon or other unusual animal deaths.
