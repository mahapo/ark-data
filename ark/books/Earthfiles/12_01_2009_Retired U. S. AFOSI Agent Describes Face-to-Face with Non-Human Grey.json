AFOSI Agent Describes Face-to-Face with Non-Human “Grey” © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “A t the moment of eye contact with that Grey, it was like seven different feature films started rapidly running through my mind all at the same time with sound, temperature, touch and 3-dimensional gold symbols superimposed over the films.” - R etired U.S. AFOSI Agent December 1, 2009 Alb uquerque, New Mexico - In my 1984 research files about high strangeness in the non-human phenomena, I typed the following notes after an interview with a man who had retired from the U. S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). He implied that he actually received his check from an American inte lligence agency when he said, “The AFOSI is convenient cover for U. S. intelligence all over the world.” He would talk to me only off the record and this is the first time I have put his alleged experience in a public forum. Incident Date: 1978 Location: Arizona Source: Retired U. S. AFOSI Agent, John Smith “It started with a flood. There was a dam upstream from a small Arizona town that was deliberately broken open by Blond aliens. I was with a unit that investigated non-human activities - we could go anywhere, anytime. And most everything that happened was covered up pretty easily. I once worked an operation in Idaho where a silver disc had crashed into a remote reservoir. Our job was to retrieve it without anyone knowing. So, we did a mild explosion to a hillside to create a ‘natural’ landslide across the only road into the area and posted warning signs. “My unit associated the lens-shaped discs and the domed discs that have three balls underneath with the Blond types that are usually between 6 to 7 feet tall and human enough to walk crowded city streets without detection. But when you are up close to those types, the irises of their eyes are bigger than humans - more like the diameter of a nickel instead of a dime. The ones I know about were pale blue, almost like clear aquamarines. There were no black dots and lines like human eyes have. I know there are some Blonds that have gold eyes, like the Greeks. Have you ever seen the statue of Apollo in Athens? You can see those gold eyes staring at you from a long way. Eerie! Greek civilization was E. T. hybridization, I guess, by the Blonds. “Then there are the Grey types, the ones I know as ‘extraterrestrial biological entities’ or EBENs, that mostly use white, egg-shaped craft supported on the ground by ‘erector-set’ legs. My unit worked through NSA's Project Sigma to communicate with the Greys because we had learned some frequencies and mathematical communications that would usually connect to the Greys. At least we could send out signals to them to try to communicate. But with the Blonds, there was no communication, except if we tried going through the Greys. I was "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"told a long time ago those two types had a long war against each other, but now I understand even though they don't get along, they fight now mostly with their minds and cloning and the Greys will intervene sometimes on our behalf with the Blonds. “That's what happened that night in Arizona. We sent out a signal to the Greys to ask why the dam was broken and flooded the town. The next thing I knew, I'm getting an order to chopper to a site a few miles from that town. When I get there, I have orders to report to our boss. He tells me that a Grey craft has landed not far away. “He said, ‘It's time you understand what a telepathic download is like from one of these Greys. One has agreed to do a demonstration. I'm going to take you to some tents where the Grey is waiting in one for our signal. You'll be several meters away at the beginning and some of us will be off to the side, so you don't need to worry. It's safe, but you might faint. That's why I'm telling you this now. When you see the Grey, it has agreed to keep its feet on the ground. They prefer to float, but they know that scares the hell out of humans. It will walk on the ground and that will look like Donald Duck. This Grey is only about four feet high to your six feet, so you'll be looking down on it. ‘But remember what I'm telling you now - when that Grey gets a few feet from you, your whole body is going to want to run away. You'll feel the same fear as you would if someone had a flame thrower aimed at you. Every cell in your body is going to be screaming to run, but you can't. You've got to stand there. You'll probably feel like fainting, too, but don't! If you do, we'll catch you, but I don't want you to faint or vomit or run away. Is that clear?! ‘The next thing that happens is the Grey will start raising its eyes to look at your eyes. That's when you'll lose all control of yourself and your mind and you just need to let it happen so you'll know why humans are never going to be sitting down for coffee to talk about the universe with these guys.’ John Smith told me at that point he felt cocky and unafraid and thought his boss was being melodramatic. “I can handle it, don't worry!” A rtist's illustration of a Grey being. Then he saw the tent flap open and a small, grey-colored being waddled out, “just like Donald Duck in the cartoons, I'm not kidding! And it kept coming straight for me with its eyes down. About six feet from me, my knees began to shake. Then my whole body started to shake and I thought I would faint. I wanted out of there! I did want to run! The only thing that kept me standing in that spot was my thinking about my boss, hearing his voice in my head and saying to myself, ‘Fuck it! I'm not going to fall apart while my boss is watching.’” What happened next completely overwhelmed John Smith. He told me that while he was trying to force his body to stop shaking, he saw the Grey head begin slowly tilting upward and could see the large, black, shiny eyes with narrow points near the center of the Grey's flat face that ballooned out as the eyes slanted up and outward. “Linda, at the moment of eye contact with that Grey, it was like seven different feature films started rapidly running through my mind all at the same time with sound, temperature, touch and 3-dimensional gold symbols superimposed over the films. I knew my mind was trying to ask questions, but that seemed to create all the branching pieces of film in my mind - like visual answers to whatever my brain was thinking. But while those films seemed to have something to do with where the Greys came from and why they are here, I also felt like my entire mind was being transferred into the Grey's mind. If God himself asked me what was communicated by that Grey, I don't have a clue! And when it was over and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the Grey lowered its eyes, I did start to faint. My boss and his men caught me. I guess I passed out because I don't remember anything more until I woke up on a cot in one of the tents. “And that's why humans aren't going to be sitting down with Greys over coffee to learn about the universe. After all that, and with the Greys trying to help us communicate with the Blonds, we never did learn why the Blonds broke the dam. But I'll tell you one thing I do know - the Blonds don't do anything without a specific reason.” A n adult female's March 1982 abduction near Springfield, Missouri, involved 6-foot-tall, blond-haired male humanoids.
