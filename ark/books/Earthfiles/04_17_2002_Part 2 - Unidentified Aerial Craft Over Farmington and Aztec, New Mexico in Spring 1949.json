Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 2 - Unidentified Aerial Craft Over Farmington and Aztec, New Mexico, Around Spring 1949 © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Return to Part 1 April 17, 2002 Aztec, New Mexico - A month ago on March 16, 2002, I posted an Earthfiles report in Real X-Files about the 52nd anniversary of a huge, fly-over of unidentified silver and orange disks for hours above Farmington and Aztec, New Mexico, on March 17, 1950. The next day, March 18, 1950, the unprecedented aerial event made headlines in the Farmington Daily Times and The Denver Post . M arch 18, 1950 Farmington Daily Times , Farmington, New Mexico. But March 17, 1950 was not the first fly-over the Farmington and Aztec area. One year before in the spring of 1949 - and very likely March also - Hulon and Geneva Pace and their 9-year-old son, Glenn, were renting a house on Lincoln Street in Farmington while their new house was being built. Hulon, who is now 82-years-old, lived with his wife, Geneva, in Farmington until April 2002 when they moved to Tennessee to be closer to their son. I met Geneva and Hulon in Aztec during a conference there March 22-24, took photographs of them, received a drawing that Hulon did of the silver discs he saw fly over town that spring. He and Glenn distinctly remember a newspaper headline about a crashed disk in Hart Canyon 11 miles northeast of Aztec in what was then the Farmington Times Hustler . I checked with Times librarian, Margaret Mathers, about the date that the Hustler changed to the Farmington Daily Times. She told me the first daily newspaper came out on August 1, 1949. I asked her what day the newspaper was printed and distributed prior to August 1. She said in 1949 the Hustler came out on Fridays. So, for example if there was another fly-over or crash on St. Patrick's Day March 17, 1949, it turns out that was a Thursday and the story would have been printed the next day, Friday, March 18, 1949. A crashed disk on a national holiday prior to 1950 was discussed by a military officer described in the \"Military Voices\" chapter of my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness. So, I asked Margaret Mathers to check the back issues of the Farmington newspaper for both March 18 and March 25, 1949. The newspapers archived on microfilm for those dates had these respective headlines: \"Legislature Attempts Disenfranchisement of Navahos\" and \"Navahos Consider Asking for Accredited Schools.\" The librarian said there was not a single word in either paper about unidentified aerial objects or a crash in Hart Canyon. But Hulon Pace, retired now, but former shop foreman at Smoak Chevrolet and El Paso Natural Gas in Farmington, remembers that he and his wife, Geneva, and their 9-year-old son, Glenn, all saw a newspaper headline and read the story about a disk coming down in Hart Canyon.

Interviews: Hulon Pace, Resident of Farmington, New Mexico from 1945-2002 and former shop foreman for Farmington's Smoak Chevrolet and employee for El Paso Natural Gas : \"We saw the story in the paper and the wife and I went to the college up here to locate that paper, but we can't find it anywhere. But it's well known throughout the community here that there was a crash site of a saucer out northeast of Aztec. In Hart Canyon? In Hart Canyon, right. If you go back to March of 1949 which appears to be the month and date that Glenn and I and others have talked about, can you remember what you saw with your own eyes in the newspaper? There was supposedly a UFO crashed in Hart Canyon. They had a write up on it, but I can't remember how it was worded at that time. It's been so long. Do you remember anything about the headlines, the big words on the newspaper? I think it just said, 'UFO Crashes In Hart Canyon,' I believe, is the way the headlines was in the newspaper. Can you explain where you were living at that time that helped you and your wife remember? We was in a rental on Lincoln Street here in Farmington while we was building a new house. You would have been in that rental in March of 1949? Ye s . When you recently went to the library and have tried to find that 1949 newspaper, what did you and your wife talk about in terms of the fact that it doesn't seem to be there anymore in the archives? We couldn't imagine. At the time we checked all we could check on it and see why it wasn't there and we never could get any information why it didn't show up there. Everybody just seemed to be blank about it. Nobody had any suggestions or whys or wherefores or whatever.\" Newspaper Headline About Disk In Hart Canyon Not only does Hulon Pace and his son, Glenn remember the newspaper headline, but both father and son associate the headline with their own eyewitness sightings of another fly-over of unidentified discs right before the newspaper story. If so, that would mean discs went over the Farmington/Aztec area both in the spring of 1949 and the famous armada of March 17, 1950. Here is Mr. Pace's drawing of the silver discs he saw over Farmington in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the spring of what he thinks was the spring of 1949. S ketch by Hulon Pace on March 22, 2002 of the silver disks he remembers moving above Farmington for several minutes in the spring of 1949, when he and his family were living in a rental while their house was being built. The next day he and his family say the Farmington Hustler newspaper had a headline and story about a disk crashing in Hart Canyon 11 miles northeast of Aztec. Suspected date of sighting was either in 1948 or 1949 on March 17, and Hart Canyon newspaper headline on March 18. Hulon Pace: \"They was playing around like they was dogfighting or something, you know. About five or six is the best I can remember at the time that we saw them and stood there and watched them for ten minutes or so. Then they disappeared off to the northeast. What were their color and shape? They was a silver color and kind of shaped like a saucer. They would turn up on their side where the sun would shine on them every once in awhile and you could see them real plain when they turned up on their side. Otherwise, they would just flatten out and you could hardly tell the color of them when they flattened out. But when they turned up on their side, it would be going one direction and then all at once, they would go another direction not even slowing up. It was amazing! And what gave you the impression of a dogfight? Well, just the way they were playing around. I don't know if you would call it a dogfight or what. It looked like they were just maneuvering around each other like our planes sometimes would do in a dogfight, just putting on a show or something. You don't mean that it looked like some of them were fighting with others? No, they weren't really fighting, just maneuvering is what they were doing. It was amazing as fast as they were going how they could keep from running into each other.\" Glenn Pace, Eyewitness to Unidentified Aerial Disks Above Farmington Around 1949"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"G lenn Pace at age 9 at his Farmington, New Mexico home where he lived with his parents, Hulon and Geneva Pace. Glenn was born on February 17, 1940 and by the spring of 1949, he had a paper route. Photo courtesy Geneva and Hulon Pace. H ulon's son, Glenn Pace, is now 62-years-old living and working near Nashville, Tennessee in the music recording business. The same time his father was seeing the dogfight in the spring of 1949, Glenn was at grade school and saw part of the same strange action in the sky. Glenn Pace, son of Hulon Pace, music and commercial editor, Nashville, Tennessee: \"And we come out of school for recess right towards the end of that situation. And we must have seen them for about 30 or 40 seconds that first time. What did you see with your own eyes? We saw the formation up there, silvery discs and they made a couple moves together which I thought was really strange. When these things in the air were all moving in unison together. Like some people have compared it to schools of fish moving. Yeah, kind of like that. Like they first moved, they were like over the south part of the bluffs there. And they made a move towards the airport which would have been west of Farmington. Then they made a jog that jogged back over kind of towards Bloomfield, but not very - must have been like over 2 or 3 miles east. And then they moved back over the bluffs, they made a jog back over there. And then from there, they bolted toward Durango. They were gone in just a flash. It wasn't more than a few seconds. You watched see this with your own eyes? Right. And I had a paper route at that point. I had a huge paper route. So, you got to see the newspaper article with your own eyes? Yes, I did. I remember reading the headline and my mom read the whole article to us all in the living room at the dining table. I delivered the papers that day, too, besides reading the article, I delivered papers that was there. And when I rolled it up, it was right there. You could see it when it was rolled up! It's not something that was a figment of my imagination. That article really existed. How in the world they got them all is beyond me! Try to tell me what you remember the headline said. The next day in the paper, an article come out that was headlined in the paper. It said that a UFO had crashed near Aztec up in Hart Canyon. It had a pinhole in the porthole and there were three charred bodies inside about 4 foot high in stature. And that the government had come and took the craft and carried it away."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"G lenn Pace, 9 years old, and his friend, Teddy Brock, on Glenn's horse Nibbles in 1949.

You rode out to Hart Canyon on horseback and saw with your own eyes jeep tracks? Truck tracks and stuff. My grandad had a big truck, so I knew what truck tracks looked like in the sand and there were truck tracks out there. Then, the very next year on March 18, 1950, you were ten years old ... Yeah, a year later in March of 1950, we were on the playground and we saw, a kid looked up and saw a whole bunch of UFOs up there and said, 'Hey, look at that!' And we looked up and said, 'Wow, that's just like the other ones that we seen.' But there were a lot more of them. They were just, they moved a couple of moves and were just kind of going slow. And then they took off in the same direction again. They went back towards Durango when they left. But now we only saw the one fly-over. Other people reported seeing more than one fly-over. On that day. Yeah, on that day.\" Government File On Aztec, NM Disk Beyond these memories, there have also been leaks by military people and others about the discovery of an extraordinary craft near Aztec with details that sound similar to Glenn Pace's childhood memory of what he and his parents saw in the newspaper. I first saw Aztec mentioned on a list of UFOB crash sites on April 9, 1983. I was in the U. S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico working on an hour special for Home Box Office. The man across a desk from me was Richard C. Doty, then a Special AFOSI Agent in the Air Force. He showed me an alleged briefing paper for the President of the United States that included a list of U. S. government retrieval operations of what the document called \"unidentified aerial craft\" of extraterrestrial origin. Some crash locations I remember listed in the briefing paper were Aztec, Roswell and Magdalena, New Mexico; Kingman, Arizona; and northern Mexico south of Laredo. The Aztec incident, according to other sources beyond that briefing paper, involved a 99-foot-diameter silver disc with a dome discovered in Hart Canyon eleven miles northeast of Aztec in March 1949. About that alleged crash, some years ago I received a military officer's confidential interview entitled \"The Report on the Crash at Farmington.\" There was a black and white photograph of a silver disk at the site. The officer helped produce a computer recreation of the silver disk downed near Farmington, New Mexico \"prior to 1950.\" The military officer said dead non-human beings were found inside the craft. The name Farmington in the file title was thought to have been used instead of Aztec because in 1949, Farmington was a larger town than the nearby rural farming community of Aztec."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A computer simulation of a photograph allegedly seen by former military officer in early 1960s. Photograph's location was a file drawer in a classified military library. Source said silver-colored disk was U. S. military near Farmington, New Mexico, prior to 1950. For more information, see: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Str angeness in Earthfile s Shop. The authors of the report are two investigators whom I know and they wanted me to see the computer-generated drawing based on a photograph the man said he had seen during a military assignment. The image depicted a disc shaped like two smooth saucers glued edge-to-edge and topped by a shallow dome. The caption read: \"A computer simulates the disc-shaped craft as it was seen intact on the ground in the actual photograph.\" I agreed not to identify the authors at their request and they gave me permission to excerpt from their discussions with a \"witness who was a former military officer. While serving, he said he had a special security clearance that enabled him to access a restricted library (prior to 1970). Due to the highly sensitive nature of the information, and possible risk to this individual, no information is provided which could be used to identify him or the location of the base.\" The following excerpts are not verbatim, but were compiled from notes after four separate conversations with the military eyewitness. \" Q: What was the occasion in which you viewed documents concerning crashed saucers? A: While I was stationed at this particular base, ...the materials library was available to those officers with a designated security clearance and I had the appropriate clearance. I was passing time in the library and I discovered a file on the subject of an alien craft and its dead occupants that had been retrieved. The file contained a report, a separate black and white photograph, and a book by Major Donald Keyhoe. Q: What did you see in the photograph? A: There was a perfectly intact, circular-shaped craft and it was lying somewhat tilted to one side on the ground in the desert. There did not appear to be a crater or other ground-surface disturbance in the photograph that would indicate a crash, but I could not tell for sure. ...it was stated that the craft was retrieved somewhere near the town of Farmington, New Mexico, prior to 1950. As I could see in the photograph, the material of which the craft was composed was metallic, and resembled brushed aluminum. The report noted this also. Q: Were there any surface features on the craft at all? A: It was stated in the report that there were portholes on the cabin part of the craft, but they were not made of any type of glass. I couldn't make out this feature in the photograph. Q: Did the information reveal what that material could have been? A: Well, this porthole had a puncture that was the diameter of a pencil; that was the only defect discovered on the entire ship. Our people tried diamond drills, an acetylene torch - everything they could come up with on the porthole where this opening was located, but nothing would break through it. They couldn't enlarge the hole, either. The material was tougher than anything we were familiar with on earth. But they eventually got into the cabin. Q: Did the report say how they accessed it? A: Yes, it was described as a chance opening. They had gone over the outside of the craft and could not even find a seam or crack that might indicate the location of a door or other entrance. This led them to focus on the small opening in the porthole. As I mentioned earlier, they used everything they could think of to enlarge this hole, and nothing worked. It was concluded that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"they would have to somehow gain access through this hole and they eventually did because a door popped open. It appeared from a place where there were no obvious seams or other indications of a door. The report said (referring to the opening and closing of the door) that it was 'almost as if the material of the craft had liquefied and then solidified again,' leaving no clue of the door's location upon closing. If there was a seam, it was so tight it couldn't be observed. Q: Was there anything in the report that indicated the weight of the craft? A: Yes, it was apparently composed of a very lightweight material. The report stated that two average men could lift or move the entire ship. Q: I am especially interested in what these dead occupants were like. Were they described as biological extraterrestrials. A: Well, it said that the two bodies were badly charred. So was the interior of the cockpit of the craft. The report also said that they were about four feet in height. There was no description of their features beyond that. Q: So, there was no mention of sexual difference? A: No, no mention of that. But it's interesting that the report said that the clothing wasn't burned at all. It was a one-piece flight suit. Q: So, there was a description of the fabric? A: Yes, it was some type of woven fabric and the report said that it had a tensile strength of 800 pounds. Q: Was there any mention of craft propulsion systems? A: There was no mention of a propulsion system other than the idea that their technology utilized magnetic or gravitational fields of the planets to travel in space. Q: Was there anything in the report that indicated the reason for the craft coming down? For example, there have been rumored reports that our military was under orders to intercept and shoot them down. Is it possible that we shot this one down? A: According to the report, we were not responsible for bringing this craft down. There was mention of a magnetic fault, or opening, or something like that, located in the area where the craft came down. There were three of these faults or openings located in North America: one was located in the Southwest, around the Texas/New Mexico area; one was somewhere in the Carolinas; and one was somewhere in the Northeast sector, but I can't remember exactly where. Q: Have there been more than one crash? A: Yes, the report referred to 'crashes' and the Farmington crash information was used to relate general information on similarities with other crashes. Q: Are you saying that these aliens are not able to control their craft in certain areas? A: From the report, I learned these areas occur naturally and could possibly interfere with the navigation of these craft. The way I understand it, they use the natural magnetic lines of a planet and a gravity field to move their ships from one place to another. That's how they are able to make near-right angle turns which our jets are incapable of doing. They can fly circles around any of our aircraft. Q: Was there anything in the report that suggested where the craft and little beings originated, or why they are coming here? A: No, nothing ... but the report did say that hundreds of alien craft flew over the town of Farmington, New Mexico on the anniversary of this crash. That also corresponded with the celebration of some national holiday. It said that may have been a tribute to the beings that were killed, or they were letting us know by a show of force they had overcome the factor that caused their ships to crash. Q: Why do you feel that the military or the government is withholding this information from the public? A: They felt that only people in professional levels were capable of dealing with this information. Based on what occurred with the Orson Welles Wa r o f the Worlds radio presentation, this information could create panic. Then it threatens to break down the industrial complex that supports the military complex; it would obviously undermine it. And it could possibly reduce our ability to counter an attack by a hostile alien culture. But it was also clear that the intent of these particular beings was not known."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"While our technicians worked on the craft out in the desert (trying to gain access), other alien ships would from time to time fly by the site, pausing momentarily to view the scene, perhaps to see if there were any survivors. At no time did they attempt to harm our people. All the information on this subject was removed from the library in the late 1960s. One thing I can say is that I would sure like to know what's going on now.\" More Information: I f anyone has more information about the Farmington disc flyovers on March 17, 1950, or the retrieval of one or more silver discs near Aztec, please contact the Aztec Library at: 505-334-7658.
