But on Thursday and Friday, October 23 and 24, they poured in, with dozens of people claiming to see unexplainable lights across the Erath County area.” - Stephenville Empire-Tribune C ropped cell phone image showing two of three strange lights (middle reddish and top white), first lined up horizontally and then rotated counterclockwise to a vertical line above Henderson Junior High football field (bottom two stadium lights).

A triangle of three small towns (central green circles) southwest of Fort Worth begins with Stephenville, the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population about 15,000. Dublin is about eight miles southwest and has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Selden with a full time population of about seven. Brownwood in lower left is about 33 miles southwest of Dublin and in the flight path of jets traveling to and from the Brownwood Military Operation Area (MOA) . October 28, 2008 Stephenville, Texas - On Tuesday night, October 21, 2008, around 8:30 PM, Sherry Sechrist and her family noticed lights in the sky. Using her cell phone, Sherry snapped a few still images, while her mother shot some video on her cell phone. Sherry told Stephenville Empire-Tribune reporter, Whitney White-Ashley, that “the lights "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"would flash and move up and down and side-to-side. She could hear jets buzzing around the lights, but doesn't think the jets produced the lights. ‘I'd like to know what goes in reverse,’ Sechrist said. ‘The lights would fly over and then they would stay still.’” Then on Thursday night, October 23, 2008, phones at the newspaper and local law enforcement really began to ring. Here are some highlights from eyewitnesses between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM Central: - 8:00 PM, Juli Gibson, southwestern Erath County, was riding her horse when she saw “four white lights flashing on and off. ‘It's like they were talking to each other. It was just weird.’” - 8:15 PM, Monica Diaz, near the Stephenville High School, saw four lights in a straight line “turn on and off individually, but they would move as a group” for about 30 seconds without noise. - Around 8:30 PM, Nick Horn, west of Stephenville, saw an orange light in the sky soon followed by jets. He videotaped about twenty seconds of lights moving across the dark night sky. Nick described the orange light as “a metal object hovering about 400 feet in the air” that moved toward Dublin. - 8:30 PM, John Darby and daughter, on Highway 76 near Selden, saw small and orange lights that “grew larger and began to display different colors in a beach ball-like pattern. Then they disappeared.” They Darby saw about nine jets moving fast as if “they were doing maneuvers with some kind of tracers.” - 8:30 PM, Charlie Carrasco, Stephenville, watched two fighter jets flying low to the ground “chasing flashes of light in the air.” - 8:30 PM, Ashley Ainsworth was driving outside of Stephenville on Highway 377 when she and other drivers pulled over to watch six yellow lights move in a circular motion. Next the lights disappeared and then reappeared by blinking on and off. - 8:40 PM, Ashleigh Cole, 10 miles south of Dublin, saw “three lights in a row that would move straight up in the sky and at an angle.” - 8:45 PM, Darlene Ross, northwest of Stephenville near Ranger, saw two orange lights turn into four lights stacked in a vertical line. “It was just the weirdest thing I ever saw in my entire life. It was acting weird and it was scary.” - 9 PM, D'Ann Wheeler, southeast of Stephenville in Hico, was with a friend as they watched “two sets of string of pearls” lights in the sky with soundless “jets all around them.” 8:30 PM “Very Odd Lights” Above Henderson Junior High Football Stadium, Stephenville Brent Chambers is the brother of Angelia Joiner, former reporter at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune during the January to February 2008 UFO flap in the Stephenville, Dublin, Selden region. Angelia felt forced to resign because newspaper management wanted to end UFO reporting in the paper. [ See 022208 Earthfiles. ] Brent is 42-years-old and he and Angelia were born and raised in Stephenville. After high school graduation, Brent became a truck mechanic, drove trucks and is now a truck mechanic for Ingram Enterprises LP in Stephenville. Ironically, with his sister's frontline reporting during the January to February 2008 UFO flap, Brent never saw any unusual lights in the sky. Now, on Thursday night, October 23, 2008, at 8:30 PM, he and his wife saw three “very odd lights” move in the sky above the Henderson Junior High Football Stadium about 1.5 miles from Stephenville's City Hall. Interview: Brent Chambers, Truck Mechanic, Ingram Enterprises LP, Stephenville, Texas: “We had eaten supper that night at a local restaurant and after we left the restaurant, we were coming down a street that we live on, which is Frey Street. We were going to go and look at some Halloween decorations on the other side of town. Driving down Frey, going from east to west, when we got down to where the Gilbert Intermediate School is, my wife and I noticed there were some very odd looking lights in the sky. I mentioned to her the lights"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and she said, ‘That’s an airplane.’ But when we cleared the trees a little bit, we both decided that it was not an airplane that we were looking at because the lights were just real odd looking. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT WAS SO ODD ABOUT THE THREE LIGHTS? Normally if you look into a bright light, you’ll see glare coming off the light - like if you look at a car headlight, you don’t actually see the real dimensions of the light. You see the brightness coming off of it and the glare. Well, these lights on whatever we saw were perfectly round, but they were not glaring lights. They were bright – it’s hard to explain because it was not like a light that would be shining at something to illuminate it. The lights were just lights in the sky. COLORS? No, what I saw was just really, really pure white color. SIZE ? At arm's length, something like the size of a pea. But we had no idea how far away they were so it's hard to judge size. ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIGHT THAT PULSED? No, no pulsing or anything like that. They were real steady burning. That’s what made it so odd because any normal light you look at, for the most part, has got glare that comes with it. Like the lights at the football stadium – there was glare coming off those. But the lights up in the sky, each was like a perfect circle of white light and no glare to it. So, we ended up pulling into the parking lot of Gilbert Intermediate (5th and 6th graders), which actually overlooks the direction that we were facing, over the Henderson Junior High School and its football stadium. They had a football game going on at the time. These odd lights that we saw were directly above the football field, right above the stadium lights – probably 30 or 40 feet above the lights. But I don’t know how far away they were. We couldn’t really tell because of the brightness of the stadium lights and the Gilbert school parking lot we pulled into had parking lights in it. Light Rotate Counterclockwise from Horizontal to Vertical So, we couldn’t really see an object in the sky, but we could see three lights that were equal distant apart and all equal in size. They started out almost being horizontal (straight line) and then all three of them would shift around counterclockwise to the vertical position. Then, they would disappear. Then as soon as those three lights would disappear, it would take maybe one or two seconds and another set of three lights would reappear back in the horizontal position again. It would make that sequence where it would go from horizontal back to vertical and then would disappear. IF YOU HAVE THREE LIGHTS THAT ARE SEPARATED IN A STRAIGHT LINE, HOW DID THEY MOVE TO FORM THE VERTICAL STRAIGHT LINE? If you had a pencil in front of you and you imagine there were three lights on that pencil – one at either end and one in the center equal distance apart – and you took that pencil and turned it from horizontal to vertical with all the lights staying the same distance from each other, that’s how this happened in a counterclockwise motion. DID IT HAPPEN RAPIDLY? No, it wasn’t real rapid or like blinking lights or flashing lights. They were steady burning and it just moved to the vertical in two or three seconds and then they extinguished for a second or two and then they appeared again horizontal and repeated that same pattern. I’m going to estimate the three lights did that probably six times, but only one time for sure that I could tell what the pattern was in front of us in the parking lot because we had finally got clear of the trees and able to see it in its entirety. Looking through the trees driving down Frey Street, we could see the lights were moving, but I couldn’t tell you exactly how they were moving when we were driving. HOW LONG DID THE THREE LIGHTS HOLD IN THE HORIZONTAL POSITION BEFORE MOVING UP TO THE VERTICAL? Probably not more than a couple of seconds."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THEN IT WOULD HOLD VERTICAL FOR HOW LONG? It wasn’t very long, about the same amount of time it held the horizontal – just a couple of seconds. Then, they all extinguished at the same time. It’s like they were all lit up and then they moved around counterclockwise to the vertical position and then they all went out and then in a couple of seconds after those three went out, there would be three more show up in the horizontal position. Witnesses At the Football Game? COULD YOU SEE PEOPLE IN THE FOOTBALL STANDS? I couldn’t see people in the stands. I could only see the lights at the stadium because they are just right above the treetop level where we were. While we were in the parking lot and the photo that I snapped at, I think, 8:34 PM is what my cell phone says. Then we watched to see if anything else was going on and the lights from the stadium went out. I guess the football game was over and people started leaving the stadium coming our direction. Then we come to find out that people at the stadium actually did see the lights, too. Then we had people pulling into the parking lot where we were, trying to see what was going on. But we never spoke to anyone there. IS THE ONE CELL PHONE IMAGE THE ONLY ONE YOU TOOK? Yes, it’s the only one that I have. I was talking on one cell phone (with sister Angelia Joiner) and I was trying to take pictures with a cell phone I wasn’t familiar with and that’s why the one photo that I have is so bad (only shows two of three lights in horizontal line). I'm going to start carrying a camera with me!” E nlarged original cell phone image taken at 8:34 PM in Stephenville, Texas, overlooking the Henderson Junior High football stadium. Four stadium lights are bottom of frame. Two of three unidentified aerial lights in straight line near center and top center. Image © 2008 by Brent Chambers. W hen Brent was reporting the odd, moving lights to his sister, Angelia, on one cell phone while trying to use another cell phone to photograph them above the Henderson football stadium, Angelia told her brother that where she was in Dublin, eight miles southwest of Stephenville, she could see several jets and what she thought were flares being dropped. Angelia e-mailed me, “ I honestly wonder if the flares were dropped just so the military could make a case of saying that is what people saw. Carswell AFB said they had 7 jets operating in the area. There were a lot of jets. I thought more than that.” Brent Chambers said after the stadium lights went out that he and his wife watched the sky for awhile from the Gilbert parking lot. Eventually, the couple saw two jets flying high in the sky without any flares. United States Air Force Reserve Major Karl Lewis, Public Affairs Officer at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, e-mailed the Stephenville Empire-Tribune: “Seven F-16s from the 457th fighter squadron flew from Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth to the Brownwood Military Operation Area (MOA) for normal training operations, Thursday, 23 October 2008, from approximately 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. local time.” "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Other Lights in Selden That Changed from Horizontal to Vertical E xcerpt Reprint of Archived 022208 Earthfiles. O n the night of January 8, 2008, dozens of eyewitnesses in the region of Texas southwest of Dallas/Fort Worth reported seeing strange combinations of flashing lights in the sky. Everyone said the lights were either on a single huge craft or were in rigid formation. All agreed that the lights pulsed on and off, but not together. One light would come on and go off while one or more at random distances would flash on and off. The earliest high strangeness that night began around 6:12 PM in Selden, Texas. Fifty- year-old Steve Allen is Owner, President and CEO of L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight, a trucking and transportation brokerage company in Glen Rose, Texas, which he founded with his wife, Laquita, in 1994. Steve has also been a civilian pilot since the late 1970s when he learned to fly. As the sun was near setting, Steve traveled from his Glen Rose office to a hill in nearby Selden to sit by a campfire and relax before dark with his long-time friend, Mike Odam, and a local postal worker, Lance Jones. Steve said the sun was still about half way above the horizon when astonishing aerial events occurred in the clear, cloudless sky.

Interview: Steve Allen, Owner, President and CEO, L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight, Glen Rose, Texas: “I looked toward the east (my right) and saw four lights coming towards us at a high rate of speed - and flashing. That’s when I asked Mike Odam and Lance Jones if they were seeing what I was seeing. They said yes. WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING? Bright, white lights. Very bright and intense. They were large."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"S elden, Texas, hillside and campfire at 6:12 PM on January 8, 2008. Eyewitnesses of four bright lights in mile-long by 1/2-mile wide rectangle pattern were Steve Allen, Mike Odam and Lance Jones. All sketches © 2008 for Earthfiles by Steve Allen. A FULL MOON AT ARM’S LENGTH CAN BE COVERED BY THE TIP OF A LITTLE FINGERNAIL. I estimate that each of those four lights were about the size of a quarter at arm’s length. WHAT WE DON’T KNOW PRECISELY IS THE DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THAT QUARTER-SIZE LIGHT AT ARM’S LENGTH DISTANCE? Correct. I could see where the craft was flying over. That’s my regular area of flight when I fly my airplane. So, I’m pretty familiar with the area and approximate altitude. WHEN THE FOUR LIGHTS FIRST APPEARED, WERE THEY IN A STRAIGHT LINE OR PATTERN? It appeared to be a rectangular pattern and they were all level and traveling at the same rate of speed and same distance apart. IS THIS THEN THE FIRST RECTANGLE WITH A LIGHT AT EACH CORNER THAT YOU DESCRIBED AS A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE? Correct. That was a conservative estimate, but that was about as close as I could get. The way I got my distances was by the land that has grid sections. I waited until the craft got even with us and then did a visual from the ground to the sky and could tell what a mile was due to the section rows out there and came to my mile long conclusion. And it appeared to be half as wide as it was long. WAS IT ONE LARGE OBJECT THAT HAD FOUR LIGHTS IN A RECTANGULAR PATTERN? OR FOUR COMPLETELY SEPARATE OBJECTS THAT WERE IN FORMATION? We couldn’t confirm for sure what it was, but just the way the lights traveled, we felt like it was one big thing. We talked about the flying-in-formation scenario, but the three of us thought it was more likely to be one, huge, single craft. Mile-Long Rectangle of Four Lights Traveled “Between 2,000 and 3,000 mph” It seemed like the rectangle of lights was traveling at a very high rate of speed. My original estimate was between 2,000 and 3,000 mph. It was gradually slowing down as we watched and came into range 15 to 20 miles away. By the time it got even with us, it was traveling like a normal aircraft speed, probably anywhere around the 200 to 300 mph range. By then, the lights were traveling about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above ground level and approximately one-half mile north of our Selden hilltop location. As the rectangle of lights"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"went past us, that’s when the ‘show’ started. As the lights in the rear – or two corner lights – came past us, more lights appeared in the rear. I think there was seven. It went on into Stephenville, which was seven or eight more miles into town as a bird flies. YOU HAD FOUR LIGHTS IN FOUR CORNERS MAKING A RECTANGLE PERHAPS A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE. Right, and the lights were flashing (randomly). Four Lights Became Nine Lights WHERE DID THE OTHER FIVE LIGHTS APPEAR IN THE REAR? That happened after it went past us. That’s when we could see the rear of whatever it was - or at least we think that was the rear of it. After it came to dead even with us, it went past us and we noticed the rest of the lights come on. A t 6:13 PM on January 8, 2008, the rear two large, white lights of rectangle pattern change into seven equally spaced large, white lights. Front two lights remain in original position. They were equally spaced apart in this half-mile distance across the rear. They were exactly level with each other, exactly horizontal. They also were very bright. They appeared as the same intensity as the four corner lights. They were flashing in no particular pattern. One would flash and then another. There was no rhythm or pattern to it whatsoever, the flashes. SO, FIVE MORE LIGHTS WERE ADDED TO THE REAR ON THAT RECTANGLE IN A STRAIGHT LINE AND THEY SEEM TO BE EQUALLY SEPARATED – THE SAME SIZE, THE SAME WHITE LIGHT INTENSITY. Correct. And each light in a random scenario would go all the way out. It wasn’t like they would go to a dim glow or pulsing. It was like a turn indicator off and on. There was no rhyme or reason which one would go on or off. There was no rhythm to them. As the rectangle of lights passed by us, it was gradually slowing down. It got to the edge of Stephenville and came to a complete stop. It had not changed altitude any. It was still at the 2,500 to 3,000 foot altitude. Then very suddenly, the lights in the rear reconfigured into an arch going upward like a bow in a bow and arrow. S even horizontal rear lights suddenly change to an arch pattern of equally spaced, bright, white lights. THE LIGHTS WERE A HORIZONTAL LINE AND THEN FORMED A HALF CIRCLE? That’s a good scenario – more like a football turned sideways arch. That lasted for three or four seconds and then the lights suddenly appeared into a vertical line. The lights were still flashing with no rhythm or course of action. They were just intermittently flashing. DO YOU MEAN THAT ALL NINE LIGHTS SUDDENLY FORMED A STRAIGHT, VERTICAL LINE? I believe it was just the seven in the rear all formed a vertical line. DID THE LIGHTS CHANGE FORMATION LIKE ICE SKATERS?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"No, they just instantly reconfigured. YOU SAW THE HORIZONTAL LINE OF THE SEVEN LIGHTS. THEN THE NEXT MICROSECOND, THEY WERE IN A VERTICAL LINE? Ye s . THEY WERE ALL WHITE? Yes, actually the vertical line came from the arched bow. The lights were horizontal and then went to a bow and then went to a vertical line. Then about two or three seconds later, it became two sets of the vertical lights. They appeared to be about quarter to a half mile apart. And they were all flashing like they had been before. A rch of white lights changed suddenly to one vertical line of seven lights, followed in a couple of seconds by the appearance of a second vertical line of seven lights. Two Vertical Lines of Lights Transformed into Rectangles of White Fire T he two vertical lines of seven, bright, white lights suddenly transform into two large rectangles of white flames moving inside the rectangular frames. Steve Allen estimated the heights of the rectangular frames to be 150 yards; the width of the rectangles to be 50 yards; and a distance of 1/4 of a mile between the two rectangles of white fire. Then in two or three more seconds, the two vertical lines of flashing lights turned into white flames. It looked like the flames were contained inside two rectangular shaped 3-dimensional frames about 50 yards wide and about 150 yards tall."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU SAY FLAME, I’M THINKING OF FIRE. Exactly. It was a real light-colored fire. It looked like it was contained in a rectangular box because of its outline of the fire. But there were two rectangular boxes of white fire. Each one of the vertical sets of lights turned into a flame job. Then two seconds later, it disappeared totally. Everything had like a two to three second delay to it – like it had the arch of pulsing lights that went to the vertical scenario that was flashing. Then about three seconds later, it had two sets of vertical lights and then two or three seconds later it went to the white fire. Then two to three seconds later, it was gone completely. BOTH OF THEM? EVERYTHING? Yes, everything. It was two rectangular boxes containing flames and it was like something Biblical. It was right there, not far out in space. This was very up close and personal. That's what the three of us said to each other: ‘It's like something out of the Bible.’ And one of the guys asked, ‘Could this be the end of the world?’ HOW DID YOU DISTINGUISH FLAMES IN ALL WHITE? It just had the moving flame look to it. More Lights and F-16 Jets After this happened, we stood there for about ten minutes discussing, ‘What the hell could this have been?’ Lance immediately gets in his car and leaves. It kind of scared him, I guess, or freaked him out. He leaves and we go inside Mike Odam’s house and tell his wife what we had just seen. Then she calls Lance to see if he's OK and he says, ‘You all better get back out there because it’s back coming from the west this time.’ So, we go outside and here it comes from the west and to the south of us this time. It looked to be a little bit lower than it was the first time. It had the two lights in the front as it came past and you could see the other two lights in the rear. Each white light in the rear was surrounded by a vivid red glow - a color I've never seen before (back two white lights were embedded in unusual red glows). A round 6:25 PM, the four bright, white lights of the original mile-long by one-half-mile wide rectangle pattern return with two of the lights surrounded by an unusual red glow. Coming from the west at high speed with afterburners glowing w ere two F-16 jets that took off after the rectangle of lights. SIZE OF THE RED LIGHTS? Close to a large silver dollar, but only around the rear white lights. DISTINCTLY LARGER THAN THE WHITE LIGHTS?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Correct. SOME PEOPLE I’VE HEARD COMPARE SOME OF THE MYSTERIOUS AERIAL LIGHTS TO A WELDER'S MAGNESIUM TORCH. That’s a good scenario – like a welder’s torch. WHAT RED MIGHT I KNOW THAT WOULD BE CLOSE TO WHAT YOU SAW? The red lights had a glow to them. It appeared to have an outward protrusion from them like a globe scenario if you took a sphere and cut it in half – that’s how they appeared. The red was not as bright as a magnesium torch, but it was pretty bright and a really unusual color. It was dark by then, so it was very easy to track as it went off to the east. WHAT’S THE CLOSEST COMPARISON TO THE RED? I would call it a fire engine red, but with a different twist. BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS GLOWING? The way it was glowing and if you added a smidge of orange in there. It’s just no color I’ve ever seen before. It’s very unusual. Then in about three or four seconds, here comes two F-16s in pursuit chasing them at the same altitude, but the jets were not doing a very good job of catching. We watched the lights until they went out of sight about 25 miles away going east. WERE THE JETS STILL IN PURSUIT? Yes. They did have their afterburners on. Two pilot buddies of mine who live further to the east heard a double sound barrier break. That means that someone had to authorize excessive speed because breaking the sound barrier is illegal. But this was at 2,000 to 2,500 feet altitude. It’s very unusual to have military jets in our area flying that fast. AS A LONG TIME PILOT OF 30 YEARS, YOU WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR WITH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE GLEN ROSE AND STEPHENVILLE AREA, CORRECT? My dad started taking me to air shows when I was 2 and 3 years old. He’s an old military man who was a plane technician. UNTIL JANUARY 8, 2008, HAD YOU EVER SEEN F-16S TAKE OFF AFTER ANYTHING IN THE GLEN ROSE AREA LIKE YOU DID THAT NIGHT? No. Absolutely not. We are not in a military training area and it’s very seldom that you ever see one. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT ALL LASTED FROM THE TIME YOU SAW THE FOUR BRIGHT LIGHTS WITH THE TWO HALF MOON OF RED GLOWS AND THE FINAL LAST SIGHT AS THE JETS CHASED AFTER? Probably 90 seconds.” More Information: I would appreciate hearing from Stephenville, Texas, region eyewitnesses of current October 2008, strange lights as well as any other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light events in the United States and world.
