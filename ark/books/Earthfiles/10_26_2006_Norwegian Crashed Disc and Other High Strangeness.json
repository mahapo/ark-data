Stringfield. October 26, 2006 - In September 1957, Leonard H. Stringfield, finished his first book, Inside Saucer Post ... 3-0 Blue , based on his research cooperation with the U. S. Air Defense Command Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio. Len had served with the 5th U. S. Air Force and was baffled by three unidentified lights that he and other crew members saw in 1945 while being transported in a C-46 near Iwo Jima. After the war, Len Stringfield seriously began to investigate the UFO phenomena. For the next thirty-seven years, he tried to learn from firsthand sources about government cover-ups of UFO incidents and the interaction of non-human intelligences with Earth. Len died on December 18, 1994. At Earthfiles in 2003, I began reprinting with his family's permission all of the UFO Crash/Retrieval Status Reports Len wrote. Please see More Information below. The following is an excerpt from that first book after Len Stringfield collaborated with the Air Defense Command Filter Center under his assigned code name, \"3-0 Blue.\" 1952 Disc Crash in Spitsbergen, Norway "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"S pitsbergen, Svalbard Island, Norway, near Arctic. Len Stringfield: \"Another UFO landing report of world-wide significance, but apparently smothered by Norwegian authorities, was recounted in the September 5, 1955, issue of Stuttgarter Tageblatt by the Dutch publication UFO-GIDS as follows: OSLO, NORWAY, September 4, 1955 - Only now a board of inquiry of the Norwegian General Staff is preparing a publication of the report on the examination of the remains of a UFO crashed near Spitsbergen, presumably early in 1952. Chairman of the Board, Colonel Gernod Darnbyl, during an instruction lesson for Air Force officers, stated: 'The crashing of the Spitsbergen disc was highly important. Although our present scientific knowledge does not yet enable us to solve all riddles, I am confident that these remains from Spitzbergen will prove to be of utmost importance in this respect. Some time ago, a misunderstanding was caused by saying that the disc probably was of Soviet origin. The Spitsbergen disc - this we wish to state emphatically - has not been built in any country on earth. The materials used in its construction are completely unknown to all experts having participated in the investigation. According to Colonel Darnbyl, the board of inquiry is, however, not going to publish an extensive report until 'some sensational facts have been discussed with U. S. and British experts. We should reveal what we found out, as misplaced secrecy might well lead to panic.' Contrary to information from American and other sources, Second Lieutenants Brobs and Tyllensen, who have been assigned as special observers of the Arctic regions since the event at Spitsbergen, claim that flying discs have already landed in the polar regions since the event at Spitsbergen. They claim that flying discs have already landed in the polar regions several times. Said Lieutenant Tyllensen: 'I think that the Arctic is serving as a kind of air base for the unknowns, especially during snow storms when we are being forced back to our bases. Shortly after such adverse weather conditions, I have seen them land and take off on three separate occasions. I noticed then that after having landed, they execute a speedy rotation around their discs. A brilliant glow of light, the intensity of which being variable with regard to speed and at landing and take-off, prevents any view of the things happening behind this curtain of light and on or inside the disc itself.'\" [ Editor's Note: Another 1955 European UFO crash and retrieval report was contained in a special dispatch from the late columnist Dorothy Kilgallen, datelined May 23, 1955, London, England, INS, as follows: \"British scientists and airmen, after examining the wreckage of one mysterious flying ship, are convinced that these strange aerial objects are flying saucers from another planet. The source of my information is a British official of Cabinet rank. He told me: 'We believe, on the basis of our inquiries thus far, that the saucers were staffed by small men - probably under four feet. It's frightening, but there's no denying that flying saucers are from"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"another planet.' This official quoted scientists as saying a flying ship of this type could not have been constructed on Earth. The British Government, I learned, is withholding an official report on the flying saucer examination at this time, possibly because it does not want to frighten the public.\"] Pear-Shaped Craft, Red Spray and Microwaves? Back home, and as incredible as any of the freak fireballs and just as disturbing, was the grotesquerie involving a man, a peach tree, a red spray and a pear-shaped UFO with a fin. The incident occurred over Sycamore Hill, a high point near the heart of Cincinnati, July 22, 1955. The principal was Edward Mootz, a benign and non-publicity-minded man who spent much of his spare time beautifying his fabulous garden which was terraced into the hillside. One evening about 6 p.m., Mootz, alone, was tending the soil around a fruit-budding peach tree. Suddenly, from out of nowhere, Mootz was splashed by a liquid red spray, that looked like cream soda. His arms bared, but perspiring, were covered with the substance; also the nape of his neck. A billed cap prevented it hitting his f ace. Looking up, he spotted a strange object passing over heading toward Eden Park. Guessing its height to be more than 500 feet, Mootz described the object a a pear standing on end, bulbous side upward, with a metallic fin appended to the rear. The object's colors were vivid: red and green, divided at the midsection. No sound was heard. [ Editor's Note: For comparison, the August 1957 issue of APRG REPORTER reported a sighting of July 9, 1957, in Galveston, Texas in which Mrs. A. D. Suderman and her neighbor watched an object through binoculars.\"It was high in the sky, way above the sunset. I could have drawn a line between the red top and green bottom ... As it turned and moved southwest, the green disappeared and it was all red, like a large goldfish.\"] While watching the object, Mootz said that he became aware of a sharp tingling sensation on the exposed parts of his arm and neck. \"It felt like phosphorus burning into my skin and the pain was intensifying,\" Mootz said. Wasting no time, he ran to his house, removed his clothing and washed thoroughly. Mootz told me later that what saved him, in his opinion, was his heavy perspiration, which helped dilute the spray. The next morning, Mootz revisited the ill-fated spot. To his amazement, the peach tree was dead! The branches and twigs were shriveled grotesquely; the leaves curled and crisp brown; and the once-healthy buds of peaches looked like prunes. A little digging showed that the tree was killed to its very taproots - overnight! I learned of the incident a couple of weeks later and made an appointment with Mootz for an interview. It was a Sunday afternoon when Dell and I drove over. We found Mootz middle-aged, friendly and chatty. Carefully, he recounted the details of the incident, gave me samples of the mummified peaches and twigs, showed me the many white pinprick scars on his arm \"where the substance burned in,\" and finally explained that the authorities, three men, had already visited him, right after the incident and had taken away the tree and all its dead fruit. Mootz would not identify the authorities, except to say they were dressed in plain clothes and were courteous. Said Mootz: \"They promised a report of their analysis within six weeks,\" but when I checked a year later, the report had not yet arrived. In every respect Mootz was cooperative. I took 8mm movies of the vacant area where the tree had stood and of Mootz standing near it. Later I had him draw for my files impressionistic sketches of the UFO he had seen. Indeed, on paper it was strikingly different from the usual discoid UFO shape. I lost no time in getting the \"pruned\" peaches, the twigs and other chunks of root I dug up pinto the hands of a friend of mine who offered to take them to the Physics Laboratory at Villa Madonna College in Covington, Kentucky. There, elaborate tests were made, one which involved a comparison of seeds from the Mootz specimen and another provided by the lab, which had been allowed to dry out sufficiently. Under controlled conditions, only the lab seed sprouted normally. The Mootz specimen proved to be completely dehydrated! [ Editor's Note: Implication is exposure of Mootz and peach tree to heating, drying microwave radiation.] Pock-Marked Cars"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Spring 1954 introduced a new phenomenon, the glass pox. Starting in Bellingham, Washington, where 1500 windshields of automobiles suffered damage, it then spread east, effecting mostly northern cities. In most cases, the glass showed quick symptoms, one type appearing as a single pit mark, but usually in multiples, as though pelted by bee bee shot. Occasionally, in these instances, the glass fractured radially from pane to pane. In the other type, the glass assumed a honeycombed appearance; in many instances the glass was completely collapsed. Everything under the sun, including the sun, was blamed. Experts were baffled; saucerites knowingly pointed skyward. Cincinnati, always a saucer hotbed, got in the act. Many local reports reached me in 1954, including the chance to see some of the evidence. But it was not until August 29, 1955, that I thought I had a case where the poxed windshield and the saucer revealed a plausible cause-and-effect relationship. The clues of this suspected tie-in began at 3:15 p.m. when a metallic disc reflecting sunlight was reported hovering over the Ohio River. It then shot away at the approach of an airliner, which was heading toward the Greater Cincinnati Airport. In the evening, shortly before midnight, another report reached me by phone, describing a bright blue object shaped like a pear, circling over Eastern Cincinnati. I went outside wearing only shorts, looked all around with binoculars, but saw nothing. No sooner than I had retired, the phone rang again. A new voice described a pink object turning red, which had just zipped over Indian Hill. Pretty close to home, I thought. This time, dressed only in binoculars, I slipped out the side door but was again too late. Next day, my brother Jack phoned. His voice vibrated with excitement as he described what had befallen his neighbor's new 1955 Ford parked in front of his house overnight. The car's rear window was completely shattered. \"It's in a million pieces and each piece is shaped like a cube.\" Nobody could explain it, but the neighbor was plenty mad. That evening, still slightly embarrassed for having rummaged through the neighbor's ash cans, Jack brought me a shoe box full of samples. They ranged in size from half-inch cubes to larger favriform-fractured sections. I later learned from Lex Mebane of Crime Scene Investigations in New York that the favriform type of poxing, as typified in this one case, was actually no mystery at all. Mebane sums up his research into this phase as follows: \"Windows that crumble suddenly into a multitude of curve-sided, rectangular fragments are made of 'tempered' glass, which has this characteristic manner of fracture. It has been used in cars only in recent years - I don't know just when it was introduced, but it was not long before 1955. Its merit is that it s unusually strong and that when it does crack, it does not crack into the vicious triangular fragments of ordinary glass. It turns into a sort of 'sand' which is unlikely to cut anyone. This is a safety feature, introduced because cuts from broken glass are one of the most dangerous hazards of automobile accidents. With tempered glass, this hazard is eliminated. \"I am not sure whether tempered glass is used in windshields. I think laminated glass (a plastic sandwich, likewise for safety) is still used there. I am not sure why. But tempered glass is now common in rear windows. It is made by sudden chilling of hot glass. This produces a case hardening: the piece is strong, but unstable, containing locked-in tensions. When it is overstressed, it goes all to pieces in an instant. The principle is that of Prince Rupert's Drops, which are obtained by dropping molten glass into water. These are tear-drop shaped, with long, curved, tapering tails. The glass is strained, and if the tail is snapped, the drop 'explodes' into a sandy powder, disappearing before one's eyes. This phenomena is what is seen also in the sudden crumbling of rear windows. \"The question is: What has overstrained the windows and caused them to disintegrate? I have been told by people more familiar with cars than I am that even standing in the hot sun can do this. The first curved wrap-around windows are also apt to be overstrained in fastening them to the frame and might 'let go,' seemingly without cause, at almost any time. I think probably there was also some deficiency in the manufacture, at least at first. The crumbling of tempered-glass windows is not really an unusual phenomenon and it just is not the same thing as the 'glass-pox' epidemic of sudden appearance of pits on windshields. The newspapers just picked it up and confused the two events.\" Science, however, is still scratching its head over the pitting mystery. This is revealed by Irving Petite in a feature article appearing in the Seattle Sunday Times , April 14, 1957. Writes Petite: 'After three years, this mystery appears still unsolved.' He points out that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"scientists, considering all plausible theories, have agreed that the H-Bomb does not cause pocking of glass; that hydrofluoric acid etches glass smoothly; that special resins can cause chips in glass, but only under carefully controlled conditions. Suggested answers: Small black spheres from H-Bomb, meteors, or an unknown source. Petite goes on to relate that Hanford Thayer, a consultant on the wartime Manhattan Project, is still making a study of the pocked windshield phenomenon. Thayer carefully searched every square foot of the concrete street in front of his home in Seattle on April 15, 1954, during a glass-poxing incident. He found several black, pea-sized particles. One, a spheroid, is a glassy opaque substance and non-radioactive. The hard imperfect ball is believed to be the only specimen available for analysis. According to Thayer, the windshield pocking mystery is not closed!\" More Information: For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprints below from the Earthfiles Archives: Status Reports I • 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash • 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody Status Reports II • 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data Status Reports III • 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 by Leonard H.
