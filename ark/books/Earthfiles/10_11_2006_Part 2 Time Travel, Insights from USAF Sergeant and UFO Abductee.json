I'm not referring right now to the time travelers from Earth's future that are here also.\" - A bductee Linda Porter L inda Porter with her daughter, Lisa, on December 25, 1995. October 11, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The first week of March 1991, I received a brown, legal-sized envelope by Certified Mail postmarked February 28, 1991, from Porterville, California. The envelope contained an audiocassette, letter and drawings from a woman named Linda Porter. The day I received the package, I took her audiocassette to play in the car on errands. Her clear and articulate voice impressed me. Linda Porter was an educated person struggling to understand a life full of phenomena that did not fit acceptable categories of reality. She had decided it was important to reach me after hearing a conference presentation I had given in California concerning eyewitness testimony about non-human inte lligences interacting with our planet. She was concerned about her vulnerab ility as a person caught up in the human abduction syndrome and was frightened about the United States government's policy of suppressing the alien presence. Her letter began, \"We (abductees) are caught in the middle of a series of ongoing events that will one day prove to be historically significant to the future of the Earth. Unfortunately, because of our continuing, non-voluntary interactions with these beings, we have, in a sense, become victims of both sides of the phenomena. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"On the one hand, we are used by the aliens for their own purposes, whatever those purposes may be. On the other, if we speak out, we risk ridicule from the public, and in some cases, possible harassment and/or intimidation by government and military personnel.\" \"The people who live on the Earth, those who will survive the (destructive) changes (to come), will be evolving into a new species of being. ... I'm not referring right now to the time travelers from Earth's future that are here also. That was something that was necessary because Earth governments got hold of a dangerous technology that greatly altered Earth's future for the worse. Remember the mistake that was made that I told you about awhile back. Some type of technology fell into the wrong hands and the (future) travelers were sent back in time to change that. Don't know if it has been changed. At least not yet. But that was an entire side-bar to evolution that was never meant to happen.\" Linda Porter was the first of half a dozen people in the human abduction syndrome I met meet and interviewed who described human body cloning and \"soul transfers\" under the control of non-human entities. (See more information and drawings in my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness .) She told me that grey beings demonstrated the cloning and soul transfer process before it was also done to Linda because her heart was fa iling. The person she watched was a man who died on a table in the presence of a grey entity. From the man's upper torso and head emerged a golden-yellow-orange light, elongated in the air as it moved across the room into a lighted tube that contained a cloned body of the man about a decade younger. Linda understood there was a confusing problem about Earth body containers, souls, other dimensions and altered time lines. Linda Porter: \"I was told that the (resurrected) cloned man would be relocated elsewhere (maybe Australia) and would continue on with his life. (Linda thought it was vital to the non-human entities that the man's soul continue functioning longer inside the same kind of \"container\" that his older, sick body had been.) Part of the reason they take tissue samples from abductees when they are quite young is to have this tissue in reserve in case a new body (for abductee) becomes necessary later on.

Drawing © 1991 by Linda Porter. \"New bodies can be stored indefinitely. The containers in the sketch with the three people in the tubes are storage containers. The containers in both new sketches I sent you are 'activation' containers. They have a light in the top that must be on the person for (unknown) amount of hours before a body can be activated - if a body has been in storage. If newly made, it does not need light. In the sketch with the three people in the tubes, the body on the far right was the (younger) one given to the (dying) man. L inda Porter said she was taken by a \"grey scientist\" to a room where three people were in tubes. She felt the people were alive, but in a state of suspended animation, and that the man on far right was the younger clone activated by a \"soul transfer\" from his previous older body (dying man). Drawing ©1991 by Linda Porter. \"I got the impression, the aliens do not like to do this soul transfer very often. Actually, I got the feeling the aliens are not supposed to be doing this at all . \"But they seemed to be backed into a corner and have no other recourse. They also seem to be trying to hide all this from some 'higher' form of life - whatever the 'authority' is that prohibits this soul transfer also prohibits them from interfering on this planet. (?) Whoever it is, is much higher evolved than they are and wields a great deal of power over many, many other realms of existence. \"There is much, much more to existence than we could ever begin to understand. Much of what we have been taught regarding the physical universe and the laws that govern it is wrong. \"This creature's civilization communicates difficult concepts via the use of symbols that radiate emotion. They use this form to get concepts across with their exact true meanings intact. No misinterpretations can occur this way. \"The symbols are not mathematical ones, but appear as 3-dimensional holographic pictures that resemble abstract sculptures. The emotional aspect is relayed via carrier waves that resemble sound waves, but are not part of the human sound spectrum. These waves can be felt, but not heard. If the creatures want to clear a certain area of humans, they can 'broadcast' this carrier wave over the area at a certain frequency and it will create intense fear in people, causing them to flee the area. It does not cause any harm, so they say. [ Howe's Note: Most humans cannot hear frequencies below 125 hertz, or above 10,000 hertz.] \"The universe is built on sound patterns, which is why so many different worlds/dimensions can exist in the same space. Each is on a different"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"frequency. Disrupt a world/dimension to the point that you destroy the carrier wave it exists on and you have created a 'hole' in existence that cannot support the dimension above or below it. Each frequency, besides maintaining its own world/dimension, also supports - or holds in place - the one above it and below it. Everything is interdependent! \"There are countless worlds/dimensions occupying the same space without being aware of one another because of having their own individual octaves. This octave/frequency holds the world/dimension in place and causes it to exist safely without interfering with (or even being aware of) other worlds around it. This frequency acts as a buffer zone to keep everything in its place. Do anything to disrupt it and you begin a collapse that starts a deadly chain reaction. If the density of this collapse reaches a certain weight, space/time itself begins to collapse. \"Whatever the experiment is that our government is involved with in outer space, (if successful) it will change the density of matter to such an extent that the chain reaction started will not be able to be st opped by anybody in any world/dimension! \"There are literally hundreds of different alien life forms here trying to stop what is happening as it is putting their own worlds at risk. Some, as I had mentioned in earlier letters, are not supposed to be interfering, but are doing so anyway. What they are all trying to do is stop the 'ripple effect' that will emanate outward from Earth should this (government) experiment succeed. \"With all their technology, Linda, why don't the aliens - or their superiors - just walk in and stop the whole thing themselves? Why do they need us abductees to speak for them? Something just doesn't make any sense. I wonder if we are being lied to, used for some purpose to put over ideas they want us to believe? If there is an experiment, maybe if it succeeds, it will put us in competition with the aliens for something they don't want to share. Maybe they're trying to 'scare' us out of 'their' neighborhood.\" More Information: F or further information about time travel, UFOs and human abductees, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archives and my books, An Alien Harvest; the 2-volume book Glimpses of Other Realities; and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop. • 09/29/2006 -- Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks • 08/13/2006 -- Part 1: Three Crop Formations Near Uffington White Horse • 03/25/2005 -- Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time • 11/03/2004 -- Gen.
