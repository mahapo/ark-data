It all began with the publication of my book, Situation Red, The UFO Siege (Doubleday, 1977) in which I made references to reported crashes of UFOs and the recovered alien bodies. In surprising response, information relative to 'retrievals' surfaced from new sources. This led me to July 29, 1978, the day I stepped up to the lectern as guest speaker at the MUFON ninth annual Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, to deliver my paper, 'Retrievals of the Third Kind,' pointedly subtitled, 'A Case Study "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody.' Since Dayton, new informants continue to emerge. People, like my earlier firsthand contacts, who want no open, active part in UFO research. Independent from each other, they ever so cautiously share sensitive information about their alleged roles in a retrieval operation. Or they claim to have been in an authoritative position to have seen the deceased humanoid entities under a variety of 'need to know' circumstances. One of my most enduring and informative contacts is medical. Others formerly served in the C.I.A. and in key positions of the military. Indeed, the knowledge I have gained since my book from diverse, credible sources is extraordinary. It is beyond the scope of this paper to review all the behind-the-scene events prior to and since the Dayton affair. However, I hasten to say that what began as a simple research report, featuring an update on alleged or legendary retrievals of crashed saucers and little men, soon gave way to a venture into seeming fantasy. The more I probed into old and new leads, the deeper I became enmeshed in an inconsistent world of real people on one end; on the other, the unreal tales they told. Just as unreal, or so it seems, were some of my own experiences during these probes. One, no longer a hushed incident, was my close encounter with a 'phantom' force at the Dayton symposium. There, before going on stage, my life was twice threatened. On both occasions word came through an intermediary, once by phone at 4:30 a.m. on July 29, 1978; the other by physical confrontation just moments before my address that day. Uninformed of the threats, I spoke for nearly two hours. However, the moment I finished, I was suddenly whisked off stage by three armed plainclothesmen with walkie talkies, escorted to the Stouffer Hotel, where I held a prearranged press conference, then again escorted to my room which was in the process of being changed with a lady tenant on the far end of the hotel - an order not placed by me. I was advised not to reveal my new room number to anyone and not to leave its premises. In effect, until dinnertime, I was detained incommunicado. I missed everyone I had arranged to see, including a medical person with information. A real threat? Or a scare tactic? To this day, it is unclear if I was being protected from a lunatic adversary, or if the whole episode was a ploy to deflect potential informants in the audience from reaching me. I had indications beforehand while preparing my 'Retrieval\" paper that someone connected with the C.I.A. was concerned about some of my sensitive material and how far I might go with it. He advised that the use of some data in my possession could be risky and for my own safety, I 'should always stay in crowds.' Months later, the same C.I.A. employee, who had been helpful in many ways, said he had the answer for the threats in Dayton. Investigation, he said, showed that it was all a part of the shenanigans of a movie studio who possessed secret documents and film about the retrieved craft and entities. Fearing that I would steal their thunder before their release date, they tried to intimidate me into canceling my talk. Whatever the intent of my would-be-assailant or of the Intelligence Community, my role and objectives in research have since changed. to me, the key to truth lies in what we may call the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. Lights in the sky, close encounters of all kinds, and even the grotesquerie of abduction cases have all lost priority. Time, with its influx of new data from new and old reliable sources, now affirms my belief that beyond my fingertips - and perhaps forever unreachable - is the evidence extraordinaire: the alien cadavers and the craft. In my opinion, if all the officially suppressed information were released suddenly in one package, it could have an unpredictable psychological but profound philosophical impact on mankind. But no matter how it would be released, I also believe that the human mind has been so conditioned to stress since World War II that a worldwide Wellesian panic is not likely. For the record, no one in UFO research, the media or the scientific community has been privy to share certain portions of my cumulative data. thus, they understandably remain skeptical. The whole story of my experience in this endeavor may never be told, mainly because of the sensitivity of some of the names, places and subject matter. To stress a point in summary: I know firsthand that my continued quest for UFO crash/retrieval information is a venture that can be as risky and frustrating as it is rewarding. Through patience, keeping confidences, and playing the game in a posture of low profile, I feel at this writing that I have progressed substantially since my first paper in gathering new, vital and corroborative information. Unlike my first paper, this one draws principally on information collected from firsthand sources. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Status Report II will not attempt to correct a number of errors that appeared in my first paper. However, it is important for the record that exceptions should be made relative to three of the original Abstracts: - In Abstract #1, the year of the incident should be corrected to read 1950, not 1948. Other amended data concerning this case I understand will be revealed by researcher, Todd Zechel, through other media. - In Abstract #8, the retrieval incident dated 1973 should be corrected to read 1953. - In Abstract #21, Seymour-Johnson, a Navy Training Station, should be corrected to read: Seymour-Johnson Air Force Base, located in Goldsboro, North Carolina, not Norfolk, Virginia. My goal in this phase of research is to obtain information from the firsthand source. Such prime material used in this monograph is specified as Class 'A,' and is recorded as Cases A-1 through A-10 in the text. New leads, or other pertinent material, are presented as Class 'B,' which are recorded as Items B-1 through B-14. It should be noted that many abstracts appearing in my first paper, 'Retrievals of the third Kind,' are of the Class B type and are not included for review in this monograph. CASE A-1 During the summer of 1977, I was asked by a local business executive, a former U. S. Naval Intelligence Officer, to speak on the UFO at the September 1st meeting of the Cincinnati Chapter of the World Wings held in the Administration Building of Cincinnati's Lunken Airport. During the question and answer period following my talk, one member of a group of 25 pilots arose and brought up the legendary subject of recovered alien UFOs and occupants. His comment, I thought, indicated that he was unusually well-informed on the matter. So I asked that he stand by for a chat later. When the crowd finally disassembled, he led me to the privacy of a back room which was dominated by a huge topographical map of the United States. Staring at the map he said bluntly, 'I have seen the bodies.' Still looking at the map and noting my protracted silence, he pointed vaguely to an area inside the state of Arizona. 'There's approximately where the saucer crashed,' he said. 'It was in a desert area, but I don't know the exact location. I'm almost positive it happened in 1953.' The pilot was my first encounter with a firsthand witness. As he stood at the map with a straight-on glance, he impressed me as a person who is sincere and forthright, possessing a no-nonsense character. 'I saw the bodies at Wright-Patterson,' he said. 'I was in the right place at the right time when the crates arrived at night by DC-7.' As we lingered at the map, he recalled that he had stood inside a hangar at a distance of about 12 feet, peering at five crates on a forklift. In his judgment, the crates appeared to be hastily constructed and were made of wood. In three of these, little humanoids appearing to be 4 feet tall were lying unshrouded on a fabric, which he explained prevented freeze burn from the dry ice packed beneath. As a number of Air Police stood silent guard near the crates, he managed to get a reasonably good but brief glimpse of the humanoid features. He recalls that their heads were hairless and narrow. By human standards, the heads were disproportionately large with skin that looked brown under the hangar lights above. The eyes seemed to be open. The mouth small and nose, if any, was indistinct. The arms were positioned down alongside their bodies. But the hands and feet, he said, were indistinct. When asked about their attire, he said they appeared to be wearing tight-fitting dark suits. Because of the tight-fitting suit, there was one revealing feature - a surprising feature. One of the humanoids appeared to him to be female. He said, 'Either one of the aliens had an exceedingly muscular chest or the bumps were a female's breasts.' Later, he learned from one of the crew members with whom he bunked at the barracks that the body of one of the aliens was believed to be that of a female. My informant also heard from the crew member that one of the entities was still alive aboard the craft when the United States military team arrived. Attempts were made to save its life with oxygen, but they were unsuccessful. Another issue, an important one: How was the military able to track the crash? Said my informant: The crew member told him that the UFO was picked up by special tracking equipment at Mt. Palomar in California. My informant claimed that he had later heard a report that the retrieved craft, found intact, was also sent to Wright- Patterson. He had no more details as to when or by what means. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"COMMENT: I have had a dozen or more private talks with my firsthand informant since our initial meeting as reported in Abstract #8 of my first paper. During this period, I knew him as a dedicated family man and by occupation to be an engineer. He had also made several trips to Wright-Patterson for treatment of a medical disability. Without notice, in the Fall of 1978, he and his family moved away leaving no forwarding address. His military career was extensive, having served as Warrant Officer in the Army during which time he was assigned to Wright-Patterson. My informant seemed well informed about the UFO, but had never desired to participate in open research to share his knowledge. In my opinion, he seemed to be keenly aware and able to separate fact from rumor. Of the latter, he heard that a UFO (foo fighter) had been retrieved in England by the 8th Air Force during World War II. Having a top security clearance, he claimed to have seen photos at Wright- Patterson of a retrieved UFO and a close-up showing strange glyphs on its body which he described as looking like Sanskrit. He was also aware of the consequences of talking too much about secret subjects and often referred to reprisals such as confinement at a base in the U. S. which he dubbed the 'Turkey Farm.' [ Editor's Note: Sanskrit is a classical Indian language and the parent of the Indo-Aryan languages. Sanskrit is still used as literary and liturgical language by about 200,000 people. ] In August 1978, I requested an affidavit or a tape describing his 1953 experience for my private records. He declined because of his oath of secrecy. I then asked for a posthumous statement. His response was that he would have to check with his Security Officer. Belatedly he got the expected answer: 'You have seen nothing, heard nothing, and you sure as s--- can sign nothing!' That was the final word. According to my informant, plus the testimony of two secondhand witnesses described in Abstracts #6 and #7 of my first paper, 1953 was either an active year for several UFO crashes; or all three were describing one event. All three describe the area of impact in a desert region and two named Arizona as the site.\" Continued in Part 2 - Case A-2, 1973, Non-human bodies Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
