While his mystique has produced a few 'Henry Watchers' who wonder about his real role in the UFO drama or his unabashed ways to get a compromising response from sensitive sources such as Dr. Eric Walker, others praise him for his exposure of a con-artist in the South African crash/retrieval affair. Now, into Soviet UFO affairs, he combines his wherewithal, with author Bruce Cathie of New Zealand to submit the following report from Valerey Dvuzhilnyi of the USSR: Valery Dvuzhilnyl, USSR: 'On Saturday, November 28, 1987, thirty-three UFOs were flying at a low altitude over the eastern coast of Primorye. Their flight took place between 9 - 10 p.m. and midnight. Different types of UFOs could be seen amongst them: cylinder, cigar and globe-shape. They were flying over five regions and well over twelve settlements. Witnesses thought they saw an aircraft crashing. Everyone of them were surprised to hear no noise associated. Inquiries made by the investigators later showed that there had been no flights of either civilian or military aircraft at that time. No carrier-rockets had been launched either from Soviet cosmodromes. The same was the situation on the previous occasion on January 29, 1986. The objects observed had absolutely nothing in common with the effects of rocket- launching, which are quite different. They were not like fire-balls or ball-lightning or plasmoids either. Weather report on November 28, 29 and 30, 1987, indicated no clouds or precipitation. Wind factor: Northwest, 7 m/s, direction 320 degrees. The direction of the wind did not coincide with the direction of flight path of UFOs. There was no thunder flows either. Ball-lightning is exceedingly rare in that region. Out of thirty-three UFOs, thirteen flew over Dal' negorsk, four over Rudnaya Pristan, various other settlements reported seeing one UFO each. The conclusion would be that their prime target was Dal' negorsk. UFOs flew as if having one collective objective. They changed course, direction, speed, rounded the mountains, flew over river valleys. The low altitude at which they were flying made radar tracking impossible. Their path gave the impression that they were directed by an intelligent mind. The low altitude might have served as a radar camouflage. This happened 23 months after the report of a damaged UFO in 1986, over Mount 611. There five objects hovered over Dal' negorsk, and one over "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rudnaya Pristan. Those hovering over Dal' negorsk lit the area with the pulsating lights and searchlights. It appeared as though they were looking for something, maybe for the UFO which had crashed in 1986, or its traces and studying the size and the volume of the catastrophe. It is quite possible that the damaged UFO was an automatically controlled scout probe. It was about 0,5 x 1.5 meters in diameter. Such small craft are not necessarily made or delivered from the outer space. They could have been made on Earth, with the available elements. It has been proved by the isotope analysis of the lead that it belongs to the mineral deposit in the Northern Pribaikalye. The lead might have been used to repair the UFO, or for refueling the power, or plasma engine installation. The nature of iron isotopes is not clear yet to whether it is cosmic or terrestrial. The fact that the visitors from space apply technology on our planet, including metal extraction from terrestrial ores and utilize them, has been proven by the following evidence: 1978, geologist Popov found a piece of metal plate five kilometers away from Dal' negorsk. Its dimensions were 1 x 0.70 x 0.60 meters. It was four to six inches thick. (Note: A similar plate was found in North American Arctic region in 1950s and examined by Canadian engineer, Wilbert Smith. A larger chunk of it, by mistake, was sent to Japan to be recycled because of its purity.) One of the authors climbed that mountain seven times in pursuit of some samples, but without any success. Eventually, when this author went to seek Popov's assistance, he found out that four days before, Popov had died of a heart attack. The same was the fate of the head of the lab analyzing the plate in question and its composition. Eventually, a piece of the plate was found in a private collection. The disappearance of the main chunk of the plate in itself is a puzzle! The plate was made of zinc. Its weight might have been no less than a half a ton, meaning that it could have been shifted by the help of a crane or several individuals. Further inquiries at the enterprises and firms in Dal' negorsk yielded no results. Nobody had ever seen the plate or heard of it. The chemical analysis of the plate-sample proved to be unusual. It contained no cadmium, one of the components of zinc. The purest zinc is considered to contain 0.02% cadmium. Besides, there was too little silver in it. The local plants never melted zinc of this kind or molded plates of this size. Also, it is impossible to make zinc by primitive methods. It is made only by electro- thermic treatment without oxygen. Also, in several incidents, the UFO samples or the photofilm pictures results of some analyses have been missing without any logical explanations, indicating that the organization is under some sort of control. Thus far, four people had witnessed the disappearance of a large piece of the sample from Mount 611. A piece of ceramic crucible with a sample disappeared in the powdery metal industry laboratory. It fell down on the floor and simply vanished. Our colleagues in Tomsk failed to find the quartz thread. In April, a tight plate of quartz threads vanished in Vladisvostok. It was placed in the electronic microscope. It occurred after filling the vacuum with god dust. It seems that UFOs aim to lead all scientific research into a dark alley and nonsense. The next sign of their technology is a discovery of chrome alloy in Dal' negorsk, and near Kavalerovo. It contains 96% chrome, 0.11% nickel, 0.5% aluminum, 0.29% iron, 0.002% silver, 0.00029% gold, 0.06% cobalt, 0.003% cadmium, 0.007% copper, 0.008 zinc, 0.01 manganese. The results of the spectral analysis are as follows: lithium 1%, calcium 1.3%, arsenic 1%, silicon 1%, scandium 0.005%. The rest of the elements, with very small percentage, are platinum, lantanium, strontium, iridium, renium. The composition is highly unusual due to the fact that there are no chrome deposits in the Far East of USSR. Secondly, the industries have never made chrome of this composition. The sample found in Dal' negorsk is a shapeless lump. It weighs about 50 60 kilograms and is non-magnetic, while the sample found in Kavalerovo is highly magnetic. Number of UFO landing sites have been examined in that region. The mountain rock and metal samples are found"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to be highly magnetic in these sites. The space debris from Sputniks, space rockets and aircraft are known to be non-magnetic. We consider the hypothesis of V. Salnikov, a candidate of geological and mineralogical sciences from Tomsk to be invalid and groundless. Salnikov believes that the cause for the destruction on Mount 611, on January 29, 1986, was a natural plasmoid. This could be refuted because: 1. The time during which the destruction occurred was one hour. Plasma is known to exist for several seconds only. It could not fly having 60 grams of various metals (titanium, natrium, iron and some other element). 2. Ionic plasma substance could not have created large pieces of lead weighing about 4 5 grams each. There were eight such pieces. Ionic plasma could have created only dust-like metals. 3. It is impossible to collect or absorb 60 grams of lead and iron during the flight. The atmospheric concentration should have been 4,000 times as much as maximum limit. There are no concentrations of this kind even near the furnaces. 4. While destroying plasmoid could not have magnetized flints. It could have caused only high temperatures. So, is it possible that on November 28, 1987, a great number of UFOs were searching for the damaged UFO on January 29, 1986? After all, they were hovering in the sky sending searchlights on the ground. The tops of the mountains and hills in the northwest direction. Probably, before its destruction, it had sent a powerful signal into space. The crash spot might have been spotted by the UFOs flying over Dal' negorsk on November 28, 1987. It was discovered thanks to six spots of magnetic flint. Four UFOs were registered to have flown over Mount 611. On February 6, 1986, eight days after the UFO crash, there appeared from the north two yellow globes at 8:30 p.m. They approached the crash site, made four circle runs over the area and disappeared with a flash (of light). The mass appearance of UFOs on November 28 was sighted by workers, representatives of intelligentsia, militiamen, military men. In all, over 100 people witnessed the 33 sightings. These objects caused a two minutes cutting off of HF TV circuits, telegraph lines and other appliances. Computers were also cut off. Their programs spoiled. The cause was the presence of very powerful electromagnetic field caused by the presence of UFOs. Incandescent lamps and 220 volt circuits were not affected by this EM field. 93% of UFOs appear when the moon is full or new. When the moon is in perigee, it is closer to Earth. The isotope (lead) analysis have proved that it is neither of space nor of Dal' negorsk origin. Its age is identical to those of Kholodnenskoye lead deposit regions, North Baikal. Doctor U. Pooshkarev (Geology, Leningrad) corroborated the idea of secret UFO exploitations of Kholodnenskoye lead deposit for their own purposes. The lead could be used as the plasma engine fuel. The holes in the lead balloons are identical to those from industry plasma plants. It seems that they do not require to carry large quantity of lead during their flights, if there is a possibility to exploit certain regions of the Earth surface. That means they have vast knowledge about our mineral deposits. Certain efforts have been made to determine their mining capabilities and technology applied. There are some holes made by laser rays. Their diameter is about two inches. One can see vitrification of the hole edges. (Editor's Note: Vitrification cools substances to form a glass without disturbing their structure.) Also, an unknown chromium alloy has been found. One of the patterns is magnetized. The magnetization is identical to the pattern from the Mount 611. This magnetization is indicative of a super-power electromagnetic field created by UFOs. These fields seem to have some significant relevance in their propulsion systems. The 'netting' pattern observed in the sample is almost impossible to investigate, even with the most up-to-date devices. It is carbon in glassy condition. Absolutely amorphous, with separately standing atoms of 5 - 18 elements. It is not dissolved in any acid. If one tries to put it in the liquid nitrogen, it is attracted by the magnet though the ferrum is perfectly covered. It is impossible to find out the cause of these magnetic properties. The presence of high percentage of potassium (K) and sodium (Na) in the samples might be caused by the UFOs' thermonuclear reactions. But, these reactions"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"are ecologically clean. They could not have caused the radiation of the soil. The UFO which made a crash landing on January 29, 1986, was spotted at 7:55 p.m. Its speed was 15 m/s. The unidentified object seen over Dal' negorsk (Soviet Union) on January 29, 1986, at 7:55 p.m., had a solid cover that was ball-like and was stainless steel color. It did crash land at the altitude of 611 meters, leaving behind samples of steel alloys, ferrous balls, and the so-called 'netting' type samples. It also had strange effects on the humans, animals and radio sets. The samples of ferrous balls have a very high degree of solidity. It could not be cut by steel instruments, but only by diamond. These have very complex composition. They contain almost all the elements in the Mandeleyev table, such as Fe (iron), Mn (Manganese), Ni (Nickel), Mo (Molybdenum), W ( Tungsten ), and SiO2 (Silica dioxide, or quartz sand), Co (Cobalt), Cr (Chromium). Whence melted in the vacuum, strange glass-like structures appear. The carbides of the metal elements are absent. View of alleged UFO crash site on hilltop in Dal' negorsk, eastern Siberia.

As mentioned before, the sample of the 'netting' element is made of amorphous carbonaceous materials with metal atoms standing separately. The basic elements carbon basis, Zn (Zinc), Ag, Au, La, Pr, Si, Na, K, Co, Ni, Y and many others. It is almost impossible to interpret its structure. It resists the acids. When a temperature of 2800 Centigrade is applied to it in the air, some elements would disappear and new elements appear instead. In vacuum heating, gold, silver and nickel disappeared and molybdenum and beryllium sulfide appeared. The latter disappeared after five months. This does prove, however, that we are dealing with artificial materials. The great quantity of organic matter might be the sign of a type of life still unknown to us. Before the heat application, the 'netting' is a dielectric substance. During the course of the heating, it becomes a semi-conductor and in vacuum heating, it is a conductor. After three years, the site of this incident still has some effect on the humans. It effects the blood and causes reduction in leukocyte and bacilli increase. It also causes high blood pressure, fast pulse and sense of unknown fear. The site still affects the film imprint and simply erases it. The flint samples collected from the site are magnetized. But to magnetize a flint is as impossible as magnetizing a brick!\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The site suffered a temperature of 4,000 C. during the crash, and the radiation of an unknown nature. Vegetation are still affected by this radiation. The chemical composition of the steel alloy and the iron corresponds with the high content in peat after the Tunguska so-called meteorite aerial explosion (June 30, 1908): Pr (Praseodymium), La (Lanthanum), Y (Yttrium), Pb (Lead), Zn (Zinc), Fe (Iron). The type of the radiation is identical. It is obvious that we are dealing with a spacecraft of an unknown civilization. Although the 1987 sighting of 33 UFOs were traced as far back as Sea of Japan and 13 of them passed over Dal' negorsk, hovering and illuminating the site of the incident with their searchlights which gave the impression that they were looking for something. But more importantly, there was the report of a landing in January 1989, only 200 meters from the actual place of incident. In our research of these series of incidents, we have employed computers, laser microscopes and good professional advice by the scientists in various fields. Analyses were conducted by professionals. In four of the 'netting' samples, alpha-quartz threads were found. Their thickness is 17 microns. They were rolled up in an accurate plait and fused into the netting. The gold wire was inside every thread. Such technology and precision is just impossible for our present technological capability of our civilization. They might serve as a microcable in orientation system. Quartz is an ideal insulator and gold is an excellent conductor. Despite the Earth Light theory, it is proved that UFOs do fly over the geological fractures. It is quite possible that they do harness the released energy from these magnetic lines. An advanced civilization could easily use the fracture energy as natural radio-range beacons and fly with their help in any weather condition. Today, we, too, can determine these fractures with the help of up-to-date sensors or registering devices. These devices can sense fracture energy spaced around our landmarks. As it is widely known, fracture energy has existed for millions of years. Dal' negorsk fracture is a meridian type, dating back to Triassic period. It would not be impossible to assume that this unknown civilization has had the surface charts - not the parallel meridian charts. One with fracture coordinates system. Those charts could have been obtained from the ancient times by paleocontacts to serve their purpose today.\" Len Stringfield: If Valery Dvuzhilnyl's (USSR) disclosure, like Popovich's, is based on factual data, it is significant for several reasons:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1. That it provides a rare peak into the technological and/or physical aspect of the UFO phenomena. 2. That it might be a signal that more information can be expected to surface as a result of the newborn freedom of a former powerful and suppressive adversary (nation). 3. That it might be a subtly planned forerunner of information to be 'trickled out' by world governments who now believe that the UFO is serious business - or even a threat. 4. That it might be a stratagem by the Soviets to put pressure on the Western bloc nations to be more open and less oppressive in their joint policy which enforces maximum secrecy designed to hide the truth about UFOs.\" Continued in Part 18 - South African UFO Crash/Retrieval Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
