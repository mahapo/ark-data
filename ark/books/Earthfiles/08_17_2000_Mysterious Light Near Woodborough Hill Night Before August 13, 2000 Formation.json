Also see: http://www.cropcircleconnector.com August 17, 2000 Woodborough Hill, Near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England - This past Saturday night of August 12, 2000, around 10:30 PM, three of us had climbed Wiltshire's famous Woodborough Hill which has been a central focus for crop formations since the phenomenon seriously began on a global scale in 1990. With me was Andrew J. Buckley, a graphic artist from Manchester, England, and his friend, Hazel. Andy had videotaped six small, white, glowing lights moving over the wheat field between Woodborough Hill and Pickled Hill on July 18th and wanted to visit again to see if any more would turn up. Map of Woodborough Hill and Pickled Hill near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England. Field between the two hills had large, new crop formation on Sunday morning, August 13, after strange unidentified light seen prior to midnight on August 12, 2000. His videotape not only shows at least six mysterious lights clearly, but his camera was taping as a Puma helicopter, perhaps from either the Royal Air "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Force or Army, moved quickly into the field where the lights were. At the appearance of the helicopter, the first white lights disappeared. After the helicopter had circled twice over the crop and left, more white lights returned traveling across the field where the August 13, 2000 formation would later emerge. At one point on Andy's tape, one of the lights splits in two in a single video frame which is 1/30th of a second. I had with me 7 x 35 Bushnell binoculars and an ITT Night Vision F6015 scope with infrared capability that \"sees\" heat. Its lens magnification was 3x. Andy had a Panasonic video camera and tripod. The nearly full moon cast so much light that through the Night Vision scope, I could clearly see individual stalks of wheat in the ripe field that lay below us between Woodborough Hill and Pickled Hill to the east. When Andy walked down the hill many yards away towards the wheat at one point, I could clearly recognize his face in the starscope. As I scanned down the tramlines created by the farmer's tractor, they were empty. No one was in the field and we were the only people on Woodborough Hill. I had handed the Night Vision scope to Hazel so she could see how clearly it both magnified objects and showed them almost as if it were daylight because of its ability to gather light from the stars and moon to enhance visibility in the dark. I had in fact been using the scope earlier in August when there was no moon and fog covered the hills, yet light and heat sources stood out clearly, including a pulsing and still unidentified object that jumped from point to point and grew much brighter when seven of us spoke. For more about that incident, see upcoming Earthfile's report about the unidentified pulsing light in the West Stowell field. While Hazel was looking through the scope, I was looking through my binoculars to scan the northern horizon of hills that stretch in an east to west direction in the Vale of Pewsey. One of those hills, Golden Ball Hill, has a cluster of trees at its top. Above those trees, I suddenly saw an orange color that was distinctly different than any other object in the sky. The object was round and stationary. Drawing by Linda Moulton Howe of unidentified aerial object as seen through magnifying binoculars from Woodborough Hill, Wiltshire, England around 10:30 PM above the trees atop nearby Golden Ball Hill to the north. To the naked eye without binoculars, it appeared the size of a bright orange star. The quality of the orange light reminded me of the halo that surrounds laser beams. Embedded inside the round, orange halo were two lights. One was very yellow and seemed embedded in the middle of the orange object on the left side. A little lower, smaller, and to the right was a white light. There seemed to be a shimmering interaction between the yellow and white lights. I asked Hazel and Andy to look where my binoculars were pointing to see what they could see. Hazel found the object in the Night Vision scope and said it was"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"round and had two hot spots within a round haze in the green-gray monochromatic image typical of night vision scopes. Inexplicably, the Night Vision scope with infrared sensitivity gave Hazel the impression that the light on the right was bigger than the one on the left, but she could not see colors. Hazel and I kept describing for each other what we were seeing through our respective different lenses - mine binoculars, hers the night vision scope - while Andy started setting up his video camera on a tripod. He confirmed that he could see with his unaided eyes an orange glow low in the northern sky above Golden Ball Hill. After several seconds, Hazel and I both said at the same time, \"It's blinked out. Just disappeared.\" I was looking at a black space and Hazel could not see any trace of the object that had been there. If it were an aerial craft, logic says it would have heat that the infrared scope would still be able to register even if the lights were shut off. The complete absence of any image in the night vision scope implied that when the orange object blinked out, it was also not there physically. But to where did it \"pop out?\" Hazel and I kept our lenses on the spot where the orange object had been, waiting for several seconds. Then to my amazement, a sparkle of intense fire engine red literally burst into the top of my binoculars frame resembling a Fourth of July sparkler, pulsed out and immediately appeared in the far left of the frame as another intense red sparkle burst, pulsed out and immediately appeared in the bottom of the frame as a silver-white sparkle burst. This sequence continued with the three red, red, white bursts in counter-clockwise rotation in the same stationary position we had seen the orange glowing object. Graphic depiction by Linda Howe of the \"Fourth of July sparkler\" bursts in bright red and white that pulsed counter-clockwise at a rapid rate in same location that the orange object disappeared. Then, Andy said he could see the red flashes and was getting his camera on a tripod and focused on it. Almost simultaneously, the pulsing flashes began to move to my left, or west over Knap Hill and on down the chain of hills. Its motion was not rapid, but steadily moving south. Hazel could see the pulses without seeing their colors in the Night Vision scope. Andy finally got his lens on the moving object again and videotaped three seconds before the pulsing object went behind a dark cloud. We waited for it to come out, but the unidentified object never appeared again. In those three seconds of tape, Andy said the sparkles are covering a large area of the sky compared to the typical blinking lights of an airliner. He said that even though the sequence is short, it is very similar to a longer videotaped sequence he photographed last August 1999 when several of us watched sparkles pulsing in a counter-clockwise rotation from several locations at and around Woodborough Hill. But the color then was sky blue and white, not red and white. We stayed on top of Woodborough Hill August 12th until near midnight. We continually looked into the ripe field between us and Pickled Hill with the Night"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Vision scope. The tramlines remained empty and the field was a solid mass of standing wheat except for one small circle near the grassy top of Woodborough Hill that had appeared earlier in the season. So, it was almost shocking to learn the next morning that a large, complicated pattern was discovered in that same wheat field by Ulrich Kox from Germany who was driving around looking for new crop formations. I immediately returned to Woodborough Hill where the new formation was sculpted in standing and flattened crop covering about 250 feet in diameter.

Photograph taken with help of Bob Nicholas © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe. Could it have been created between midnight and sunrise as some people claim who champion the human-made theory? Or did the strange orange light that transformed into the red and white pulses have something to do with the creation? The mysterious lights and their link to crop formations are a global phenomenon and not confined to Woodborough Hill or Wiltshire, England. So, what was behind the press release in the second week of August from former British resident and now American-based researcher, Colin Andrews, asserting that at least 80% of crop formations are human-made without any hard evidence to back up the statistical claim? Was he talking only about Wiltshire? Is a counter- intelligence unit trying to deliberately claim hoaxes in order to confuse the public and media again as Doug and Dave did back in September 1991? Finally, if even the human circle makers agree that at least 20% of the global crop circle phenomenon is unexplained, who - or what - has been creating symbols and patterns with repeating mathematical themes in fields around this planet for more than a decade? And why?
