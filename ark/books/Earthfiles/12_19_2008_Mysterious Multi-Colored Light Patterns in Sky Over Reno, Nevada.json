Her photographs are very similar to the videotape by David Caron near the Stephenville, Texas, Airport on January 19, 2008. See hot links to other Earthfiles reports in More Information. What are these multi-colored light patterns on video and still cameras? The Caron video (hot link after Reno images) shows an out-of-focus, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky from which the multi-colored patterns begin projecting outward for several minutes, changing shape every one-half second on the 30-frames-per-second videotape. Some dismissed the Caron videotape as an electronic glitch in his digital video camera. But the other multi-colored light patterns in the variety of geographical regions have all been photographed with digital still cameras. The Reno, Nevada, resident says in her email below, “I do know the light was there for several days before I photographed it.” R ed circle is Reno, Nevada. Straight south, the red star is the location of Washoe Valley. “Subject: Object Over Reno Date: December 18, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Hello Linda, I love your work and I thought that I would share this info with you to see if you might be interested. The photos were taken Dec. 10th, 2008, Wednesday night, and it was after 9:00 p.m. My daughter helped with this as she had just come back from visiting her boyfriend and saw me hanging off the second floor balcony. This angle looks southeast over the Washoe Valley. I haven't taken time to travel around the valley to see if the angle changes, too busy for Christmas. I do know the light was there for several days before I photographed it. The clouds are up and I can't tell if it's around now. But I can say the last time the night sky was clear, it was still there. My daughter and I had noticed a rather bright light over the Reno valley for several days. Thinking it may be a star we fairly ignored it until we noticed that it seemed to have different colors showing, but it was still hard to see. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I finally photographed the mysterious light with my digital camera and was surprised to see colored light patterns similar to the ones that were taken in Stephenville, Texas during the mass sighting events in January 2008. I will attach the photos. I did take several shots and I also took shots of stars in the distance to judge if I were jiggling my camera around. That was not the case. The stars in the shots are just bright spots, but the object in question was squiggling all over the place. Last time I looked out the window this thing was still sitting over the valley. I cannot determine how far up it is though. Thanks for your time.
