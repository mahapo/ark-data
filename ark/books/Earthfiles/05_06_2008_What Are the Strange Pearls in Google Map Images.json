Date: May 27, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com To Whom It May Concern: I worked for the company, Aerials Express, that produced the imagery with the so called “pearl marks” from 2002-2007. The aerial photographs were taken in the winter months, and when the negatives were scanned (on a cool morning back in our office in Phoenix) small drops of condensation had formed on the glass of the scanner. These drops were so small, they went un-detected by the operator. They were on the underside of the glass, and so appear to obscure the photograph. At one point, I remember the CEO, Bill Lands, joking about them because a program from the Discovery Channel had contacted him directly. He planned on releasing a PR piece with a picture of the scanner, and operator in an alien costume. He had a great sense of humor. Sorry to dispel the myth, just a bit of water under the scanner.” M angonia Park, Florida, near Palm Beach. The coordinate of the “white pearl” in the photo is approximately: 26' 44\" 57\" N and 80' 04\" 30\" W. Source: 2005 GoogleMaps. M angonia Park is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida. As of 2004, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 1,289. Mangonia Park is a part of Uptown West Palm which includes Riviera Beach and West Palm Beach, Florida. Map source: Wikipedia.

Below: Latitude and longitude grid for eight Florida Google Map images that contain the odd pearl-like spheres, mostly in 2005 or before. Grid assembled by Robert Vernon in 2005, which matches the eight Google Map images above, number 1 through 8, also assembled by Robert Vernon. May 6, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After reporting in 030408 Earthfiles about the Decatur, Alabama, pearl-like sphere retrieved on an ambulance stretcher and transported possibly to a Huntsville, Alabama, facility (NASA? Redstone Army Arsenal?), I received an email from Robert Vernon. Back in 2005, controversy first seriously raged about what the “pearl” objects might be that periodically showed up on Google Map images. Examples are Florida (above) and Los Angeles, California (bottom of report). Robert Vernon studied the images and plotted them on latitude and longitude grids. He thinks the Google Map “pearls” are a graphic artifact of some kind, not unidentified flying"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"objects. But when Google wrote a Google UFO Updates page on May 18, 2005, by James, he stated, “...we're still not sure what they are.” Here is a copy of that May 18, Google UFO Updates , provided by Robert Vernon, with this further comment, “It seems to clarify that these (“ pearls”) are not satellite photos, but aerial photos taken at 17,500 feet if the web poster's information is accurate.” “G oogle UFO Updates Wednesday, 18th May 2005 by James Source: Googlesightseeing.com Please note that some or all of the objects mentioned in this post are no longer visible on Google Earth or Google Maps. Thanks to everyone who commented on the original UFO find, although we’re still not sure what they are, there’s been some interesting developments. Ian Pottinger and Jher were the first to find that there are in fact eight of these UFOs over Florida, at the following points One - Two - Three - Four - Five - Six - Seven - Eight and Tensus used keyhole to map the points showing that they make a very neat grid. Yoshino and Jher later noticed that the UFOs are not limited to Florida but can also be found over L. A. One - Two - Three - Four - Five - Six - Seven - Eight - Nine - Ten - Eleven - Tw e l v e - T h i r t e e n and Tens us again mapped the points, which appear in an almost straight line. Things the UFOs are definitely not... - Space debris or another satellite? Derek & Tens us discovered that the close-up images of Florida are taken by AerialsExpress.com at an altitude of 17,500 feet so are aerial photos and not satellite images. - Marks added to obscure famous peoples homes? While there’s no doubt the White House photos were processed for security it is very unlikely these UFOs are intentional ‘cover-ups’ due to the neat grid layout. - Water towers? The UFOs are just too big to be water towers (and there’s no shadow). - Anomaly produced by the stitching software? Comment from Shi Ju: Definitely they are NOT marks for picture stitching. In most stitching software (like for making panoramas) the algorithm comes down to finding sharp and contrasting details and aligning those spots with each other. Things the UFOs still could be... - An alien spacecraft? It’s still possible! - A weather balloon? Further comments - Tm says : The “Grid” is centered around an airfield, common launch points for weather balloons."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Although Klem says : All currently used radiosonde devices (weather balloons) are latex, yellowish beige to translucent and Jello adds . The object in question here does not cast a ground effect, therefore does not exist in the air. - A ‘lenticular’ cloud? Patrick was the first to float this idea and the images he posted do look similar to the UFOs, although it is unlikely clouds would form in neat grids. - Condensation on the lens? Possibly the current forerunner for most likely explanation, Stuart said... Condensation inside some sort of housing would be my guess. If the drop were directly on the lens it would be effectively invisible. Put it a few inches/feet away and have the camera shooting with a very deep depth of field (as you would with a small aperture) and it would look just like that anomaly. - Something else? Possibly one of: Peppermint, baseball, Vogon ship, crop circle, planet, thumbtack, ball bearings, smoke, pond, swamp gas, golf ball, satellite, flying ninja, space junk or contact lens as others have suggested! Los Angeles, California: “Pearls” on Google Map Images A bove: \"Pearl\" spheres on Google Map images of Los Angeles latitudes and longitudes for images 1 through 5 and 9 through 13, with latitude and longitude grid above.
