Aerial photograph © 2000 by Gilbert Johnson. August 30, 2000 Whitefish, Montana - Today I talked with Gilbert Johnson who has been a pilot since 1957 and runs a charter service and flight school out of Kalispell, Montana. He was flying with two others on August 28, 2000 when they saw a second new wheat formation in Whitefish only about 600 feet from the first formation discovered in mid-August. Flying over that first formation, Mr. Johnson and watched his compass shift fifteen degrees while traveling straight south to north, then shift another ten degrees flying north to south. So he tried the compass over this new formation. Interview: Gilbert Johnson, pilot since 1957, runs charter service and flight school, Kalispell, Montana: \"The first time that I know that anyone saw this formation is when a photographer gave me a call on August 28th. It's about 600 feet south "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of the first one. We circled it for about fifteen minutes and then we took a heading to the north and I made a 180 and came back and checked he compass for any anomaly over the crop circle. I got a ten degree anomaly. And then when we turned around after about a quarter mile or so and headed back over the same area, I got another ten degree anomaly over the crop circle. THAT'S REALLY QUITE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE WHERE YOU GOT THE FIFTEEN DEGREE ANOMALY GOING SOUTH TO NORTH AND THE TEN DEGREE SHIFT GOING NORTH TO SOUTH. Right. I had two other photographers with me. They were watching the compass and I was watching the airplane so I wouldn't deviate or cause any banking. You're not supposed to increase or decrease your speed. I tried to keep everything steady and did a pretty good job. And they both shouted at the same time, \"There's ten degrees shift!\" ANY SIGNS OF ENTRY OR EXIT FROM THE FORMATION? From the air, we didn't see any entries anywhere. I don't know how anyone could do ever do that. They levitated if they did. BECAUSE IT WAS JUST CLEANLY LAID DOWN IN THE DRY WHEAT? Yeah, it was pushed down in a counter-clockwise direction the same as the other one (August 14). THERE ARE NO TRAMLINES IN THOSE FIELDS? No, nothing. Nobody knows the answer.\" Melody Watts, Owner, Midway Mini Mart, Whitefish, Montana: \"This new one is in the same field, same farmer who had the first one this year and one in 1998 across the street. He owns more than 500 acres of wheat. I called the pilot to make reservations to fly over it to take pictures and the pilot had already flown over and had beautiful pictures of when there were no trails in or out. You could not see a trail anywhere. MELODY, HOW UNUSUAL WOULD THAT BE AT THIS POINT AT THE END OF AUGUST WITH THE WHEAT AND SOIL AS DRY AS THEY ARE? There is no way you could wear stilts to get in there! It was cracked. You couldn't even walk through it without breaking anything. It hasn't rained in over three weeks. There is no way anybody could walk in there to make this formation. THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT SAID. HE WAS AMAZED THAT THEY WERE FLYING AT 500 FEET AND COULDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS OF ANY ENTRY OR EXIT. SINCE YOU'VE NOW BEEN IN ONE LAST YEAR AND THE TWO THIS YEAR, WHAT ON THE GROUND ARE YOU LOOKING AT? It's just gorgeous. And unless you're in a real high pick up truck, you can't really even see it from the road. So, even the farmer hadn't noticed it. And once you step on this wheat that's so dry - more than a month with all the fires - and once you step on it, you make a trail through there. Everything just cracks. A person could not walk through there without making a trail. It's just amazing. THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FORMATIONS IN WHICH THE ONLY"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"LOGIC TO HOW IT WAS MADE WAS FROM SOMETHING UP ABOVE OR BELOW GROUND? I couldn't imagine. Even if you had stilts, you couldn't get in there without making some type of mark. AFTER WALKING THROUGH THE VERY DRY WHEAT AND SOIL, WHAT WERE SEEING WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT TO THE FORMATION ITSELF? There was a perfectly round circle. It's laying in a clockwise direction. Then you walk just a little further and you find another huge circle. The wheat is just laid down perfectly. There are no faults anywhere, as you can see in the pictures.

AND THERE IS ONLY THAT ONE CIRCULAR RING IN THE MIDDLE. Yes, and the arcs and circle are all going in a clockwise direction. EVERYTHING IN THIS ONE IS LAID DOWN IN A CLOCKWISE DIRECTION? Yes, it is. Opposite of the first one laid down all counter-clockwise. WHAT DID YOU NOTICE IN TERMS OF THE DRY WHEAT WHERE IT WAS LAID DOWN TO THE GROUND? Well, it didn't look like it was walked on at all. It didn't look broken. It's just flattened. The wheat stems, when I walked on it, they break. So, where it wasn't walked on, I pulled up samples and they were just bent over. So that's kind of unusual. MEANING THAT THEY WERE BENT DOWN TO THE GROUND, BUT THEY WERE NOT BROKEN? Righ t . Amazin g. WHEN YOU LOOKED WHERE YOU HAD WALKED INTO THE WHEAT FIELD UP TO THE FORMATION, WAS EVERY STEP IN THE WHEAT BROKEN OFF? Yes, there was no way to get in and out of there without breaking it. It's been so"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"dry. COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE SOIL? GILBERT JOHNSON, THE PILOT, SAID THE SOIL IS JUST POWDER DUST. DID YOU LOOK FOR ANY SIGNS OF TRACKS OR MACHINERY OR ANYTHING IN THERE? There were no footsteps. And actually, when I walked through there, the dust would fly up and I could see where I had walked. But before I walked on it, there were no footprints anywhere. I don't know about the meaning, but there's something out there trying to tell us something. And it's so close to the airport, it seems like somebody might have reported it from there. But, no. Also, the fires are going on and the Forest Service has had helicopters within a mile of there going up all day long and nobody has said anything. I'm sure they've seen it. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WHEAT ITSELF IN TERMS OF THE GROWTH NODES OR STEMS OR SOIL YOU NOTICED THAT WAS UNUSUAL? Nancy Talbott has been trying to educate me a little on the nodes. And when I looked at it, it seems that where it's bent over the nodes are expanded. To me, as I look at it. I will have to send the samples to BLT Research to let them look at them and confirm anything. It does look a little odd compare to the control samples. THEY ARE LARGER? Yes, much larger. And there are some small blackened holes around the edge, around the nodes of the first joint coming out of the ground. THAT'S WHERE THEY NORMALLY ARE. IF THERE HAS BEEN AN INTERACTION WITH THIS ENERGY THAT DR. LEVENGOOD HYPOTHESIZES IS INVOLVED WHERE THERE USUALLY ARE EXPULSION NODES IS USUALLY ON THE NODE CLOSEST TO THE GROUND OR THE ONE ABOVE IT. Yeah. I can't believe this is happening and nobody really cares. It's too bad. Something is trying to tell us something and we're not even listening.\" We b s it e s : http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/ http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
