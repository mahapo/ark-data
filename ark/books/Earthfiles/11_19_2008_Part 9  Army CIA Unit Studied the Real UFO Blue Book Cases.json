We called those aliens ‘branch brains.’” - “S tein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 8 N ovember 19, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home continues from Part 8. I asked him to go over the sequence of scenes as he remembered them in the non-human autopsy film screened by Stein's CIA boss, Anthony Barden, for the CIA's highly classified Project Blue Book group at the military base in the southeastern United States in July 1958. Stein: “The film started with an introduction and there was wording on there, too, so if you had a projector that didn’t pick up sound, you could read what the narrator was saying. It was a very short introduction and started with showing some alien bodies just laying on wood pallets, it looked like. HOW MANY? There were three bodies. ANY CLOTHES? No, just in their bare skin, I guess you would say. First, we saw one that was – you could recognize it like the one in the alien autopsy because it had a damaged leg. He had his head turned sideways and it looked like he had some kind of injury to the skull. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"T homas Colman Sheppard, Chief Yeoman, U. S. Navy (Retired), was stationed in 1976 with Amphibious Group One White Beach, Okinaw a, w hen on Thanksgiving night he and two other Navy colleagues saw black and white photographs in a file stamped TOP SECRET/MAJIC. He sketched the photographs for me that he remembered, including the one above that shows three non-humans laying on a wooden pallet. Sheppard said: ”Black and white photograph in the hangar and you’ve got three aliens on skids that have some sort of mat on it. They are in the hangar, right near the door. You could tell it’s one of those old-styled hangars with the curved corner. You could see that. You could see the lines from the top of the hangar where the window is with those long panes. They gave off a shadow and you could see those lines going down on the ground.” [ See in Archives: 031706 Earthfiles - Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief Yeoman Describes “Extraterrestrial Biological Entities” in TOP SECRET/MAJIC Photographs. And see: 032306 Earthfiles - Part 2 ] When they started the autopsy, we could recognize the three we saw on the wood pallets in the hangar, although this might not have been all of them because I believe there were four beings in that crash. DID YOU EVER SEE ALL FOUR? No. IN THE FILM WHEN IT STARTED, YOU COULD SEE THREE BEINGS ON ... Wooden pallets like you would put boxes on, but these didn’t have spaces like some pallets. These had solid wood on top. AS IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER JUST TO PUT THOSE BODIES ON TO BE FILMED? The pallets were probably something they already had and just happened to use the pallets to put the alien bodies on, I would think, because in the military you have lots of pallets for forklifts to put boxes and stuff on. Pallets are only a few inches thick from the ground and most have only strips of wood going across them and are hollow in between. But the pallets the aliens were laying on had solid tops, which would be normally used to pile on smaller boxes."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WAS THE CAMERA ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THE BODIES? Actually from the side. You had the one, two, three bodies and you’re looking across them at a slight angle down. HOW FAR WAS THE CAMERA FROM THE BODIES? From the first one, probably about five feet. And there was one body slightly higher up on the pallet and then the third one. So, I guess 5 or 6 feet from the first body and the pallets were about 3 feet, so the pallets were fairly close together, so the end alien body was probably 8 or 10 feet away. HOW LONG WERE THE PALLETS? At least 6 feet long. The bodies were laying kind of centered in the pallets and had about a foot and a half at each end that was not covered. SO YOU THINK THE BEINGS WERE ONLY 3 FEET TALL? Yes, I would think so – 3 feet to 3.5 feet tall, somewhere in there. WAS THERE ANY INFORMATION GIVEN IN THE FILM ABOUT THE HEIGHTS OF THE BEINGS? Absolutely nothing in the film itself. It only said they were ‘small, alien beings.’ When we looked at them, we noticed right away that they had six fingers. We couldn’t count the toes because the feet were together. But it mentioned in the write up that Anthony Barden received that the beings had six fingers and six toes. SO, HE DID HAVE THAT IN WRITING. That was in his typed pages of what was in the film. SO, THAT’S WHY YOU PAID ATTENTION TO THE NUMBER OF FINGERS AND TOES? Yes. Anthony mentioned that in the rundown – small aliens – I think he said 3 to 3.5 feet tall - and had six fingers and six toes. IN THE WRITTEN PAPER, DID IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT INTERNAL ORGANS? It did mention about the autopsy that we would see that none of the internal organs are the same as ours. ANYTHING ABOUT PATHOLOGY RESULTS? Unfortunately, that was about it. But when you cut open a human chest, you would see the lungs. But in that general area of the beings in the autopsy film, there was a large organ in that area they cut out and put it in a stainless steel pan. It did not look like our lungs. DID THE THREE BODIES HAVE RAISED STOMACHS? Yes, all three of them did."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"6 -fingered and 6-toed humanoid allegedly retrieved from the crash of an unidentified aerial vehicle, described by Ray Santilli as southwest of Socorro, New Mexico, in 1947, not between Corona and Roswell. 16mm frames provided by Ray Santilli of Merlin Productions, London, England © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd. See Santilli autopsy film at YouTube. Opening Non-Human Skull “ ... instead of having a solid brain like humans, it looked like a lot of branches. We called those aliens ‘branch brains.’” IN THE DISSECTION/AUTOPSY FILM, DID THEY SHOW FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE FIRST CUTTING AND CONCLUSION? Yes, and opening up the scalp and the brain exposed. The body was opened up first and then the brain and the head – they cut around the head with some kind of device used to cut the skull open. Then they took the top of the skull right off and showed the brain structure. The brain structure was not like ours. Our brain structure is very compact and solid. If you hold up a human brain, you have the two hemispheres. After the medical people cut off the top of the skull, you could see two brain hemispheres, but instead of having a solid brain like humans, it looked like a lot of branches. We called those aliens ‘branch brains,’ is what the guys called them. There were little strips coming out with all these little brain nodules on the strips and had two precise lobes, the right and left. But they were not solid - sort of like broccoli. Discrepancies Between 6-Fingered Alien Autopsy Film Stein Screened in July 1958 and the 1995 Santilli 6-Fingered Autopsy IN THE 1995 DISSECTION FILM THAT WAS BROADCAST ON TV, WHEN THEY TOOK TISSUE OUT OF THAT ENTITY'S SKULL AND PUT IT IN METAL PAN, IT LOOKED DARK, SORT OF LIKE LIVER? No, that’s something completely different. In the autopsy film we saw with Anthony Barden, the medical people did not take the brain completely out of the body. THE BODIES WERE THE SAME IN THE FILM YOU SAW AND THE SANTILLI TV BROADCAST? The bodies were the same, but if the brain came out like a big piece of liver, it was not the same brain that we saw. The doctors had cut the skull right above the alien's eyebrows and took the entire top of his skull right off. WHEN YOU SAW THE BONE BEING LIFTED OFF, WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU SAW WHEN THEY LIFTED OFF THE TOP OF THE SKULL? The brain structure. It looked like a bunch of main stems coming up from the front and going across the back, but they were distinct structures like little twig branches with lobes going off from them in all directions. YOU COULD SEE A VERTICAL BRANCH AND SEE BRANCHES COMING OFF THE MAIN BRANCH? Yes, and little lobes on the branches and we were all laughing about it afterward calling them ‘branch brains.’ THIS WAS BLACK AND WHITE FILM? Ye s . WHAT COLOR WOULD THE BRANCHES HAVE BEEN ON A GREY SCALE? I would say they were dark grey, not black. They were hemispheres like our brain is, right and left. But they were not solid like ours. HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE DOING THE SURGERY? Two, and it was amazing because they had long, white, regular surgical gowns on, but when one of the doctors turned around, I noticed there was a monogram on his sleeve that was ‘WR.’ I asked Anthony Barden about that, did he notice the monogram? Doctors"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"don’t normally monogram their surgical garbs and it looked like a stamped ‘WR.’ And Anthony Barden said, ‘WR. Oh, that’s Walter Reed.’ I asked,’Why would this doctor be wearing a Walter Reed hospital gown.’ Anthony said the doctors were flown out to Roswell from Walter Reed. [ Editor’s Note: Walter Reed Army Medical Center (1909-present) 6900 Georgia Avenue N. W. Washington, D. C. 20307 (between Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue near the Maryland border) http://www.wramc.amedd.army.m il/Pages/default.aspx ] SO, YOUR BOSS ACCEPTED THAT THE DISSECTION/AUTOPSY WAS DONE IN ROSWELL? Ye s . AS OPPOSED TO THE BODIES BEING FLOWN TO WALTER REED? WOULDN’T IT HAVE BEEN EASIER TO FLY THE BODIES TO WALTER REED? I feel that the lead in on the film, the beings laying on the pallets – yes, that was probably done at the Roswell Army Air base. But the second part of the film that showed the actual autopsies, they said it had all been done the same day. However, when they showed the film in the hangar of the three bodies, before his camera panned around to film the bodies, you could see it was bright sunlight with a couple of little fluffy clouds in the sky. You could see right outside. YOU MEAN THE CAMERAMAN WAS AT FIRST POINTING THE CAMERA THROUGH THE HANGAR DOOR TO OUTSIDE? Right, he started filming on the sunny daylight outside and panned around to the three aliens on the pallets in the hangar at the air base outside of Roswell. Now, when we saw the film of the autopsy, it was in a solid room. But one time they were filming in a different direction and you could look out a small window. A portion of the top of the window was not covered with a curtain and you could see real grey skies. Even though they said everything had been done the same day, I think it’s likely that’s not true and that the alien bodies were taken somewhere else for the autopsies. BUT NOBODY SAID THAT? No. I asked Anthony Barden about that and he said, ‘This is all I have.’ I told him about the sunny sky with white clouds versus the grey sky and how could all of it had been done the same day. It was a really dingy grey sky in the autopsy film. WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY TO YOUR OBSERVATION? He said, ‘You’re pretty sharp and you might have something there.’ I also told him we saw three alien bodies there and maybe one was airlifted to Walter Reed Hospital where they had a lot of expert medical doctors that were trying to get as much knowledge from the being as possible rather than having a local Roswell doctor do the autopsy. IN ANTHONY BARDEN’S DESCRIPTION AND IN THE WORDS ON THE FILM, WAS THE WORD ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL’ EVER USED? No, just ‘alien.’ IN TERMS OF THE THREE BODIES, WAS THE WIDE SHOT FROM THE CAMERA IN THE HANGAR THE ONLY WIDE SHOT YOU SAW OF THE THREE BODIES AT ONE TIME? Ye s . IN THAT WIDE SHOT, DO YOU REMEMBER ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE BODIES? One seemed slightly smaller than the other two. But generally, they were the same in appearance. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Discrepancies: Eyes Not Like Grey Beings and No Dark Lenses Removed L arge whites of eyes are revealed after the surgeon lifted off black lenses in Santilli version of non-human autopsy film. 16mm frames provided by Ray Santilli of Merlin Productions, London, England © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd. WERE THE EYES OPEN OR CLOSED AS THEY LAY THERE ON THE PALLETS? I believe all three were open. They were large eyes, but not like the huge eyes depicted on the Grey beings. The eyes were larger and bigger pupils than human eyes. But general overall appearance was like a small person. The eyes had whites around the iris/pupil like we have. They were five feet away and we couldn’t distinguish much more about it than that of the three laying there. Even in the one laying on the autopsy table, I remember seeing eyes that were a little larger than human eyes. IN THE 1995 DISSECTION FILM (SANTILLI), IT SHOWED THE REMOVAL OF BLACK LENSES FROM THE 6-FINGERED BEING’S EYES. No, we saw nothing like that. Nothing like black lenses, no. I didn’t see anything like that. SO YOU ARE DESCRIBING A DIFFERENT FILM. Yes, I realize that now. I didn’t realize that when I saw it on television in 1995. I thought that was the same film we saw at the military base. BUT YOU ARE REMEMBERING FROM YOUR OWN SCREENING OF THE BODIES LAYING ON THE PALLETS, YOU DID NOT HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF SOLID BLACK EYES? No. Autopsy Sequence in Film Stein Saw IN THE DISSECTION FILM THAT ANTHONY BARDEN SHOWED YOU, CAN YOU REMEMBER THE SURGERY SEQUENCE? They started by opening up the throat area and came down opening it up all the way down to the belly area. Then there were a couple of cross sections so they could peel the body back to get at the internal organs. They took the big organ in the chest first that did not look like lungs. It was sort of a rectangular mass, all in one unit, took that out and put that in a stainless steel pan that was shiny. WHEN YOU SAY A RECTANGULAR MASS, DO YOU MEAN LIKE A POUND OF BUTTER? No, not that long, but it was definitely not square. It was longer than it was wide. BUT YOU MEAN THE LARGE INTERNAL ORGAN REMOVED FROM THE CHEST AREA WAS RECTANGULAR IN SHAPE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yes, it was the first one they took out from the chest – or what we would think of as the lung area. It was a large organ that was held in two hands and put into the metal pan. I also remember seeing there was no intestinal tract like we have looping around. There was nothing like that. Then the doctor started taking out smaller organs, different types and shapes.” C ontinued in Part 10 - More 6-fingered being autopsy and Area 51 details R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 2 R eturn to Part 8 More Information : F or further information about 1947 Roswell UFO crashes and retrievals, please see my books in the Earthfiles Shop and reports below in the Earthfiles Archive : • 10/31/2008 — Strange Lights Chased by Jets Again October 29, Over Stephenville, Texas, and Crystalline Triangle in Ohio • 10/30/2008 — More Encounters with Glowing Humanoids, Green Orbs, Strange Aerial Lights and “Thunderbirds” • 10/28/2008 — More Strange Aerial Lights Seen Over Stephenville and Dublin, Texas • 10/10/2008 — Part 1: Two Pennsylvania Hunters Encountered Strange Lights and Lime Green, Glowing Humanoid on Oct. 4 • 10/03/2008 — Mother and Son Watched Cow Rise In Golden-Orange Beam to Disc • 09/23/2008 — AH-1W SuperCobra Helicopters and Glowing Sphere • 08/26/2008 — Update: Earthfiles Viewer Comments About UFOs and 14th Century Black Death • 08/22/2008 — UFOs and 14th Century Black Death • 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH and Physicists Oppenheimer and Einstein • 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Up and JFK Assassination • 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Up and JFK Assassination • 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to Bush Crawford Ranch on January 8, 2008? • 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
