But those spectacular Sacramento Mountains rising steeply from the valley floor could interrupt radar radio signals at White Sands where radar research and the best anti-aircraft surveillance and tracking technology were developed during WWII. Radar research fell under (MJ-2) Dr. Vannevar Bush's OSRD. [ Source: The New York Times , October 6, 1948.] Any object that stood in the way of radio waves emitted from a transmitting unit would be reflected back to a receiving station. If something stood behind the reflecting object, it was essentially invisible to the radar operator. Radar is a \"line of sight\" surveillance and tracking system. That is the primary reason that up through today, the simplest way to evade detection by ground-based radar is to fly at low altitude near the contour of the earth, down canyons, around mountain ranges and tree top level. It's also one of the reasons that the Tularosa Basin was selected for the missile test range. Any attempt by an adversary to uses ground-based radar to record a rocket test - assuming that an adversary could locate a radar site within the vicinity of WSPG - would not be able to collect telemetry until the rocket appeared above the crest of the mountains.

He graduated from Tufts College with a B.S. in 1913. He earned a joint doctorate in engineering from Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1917. He retu rned to MIT in 1919 to become a professor (192332) and vice president and dean of engineering (193238). He was elected a Fellow of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) in 1924. During this period, he devised a network analyzer to simulate the performance of large electrical networks. He is best known for his design of the differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations with as many as 18 independent variables. From 1939 until 1955 he was president of the Carnegie Institution, Washington, D.C. 1890 - 1974. V annevar Bush, Ph.D., with his differential analyzer, 1932-1938. He is also listed as MJ-2 on President Harry S. Truman's Special Studies Group concerning extraterrestrial biological entities interacting with Earth. From 1941 to 1945 he was also the director of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), where he administered the U.S. war effort to utilize and advance military technology. He personally advised President Roosevelt on technological matters and organizing the nation's academic researchers to attack military problems. He directed such programs as the development of the first atomic bomb, the perfection of radar, and the mass production of sulfa drugs and penicillin. In 1955 he returned to MIT, retiring in 1971. From 1957 to 1962 he was Chairman of Merck and Co., the large pharmaceutical company, based in New Jersey. He received numerous honors including the Lamme Medal from the AIEE (1935), and the AIEE Edison Medal in 1943 \"For his contribution to the advancement of electrical engineering, particularly through the development of new applications in mathematics to engineering problems, and for his eminent service to the nation in guiding the war research programs.\" He was awarded the National"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Medal of Science, presented by President Lyndon B. Johnson in January 1964. Bush wrote Endless Horizons (1975) and Modern Arms and Free Men (1985), although he is probably best known for his July 1945 article, As We May Think and Endless Frontier. He passed away on June 28, 1974, in Belmont, Massachusetts. ] If it were possible to set up a radar, enemies would only be able to gather limited intelligence and none related to the critical \"boost\" or \"terminal\" phase of the test. This principle also worked in reverse, however. Any object that went past or below the peaks of one of WSPG's mountain ranges would also be invisible to WSPG radar in the early years. Major Holger Toftoy, Project PAPERCLIP and Hermes A-1 Surface-to-Air Missile (German Wasserfall) M ajor Holger Toftoy, Chief of U. S. Army-Ordnance, Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section (EEIS), in front of a German Wasserfall rocket modified by the American Project PAPERCLIP at WSPG and called an Hermes A-1 surface-to-air missile. Major Holger Toftoy, Chief of U. S. Army-Ordnance, Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section and Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2), Director of OSRD, worked together prior to the winter of 1944. Bush's Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittees (CIOS) identified enemy technology and research facilities in occupied Europe and Germany which the United States found useful. These were judged to possess high scientific value and would be used in the post war period to refine and advance the cutting edge of U. S. weapons technology. [ Sources: The Nuclear Oracles © Sylves, p. 253; Science With A Vengeance © Devorkin.] Toftoy's missions, ordered by OSRD and the JCS and supported by U. S. Army Ordnance and the OSS, were to capture, secure, defend and hold high value scientific facilities and await the arrival of technical scientific teams who would sort and evaluate on the ground what had been captured. The booty would then be disassembled, crated and sent wherever (MJ-2) Dr. Bush's OSRD directed. Toftoy became a legend within his area of expertise which was based upon his secret wartime exploits in Europe. In 1947, Holger Toftoy lived in two places: El Paso, Texas and Las Cruces, New Mexico. Toftoy also worked in two places: the Fort Bliss Military Reservation, Texas, and WSPG, New Mexico. [ Source: The Nuclear Oracles © Sylves, p. 102.] Operation 'PAPERCLIP\" was the last in a series of covert operations to recover enemy scientific equipment in the European Theater of Operations during WWII. It was preceded by Operations 'WILDHORN,' 'CROSSBOW,' 'OVERCAST,' and \"BACKFIRE.\" Project PAPERCLIP's reported scope required securing sufficient components to construct one hundred V-2 missiles. That demanded gathering the rocket blueprints, technical manuals, their control and test facilities and scientific personnel from Germany and moving all covertly to WSPG. Only now does it appear that PAPERCLIP's mission also included moving German Wasserfall surface-to-air missile systems to Ft. Bliss, Texas and Project \"KINGMAN\" in Utah. This has never been discussed in the public literature. It was Holger"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Toftoy's mission, ordered by (MJ-2) Dr. Bush and authorized by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Vannevar Bush's T-Force was composed of elements of the 144th Army Ordnance Company in combination with the Air Material Command (AMC), the U. S. Navy, the Coast Guard, and U. S. Customs. That was truly a \"joint\" JCS operation. Germany's Underground Mittelwerk and V-2s In March 1945, Toftoy was ordered to form his group. In April 1945, Toftoy received word that the German rocket facilities at the Mittelwerk had been overrun. At the same time, he was told that the Allies would be forced to surrender the area to the Russians within several weeks as part of the Potsdam Agreement between the western allies and the U.S.S. R. Toftoy's T-Force descended on Mittelwerk and within 120 days removed 360 tons of German rocket components from the Russian area. [ Source: United States Civilian Space Program 1958-1978, p. 151.] Most of the components were shipped back to U. S. Army Ordnance and OSRD at Ft. Bliss, Texas, and WSPG, New Mexico. Only now do we know that Toftoy also shipped Wasserfall surface-to-air missiles to join the AMC/AEC \"KINGMAN\" site at Wendover, Utah. [ Source: Sandia National Laboratories © Furman, p. 96.] [ Editor's Note: V-2 Rocket.com report by Paul Grigorieff: \"The name Mittelbau refers to a complex of factories, storage depots, facilities and prisoner camps, some underground at the Mittelwerk V-2 assembly plant, that were used from August 1943 until April 1945 to manufacture and test the V-2 rocket near Nordhausen in central Germany. The main V-2 assembly line was located in an underground factory called Mittelwerk that was excavated beneath Kohnstein Mountain, about 2 km southwest of the town of Neidersachswerfen. The Dora concentration camp (later called Mittelbau KZ), where most of the Mittelwerk workers were imprisoned, was located on the southwest edge of the Kohnstein, near the southern portals of of Mittelwerk tunnels A and B. \"Immediately after the war, while America was building its own rocket program on the foundations of German technology, the horrible reality of slave labor used during V-2 production was concealed from the public. Only in the past 10 years, as prisoners' histories have been published, have we begun to understand more. Estimates put the number of prisoners used by the Germans for V-2 production at - Mittelbau at more than 60,000. Over 25,000 of these were killed either by beatings, starvation, and sickness in the complex, or by the brutal efforts of the SS to relocate them before the Americans arrived in April, 1945. We now know that many of the most shocking \"concentration camp pictures\" that are seared into our common consciousness from this era were taken by U.S. troops as they entered the Mittelbau camps.\" ] A bove: Outside the Mittelwerk entrance which was excavated beneath Kohnstein Mountain, Germany, about 2 kilometers southwest of the town of Neidersachswerfen.

S. Army Ordnance, was a missile research and development effort to design and build rockets similar to Germany's General Electric's research laboratory at Lynn, Massachusetts, was the principal contractor on the effort through the California Institute of Technology (CIT). V-2s had been successfully employed to bomb London and a number of other European capitals between 1943 and March 28, 1945. [ Source: Science With A Vengeance © Devorkin.] The vision of the OSRD's CIOS panel in respect to V-2s in 1944 was that a ballistic missile fitted with a nuclear warhead such as those developed by LASL might represent the ultimate future strategic weapon. General Electric would design and fabricate Hermes missile systems. It is now known that Project Hermes involved more than the development of the German V-2 model. Project Hermes also commissioned the development of other German rockets. The preponderance of the published literature suggests that Hermes was a project to simply develop one rocket - one similar to the V-2 ballistic missile. Today, it is known that the first Hermes A-1 was not a duplicate of a V-2. It was a duplicate of the Wasserfall surface-to-air missile. [ Source: United States Civilian Space Program 1958-1978, p. 167.] This fact would not be known if not for a NASA administrator who in 1981 mentioned it in a Congressional testimony. Yet, throughout 1995 literature related to the Hermes A-1, it is called a duplicate of the German V-2 rocket. Why the misinformation? The Wasserfall surface-to-air missile system was intended to defend high value military and political targets from air attack. The U. S. nuclear weapons stockpile could certainly be defined as a high value target, one that justified the use of the most sophisticated anti-aircraft systems to protect it from a potential air strike. The AEC was particularly concerned with air threats and constructed all of its storage and final warhead assembly areas underground for that reason. [ Sandia National Laboratories © Furman, p. 323.] Project WATERSUPPLY was the JCS and AEC mission to construct underground nuclear weapons storage areas in the continental United States that began in late 1946. One of the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"underground storage areas under construction in July 1947 for WATERSUPPLY was within 100 miles of the Corona/Roswell flying disc crash site. (MJ-4) General Nathan Twining's AMC was responsible for the development of improved surface-to-air missiles for the JCS. President Truman improved air security substantially by executing an executive order on January 18, 1948, which banned all flights over AEC facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee; the Hanford Engineering Works at Richmond, Washington; and Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory in northern New Mexico. [ Sources: Science With A Vengeance © Devorkin, p. 90; The New York Times , January 18, 1948, Front Page.] R. W. Porter of General Electric's Hermes Group met Toftoy in Europe during the summer of 1945 and reviewed progress on PAPERCLIP. Porter had a proprietary interest in what was being collected in Germany. Also in Europe at the time was Ernst Krause.. Krause became head of the Naval Research Laboratory's ballistic missile efforts and became chairman of OSRD's V-2 Research Panel in 1946. [ Source: NYT , January 18, 1948, Front Page.] Krause and Porter roamed around occupied Germany together during the summer of 1945 to gather information and to interrogate German scientists about guidance systems, gyros, inertial systems and to buy components from German manufacturers who were encouraged not to disassemble their wartime production facilities for rocket components. [ Sourc e: Science With A Vengeance © Devorkin, p. 47.] These would be useful to OSRD, Army and Navy Ordnance and the AMC to advance the U. S. military space science program. Interrogations of German rocket scientists sorted out those that would be particularly useful versus those of lessor value. Those individuals that were of interest to OSRD would have a PAPERCLIP attached to their file. The human approach was simple for the scientists that the U. S. wanted. The question: \"Would you prefer to go to the U. S. with U. S. Army sponsorship? Or would you prefer Russia under Red Army sponsorship?' The questions put that way usually achieved the desired result. German scientists began arriving at Ft. Bliss, Texas, at Toftoy's EEIS center in the winter and spring of 1946 through Juarez, Mexico. In 1947, the entire research component of New Mexico's military complex and the Atomic Energy Commission laboratory system (LASL at Los Alamos; the AFSWP at Sandia Base; LASL's Z Division in Albuquerque at Sandia Base; and WSPG) operated directly under the highest military and civilian authority in the United States, which were OSRD, JRDB and the JCS, U. S. Army Ordnance, and Enemy Equipment Intelligence Section (EEIS) under command of the legendary Holger Toftoy, based at Ft. Bliss, Texas. The flying disc intelligence was focused on the one area in the U. S. where any \"peculiar phenomenon\" that disrupted weapons research activity was immediately a matter of concern to the JCS and the President. In this remote region of the southwest, flying discs had flown directly into the primary scientific and military units that collected advanced weapons technology for every element of the United States government. The American goal was to develop high altitude weapons systems. U. S. Army radar technicians noticed on May 29, 1947, that the phenomenon had appeared from ground level. The objects were not being launched from Mexico, but were rising up from playas at White Sands Proving Ground.\" C ontinued in Part 12 - Plane Crashes, UFOs and the Truman Administration More Information: F or more about Landing Zones 1, 2 and 3 described in Majestic-12 leaked documents, please see reports below in Earthfiles Archives : · 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 04/13/2004 -- Part 7: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report VI © July 1991 by Leonard H.
