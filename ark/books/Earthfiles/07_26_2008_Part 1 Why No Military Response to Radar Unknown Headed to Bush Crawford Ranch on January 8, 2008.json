July 26, 2008 Littleton, Colorado - Back in early January to mid-February 2008, a series of unidentified aerial lights and strange craft were reported by dozens of eyewitnesses in the Stephenville, Dublin, and Selden region southwest of Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. One especially active date was January 8, 2008, beginning a few minutes after 6 PM Central with three eyewitnesses sitting on a hill in Selden southeast east of Stephenville and straight east of Dublin. One of those eyewitnesses was Steve Allen, a pilot, businessman and long-time resident of nearby Glen Rose. He is accustomed to watching civilian and m ilitary air traffic, but says he has never seen anything like the aerial display on January 8. He and two friends were relaxing after work on a Selden hillside when four bright lights in a rectangle pattern came rapidly from the east, either flying in formation or were one huge aircraft. Steve estimated the long side of the rectangular pattern of bright, white lights to be a mile long. [ See 022208 Updated Earthfiles.] S elden, Texas, hillside and campfire, estimated time 6:12 PM Central, on January 8, 2008. Eyewitnesses of four bright lights in mile-long by 1/2-mile wide rectangle pattern were Steve Allen, Mike Odam and Lance Jones. Sketch © 2008 for Earthfiles by Steve Allen. The lights came in from the east rapidly, seemed to hover, changed patterns and even morphed into what looked like two vertical windows filled with white fire. After creating a scene that Steve Allen said looked like something out of the Bible, the fiery windows returned to a pattern of bright lights that took off rapidly toward Stephenville to the west. Within ten minutes, the lights returned. But this time there were vivid red and glowing half-spheres and Steve said two F-16 jets came roaring toward the lights with after burners on high and seemed to chase after the lights, which moved rapidly to the east. Steve said it as if the lights and jets were in front of him on the Selden hill and the next second, the lights were near the horizon with the two jets trying to catch up.

There were several other UFO eyewitness reports that night until at least 8 PM Central, which were reported by Angelia Joiner when she worked for the Stephenville Empire- Tr ibune . By January 14, 2008, news about the Stephenville UFO events was picked up by Associated Press and quickly spread to all the TV networks and beyond to international headlines. One man in Littleton, Colorado, who was following the Stephenville, Texas, phenomena was Glen Schulze, a semi-retired radar specialist. Glen received a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1952. Then he was drafted into the U. S. Army from September 1952 to 1954. He was assigned to assist in the test and evaluation of the Chain Radar Network at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A decade later from 1965 to 1971, he worked at Cape Canaveral for the NASA Apollo program in which he produced re-entry instrumentation recordings. As Apollo closed down, Glen went to work for Martin-Marietta in Littleton, Colorado, in support of Skylab the first space station the United States launched into orbit from 1973 to 1979, to study the sun and effects of microgravity. Glen Schulze supported the tape recording of key instrumentation data acquired by Skylab sensors for science reports. Glen is very familiar with analyzing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar records because he has been involved with other investigations of the July 17, 1996, TWA 800 air explosion; the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the New York City World Trade Center, the Pentagon and the airliner over Pennsylvania; and the November 7, 2006, appearance of an unidentified, spinning, white disc above United Airline's C-17 gate at Chicago O'Hare Airport. Glen knows that on January 8, 2008, the Federal Aviation Administration’s radar beacons, designed to help air traffic controllers reduce air congestion around airports, would have received whatever transponder beacon signals were sent from civilian and m ilitary aircraft in the greater Dallas/Fort Worth and Stephenville region. Glen also knew that FAA radar tapes can be re-used within fourteen days. So, if he was to get any usable data, it was urgent that he file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request immediately."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T his ASR-9 radar antenna system is a typical ground radar installed at air traffic control facilities. The ladder-like top section is the secondary surveillance radars (SSR) directional antenna, which interrogates and listens for any replies. The remainder of the assembly makes up the primary surveillance radar (PSR) antenna. The system consists of transponders, which are automatic devices that receive an interrogation, decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with the requested information when appropriate. Image source FAA. Glen Schulze mailed his FOIA request on January 16, 2008, for data from the five Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) antennas that were within 250 nautical miles of Stephenville, Texas. He r eceived 2.5 m illion radar data returns. To help analyze the data and compare it to the many January 8, 2008, eyewitness accounts of strange aerial phenomena, MUFON Research Director, Robert Powell, joined in the effort. Robert, 54, received a B. S. in Chemistry from Southeastern Oklahoma State University in 1976. He has worked in the semi-conductor industry for almost thirty years. Both men wanted to know if the FAA radar data would produce “skin-paint” tracks (radar reflection off surfaces, not a transponder beep) of unknown objects that were not using transponders. By definition, an unknown object would be one that painted a track on the FAA radar but did not give off any transponder beeps, as all other normal civilian air traffic would – and most military traffic. If there were unknowns, then Robert Powell wanted to study their latitude and longitude data to calculate speeds, directions and timelines to compare with eyewitness accounts. After hundreds of research hours, in July 2008 Glen Schulze and Robert Powell released their formal report through MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, that includes graphics, which can be seen in its entirety at the MUFON website, www.mufon.com. Glen Schulze and Robert Powell did find FAA radar unknowns that don’t match up to any known civilian or military aircraft. One unknown traveled for nearly an hour very slowly on a straight track toward the President George W. Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas, east of Stephenville."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A viation map of restricted air space inside white circle around President George W. Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas, 65 miles southeast of Stephenville (upper left map). E xcerpt of reporter Angelia Joiner's Stephenville, Texas, interview with Major Karl Lewis, NAS JRB Fort Worth, that was summarized in an Associated Press wire story distributed nationally on January 14, 2008. Interviews: Glen Schulze, Semi-Retired Electrical Engineer and Radar Specialist, Littleton, Colorado: “The first thing that drove me in that direction was Major Karl Lewis at the Carswell AFB installation saying within two days that they had no airplanes in the air. And I said, ‘Wait a minute! This sounds like Roswell all over again. Here we have people on the ground saying they are seeing all this activity and the United States Air Force is saying, ‘Oh, we didn’t have anything in the air.’ So I said, ‘If there is anything in the air, the FAA radar is going to show it. So, I went out and followed the FOIA procedure on two different FAA facilities: the Air Route Traffic Control Center in Fort Worth, which is responsible for all of Texas plus adjoining states with about 16 different rotating antennas. And I sent in a second stand alone FOIA to the Dallas/Fort Worth TRACON staff (Terminal Radar Control), which is a completely different building with a completely different set of technicians. These are the people who are right at the DFW runways controlling the landings and takeoffs of the airplanes. I received data from five completely different FAA antenna towers and that totaled up to over 2.5 million returns. I had also requested five additional and different antenna data, which I did not get. So, I got the five from the Air Route Traffic Control Center, but I got nothing that I requested from the DFW TRACON. DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN’T GET ANY OF THAT DATA?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I can tell you what they told me. They told me that my TRACON requests had arrived too late to their technical staff and that the data was no longer available. They did not say the data had been recorded over. They said the data was no longer available, which made me feel a little unhappy because both of my FOIAs – the one that succeeded with the Air Route Traffic Control Center – which got me 2.5 million data returns – and the second one, which got me nothing. So, two different stand alone FOIAS. One succeeded. One did not. Both went out in the same envelope of transmittal. IS IT CORRECT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ACTED SO QUICKLY BECAUSE YOU KNEW THAT IN MANY CASES RADAR TAPES WOULD BE ERASED AND RE-USED AND YOU WANTED TO ACT BEFORE THE FOURTEEN DAYS WERE UP? Exactly. Discovery of Unknowns in Stephenville Radar Data WHEN DID YOU FIRST REALIZE THAT YOU WERE DEALING WITH UNKNOWNS? Probably two or three months into the exercise and it was a very difficult task – not only because of the volume of returns we had – but the fact that we had sort of an equal number - and this is sort of incredible – we had an equal number of beacon returns that were being received from cooperative airplanes in the air that had beacons that when they got scanned from the ground, the beacon went back and said, ‘Here I am and here is my 4-digit pin number THIS IS WHAT COMES FROM THE TRANSPONDERS IN CIVILIAN AND MILITARY PLANES? Yes, the transponder is what answers the sweeping antenna from the ground and it says, ‘Here I am. I want to be identified. Here’s my altitude, here’s my code number. Don’t lose track of me, guys. I’m cooperating with you. That’s called a secondary or transponder beacon return. Half of our returns were of that type. The other half of the returns were uncooperative, non-beacon targets, from which we got ‘skin-paint’ returns, but no help, no beacons, no pin numbers, no altitudes. So, I had a real task of trying to sift through all of this to try to see where are there unknowns over Stephenville that I should zero in on? That took me about two and a half months to do that. WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT EXCITED YOU? The fact that the unknowns were at the right time of day, they were in the right latitude and longitude. In fact, for over an hour, we got almost 200 returns from an unknown, non-beacon, unidentified device – all in a straight line ground track headed to the southeast over Stephenville. In addition to that, I discovered that there appeared to be two lesser unknowns also in the same area with similar skin-paint returns only and also in a ground track either passing nearby or over Stephenville or slightly south of Stephenville headed southeast."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A n “Unknown Aircraft” without transponder beacon, but reflecting nearly 200 skin-paint returns, moved in a straight line from Dublin toward the Bush Crawford ranch between 6:51 PM and 8 PM, on January 8, 2008. The unknown object disappeared from radar between 7:03 PM and 7:10 PM. Then at 7:32 PM, the unknown object accelerated rapidly in 30 seconds to 532 mph and then ten seconds later, it decelerated to 49 mph. Graph © 2008 by Glen Schulze and Robert Powell. WHAT WOULD YOU CONCLUDE FROM THAT? I’m definitely getting regular target returns, skin-paints only, of non-beacon objects in the sky, which appear to be in some sort of formation because they are all heading in the same direction and at the same time and they all appear to have an erratic appearance to them. By that, I mean the major unknown of which we got about 200 radar returns from over a one hour period (6:51 PM to 8 PM), we would get maybe five consecutive returns in a 50-second period. Then we would not receive returns for the next minute or so. Then suddenly, we would get five or six more radar returns back. So, we were getting a sporadic burst of skin-paint returns from this major target. What kept us interested was when radar returns on one unknown object (no transponder beeps) did show up in the data from 6:51 PM to 8:00 PM, on our graph it was traveling a straight line headed for Crawford, Texas. (George W. Bush ranch is there). I have a feeling that whatever this was, it was dropping below the radar screen – you’ve heard the phrase, ‘Flying below the radar screen.’ I think some times this unknown object was dropping below the radar screen coverage and then come back up on top of the radar and then go back down. It looks like whatever this was, it was gaining in altitude and then dropping in altitude periodically during the 60-minute period. The other two unknown targets were doing similar things, but the pattern there was not quite as convincing because we didn’t have as many returns from those two.” First Unknown Radar Returns At 6:15 PM Robert Powell, chemist retired from semi-conductor industry and cu rrent Director of Research, MUFON (Mutual UFO Network), Austin, Texas: “The first radar unknown was at 6:15 PM, and that radar unknown was two data points that showed up on radar 20 seconds apart. One of the data points shows up just north of Selden by about 3 miles. The second radar point shows up north of Stephenville by about 7 to 8 miles."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"F irst radar “unknown” between 6:15 PM and 6:20 PM in Selden, Texas, which is similar in time and location to the sightings by Steve Allen and his two friends of the huge rectangle of lights that changed shapes, flew off toward Stephenville and then returned to Selden where the two F-16s chased after them. “If data points are of the same object, its speed would be 2100 mph.” Graph © 2008 by Glen Schulze and Robert Powell. SO THAT MIGHT RELATE TO STEVE ALLEN SAYING THAT THE FIRST THING THEY SAW WAS THE RECTANGULAR CONFIGURATION OF THE LIGHTS COMING IN FRONT OF HIM AND HIS TWO COLLEAGUES SITTING ON THE HILL. THEN IT TOOK OFF, AS I UNDERSTAND, QUITE RAPIDLY GOING TO THEIR LEFT. THAT MIGHT BE THE MOMENT WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE IN FRONT OF THEM IN SELDEN AND THE RADAR PICKS THEM UP IN STEPHENVILLE. Right, that’s correct. And speed I can calculate because the FAA radar data gives me a latitude and longitude coordinate for each of those two points and the data gives me times. So, I can calculate the distance between the two points, the time it took to get there and then I can calculate a minimum speed. WHAT SPEED DID YOU CALCULATE BETWEEN THE SELDEN RADAR OBJECT AND THE STEPHENVILLE RADAR OBJECT AT 6:15 PM? Approximately 2100 mph. I would not be surprised if we do have some military jets that would be able to travel at 2100 mph if they were at high altitude. WHERE THERE WAS LESS ATMOSPHERIC FRICTION? Right. BUT AT 2100 MPH AT THE LEVEL OF WHERE STEVE ALLEN AND THE OTHER TWO WERE IN SELDEN, IT WAS LOW FROM THEIR DESCRIPTION AND TRAVELING VERY FAST. WOULDN’T THEY HAVE HEARD THE SOUND BARRIER BEING BROKEN? They should have, as long as it broke the sound barrier some place in their vicinity. Other Eyewitnesses Between 6:10 PM and 6:25 PM WHAT CONVINCES YOU THAT THE RADAR YOU HAVE FROM THE FAA AND THE FOIA REQUEST MATCHES WITH STEVE ALLEN’S EYEWITNESS SIGHTING? Steve saw this some time between 5:45 PM and 6:15 PM. There’s another witness who was driving west near Chalk Mountain and saw two very bright objects directly west towards Stephenville. That was at 6:10 PM. At 6:20 PM, there was also a witness near Gorman, Texas. That’s either 20 or 30 miles to the west of Stephenville, who sees an object that he thinks is just north of Stephenville and describes it as a series of lights that turn on and turn off. There is also a witness near Lake Proctor at 6:20 to 6:25 PM, who sees an object in the Dublin and Stephenville area that is a group of lights moving at a rapid speed."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"So, I’ve got a radar fix on an object at 6:15 PM. I’ve got three witnesses whose time frame is very close to 6:15 PM. And then I have a grouping of four witnesses near Selden who have given different times that could be anywhere from 5:45 Pm to 6:15 PM. Therefore, I believe it’s likely it was probably closer to 6:15 PM and that all four reports were basically looking at the same object that was on radar. WHAT UNFOLDS IN TERMS OF YOUR RADAR DATA OF UNKNOWNS AND OTHER EYEWITNESS REPORTS UP TO 8 PM ON JANUARY 8, 2008? There was another event where a lady was driving her car near the city of Alexander. She was about to crest a hill when suddenly she saw two bright, red globes that were very close to her. Her very first thought was that these were two planes about to crash because of the red color of the light and the size. Then as she continued looking, she realized those two lights were stationary. They were not moving. And she pulled a little bit over to the right of the road and then within a few seconds, the lights just disappeared. She described those lights as if you pulled up behind a school bus at night and the lights were similar to the reddish-orange lights on the back of a school bus. OK, so I looked for any objects on radar in her position. I did find an object on radar about 6 or 8 miles southwest of her location, which is the direction she said that she saw this object. In that southwest direction is an object that pick up on radar. We actually track this on radar for over an hour. This is the one that if you continue tracking it, by 8 PM, it is within 10 miles of the (President Bush) Crawford Ranch.” C ontinued in Part 2 - Strange Sorties of F-16s on January 8, 2008 More Information : See other Earthfiles reports about Stephenville, Texas, aerial phenomena in Earthfiles Archive: • 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
