July 3, 2009 Wiltshire County, England - This morning I received the following UK crop formations from 2008 and 2009, that the Australian scientist proposes have each related to astronomical countdowns to predicted solar events. The current question today is: since April 14, 2009, and the first UK crop formation at The Ridgeway in flowering oilseed rape, has the crop formation intelligence been forecasting a major solar eruption for Tuesday, July 7, 2009, perhaps occurring in the late afternoon in English time? [ See: Earthfiles043009 ] A ustralian scientist July 3, 2009: “Perhaps there is some method to their madness? I did not see the pattern until that ‘Nazca hummingbird’ appeared last night. Tail feathers in the swallows from 2008 read ‘10-9-8.’ Tail (or other) feathers in the hummingbird from 2009 read ‘5-3-2-1.’” Graphic illustration produced by Australian scientist. 2008 and 2009 aerial images from Cropcircleconnector.com. Further, Mark in Colorado, who worked in computer signal processing for thirteen years and who sent me his Quetzalcoatl PDF comparing the South Field and Milk Hill “alien symbols” to Mayan glyphs has also emailed to me the following PDF about the “Nazca Hummingbird” that was reported yesterday, July 2, 2009, below Milk Hill near Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, England.
