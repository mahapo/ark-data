Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Another Orange Triangle Near Red Deer, Alberta, Canada © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe Red Deer and Lacombe are about 100 miles south of Edmonton, Alberta, a larger city which has also had several crop formations in its fields since the late 1990s. October 27, 2001 Red Deer, Alberta, Canada - Yesterday morning I received a phone call from one of the nurse's aides who works at the Lacombe Nursing Home near Red Deer, Alberta, Canada. A month ago, I reported about the large 422-foot-diameter hexagram that appeared in a Red Deer wheat field on September 2. Reported by farmer Ken Bickford on September 16, 2001 after he discovered the hexagram in his Red Deer, Alberta wheat field from his combine harvester. The swath on the left was his first drive through. After that, Mr. Bickford drove around the formation to preserve it.

After news about it broke, a pilot acknowledged he first saw it from the air on September 2, but did not report it. Aerial photograph © 2001 by Lyle Ford, CCCRN. A couple of nights after that, Penny Pickett and Linda Fraser were taking cigarette breaks outdoors when they noticed six large, orange glowing triangles form patterns in the sky TWICE the same night. Orange glowing triangles were also seen on September 15th by another nurse's aides, Judith Milne. Six, orange glowing triangle-shaped aerial craft seen by Judy Milne, Nurse's Aide, Lacombe Nursing Home, Lacombe, Alberta Canada on September 15, 2001, the third such episode of orange triangular craft. See Earthfiles September 22, 2001. The first and second were September 4, 2001 and the fourth was October 26, 2001. Drawings by Judy Milne. Now for the fourth time, another orange, glowing triangle was in the dark sky above the Lacombe nursing home yesterday at 5:52 a.m. and watched by nurse's aide, Penny Pickett. Interview: Penny Pickett, Nurse's Aide, Lacombe Nursing Home, Lacombe, Alberta,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Canada: \"Linda Fraser and I were sitting outside in the courtyard and we seen one orange triangle coming towards us and it went from north to south and it was just the outside edges that was lit up. It would take just over one finger width to cover it from the ground looking up at it. (If finger tip extended at arms length.) And there wasn't a sound. No other lights or anything. It went just smoothly, so nice through the sky. HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS? I can't tell distance, really, but probably about 5,000 feet. Like it flies higher than the birds do, but it's lower than jets are. BUT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF BEING A COMPLETELY SOLID TRIANGLE, IT HAD THIS ORANGE LIGHT MORE AROUND THE EDGES? Yeah, like it glowed in the middle, but the outside edge was more prominent than the rest of it. HOW LONG DID YOU SEE IT? We watched it for probably 15 seconds. Once in a life time is something to see these things, but to see them four times in two months is just like mind boggling! I'm really glad we got to see them again! Because now that I've seen them, I want to see them again. AND WHAT IS IN THEM? Yeah, what is in them and what are they doing and what are they looking for? Is there something they know that the rest of us don't know? Are they good? Are they bad? You know. Are they laughing us because we are letting our world go to pot, or what?\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
