Here begins final Part 15 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. This epilogue is Len Stringfield's last words in his 1978 to 1994 series of status reports. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Epilogue: A Personal Perspective To the average person worldwide, with an average education, regardless of cultures or religious beliefs, the contents of this monograph probably would be interpreted as pure nonsense. To them, who represent the backbone of civilization, they would probably find just as much credibility in ghosts, trolls, dragons or a pig with wings or maybe a cow jumping over the moon. In a way, the general world public is like a sleeping Triceratops. It would take a threatening UFO event like a stalking Tyrannosaurus rex to rouse it into action. Lest we forget it took a Pearl Harbor to jolt the United States, overnight, into a united fighting mood. UFOs behave differently than warlike people; they subtly do their \"thing\" without bombs or ray guns, ever so careful not to disturb our tr aditional cultures or a football or soccer game. As a UFO researcher and author, I, too, like many of my brethren, was brought up in a world of cherished traditions, mine based on Western culture, starting when I took a leap from believing in Santa Claus to suddenly f ace a world of God-fearing religions. Growing up, baseball was my sport, art and writing my hobbies, and I liked to read Edgar Allan Poe, Lewis Carroll and Conan Doyle. As a pa triot, I enlisted in the Army Air Corps, spending 31 months in the 5th Air Force in the Pacific Theater of the war, 26 of them in a combat area. But, when I spotted three foo-fighters near Iwo Jima on August 27, 1945, which triggered my interest into research in 1950, the orderly world I thought I knew was no more. To me, what does it all mean? Now, as I write this Epilogue, on the threshold of 1994, I know (or think I know) that something of the highest strangeness is happening to our worl d and to our human race from another world, or worlds, by an alien race, or races, endowed with a superior intelligence and an inexplicable gift of extra-normal powers. While it is credible to believe that we may have been visited in Earth's "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"primordial, Sumerian or Biblical times, the \"Big bang\" of UFO events have indeed occurred with a pervasive persistence since WWII. While our government, and perhaps others, may know all the answers, some of the answers, or none, whatever is going on to cope with the situation behind the walls of the Inner Sanctum, it has been effectively silenced under the highest degree of secrecy. If this should be my last monograph on UFO crash/retrievals, I feel a warmth of satisfaction that my contributions have made a dent into the credibility that UFOs have had fatal failures. But the Roswell incident, alone, has provided enough strong testimonial evidence to suggest that at least one alien race has ventured to Earth and left its signature. While the bulk of the work in the Roswell case has been accomplished by others since the Jesse Marcel revelations, I feel privileged being among the first to hear his disclosures (April 7, 1978) and the first, to my knowledge, to publish them in my paper, Retrievals of the Third Kind, July 1978, presented at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio. I am also proud of the fact that I have contributed other sources to the Roswell treasury of witnesses, having been first to publish the names of Mrs. Sappho Henderson, wife of the late \"Pappy\" O. W. Henderson, who saw the retrieved bodies and flew some of the crashed UFO wreckage to Wright Field (thanks to John August); Beverly Bean, English daughter of Sergeant Brown of the 509th, who was involved in the retrieval operation (thanks to Timothy Good); Staff Sergeant Robert Slusher, crew member on B-29 flight which transported a top secret crate (bodies?) from Roswell to Ft. Worth. His name and others I got from a fellow crew member \"Tim,\" my key informant, who still prefers anonymity. All of the above, except the late Marcel, have since signed affidavits for the Fund for UFO Research. Speaking of pride, I've also had it jolted a few times. Knowing how the word, \"anonymous\" gives some researchers dyspepsia, I felt gleeful on one occasion when I was given special permission to intr oduce to research, the name of the late Dr. Robert Sarbaucher, formerly science consultant in U. S. Defense Department's Joint Research and Development, in my Status Report III. This privilege was granted to me by Arthur Bray, a Canadian researcher who had maintained the name in confidence for years on the request of his friend, Wilbert Smith, who met the scientist as head of Canada's Project Magnet in 1950. Having published Sarbaucher's name, researcher Bill Steinman managed to locate him and eventually received an extraordinarily informative letter which, in essence, stated that he was aware of official reports of a retrieved saucer and its \"insectoid\" occupants. Unfortunately for me, Steinman shared his prized letter with others who were in the limelight and in short order, Sarbaucher became big news, being quoted in most of the saucerzines. My first glimpse of the letter, however, came about belatedly when I was reviewing the rough copy of the manuscript for Steinman's book, UF O Crash at Aztec (1986) in which I was asked to write its Foreword. I regret that I was not given the opportunity to chat with the scient ist for his comments to my own set of questions. So be it in the Hall of Mirrors. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Molded by mankind's traditions, I still have moments that I feel like I am living in a myth or that I have been deluded by everybody in the Hall of Mirrors. These negative notions are, of course, ludicrous. The foo-fighters I have seen over Iwo Jima in 1945 were not myths nor was I mesmerized by the GI next to me who also witnessed the phenomenon. Beyond that personal experience, the evidence postulating that UFOs are real is massive. To my knowledge, there is no proof yet of alien intervention in people's lives unless we accept the sheer volume of reports claiming a bduction. There does exist some trace evidence of biotic disturbance based on soil and plant samples but, again, it is not proof of an alien perpetrator. Crashed and retrieved UFOs, I believe, are the only sources of potential proof. With no official announcement forthcoming to verify their existence, my search into the UFO Hall of Mirrors, health permitting, will continue. In closing, I must add there has been a sustained interest among researchers in my article appearing in the October 1992 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal entitled, The ET Connection . This featured a scientist who claimed eyeball-to-eyeball, telepathic contact with an alien volunteer at a secret U.S. location. Conducted in the 1970s, its purpose, I understand, was to exchange scientific information. Of note, the scientist commented, \"The insectoid's eyes were dominant; they were powerful - riveting. \" After months of silence, the scientist, through his long-time friend, a physicist, who was my intermediary, said he, \"liked my presentation in MUFON.\" Also, in trust, he allowed my friend to give me his identity, which I recognized as a person in the scientific community. Encouraged by this response, we expected more useful information to follow, but in early 1993, my friend called to relate that his source could no longer discuss the subject of UFOs because of certain sensitivities. That was his final word. Attempts to make contact continue by my physicist friend, but as of January 26, 1994, without su ccess. Once again, I am reminded of my many promising but inconclusive ventures into the UFO Hall of Mirrors - the abode of the surreal. Len Stringfield, February 1994, Cincinnati, Ohio.

On their request, I screened and reported UFO activity occurring real time in the tri-state area of so uthwestern Ohio, northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. At that time, many UFO sighting reports came to my home from police departments, sheriff's offices, state police, the media and citizenry. I was assigned a code number - Fox Trot Kilo 3 Zero Blue - which would identify me at the telephone exchange to report by phone to the Air Defense Command Air Filt er Center at Lockbourne AFB in Columbus, Ohio. If my screened UFO report was confirmed by radar, or other means, Air Force interceptors were scrambled. At this point, I was told that the resultant actions were classified. The Air Force paid my phone bills. Published book, Inside Saucer Post 3-0 Blue, in 1957 which reviewed, in part, my cooperation with the U. S. Air Force. 3) Assigned as Early Warning Coordinator for the Colorado Project, headed by Dr. Edward Condon, 1967-1969. This was a government- sponsored scientific group, headquartered in Boulder, Colorado. I screened and reported UFO activity in southwestern Ohio to the project's headquarters. 4) Served as Public Relations Advisor for NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena) under direction of Major Donald E. Keyhoe, Ret., 1957-1970. 5) Served on Board of Directors in public relations capacity for MUFON (Mutual UFO Network), headquartered in Seguin, Texas. This international group, directed by Walter Andrus, is composed of technically oriented field investigators, specialists and consultants throughout the world. Also served as Associate Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal , their monthly magazine. Presently serve as Research Specialist in the field of UFO crash/retrievals. 6) Served as Associate/Investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) under the direction of the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek, astronomer, in the 1970s. Now named in honor of its founder, The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies.
