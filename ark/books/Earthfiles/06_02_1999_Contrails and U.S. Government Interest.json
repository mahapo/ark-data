Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Contrails and U.S. Government Interest Â© 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe June 3, 1999 Swedesboro, New Jersey - Charles and Cathie Warren have lived in Swedesboro, New Jersey for ten years. In the spring of 1999, they heard news reports about mysterious contrail throughout the United States and Canada and started paying more attention to the skies above their New Jersey home south of Philadelphia. Two incidents shocked Charles so much on March 17th and May 23rd, that he put together a web site to share his photographs and information with the public. The result has been hundreds of similar contrail photographs submitted by people from all over the country - and regular visits to his web site by dozens of U. S. government agencies. Interview: Charles Warren, www.contrailconnection.com : \"I live very cl ose to t he airport and I see contrails and air traffic activity all the time, especially for the past ten years. I'm an amateur astronomer. I love looking up at the sky. But I've never seen contrails like this before. And I've never seen planes that can instantly stop contrails from being formed and turn around and repeat the same line in the sky. It just does not make sense. On May 23rd, approximately between 10 and 11 AM, I noticed a contrail event over Gloucester County, New Jersey. It was a saturation of contrails being formed from the south to the north and during the course of the event, I noticed one airplane very high in the sky had formed - I watched him form a complete circle. It looked like it appeared right above the City of Philadelphia and I kept watching. This took place all day approximately to 5 PM and after I reviewed the tape I noticed that there was some strange object, particularly a diamond- shaped object that appeared in two of the frames and then it was instantly gone after the next frame. THE LENGTH OF TIMES BETWEEN THE FRAMES WOULD BE WHAT? What I do is hold the shot in the area of the sky I am videoing for approximately 10 seconds. This way the video capture device I use is able to get a good snap off it. And the diamond shape appeared on seconds two and three of a ten second sequence I was doing. ONE SECOND APART. Exactly. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IN SECOND TWO AND SECOND THREE, THE VERY BRIGHT INTENSE DIAMOND IS IN SECOND TWO AND A LITTLE DIMMER IN SECOND THREE AND THEN BY THE NEXT FRAME YOU'VE GOT THERE, IT APPEARS TO BE GONE. Exactly. Yeah, disappeared. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THE FRAME BEFORE FRAME 2, THERE WAS NOTHING THERE? Right. THIS WAS SOMETHING THAT JUST SUDDENLY APPEARED AND THEN SEEMED TO EITHER FADE OUT OR DISAPPEAR OR SOMETHING. It instantly just vanished from the frame. THIS WAS IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR TRYING TO VIDEOTAPE WHAT APPEARED TO BE A PLANE THAT WAS DOING A CIRCULAR CONTRAIL OVER PHILADELPHIA? Exactly. He was coming from the south at a high altitude and I noticed the plane just instantly turned to the right. Now, this would be right over Philadelphia center city. I ran back in and grabbed my video camera and when I came out, he had about a quarter of a circle done. And I sat there and watched as the entire perfect circle was formed right over the City of Philadelphia. And it also had three other contrail lines running directly through the center of it. IT HAD THREE GOING THROUGH IT AND YOU CAN SEE THAT ON YOUR WEB SITE? Yes, you can clearly see that. MAY 23RD WAS THE DIAMOND-SHAPED OBJECT IN ASSOCIATION WITH A CIRCULAR CONTRAIL. WHAT HAPPENED ON MARCH 17TH? Well, March 17 was pretty unique. I had gone outside and was on my way back in and when I looked up in the sky, there was a checkerboard pattern. And the first thing that came to mind was William Thomas and Art Bell. I had just listened to an archive on the web site. And I ran back in hysterically yelling for my wife. She came outside and you just can't believe what you are seeing - these enormous patterns in the sky! And we watched these planes, three and four in groups, come down from the south heading north. They would start the contrails at a cloud bank, they would fly over and come to an abrupt stop. Then the planes would turn around, go back into this cloud bank and do the same thing over again. And this went on all day long and the final result was a complete cloud cover over the entire area. WHAT YOU WERE WATCHING WHEN IT BEGAN APPEARED TO LOOK LIKE A CHECKERBOARD? There is a clear picture of a checkerboard posted on my web site. THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH MARCH 17TH 1999. That's correct. IF I'VE GOT A PICTURE OF THIS CORRECTLY, THERE WERE SEVERAL PLANES MAKING FIRST HORIZONTAL LINES AND THEN COMING BACK AROUND AND DOING VERTICAL LINES THROUGH THE HORIZONTAL TO MAKE THE CHECKERBOARD? Well, the checkerboard had already been formed. There were three lines running east to west and three lines running north to south. And that was already formed and done with when I had gone outside. What my wife and I witnessed was actually planes doing the north to south lines. What would happen is that the cloud - the contrail would form into a real big puffy cloud. And then the second contrail next to that would kind of join it to make an even bigger cloud. And as"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"this went on, there would be gaps - like if you looked at the sky you could look through and see the clear blue sky through the contrail cloud. Well, you would also witness another contrail airplane come through and fill the area in where they had missed. And that was the only part you could see them. And eventually, it just formed an entire cloud. DID YOU THINK ABOUT CALLING AN AIRPORT TO SAY, 'WHY WOULD THESE PLANES BE MAKING THIS CHECKERBOARD OF CONTRAILS?\" A lot of things have gone through my mind at that time. I had sent several e-mails to people, to news agencies, to the FAA, to the Philadelphia International Airport tower. I never received any response back. NEVER RECEIVED ANY? Never. So, what I decided to do was to put this up on a web page and see if I get any response to it and mailed the address to William Thomas and to a few other people. The word started getting out and I was just amazed at how many other people were having the same experience as I was. One thing that I find funny on my web site is that I have a tracking device on my web site. It collects all the data from visitors that come. And I have so many military hits and government hits and official hits that leave me to believe that they are checking to see what evidence I do post. GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE AGENCIES THAT HAVE CHECKED IN. I've had the United States Senate, I've had NASA, Yucca Mountain, I've had the Army, Navy, Air Force, Air Force Strategic Command Center, I've had Nellis AFB, just to name a few. Everyone I'm able to catch, I post on my web site. WHAT ABOUT THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, THE NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE, THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY, ANY OF THOSE? I've had the CIA, the National Security Agency I believe has been there, the FBI. I've had different research organizations (such as) Langley AFB, contractors for the government that are involved with either airplanes or some type of strategic arms, Boeing has been on my site several times. An enormous amount of really strange hits on my website. THAT GRID PATTERN YOU HAVE DESCRIBED SOUNDS TO ME LIKE SOMEBODY TRYING TO MEASURE KNOWN QUANTITIES AT KNOWN DISTANCES AND KNOWN LENGTHS. It does. I'll tell you another interesting thing. Every time a contrail is reported to me that is going on live, I instantly go onto the internet and try to track it down through a public satellite service. Every time - 100% of the time, Linda, that I have tried to track an event going on now - that particular time is blacked out. Every time. I've been through hundreds of them. And I've only been able to find two photographs that show actual contrail events. All the rest are blocked out. They list satellite times in the archives every 15 minutes. If I go into check, for example, May 1st, 9 AM to 3 PM, 9 AM to 3 PM will be completely blacked out and not accessible. Every date I've checked, and I've checked hundreds of them. ALMOST AS IF SOMEONE IS ANTICIPATING THAT PEOPLE FOLLOWING THE CONTRAIL MYSTERY WOULD BE TRYING TO GET SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Well, they know they are because I post them on my web site, the two I've been able to catch. And it's just - I find it very fascinating that they are able to go in there and black out the exact dates for exact contrail events over the entire United States. And I have people all over the country who try to help me track these and none of them have been able to produce a picture. They show up on satellites. That's what I believe the X's are for. I believe they are spraying an X across a large population in the air and they are able to pinpoint the exact location by using satellites and mark it. Seeing it for myself, really opened my eyes.\" More Information: On May 30, 1999, I reported an interview on Earthfiles and Dreamland radio with Dr. James Baker at the University of Michigan about his discovery that an oily water substance can penetrate bacteria and viruses such as anthrax and small pox and destroy them. Dr. Baker plans to work with the U. S. Army in September 1999 to try different dispersal methods, including dropping the oily substance from the air. Eyewitnesses have wondered if the oily rainbow spectra seen in contrails since at least February might be related to Dr. Baker's discovery and subsequent secret government releases of the harmless material to see how much can reach the ground if sprayed from the air? So far, I have no definite answer, but will continue to research and welcome information on or off the record from Earthfiles and radio listeners. Two more x-shaped contrail photos dated May 14, 1999 at 3:30 PM EST arrived recently from another New Jersey eyewitness, Ed Davieau of Vernon in Sussex County near the New York State border. A bright, round object with a pale corona around it stands out in the sky near the X-shaped contrails."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Mr. Davieau, who took the photographs, wrote: \"There were six large jet aircraft in formation, one behind the other, but offset from one another and quite high. I could see the white 'whatever' coming from the fuselage near where the wings connect. As they passed overhead, three more planes cris-crossed the white trails. Then they all made an abrupt turn and headed west toward Pennsylvania. At the time I took the pictures, I did not see the bright circular objects, nor did I see them while watching the jets continue on.\" We b s it e s : www.contrailconnection.com Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
