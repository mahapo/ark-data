Crop Formations © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Soberton Heath south of Privett had the first crop formation of 2002, as Privett had the first of 2003. West and East Meon and Petersfield have repeatedly received crop formations since the early 1990s. April 29, 2003 - I remembered that the first English formation last year on April 12, 2002, had two small, standing crop circles in its outer ring. They were larger but similar to the two in the ring surrounding the \"broken 8\" or \"truncated infinity symbol\" that is the first English crop formation in 2003. See: Earthfiles 04-26-03 . I have no idea what the meaning might be, nor what the source of their creation is, but thought I would share the comparison in this report.

Both formations have two small \"beads\" in their outer rings. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Soberton, Hampshire, U. K., April 12, 2002. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Peter R. Sorensen April 20, 2003, Privett, Hampshire, England, aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle. Both Formations Difficult to See From Ground Last year of 2002, James Andrews reported to cropcircleconnector.com that he \"spotted a circle on Friday, April 12, in a field of oilseed rape in Hampshire. ...it is on a slight hillside that is really only visible from one direction,\" at the northeast end of Long Road, which is close to the village of Soberton in Hampshire. This year of 2003, photographer, author and long-experienced crop formation investigator, Lucy Pringle, reported that she tried to find the Privett formation with specific directions from pilot and photographer David Russell who had flown over the field, but could not until April 29, when she finally reached the formation with the farmer's help.
