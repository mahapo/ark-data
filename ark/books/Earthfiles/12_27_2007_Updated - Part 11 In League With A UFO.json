Return to Part 1 Updated - Email received December 28, 2007, from a hypnotherapist concerning this Chapter 8, Meat Market: Subject: Procedure Witnessed. Date: December 28, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I am a hypnotherapist and with regard to Earthfiles Part 11 (Chapter 8) of the League book, I wanted to let you know about a client I had. Her name was Terri and she was an abductee or experiencer. I was working with her for a missing time experience and something interesting came up during her hypnosis session. What she recounted was an abduction where she was not the subject of any experimentation, but she was, for whatever "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reason, allowed to witness an alien soul or consciousness transference into the body of an transient human male. She described USAF uniforms of the officers that were present during the procedure. She said it apparently was being done in what might have been a large building like an aircraft hanger. After the procedure was done she was released unharmed. This would have occurred in the early 1990s. Terri was basically a housewife and I was never able to learn from her why she was allowed to see the procedure being done. Her husband was not in the military, although she did live in close proximity to what used to be Carswell AFB in Fort Worth, Texas, now Naval Air Station Fort Worth.” December 27, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 8, Meat Market. ***** Chapter 8 Meat Market “W hat was horrifying, though, was the sensation of the other body sucking him into it. If it were not for the fact that Bill was under some kind of Alien sedative, his mind would not have been strong enough to survive that transformation.” T he committee added five living human bodies to its inventory. The scientists procured the five mortally injured men from across the country. Details about where they were taken from or why the men were dying was not made known. The committee kept the living bodies stored in the incubator room until a decision was made about what to do with them. The military requested that four bodies be released to them. Most on the committee were in favor of giving the military what they asked for. It was enough that the scientists had to keep one Frankenstein in their midst, but having six of them made everyone who had to work around the living bodies extremely uncomfortable. The committee had converted the other five bodies because presumably the Pentagon had ordered the conversion. The decision to give up the bodies was made while Bill Smith was absent. As soon as he discovered what was about to take place, Bill intervened. He was against giving the military possession of the bodies, but he gave no reason for his resistance. Bill was the only one on the committee who was able to stop the bodies from being taken by the military, even though the military had already made plans to receive the bodies and had no intention of delaying that transactin. Apparently Bill Smith had influenced the high command in other than earthly ways. Bill never made it a part of the record, but he told one of his trusted friends that he was with the Aliens when they dropped in on a certain General and abducted him. During the abduction, Bill Smith was not privy to all that was \"suggested\" to the General by the Aliens, but the General was made aware that he would put on hold his military request for the living male bodies. There was nothing else done to the General at that time and the whole episode took less than ten minutes, including the time it took to return the General to his bedroom. That same week, while on board the Alien craft, Bill found himself in the same room with one of the bodies that the committee had recently converted. Bill Smith was told that the Aliens were going to let him leave his human body and enter into one of the other male bodies. [ Editor's Note: Please see Earthfiles 03/31/2007 and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness in Earthfiles Shop. ] At first, the whole idea terrified him. The Aliens assured Bill that it was"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"strictly his choice. If Bill was not ready for that kind of experience, it was fine with the Aliens and they would put it off for another time. Bill decided to do it. The Aliens instructed Bill to enter into an adjacent room. The room glowed with the same color of yellow as did the room he and the committee called the incubator room. The Aliens wasted no time and quickly placed him under a trance. After a few seconds, Bill Smith felt himself become detached from his body. Then it was as if someone lifted him out through the top of his head. It all happened exactly like what Bill had read about in books describing out-of-body experiences. These people claimed to have had what was called a “near death experience.” There are documented cases detailing events about how people die from some accident or illness and then are resuscitated back to life - or are sent back by an omnipotent being because of some unfinished business the person still has on Earth. There were hundreds of these reports in the 1970s and 1980s. As with any phenomena, there are plenty of skeptics. Bill was one of the biggest doubters. Like many, Bill thought it was pure nonsense, “ and that the whole thing could be explained by the chemicals that are released naturally by a dying body.” One of Bill's favorite stories from the 1980s was that when the body was going through the trauma called “death,” the person dying was remembering when he originally came into this world through the mother's birth canal. According to the skeptics, the bright light of the delivery room is what the dying person sees as he desperately tries to keep from sliding into the abyss of death. The stories described how the person who died found himself floating to the top of the room and looking down at his body. Sometimes, the near-death- experiencer (NDE) described seeing doctors and nurses working frantically trying to revive the body. Some of the NDE people stayed on this plane of existence for a period of time and then got sucked back into their bodies when the doctors succeeded in reviving them. Others reported that in the moment of death, they were sucked through what looked like a tunnel at a high rate of speed. At the end of that tunnel, the NDE person is greeted by loved ones, aunts, grandparents or friends who had passed away earlier. Then the NDE person visits with a Being that radiated warm light. The Being was full of love and compassion for the person. The Being showed the NDE experiencer his entire life, but did not judge them. Bill Smith did not die and get whisked away, but he did experience the same curiosity of his own body as he hovered over it. He knew it was his body, but seeing himself from a new perspective was shocking. He looked different from what he had expected. What was horrifying, though, was the sensation of the other body sucking him into it. If it were not for the fact that Bill was under some kind of Alien sedative, his mind would not have been strong enough to survive that transformation. Once he was in the other body, it felt natural to him. Bill was aware that this other body did not need to eat or drink and that the Alien contraption inside was what sustained it. Bill could not feel the object that was inside the body and was only aware of it because he knew it was there from the X-ray the committee had taken of it back in the lab. The body radiated vitality. Bill Was not sure if it was because the body was that of a younger man? Or because it was energized by the Alien battery-pack? The body was fully clothed, so Bill did not need to get dressed. Bill took his personal belongings, wallet and keys out of the pants of his dormant body and was ready to go. Before he could ask the Aliens about the picture on his driver's license, the Aliens told him to look in his wallet. Bill's license was changed and his I. D. fit the image of the new body. The Aliens told Bill to have fun with his new self and to take a week to explore how it felt. Bill decided that in order to become comfortable in the new body, he would first mingle with people who were strangers to him. Bill then went out to some of the favorite hangouts where his friends and colleagues might be. When Bill encountered someone he knew, he struck up a conversation. Bill was surprised that his colleagues from the committee, who were familiar with the body Bill was inhabiting, had no clue that they were talking to Bill, or that the body the committee had worked around for months was now having a drink and a conversation with them. Bill Smith tried to give himself away by using some of his old mannerisms. When that failed, Bill tried talking about some of the same likes and dislikes"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that their common friend, Bill Smith, had. Nothing worked. His colleagues never suspected who Bill was. The scientists merely assumed that it was friendship with a stranger. Bill's wife and family did not miss him during that week. It was not uncommon for Bill to be away from home for days and weeks at a time. Bill wanted badly to disclose to some of his friends who he was, just to see the expressions on their faces. But after thinking about it, Bill realized that his friends would only think him insane. If his friends believed him, they would probably have a heart attack. As he walked around the city in the new body, he wondered how many other humans were counterfeits, like himself? There was no human way of knowing that answer. The Aliens never gave Bill a clue about that question, but the Aliens did say Bill would know sometime in the future. Bill thought that if anyone could detect a spark of who he really was, it would be his family. So Bill posed as an insurance salesman and went to his own house. His wife refused his solicitations and did not let him inside the home. Bill was glad she refused him entry. It was a “stupid idea,” he reminded himself. If anyone made the connection, it could only prove harmful to them. That was the lesson the Aliens wanted Bill to learn. Bill was sent down to mingle with people, knowing that he would want to share his secrets with his fellow man - secrets that Bill thought were too fantastic to keep locked up inside of himself. At times, Bill thought he would go mad! He felt a strong need to tell someone what he was capable of doing. After the week had passed, Bill returned to the spot where he was scheduled to meet the Aliens. The encounter took place at a house that had a “For Sale” sign on it and was vacant. He met with two Aliens who were disguised as real estate agents. In the house, Bill found his real body waiting for him. It had been kept alive with an external apparatus that covered his body's mouth and nose. Bill was still not comfortable seeing his body that way and it scared him. The Aliens gave him a sedative and quickly returned him to his own body. The Aliens performed a different procedure than they had done in the craft before. As Bill stood next to his body, the Aliens simply fitted a device on his head and siphoned him out of the temporary body and deposited him back into his old self. It was a totally different sensation from the last time. It was quicker and Bill hardly knew what happened. Bill went back to the office and convened a meeting with the committee. He told them what he had done and what the implications of that new information meant to the scientists. For those who did not believe Bill, he described the details of his encounter for them. Still skeptical, his colleagues replied that Bill could have gotten that information from the individual that he claimed to be. Bill then told the committee exactly what they were each thinking at the time Bill met with them in the body of the other man. Finally, Bill told them that he would duplicate with the scientists what had been done to him by using another body that was in storage. Bill asked for volunteers. During the time Bill occupied the other body, he was clairvoyant. He knew the thoughts of people simply by visualizing their faces or looking at them. He had a feeling that the phenomena was part of being detached from one's own body and not necessarily because he was in a mutated human body. But Bill was not sure if that were true. Four scientists from the committee volunteered to go through the procedure. That surprised Bill. He did not expect any one of them to try it. Bill had never done the procedure, but he assumed the know-how would come to him as he needed it - at least he hoped it would. Bill explained to the volunteers that the results of what each was going to do were not absolute. After that revelation, three volunteers withdrew. Tim, the one who did not pull back, was eager to proceed. Bill took no chances and decided to perform the transfer in the incubator room rather than use the portable system that seemed less complicated than the one on the craft. Bill felt more assured of himself doing complicated procedures while in the craft. There was a sense that he was never alone when he was in the ship. The Aliens had left the portable system with him and disposed of the body that he had used. They gave him no explanation about why they left the portable unit or why the Aliens disposed of the body rather than return it to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the incubator room. The Aliens implanted complicated information and procedures directly into Bill's subconscious mind (a lot like pre-loaded software that comes with some computers.) The Aliens did this because the amount and type of information Bill needed to know could never be learned by the human mind on its own. Nor could just any human be trusted with what the Aliens downloaded into Bill's mind. All the equipment that the Aliens used on Bill was also available in the craft that the committee possessed. Bill was able to identify the equipment needed for the transfer-to-another-body procedure, even though he only saw it used by the Aliens once.
