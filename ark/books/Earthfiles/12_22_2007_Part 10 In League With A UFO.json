Return to Part 1 December 22, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 7, The Second Encounter continued. “‘H umans are not even in dominion of their own soul!’ All the body containers on earth belong to the Aliens. The Aliens did not disclose to Bill who owns the souls - just that the Aliens had no claim to that part of humanity.” - Author Bill Smith (not real name of committee member and human abductee) advanced to where he was allowed to roam freely aboard the craft. The craft moved at speeds that are inconceivable if taken out of the realm of science fiction. The Aliens let Bill choose the destination and as quickly as it formed in his mind, the craft was half way there. He visited every country on earth and even spent time on the moon. The Aliens declined his request to visit the planet Jupiter, a favorite of his, and told him that other parts of the solar system were still off limits to him. But the Aliens told him that possibly in the future, Bill would be able to visit some of them. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"While on the moon, he was not encumbered by a bulky space suit or any space suit, but was attended by a bubble of air that surrounded him wherever he went. The bubble was invisible and emanated from a device the size of a butane lighter that he kept in one of his pockets. It frustrated Bill that the Aliens did not indulge others in the committee. It made it difficult for him to share his excitement with them since the committee remained suspicious of Bill and his tales of adventures, especially of those that took place on the moon. All the committee members did spend time with the Aliens, but the scientists were not allowed to remember what took place. Bill told them that they were treated no differently than the majority of those who are abducted, except that he was able to verify that it did happen to them. His colleagues questioned Bill about why the scientists were taken, but not allowed to remember the incident as Bill was able to. Bill could not give them answers. Bill could only relay to the committee what happened to him with the Aliens - which implied only what Bill was allowed to remember with the Aliens. The Aliens told Bill to discourage his colleagues from going to anyone for regression therapy. Ever since the time that Bill told his colleagues that they had been abducted, some of the scientists did not believe Bill and were considering undergoing regression to confirm whether an abduction had taken place. The Aliens pointed out to Bill that they can implant whatever memories they want into the subconscious of humans and that many of the recalled episodes are intentionally painful and misleading. The human abductees are programmed that way to dissuade the abducted from learning the truth about what really happened to them. “A truth that is not for them to know and is none of their business to know!” Bill was told that humans in the western world have the illusion that each man, woman and child has “personal rights.” That belief is not prevalent in the rest of the world. “Humans do not own their bodies. They are on loan to them. To own something,” the Aliens told Bill, “ means you have control of it.” What human has control of his body? No human can keep his body from dying or from becoming ill. The only thing that humans can do is feed and take care of their bodies - not much more complicated than putting fuel in a car and changing the oil once in awhile. “Humans are not even in dominion of their own soul!” All the body containers on earth belong to the Aliens. The Aliens did not disclose to Bill who owns the souls - just that the Aliens had no claim to that part of humanity. On his last two encounters with the Aliens, they showed Bill how to perform some of the medical procedures that he and the committee had been struggling with. That new information helped to convince his colleagues that Bill was either a genius - or did, in fact, have contact with the Aliens. Because of the complexity of what the Aliens demonstrated to him, Bill could only perform the procedures on board the Alien craft. The craft provided a level of purity that did not exist anywhere outside of the craft. It was also less strenuous, similar to being on the moon with its reduced gravitational pull. Working while on board the Alien craft allowed the Aliens to perform with ease and speed that was impossible anywhere else. The purity of the air helped them to think more clearly and the Aliens performed superhumanly while in the Alien ship. Bill showed his colleagues how to repair a severely damaged heart. The committee operated on a woman who was badly injured in a one-car accident. She ran off the road after leaving a bar. Like the rest of the people that the committee acquires, the woman had no family and no friends that could be identified. The hospital that she was taken to had given up on her and expected her to die that same morning. When the committee received her, she was already declared brain dead by her physician. Her body was still alive, but her heart and liver were damaged beyond human ability to repair them. The committee was going to repair her heart and then repair her damaged liver. Bill and two others, who were accomplished surgeons, operated on her. Although they were good at what they did, their hands were guided by an invisible force far superior to them. During the open-heart surgery, Bill left the craft for only a moment to get more sutures. The committee did not have a nurse, so they took turns fetching"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"things. Bill left at a point where she was in a stabilized condition. When he returned six minutes later, he found the other two surgeons standing over the dead body. They both had a confused look on their faces. Outside the craft, the surgeons told Bill that everything that they were doing during the operation seemed clear and made sense until Bill left the craft. The surgeons then reverted to knowing only what each had learned in medical school and in their practices before coming into the committee's program. Gift of Knowledge Apparently the Aliens gave Bill a gift that he was not aware of. He had a reservoir of knowledge installed into his subconscious mind. The information only came to him as he need it and shared with all those who need to know the information who are around him. It was obvious to Bill that he was being primed for something, but what? Much of what was stored in his head by the Aliens was not available to anyone but him. He was not aware of all his capabilities and only became so when he actually needed the information. He was the best doctor in the world and getting better by the day. He was able to diagnose and repair afflictions that would baffle the best doctors. But Bill could not publish any of his knowledge. The information came only when he needed it for a work in progress and left as soon as the job was done. Bill tried many times to write down some of the procedures soon after he performed them, but was unable to make any sense of what he had just done. So, Bill was unable to share his knowledge with his colleagues, which only intensified the distrust the committee already felt between them and Bill. The committee saw that as proof that Bill was trying to isolate himself from them. Bill decided it was pointless for him to work with the others and he knew the feeling was mutual. The committee were uncomfortable working around Bill. The scientists wanted to comprehend what they were doing and not merely be extra hands for Bill Smith. Mutually, the committee agreed that Bill would work on his own projects. Bill was absent from the office most of the time. When he was there, he breached the security system with his unusual mode of movement. The security system that monitored all who entered and left the premises showed that Bill, who used to be the first to arrive at work and the last to leave, was not bypassing the security guards altogether. It was prohibited - not to mention impossible - for anyone to enter or leave the building without passing through security first. Yet Bill was observed working in his office many times, even when the security roster indicated that he was not in the building. Bill's supervisor approached him with that concern, assuring Bill that he understood how he was able to breach the security field, but that Bill should adhere to the same rules that everyone else in the department followed for the sake of morale. Although Bill was a much humbler person than he used to be, he felt that his special circumstances allowed him certain privileges. He explained to his superior that because of his new abilities, the Aliens expected more from Bill and required more of his time. Bill came and left by way of the Aliens' supernatural means many times during the day and night and could not be restricted. Bill was not beaming up and down from the Alien ship like they do on Star Trek, but his mode of coming and going was not discernible. Bill's boss knew that no one could stop Bill from doing what he needed to do or wanted to do. Bill was the only connection to the Aliens the committee had, so the boss conceded to Bill's requirements. Bill had become the committee - no other member made any substantial contribution to the program. At the weekly meetings, the whole focus was on Bill, what he had discovered and most importantly, what Bill was willing to divulge to the rest of the committee members. At one of the committee meetings, Bill suggested that the committee should not add any more people to the program. “The number of people that were involved with the Alien craft was already excessive,” he told the scientists. Since it was impossible to shift people into other less secretive programs, Bill suggested that the program be allowed to shrink through attrition. Although Bill was exempt from the high security measures, Bill was against lowering the security and had some suggestions about how to make the committee more secure without more burdens."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Aliens gave Bill something that was similar to a computer chip to be used for the new security system. It was the size of a period at the end of a sentence. The chip could be placed anywhere on the body. It monitored the location of the recipient twenty-four hours a day. When placed on the body, the chip embedded itself below the skin and remained visible as a freckle or small blemish. This eliminated the need to do a body search and allowed the committee members to come and go with considerably less restraint. The Alien unit that monitored the chip was fashioned to look and perform as if it were a man-made machine. The chip contained all applicable information about the individual and allowed that individual access only to his or her assigned place of duty. Surprisingly, there was no objection by committee members or from any of the people who worked there. Everyone was happy to do away with the old and humiliating system. The scientists had become adapted to having their every move monitored, so inserting a tiny device under their skin was just another part of the job. How much control Bill had over those who were on the base was not known, nor could anyone know. But when Bill suggested something, there were few who challenged him. Those who did always came around to Bill's point of view before the committee meeting adjourned. It was obvious that Bill's insights were much keener than anyone there, which could explain why the scientists deferred to his ideas. His manner was so gentle that it was difficult to get mad at him. He never lost his temper and was always composed. Did he have the committee under a spell? Bill himself was under Alien influence. The person that was known as the original Bill Smith faded away. Something much more than Bill ever was or could have been on his own now emerged. In every physical aspect, Bill was the same person. For those who did not know him before his abductions, the slow transformation Bill went through was hardly noticeable. He seemed normal, except for the fact that his IQ was so high.
