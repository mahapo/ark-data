April 16, 2000 Delta, Colorado - Recently on Dreamland radio, I have reported about discoveries of secret microwave radar bases and monitoring of craft of unknown origin in New Mexico in the 1940s and beyond. My reports provoked one listener, Dale Patrone of Delta, Colorado, to FAX me concerning his own encounter with a round disc on top of a snow-covered mountain near Miracle Mile, Wyoming on March 28, 1977 after a raging blizzard. Dale, his brother and sister-in-law and another friend had camped along the Platte River for a fishing holiday northwest of Medicine Bow. Dale, now 44 years old and a miner most of his life, had never seen anything like the disc's blackish-brown, glassy-metallic surface - nor the dozens of odd symbols embedded around its edge. Interview: Dale Patrone, Miner, Delta, Colorado: \"Around 9 o'clock at night, the storm subsided and it became very quiet outside. We were playing cards in this trailer and were cramped up. It was a small pull trailer. And so, I went outside, opened "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the door. It was a completely star lit night above us. IN OTHER WORDS, THIS VIOLENT SNOW STORM HAD JUST ALMOST IMMEDIATELY GONE AND THE SKY ABOVE WAS CLEAR? Yes. What was unusual is that it formed almost a perfect circle around us and in the distance, you could see the clouds were rolled up and the storm was still raging and continuing on. You could still hear it in the background. Well, I started walking up this hill. I had a flashlight in my hand and a friend of mine was following behind me. And I was going up this mountain that seemed to be terraced in three levels. And it was quite steep, so when I got up there to the top I was the first one up when I walked upon this UFO that was on the ground. It was a large, circular-shaped disc. WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU WANT TO CLIMB THIS MOUNTAIN RIGHT AFTER A RAGING SNOW STORM? I have no idea to this day, to tell you the truth. I have no idea whatsoever. YET, WHEN YOU GOT UP AT THE TOP, YOU ARE LOOKING AT FRESH SNOW WITH NO TRACKS IN IT? Ye s . SITTING ABOUT HOW FAR FROM YOU AT THAT POINT WAS THIS ROUND OBJECT? When I crested the top of the hill, it was approximately 25 feet from where the top of the hill, from where I climbed up to the ship that had landed was. SO, YOU ARE SAYING THAT WHEN YOU GOT TO THE TOP, HERE WAS A TOTALLY STRANGE OBJECT ONLY ABOUT 25 FEET FROM YOU? Ye s . NOW, YOU'VE GOT YOUR FLASHLIGHT AND YOU ARE SHINING YOUR LIGHT ON THE BRIGHT SNOW AND THIS OBJECT. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT IN YOUR FLASHLIGHT? It was kind of a glowy, or a shiny, metallic blackish-brown. DID YOU APPROACH IT? Yes. I walked up to it when I noticed these blocks that were raised blocks approximately an inch and a half apart, these blocks. Then I noticed the hieroglyphics that were printed in the edge of the ship. There were things like lightning bolts. The only thing I've been able to compare the symbols to is Egyptian hieroglyphics, but those are much different."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sketch by Dale Patrone on April 15, 2000 of the 150 foot diameter disc that appeared to have been molded from a blackish-brown glassy substance that included raised rectangles spaced 1.5 inches apart over the entire surface around the central dome (only a few examples in sketch). Strange symbols or hieroglyphs were embedded around the disc's perimeter edge. THEY ARE NOT EGYPTIAN. CAN YOU EXPLAIN IF THEY WERE CARVED INTO THIS POLISHED GLASSY SURFACE? OR WERE THEY RAISED ABOVE THE GLASSY SURFACE? I would have to say they were almost stamped into it, but there wasn't no indentations. It was almost like it was coated. They were definitely there, but you could not feel them. SO IT WASN'T LIKE THEY WERE CARVED INTO THE SURFACE? Not at all. WERE THEY A DIFFERENT COLOR? No. SO HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE THERE? They just showed themselves like Roman numerals would show if you had stamped them and then coated over them. ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PRESSED INTO WHATEVER THIS CRAFT WAS MADE OUT OF AND THEN THE GLASSY SURFACE WAS PUT OVER THEM? Correct. SO YOU COULD SEE THEM SORT OF UNDERNEATH THIS GLASSY SURFACE? Ye s . DID YOU PUT YOUR HANDS AND RUN YOUR FINGERS AROUND THE EDGE WHERE THE SYMBOLS WERE? Ye s . DESCRIBE HOW THAT FELT? It was still smooth as glass. DID THESE SYMBOLS GO ALL AROUND THE CRAFT? DID YOU WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WHOLE CRAFT WITH YOUR FLASHLIGHT LOOKING AT THEM? No, I did not. But they did continue on around the craft. WHY DIDN'T YOU WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND? Because when I started knocking on it to see what type of metal it was made out of, it started glowing red like a fluorescent red. And I jumped back in shock. It startled me. I jumped maybe a foot or foot and a half back and it shot up above my head and stopped about 100 feet above my head. And then it sent out a large green beam of light and I was engulfed in this green beam of light. And I was filled with an enormous sense of energy, a sense of energy like I've never experienced. Then it took from me everything I had ever seen, tasted, felt and touched from the time I was that age (21) clear back to the time I was an embryo in my mother's womb. I got to see that like a tape being played out. It was like taking from my life experience everything I've ever seen or tasted or felt or touched. DID THIS PLAY OUT IN YOUR HEAD SORT OF LIKE WATCHING A 3-DIMENSIONAL MOVIE? Yes, it was just like being taken from you. I turned and it's a good thing that it retracted its beam because it was almost like I was going to fly off the mountain."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"And when it retracted its beam, it started bright white and it shot up another thousand or fifteen hundred feet and then slowly started across the sky, speeding up as it went until it left a meteor trail like a falling star. WHEN THAT GREEN BEAM HAD ENGULFED YOU AND YOU FELT LIKE YOUR MIND AND ALL OF YOUR EXPERIENCES AND EVERYTHING WERE SORT OF BEING UPLOADED FROM YOU, DID YOU GET ANY KIND OF A MENTAL IMPRESSION OF WHO WAS DOING THE DOWNLOADING? OR WHY THEY WERE DOING THE DOWNLOADING? No, I did not. It's not like you see the large-eyed little green men or anything like that.\" More Information: Dale Patrone's experience of having his entire life downloaded while he watched, reminded me of a similar event that other Colorado residents had endured three years later in November 1980 north of Boulder.

Later under hypnosis, the husband recalled seeing tall, Oriental-looking beings who placed a tube to his head.

It's like there's a tunnel that goes through my mind to theirs. Everything in my mind is stripped. Got the whole thing. They've just pulled everything right out of me!\" Then the husband said his mind was restored to normal and he realized that information had been added. This is what he remembered: \"There's more to it than anybody knows. There's more to life, more to the world. There's more to everything than anybody knows. ...Things co-existing. There are other dimensions ... more than three dimensions. Everywhere, it all works together. Everything co-exists. There's different dimensions we can't go into.\" For the entire story and hypnosis transcripts of the Colorado couple's experiences in 1980, please see my book An Alien Harvest - Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien Life Forms © 1989 listed in the earthfiles.com Shop and amazon.com.
