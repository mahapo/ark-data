I’ve never seen anything like this.” - R icky Sorrells, Metal Welder and Machinist, Dublin, Texas A triangle of three small tow ns southwest of Fort Worth includes Stephenville, a city in and the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population 14,921 in 2000 census. Dublin about eight miles southwest has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Selden with a full time population of about seven. Updated with computer graphic illustration below on January 24, 2008 January 18, 2008 Dublin, Texas - The first week of January 2008, came with shocks for at least three dozen people living in Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas, southwest of Fort Worth. The shocks were yellow, red, blue and white lights that showed up after sunset – lights so bright that eyewitnesses compared them to a welder’s torch. Some of the red lights moved together in pairs. Other red, blue and yellow lights moved around as if “dancing” with each other and then would all turn to a bright, white light and disappear. Even pilots were eyewitnesses and estimated unidentified lights moving at least 3,000 miles per hour. One of those pilots is Steve Allen of Selden, Texas, not far from Glen Rose. Mr. Allen is owner of L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight in Glen Rose. It was Tuesday, January 8, about 6:15 PM when he noticed flashing, white lights about 3,500 feet above the ground. He told ABC network News that the lights formed a rectangle pattern that “spanned about a mile long and a half mile wide and the pattern was headed toward Stephenville at 3,000 miles per hour.” While watching, Mr. Allen said the white lights changed into two sets of huge rectangular patterns in the sky and then disappeared. But 10 minutes later, the lights returned and “ two military jets, possibly F-16s, were in pursuit.” That was Tuesday, January 8. A week before on or around New Year’s Day, 37-year-old metal welder and machinist Ricky Sorrells felt like going deer hunting in the back woods of his Dublin, Texas, home that he shares with his wife and two daughters. Dublin is only"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"about 8 miles west of Stephenville. Both of those small towns form a triangle with close-by Selde n. The sun was a just lowering below some oak trees near his house and Ricky thought he had enough time. He put on his hunting camouflage, grabbed his rifle that was set at 9-Power for deer hunting, and headed for his feeders and a game trail. Little did Ricky know that he was about to encounter something so large just above his woods that he could not even see the edges of the huge craft. This New Years shock would also be the only day light description so far of what might be flying around at night only visible by the odd patterns of changing, intense lights. Interview: R icky Sorrells, metal welder and machinist, at his Dublin, Texas, residence where he has seen a huge aerial craft three times since January 1, 2008. Image © 2008 by Stephenville Empire-Tri bune. Ricky Sorrells, Metal Welder and Machinist, Dublin, Texas: “For some reason, I don’t know what, I look up and look back down. I don’t know what made me look up, but then I realized what I had seen with my eyes and immediately looked back up. There was this thing. It covered from – I could not see the edges in my tree canopy. I couldn’t see the front of it. I didn’t think about looking behind me to see if I could see an edge that way. BUT YOU MEAN THAT ABOVE YOU THE SKY IS NOW COMPLETELY OBLITERATED BY SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO YOU? Yes, ma’am. How far underneath it I was, I’m not for sure, but apparently I walked underneath this thing. When I first realized it and looked up, I thought: ‘What in the world is this?’ I raised my rifle up and because I was in such a hurry to go deer hunting and knew I was going into the woods, I did not turn it (hunting scope) down from 9X to 3X. So, when I raised my rifle up, it’s still on 9X. It was real blurry. I immediately turned down my rifle scope power to 3X and I looked back up there at it and I can see what I would call a ‘mirage’ coming off of it. It wasn’t steam. I don’t know really – I’ve seen it like on a hot highway how the heat waves come up. And this was coming down. I really didn’t know what to think. I was not scared, so I dropped my gun. And then I really started noticing how big this thing was. I also noticed that it had these round indentations. They were in a grid pattern all running left to right, and front to back. They were all placed about 40 feet apart. They were deep, like maybe 4 to 6 feet deep into this craft. It basically looked like a piece of sheet iron that had been pressed. I couldn’t see any nuts, no bolts, no rivets, no welds, no seams. I was really studying the structure of this trying to get an idea about how it was built."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"R icky Sorrells drew for Earthfiles his perspective looking up through the trees on his property at a “tin barn grey” metal emitting “mirage heat waves” and embedded with cone-shaped holes he thought were equally separated by forty feet over the entire surface of the aerial craft above him. Ricky judged that the aerial craft was 300 feet above him and the trees. He also estimated the surface diameter of the cones was about six feet, tapering another six to eight feet down into a cone-shaped hole that ended in a three-foot-diameter circle. Below is a drawing focused on one of the cone-shaped holes. Drawings © 2008 by Ricky Sorrells for Earthfiles.com. C lose-up of one of the many cone-shaped holes embedded into the surface of the aerial craft that obliterated the sky above Ricky Sorrells on January 1, 2008, and above the woods on his Dublin, Texas, property where Ricky had gone to hunt deer. Draw ing © 2008 by Ricky Sorrells for Earthfiles.com. COULD YOU ESTIMATE WHAT THE DIAMETER WAS OF EACH OF THESE HOLES? IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, THESE ARE HOLES IN THE BOTTOM OF THIS GIGANTIC OBJECT ABOVE YOU, BUT THE HOLES ARE IN STRAIGHT LINES. The holes, to me, are placed strategically at points equally spaced apart. They were big. I really don’t know how big they were, but I’m going to guess. I’m going to say from where I was at, they were anywhere from – they looked like 3 feet wide to me down on the ground, but I’m sure they were larger. Maybe 6 feet. SO THESE ARE 6 FEET IN DIAMETER, 6 FEET ACROSS, HOLES THAT ARE PENETRATING INTO THE BOTTOM OF THIS OTHERWISE FLAT METALLIC SURFACE? Yes, ma’am. They go up, they dome up to another small circle at the top (deeper in the craft skin). They are indented. If you’ll visualize the inside edges penetrating to a smaller diameter circle which was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"smaller than half the larger circle on the surface. SO, LIKE A CONE? Ye s . GOING FROM 6 FEET AND TAPERING DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET, STILL BEING CIRCULAR. HOW MUCH DISTANCE DO Y OU THINK IT WAS FROM THE FLAT SURFACE WHERE THE HOLES BEGAN TO WHERE THEY TAPERED INTO THOSE 3-FOOT-DIAMETER CONE BOTTOMS, SO TO SPEAK? Boy, I don’t know. Again, I couldn’t see any rivets, bolts or welds to give me any indication of how far apart they were. HOW DEEP DO YOU THINK THOSE HOLES WERE? I think they would have been 8 to 10 feet, maybe. It wasn’t a short, stubby hole. It wasn’t an elongated hole. It was in proportion, if that makes sense. WERE THE HOLES CONNECTED BY ANY LINES OR GROOVES RUNNING BETWEEN THE HOLES? No, ma’am, they were not, not that I saw. The holes were spaced out equally, front to back and left to right. But they had nothing connecting them. Color of Huge Aerial Craft Was “Barn Tin Grey” WAS THE COLOR OF THE HOLES THAT WERE SPACED ABOUT 40 FEET APART DIFFERENT FROM THE SURFACE? No, everything was the same color. I actually have a piece of barn tin that’s been faded – it’s not rusted – and it's that color - that greyish, faded color. IS THAT CLOSE TO A SIDEWALK OR DARKER? Darker, I suppose. R icky Sorrells worked with his computer tech colleague, Colby Reynolds in Stephenville, to provided this computer-generated grey color that is close to the “barn tin grey” of the huge aerial craft embedded with cone-shaped holes. Entire Aerial Craft Looked Like A Single Mold “I don’t know how you can make a piece of metal that large with no bolts, rivets, seams or welds. I’ve never seen anything like this.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"O n New Year's Day 2008, Ricky Sorrells saw the sunset sky replaced by a \"barn tin grey\" and flat metal embedded with cone-shaped holes as far as he could see - \"at least three football field lengths (1,000 feet).\" Each cone-shaped hole was separated from the others by an estimated 40 feet; each cone-shaped hole was about 6 feet in diameter and 6 to 8 feet deep.

IS THE SURFACE YOU ARE LOOKING AT THROUGH YOUR RIFLE SCOPE IN WHICH YOU HAVE TURNED DOWN THE SCOPE POWER FROM 9X TO 3X TO SEE DETAILS, ARE YOU LOOKING AT A SURFACE AS YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS A MACHINIST IS METALLIC? Is it metal or not? I don’t know. I didn’t get to touch or feel it in any way. I believe it was maybe. I don’t know. I don’t know how you can make that – which is what baffled me in my mind – I don’t know how you can make a piece of metal that large with no bolts, rivets, seams or welds. I’ve never seen anything like this. MEANING THAT YOU’VE SEEN EVERY ASPECT OF WELDING AND WORKING WITH METAL, BUT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING THAT SEEMED TO BE A GIGANTIC MOLD? Correct, it was like a huge, single mold. That’s it exactly, yes ma’am. Longer Than 3 Football Fields RICKY, HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK THE SURFACE COVERING EVERYTHING ABOVE YOU, HOW HIGH WAS THAT ABOVE YOU? I believe it to be right at 300 feet. The reason I think this is because I’ve been on grain elevators. When I was growing up, I worked in a grain elevator for my Dad. What we had was a 90-foot elevator. So, I put three of these together in my head from where I was at and that’s how I get the height. IF IT’S 300 FEET ABOVE YOU AND IT’S TAKING UP ALL OF THE SKY ABOVE YOU, DO YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATE NOW LOOKING BACK ABOUT HOW BIG THE CRAFT MIGHT HAVE BEEN? It is huge! I’ve actually been back into the woods and looked. In my mind, I did the football field measurement. I know it was longer than 3 football fields. WHICH WOULD BE 900 TO 1,000 FEET LONG. Ye s . THERE WAS AN ESTIMATE BY ANOTH ER EYEWITNESS IN YOUR AREA WHO I BELIEVE SAID THEY WERE ESTIMATING WHAT THEY SAW WAS A MILE BY A HALF MILE. Yes, ma’am, that’s what I’ve heard. THAT WOULD BE 5,280 FEET BY HALF THAT."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ye s . DO YOU THINK IT’S FEASIBLE THAT WHAT WAS ABOVE YOU THE FIRST OF JANUARY OUT IN YOUR WOODS COULD HAVE BEEN A MILE LONG? With relationship with the other two I seen after this over pretty much the same spot, from my third time I seen it, if it was, it would not surprise me. I have not seen any edges on this thing, on any three sightings. I have basically seen flat surfaces. If it were, it wouldn’t surprise me because in my trees there, I just went from as far as I could see one way to as far as I could see another way and figured it was three hundred yards. While I was looking at this (craft), it drifted to the right by about 100 feet. And I remember looking to my left to see if I could see the edge of this thing. And I could not see the edge of it. I turned back to my right, and I was like, ‘Wow, this is crazy!’ And now, I’m rushed with emotion as far as ‘What is it? What is it going to do next? Do I need to get out of here?’ Huge Craft Went from Stationary to Distance in A Second I’m actually trying to figure out about my safety, if I should be alarmed? At this moment, if I would have blinked, I would have thought it vanished. But I did not blink. I had my eyes on it. And it takes off at a 45-degree angle, but it is still flat. It did not tilt up to take off. It remained flat and took off at a 45-degree angle. I never heard a sound. Never felt any heat. I’ve been back to see if it burned any trees. But it didn’t. It didn’t burn anything. WHEN IT TOOK OFF AS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETWEEN 1,000 AND 5,000 FEET LONG – WE DON’T KNOW, BUT IT WAS HUGE. DID YOU SEE WITH YOUR EYES IN THAT MOMENT IT TOOK OFF NEARLY VANISHING, ANY CHANGE IN LIGHT OR HEAT? No, ma’am, it was so fast, I don’t know that a person could think that fast! It was so fast, I still couldn’t see a shape. It was like it was here and then it was gone. I didn’t see any lights. I didn’t hear any sound. I didn’t smell anything different. It took off so fast that I guarantee you if I had blinked, I would have thought it had just vanished. Other Residents See Strange Light Configurations After Dark IN YOUR AREA OF DUBLIN AND STEPHENSVILLE, TEXAS, YOURS RIGHT NOW IS THE ONLY DAYLIGHT SIGHTING, FOLLOWED BY TWO OTHER SIGHTINGS IN DAYLIGHT? As far as I know. EVERYBODY ELSE HAS BEEN SEEING A GIGANTIC OBJECT WITH MANY LIGHTS ON IT AT NIGHT? Yes, ma’am. THE PILOT OVER IN GLENROSE, TEXAS, HE DESCRIBED FOR TELEVISION A RECTANGLE PATTERN OF LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT APPEARED TO CHANGE TO TWO RECTANGLE PATTERNS OF LIGHTS. DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE THAT THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF WHAT WAS ABOVE YOU WAS NOT THE CLASSIC CIRCLE, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RECTANGLE? Ricky Sorrells Saw Huge Craft Two More Times The reason I don’t know the shape is the next sighting. Every evening before I go in the house, I chop wood. I was out there (on the porch) chopping wood and I see from my left to my right a blip, like it came in and left. And further to my right, another blip like it came in and left. And that’s all I saw. It was very huge – very long and very flat to me. I haven’t seen a side. I haven’t seen a top. Basically I’ve seen a side view (or bottom) of it each time."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AS IF IT’S ON AN ANGLE – LIKE YOU SAID THE FIRST TIME YOU WERE LOOKING UP 45 DEGREES, SO YOU WERE SEEING THE FLAT SIDE OF SOMETHING THAT DOESN’T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH DIMENSION TO IT? Correct. But I do believe it has a dimension because when I did see it the second and third time, the second time made me think it has a dimension. I only saw it for two blips, but it was like a thick piece of plate. But it was a long way away, like a 1.5 to 2 miles. WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD TIME? WAS THAT AROUND JANUARY 10? Yes, about a week and a half after my first sighting and I saw it the second time in between. THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS OUT IN THE WOODS ON YOUR PROPERTY WHERE YOU HAD GONE TO GO DEER HUNTING. THE SECOND AND THE THIRD TIMES, YOU WERE ON THE PORCH OF YOUR DUBLIN HOUSE? Yes, on the back part of it. The third time I saw it, it came from my left to my right.This is when I noticed how massive it was. It was very long. From the longest point of view, this was the widest I had seen it. It was so long, and it was at the same angle as before, so I could see only the side or bottom part. But what makes this unusual is I could see the bottom and I could see the same indentations I saw on the first time. And they are big. I could see the holes and knew what I was looking at. Other Witness Night Sightings OF Colored Lights WHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOUR FIRST SIGHTING AND YOU BEGAN TO TALK WITH OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. COULD YOU SHARE WITH US WHAT YOUR NEIGHBORS HAVE SEEN AT NIGHT. I’ve talked to one person who saw it who has been on the news. From what I gather, it has lights on it and they dance around on this object. They have no formation. They dance however they want to, different lights. I know when it starts taking off, the lights go to one intense bright light. THE COLORS BEFORE IT CHANGES TO WHITE HAVE BEEN WHAT? I believe red, blue, and yellow. SO THERE ARE RED, BLUE AND YELLOW LIGHTS THAT SEEM TO SPORADICALLY AND SPONTANEOUSLY MOVE OVER SOME KIND OF LARGE SURFACE AND THEN WHEN IT TAKES OFF, THE COLORS CHANGE TO WHITE? Ye s . DOES ANYONE HAVE A SENSE OF THE OBJECT'S SHAPE AT NIGHT? Not that I have heard. Helicopters and Jets Keep Flying Over Since UFOs Showed Up COULD YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY ACTIVITY THAT SEEMED TO SHOW UP RIGHT AFTER YOU HAD YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS WITH THAT GIGANTIC THING ABOVE YOU? Yes, I have had three small helicopters and one large helicopter at first come over. They started about Dublin and they came over to where I’m at. Then they would go about the same distance further out. I could hear them and actually see them when they were over me in Dublin. I could see them when they were the same width out and I could hear them fading. They would come back and forth and then move over to another line. They move east and west. They always seem to come from the west when they start this thing. They disappeared from over Dublin so I couldn’t see them, and then the next thing I knew, they were over my house. AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING A GRID PATTERN? Yes, as if they are running a grid pattern."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THAT THEY WERE DETECTING SOMETHING AND THEY HAVE BEEN FLYING GRID PATTERNS AS IF IN A SEARCH MODE? Ye s . HAVE YOU OR ANYBODY SEEN JETS SHOW UP CHASING AN OBJECT IN THE SKY DAY OR NIGHT? The first three guys who came out in the newspaper said they thought it was F-15s or F-16s chasing it. My experience has been that after the helicopters – and there still is one big helicopter that is two-bladed and it’s huge – still comes by once in awhile. But now, it’s mainly jets. WHAT ARE YOU LEFT THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHERE THIS MIGHT HAVE COME FROM? (sighs) I still haven’t formed a conclusion. I really don’t know. I hope it’s our military. I hope we have something that is this advanced. Is It Extraterrestrial Craft? IF IT’S NOT OURS? If it’s not ours, then we’re in trouble. I don’t know the capabilities of this thing to move at such speed that it has and as big as it is. Does it have the capability of weapons? I don’t know. But if they can build this, I’d sure hate to see if they got mad at us! You know what I’m saying? (laughter) RIGHT. AND THAT THE ‘THEY’ COULD BE EXTRATERRESTRIAL? I’m not dismissing that. I don’t know that it’s not the military. I really don’t know what it is. I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s fascinating me. Why it keeps coming over like it does, I don’t know. I would like to know that. If it was the military, I sure wish they would call me and say, ‘Hey, we’re doing this over your place. Don’t get alarmed.’ I don’t understand. I have no answers for these questions. IF IT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL, WHAT RESIDUE DOES THAT LEAVE YOU? Well, I don’t really know. I hadn’t thought about it. I know I do believe in God and I believe in Jesus Christ. I’m a Baptist. RICKY, WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR LONG-TIME FRIENDS WHO HAVE ACTUALLY THEMSELVES SEEN THE LARGE LIGHTED OBJECT AT NIGHT, HAVE YOU ANY OF YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS QUESTION – IT IS FROM OUTER SPACE. IT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS? Yes, a little bit. I think the main question that everybody would like answered is: If it is from outer space; if it is Aliens – what do they want? Why don’t they just try to make contact with us? Surely, if they are smart enough to build something like this, they are smart enough to communicate with us. Why don’t they just let us know? I think that’s the question that everybody would like answered. And if it’s not (E. T.s), - if it is the military – why are they keeping it from us? I can understand national security. But if they have this thing (huge craft), we don’t need national security. That IS our national security! Why don’t they just let it out and say, ‘Hey, this is us. This is what we have. Basically, if you don’t leave us alone, this is what you are going to get. So, I really don’t know what it is or which way to think about it. All this has happened very quickly in my life and trying to keep my regular life different from this has been something! Why Government Policy of Denial and Secrecy About UFOs?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"RICKY, WOULD YOU SAY IT IS FAIR FOR EVERY AMERICAN AND FOR EVERY CITIZEN ON THE EARTH TO REASONABLY EXPECT THAT THEIR GOVERNMENTS WOULD TELL THEM IF WE HAVE INTELLIGENCES FROM OUTER SPACE THAT CAN MAKE SOMETHING A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE AND THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT. AND THEY SEND OUT HELICOPTERS AND JETS, BUT THEY TELL US THERE IS NOTHING THERE. ULTIMATELY, ISN’T THAT HUGELY UNFAIR TO THE TAX PAYING PUBLIC? Maybe if we knew what the government knows, I could answer that question better. I can understand maybe – if they do know something – if the government came out and said, ‘Hey, OK, this is alien craft. It is a mile by half-mile. We don’t know why they are here and we’re trying to figure it out. You know, I think it would be panic everywhere! I could certainly see that. If they do know, I can understand why they wouldn’t want to tell us because of that. BUT RICKY, YOU WERE RIGHT UNDER ONE OF THESE THINGS AND IT DIDN’T DO ANYTHING TO YOU. AND IT HASN’T DONE ANYTHING TO ANY OF THOSE NIGHT TIME EYEWITNESSES. SO, WHATEVER IT IS – IF IT IS FROM OUTER SPACE, ISN’T IT DEMONSTRATING THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY INTENTION OF HURTING PEOPLE? So far, yes, ma’am. It’s a lot to think about. It’s not a joke.
