October 1, 2000 Yukon Territory, Canada - While unusual environmental conditions are being monitored and discussed around the planet, another unusual presence in the environment is also being noticed but discussed largely in private. The politically unspeakable are unidentified aerial craft in earth skies, even when there are multiple eyewitnesses. One example of such an incident has been investigated over the past year by Martin Jasek of the UFO British Columbia group who lives in White Horse of the Yukon Territory in Canada. There are only 30,000 residents in the entire Yukon and at least thirty-one eyewitnesses near Pelling Crossing saw an aerial craft estimated to have been nearly a mile long hovering silently about 300 feet above the ground.

The incident occurred on December 11, 1996, but it was not until this year that a summary report with eyewitness drawings was assembled by Yukon investigator Martin Jasek for UFOBC. This weekend I talked with Martin and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"one of the eyewitnesses, Don Trudeau, who is Assistant Director for a First Nation Native American Band in Pelling Crossing. Interview: Don Trudeau, Assistant Director of the South Government Department for the First National Native American Band, Pelling Crossing, Yukon Territory, Canada: \"I was out on my trap line when this happened. I was all by myself and it was probably around 8:30 or quarter to 9 at night. As I was walking along my trap line, I came into a very small clearing in the bush and I was coming downhill when I came to this clearing and off to my right, I saw a light. I thought to myself, 'Oh, a 747 or a big plane is coming down.' But then, when I continued to look at it, it was moving very, very slowly and I realized that it wasn't an airplane and I had myself an encounter with a UFO. So, I turned to my right where the object was and as I turned, the flashlight that I had slung from my waist pointed in that direction. At the first sighting of the UFO, it was probably three-quarters to a mile off. When I turned and the flashlight pointing in that direction, then the object moved towards me very rapidly. It stopped probably about 300 yards in front of me after I put my hand over my flashlight. Right out of the center of it, a beam came down at 45 degrees pointing forward in the direction it was moving. Then it did a sweep to about 45 degrees back. Then it went out. Also, too, out of the front of the object was some kind of green light and I could see it very clearly because of the ice crystals in the air. And out of the back of the object was two white lights that were shining down in behind the object and then they slowly rotated up until they were completely level with the object. It was moving I would say between 5 and 10 mph and it was moving slowly to my right. And on the object itself, there was a long line of lights. They were square. They weren't round. They were rectangular. They were about 9 feet high and probably about 20 feet long.

COULD YOU MAKE SOME COMMENTS NOW SO THAT AN AUDIENCE COULD GET SOME SENSE OF THE SIZE OF THIS IN RELATIONSHIP TO YOU AND THE ENVIRONMENT? Yes, I would estimate it was about 3/4's of a mile long. It could have been longer. But where I was standing when it was close to me, I could not look at the whole thing. I had to turn my head from side to side. THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE LONG AND ABOUT HOW CLOSE TO THE TREETOPS OR THE ROAD OR TO YOU WAS IT HANGING? It was probably hovering about 250 feet or 300 feet up and because I was on a hillside, I was almost looking straight level with it, maybe had my gaze up just a tiny little bit. And there was no noise, no humming, nothing coming out of this machine."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IT'S SUCH AN ENORMOUS THING TO BE SO LOW AND FOR THERE NOT TO BE ANY SOUND. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THAT FACT THAT IT WAS SILENT? At first, I guess you could say I was standing there with my mouth open just looking at it. But at no time did I have any fear of this. At no time was I other than awe of something so huge.\" Martin Jasek is a civil engineer with a masters degree in Water Resources. When he started his investigation for UFO British Columbia a year ago, he had no idea there wee so many eyewitnesses who had watched the giant aerial craft for several minutes. Martin Jasek, Civil Engineer and UFOBC Investigator, White Horse, Yukon Territory, Canada: \"I couldn't believe it as it was unraveling. You start with one phone call and it kept getting more and more detailed. Every person I talked to was really down to earth and not looking for attention. I had to convince some of them to talk about what they had seen. Two cousins were driving in two different vehicles about a mile apart from each other. It was about 8:30 in the evening and they were going along a highway that is adjacent to a lake. The lake is on the left hand side and there is this huge UFO that comes over from the other side. They slam on the brakes and skate to a stop. The first fellow in front gets out of the vehicle and he's watching the thing move slowly towards his side of the lake. Now, his cousin is about a quarter of a mile back from him and he doesn't want to go further because if he goes to where his cousin is he'll be right in the path of this UFO, so he stops further back. He watches this huge UFO go over his cousin and off over the right and the hills. A drawing based on that report is included in our report.

It would have been about 8 miles from where Don was and they were looking north and they saw this huge row of lights traveling over the hills on the other side of the village. It was just enormous in size and pulled over. The woman was very smart in that she compared the size or length of the lights to the Big Dipper which happened to be right above it. And it was the same length as the Big Dipper. And the Big Dipper takes up 25 degrees of the sky. Then there were also four women taking an evening course at a college and they were out on a break and they watched lights coming from the west and going north in Don Trudeau's direction. They did drawings as well. Then there was a fellow I just learned about recently. He was walking over the bridge and coming back from hockey game practice and he saw this huge row of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"lights approaching him and got scared and laid down on the deck of the bridge face down. And then at one point he looked up and right above him and it was there and looked back down until it was gone. HE ACTUALLY LAID DOWN? Yes. That's what his grandmother told me. He was 13 years old, pretty shaken up. I haven't talked to him. All these people saw the same thing over the same spot. we were able to calculate the size from the triangulation and we had a good angle this time because it was compared to the big dipper. THAT ESTIMATE TURNED OUT TO BE HOW BIG? Between 1 and 2 kilometers, about a mile. A MILE IN DIAMETER. IT'S HARD REALLY FOR US HUMANS USE TO SEEING CRAFT IN THE SKY THAT ARE ONLY 200 OR 300 FEET LONG IN AIRLINERS THAT ANYTHING COULD BE A MILE LONG SITTING 250 FEET UP ABOVE TREES AND COMPL ETELY SILENT. Yeah, I agree with you. Just stand next to a football stadium and picture something 5 times the size. FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL STADIUM HOVERING IN THE AIR 250 FEET. Ye a h . WHAT IS IT? AND HOW CAN IT DO THAT COMPLETELY SILENTLY? Exactly. The only one who could see the actual surface texture of it were the two cousins at Fox Lake and I think that was the one area where the UFO was really close to the ground that enough light was reflecting off the snow to illuminate itself. DID THEY GIVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE SURFACE LOOKED LIKE BETWEEN THE LIGHTS? They just said smooth, grey, metallic. ANY CONTACT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT? No, no one that we know of called the police.\" More Information: Martin Jasek's summary of where eyewitnesses lived: \"Fox Lake had 6 witnesses.The Village of Carmacks had 9 eyewitnesses. Then north of Carmacks was the Village of Pelly Crossing where Don Trudeau lives and there was a total of 8 witnesses there. Then there is the Village of Mayo further north and there was another 8 witnesses at that location. All the same evening, covering an area roughly 250 miles.\" Copies of Martin Jasek's UFOBC report, \"Giant UFO in the Yukon Territory\" is available from: UFOBC"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"11151 Kendale Way Delta, B.
