July 15, 2009 Silbury Hill, Wiltshire County, England - On the night of July 4 to 5, 2009, a crew of documentary filmmakers with high definition video cameras were camped on top of Silbury Hill from about 2 AM until sunup between 4 and 4:30 AM in the British higher latitude summer light. Atop Silbury Hill, the film crew was only a quarter-mile from the location of what many experienced crop formation investigators say is as spectacular a wheat formation as there has ever been. The pattern spans 350 feet in diameter with unusual shading and \"immaculate\" ground lay. That date of July 5 was only two days before the July 7 date that an Australian scientist and American physicist Mike Reed had discussed since mid-April as being a date repeated over and over in the spring oilseed rape formations. Their speculation was the formation themes were the sun and a solar event on July 7, the same date as a penumbral lunar eclipse.

It's definitely a genuine enigma.” Charles R. Mallett, Crop Circle Researcher and Manager, Silent Circle Information Centre, Calne, Wiltshire, England: “ That formation (Silbury headdress) was absolutely genuine. There is no question about that. It was pretty amazing! They arrived around 2 AM and didn’t see anything strange or lights, but they saw the big formation when the sun came up, which was between 4 to 4:30 AM in Britain in early July. The film crew went into the formation straight away. The film crew said there was heavy dew on the laid down crop, yet there were no footprints and it was not disturbed. The crew said the headdress formation was immaculate. It all looked good. They were pretty well impressed. It’s a very large event by any standards, over a diameter of approximately 350 feet. I’m used to circles and have walked in hundreds of them. But this one was, ‘How on earth could this possibly be homemade? When I was walking around in that formation it was like, ‘This is unreal!’ CHARLES, WHO IS DOING THE FILM PRODUCTION? They are independent. The guy leading up the trip is Charlie and they are decent people I’ve been working with for weeks. Charlie is British, but has been living in the States for a long time. The rest are Americans. Charlie, is very fascinated in the crop formations and is trying to make an objective film to present to the wider public. So, I’m doing consulting with them and advising about new formations as they happen. Kind of irritating when they advise me of a new formation, in a way! (laughs) IF THE FILM CREW WAS THERE FROM 2 AM ON, THAT’S 2.5 HOURS UNTIL SUN UP AND NO ONE COULD MAKE THE 350-FOOT-DIAMETER HEADDRESS IN 2.5 HOURS. Right, there’s no way anybody could look at that and say it’s not incredible! Anyone who walked in it would be very impressed at the sheer size and complexity. The level of coordination you would require to create something like that in day light on flat ground, well, I can’t equate doing it in three or four hours of darkness. And the film crew was on top of Silbury Hill. If there were any torches (flashlights) or cigarettes burning, from on top of that hill that night, the crew would definitely have caught sight of it. So, at best one can say that there were no visible light sources in that field between 2 AM and daylight at 4 AM to 4:30 AM. That formation is a pretty major enigma! I arrived there around 9:30 AM and spent some time looking at the plants and took the photos and pole shots, which have the date and time in the images so people can see when my images were shot. That’s a big, spectacular pattern and it was crowded by 10 AM on July 5. A lot of people went in there and it’s already trampled to death. But luckily, I got in there early and had a good look at it and took ground photographs before the crowds arrived.

C. Levengood hypothesizes is caused by microwave and electric energies from a spinning plasma vortex that comes down from the sky and interacts with the plants, rapidly heating the cell water so that the tissues soften and collapse into the various crop formation patterns. Charles Mallett: “By the time I got to the formation, there were large numbers of people arriving. It’s amazing how word seems to spread! There is an effort not to spread word very fast because the formations need careful consideration before the busloads arrive. Once a lot of people have been in a crop circle, there is a lot of damage. In a nutshell, this Silbury Hill headdress crop circle was deeply impressive and I don’t know anybody who could achieve that in a few hours in the dark. It’s not feasible. It’s not logical. So, one has to conclude there is something more to this. The way the crop was laid was very impressive. In the top area of the formation closest to Silbury Hill, as you can clearly see in the aerial shots, the crop is laid in a fairly interesting manner criss-crossing all over the place, creating a kind of 3-dimensional image in the laid crop from the aerial perspective."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"T he unusual “mountain shading” can be seen in this aerial photograph on the far side of the circle nearest Silbury Hill.

AND TIES DIRECTLY TO THE FIRST 2009 FORMATION AT THE RIDGEWAY ON APRIL 14, FOLLOWED BY THE MAYAN SUN GLYPH THE NEXT DAY, FOLLOWED BY THE SUNBURST AND THEN MORGAN’S HILL THAT WAS COUNTING LUNAR CYCLES DOWN TO JULY 7. AND HERE COMES THIS AMAZING HEADDRESS ON JULY 5, THAT YOU COULD SAY MIGHT BE LINKED DIRECTLY TO THE MAYAN WORLD AND ITS OBSESSION WITH THE SUN, MOON, STARS AND QUETZALCOATL, THE FEATHERED SERPENT - POSSIBLY EXTRATERRESTRIALS THAT COHABITED WITH THE MAYANS AND AZTECS FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND THEN LEFT FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. Crazy! What do the scientists say? Comparisons of Silbury Headdress to Quetzalcoatl Feathered Headdresses The Australian scientist who has contributed valuable solar analysis from 2009 English crop formations also collaborated with Marina Sassi, Italian artist and CMM Researcher, to search for Mayan and Aztec stone depictions of Quetzalcoatl, a serpent-headed entity whose head is surrounded by feathers."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A re the unusual “mountain shadings” at the top meant to depict the undulations of a serpent's body? Or a landscape? Or? Both graphic illustrations produced by Marina Sassi, CMM Research, Italy. The proliferation of crop circles this summer has been really unusual. I would stress that this is very unusual. There is something else going on here.” C ontinued in Part 2: Tall, Mysterious Blonds Near Silbury Hill F or further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archived reports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in the Earthfiles Shop. • 04/30/2009 — Part 1: First 2009 U.
