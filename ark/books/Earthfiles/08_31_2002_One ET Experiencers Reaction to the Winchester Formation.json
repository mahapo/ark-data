With a Polaroid camera, he snapped the remaining four frames he had left in his camera. Riley says that \"magnetism is a factor in the positioning of the spacecraft.\" Polaroid photograph © 1987 by Riley L. Martin. August 31, 2002 Washington, New Jersey - Earlier this summer, I met a New Jersey man named Riley Martin who in 1995 wrote a book entitled, The Coming of Tan. Tan is the name of a non-human being from what Riley understands to be a planet called \"Biaveh\" 450 light years from earth in the Taurus constellation that also contains the Pleiades. Taurus (The Bull) is northwest of the Orion constellation. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The star, Aldebaran which glows red in the night sky about 65 light years from earth, represents the eye of the bull. Above Aldebaran are the Pleiades (Messier 45) which are 425 light years away. Riley Martin says the \"Biaviian extraterrestrials\" he has encountered claim to come from a star in the Taurus constellation that is 450 light years from earth. Graphic from www.crystalinks.com. Ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses wore Taurus horns with solar disc. Graphic from www.crystalinks.com. Riley, who is now 56-years-old, says he was taken physically for examination aboard an extraterrestrial craft at age seven by the Biaviian named Tan. In 1987, the Biaviians appeared in the sky while he was driving and he stopped to take Polaroid photographs of their disc-shaped craft. Over time and in several physical meetings, Riley says he has been educated about a variety of non-human beings interacting with earth, including a group of reptilian humanoids that the Biaviians do not like. Riley calls the reptilians Targzissians, or \"Targs.\" Riley thinks the Biaviians and the Targs have both manipulated genetic evolution on this planet and that one of the Targ's creations is a hybrid \"Grey\" species with large dark eyes that are part Targ and part human to do work on this planet. Reptilian entity that Riley Martin says the non-human species he is in contact with (Biaviians) call a \"Targzissian,\" or \"Targ\" which the Biaviians have fought with in the past and do not trust. Drawn by Riley and captioned as a \"Targzissian pilot\" in Riley's book, The Coming of Tan © 1995. Ten years ago, the Biaviian named Tan telepathically gave Riley a poem in which he said, \"Unto you my sign is written there upon the living fields. Lo' the circle is eternal, though you perish, you yet shall live.\" Riley did not know about crop formations then, but today thinks that is what the entity was referring to. I asked Riley this weekend to briefly explain how he came to meet the non-humans and what his reaction is to the current Winchester alien face with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"large eyes and binary code disc that warns about false gifts and deception.

Born in Arkansas in 1946. Photograph provided by Riley Martin. Riley L. Martin, Author, The Coming of Tan © 1995, married and residing in Washington, New Jersey: \"In 1953 at the age of seven in northeastern Arkansas, I saw these lights above the river three nights in a row. Late at night, I could not awaken my brothers who slept in the same room with me, nor my parents on the third night. I went out to the river, came through a cane break. The ship was there, moored by three flexible legs. It was a saucer shape, the classical saucer. Two beings came out of the ship, struck me with a light first of all that immobilized me. They came out and got me by the arm, took me back and talked very gentle to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"me. After an examination, I began to communicate with them telepathically. They came and picked me up no matter where I was about every eleven years since that time. Now, they did not uplink my memory for 35 years. Only after the December 27, 1987 sighting and the Polaroid shots (top of this report and at website below), did I begin to remember under hypnosis and all of the data came back to me as they wished it to be. Why they waited that long? I cannot say. Perhaps they thought I was ready and would not corrupt this information or what have you. I am not the only person who has given information down through the years. PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL CROP FORMATIONS ON RECORD IS THE AUGUST 15, 2002 ALIEN FACE WITH CIRCULAR BINARY CODE IN THE WHEAT FIELD NEAR WINCHESTER, ENGLAND. I'M CURIOUS, RILEY, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION UPON SEEING THIS? Frankly, Linda, I was more impressed with the Face that had been done in the fields a year, or several years back. ONE YEAR AGO AT THE CHILBOLTON RADIO OBSERVATORY. Yes, I was more impressed with that one. I do know that the alien, Tan, whom I know, one of the Biaviians, in his poem he wrote in the book about seeing his signs written upon the living fields. This was like a decade ago. I did not know at the time what he was talking about, but now I understand that numerous of these symbols are not man-made. This is a fact. I believe this is because the extraterrestrials want us to know without any reasonable doubt that we are not alone in the universe. \"Tan,\" the Biaviian, drawn by Riley L. Martin for his book, The Coming of Tan © 1995. Riley says, \"The impression that one gets from the Biaviians ranges from the comical (in appearance) to the lovable. However, when you learn the potential magnitude of their power coupled with the deductive scope of their reasoning, you are given cause, on occasion, for apprehension.\" IF IT WERE MADE BY SOMETHING NON-HUMAN, AND NOT HUMAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NON-HUMANS WOULD BE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH WITH THIS PARTICULAR ALIEN FACE AND THE ROUND BINARY CODE IN THE WHEAT FIELD? OK, let me try to hook it together for you. I have learned that the \"Greys\" are a hybrid created species engineered by the reptilians. The Greys have been interacting with man a great deal. They have also been involved in collecting a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"certain organic materials from say cattle mutilations and things of this nature to give to the Targs and their females in estrus and things like this. So, would it be far fetched to believe that the Biaviians are showing us the deceivers of what we will be faced with at some point in the not too distant future, should they (hybrids) come to us? Then maybe the Biaviians are warning us, 'Hey, these are hybrids made by the Targs. Don't believe what they say because, you understand, they are going to use you,' or something of this nature. SO YOU WOULD BE SAYING THAT PERHAPS THE FACE THAT WAS PUT IN THE FIELD IS BY WHOMEVER IT IS WARNING US ABOUT THAT FACE, NOT THAT THAT FACE IS THE DELIVERER OF THE CROP FORMATIONS? Right. Right. If I were going to conjecture an opinion, that would be it because they also, the Biaviians warned me back in 1988 to not have neurological interactions with the Targzissians, the reptilians, that have been trying to reach me. So, maybe they are warning the world and saying, 'Look, these guys are bad news,' or something. AND THAT THE TARGZISSIANS THAT ARE THE REPTILIANS FROM YOUR CONTEXT OF EXPERIENCE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE CREATED THE GREY HYBRIDS THAT ARE REFERRED TO IN ABDUCTIONS AS HAVING THE LARGE DARK EYES? Yeah, I think. I feel, my information given me that feels now somewhat certain that they are more or less worker drones for the Targzissians and the Targzissians did create them. However, somewhere infused in there somewhere are some human genetics. I also believe the Targs created genetically these entities you might call the Men in Black, or whatever have you, back over the years. They are getting good at it. SO, THIS FACE IN THE FIELD IN WINCHESTER, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, COULD BE ONE OF THE HYBRIDS MADE BY THE REPTILIAN SPECIES THAT WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF REPTILIAN AND HUMAN GENES? Yes. Yes. Thereabouts. Maybe they incorporated some other alien factors, too. But, essentially that is what I'm saying in that they (Grey hybrids) are able to breathe in this atmosphere and things like that. AND THIS WARNING COULD BE A WARNING BY ANOTHER SPECIES ABOUT THOSE HYBRIDS THAT LOOK LIKE THE FACE IN THE FIELD? Yes. Yes. Now, this is what I'm conjecturing, Linda. You must take it with a grain of salt. But this is my take on it, so to speak. AND OTHERS MIGHT SAY THAT THE FACE IN THE FIELD IS REFLECTING WHO MADE THE FORMATION WITH THE BINARY CODE WARNING ABOUT YET ANOTHER SPECIES? Yes. Nonetheless, I believe it is my first assessment of it instead of that one. If you are going to warn me about somebody, give me what they look like. You understand? Don't give me you and then tell me, 'Hey, the deceivers are coming.' You see what I mean? SO, BOTTOM LINE, YOU WOULD INTERPRET IT AS THAT THE FACE IN THE FIELD IS WHAT IS BEING WARNED ABOUT IN THE BINARY CODE? Right, because they are breaking the rules. It is permissible, historically, the Targzissans took from wild herds. These days it's easier to take from contained herds the organic material they use: sexual organs and other (such as) blood, hemoglobin and stuff like this. WHICH IS THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS? Right, animal mutilations and all this. Then leaving the animal there for the owner to find it is a no-no. The Targs are breaking rules. Perhaps they are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"coming to a point now where knowing that the earth is going down the drain, or what have you, that they are taking liberties beyond what they should. And maybe the Biaviians decided to lay this down so that one of us would figure it out and pass the information along. So, if a Grey (entity) lands in your yard and comes up to you and grabs you by the arm, then hit him in the mouth, OK! IF YOU WERE CORRECT IN YOUR SPECULATION THAT THE GREY ALIEN FACE IN THE WINCHESTER FIELD IS WHAT THE BINARY CODE IS WARNING ABOUT, THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK LAST YEAR AT THE CHILBOLTON RADIO OBSERVATORY WAS THE PURPOSE OF THAT MORE HUMANOID FACE AND THE OTHER BINARY CODE? I believe it was saying, 'Humans, you are human. We are we. We know you are there. We want you to know that we are here. We did the same thing on Mars in stone. We're doing the same thing in the fields to tie these various things together. You already have the information. You already have the logic. You already have all the circumstantial stuff you need to now figure out that you're not alone in the universe. And what have you. I think it was something like that, so to speak, that you could only see from the sky. I believe that they are trying to make their presence known to us without actually landing and altering our contiinuum which is not allowed simply because they belive, according to this alien, Tan, that we do not have a lot of time left upon the earth before we will experience a number of transitions of great cataclysms upon this planet, and what have you. WHAT ARE THE CATACLYSMS THEY HAVE SHOWN YOU? WHAT WILL HAPPEN? They base their future predictions upon present day data. They know we have dropped so many billions of pounds of carcinogens into the waters and into the atmosphere yearly. They know the rain forest is being depleted and it's 45% at least of our oxygen on the planet. They know the water table is being poisoned. Over-population. New viral infections with which we cannot deal. Wars and rumors of wars. Nuclear waste. All of this is adding up. If it continues, over-population, if it continues at the rate it is going, all of this will come to an end around late 2011 or early 2012. And there will come about great transitions. Add to this the offsetting of the weather patterns through these various hot house gases and things we are putting up here. Then you have a real smorgasbord for disaster. This won't be the first time this has happened in the history of the world. It doesn't mean that I think everybody is going to fall dead in 2011 or 2012. But that we will go through a transition such as we have gone through ice ages, such as we went through the shifting of the continents, such as we went through the reversal of the magnetic poles of the planet. DO YOU THINK THE NON-HUMANS ARE GOING TO CAUSE THIS TRANSITION, OR IS IT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS COSMIC AND NATURAL? We are the ones, humans are causing this thing. However, they do feel some responsibility because they have had some genetic interaction with us since pre-Biblical times. Nonetheless, we are the ones, just like a bird poisoning its own next, we are the ones who will ultimately destroy ourselves out of greed and apathy, out of raping the planet of its resources and not trying to go to alternative sources of energy. This is what they are telling us. Life is not guaranteed to us, Linda, though we are tenacious and very brilliant creatures. For every one living species walking the earth now, perhaps a thousand have come and gone. And many were tenacious survivors, but they didn't make it though because of certain great transitions on the earth. This one, this transition, is made by living beings instead of being only a natural catastrophic thing. MEANING HUMANS HAVE BROUGHT THIS ON THEMSELVES? Yes, indeed. And knowingly so. They're here checking us out. It's not often you"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"get a chance to see a bunch of damn fools that are cognizant destroy an entire planet! But, if we have the power to destroy it, then we have the power not to destroy it. It's like this: if you're making $200 million this year. Settle for $180 and use $20 million of it to clean my river. Or to put scrubbers in your factories. Or go to alternate sources of energy. Let's stop destroying the earth. Let's use our ingenuity or creativity our concepts to go to alternative sources of energy. Let us become more realistic in the way we look at things. They are letting us know as best they can without actually coming in and taking over the place. They are here, and there is a universal community.\" More Information: To purchase The Coming of Tan , click on the website http://www.thecomingoftan.com Or contact: Historicity Productions 91 River Road Stockton, New Jersey 08559 Tel: 609-397-8446 e-mail: curtis@tradenet.net We b s it e : http://www.thecomingoftan.com http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/taurus/constell.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
