Twenty-seven years ago in 1975-1976, one center of animal mutilation activity was around Great Falls, Malmstrom AFB and the Minuteman missile sites in Cascade County.

Photographs © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office, Conrad, Montana. File Case of August 31, 2001, Mutilated Cow North of Conrad, Owner Gerald Miller: \"The Miller cow was missing some jaw hide and the hide from the top of its head along with an ear. The back end had been cut off. And it was just severely dehydrated like it had been there for years. Hide was hard like a rock.\" File Case of September 24, 2001, Mutilated Cow West of Conrad, Owner Jim Vandenbos Stripped right jaw, removed tongue and \"burned\" neck on the Jim Vandenbos cow discovered west of Conrad, Montana on September 24, 2001. Photographs © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. \"Then we had Jim Vandenbos's cow. And this one it looked like the hide had been burned pretty severely on it. The cow was laying in a little grassy area that was like too rocky to plow around out in a grain field. But it was laying on the only grass. The hair was all gone on quite a bit of the carcass. The face was skinned out. Same as the others as far as how much was cut on."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Close-up stripped jaw and \"burned\" neck hide of Vandenbos cow. When you say it was burned, what do you mean? Well, it just looks like the hide, all the hair has been burned off or scraped off. It gives the appearance from the jaw, the hide is gone from the face and then you get to the neck and brisket, there's no hair on it. I mean, it's down to the bare hide itself. The skin looked burned? Yeah, it looks barbecued, like it caught on fire. There have been instances like that going back to the 1970s as well. In the work that I put together in An Alien Harvest especially, there were images in Colorado sheriff's offices where animals looked like there had been burning of the hair and hide. I remember one case right at the end of its tail bone where the hair and hide were fried crisp. Mysteriously burned tail of cow on the Dave Amen ranch in Sterling, Colorado discovered on September 24, 1976. Polaroid photograph by Tex Graves, Sheriff, Logan County Sheriff's Office. That's the appearance this takes. And this one had some real strange marks on the jaw. I don't know if you would call them saw marks, but that was sent on down to Las Vegas for them to take a look at. What was their analysis? They haven't gotten to it yet. In terms of the jaw having those apparent saw marks, have you found that on any of the other Montana mutilations in 2001? No, that was kind of strange. I guess maybe it was something we didn't notice before. We learn a little more it seems on every one of these. The Vandenbos is the one out of the eleven mutilations of 2001 in which you have both evidence of burning hair to the hide and the saw marks on the jawbone? Yes. And excisions of hide from the belly and one of the teats was cut into.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Vandenbos cow in pasture where it was found. One of teats was cut and patches of hide were removed from the belly. File Case of October 21, 2001, Two Mutilated Cows, Between Dupuyer and Conrad, Two mutilated cows were found thirty yards apart on October 21, 2001 on the New Miami Hutterite Colony ranch between Dupuyer and Conrad, Montana.

Both had tongues removed from deep within the throat, but the cow on the left had its ears; the cow on the right did not have its right ear or eye. \"There were two mutilations within thirty yards on the same trail. SAME DAY AND THEY WERE BOTH FEMALE? Yes, both about four to five year old cows. One had the right jaw removed. The other had the left jaw removed. One had part of the uterus, the udder, taken. The other wasn't touched. The only thing different about these is that we did"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"have some small animal predators eating on these (afterward). Photo on top: cow with left jaw stripped had oval patches of hide removed from its belly, all four teats were excised and rectum and vagina cored out. Photo on bottom: cow with right jaw stripped, teats were intact, but rectum and vagina also cored out. WHEN YOU GOT TO THE SITE? Yes, they weren't there when discovered, but later there were tracks of a small 3-toed animal like a skunk, raccoon or something. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK BOTH OF THESE HAD BEEN DEAD BY THE TIME YOU GOT THERE? Oh, between four days and a week. WHAT ABOUT THE EARS? The ears weren't gone on the cow with the left jaw stripped, but were gone on the other one. THE TONGUES? The tongues were gone, all stripped plum out of the bottom. FROM DEEP IN THE THROAT? Right. And the next thing taken on the one with the left jaw stripped was that all four teats were missing. THE TEATS WERE MISSING, BUT THE UDDER WAS THERE? The udder was still there, but the teats were gone. Also, the whole back end was cut out of that one and she was chewed on pretty good from the back, but you can tell she was cored out first. IF YOU GO TO THE ANIMAL THAT HAD THE JAW STRIPPED ON THE RIGHT SIDE, STARTING AGAIN WITH THE EARS AND WORKING DOWN, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT ONE? The whole side of the face: eye, ear, lips, nose, jaw, all the way back. AS YOU WORK YOUR WAY DOWN THE BODY? This one, the udder was intact, but the back end had been cut out. THE UDDER WAS THERE WITH THE FOUR TEATS, BUT WHEN YOU GOT TO THE RECTAL AND VAGINAL AREA, WAS THE RECTUM ONLY CORED OUT, OR RECTUM AND VAGINA? Rectum and vagina on this one, I believe. WAS IT A LARGE HOLE? Pretty good sized, yes. It was cut all the way up around the tail end."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Photograph of excised rectal and vaginal tissue after New Miami Hutterite Colony cow was turned over, Photograph © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. WERE THERE ANY SUSPICIOUS TRACKS OF ANY KIND AROUND THESE ANIMALS? On this one, there was 250 other head of cattle in there. But we did notice - whether it was two other cows sparring which they will do as they'll go head to head and turn this way - but these were also located in the grass off of a plowed field. And what we found on that was that there was skid mark tracks and we don't know if those skid marks are from somebody dragging that cow, or she was on the fight, or what the deal was.These are skid marks are from the cow's hooves. Like it was roped. Have you ever seen a guy roping a cow from a horse? And they will spin around sideways. Well, that's kind of the figure this one took. Sort of like he was maybe roped around the neck and spun sideways. IT WAS ONLY THE ONE THAT HAD THE FLESH TAKEN FROM THE RIGHT SIDE THAT HAD THE SKID MARKS WHERE THE HOOVES WERE? Well, the skid marks were probably ten yards away from her in the plowed field off into the little bank going into a little grassy place there. BUT SHE WASN'T EVEN LAYING IN THE SKID MARKS. IT'S AS IF SHE CAME DOWN IN A SPOT THAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE SKID MARKS? Right. THIS IS THE QUESTION ABOUT THESE ANIMALS BEING RAISED OUT OF PASTURES AND BEING RETURNED. Ye s . IN ALL THESE CASES, ARE YOU TAKING TISSUE AND SENDING TO NIDS IN LAS VEGAS? If they are not badly decomposed. They are telling us if it is over 48 hours, don't send it. Most everything we had this summer was over 48 hours. We did send the jaw bone in on the Vandenbos cow. We sent, we took the funny looking cut off the King cow and sent that down. THAT'S THE SERRATED CUT? (See Earthfiles Part 1, Jan. 11, 2002) Yes. We cut that out and sent that down (to NIDS in Las Vegas). \" File Case of October 28, 2001, Mutilated cow northwest of Conrad, Owner Robert Lettenga."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Mutilated cow on the Robert Lettenga ranch northwest of Conrad, Montana discovered October 28, 2001.

The ear was there. EYES? The eye was there. BUT THE TONGUE WAS REMOVED? The tongue is gone, yes. THE JAW, WHICH SIDE WAS IT STRIPPED? The left jaw.

On this one, there were abrasions or excisions of hide right about the naval area. Similar excisions of round or oval pieces of hide along the center of bellies has been documented in hundreds of cattle mutilations since at least the 1960s. Photographs © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. Left front teat cut into, but remaining teats and udder untouched. RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BELLY? Right and the bag was intact on this, but on the left front teat there was an abrasion. IT HAD BEEN CUT PARTIALLY? I would say it was looked at. It was probably cut two inches on the teat. I don't know how other to explain it other than that. There were sites on this one like injection sites with stuff bubbling back out. LIKE HOLES IN THE HIDE? I would say so. White foamy bubbles exuding from unexplained holes in Lettenga mutilated cow's hide. WHAT ABOUT THE RECTAL VAGINAL AREA? She was cored plum out. AND TAIL? Tail was there.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"More Information: See the books An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop for hundreds of color images and medical, law enforcement and other documents about the worldwide animal mutilation mystery.
