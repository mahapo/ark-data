Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Colorado State Patrol Officer Encountered UFO and “Human” Stranger © 2008 Linda Moulton Howe “ M y gut feeling says I spent twenty minutes talking to somebody who was not from this world.” - J on M. Spaulding, Retired Police Detective November 21, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - As a professional journalist, I know that the men and women who work in police departments and sheriff’s offices are often exposed to many high strangeness events that are never reported to the public. I know firsthand from those in law enforcement who told me they had come to the conclusion in the 1970s that the perpetrators of worldwide animal mutilations are “creatures from outer space,” but most of them would not speak on the record in front of a TV camera. So, when I receive a letter or email from a retired law enforcement professional who says he is still haunted by an encounter with a large unidentified aerial craft that occurred in 1992, I try to follow up. That’s what happened this fall with Jon M. Spaulding, who has given me permission to use his full real name. He was born in 1945 and is now retired at age 63 with a serious breathing disability that might be linked to his UFO encounter in 1992. He worked in law enforcement in Rumford, Maine, and in the Colorado Springs, Colorado, region from 1982 until 2001. He was chief investigator in a detectives team when he retired because of his physical disability. In the late fall of 1992, he was working for the state police based in Colorado Springs, but to make ends meet for his family, he held another job in restaurant management at night. His strange story begins as he got into his car around 5 PM to go to the restaurant. It was nearly winter season and the sun had set, but the sky was still grey. Interview: Jon M. Spaulding, retired police detective in law enforcement career from 1982 to 2001: “At that time in fall 1992, I had two jobs. I was a state police officer for Colorado during the day and at night, I was manager of an up scale restaurant and lounge in Colorado Springs. My normal restaurant work hours were from 6 PM to 3 AM. I was on my way to work. I left a little early that night because I wanted to eat dinner there before I went on shift. So, I backed out of my driveway in Colorado Springs. My house sat across the street from one of the city golf courses there. I backed out of my driveway onto my street and go east half a block to a T-intersection and stop sign there. Across the street from that stop sign is the golf course at the 9th fairway. When I got to that stop sign, I turned right and when you turn right and look down that 9th fairway you can see the tee-box where people tee off in golf. You always had to look down there because if you turn at the wrong time and someone hit a golf ball (laughs), it might come through your windshield. There was no one at the tee-box or out on the course. As I make my right turn, I looked up and noticed above the top of the trees and probably a thousand yards away were what appeared to be landing lights of a large aircraft. Colorado Springs is heavily military. You have Fort Carson on one end. You have Ent Air Base or Pete Field out on the far east side. Up north, you have the USAF Academy. There’s a lot of military around there, but flight patterns were not over our area (of house). So this was not a normal flight pattern for any plane to be. I looked at what I thought was a plane and it was only a couple hundred yards off the ground. I’m thinking, ‘My God, this guy is going to crash and he’s going to hit me. I can’t get out of the way.’ I kind of froze, to tell you the truth. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The longer I looked at him, the more I realized it was not moving very fast. He was moving extremely slow. I couldn’t figure out what it was. I backed the car up, parked and got out. I walked across the street where there is a 6-foot-high chain link fence that separates the public from the golf course there. I leaned against that fence and watched whatever it was – these two lights – and they seemed to be about 50 to 60 feet apart from one another. The lights came over the top of a stand of trees that are on the opposite side of fairway # 9. The object came over the top of those trees and stopped right there. Then it lowered itself to probably 50 or 60 feet off the ground at the most. The lights were there, but I couldn’t see any craft. I couldn’t see whatever this was. I could see the trees through it. I could see the sky through it. But I couldn’t see what the object was. WHEN YOU SAY YOU COULD SEE THE SKY AND TREES THROUGH IT, YOU MEAN THROUGH THE LIGHT? Try to picture this. If you had a light in your left hand and a light in your right hand and extended both hands straight out, that space in between the lights you could see through. WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT YOU’VE GOT TWO LIGHTS COMING SLOWLY AT YOU THAT YOU FIRST THOUGHT WERE HEADLIGHTS OF AN AIRPLANE, BUT YOU CAN SEE TREES AND SKY CLEARLY BETWEEN THE TWO LIGHTS. Correct. SO THAT SUGGESTS IT WAS TWO LIGHTS PERHAPS FLYING IN FORMATION AS OPPOSED TO ONE, BIG STRUCTURED CRAFT? That’s what it first suggested to me. And the more I looked at that thing – it was just sitting there in mid-air 50 or 60 feet off the ground. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever. No wind, which is unusual for Colorado. No sound. There were no golfers or others on the course that could be seen. In our neighborhood, we had lots and lots of kids, lots and lots of young adults with animals. Everyone was always out walking their dogs; the kids were playing in the yards. There was no one and there was no sound! It was very unusual. I looked around to find someone I could ask, ‘Hey, are you seeing what I’m seeing?’ But there was no one around anywhere. I thought I would run into the house and get my camera, but then I thought the thing would be gone by the time I got back. “Invisible” Cigar-Shaped Craft So, I stood there and looked at it - and then I saw it! Have you ever seen the movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger called Predator? It took place in a jungle and they had this alien enemy up in the trees and they could not see it until it moved because you could see right through it. Once it started to move, you could see the outline of it. But you really had to be looking hard. That’s exactly what happened with this UFO thing. [ Editor’s Note: Predator is a 1987 science fiction feature film directed by John McTiernan, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. The story follows an elite team on a mission to rescue hostages from a guerrilla group in Central America. Unknowingly, the group is hunted by an extraterrestrial life form.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"T he predator extraterrestrial in the Schwarzenegger movie was nearly see-through-invisible when not moving. Predator image source Wikipedia. The thing with the lights started to move to my right, which would have been going south. It did not turn. The lights were still in the same pl ace. It just moved slightly to the south and when it did that, I could see the outline of it – a long cigar shape. Then a red light came on and then a blue light came on between the two white lights. [ See Editor's Note below sketch about difference between interview description and Jon's illustration.] And I’m thinking, ‘That’s not a helicopter. I know it’s not a 747 jetliner. There was absolutely no sound whatsoever! No breeze, no wind, no nothing. G reen x marks Jon Spaulding's Colorado Springs, Colorado, home location in late fall 1992. The red rectangle marks where he parked his car and got out to watch first the tw o white lights. He could see trees and sky between the white lights. Then suddenly a red light came on and then a blue light as the object hovered silently over the grove of trees on the Paddy Jewett Golf Course. Sketch © 2008 by Jon Spaulding for Earthfiles. [ Editor's Note: During our interview, Jon described seeing the red and blue lights pop on between the two white lights. But when he began making a sketch for me, he threw away his first one that had the red and blue lights between the white lights and placed the red and blue lights on the outside of the white lights as shown in the above drawing. I called Jon for clarity and he said, “I guess there is confusion in my mind after sixteen years, but the drawing seems more right to me.” ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THE CIGAR SHAPE WAS? Probably 60 yards. THAT’S PRETTY LONG. Yes, a pretty big thing. WHEN IT MOVED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT AND YOU SAW THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME WITH THE LIGHTS STILL THERE, WHAT HAPPENED IMMEDIATELY AFTER? It stopped for a second. I thought it was getting ready to leave, so I jumped into my car and sure enough, the thing started going down the street, down the fairway. That area of town was heavily filled with 2-story Victorian-type houses. And I’m thinking, he’s going to hit one of those houses. When you go south down that street that runs parallel with the golf course and fairway # 9, it comes to an end after two blocks. You have to turn left or right and go around a block. And I’m thinking he is going to hit the house at the end of the street. He got to that house and stopped. Then he went up and over and disappeared. I’m telling you, in just a blink of an eye, he was gone! And whether he left or whether he shut off the lights and just set there in the air, I don’t know. All I know is that he was gone. All-Knowing Stranger in the Restaurant I thought, ‘Well, I think I’ll keep this one to myself’ and went on to work. I checked my watch and had not lost much time to speak of, maybe five or eight minutes. To the left as you went in the restaurant was a huge, elevated horseshoe-shaped bar. I noticed there was a guy sitting at the bar and he was facing me. My dinner came, I’m eating my dinner, and every once in awhile I’d glance up and the guy was just sitting there staring at me. I finish my dinner and I’m standing by the front door and one of my cocktail waitresses comes up and she has an issue. We're talking and every once in awhile I’d glance over to that guy and he was still staring at me! Pretty soon, she leaves and the guy gets up and walks over to me. I’m thinking, ‘Oh, boy, something is wrong.’ And he said, ‘Can I talk to you?’ I said, ‘Yeah, sure.’ And he said, ‘Why don’t we go outside.’ (laughs) I thought he wants to fight now. So, we went out in front of the building and he said to me, ‘Did you have something funny happen to you on the way to work tonight?’ And I said, ‘Why don’t you tell me what happened to me on the way to work tonight?’ He said, ‘Well, we were just checking up on you.’ I said, ‘Why don’t you explain that.’ He said, ‘Let me explain this.’ He then stood there and proceeded to tell me about my entire life from the day I was born to the present moment and he never missed a thing. He knew everything about me – things I had forgotten about! Things I had tried to keep secret in my life. He knew it all, everything. Then he said something that was kind of strange. Do you remember when you were about six or seven years old, there was a strange red light that came into your parents’ house through the front room window and it illuminated your whole front room. Do you remember that?’ I said, ‘I don’t recall that.’ He said, ‘Well, we were checking on you then, too.’ He said, ‘You’re one of the special ones.’ And then he handed me a business card and said, ‘If you ever want to talk with me again, you can reach me here.’ I said, ‘Thank you,’ and stuck the card in my pocket. Then he turned around and walked away. CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM? Sure, he was about 5 feet 11 inches tall. I’d say he weighed about 150 pounds, very thin. He had a beard, brownish hair – full beard and moustache. The color of his eyes I can’t tell"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you because I think he had glasses on, so I couldn’t see his eyes very well. He wore a pair of blue jeans and he wore a plaid-type shirt. On top of that, he wore a leather fringe-type jacket. He had on boots, but they weren’t western boots. They were square-toed almost like a motorcycle boot, only nicer. He also wore a leather hat like you might see some of the guides wearing down in places like Australia. WHAT COLOR WAS THE HAT? Kind of a tannish color, like the jacket. HIS BOOTS WERE BLACK? I think they were a dark brown. DID YOU SAY, ‘HOW DO YOU KNOW DETAILS ABOUT MY LIFE?’ Actually, I was flabbergasted. I was so stunned by what this guy was telling me that I couldn’t say anything. But I was thinking things and apparently he knew what I was thinking because he was saying things to me that I was thinking. Golf Course Grass Dies in Cigar-Shape The other strange thing is that the grass area at the golf course where this thing with the lights was apparently hovering, the grass in the roughage area turned brown. I noticed the next spring, they had come out and replaced all that sod in there and got rid of all that brown grass. Then that grass also turned brown! WAS THERE A SHAPE TO THE BROWNESS? Kind of oblong, like a big cigar! Seriously! And they changed that grass out in there for the next three to four years and every year it died out again and not at the time of year (winter) when it should die down. I’m talking spring and summertime, it was dead, brown, while everything around it was a pretty green. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT WHATEVER THE CIGAR-SHAPED CRAFT WAS, IT WAS RADIATING SOME KIND OF ENERGY THAT WENT INTO THE PLANTS AND SOIL AND STAYED THERE? That’s my guess. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE STRANGER, DO YOU HAVE ANY INTUITIVE SENSE OF WHETHER HE WAS HUMAN OR NOT? My common sense tells me he was human, but my gut feeling says – and you’ve got to remember that I’m an old cop (laughs) – my gut feeling says I spent twenty minutes talking to somebody who was not from this world. I WONDER WHY HE USED THE PHRASE, ‘YOU’RE ONE OF THE SPECIAL ONES’? That’s a good question. That’s a real good question. Five Years Later, Jon Spaulding Is Not Breathing Well The rest of the night was uneventful. In fact, for the next five years or so, everything was uneventful. ( 1992 until 1997) In 1995, I had hired on in a sheriff’s department west of Colorado Springs. By 1997, I started experiencing dizzy spells. So, I went to a local clinic. They examined me and said I had viral pneumonia. The only treatment for that is oxygen. You have to be on oxygen for 24 hours a day for a long time. So, I was on oxygen for a couple of months until I was told the pneumonia had cleared up. But I said, ‘I still can’t breathe. I’m having a hard time breathing.’ So, they did a blood/oxygen count on me and it was very low. They decided to send me to a pulmonary specialist, so I went to Denver and saw a specialist there. He did some tests, including a lung biopsy on November 3, 1997. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Diagnosis He said, ‘We’ve confirmed the worst. You have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. There is no treatment for it and there is no cure for it and you’ve got about two years or less to live. [ Editor’s Note: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis involves scarring of the lung. Gradually, the air sacs of the lungs become replaced by fibrotic tissue. When the scar forms, the tissue becomes thicker causing an irreversible loss of the tissue’s ability to transfer oxygen into the bloodstream. The most current thinking is that the fibrotic process is a reaction to microscopic injury to the lung, but the exact cause remains unknown. Se e: “Radiation-Induced Pulmonary Fibrosis” – BioOne Journal, Vol. 157, March 2002.” ] I checked out of the hospital and worked almost another two years up in another the sheriff’s department west of Colorado Springs until I could not function anymore. I couldn’t leave the house. I couldn’t get off my oxygen machine. So, I resigned from the department. Did Radiation from the Cigar-Shaped Craft in 1992 Damage Spaulding's Lungs? I had to go back in 1999 and have some blood work done. When I was doing that, there was a male nurse working on me and he was injecting a needle. He asked me, ‘What did they tell you that you have?’ I told him, ‘Well, they are telling me that I have idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. He looked up and said, ‘That’s what I have!’ He said he was on a naval ship that had a meltdown on the nuclear reactor. Everybody who was aboard the ship now has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis caused by the over-exposure to radiation. And I was thinking, ‘Over- exposure to radiation!’ WOW, AND THE GRASS WENT BROWN IN THE SHAPE OF A CIGAR, SO IN 1992, YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO RADIATION THAT CAUSED YOUR DISEASE. That’s plagued my mind for years. IF THAT WERE TRUE, THEN WHAT WOULD THE ROLE BE OF SOMEONE PERHAPS NOT HUMAN APPEARING AS HUMAN KNOWING EVERYTHING ABOUT YOUR LIFE AND SAYING THEY HAD CHECKED UP ON YOU WHEN YOU WERE 6-YEARS-OLD WITH THE RED LIGHT IN YOUR HOUSE AND THAT HE WAS CHECKING IN WITH YOU ABOUT THE CIGAR-SHAPED CRAFT THAT YOU SAW. HE DISAPPEARS AND YOUR GUT TELLS YOU AS A LONG-TIME POLICE OFFICER THAT HE WAS NOT HUMAN. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE INTUITIVELY OR IN DREAMS YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD OF WHAT MIGHT BE COMING IN THE NEXT FOUR OR FIVE YEARS, GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE NOW OUT-LIVED THE PROGNOSIS OF DEATH WITH THE DISEASE? You know, if I could answer that question, Linda, (laughs). No, I don’t have a clue! And I keep expecting something to happen. I keep expecting to have this guy walk up to me again somewhere. If they know where I’m at during the course of my life, they know where I’m at now. Unexpected Confirmation of 1949 Red Light Event by Spaulding's Mom Thanksgiving of 2002 we flew back to Colorado Springs to have Thanksgiving with my folks. My dad had just passed away in May 2002. During the course of that dinner, there was my mother, myself and my wife, my brother and his wife, two nephews and their wives and kids and we’re all sitting around this huge table."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"So Mom said, ‘Has anyone got anything new to say?’ And I said, ‘Sure, I’ve got a story to tell you!’ So, I tell them the story I just told you about this sighting, whatever it was, and meeting that guy. When I got to the part about the red light coming in the front room, my mother dropped her fork. And it was just dead silence. She said, ‘I remember that very, very well. This light came in through the window in the front room. You were playing on the floor. And we couldn’t figure out what in the world that was! And Dad got up and went out on the front porch and said, ‘There’s nothing out here!’ That light had illuminated the front room, going down one wall, across the floor, up the other wall, across the ceiling. After Dad went out, it was gone – phew! I remember that like it was yesterday.’ Nobody spoke for a good long time after that. YOU MUST HAVE BEEN STUNNED THAT THIS STRANGER AT THE RESTAURANT WOULD BE THE ONE WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT AN EVENT THAT YOU DID NOT REMEMBER, BUT THAT YOUR MOTHER DID. Yes. I would not have remembered since I was about 6-years-old at the time. She remembered it because it was apparently eventful enough for her to remember. It was kind of a shocker to mom and dad apparently. They couldn’t figure out where that light was coming from or what it was doing in the house! IF THE STRANGER IS FROM ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM OR BEYOND, WHY WOULD THERE BE ONLY A FEW OF THESE INCIDENTS DESCRIBED BY ONLY A FEW PEOPLE? Well, I don’t really have an answer to that question other than that possibly they (non-humans) have a select few (humans) that they want to use as a medium. ‘Here’s what’s going on, we know about you, and now you know that we’re here – tell people.’ Whatever happened to me and whatever has happened to others – especially those who have vivid accounts of abductions – is beyond my normal scope of thinking! How do you deal with that? I don’t have a bunch of visions and I can’t foretell the future and I have a hard time remembering yesterday (laughs). I also have an expectation that whoever or whatever these beings are, they are going to make a full disclosure, or our government is going to make a full disclosure, in the very near future. I think that’s going to occur. They can’t hide it anymore.” A bout the card the stranger handed Jon Spaulding - Jon has looked for it many times and so far has not found it. But he remembered the geographical location on the stranger's card. Today he has a friend who is going to that location to try to find more information, if possible, about an antique store the stranger was supposed to own and operate. Jon Spaulding will let me know if he learns more - or if the stranger suddenly appears in his life again.
