There was a full moon on New Year's Day and anot her last night on January 31st. It's unusual to have two full moons occur in the same month. And it will happen again in March. That's even more unusual. In fact, double \"blue moons\" won't happen again until 2018. Why blue? you might ask. Well, editors at Sky & Telescope magazine checked their archives and found \"blue moon\" mentioned in a 1937 farmers' almanac. But the story had nothing to do with tw o full moons in the same month. So, it's still a mystery why the color blue ever got attached to a second full moon. Another unusual astronomical event happened in January on Saturday, the 23rd. John Horack, a NASA spokesman, said U. S. and European scientists caught their first ever \"live\" picture of a gamma-ray burst from space. Horack told reporters, \"It was huge. This is one of the brightest bursts we have ever seen.\" That's saying something since back on August 27th, 1998, several satellites detected a gamma and x-ray burst so powe rful that it temporarily ionized the upper atmosphere and caused at least two satellites to automatically shut down in order to prevent electronic damage. Gamma-ray bursts were first noticed thirty years ago. No one knows what causes them. While scientists are now analyzing the January 23rd gamma burst, I talked with Dr. John Huchra, Professor of Astronomy at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He was one of the co-discoverers of what is called the Great Wall of Galaxies back in 1989 and he continues to puzzle over many current cosmic mysteries, including the huge gamma ray bursts. Astrophysicists have confirmed the existence of black holes that pull in everything around them, including light. Where does all the matter and energy go? Some scientists theorize there are wh ite holes that spew back out what goes into black holes. So I asked Dr. John Huchra if white holes had ever been documented and might they have something to do with the extraordinary and mysterious gamma ray bursts. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"John Huchra, Ph.D., Professor of Astronomy, Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"No. Although there are some people who think that some of these giant gamma ray bursts and other explosions like that other giant outbursts of radiation could be due to things like white holes erupting. However, the current favored models are not those.\" IF THESE HUGE GAMMA RAY RADIATIONS THAT WE MEASURE ONCE IN AWHILE WERE WHITE HOLE EXPLOSIONS INTO OUR UNIVERSE - THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE COMING FROM SOMEPLACE OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSE, WOULDN'T THEY? \"Well, that's a tough question. As you see, there are things that we don't know about physics and about the universe. . ..And for example, in the case of the universe, the most favored model right now is infinite size. And it may be bounded or may not be. But if the universe is infinite in size, we again- even if we did spend a lot of time mapping th e universe - would only see out to what we call the horizon. WE'D NEVER BE ABLE TO GET OUTS IDE OF IT TO LOOK IN, SO TO SPEAK? That's basically right. You can't get outside to look in. So, it's a hypothetical question at the moment - and we don't know the answer. BUT IT'S HYPOTHETICALLY POSSIBLE THAT THE BIG BANG COULD HAVE BEEN A WHITE HOLE ERUPTION FROM SOME PLACE OUTSIDE THE CURRENT UNIVERSE? Could well be, but the most favored theori es that come out of particle physics are not white hole theories, but rather a ssume there was some vacuum energy in the universe or universes, plural, that was eventually released and created the matter we see today. WE ALWAYS GET BACK TO TH E QUESTION OF WHY AND HOW DID ALL THIS BEGIN? And was there anything before it? And you want to know the answer? The answer is we don't know. WHY DOES THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE KEEP CHANGING? The age of the universe keeps changing because we keep getting a lot more information about what's happening out there. You may know that in fact the history of the subject goes back to 1929 and 1930 or so when Edwin Hubble first discovered the expansion of the universe -- that galaxies tend to be moving away from us, are red shifted. He tried to calculate the expansion rate of the universe by measuring distances and velocities to galaxies back then. The only problem was that in 1929 when he did th at, he got an age for the universe that was only 2 billion years. And that was a bit of an embarrassment, because at the same time geologists at the same time we re finding that ages of the earth is about 3.5 billion years. So, by definition, it didn't make sense for the earth to be older than the universe. TODAY, I THINK GEOLOGISTS ARE PLACING THE EARTH CLOSER TO 4.5 BILLION YEARS AND THE ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM AT 5 BILLION. Yes, something like that. But fortunately, astronomers figured out what Hubble didn't quite get right and we are now talking about expansion ages for the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"universe in the range of 10 to 14 or billion years. IN JANUARY IN AUSTIN, THE AMERICAN ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY ISSUED INFORMATION SAYING THEY ARE PRETTY CONFIDENT NOW THAT THE UNIVERSE IS BEING REDEFINED AT ABOUT 14 BILLION YEARS IN AGE. WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO CLARIFY EVEN THAT MUCH? Well, a couple of other things as well. There are usually three pi eces to this puzzle. One is to determine how fast the universe is expanding because that allows you to track back the expansion to the time of the Big Bang when it all started -- the astronomer's definition of the age of the universe. The other thing that has happened that is incredibly important has been the discovery in just the past year that it looks as if in fact the universe is, number one, less dense than many of the theorists thought it was. So the universe is not expanding as fast -- how do I put it? -- the universe's expans ion is not slowing down as fast as they thought it was. Hold that thought. It's a confusing one. But there's also been a discovery by tw o different groups now, using very distant Super Nova -- also observed with the Hubble Sp ace Telescope -- that there appears to be some pressure force, a Cosmological Constant, that is in fact increasing the expansion rate of the universe with time. IS THE ANALOGY SOMETHING LI KE -- IF YOU WERE BLOWING UP A BALLOON THAT THE AIR YOU ARE PUTTING INTO THE BALLOON THAT IS MAKING IT EXPAND WOULD BE ANALOGOUS TO THIS PRESSURE THAT IS BLOWING OUT THE UNIVERSE? That's a reasonable way of thinking about it. It has some flaws because we don't think of the Cosmological Constant as matter, but it's right in the sense that it's a pressure term that is sort of the opposite of gravity. It's repulsive as opposed to attractive. SO THE QUESTION IS; WHAT IS THE PRESSURE THAT IS BLOWING UP THE UNIVERSE? Exactly. We've found evidence that it's there. It's not absolutely certain yet. Looking at it with a somewhat jaundiced eye of an experimentalist, so my job is to knock down theories rather than to bu ild them up -- it's not absolutely certain it's the right answer. But evidence is beginning to look pretty good that the stuff is out there. I should say, that the Cosmological Constant probably exists. WHICH IS THIS PRESSURE? Which is the pressure term, that's correct. But we do NOT know what it is. IS IT ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THERE COULD BE OTHER UNIVERSES OUTSIDE OF THIS ONE SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY SOME KIND OF ELECTROMAGNETIC MEMBRANE AND THAT INSTEAD OF A PRESSURE INSIDE THIS UNIVERSE EXPANDING, THAT THERE IS ACTUALLY SOME KIND OF DYNAMIC BETWEEN OTHER UNIVERSES THAT ARE CAUSING ALMOST AN ATTRACTION TO EXPAND? Well, that's one idea. There are a number that have been put forward. But the multiple universe idea was almost something required in the past because of the fact it appears that universes that are just exactly bound -- that have just exactly enough material in them to stop expanding in infinite time -- another very complicated concept -- were the very favored ones by theoretical cosmologists."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"However, with the discovery of a possible Cosmological Constant and with the very strong evidence that exists that the amount of matter in the universe -- the mass energy density in the universe is only about one-third -- a quarter to a third -- of what is required to stop the ex pansion -- OK? The need for a multiple universe theory goes away. BUT ISN'T THERE A LOT OF CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHAT IS CALLED \"DARK MATTER\" OR \"HIDDEN MATTER\" THAT MIGHT SWITCH THE BALANCE TO A UNIVERSE THAT WILL CONTRACT ON ITSELF? It's going away. In other words, we expe rimentalists have not found enough stuff out there to really close the universe. If the numbers that are currently being talked about are correct, then the expansion age of the universe ends up being somewhere between 14 and 16 billion years -- that includes the low mass density, the value of the expansion rates that we have been measuring with the Hubble Sp ace Telescope, and the presence of a Cosmological Constant. THAT IS AS OF JANUARY 1999 WITH WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THIS COSMOLOGICAL CONSTANT PRESSURE EXPANSION? That's right. And that may solve another problem that's been around for awhile because without the Cosmological Constant -- even with a low mass density -- one was getting ages for the universe that were between 12 and 14 billion years -- and that was slightly less than what we thought the ages of the oldest stars were -- which is now 14 to 16. SO, NOW THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THAT STRANGE PROBLEM THAT WAS DESCRIBED LAST YEAR AND THE YEAR BEFORE THAT SOME STARS SEEM TO BE OL DER THAN THE AGE OF THE UNIVERSE APPEARED TO BE? Right. And at the same time we discovered that those stars in the globular clusters which we think are the oldest collection of stars in the universe may in fact be a little bit younger than we thought just a few years ago -- a re-calibration of the distance to those objects, also based on satellite data allows us to measure more accurate distances. WHAT IS THE AGE ESTIMATED NOW OF THE GLOBULAR CLUSTERS? I'd say that if you take the evidence -- you're probably getting 14 billion years plus or minus a couple. THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE CLEAR AT WHAT WE WOULD CONSIDER TO BE THE EDGE OF THE BIG BANG WHERE THE GLOBULAR CLUSTERS WERE AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE IN THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE? Well, they are the oldest things we can see around us in terms of stars. And there may be some older things in the model, but in terms of our ability to measure the things we see here -- it's a little bit like age dating a rock except you have to use theory and the measured properties of the stars in these clusters to estimate the age. If all of these suppositions are correct, then I think as Mike Turner at the Univ. of Chicago is often fond of saying -- now, that is -- \"we may have solved the cosmological problem. We may have the correct age for the age of the universe."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We may have the right ages for the oldest stars that we see around. And the solution to the problem is better data on the expansion rate. And the presence of the Cosmological Constant, this pressure. DOES IT HAVE AN EERIE FEELING TO YOU TO CONTEMPLATE THAT WE'RE IN A UNIVERSE THAT COULD KEEP EXPANDING INFINITELY FOREVER? No, believe it or not. I've been working on this for too long to have a particular point or view. And in fact, I tend to like to read poetry in my off hours. And I'm always struck by Robert Frost's line about the universe ending in fire or ice. \"Ice will suffice.\" MEANING IT WILL GET COLDER, NOT HOTTER. That's right.\" But, how did it happen? Well, that's the $64,000 question. Are they the result of some process that came through what we call the combination - the time when matter started to really dominate what was happening in the universe, or not? And the answer again is: I don't know. One of the problems we're coming down to, assuming that the Big Picture is now coming close to closure assuming January 1999 cosmology as a whole is solved, the question now is how the heck do we get the things that we see to form and be the way they are. And so far, none of the models -- none of the theoretical models of how structure forms in the un iverse -- does a good job of making these big things. That's why it's very importan t to find out if they are real. Whether they are gravitationally bound or things like that. B ecause in fact, the next level down in the cosmology, there is this pr oblem -- what the observer sees -- what we see when we go out to map things is n't what the theories of the moment are predicting. And there is a debate about that between the observers and the theorists, but in this case you better trust the observers. WHY WOULD GALAXIES LINE UP LIGHT YEARS IN DIAMETER? I don't know. What's usually done now to te st out various theories and models is to put everything into a big computer. And generally these simulations do show up filamentary structures. But the filamentary structures that come out of the simulations are on a much, much smaller scale than the kinds of things that David or I or Margaret are finding. IF THIS PRESSURE THAT HAS BEEN EXPANDING THE UNIVERSE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT, HOW COULD MATTER HAVE LINED UP IN LONG STRINGS? That's a question I don't know the answer to. We think it's gravity. But we haven't made it work yet.\" Is Pluto A Planet, Or A Kuiper Belt Object? The scientist at the center of this new controversy about re-categorizing Pluto is astronomer Brian Marsden, Associate Director of Planetary Sciences at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Recently I asked him a bout headlines such as: \"What is Pluto anyway? Experts Debate.\" Brian Marsden, Associate Director , Planetary Sciences, Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"It's about time that Pluto should be considered as a member of the Kuiper Belt. I think many astronomers have come around to that way of thinking anyway. THE KUIPER BELT IS? Yes, the Kuiper Belt -- also called the Neptunian Belt -- is a group of bodies on the outskirts of the Solar System out beyond Neptune -- probably extending quite some distance beyond Neptune and a pretty large group. Maybe a total amount of the mass in the belt could be almost equal to that of the earth. A number of bodies have been discovered in that region beginning in 1992 and we've got 90 members as of this time. And many of those members actually have orbits that are very much like the orbit of Pluto. All this material we are talking about is basically icy and if you bring an icy object close enough to the sun, you get a comet. The ice vaporizes and releases dust and stuff that's in it to make a tail. CRAIG TOMBAUGH IN 1930 -- WHICH WAS JUST ABOUT 70 YEARS AGO -- FIRST DISCOVERED PLUTO AND IT WAS CLASSIFIED AS A PLANET THEN. WHY 70 YEARS LATER IS THERE NOW THIS QUESTION ABOUT HOW TO CATEGORIZE PLUTO? WHY IS IT NOT A PLANET? I'm not saying it's not a planet. The problem is one of semantics and terminology. ISN'T IT TRUE THAT PLUTO IS EVEN SMALLER IN DIAMETER THAN OUR OWN MOON? Yes, indeed, Pluto is quite a bit smaller than the moon and only 1/5th the mass of the moon. It took really until 1978 to determine the mass of the Pluto properly because in that year a satellite of Pluto -- Chyron -- was discovered and by measuring how far away it was from Pluto and how long it took to go round Pluto -- you could determine the mass of Pluto to be about 1/5th the mass of our moon. And as for determinations of the size of Pluto, this was done in the 1980s b ecause it so happened that there were some occasions where the satellite would pass in front of Pluto itself and visa versa and using that information you could determine the size which is about 1500 miles. WHAT IS IT THAT PROVOKED YOU AND THE INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMICAL UNION RIGHT NOW TO GO FOR A RE-DEFINITION OF PLUTO? Well, in the past few years since 1992, we have had discoveries of other objects like Pluto, but smaller. They are in that part of the Solar System and some of them have orbits like the orbit of Pluto with periods of revolution about the sun of 248 years. These objects are smaller. The largest object we know so far of the 90 or so that we've discovered there is about 400 miles across. So it's about 1/3rd or 1/4 of the diameter of Pluto."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I think during the next 5 to 10 years we will discover another object out there that is the same size -- maybe even larger than Pluto. THAN PLUTO? I would not be at all surprised. IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL OPINION AS AN ASTRONOMER, WHAT DO YOU THINK PLUTO IS? A CAPTURED COMET? A CAPTURED ASTEROID? IT HAS THIS VERY ODD ORBIT. WHAT DO YOU THINK PLUTO REALLY IS? Oh, I think Pluto is related to comets. I don't think it was captured from anywhere. I think that the comets originated in that part of the Solar System. They formed just beyond Neptune and didn't form into a large planet like Neptune. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL THE ICY DEBRIS LEFT OVER FROM THE FORMATION OF TH E SOLAR SYSTEM OUT THERE? Yes, indeed. And that icy debris -- what we are seeing out there are fairly large objects. These are several -- all of them we have seen there must be a hundred miles across or more or we couldn't s ee them. So, they are rather large for comets, yes. But presumably there are smaller bodies there that we just can't detect. There must be an enormous amount of material there and Pluto just happens to be a giant among all the rest of it. But we are not taking away its status as a major planet. It will still continue to have dual citizenship, if you like. It will still continue to be on the list of major planets. And the International Astronomical Union is not proposing to demote Pluto in any way! SO THE FACT THAT PLUTO IS AT THE EDGE OF A BELT OF ICY OBJECTS THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS THE TRANS-NEPTUNIAN OBJECTS -- THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO COME UP WITH CATEGORIZATIONS THAT WOULD SAY PLUTO IS UNIQUE AND UNUSUAL AND HAS AN UNUSUAL ORBIT AND IS VERY SMALL -- SMALLER THAN THE MOON. IT'S STILL GOING TO BE THE 9TH PLANET, IT'S NOT CHANGING THAT DESIGNATION, BUT YOU ARE TRYING TO CATALOG ALL THOSE OBJECTS OUT THERE THAT YOU REFER TO GENERALLY AS TRANS-NEPTUNIAN AND ARE GENERALLY ICY BODIES? That is exactly what is happening. And furthermore, we may get more discoveries. I fully expect things Pluto sized -- verging on Pluto size or maybe even slightly larger than Pluto -- to be found. So, what are we going to do with those? Yes, we are going to put them in our catalog, but we may also want to consider adding those to the list of the major planets at some time in the future. YOU ARE CONSIDERED ONE OF THE EXPERTS ON COMETS. WE ARE HEADED INTO 1999 AND 2000. ARE THERE ANY COMETS THAT YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HAVE FOUND THAT MAY BE COMING THROUGH IN THE NEXT YEAR OR TWO OR THREE? No, we don't have any bright ones on th e way that we know about. Any bright comet that would come along would be unexpected. Now, I realize that there are certain mystic groups suggesting that there is going to be a big comet coming, I think July or August this year is one of the months mentioned this year by"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"some mystical reasoning. I receive e-mail a bout this and letters from time to time and questions that people ask me about th is. And I have to answer that we know of no such comet. There is no comet on it s way in that will be at all bright, visible with the naked eye. Certainly no t one that is going to come and collide with the earth. There is none that we know about. And if there are people out there claiming that something is coming that we don't know about, I would like to know how they know that is going to happen. We certainly don't, and we're usually the first to know this sort of thing.\" At the recent American Astronomical Society meeting in Austin, Texas, the largest structures ever seen in the universe were described -- two strings of galaxies stretching for nearly two billion light years. If our universe is about 16 billion light years in diameter, these galaxies stretch over at least one-eighth of it. And there might be even more of them. In fact, some astronomers are referring to the strings of galaxies as \"imprints of the big bang\" that grew from lumps in the primordial soup of matter and energy soon after creation. Astronomy is a hard science where physical evidence is measured and analyzed. The problem is, as Dr. Huchra pointed out, each year brings new refinements in technologies and data which can change theories, conclusions and even the definition of something as big as a plan et. An editorial in the January 25th, 1999 Boston Globe newspaper said: \"Nothing pushe s the public outrage button quite like semantics or the fear that something familiar is being scrapped, even if it's several billion miles from Earth and has been the subject of scientific debate for years. \"Because of its size, its distance from the sun, and its unusual egg-shaped orbit, so different from the more circular orbits of the other planets, astronomers have been arguing the merits of including Pluto in the planetary lineup almost since its discovery by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930.\" As much as astronomers keep learning, it's a fact that only about ONE PERCENT of the universe has been mapped and studied so far. Only 1%. So the cosmic surprises yet to be discovered must be many. http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/cfa-local-home.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
