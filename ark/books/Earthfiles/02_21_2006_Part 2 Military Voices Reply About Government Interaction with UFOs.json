S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about his discussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106 Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative Andrew Kissner's (Dona Ana County, Las Cruces) investigations of V-2 rocket research at White Sands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"Peculiar Phenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles. Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people who have either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of people who have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. I feel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radio listeners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond, what I am posting in this first in a series of Earthfiles military voices. C ontinued from 020706Earthfiles: Military Voices Respond to January 2006 Earthfiles and Radio Reports 7) Naval Officer Says UFO Shot Down by U. S. in 1940s \"I wanted to relate the story of my father, who was a U. S. Navy officer from 1941 to 1973. From 1962 to 1973, he was a captain and during this period, he was granted the highest security clearance which was referred to as a 'super security clearance.' Naturally, this gave him the ability to see and hear about the most classified material. He was also the Reserve CO of NAS Twin Cities in Minneapolis from 1969 until the base was decommissioned in 1970. Because of his rank, security clearance and the fact he possessed a bachelor's in science from Eastern Michigan University, he was selected in 1965 to attend what was called a 'West Coast Weapons Seminar' sponsored by the military and contractors Lockheed and Aerojet-General, which together worked on the Polaris missile project at the time. The meetings took place at the Naval Base at Point Hueneme, California, and the emphasis was on propulsion systems. My father stated that roughly 50 scientists and high-ranking military officers were in attendance at the 1965 seminar. \"Upon listening to your news update on Coast (January 20, 2006), I decided to pose some questions to my father. Mind you, he had not listened to the show. In fact, he never has heard Coast to Coast AM , so his answers could not be influenced by any media. I began asking him if the subject of ETs and UFOs was ever discussed at the very classified 1965 seminar. He initially stated that he really could not get into specifics of what was discussed. \"Then I asked - if based on what he might have heard or seen at the seminar - did he believe ETs existed. He said, 'Well, I would say yes.' After what was a 'pregnant pause,' he actually SHOCKED me by volunteering the following. 'Well, there was a craft shot down.' I asked, 'What craft was shot down?' He replied, 'A UFO had been shot down some years before ... I believe it was the late 1940s.' I asked, 'Was it one of more than one?' He stated that to his "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knowledge, just one had been shot down. This seemed to dovetail with what you discussed on Coast to Coast. \"He added that the V-2 program you referred to was, he believed, utilized exclusively by the Navy for the subsequent development of the Polaris intercontinental missile and that the Navy was many years ahead of the other services in missile technology. \"As you would understand, none of this material was brought home by him and was strictly 'For Eyes Only' and discourse was only among a relatively limited group of officers and scientists. Although today he is 86, he maintains a relatively sharp mind and his knowledge of the military remains quite awesome. As a highly-decorated officer, he always was extremely level- headed and thoroughly professional. During his tenure as a captain, he also made visits to NORAD, Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota, offut AFB near Omaha, NAS Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, and served a short time at the Pentagon.\" 8) USAF Security Sergeant, Elgin AFB, Watched UFOs Through Binoculars \"I was an Air Force Security Sergeant at Eglin AFB, Florida, years ago, and saw through Admiral 'Bull' Halsey's own binoculars two spacecraft moving through space from points far out in space from point A toward point B. \"Anyway, I think that Earth got the attention of the recent ET folks in 1945 when we detonated the first nuclear weapons. When Harry Truman signed the 'National Security Act' into law in 1947, I believe he unwittingly signed away our republic! It's the birth of the 'National Security State.' \"The absolutely most stupid thing that Earth's present governments can do is demonstrate hostility toward these advanced ETs!\" 9) Manzano Base Employee, Albuquerque, NM, in Late 1980s \"I still wonder on a daily basis about what bodies would have required storage inside morgue drawers set into the solid granite of an alcove behind a substantial locked gate - -an alcove that was behind another inner gate for a room marked 'Morgue' on old blueprints that I saw while I worked inside Manzano Base. At that time in late 1980s, Manzano Base was guarded by pimply-faced SPs with orders to shoot to kill. There were three fences - the middle one gave us our entertainment if we ventured outside of the mountain at lunch time, particularly on a rainy day. Tumble weeds would just go 'poof' when they hit that middle fence. \"I realized that special weapons were stored at that time; thus, the insanely high security at Manzano. However, we had our own pimply-faced SPs who guarded our tunnels and we were not working with anything that I would call 'extraterrestrially weird.' It was just terrestrial stuff that I may or may not be at liberty to talk about, but I'll err on the side of caution and still not talk about. \"Anyway, why were those morgue drawers so protected?? Manzano, by the way, is way the heck out at the edge of Kirtland AFB. If you can get on base and drive down Wyoming until it ends, it ends at Manzano. I know it's been fully declassified/deactivated, so the fence and all that might no longer be there. \"Also, anything about underground areas at Wright-Patterson AFB? I worked in Area C and there were a lot of air ventilators poking up in a very large otherwise empty field out near where I worked which was the Joint Logistics Systems Center (JLSC).\" 10) UFOs On Radar At NORAD Base in North Carolina in Early 1970s \"I joined the U. S. Air Force in 1970 and have been on active duty and in the USAF Reserve ever since. I will be retiring this year. From 1972 to 1974, I was stationed at a small radar site (701st Radar Squadron, Fort Fisher Air Force Station, Kure Beach, North Carolina). The base was part of NORAD. I was in communications and we ran the teletypes and switchboard for the base."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"We handled very little classified traffic, so when the people in the radar rooms downstairs brought classified traffic up to the communications center, it was a notable occasion. \"Also notable (at least for me since I have always been interested in UFOs) were the telephone calls we would occasionally get from off base about lights or UFOs out over the ocean. When we got one of these calls, we always noted it in our Master Station log. Most of the time, the calls would be put through to the radar officers downstairs, but occasionally they would be busy downstairs and we would take down the information and then pass it on. I don't know where the information went from there. \"During my first summer there in 1972, I started noticing something. The radar would occasionally go down. When this happened, we would get a short classified message to send out and what it usually said was that the radar was down and they were running diagnostics. At some point after that, we would get another classified message to send out that would say either that the radar was back up and it would state what the problem had been; or we would send a message that said the radar was 'running rabbits.' \"I was curious and asked what 'running rabbits' was and was told it meant they could not find a problem. They had run all the internal diagnostics and the radar was working properly, so the consensus was that it was interference from outside the system. \"That summer was also very active for lights being seen out over the ocean and we got a lot of telephone calls late on swing shifts or during midnight shifts. The typical call would be from someone who had been walking on the beach or out on one of the piers at night anywhere from Wrightsville Beach down the coast through Holden Beach. The people usually told about watching lights out over the ocean where the horizon should be. They were usually red, but sometimes were orange or deep yellow. Everyone always assumed that the lights were shrimp boats or fishing boats until the lights would suddenly shoot up into the sky and disappear. I could visualize what they were talking about because I had seen similar lights over Lake Huron and Lake Michigan when I was a kid growing up in Michigan. \"I started seeing a connection between the sightings of the lights and the radar being down. And not just the radar being down, but the radar 'running rabbits.' The calls got so common that summer. We worked rotating shifts and I personally took close to a dozen reports from late spring through early fall 1972. Multiply that by three other shifts and it potentially was quite a few reports. The radar OIC (officer in charge) asked that we not even put the calls through to the radar room and just take the information down at the switchboard and pass it on to them. \"I remember one call particularly. It was early on a midnight shift, probably around 0100. The caller identified himself as Airman something, US Air Force Reserve. He sounded a little shook up. He said that he and his girlfriend had been out on the end of the Kure Beach Pier, closest to the base, and they had been sitting on one of the fishing benches when a light caught his eye. He pointed it out to her. It was red and was moving slowly from right to left and back again. He said he was telling her that it was probably a shrimp boat when it suddenly shot up to about 10 to 15 degrees above the horizon. He was very detailed in his description, even mentioning that there was no moon, that it was a clear night. He said the red light hovered there for a couple of minutes while he and his girlfriend speculated about what it was. \"He decided that it was probably a helicopter, maybe a boat had gone down and the coast guard was doing a search. He said that about the time he had made that speculation, the light started to get larger. At first he thought it was expanding. Then he realized that it was actually moving toward them. He said that they sat and watched as it very quickly approached them and then passed directly over them at a speed that no helicopter could achieve. He said it was even faster than a fighter jet. What really freaked him out was that there was NO SOUND whatsoever, not even a rush of air and that the lights on the pier flickered and went out as it approached, as did the lights in the building on the beach where the pier started and there were street lights. Then the lights came back on as the red light moved away from the toward the mainland. He and his girlfriend immediately went back to his house, about a fifteen minutes drive, and he called the base and made his report. \"The interesting thing that I noticed was that almost every time I got a call"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"about lights or a UFO, the radar was down running rabbits or would be in the next few minutes. But I didn't get a call every time the radar was running rabbits. Sometimes the radar would go down during daylight hours. Just to check my observations and satisfy my curiosity, I pulled out station logs and message logs from other shifts and found that they were pretty much the same as mine. If someone reported lights or a UFO, the radar was down. \"At one point, I talked to one of the radar officers about this and asked him if he thought it was possible that the radar was being jammed. At first he quoted the official AF statement that this radar was virtually unjammable. But then he grinned and shrugged and said that he could not think of what else it might be.\" 11) White Sands Missile Range, 1964 \"I now realize that I was not imagining what I witnessed in a late evening walk while I was stationed at White Sands Missile Range in 1964. I was formerly trained by the U. S. Army at Redstone Arsenal Ordnance Guided Missile School and then I was assigned to an Honest John, Little John and Lance Missile testing unit. The contractor for the Lance Missile was LTV. \"Having had a SECRET clearance, I had been to some of the most sensitive areas of White Sands, the V-2 launch pad, the 'Blockhouse,' Trinity site, and so on. I had some knowledge of the history of those areas prior to being there, including the Lonnie Zamora episode that was alleged to have occurred during the time that I was assigned to WSMR, not far from Socorro. I was 19-years-old in 1964 and was involved in firing missiles every month from various sites on the ranges at White Sands. \"We did testing of the missiles under all conditions imaginable and some unimaginable. The situation that placed me in a late night walk at about 20:00 hours was as follows. I was enroute from the Billets to the Bus Terminal to bring another soldier back to the Billets where he would be staying for the night before moving on to his assigned area. The Terminal near the Motor Pool was about 1.5 miles away, using the conventional route of sidewalks and roads. But being of the mindset to shorten that route, I decided to cut across the open fields that were less than conventional. Marveling at the night sky and the clarity with which I could see the stars, I then saw a sight that I could not help but wonder if it had something to do with all the other White Sands activity? Across the night sky came this streaking light without a sound and not much of a tail as would be associated with a meteor. It moved from my right to left and was moving at a rate of speed that I could not gauge, but I can say that it was moving faster than any aircraft that I had seen in my short 19-year life. What set this moving light apart from anything that I had ever seen was the fact that as fast as it was streaking across the night sky, suddenly without slowing its speed, it made a 90-degree turn upward and within a flash, it disappeared into infinity. \"I was completely stunned at what I saw and when I met with the Ft. Bliss soldier, I was stumbling all over my words trying to express what I had seen. I was met with disbelief when I told some other in the unit, including a couple of commissioned officers. Whether or not my story was believed or not, it was mighty coincidental that I suddenly found myself on an overseas levy (the only person shipped from my unit) and wound up in Italy.\" 12) USAF Fighter Wing Moved from Hawaii to Fly Patrol Over Alamogordo, NM \"I served in the U. S. Air Force from 1947 to 1951 as an enlisted man. In 1949, I was stationed in Hawaii with the 81st Fighter Wing of the 7th Air Force. In the summer of 1949, the entire Fighter Wing was shipped back to the states. All the aircraft, P-47s, were left at Wheeler Field on Oahu. \"The Fighter Wing was being transferred to Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque. Kirtland had been in moth balls since the end of the war. We reactivated that base. The 81st Fighter Wing received the first jet fighter planes (F-86s) issued to the Air Force. \"I never thought of it then, but over the years since I have often wondered why the (Pentagon) moved our whole Fighter Wing of maybe 2,000 or 3,000"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"troops and 90 fighter pilots clear across the Pacific Ocean and set up new operations at Kirtland? We had first been ordered to move to Selfridge Field AFB, Michigan. We had already stenciled Selfridge on our footlockers. The decision higher up to change destinations was late in coming. \"The word on the base was always, 'Our mission is to fly patrol over Alamogordo.' But thinking back on it, questions arise: If you need a fleet of fighter planes to patrol an air space, where and what is the threat? Who was patrolling the pl ace before we got the assignment? \"One year later in 1950, the whole Fighter Wing was shipped out to Moses Lake AFB, Washington. Once again we reactivate an Air Force Base which had been mothballed at the end of WWII. Our mission there, we were told, was to 'fly patrol for the Hanford atomic energy site.' I was discharged there in 1951. The Fighter Wing was still intact, fulfilling its mission.\" M ilitary voices continued in Part 3.
