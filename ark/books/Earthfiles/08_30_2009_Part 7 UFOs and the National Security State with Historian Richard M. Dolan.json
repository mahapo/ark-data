See More Information below to order. R eturn to Part 1 August 30, 2009 Rochester, New York - The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence (MoD) on August 17, 2009, released its second batch of 800 UFO documents in 4,000 pages. The MoD's first UFO files release was in 2008, and the third expected release will be next year in 2010. The MoD says it has now released all of its December 1980 RAF Bentwaters UFO files, along with a summary to the media generally reported this way: “The U. K.’s Ministry of Defence could offer no definitive explanation for what the U. S. Air Force officers had reported seeing, but also found ‘no evidence of any threat to the defence of the United Kingdom.’ Nothing had registered on radar and there was no evidence of anything having intruded into U. K. air space and landed near RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge.” Yet, only two months before on June 25, 2009, Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.), the Deputy Base Commander at RAF Bentwaters in December 1980 during all the UFO phenomenon, spoke on the record in a press release: [ See previous Earthfiles Parts 1-6. ] “... I believe the objects that I saw at close quarter were extraterrestrial in origin and that the security services of both the United States and England were and have been complicit in trying to subvert the significance of what occurred at Rendlesham by use of well-practiced methods of disinformation.” Not long after Col. Halt and the U. K. Ministry of Defence made these public releases - which seem contradictory - the second volume of an important trilogy by historian Richard M. Dolan, UFOs and the National Security State: The Cover-Up Exposed, 1973 - 1991 © 2009, was also released that includes a section about the December 1980 RAF Bentwaters UFO phenomenon that reinforces Col. Halt's conclusion that the incident was “ extraterrestrial in origin.” Richard Dolan took ten years to produce the first two volumes of UFOs and the National Security State. The third volume is expected in late 2010. The energy behind his decade-long work was first provoked by his astonishment about so much hidden history described in the book, Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Cover-up © 1994 by "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Timothy Good. Rich Dolan said he began to sneak books about UFOs into his college history and political classes at the University of Rochester. Richard told me, “I got to the point where I would be going into the university and hiding my UFO books almost like a guy would hide a man's magazine in the university! (laughs) I would not want anyone to see I had a UFO book.” Richard Dolan was born July 1, 1962, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Brentwood, Long Island, where he graduated from high school in 1980. Four years later he had earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature with a minor in philosophy from Alfred University in western New York after spending a portion of his junior year in 1983 studying political ideologies at Exeter College in Oxford University, England. Ten years later, he had earned two Masters of Arts degrees in history (1986) and American history and U. S. diplomacy (1995) from the University of Rochester. So, how did the budding historian switch from serious war history to one of the most politically controversial subjects on Earth: unidentified flying objects? He got into an argument with one of his professors about the merits of a book entitled Case Closed © 1993 by Gerald Posner about the 1963 President Kennedy assassination. Rich Dolan gave reasons why the book did not add up and why the truth about the assassination appeared to be covered up. When the professor accused Rich Dolan of being a “conspiracy theorist,” Rich realized that even academics were not objective, that professors did not cross certain political lines in order to have research grants and achieve tenure. Suddenly, Rich Dolan knew he did not want to be trapped in superimposed paradigms and that what he most wanted to understand and research was the long, complex, controversial history of the global UFO phenomena. Richard Dolan self-published this new second volume to maintain control on the content and below in More Information is a hot link to his Keyhole website for orders of his important book. Since the second volume has been released around the same time as Col. Halt's extraterrestrial statement about RAF Bentwaters and the MoD release of more UFO files that do not contain the truly sensitive and highly classified RAF Bentwaters documents and photographs, I asked Rich why the MoD would try to window dress a superficial release of UFO files as complete when they are not? Interview: R ichard M. Dolan, Historian and author of 3-volume UFOs and the National Security State, Rochester, New York Richard Dolan, Historian and Author, UFOs and the National Security State © 2000 and 2009, Rochester, New York: “The MoD, going back to the 1970s and 1980s, has always obfuscated, not clarified, the issue of UFOs and the MoD’s relationship to it. And let me add something else here about Col. Charles Halt and the whole issue of defense significance regarding the Rendlesham case of 1980. In my new book, Vol. 2 of UFOs and the National Security State, I’ve got a fairly long piece on the Rendlesham case. It includes an account I received from fellow researcher, Peter Robbins, who with former RAF Bentwaters 1st Class Airman Larry Warren, wrote a 1997 book on Rendlesham, Left At East Gate. Peter and Larry interviewed Charles Halt about fifteen years ago in 1994, and according to Peter Robbins, Halt admitted to them privately that the beams of light from the UFO that night (December 28, 1980) somehow penetrated the alternating layers of steel, earth and concrete of the hardened bunkers, which had nuclear weapons there at the time. So, fifteen years ago, Col. Halt told them that the beams reached the secure areas where the weapons were stored and that would adversely affect the ordnance. THAT COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS ANY ASSERTION BY THE MoD NOW THAT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THERE WAS NO ‘EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING HAVING INTRUDED INTO U. K. AIRSPACE AND LANDED NEAR RAF WOODBRIDGE.’ Clearly! Back at that time, Lord Hill-Norton was involved – he was one of the top military legends of Britain – he was calling for a better investigation of the Rendlesham case. What he had said was that if this is of no defense significance, it’s either one or the other. Either something unknown landed in a secure area where it was not supposed to go, some unknown object; or conversely, the U. S. military personnel who were there were under some kind of psychological delusion that it would be so serious that it would have to be of defense significance. So, Lord Hill-Norton’s argument was it’s one or the other and there is no way that cannot be of defense significance, clearly. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Admiral of the Fleet Peter John Hill-Norton, Baron Hill-Norton GCB (February 8, 1915-May 16, 2004) was Chief of the Defence Staff of the United Kingdom and Chairman of the NATO Military Committee. He was known as an outspoken advocate on the importance of sea power and a strong defense for Britain. Though a traditionalist by nature, he also believed in modernization, taking the brave decision to abolish the Royal Navy's traditional daily rum ration. In later years he took an interest in UFOs, which included writing about them and asking questions in Parliament ]. SINCE THIS GOES RIGHT TO THE HEART OF EVERYTHING IN YOUR BOOK AND BASICALLY TO THE HEART OF BENTWATERS, I WOULD LIKE TO READ BRIEFLY FROM THE JUNE 25, 2009, PRESS RELEASE BY GARY HESELTINE, THE SCRIPT WRITER IN COLLABORATION WITH RETIRED USAF COL. CHARLES I. HALT. THESE ARE COL. HALT’S OWN WORDS. Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.), June 25, 2009 press release: ‘I wish to make it perfectly clear that the UFOs that I saw were structured machines moving under intelligent control and operating beyond the realm of anything I have ever seen before or since. I believe the objects that I saw at close quarter were extraterrestrial in origin and that the security services of both the United States and England were, and have been, complicit in trying to subvert the significance of what occurred at Rendlesham by use of well-practiced methods of disinformation.’ Richard Dolan: Yes, that’s a very, very strong statement indeed. What I have argued in this new book is trying to understand the structure of power and secrecy itself. This is always a difficult thing to do because none of us researchers are in on the decision making process to clamp down on this. But what has happened is over 60 years, we’ve had this massively important UFO phenomenon that a number of people have known about and decided this is too important to share with the rest of the world. One obvious reason, it seems to me, is that they are hiding not simply the reality of another intelligence here on this planet, but actually the possession of certain hardware that they obtained somehow in their possession – whether through crash retrievals or some version of hand-me-downs (from the non-humans). But the power structure got some technology, I believe – this is what the evidence points to – that was so exotic that they realized they could not possibly want to share this with the rest of the world at this time (1940s). After all, in circa 1950, there was a Cold War going on, there were concerns in the United States over Soviet espionage of stealing atomic secrets and so forth. If the United States did not want to share atomic technology, clearly we must assume that the United States elite did not want to share something as exotic as alien technology. So, what would they do? Well, I think what logically they would do is gather together a team of top individuals to decide how technology gets passed off to private industry for research? Another person decides how bad the public panic might be. Another person might be in charge of understanding who these other beings might be. And so forth. I think this is exactly what happened. It might not have been a decision by Harry Truman that this secrecy would last forever. It could very well have been a case where he might think, ‘Let’s discuss this and re-visit this in a few years and decide at that time what our strategy will be.’ But the problem with the secret like this is that it develops its own momentum, its own profitability. It becomes, in a sense, the goose that lays golden eggs because you’ve got this technology that eventually certain genius scientists are going to study these materials"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"long enough, they might not be able to replicate it exactly, but they might get some very nice ideas such as improvements on integrated circuits, or development of laser technology or high tensile fibers or what have you. Their incentive then becomes nil for wanting to give this secret up. They have no incentive. Forgetting the topic of UFOs for a moment, let’s just look at the structure of power in the world in general. What we can see is a silent transformation of the structure of power in which privately dominated groups have gotten their hooks into public structures, into public institutions. This is exactly what has happened within the UFO topic. The secret has gone private. It’s not so much classified any longer as it is proprietary. That makes the secrecy even more profound. Individuals who work in government come out of private finance and industry and they go back to that world when they are done. It’s a revolving door. So, for example, if I as a 4-star general were to work with you, a major defense contractor, and we share this technology and your corporation holds on to this technology, when I (general) retire, I get hired as a Sr. Vice President and make a lot of money and we’ve got all these ground floor investment opportunities. So, that’s how the world of non-UFOs and the world of UFOs works! Secrecy has twisted and transformed our world in such a profound way. Keeping the secret has involved a tremendous amount of money. For example, let us assume there is a Research and Development program in place to study this alien technology. Well, clearly it has to be hidden from Congress. It’s got to be hidden from every form of legal structure that we have here so it can maintain its secrecy. And indeed, I was told by one very well-placed source that the cost of physical security in all its aspects, securing the secret, was seven to eight times the amount of actual scientific research and development. Why Such Strict Policies of Denial About Non-Humans Interacting with Earth? WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE IS THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR WHY THERE SEEMS NOW TO BE A PERPETUATION OF A POLICY OF DENIAL ABOUT SOMETHING SO FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT WE’RE NOT ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE AND THERE ARE OTHER INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH THIS PLANET? My own opinion is that there are many layers and levels of why this secret is so profoundly important to them. But one practical one, I think, is that – just as you say, it is such a fundamental truth. By revealing this truth – if the current U. S. President Barack Obama were to say that UFOs are real and apparently alien, this is not something where he can make his statement and then just go away. There is going to be massive follow up and investigation of that reality. One of the obvious questions that is going to come up no matter how brain dead and comatose the U. S. media as a rule has been – there is something that is unavoidable and that unavoidable question is how the hell did the U. S. media miss this for 60 years? And how did the U. S. and global academic communities miss this for 60 years? Investigating those questions – that’s only the tip of the iceberg, but that gets into a complete array of illegality and manipulation of what are supposed to be institutions that answer to the people. So, that’s one thing right off the bat. In other words, it’s a lie. The truth is so fundamental that the lie has had to be just as fundamental to deal with it. Now, there might be something even more profound behind this. We do have, after all, the presence of other intelligences that are here. Who are these other beings? Are they here to help us? Are they here to hinder us? Is it a bunch of factions that are out there? Are we, in fact, in the midst of a silent cold war and don’t even know about it? There could be a lot of things that if the public were to know might be seen as de-stabilizing, at least in terms of the current political structure. That’s always something that’s important. BUT IF DE-STABILIZATION IS ALWAYS THE ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF AUTHORITIES IN GOVERNMENTS, THEN DOESN’T IT MEAN THAT THOSE IN AUTHORITY WILL ALWAYS BE PERPETUATING A POLICY OF DENIAL INTO THE FUTURE AS FAR AS THEY CAN GO BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT TO DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES? Absolutely! ONCE YOU SEE THAT, YOU SAY, ‘WE ARE ON A PLANET THAT IS LIVING A"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PERPETUAL LIE.’ I think one other reason for why this is such an important secret for them to keep has to do with short term – I’m guessing 20 to 30 years – economic repercussions. For instance, let’s assume that the UFO secret comes out some how. So, we’re going to be asking: what is the power plant of these flying saucers? They are obviously using something really nifty – better than our petroleum. So, whatever it is, whether it’s energy from the vacuum of space or some other source that’s phenomenally impressive – that will do things to the petroleum industry. Then there is the electronics industry and the steel industry. You can go on and on here. You can argue that in the long term, properly handled, these new technologies would be a revolutionary benefit to mankind and the world. You can certainly make that case. But in the short term, alien technology would portend to be very economic de-stabilizing. Who knows what would come out the other end of all this? I think disclosure will bring a great deal of uncertainty. I’m sure those individuals who have their grip around the tail of this tiger, they know if they let go, there’s a lot of unpredictability up ahead and I don’t think they want that. They want control. WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO LEVERAGE OPEN THE TRUTH ABOUT NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH THE PLANET, NO MATTER WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES, LETTING THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY MAY? Well, I believe there’s a paradox here. Releasing the UFO secret is both impossible and also inevitable. It’s really both. It’s impossible in the sense that I’ve been saying that there is no motivation for those secret-holders to give it up. No motivation that I can see. However, the fact that we are living in the most revolutionary period in all of human history. There is nothing that comes close to the period of time we’re in right now. Anyone listening to this had better understand how blessed and cursed and lucky and whatever they are to be living right now because any other time in human history does not compare to what we’re in right now. We’re on a tightrope. If we get to the other side of this tightrope, we’re going to be in for the wildest ride. We’re in the midst of such technological innovation and change and transformation. We’re going to have intelligent computers common probably in less than another generation. We are in the process of probably reinventing who we are biologically. We’ve cracked the human genetic code. We are, in other words, on the verge of re-inventing ourselves. It’s a significant, major event. So, what I believe is that at the end of this process in another 20 to 30 years at the most, our society is going to look so completely different than what it does now. Think about what we’ve gone through in the last 20 years where we go from basically no internet to a world of absolute, total connectivity in which in your hand you can carry a little piece of machinery that can contain entire libraries of data and music and video archives (laughs) and online streaming and everything else in your little hand. So, in a century, we’ve gone from horses pulling carts to the world we have now. So, we’re not going to stop. Clearly, in such a revolutionary, unstable, transformative period, I am convinced that something is going to happen. I don’t know what the trigger will be, but something is going to happen that’s going to force this issue out into the open. Why Don't Non-Humans Present Themselves Publicly Beyond Government Denials? RICH, WHY DO YOU THINK THERE HAS NOT BEEN STRAIGHTFORWARD NON-HUMANS PUTTING THEMSELVES DOWN IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES IN BOTH HEMISPHERES IN THE LAST 200 TO 300 YEARS? Well, this is a great question. Unfortunately, all I can do is speculate based on the history of sightings and encounters that I know about. One thing I know is that there is a long history of confrontation between our military as well as militaries of other nations – confrontations between militaries and these UFOs. In other words, there are attempted jet interceptions. There are occasionally cases where jets have fired missiles at these UFO objects. We know this happened. We have the documents to prove it."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, there has been trouble in Paradise, so to speak. That’s one issue – like who are the good guys here? (laughs) It’s hard to say. Are they the good guys or the bad guys? But there is some form of confrontation going on. This is something that any kind of true disclosure of UFOs must confront. Why do our Earth militaries seem to be fighting Them? I don’t know the answer to that. It certainly could be that They are observing us. Here is what I’m quite sure to say. We’re at a point in our history in which we must be intensely interesting to Them – and by ‘Them,’ I mean any intelligence, any group, that has the ability to come to look at Earth right now! Our species has probably been in Their world all along, but we’ve been asleep. But now, we’re at a point in our history where we are about to leap into their world. We are about to wake up. They must know this. I cannot see any scenario in which the non-human intelligences don’t know this. So, my feeling is that there is going to be an announcement, some kind of event, I would predict within twenty years from now. I have friends and colleagues in this field who think it’s going to be much sooner than that, but I think 20 years is a reasonable guess. Why they haven’t done it up until now, the only thing I can point to is perhaps the possibility of excessive social disruption. Or the non-human fear of social disruption by the human power groups. But why the E.T. or alien groups haven't appeared out front and public, that’s something I don’t know. “Entities Not of Our Human Civilization” I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO A PARAGRAPH FROM YOUR BOOK AND SENTENCE, ‘BY 1990, IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SOME UFOS WERE OPERATED BY ENTITIES NOT OF OUR HUMAN CIVILIZATION.’ I AM CURIOUS, AFTER TEN YEARS OF WORKING ON THESE TWO LARGE AND IMPORTANT VOLUMES, WHAT HAS CONVINCED YOU THE MOST THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH ENTITIES NOT OF OUR HUMAN CIVILIZATION? You go all the way back to the 1940s and 1950s and we’re dealing with reports of technology that is as inexplicable today as it was back then. Objects that did zigzags in the sky near military bases. AND 90-DEGREE ANGLES. Exactly! In the 1940s and could stop in mid-air and take off with instant acceleration. Now, I’d like to know what can do that? And guess what? So did American intelligence analysts. They wanted to know. They looked into this matter in the 1940s and 1950s and 1960s and 1970s and they never stopped looking at it. And periodically, reports would leak out and we know that reports came out in the 1940s that said, ‘This appears to be an interplanetary phenomenon.’ That was the phrase that they used back then. And in the 1950s, the issue again came to a head with many analysts concluding that this was an extraterrestrial phenomenon and so on through the years. My feeling is that this cannot be explainable as simply Deep Black technology. If it is, we all would need to know: Why are jets chasing them for sixty years?! (laughs) Right? It’s one thing to say we’re testing your defenses, OK? But for 60 years?! Let’s get real here. You know, there is evidence that the phenomenon involves non-human entities because we have an enormous mass of witness testimony. People who said, ‘I was taken by beings that were not human.’ We’ve got a lot of that. There’s at least something there to delve into and researchers have done this. So, to just say it’s classified technology – this is absurd! There’s so much more going on here. Tehran, Iran, September 19, 1976 And the data leads, in my view, to an extraterrestrial phenomenon. There’s one UFO case – it’s a famous one and deservedly so that has never left my consciousness as possibly the most significant UFO case that we have. It’s not the Rendlesham case, although I think that’s right up there. The case I’m thinking of would be the 1976 Iranian jet fighter incident that took place over the city of Tehran, Iran. This was back in the days of the Shah when Iran was an ally of the United States. And the reason that I feel this is such a critically important case and that I think any skeptical person who looks into this case is really going to think twice. The reason is that the case"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"itself is utterly spectacular in that we have U. S. defense intelligence agency documents describing in detail two F-4 fighter interceptor fighters in a row scrambled by the Iranian air force sent into investigate an object that the whole city of Tehran was looking at. This bright object displaying all kinds of bizarre lights coming out of it. In this case, that light phenomenon disabled the electronic systems of the F-4 fighter jets as they approached at a range of 25 nautical miles. In one case, the pilot was literally on the verge of pressing a button to fire a missile at the object when his missile system went off line.” September 19, 1976, Tehran, Iran C ylinder-Shaped UFO Interacts with Two F-4 Jets One of the best documented UFO-aircraft incidents, when a UFO was observed flying over the restricted airspace of Tehran, Iran. Two U.S.-made F-4 Phantom II jet fighters of the Imperial Iranian Air Force were scrambled, but as the pilots closed in on the target, their communications and weapons systems were suddenly jammed. The incident was confirmed by high ranking officers of the Iranian Air Force and later documented by several agencies of the U.S. military. During the early morning hours of September 19, 1976, a cylinder-shaped unidentified aerial object that gave a radar return the size of “a 707 tanker,” hovered over Tehran, the capital of Iran. The object was recorded on radar and seen by many eyewitnesses on the ground and by the pilots of two American-made F-4 Phantom II jet interceptors flown by Imperial Iranian Air Force. As the pilots approached the UFO, their instrumentation and communications failed. One of the jets prepared to fire a missile at the UFO, but its electronic weapons system suddenly jammed. The incident is documented in a now-declassifed October 1976 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) message with a distribution list that included the White House, Secretary of State, Joint Chiefs of Staff, National Security Agency (NSA), and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Various high-ranking Iranian military officers directly involved with the events have also gone on public record stating their belief that the object was not terrestrial in origin."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A n F-4 Phantom II jet fighter plane.

The pilot of the first jet interceptor, Yaddi Nazeri, estimated that the UFO was traveling somewhere between 2,000 mph and 3,000 mph. He said that the object “...was beyond my speed and power. The [second] F-4... also could not catch up to the object. That's when I thought, this is a UFO.” Nazeri added that “...no country had this type of flying object, so I was thinking this craft is from another planet.” The second F-4 pilot, General Parviz Jafari, said that after trying to fire a missile and failing, they feared for their lives and tried to eject, but the eject button also malfunctioned. At a Washington D.C. press conference on November 12, 2007, Jafari added details that the main object emitted four objects, one which he tried unsuccessfully to fire on, another which followed him back, and one which landed on the desert floor and glowed. Following his prepared statement at the press conference, Jafari was asked if he believed he had encountered an alien spacecraft and Pirouzi said he was quite certain that he had. General Nader Yousefi, the assistant deputy commander of the Iranian Air Force, said he ordered the two jet interceptions. He said that, “Because of the experience I had on September 19, 1976, I believe there is something up there. We just don't know what it is or where it came from.” Yousefi repeated many of the details of the encounter already recorded in the DIA document, but also added a few more. Yousefi said that after the second F-4 lost its communications and weapons systems and took evasive maneuvers, it tried one last pursuit of the UFO. Even approaching at Mach 2, the UFO easily out-distanced it. The pilots decided to return to Mehrabad airport. As they were approaching to land, Yousefi said the control tower phoned him that the UFO was following the jet back to base. For more details, see: Wikipedia. Richard Dolan: “And we have further confirmation of this case through data from the DSP satellite system, Defense Support Program. This is a U. S. military program that has a series of geosynchronous satellites in place, one of which detected a UFO over the city of Tehran at exactly the time and date of the incident. In other words, we have a separate confirmation. This is something I’ve included in my book. And then you’ve got an event that we have to explain. What object in 1976 can disable the electronic systems of what were then some of the top-of-the-line, best fighter jets in the world. F-4s were outstanding in their day. Could anyone honestly say that the Soviet Union was playing games over Tehran, Iran, air space? No one seriously entertains that idea. So, if not the Soviets, then who? This is a question that any responsible military historian has to look at, but they have ignored it for 33 years, since 1976, this case has been ignored by conventional mainstream historians and analysts. BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS WITH INSIDE KNOWLEDGE DID NOT WANT MEDIA OR RESEARCHERS TO PAY IMPORTANT ATTENTION TO A CASE THAT WOULD PROVE NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE OVER TEHRAN. Absolutely! This is technology that, no matter how you look at it, is revolutionary. What can do such a thing in 1976? That’s an incredible event. How Long Can Political Lies Go On? IN THIS NEW GLOBAL STRUCTURE OF POWER, LIES AND POLICIES OF DENIAL ARE WHAT SUPPORT THE STRUCTURE. HOW LONG CAN THIS GO, HOW LONG COULD THIS PLANET SUSTAIN SUCH A HUGE, GLOBAL LIE WHEN THERE ARE ALL THESE OTHER FORCES OF TRUTH THAT ARE PUSHING AGAINST THE POWER STRUCTURE OF LIES? That is the $64,000 question. How long can it go? And the thing that I ask myself frequently is: Is one outcome inevitable over another? So, is it inevitable that the global structure will impose a global totalitarian system? Or is it inevitable that the forces of freedom will prevail? My feeling is that this is a struggle that is not over. It’s not done. We can see that the lines"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"have been drawn. There is a major push to create a global police state. That’s underway. Anyone who is not seeing it is not looking. But there is also – it’s not hard to see the other side either. There are many millions of people who see the truth and they are speaking out and they are fighting. So, where this will end up? I don’t know. I think the other factor that is going to play into this is our ever-evolving technological revolution that is going on right now. People in Tehran we just heard all about how Twitter was transforming the nature of the Iranian government’s handling of the recent election there and all the riots that were going on. AND ISN’T IT HUGELY IRONIC THAT THE COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY IN ITS SPEED OF EVOLUTION SINCE THE 1940S ONWARD IS PROBABLY TIED DIRECTLY TO THE RETRIEVAL OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY OUT OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT. My feeling is that the possession of alien technology gave us quite a bit of a boost. If and when something goes down - if and when a U. S. President makes an official disclosure statement, we need to remember that this is not necessarily a full or even truthful disclosure. We have to remember this!” R eturn to Part 1 More Information: UFOs and the National Security State , a 3-volume history by Richard M. Dolan. Vo l .
