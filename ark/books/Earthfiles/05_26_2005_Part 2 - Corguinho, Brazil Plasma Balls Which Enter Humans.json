Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 2 - Corguinho, Brazil: Plasma Balls Which Enter Humans © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe Return to Part 1 May 26, 2005 Corguinho, Brazil - One of the persistent mysteries over the decades in Corguinho, Brazil, have been glowing white or gold lights about 3 to 4 feet in diameter which residents have seen rise out of the ground or come out of the big mesa which dominates the farmland. I have interviewed eyewitnesses there who have watched the lights move around in the sky and go back into the mesa or into the ground. Exactly what the source of the lights are and what they do when they emerge is unknown. But Urandir Oliveira, his family, the Felipe Branco family and many others have also seen what they call \"plasma balls.\" And nine months ago in September 2004, while Felipe Branco was visiting Urandir Oliveira at the Corguinho farm, Felipe had his own firsthand encounter with one of the lights. Digital video frames of \"plasma ball\" in September 2004, as light suddenly appeared and moved over half a dozen campers laying down at the Urandir Oliveira farm, Corguinho, Brazil. Some people described a sensation of heat as the light allegedly entered and exited their feet. Video courtesy Felipe Branco. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview: Felipe Branco, Castelo Branco Ltd., Campo Grande, Mato Grosso Do Sul, Brazil : \"I did this by myself and I could see it coming and entering my body and I could feel this amazing heat! COULD YOU DESCRIBE YOUR PERSONAL STORY STARTING FROM WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT BEFORE THE LIGHT? I was laying down face down. And I was wearing sun glasses. This was around 1 a.m. in the night, 1 o'clock in the morning. Urandir told me I could look at it, that there was no problem because you must wear sunglasses. If you don't wear sunglasses, it could hurt your eyes. So, he put sunglasses on me and I was laying face down and Urandir said, 'I'll tell you when it's about to materialize, he ball. Then you turn your face back up again. It was coming from my back.' Then Urandir said, 'OK, he's going to come now.' And I turned and I looked at it. But it was a golden ball that appeared out of nothing, around the same size of 1 meter or maybe 1.5 meters, making the strange hissing noise. It was flying in leaps and then it diminished and entered my feet. But you could see it. In the footage, you can see the light half inside my feet and half inside my leg. It's like half of the ball was inside and half was outside. And it was coming up my leg and then entered my lower back all the way to my neck and it entered my body and disappeared. WHAT DID THAT FEEL LIKE? It felt like a great heat. AND NO TELEPATHIC THOUGHTS? Yes, there were no telepathic, but I had a lot of visions. I had like a flood of images very fast. I was aware of them and they were moving very fast. It was like a film in fast forward. WHAT WERE THE IMAGES? I was seeing scenes that looked like Egypt. There were pyramids, but they were not of rocks. They were of metal, a gold metal. Huge. I saw three pyramids, but they were metallic. I was in this room and I could see myself in this big room, marble type of stone. There were some strange lambs there and people dressed with a lot of gold, necklaces and things. The idea was Egypt, but not like we see in history. Tutankhamun's golden mask is 24 pounds of solid gold, inlaid lapis lazuli, quartz, turquoise, carnelian, obsidian and colored glass. The Pharaoh rested inside three golden coffins. Two were made of wood with a golden overlay, the third was made from 296 pounds of solid gold, now at Cairo museum. WHAT IMPRESSION WERE YOU LEFT WITH - WERE THEY TRYING TO SHOW YOU THAT THIS IS WHERE THEY ARE FROM OR THEY WERE INVOLVED IN EGYPT? The impression was that Egypt is a lot older than we think it is and that in early Egypt, they were present there. The ETs were interacting openly with the people there, as if the early Egyptian civilization was extraterrestrial. That is the impression that came in. The Egypt of Tutankhamun and people then was already something near to our time, about 3,000 years ago. The impression was the images the ETs showed me was 25,000 to 30,000 years ago, that's the impression. [ Editor's Note: Tutankhamun (alternate transcription Tutankhamen), named Tutankhaten early in his life, was Pharaoh of the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1334"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BC/1333 BC - 1323 BC), during the period known as the New Kingdom. His original name Tutankhaten means \"Living Image of Aten\" while Tutankhamun means \"Living Image of Amun.\"] AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL. Ye s . ANY IMPRESSION ABOUT WHY THEY WERE SHOWING THE IMAGES TO YOU IN THE FALL OF 2004? Yes, because remember I told you about my first encounter (with tall red-haired entities in 1968 - See: 122102Earthfiles ). They said they were going to wake me up. They were going to help me remember past reincarnations, something like that. They said they are going to help us remember so we see that history is not as we told. History is very different. We are supposed to pass on this information, but I'm not sure. It's real, but at the same time so abstract. It's very hard to talk about it with certainty and saying it's 100% like this. WHEN YOU WERE HAVING THE IMAGES FLASH THROUGH YOUR MIND LIKE A MOVIE, DID YOU ALSO HAVE SENSE OF SOUND AND SCENT AND PRESSURE, ALL IN THAT MOVIE? Oh, yes. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE HERE IN THE MILITARY HAVE DESCRIBED WHEN THEY SAY THEY'VE HAD TELEPATHIC ENCOUNTERS WITH BEINGS AND THEY DESCRIBE THE MOVIE DOWNLOADS. NOW, YOU HAD INTERACTIONS WITH TALL RED-HAIRED BEINGS. Red hair, yes, with freckles! DID YOU RELATE THE TALL RED-HAIRS TO THE PARTICULAR LIGHT THAT WAS ENTERING YOU IN CORGUINHO? No, I did not. WHAT DO YOU ASSOCIATE THE LIGHT WITH? The Egyptian images because they remain so strong in my mind. DO YOU THINK THE TALL RED-HAIRS WERE INVOLVED WITH THE EGYPTIANS? The impression I have is that there is a group of races that have been working together. And these tall red ones are involved in this group. WHO DO YOU THINK, AT AN INTUITIVE LEVEL, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLASMA BALLS COMMUNICATING WITH YOU ALL (IN CORGUINHO)? I think it's a machine guided by someone who is inside a spaceship up in the air? I don't know. That's the impression I have. And I asked Urandir if he had information and he said, 'Yes, this is like a remote-controlled device that they use to work our energy to increase our vibrational energy, to increase the electrical charge of our cells, that sort of thing, so that we are better prepared for contact face-to-face.\" More Information: Tall Red-Haired Beings in Pillpinto, Peru When I was in Peru in June 1987, I heard about tall beings with copper red hair, crystal blue eyes, and very white skin that were seven to eight feet tall, or taller. The man who told me about them was an archaeology student whose father worked as a traveling nurse in the rural areas of Peru. Edwin Flores told me that his father had traveled in 1981 to a remote village called Pillpinto, six hours by car from Cuzco. When he returned, he asked his son why \"very tall Irish people\" were living in the rugged mountains. His father explained that he had seen them at the outskirts of the village. Flores said his father had not been back since 1981 and he didn't know if the \"tall Irish\" were still there. I proposed that we go to Pillpinto and find out. It was a difficult road, climbing most of the time, with hairpin turns. We were stopped twice by security police. I didn't learn until later that we were driving right toward one of the hide-outs of the Communist-inspired rebels known as the \"Shining Path\" who had been"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"blowing up trains and buildings in Peru. Flores explained to the police that I was an American documentary filmmaker and writer investigating information about extraterrestrial phenomena and that we were looking for \"tall Irish\" living near Pillpinto. We were surprised when the police said. \"Si!\" They knew about the red-haired people. At the outpost closest to Pillpinto, two policemen pointed up into the sky and told about a large, round, bright object that had landed on top of one of the mountains. The police said they had climbed up there and if we did, too, we could still see the \"burned oval\" where the light landed. The police estimated it would take a day to reach the site. I was tempted, but time was limited, and I wanted to at least see if the tall Irish people were still living in Pillpinto. So, we continued on to the village. When we stopped, our car was surrounded by dozens of children. When Flores explained why I was there, the children began pointing toward houses. He said the children knew about the tall, red-haired people and would take us to a man who knew about them. My heart began to beat faster as we walked toward the door of a small, adobe home, preceded by the laughter and chatter of the children who surrounded us. The sun was setting and in the twilight shadows, I asked myself what I was going to do if I actually found myself in front of an eight foot, red-haired being from another world. Flores knocked and the door opened. In front of us stood a man about five-foot-four with clear blue eyes, like \"clear water,\" as Felipe Branco described the clear green eyes of the tall, red-haired beings he has encountered in Brazil. There were copper-red patches in his dark, brown hair. I asked Flores if he could find out where the man's parents were. After a long answer in Spanish, Flores said, \"His parents live in that house over there. Nothing unusual. But he knows about the 'tall Irish.' He says they used to live outside the village and have moved on. He said there is another man here who knew them.\" We walked further surrounded by the children. Flores knocked on the second door. Another man answered and his eyes were clear blue, too. He also had copper patches in his dark hair. He knew about the red-haired people, but said they didn't live there anymore. He did not know where they had come from, either, or where they had gone. Sourc e: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe.
