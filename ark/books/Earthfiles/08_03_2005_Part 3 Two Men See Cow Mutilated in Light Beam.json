Drawing © by \"Howard.\" Return to Part 1 August 3, 2005 Orlando, Florida - [ Editor's Note: Since the beginning of the human abduction syndrome investigations in the 1960s, there have often been descriptions of sexual activity forced on humans by the abductors as an egg or sperm collecting procedure. Others who have interacted with the \"standing up reptiles\" say the sexual activities of those creatures are for self-gratification, as Howard describes in the following Part 3 and 4. ] Part 3 - Inte rvie w with \"Howard,\" Compute r Network Administrator, Orlando, Florida: \"That apparently happened because the soldier sniffed my 'awakeness,' if you would call it that. As soon as the soldier snorted and took a step toward me, the other one the scientist - kind of turned around at the same time and looked at me. The expression on the soldier's face was a quick fright, but then a more controlled look. But, the scientist was very agitated that I was awake and that I was getting off the table onto the center of the UFO floor. It had complete fear come across its face and the scientist jolted to the left. S cientist's frightened reaction at Howard's waking awareness. Rectangular 'clipboard' in left hand. Drawing © 2005 by Howard. When the soldier started to approach and when I saw the look of fright on both their faces, it was just instantaneous for me to think, 'Get on your feet! Something is going to happen.' So, I just got off the table, onto the floor between the two transparent tables and assumed the fighting position. This all happened in a matter of five seconds. The soldier was walking toward me and my attention focused on him. I got a good look on his eyes because we were staring at each other about three or four feet away. He started to approach me and assumed a fighting position with the hands up and slightly squatted down, approaching me slowly. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"L izard soldier moving into fighting stance in front of Howard. Star logo with flying serpent on clothing. Drawing © 2005 by Howard. I did the same. I put my hands up and squatted a little bit. At that point, I saw the activity on the left side with the scientist. So, I turned and called to my friend. In what couldn't have been more than a second or two, I looked over at him, yelled his name. At that point, his eyes opened and he became awake. Then, just as I turned my head back around to look at the soldier again, it decided to take a quick swipe at me with its tail. It hi t me j ust around the back right knee. And the scientist was going for something. Later, my friend who had been laying next to me (on the other transparent table) told me the scientist grabbed what looked like a square or rectangular remote control. When it pushed a button, it knocked me out. THE SOLDIER IS ON YOUR RIGHT. THE SCIENTIST IS ON YOUR LEFT. THE SCIENTIST HAS GRABBED SOMETHING THAT YOUR BUDDY ON THE OTHER TRANSPARENT TABLE THINKS LOOKS LIKE A SQUARE OR RECTANGULAR SHAPED REMOTE CONTROLLER. Right. DO YOU REMEMBER AS THE SOLDIER APPROACHED YOU IN A FIGHTING STANCE, IF YOU FELT ANY TINGLING OR ANY SENSATION COMING FROM THE LEFT FROM THE SCIENTIST? No, there was no feeling whatsoever. Except it reminded me of once I got knocked out when I was young and was hit by a soccer ball in the chest. It knocked all the wind out of me. I got tunnel vision and everything went black. I just saw a little speck of something. I could still hear for a few seconds, even though my eyes were closed and it was black. I was laying on the ground unconscious. I could still hear and my brain was still active for a few seconds. But on the UFO, I didn't feel anything and it was just like turning off a light. It w as that quick. As soon as the (energy) from the remote thing hit me, I had fallen on the floor. I didn't feel any pain, so I would imagine that the device immobilized my muscles and pain sensors at the same time. While I was still conscious for a few seconds, I felt my belt buckle being unbuckled - easily, like a human would unbuckle it very quickly and then pulled my pants down. BEFORE WE GO INTO THAT, COULD YOU PLEASE REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE SOLDIER THAT CAUSED ITS TAIL TO HIT YOU? As soon as I had stared at him for about 30 seconds and I saw him looking at the computer screen (with image of fat? tissue on screen), I pulled myself all the way up on the table. And then he smelled me and he made a snort, one quick breathe in. It had a quick snort sound. The other one, the scientist, heard the soldier snort and they both turned around and looked at me. Now as the soldier is looking at me, he starts to approach me one step. And one step was enough for me to see both of them and see that the soldier was coming toward me and I got off the table onto the middle of the UFO, stood on the floor with my own two feet. As the soldier was walking toward me, it put its hands up and squatted down a little bit. So, I did the same. I squatted down a little bit, but I didn't approach him. YOU'RE READY FOR A FIGHT. Ri ght. So me thi ng' s c o mi ng a t me a nd I' m go i ng i nto po s i ti on. So , i t' s r e fl e x. And the n I s a w the c o mmo ti o n o n the left and just at that point when I called over to my friend and said, 'Hey, wake up!' Then I turned back around and the thing (soldier) sucker punched me and it hit me with its tail by wrapping its tail around the back of my knee, slapping me. IT'S COMING AT YOU. IT'S IN FRONT OF YOU. IT HAS ITS ARMS RAISED. HOW DID THAT TAIL INTERACT WITH YOU? The lizard soldier and scientist had 3 or 4 foot long tails. In cross-section, the tails are about three to four inches in diameter at the base of the lizard's spine. Then at the very end of the tail, it's probably about a half-inch across. Both of the tails were about the same size, but the soldier's was a little bit thicker at the base. I'd say his was about 4.5 inches across. It's hard to describe, I guess, because you're wondering how this can happen?! But if the thing is about a foot"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"away from you and you're toe-to-toe with it and it has a 4-foot tail and it can arch that tail - well, it can make a half circle around your body and hit you in back just by a simple twist of its pelvis, which is what it did. It twisted its left hip and hit the back of my right leg with its tail. It never hit me with its hand. But I wasn't even watching the tail! I didn't even expect it. Of all the things that you would normally think, that you would predict this is going to happen, that's probably going to happen next - just the normal kind of stuff that your human logic would say w hat was going to happen next. It NEVER EVER happened that way with those lizards! It was always something completely out of the blue. Even so much as facing off with this thing. It hit me with its tail and I completely was not expecting that. THAT MOVEMENT OF THE HIP BY THE LIZARD SOLDIER CAUSED THE TAIL TO LITERALLY CURL AROUND YOUR LEGS? It caught me around the one right leg. It didn't wrap completely around it. The tail tapped me on the back of my right leg, the flat part of my right calf. DID IT HURT? No, not at all. DID YOU FEEL TEMPERATURE LIKE HEAT OR COLD? Well, there was a point where it was touching the back of my neck and it felt cold. OK, YOU'RE STILL FACE-TO-FACE AND EYE-TO-EYE WITH THE SOLDIER CREATURE AND ITS TAIL HAS SLAPPED THE BACK OF YOUR RIGHT LEG? Right. Lizard Scientist Uses Machine to Make Howard Lose Consciousness L izard scientist had odd fleshy protrusions around its eyes, which the lizard soldier did not have. Drawing © 2005 by Howard. It was at this point that the scientist to the left aimed at me with the remote viewer that had a little button on it. My friend said it was a red button in the middle of it. No markings on it or anything. It was just a solid color grey (around the red button). I said square before, but it was actually rectangular. It had four corners and it was 6 inches long by 3 inches wide by 1/2 inch thick, like an old remote control, the thick ones. It was then that everything w ent black, but I could feel something unbuckling my belt. SO IT GOES BLACK. AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, YOU LITERALLY GO INTO UNCONSCIOUSNESS IMMEDIATELY? Except for the few seconds of being able to hear. WHAT DID YOU HEAR? I didn't hear anything. I could hear the ship and stuff like that, so I knew I could hear. But I didn't hear any other tones other than the whirling sound, a rushing of air sound around inside the UFO all the time. I didn't hear the lizard guys because they don't talk. All you hear is just a little tap, tap, tap (from their clawed feet) on the UFO floor. Before, (after being beamed up from seeing the cow mutilated in the beam), that's the sound I think initially woke me up inside the craft. When these things walk on the UFO's floor, it's like a dog's nails on tile. It goes tap, tap-tap-tap, tap, tap, tap-tap-tap. And I think that's what first woke me up because that was the first thing I noticed and thought, 'What the hell is that sound?' I w as looking for the source when I was waking up and got my eye opened a little. So, after the scientist used the remote, I did hear a tap, tap, tap over to me. Another thing to notice is that when I was trying to fight the soldier, I was looking directly at its eyes. And when I said you can't predict, I was expecting this thing because of the claws on its feet it has three toes much like a big dinosaur-type bird."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" E mus are large birds which have three, black-nailed toes. A similarly large bird, the cassowary, have been known to jump at people and tear open abdomens with their sharp claws. Images © by A. Readman. L eft: \"Here is what the soldier's hand looked like, as well as ( right ) a size comparison to my hand.\" I was expecting it to jump on me and try to gut my belly out with its claws. That's the first instinct I had. I wasn't expecting to be hit by the lizard's tail. Or at least I expected to be hit with its fingers because it has little claws on its fingers and it has tlittle claws on the feet. But the claws on the feet are shaped like a raptor's, a bird's talon, but thicker at the base and real pointed at the end of the talon and about an inch long. And black colored. So, at that point, I'm on the floor and I feel something unbuckling my belt and hear the tap, tap, tap of the claws and then I pass out. I have no memory. Howard Is Sodomized by Lizard Soldier Then I wake up again. And this time I'm back on the table, but facing the other direction and on all fours. And I notice that I'm being raped, sodomized by this thing, the soldier. I realized the lizard soldier was behind me and lifting me up with one arm. ARE YOU TOTALLY NUDE? HAVE ALL YOUR CLOTHES BEEN TAKEN OFF? Yes, at this point, I'm totally naked. ARE YOU FEELING TEMPERATURE FROM THE SOLDIER'S SKIN? It feels cold, but not as cold as a snake. Maybe in between. It was colder than me, but it wasn't like ice cold. It was a sensation I've never had before and it was very uncomfortable. I noticed the soldier's arm around my chest, holding me up. I looked forward and I realize I'm still in the UFO and I'm not out of the craziness yet. I turn around to see this thing behind me and I felt like I was just coming out of sleep. The device they used to knock me out, I think it shuts down certain parts of your nervous system, but not all. It's a very specific, detailed, structured thing, so you can have some movement of your own, some motor control, but I felt clumsy and weak, like your whole body has been asleep, but you don't have that tingling sensation. I was very weak. IS THE LIZARD SOLDIER THE ONE WHO IS PENETRATING YOUR RECTUM? Yes, like a male would penetrate a male. They had the parts. WHAT WAS THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE LIZARD'S PENIS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I couldn't tell you what the head looked like. But I can tell you what a few inches behind it was. It did not have a scrotum that hangs down with two balls as a male human does. They are all the way up along side the penis and there is no wrinkled skin tissue. It is totally flat skin, like on your arm or something. It was separated into two halves. There was a seam that ran down the middle. There are two testicles that are there - like a big bulge and there are two lines coming up on each side of the division that go all the way under the bottom of the penis. So, instead of mine having just one duct for semen, they have two. L izard soldier's erect penis beneath yellow fold of skin at base of yellow bony abdomen plates. Drawing © 2005 by Howard. Yellow, Bony Chest Plate This is when I can see him naked, while before he had clothes on. It had a bony plate, a yellow, ribbed plate, covering each pectoral muscle. You know how crocodiles have yellow bellies? Then, that bony chest plate tapers down like a 'T.' If you were you to draw a big 'T' on a man's chest - that was the shape of the plate. The plates are only about four inches wide in the \"six pack\" area (stomach muscles). So, they have a very narrow \"six pack,\" whereas ours is probably a good six to eight inches. Theirs was only four inches wide. WAS THE PLATE VERY HARD? Yes, totally hard. Like the bottom of a snake has rows of ribs or hard, glossy, plated scales. At the very bottom of where the \"six pack\" is, it goes all the way down and the pelvis area looks much like a jock strap. It's all yellow and the jock strap thing lifts up about two inches way from the lizard's body and there's a little bit of loose skin where the penis comes out from under that. So, the penis I would say is mostly up inside the body even during non-sexual times. I turned around and looked at this thing, as I realized what was happening. I said over and over again, 'I can't believe this is happening! I can't believe this is happening! I can't believe this is fucking happening!' When I turned around and looked at it, it was still holding me in the left arm, it took its right arm and leaned back and it was leaning back for that remote. At that point, I did see the dimensions of the soldier's body that I've been describing. It leaned back as if to go for the remote controller. Lizard Scientist Sodomizes Howard's Friend Then I decided I would turn around and what I was thinking about was, 'What should I do? One, I can turn around and attack this thing and hopefully get him. But I'm realizing now as I'm looking over at my buddy, the other lizard (scientist) is now just starting to penetrate my friend in a similar position, except he's laying all the way down on the table while I'm being held up in the air by the soldier. Then I decided to turn around and say something out loud to the soldier. My first impression was that they were animals. My second impression was that they were demon or Satan. I was a Christian at that time, so I decided I'd heard all the rhetoric to say certain things such as, 'In the name of Jesus, God help me! Satan get behind me!' When I said, 'Satan get behind me!', literally I had Satan behind me. And I started to laugh. I w ent into hysterics. I was laughing one minute, cracking jokes to myself. Just at that point, I turned around and said a joke to it. I said, 'Is this what you came here for? You came all the way here for this?' It just looked at me. Then it took its hand and turned my head back around so I was facing front and put my head down. Then I turned my head again and I started to curse at it. It again made like a little reach for the remote. So I turned back around again. Then I said, looking over at my friend once again who is awake and staring at me. So, I said his name, not thinking correctly. I was just concentrating on my friend's face. At that point, that was all I wanted to see. 'Help me! Do something!' And he goes, 'Why don't you look at me? Fucking help me!' At that point, it dawned on me what was happening to him. He said to me, 'Just go away to a safe place (in your mind), think about something happy and just go there and forget this. This is not even happening. That's what I'm doing.' So, I think in my head, 'OK, I can try to jump this thing, but if I don't get him, what's the other one (scientist) going to do to me? Knock me back out? Are they going to kill me this time? Then, too, I'm thinking, what if I do take this soldier guy out and take the other one out and could actually kill both of them? How do I get off the ship? Can I land this thing? Is there an auto return? Will it fly back to where it came from and I'd be stuck? Then they'd really be pissed off! So just a lot of weird things are flying through my mind. And to try to preserve my own life, I decided to take it. At that point, the soldier had made me ejaculate twice. Once when I was coming to from passing out from the remote control thing. And then again a few minutes later. HOW WAS THAT ACCOMPLISHED? IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU BECAME CONSCIOUS AND THE SOLDIER'S PENIS WAS IN YOUR RECTUM, WAS THERE PAIN? When I was coming to, it was uncomfortable and a little bit of pain and stinging. But it wasn't so"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"uncomfortable that my natural body's stimulation would not orgasm. But it was very quick. WAS THE SOLDIER LIZARD DOING ANYTHING TO MAKE YOU EJACULATE? In the very beginning when I woke up, it did look like he had his free hand near his penis. But he moved that arm around a lot while he held me up with the left arm, which never came off of me. That's another thing. I tried, when I was talking to my friend - he said do something yourself. That's when I tried to move my arms to see if I could even move. I could move a little bit and I thought I had some strength, but not enough to take it out. Then that's when all that other stuff was going through my mind about what if I don't get it? So, I did ejaculate. WAS THERE ANYTHING THAT COLLECTED THE SEMEN? No, because at that point, that's when I really broke down in hysterics and started to weep. AFTER THE FIRST EJACULATION? No, after the second. After everything was over with, after he had turned my head down a couple of times, and after I said everything, he finally reached around and hit me w ith the remote to shut me up because I was weeping at that point.\" Continued in Part 4 - Reptile, or Lizard, and Missing Time.
