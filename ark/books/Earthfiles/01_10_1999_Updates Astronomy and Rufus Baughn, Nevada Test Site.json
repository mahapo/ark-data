Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Updates: Astronomy and Rufu s Baughn, Nevada Test Site Â© 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe January 10, 1999 - Astronomy Updates The American Astronomical Society has been meeting in Austin, Texas this week where they have made it clear that understanding how the universe is structured has become one of the central goals in cosmology. And the puzzles outweigh the answers. 1) First, University of Maine astronomer David Batuski described the largest structures ever seen in the universe. To help understand what the structure looks like, imagine a string of 14 pearls. But each pearl is flattened more like a pancake. Each flattened pearl is actually a cluster of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of galaxies. And within each galaxy are millions of suns. The length of this string of clustered galaxies is somewhere between half a billion to a billion light years. And this pearl strand might be connected to another equally as long. If so, it means those two strings of galaxies could stretch for nearly 2 billion light years. If our universe is 16 billion light years in diameter -- these enormous structures of connected galaxies stretch through at least one-eighth of the entire universe. And there might be even more of them. In fact, some astronomers are referring to it as the \"skeleton of the universe.\" Astronomer Batuski called the structures \"imprints of the Big Bang\" and explained they grew from lumps in the primordial soup of matter and energy that made up the universe soon after creation. If stars formed first out of the primordial soup, followed by galaxies, then clusters and finally these super strings of clustered galaxies -- a question that puzzles scientists is: How could all this have happened in only 16 billion years after the Big Bang? 2) Compounding the puzzle of galaxy formations are \"ghost galaxies\" -- large globes of gasses with very few visible stars. Astronomer John Kormendy at the University of Hawaii says he has seen a number of the nearly invisible galaxies and has noticed a pattern: the dim galaxies are more abundant than bright ones, and the darkest are the most abundant. If Dr. Kormendy's observations are accurate, then the majority of galaxies in the universe would be invisible and could help explain one of the most enduring mysteries in astronomy: dark matter. No one knows exactly what dark matter is, but over the last 30 years scientists have determined that the dim stuff makes up about half of the total mass of our own Milky Way Galaxy. And at least 90% of the entire universe. But what is it and why is it there? The astronomer who first proposed dark matter based on her own observations more than 25 years ago is Dr. Vera Rubin at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D. C. She told the Astronomical Society, \"We're in a black room doing an all-black puzzle. And we don't even know where all the pieces are.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rufus Baughn and Nevada Test Site Now, an update on one of my reports in December 1998. I interviewed a man named Glen Pace who worked in the Diagnostic Photographic Department based at Camp Mercury on the Nevada Atomic Test Site about 65 miles north of Las Vegas between the years 1961 and 1963. His colleague was an aerial photographer named Rufus Baughn. Glen Pace had played cards with Krause and a man identified as working for MJ-12 on extraterrestrial-related projects. The MJ-12 man told Krause and Pace that \"Truman had set MJ-12 up when he was President because of the UFOs and all the stuff in the 1940s and early 1950s -- and in that situation, some group of people had to have control of the military and the United States that would not have to get Congressional approval.\" When Glen Pace told Otto Krause about dozens of silver discs he and his father and others had seen fly over Farmington, New Mexico in 1948 and a local newspaper story about a crashed disc in a canyon near Aztec in 1952, the German scientist acknowledged there were extraterrestrial craft and that the first retrieval of a disc was BEFORE Roswell back in the early 1940s from the Ozarks. In the recent release of new MJ-12 documents by Bob and Ryan Wood there is information about a 1941 disc retrieval in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. According to one document, a nuclear propulsion device was discovered and applied to the Manhattan Project's atomic bomb development. Glen Pace said Rufus Baughn could corroborate their employment at the Test Site as diagnostic photographers and their trips to Area 12 overlooking the highly classified Area 51 near Groom Lake. This week I talked with Rufus Baughn: Interview: WHAT YEARS WERE YOU AT THE CAMP MERCURY LOCATION? I was there from 1962-1967. AND IN THAT PERIOD OF TIME, DID YOU WORK WITH GLEN PACE ALL OF THOSE YEARS? Glen Pace and I had worked together in Albuquerque. I had been doing aerial mapping in Albuquerque for a private engineering and aerial consulting firm after I got out of the service. And that's where I met Glen. He came to work there as a photo lab person and we got to be friends. And another person who worked with us went out and interviewed for a job at the test site as a photographer and came back and said they were looking for another photographer. So Glen and I both went out there and interviewed with Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (LRL) that was at the test site from Livermore, California. I was lucky enough to get the first job. I think it was because I had a background in aerial photography from the service. And then shortly thereafter, Glen was hired by LRL and he and his family moved out to Las Vegas. There were times when we had binoculars in the top of Area 12 or the highest points in Area 12 we could see portions of Area 51 in the distance. And I know at night there were a lot of lights and activity and movements there, but to be honest with you, I didn't -- I wouldn't know an alien craft if I saw one. I know the name Otto Krause came up. Glen and I had worked with him or photography and documentation for him and other physicists. DO YOU REMEMBER IF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH OTTO KRAUSE WERE ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS? Some of that stuff bounced around. I don't know whether it was with Otto. But I know that extraterrestrials and aliens and spaceships and things like that from time to time did come up, but whether it was specifically with Otto, I don't"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"know. It's been, God, decades, so I don't know. Like I said, Area 51 was probably the most secretive or Top Secret area that I knew of at the Test Site and I knew there weren't a lot of people who were privy to information about that area. There were only certain people who did go out there. Just because you had a security clearance and were on the test site didn't mean that you had access to Area 51. As I said, when I was out at the test site, everything was classified. Whatever went on as far as the test site, when you were at work, it was classified. I knew people who -- we'd go into Las Vegas and party. I knew people who would go into Las Vegas and sit down at a bar in one of the hotels or in a restaurant and someone would come up and sit down and chit chat with them, and if they said something that was classified, the person -- there were several occasions that people had pulled out security badges -- I don't know if they were FBI or what they were -- and said that these people had breached security. So, I think most of the people out at the test site when I was out there were pretty closed mouths. WHEN YOU AND GLEN PACE WERE WORKING AT THE NEVADA TEST SITE AND AREA 12 AND 51 AND SO FORTH, WHAT KIND OF CARS WERE PROVIDED TO YOU FOR TRANSPORTATION? You mean the make? YEAH. DO YOU REMEMBER? We had Ford Falcons at that time was the car type -- we also had Ford trucks and Dodge pickup trucks. NOW IN -- YOU WERE THERE FROM 1962-1967. THAT OVERLAPS THE PERIOD OF THE KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION BEFORE HE WAS ASSASSINATED. GLEN PACE SAID THAT IN THAT CARD GAME WITH OTTO KRAUSE AND THE MAN IDENTIFIED AS FROM MJ-12, THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT KENNEDY WAS GOING TO VISIT THE TEST SITE AND THAT THE MJ-12 REPRESENTATIVE SAID THEY WERE NOT GOING TO ALLOW HIM TO SEE AREA 51. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT DISCUSSION? No, maam, I do not. I remember that Pres. Kennedy did come out and visited the test site. I also remember that while we were out on station for an \"event\" as they called them -- waiting for an event to happen -- we got the notice plugged in all over the test site and we were waiting on station that Kennedy had been assassinated. More Information: I asked Rufus Baughn about the cars at the Test Site because Glen Pace incorrectly said \"Pintos\" in the first interview, but then called me back right after the broadcast to say he realized he should have said Ford Falcons. I have also found more information about the Cape Girardeau, Missouri incident in a letter sent to investigator Raymond Fowler and re-printed in a \"UFO Crash Retrieval\" report by Len Stringfield in July 1991. The letter was from a woman named Charlette Mann about her grandfather, Reverent William Huffman. In the spring of 1941, the Cape Girardeau Police Department asked him to go to a plane crash outside town. The letter goes on: \"He said they drove out of town 13-15 miles or so, then parked the cars on the side of the road and had to walk 1/4 of a mile or so into a field where he could see fire burning. \"Grandfather said it wasn't an airplane or like any craft he'd ever seen. It was broken and scattered all around, but one large piece was still together and it appeared to have a rounded shape with no edges or seams. It had a very shiny metallic finish. You could see inside one section and see what looked like a metal chair with a panel with many dials and gauges -- none familiar looking to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"him. He said that when he got there, men were already sifting through things. There were some police officers, plain clothes people and military men. \"There were three bodies no human that had been taken from the wreckage and laid on the ground. Grandfather said prayers over them so he got a close look, but didn't touch them. He didn't know what had killed them because they didn't appear to have any injuries and they weren't burnt. It was hard for him to tell if they had on suits or if it was their skin, but they were covered head to foot in what looked like wrinkled aluminum foil. He could see no hair on the bodies and they had no ears. They were small framed like a child about 4 feet tall, but had larger heads and longer arms. They had very large oval shaped eyes, no noses just holes and no lips, just small slits for mouths.\" Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
