Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mutilated Bull Calf in Missouri © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe Dadeville, near the center of the circle, is about 40 miles northwest of Springfield, Missouri. June 22, 2001 Dadeville, Missouri - James Lee Roy has been raising cattle on a farm in Dadeville, Missouri for fifty years. He and his wife, Genevieve, bought their current pastures twenty years ago and now keep about 100 cows for beef sales. Wednesday, June 5, he found his second mutilated calf since 1990.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"James Lee Roy, Farm Owner, Dadeville, Missouri: \"I check on my cows about every morning. And I had a cow that was bawling. She had a bag that was puffed up and I knew she hadn't been sucked. So I started checking around and found a dead calf. HOW FAR WAS THE DEAD CALF FROM THE BAWLING MOTHER? She was pretty close to him when I first saw her. But she did not stay around much. For some reason, she and none of the other cows came close. Usually they'll all stand around and bawl for two or three days (if a calf dies). DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT THE MOTHER COW DIDN'T WANT TO GET CLOSE TO THE CALF? Right. She was strange. The whole herd was strange for a day or two. They stood around in a bunch and didn't want to move out. You could tell that something spooked them pretty bad that night, I'd say. THEY DID STAND AROUND IN A BUNCH? Right. THAT'S HAPPENED IN MUTILATIONS LOTS OF TIMES. It was not hard to tell that these cattle had seen something strange. I don't know what it was, but they were shook up for two or three days. THIS WAS A 350 POUND CHAROLAIS BULL CALF. HOW OLD? He was born back in early February, so about four months old. WHAT WERE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS AS YOU WALKED TOWARDS IT? Well, after I noticed the mother cow hadn't been sucked, I figured I lost a calf from black leg or something. You do that occasionally. But when I first walked up there and seen the calf and it was mutilated I knew right then he hadn't died of natural causes. As soon as I walked up there. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG? I could see how he had been mutilated. His testicles had been cut out and his rear end had been cut out and his tongue was half gone (deep in the throat) and his ear was gone and one eye was plucked out. And his penis was gone. No blood. There wasn't a drop of blood nowhere around him. THIS IS A WHITE HAIR. Right, white Charolais calf. DID YOU CALL A VET? No, I didn't. HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CASE LIKE THIS BEFORE? Yeah, I had one ten or twelve years ago. WAS IT ALSO A CALF? Yes, a heifer calf. WAS IT THE SAME THING WITH SAME PATTERN OF EXCISIONS? Yes, mutilated the same way. WAS IT IN THE SAME LOCATION OF THE PASTURE? o, not too far apart, but in a different pasture. DID YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF THIS NEW ONE? No, I didn't. But the cops did. (Dade County Sheriff's Department) WHICH SIDE WERE THE EAR AND EYE TAKEN FROM? It was lying on his right side, so that would be the left ear. WAS IT CUT DOWN TO THE SCALP? No, it was cut about half way down. ON THE EYE, WAS THERE ANY TISSUE REMOVED AROUND THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"EYE? No, that eye looked like it had been sucked out. There weren't any cuts around it. There wasn't a scar around it nowhere. It looked like it had been plucked out some how. I don't know how. WAS ANY OF THE HIDE REMOVED FROM THE SIDE OF THE FACE OR JAW? Nope. But I've heard of them doing that, though. BUT WHEN YOU OPENED UP THE MOUTH, THE TONGUE WAS REMOVED? Yes, as far down as you could reach the tongue had been cut out. AS YOU CAME DOWN THE NECK, DID YOU LOOK FOR ANY KIND OF PUNCTURE HOLES AROUND THE NECK OR THE CHEST? Well, I didn't look real close. The neighbors and I, we all looked around and we couldn't see any sign that it had been punctured with anything. WHERE THE PENIS AND TESTICLES HAD BEEN, HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE HOW THEY WERE REMOVED? WAS THERE A CIRCLE OR OVAL ONLY HIDE DEEP? It was just like they had been cut off in a circle. Cut completely off. There was a round hole where they had been. Wasn't no flesh, just the bag that the testicles were in was gone and the penis had been pulled out, it looked like. Wasn't no meat or anything there. Weird. YES, AND THE RECTUM? There was a perfect incision there. Looked like may be 5 or 6 inches had been pulled out of it and cut off. Just a perfect circle around where it was. THERE WAS A HOLE THAT WENT INTO THE ANUS, LIKE A PLUG OF TISSUE HAD BEEN REMOVED? Yes, I believe so. SPRINGFIELD IS AN AREA WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN MUTILATIONS BEFORE? Well, I know ten years ago when I lost that first calf, I heard about mutilations quite a bit. But I haven't heard about it for the last few years, it seemed like. We've tried to find a place that looked like anything had landed in the pasture and burned the grass. I've heard of that. But we looked all over the pasture and couldn't see no place where anything had landed. And where this calf was, the grass was pretty tall around there. There wasn't a thing mashed down. The calf looked like he had just fell down there and there wasn't no dress stomped around him or nothing! I mean it's unbelievable. DID YOU TALK WITH ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS TO SEE IF ANYBODY NOTICED OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL THAT NIGHT BEFORE? No, I don't think any of them had. If they did, they would have said something probably. ANY OTHER MUTILATION REPORTS IN YOUR AREA IN THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS? There was one down around Stockton, I think, in 2000. In that one, our son knew a man who lost a calf there and they must have done an autopsy on it and the heart was gone and they didn't know how the heart was gone. I think the vet was Max Smith. THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER ANIMALS. NO INCISIONS ON THE SURFACE OF THE BODY, BUT EXCISIONS OF INTERNAL ORGANS DISCOVERED DURING NECROPSIES. That's scary. WHAT'S THE STATUS ON THE SHERIFF'S INVESTIGATION? ANY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"NECROPSY OR LAB ANALYSIS? No, they didn't say anything. He just laid there and eventually the varmints ate part of him, I guess. Predators won't hardly touch them mutilated animals for two or three days for some reason. DID YOU NOTICE THAT ON THIS ONE? Yes. In fact, I don't think the coyotes ever bothered him. The only thing that I think bothered him was the buzzards after two or three days. They pecked on him a little. But he laid over there and nothing happened for quite awhile. That's another strange thing about it. WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST MUTILATION, THE FEMALE? It happened the same way, just like this one. I just let it lay there, too. Hardly anything touched that one. It finally just dried up. I THINK SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS USED ON THE EXCISIONS. And the coyotes and other cows can tell because they know something is wrong. That mother cow should have stood around and cried for a week, you know would have stayed right there with him. But she just walked off and wouldn't have anything to do with him. DO YOU KNOW OF ANY CONNECTION IN THE BLOOD LINES BETWEEN THE BULL CALF THIS YEAR AND YOUR HEIFER CALF TEN YEARS AGO? No. I don't think so. WHERE DID YOU PURCHASE THE STOCK TO BEGIN WITH? I buy them at the sale barns around. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE EXACT BLOODLINE WOULD BE? No, I wouldn't.\" More Information: If you have any information about this or other animal mutilations in Missouri or surrounding region, please contact the Dade County Sheriff's Department at 417-637-5344.
