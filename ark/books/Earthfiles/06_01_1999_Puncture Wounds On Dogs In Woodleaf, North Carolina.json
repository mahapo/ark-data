Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Puncture Wounds On Dogs In Woodleaf, North Carolina Â© 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe June 1, 1999 Woodleaf, North Carolina - Eight dogs died and the ninth was attacked - all within a quarter mile of each other in the farm community of Woodleaf, North Carolina - between May 9th and May 27th, 1999. All eight of the dead dogs had quarter-inch wide puncture wounds in their neck, back and chest. The Rowan County Animal Control Center did not call for a necropsy by a veterinarian until the eighth dog was found dead early on the morning of May 24th. I talked to the owner who wishes to remain anonymous about the moment she found the oldest of her two dogs dead near the house. Interview: Eighth Dog Owner: \"When I got up at seven to go out and water my little plants, he was closer to the steps. He was right close to the steps. And he was laying stretched out. He was kind of an older dog. And when I went out, I said, \"All right, you better move,\" as I stepped over it. I looked and he looked so stiff, I said, \"He's dead!\" I got down real close and looked around his head. In the top of his head looked like it was scratched, scratch marks, and it was real wet. It looked like saliva. SALIVA. Yeah, it looked like - where something had had his head in its mouth or something. SO IT WAS NOT BLOOD. No, it was not blood. It was wet, clear. I call that saliva, or slobber. Anyway, the whole top of his head was wet. And his ear was kind of clawed or chewed, there were cut places on his ear. So, that's what made me know, \"Oh, my goodness, the thing had my dog.\" So, anyway, after we called the people and they came out... WAS THAT ANIMAL CONTROL? Animal Control came out and they turned him over. And then that's when we saw the puncture marks on his throat and around his chest and his stomach part. They were just deep puncture marks - just like it may have been a big mouth just went in and come back out. They weren't tear places. They were just puncture marks. SO, LIKE HOLES GOING RIGHT INTO THE BODY. Right, like a hole went right into the skin. There wasn't a whole lot of tear. Animal Control said what killed it - one of them cut his trachea and one punctured his heart, it went in that deep. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"RIGHT, AND I THINK THAT ONE WAS ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG. Right. AND IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY FROM HAVING TALKED WITH CLARENCE FOX AT ANIMAL CONTROL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISION, HE SAID THERE REALLY WASN'T MUCH BLOOD AT THESE HOLES. IS THAT TRUE? Right, there wasn't no blood hardly anywhere. There was just a little bit of blood where the dog was lying. So we were trying to figure out, \"What happened to the blood?\" You know, something that cut that deep in that puncture - \"Well, where's the blood?!\" Because we didn't see anything until they came and turned him over - even the scrape mark on his head looked like where the blood - like you would probably get scraped on the cement, like you may fall and a little scraping and blood might come up there and stop. That's what looked like in his head. SO NO BLOOD WAS OOZING FROM THESE HOLES? No. When they turned him over, no. We were trying to figure, \"Is something sucking blood?\" Because where was the blood?! You know, because with that many holes, the blood should have been running out. You know, by the time he was killed and before he died, the blood should have been running out of those holes. CLARENCE FOX, ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISOR FOR ROWAN COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, IS CURRENTLY IN CHARGE OF INVESTIGATING THE BIZARRE PUNCTURE ATTACKS. IN TERMS OF ONGOING INVESTIGATION IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS WHERE YOU HAVE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS WITH PUNCTURE MARKS AND LITTLE BLOOD HAPPENING IN A RASH OF TWO OR THREE WEEKS RESULTING IN EIGHT DOG DEATHS, HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT TRYING TO INVESTIGATE AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO SEE IF YOU CAN FIND WHAT THIS IS? Clarence Fox, Environmental Supervisor, Rowan County, North Carolina: \"Well, we're going up there and going through the properties looking for tracks, for any kind of droppings. When the time we get another report of another fatality or injury or something like that, we'll go up there and investigate it. We've got traps set trying to catch the animal. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN THE ENVIRONMENTAL SUPERVISOR? Five years. AND IN THE FIVE YEARS, HAVE YOU HAD REPORTS OF PUNCTURE MARKS IN ANIMAL DEATHS LIKE THIS BEFORE? Haven't had anything like this before. AND THE LACK OF BLOOD IS PUZZLING? That hasn't bothered me as much as just the fact that there hasn't been a lot of sounds or struggle or anything. People are not woken up by all this activity. Seems to go on close to their homes, but they just don't hear anything. AND IT'S DEFINITELY LATE AT NIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Late at night or early in the morning. You know, before the sun comes up. BECAUSE PEOPLE KNEW THE ANIMAL WAS ALIVE WHEN THEY WENT TO BED AND THEY FIND THEM IN THE MORNING? On occasion, people have gotten up and heard their dogs bark and looked out and seen what's going on and not seen anything and gone back to bed. And then gotten up and the dog's been dead. That happened in two cases. AND THAT WAS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE HOUSE. Yeah. I know definitely one of them was because I was out there. And the other one, I understand it was. AND THE PUNCTURE MARKS THAT YOU HAVE SEEN WITH YOUR OWN EYES, FROM ANIMAL TO ANIMAL, THEY ARE ALL ABOUT A QUARTER INCH IN DIAMETER? I've only seen the one animal that was autopsied. Animal Control staff saw the other one. AND IN THE ELEVEN PUNCTURES IN THE MAY 23RD KILL, WERE THEY ALL THE SAME SIZE, ABOUT A QUARTER-INCH DIAMETER? The ones I saw were. None of them were any real jagged tears or any large holes or anything like that. THEY JUST LOOKED LIKE REALLY CLEAN HOLES PENETRATING INTO THE DOG? Ye a h . AND WERE THE HOLES CONCENTRATED AROUND THE NECK? On the side of the neck, the back of the neck and the chest, in front of the front leg. AND HOW MANY WERE IN THE HEART AREA? There were a number there. I can't tell you the exact count, but the one that the veterinarian indicated to me punctured the heart. But there were a number of them around in that area. AND DID SHE SAY IF ANY HEART TISSUE HAD BEEN ACTUALLY REMOVED? She didn't indicate to me anything. She said there was a puncture in it. THERE WAS A PUNCTURE IN THE HEART? Ye s . AND DID THE VETERINARIAN HAVE ANY SUGGESTION? I think she thought it might be a large mammal. A LARGE MAMMAL. BUT WHAT LARGE MAMMAL WOULD HAVE FOUR INCH LONG STRAIGHT TEETH? The closest thing we would have in this area would be a cougar, but I think their teeth are bigger diameter than that."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANY INVESTIGATORS ABOUT THAT SEQUENCE OF CHUPACABRAS EVENTS BETWEEN 1995 AND 1996? I read some of it off the internet, but I haven't talked to anybody about it. I still have an open mind about what it could be and I haven't ruled anything out. But I don't have any conclusive evidence. THE OWNER OF THE MAY 24TH AUTOPSIED DOG DID FIND STRANGE THREE-TOED TRACKS. THAT REMINDED ME OF THE THREE TOES AND FINGERS DESCRIBED BY EYEWITNESSES IN PUERTO RICO WHO CLAIMED ENCOUNTERS WITH THE CHUPACABRAS 'GOAT SUCKER.\" Eighth dog owner: \"The night he jumped our dog - the one that we brought in - we went out and it had three scratch things, like three claws, like an animal makes a print in the dirt. It was three scratch marks like it had three claws on his feet or hands or what not. CLAW MARKS. Claw marks, like six or seven sets were over there. There were three together. There were three because I counted them and they looked like they might have been two or three inches long and maybe about an inch wide, maybe not quite that wide. We did see those. It's been really spooky back here. Since then, three days after - OK, that happened and then they came back and attacked our other dog. But we were watching, we were listening and watching, and the dog was on the dark side of the house. And we heard (sounds) and we hollered and it ran away. Then we went out and the dog did have a little tear place on his ear. SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT AFTER YOU FOUND THE ONE DOG ON MAY 24TH, THAT THREE NIGHTS LATER THERE WAS ANOTHER ATTACK ON YOUR OTHER YOUNGER DOG? Yeah, but now we keeps him on our deck and we keeps him up close - we put him on the deck at night and shut him up. We put him on the car porch in the day. But, yes, he came back. WELL, WHEN YOU GOT UP TO LOOK AT ALL THE COMMOTION, COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING? The only thing about it is if we had to do it over again, we would have done it different. My dog (whimper sounds) like whimpering. Then all of a sudden, we heard this (growl sound) like a real deep growl... then we heard like they were tussling... and I hollered at them and by the time we got out and put the lights on, the dog had hushed. WHO DO YOU THINK WAS MAKING THE DEEP GROWL? I think the growl was coming from something else because this dog I don't think could have a growl that deep. Now, he might have, but it was too deep for him. And then I think the whimper - he had been scared since the other dog had been killed. He wouldn't even bark. He wouldn't bark, and he'd been a barking dog. And from that night - when our other dog got killed to this night, we hadn't heard a whimper out of him. He wouldn't bark. And then we hear that little cry like (whimper) like he was just afraid something was there (whimper). We never heard a (deep growl) out of him. It could have been him doing it, but if it was - it was awful deep. And then we heard a tussle like and more growl and something hitting against the house. And I hollered, \"Get away from him! Get away from him!\" And it didn't turn loose right then. It continued for maybe another 30 or 40 seconds more. And then it hushed and thought the dog was dead. So, we got flashlights and went out to the dog and found our other dog and brought him in."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We could have gotten killed out there, but we took a chance on going around to the dark side of the house and finding the dog. And he was tucked into the house scared to death. But he was wet - he was wet around that place where the nick were. That's why I knew whatever the night before (with the other dog) was this here, it was the same. But we haven't heard a thing since.\" More Information: I investigated chupacabras attacks in Puerto Rico, Mexico and southern U. S. states between 1995 to June 1996. After that, those first chupacabras reports seemed to end. But now, these incidents in Woodleaf, North Carolina remind me of what I've heard before: the clear, thick saliva-like liquid, bloodless puncture wounds a quarter-inch diameter, the three-toed claw marks.
