The carved rock was found by Roswell auto repairman, Robert Ridge, 50, during his September 4, 2004, deer hunting trip near Capitan, New Mexico, 17 miles southeast from the July 1947 UFO crash site between Corona and Roswell.

Located on the slopes of Badbury Castle, is a fine example of as yet unknown glyph design (crescents and circles) set inside what appeared to be a circle, but was sectioned as part of the design. Positioned further down the field, and on the same level of ground, was what had to be described as a miniature fractal, incorporating the same principle of design as it's larger fractal predecessors. The glyph itself was one of the best floor patterns I have had the pleasure to witness in many years, very fluid in it's form, with counter rotational flows evident in many parts of the design. The whole floor construction gave the impression of running water, with multi- layering in certain segments of the pattern. In one particular part, the layering was about four layers thick where the crop was layered as one directional flow met another. Two directional lays were evident within the design and as they changed direction, the crop was 'fanned' out into changing its course. Really wonderful to see. The two circles were exceptional. One didn't actually have the classic spiraled centre; the crop just flattened itself in two directions within its centre. One of the best examples this year, set in a wonderful location.” Liddington Castle Julia Set \"The third Julia set formation appeared early August, in wheat, below Liddington Castle hill fort, on the same night and in the same field as a very different design. This Julia set has a quite distinct ‘flavour’ from the others, the way it doubles back, but it is a proper one, never-the-less. Many investigators commented that it had the most beautiful lay that they had ever seen. It bears a tear drop signature similar to July 30, 1996, Devizes pattern, one of the longest in crop formation history.” “Tear Drop” in Etchilhampton, Near Devizes, Wiltshire, U.

Red Collie: “Three related crop formations appeared in the summer of 1996 at: 1) Stonehenge (July 7, 1996) T he fractal Julia Set was reported in a wheat field across the road from Stonehenge on July 7, 1996. The spiral measured 915 feet on its longest axis, covered a square acre and consisted of 149 circles. The center of each circle was twisted differently.

Instead, as I discussed in a previous essay (“The Stonehenge Code,” archived at Cropcircleconnector.com), they actually represented certain aspects of lunar astronomy as practiced long ago, at megalithic sites close to where they were found. (i) Stonehenge of July 7 showed the Moon at sunset, varying in phase from new to full. It spends 15 days at sunset above the visible horizon while growing in phase, then another 14.5 days under the visible horizon while waning in phase, for 29.5 days total. (ii) Windmill Hill of July 29, showed the Moon at midnight, varying in phase from half to full to half, for just 11 days above the visible horizon, and possibly at a northern latitude of 60 to 65 degrees."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(iii) Chisledon of August 2 showed two small drawings. To the bottom right below, we saw a Full Moon and Half Moon with two broad arrows. At the upper left, we saw a ‘lunar phase diagram’ with a central pointer (‘tear drop’): G raphic overlay by Red Collie. a) Considering first the Full Moon and Half Moon, I found using a program from http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.html that one of the formation's two broad arrows pointed on the horizon to where a new Moon rose (290 degrees azimuth) at sunset on July 16, just two weeks earlier. Likewise, its other arrow pointed on the horizon to where a full Moon set (110 degrees azimuth) at sunset on July 30, only three days earlier: G raphic overlay by Red Collie. This first crop picture seemingly told us how to interpret Stonehenge of July 7, which also showed a variation of lunar phases from new to full at sunset. Its two azimuth values of 290 and 110 degrees are very season-specific, and indicate a precise time within any year"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"just after the summer solstice in late July. (b) Considering next the lunar phase diagram, I found that the schematic lunar phases as shown there match actual lunar phases from July 24 (half) to July 30 (full) to August 6 (half) of 1996, when observing the Moon at midnight: Furthermore, its central pointer indicated a precise lunar phase for midnight 00:00 on August 3 of 1996, only hours after that picture was found. G raphic by Red Collie. This second crop picture seemingly told us how to interpret Wind mill Hill of July 30, which also showed a variation of lunar phases from half to full to half at midnight. The length of time required to go from half to full to half was shown at Chisledon 1996 as 13 days (July 24 to August 6), which is correct for a summer solstice near latitude 51 degrees North. That is somewhat longer than for Windmill Hill in 1996 (11 days), but identical to that shown at Milk Hill in 2001 (13 days). In summary, those two small drawings at Chisledon in 1996 gave us precise, if subtle, instructions on how to decode Stonehenge and Windmill Hill of the same year in terms of lunar astronomy, but we do not understand its dual astronomical codes from 1996 to 2007.” eturn to Part 1 ontinued in Part 3.
