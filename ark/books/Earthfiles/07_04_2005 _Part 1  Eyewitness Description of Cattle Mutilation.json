Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1: Eyewitness Description of Cattle Mutilation Â© 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe \" T he cow was limp on its side with all four legs touching. And they (alien beings) proceeded to take these machines and go into different areas of the body and cut them and extract the blood out for food.\" - R oger Vail, Musician July 4, 2005 Mid-West - Roger Vail was born in the mid-West in 1944 and joined the U. S. Navy in 1963. He went through electronic technician school and intended to have a military career. But an injury in his first military year meant an early honorable discharge in 1964. After that, he went to Western Illinois University to work on a physics major, but switched to a Mass Communications major. Then, music and travel pulled him away before he completed his undergraduate degree, and Roger spent the next 21 years playing guitar and bass. Finally, in 1985, he finished his B. A. with an emphasis on radio and TV production. Through it all, Roger Vail was haunted by a conscious experience he had in the early 1970s on a car trip with a friend through Colorado to California. The two had stopped to camp near Cheyenne Mountain above Colorado Springs. The local media was reporting about mysterious, unsolved deaths of cattle, horses and other farm animals that law enforcement called \"mutilations\" because ears, eyes, jaw flesh, tongues, genitals and rectal tissue were \"surgically excised\" without blood from hundreds, if not thousands, of animals. Roger Vail contacted me recently about what happened on that camp out in the early 1970s. Interview: Roger Vail, Musician, Mid-West: \"I had studied Tibetan telepathy a lot and I sat there (camp site) for about an hour mentally communicating, trying to find out what was going on with the animal mutilations. I saw this light came down and the next thing I knew, I was inside the craft and being given a tour. That's the way it started. I had full hair down to my waist and a beard, like a hippy. So, I was strange to the beings on board the craft because most humans aren't hairy like that. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT? The light was like a cyan color, greenish-blue, slightly yellow and it had very distinct edges on it. It was sort of like a conduit of light not a laser. It was like it would cut around the molecules, or this is how the ETs explained it to me, and that they used the light as a waveguide and anything inside that light, they could bring up and down. YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SEEING A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE MOVING LIGHT THAT STOPS AND THEN THE COW ROSE UP IN THE BEAM OF LIGHT? No, I was aboard the ship when they brought the cow in. THEN LET'S GO BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE IN MEDITATION AND PLEASE TRY TO GIVE ME MORE OF A SECOND-BY-SECOND DESCRIPTION FROM THE TIME THAT YOU SEE THE LIGHT IN THE SKY AND WHAT HAPPENS. OK, I was sitting there and I just got the sense that they were communicating back to me and all of a sudden, I saw the silvery craft at maybe a 45-degree angle from me. Then the light came all over me and I went up there into the ship and was there. DID YOU GO UP INTO THE SHIP INSIDE A BEAM OF LIGHT? Yeah. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOUR EYES COULD SEE WHEN YOU WERE IN THAT BEAM OF LIGHT? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It was sort of like a mist. It was like I was inside a colored tube of light. I could see the mist around me. You could see a slight barrier around the outer edges and I was right in the middle of the light and it was pretty big maybe 3 to 4 meters in diameter. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE LIGHT? From the inside, it was a little bit more green and yellow than the blue from the outside. It looked different on the outside than it did from the inside. It was very similar to the colors you have on computers. I'm looking at mine right now and it was very similar to that color, but not quite as green more yellow. HOW DID YOU GET FROM THE GROUND IN MEDITATION TO INSIDE THE TUBE OF LIGHT? It came and got me. I saw the light and it got smaller and then bigger. It started out as a point and then came right around me and I went right up inside it. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE TO YOUR SKIN AND MIND BEING INSIDE THAT BEAM OF LIGHT? My skin kind of tingled a little bit - more of a chill. A slight cold, kind of a rushing breezy effect, but no wind. I was just real curious what was going on with the cattle mutilations. SO, WHEN YOU WERE INSIDE THE TUBE OF BLUISH-GREENISH-YELLOW LIGHT, YOU ACTUALLY FELT A COLD TEMPERATURE? Yes, it was cool. And there was no stress on me at all. HOW FAST DID YOU RISE IN THAT BEAM OF LIGHT? Like complete acceleration from zero to 200 in a matter of second. Then I stopped just as quickly. I had no inertia. You could barely feel it take off. There wasn't that big of a pull to start with and then when it stopped, there wasn't any stop inertia less than an elevator. WHEN YOU WERE GOING IN THE BEAM UP TO THE CRAFT SO RAPIDLY, DID YOU HAVE ANY LOOK DOWN EITHER THROUGH THE BEAM OR FROM THE CRAFT AND DOWN TO THE GROUND WHERE YOU HAD JUST BEEN SITTING? No. It was like opaque from the inside of the light. You couldn't see through it. Then I was coming through into an area and having doors open and walking in. WHAT WAS THE SHAPE OF THE DOORS? They were like square with rounded corners on top. In the middle, they just sort of opened up. HOW BIG WERE THEY? Maybe 7 feet tall by 7 or 8 feet wide. The doors slid apart and I walked through with two beings with me. DID YOU OR A BEING OPEN A KNOB IN THE DOOR? No, they had sensors or something. There was a pad on the floor like a black area. When you hit the black area on the floor, the door opened. Grey-Skinned Beings and A Tall, Snake-Skinned \"Leader\" CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE TWO BEINGS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU? The two ones that came in with me were kind of like what people call the greys, but their heads weren't shaped the same. They didn't have any necks that moved. The heads and shoulders were connected together. I was looking forward into the door and it was more of a thought communication. There was kind of like a hospital smell, a disinfectant type of smell, in the first room. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND WERE THEY WEARING ANY KIND OF GARMENTS? These two were kind of greyish-brown. They seemed to have a loose-fitting hood that went all the way down to the floor like a robe."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE FITTED ROBE? A dark brown. DID THE HOOD COME DOWN OVER THEIR HEAD OR COULD YOU SEE THEIR FA C E ? I could see them out of my peripheral vision. I could see just a slight image of their face. I didn't really turn sideways and look. I was dumbfounded and looked straight ahead. WHAT WERE THEIR EYES LIKE? They were kind of recessed. They could have had some kind of protective suit on. It didn't look like organic skin. It was kind of like a plastic mask type thing on. LIKE THEY WERE WEARING A TIGHT BODY LEOTARD? Not as tight as a leotard. Maybe like a 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick foam padded hood type thing, kind of like a hockey mask, but real smooth and no marks on it. There was nothing for the mouth, no opening at all. Those two were different than the ones that were inside. YOU ARE AT THIS SQUARE DOOR. THESE ODDLY CLOAKED AND POSSIBLY MASKED BEINGS ARE ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU. HOW TALL WERE THEY COMPARED TO YOU? Just about my height (6 feet), maybe a couple of inches shorter around 5' 8\" to 5'10\". The door opened up into this other room and we went through. It was like a main room of the spaceship. WAS IT ROUND OR SQUARE? It was a round, domed room. It was maybe 12 feet high and round. COLOR? Ta n - w h i t e . WAS THERE LIGHT? Yeah, there was light everywhere. It was just there. There wasn't any shadows on anything. WHO IS IN THAT ROOM? I would say there were probably eight to ten different beings in there. There was also a bank of six sort of like phone booths with beings sitting inside of them, like little hooded plastic phone booths that you could stand in to talk. They were up against the wall and the beings were in there operating some things. They didn't turn around. They were just in that area doing their work. Telepathy There were also three beings that came up and was talking to me, but without making a sound, just talking about me while they were talking to me at the same time ! CAN YOU EXPLAIN? They were discussing among themselves using telepathy asking me if I was like the normal human, but saying 'This guy is different.' They were talking to me and about me at the same time a discussion about why I asked to come aboard and why the animal mutilations. WHAT DID THESE BEINGS LOOK LIKE? Tall Snake-Skinned Being They were kind of different. One was completely different than the rest of them. He was taller than I was and had like a pointed-shaped head and was more like a purple reptilian look, like purple scales and a round mouth. His head didn't turn on his shoulders, either. He just turned his shoulders. He seemed to be the leader of it. He had a different kind of uniform a kind of plastic-type"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"cloth. The other two were in lighter colored robes. THE SKIN OF THIS SCALY BEING, WHEN YOU SAY IT WAS PURPLE, COULD YOU GIVE ME A COLOR I MIGHT RECOGNIZE? Iridescent purple. I can't think of anything that would be the same color. It was a dark brownish-red purple. WHAT ABOUT THE EYES? They were kind of a little inset and pointed upward on the outer edge. They were kind of black all the way, with maybe a slight yellow iris. There might have been a little bit of red there, too. DID THEY HAVE PUPILS THAT WERE VERTICAL LIKE A CROCODILE'S? No. They were just more round, oval up and down, and you could see the eyes were slanted. When they opened their eyelids, you could see how they opened and closed. COULD YOU SEE A PUPIL AND IRIS LIKE YOU CAN IN A HUMAN EYE? There seemed to be a dark brown outer edge in the black and then the color red and yellow in the middle. DID YOU SEE ANY PUPIL AT ALL? Yeah, I guess. There was a pupil that was getting bigger and littler because the eyelids were closing up and down, sort of squinting and opening them up. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THOSE EYELIDS? More brown than purple, not quite as scaly - but more leathery than the other beings. Maybe it was a matter of age. I don't know. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SCALED SNAKES, SOME WITH BIGGER SCALES AND OTHERS THAT ARE REALLY SMOOTH SNAKES. WHAT WOULD THIS BEING BE CLOSEST TO IN SNAKE SCALES? Oh, it would be more like the common garden snake. The scales were kind of connected together, maybe the biggest scale was a quarter-inch. It just seemed like it was faceted more than scales with membranes between those areas that looked like scales. More of a hexagon with a rounded bottom, like a half a hexagon with a rounded bottom. Garden snake image Â© by jackrabit4. COULD YOU SEE THE ENDS OF THE HANDS? HOW MANY DIGITS WERE THERE? I don't recall seeing the hand on these guys. They had long robes that covered their whole arms. Dark, Multi-Colored, Hooded Cloak On Snake-Skinned Being THE REDDISH-BROWN-PURPLE SNAKE-SKINNED BEING ALSO HAD ON A HOODED CLOAK? Yes, they all had these hoods, long and flowing and hanging down over their limbs. You couldn't see the end of their limbs."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE SNAKE-SKINNED BEING'S HOODED CLOAK? It was more like blackish-brown with some purple, the same color as his skin. COULD YOU SEE THE LEGS AND FEET? Nope. I couldn't see that part of him. ARE YOU STANDING IN FRONT OF THIS VERY TALL SNAKE-SKINNED BEING? Ye s . WHAT HAPPENS? He was just asking me what I knew and what I wanted to know. It's kind of like: 'You asked to be here. What do you want to know?' They seemed to know that I had quite a significant scientific background so they could explain things to me and I just wanted to know what they were using the cattle for.\" T o be continued in Part 2.

Two men were fighting over me ... holding a great contest over me. I asked them, \"Who are you, that you are thus empowered over me?\" They answered, \"We have been empowered and rule over all mankind.\" They said to me, \"Which of us do you choose to rule you?\" I raised my eyes and looked. One of them was terrifying in his appearance, like a serpent, his cloak, many-colored yet very dark. ... And I looked again, and in his appearance, his visage like a viper. ... I replied to him, \"This Watcher, who is he?\" He answered, \"This Watcher ... his three names are Belial and Prince of Darkness and King of Evil.\" I said (to the other Watcher), \"My lord, what dominion (have you?)\" He answered, \"You saw (the viper), and he is empowered over all Darkness, while I (am empowered over all Light.) ... My three names are Michael, Prince of Light and King of Righteousness.\" For more information about the animal mutilation and non-human entity phenomena, please see books An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II listed in Earthfiles Shop.
