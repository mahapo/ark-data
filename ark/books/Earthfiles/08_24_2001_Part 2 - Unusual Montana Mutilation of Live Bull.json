Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 2 - Unusual Montana Mutilation of Live Bull © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe Seven mutilations reported in Great Falls, Montana region from Babb in northwest corner down to Dupuyer, Fort Shaw, Cascade and Belt between June 12 and August 15, 2001. August 24, 2001 Depuyer, Montana - The first mutilated cow in Montana officially reported to law enforcement this summer was discovered on June 12 on the Don Reishus ranch in Depuyer between Conrad and Great Falls. Don Reishus, Sr., is in his seventies now and could not believe he was seeing another jaw stripped to the bone, eye removed, teat removed and rectum cored out - all without blood like others he had seen in the 1970s on his same Montana ranch. His neighbor, Karl Rappold, could not believe that the same day, June 12, he found one of his older (5 years) 2000 pound bulls alive with its huge tail cut cleanly and bloodlessly off about six inches from the base of the bull's spine. The cut was smooth \"like you would take a circular saw through it,\" but no blood, no fluid of any kind. Completely dry.\" Unfortunately, neither rancher took any photographs at the time. But in my investigations of unusual animal deaths, there have been several incidents in which tails of cattle have been removed. Three examples shown below were discovered in Oakley, Idaho on October 8, 1989; Sterling, Colorado on April 20, 1976; and Motcombe, England in July 1993.

Karl Rappold's grandfather began homesteading the family's Depuyer, Montana ranch in 1882. In the past 120 years, nothing like what happened to his bull on June 12 has ever happened. Karl, who is now 49-years-old, has always worked the ranch and talked to me about finding his mutilated bull in a state of shock. Interview: Karl Rappold, Rancher, Depuyer, Montana: \"It was early morning when it happened. When I went over to salt the cows, the bull was missing. And I went looking for him and found him standing there in the corner of the fence and his tail had been amputated, but there was no blood or signs of anything other than it had been completely cut off - the bone, the tail and everything. It was cut probably 4 or 6 inches from the base of the spine. He didn't move or anything. He let me walk right up to him and he just stood there."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"FOUR INCHES OF THE TAIL WAS HANGING THERE? Ye s . WAS IT CUT THROUGH AS YOU WOULD A SAUSAGE? Yeah, it was cut straight through. It's very smooth. IF YOU WERE GOING TO CUT THROUGH A BULL'S TAIL FOUR INCHES FROM THE SPINE, COULD YOU DO IT? Well, not while he was alive without having him in captivity. BECAUSE THE BULL WOULD JUST GO CRAZY? Ye s . WHAT KIND OF INSTRUMENT WOULD YOU USE IF HE WAS ANESTHETIZED? Well, you'd have to have some kind of very sharp instrument. To get through the size of the bone that was cut, it would almost take a saw which would leave a rough edge. But this had no rough edge at all. There was no ragged meat or anything. Everything was just completely smooth where it was cut - the hide, the bone, the meat and everything. NO BLOOD AT ALL? No blood at all. HAD YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE? Well, we did have a mutilation of a 2-year-old heifer about ten years ago, but when I first seen this I couldn't figure out what happened to him until I ran into don Reishus in town and he told me his cow had been mutilated and then I figured it was the same thing that had happened down here. IN THE OTHER MUTILATION 10 YEARS AGO, WAS THE TAIL ALSO CUT OFF? No, the sex organs were removed. The left eye and part of the skin, the hide was skinned up from the backside in between her legs. Her udders were removed and up to the naval. DID YOU HAVE SUCH MUTILATIONS OF YOUR ANIMALS BACK IN THE 1970S WHEN THE GREAT FALL AREA HAD NEARLY SEVENTY CASES IN TWO YEARS? No, we didn't have any in the 1970s. We didn't have any until it was 1991 or 1992. WHEN YOU WENT UP TO HIS HEAD, DID HE ACKNOWLEDGE YOU IN ANY WAY LIKE TRY TO MOVE WHE N YOU WE RE THE RE ? He followed me when I started to walk away to go back to the vehicle. He followed me all the way back to the vehicle sort of like a dog would. IS THAT NORMAL? No. BECAUSE A BULL DOESN'T USUALLY FOLLOW ANYBODY? Right. WHEN HE FOLLOWED YOU BACK TO YOUR TRUCK, WHAT HAPPENED THEN? I just got in and left and that's when I went to town and ran into Don Reishus"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and he said about his cow. WERE YOU GOING BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT FROM A VET ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE BULL? No, I was just coming back to the ranch and had to go through town to get back from that pasture to the ranch here. Bull Goes Blind A Week Later WHAT DID YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE FOR THAT BULL? Nothing. There was no bleeding, so there wasn't anything that could be done. He just seemed to be in shock and when I checked on him that night, he was coming out of it. And approximately a week later, he went blind. HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WENT BLIND? Because I brought him home here to the ranch and I put him in a pen down here where I could keep an eye on him. And in about a week he went blind. WHAT WAS THE FIRST SYMPTOM? I just went down one morning to feed him and he couldn't see. He was walking along bumping into the walls. COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING ABNORMAL IN HIS EYES? Yeah, his eyes had turned blue. SOLID BLUE? Yeah. The pupils were blue. THE SAME COLOR OF BLUE IN BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES? Yes, the one eye had less coloring than the other eye. He could see just a little bit out of the one eye. IF YOU WERE GOING TO COMPARE THE BLUE COLOR THAT THOSE EYES TURNED, WHAT COLOR OF BLUE WOULD IT BE? Probably like a robin's egg - a real light color blue. THAT IS A COLOR THAT CAN HAPPEN TO EYE TISSUE IN THE PRESENCE OF HEAT OR RADIATION. I HAVE SEEN EXACTLY THAT COLOR ON OTHER CASES OF ANIMAL MUTILATIONS. AND YET YOUR BULL WAS ALIVE AFTER THAT REMOVAL OF THE TAIL. DID YOU LOOK AROUND TO SEE IF YOU COULD FIND ANY REMNANTS OF THE TAIL OR TAIL HAIR? I couldn't find anything where he was at. He was in a big field, but in the general area where he was at I looked to find the tail, but I could not find any sign of it. IN THAT WEEK BETWEEN HIS LOSING THAT TAIL AND THE EYES GOING BLUE, WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THAT WEEK THAT YOU OR ANYONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE HEARD OR SEEN, MAYBE EVEN LATE AT NIGHT? No. NOT ANYTHING? Nope. WHAT ABOUT FROM THE OTHER RANCHERS AROUND YOU? ANY REPORTS OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS: WAS THIS A RESIDUE OF SOMETHING FROM THE FIRST ASSAULT ON THE TAIL? OR DID SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN LATER THAT PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF HEAT OR RADIATION ON THOSE EYES? Yeah. That I could not tell you. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BULL? He was put down. YOU HAD HIM PUT TO SLEEP? Yeah, he's been destroyed. TO PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY. Yeah, he was blind so he was no good to us. WERE YOU CONCERNED THAT WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO HIM MIGHT CONTAMINATE HIS MUSCLE TISSUE? Yes. We could have gotten $1,000 for him as hamburger. But who knows what's happened to that meat? IN TALKING WITH OTHER RANCHERS, HAS ANYBODY ELSE HAD ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THAT HAPPEN BEFORE? Not that I'm aware where the animal lived. THEY'VE LOST TAILS ON DEAD ANIMALS THAT WERE MUTILATED? Ye s . DID YOU TALK WITH YOUR SHERIFF? Yeah, we talked with him some. WHAT DID HE SAY? Well, at first they weren't too sure about what was going on until the one at Taliaferro's. (Mark Taliaferro cow mutilation. See Part 3) When they got that one, then they started an investigation. The deal with the bull is pretty hard. They don't know what to think of it, whether it's part of the same (mutilation) deal or not. THE UNSOLVED MYSTERY WOULD BE: WHO WAS CUTTING THROUGH THAT BULL'S TAIL AND WHERE AND WHY DID THEY STOP AT THE REMOVAL OF THE TAIL ONLY? Yeah. I haven't been able to figure that out and I don't know how - this bull weighed 2000 pounds and you just don't walk up to a 2000 pound bull and cut his tail off. YES, HOW WAS HE KEPT IN ANY KIND OF CONDITION THAT THE TAIL COULD BE CUT OFF CLEANLY? AND BLOODLESSLY? Yeah, I was talking to my veterinarian about it and he doesn't have a clue either. DID HE SAY THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOOD? Yeah, definitely when a tail is removed up that high and on that big of a meat base, there has got to be blood. Or there should be blood. DID THE VET EVER SEE THE BULL HIMSELF? No."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING FOR HIM TO SEE THAT CUT. HE MIGHT HAVE DONE AN EXAMINATION TO SEE IF IT HAD BEEN CAUTERIZED SOME WAY THAT PREVENTED THE BLEEDING. WHEN YOU'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER WITH OTHER RANCHERS TO TALK ABOUT THE MUTILATIONS, WHAT DOES EVERYBODY SAY? They just can't figure out what the deal is and how this can be happening without someone seeing it because this time of year, we're all out there baling at night and the night the end of June that the Taliaferro's lost their cow, I was out here bailing most of the night and never seen anything. And I'm right next door to them only about a mile away.\" More Information: Current List of Cattle Mutilations in Great Falls, Montana area in summer of 2001: 1) Don Reishus, mutilated cow in Dupuyer discovered June 12.
