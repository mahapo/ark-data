I was warned that if I saw the discs coming down to stay away a good distance and then they would let me know when it was safe to come up to the craft.” - A rizona Abductee A rizona Abductee: “Here's a painting on the internet I found that closely resembles one event I had.” R eturn to: Part 1 June 13, 2008 Phoenix, Arizona - The Arizona experiencer, William, says his parents had his birth certificate that showed 1953 as his birth year. But after his experiences with the human-looking entity, Zo, and others, William b ecame convinced that he somehow entered life on Earth at a different date under the control of Zo and a civilization based on the planet Lanulose orbiting the yellow sun, Tau Ceti, only about 12 light-years from Earth. After his email account in Part 1, I interviewed him by phone for more details about his life time of interaction with humanoid, but not Homo sapiens, beings. Interview: Fall 1965 W illiam: “ At age twelve and a half in 1965, on a cold fall day, was the first time I saw something in the sky so large. I was outside stacking wood in Kentucky at dusk. There was a full moon already up and coming from my right, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, turned and was amazed at the size of the thing. It was as big as the Hindenburg – a huge, dirigible- shaped object with no fins on the back. It did not have ribs. It was a solid piece. It was a lot longer than it was thick. On the side of this, you could see the full moon glinting off of its silvery surface. The object was parked over some tall pine trees. There were quite large, round, lights that were a pastel color. They weren’t a bright red or neon. It was a soft pastel color and going from the left side to the right side. There were five of lights that would pulse one after the other going one direction and then pulse again one after the other going the other direction. The rhythm was nice and slow. As one light faded on and then off, the next light faded on and so forth. Dirigible-Shaped Craft Causes Pine Trees to Whip Around The top of the pine trees were whipping back and forth like there was wind, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"but there wasn’t any wind. The dirigible-like object was probably no more than ten feet above the pine trees. To the right of the pine trees were some high tension lines that ran across the property. And further to the right from me was a small pond. There was a pasture between me and the pine trees and it was a distance of maybe 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The object just sat there. I walked over toward the electric fence that was between me and the ‘blimp’ and I started talking to it. And the object seemed to talk right back to me, only it was in my head. It told me it would see me again soon. Then the object moved off directly away from me and was moving against the breeze that had come up. We were up on top of the hill, so it apparently disappeared behind the hill following the tree line down the hill. I was fascinated by this and completely thrilled that I had made contact. It felt like home to me. It was one of those phenomenal things that happen in your life that you feel comfortable with. That same year, I had a friend named Randy Adams. He lived down at the bottom of the hill on a creek. I would go over to his house and he would come to mine. He and I were going to meet at what we thought was an old Civil War cemetery that mid-afternoon. I took off hiking from where I lived going down into the forest. We planned it out and it was going to take about two hours for each of us to get there. I made my way through the forest and eventually got to the location. I didn’t see Randy and hung out to wait. It was really hot and steamy. I had on combat boots, cutoffs and a T-shirt with the arms cut out of it and the neck cut out of it. I sat down beneath a tree on a big patch of cool, green moss. I brushed away the leaves to make a good place to sit because there weren’t any bugs on the moss. I waited and waited and finally heard the crunching of footsteps coming towards me. I was up on the side of a small rise and crunch, crunch, here comes somebody. I’m figuring it’s Randy. The person was not walking fast. It was just a steady stepping up the hill. So, I closed my eyes like, ‘Yeah, you took so long I fell asleep.’ I hear the crunching steps come closer and the moss disturbed as someone puts their foot on it. I’m expecting Randy to say something. Zo Walked Up in Kentucky Forest He didn't and I opened my eyes. There was this guy standing there. I was surprised, but I wasn’t afraid. I was never afraid by people I met. He (Zo) was maybe a little taller than me. He had an athletic build, but not overly muscular. IN 1966, HOW TALL WERE YOU? I grew from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet 2 inches in about five months, so I was about 6 feet 2 inches. HE WAS A LITTLE TALLER THAN YOU? Ye s . TODAY, WHAT IS YOUR FULL GROWN HEIGHT? 2.04 meters (80.5 inches), which is 6 feet 8.5 inches. SKIN COLOR? Just like mine, pale. It was not tanned. His hair was long, touching his shoulders and maybe a little bit below. It was a sandy-blond colored hair and mostly straight. I didn’t see any curl to it at all. I remember that he looked like he might be from Europe because he had features that were different from anyone who lived around our region of Kentucky. HIGH CHEEK BONES? Pronounced, but not overly pronounced. He had incredibly blue eyes. His skin"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"was very clear. You didn’t see any pores – just a smooth complexion. Didn’t look like he ever needed to shave. WHAT BLUE WOULD WE KNOW THAT MATCHES HIS EYES? Blue topaz. A darker blue than the sky, or like a blue LED light – a very clear, but intense, blue. The eyes didn’t shine, but they were that kind of blue. WHAT WAS HE WEARING? WAS THERE ANYTHING LIKE A PATCH OR INSIGNIA? I don’t remember that there was any kind of patch or insignia. There was nothing that looked like a zipper. There were no seams. It was one continuous piece that started at his neck and went down to his wrists and across his abdomen down his legs. There were not any boots like you would think go on over feet. Instead, the leg coverings continued on down around his feet, but there were soles at the bottom of his feet where shoes would have been. SO IT WAS ONE CONTINUOUS JUMP SUIT THAT EVEN INCLUDED THE FEET THE WAY WE DRESS YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE WINTER TIME IN ONE-PIECE SUITS? Right, but this material would be very similar to Lycra. It just sucked right up to him. VERY TIGHT TO THE BODY? Ye s . WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THAT GARMENT? It was kind of a wheat beige-brown color. U sing one of the blond illustrations from my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses, William modified it to more closely match the beige colors that Zo wore. William: “This is like Zo, except the eyes are too large and his hair was more swept back, no bangs.” Illustration © 2008 by William. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"He had a belt on with a blue light that flashed occasionally that looked like a modern LED light. WHAT DID THE BUCKLE LOOK LIKE? It kind of looked like the way buckles on backpacks push and twist together. WHAT PART WAS GLOWING LED BLUE? Right in the center of the buckle was a little spot, a small light. Here I am just sweating, so hot, and here is this guy dressed in long shirt, long pants. He looked ridiculous to me walking around like that in the heat, but he was not sweating. I said, ‘Who are you?’ He smiled and said, ‘My name is Zo. Do you mind if I rest here a minute? I would like to talk with you.’ He didn’t sound like he was speaking with a European accent. He sounded like anyone else I had spoken with in my life. He was very clear. I said, ‘Sure, have a seat.’ So, he sat down across from me cross-legged on the moss. I asked, ‘Where are you from?’ He said, ‘I’m from quite a ways from here.’ I asked, ‘Why are you here?’ He said, ‘Well, I came here to see you, William.’ I said, ‘Wow! You know who I am?’ He said, ‘Yes, I do. But don’t worry. I don’t mean you any harm. I just wanted to come visit with you for a few minutes, if you don’t mind.’ I said, ‘No, that’s fine. I’m expecting my friend, Randy, to show up.’ He said, ‘Well, I’m sure I’ll be gone before Randy arrives. It might not be a good idea if Randy saw me here. He might not understand.’ I didn’t know what Zo was referring to. I look people in the eyes when I’m talking to people and studying details about them. I wanted to know where Zo was from and I asked him again. He said, ‘I’m from another world, actually.’ ‘Which one?’ He said he was from a place called ‘Lanulose.' (Zo, upon first meeting Michael, said his planet is Lanulose that orbits around the star Tau Ceti.)’ I asked him how far away that was and Zo said, ‘It’s quite a distance. But don’t worry, I’m no different than anyone else you’ll ever meet in the world. Some people are from different parts of this country. Some people are from other parts of the world. They didn’t travel as far as I’ve traveled, but we’re all just people. And people are people wherever you go.’ He laughed. He told me he wanted to see how I was, that I probably did not remember, but that he had met me a long time ago when I was just a small child. He had an interest to make sure I was all right. I told him, ‘No, I don’t remember you.’ He said, ‘That’s fine. You can visit with me any time that you want to when I come back.’ I asked, ‘How did you get here?’ He said, ‘I flew in and I’ll be flying back out again.’ ‘What did you fly on?’ He said what he flew on was down further in the woods where it won’t be found."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"‘I want to see it.’ He said, ‘No, you can’t see it right now.’ So, I’m thinking, ‘This guy is full of it.’ But I did realize after a certain point that I was thinking things and he was just answering me (telepathically). By the time he left – and I’m guessing he was there only about 30 minutes – we were not really speaking. It was just going back and forth mentally pretty rapidly. At the time, I wasn’t familiar with the concept of telepathy and it’s like I went into a very dream-like state. I was not dreaming, but it’s kind of like the way I do healing now. I go into an altered state of consciousness. That’s what was happening then. He said that he would be back. ‘Be listening, because I will let you know when I arrive.’ I asked, ‘How will I know?’ Zo said, ‘It will be unmistakable.’ He got up and walked away and told me just to stay there. After awhile, I snapped out of it and said, ‘Why the heck am I sitting here? I should be following that guy.’ So, I took off running. Then I heard a buzzing noise that did not sound like anything I’d ever heard before. It was away from me and above me, but I could not see anything. Then it went away quite rapidly. And Randy never did show up! I waited as long as I could, but knew if I waited too long, I would miss supper. Then I’d be in trouble, so I took off. That was on a Sunday sometime in the middle of July in 1966. THIS WAS THE FIRST MEETING WITH ZO AND YOU DID NOT GET TO ENTER THE CRAFT AND GO WITH HIM THEN? No, not until later. About Two Weeks Later in 1965: “Morse Code” in the Night WHAT WAS THE NEXT TIME YOU GOT TO SEE ZO CONSCIOUSLY? As far as I know, I always saw him consciously. But they have a tendency to put you into a different head space when you are around them. The next time I saw Zo was about two or three weeks later in the middle of the night and I heard what sounded like Morse code, but it was very fast. I’m trying to figure out where I’m hearing this from and I walked all through the house. It was quite late. Walking around in that small house was something that brought attention to myself and I was ordered back to bed. I asked my parents if they could hear the Morse code and they couldn’t. Then the Morse code stopped and I was very puzzled. I stayed awake and about an hour later, I heard the Morse code sound again, louder. So, I figured it was not in the house. It must be outside, so I felt like I just had to get out of the house. I got up and went quietly out the back door towards the out house. I could still hear the beeping code and headed off for the field. That’s where Zo was parked, in the middle of the field behind some trees. Silver Disc On Ground WHAT WERE YOU SEEING? It was a disk on the ground. WHAT SHAPE, COLOR, SIZE? It was a dark night, so I don’t know that it had color, but it wasn’t shiny. It was a brushed metallic look, whatever it was – like brushed aluminum sort of. It was not highly polished or reflective. The size, I would compare it to two cars parked end-too-end. We had a 1958 Chevrolet and I remember it was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"about two of those end-to-end. WOULD THAT BE 25 FEET IN DIAMETER? Probably, maybe even 30 feet. HOW HIGH? I don’t know how high it was. The edge of it was taller than I was, so I would say maybe 12 feet high. 30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 12 FEET HIGH? Maybe taller than 12 feet because when I went inside it was big enough to stand in and look up at the ceiling. WAS THE SHAPE LIKE AN EGG OR LENS? Like a lens on the side. The egg-shaped one showed up much later, probably during the winter. The disk was bigger though, and could hold four or five people easily. The others were smaller and could hold only two people, maybe. IN THE DISK, WHO IS WITH YOU AND WHAT HAPPENED? Before I ever got to the disk, I saw movement and Zo came from behind the craft and greeted me about 40 feet from the disk. We just stood there talking. He said that was what he had traveled in, that there were larger ones and smaller ones. The whole visit lasted a short amount of time. I didn't go inside one of Zo's craft until a year later (in 1966). Astronomy Lesson Then Zo started pointing out different stars and telling me what they were. He was trying to get me to understand where we are placed in the solar system and universe. He got me really fired up and I wanted to learn everything I could about astronomy and planets and the stars so the next time I saw him, I could tell him something. It was a brief encounter. Zo told me he could not stay long, but he wanted to see if I would come over and say hello and he was really happy that I did. I asked him how he was doing and he said he was doing fine. He said there was a lot of work to do and that he had things he had to do in other parts of the Earth. I asked, ‘Well, can we just take off and you can show me?’ He said he could not do that because if something happened and I did not get back home in time, then we would both be in trouble. I knew my step dad would beat me if I weren’t in the house when everybody woke up. I'm not sure why Zo would be in trouble, though. We walked around the disc. He put his hands on it and I put my hands on it and it felt cool, but not cold. It was towards the end of July and hot outside. DID IT FEEL LIKE GLASS OR METAL OR WHAT? That’s the weird thing. It kind of felt like glass, but it looked like metal. It had an incredibly smooth feeling to it. If you had your eyes closed, you would think it was glass. But with eyes open, it looked like metal. I could not find a seam on it anywhere. I rubbed my hands on it. The edges of the disc went underneath and it was just smooth – no lines or seams or anything. It was not sitting on tripod legs or any legs. It was just sitting on the ground. Danger Around Discs DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS PHYSICALLY BETWEEN THE CRAFT AND THE ENVIRONMENT THAT CAUSES TREES TO MOVE SO WILDLY?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"There might be a clue in what Zo said when it was time for him to leave. He stood outside and instructed me to go back where I’d been away from the disc as fast as I could. So, I took off running to about 200 feet from the disc. He waved good-bye and said he would be back. He walked around behind the disc and a kind of buzz went through me. The disc just lifted right up. As the disc lifted up, the trees were moving like wind was hitting them. Some leaves were flying off the trees, but there was no wind. The next thing you know, Zo was just gone! Apparently what is happening is that the disc is creating a strong field around it that has a charge that causes things to be repelled or pulled towards it. I know on many occasions I was warned that if I saw the discs coming down to stay away a good distance and then they would let me know when it was safe to come up to the craft. Also, they would not leave until I was far enough away because I’d be hurt by the rising craft. On one occasion, my dog was back there with me and when the disc took off, the dog ran back in that direction and the dog looked like it had been kicked by a horse. He was yipping and screaming and took off down into the woods. That dog never went with me back into the woods again after that.” C ontinued in: Part 3 - Inside A Craft More Information: For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive: • 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada • 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky • 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport • 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenville, Texas, Region • 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas • 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” • 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO • 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO • 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO • 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO • 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White Sands Provi ng Ground. • 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO • 09/16/2007 — Part 5: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/11/2007 — Part 4: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/07/2007 — Part 3: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/05/2007 — Part 2: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/30/2007 — Part 1: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings • 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer? • 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long Triangular Craft? • 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site • 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda • 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
