It has straw-colored front and back images of a crucified man with blood colored wounds and dozens of scourge marks similar to whips used two thousand years ago. It's as if the linen shroud had been wrapped around the man's body from the feet up over the head and back down to the feet after the blood had clotted. The body images are also bracketed the entire length of the cloth by parallel burn and scorch marks from fire damage suffered in 1532. The Shroud images were photographed in 1931 and 1978. In the authoritative and well-illustrated book, The Blood and The Shroud by Ian Wilson, positive and negative photographs of the head and body clearly show rivulets of blood on the head and lash marks and larger blood stains on the body.

Right , blood stain pattern on the Cloth of Oviedo, allegedly the small cloth placed over Jesus Christ's face after death. The Cloth of Oviedo has been kept in a church drawer in Oviedo, Spain for centuries. In 1978, a team of thirty U. S. scientists, many from the Jet Propulsion Lab in California, came together for the Shroud of Turin Research Project (STURP). The Archbishop at the Cathedral of Turin in Torino, Italy where the Shroud was housed from 1694 to 1993 gave permission for STURP to study the Shroud. Photographic and spectroscopic examinations were made and over thirty sticky-tape samples representative of the body images, blood stains and non-image areas were taken. The STURP team concluded that the Shroud is not a painting. Later in 1980, STURP asked Alan D. Adler, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, Connecticut to do analyses on a small fragment from the sticky-tape samples lifted from the Shroud blood stains. Between 1980 and 1999, Dr. Adler has tested for porphyrin fluorescence, done a series of wet chemistry tests, immunological tests and two different kinds of spectroscopy. He concludes that what he has studied is \"primate blood, and that's being very cautious. Anybody, if it were for any other than the Shroud of Turin, would simply say you tested for human and you found it. But I can't prove - no scientists can - that it's the blood of Jesus Christ crucified in Jerusalem two thousand years ago.\" On May 23, 1999, Dr. Adler was one of the guests on a special three hour Dreamland program I hosted about analyses of the Shroud of Turin, including blood stain fragments and comments about the Cloth of Oviedo pictured in this report and the positive and negative images of the head on the Shroud of Turin. The following are excerpts from an interview with Dr. Adler: Interview: Shroud Blood Tests \"What do you mean when you say you did an immunological test? It means that you take something that is antigenic and you put it into an animal that is not human -- a rabbit, an egg, something - and you make an antibody to it. You then take the protein or the mixture that you want to test and see if you get what is called an antibody antigen reaction. There's all sorts of ways to find out if this is positive. Sometimes it's tagged with material. Sometimes you look for a precipitate. Sometimes you look for what is called an agglutination test. I won't go into all those kinds of details, but what you are looking for is you've got some kind of material and you want to see if you can get a reaction to the so-called antibody which has been developed in another system. All right, now you have two kinds of problems here. One, there are kinds of things because they're genetically similar will also give a response. So, if I say I have a positive test for human antibody, you get the same thing from chimp,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"from gorilla, from orangutan. And unless you run a very specific test, you have no way to tell the difference. You certainly don't in the kinds of materials we are testing on the Shroud. The other kind of thing you have is -- what are the kinds of things that serve as antigens? There are two types of material that serve as antigens: one are proteins. These are what we call polypeptides. The other thing is that there are a lot of proteins that we call glycol proteins. These are proteins that at one end of the protein have a long stretch of what we think of as poly sugar, saccharide The most common test we think of to test somebody's blood type are for proteins where what's being identified is not any of the protein structure, but the sugar structure. The problem is those kinds of polysaccharides are frequently found as contaminants in bacterial cell walls. And so, if you have a material that you're not sure is free of bacterial contaminants, you may get a positive test that has nothing to do with the presence of the protein you're looking for. Unfortunately the blood type proteins, the common ones, and the globin that Dr. Baima Bollone tested fall in that class. So, a lot of people said he was looking at bacterial cell wall debris. This was for the AB Negative blood test? This was for the AB Negative test. (Torino, Italy in 1981, reported AB Negative blood type on Shroud blood stain.) And that's when I decided if I was going to repeat an immunological test, I would test for one that did NOT have a glyco group attached. That's serum albumin, that's very specific. And I would test for whole blood. This is everything that's in there, in the serum. This is hemoglobin, albumin, everything. And that would sort of confirm that my albumin test, the control on it. So, I ran those two tests and both of those were positive. Well, those two tests coupled with his (Dr. Bollone's) two tests make it very clear we have a right to say that we have taken blood samples from the Shroud of Turin, two different investigators, and shown clear cut evidence that there is certainly some type of primate blood in those samples. And that's being very cautious. Anybody who did work on anything other than the Shroud of Turin would simply say that you tested for human and you found it. I also ran chimp controls. And in fact, the chimp control was just a little bit weaker in this surface precipitant fluorescence test I ran than the human sample. And so, I'm not in a rush to say -- it was human. But if you press me, I tell people, \"Well, look at the image it was taken from. If you think this is a shaved orangutan, go ahead!\" Most people would not hesitate to say what we got is positive human test. Cloth of Oviedo: We have another relic that is claimed to be associated with Christ's crucifixion called the Cloth of Oviedo which is kept in northern Spain. THAT IS ALSO REFERRED TO AS THE SUDARIUM. As the sudarium, right. And it supposedly was put over Christ's face when he was taken down from the cross like a modesty cloth. WHEN HE WAS TAKEN FROM THE CROSS, SOMEONE PUT A CLOTH ON HIS FACE? Yes, we have no idea how far back this custom goes, when it originated with who. But lots of cultures have practiced this. We do. When somebody pronounces somebody dead, what do the attendants do? They pull the blanket over the guy's head. When someone sees there is a death, someone puts something over his face. It's known this kind of thing goes back through all kinds of cultures through all kinds of times. So, it's not surprising that it might have been something practiced at the time of the crucifixion. All right, so this was alleged to have done that and we have to surmise this was taken off before he (crucified man) was put in the Shroud because there is no image on this cloth. It's just blood marks."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Now, it turns out that the Spaniards who have done a lot of work on this cloth and have shown the marks on that cloth (Oviedo) are real blood-derived material, just like I've shown and Bollone and some other people have shown the blood marks on the Shroud are blood-derived material. And in fact, these are not cloths on free-flowing wounds. What they are are impressions of clotted blood. This was very unusual. Artists don't usually show painted images of clotted blood. And forensically and chemically and all sorts of ways we can demonstrate this in fact is exudate from a blood clot. The Spaniards have done the same thing on the Cloth of Oviedo. The problem is the Cloth of Oviedo can be viewed as divided into three panels. They put the middle panel over the face. They folded the other third over it, so you have sort of mirrored image set of blots. You've got blood through the middle panel and into the other side panel. And then the other panel was put behind the back of the head. Now, there are wounds on the back of the head in very complex patterns. Not just spots. There are W's, L's and Y's. The photographs show that in my article. (\"Updating Recent Studies on the Shroud of Turin\" © 1996 by Alan D. Adler, Ph.D., American Chemical Society.) Dr. Al Wanger (M.D., Psychiatry, Duke University) showed that those two patterns in the polarizing overlay technique of his are identical on the Shroud and on the Cloth of Oviedo. And if you look carefully, you can see that the Oviedo Cloth is less dark on the edges. That's just what you would expect because if the Oviedo Cloth is the one that went on the wounds first, it would have blotted up some of the blood on the edges. So, in fact we cannot only show these two patterns are congruent, but we can show which one went on which piece of cloth first. On top of that because they are clot wounds, they show what are known as serum contraction effects. When a wound clots, the fibrin pulls through materials in the blood, the solid materials, into the wound to make the scab. And it leaves a rim of serum around the wounds. And those serum rings show up very easily in ultraviolet emission. And in the ultraviolet photography that was done on the Shroud, we can see these serum contraction rings around every single blood wound on the Shroud of Turin. So, this also tells you someone did not paint it.\" More Information: Scientists and doctors from around the world will gather in Richmond, Virginia on June 18th, 1999 for a Shroud of Turin International Research Conference. The press release states: \"The cause of the Shroud's image is still unknown. It's most definitely not a painting. It's an enigma, a very important one, since if the image on it is really the likeness of Jesus of Nazareth, then the Shroud of Turin contains the only authentic description of him that exists.\" Conference topics will range from chemistry and blood analyses to the hypothesis that the Shroud images were created by radiation such as x-ray frequencies emanating from wi thi n the bones and teeth outward through the skin into the linen cloth.
