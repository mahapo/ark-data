R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 18 February 24, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - At the end of Part 18, of my June 29, 1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home, he was talking about the Wackenhut security firm that worked with the CIA in the 1950s. It was also Wackenhut in Coral Gables, Florida, that his phone manager friend told him [ See Stein Earthfiles Part ] was the source of the first call to Stein warning him not to talk with me further about the name of the southeastern military base or its activities during the Cuba stand-off with the Soviet Union or its alleged assassin squad assigned to termination missions. During his work for the Army/CIA unit that studied real UFO Blue Book cases, Stein said, “We could call Wackenhut for background checks on civilians coming to do work. Wackenhut is a worldwide security firm with offices in Europe.” Before I left Stein's home on July 1, 1998, he and I agreed that we would work together on a book and he would tell his whole Army/CIA story again on videotape for possible use in a documentary for television that I would produce. I had traveled to his home without anyone knowing my destination and after I left, I traveled to another destination for a 4th of July holiday before returning to my Philadelphia office. After my visit and long, recorded audio interview with Stein, neither of us expected that Wackenhut and/or CIA agents would turn up more menacingly in his life. I returned to my Philadelphia home base on July 5, 1998, to find the following voice mail left by Stein on July 3, 1998: Stein Phone Voice Mail: “ Yes, Linda, Stein calling. I have had visitors from either Wackenhut or the CIA that followed me to the grocery store and then talked with me outside the grocery store in the parking lot. They definitely do not want me to go ahead with anything further with you in regard to the issues they mentioned. And they told me the reason why, concerning the southeastern military base identification. So, I would say hold up on everything. “One thing they did was threaten. They had photographs of my son at his marine work, going to work and in his car. They mentioned to me that it would be a shame for him to have an accident at such a young age, and he is just 30. So, I think what I need to do is hold off on everything as far as doing anything for a book, radio or anything. My wife does not know this yet, so "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"would appreciate it if you would not mention this to her at all if you call here. We are leaving this afternoon for a trip up north and I’ll try to get hold of you again from up north.” A month later on August 7, 1998, Stein had returned with his wife to their southeastern home and he replied to a voice mail I had left on his home phone to please call me when he could for more discussion about the threat at the supermarket. August 7, 1998 Phone Call About Supermarket Threat Linda Moulton Howe: “CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AFTER I LEFT YOUR HOME AND YOU WERE GOING TO THE SUPERMARKET? Stein: Yeah, after you left, I noticed for a couple of days that I was followed by a Spanish-looking fellow in a car. I went grocery shopping the day before and he would be by the prescription counter where he was using the blood pressure machine there. But as soon as I left, he would come out again and drive down to the next block past our house. I noticed that action and thought, ‘This guy is tailing me.’ Then the next day, I went to the store and parked in a shady spot on the street so I had a ways to walk. Then I was walking and got about half way to the store when I saw the same guy get out of a car in the store parking lot with another person. They walked toward me and as I got closer to them, one of them said to me, ‘We would like to have a word with you.’ I said, ‘OK, what’s the problem?’ He said, ‘We have been sent over here’ – I assumed they meant from Coral Gables and Wackenhut – ‘to talk with you.’ The first thing he said was, ‘We think we know who you were, as far as your CIA name. And we know that you have a lot of background from WWII on up as far as your knowledge. We would like to talk to you about that.’ They leaned against the trunk of a nearby car very casually. It was not their car. DID THEY GIVE YOU THE NAME THEY HAD FOR YOU IN THE CIA TO PROVE THEY KNEW? No. DID THEY SHOW YOU ANY IDENTIFICATION? No, they never did. I asked them, ‘Who are you and where are you from?’ But they would not tell me. They said that the government has been watching a number of people in regard to old classified material. They said that they understood the classified agreement that people like me signed back after the war that were supposed to apply for 30 or 35 years and the time was up on those agreements - they had expired. But then they said they wanted to explain to me why they wanted to keep the southeastern military base out of the public. They did show me photographs of the little airport I once knew there, but it was all changed from the way it was when I was there in the 1950s. The photos they showed me were of a place much bigger, if that was the same place. DID THEY EXPLAIN WHY THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE TODAY? Yes. They showed me a ground-to-air defense that they had there in the southeastern U. S. MISSILES? Not missiles, but the new ‘Star Wars weapons,’ they said. I did see one building that had a roof that would retract so they could shoot upward from inside the building. WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WEAPONS ARE? I think they are particle beam weapons where they can shoot a satellite down from the ground. I think that is probably what it was. I asked them if it was a particle beam weapon and the men told me it was a ‘highly advanced system.’ They said that particle beam had something to do with it, but it was far more advanced than that. One guy said, ‘Anything coming in from the Atlantic Ocean, we can take care of, even in outer space, with this weapon.’ They said some people had tried to get into the area to see and had been killed. One was a Russian and one was someone from the United States. They said, ‘This is the reason we need to keep this secret because we have other bases in various other strategic parts of the country that are able to do the same thing as far as shoot down something from outer space."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I asked, ‘Have you been shooting down any saucer vehicles and aliens with this weapon?’ And those Wackenhut types told me they had. DID YOU ASK WHY? No. I asked if the aliens were aggressive or did something in that area of the country where you would shoot them down. And the men said, ‘Yes, there were some incidents involving some deaths that had been kept secret.’ Those craft were the ones they had shot down. MEANING INCIDENTS IN WHICH ALIENS HAD KILLED HUMANS? Yes, apparently. When the alien craft took off, the government units had gotten the word and went after them. Plus, in the photos of the airstrip, I also saw black helicopters on the runway and also black trucks. IN THE PHOTOS THE MEN SHOWED YOU? Yes. And those helicopters and black trucks are retrieval equipment if a saucer crashes or they shoot one down. Then they go out and retrieve it and bring it back to that southeastern military base. DID THEY EXPLAIN WHY ALL THIS WAS HOUSED IN THAT PARTICULAR MILITARY BASE? Because it’s a strategic point for the southeastern U. S. They can cover with the weapon most of the Florida area and southeastern U. S. And then there are other weapons placed around other parts of the country. DID THEY SAY THEY HAVE USED THE ADVANCED WEAPONS TO SHOOT DOWN DISCS AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO? No, they didn’t say a timeline. They did say they had worked with the Russians who had the same equipment and that the Russians have shot down several craft, including a very large craft. DID THE MEN SAY WHICH TYPE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL THEY ARE SHOOTING DOWN? No, they didn’t and I asked them if it was the 6-fingered extraterrestrials? Or the Greys? And they told me they could not release that information. DID THEY GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES? No, they just said they had two craft that did something aggressively and after the saucer craft took off and started flying somewhere else around the area, the military base unit used the advanced weapon to shoot the craft down. DID YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS WAS RECENT HISTORY? He said that the U. S. has had that defense down there for a number of years and the Star Wars thing happened in the 1980s. So, it was not ancient history. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS? Yes, probably the last ten years. Anyway, the men said that we had to keep this secret and they said, ‘We know that you probably don’t care that much for yourself, being your age and bad health. But I know that you are very close to your son.’ Then they showed photographs of my son going to work where he lives in Florida and getting into his car after work and the apartment where he lives – getting out of his car and headed for his apartment. The men said, ‘We know you are very close to your son and it would be a shame - if you could not keep this under wraps – if something were to happen to him.’ THAT IS SO BELOW THE BELT! Yeah! And I told them it would be awful. I told them that I have not in the past disclosed anything. I said, ‘You have probably monitored the radio program (I did with you [Linda] on Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell) and that all the sensitive issues were left out. And they told me, ‘Yes, that was really appreciated because that really helped us out.’ DID THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD PERSONALLY AND SPECIFICALLY HONORED THE DELETIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, and they said, ‘Linda had taken care of this in a very professional manner.’ GOOD. I’M TRYING TO DO MY WORK RESPONSIBLY AND THIS IS WHY I WANT SO MUCH TO KEEP GOING FORWARD WITH OUR PROJECT AND I STILL DON’T SEE THAT ANYTHING IS CHANGED OR AFFECTED AS LONG AS I HONOR THE EXCLUSION OF DETAILS ABOUT THE SOUTHEASTERN BASE. The men also told me they knew about my experience in Washington, D. C. and CIA headquarters. They repeated again, ‘We are pretty sure we know who you were as far as what name you used in the CIA. We know you did not use your real name in the CIA.’ DID YOU ASK THEM WHAT NAME THEY HAD? Yes, I said, ‘Who am I?’ (laughs) The men said, ‘We can’t disclose that, but we are quite sure that we have found your group.’ He told me that all the 20 some members of my CIA group were all dead, including the leader (Anthony Barden), who died on the job in the 1970s. The men said that we were all dead and that correlated with what I told you about how I got out of the CIA with Anthony’s working with the police to get a dead, derelict body that he had my CIA identification placed on that went with a death certificate. SO, THOSE MEN IN THE PARKING LOT WERE SHOCKED - WHEN I DID THE INTERVIEW WITH YOU THAT WAS BROADCAST ON THE RADIO - TO LEARN YOU WERE ACTUALLY ALIVE? Yes. And the men said that my CIA group with all the WWII knowledge, ‘As far as we know, the ones that had this knowledge, even in military service, have all died of old age or died in various accidents.’ Linda, note their use of the word ‘accidents.’ (laughs) DID THE TWO MEN LEANING AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE CAR AT THE SUPERMARKET MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE GERMAN-NAZI-DISC CONNECTION TO ALL THIS? No, they didn’t. They just mentioned that they knew I had knowledge of the WWII files. DID THE MEN MENTION ANY INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL INFORMATION AND USE THAT TERM, ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL’? No. They didn’t even use the term ‘extraterrestrial’ when they said that we had shot down a couple of the saucer vehicles. They said, ‘We appreciate your silence on this thing and we hope that you won’t be broadcasting anymore or doing any other work over the air or in writing pertaining to this whole WWII and southeastern military base situation.’ I asked them what they knew about my health and one of them said, ‘Your diabetes is very bad.’ (laughs) That is true, so they did get my medical records some how. You know when you try to get insurance, the insurance companies can pull up medical records and find out just exactly what illnesses you have and then they won’t insure you. So, there has to be some system just like a bank and credit reports, but for medical that intelligence agents can get access to. DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT GO FORWARD ON THE E. T. INFORMATION? Well, they did tie that in, which was the biggest part of what you and I were going to write about and videotape, from WWII on up. Ironically, my knowledge of the extraterrestrial situation wasn’t really that great in terms of firsthand knowledge, except for the trip to Area 51 with Anthony Barden and some of our group. WE HAVE ALREADY PUT ALL THAT OUT ON THE RADIO, SO I DON’T SEE WHY I CAN’T DEVELOP WHAT I’VE ALREADY BROADCAST AND DO MY OWN RESEARCH AND STILL DO THIS WITH YOU? Anything you do, they’ll know you got it from me! THE ONLY PART THEY HAVE DEFINED THAT IS RELEVANT TO A CLASSIFICATION ISSUE IS THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. THE WORLD WAR II STUFF FROM LONG AGO EXPIRED NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT DATES. NAZI FILES ARE BEING OPENED MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS. SO, I THINK THE MEN TRYING TO INTIMIDATE YOU ARE OUT OF LINE TRYING TO KEEP YOU FROM TALKING ABOUT WWII HISTORY."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT I WILL PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR NAME, LOCATION AND THE NAME OF THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. Yes, their main worry is public discussion about the base. I ALREADY HAVE PROVED I KEPT THAT NAME OUT OF MY RADIO BROADCAST. I DON’T THINK THAT INTIMIDATION SHOULD BE APPLIED HERE. Well, at the end of the conversation, the two men referred again to the state of my ill health and to my son. They told me they knew he had done very well in college and had a promising career. I VERY MUCH RESENT THAT KIND OF INTIMIDATION - INDIRECTLY THREATENING FAMILY MEMBERS INSTEAD OF YOU DIRECTLY. I do, too. Just as they were getting ready to leave, they put the photos and information they had back into an envelope they took with them. I told them that I hoped they had a good trip back to Coral Gables. And they said, ‘We wish we had some of the older people who were in the beginning of this whole CIA thing. They were very sharp people and we don’t have people of that caliber in this day and age.’ They said they thought they had done so well for thirty-five years because no one had come forward to try to blast out the truth. But such discretion would not happen today, they said - some individual would try to sell information to the Russians or to one of the tabloid newspapers – giving government secrets away. The car they were leaning against was not their car. They had walked across the parking lot, so when they left, they went down the parking lot again and further down to get into their car. Way on the other side of the parking lot, I could not see their license plate numbers, but it was a Chrysler, 4-door, black. REMEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DO - EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE KEPT POSTHUMOUSLY - AND THAT IS TO PUT ON VIDEOTAPE YOUR TELLING IN YOUR OWN WORDS YOUR AREA 51 AND OTHER EXPERIENCES. I HAVE SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO RUN CAMERA FOR ME FREE OF CHARGE, AND I REALLY THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT TO DO – TO GET ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE ON AN AUDIO-VISUAL RECORD. Well, you have all the audiotapes, right? YES, BUT IT’S NOT AS STRONG AS A VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT BY YOU. AND I KNOW OUR GOVERNMENT MAKES VIDEOTAPES WITH INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES FOR POSTHUMOUS RECORD AS WELL. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO HAVE YOU BE ON VIDEOTAPE. WE CAN DRAW UP AN AGREEMENT THAT YOU APPROVE THE RECORDING, NOT FOR USE IN YOUR LIFE TIME, BUT CAN BE USED BY LINDA MOULTON HOWE UPON YOUR DEATH, OR HOWEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE WORDED. Yes, that would make sense. I CAN WORK WITH THE CAMERAMAN IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OF SEPTEMBER, SO PLEASE CONSIDER DOING A POSTHUMOUS RECORD. YOU NEED TO BE PRESERVED ON VIDEOTAPE. WE DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS AT YOUR HOUSE. WE CAN SET UP IN A CONVENIENT PLACE NOT FAR FROM YOUR HOME. IT’S IMPORTANT FOR HISTORY. Yes, I probably don’t have that long to live and I would like to get my story recorded accurately. LET’S NOT TALK ABOUT ARRANGEMENTS ON THE PHONE FROM NOW ON. I WILL MAKE SOME WRITTEN ARRANGEMENTS AND MAIL DETAILS, IF DETAILS ARE OK WITH YOU. You haven’t had your mail opened? NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. IF IT HAS BEEN OPENED, I’M NOT AWARE. I USE A POST OFFICE BOX. Well, I know from my own experience that we in the CIA used to be very good at getting mail open without detection!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CAN THEY GET TO FED EX? I think they can get to almost anything they want to. WELL, I PROVED TO THEM ON THE AIR THAT I COOPERATED. I feel that the way things operated years ago, once you declared on the radio that your phone has been tapped, maybe they untapped it for a certain period of time. BEFORE I TALKED WITH YOU, I HAVE HAD PREVIOUS CONFIRMATIONS THAT MY PHONE IN VARIOUS PLACES I HAVE LIVED HAS BEEN TAPPED. GOVERNMENT AGENTS PROBABLY THINK IT'S CORNY AS HELL, BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, I AM SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED AS A JOURNALIST BY THE 1ST AMENDMENT OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION TO WORK FREELY AND REPORT WHATEVER NEWS I CAN. AND EXTRATERRESRIALS AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO EXIST, ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT’S OFFICIAL POLICY OF DENIAL. SO HOW CAN YOU OR I BE VIOLATING ANY NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE BY TALKING ABOUT THAT? SO, IF IT’S OK WITH YOU, I AM GOING TO PROCEED WITH ARRANGEMENTS AND THEN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU BY THE MAIL. AND YOU LET ME KNOW BY MAIL IF ALL IS OK. I should have written to you originally about my information rather than talking to you on the phone [ May 2 and 7, 1998]. It never dawned on me that your phone line would be tapped! [ See Stein Earthfiles Part 2 .] I thought I knew that my phone would not be. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THE FIRST TIME I TALKED WITH YOU THE BEGINNING OF MAY 1998, WHY WOULD ANYBODY HAVE BEEN LISTENING? NOBODY KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU. That's right. So, they must have equipment that records as soon as you pick up your phone. MEANING, THEY HAVE BEEN TAPPING ME ON A REGULAR BASIS BEFORE I EVER CALLED YOU. Yes. And with those men in the supermarket parking lot, they did not deny they were going back to Coral Gables, which is Wackenhut. And my phone company friend already confirmed it was Wackenhut who called me the first time with the phone threat. And when I was in the Army and CIA, Wackenhut was already going with intelligence information. The FBI used to have big files on everybody during the Senator McCarthy era. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14, 1908 – May 2, 1957) was an American politician who served as a Republican U.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period of intense anti-communist suspicion inspired by the tensions of the Cold War. He was noted for making claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside the American federal government. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led him to be discredited and censured by the United States Senate. The term ‘McCarthyism,’ coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar anti-communist pursuits.”] The courts made the FBI destroy all that stuff because they weren't supposed to be keeping records on American citizens. But what the FBI did was destroy some of the older stuff, so they could show mounds of documents and files being shredded. But most of the FBI files from the McCarthy time were shipped to Wackenhut. And in the 1950s, we in the CIA used Wackenhut when we wanted to check on a certain person or company to see what their background was - to see if we could trust them with classified material. We would get a print out from Wackenhut. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN AND I WILL CORRESPOND. OK, I'll be waiting for it.” C ontinued in Part 20 - Final threat.
