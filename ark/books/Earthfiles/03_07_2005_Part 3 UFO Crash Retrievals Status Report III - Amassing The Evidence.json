Here begins Part 3 of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \" Fred Schaefer's report on KA's aftermath: Since 1954, when this incident allegedly occurred, KA has been having intermittent nightmares about his experience in the desert. During the year 1981, these nightmares have grown in intensity and frequency, causing KA much anguish. During the lecture at Edmund Scientific Company in March, KA saw his opportunity to reveal details of his UFO retrieval experience to someone who would lend an understanding ear; thereby helping to alleviate his mental torment. Leonard Stringfield: During a long chat on December 10, 1981, KA told me with vocal sincerity, 'I was taught to tell the truth,' as he related details of his experience, some confirming what the Schaefer report related, and others new to me. I felt that KA was telling it as it was. Describing the crash scene, he said: 'I thought I was in a set in Hollywood.' But fantasy was soon dashed, he said, because of the terrible stench in the crash area and watching one of his buddy's regurgitate. The stench, he said, was like battery acid and ammonia. Other details follow: 1) While KA's chopper was still at the crash site, a second chopper landed. At least four men got out wearing white pants and long white coats. KA tried to take a picture of one o the new arrivals, but was told angrily, 'Don't take a picture of me. Just take what you were told to take.' The second chopper landed much closer than KA's, scattering sand from its prop-wash. 2) While KA was taking pictures of the saucer on the ground, he saw a silver or aluminum-colored metallic box on the ground about 3 feet long and 1 1/2 feet high with numbers printed on it. There were also words printed on the box which were indistinguishable. He tried to take pictures of the box, but was stopped by a member of the ground crew and told, 'Get the hell away from that.' (Comment by Len Stringfield: Probably a detector device.) 3) All members of the ground crew wore green fatigues with no insignia or rank identity. 4) There were four or five large dogs on leashes by the trucks. 5) The pilot of the chopper also vomited. He was pale like a ghost for several days. 6) I asked how many rolls of film he took. KA's answer: Four canisters, two large; a total of 36 exposures. The camera was turret-mounted and looked like an accordion. ULTRA-F-5 was the filter used, not the camera. He was instructed to take pictures from all angles on and above the ground. However, he was told to take more pictures from the ground. He was also told to use all the film. These instructions came over the intercom. He was also instructed to leave the film on the chopper when they landed. The officer in charge stayed "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"onboard after they landed. 7) KA would not disclose the names of the fellow members of Rescue Team 4. Following our talks in December, KA told me with concern that he had been reminded by phone, and more surprisingly, by a stranger he encountered in his neighborhood drugstore, that he should not talk about his part of the retrieval operation. Again, he was called and warned of consequences following a phone call I made in January 1982. COMMENT: KA's torment over his long-ago experience is obvious and so is his fear of reprisal, which is shared by his wife. Although vague on certain issues such as his hospitalization after the incident, I believe that his reticence (or blackout) might be a result of experimental drugs or other methods known to have been used by military Intelligence in the post World War II years to confuse the mind or to program it to forget. KA does admit, backed by his wife's testimony, that he experiences recurring nightmares recalling phases of the incident and of people involved. CASE A-3: Mail irregularities in my special research have a high incidence rate. Not so with routine UFO matters or the monthly bills. The foregoing case, one of possible great significance if true, is exemplary of mysterious postal handling. Because of the obvious non-delivery of follow-up letters to and from the principal involved, the case remains incomplete. The story begins with a letter that had military masthead and was dated September 16, 1980, from a Sergeant JM, APO San Francisco. The Sergeant's letter, among other letters on the UFO subject, was probably in response to an Armed Forces radio re-broadcast of my interview on UFO crashes with the popular Charlie Tuna Show, KATZ, Los Angeles. The Sergeant's disclosure on official stationery follows: Sergeant JM, September 16, 1980: 'Department of the Air Force ...Security Police Sq. (PACAF) APO San Francisco, California 96239 Reply to: (Name and home address withheld on request) Subject: Response to Request of Information in Relation to UFO contact and other Related Information To: Len Stringfield 1) In January of 1978, I was stationed at McGuire AFB, N. J. One evening, during the time frame of 0300 hrs. and 0500 hrs., there were a number of UFO sightings in the area over the air field and Ft. Dix Army Camp. I am a security policeman and was on routine patrol at the time. N. J. State Police and Ft. Dix MPs were running code in the direction of Brownsville, N. J. A state trooper then entered Gate # 5 at the rear of the base requesting assistance and permission to enter. I was dispatched and the trooper wanted access to the runway area which led to the very back of the air field and connected with a heavily wooded area which is part of the Dix training area. He informed me that a Ft. Dix MP was pursuing a low flying object which then hovered over his car. The N. J. state trooper described aerial object as oval-shaped, with no details, and glowing with a bluish-green color. His radio transmission was cut off. At that time in front of his police car appeared a thing, about 4 feet tall, greyish-brown, fat head, long arms and slender body. The MP panicked and fired five rounds from his .45 cal. into the thing and one round into the object above. The object then fled straight up and joined with eleven others high in the sky. This we all saw, but did not know the details at the time. Anyway, the thing ran into the woods towards our fence line and they wanted to look for it. By this time, several patrols were involved. 2) We found the body of the thing near the runway. It had apparently climbed the fence and died while running. It was all of a sudden hush-hush and no one was allowed near the area. We roped off the area and AFOSI came out and took over. That was the last I saw of it. There was a bad stench coming from it, too. Like ammonia smelling, but was not constant in the air. That day, a team from Wright-Patterson AFB came in a C 141 and went to the area. They crated it in a wooden box, sprayed something over it, and then put it into a bigger metal container. They loaded it in the plane and took off. That was it, nothing more said; no report made and we were all told not to have anything to say about it or we would be court martialled."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 3) I will be getting out of the Air Force in about two months. Do not disclose my name as I could get into trouble. I am interested in pursuing this and other matters if you need help. Forgive me for not signing this, but I can't take any chances. Please reply to the above address and my parents will forward it to me or I will be home already. Don't send it here because they monitor all mail closely and I again don't want to take any chances.' Len Stringfield: Upon receipt of the above letter, I answered on September 27, 1980, with a long letter to his home address with many questions and enclosed a copy of Status Report II. [To be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] I received no reply. On November 18, 1990, I sent a follow-up letter asking about the delivery of my earlier letter and offering to meet him in person. To this I received a reply dated November 27, 1980, in which he said he did not receive my previous letter. Said JM, 'I don't know why. I am now out of the service and am home. I am prepared to answer your questions. ...The desk sergeant that night was Sgt. 'C' (name on file), and he would know much more. ...I would like your next response ASAP and I will try to give you my phone number by then.' I wrote to JM again dated December 4, 1980, and enclosed a xeroxed copy of the first long letter with questions. He did not respond. I sent another letter dated February 16, 1981, expressing my concern and gave assurances of anonymity. He never responded. I tried to make connections via the telephone, but to no avail. He disappeared into thin air and with him a case as sinister as the Lumberton affair cited in Status Report II (See Case B-13), and in the Postscript of this paper. One more follow-up was made by researcher and confidant, Richard Hall of MUFON, who sent a certified letter to JM dated April 10, 1982. Although it was received and signed by JM on April 12, 1982, thee has been no response. CASE A-4: V. A. 'Posty' Postlethwait of Phoenix, Arizona, formerly served as Captain in the 82nd Airborne and was on detached service, G-2 (Intelligence) V-Corps, Pope AFB in the Ft. Bragg complex in North Carolina. Posty was referred to me by Bill Jenkins of KABC Los Angeles radio, April 1980, when I was a guest on his 'Open Mind' show. Reaching Posty I found his credentials good and so was the information he shared concerning a UFO crash at White Sands Proving Grounds in 1948. As a Captain in G-2 Air, he was cleared to see a TOP SECRET message coming in by TWX from the 3rd Army Headquarters, Atlanta, Georgia. Directed to the Commanding General (with copy to G-2), the message described the crash of an alien saucer-shaped craft 100 feet in diameter, 30 feet high, with one portal window blown which caused suffocation to the five occupants. Among other items cited, as Posty recalled, the bodies had turned blue and were about 4 feet tall with oversized heads by human standards and that the metallic skin of the craft was as thin as a newspaper, but too tough to penetrate by conventional tools. He also recalled hearing that private property was purchased to facilitate transporting the craft to the base. Posty said the full story, beyond what he had heard at the base, was published in an article appearing in a 1948 issue of Coronet magazine. When the issue was released, he heard that authorities had confiscated all copies at the Coronet office and most that reached the newsstands. A few survived, a copy of which he had seen years ago. COMMENT: Needed is a copy of Coronet, month unknown, 1948. Significant is Postlethwait granting me permission to use his name in this report. CASE A-5: RT married, was a former Marine, rank PFC, assigned to Canine Corps at Camp Pendleton, San Diego, California, with Alpha Red TS Crypto Clearance. Served 6 years in Vietnam. Resident of Las Vegas, Nevada. In this first person report, RT alleges he was at a UFO retrieval site, 1967. Following RT's disclosures to me in July 1980, supported by data from APRO (Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization) records of his phone calls to that office, is a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"weird unfolding drama of harassment and violence, a strange visit, and the grim consequences which allegedly befell one of its on-the-spot investigators, RC, also of Las Vegas. Through RC, my intermediary - who was formerly a U. S. Narcotics agent - I reached RT by phone. According to RT's testimony, he was given 45 minutes notice before departure by plane from Camp Pendleton to a retrieval site 'somewhere in the desert' on July 3, 1967. As a trainer in the Canine Corps at his base, he and his dogs and other marines as a team were flown in a light cargo transport for 2.5 hours to the site, landing on a makeshift strip carved out by a road grader. The windows of the transport were blacked out, he said. At the site, among the cactus and tumbleweed, were tents, a small quonset hut and what appeared to be a small pre-fab hangar. Busy were men in military fatigues without insignia. Told nothing about the status of the operation, he was assigned to a post for guard duty, given orders, and told to use only one designated path to the mess tent and latrine. Curious, said RT, he decided on his fourth day to see what was so hush-hush and took a different route to the mess tent near the hangar. When the guard had his back turned, he peeked inside the hangar and to his shock, he saw a metallic disc, or saucer, about 30 feet in diameter. On top was a dome. There were no windows. Around the craft were men at work and tables on which were technical instruments. He also saw a large walk-in refrigerator unit on skids and several empty body bags. 'If there were bodies,' he said, 'they had already been shipped out or maybe they were in the freezer.' RT's one good glimpse into the hangar was also his undoing. The guard nearby nabbed him and he was escorted to the headquarter's tent where he faced the officer in command, Colonel 'P' (name on file), U.S.A.F. Medical Corps. Reminded of his Security Oath, he was confined to quarters and sent back to Pendleton for punishment. Thirteen years later, RT decided to tell his story. He admitted to seeing the movie, 'Hangar 18,' knew it was fiction but said its emotional impact on him conjured up in his mind the hangar in the desert which he knew was not fiction. He first told his story to Wendelle Stevens and RC in Las Vegas and called APRO. Then, like the day he went down the wrong path at the retrieval site, he got into a new hornet's nest of trouble. According to APRO records, RT called in to their office to report each incident of harassment staring July 14, 1980. On July 14, RT claimed he was visited by an Intelligence agent who reminded him of his Security Oath. On July 21, 1980, RT claimed that his apartment was pillaged, maps and all UFO memorabilia taken. Called police. On July 22, 1980, visitor came to apartment with threats. RT excused himself to bedroom, got a 45 cal. gun, forced the intruder to show ID at gun point, and performed a 'citizen's arrest.' He called police, the intruder was 'booked.' Also, there was a man waiting in the limousine outside. the police checked the intruders' credentials and released them. On July 28, 1980, RT called to relate that he was visited by a person dressed in black who offered to exchange UFO information. This was the last call made by RT to APRO, according to available records. During the period of RT's contact with APRO, I was receiving similar information by phone from my intermediary, RC. Needless to say, I had difficulty in digesting the adventures of his source. Then , on August 11, 1980, it was arranged for me to reach RT to discuss firsthand the events of the past month. Hearing it from RT, the story seemed less fanciful or less contrived. When I asked about the intruders' ID, he said, 'C. I. A.' The story told by RT about his visitor, a man dressed in black, might have been penned by Poe. During the stranger's 45 minute unannounced visit, RT's dog, a shepherd, behaved uneasily. Once, said RT, he asked for a glass of water, but when he was approached, he uttered, 'Don't touch me.' RT also noted that during their conversations about UFOs, the visitor always spoke in the third person, using 'we' or 'they.' According to RT, the visitor - while describing a UFO incident - suddenly produced from his briefcase a half dozen color photographs. 'Each showed a small cadaver or parts, not human, in what appeared to be a hospital operating room,' he said. 'I would judge they were just about four feet tall if scaled with the tables they were on.' "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"One photo, said RT, was a close-up of a hand with four fingers, long and slim, with no opposable thumb. 'Another,' he said, 'showed the top of a humanoid head, the flesh cut open and drilled into.' Still another showed the upper torso of chalky complexion with an incision into its chest, he said. And another showed a body burned in its suit. 'But there was one photo that really convinced me,' said RT with emphasis. 'It showed three doctors in the process of dissecting a body on top of a slab with a gutter around the edge. 'See any blood?' I asked. 'If their blood is red, there wasn't any,' he replied, or words to that effect. 'The photos looked real to me,' he said, when I asked for his opinion of them. I called RT the following day, August 12, 1980, on a tip from RC who learned that RT and his wife might move from their apartment in the next day or two. He seemed restrained, his words hesitant, but he tried to be courteous. 'Maybe I should not be talking on this subject anymore,' he said. He then went on to explain that he was having a 'social security number problem' and that it was causing a delay in money to pay the rent. That was the last word from RT, although he promised to send me his new address. I have since heard from Wendelle Stevens who heard that RT was working for the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), had all of his debts paid, and was not talking to anybody about UFOs anymore. But this anecdote does not end with RT. Events just as strange allegedly happened to RC, my intermediary who seemed ready and willing and unafraid to move mountains in his probes to get facts for me. \" Continued in Part 4 - Shocking news from RC and more crash/retrieval cases.
