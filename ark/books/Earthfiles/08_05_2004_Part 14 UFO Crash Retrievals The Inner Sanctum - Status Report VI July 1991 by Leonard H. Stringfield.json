THE KECKSBURG CRASH Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, is about 35 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Witnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped object with strange markings in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania woods on December 9, 1965. Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions. Len Stringfield: \" ANOTHER 'ACORN': ITS CRASH/RETRIEVAL NEAR EDWARDS AFB, 1971 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Earlier I made reference to a case of a UFO landing at Edwards AFB which was recorded on movie film by an Air Force officer (and his crew), who later became an astronaut. Without knowing that UFO's fate, or perhaps of others we never heard about at the base, we now have a report that 'something' landed, or crash-landed, in 1971 just 15 miles outside of its vast property near the small town of California City, California. This incident surfaced from a firsthand witness, Debbie Clayton, who felt obliged to report her experience after watching the rerun of the Kecksburg UFO crash on Unsolved Mysteries. When I talked with Debby by phone after getting her name from Stan Gordon, she said she thought the craft depicted on the show, described as an acorn shape, looked similar to the object she had seen - except that hers was like a mushroom at the top. Her letter recounting her experience follows: Debby Clayton: 'Since last talking with you, I gathered more information. I called my old girlfriend's ex and he said that she remembered the incident occurring in the summer of 1971 because they hadn't moved to our area until winter of 1970. So, I was incorrect about the date. It was late afternoon, but it was st ill daylight when we (my girlfriend's family and I) heard a loud, roaring noise s imilar to the roaring of a plane warming up. Then we heard the crashing sound and went outside to see what happened. We found a cloud of dust three blocks in front of us. Since there were only six homes in our neighborhood, it was easy to spot. My friend's older brother grabbed his father's camera and we walked to the crash-site. An elementary school's mobile classrooms are now where the craft was, but at the time I believe there was a small baseball field near it. A few other neighbors had arrived and we were all speculating on it being an Air Force 'toy' that had gotten out of control. An Air Force car and one truck arrived within 15 minutes. The truck had about five men in it with rifles. An officer got out of the car and told his men to move us back away from the craft. He saw that Dalton, my friend's brother, was taking pictures and grabbed the camera, threw it to the ground and broke it. (He never tried to remove the film.) Dalton yelled and argued with the officer, but we were told to leave, ignoring Dalton and his threats. About that time, other trucks arrived - one with men aboard; another with a trailer on the back and a third one with a small crane. The officer told us that we had to leave or be arrested. But we moved only across the street at first. We watched while the men attached a large canvas to the craft and lifted it by attaching cables to metal hooks that were on the canvas. After the craft was loaded, they all left. There was no mention of the incident in the newspapers. As for the craft itself, we searched for markings but found only some old scratches that we could not read. Because it was upright, we couldn't see the bottom. There were no windows or seams, appearing to be made from a one-piece mold. If I remember correctly, it was a dark grayish color with greenish highlights - no a color one normally sees. The texture was quite smooth. There was a mild heat coming from the craft somewhat like a car engine after traveling for an hour. One more thing I thought was strange: there was no dust that clung to the shell. Here in the desert, dust is everywhere and clings to everything. Because we were only 15 miles from Edward's AFB and the speed in which the first car and truck arrived, I believe the craft was being tracked and they knew exactly where to find it. Also, I believe that when the officer broke Dalton's camera, it was to draw attention to himself instead of the craft. Otherwise, he could have taken the camera ... The size of the craft ... 5 feet high and 10 feet wide -- are estimates from a fourteen year old's memories, but I think they are pretty close.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" My follow up phone call to Debby revealed a few more details. She recalled that the object appeared to fall straight down from the sky and that it was not a speedy descent and that it landed (or crashed) in a perfect upright position - no tilt. She also recalled that the tumbleweeds surrounding the object appeared to be darkened as if burnt or singed, but she saw no fire. And she clearly recalls the soldiers busily shoveling soil at the site, and the next day there was no trace of a depression caused by the craft. I asked bout physical effects. Only Dalton complained, she said, and described the terrible pain he endured later that night in his arm from wrist to elbow. My guess here is that the culprit was the officer who got carried away in grabbing the camera. No wonder Dalton 'yelled and argued' as Debby explained in her letter. But, the real mystery is the object's identity. A U. S. secret 'toy,' as Debby speculated, or another errant craft similar to the one that descended into Kecksburg in 1965? There are parallels; except in the Edwards' incident, there were no signs of radiation and no protective clothing observed to be worn by the retrievers. Also, there was no ambulance on the scene in event of casualties or ejected occupants - unless the retrievers knew that they were safely at rest in suspended animation. MORE NEWS AND VIEWS: UFO CRASHES, MJ-12 AND THE ROLE OF DR. ERIC WALKER I am pleased to have a personalized statement by T. Scott Crain of Port Matilda, Pennsylvania, who - with co-author Grant Cameron of Winnipeg, Canada - released their book, UFOs, MU-12 and the Government, published by MUFON in May 1991. Knowing them mainly by correspondence and by phone, they have responsibly tracked down early year UFO crashes and specifically, a scientific source, Dr. Eric Walker, who they had reasons to believe had MJ-12 connections and was involved in crash/retrieval operations. His letter dated May 14, 1991, follows: Grant Cameron: 'Shortly after the release of the Operation Majestic 12 Briefing Document at the 1987 Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) symposium held in Washington, D. C., Manitoba, Canada UFO investigator, Grant Cameron, and Pennsylvania State Section Director for MUFON, T. Scott Crain, Jr., joined forces to search for government personnel who had knowledge about the government's handling of alleged UFO crashes. If Majestic-Twelve represented a real group of 12 scientists, military and intelligence officials to oversee the U. S. Government's program to recover crashed UFOs, we reasoned that there should be former government officials who are cognizant of the committee's existence. According to the Briefing Document, it was prepared for President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower in November 1952. MJ-12 was allegedly established in September 1947, as a Research and Development (R&D) inte lligence operation responsible directly to the President. Since the team was allegedly established in 1947 and was still active in 1952, we began searching for former members of the R&D board, active during that time-frame, who might know something about the MJ-12 co mmittee. We were already aware of one former R&D board member who acknowledged the government was actively participating in UFO recoveries. Dr. Robert Sarbacher, who was on the Missile Committee in the 1950s, said he was invited to attend discussions about the recoveries at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. He wasn't able to attend, but he states in a 1983 letter to California UFO researcher William Steinman, that the material in the flying saucer crashes was very light and tough and the 'aliens' recovered looked like certain insects observed on Earth. (Ants? Praying Mantis? Other?) Sarbacher was instrumental in leading UFO researchers like nuclear physicist, Stanton Friedman, and William Steinman to another R&D board member, who"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"he claimed attended all the discussions at Wright-Patterson AFB. His name was Dr. Eric A. Walker. Walker was Executive Secretary of the U. S. government's R&D board in the early 1950s, and later he became President of the Pennsylvania State University. Dr. Walker was one of six individuals named by Fred Darwin, former head of the Missile Committee of the R&D board, who he believed would be involved in a UFO recovery operation, 'if there ever was such a happening.' Steinman claims he called Walker on August 30, 1987. During the conversation, Walker allegedly admitted attending those UFO recovery meetings, new of MJ-12 since its inception in 1947, and had in his possession notes of those meetings he attended in his files. According to Steinman, Walker discouraged him from pursuing this matter because he was '...delving into an area that you can do absolutely nothing about.' Subsequent conversations between Walker and a number of other UFO researchers looking for more information, has yielded mixed results. The most interesting data was obtained by Armenian physicist, Dr. Henry Azadehdel, who phoned Walker several times from England. During a conversation on March 8, 1990, Azadehdel claims Walker described the MJ-12 committee as a 'handful of elite' and that he was sent a c opy of the Briefing Document in 1987 by Steinman. When asked by Azadehdel if he thought it was authentic, Walker allegedly said, 'I don't think so.' According to Azadehdel, when he asked Walker if he was ever a member of MJ-12, Walker answered, 'I cannot answer that.' Walker would not say whether or not the MJ-12 group was st ill active, Azadehdel said, and Walker reportedly indicated it has been some time since he had anything to do with them. To our knowledge, this is the first time a scientist with impeccable credentials has admitted that Majestic-Twelve is real. If the telephone notes we have collected from researchers who have interviewed Walker are correct, then the U. S. government has done a splendid job of keeping this co mmittee a secret. Cameron and Crain researched the Walker connection from 1987 to 1990, and have put the results of our investigation into the book, UFOs, MJ-12 and the Government , published in May 1991 by the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON).' THE 'HENRY' AND ERIC DIALOGUE, SUBJECT: KECKSBURG On June 2, 1991, I got a phone call from Armen Victorian (formerly known as Henry Azadehdel) who said he had important news about Walker's link to the Kecksburg incident during an interview with him on May 30, 1991. On June 3, I received a fax copy of the interview as follows: 'AV: Doctor, I want to ask you about something that might not have anything to do with the UFOs. Would you mind me asking you? EW: What is that? AV : Doctor, it is about an incident which happened in the mid-1960s. To be precise, on December 9, 1965, in Kecksburg, Pennsylvania. It was - one could say - almost in your back garden. Could you tell me something about it? EW: What about it? AV : Well, what did you find out about it? EW: You still have not given up? "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"AV : Doctor, you would say I am like a turtle - you turn me over to get rid of me, and I struggle for awhile in my shell and eventually get back on my legs. EW: Well, we went there. AV : With the military? EW: You see, two were from the military, but not on duty. AV : How about the others? EW: He was a fellow colleague of mine. (Len's note: Who was the second military person?) AV : What did you find? Was it a - I know you are not going to like the word, but - was it a UFO? EW: I cannot comment on that. I cannot tell you. AV : Were you there for long? EW: Why? AV : Well, curiosity. I thought maybe there was a purpose in the sense of - maybe preparing a report or taking some notes. EW: We did not prepare any reports. AV : Well, doctor, apart from everything, how are you nowadays? EW: I am fine.' Comments by Henry Azadehdel, also known as Armen Victorian : 'Based upon my previous conversations with him (Eric Walker), I would say he has not changed at all. He did not give any solid piece of information to confirm the fact that a UFO did come down in Kecksburg. ...I could say that it was his way of telling me, without putting himself into any jeopardy. I believe that Walker was at the Kecksburg site as admitted which further suggests that the incident was important enough to require his presence. I also believe that his visit was not during the retrieval operation when a large contingent of military pers onnel were present. Probably, his 'inspection' with two military colleagues came later.' KECKSBURG UPDATE: STAN GORDON Following is a statement by Stan Gordon which I received in April 1991, updating the Kecksburg Affair. Stan Gordon: 'What was the object that slowly dropped from the sky into a wooded area near the village of Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, late on the afternoon of December 9, 1965, that apparently caused military units to quickly respond to that site? This is only one question among many others that have surfaced since the 25-year-old mystery occurred. While some wish to deny that anything happened that day, many dozens of people have surfaced over the years who had some part to play in the Kecksburg UFO incident. A number of these people have now gone on public record, but as in so many similar incidents, quite a lot of those involved wish to remain anonymous."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" At this time, many leads are being pursued, and other new sources of information on the case are being interviewed. A detailed study is being conducted into technical and scientific data associated with space probe experimentation during the 1960s, conducted by the United States and other foreign countries. Before we can claim the Kecksburg object was something extraterrestrial, we must first rule out any man-made devices. Several witnesses who saw the object making a slow descent towards the Kecksburg area independently described the object hovering for a period of time before slowly descending towards the wooded area. These reports seem to indicate that the object, whatever it was, had some control and did not crash as the term might indicate. There apparently was little structural damage to the object and no fire or major damage at the site. Even though some area residents heard a loud explosive sound about the time of the occurrence,m a number of people who actually saw the object fall into the woods followed by blue smoke rising and quickly dissipating, said that there was no sound at the moment of impact. As investigation has progressed on the case over the years, rumors going back to 1965 that the government tried to cover up the events concerning the Kecksburg incident have surfaced. Recent information now seems to support those claims Some new information on the event includes the following: A week after the Kecksburg UFO incident, now deceased News Director of WHJB Radio in Greensburg, John Murphy, along with other staff members, prepared a documentary on the event called Object in the Woods. At the beginning of the broadcast, it was noted that some witnesses, who had been previously taped and interviewed for this special, had notified the station that they wished their voices not to be aired due to fear of getting in trouble with the U. S. Army or the State Police. Sections of the radio special had to be 'censored' to comply with the witnesses' requests. One staff member who worked at the station at the time has given us a notarized statement that she recalls 'the government confiscating news tapes of eyewitness accounts and not being allowed to broadcast said tapes.' A medical doctor has given us a written statement that after the Kecksburg incident occurred, a close associate of his who was an ophthalmologist, told him in the strictest confidence that several Air Force officers had brought a young man to be examined at a Pittsburgh area clinic. 'Dr. --- said the young man had observed a flaming object near Kecksburg.' The heat from the object had turned the patient's corneas totally white and opaque from the normal window glass clear state. The doctor closed his statement with the following comment, 'I am sorry that I do not have more information, but I am certain this was a military investigation of a highly classified nature associated with the Kecksburg sightings.' Many more important details have come to our attention. As more information is gathered and time permits, update reports on our findings will be released. It is our hope that some day a governmental inquiry w ill be held on the Kecksburg incident. This would likely have to be a closed door session, so that civilian observers who wish no publicity can talk freely, and military personnel who might have taken a security oath w ill be able to discuss their knowledge of the events without possible repercussions.' Len Stringfield: Stan Gordon and I met privately at the MUFON Symposium in Chicago on July 6, 1991. We discussed several sensitive 'backup' events concerning the case which we agreed should remain confidential at this phase of investigation.\" "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 15 - More Crash Retrievals of Unidentified Craft Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
