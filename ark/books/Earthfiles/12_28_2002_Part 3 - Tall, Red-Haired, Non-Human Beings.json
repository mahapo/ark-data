Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe An American male abductee encountered this tall, red-haired, non-human being in the early 1990s near Memphis, Tennessee. Other abductees in Nevada and southern California have also described tall, red-haired, non-human beings. Drawing by Lisa Dusenberry, from Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe. December 28, 2002 Jamison, Pennsylvania - When I was in Peru in June 1987, I heard about tall beings with copper red hair, crystal blue eyes, and very white skin that were seven to eight feet tall, or taller. The man who told me about them was an archaeology student whose father worked as a traveling nurse in the rural areas of Peru. Edwin Flores told me that his father had traveled in 1981 to a remote village called Pillpinto, six hours by car from Cuzco. When he returned, he asked his son why \"very tall Irish people\" were living in the rugged mountains. His father explained that he had seen them at the outskirts of the village. Flores said his father had not been back since 1981 and he didn't know if the \"tall Irish\" were still there. I proposed that we go to Pillpinto and find out. It was a difficult road, climbing most of the time, with hairpin turns. We were stopped twice by security police. I didn't learn until later that we were driving right toward one of the hide-outs of the Communist-inspired rebels known as the \"Shining Path\" who had been blowing up trains and buildings in Peru. Flores "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"explained to the police that I was an American documentary filmmaker and writer investigating information about extraterrestrial phenomena and that we were looking for \"tall Irish\" living near Pillpinto. We were surprised when the police said. \"Si!\" They knew about the red-haired people. At the outpost closest to Pillpinto, two policemen pointed up into the sky and told about a large, round, bright object that had landed on t op of one of the mountains. The police said they had climbed up there and if we did, too, we could still see the \"burned oval\" where the light landed. The police estimated it would take a day to reach the site. I was tempted, but time was limite d, and I wanted to at least see if the tall Irish people were still living in Pillpinto. So, we continued on to the village. When we stopped, our car was surrounded by dozens of children. When Flores explained why I was there, the children began pointing toward houses. He said the children knew about the tall, red-haired people and would take us to a man who knew about them. My heart began to beat faster as we walked toward the door of a small, adobe home, preceded by the laughter and chatter of the children who surr ounded us. The sun was setting and in the twilight shadows, I asked myself what I was going to do if I actually found myself in front of an eight foot, red-haired being from another world. Flores knocked and the door opened. In front of us stood a man about five-foot-four with clear blue eyes, like \"clear water,\" as Felipe Branco described the clear green eyes of the tall, red-haired beings he has encountered in Brazil. There were copper-red patches in his dark, brown hair. I asked Flores if he could find out where the man's parents were. After a long answer in Spanish, Flores said, \"His parents live in that house over there. Nothing unusual. But he knows about the 'tall Irish.' He says they used to live outside the village and have moved on. He said there is another man here who knew them.\" We walked further surrounded by the children. Flores knocked on the second door. Another man answered and his eyes were clear blue, too. He also had copper patches in his dark hair. He knew about the red-haired people, but said they didn't live there anymore. He did not know where they had come from, either, or where they had gone. In 1993, Missouri artist Lisa Dusenberry sent me a photograph of a humanoid she had drawn (top of this report) based on the testimony of a man from southwestern Tennessee who encountered an unusual humanoid during an abduction experience that was similar to the Peruvian description. He said, \"She was eight feet tall, wore a full-length purple, hooded robe, and had long, red hair.\" He felt she was kind and loving and he was comfortable with her. Another woman in southern California saw a copy of Lisa Dusenberry's drawing of the red-haired and said the female was the same being she had seen during her abduction. A woman and her teenage daughter who were abducted from a rural Nevada town also described red-haired humanoids. Peru and Tall, Red-Haired Beings Very tall, copper-haired, blue-eyed beings were involved in the abduction of Brian Scott in southern California in the mid-1970s. Brian Scott felt compelled"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"by his red-haired abductors to travel to Peru to the Gate of the Sun at Lake Titicaca, a location associated with tall, red-haired peoples dating back to at least the 1500s and before.

When Spaniard Pedro Pizarro began his land expedition into the western coast of South America in 1531, he was surprised to find tall, red-haired, white- skinned people mixed among the larger population of short, black-haired, brown-skinned people. Pizarro, with his white skin and light hair and beard, was welcomed by the Incas as the return of their god, Viracocha - an unfortunate assumption that lead to the Incas' destruction. Pizarro was also surprised to learn that Viracocha was described as being tall with reddish-brown hair and a beard. \"In (Peru), on the Pacific coast and the desert sand of Paracas, there are large burial caves in which numerous mummies have been perfectly preserved. Some of the mummies were found to have ... red, often chestnut- colored hair, silky and wavy, as found amongst Europeans, they have long skulls and remarkably tall bodies. Hair experts have shown by microscopic analysis that the red hair has all the characteristics that ordinarily distinguish a Nordic hair type from that of Mongols or American Indians.\" - From Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island © 1988 by Thor Heyerdahl A red-haired mummy dated to circa 1400 A.D. and recovered from Nevado Ampato, Peru, in the mountains near the famous Machu Picchu mountaintop \"city\" or \"fortress\" built for unknown purpose.
