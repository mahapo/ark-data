Here begins Part 8 of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: CASE B-4: 1962, Crashed Disk In Northern New Mexico [ Editor's Note: Carswell AFB was one of the first Strategic Air Command bases, originally created on July 18, 1916.] Researcher Tommy Blann met Lt. Colonel X through a friend of another military officer stationed at Carswell AFB. 'There were many exchanges of communications between myself, my friend and the other officer before the Colonel decided to meet me in person,' commented Blann in his personal summary of the discussion, recorded March 14, 1975, which Tommy obliged to send me in November 1981. Although sensitive portions of Blann's notes have been omitted here on his request, in deference to his informant, an excerpt that is pertinent to crash landed UFOs follows: March 14, 1975, Letter from UFO Researcher Tommy Blann: 'The Colonel stated that underground installations, as well as isolated areas of military reservations, have squadrons of unmarked helicopters which have sophisticated instrumentation on board. Squadrons are dispatched to areas of UFO activity to monitor the craft or airlift them out of the area if one has malfunctioned. When I asked him about the crashed discs and humanoid bodies being taken to Wright-Patterson, he told me that 'in the earlier years, they had taken some bodies to that base, but later it depended on where the bodies were found. They had a hell of a time setting up procedures for this operation, as well as getting the craft out of the area without it being observed. Usually this was done at nighttime.' He feels the bodies are now being flown outside the U. S. to a secret naval installation on an island in the Pacific Ocean. I then asked him had he ever observed a crashed craft and any humanoid bodies? He hesitated and said that he witnessed one crashed craft in Northern New Mexico in the summer of 1962. It was dull aluminum-looking disc like two saucers inverted end-on-end, with a dark section running around the center of the craft. It appeared to be 30 feet in diameter and about 12 feet high. There was no noticeable landing gear and the craft had skidded, digging up a small trench. There was a team of eight men wearing jump suits and gas masks. Each man had a specific job to do. The main testing is not done in the field. Only the preliminary data are recovered. He said if you hear of a case where there are a large number of men crawling all over the craft without proper attire and doing all types of testing, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"you can bet it did not happen. There were two bodies recovered from the craft and they were put in a large unmarked silver van and whisked off. I did not get a good look at the bodies. However, they looked small and were dressed in silver, skin-tight flight suits. They were taken to Holloman AFB as well as the craft and then sections of the craft were sent to various research labs, including Los Alamos Laboratories. I believe the bodies were also taken to Los Alamos and samples sent to other locations. They were not taken to Wright-Patterson. He would not give me any further details and stated he had said enough. I don't know if he is telling me the complete truth, but I do know that some things he said coincided with what I already knew from other sources.' Leonard Stringfield Comment: Above all else, the Colonel's alleged presence at a crash site in New Mexico in 1962, ties in with the report described by researcher Robert Barry involving his C.I.A. source in same place, same year. See Case A-6 in Status Report II (reprinted in future Earthfiles). Also of note in both reports was the recovery of two small occupants wearing tight-fitting suits. Unfortunately, there is one glaring discrepancy. Each report describes the size of the craft differently. In the case of Colonel X, it was 30 feet in diameter and 12 feet high. The C.I.A. investigator's was 68 feet in diameter and 13 feet high. Both heights were close enough, but the diameters are off by 38 feet. Is one report, or both, miscalculations? Did two crashes occur, accounting for the diameter differences? Is one or both reports fake? Also of note is the variance in size of the craft seen in a hangar at Wright-Patterson, 1962, perhaps 'freshly' retrieved, cited in Case A-6 in this paper. Significant is the Colonel's remark that retrieved craft and occupants have not all been sent to Wright-Patterson. Much ado has been made by some researchers unwilling to believe that during the 1950s most captured craft - because of size - could have been shipped by rail or over inadequate highways from far away places to Wright-Patterson AFB. Agreed, reported craft sizes over 30 feet in diameter would have been a monumental task to transport from great distances. However, I have not claimed that all craft have been shipped to that base. I suppose if human purpose or the priority were strong enough, anything can be done. Notably, experts are still baffled by the feat of the ancient Egyptians who transported more than 2 million stone blocks, some weighting 15 tons, to build the great pyramids almost 5000 years ago. It seems they had a purpose. Maybe the U. S. Air Force had a purpose and the priority. CASE B-5: 1953, UFO Crash At White Sands Proving Ground In this case, Lt. Colonel RAB becomes a first person witness for Richard Hall, who is a veteran researcher and Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal. It begins with a letter addressed to NICAP on April 8, 1964, from HC, a student at the Bob Jones University, Greenville, S. C., a copy of which was sent to me by Hall and is quoted in part as follows: HC Letter Addressed to NICAP, April 8, 1964: 'Here at school there is an instructor was an adjutant to an Army Air Corps General at one of our New Mexico proving grounds during the Korean conflict. I got the following story from him. In 1953, a flying saucer crash-landed near the White Sands Proving Grounds. Air Force personnel immediately rushed to the area and found the saucer, unharmed and unoccupied, with doors open. Upon searching the surrounding area, they came upon the bodies of the saucer's four occupants, all dead. Shortly after this, certain top level personnel were given the true saucer story by Air Force officials. In his capacity, my source was included in this. They were shown the bodies of the four occupants of the ship, which he described as from three to four feet tall, hairless and otherwise quite human in appearance. An autopsy had been performed on one of them to determine the cause of death. He described them as ovoid, with a length of twenty-five feet, and a width of thirteen feet. They were shown the interior as well and there were no visible means of control, no visible means of propulsion. He told me that since that time, the Air Force has been working intensely, although unsuccessfully, at trying to discover the means of propulsion. I can vouch for the validity of this information as well as the reliability of the person I got it from. This you can state as positive fact. Due to the fact that he is still affiliated with the armed forces, he prefers that his identity remain hidden. He also told me that this is top secret information which is highly guarded to prevent leaks. (Then why is he telling college students about it?' - Richard Hall)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" In 1977, as a result of HC's lead, Hall arranged to meet Lt. Colonel RAB during a radio interview in Washington, D. C., which he explains in his memo to me on June 24, 1980. RAB was a Lt. Colonel in Army Reserves, former helicopter pilot in Vietnam or Korea or both. As a former aide to an Air Force General, he saw firsthand four alien bodies at Langley AFB recovered from a crash in 1953 near White Sands, New Mexico. The four bodies, RAB said, were found outside the saucer which was intact, with doors open. RAB is very religious. He was in Washington as a representative at a religious conference. I have sent him Status Report II with a note suggesting that after he has a chance to appraise your discreet handling of sensitive information, he might be willing to talk to you. As I recall, he is not convinced the information should be made public. Leonard Stringfield Comment: 'In follow-up, I wrote to RAB (xerox copy to Hall), but never received a reply. According to RAB, four bodies were found outside of the crashed craft in New Mexico in 1953. Significantly, his testimony parallels that of KA in Case A-2 in this paper who photographed, from a helicopter, four bodies outside the craft in New Mexico in 1954. The difference of one year! KA stands firmly on the time of his incident and unfortunately, RAB cannot be reached to verify his memory of the date. CASE B-6: 1948, UFO Crash in New Mexico The following notarized statement, signed by veteran researchers, John Meloney and Lorraine Duchesne, bear witness to the testimony of the informant, WW. The notarized statement is a positive step in procedure to obtain credence for intermediary information. In recent years, John Meloney of MUFON and formerly of NICAP, and I have exchanged UFO information by phone and letter. Once we had occasion to meet personally on a UFO case. Report by John Meloney and Lorraine Duchesne On February 9, 1980: \"On February 9, 1980, Lorraine Duchesne and I called on WW at his home in New Hampshire. In 1978, he had told Lorraine that he had been at the site of a crashed saucer in Mexico many years ago when in the OSS (WWII's Office of Strategic Services). After talking with him awhile and explaining that I had considerable knowledge about UFOs and alien beings, and that I was formerly in the U. S. Intelligence Service, he gave us some guarded information. But I had the impression that he knew a lot more. I said I wondered if he could verify that he was at the saucer crash of 1952. He said it was earlier than that. Eventually he admitted it was in 1948 in New Mexico. He said he remembered the location so well he could take me to the exact spot right now, but he would not say where it was. (I had used the 1952 date as a test.) He said he saw the corpse of an alien lying on an examination table covered with a sheet. He was reluctant to describe it, so I showed him the picture of the drawing of a hand in Leonard Stringfield's report, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome - Status Report II , October 29, 1979. He said it was just like that, but had only three fingers. Then he admitted the small finger might have been tucked underneath the hand. He said the hand was white, except for webbing between the fingers, which was brown. Only the hand was protruding from the sheet. He said a sheet covered most of the body, but the forehead was also showed above the sheet and that, too was white. The face was wide and wrinkles in the sheet showed the outline of the head to be triangular with a point at the chin where it should be. There was no bump in the sheet where the nose should have been. He said he thought it was some kind of 'throwback' in human evolution. It was not until he read a report about it (which he was not authorized to read) in the company of a friend named \"L,\" that he realized he had been looking at an alien body. Both men were in the OSS at the time and were even part of a recovery team. He said they were all told not to discuss what they had seen and that the body was taken to the U. S. He said there were a lot of Mexican civilians around and they were not told to keep it secret. The implication was that there might still be witnesses in the area who would remember the incident. The rest of our discussion pertained to technical aspects of UFO propulsion and adaptations of alien technology that have been developed on Earth. His remarks in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"this area were not relevant to this particular incident though he showed a great understanding of physics. He indicated a willingness to pursue technical matters further if I could put him in touch with a scientist with certain qualifications which he outlined. I am sure that if I had not been introduced by Lorraine Duchesne and had not first convinced him that I already knew about saucer crashes, that he would not have discussed the matter at all.' Following the conclusion of the statement were the signatures of four people: John Meloney, Lorraine Duchesne, a Notary Public and witness of WW, with the statement: 'I swear that the above is a true and accurate report of the gist of our discussion.' CASE B-7: 1980 Story About 1962 or 1963 Craft and Alien Body Recovery, Location Unknown. On a tip from Bill Hamilton of Phoenix, Arizona, at the MUFON Symposium in Houston, Texas in June 1980, I was soon in communication with Ms. CM of Los Angeles, a successful freelance writer who knew about a secret movie allegedly showing a freshly recovered alien craft with occupants, filmed inside an Air Force hangar. The movie, in color with sound, and of 17 minutes duration, said CM, was in the possession of a person formerly in the government service whom she did not identify. According to CM, the film showed various aspects of high ranking personnel around the craft inside the hangar. One phase, or scene, showed the removal of five alien dead bodies. 'It would be the proof,' emphasized CM, who claimed to be in a pivotal bargaining position to discuss the matters with me. Knowing of my UFO work and my public relations experience, she asked for my recommendations for a plan to release the film to the media. We agreed there was a need for scientific back-up to prove that the film was authentic. CM said, 'A special screening has been arranged for me to see it next week. So far, only three people know about it.' The date of the retrieval was not clear. CM thought it was 1962 or 1963. 'You will get all the facts soon,' she said. She added, 'You will probably be called here to see it yourself. In the meantime, it's in a bank vault.' When I called a week later, the mood had changed. CM said, 'The time is not right. He's scared and needs time to think. I'll call you when he's ready.' Weeks went by. Nothing. When I called again, I was told only that her source was frightened and in hiding. The last word I had from CM was a message in a Christmas Card dated December 22, 1980, which read in part, '...I have no news on the important matter we discussed.' In 1981, I heard from another person who knew about the film. 'They moved in on him,' he said ominously. He did not identify the 'they.'\" Continued in Part 9 - Post Mortem of Two Alien Cadavers in U. S. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
