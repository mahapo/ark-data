It's about ten miles west of Knobel, Arkansas, where the first American fractal formation was discovered in wheat on June 7, 2003. See More Information below. June 2, 2004 Peach Orchard, Arkansas - On the weekend of May 22-23, 2004, a crop duster pilot flew over a wheat field owned by Rodney Schimmings in Peach Orchard, Arkansas, and reported seeing a seven-spoked \"wagon wheel\" crop formation. Unlike England, there are no tractor tramlines in the wheat. The farm owner told me he looked for signs of entry, but could not find any. Reporter Fred Martin at the Clay County Courier newspaper in Corning heard the news and arranged with Mr. Schimmings to take photographs.

Mr. Schimmings allowed Nancy Talbott's BLT Research, Inc. http://www.bltresearch.com to collect soil and plant samples and now he plans to harvest the field tomorrow, June 3. Mr. Schimmings told me by phone that the plants looked like they had been laid down in a fluid, watery way. But he also found many plants that were broken over and some investigators such as Jeffrey Wilson and Ted Robertson http://www.cropcirclenews.com wonder if this formation was created with mechanical devices by people. Mr. Schimmings is upset that this crop formation occurred - the first on his property. \"I just don't want a lot of publicity or people trying to get on my property. It's (farming) the way I make my living. If something has caused this, I would like to know why or what. I'm going to lose money over what has been done. My crop is laying flat to the ground.\" He was surprised when I told him that many crop formations occur every year in European countries where the plants continue to grow and the farmers harvest the plants right along with the rest of the field. He said, \"I don't think that's the case here in my Arkansas field. But I planned to harvest now anyway.\" Other \"Spoke\" or \"Fan\" Patterns Watership Down, near Kingsclere, Newbury, Hampshire, England Reported July 6, 1995"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Five whirling \"spokes\" inside circle at Watership Down, near Kingsclere, Newbury, Hampshire, England, reported on July 6, 1995.

There was one large central ring of standing wheat surrounded by five whirling \"spokes\" in a fan design.

Estimated diameter was 180 feet. Aerial photograph © 1997 by Lucy Pringle. About this six-spoke \"fan\" in a ring below the intricate grid in a circle, researcher and author, Andy Thomas, wrote in his book Vital Signs, A Complete Guide to the Crop Circle Mystery and why it is NOT a Hoax (Pages 67-68 in 2002 reprint): \"...the very unusual circle containing a standing rectangle divided into 780 small square boxes, twenty-six along one side and thirty along the other. \"Researcher Michael Glickman immediately christened (the rectangle) the \"Calendar Grid' ... he surmised that if one took the side of twenty-six boxes as meaning twenty-six weeks, that would give six months - roughly the time period crop circles usually appeared every season. Calculating twenty-six times thirty would then give fifteen years. Fifteen years from 1997 would take us to 2012 - the date the ancient Mayan calendar comes to an end and a time when many expect tumultuous planetary events to occur... \"Geoff Stray, 2012 expert, deepened the slightly disturbing connection further when he later realized that the Etchilhampton grid is divisible by exactly three \"Tzolkins\" - grids of thirteen by twenty squares that form the Mayan sacred calendar. In his influential booklet, Beyond 2012 , Geoff also points out that when the containing square is included to make 781 units, yet another meaning emerges: '781 is the number of 'bits' in Maurice Cotterell's 187-year sunspot cycle, which Cotterell has related to the Mayan great cycle, ending in 2012. The accompanying six-pointed whirling star would then represent the six rotating magnetic fields of the sun (two polar and four equatorial) that cause the sunspot cycle.'\" More Information: June 7, 2003 Fractal Formation in Knobel, Arkansas Also see 07-13-03 Earthfiles in Archive."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ten-circle crop formation discovered in wheat on June 7, 2003, Knobel, Arkansas. The line meandering across the field is a pipe. Aerial photograph on June 8 © 2003 by Caleigh Catt. Long shadows were pointing across crop fields late Saturday afternoon, June 7, when Bruce Catt and his daughter, Caleigh, were flying over farmer Todd Young's 150-acre wheat field. Caleigh had a camera and took four photographs of ten circles crisply laid down in clockwise swirls amid the standing wheat. It is a fractal pattern similar to one in Canada a couple of years ago and reported at Earthfiles , which had eleven circles instead of ten. September 3, 1999, Neilburg, Saskatchewan, Canada Eleven-circle fractal pattern that measured 185 feet in diameter was discovered in wheat field on September 3, 1999, Neilburg, Saskatchewan, Canada.

July 29, 1996, Windmill Hill near Avebury, Wiltshire, England The Canada and Arkansas crop formations are a more simple variation on the fractal Julia Sets that have emerged in England since the mid-1990s. One at Windmill Hill near Avebury in 1996 covered a thousand feet in diameter with 194 circles in spiral arms. Triple Julia Set discovered July 29, 1996, at Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England near Avebury, the largest circle and avenue of standing sarsen stones in the British Isles, constructed around 3700 B. C. for spiritual rituals. This fractal formation of 194 circles spiraled for 1,000 feet in diameter. Photograph © 1996 by Steve Alexander. After Bruce Catt told Todd about the unusual crop formation in his wheat, Young went out to the field to see for himself on the ground and he also took an airplane ride to see it from the air. Later they measured the circles. The biggest was in the center, which was 47 feet wide. In the outer three slightly curving arms, the biggest circle was 28 feet diameter, the next was 17 feet diameter, and the smallest circles were 9 feet diameter."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ten-circle crop formation discovered in wheat on June 7, 2003, Knobel, Arkansas.
