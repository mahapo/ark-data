Photograph © 1998 by Charanis Chiu, Hong Kong Astronomical Society. November 6, 1999 Chula Vista, California The International Meteor Organization (IMO) has announced a call for meteor observations between midnight and dawn local times on November 10, 11 and 12. This is not for the famous Leonids. A newly discovered comet this year called Comet LINEAR made its closest approach to the Sun in September. Earth will be passing through whatever dusty debris the comet left in our planet's orbital path on November 11th. This new meteor shower will be called Linearids, not to be confused with Leonids that will arrive a week later on November 18th. Those dates are around New Moon, so dark skies beyond city lights will help meteor watches. But since no one has seen this comet before, scientists don't know whether it will leave a strong meteor wake or not. After astronomers studied the orbital elements of Comet LINEAR, it's estimated that this comet cycles through the inner solar system only once every 63,000 years. If it left enough debris to produce a good meteor shower, the Linearids will appear to come from the bowl of the Big Dipper constellation. Earth's closest approach to Comet LINEAR's orbital wake will be at 2:41 PM EST so Asia might have the best chance to see. In contrast, Comet Tempel-Tuttle that produces the annual November 17-18 Leonid meteor shower cycles through every thirty-three years. Since it passed closest to the sun in February 1998, the November showers in 1998 and 1999 were expected to produce dramatic displays. Last year, the Leonids peaked over Europe with about 300 meteors flashing through the sky each hour. Some astronomers are predicting even more this year over western Europe and the Atlantic.

The best time to start watching in the United States will be from midnight to dawn on both November 17 and 18. Most will appear to come from the constellation Leo traveling at more than 158,000 miles per hour. When the comet's dust and rocky debris hit the earth's atmosphere, they can appear red to pink in color or white and blue-white to pale green. More Information: For Linearid Watching November 10, 11 and 12 : Experts aren't sure what time is best to try observing because so little is known about the distribution of dust around this new comet that has not been through the inner solar system for 63,000 years. But the place to watch is the Big Dipper from midnight on. For Leonid Watching November 17-18 : The Leonids might be more spectacular this year than 1998. Most comfortable way to watch will be to lay down in a lawn chair with your feet pointing towards the east and the constellation Leo. Most of the meteors will appear to come from there and might exceed the 300 flashes per hour in 1998.
