Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Crashed Disc Photos, \"Ebens,\" and Area 51 \"Anti-Gravity\" Â© 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe T hree disc crash sites in New Mexico labeled LZ-1, 2 and 3 (Landing Zones) are described in leaked Majestic-12 documents, allegedly official TOP SECRET MAJIC government accounts of what really happened between July 4 to 6, 1947, between Corona and Roswell, at the Trinity Site on White Sands, and east of Alamogordo on the Mescalero Apache Reservation. February 10, 2006 - Three weeks ago on Coast to Coast AM radio, I had information from military, political and scientific sources about an aerial disc technology - defined as \"interplanetary\" and \"extraterrestrial\" by the Truman administration. That disc technology which the public and media have called \"UFOs\" - interfered with our V-2 rocket tests at New Mexico's White Sands Proving Ground, beginning around 1947. We even shot at those discs and there was retaliation. During the radio program open lines, a man named \"Don\" called in and said his uncle from the U. S. Navy had a briefcase containing TOP SECRET files and B&W photographs of crashed discs and entities. Don said his uncle showed the contents of the briefcase to him sometime before his uncle's death in 2002 - and before his uncle burned everything \"under orders,\" he said. I asked Don if he would leave his phone number for me to follow up. In this report, I would like to share some of the details Don told me about the photographs and his uncle's alleged firsthand experiences with live humanoids classified as \"extraterrestrial biological entities\" (EBEs or EBENs). Don told me there was not just one crash. He said there were two others at the same time one near the Trinity Site on White Sands where we exploded the first atomic bomb test in July 1945. The third was east of Alamogordo and Holloman AFB on the Mescalero Indian Reservation. Those three crash sites are consistent with the leaked MJ-12 documents that Bob and Ryan Wood have published. One is dated July 22, 1947, and entitled \"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary.\" Another is \"Majestic Twelve Project's 1st Annual Report.\" The July 22, 1947 \"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit\" TOP SECRET summary begins: \"The extraordinary recovery of fallen airborne objects in the state of New Mexico between 4 July to 6 July 1947\" and states that about a half hour before the clock turned to midnight going into July 4, 1947, \"radar stations in east Texas and White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico, tracked two unidentified aircraft until both dropped off radar. Two crash sites have been located close to the White Sands Proving Ground.\" The report specifies one is near Corona and the other is near Oscura Peak and the Trinity Site at White Sands. Later in the Majestic Twelve 1st Annual Report, more was known and a third crash site is listed as 30 miles east of Alamogordo on the Mescalero Indian Reservation. According to "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the government reports, bodies were found at both the Corona and Trinity Site locations. Don told me his uncle showed him B&W photographs of all three crash sites. Near Corona, he said there were photographs of the craft that was embedded in a hillside and two entities standing up alive. There were also two smaller, dead bodies on the ground one had an arm and leg cut off and the other had a slice across its belly. Don assumed this happened from the crash impact. Paragraphs from \"Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary\" D ated: July 22, 1947 from U. S. War Department L anding Zone 2 (LZ-2) was ten miles northwest of Oscura Peak on White Sands Proving Ground as it was known in 1940s."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Majestic Twelve Project 1st Annual Report A bove : Page 8 of \"Majestic Twelve Project: 1st Annual Report, Annex A\" after 1947 disc crashes and retrievals.

Afterward, he invited me to call him further with any follow up questions I might have. A couple of days later, Don was not returning my phone calls and finally he left this voice message on my phone: \"Hi, Linda. It's Don. The reason I ain't returned your calls your phone's been bugged. I've been getting some calls. And I've had people following me, so I'm going to kind of back out of this. I don't know what to tell you. You can call me, and I'll answer it. But I ain't going to say anything else. This is getting a little bit too scary because I just had a feeling I shouldn't have opened up. But I figured it was a dead source. But it still ain't dead.\" Let's go back about five years ago when Don's Navy uncle was alive, but dying from a blood disease and other ailments. Don says the briefcase was old, cracked leather, from which his uncle took out file folders, documents and black and white photographs of the July 1947 crashes in New Mexico by other-worldly aerial discs. Two brief clarifications: Don said there were no ears on the beings, only tiny slits. But he uses the word, \"ears.\" And he says his uncle referred to \"beyond our galaxy\" and thinks that means outside our Milky Way galaxy, not just beyond our solar system. But he isn't sure. He begins with describing the stamp on the back of a photograph of the craft embedded in a hill near Corona. Don, U. S. Marine Corps Special Forces and Uncle (mother's brother) in U. S. Navy from 1940s to 1950s : \"On the back, it said: 'Property of the United States Navy TOP SECRET.' PROPERTY OF THE NAVY? Yeah. DID YOU EVER SEE THE LETTERS 'MAJIC' STAMPED ON ANY OF IT? It was across the top of the folder. It was in solid black in big bold letters. And (there were) B&W photos. YOU SAW THESE PHOTOS WITH YOUR OWN EYES, RIGHT? Yeah, the first one was a craft in the side of a hill at an angle. Two bodies were on the outside and two were standing upright. The two dead were one I remember was looked like he was just split open, like someone took a knife and just laid him open (across belly). The other was missing a leg and an arm. Skin from B&W (photos), you really can't tell. Estimated height would be somewhere between three to four feet. Egg-shaped head. Long arms. Short legs. Long, pointy fingers. Mouths were round. It wasn't like our mouths. It was more like an oval shape. DO YOU MEAN OVAL UP AND DOWN? OR OVAL GOING SIDEWAYS? Sideways. OK. SO, YOU WERE NOT LOOKING AT JUST A THIN LINE. Right. WAS IT ESPECIALLY DARK COMPARED TO THEIR SKIN? About the same color as their eyes in a B&W photo because their eyes were at a slanted angle with a darkness to them. And they tapered down to like a little point where it goes toward the ears. THE POINTS WENT TOWARD THE EARS, NOT TOWARD THE NOSE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The points went toward the ear (slits). Their skin looked wrinkled almost like it had some kind of uniform on it. But, I really don't know. And it was just like you take a piece of paper and put a little crease in it. You know how the actresses use skin tone body suits? YES. I would put it somewhere in that category. DID YOUR UNCLE EXPLAIN HOW THEY GOT THAT DISC EMBEDDED IN THE HILL OUT? WHAT DID THEY PUT IT ON? HOW DID THEY MOVE IT? It was moved by a flatbed truck covered under a tarp with two cranes that removed it from the side of the hill and moved it in the middle of the night. YOU THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS 30 FEET IN DIAMETER? Ye s . DID YOUR UNCLE MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT OUR MILITARY FIRING AT THESE DISCS? Our military fired at them, but it didn't do any good. We were told not to tell anybody for the rest of our lives. But I figured Hey! It's time to let it out. Why Persistent U. S. Government Denial? RIGHT. I WONDERED IF HE SAID ANYTHING THAT DAY WHEN HE WAS SHOWING YOU ALL THE MATERIAL FROM HIS BRIEFCASE? DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT WHY THE SECRET WOULD STILL BE KEPT IN WHAT ESSENTIALLY NOW IS THE 21ST CENTURY? They just don't want the American people to know that E.T.s, or humanoids, or whatever you want to call them, exist. And that some of them could have the power to literally wipe us off the face of the Earth. DID HE SAY THAT? Ye s . DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT WHO THESE ENTITIES WERE? WHERE THEY WERE FROM? THAT SORT OF THING? They are from outside our galaxy. That's all he would tell us. And that they were trying to teach us what they knew of different forms of medicine. They were strictly here for peace. FROM ANOTHER GALAXY? Yeah. (I asked him if he meant \"from another solar system\"? But he said he remembered his uncle using the word galaxy and thought he meant beyond the Milky Way galaxy. This is different than the more \"traditional\" origin commonly given as the binary star system Zeta Reticuli I and II, about 37.5 light-years from Earth.) WHAT I THINK THE GOVERNMENT CALLS 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES\" THE ACRONYM IS EBEN. DID YOUR UNCLE EVER USE THAT TERM, 'EBEN\"? Yes, but he didn't pronounce it \"EBEN.\" WHAT DID HE SAY? He said it was \"EBB-un.\" Every now and then, you'd hear something on news, or they broadcast from Spain or somewhere else showing some unidentified thing. And they were explaining it as swamp gas and all this other stuff. And he'd just start laughing. You know, everybody would look at him like, 'What are you laughing at?' And he's say, 'If only the people only knew what it was.' HE TOLD YOU WHEN HE SHOWED YOU THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THESE EBENS WERE FROM ANOTHER GALAXY AND THAT THEY WERE HERE TO TEACH US ABOUT MEDICINE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Yes. And how to live in peace. THEY DON'T SEEM TO BE DOING A VERY GOOD JOB. No, they don't. Of course, the government ain't letting them out, either, are they? IT'S A VERY BIG PUZZLE. THAT'S WHY I'M HOPING MAYBE YOUR UNCLE TOLD YOU SOMETHING THAT WOULD GIVE US SOME INSIGHT INTO WHY IT IS ALL SEEMINGLY SO STRANGE, CONFUSING AND COMPLICATED. One letter I read was by a 'Wolkaman,' or 'Walkaman.' I don't remember the last name, but he said it would cause mass panic if the American citizens should find out about the E.T.s because they would automatically confuse them and terrorize them. THEY WOULD AUTOMATICALLY CONFUSE THE PUBLIC? Ye s . ND THE TERROR WOULD COME FROM WHAT? That it never went into detail. It just kind of ended there. I don't know if that meant terrorize the aliens? Or terrorize the American public? According to Truman, he didn't trust them. DO YOU KNOW WHY? No. It wasn't written. Truman just said to keep them (live captured EBENs) under confinement and not to let a word leak out. And that was for \"Private Eyes Only,\" if I remember the letterhead right. DID YOUR UNCLE TRY TO EXPLAIN TO YOU ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT HE UNDERSTOOD ABOUT WHY TRUMAN WOULD NOT TRUST THEM? No, he never did say that. But he had complete trust in them. YOUR UNCLE TRUSTED THE EBENS? Yes. He said he didn't feel any fear around them. Telepathic Communication SO YOUR UNCLE HAD BEEN FACE-TO-FACE WITH THEM? Ye s . DID HE HAVE TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION? Like a trance state he fell into when he was standing next to them. It was just like a thought pattern. He could tell what they were thinking and they read everything he was thinking. Yet, it sounded like they were talking back and forth. IT WAS INSIDE OF HIS HEAD? Right. DID HE HEAR HIS OWN THOUGHT VOICE? OR DID THE EBENS HAVE A DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT QUALITY OF SOUND INSIDE HIS HEAD? He said they had a higher pitch than we do. But it was completely inaudible, yet he could understand every word they were saying. DID HE EVER SAY, 'I ASKED THEM TELEPATHICALLY: WHY ARE YOU HERE?' AND HEAR FROM THEM DIRECTLY? He said basically they were here to shed peace upon the world and to teach us how to live in peace and to explain some of the medications that would cure 90% of the disease in the 1950s. MEDICATIONS? Right. HIS CLOSEST CONTACT WITH THE EBENS WAS IN 1947?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1948. IN 1948, AFTER THE (THREE) CRASHES (NEAR ROSWELL AND WHITE SANDS). Right. \"Anti-Gravity\" Demonstration by Ebens At Area 51 S-4 WHERE WAS THAT (CLOSE CONTACT)? Dreamland - Area 51, Groom Lake. AND THAT'S WHERE YOUR UNCLE WAS IN CONTACT WITH WAS IT ONE OR MORE EBENS? There was two there that he was in contact with. WERE THEY WORKING WITH OUR GOVERNMENT? Ye s . WERE THEY WORKING ON TECHNOLOGY? OR? The way he put it, it was a sealed room with a ball floating in mid-air suspended by nothing. WHAT WERE THEY DOING? What he witnessed was like how can I put it? one room in a room. Like there would be a cubicle inside of a larger room. There was a metal sphere - -what he described that was just literally being moved side-to-side, up and down with nothing holding it. WAS THE METAL SPHERE INSIDE OF A GLASS ROOM? Yes, it was glass, or plastic. THEN THERE WAS ANOTHER ROOM. WHERE WERE THE PEOPLE WATCHING THIS? In the exterior room. It would be like taking a cake and putting a small cake pan over the top of it, a clear one. And then taking a larger one and putting it over the top of the smaller one like a confinement area. AND YOUR UNCLE WAS IN THAT OUTER ROOM? Right. WHERE WERE THE TWO EBENS HE WAS WORKING WITH? One was sitting next to him. The other one was sitting next to some high-ranking bird colonel. WHAT WERE THE EBENS TRYING TO DEMONSTRATE FOR YOUR UNCLE AND THE BIRD COLONEL? Defying gravity. WERE THEY DOING IT WITH THEIR MIND? OR SOMETHING ELSE? Just with their mind. There was nothing else in there. OK, SO THE EBENS WERE TRYING TO SHOW THAT THEY COULD LIFT THE METAL SPHERES WITH THEIR MIND? Right. And according to what my uncle said, they (metal balls) weighed anywhere from 100 to 200 pounds. It was nothing it was like for them lifting a piece of paper. DID YOUR UNCLE UNDERSTAND WHY THE EBENS WERE DEMONSTRATING THAT FOR OUR GOVERNMENT AND MILITARY? Well, from what he theorized and what he could pick up, they were showing him the power of mind vs. matter. So, I don't know if the craft flies like that, or what?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Hand-Imprinted Control Panels in Discs DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE EBENS HAVING HAND-IMPRINTED PANELS AND A BAND AROUND THEIR HEADS THAT THEY USED TO FLY THE CRAFT WITH THEIR MIND? There was a hand-imprinted panel on two sides of the craft: one in the back and one in the front. So, I don't know if that was for a pilot and co-pilot? But he never mentioned nothing about a band. ABOUT WHAT? About a band around their head. BUT FROM YOUR DISCUSSION WITH HIM AND HIS EXPLAINING DOING THIS WORK AT AREA 51, YOU UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE BEINGS PROBABLY FLEW THE CRAFT WITH THEIR MINDS? From the impression he gave me, yes. THOSE HAND-IMPRINTED PANELS HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH BEING ABLE TO CONTROL THE CRAFT WITH THEIR MIND. Right like horizontal, vertically. It could have something to do with speed. I have no idea what they are powered by. And neither did he. So, we're assuming it's all mind over matter. 1945 Atomic Tests Caught EBENs Attention? WHY WOULD THEY HAVE COME FROM ANOTHER GALAXY ALL THE WAY TO HERE? A nuclear bomb explosion in what 1941? WE EXPLODED THE FIRST ATOMIC DEVICE AT TRINITY SITE AT WHITE SANDS IN JULY OF 1945. OK, that's the only thing he would say. It had something to do with the first bomb we blew off. We were getting too powerful for our little, tiny planet. It would be like a Star Trek film where a parent body would be watching over its child. That's the way he kind of described it. E arly stage of Fat Boy \"gadget\" atomic bomb test on July 16, 1945, at Trinity Site, WSPG, which detonated at 05:29:45 local Mountain War Time with energy equivalent to 19 kilotons of TNT. The Seattle Times : \"The heat was so intense that it vaporized the tower holding the bomb and melted the sand underneath into a green glass dubbed Trinitite. A mile away, exposed surfaces were heated to 750 degrees. At 10 miles, the heat still felt like the open mouth of a fireplace, witnesses reported. Despite bulldozing away the fused sand, the radiation levels today, half a century later, are still ten times that of the background radiation levels found in nature from radioactive rocks and cosmic rays.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"O ne of the few color photographs of the Trinity atomic bomb. Physicist and Los Alamos Director, J. Robert Oppenheimer, later quoted from the Hindu Bhagavad Gita : \"I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\" SO, DID YOUR UNCLE EVER SUGGEST THAT HUMAN BEINGS MIGHT HAVE BEEN MADE BY THESE EBENS? He thought about it, but he couldn't prove it. WHEN YOU SAY HE THOUGHT ABOUT IT, WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU SPECIFICALLY? Specifically? He said we are all probably from outer space and don't know it. THAT WE HUMANS ARE? Ye s . THAT THERE MIGHT BE A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WHAT HE CALLED THE 'EBB-uns' AND I'VE HEARD 'EBENS,' THE ONES THAT WERE IN THE CRASHES AT ROSWELL AND HUMANITY? Right. WHY, IF THEY ARE SO ADVANCED, IF THEY CAN CONTROL CRAFT WITH THEIR MIND, IF THEY CAN MENTALLY LIFT UP HEAVY METALLIC BALLS INSIDE OF A GLASS ROOM AT AREA 51 WHY WOULD THEIR CRAFT HAVE EVER CRASHED IN NEW MEXICO OR ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE PLANET? Up to his dying day, he couldn't even figure out why there was such a tight lid on it. But he did make one comment that didn't make any sense he said: 'The government will never know and some of them are actually ours.' And I have no idea what that means. Somebody was watching him until the day he died. But he didn't say if it was Intel? Or just somebody the President of U. S. assigned to watch over him? Or the Navy assigned to watch over him? Or who was assigned to watch over him? Because he didn't know. WHY, THEN, DO YOU THINK THAT HE PULLED OUT THAT OLD BRIEFCASE WITH THE FILES AND PHOTOGRAPHS FROM ROSWELL, THE TOP SECRET DOCUMENTS ONE EVEN LABELED 'MAJIC'? WHY DID HE DO THAT? Just to get rid of it because he said that was his orders - to destroy everything if he thought he was going to die. He found out he was going to die within two years. AND HE DECIDED TO SHOW YOU ALL? Yes, because we kept bugging him. AND THEN HE BURNED IT. Yes, and that was the end of it. BUT WHY WOULD HE HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO KEEP ALL OF THIS MATERIAL IN A BRIEFCASE IN THE FIRST PLACE? That I don't know.\""},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"More Information: F or more information about UFO phenomena, please see the following reports in Earthfiles Archives and the books and documentaries listed in Earthfiles Shop.
