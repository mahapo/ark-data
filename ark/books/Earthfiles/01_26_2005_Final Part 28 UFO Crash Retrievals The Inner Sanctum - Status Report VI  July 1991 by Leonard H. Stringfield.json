Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard Stringfield: (PHOTO PHANTASIES continued) \"3) Sensation and mystery were the names of the game when a real looking alien photo made its rounds in Europe in late 1990. First to burst on the scene was a black and white photo that surfaced from a Russian source which showed a front view of a chubby-faced dead 'alien' with slanting eyelids covering a large pair of eyes. According to Michael Hesemann in Germany, who got an exclusive copy from a reliable Russian source, the photo had a 'Canadian connection,' rumored to be a scientist who had sent a copy to the late Felix Zigel in Russia. Zigel, a scientist known to the Western nations, was the Soviet's leading UFO researcher going back into the 1970s. I published some of his findings in Situation Red: The UFO Siege. Also, it was rumored that the alien in the photo had a Roswell connection. Suddenly, its aura of mystery became important. Hesemann, sensing its importance, trustingly sent three or four copies to American researchers for examination and, as always, copies were soon in the hands of everybody. As research pondered its significance, a few willing to accept it as 'proof,' another photo in color, showing a face similar to the black and white copy, began to mushroom in Europe. I got a copy from Rene Erik Olsen, a researcher in Copenhagen, Denmark, in December 1990. When I called him to learn his source, he could only say that it came from England. The mystery was soon solved. When I called Christian Page in Canada, requesting data on the Carp crash case, we talked about other subjects, too, including alien photos such as the rib cage phony and the photo that was currently circulating showing the fat-faced alien. Page, disturbed that it was making news, came out forthright to say that he was the person who took the colored photo in 1979 at a Montreal exhibition. Said Page in his letter of May 30, 1991, quoted in part: '... The humanoid in the picture, despite its amazing realism, was simply a wax reproduction that I had photographed at the Pavillon de 1 insolite, in Montreal, one of the permanent exhibits built for the Universal Exposition in 1967.' Page further stated that the dummy was real-sized and dressed in a metallic suit (in reality, a scuba diver suit) and rested lengthwise under a plexiglass cylinder. So ends the speculation and the mystery.

According to Russian sources, the photo was found in the files of the late Felix Zigel, a noted Russian UFOlogist, starting rumors that it came from a Canadian scientist and that it had a Roswell connection. Facts, however, show that the alien was nothing more than a wax dummy, lying prone under a Plexiglas canopy, on exhibition in Montreal, Canada, dating back to 1967. When the story about the photo reached Canadian researcher Christian Page, he explained that he could account for the exhibited dummy with a photograph he had taken in 1979. See story in this report. Small photo, courtesy of Michael Hesemann, Munich, Germany.\" A FINAL THOUGHT ABOUT THE INNER SANCTUM William Safire, in his nationally syndicated column on August 1, 1991, describes the strange world of espionage as a 'surreal but real world replete with mystery, violence, hall-of-mirrors deception, the suspension of morality and the interplay of human intelligence.' Analogously, it seems to fit the operations of the Inner Sanctum, a metaphorical label I use to identify the clandestine forces who control every aspect of the UFO problem. I have become a part of this surreal world by both circumstance and choice, the latter of which I exemplify by publishing Status Report VI. In summary, I believe that the so-called Inner Sanctum has substantial evidence of alien artifacts and life forms behind its walls. To announce all of its sobering secrets would be a risk that could re-shape our philosophies. In some ways, I can sympathize with the enormity of this public relations problem. Special to Status Report VI OPERATION DESERT STORM'S 'BAGHDAD BILLY' -- SHADES OF THE 'FOO FIGHTER' OF WORLD WAR II The following disclosure, received from a reliable source requesting anonymity, is an analogy of the UFO's past and current behavior during wartime. Pilots flying nighttime combat missions over Iraq, during Operation Desert Storm, encountered aerial interlopers which they eventually dubbed 'Baghdad Billy.' Although an object did not appear on radar, pilots described 'Baghdad Billy' as a steady white light which suddenly focused on their aircraft while its source flew parallel off either wingtip. Each incident was of short duration. While totally unsettling to the pilots during the initial encounters, there were no known hostile incidents. EPILOGUE: The Mixed Bag of Information As I prepare the final copy of this manuscript for the printer, I find writing the Epilogue is like sorting out worms from a can as new information, some of it disconcerting, continues to come in from diverse sources. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One caller aired his frustration over the inability to get a prospective 'inside' crash/retrieval source to talk. Three others called to relate that they had tried and failed to get additional information from their firsthand sources whose stories are included in this report. While most contributors spoke reassuringly about their disclosures, two, however, gave me cause for concern, reporting that they have reason to suspect certain acts of mischief, perhaps as a 'warning message,' that could affect their livelihoods. One of the concerned informants called also to relate that he had been reliably informed of some new and nagging information that is in concurrence with the early, critical days of the foofighters, ghost rockets, green fireballs and the New Mexican saucer crashes, all of which might have a German World War II connection. One item of note was that a saucer had crashed in July of 1947 that had ties with a U. S. 'biological experiment.' Incongruously, another item - according to my source - made reference to a retrieved saucer with artifacts exhibiting 'paleo-Hebraic' inscriptions. But, the gist of his revelations was that the reported crashes of UFOs with 'alien' bodies in 1947 was the beginning of a colossal cover-up to hide secret U. S. rocket experiments. I've expressed my thoughts before about the alleged German scientists connection and I ask again: why should maximum secrecy prevail today to hide outmoded rocket and aircraft experiments in the late 1940s? To have had a craft that could perform like a foofighter, why was it not used in the Korean or Vietnam wars or to rescue American hostages in Iran instead of helicopters? Details of the nature of the 'mischiefs' affecting both contributors must go unsaid at this time. But it is noteworthy that both calls came to me within a two-day period, July 26-27, and if they are UFO-connected, it would certainly dampen the hopes for an officially relaxed policy. Setting aside for the moment the diversions of human frustration, nagging theory and seeming intrigue, let us now join Cheri Manet, a lady in Texas I feel that I can trust. She revealed to me that she had a close friend, a Major General in the U.S. Air Force with need-to-know credentials. According to Cheri, he told her piecemeal, over a period of years, the real story of the UFO without once compromising details to breach his secrecy oath. Faithfully, she kept notes of his disclosures until his death in 1987. Our acquaintance began as a result of a relative who had an unusual UFO sighting and she got my name from a researcher who had read Situation Red, The UFO Siege. When Cheri mentioned her stored away notes, I expressed my interest. Although her family at first advised that she not share her notes with anybody, in time after many chats, she relented on the condition that I would not reveal the General's identity or the names of the air bases where he had served as Commanding Officer. I pledged my confidentiality. Her letter of June 4, 1991, with deletions, follows: Cheri Manet's Notes: ' ...I met the general during the summer of 1976 at a function I attended on behalf of my company, Southwestern Bell. A few days later he called, asking me out to lunch. I went and it was the beginning of a long and beautiful friendship. Even though there was over 25 years difference in our ages, we seemed to be on the same wave length. We stayed close until his death in 1987. ...After World War II, he was Commanding Officer of a European air base and later was C. O. at a western base in the USA. He had retired just before we met, but the Air Force still included him in meetings of high level importance which he called 'gray out' meetings. Of course, he could not tell me what they were about. Not long after we met, we briefly discussed UFOs. I don't remember exactly how it came about, but I told him about my family's experience ... I remember saying to him that I always wondered if the Air Force covered up sightings. He just smiled and never said a word. I asked if he personally believed in UFOs and aliens and he said that he did without a doubt and couldn't understand how any thinking person could not believe. It was well over a year before he trusted me enough to talk about the subject. However, when he became a director of a museum, we talked a lot about space and the UFOs. I remember once when he called, telling me about his meeting with astronauts Armstrong and Stafford and how their lives had been forever changed by what they had seen and heard. Some of the astronauts, he said, were having trouble dealing with some of the new concepts they must accept. He didn't go into detail."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The following is in bits and pieces from our conversations over the years. He mentioned UFO crashes with aliens dead and alive. He told me there was a very high-level cover-up and that it went all the way to the highest office in the land. Most of the information was in a Pentagon file that might one day be seen, but it was not the important stuff. It was kept separate and would never see the light of day. When I asked why it was so secret, he said that the general public couldn't handle what we knew. I told him that I was general public and that I thought I could handle it. He said, perhaps I could, but it would shake even my belief system were I to know all the facts. He also told me that many of the UFO sightings were our own experimental ships and that the United States has had its own flying saucer-type aircraft for quite awhile. I asked if he had seen them and, if so, where. He said, yes, and on more than one occasion at a base in the western part of the U. S. He asked me if I had ever heard of the crash at Roswell, New Mexico? At the time, I had very little information on the crash, just some vague things I couldn't even remember where I heard them. He said that in the summer of 1947, a saucer had crashed on a man's ranch outside of Roswell. He said some of the material taken from the crash went to Ft. Worth and when tested, it was beyond our technology. Some pieces, he said, had symbols inscribed that looked like Egyptian hieroglyphics to him. He told me that he had seen the film explaining the whole case and it was top secret at the time. Some of the information has leaked out, he said, but even so, the government will never go public with it because they would have to explain the cover-up and that would open the door to more questions. He said there had been other crashes like Roswell, some with dead aliens and some not. ...On one occasion, he had been taken to a base in a western state where he saw, firsthand, a UFO that had crashed in the 1960s which had only minor structural damage. He said he was amazed to see such a thing, describing it as 100 feet long and 30 feet wide, with small windows around the bottom, but he was not allowed to board it. According to my notes, he also told me that we had a live alien taken from a crash site that had been studied at a base in California. He heard this from a high-ranking friend who had been involved in the study. He preferred not to elaborate. He later even seemed a little uneasy that he had mentioned it. When I asked him how long did he think the government could keep it all secret, he replied as long as it wishes. He said that it involves national security and how we deal with other countries. He pointed out that years ago, UFOs were spotted over the White House, and we were helpless to do anything about it. If that were to be common knowledge, we could lose control. The incident got some coverage at the time, he said, but it was quickly covered up.' Len Stringfield: \"On July 14, 1991, John Lear called me from his home in Las Vegas to ask about the progress of my status report that I had discussed with him in April. He asked if I had made any references to his friend, Bob Lazar, a scientist well-known for his bold revelations in 1989 relating to his work at a secret installation in Area 51 at Groom Lake, Nevada. I replied that I had not on the basis that I had not heard anything new from him for more than a year. Lear explained that Bob preferred not to get involved with researchers and the media, but he would try to arrange for him to talk with me soon. The next day, Bob called me from his home, explaining that he had only a few minutes to answer some questions I had prepared. Most of his answers to my questions provided nothing new on subjects such as Element 115, the time dilation factor, the pressure of working and living under constant surveillance, and the threats he endured when he went public. Of specific interest, I questioned him if he had seen, or had knowledge of, the use of large crystals as focusing elements for the propulsion drive of the craft. He replied that he had not seen crystals in the craft to which he had access, nor had he heard of the use of crystals. I asked because I was told by an 'inside' source, identified as Dr. Nick, that crystals were very much in evidence in an alien craft that had undergone extensive studies at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1976. Dr. Nick, who was introduced to me by John Ford of LIUFON, revealed to me in a tape received July 14, 1991, that he was sent to the base to study the electronic systems of the craft. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In an earlier interview with Ford, during which time he also disclosed that he had been involved in the Moriches Bay retrieval operation, Dr. Nick stated, '... the drive for the craft is anti-gravity in nature and the crystals help in tuning in the right frequencies for the drive to work.' He added, 'The wide use of crystals in their instruments indicates that one or several crystals perform entire functions of computer chips ...' With such an elaborate array of crystals in one alien craft and to the contrary, no crystalline evidence in any of the craft visible to Bob Lazar, I could not help but wonder if the aliens were utilizing radically different drive systems. Or, if the crystal system represented the technology of another alien origin? Or if the crystals were rigged up as a dummy for Dr. Nick for purposes of disinformation? Or, was the gadgetry a secret U. S. experiment which needed his expertise? Of course, we don't know the whole Bob Lazar story either. But, it is a point to be seriously considered. Now, back to Lazar. I asked about the storage facilities on the craft for food or other means of sustenance and the accommodations for body wastes. He said he saw none. I asked about the size of seats near the control panel. 'Small,' he said, and added, 'The size to hold an infant aged about 18 months.' Then, to wrap up our chat, I asked if he still stood by all the statements he had made publicly. His response: 'Yes, indeed.' And finally, I asked if Lear still believed that the nine craft Lazar said he had seen in Area 51 were of extraterrestrial origin? 'Absolutely, positively,' Lear answered. Where do I stand at this point in time in relation to the voluminous pile of information I have received in recent months? I must say that my special research into UFO crash/retrievals seems to be sensitively close to reality. Bill Moore, a past critic of my work, stated in his September 30, 1989, issue of Focus, quoted in part: Bill Moore, Focus, September 30, 1989: 'Drawing from my own knowledge and experience, I can summarize the individuals and organizations who were the subject of intelligence community interest between 1980 and 1984. It is important to remember here that in some cases, I was not personally involved, but rather only aware of these goings-on through conversations with others. ...Stringfield remained the subject of some interest through 1983, after which I heard very little about him. The C/I people seemed to know a lot about Len and his sources. The impression I had was that someone else much closer to him than I was keeping tabs on his activities, but of course, I never knew for certain.' Fortunately, I have other sources today who seem to know that I am currently a subject of interest to the intelligence community. If I could draw any conclusions from the travails of my past experiences, then I am also being subjected to both good information and disinformation to use in this report. To get a balance of views, I flipped over the proverbial coin to Dick Hall, a board member of the Fund for UFO Research and a trusted colleague since 1954, for his critique of my finished manuscript. His response to the revelations of some of my informants, as expected, was on the line with no punches pulled. 'Barnabas' was the first target. Said Dick, 'Who is Albert Collins (alias Barnabas)? He has no credentials. Why should we believe anything he says? Statements about Rand, the CIA and the Vatican sound like something the other Cooper (William) would cook up.' Next, the Air Force Colonel (via Tim Cooper): Said Dick, 'Though the Colonel's statements contain some nuggets of truth, others about science, technology and military affairs sound questionable.' Regarding Dr. Epigoni, Dick was bothered by some of the statements he made in one interview which were in obvious conflict with those he made later. 'Dr. Nick,' said Dick, 'does not inspire confidence at all, engaging in pseudo-science and gobbledygook. For example, the Doppler Radar System is for traffic control to spot storm systems and to term it a 'weapon' is outrageously false. I am willing to bet that he is a fraud or disinformation specialist. Finally I ask: If disinformation is as rampant as it seems, what are the orchestraters hiding/ considering the time and money spent on hall-of-mirror distortion of facts to confuse researchers, there must be a purpose. Is hiding the truth, as the Major General told Cheri Manet, truly in mankind's best interest? "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Veritas Vincet Leonard H.
