Polaroid by Sheriff Tex Graves, Budin Ranch, Logan County, northeastern Colorado, 1976. September 22, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After my Emmy Award-winning television documentary, A Strange Harvest, was first broadcast on the CBS affiliate in Denver, Colorado, KMGH-TV, on May 25, 1980, I assembled a chronological list of animal mutilation reports as the year unfolded. The following is the 1980 summary I typed up for my private research file and now share for the first time in this Earthfiles Real X-File. Addresses, phone numbers and some names of ranchers and eyewitnesses have been deleted. February 1980 February 22 - Gastonia, North Carolina, horse owners Doris and Ben Scott: Mrs. Scott has lived in Gastonia all her life. On February 22, 1980, their 6-year-old stallion was found ALIVE and mutilated in its boarding barn. The stall was boarded from floor to ceiling on all four sides and had a solid door that latched. The stall was 14 feet by 14 feet. \"There was no way for predators to get in and the walls were completely clean of blood,\" said Mrs. Scott. The stallion had been moved to the boarding barn about two months before to separate him from some pregnant mares the Scotts had. He was the only stallion in the boarding barn at the time; there were some other mares. He was a voice-trained breeding stud, very intelligent, and a great friend of Ben Scott, the son, with whom the horse played hide and seek when Ben was a teenager. Ben Scott, now in his early twenties, had a routine of feeding the horse every afternoon at 5 p.m. on his way home from work. He worked at the Cotawba River Nuclear Power Plant near Gastonia, about 30 miles north of the boarding barn.) On February 22, the owners of the boarding barn actually found the stallion before Ben Scott got there. The horse was standing up in the stall with blood on his stomach and dripping down his legs from the penis. The floor was soaked with blood, but there were no blood spatters on the walls anywhere. Veterinarian A. B. of Shelby, North Carolina was called. Dr. B. found the penis had been cut off up into the horse's pelvic area (12 to 14 inches) and the veterinarian did not know how this had been done. No organ or piece of flesh of any kind was ever found. Dr. B. got down on his hands and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knees four times to sift through the floor and outside the stall. Testicles were still there and so was the foreskin. Dr. B. did not do blood tests because he did not think there was any reason at the time. He was trying to save the horse's life. But the horse bled to death after Ben Scott arrived and held the horse's head. Dr. B. said the horse would have kicked a person to death if the horse were not anesthetized in order to do such extraordinary surgery and too much anesthesia would make it hard to stimulate the horse to remove the entire penis. Dr. B. is still very puzzled by what happened to the Scott horse in Gastonia, North Carolina. March 1980 March 30 - Jake Bauer of Cripple Creek: Jake had a 9-month-old Arabian stallion, a horse that won ribbons at the local 4-H contest. The evening of March 30, about 7:30 p.m. Mt., Jake fed his horse. The corral was about 30 feet from his back door. He and his wife slept in a bedroom along with their dogs next to the corral. That night, none of the dogs barked and they did not wake up. But in the morning at 7:30 a.m., Jake found his prize horse dead and mutilated in the corral not far from their bedroom window. a) Rectum cored out with about 12-inch-wide hole that went in to the horse's body about 12 inches in a \"cone shape,\" as described by Jake Bauer. b) \"Strange cloudiness\" in one eye. \"The eye was silvery in color, kind of clouded over with a light scum, as though he might have been blinded,\" said Police Chief C. G. \"Gus\" Carlson. \"The other eye appeared normal.\" c) There were 4 to 5 inches of snow in the corral. There were no tracks or footprints or blood around the horse. Some rabbit tracks Bauer noticed, but not near his horse. And three other horses were alive and well at the other end of the corral. d) During the night, none of the Bauers or their two large dogs were awakened by any noise, even though their bedroom window was not far from the corral. e) A veterinarian in Woodland Park told Jake Bauer he would look at the animal if Bauer would bring the animal to him, the vet. \"However, we had no way to transport the animal to Woodland Park,\" Bauer told me, \"so it was taken to the town dump where it lay exposed for two to three days. Before it was covered, we noticed that no coyote, crow, no other kind of wild animal approached the horse to eat it.\" Police Chief Carlson expressed surprise that crows and coyotes never touched the carcass. And finally, he told the dump to bury the horse. f) No photographs were taken by anyone of the mutilated horse. The Chief of Police told me he was \"out of film.\" April 1980 April 21 - Gary Bohrer, Ramah, Colorado: The Gary Bohrer family found their 14-year-old gelding dead and mutilated. The family knew that on Sunday, April 20, the horse was fine when Mrs. Bohrer and her son visited Reble and Bandito, a mare, who shared a pasture 1.5 miles south of Ramah, Colorado. The meadow, a low-lying area, is surrounded by small hills, which obstruct a view of the area from any residence in Ramah or from U. S. Highway 24. a) 18-by-13-inch piece of hide was removed from between rear legs. b) Rectum cored out and internal organs were missing. c) Penis had been skinned. d) Animal's right eyelid severed. e) Part of right ear gone. \"When we arrived on the scene, the mare was grazing near Reble,\" said Mrs. Bohrer. \"It took my husband two hours to catch her, which was most unusual. She seemed scared to death to let us touch her.\" El Paso County Sheriff's Deputy Terry Steinert wrote in his report: \"The dead horse was located about one-half mile north of Ramah Highway. The horse's head was pointing west, the tail area east, the legs pointed north. The horse is a quarter horse, 13 years of age, brown in color and 15 hands high. The right eye and ear were missing from the horse, possibly removed by a sharp object. The penis of the horse had been skinned. An area 18 inches by 12 inches was cut"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"around the anus area. The whole anus was missing. A check of the horse found no penetrating marks.\" f) Veterinarian W. S. of Kiowa was supposed to see the horse, but did not. The vet said in a phone call with me that he has never seen an animal that he could not explain as natural death followed by predator cutting holes, so he was not curious to see the Bohrer horse. April 26 - Robert Blake, south of Simla, Colorado: 16-year-old quarter horse stud named \"Skip Easy Cash\" was found on April 26, 1980, lying on his left side in a grove of trees. The horse was in good shape five days before on April 21, when Mrs. Blake checked their herd. a) Horse's right ear was cut off at scalp. b) Right eyeball was intact, but all around it in a clean circle the mucus and tissue had been cut away. c) Lower lip was cut away in a beveled shape. d) Strips of skin were cut from the horse's penis and testicles, the strip furthest to the right (direction of horse's head) was about 2 inches long and 3/4 inches wide. The next vertical strip excised (toward tail) was slightly shorter. Right next to it was another vertical strip of testicle skin excised that was even shorter. The next excised strip was even shorter - all like a descending scale from penis along testicles. e) Rectum was cored out. f) 8 feet south of the horse's head, a tree had been twisted 180 degrees about 4 feet above the ground. Not known how. I didn't hear about the highly strange horse mutilation until mid-May and on May 23, 1980, I traveled to Robert Blake's ranch with mining engineer and UFO investigator, Richard Sigismund of Boulder, Colorado, in the late afternoon so we could experiment with various mining black lights in the dark to see if any parts of the horse fluoresced as reported in other mutilation cases. Richard picked up a higher than background reading on his Geiger counter at the twisted tree break. El Paso County Sheriff's Office also reported elevated Geiger counter reading at the tree twist in April when they visited the site, but dismissed everything as predator. Also, 25 feet directly east of the horse, another tree was scorched black on one side, the northwest side, starting about 4 feet above the ground and extending for about four feet up the trunk. The top branches of the tree also appeared to be narrowly blackened, scorched amid bright green limbs on either side. Other notes: 1) Horse was last seen in pasture 1/2 mile north of mutilation site on the night of April 23rd - which is probably the night that the Blake horse was killed and oddly mutilated. 2) Woman 1 mile east and a little north says she heard \"helicopter\" that night around 2 a.m. 3) Three weeks after the horse was killed and mutilated, some of the Blake sheep developed bluish-white eyes, appeared to be blind and foamed at the mouth. Robert Blake put pink eye medicine in and the eyes started to clear up in a couple of days. One ewe called \"No. 9\" still seemed affected. When Richard Sigismund and I beamed our flashlight at her from several feet back, her eyes seemed to glow a blue-white. But when we looked at the eyes close up in the light, they seemed normal. We used black light at both long wave and short wave frequencies on the sheep and found nothing abnormally glowing. 4) But the dead and mutilated stallion had a nearly perfect rectangle pattern that glowed under all the black light frequencies - but especially long wave - centered on the horse's nose right between his eyes. Robert Blake used his hunting knife to cut the glowing rectangle hide out for lab testing. 5) We cut out four other patches of hide from the back right upper leg. The meat underneath was so fresh and red colored, it astonished the rancher. That horse had been laying there on the ground for three weeks when we got there! \"It's like whatever mutilated this horse embalmed him!\" Robert Blake said. 6) No maggots on horse were found until that day we were there on Wednesday, May 23, 1980, a full month after the horse was first found dead and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"mutilated. \"That's impossible,\" Robert Blake told me, \"but that's what's happened. Like I said, that horse was embalmed!\" Lab test: I sent some of the fluorescent rectangle hide to the Schoenfeld Lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that had studied other blood and tissue from Dulce, New Mexico, cattle mutilations. a) Schoenfeld confirmed that the hide does fluoresce under long and short wave, especially under long wave, even on the back side of the skin opposite the hide hair. b) Potassium measured 167 compared to normal value of 59. Another patch of horse hide that we had gathered away from the excisions as a control actually measured highest for potassium at 361. Magnesium 32.6 on fluorescent hide; 38.0 on control hide. c) Mass spectrometer can look at drugs. Wash hair with methyl alcohol and inorganic element such as salt will still be there to analyze. Mass spectrometer came up with nothing unusual on fluorescent hide. But when I asked Schoenfeld what made the hide fluoresce in a nearly perfect rectangle, he said he was puzzled because he could not confirm a fluorescing substance. Confusing. On or about April 25 - Grand Junction, Colorado: Investigator Bob Silva of the Mesa County Sheriff's office said the death of a Hereford heifer was \"weird - really weird.\" Silva was summoned to range land along Douglas Pass about 30 miles NW of Grand Junction by Fruita rancher Ed Young. According to Silva, the cow's throat had been slit vertically about six inches and the teats were cleanly cut off. The incident was the first cattle mutilation reported to the Mesa County Sheriff's office in Silva's recollection and the story was picked up by the wire services and reported in newspapers and on TV. Reporter Mindy Pratt at the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel told me that in July 1976, another rancher named Ed Krizley found a breeder sheep (ewe) dead with its \"face removed and throat slit.\" “M utilations - what's the answer?
