February 26, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - I have received hundreds of emails the past few days from Earthfiles viewers and Earthfiles podcast listeners, as well as COAST and Dreamland listeners, about the aerial lights and symbols in Stephenville and Dublin, Texas, as well as the unidentified white, glowing “plasma” sphere phenomenon at the Brownwood, Texas, deer feeder. Below are some of the images and correspondence. I welcome viewer and listener comments to: earthfiles@earthfiles.com. 1) Subject: Government Confiscated Infra-red Pictures Date: February 23, 2008 1:19:29 AM MST To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I have had my infra-red film confiscated by the government when sent in for processing. The camera company had no explanation and only offered a free roll of film for the trouble. I wish I could have seen what was captured on that film. DG, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina 2) Subject: Strange Light in Infrared Camera at Deer Feeder Date: February 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Linda, I watch a deer cam that is in NJ. Here is a link to our club site where I put some pictures. http://www.lakecountyfishandgame.org /Deercampage.html Includes a strange egg-shaped light or object. The cam takes a picture every 5 seconds. There was nothing else there and this object moved in from lower left and went about as far into the frame as pictured. It then left to the upper left. No one has come up with a good answer as to what this is. The owner of the cam said it was a dust ball. I'm not too sure about that.

Please see: http://www.lake countyfishandgame.org/De e rcampage .html 3) Subject: Another Red Orb of Sorts Date: February 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I would like to share my experience of an encounter with a \"red orb\" I had 6 or 7 years ago. It was the 4th of July in Falmouth, Massachusetts. I was sitting on the beach with friends and family. It was dark and we were waiting for the annual fireworks display to begin. From my right, I could see a small purplish-red object approaching very fast. It was just in my peripheral sight about 3 feet off the ground. I turned to view it and as fast as I did, it zoomed in front of me making a small path correction so to not hit the 3 others sitting on my right. Then the object zipped to my left, again correcting for people on the beach and on down the beach to the edge of the water. This object looked to me a little smaller than a Silly Putty container, but about the same shape. It was completely quiet and probably traveling at over 80 mph. It was not a bug and not a stray firework or new toy. I am not crazy because I saw it coming, watched it make conscious course adjustments and continue on to wherever it was going. When the event passed, which might have lasted 1-2 seconds, I joked to my buddy by saying, \"What the hell was that?\" He said he didn't know, but also saw it. No one else in my group saw it and there might have been 15 of us adults and kids. On the 4th of July, there are as many as 40,000 people who come to view the fireworks on this 2 mile section of beach. I am sure someone else could have seen this also. 4) Subject: Light Balls in Sansom Park, Fort Worth, Texas Date: February 23, 2008 9:32:56 AM MST"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com My grandmother told me that she saw light balls in her yard in Fort Worth, Texas. I believe she saw them sometime in the 1970s. Additionally, my cousin - a child of a military officer who was stationed at Roswell around the early 1950s - contracted cancer. I believe she was in her 20s and received compensation from the government because of a determination that she had been exposed to high levels of radiation as a child. They also resided near Carswell Air Force Base in the 1960s. I have often wondered what my uncle knew about the Roswell incidents? [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Carswell Air Force Base (1942 - 1994) is a former United States Air Force Strategic Air Command base located about 5 miles northwest of Fort Worth, Texas. For most of it's operational lifetime, the base's mission was to train and support heavy strategic bombing groups and wings. Today, the base is known as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth and is operated by the United States Navy. The west side of the base still serves as Air Force Plant #4 and employs 17,000 personnel, primarily Lockheed Martin employees. The name Carswell Field is still used for the portion of the base occupied by the Texas Air National Guard's 136th Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve Command's 301st Fighter Wing, Headquarters - 10th Air Force, the 610th Security Forces Squadron, Fleet Logistics Support Wing, Fleet Logistics Support Squadron 59, Marine Aircraft group 14, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 112 and Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 234.] 5) Subject: More UFO Symbols! Date: February 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Dear Earthfiles, Linda, oh my god there are more symbols read this: http://www.ufocasebook.com/etplate.html it's a case from 1967 where they found a copper plate with symbols in Canada!! ..just as those from Brazil 1988 in Earthfiles ... see attachment also... cheers mac, germany [ Editor's Note: Daniela Giordano wrote to ufocasebook.com in 2007 about a 40-year-old case that involved strange symbols imprinted on copper: “In the year 1967, an Italian immigrant (L.R.) was living in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. ...It was a cold Saturday of November 4, 1967, ... and he was looking out of his window. He could see the sky and part of the Saskatchewan river, at that moment iced-up, running alongside the Riverside Municipal Golf Course far from the window - about 1500 meters as the crow flies. ... Suddenly, L.R. spotted a brilliant light in the dark sky. It came from the East headed fast towards the North and moving on, perpendicular to his point of observation. At first, he thought it was an aeroplane, because the airport was not far away, but its path and its behavior attracted his attention. In fact the brilliant dot started to become lower. Then it stopped, starting to emit an intense pulsating light. He noticed now its globular shape. The size was double that of a car’s headlight. The light was now fixed in the dark sky emanating a pulsating reddish light. Suddenly the light went off. And the object was no longer visible. But in the position where the object should have been, a bright blue ring appeared, becoming bigger and bigger while it was directed towards the ground until it disappeared. This phenomena of the rings was repeated 3 times. Then the object re-appeared with its reddish pulsating light."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It remained there for about 10 minutes. It was about 11:45 p.m. when another extremely faint light came away from the main object and rapidly moved towards the ground in an oblique path. The little object was now at about the level of 500 meters. It started to slow down, almost stopping, then started again to slow down, still headed towards the ground. Now L.R. could see it clearly. It was round, terribly squashed at the poles. It was a silver color. It emanated a soft violet light. It rotated slowly on itself and emitted a buzzing sound like an electric transformer. It flew over the Saskatchewan river and landed on the grass of the Riverside Municipal Golf Course - far from his window - about 1.500 meters as the crow flies. There, the light of the object went out. It remained extinguished for about 5 minutes. Then it lit up again and took off towards the main object, still fixed in the same point as before. When the little object reached the main object, it was literally swallowed by the main object. Then, the larger object started to move slowly, then fast, at the same time that light became more brilliant and pulsating, and then it disappeared towards the North. The day after, November 5th, Sunday, L.R. woke up early and looked in the newspaper for some news about the phenomenon. He couldn't find any news, so he decided to look at the location of the landing. He needed about half an hour to find, on the grass, the traces of the landing: a ring of 5 meters of squashed grass. At a distance of about two meters from the ring's edge there were some holes in the ground of about 10 cm. in diameter. He was leaving the spot when a twinkling on the grass attracted his attention. A piece of metal peeped out among the blades of grass. It was a square plate like copper, with strange characters and writing engraved on it. The size of the plate was 17.3 cm. wide by 12.5 cm. high. Thickness: about 1 mm. He took the plate home with him.

After that experience, many interesting things began happening to us. One experience that stands out in my mind was an experience I had with strange symbols that looked very much like the symbols that you are writing about on your website. Here is a written recount I did of the experience: “I was sitting on the edge of my bed, when suddenly a strange and sudden 'projection' of light appeared to me as I closed my eyes. There was a sound like an electrical crackling, and the projected light seemed to blink and appeared like an 'old time"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"movie.' The picture that I saw was a list of 'glyphs' or unknown writing. They appeared in 4 long rows (like lists) and were black on a white screen-like background. They flickered on and off (but never entirely blinking out) and I could hear faint electrical sound—almost like an old movie projector sound. My grandfather used to manage drive-in movie theaters in Cincinnati, Ohio, and sometimes he would take me with him so I could watch movies. I was shown the room that held the giant projector and often watched and heard the large reel turning as it played the film. This is why I can compare what I saw with the movie projector scenario. I could see the picture with my eyes open or closed.” Afterward I wrote some of the symbols down (my notes are packed away in storage), but I do remember distinctly that they were VERY much the same as the symbols you are describing in your reports. Years ago, I thought I was having some spiritual experience, but now many, many years later I do believe that experience and many others were purposely induced for whatever reason. Now I’m really wondering if some part of my consciousness knows and understands those symbols and I’ll understand more about it sometime in the future. Linda, thanks for letting me share this experience, and many thanks for all you do! 7) Subject: Sightings Over Texas Date: February 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Two weeks ago on a Friday morning (Feb. 8, 2008), I was on my way home in the morning (I throw news papers in Dallas, TX) and I saw something odd. I was heading S.E. on Hwy. 175 (15 miles S.E. of Dallas) and I was looking up at Venus and Jupiter (they had been close together). It was a clear sky, no clouds no planes, nothing, but those two planets up there, just before sunrise. All of a sudden I saw a light up there between the two planets. It wasn't there and then it was! I looked at it for a second or two and then the light took off at a high rate of speed, like the things you see if you watch the Star Trek movies or TV show. Up and out and away, it was gone in a second. When I got home, I mentioned it to my husband, and he asked me if it was a falling star? NO, it went up and away between the two planets. I know what I saw was far away, and it was the sun shining on it that made it visible, so I am assuming it was big and it was fast. I have watched the space station and the shuttle go over many times and I have seen many falling stars. This was faster than the space station (and that moves pretty fast). Don't know what it was, but once you are up in the air and can move fast, we are not that far from where those other sightings happened in Stephenville, Texas.
