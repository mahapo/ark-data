The next morning of August 8, 2009, Jaime Maussan from Mexico City and I received news that another new formation had been seen from the air at West Overton near Lockeridge. We headed there and met up with Charles and others, all of us trying to get into the fresh formation before it was trampled by tourists or cut out by the farmer. 450 -foot-long geometry at West Overton near Lockeridge, Wiltshire, England, reported August 8, 2009.

As I stood marveling at the liquid gracefulness of what should have been stiff, mid-August wheat, my eye was attracted toward Lockeridge about a mile north of the formation. “Oh, my God, it's one of those aerial, flickering mirrors!” After a few seconds of stunned staring at the white, flickering light moving along the tops of the wheat in the field between the new formation and Lockeridge church, I grabbed for my video camera. But by the time I was focusing the eyepiece, I couldn't see the white, moving sparkle anymore. Those flickering, aerial “mirrors” were seen and videotaped before and after crop formations in the early 1990s. This was the first one I have seen in daylight with my eyes. Are the flickering mirror lights “intelligent plasmas of unknown origin,” as Italian astronomer Massimo Teodorani, has asked in his 1990s research of the Hessdalen, Norway, mysterious mountain lights?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"O ne of four corner grapeshot circles with fountain dotting the West Overton wheat formation first reported on August 8, 2009.

Re-oriented Growth Nodes - Biophysical and Biochemical Changes E longated and reoriented growth nodes were caused by biophysical and biochemical changes in the wheat plants. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood hypothesizes that a spinning plasma vortex containing microwave and electrical energies comes downward from the atmosphere and rapidly heats and collapses some plants, affecting growth nodes, while leaving other plants standing.
