To date, neithermilitary nor civilian sources have been able to explain what the huge,unidentified triangular craft was.Five of the eyewitnesses were in a car south of Phoenix at 8:30 p.m. TracyRoads was driving from her Tucson with her daughter, Emily, to a stateswimming championship accompanied by her mother and two friends. Theywere all astonished when an enormous triangle appeared in the sky with a lightat each corner moving towards them from the Casa Grande mountains. First,Tracy Roads, and then her 10-year-old daughter, Emily.Interviews:1) Tracy Roads, Mother, Tucson, Arizona: \"When it went over head, I leanedmy head back and I started seeing the nose of the triangle coming up over theback window. It was a blackish, grayish, bluish metal. It was like the blue on agun. I remember thinking that it looked like the Borg on Star Trek. It had like apattern like a circuit board or something. It was like the Borg description I cangive. It's like a solid metal, but you can tell there are different things, lines andways that it's made up even though it's just a big, black object in the sky. Fromthe moment we entered its shadow, we were underneath it for two minutes going80 miles an hour in the opposite direction. If you have a stationary object at 80miles an hour for two minutes, we could travel almost three miles of ground. So,I would estimate this object to be at least two miles from the very front of thetriangle to the back, the straight edge back of the craft.WHEN YOU HAD PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THAT REAR WINDOWAND YOU WERE LOOKING UP RIGHT STRAIGHT INTO THEBOTTOM OF THIS OBJECT, COULD YOU SEE ANY STARS AT ANYEDGES?No. No. It was so big I could not see the edges of. Once it was over me, I couldnot look to either side through the back window and see any stars.IT WAS THAT BIG.It was that big.LIKE IT FILLED UP THE ENTIRE SKY.It blanketed the sky above me. I can't imagine something that big in the sky andI've seen it! And then it just floated.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2) Emily Roads, 10-year-old, sitting behind driver's seat with her head outthe window: \"I just thought I saw something that would go down in history.WHY DID YOU THINK THAT?Because it was a UFO and I had never seen one before in my life. It was so bigand stuff. I just thought it was really special and it was going to go down... (shepauses)IN HISTORY. WELL, DID IT EVER CROSS YOUR MIND AS YOUWERE STARING AT IT AND YOU WERE HANGING OUT THEWINDOW OF THE CAR -- DID YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS INTHAT TRIANGLE?Better than ours.MEANING?Smarter than us, having abilities far beyond us.\"Tracy Roads, Mother: \"Actually the first feeling I got was I was scared. Ithought Independence Day. That was my first thought this big thing is coming atus and I had a feeling of turning around. My husband was back in Tucson and Ithought, Should we turn around? And then I thought, Well, if this thing isheaded to Tucson to do destruction, it's (destruction) probably (already) inPhoenix. We're all going to be affected, this will be it. And then I got excited. Itwas something I will never forget for the rest of my life.\"WHAT STACY AND EMILY ROADS DID NOT REALIZE WAS THATOTHERS WERE SEEING A HUGE TRIANGLE AT ABOUT THE SAMETIME. REALTORS MAX AND SHALA SARACENS HAD JUST ARRIVEDAT THEIR HILL TOP HOME IN PHOENIX AROUND 8:30 PM WHEN THEYALSO SAW A HUGE TRIANGULAR CRAFT IN THE SKY.WAS IT THE SAME TRIANGLE THAT TRACY AND EMILY DESCRIBED?HAD IT FLOWN FIRST OVER THE SARACENS AND THEN SOUTHTOWARD TUCSON, CROSSING OVER THE CAR? OR WERE THERETWO, HUGE TRIANGULAR CRAFT IN THE SKY OVER PHOENIX ONMARCH 13TH, 1997?WE MIGHT NEVER KNOW THE ANSWER, BUT ALL SEVENEYEWITNESSES ESTIMATED AN EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH FOR ANYAERIAL VEHICLE -- TWO MILES LONG.3) Max Saracens, Realtor, Phoenix, Arizona: \"In the northwestern sky wasthis huge formation of V-shaped lights, like a string of lights in the sky, flyinglower than the airplanes flying above it. And we were standing directly in itsflight path as it was heading from the northwest valley to the southeast valley,down towards Tempe. And the most striking thing about these lights as it gotcloser and flew over our heads was that it tended to block out the stars. So,what you could make out was a HUGE triangular structure -- some kind ofstructure of a definite triangular shape and it had kind of running lights on theside of it. And the lights did not kind of illuminate the rest of the structure. Thelights were very coherent. There wasn't like a flare or glow around the lights.WHAT COLOR?They were kind of white and yellowy color. And it looked like this structure wasvery secretive. That was the impression I got from it first of all, because it wascompletely silent and from end to end -- the back of the ship -- it clearly waseasily over a mile long, if not two miles. That was the most striking thing wesaw.AND ABOUT HOW LOW?About a thousand feet. It wasn't very high at all."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU STOOD THERELOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO BE BETWEEN AMILE AND TWO MILES IN LENGTH IN THE SKY AT ONLY ATHOUSAND FEET AND COMPLETELY SILENT?Just awestruck. We didn't feel fear. There wasn't any fear. It was just anawe-inspiring, marvelous thing to see.\"4) Shala Saracen, Realtor, Phoenix, Arizona: \"And here it was ever so slowlygoing over the top of us, ever so slowly! And I mean you could see the whole,not the whole structure because it was so massive -- and the reason I kind ofknow how wide it was and why I'm so specific on it is that we work for a custombuilder. And we lay out master plans and things like that. And there was a newmaster plan being laid out there and I know how many blocks there are towhatever and it was 28 blocks wide because I went back and counted.TWENTY-EIGHT BLOCKS WOULD BE HOW FAR?About a mile and 7/8ths.PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT TWO MILES LONG, PEOPLE WHOHAVE SEEN THIS TRIANGLE.OK, well, that's what it was. When it was over us, it was so humongous Icouldn't tell in the back if it was boomerang or triangle because it just went sofar back. Then as I said, it hovered over us for a few minutes. I'd say about 5minutes. Not hovering, but going at such a slow speed that it felt as if it washovering.\"Max Saracen: \"It was very other worldly -- that was my very first impression.Extremely other worldly. My wife has better eyesight than I do for longdistance. Her eyesight is incredible, and she could see windows.\"Shala Saracen: \"See I was looking at the lights when the lights went out and hewasn't. He was trying to look like under the structure to see what -- if it was a Vor was a triangle or whatever it was. So, I was watching as the lights went out.And they went out for only a few seconds, but when they went out -- whateverthis was must have been illuminated from inside because you could seewindows. I saw windows and I saw shapes. I saw shadows.WHAT SHAPE WERE THEY?Squares. They were square windows and that surprised me. I would havethought all one solid, not broken up. It was like panes.AND WHAT KIND OF SHADOWS WERE YOU SEEING IN THOSESQUARE WINDOWS?Shadows. Gray shadows. You could see -- I told him four. I counted four. Andthe lights went on again and then that blinded me again so I couldn't see anymore.FOUR SHADOWS. WHAT SHAPE?Well, like grey shapes like what I've seen on TV and that shocked me.YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU ACTUALLY SAW HUMANOID SHAPESBEHIND THESE SQUARES?Yes, definitely! And I told him four.WAS THERE ONE PER WINDOW, OR WERE THEY MOVING?No, it looked like the four were together. Standing together. That's what itlooked like -- the four shapes were together. They weren't spread across.AND IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE STANDING AND LOOKING OUT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE WINDOW?Yes, that's what it felt like, too.WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE ABOUT WHAT COULD THISPOSSIBLY BE?Well, I watch X-FILES, you know, because it's the most well written show onTV. So I had a good idea of what I thought it could be.WHICH IS?A UFO. An extraterrestrial ship. It's a ship that doesn't come from our planet.\"More Information:I would appreciate information from anyone in military, intelligence or civilianwork who might have more information about these triangular craft estimated tobe about two miles in length.
