Investigator Jean Bilodeaux collected tissue, grass and soil samples, including unusual hardened dark particles from bull's testicles and chest near excision that proved to be pure hemoglobin.

Both domestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses and cattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals are found with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed usually without blood from the head, sexual organs, and rectum. There are no signs of struggle or tracks around the dead animals, not even the animal's own tracks. That peculiar fact provoked law enforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures using aerial craft. Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cut with lasers because of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathology exams over the years have confirmed in some mutilations that cuts were made with heat energy. (See: An Alien Harvest in Earthfiles Shop. ) Biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Grass Lake, Michigan thinks a very complex set of energies are involved. He began studying soil and grass samples from mutilation sites to compare with soil and grass from crop formations. In both phenomena, he has found the same pattern of respiration changes in plant cell mitochondria, including grass collected near the rectal area of the California bull discussed in this report. He has experimented with microwaves to reproduce some of the biochemical and biophysical effects he has found. U pper graph indicates respiratory stress in the grass sampled near rectal area of mutilated California bull discussed in this report. Bottom graph shows normal respiration of mitochondria in grass sampled one hundred feet north of the dead animal. Redox text and graphs by W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist. Now, a startling new discovery has been reported from research on a mutilated bull. The case began on January 17, 1997, when ranchers Jean and Bill Barton were checking their cattle from horseback at their winter ranch near Red Bluff, California. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Their 2,000 pound Black Angus bull was dead and mutilated. The young bull had been seen alive and well ten days earlier. He was in a hillside pasture about one-half mile from the only dirt road into the area. The field is remote, strewn with volcanic rocks, and can only be reached on foot or horseback. Field investigator Jean Bilodeaux collected tissue, grass and soil samples. Her field notes stated: “Bull was lying on its right side, positioned along a north/south axis, with his head pointing north. His right foreleg was drawn way up, almost under his chest; his right hind leg was up underneath his body, and he was lying on his tail which was curved upward with the end of the tail protruding out over is rump. His back towards the rear end seemed curved under his body in a very unnatural position as if he might have been dropped from a height. The right shoulder appeared crushed by the rock underneath the animal and the grass around him was standing undisturbed with no stems broken. There were no obvious signs of a struggle as his front legs were lying against some small rocks which had not been dislodged.” Bull Excisions The hide on the left side of the bull's nose and mouth as well as the left eye had been excised in smooth and precise cuts. The right eye that remained was very inflamed, much redder than pink eye, and the iris and pupil were rolled inward toward the nose. The tongue was gone. A large, round section of hide had been removed behind the left front leg. The excision stretched from the chest to the left knee. Yet, that large wound showed no signs of blood or fluid drainage to the ground. The rectum was cored out and a watery, reddish liquid could be seen in the rectal cavity. E xcisions of bull's left eye, nose and mouth hide, and large circular section beneath left foreleg. White marks on body are bird droppings and feathers.
