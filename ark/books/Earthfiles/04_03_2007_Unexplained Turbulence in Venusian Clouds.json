April 3 , 2007 Paris, France - New images and data from the European Space Agency’s mission to Venus provide more details about the turbulent and noxious atmosphere of Earth’s sister planet. What causes violent winds and turbulences? Is the surface topography playing a role in the complex global dynamics of the atmosphere? The images, showing a complex cloud system, were taken on the night-side of Venus at a wavelength of 1.7 micron that allows viewing the deep atmospheric layers.

The image, taken on the night-side of Venus at a wavelength of 1.7 micron, provides a close-up view of a highly turbulent region, with irregular and warped clouds, which is common at these low latitudes. This is different from what happens at higher latitudes (pole-ward) where clouds are generally streaky and more regularly shaped. The grey-scale of the image is such that black means more transparency, therefore less clouds, while white means more opacity, therefore more cloud concentration. \"The gray ‘bubble’ slightly below the centre of the image is located at about 27 degrees southern latitude and 7 degrees western longitude, and has a diameter of about 186 miles (300 kilometers). \"The Alpha Regio area is at the bottom left of the image.
