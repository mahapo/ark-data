Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Winchester, Hampshire Circular Code Analysis - UPDATED © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Winchester was original capital of England, an ancient city going back two millennia. Cheesefoot Head is a couple of miles east of Winchester where crop formations started back in the 1970s. The 2002 face and code formation is a couple miles to the west of Winchester. Another 5 or 6 miles further west is the Chilbolton Radio Observatory. Face and code wheat formation 250 feet wide by 360 feet long at Vale Farm next to Crabwood forest in the village of Pitt near Winchester, Hampshire, U.K., first reported at 9 a.m. on August 16, 2002, one year after the August 14, 2001 face and code appeared at the Chilbolton Radio Observatory.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Update on August 19, 2002 - The following is the Sunday, August 18, 2002 E-mail I received from Earthfiles viewer who described himself as: \" A large part of my full time job is decoding ciphers and reverse enginereering communication protocols.\" His original text below is updated with additional notes about the bell ringing sound. (He requested anonymity and later gave his name as Richard Brain.) \"Hello I have noticed your news article on the Crabwood corn circle. Please find below the results of my initial work in decoding the Crabwood Farm crop circle, and the message which it seems to contain! SUGGESTIONS. Suggestion 1. The circle partially overlaying the Alien visage, Appears to contains digital information comprising of ones and zeros. (Either Flattened or erect corn). Suggestion 2. The information is represented in 8 bit data segments of identical length, all bit positions being equally marked. There is a narrow separator or synchronisation bit (ridge) between the 8bit data fields. Suggestion 3. It is highly probable that ASCII 8 bit encoding is used as the most common character used was SPACE that is represented by hex x20, this was used to separate the blocks of data segments. (Hex is a convenient digital way of representing the binary information contained in the message). The circle seems to be of simple 8 bits binary encoding, with characters represented by the ASCII character set. The language used is international English. The Circle is read from the inside out or counter clockwise. Suggestion 4. Between each curved line of data, there is an empty separator line. MESSAGE DECODING. The pictures used to decode the text were taken from crop circle connector, http://www.cropcircleconnector.com /2002/Crabwood/crabwood2002a.html. The pictures required orthogonal correction to ensure that as a near as perfect circle was presented. This is so that a view directly above of the circle was used when decoding the contents. Simple contrast enhancement was performed. The message was decoded by using a marked"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"bit of paper in the following manner |blank|1|2|4|8|1|2|4|8|. The LSB (Least Significant Bit) is on the left; the MSB (Most Significant bit) is on the right. The paper was curled along the empty separator line, when reading the text. The blank part was placed ion the synchronisation bits. MESSAGE CONTENTS (some missing) This is the deciphering of the message: - \"Beware the bearers of FALSE gifts & their BROKEN PROMISES.Much PAIN but still time. (Damaged Word). There is GOOD out there.We OPpose DECEPTION. Conduit CLOSING (BELL SOUND) Later Information: The ASCII character set is the simplest of text formats dating back to 1963, at that time the common input/output device was the teletype. At the end of receiving any message a bell sound would ring to alert the operator that a message had been received. From memory the teletype in the film \"The Andromeda Strain\" had a jammed bell, therefore nobody was aware they had received messages. The bell sound was ASCII character 0x07. (hexidecimal) The message consists of 26 Words, interestingly the English alphabet has 26 letters.

So, no damaged word, but the name of that place. Maybe a star name? Maybe the name of their planet?\" More Information: "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Prior Similar Text in August 1991 Crop Formation In August 1991 in the Milk Hill field near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England, an inscription was placed in the wheat field which British author John Michell reported about in The Cereologist No. 9, Page 3, Summer 1993, based on two years of work by a committee of nine people, including a cryptoanalyst. The only solution that could be found were two ancient Latin words, Oppono Astos . One translation is, \"I oppose acts of craft and cunning.\" The Latin description of what the Greeks did with the Trojan Horse used the word astos to describe the gift of the Trojan Horse which was used to get an attacking army into the city of Tro y.
