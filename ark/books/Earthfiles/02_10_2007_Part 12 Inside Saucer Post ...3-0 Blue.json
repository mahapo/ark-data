Stringfield. SAUCER SANCTA - 801 AND 4E4 Summarizing everything from angel hair to zodiacal lights, I have come to the conclusion that flying saucers are interplanetary vehicles and that the world governments with technological know-how also believe this to be the answer. This answer, however, for one or several reasons is being kept from the world public. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In 1955, the London Sunday Dispatch reported: \"The Air Ministry stated that the results of their five year investigation of UFOs is not to be made public. It is to be locked away and may not ever be released, for the Air Ministry is afraid it will encounter or promote much skepticism.\" During the same year, the Ministry of Defense (MOD) in South Africa announced that all information about UFOs seen in that country was labeled: \"TOP SECRET, not to be divulged.\" Equally secret, but less blunt about it, was a letter received from Capt. White of OPI, USAF, Defense Department, dated May 20, 1955: \"I know of no plans to release information on individual sightings and doubt that such will take place since we still have the same shortage of investigative personnel.\" Also, in May 1955, INS reported Dorothy Kilgallen's famous dispatch from London which quoted a British official of cabinet rank as saying: \"We believe, on the basis of our inquiries thus far, that the saucers were staffed by small men, probably under four fee tall. It's frightening, but there is no denying the flying saucers come from another planet.\" [ Editor's Note: On May 22, 1955, Dorothy Kilgallen, reporting for International News Service (INS), wrote: \"British scientists and airmen, after examining the wreckage of one mysterious flying ship, are convinced these strange aerial objects are not optical illusions or Soviet inventions, but are flying saucers which originate on another planet. \"The source of my information is a British official of Cabinet rank who prefers to remain unidentified. 'We believe, on the basis of our inquiry thus far, that the saucers were staffed by small men - probably under four feet tall. It's frightening, but there is no denying the flying saucers come from another planet.' \"The official quoted scientists as saying a flying ship of this type could not possibly have been constructed on earth. The British Government, I learned, is withholding an official report on the 'flying saucer' examination at this time, possibly because it does not wish to frighten the public.\"] After long silence, the British Air Ministry said in a June 15, 1957, statement that admitted a serious concern over UFO reports. According to London's Reynolds News, \"On the ninth floor of what was formerly the Hotel Metropole, there is a TOP SECRET room - Number 801 to be exact - where all reports of flying saucers are collected and studied by experts.\" Summarizing the Air Ministry's revelations, Reynolds News stated: \"(1) The Air Ministry - who have always supposed to have treated UFOs with skeptical derision - have in fact been investigating saucer reports since as far back as 1947. (2) In these ten years, the UFO files have grown immensely. 'We have something like 10,000 on our files,' the Ministry spokesman said. (3) Though many of these 10,000 sightings have been 'cleared up,' official sources admit that there were some which could not be explained. 'Nobody in the know,' the spokesman admitted, 'is prepared to say that all reports about these mystery objects are nonsense.' (4) At airfields all over Britain, fighter planes are kept ready to intercept, and if necessary, to engage any UFO within the combat range. (5) The interior of Room 801 is never seen by unauthorized persons. A large map of the British Isles hangs on one wall; and on it, dotted all over the country are literally thousands of coloured pins. These obviously represent sightings reported to the Air Ministry. (6) The heaviest concentration of these coloured pins appears to be over the Norwich area.\" [ Editor's Note: The Romans had their regional capital at Venta Icenorum on the river five miles south of Norwich in East Anglia, eastern England. Venta Icenorum, located at modern-day Caistor St Edmund in the English county of Norfolk, East Anglia, was the capital of the powerful and independent Iceni tribe, who inhabited the flatlands and marshes of that county and earned immortality for their revolt against Roman rule under their Queen Boudica (or Boadicea) in the winter of 61 CE.] Realizing that an iron door of security stood between me and the final answer, I nonetheless took advantage of an opportunity on August 13, 1957, to visit ATIC at Wright-"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Patterson AFB, hoping to ascertain as much about their 4E4 as Reynolds News told us about the British Room 801. I asked to see Capt. Gregory, but he being off the base, I went through a series of phone calls from the registration desk trying to locate someone else willing to talk sense about saucers. I was first connected with a Dr. Miley, \"who was in charge of 4E4.\" But when he refused to be interviewed, for obvious reasons, I was directed to Mr. Spencer Whedon, the head of the ATIC Information Services Office. My appointment was set for 3 o'clock. Arriving early, and while waiting for Whedon's arrival from the briefing room, his secretary was also bound by security regulations to keep a watchful eye. That included to follow me to the drinking fountain. Thinking this amusing, but probably necessary where so many secrets are kept, I was again followed as I returned to my chair. No sooner that I had seated myself, then Whedon - with an assistant - stormed into the office. Both looked as though they were rushing to battle stations. Whedon, a robust man with a voice that boomed, was quick to get the bull by the horns. While making introductions and asking what I wanted, his assistant, saying nothing, pulled a chair close to me and swung one leg over the other. Feeling almost beleaguered, I got directly to the point. I said, \"I understand from certain sources that the Air Force is coming out soon with a new and different statement on the UFO.\" \"Don't know of any,\" said Whedon, pressing tobacco into his pipe. \"Unless it's a slight modification of its present text - but nothing big or different that I know of.\" This was the starter. Before many minutes had elapsed, in which we had covered several debatable subjects, I could feel that Whedon was getting the upper hand. His voice, was forever commanding and his replies forever rambling into valuable time. In the middle of one of his standard Air Force replies, I decided to cut in. I asked why the Air Force persisted in stating that saucers do not exist. Appearing nettled, Whedon relit his pipe, found a new balance in his chair and boomed, \"All but 3% can be explained - and we'd explain those if we had more data.\" Half-smiling, he then recalled some personal experiences in which he himself had been fooled by the optic of light. \"Just recently,\" he said, \"while driving my car in Dayton, I came to a familiar intersection and was surprised to see two red traffic lights.\" Pausing momentarily, drawing heavily on his pipe, he went on: \"I thought this was odd, but as my car got nearer - GUESS WHAT?\" In the next instant, Whedon was laughing so gustily that he even failed to notice that his pipe had burned out. Knowing the answer was going to be funny, I edged closer. Even the wry face of his assistant creased into a traceable smile. Finally Whedon, reeling back into his chair and still smiling, said, \"There was only one light.\" He then explained that anyone can be fooled by lights and so can people who see saucers! He also cited an instance when \"practically everybody on the base here\" was alerted to take a look at a UFO. Carefully pointing out that each and every observer was \"trained\" to observe objects in the sky, Whedon said, \"Jets were sent up and ...\" But before he could finish, I had cut in with another question, figuring that I already knew his answer. I had heard it at least twice before, once from Captain Gregory and once from Sgt. Hill. Each story had a slightly different version, but it had the same ending. In the earlier examples the UFOs were searchlight beams playing on some lofty cloud. Or, maybe Whedon's was, too, if I had let him finish his story. But Whedon was not pleased with my impertinence and galumphed back in his chair. He reminded me that I had \"interrupted\" him six times. When I apologized, the subject once again was restored to the \"unexplained 3%.\" Whedon, looking victorious, went on to say that these represented mostly untrained sighters like science-fiction addicts, children, publicity seekers and hoaxsters. I started to name several sightings by astronomers, pilots and others quite unlike his references, but felt that it was hopeless. Continually pressing the tobacco in his pipe, Whedon then admitted that the Air Force has never ruled out the interplanetary theory. But he knew of no evidence which would support it - unless, he said, \"They aren't telling me everything.\" Thinking this perhaps was the case, I next hit on the subject of secrecy. \"We're not hiding a thing,\" he countered. Everybody seems to think we are, but there's nothing to hide.\" I then asked if I could see the military reports, especially those by pilots. \"We can't show these,\" he said, \"because we don't have the personnel to handle all the requests to see the reports.\" He added, \"Besides, it is not our policy to supply material for commercial purposes.\" Relighting his pipe, Whedon continued, \"Air Force pilots are free to say whatever they please about UFOs. They are not muzzled and I can show you this in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"black and white.\" Time having run out, I thanked Whedon and his assistant for the interview and departed. Walking to the gate, I smiled in Pyrrhic victory. When I got home that night, I thought about Whedon's statement about the muzzling of pilots. Sitting down to my typewriter, I wrote him the following letter from which I quote in part: \"...In one of our topical avenues, which concerned the 'muzzling of pilots,' you stated that such charges are not so and that you could prove this in writing. Although I did not request this proof at the time, I would now like to see whatever reference or directive you had in mind.\" The terse and somewhat hazy reply to my letter was signed by Capt. Wallace Elwood and is quoted for your interpretation: \"In answer to your letter of 14 August 1957, Mr. Whedon believes that you may refer to his statement that the Air Force regulation which alone governs the actions of Air Force personnel with respect to UFOs clearly does not muzzle pilots.\" THE \"MONSTER\" UNDER THE LID On July 23, 1952, six Air Force jets pursued a \"flying saucer\" over southwestern Ohio. Hundreds of reports were received from Columbus, Springfield, Vandalia and Cedarville. According to a firsthand report from a Cincinnati attorney, W. D. Bollinger, jets \"zoomed around the saucer which had the appearance of a big orange ball of fire with a tail.\" Another report told of sixteen Air Force officers in a plane returning to Wright-Patterson AFB from Washington, D. C., who also witnessed the UFO. One passenger, Col. E. J. Morrison, PIO of the Air Materiel Command, described the object a a \"large bright nail.\" He added, \"The sky was cloudless and we had a perfect view of it. The 'nail' to me looked as if it was suspended and was stationary.\" After the intercepting jets landed, a spokesman at Wright-Patterson AFB said, \"This is a good one.\" He added, \"We have plenty of information,\" but he declined to reveal details until reports were cleared through intelligence channels. But this report, like thousands of others, has never been cleared. Five years has since past, but according to Whedon, \"the Air Force is not hiding a thing.\" \"Go tell it to the Marines\" would seem to be an apt rebuttal, but alas, the bromide won't work. The hitch is that Marine pilots who intercept a UFO are treated no differently than any other military pilot. Their lips sealed by JANAP 146, reminds them if they should talk out of turn about their incident, they might be sentenced to prison for one to ten years and fined up to 10,000 dollars. Air Force saucer files, therefore, in spite of the testimony of Whedon & Co., are under the lock and key of \"maximum security.\" Stories like Whedon's \"two red traffic lights\" suggest ruses and are designed to degrade the subject, dissipate rational debate and hopefully dispel the debater. All is fair in war and in saucers is apparently what the Air Force thinks. Their attitude is that they know best why the lid of the Pandora's box must not open ... for to tell a little will lead to telling all, so the safest policy is to tell nothing! Why? What great monster lies cramped and writhing under the lid of the Pandora's box? Is it a horrendous grand hoax - which is to say that every \"respectful\" saucer sighter since the foo-fighter has invented his report just to smokescreen some super-secret military weapon? Or is the real story of the interplanetary saucer just too fantastic for the conventional human mind to grasp - not to mention its impact on world economics and man's philosophies? In this category, would fit the Adamski revelations, for the spaceman in his creation is much like the human being, not at all frightful in appearance. But this spaceman is fantastic nonetheless, for he also is telepathic and knows all and sees all. Or is the monster under the lid truly a monster? Is the saucer a thing of violence or potential violence? Is there a pattern to the thousands of hidden reports which might tie to some fearful or inscrutable master plan? If this is the answer, then the policy of secrecy and \"maximum security\" is understandable. But leeching into the sinews of this theoretical monster are its theoretical inconsistencies. For instance, negating the supposition of violence from outer space is the bare truth that saucers have not destroyed the world or harmed its masses. And surely a space race with enough intelligence to build an interplanetary vehicle could also build a super weapon capable of planeticide. On the other hand, to accept this negative evidence, purely on face value or because it fits into the human scheme of behavior might be as rash or as foolhardy as accepting too quickly the positive evidence. Positive evidence is by far the more controversial. By simple definition, if it is a physical act of violence allegedly caused by a UFO, should the public"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"interpret this to mean that saucers are hostile, without taking time to weigh all the evidence before panic ensues? But whatever its interpretation, acts of UFO violence cannot be erased from the records any more than can the evidence which tells us that saucers themselves exist. To this writer, however, they not only stand out \"like a sore thumb\" in the saucer mystery, but also might provide the key to the official lock of secrecy. Whether or not saucers are hostile is highly debatable and for this reason, I list examples of \"menace-like\" cases for review: (1) Crater in Logan, Utah, caused by fiery object, May 1, 1954. Investigating scientists believed the crater was not caused by \"a conventional meteorite.\" (2) A barn in Sweden collapsed mysteriously during deluge of green fireballs, 1946. Workshop destroyed by flaming object in Adelaide, Australia, June 1955. (3) Maritime mysteries with a suspect UFO flavor - the Joyita incident, a vessel left wallowing in a light sea, near Fiji, its crew and passengers missing, a section topside burned out in form of a semi-circle. And the puzzle of the Arakarimoa , missing while strange sea objects were in vicinity, March 1956. (4) Severe burns on hand of William Cunningham of Darby Township, Pennsylvania, caused by flaming missile which entered his window on January 23, 1955. Metal fragments analyzed, unexplained. (5) The blackbird panic caused by UFO, February 17, 1956. (6) UFO interference causing aircraft crash in Jacksonville, Florida, December 21, 1955. (7) UFO causing damage to aircraft while in flight, Pixley, California, July 22, 1956. (8) Near collision with UFO, Long Beach, California, April 15, 1954. Passengers injured. (9) Radar shows jet interceptor being \"swallowed\" by UFO, November 23, 1953. Case known as the Kinross, Michigan, Affair - see Major Keyhoe's The Flying Saucer Conspiracy © 1955 for details. Another report, which describes a bell-shaped UFO \"swallowing\" an Air Force bomber on March 9, 1955, was sent to me by Eugene Metcalfe of Paris, Illinois. I have been unable to obtain authentic verification of a bomber missing on that date, however. Metcalfe swears he saw it happen. Also of interest, an Air Force official admitted to me that this case had been investigated by ATIC. Of greatest concern are the acts of UFO violence befalling both commercial and military aircraft. Unlike the ground incidents where a meteor falling from the sky might account for some of the \"guided missiles\" from the \"menacing Martians,\" the chances of a meteor hitting or interfering with an aircraft in flight would be several million to one. To buttress the pros and cons of this argument, there are no statistics, nor are there statistics released by the Air Force or the C.A.A. from which the public could determine to what extent the world has been drawn into its silent \"conflict\" with the unknown. Robert C. Gardner, lecturer and private UFO investigator of the state of California, during a visit to my home in 1955 gave me this statement for publication in Orbit: \"In the latter part of February 1953, I carried a letter of introduction and recommendation from a New York official in charge of all our continental air defenses at Ent Air Force Base in Colorado. The letter concerned a plan I had which the Eastern Air Defense considered important to our national defense. Out of courtesy to General Chidlaw, who has since retired, I have withheld until now the vitally important information herewith revealed. In the course of the half hour private interview, the General mentioned - among many other interesting items - the following: 'We have stacks of reports about flying saucers. We take them seriously when you consider we have lost many men and planes trying to intercept them.'\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"D ecember 30, 1954, Time Magazine, USAF General Benjamin W. Chidlaw, ADC Commander, 1952. Later word supporting Gardner's statement came from a Cincinnatian who, with rank in the Air Force Reserve, had access to certain bits of off-the-record information. It was during the Cincinnati flap of 1955 that he related to a GOC supervisor, who in turn told me, that the Air Force was losing almost a plane a day. Still another Air Force officer in a better position to secure facts on-the-record told me in a private chat also during the 1955 UFO flap, \"What bothers me is what's happening to our aircraft!\" Nothing more was said, nor did I ask for more. Major Keyhoe describes several mysterious UFO interferences with aircraft in his writings. While I have listed others in CRIFO publications, many of which admittedly were borderline cases bearing only suspect evidence, I am more pointedly reminded of my own experience while flying to Iwo Jima in 1945. Had my plane plunged into the sea, no one - including the U. S. Air Force - would have been the wiser as to its cause. Such as it turned out, the incident must remain among the speculative cases. As inconclusive as my case might be, I am in possession of other more positive information, revealed to me from a reliable military source, which tells of a disaster occurring in the air near a certain U. S. military installation outside the continental United States. According to my informant, a jet aircraft while on a routine mission, was vectored in by base operations to intercept two UFOs. Approaching these interlopers, the plane appeared to suddenly develop trouble and was seen to plunge into the shallows of water below. Both occupants of the jet aircraft met an unexplained death, not from drowning. Closing this case, the adjutant of the base notified the next of kin that each flyer had met death during a routine mission. Once again I am reminded of Ruppelt's statement of 1952, \"If they turn out to be hostile vehicles, we will keep after them.\" And as Whedon confirmed to me in August 1957, \"Yes, we send up our jets to intercept. We won't deny that.\" THE PROBLEM OF PANIC If the truth is bad, and there is a monster under the lid, then perhaps the decision by world governments to keep the facts muzzled, at all costs, is the right course. But whatever surprise lies under the lid, the Air Force psycho-medicos might be live that any \"surprise\" might become a monster of panic and present a greater problem than the \"monster\" of real facts. One historic precedent is the Orson Welles radio dramatization of H. G. Well's Wa r o f the Worlds in 1938. Lending weight to this supposition is an off-the-cuff remark made by an Air Force official to me in 1956. Asking him point blank what would happen if all the official UFO reports were suddenly heaped onto the public, he replied, \"There would be a panic.\" According to one argument, the American frame of mind in 1938 was a lot softer than the American mind today, who is toughened by two wars plus being alerted to the threat of the H-Bomb and the ICBM to deliver it. Gerald Heard, who wrote Is Another World Watching? commented on the theory of panic."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"He tells us that in 1932, when the asteroid Apollo was hurtling through space within 20 minutes of ramming the EArth with inconceivable results, that his mentioning that fact on the radio in London, \"showed nothing but the faintest curiosity\" on the part of his listeners. But the Apollo story did not make the headlines as did the \"blips\" that appeared on radar over Washington, D. C., in July of 1952 - and which brought General John Samford of Air Force Intelligence to the American radios to placate a rising hysteria. And Apollo was not as luridly visible as the saucer that coursed over Indianapolis in July of the same year that brought near panic to its people. [ Editor's Note: See 12/29/04 Earthfiles - Half a century ago in 1952, fifteen hundred and one UFO sightings were reported to the U. S. Air Force's Project Blue Book (Page 108 of Blue Book Report). The most well known events were \"flying discs\" over Washington, D. C., on July 19 and July 26, 1952, that were monitored on radar. J uly 19 and 26, 1952 - UFOs Over Washington, D. C. M onday, July 28, 1952, The Washington Post , Washington, D. C. Around midnight on July 19, 1952, radar operators at Washington National Airport noted several 'blips' on the radar over Washington D.C. The unidentified blips traveled at 100 to 130 mph, but then would accelerate suddenly to speeds in excess of 7,200 mph. Washington National Airport and other radar operators confirmed the radar activity with each other and with Andrews Air Force Base. A week later on Saturday, July 26, 1952, \"glowing aerial objects\" showed up again on radar over the Nation's capital and The Wa sh i n g t o n P o st even ran a story about one jet pilot's encounter with a \"saucer that outran\" him.] And despite all the Swords of Damocles in our present era, which should make Americans tough, there will continue to be incidents like that which befell Knoxville, Tennessee, on January 25, 1957. It was a \"night like all nights\" when suddenly a \"ball of fire\" was seen over Sharp's Ridge and the city's lights went out. A rising tide of alarm, according to the Knoxville Journal, brought a flood of calls to the switchboards at police headquarters and newspapers. \"I saw a ball of fire on Sharp's Ridge\" was the report most often heard. Among the rumors received by the police was that there had been a nuclear explosion at Oak Ridge, that the United States was being bombed, and according to the Journal, a fear that the earth had been invaded by Martians. What really happened, said the Journal, \"was that a large power pole fell across high voltage lines, shorting out a transformer at the Arlington substation.\" As my book goes to press (October 1957), two timely news items lending credence to the postulate of panic, appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer. One was datelined Associated Press, Moscow, and the other United Press, Hartford, Connecticut, September 15, 1957. According to the AP item, the Black Sea city of Tuapse fled to the countryside in hysteria over a science-fiction thriller appearing in their newspaper, which told of Soviet astronomers discovering a huge, fiery mass rushing towards earth to destroy it. The story, said the newspaper Soviet Russia, was so fantastically terrifying that many natives of Tuapse became convinced the earth would be destroyed in a few days. The story, written by an author named Kris, had Soviet scientists find that the heavenly mass was a sort of \"atomic reactor\" invented by capitalists to destroy Russia. According to the UP item, a National Civil Defense Week program on TV was so realistic that thousands of people in Hartford feared war had started. To mark the kickoff of the national observance, the Hartford Station, announced its special program, \"What could"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"happen in Connecticut in the event of enemy attack.\" Then after the show began, an announcer read a \"bulletin\": \"We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from Colorado Springs. The Air Defense Command has announced that a large mass of unidentified planes is approaching the North American continent over the North Pole. These planes are presumed hostile.\" What followed the reading of this bulletin, said UP, was a small-scale repetition of the scare stirred in 1938 by Orson Welles. On the subject of panic, I am unable to express an opinion. But as long as I am aware of reports like the preceding and the following are happening, I am sure there is a place for many \"Saucer Posts\" like \"...3-0 Blue.\" March 1955, information received from radio operator in AF Tactical Air Command who participated in the alert and later saw the written summary report: \"Every U. S. military base sweeping out from the Arctic from Korea to Thule in Greenland was alerted. Near Adak, Alaska, radar picked up a lone UFO tracking it as it shot south through Canada t the speed of 9,000 mph. Interceptors sent up from Japan lost the object, but thanks to our advanced warning system, more interceptors were scrambled near Kelly AFB in San Antonio, Texas. As the UFO continued South, where the jets were waiting, it suddenly reversed its course and shot northward again leaving the jets in pursuit far behind. From Thule, and as far south as Langley AFB in Virginia, jets were also scrambled to intercept several UFOs heading south along the eastern coast of Canada. In this phase of the alert, F-94s equipped with radar \"locked on\" the objects. Again illusive, they disappeared straight up.\" E nd of book.
