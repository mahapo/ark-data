May 9, 2009 Wiltshire, England - The person who introduced me to the history of sigils and what they are was Mario Pazzaglini, Ph.D., a psychologist in Wilmington, Delaware, who studied the ancient science of alchemy and secret codes of sigils. A decade before his death, he assembled a limited edition booklet entitled Symbolic Messages: An Introduction to a Study of “Alien” Writing © 1991. Dr. Pazzaglini gave me a copy and in this Earthfiles report, I am reprinting pages 21 - 23 about sigils.

Sigils are codes created for a specific magical purpose. The pattern is the code derived from a number and/or letter grid known only to those who produce sigils from the known grid. A sigil is usually made up of a complex combination of several specific symbols or geometric figures each with a specific meaning or intent. The term sigil derives from the Latin sigillum meaning “seal,” though it may also be related to the Hebrew segulah meaning “word, action or item of spiritual effect.” There is sigil magic in which symbols and signs are used as tools of magicians and alchemists. In medieval ceremonial magic, sigils represented various angels and demons that the magician can summon. The magical training books called the Grimoires often listed pages of angel and demon sigils. A particularly well-known list is in the Lesser Key of Solomon, in which the sigils of the 72 princes of the hierarchy of hell are given for the magician's use, including the demon Aim. Such sigils were considered to be the equivalent of the true name of the spirit, and thus granted the magician a measure of control over the entities being called."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"S igil for the demon, Aim (aka Aym or Haborym), who is a Great Duke of Hell ruling over twenty-six legions of demons and using fire to destroy.

Sigils in the Hebrew Sefer Raziel HaMalakh"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"E xcerpt from Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, featuring various magical sigils. Sefer Raziel HaMalakh, is a Hebrew revelation from the Archangel Raziel dating back to at least the 13th Century and entitled, “Book of Raziel, the Angel.” The tradition around the book says its angelic content was revealed to Adam by the archangel Raziel. The sigils are included in the Kabbalistic grimoire, primarily written in Hebrew and Aramaic, but surviving also in Latin translation, as Liber Razielis Archangeli, in a 13th century manuscript produced under Alfonso X. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The book cannot be shown to predate the 13th Century, but may in parts date back much older to Late Antiquity, being heavily indebted to the Greek magical papyri. Like other obscure ancient texts such as the Bahir and Sefer Yetzirah, the work has existed in a number of versions. The tradition around the book says its angelic content was revealed to Adam by the archangel Raziel. The title itself is mentioned in another magical work of late antiquity, The Sword of Moses. Critical historians regard it as a medieval work, most probably originating among the Chassidei Ashkenaz, as citations from it begin to appear only in the 13th century. But sections of it are no doubt older. The likely compiler of the medieval version is Eleazer of Worms. It draws heavily on Sepher Yetzirah and Sepher Ha-Razim. There are multiple manuscript versions, containing up to seven tractates. The printed version of Sefer Raziel is divided into five books, some of it in the form of a mystical Midrash on Creation. It features an elaborate: - angelology, - magical uses of the zodiac, - gematria (Hebrew system of assigning numerical value to an alphabet and derived from Greek geometry), - names of God, - protective spells, - method of writing magical healing amulets. Raziel is an archangel within the teachings of Jewish Kabbalah mysticism, who is the “Keeper of Secrets” and the “Angel of Mysteries.” He is associated with the Sephira Chokmah (the second of ten) in Olam Briah, one of the Four Worlds of Kabbalistic theory. Raziel, under the alternate name Galizur, “Revealer of The Rock,” is described as the “ruling prince of the 2nd Heaven.” Archangel Raziel protects the ministering angels from the Hayyoth,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the “holy angels of fire” that uphold the universe. The famous Sefer Raziel HaMalach and its “Book of Raziel the Angel” is said to contain all secret knowledge, and is considered to be a book of magic. Book six of the Liber Razielis is based on the Sefer ha-Razim “Book of Secrets,” with various additions including the “Prayer of Adam” of Sefer Adam. Adam in his prayer to God, apologized for listening to his wife Eve, who was deceived by the snake into eating from the “Tree of Knowledge.” According to the “Book of Raziel,” God sent the highest of the Angels, Raziel, to teach Adam the spiritual laws of nature and life on earth, including the knowledge of the planets, stars and the spiritual laws of creation.

The Angel Raziel also taught Adam the knowledge of the power of speech, the power of thoughts and the power of a person's soul within the confines of the physical body and this physical world, basically teaching the knowledge with which one can harmonize physical and spiritual existence in this physical world. The Angel Raziel teaches the power of speech, the energy contained within the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, their combinations and meanings of names. According to Jewish traditions, the angel Raziel returned to teach Abraham all the spiritual knowledge and spiritual laws. The “ Book of Raziel” explains everything about astrology of the planets in our solar system, and explains how the creative life energy starts with a thought from the spiritual realms, transcending into speech and action in this physical world. The eternal divine creative life energy of this earth is love. The book explains the spiritual laws of birth, death, reincarnation of the soul, and many spiritual laws of “Change.” ] Deliberate Overall Destruction of the Clatford Pattern Charles Mallett of the Silent Circle Information Center in Calne received an early morning call on May 4, 2009, from his friend, Annemieke Witteveen. It was before 10 AM and Annemieke was in an airplane, saw the huge pattern in the Clatford oilseed rape,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"photographed it and called Charles. He got to the formation with two others by around 11 AM and took a couple of hours to walk through the massive pattern going up and down the field on a hill, realizing that it was impossible to see from one end of the pattern to the other on the ground. Upon first sight from a distant, Charles thought it was crisp and perfect like the preceding half dozen oilseed rape formations in Wiltshire reported since April 14, 2009. But then, as he began to walk into the precisely laid down plants, he was shocked to find broken stem after broken stem everywhere from one end to the other of the 800-foot-long by 300-foot-wide pattern. Charles told me, “All of the plants were broken pretty viciously and there were obvious trampled paths up and down the long avenues of the huge formation. The damage is not consistent with standard hoaxing, in my opinion.” He had never seen such destruction before, not even in formations known to have been hoaxed by a group known as “Team Satan,” some men in London and Wiltshire who have deliberately made crop patterns in southern England from the mid-1990s onward. But Team Satan's formations are always rough compared to the truly mysterious and perfectly flowing crop formations that go back to at least the 1970s in the Warminster to Avebury region.

More Information : W ikipedia: “Rapeseed ( Brassica napus ), also known as rape, oilseed rape, rapa, rapaseed and (in one group of cultivars) canola, is a bright yellow flowering member of the family Brassicaceae (mustard or cabbage family). The name derives from the Latin for turnip, rapum or rapa , and is first recorded in English at the end of the 14th century.” F or further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archived reports (partial list below) and my books, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in the Earthfiles Shop. • 10/01/2008 — Cross and “Bar Code” At Avebury Down Near Avebury, Wiltshire. • 09/29/2008 — Half Cat and Other Animal Mutilations Around the World and East of Palm Springs, California • 09/24/2008 — Part 5: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 09/23/2008 — AH-1W SuperCobra Helicopters and Glowing Sphere • 09/12/2008 — Part 4: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 09/07/2008 — Part 3: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 09/02/2008 — Part 2: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 08/27/2008 — Part 1: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases • 07/18/2008 — Part 3: Roswell Rock Lab Analysis • 07/16/2008 — Astronomical Data in July 2008 U.
