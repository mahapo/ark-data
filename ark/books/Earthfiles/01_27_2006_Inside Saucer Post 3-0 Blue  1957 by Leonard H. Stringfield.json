Stringfield (out of print) Reprinted with permission in Earthfiles.com © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe November 27, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In September 1957, Leonard H. Stringfield, finished his first book, Inside Saucer Post ... 3-0 Blue , based on his research cooperation with the U. S. Air Defense Command Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio. Len had served with the 5th U. S. Air Force and was baffled by three unidentified lights that he and other crew members saw in 1945 while being transported in a C-46 near Iwo Jima. After the war, Len Stringfield seriously began to investigate the UFO phenomena. He was Director of the Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects organization, also known as CRIFO, and edited ORBIT Magazine. Over nearly five decades, Len tried to learn from firsthand sources about government cover-ups of UFO incidents and the interaction of non-human intelligences with Earth. He died on December 18, 1994. At Earthfiles, with his family's permission, I have reprinted all of the UFO Crash/Retrieval Status Reports Len wrote. Please see More Information below. In the interest of providing historic archives which give a context for modern UFO reports, the following is a reprint of Len's first book in 1957 (out of print) after he collaborated with the Air Defense Command Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio, under his assigned code name, \"3-0 Blue.\" A n official publication of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO) © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield. T his book is dedicated to my daughters, Colette and Denise, who may some day read the official version of truth about the unidentified flying objects. FOREWORD Before accepting the title on the cover, I considered the aptness of several others, such as UFO , CRIFO and the Midnight Oil , suggested by my friend, Ted Bloecher; The House of Saucers , offered by my daughter, Colette, who has felt the intimacy of my all-consuming project; and my own, From Saucers to Ulcers, which in a sense was labeling another \"inside\" truth resulting from this project. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"But none of the hundreds of titles entertained could thread the CRIFO needle more definitively than my final choice, Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue. In these few words is revealed the silent \"other side\" of CRIFO's operations, which had its beginning in September 1955 when the Air Defense Command Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio, officially designated my home as a \"UFO reporting post.\" For this duty, my home telephone was cleared and I was assigned a code name, which was in part \"...3-0 Blue.\" While only Ground Observer Corps (GOC) personnel and a few associates during CRIFO's peak years knew of this work with ADC, CRIFO was better known internationally as a civilian \"clearing house\" for saucer information which I edited and featured in my publications, Newsletter/Orbit. To properly spike any misunderstanding, Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue , in spite of its swaggering name and the matter it describes, is not an exploitation of secret military data. Making certain I was in no manner violating security by publishing certain data which referred to Post ...3-0 Blue, I wrote to the Security Review Branch of the Department of Defense. They replied tersely that it was \"not a matter of interest to the Department of Defense.\" While \"3-0 Blue\" may not publicly be of interest to the Department of Defense - or for that matter, may not prove anything to the skeptic who must see a saucer land in his yard - I hope that the \"Inside\" part of the title will be justified by the text, which describes the human side of the CRIFO story, plus what its director thinks on many controversial issues. In presenting the facts, I have also endeavored to unmask the many rumors which claim that the press is censored, that science is biased and the misconception that every light in the sky is a spaceship. As in the old days when facing Orbit deadlines, writing this book has had its share of ups and downs. As usual, my only encouragement came from the old-line of faithfuls to whom I will forever be grateful. Unfortunately, they are too numerous to mention. But, as I write this Foreword with the finished text beside me, I am once again reliving the climacterics of CRIFO from its primordial The Incident to Iwo on to its lugubrious last lines ending this book. LEONARD H. STRINGFIELD September 23, 1957 1 - THE INCIDENT TO IWO To start at the beginning properly, I must go back to \"sometime\" 1950 when my roving half-hearted inquisitiveness about flying saucers finally brought home a rich reward - two glowing first-hand reports each occurring within a short time of the other. One told of a local family sitting outdoors who were shocked by an object zooming low over their house. According to the key witness, the object lit up the whole yards and the rooftop. The other report described a blue-colored ball swinging like a pendulum across the expanse of a ridge just north of Cincinnati. To me, these reports had the ring of genuineness, mainly because the sighters themselves were \"genuine\" people. Somehow, I thought, the press accounts had always made the sighter seem unreal! But my judgment of past events at the time was hardly a creditable one. In no one instance can I remember doing more than gloss over a story. In brief, my life between 1947 when saucers were first publicized and 1950 was mainly one of \"husbanding\" and plying a career in advertising. Remotest in my mind were spacemen and spaceships. But when the 1950 sightings reached me, all at once an incident in the past leaped into real significance. The incident, one which had been forgotten along with other distasteful events of the war years, suddenly lent tremendous support to the suggestion that saucers were interplanetary. Accordingly, it took on a new and ominous meaning. From it eventually grew CRIFO and the underlying reasons for the many pessimistic tones in its publications."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"S tringfie ld: \"Sketch, from memory, of three unidentified 'blobs' of light seen from imperiled C-46 while flying from Ie Shima to Iwo Jima, south of Japan, on August 28, 1945. While this sighting is inconclusive, I have classified it along with other unexplained 'foo fighter' phenomena seen by airmen during World War II.\" Sketch © 1957 by Leonard H. Stringfield. I have many times since 1950 tried to reconstruct the facts of the incident, hunting for details, trying to remember my reactions. But the terrors of the moment, plus the erasure of time, have left me little to go on, save only the starkest highpoints. A check into my U. S. Army diary told me the incident occurred August 28, 1945, while flying from Ie Shima, near Okinawa, to Iwo Jima. I was being transported in a C-46, a \"flying coffin\" whose number was 304. I was one of nine members of 5th Air Force personnel (with special equipment ) assigned to occupy Atsugi Airdrome near Tokyo, Japan, prior to the major landing forces. For the incident itself I must rely on my memory. According to a note in my diary, the passengers were Harry Berning, Stouch, W. J. Smith, Ramsey, Greenwell, Vucetich, Vaerly, Briggs, myself, and three unknown crew members, pilot, co-pilot and navigator. In my search for possible verification, I have located only one passenger, Harry Berning of Cincinnati. Without putting words into his mouth, I asked Berning what he recalled about the incident at Iwo? Said Berning, \"I'll remember the flight as long as I live. I was plenty scared ... I remember our plane getting off course. We were lost. I first knew something was wrong when the co-pilot came back and told us, 'We're in trouble.' I remember our plane flying in heavy clouds and the co-pilot handed me a pair of binoculars so I could help them look for a clearing.\" When I asked Berning about seeing the three objects, he said he didn't. When I told him I had seen them from the left side of the plane, he said he was on the right side and again emphasized, \"I was plenty scared.\" In spite of my belief that the objects were responsible for my plane's behavior, I hope that I haven't over-dramatized the incident. During the flight, about midway between Ie Shima and Iwo Jima, the C-46 suddenly developed trouble in the left engine, the prop feathering. As the plane dipped, sputtered oil and lost altitude, I remember looking out through one of the portholes and to my surprise, seeing three unidentifiable blobs of brilliant white light, each about the size of a dime held at arm's length. The blobs were traveling in a straight line through drifts of cloud, seemingly parallel to the C-46 and equal to its speed. I vaguely recall that when my plane pulled up, the objects remained below and they disappeared into a cloud bank. All other details are hazy for I had no reason at that time to rationalize the objects or try to identify them. Also, my prime concern at the moment was the performance of the C-46 and my personal safety. I remember pointing out the objects to a companion nearby, but cannot recall any unusual concern about the lights on his part, for he too was more apprehensive of his safety. The plane, without further incident, landed safely at Iwo. I remember it undergoing extensive check-up so that it would be ready and airborne for the final hop to Atsugi. No one during the stop-over mentioned the objects as I recall, nor did I report them, for Iwo at that time was a bustling staging area waiting for the war officially to end. At this writing, still relying on my memory revived in 1950, I can find no mundane explanation for the three objects flying abreast of my plane high over the Pacific. It is my opinion that the objects were propelled devices being possibly analogous in appearance and behavior to the popular \"foo fighter\" of World War II vintage, which is still unexplained, according to Air Force statements. I also believe that the sudden erratic behavior of my plane was due to a mysterious force generated by the UFOs."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"While I have often alluded to this incident in previous writings and lectures, I have never disclosed its details. In the early days of CRIFO I was tempted several times to give it top billing in the Newsletter , but then it was a matter of keeping up with all the latest news. In the March 1955 issue of Newsletter, which spoke out against the theory suggesting saucers were secreet U. S. weapons, I had planned to include a section on the foo-fighter. A perfect tie-in, I thought, for such \"foo-nomena,\" as witnessed by myself, could not have possibly been earthmade. No nation, in defeat or in victory, in my opinion, would have been so foolhardy as to use a secret weapon during the delicate period of surrender. I had all my arguments lined up, good ones, I reasoned. In support of my contentions, I would lead off with other foo fighter reports already published in saucer literature. Next was the possibility of getting two more good reports from reliable sources. I promptly secured one, the sighter having been a radio operator of a B-24 during a mission over Formosa in 1945. His report described a vertical chain of luminous globes, one following the other in a spiral climb toward his aircraft. Showing no menace, they continued to climb out of view. When a reply to my inquiry about the other report finally arrived, I was told by this correspondent that the information had best not be revealed because of security. Pressed by time, I dropped the matter thinking I would later devote an entire issue to this subject. But like other proposals such as lunar findings and the little bipeds, the foo-fighters never got to print. In the late months of CRIFO, I decided to keep my experience confidential until I would someday write my book. By 1952, the year of the wildest saucer flap, I was pretty well sold on the Interplanetary Theory. According to Edward J. Ruppelt in The Report On Unidentified Flying Objects , \"a flap is a condition, or situation, or state of being, of a group of people characterized by an advanced degree of confusion that has not quite yet reached panic proportions ...\" Max Miller in Flying Saucers, Fact or Fiction, says: \"When applied to UFOs, a flap designates anything from a 'flurry' to a 'panic' of sighting reports and the resultant effects.\" A bout fifty miles northeast of Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, is Wright Patterson AFB in Fairborn, Ohio. Norw ood is a suburb northeast of Cincinnati. On July 25, 1952, while the nation was in a tizzy over the Washington blip incident (UFOs on radar over the Capitol), I saw something. It was a large, orange teardrop-shaped object zipping soundlessly across the night sky. Other Cincinnatians who saw it said it changed direction. Reporting it to the press, I also announced that I was forming Civilian Investigating Group for Aerial"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Phenomena. But while CIGAP did not go very far as a fellowship in research, its existence in name only did manage to stir up local interest. It put me on television where I first met the Reverend Gregory Miller, the key person to the most fact-rooted case on CRIFO record. It also brought in several good current reports. But, out of the hundreds of reports reaching me during the 1952 flap, only a handful were worthy of investigation. Most were just lights in the sky - and, as the Air Force would say - could be simply explained if more data were obtainable. More than once, I too saw lights in the sky during this big flap, but looking back critically, I cannot say the lights were saucers. As my files grew, so did my exasperation with the official policy of silence and contradiction. Like others \"all stirred up,\" I began writing letters. One, published in the Cincinnati Enquirer, won me $5.00 as the best letter of the year. In this missive, I slapped at Dr. Harlow Shapely, Director of the Harvard Observatory, for his statement calling \"saucers a lot of complete nonsense.\" In another letter published in the December 1952 issue of Tr ue magazine, I wrote: \"...I like your forward, fact-rooted, go-to-hell approach on the subject. ...It seems rather curious how the general run of newspapers and certain national magazines neatly avoid the facts and run to the apron strings of some expert who will tell them that saucers are cobwebs.\" While my letter to Tr ue was rather pointless, it did bring me several key letters. One was from Bill Culmer of Robinson, Illinois, an energetic fact-hunter, with lots of leads, a level head and an above-average sighting to his credit. Culmer, who died September 20, 1954, was indeed the spark of inspiration which led me to take the bull by the horns. In the course of our letter writing, we parlayed the idea and the need for a research organization with a factual bulletin. 2 - CRIFO IS BEGAT During my exchange of letters with Culmer, I was a reasonably normal husband and father. By day, I was the advertising manager of a nationally known manufacturer. After hours, I worked my hobbies. My favorite lair was my greenhouse. I would spend hours there, puttering with exotic philodendron, anthurium and fern. When I tired of this, I turned to my oils and brush - or dabbled in things scientific such as astronomy or paleontology. Saucers, however, were winning over. One day to my sorrow, I found that my avidity for saucers and neglect of my greenhouse had caused the demise of Anthurium veitchii, my rarest and most prized aroid. Perhaps this was my turning point, for it was a week later that I decided to take up the saucer hue and cry. On March 10, 1954, I founded Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), and began working on a format for a monthly publication. A bulletin, I thought, would serve to keep all my correspondents informed. I decided to print only 200 copies. Then in a radio newscast of May 18, 1954, Frank Edwards, who had championed saucers since 1950 over the airwaves, urged his ten million listeners to write for CRIFO's Newsletter. Twenty-four hours later, the life of Leonard H. Stringfield was changed! What had been a simple pursuit erupted into a brute of big business. I ate my dinner at the telephone and entertained guests while I typed. Bookkeeping nearly replaced romance and my only rest was in the sanctum of the bathroom. By the end of the month, nearly 6000 letters of inquiry had been processed in my basement, which had become CRIFO's headquarters. My staff was my wife, Dell, conscripted from the kitchen; my daughters Colette (6) and Denise (4), who licked postage stamps; my mother; and my friend, Herb Clark with the Ground Observer Corps (GOC). Letters from enthusiasts everywhere in the world ranged from retired generals, pilots, engineers, newspapermen, doctors and lawyers, businessmen, members of a nudist colony, a woman who had seen an \"unidentified flying man\" - and one lost soul who, enclosing a dollar, left only one return address on the moon."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"L andslide of mail following the Frank Edwards radio broadcast of May 18, 1954, at which time he told his \"10,000,000 Americans\" to write to CRIFO for its Newsletter.

Since those hectic days in 1954, the CRIFO project has missed little or nothing in the saga of saucers. Coming to mind are many happy moments, like being the toast of many civic or social groups; like feeling honored by a letter from her Majesty, the Queen of England, or Sir Winston Churchill, or Lord Mountbatten of Burma - or like being reminded in a letter from a subscriber, \"We especially appreciated your frank and objective reporting.\" And, coming to mind are the moments of despair, like the day I drove to Lawrenceburg, Indiana, to investigate a saucer that landed. I found instead a Fourth of July spin wheel. But out of each month's gross of evidence came a rewarding net of vital information - information that made CRIFO a Pentagon-in-miniature which sought to serve the public's appetite for truth. Air Force heads knew this. Perhaps that is why four dapper gentlemen in the summer of 1954 visited my home with such obvious urgency and asked such pointblank questions. Perhaps that is also why Major General John A. Samford, USAF, then Director of Intelligence, wrote me on March 16, 1956: \"The Air Force greatly appreciates the interest which you and your organization, as well as others, have taken in the Unidentified Flying Object program. The success of this program has been, in part, due to the excellent cooperation of such individuals and groups in submitting UFO reports for consideration either directly or through various publications. These reports have become an important part of the UFO picture. A continuation of this assistance is indeed welcome ...In conclusion, please accept our thanks for your interest in this matter and be assured that we are always glad to receive contributions such as yours.\" 3 - CRIFO GOES \"ON DUTY\" It was a warm evening on September 11, 1955, when I presented my simple civilian case for the interplanetary flying saucer. My audience was the members of the Ground Observer Corps (GOC), which represented all posts in Hamilton County, Ohio. I remember while driving to the meeting place at the Anderson Township School in Forestville, remarking to Herb Clark, then Chief Observer for that area's GOC post, that the recent upswing of saucer reports in the county was causing concern in the Air Force. The U. S. Air Force had released a Special Report 14, on October 25, 1955, which indicated by map that Hamilton County, Ohio, and environs ranked third highest in the nation in frequency of UFO reports during the period 1947 to 1952. During this upswing, my telephone jangled at all hours. Most calls were routine reports describing \"lights in the sky.\" Others, however, were voices sounding urgent. \"It's right over my house. What should I do?\" exclaimed one lady, alone and frightened in Mt. Washington. I suggested that she call the sheriff and I would report to the Air Force. The weirdest, perhaps, was a frantic call from Anderson's Ferry. A male voice cried, \"It's a big light and it's landing in my backyard.\" Then a companion's voice broke in, \"Something's coming out of the bottom. Hurry!\" Promising to call back, the receiver slammed down and that was the last we heard from Anderson's Ferry. Other calls, less desperate, but giving me time to run outdoors - sometimes clad only in shorts and binoculars - told of flying quoits, footballs and triangles. Usually too late for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the good ones, I always managed to make it in time to see Venus sinking gibbously on the horizon or Arcturus \"bobbing around\" behind a veil of ruffled atmosphere, or a \"whole group of saucers\" which were nothing more than the Pleiades. Unknown to most callers was my new assignment with the U. S. Air Force. On September 9, 1955, the Air Defense Command - probably triggered into decision by an incident occurring the night before - informed me that my home telephone had been cleared to report UFOs through coded channels directly to the Filter Center in Columbus, Ohio. Wanted were up-to-the-minute sightings reaching me from the greater Cincinnati area. But, even before this official clearance, I had reason to be in quick communication with the Filter Center. On August 5, having already been briefed on procedure by GOC, I reported the flight of a spectacular UFO, large and brilliant - seen by thousands and myself - coursing over the city. And then, on September 8, 1955 - the trigger incident - I reported that a local skywatcher, Gordon Zerbo, had phoned asking me to check a large object, maybe a \"satellite\" in space, which he was seeing through his telescope. I was eager to investigate, for coming to mind was another large object or satellite - nearly 10,000 feet in diameter - which had glowed over Cincinnati skies in the beam of a powerful searchlight during 1949-1950. When I first glimpsed through Zerbo's telescope, which peered through a narrow clearing in a clump of treetops, I was frankly puzzled. In focus was a gaseous orange ball which appeared to be spinning. For almost two hours, I watched the object which seemed fixed in the sky, and for two hours I remained in close touch with the Filter Center, reporting every new development. On the second night, I began to suspect an astronomical oversight and on the third night had solved the mystery - the satellite was Polaris, the \"fixed\" North Star! The object which seemed so large and gaseous was only an optical illusion - poor lens. But myriads of other UFOs reported during this turbulent period were less easily explained away. Knowing this was Intelligence at Wright-Patterson AFB who, I later learned, was worried about the \"satellite.\" Most calls, significantly, came from the thinly populated perimeter of the city of Cincinnati. Many told of low flying objects; others of objects hovering near the ground. A few callers, speaking guardedly, told of frightening encounters with ugly little bipeds. In one area, just west of Cincinnati, UFO reports were so heavy that people were afraid to leave their homes after dark, and men carried firearms."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"C incinnati Times Star, October 20, 1955, describing UFO activity in Western Cincinnati that concerned the U. S. Air Force. It was in the midst of this ominous activity that I opened my lecture. Sitting beside me near the podium were 1st Lt. Edward Thorne and Sgt. James Ussery of the Air Defense Command Filter Center. Before me were the rows of audience. To ease matters, I tried a little stratagem. Whipping a hanky from my pocket on which were smears of my wife's lipstick, I pretended to wipe my brow. Then, looking surprised at the smears, I commented triumphantly, \"Well, at least my wife loves me! In spite of saucers, she still thinks I'm sane.\" Nobody laughed! Most members had seen saucers; they were in no joking mood. Nor was I really, and I lost no time hammering at my strongest links of evidence. I highlighted the Norwood Searchlight Incident. [ Editor's Note: 1949 UFO Incident, Norwood, Ohio, suburb of Cincinnati - Between August 19, 1949 and March 10, 1950, police, military officials, scientists, clergy and civilians in the Norwood, Ohio, region reported ten visual sightings of a strange, glowing, large aerial object. Photos were taken on October 23, 1949, by Norwood Police Sgt. Leo Davidson, and two reels of motion picture film were kept in the possession of Reverend Gregory Miller, last seen at WCPO Channel 9 TV studios in 1952. Still frames from the movie film were given to investigator Leonard Stringfield and published in his book Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue. There was also the alleged observation of the object by searchlight operator Donald R. Berger, who kept detailed log notes about his observations. The sightings began in earnest after 11:00 p.m. on August 19, 1949. Berger's logs indicate that he observed the UFO from 8:15 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. Cincinnati residents saw it until 6:30 a.m. the following morning. The public argument about movie theater searchlights creating the object seems contradicted by an all night event. Also, one weather bureau official said in the early"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"morning he saw two objects that looked like \"two weather ceiling balloons\" that weren't moving despite a wind speed of 25 to 32 miles per hour. Even the 1949 Berger logs stated: \"When I moved the searchlight away, the object continued to glow,\" which might have been a second object. Berger's logs were kept by Rev. Gregory Miller until 1954. Rev. Miller then gave the logs to UFO investigator Leonard Stringfield. ] A bove: One of a series of photographs showing the searchlight beam illuminating the object which was computed to be 10,000 feet in diameter.

My final hammer blows were directed at the"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"press, which I accused of muzzling saucer stories. While citing one silenced case, Lt. Thorne discreetly slipped a note onto my podium on which he had written, \"The press is here.\" Indeed! No sooner had I closed my question and answer period than Jim Johnson, a youngish Cincinnati Post reporter, rushed me from the milling audience. He was visibly stirred by my scorn of the press and equally stirred to get a hot story. E astern Hills, Ohio, Journal, September 23, 1955. Reporter Johnson kept picking at a reference I had made to censorship, a word I had used loosely in answering someone's question about the hidden saucer evidence. It was obvious that Johnson was planning to feature this angle. Despite my objections, and later attempts to reason with him, even to point out a misquote in his notes, he sputtered defiance. He showed the same implacability when he finally wheedled me into surrendering a photograph I had shown the audience. And so it was that the young reporter departed with his hot story. Next day I looked for the Johnson blast in the Post, but to my surprise there was not even a squib about my talk, or the GOC meeting."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Curious, I phoned the city desk. I asked about the story. The reply: \"Decided against it.\" I asked about the photograph. The reply: \"Too hazy. It would show too much grain in a blowup.\" Back after my GOC talk, after the last loitering members left the auditorium, I approached Lt. Thorne, who was stuffing papers into his folio and said, \"I didn't tell them everything.\" I hastened to explain that I was urged before the lecture by Walter Paner, then supervisor of Hamilton County GOC, to \"tell all I knew about flying saucers.\" When I saw Lt. Thorne looking at me quizzically, I added that Paner had assured me that my talk had the official nod from \"somebody higher up.\" Lt. Thorne was silent as we moved toward the exit. Then as we emerged outdoors, I said that it was not my intention to undersell my theories, or the GOC, but I did renege on some of my best evidence about the Norwood Searchlight incident. I then told him that certain facts known by me about that case were confidential and must remain so. These facts, I said, clinch my argument for the interplanetary saucer. \"Someday you may be proved right,\" said Lt. Thorne.
