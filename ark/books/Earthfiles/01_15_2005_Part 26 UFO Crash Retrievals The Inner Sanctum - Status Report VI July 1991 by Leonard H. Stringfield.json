Continued - Len Stringfield's reprint of report from Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: Long Island UFO Network (LIUFON), New York: Moriches Bay and surrounding communities on Long Island, New York, south of Brookhaven National Laboratory. Quogue is south of the Westhampton Air Guard facility. THE MEETINGS WITH THE SCIENTIST (continued) 4) The weapon which was used was a Doppler Radar System. It was built and also developed at A.I.L. Electronics on Long Island through funding allocated for both Star Wars research and Stealth technology research. The circuitry was worked on by both him and his engineering team. He took great pride during the second meeting when he announced that the transmitter was actually developed by him. It was his 'Baby,' that did the job. 5) Some of the research on the weapon was performed by Brookhaven National Laboratories in the testing of some of the circuits and also with overcoming some of the design problems. The radar beam had to be made to bend at 90 degrees in order to penetrate the craft's plasma field which surrounds its frame. This way, the beam would not be deflected and would have a chance to neutralize the power in the alien vessel's drive. 6) During the first meeting, he selected a drawing developed by the investigative team on the case with LIUFON which was based on the information gathered from Phil Imbrogno and several of the sightings here on the Island. As mentioned earlier, the exact shape of the object was never released by LIUFON until after the April meeting to the public. The scientist picked out that drawing as the best description of the object he saw. It should be noted this drawing closely resembles the Kings Park "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and the Gardner Manor State Park drawings. Those reports did not develop until October 1990. 7) Dr. Nick stated during the second meeting that there had been a test of the weapon five months before the incident down at Fort Meade, Maryland. It occurred in a secured hangar area where an alien boomerang (some 60 feet across) had been recovered and was levitated 100 feet above the ground. It was knocked down and its impact absorbed by a huge inflated impact cushion. This is how the government knew the weapon would work. He and his team were present for the test. 8) Dr. Nick Informed LIUFON the object had been repeatedly tracked throughout the Northeast by satellite for months. They knew that it would pass through Long Island this night and plans were made to intercept it. The government did not care if the populace on Long Island should see or hear something peculiar since they felt no one would pay it any attention (they forgot about LIUFON). The object and its technology had to be recovered. 9) Dr. Nick informed John Ford at the first meeting that the incident was part of a confrontation with an extraterrestrial civilization that has been underway for some five years. 10) Dr. Nick further stated he knew some of the electronics and the reactor were sent to Brookhaven Labs that night by convoy, since he had spoken to associates who had worked on and examined the wreckage at a secured area inside the laboratory grounds. As far as he knew, the wreckage was still there being examined as of April 1990. 11) The Suffolk County government was involved in the preparations for the incident and cooperated fully in assisting in whatever way they could. Dr. Nick felt the closing of the campground prematurely was evidence of what he had told LIUFON. 12) He does not know what happened to the structural wreckage or how it was removed from the Bay. He did not now of any fatalities, but was not surprised at the story George Dickson had repeated. He was surprised that there were not more killed. 13) There were a number of alien bodies recovered and these were sent to Brookhaven Laboratories for study. 14) The depressed circle of vegetation in the Dunes which LIUFON field teams had discovered was the site of the radar antenna's position. It was some 75 feet in diameter. Dr. Nick stated that it rests on three legs of a tripod base and should have made similar indentations in the grass. It should be noted that Kelly Freeman reported in his field report that there were smaller depressions in the circle as though something heavy was resting inside the vegetation depression on support legs. This was never reported to the public. Dr. Nick had to have been there to have seen this and had to have firsthand knowledge. 15) The object had been chased through Connecticut by an F-117A fighter, which had been selected for the job since it could not be detected by the alien craft. This was disclosed during the first meeting and helped to lead our investigation astray a little bit. It does not surprise the staff at LIUFON since it had been learned that F-117As had been flying in and out of Grumman's in Calverton during 1989 and 1990 for electronic uplifts at the facility. 16) Shortly after the second talk, Dr. Nick told John Ford that he had received a threatening phone call that his home would be bombed with him in it if he continued to talk about the incident. This cannot be confirmed nor disproved, but Dr. Nick is terrified at the threat for he stated if they (the government) are desperate enough, they will carry out their threats. 17) Concerning the blue light in the Dunes - Dr. Nick informed LIUFON that the blue light was a plasma field built up around the radar antenna when it was sufficiently charged to transmit its beam. It was at the second meeting that he told Ford the additional information that the weapon was not turned on until a few minutes before the hour of twelve. SCIENTIST'S VERSION OF THE INCIDENT Dr. Nick, on the night of the incident, was whisked from his office along with two members of his engineering team, by two military officers. They were ordered to be"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"available the night of the incident for a demonstration test of the device. They were also instructed to have the transmitter ready for the night's test. They were taken in two civilian jeeps with the transmitter to the Smith's Point Beach Park. They passed over the bridge heading East along the access road to the gate to the Dune Preserve. Dr. Nick estimated the time of his arrival to have been sometime before 11:00 PM. As he and his group passed the main parking field, he noticed several large trucks parked in the field which appeared to be large tractor trailer flatbed trucks. Passing through the gate to the Dune Preserve, he was driven into the camp ground area. Here there were two military vans camouflaged by nets for concealment in the area. One was a communications van while the other was a radar tracking van. They were given instructions by a senior military officer where to proceed into the Dunes for the site of the system. Driving along the dirt tracks in the Sand Dunes, they proceeded to the location of the Doppler Radar System. It was located on a peninsula that jutted out into the Bay. The antenna was recessed into a sand dune that was able to conceal it from view. Parked nearby were two Ford Econoline Vans packed with all the equipment. Nearby was a large 400 Hz. generator that was used to power the weapon. (At the time of this statement, it was made during the first meeting and was before the receipt by LIUFON of the report concerning the Soviet satellite crash. That report mentioned the presence of a 400 Hz generator. Dr. Nick did not learn of the satellite report until after the April meeting.) As they disembarked, they could see helicopters flying around the Bay. They were circling a formation of bright amber lights that was slowly moving towards the East. He became very suspicious of the nature of this operation. He had been present for the test demonstration at Fort Meade, where he witnessed the test on the recovered UFO. He had been told then that the system was to be used to disrupt field propulsion systems. He never expected it to operate in a real scenario against a UFO. When the transmitter was set up and connected, the system was energized. Beginning around 11:30 or 11:45 PM, the antenna began to glow a bright blue from the field being generated by the high voltage. the weapon was ready. The engineering team was instructed to wait until the object came back into view. Around 12:00 or 12:15 AM, the object came into view as it passed over the Northeast Shoreline. As it did, a series of searchlights hidden along the shoreline were turned on the object and its helicopter escort. The object turned on a series of white lights outlining the silhouette of the object. Dr. Nick could see its outline clearly. He also observed that the amber lights, which were still on, were not on the periphery of the craft, but on its bottom. The white lights were located on its leading edges and were very small in a continuous illuminating pattern. At some time between 12:00 and 12:15 AM on the morning of September 29, 1989, the order was given to bring it down. The switch was thrown and Dr. Nick observed the object which was low over the middle of the Bay several hundred yards from his position, to instantly fall into the Bay's waters. It broke upon impact into two sections and produced a tremendous roar and a slight swell. Immediately, the military ordered Dr. Nick and his team to 'Get the hell out of here.' They were loaded onto the jeeps and driven out past the Camp Grounds into the main beach area. while driving over the bridge, he observed helicopters hovering over the Bay where the object had sank. A few days after this event, associates who had examined the wreckage informed him that there had been alien bodies, an anti-matter reactor and advanced electronics taken from the alien craft to Brookhaven Laboratories. He was informed that the metal the object was composed of was super strong, but incredibly light. The total weight of the object in comparison to its size was unbelievably light. THE TWO AIR GUARDSMEN LIUFON has spoken to two New York State Air National Guardsmen assigned to the Rescue Unit at West Hampton. They and their unit were involved in the Air Sea Rescue operation the night of the incident. They informed LIUFON's Frank Columbo, Richard Stout and John Ford that the area of their operation for that night was off West Hampton, some two to three miles"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"off shore. They stated further that they had talked to pilots and air crews in their unit about this incident after seeing newspaper articles concerning it. They replied that their comrades had no idea of what we were talking about in LIUFON. The two Airmen informed us that their unit had no helicopters or aircraft over the Northwest section of the Bay that night. They had no idea who could have been flying the aircraft involved in the area in question. CASE SUMMARY From all apparent evidence presented herein, it is the opinion of LIUFON that the United States government - in a carefully planned and executed military-intelligence operation - intercepted and brought down an alien spacecraft in the area of Moriches Bay off the South Shore of Suffolk County, Long Island, New York, on the early morning of September 29, 1989. The case is still under investigation. LIUFON admits it has made mistakes in some of its initial findings. Most notably was the preliminary assumption that the second object might have been the secret version of the stealth bomber. This was based on information given to us by Bob Oeschler who compared the Moriches Bay photos to pictures taken of this secret aircraft by other witnesses. The two sightings in Kings Park and over Gardner Manor State Park, in our opinion, prove the objects to have been alien and leave the question of the B-2 Bomber out of the picture. The evidence presented herein speaks for itself. The report concerning the Soviet satellite crash allegedly from government files might contain some elements of truth, but the incident was not a satellite retrieval. The information obtained by Phil Imbrogno, however, conclusively disproved the story of a Russian satellite crash. It is interesting to note that Dr. Nick told LIUFON that the craft was being tracked by satellite since the government has learned to read the magnetic signature of these craft and the individual signature of each individual alien ship. A reference is made to U. S. satellites being involved in the tracking of the decaying Russian satellite in the story unearthed about the Russian crash. It seems that there is correlation between many of the things that occurred or were reported to LIUFON in this secret government report. Yet, their story is about a Russian satellite crash and ours is about a UFO crash. From the appearance of the story, it appears contrived and an effort to provide a tale for an unusual event. It is widely known that intelligence procedures call for two cover stories to be used in case the first fails, then the second exists as a backup. This may be the case with this story.\" End LIUFON Report THE HYPOTHETICAL ALIEN UPDATE Leonard Stringfield: There is enough testimonial evidence of a technical nature from qualified sources to support the belief that the UFO is an extraordinary extraterrestrial machine. But, simply put, the most convincing evidence to back up the ET hypothesis - that would satisfy most researchers - still lies in the hope of learning something more definitive about the machine's alien occupants. In the main circumstantially, we are limited to only two corridors through which the convincing kind of data can be obtained. At the end of one is the physical/physiological evidence which one can see and touch if one has the right Top Secret access clearance. Probably, it would be a retrieved humanoid cadaver cryogenically preserved, or perhaps pickled in a pink liquid. The other is the behavioral corridor which, in time, might come from the study of abductions. Analyses of these case histories I must leave to the specialists in that field. Unlike abductions, however, which can be publicly discussed at the discretion of the victim, my search for facts about the hypothetical alien must come from sources in-the-know who, of course, are forbidden to talk. The chances of getting substantive information from either corridor are remote. But, people will be people, and there are exceptions to the kind who can live with sealed lips. in the past two years, I've been in touch with several sources who claim they have information about a captive live alien. But, while most fade away like the fabled Cheshire cat, two sources tell of scientific and/or military contact with an alien being. (Other than those described as in a state of suspended animation.) One source who was more specific"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"is a physicist whose friend also is a scientist and was assigned to interrogate a live entity in isolation under rigid control conditions. The details entrusted to me are, by request, not publishable at this time. I know that my vague references to a live alien can be construed as baseless nonsense. But, in retrospect, I remember the looks of consternation and the printed words of disbelief in 1980 when I published a statement from a medical source in The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, Status Report II, which described the alien anatomy. (To be re-printed in future Earthfiles.) But why should I be so privileged, you might ask, when the door to such extraordinary information was shut to others in research? Or why should I receive instead of a medical person? I don't know why, really, but I can guess. My first contact with one of my two sources came in May of 1978 after a known researcher visited me at my office in the DuBois Chemicals Tower in Cincinnati. We discussed my deepening interest in UFO crash/retrievals and it seemed like only minutes had passed when, to my surprise, he volunteered that he knew a doctor in his city who might be willing to talk to me about an autopsied alien body. Having already heard of some pretty alarming stories about saucer crashes and recoveries of big-headed alien bodies, this one, I thought, was just too farfetched and I recall saying, 'You must be joking.' But it was no joke. In a short lapse of time, my research friend with the doctor of his acquaintance and I met in a suburban restaurant for an introductory chat. Suddenly, for the first time, I felt a chill of reality. The doctor was real. He was personable and he was quick to answer some basic questions I had prepared about the alien with humanoid features. There would be more to come, he said, and then extended an invitation to visit his home, meet his family and other associates. In all, I made five trips to the mid-western city where my sources, a biochemist and his colleague hematologist lived and worked at a major hospital. It was also during this period in 1978 and 1980 that my hardcover book, Situation Red: The UFO Siege, was published by Doubleday & Co., which had reached its peak of readership internationally. With this asset and my constant hammering at the crash/retrieval cover-up, I became an easy prey for radio talk shows and glitzy newspaper stories. But the story of UFOs crashing and humanoid cadavers was way over the heads of the average citizen who still had doubts about the sanity of people who reported a strange light in the sky. Needed was something in writing that appeared to be authoritative - a breakthrough to make the reader think twice. After more than a year of 'negotiations,' my breakthrough came in the mail from the hematologist: a typewritten statement, according to the agreed upon terms - without masthead or attached name of its sender. Written in layman terminology, I have every reason to believe the doctor's statement. Based on his autopsy, it describes the alien anatomy. I further believe that it was 'cleared' for me by a higher authority to release as a test of public reaction especially by the media, the medical community and, yes, researchers. On one occasion during a visit at the home of the biochemist, I was asked to be the featured guest on a radio talk show. My topic: alien anatomy and crashed UFOs. Unknown to all, including the host, was the secret status of my friend, the doctor, sitting beside me, who remained silent while I did all the talking. Among the conditions of agreement, which I had sworn to keep with my informants, was the confidentiality of their work and the name of the hospital and city in which some of their research was conducted. Because of the importance of the 'cleared' statement which I published in my Status Report II , I feel that it should be shared again in this report, which follows: Biochemist Describes Alien Anatomy Based On Autopsy/ies: 'SIZE - The specimen observed was 4 foot three and three-eights inches in length. I can't remember the weight. It has been so long and my files do not contain the weight. I recall the length well because we had a disagreement and everyone took their turn at measuring. HEAD - The head was pear-shaped in appearance and oversized by human standards for the body. The eyes were Mongoloid in appearance. The ends of the eyes furthest from the nasal cavity slanted upward at about a ten degree angle. The eyes were recessed into the head. There seemed to be no visible eyelids, only what seemed like a fold. The nose consisted of a small fold-like protrusion above the nasal"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"orifices. The mouth seemed to be a wrinkle-like fold. There were no human type lips as such - just a slit that opened into an oral cavity about two inches deep. A membrane along the rear of the cavity separated it from what would be the digestive tract. The tongue seemed to be atrophied into almost a membrane. No teeth were observed. X-rays revealed a maxilla and mandible as well as cranial bone structure. The outer 'ear lobes' did not exist. The auditory orifices present were similar to our middle and inner ear canals. The head contained no hair follicles. The skin seemed grayish in color and seemed mobile when moved. The above observations are from general anatomical observations. I did not autopsy or study the head portion in any great detail since this was not my area of specialty.' [ Editor's Note: Stringfield included in his report hypothetical drawings by Chuck Oldham of what a \"grey alien\" might look like. When the scientist allegedly involved with alien necropsies saw the drawings, he made the following comments below to Stringfield: Hypothetical Drawings of \"Grey Alien\" Hypothetical drawings of \"alien head\" © 1990 by Chuck Oldham. SCIENTIST'S NOTE: 'Your drawings of the head should have the cheek bones removed or a smoother contour. The eyes in the nasal cavity area are not right. The recess and fold is continuous across the forehead. The neck seems too long, but the shoulders do not slope as prominently. The arms are oversized in length by human standards. There was no thumb. The index finger in your drawing is longer than the middle finger. I don't believe this is correct, but my memory is hazy at this point. The chest area contained what seemed like two atrophied mammary gland nipples. The sexual organs were atrophied. Some other investigators have observed female specimens. I have not had this opportunity. The legs were short and thin. The feet did not show any toes. The skin covered the foot in such a way that it gave the appearance of wearing a sock. However, X-ray examination showed normal bone structure underneath.'\" Editor's Note: \"Extraterrestrial Biological Entity\" (EBE) Drawn by Abductee "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"More pear-shaped head drawn under hypnosis on July 9, 1984, by D.
