The county seat is Stephenville and the Erath County Courthouse above was completed in 1893. Image courtesy TXGenWebProject. D ecember 17, 2008 Stephenville, Texas - Almost one year ago, at the end of January 2008, I flew to Texas to talk with eyewitnesses and see videotapes, photos and sketches of the many unidentified aerial craft sightings reported that month over Stephenville, Dublin, Selden, Glen Rose and surrounding region. That group of rural towns is southwest of Dallas/Fort Worth. One eyewitness in January was Lee Roy Gaitan, Erath County Constable for Precinct 2, officed in Dublin, a town of about 4,000 people only eight miles southwest of Stephenville. Stephenville is the larger Erath County seat with about 15,000 residents. S trange aerial phenomena have been concentrated since January 1, 2008, in the triangular region of small Texas tow ns southwest of Fort Worth. Stephenville is the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population about 15,000. Dublin is about eight miles southwest and has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Selden with a full time population of about seven. Other strange aerial lights have been seen in Glen Rose. Lee Roy Gaitan had watched from his Dublin, Texas, home as a disc-shaped object was spinning and as Lee Roy put it, throwing off different colors in the sky. But the most dramatic incidents he described were the close-up encounters of three fellow police officers from Erath County between 7 to 7:30 PM, on January 8, 2008. That was the first well-publicized night that made national and international news after three dozen people reported spinning lights, lights jumping around and even aerial craft seeming to change shapes, morphing in the sky. Lee Roy told me that none of the Erath County police officers would speak on the record because each was afraid of losing his job, or public ridicule, or both. Lee Roy told me he had also heard that “someone” in military authority wanted to see a dash cam video that the Sheriff was holding from one of the officer’s patrol cars. But when Stephenville reporter, Angelia Joiner, finally was given a copy of the alleged dash cam video by the Erath County Sheriff’s office, the tape did not show the dramatic events described by the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"officers. So far no answers to speculation that the original videotape was suppressed. Now, for the first time, I have been able to interview one of those police officers. He still wants to withhold his name to protect his identity and asked me to call him “Greg” for my news report. Here now is Erath County police officer, Greg, describing what he saw with his own eyes in downtown Stephenville, Texas, between 7 PM and 7:30 PM on January 8, 2008. Interview: Police Officer “Greg,” Erath County, Stephenville, Texas: “It was January 8, 2008. I had just come on duty. I work a 12-hour shift from 7 PM to 7 AM. I was driving towards the east on South Loop, which is a loop that loops around the city of Stephenville. I was starting to crest the top of a railroad overpass. As I got to the top of that overpass, it’s raised quite a bit. I can see half the way across town from atop the overpass. I was looking to my left towards downtown and the Erath County Courthouse (100 W. Washington). And I saw a large, rectangular, black object, just slowly moving towards the Courthouse. I saw it for maybe three to four seconds. Then I went down the crest of the hill and I thought to myself that it was a rather large aircraft of some kind. I’ve never seen anything that low moving that slow. It concerned me for a minute. I thought that maybe we have a commercial airliner trying to land at our little airport that can’t support that (an aerial craft so large). So, I went further down the South Loop and got to about Lillian Street and looked towards the Courthouse again. I had a pretty good view. It’s winter. It’s January. There was no foliage on the trees and I saw this large craft hovering above the Courthouse about 200 feet above the ground. O fficer Greg first saw huge craft above Erath County Courthouse in Stephenville (red star) from the intersection of the railroad track and W. South Loop (far left red circle). Greg traveled east past S. Lillian St (2nd red circle) to the city park bridge (3rd red circle) and finally to the intersection of S. Graham Street and South Loop (4th red circle). I went further down to the city park bridge on South Loop. It’s a very large, open area. From there I had an unobstructed view of the Courthouse and there was this craft hovering there. It had two large headlights, like on a car. These headlights were about 35 feet in diameter. The brightness coming off of them was similar to a xenon headlight. Those lights were a couple hundred feet apart. The whole craft from the left to the right – I would call ‘wingtip to wingtip’ – was about 600 feet across. And it looked like it was longer back than that. P rofile of 600-foot-diameter, silent craft hovering over Erath County Courthouse in Stephenville, Texas around 7 PM Central, January 8, 2008. Computer graphic illustration based"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"on eyewitness testimony of three Erath County police officers and provided by officer Greg. HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK THIS CRAFT WAS ABOVE YOU? Above me, I would say 200 feet. SO VE RY CLOSE. And distance away from me, I would say a quarter-mile or less. LOW, A QUARTER-MILE AWAY. YOU ARE JUDGING THIS ENORMOUS SIZE OF 600 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 35-FOOT-DIAMETER HEADLIGHTS COMPARED TO WHAT AROUND YOU GAVE YOU THAT JUDGMENT? The Courthouse itself and the area where it was – I could go back and walk block for block and get a good measurement of the size of the thing. To me, it looked like you could put four or five commercial aircraft wingtip-to-wingtip across the front of it. It was that large! AT THAT POINT, IS IT COMPLETELY STATIONARY? Yes, not moving. I reached over and grabbed my camera. I swiveled the head around and looked in my viewfinder. All I got was washout on the windshield and also the bracing on the window from the hood down to the dashboard was right in the way. I was in the left hand lane, so I couldn’t stop. There were cars behind me and beside me. I really wanted to stop and turn my car towards it and film it, but I couldn’t. It was too dangerous for me to do that. So, I proceeded up to Graham Street and made a left. At Graham Street, when I turned, I’m looking directly at this craft and it starts pivoting upward at a 35 to 40 degree angle off the left ‘wingtip.’ It rises there for about three seconds and then it goes completely 90 degrees and starts moving away from me, all without sound! IF I UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE SAYING THE HUGE AERIAL CRAFT PIVOTED FROM ONE WINGTIP UP 45 DEGREES AND THEN A FULL 90 DEGREES WITHOUT THE WINGTIP POSITION MOVING? Right, without the wing dipping low. 600-foot-diameter, silent craft pivoted on left “wingtip” from horizontal to vertical position over Erath County Courthouse in Stephenville, Texas, between 7 PM to 7:30 PM Central, January 8, 2008. Computer graphic illustration based on eyewitness testimony of three Erath County police officers. INCREDIBLE! Yes! (laughs) And at this point, another light comes on in the center of the craft. So now"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you have instead of the two headlights, you have three identical lights. Then the craft starts pulling away. I reach up and grab my radar, swivel it up into the sky, turned it on and I got a hit. It showed 27 mph and accelerating. It got to about 33 mph and I lost my lock, which meant it was moving so far away I can’t get a good lock on it anymore. At this point, it accelerated very fast. It went all the way across town within two to three seconds. Then it veered to the left in the 90-degree angle, it just veered a little to the left and kept going. It got out of range where I could not see it anymore. At this point, I grabbed my mike and started to call it in and then I realized, ‘How is this going to sound on the radio?’ I’m basically a new officer. I haven’t even worked there a year. I’m still on probation and I didn’t know how my supervisors were going to take it. I knew I was not the only one who saw it. There were people in front of me; there were people behind me. I knew other people had to have seen it. So, I just put the mike back down and didn’t call it in. Later that evening, we met with some other officers in the area and I asked them if they saw this large craft lumbering around town. One of the officers said, ‘No, I didn’t, but Officer Leeroy Gaitan saw something in Gaitan.’ So, that’s when I got hold of Constable Gaitan and we started talking about it. About a week later, I was at work and one of the officers said, ‘Hey, I know you saw something.’ I said, ‘Yeah, I did.’ He said, ‘Well, there are two other officers here who saw it, too.’ So he got me in touch with them and we all met and decided to do our own little investigation. One of the officers was at his house when he witnessed it. The other officer was going home from work. He gets off at 7 PM. He drove directly beneath it and it was about 200 feet off the ground to the south of Stephenville out in the county on a farm on Market Road. The other officer was at home and was in his backyard. He lives up on a ridge. He said the craft was lower than him and down in a valley and it started going up a ridge across from him. 600-foot-diameter craft seen from above by police officer at his ridge top Stephenville, Texas, home. Craft was slowly, silently moving in valley below between 7 PM to 7:30 PM Central, January 8, 2008. Computer graphic illustration of craft from above based on police officer's description. On top of this ridge was a telephone pole and underneath the telephone pole was a pickup truck with its headlights on. As the craft went up the ridge, almost hitting the phone pole. He said the craft just barely cleared it. The big craft went directly over that pickup. We’ve yet to find out who that is, by the way! (laughs) But they had one fantastic view of this craft. That officer saw the top of it and that’s where we got the drawing for the top of the craft. The other officer drove beneath it and that’s where he got the color and what it looked like from underneath in the profile illustration. The officer at his house said he did see what looked to him to be observation windows on the side of the big January 8, 2008, craft (in computer illustration). The officer who drove underneath the huge craft said where I told you it had the two big headlights, he said there were two of those on each side. When I first saw it, it was blacked out. It had some kind of cloaking capability. It was so blacked out that it was darker than the sky around it and gave just a little bit of a silhouette. Also, when I saw the craft, it had two towers on top about 30 to 40 feet tall. The towers had strobe lights on top of them. The towers sporadically strobed. And there were three towers underneath the craft hanging down 30 to 40 feet tall. And they strobed white. Now when I first saw this, the towers were strobing sporadically. Then"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"after a minute, they completely stopped strobing and the only thing you could see was on the very far wingtips, left and right, were two little, steady red lights and in between the big, massive head lights. When it left, you could still see a silhouette as it was leaving in the distance, blacked out more or less. COULD YOU OR THE OTHER TWO OFFICERS HEAR ANYTHING FROM THIS HUGE CRAFT? We heard no noise. I rolled down my car window and I didn’t hear any noise. Of course, I had highway noise around me, but I heard no jet engines, no roar of an airplane engine, nothing like that. The other two officers did not hear any noise either, but they were able to see color. The craft had lit up with color. Also, the officer that drove underneath it was so close, he said it had no rivets, but it had a texture like a large canvas-like texture and an olive green color. NO RIVETS, SOME KIND OF A CANVAS TEXTURE ALL OVER IT AND WAS THE COLOR OF OLIVE DRAB? The color in the graphics I sent you, that is correct (grayish-green). And he said the canvas texture to him appeared to be metallic, a metal with the rough pattern design. IN A RECENT OCTOBER 23, 2008, EMPIRE, OHIO, CASE, A TRUCK DRIVER SAID THE BOTTOM OF A LARGE CRAFT THERE LOOKED LIKE CRACKED OPEN COAL, A CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. I ALSO TALKED WITH A SECURITY GUARD WHO DREW FOR ME WHAT SHE SAW AND IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE CANVAS. AND NOW YOU ARE SAYING THAT ON JANUARY 8, 2008, ABOVE STEPHENVILLE WAS A GIGANTIC CRAFT ALSO WITH A TEXTURED, CANVAS-LIKE SURFACE, BUT METALLIC. Right. No FEMA Or Other Government Inquiry SINCE JANUARY, ALMOST A YEAR LATER, HAVE YOU HAD ANYBODY OFF THE RECORD FROM MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE COME TO TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW? No, nobody has come forward. Nobody has talked to us. I’ve asked why we haven’t sent more officers out to check on these things and I was told, ‘If it’s not a criminal issue, it’s"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"not a high priority for us to look into, but we’ll do what we can.’ NO BRIEFING BY ANYONE WITH YOU ALL IN LAW ENFORCEMENT? No, none. DO YOU FIND THAT STRANGE? I’M ASKING IN THE CONTEXT OF POST-9/11 IN A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING IN THE SKY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A POSSIBLE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO FEMA AND THAT THE CRAFT WAS SO LARGE AND UNIDENTIFIED THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU WHO WERE EYEWITNESSES IN STEPHENVILLE OR DUBLIN ON JANUARY 8, 2008, WOULD BE INTERVIEWED BY TOP AUTHORITIES IN FEMA? Yeah, when you put it that way, that does seem kind of odd. If it is a military experimental craft of some kind, I don’t know why they would be flying it over a populated city. That certainly doesn’t keep it secret anymore. If it’s not military, then it is of some sort of concern. IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET THAT ANY NATION IS MAKING SOMETHING THAT IS 600 FEET IN DIAMETER AND COMPLETELY SILENT AND ABLE TO STAND STILL IN THE AIR? Not that I know of. NOR ME. SO, IT IS TRULY A MYSTERIOUS AERODYNAMIC MYSTERY LET ALONE WHAT IS THE SOURCE? Definitely. November 18, 2008 , 7 PM to 7:30 PM Central - Another Dramatic Stephenville Aerial Encounter Then recently we've had another craft show up. On November 18, 2008, the week before Thanksgiving, and again between 7 PM and 7:30 PM Central, there were around five calls to our local police department. I don’t know how many to the Erath County Sheriff’s Department about this craft. It was seen near Highway 281 and South Loop. B lue-ringed circle at intersection of South Loop and U.S. Highway 281 marks site where couple encountered low-flying, aggressive aerial craft. I was called by an hysterical couple that the craft was following. It tracked along beside them at 70 mph and then pulled in front of their pickup nose down into the road way, just 75 feet off the ground. The female said the bottom of the craft looked silver metallic. She said the spotlight coming off it was so bright she could only see the bottom of the craft. They were so awe-struck and thought it was going to land and they stopped right in the road way and just looked at it. The couple said as it nosed down, it flipped around to the other side of the road. TILTING UP ON ONE TIP AND FLIPPING OVER THE HIGHWAY?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes. The craft then put a spotlight of some kind, a bright light, on the vehicle traveling in front of the couple, which was a couple hundred yards away. That vehicle did not stop. That car continued down the road. So, the couple did not know if that car knew it was being illuminated or whoever was driving just wanted to get out of there! (laughs) The craft then left and went away. The couple called me and were hysterical talking on the phone. I had to ask them to calm down and tell me what they saw. They did and explained they went back to a convenience store at 281 and South Loop in Stephenville, pulled into the drive and got out of their vehicle. A man also pulls into the drive and gets out of his vehicle and said, ‘Can I ask you a question? I’m a private pilot and I just landed at the airport. Did you see something rather large flying through the sky?’ The couple answered, ‘Yes, we did!’ And he said, ‘Well, I did, too!’ They then got back in their pickup and left again to see if they could see it. As they went north toward Granbury, Texas on Highway 377, a couple miles north of Stephenville, the couple sees the lighted craft again. It crosses the road behind them. It stops completely in the air and goes back the other direction within a matter of seconds. The way this thing was flying – you know, there’s nothing we have that can stop and go backwards like that. Shape of Flattened Cigar or Flattened Blimp The couple said it looked something like a blimp. They compared their Nov. 18 sighting to a Tylenol caplet with the top and bottom shaved off a little. Top view of Tylenol caplets. THIS HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICIZED VERY MUCH, HAS IT? No, and I don’t know why it hasn’t. The local Stephenville newspaper did not mention it at all. The couple and a few others talked to MUFON about it. HOW MANY TOTAL EYEWITNESSES? I know of at least five that I know about. I think there might have been a total of about eight to ten at the MUFON meeting. I believe Angelia Joiner did the interviews for MUFON. ANY SKETCHES OR PHOTOS TURNED UP? No, and the couple is still shook up and wants to remain anonymous. The female is the only one who went in to make the report. The male would not even go in (to MUFON meeting). But I did talk to them and verify that’s what they saw. Public Safety Issues I have public safety concerns about both the January 8, and November 18, 2008, incidents. Is there anything chemical, biological or radioactive that we need to worry about? Also, the second sighting seems a little bit more aggressive and that kind of concerns me, too. If this thing is going to chase people and land in the road way ... (laughs) ... it’s starting to be very interesting. AND WHY SUCH AGGRESSION? I don’t know."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Cloaking Versus Aggression That craft I saw in January 2008 had some kind of camouflage cloaking capability. There was one man who I think said he was in downtown Stephenville at the time I was watching and thought he could see through it. Or maybe like it was projecting the sky beneath it? WHAT WOULD BE 600 FEET IN DIAMETER IN THE SKY, FIRST TRYING TO CLOAK ITSELF IN DARKNESS. THEN ALMOST DEMONSTRATING FOR YOU AND THE TWO OTHER POLICE OFFICERS ITS EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO PIVOT ON ONE ‘WINGTIP’ UP 90 DEGREES WITHOUT SOUND. I don’t think it was trying to hide that much. I think it did want to be seen. The November object seemed more aggressive and was smaller and differently shaped than the January craft. Speculations About Source of Craft HAVE YOU HAD ANY MEETING WITH AUTHORITIES ABOUT WHY THE THESE CRAFT HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE STEPHENVILLE REGION? We’ve all wondered why it’s occurring around here. A lot of the officers think it’s some kind of military craft. BUT, GREG, HOW DO YOU GET TO OUR MILITARY FROM SOMETHING THAT IS 600 FEET IN DIAMETER, COMPLETELY SILENT, CAN STOP AND HOLD ITS POSITION IN THE AIR, CHANGE ITS HORIZONTAL POSITION RAPIDLY TO VERTICAL AND MAKE NO SOUND? I don’t see how that is possible. The officer who was in his back yard at home at the time on January 8, 2008, he is retired U. S. Air Force and he was adamant it is not USAF. WHAT RUNS THROUGH YOUR MIND ABOUT WHAT ELSE IT COULD BE? I’m just speculating, but it could be an unmanned probe. It could be from the future. It could be alien in nature. IF IT WERE A PROBE, IT WOULD BE FROM WHERE? Not from this planet! I think it’s an extraordinary world event. I think since we’ve had two sightings within a year that I know of that it’s almost like it’s building up to something. Like there is something even bigger coming, maybe even contact.” I f anyone has more information about the January and November 2008 craft sightings in the Stephenville, Texas, region - or other aerial phenomena elsewhere in the United States and world, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
