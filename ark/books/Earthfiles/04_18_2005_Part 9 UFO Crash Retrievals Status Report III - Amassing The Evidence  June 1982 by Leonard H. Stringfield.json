The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: CASE B-8: 1979, Autopsy of Humanoids Allegedly, UFO affairs involving the United States and many world governments are of the highest degree of secrecy. If my 'insiders,' both here and abroad are correct, there is a high level international exchange of UFO data and a cooperative contingency plan for alien craft retrieval. I have been told on good authority that countries in NATO have close Intelligence ties as does the U. S. with Australia and New Zealand, and some countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Some insiders even believe that Russia, and more recently, the Peoples Republic of China, share a close detente on UFO matters. But, except for the sensational 'stuff' which gets top billing in some tabloids, precious little of the real tactical or scientific data leak out to trickle down to the researcher. Although stories of crashed alien craft surface from distant lands from time to time, the stories of recovered occupants are rare. Thanks to a new French connection, maybe there is light in the end of the international tunnel. Word about an alleged French medical consultation, involving a post mortem evaluation of two cadavers in the United States came by letter from Jean Sider of Clichy, France, on April 17, 1980. In this letter he referred me to Dr. John Gille of Paris, with credentials in the Centre National De Richerche Scientific (National Scientific Research Center), an equivalent to NASA. Dr. Gille's response to my request for information came by letter dated May 7, 1980, as follows: 'Dear Mr. Stringfield, ...I had decided to write to you before receiving your kind letter of April 28, 1980. I got a copy of Situation Red (© 1978 by Leonard H. Stringfield.) For me, it was a nice breath of fresh air in the somehow dreary field of Ufology. Of course, I knew of some UFO crash/retrieval affairs and I began to investigate one. Here follows a summary of what I know about that affair: In the spring 1978, I met Jean-Charles Fumoux, then chairman of a little UFO association, the A. D. E. P. S., in the south of France. What led me to this group was the desire to meet a certain Francois Gardes - alias Julien -- a former member of the French Intelligence community and a former chairman of ADEPS. I had concluded at that time that all important and sensitive information about UFOs, at least available, were in the possession of members of Intelligence agencies. Turning back to Fumoux, he told me some anecdotes of very high strangeness level. The one "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"which involved two UFOs that crashed into a marsh seemed to me the most easily checkable and is summarized in the 5 pages I enclose, a photocopy of the French original account, typed by Fumoux. Months afterward, I succeeded to get from Fumoux the name - and later, the way to get the address of the 'professor' who caught a glimpse of the deceased aliens. He was a Mr. Leon Visse living at St. Pourcain-sur-Sioule (a village near the little city of Moulins in the French department of Allier). The person who gave me the address of Visse was his employer, the Director of the College Notre-Dame in Moulins, a secondary school of denominational nature. Visse gave me an appointment and I met him at his home February 6, 1979. He is a man between 50 and 60, the appearance of a country doctor. I explained the aim of my visit - his involvement in a humanoid's autopsy affair. He denied all at once, but failed to show any sign of amazement. 'I never had any participation in any humanoid's autopsy affair,' he said very quietly. 'Nevertheless, what you just told me (I had given him a sketchy account of the Fumoux story) is perfectly true. Only a biologist of really big caliber could imagine a description of the body of an extraterrestrial alien which so accurately fits with the great principles of modern biology and exobiology.' 'This sober description contains an interesting detail,' said Visse. 'The alleged fact was that alien bodies exhibited a much more developed lymphatic system than the standard human body. Never would a medical student be able to fantasize such a trick.' Mr. Visse went on for a long time explaining to me that hyper-development of the lymphatic system would be hypothetically normal for interstellar travelers. An effective antigenic system was duly needed to avoid possible diseases produced by microorganisms which are said to infest areas in the galaxy. On the other hand, he said, very few muscular needs were to be expected for individuals belonging to space civilizations. Therefore, a diminished cardiovascular system which was precisely what the alien bodies showed. Mr. Visse made the point that dredging of the bottom of the seas was given up a few years ago, both by the U. S. A. and the soviet Union. The cause of that would be the risk that an unknown virus would be brought up to the surface, providing occasions for it to wipe out the whole of mankind. I reminded him about The Andromeda Strain by Michael Crichton, a so-called fictional book. He agreed that such books or movies were devised as a covert warning. Mr. Visse concluded with these words: 'Your informant protected himself giving my name. To hide his actual source, he cited me, thinking you would never reach me.' Visse told me to go to survivors of the French team, which won the Nobel Prize in 1965. [ Editor's Note: The 1965 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded \"for their discoveries concerning genetic control of enzyme and virus synthesis\" to Francois Jacob, M. D. and Ph.D., Andre Lwoff, M. D. and Ph.D., and Jacques Monod, Ph.D., all from the Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.] I met Prof. Andre Lwoff on 10.25.79, at his office at the Institute Pasteur in Paris. He ousted me quickly, saying he was aware of nothing concerning this affair and that, of course, flying saucers do not exist and were only swamp gas, meteorological balloons, misinterpretations and hoaxes. He said Prof. (Edward) Condon proved this. So, I was led to a dead end. I got no more information. Visse never sent me the documents he promised me. I saw Fumoux again several times and he swore to me that Visse was indeed the real man. I knew Fumoux was a former Air Force officer and that he had connections at that time - and maybe still - with Intelligence circles. He also told me two or three interesting UFO C/R stories.' Leonard H. Stringfield: \"Next, I met Dr. Gille in Houston at the MUFON Symposium in June 1980, where we tried to find the time and place to talk privately, but circumstances prevented an adequate discussion. Time passed and when it became known that I was preparing my third monograph on UFO Crash/Retrievals, I heard from the scientist again by phone, followed"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"by a letter. His letter of November 20, 1981, said in part: 'I am preparing a comparative report about the variations in Fumoux's testimony, which in my opinion, serve as a contrived method he used to tell a genuine fact.' Enclosed was a section of J. C. Fumoux's recent book, Preuves Scientifiques OVNI (published in Monaco in 1981), which he had translated for my review. It is quoted in part as follows: Excerpt from Preuves Scientifiques OVNI © 1981 by J. C. Fumoux: '...the other accounts quoted by Leonard Stringfield come from military officers who were on duty at Wright-Patterson, or from civilians under military contract at this base. Now, more and more American scientists maintain that they have been appointed by military authority to perform biological analysis or anatomical studies on humanoid bodies. What a coincidence, the name 'Wright-Patterson' crops up in their remarks. This confirms what a French scientist, Mr. L. ..., a world famous biologist, says. He admitted in 1969 to have been dispatched by the American government to Wright-Patterson to carry out precise experiments. This professor, a former colleague of Lwoff, Monod and Jacob, Nobel Prize winners in 1965, and a Professor at College de France, told his adventure to a group of students in 1969. During the year 1959, he received an invitation from an American scientific organization for a three months lecture tour in the American universities. The subject for these lectures was histons (which are special elements connected to cellular genetic material). In this particular field of research, this professor was among the world's number ones. A short time after his lecture, he was asked if he would perform an experiment about histonic weight on particular cells. Computation of histonic weight was precisely the field he knew best, so he eagerly accepted the job. An appointment was scheduled. A few days later, an American scientist, who was also a biologist with whom he kept correspondence by mail for many years, came to pick him up. They took the shuttle USAF plane and wound up at Wright-Paterson AFB. Of course, the French professor was very surprised to wind up inside a military compound. But he began his work, having all the necessary equipment made available to him and rallied around by three assistants who knew their job well. In his first test, he found a ridiculously low histonic weight, much lower than human cells, which looked impossible to him. It had to be one thing or the other: either he was wrong with his experiments or genetic theories about histons had to be entirely revised. [ Editor's Note: Histons and DNA are found in the cell nucleus. DNA is a double stranded structure built up by many millions of nucleotides. DNA is twisted around proteins named Histons which act as spools around which DNA winds and they play a role in gene regulation. Histones are found in the nuclei of eukaryotic cells.There are 5 different types of Histons.] Logically, he chose the first hypothesis and decided to do his experiments again. After awhile, he got the same results and asked to be allowed to look at the organism from which the cells came. His request was of the utmost importance. If not, he would have to go over again all the studies he had run for years. Was it a particular virus? Whatever the case, the soundest theories were to be revised and the most important genetic works were challenged. Twin Humanoids, Long Blond Hair To his surprise, he was taken into a special room where he could leisurely study the corpses of two humanoids. They were very ta ll (2.3 meters or so, or 7 feet 3 inches) and bore hideous mutilations on their bodies, as if they had been the victims of a road accident! The heads of these two creatures were intact. The forehead high and broad. Very long blond hair. The eyes were stretched towards the temples which gave them an Asiatic look. The nose and the mouth were small. The lips were thin, perfectly delineated. The chin was small and slightly pointed. the two faces were beardless. Despite slight differences in their facial appearances, the two humanoids looked like twins. Other facts as well puzzled him. The corpses had stayed in formalin. Nevertheless, they remained perfectly white. They did not have keratin granules which allow the human being to get a tan on summer days. He was also allowed to study the other"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"aspects of the two beings' physiology and to note that their lymphatic system was dominating and virtually had taken the place of their blood system. The eyes of these creatures were of a very light blue shade and did not look different from ours. The hands, although slender, were very human-like. On the other end, their toes were very small and their feet absolutely flat. In the course of this appraisal, his American colleague drew his attention to some details which had gone unnoticed. Then he explained that the humanoids were of extraterrestrial origin. Though he was appalled to have seen two beings belonging to another world, the French professor was more relieved to note that his genetic theories were not challenged and his twenty years of research did not end in failure. Before leaving Wright-Patterson, two members of the American security services made him swear to secrecy for ten years and he kept his word. His journey back to France took place without troubles and he quietly carried on his research work at his Paris laboratory. The department in Wright-Patterson where the two humanoid corpses rested at the end of the year 1959 was named FTD (TDETR). I have to confess that I have hesitated a long time before publishing this amazing story which, I don't doubt, will bring down all the French scientists' wrath upon me and particularly from those who work in our official G.E.P.A.N (Groupe d'Etudes des Phenomenes Aerospatiaux Non-identifies, Study Group for Unidentified Aerospace Phenomena, established in Toulouse, France in 1977; director was Dr. Claude Poher.) But I did it because I have been granted the French scientist's permission, providing I don't name him.'\" Continued in Part 10 - More about the autopsy story.
