E ast of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Route 22 William Penn Highway is the pastoral town of Murrysville southwest of the Beaver Run Reservoir. Since June of 2008, Alison Kruse, her daughter and others have repeatedly seen unidentified aerial lights and occasionally beams shining down into trees near abandoned coal mines. November 25, 2009 Murrysville, Pennsylvania - Alison Kruse, 47, is the owner of a construction site development company in the Murrysville, Pennsylvania, region about 20 miles east of Pittsburgh. Her home is about a quarter mile from old abandoned coal mines that give off radon gas from uranium decay and often the family hears low frequency hums that are sometimes loud enough to vibrate inside their heads. The hums seem to come from underground. Since August 2009, Alison, her daughter and others have seen amber-gold orbs, “like mini-suns,” or white balls of light going in and out of woods near the abandoned coal "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mines about 700 feet from the Kruse home. The unusual aerial phenomena, including large aerial triangles similar to the Belgium triangular UFOs of the early 1990s, are so frequent that in the 2009 summer, Alison purchased a $323 Clover HDC-501 “military grade” IR vari-focus, Color Day/Night 5mm-50mm security camera to put in various positions on her roof. Alison also purchased a $1400 Sony HDR-VR500 HD digital camcorder attached to a $3,300 ATN NVM14-3A Generation 3 Nightvision scope with a 5X zoom lens.

Recently, I interviewed Alison about how the aerial light phenomena started back in June 2008, and a dramatic video file she captured on October 10, 2009, of a bright sphere of light emitting a strong beam down into the woods. Interview: Alison Kruse, Owner, construction site development company, region of Murrysville and Export, Pennsylvania: “On June 16, 2008, my daughter had been on the phone late at night with a friend and in the morning she told me, ‘Mom, there was this really weird plane last night – really weird! It was glowing.’ I asked, ‘What do you mean it was glowing?’ She said, ‘It was glowing red like this,’ and she made a motion with her hands like it was pulsing. I said, ‘That doesn’t sound like a plane.’"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"And she said, ‘No, Jake (boyfriend on phone call) didn’t think so either. He said it was a UFO.’ So, I had her draw it and she drew a classic disc-shape with a row of chasing white lights back and forth on the bottom, like strobing back and forth, back and forth. And it was down below the treeline and she said, ‘It stopped over Holly’s house.’ That’s a pretty big house down in the bottom of the valley. It stopped over that house for a little while and then took off real fast. The direction she pointed to was towards Delmont, Pennsylvania (east of Export on above map). I asked, ‘Did Jake see it?’ She said, ‘Yes, he saw seven red lights in the sky out his window and he ducked down because he was scared.’ SO YOU DECIDED TO GO GET A NIGHTWATCH CAMERA? I just did that in June of this year, 2009. But a year ago on October 21, 2008, I saw two bright, shining, diamond-like, large lights - like very bright, shining stars. I’m staring at them outdoors while I'm grilling burgers and there are sparkly colors like a really good diamond. I’m staring because I’d been in the astronomy club and we go sit on lawn chairs at 3 AM trying to catch a meteor shower. So, I’m scratching my head because I would think I’d know what two bright stars were. I knew that Jupiter and Venus were not going to be in conjunction for another month. So, they were immediately ruled out, but it looked as if Jupiter and Venus were next to each other, but sparkling like diamonds. And then the smaller light dimmed out and then the larger one dims out. I was like, ‘Oh, my God! I think I just saw a UFO!’ When I told my fiance about it, he said, ‘Oh, I forgot to tell you when I was coming home on the turnpike, I saw a thing that looked like a comet go straight across over the highway, stop and do a right angle turn away from me.’ I’m like, ‘How could you forget to tell me that?!’ He said, ‘Well, you were asleep when I came home.’ December 7, 2008 Huge Cigar-Shaped Aerial Craft Then nothing happened until December 7, 2008. The girls were sled riding in the yard. It was about 16 degrees Fahrenheit. They come running to the patio door banging on the glass, both of them, ‘Mom, a giant UFO!’ I ran outside with my slippers on. There’s snow on the ground obviously and by the time I get out there, the sky thing is gone. I had the girls come in and draw pictures sitting at two tables far apart from each other so they couldn’t look at each other’s sketches. They both drew a real long, cigar-shaped UFO. They said there was a white dot in the middle of it and a white dot traveling above it that was not attached, a row of red lights or windows, and it was huge. The girls said if their arms were extended, the length of the cigar-shaped object would be equal to their hands separated by four inches. A lison's daughter was 12-years-old on December 7, 2008, when she drew this sketch to show her mother what she and her friend had seen in the sky while sledding in the yard.

The ceilings are 16 feet high and it’s all glass on the side that faces the woods, floor-to-ceiling glass, 25 feet long.

I had assumed that you see as UFO and it’s a once-in-a-lifetime thing and you might never see one again. So when this sky events started happening pretty regularly around here, I bought the good camera because I said I wasn’t going to report anything until I had visual proof. October 10, 2009 Light Emits Beam Down into Woods YOU HAVE BEEN VIDEOTAPING PRETTY STEADILY SINCE MAY TO OCTOBER 2009. TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 10. There is an unfinished part of the golf course on the opposite side of the woods. These woods surround that and then there is a part that’s a green way that is owned by the county. I drove onto the top of a nearby farm field because it’s a high point in the area to watch the activity better. Before at that spot, I've filmed plasma-type lights coming out of the trees that rise up and morph into what is supposed to fool the eye into thinking they are ordinary human airplanes with running lights. I have also filmed the steady burning ‘orb/spheres.’ Sometimes they forget to leave the lights on just turn on the white flashing strobes with no navigation red/green lights. They only start out being about 2-3 feet in diameter, which you can see above the head of a local Constable who came to check out all the light activity in the woods. See: Alien Hunting part 6/8 video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dB9-B-Tf0 . The combination of small size and dim lights when starting out fools the eye into thinking they're farther away. But surrounding the woods busted them. MIMICKING AIRPLANES? Mimicking airplanes. ON OCTOBER 10, 2009, WHAT HAPPENED? I’d already videotaped several lights coming out of the woods. Not just those woods, but out of other patches of woods in the area and about 20 miles away over Oakmont, Pennsylvania. I had read online that in order to get good images, you need at least a generation 3 or 4 nightvision scope, so that’s what I bought and attached it to my HD camera. That was the first night I tried using it. OCTOBER 10, 2009? Yes. I got a couple of other objects and you have to play around with focusing because you have to focus the camera, focus the scope and focus the magnifier lens. It has a 5X magnifier on it. The whole thing weighs about 15 pounds. I had it on a tripod that night. It was a cold night and I had the car running with the heater on next to me about 4 to 5 feet from where I was standing with the camera on the tripod."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HOW DID YOU CAPTURE THE BEAM? It was just another low-flying object that came out of the woods. When you see on your security camera at home night after night round balls of light moving through the treetops and then see them rise above the trees, hover for awhile and then turn on these flashing lights, you get curious about what they are when they fly over your house and they are completely silent. If any other manmade thing flies over, you can hear it coming a mile down the road and it shakes your walls. So, when there is a low-flying light, you start paying attention to it! These star-like whatever – I don’t know if it’s a mothership spitting out the ‘kids at the pool?’ (laughs) Or is it a vortex type thing opening up? I've seen star-like objects that are bright and then shrink down to hardly any light and then Poof! It pops a little light out and then another one comes out. ON OCTOBER 10, WHAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION? The best vantage point to view these things when they pop out of the woods is the farm field across the street from my house, which puts it about 1200 feet from the woods. And when you see the lights rise up from the woods that catches your attention! THAT NIGHT YOU HAVE A TRIPOD OUT THERE AND YOUR NEW STAR SCOPE AND THE HD CAMERA OUT IN THE FIELD TRYING TO USE THE EQUIPMENT. WHAT ATTRACTED YOUR ATTENTION THAT MADE YOU START VIDEOTAPING? If you watch the videotape, I caught it from – there were several of them flying around. I hoped they would fly over the top of me so I could get a good outline shape of it. That’s what I was trying to achieve. What happened is that it was just another light that came up. I have footage of others before this one. BUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS ONE? Well, this one as it went past, all of a sudden I noticed in the lower part of the little LCD screen – it took me awhile to realize there was a beam coming out of the tree at the bottom. I immediately thought it was some type of search beam. I didn’t hear any zapping sounds, no crackling, nothing coming from it except fake plane flashing in the sky and no sound from it at all. My car was running, but if it had been a plane it would have been about 700 feet from me at that point (I measured the distance later). And I, of course, would have heard a man-made craft if it was one at that short of distance. THE LIGHT MOVES ALONG SOME DISTANCE WITH THE BEAM COMING DOWN. The beam looks like it is shining through an opening in the branches of the tree. If you look at the blow-up images frame by frame, the beam looks like it is shining through spaces of the trees, not hitting the leaves. And notice the frame-by-frame shows the beam is being bent by my car's windshield, indicating it is not a lens flare.

And that might have been what made the vapor-type smoke that is wafting past the tree afterwards. I went and looked in the daytime and there are some brown leaves, but nothing that looked curled or burned. NO, IT LOOKS MORE LIKE FALL. Yeah, like fall brown patches here and there. Nothing smelled burned. THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST BEAM COMING FROM ONE OF THE MOVING AERIAL LIGHTS OUT OF THE WOODS. Ye s . TO YOUR EYES AWAY FROM THE NIGHTVISION GREEN, WHAT COLOR ARE THE LIGHTS USUALLY IN THE WOODS? An amber, orange or gold color. They glow big like a mini-sun sometimes, but the smaller ones stay more white and you only see a faint, fast white streak a 100 feet or so up in the air, then instant white-strobe flashing. The big ones are the ones I see morphing. THE LIGHT ON OCTOBER 10 WITH THE BEAM, DID YOU SEE THAT WITH YOUR EYE? That was a whiter-yellow color. WAS THE BEAM WHITE-YELLOW?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The beam – I have no idea about the color of the beam because I was more worried about keeping the shot in focus and I didn’t glance up when the beam was coming down in my frame. And I don’t know what to make of all this before this spring because I didn’t know UFOs would mimic planes and helicopters. Now several other people online are reporting and/or filming similar UFOs pretending to be ordinary human planes and helicopters - all over the world in such places as Argentina, Brazil, Russia, UK, Canada, and Australia. From what I’m seeing, lights are flying around like they are sightseeing. I'm pretty sure their method of arrival is dropping the balls of energies into the trees, which I've caught on surveillance cam and in the nightvision scope. They look like meteors without trails that hang around in the trees until take off. Do they gather stuff like radon gas or the uranium deposits it comes from? Or are they sucking electricity from powerlines right near the woods? All I know is, my surveillance cam catches the lights leaving the same way they came by zipping right back up into the sky, like a meteor falling in reverse. I also notice the lights don't seem to like rainy weather. The best night for watching them always seems to be the next clear weather night after many days of rainy weather. AND WHY THE BEAM? Yeah, what’s the beam doing there? There’s an old coal mine underneath where that beam hit. There’s just an old stone opening to it. I wonder if a tunnel goes underneath there and that UFO thing was maybe searching for that tunnel? That’s the only thing I can think of – that maybe it was looking into the ground and the hollow space that’s probably there. November 18, 2009, Mimicking Airplane Lights and Sound © 2009 Alison Kruse. When I was up on my roof changing the filming angle of my Clover surveillance camera, to my left in the trees I saw an orange/amber ‘mini sun’ hanging out. So, I got off the roof, grabbed my Sony camcorder (with 12X optical zoom w/1.7X teleconversion lens only) and started to film the aerial light. It was headed slowly (like 20 miles an hour) over the edge of my property from east to west approximately. It had the initial look of two, white, steady, far-apart headlights with two alternating red lights in between. The video frames show the object/s as it came closer and flew over while it jutted out additional parts with lights on the ends - I think to try and mimic our aircraft. I've even filmed one unfolding its ‘fake wing.’"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"V ideo frames on November 18, 2009, in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, on Sony camcorder with 12X optical zoom w/1.7X teleconversion lens only. “This object turned on a rather low-volume jet engine noise.” Video © 2009 by Alison Kruse. Then this object turned on a rather low-volume jet engine noise. I found this funny as I filmed a similar mimicking object rising out of woods over Duff's Park high on a steep hill with three others on September 25, 2009. That September 25, 2009, object hovered over Murrysville and traveled at approximately 20 miles per hour out of town, using what sounded like a small Cessna-type engine. In both instances of the aerial lights mimicking human airplanes, the green right side navigation light was left out.
