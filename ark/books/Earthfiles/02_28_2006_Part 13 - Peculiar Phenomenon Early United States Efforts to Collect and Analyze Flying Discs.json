Andrew Kissner R eturn to Part 1 Jerome C. Hunsaker (MJ-7) Appealed to Congress For \"Aerial Weapons Research Funds\" F ive people were killed on June 11, 1947, when an Argentine four engine \"Lancastrian\" airliner coming in for a landing miscalculated its altitude, struck a post supporting the air field's radio antenna, crashed and burst into flames. That same day, nine B-29 bombers from the 43rd Bombing Group at Davis-Monthan Field in Tucson, Arizona, dropped 500-pound bombs at WSPG. Antiaircraft artillery demonstrated their guns for not only the 300 West Point cadets, but also for two visiting Mexican generals invited by General Homer. The Commanding General of the Juarez Garrison was the same general involved in providing security in Juarez, Mexico at the \"V-2\"/Hermes crash site on May 29. No reporters were allowed to go with the group to the demonstrations. [ The New York Times , June 12, 1947, p. 13; El Paso Times , June 6, 1947.] On June 13, 1947, Jerome C. Hunsaker, (MJ-7), Chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NACA), appeared before the House Appropriations Committee and demanded an immediate 30% increase to $43,449,000 for his committee's budget in the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1947. NACA was established on March 3, 1915, \"to supervise and direct the scientific study of the problems of flight, with a view of their practical solution and to direct and conduct research and experimentation in aeronautics.\" NACA is the predecessor to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration created in 1957. Jerome Clark Hunsaker, Ph.D., also served as chairman of the Aeronautical Engineering Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Husaker's request for more funding came after a previous supplemental funding request on February 6, 1947, for $7.5 million. Of that amount, $5.8 million was for construction at test facilities in Langley Field, Virginia, and $1.7 million was for construction at Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio. The supplemental appropriation was required due to a \"cooperative agreement with the Army Air Forces in a project for flight testing a transonic research airplane at Muroc Lake, California.\" [ Las Cruces Sun-News , June 13, 1947; Communication from the President of the United States, Transmitting a Proposed Provision to An Existing Appropriation for the Fiscal Year 1947 ... In the Amount of $7,749,000 for the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (House of Representatives, 80th Congress, 1st Session, Document No. 95, February 6, 1947). In his June appearance, Dr. Hunsaker's testimony centered on the U. S. need to maintain air superiority in the face of rapidly developing technology. \"It is possible,\" he said, \"that if we don't maintain air superiority, a foe might jump at us.\" During the course of his testimony, reporters in the congressional hearing room were treated to a classified briefing in open session. They reported that Dr. Hunsaker became so animated, and what he said \"was so secret that it had to be stricken from the public record.\" It is fortunate that the meeting was open and that reporters were present since this was the only record of the 1948 NACA budget. But the Congressional records for June 1947 do not reference Dr. Hunsaker's testimony, let alone what was stricken from the record. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"F ront P age, Las Cruces Sun-News, June 13, 1947. In his June request, Dr. Hunsaker also proposed a change in the membership of his board of directors to \"Promote the National Defense by increasing the membership of NACA.\" Director Hunsaker proposed to expand the NACA board to seventeen members from an existing fifteen. One of the two new members of the NACA board, a member that from this point on would perpetually serve, was the Chairman of the Joint Research and Development Board of the Joint Chiers of Staff and OSRD Director: Vannevar Bush, Ph.D. (MJ-2). \"The Chairman of the Research and Development Board of the National Military Establishment is added as a member to be appointed by the President. Since the Chairman of the Research and Development Board is charged with the coordination of all research of the armed services, including aeronautical and guided or flying missile research for which the NACA is charged with the basic research, it would appear appropriate that he should automatically be a member of the Committee.\" [ Ibid.] NACA's old board included two members from the War Department, Office of Military Aeronautics; two members of the Navy Department, Office of Naval Aeronautics; two members of the Civil Aeronautics Authority; one member from Smithsonian Institution; one member United States Bureau of Standards; one member of the United States Weather Bureau; six members acquainted with aeronautical science, either civil or military or skilled in aeronautical engineering or its allied sciences. [ Ibid, P. 3.] The primary objective served by Senate Bill 1571 of the 80th Congress was to position Dr. Bush (MJ-2) on Dr. Jerome Hunsaker's (MJ-7) NACA board, even after Dr. Bush had served as chairman of the organization in 1939. In a resolution adopted by NACA on June 5, 1947, Dr. Bush's position was incorporated into the NACA's organizational structure. But the new bill, S-1571, did more. It specified which laboratories NACA controlled - by name. It is not clear if this was necessary to clean up NACA's explicit authority, which was mentioned in Congressional testimony? Or if it was an attempt to either limit or broaden NACA's jurisdiction related to high-altitude aerospace research in the United States? Dr. Hunsaker said in his letter to Senate President pro tempore, Arthur H. Vandenberg ( General Hoyt Vandenberg's uncle (MJ-4): \"...additional scientific members, free of governmental or industrial connections, are needed to help the additioinal work load and to provide additional potential chairmen.\" [ Ibid. P. 4.] The initiative to \"Promote the National Defense by increasing the membership of NACA\" was presented less than three weeks after a V-2 went off course in southern New Mexico, and one week after the U. S. Army shot something down at very high altitude above Juarez, Mexico. It occurred during a period in U. S. history when the challenges of aeronautical flight were obvious. Perhaps this activity simply related to the need for the U. S. to develop jet aircraft and ballistic missiles. But I doubt that was the only reason because the timing of the \"peculiar phenomenon\" interfering with the V-2 rocket research and Dr. Husker's request for more \"Aerial Weapons Research Funds\" is more than coincidental. Atomic Energy Commission Also Asked For More Money The Atomic Energy Commission appeared before the House Appropriations Committee on June 13, 1947. Congressional committee members recommended that the AEC be given $175 million of its $250 million request until such time as the Commission \"can tell Congress how it plans to spend its money and how many people are on its payroll.\" The AEC was invited to come back \"once they get their figures straight.\" AEC representatives testified during the hearing that 50% of its aircraft were obsolete due to \"startling improvements in process.\" [ Ibid.] In 1955, Dr. Hugh L. Dryden, then Chairman of NACA, joined Brig. General Donald J. Keirn of the AEC before a subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee in support of NACA's construction budget request for the new 1956 fiscal year. Dr. Dryden saved what he considered to be the most important priority in his budget for last. Hugh Dryden: \"It may come as a surprise to the committee that the NACA does have responsibilities in this field and that we have been working in the field of nuclear propulsion for some time. \"This relationship between the AEC and NACA began nine years ago when the chief of research in our flight propulsion laboratory served as a consultant to the AEC's NEPA project. ...At a later stage there was a Lexington Project, which went into this subject."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"In 1947, a working agreement was signed between the chief of one of the AEC laboratories and myself which provided for a very limited exchange of personnel. ...The scope of this agreement has been extended from time to time. At present, it is between the general manager of the AEC and myself. ...It includes some work related to weapons as well as nuclear power for aircraft.\" [ Hearing Before the Subcommittee of the Comm ittee of Armed Services, United States Senate, 84th Congress, First Session, on H. R. 2581 (H. R. 3761) , (U. S. Government Printing Office, March 15, 19595) p. 10-11.] [ Editor's Note: Dr. Hugh Latimer Dryden, was Director of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) from 1947 until the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1956, and was named Deputy Administrator of the new aerospace agency when it was created in response to the Sputnik crisis. Before that time he was Associate Director of the National Bureau of Standards, where he had served since 1918 in scientific research. He died in 1965.] Senator Stennis told Dr. Dryden: \"Pardon me just a minute, gentlemen. You seem to have a rather firm formal understanding to start with.\" Dr. Dryden told the Senate that NACA and the AEC in 1947 had established a working relationship related to nuclear propulsion. That agreement was nine years before such an alliance was disclosed to the U. S. Senate subcommittee. Why hadn't the information been provided earlier? June 13, 1947 Congress was busy on June 13, 1947. The War Department announced that it had received funding for 75 new \"instrument stations\" that would be installed immediately at WSPG over the entire length of the range. \"These will be installed to chart the speed, trajectory, range and other characteristics of guided missiles.\" [ Ibid.] In Cleveland, Ohio, five people escaped serious injury on Lakeshore Boulevard when a plane smashed in the top of a car, struck telephone wires and dropped to the ground. Edward Feactu told sheriff's deputies that when he was taking off from a local airport a sudden wind shift caused the plane to drop on top of the car. He had failed to gain altitude at take off. [ The New York Times , June 14, 1947, p. 17.] Also on Friday, June 13, a Pennsylvania Central DC-4 slammed into a ridge near Leesburg, Virginia. Fifty people were killed and it became the second largest airplane disaster in U. S. history, after the May 30, 1947, DC-4 accident near Aberdeen Proving Ground. Eyewitnesses said that the airplane narrowly missed clearing the ridge. When the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigators recovered the instrument panel from the aircraft, the altimeter was stuck at 2,000 feet, an altitude that would have been sufficient to clear the ridge by 500 to 600 feet. [ El Paso Times , June 16, 1947; Las Cruces Sun-News , June 18, 1947.] On June 15, 1947, The New York Times reported: \"Gordon O. Stone of the American Red Cross in Washington, D. C., was with the party and reported that parts of the plane and bodies of the victims were strewn across a 100-yard stretch near the top of a 1,500-foot mountain in the Blue Ridge Range. The crash took place 100 yards down the western slope of the ridge ... along the famous Appalachian Trail.\" On June 14, James A. Landis, Chairman of the CAB, reported that after several meetings with Presidential Assi stant John R. Steel man and \"others\" at the Whi te House, the CAB had no intenti on of groundi ng al l DC-4s (C-54s). John Steelman was assigned by President Truman to chair the Interdepartmental Committee for Scientific Research and Development on December 24, 1947. The committee coordinated all federal scientific activities in the published literature. However, no mention of this is made in the scientific literature of the era. In 1948, John Steelman was appointed Chairman of the National Defense Resources Board, an organization established to coordinate U. S. industrial involvement in weapons research, development and production by President Truman. Mr. Landis mentioned that 30% of all U. S. commercial airliners operate DC -4s and the largest part of these were converted military C-54s. Landis pointed out that the DC-4s involved in the accidents were of different versions - all had different engines and he said that there was no obvious connection between the three accidents that by themselves had killed 146 people over 15 days. An unidentified \"high government official\" at the White House said after the meeting that \"there is something radically wrong.\" [ El Paso Times , June 15, 1947.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F ront Page, The New York Times, June 15, 1947.
