Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon A Search for Earth's First Life © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe Bedrock on Akilia Island, Greenland is some of the oldest from the young earth's surface 4 b illion years ago. October 1, 2000 Los Angeles, California - Geologists recently announced the discovery of the oldest known life in earth rock on Akilia Island, Greenland not far from the capitol, Nuuk. That early carbon trace indicative of metabolic processes is probably residue from microbes such as bacteria. The strange truth is that all the oldest sedimentary rocks found so far have evidence of life in them. No one has yet found a sedimentary rock devoid of carbon traces. So, when exactly did life begin on Earth? One scientist trying to answer that question is Dr. Stephen Mojzsis (MOY-zish), a geologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Mojzsis found a sedimentary rock in Greenland that's nearly 4 billion years old and contains the carbon residue of ancient life. Our Solar System is only four and a half billion years old. How does he know the rock's carbon was linked to living organisms? There are three isotopes of carbon: Carbon 12, 13 and radioactive 14. Dr. Mojzsis says that when the relative abundance of Carbon 12 is much higher than Carbon 13, it indicates the carbon has been processed in the metabolism of living creatures. Interview: Stephen Mojzsis, Ph.D., Professor of Geology, University of California, Los Angeles: \"There is no other process known on the Earth that can cause this kind of signature, a signature that is unique to life. Now, these rocks, if they had little fossils in them, those fossils have long since been destroyed because they are fragile shapes. So, instead what you use is a reliable chemical indicator of past life. If I was to find a piece of carbon in there that didn't have this chemical signature, I couldn't tell you either way. So it has to pass through a number of tests before we are convinced that this can only be explained by metabolic processes. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"And that's what we've done with these rocks from Greenland. And subsequent to this work, other people have gone up there and found many other rocks with similar signatures of different ages. Certainly life was pervasive on earth's surface 3.8 to 3.9 billion years ago. WERE YOU YOURSELF SURPRISED THAT YOU HAVE FOUND EVIDENCE IN GREENLAND OF MICROORGANISMS THAT GO BACK ALMOST 4 BILLION YEARS? You know something. In hind sight, no. At the time, I must admit we were disappointed. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? We were hoping that we could get so far back in time that we were at the time of pre-life before life on earth. That would be an even more interesting result because then we would be able to bracket time between which life and non-life were on this planet. BUT ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YOU HAVE YET TO FIND A LAYER THAT DOES NOT HAVE SOME KIND OF MICROORGANISM CARBON TRACE IN IT? We have yet to find rocks on the planet earth, rocks that are sediments - water-laid rocks, rocks formed in water under conditions wherein life could also have been present. We have yet to find ancient sediments on the Earth that do not contain some trace of past life, even in the oldest sediments. So, this tells us something. This tells us that one, during this period of Earth's history 3.9 billion years ago when the moon was being bombarded and the Earth was being bombarded, life was present. Life Forms on Earth 4 Billion Years Ago Was life seeded to this planet? I don't know. Nobody knows. What sort of life was it? It was primitive, maybe bacterial life. But that early life was still sophisticated. It was sophisticated enough to cause this unique chemical signature in the carbon that we find and so this life was far from the origin of life. The origin of life is taking a collection of simple molecules and assembling them into information storage and recognition systems that then go on to reproduce and evolve by Darwinian evolution. WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND SO FAR AT EVEN THE OLDEST LEVELS SUCH AS 4 BILLION YEARS IS LIFE THAT IS MUCH MORE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED THAN YOU WOULD THINK FROM THE BEGINNING OF UNICELLULAR CLUSTERS? Exactly. We're far from the origin of life even at 3.9 billion years ago. Origin of the Moon It's now known to a fair degree of certainty that the moon formed between 4.45 and 4.5 billion years ago. So, the moon formed after the earth. The moon formed from the earth after a giant impact between the proto-earth and a Mars-sized object, another planet that existed in earth's neighborhood, in the solar system, about 4.5 billion years ago. Well, this impact caused the formation of the moon. This impact would also have wiped the slate clean for the earth. So, if there was life on earth before 4.5 billion years ago, it was wiped out. So, sometime between 4.45 when things settled down after the lunar formation event and the oceans and atmosphere re-condensed on the earth and 3.9 where"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"we find the the oldest known sediments containing life life forms appeared in that 550 million year interval. We can begin to ask questions like: Since life appeared so early on the earth, seemingly as the crust and atmosphere and hydrosphere were present - why couldn't it have gotten started somewhere else just as early? Like Mars. Or some other planet anywhere else in the galaxy or the universe where the three criteria are fulfilled: liquid water, energy resources and raw materials. A LOT OF THOSE RAW MATERIALS WOULD HAVE BEEN DUMPED ON PLANET SYSTEMS BY ASTEROIDS AND COMETS? Yeah! Anywhere you point a telescope out into space, you see these raw materials. You see them in dust clouds, in galactic dust clouds. I s the universe teeming with living organisms? IT'S ACTUALLY LOGICAL THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD BE TEEMING WITH LIFE? Yes, it is logical. And this is really something that NASA is banking on and I think it's a fair bet. Now, this might not be a surprise to readers that life is out there. What they might be surprised about, though, is the kind of life. See, life might be extremely common in the universe, but the kind of life that is extremely common may be restricted mostly to bacterial life. To get life to a sufficient level of advancement, you need to have stability. You need to have a planet that is correctly positioned in a solar system with a stable star and that the planet and its biosphere evolves with the changing conditions of the solar system. Our Sun Increases Its Luminosity 6% Every Billion Years The sun is gaining in its luminosity. The sun makes light and heat and energy from a nuclear reaction called fusion. And fusion means that you take hydrogen and you fuse hydrogen atoms together to make helium. Well, helium is a denser element than hydrogen. so, that means that the density of the sun is increasing over time. And with an increase in density, that means things burn hotter. Therefore, you convert more fuel to helium. THERE IS A NATURAL SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR WHY THE SUN WOULD KEEP INCREASING IN BRIGHTNESS AND HEAT WITH THE AGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM? That's correct. THE MORE HELIUM, THE HOTTER IT GETS. The more helium, the denser it gets and the hotter it burns. Therefore, more helium is produced and more hydrogen is consumed and the hotter it becomes. It's a positive feedback loop. DOES IT MEAN THE SUN WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE THROUGH THE REST OF ITS LIFE? Yes. The sun is increasing its luminosity by about 6% per billion years. And in the future, this is going to be a problem. When I say the future, I mean hundreds of millions of years in the future. BECAUSE THE SURFACE COULD BECOME SO WARM THAT IT MIGHT NOT BE LIVABLE? Right. So in the end - this is interesting because I think this has a lot to do with"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the search for life elsewhere in the universe. The window wherein you can have sophisticated life on a planet like the earth is relatively short compared to the age of the biosphere itself. Our biosphere is about 4 billion years old. We have maybe another 500 million years. So, our biosphere is in late middle age. THE SUN IS EXPECTED TO TURN INTO A RED GIANT AT ABOUT THE AGE OF 10 BILLION. BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IN TERMS OF SURVIVING ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AS WE KNOW IT, THAT WOULD BE CLOSED OUT IN ANOTHER 500 MILLION YEARS? That's right. And the last life on the earth will be much like the first. Bacteria living in an extreme environment of heat. This is something that geologists and astrophysicists have been able to contribute to the search for life elsewhere - that you may have little luck in finding anything but bacteria. But then, you also have to look at stars that are between 1 billion and 5 billion years old because that's your window. Anything younger than that, it's too early. Anything older than that, it's too late. Origin of Water THE QUESTION WOULD STILL REMAIN: WHAT WAS THE SEED FOR LIFE, WHETHER IT WAS UNDER THE OCEANS OR ON THE SURFACE OF LAND? AND FURTHER, WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OF ALL THE WATER ON THIS PLANET? Studies from planetary probes have demonstrated that Venus which is now a hellish planet with a surface temperature around 800 degrees F. once had abundant water. And that's from analysis of the chemistry of its atmosphere. That water is gone. It's all been evaporated away and the sunlight has caused this water to escape into space. COULD IT HAVE HAD WATER BECAUSE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE SUN WAS AT LEAST 30% DIMMER THAN IT IS NOW? Right. And the fact that the sun was dimmer in the early solar system means that water could have stayed stable on the surface of Venus for a few tens of millions of years after the planet formed. Then you had a runaway greenhouse because Venus was just too close, too close to the sun. Earth Water - Not Much from Comets Now, the earth. Earth has lots and lots of water and from the point of view of chemistry, it looks like it's mostly indigenous to the planet - that it wasn't brought in by comets. That was a popular theory in the 1980s that comets were responsible for earth water. HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? HOW COULD YOU SAY IT IS INDIGENOUS TO THE EARTH? Since the time of the comet-ocean theory, we've had a chance to test this theory by examining the chemistry of comets remotely and to ask ourselves: What do we know about the chemistry of cometary water? And compare it to chemistry of atmospheric water on plantets like Jupiter and Saturn to the Earth's water. It turns out that the chemistry of cometary water as measured remotely by space probes is very, very different from the Earth's water. It is so different that it could never have contributed more than about 5 or 10% of the earth's water budget. HOW CAN IT BE SO RADICALLY DIFFERENT IF WATER IS SIMPLY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"H2O? This has to do with isotopes. Different elements themselves, each element tends to have more than one 'flavor' and these are called isotopes. For instance, carbon has three isotopes, three flavors. Isotopic Ratios WHICH RELATES TO THE NUMBER OF PROTONS IN THE NUCLEUS? An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. But an isotope of an element is determined by the number of neutrons. So, for instance carbon is an element with six protons. And the most abundant isotope of carbon is Carbon 12. It's an element that has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Therefore, it has an atomic weight of 12. The second isotope of carbon is Carbon 13. It still has 6 protons, but this time Carbon 13 has 7 neutrons. So, it has an atomic weight of 13. Now, there is a radioactive isotope of carbon called Carbon 14 that many people have heard about. It again has another neutron so it has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. And this element is unstable and breaks down rapidly in the time frame of a few thousand years. The same is true for oxygen. Oxygen has three isotopes. It has 16, which is 8 and 8; which is 8 and 9; and 18 which is 8 and 10, protons and neutrons respectively. So when you look at the oxygen isotopic composition of comets of other planets and of the earth, you find that comets are unrelated isotopically to the earth or other planets. And if they made any contribution, it's rather minor. So, it looks like most of our water came from the original stuff that went into building planets. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 4.5 BILLION YEARS AGO? Exactly. From the very beginning.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
