W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, in his Grass Lake, Michigan, laboratory. Photograph © by Linda Moulton Howe. Interview: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan: “The surprises started when I got the samples in. The first very unusual event occurred when I was taking the first sampling, which was all from the privet bush/tree. These were small limbs with the leaves on them contained within a gallon Ziploc bag. I took them out of the bag and carried them a distance of probably three feet to my lab bench. I was very delicately pulling the shipped limbs apart. There were three limb samples in the bag. As I was pulling them apart, suddenly I noticed that there was a pile of leaves on the lab bench. I thought, ‘That’s strange.’ Or maybe they got knocked off in shipment? So, I turned around and went back to the bag from which I just removed the three limbs and there was not a leaf in the bag! I ended up counting sixty-seven leaves fell off the branch and there were still leaves left on the branch. Then I picked the branch up and shook it and not another leaf came off. Just to show you how unusual this is, I kept the branch in water and every day for five days, I shook that branch and not another leaf came off. Now, this leaf shedding in the botany community is called ‘abscission.’ It’s formed by concentrations of abscisic acid. [ Howe’s Note: Wikipedia - Abscission (from Latin abscindere, from ab- ‘off, away’ + scindere ‘to cut’) is the shedding of a body part. It most commonly refers to the process by which a plant intentionally drops one or more of its parts, such as a leaf, fruit, flower or seed. Abscisic acid (ABA), also known as abscisin II and dormin, is a plant hormone. It functions in many plant developmental processes, including bud dormancy. Abscisic acid owes its names to its role in the abscission of plant leaves. In preparation for winter, ABA is produced in terminal buds. This slows plant growth and directs leaf primordia to develop scales to protect the dormant buds during the cold season. A plant will abscise a part either to discard a member that is no longer necessary, such as a leaf during autumn, or a flower following fertilization, or for the purposes of reproduction. Most deciduous plants drop their leaves by abscission before winter, while evergreen plants continuously abscise their leaves. Another form of abscission is fruit drop, when a plant abscises fruit while still immature in order to conserve resources needed to bring the remaining fruit to maturity. If a leaf is damaged a plant may also abscise it to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"conserve water or photosynthetic efficiency, depending on the costs to the plant as a whole.] At the petiole, which is the stem of the leaf, there is a thick region that is called a pulvinis at the base of the leaf. In the pulvinis, there is a layer called an abscission layer. In the fall of the year, when the photosynthates disappear, that abscission layer is filled with abscisic acid. That acid causes the cells to swell and literally burst in a lateral layer across the petiole. So, naturally when that forms, the leaf drops off. Anomalies in Levittown Privet Leaves 1) Leaf Fall Off in Mid-Summer What is so unusual here is that you never see leaves fall off to this degree in the middle of growth season of June and July. Further, there was a synchrony so that the leaves all fell off at the same time. So, what is thrown off here is the total biorhythm of that privet limb. 2) Anthocyanin in Privet Leaves Exposed to Sky I started to examine the leaves one-by-one and found what I first thought was a brownish-red stain on the leaves. It covered parts of the leaves so you could not see the green chlorophyll. As it turned out, that was not a stain on the leaf. It was a production of a pigment called anthocyanin inside the leaf. And that is just not normal for June or July! Anthocyanin is a pigment that is very deep red. When you combine red and green pigments, you get a brown. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Anthocyanins are water-soluble vacuolar pigments that may appear red, purple, or blue according to pH. They belong to a parent class of molecules called flavonoids synthesized via the phenylpropanoid pathway. Anthocyanins occur in all tissues of higher plants, including leaves, stems, roots, flowers, and fruits. In photosynthetic tissues (such as leaves and sometimes stems), anthocyanins have been shown to act as a sunscreen, protecting cells from intense light damage. The plant's anthocyanin absorbs blue-green and UV light, thus protecting the tissues from photoinhibition, or stress from intense light exposure.] I again noticed that this pigment formation was only on the outside leaves. In other words, the leaves facing the sky are the only leaves that had anthocyanin. Well, what is the anthocyanin doing on those privet leaves at the peak of summer? One of the purposes of this pigment inside a plant is to protect the plant from very high levels of radiation. So, when the leaves drop off, or abscise, in the fall of the year, that anthocyanin pigment comes forth. Then in the maples it can be a beautiful pinkish-red in the beautiful colors you see in deciduous trees in the fall. The green chlorophyll is essentially gone because it degrades with cold weather and lower light levels. So, you have two biochemicals - anthocyanin and chlorophyll - that are normally metabolized, but in the privet bush and silver maple tree case in Levittown, Pennsylvania, the leaves exposed to the energies of the aerial object have been thrown completely out of synchronization with normal seasons. High levels of radiation energy can cause an increase in both abscisic acid and the pigment, anthocyanin. And it turns out that’s exactly what took place in the Levittown privet bush. Microscopic Examination of Privet and Silver Maple Leaves I then turned to more detail study of the privet leaves with microscopic studies. I found there were holes in the leaves and I’m now talking about both the privet and silver maple leaves that were both in the same yard of the lady who saw what I am going to call ‘beamed energies.’ Right now, we don’t know what else to call them. These beamed energies were very powerful. The energies punched holes right in the leaves of both the privet and the silver maple. These holes were not characteristic of insect damage. In any tree, I don’t care what the variety is, you can take a leaf and you’ll find in about one out of five leaves has one or two holes in it. These holes are caused by chewing insects. The insects chew right through the leaf. But what was not present in these leaves that were hit by the energy beams – there was no insect excrement, there were no egg cases, there were no cocoons, and there was no"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"evidence of chewing. In fact, some of the holes in the leaves were almost square-shaped. Around the holes in every case in both the privet and silver maple leaves, there was a thin line or border of the reddish-brown anthocyanin. Anthocyanin can form when leaves are exposed to high energies. WHICH CAN BE SUNLIGHT OR? Or microwaves or electrical energy. My main point is that these were lesions or damage to the plants that could not be explained by insects. In one case, there was a hole about 1 millimeter in diameter that was cut through the leaf and the center part that was cut out was still there, just hanging there by a couple of leafy threads. I was fortunate enough to get a good photograph of this. The center part also had a border of red and a lot of green in one section. One section had an area of anthocyanin and in the outer hole, the rim of that also had anthocyanin. I speculate the biophysical and biochemical changes are all related to the affects of the mysterious, glittering energy interacting with the leaves. Thin, Straight Red Lines On Leaves: Rapid Heating I also want to point out there was another extremely unusual lesion that was very precisely exposed on the leaf. It was a line just like you would take a ballpoint pen with a ruler and draw a line with the ruler and pen across the leaf. The width of that line – what I’m calling an ‘energy beam’ trace – was only 1/10th of one millimeter wide. A rrow points to unusual reddish, thin, straight line on one of the sampled silver maple leaves exposed to the Levittown aerial object's glittery light energy. Image © 2008 by W. C. Levengood. The way I found these thin, straight lines was in seeing that some of the leaves were folded up, just like the flap of an envelope. Maybe half of the leaf was folded over. I’ve seen that before and in every case I’ve ever seen before, there was a cocoon from a leaf minor insect. Those leaf minors build cocoons inside leaves and on leaves and so on, as some other insects do as well. I open up the folded privet and silver maple leaves and what do you know? No indication of insects whatsoever. But what caused some of the leaves to fold up? Well, it was one of these thin, straight lines that were obviously put down at very high temperatures in a very short time interval – probably only a microsecond. The heating caused the leaf cells to expand and caused the formation of anthocyanin that created the thin, red lines. So, what’s going on here? This seems to be physical evidence of very thin energy beams only 1/10th of a millimeter wide, probably of a microwave nature, that caused these straight line lesions in the leaves. YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS BEFORE? No. I’ve never seen anything like this before. Surprising Anthocyanin On Affected Levittown Leaves"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Then I took a series of photographs of the midvein because I was impressed about how abruptly this anthocyanin production stopped; in other words, the line of demarcation between the normal green leaf and the anthocyanin. You could see this more plainly on the bottom side of the silver maple leaves. You can see the green midvein and then all of a sudden, the anthocyanin starts. I took photomicrographs above where the line of demarcation is and I took it below. The line stops in a fraction of a millimeter. You’ve got red below it and green above it in the midvein. DID THIS HAPPEN IN BOTH THE PRIVET AND SILVER MAPLE LEAVES? Yes. The silver maple gives the more sensational photographs, which are the ones I took. By that, I mean you can see the cell structure so nicely. Genetic Mutations in Privet Leaves? As I continued to examine the leaves, I saw another effect that was startling. I found privet leaves that had a heart shape, but the privet’s normal leaf shape is long and lance-shaped. I found about three privet leaves that were heart-shaped. What is going on here? This is clearly a genetic mutation, but it’s in somatic tissue, in tissue that is non-germinal or non-reproductive. MEANING THAT THE BUDS OF THESE MALFORMED LEAVES MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO ENERGY THAT CAUSED A CHANGE IN THEIR NORMAL DEVELOPMENT. Yes. That caused me to look at the tips of the leaves more closely on those 167 leaves that feel from the privet branch. The tips of the leaves – even though the rest of the leaves might be green and healthy – were reddish-brown anthocyanin. Both anthocyanin and abscisic acid can cause abnormalities in the normal physical development of the plant. Then I got in the mail Linda’s transcript of her field notes interview with Robert Gardner (July 20, 2008). The mother-eyewitness had observed the glittery pieces in her yard more than once. And each time her dog barked. We find the same phenomenon in crop formations where dogs are very sensitive to the energy beams that interact with the crops. I understand that the woman’s dog awakened her in the early morning hours on six different visitations in her yard. The privet and silver maple samples were gathered after the July 8, 2008, 4:10 AM event. I was delighted to see the timeline of events and so many visitations and realized what happened at her apartment home was a repeating exposure to the aerial object's beamed energy over a few weeks. And that could explain the heart shape in some of the privet leaves. They were hit by the energies at the tip of the exposed leaves. That energy caused cell damage and so the leaf tried to heal the young leaf lobe (all were young leaves) causing the lobes to develop more than the midvein and the rest of the leaf. The lobes grew faster outward, which would give some exposed and damaged leaves the heart shape. A DIFFERENT RATE OF CELL GROWTH CHANGED THOSE PARTICULAR LEAVES FROM A SPEAR SHAPE TO A HEART SHAPE. Yes. At that point right in the middle at the tip where the midvein ends, growth probably stopped there temporarily while the rest of the leaf kept growing. Energy-Affected Leaves Were Only On Outside and Top of Privet and Silver Maple DID YOU FIND THAT THE AFFECTED LEAVES WERE ONLY ON THE OUTER TOPS OF THE TREES AND MORE SHADED LEAVES WERE NOT AFFECTED? Yes. That was another important aspect. The impact of the beamed energy on anthocyanin production and on abscisic acid was far more evident on the upper side of the leaf than the bottom. SO THE ENERGIES WERE COMING FROM ABOVE ON TO THE TOP LEAVES AND THE LOWER AND INNER LEAVES WERE SHADED BY THE UPPER LEAVES. Yes, to the young outer leaves. This is why so many of those abscised, but not the inner"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"leaves. After that privet leaf fall on my lab bench, I kept those sampled limbs because there were a lot of leaves still left on the samples. Later it came to me that all the leaves that remained intact with the three sampled branches were mature leaves, which is exactly opposite of the way it would happen in nature where the older leaves would drop first because they were no longer producing food for the tree. SO, IT WAS THE YOUNGER OUTER AND UPPER LEAVES EXPOSED TO THE ENERGIES, WHICH WERE ALSO THE YOUNGER LEAVES ON BOTH THE PRIVET AND SILVER MAPLE THAT ENDED UP DROPPING LIKE FALL LEAVES. Yes, exactly. That’s exactly the way to put it. I saw some evidence on the inner leaves – they weren’t free of the effect, but it was to a much lesser degree. I could also see clearly in some of the leaves that half of the leaf had been shaded from the leaf above and the bottom of the leaf had been affected by the energy beam. WHAT KIND OF ENERGIES COULD LEAVE THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS YOU'VE FOUND ON THE LEAVES OF THE PRIVET AND THE SILVER MAPLE? We’ve got to realize that his is one damn complex energy! First of all, the abscisic acid is formed and known to increase dramatically because of high radiant energy such as the infrared or microwave. What happens is there are two isomers in the plants. In an isomer, the molecule has the same number of atoms, but the atoms are arranged differently in each molecule. These complex beam energies can flip the molecules from one isomer to another that can in turn affect metabolism in the plant to a much greater degree – say, Isomer Number Two more than Isomer Number One. That’s one energy. We know that microwave energy can cause anthocyanin production. But from some work I did back in 1967, I discovered in hybrid corn kernels that are totally yellow, if I exposed those to an electric field – a very modest field like 50 volts per centimeter – I got a flux or rapid transfer of anthocyanin up the corn kernel. If I reverse the electric field, the anthocyanin goes from top to bottom. The anthocyanin molecule has a very high positive ionic electric charge. That means it migrates rapidly through the cells of the plant tissues and can be formed by an electric field. Hillsboro, Ohio Corn Formation See Archive: 090404 Earthfiles R eddish-purple color on one side of corn stalks in crop circle discovered on July 5, 2004, in Hillsboro, Ohio. The red discoloration is anthocyanin, which is normally a residue after chlorophyll disintegrates. But this was the peak of summer and Ohio researcher Jeffrey Wilson wrote: “Red coloration is only on one side of plant and shows ‘shadow of leaf ’ fell on corn from stalk blocking (shading) part of the affected area (from the energy).” Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA. This anthocyanin effect can be very specific, confined to a very small region, which we see in the privet and silver maple leaves. This came through loud and clear in some work we did back in 2004 from a crop formation in Hillsboro, Ohio. [Hillsboro, Ohio, July 5, 2004, mysteriously flattened corn plants. There are six Earthfiles reports about the Hillsboro research between July 6, 2004, and June 2005.] There were unique energy formations in that flattened corn as we find in the privet and silver maple leaves. I’ll mention only one: the most sensational effect in the Hillsboro sweet corn formation, where the corn stalks were downed by the plasma vortex energies,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the corn kernels in the ears of corn in the affected downed plants each looked like they had a purple skull cap. The rest of each corn kernel was normal yellow. That represents an amazing selection of energies. The normal control ears of corn from Hillsboro showed no anthocyanin whatsoever. I’m mentioning this as a reference to demonstrate that even on ears of corn, every single kernel – even the very immature kernels at the tip of the corn ear – showed that little purple spot of anthocyanin. An amazing effect! And to even begin to understand the pigmentation specificity on each of the corn kernels, it was necessary to consider the role of anthocyanin in plants. And there in Hillsboro, I think an electric field was involved and in this Levittown, Pennsylvania, case, we also have evidence that an electric field took part in this. What I found in my 1967 laboratory work with electric fields, corn kernels and anthocyanin production – and this is work that Linda included in her June 2, 2005, Earthfiles report, ‘Part 2 - Highly Anomalous Pigment Formation in 2004 Hillsboro, Ohio, Crop Formation.’ I also measured the rate of ionophoresis, or electrophoresis. [The motion of charged particles under the influence of an electric field; particles with a positive charge go to the cathode and negative to the anode.] The ionophoresis progressed in a very linear way with time. I took leaves from the silver maple and the privet – specifically one that was about half mature and had no anthocyanin on it. Then I found another leaf that was about half mature that was totally affected. There was no green on the leaf. It was completely reddish-brown. I put that leaf in the instrument I have that measures the radox (oxidation reduction) activity in the leaf in a quantitative manner. The radox activity that I could measure in those two leaves was so different that I couldn’t even put them on the same graph. The computer could not handle the difference. The energy in the anthocyanin leaf that was still metabolizing was over 15 times the energy in the green leaf. The energy in the green leaf was exactly the energy I would expect in a normal leaf in the June to July period of the year. So that means the energies from the unidentified aerial object were very effective in provoking the production of anthocyanin in the privet and silver maple leaves. Then from the normal green leaf, I applied a mathematical analysis with an equation I have worked with through the years in crop formation research. In mathematics, it is called an algorithm, a fundamental equation that fits everything because it reduces a fundamental process in physics or chemistry to its very elemental parts with this equation. I applied my algorithm to the green leaf and plotted it out and it agreed perfectly with the algorithm with a correlation efficient of .99. The anthocyanin leaf I analyzed at the same time using the same algorithm method did not fit that equation. My experience with this over the past decade has told me that if something I’m studying does not fit that equation, the plant is being influenced by an outside energy source. And we know the sampled leaves were surrounded by whatever was coming down in the beamed energy seen by the eyewitness as glittering little squares of light surrounding the privet and silver maple for at least twenty minutes - three different nights! If that energy source has, in part, an electric field – or maybe the total energy effect on the plants is an electric field – then it will fit a completely different equation, which is just a straight-line linear effect. And that’s exactly what the data showed me. Because the anthocyanin leaf fit the same linear effect that I found back in my 1967 lab work with electric fields and corn kernels. This seems to me pretty strong evidence that an electric field was involved in this Levittown, Pennsylvania, energy interaction with the plants. Summary of Levittown, Pennsylvania, Anomalies We now end up with three effects from the beamed energy: 1) Abscisic acid 2) Anthocyanin 3) Somatic mutation of privet leaf shapes My conclusion is that microwaves, probably infrared energy in the heat region, and"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"electric fields are involved. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY DESCRIBED AS LOOKING LIKE LITTLE 1-INCH-SQUARES OF LIGHT COULD BE TAKING ‘BIOPSIES’ OF TISSUE IN THOSE THIN LINES FROM THE LEAVES? IT'S EXTRAORDINARY THAT NEITHER THE MOTHER NOR DAUGHTER EVER SAW A PHYSICAL BEAM - ONLY THE GLITTERY ‘SNOW FALL’ OF THE LITTLE SQUARES OF LIGHT. Whether the witnesses saw physical beams or not, there are many lasers that operate in infrared. If you take a laser beam that’s out in the ultraviolet, beyond the visible and into the x-ray region and you suddenly lower its energy, you’ll suddenly find it shifts into the visible region to the human eye. I don’t think you can get away from beams. When she said the particles were sucked back up into the craft rapidly, I think that means whatever or whoever is in the craft is switching back to a different wavelength that is no longer visible. The intelligence is withdrawing the energy back to its source. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IF WE ARE DEALING WITH A BEAM TECHNOLOGY THAT IS NOT VISIBLE TO THE HUMAN RETINA AND WAS DEPOSITING THE LITTLE SQUARES OF LIGHT ON THE TREES, THAT THIS IS A COMPLEX ENERGY SYSTEM THAT IS BEYOND MODERN HUMAN TECHNOLOGY? Yes, I think so. On one of these big silver maple leaves, it was still essentially intact, but I noticed it had been riddled with the energies. So, I took a back lighted photograph of the leaf and, my God!, it looks like somebody took a shotgun to the leaf. There are lines, there are streaks, there are holes and they are all bordered with anthocyanin. The beamed energy created the 1/10th of one-millimeter lines. So, I don’t think we can figure out what this is. WHAT WOULD BE SO SPECIAL ABOUT THE PRIVET AND SILVER MAPLE THAT THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD KEEP COMING BACK? Yes, I agree. Why the concentration on those specific people, those specific plants? It’s almost like whatever the intelligence is, it’s teaching us. But we’re sure slow learners! AND WHERE IS IT ALL HEADED? Yes. I can’t see anything here that’s malevolent. In all my work with the various phenomena, I have never seen anything that appears to be malevolent – or benevolent, for that matter.” R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 2 R eturn to Part 3 More Information: I would appreciate hearing from other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light events in the United States and world.
