January 15, 2003 North Logan, Utah - The mother and son in a North Logan, Utah family who have seen tall, hairy Bigfoot creatures walk along the canal behind their house have asked not to be identified for fear of public ridicule. The mother first saw a Bigfoot when she was 15-years-old in 1968 in almost the same place that her 16-year-old son saw another large, hairy creature on January 2, 2003. It was 11:30 p.m. MST and \"Billy,\" as I'll call him, was talking with his cousin on his grandma's back porch two houses over from his parents' house. Interviews: \"Billy,\" 16-year-old teenager, North Logan, Utah: \" My cousin said, 'What is that across the canal?' I looked, but I didn't see anything. Then it walked out of the trees. It was something big, maybe 7 feet tall. The thing came walking out with pretty big arms and it was making this big growling noise. That's what I heard the most. CAN YOU MIMIC THE GROWL THAT YOU HEARD? Billy makes a big breathing/grunting sound twice. WAS IT HEAVY BREATHING OR TRULY LIKE A GROWL? I think it was heavy breathing, something like that. And we just got really freaked out about the breathing, so me and my cousin ran straight for the door. I looked back once and it didn't look at us or anything. It just looked like it was going where it needed to go and just kept walking. EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DARK, WAS THERE ENOUGH MOONLIGHT TO SEE IF IT HAD HAIR? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yeah, it looked like something was coming off of it, like off its head. I saw that quite good. SO, IT WAS THE SOUND, THE SIZE THAT YOU COULD SEE, AND WAS THERE ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE FACE? SOME PEOPLE HAVE SAID THAT IN THE DARKNESS THEY HAVE SEEN EYES ON SOME OF THESE TALL SASQUATCH OR BIGFOOT CREATURES GLOW? I didn't see anything like that. It wasn't facing me. It was just looking down the canal. It didn't even turn its head, I don't think. DID YOU GO BACK IN THE DAYLIGHT TO SEE IF YOU COULD FIND ANY TRACKS? Yes. We couldn't find any on the canal trail, but we found some down in my granddad's orchard. HOW BIG? Pretty big size. About 18 inches, I think. DID YOU TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS? Ye s . Approximate 18-inch-long footprint that Billy found in his granddad's orchard on January 3, 2003 off the canal where he and his cousin saw the large, hairy creature the night before. The blue material is actually white frost. Color distortion by digital camera Digital image © 2003 by Billy's sister. WHAT ARE YOU LEFT THINKING HAVING SEEN THIS HUGE, STRANGE, HAIRY CREATURE RIGHT BEHIND YOUR HOUSE? Pretty frightened. It scared me a lot! I didn't know what to do. WHEN YOU RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE, DID YOU GET A FLASHLIGHT? We ran into my grandma's house and I went downstairs to grab the flashlight, but I didn't dare to go back outside after that.\" Billy's Mother \"It was frightening to me, too. I was about the same age as my son, about"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"15-years-old in 1968. I was actually in the same location that Billy was. In fact the place where we live right now is only two houses away from my parents' house which is where my son saw the same thing on January 2. I was sleeping out in my parents' backyard. It faces a canal and Utah State University research farm. (different kinds of plants for research since at least the early 1960s.) I was sleeping out with a sister and a friend. It was pretty late at night. I would imagine it was midnight or 1 a.m. Over on the other side of the canal, I saw basically the same thing he (Billy) saw. WAS THERE A MOON OUT? There was a moon out. It was just a very large thing walking on two legs, but it was not human. IN THE MOONLIGHT, COULD YOU SEE HAIR? Yes, I could see it had some type of hair, but I was seeing this from the side, whatever it is. It is walking north and I am facing west, looking at it in a side view. I did not see any facial features whatsoever. But I saw the form. I saw the arms were extremely long and really moving and this thing was taking large steps because it walked by and was gone in a matter of seconds. It was very large. HOW CLOSE TO YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS WHEN IT WALKED BY? It was about 35 to 40 feet away. I could hear it breathing. It never looked back at me. Of course, it probably didn't know we were there. We were laying flat on the ground in our sleeping bags. Then the part about it that is extremely funny is that I never told anyone about it. It was totally mind-boggling to me! ANY CAVES? Yes, there is Logan Canyon and Green Canyon which is closest to where we live and there are some large caves up Green Canyon and also up Logan Canyon.\" More Information: My sincere thanks to Ryan Layton in Utah who called me about this January Bigfoot sighting and who has devoted so many hours and resources to investigating Bigfoot and other unusual phenomena in his home state and the western region.
