Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Current Brightest Binocular Comet and Upcoming Solar Eclipse © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe June 15, 1999 Cambridge, Massachusetts A comet discovered on April 16th in the Southern Hemisphere is now moving further north towards the Constellation of Cancer. It's not visible to the naked eye, but it is the brightest comet for binocular viewing out of nearly sixty now being tracked by Harvard University's Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The icy ball is called \"Comet C/1999 H1-Lee\" after its accidental discovery by astronomer Steven Lee who works at the Anglo Australian Observatory in New South Wales.

Harvard Observatory's Director, Dan Green, told me today that neither C/1999 H1-Lee nor any of the dozens of comets currently in our solar system are expected to become brightly visible to the naked eye. Dan Green thinks the most exciting astronomical event this year will be the August 11, 1999 last total solar eclipse in Europe for the next seventy nine years. But he knows amateur astronomers are now competing for money and the chance to have a comet named after them like H1-Lee. Here is Dan Green talking about Steven Lee's comet discovery and whether it could go close enough to the sun in its orbit to have any affect in this period of increased solar activity. Interview: Dan Green, Director, Harvard Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"And he was at a star party actually and discovered this comet visually with a telescope, similar to how Alan Hale discovered Comet Hale-Bopp back in 1995. And it was observed - it was very far south, only observable from the very southern latitudes at that time in April, but it was observed quickly and we got an orbit for it rather quickly. It's a long "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"period comet. AND A LONG PERIOD COMET MEANS BY DEFINITION? An orbital period longer than 200 years. But this is much longer than 200 years. I don't know exactly what the orbital period of this is, but my guess is that it is probably in the tens of thousands of years at least. It doesn't go close enough to the sun to affect the sun and to be affected much by the sun. It goes to about the distance of Venus from the sun. That's not exceptionally close. It does go inside the earth's orbit. What we do here is that we deal with all comets. So, I'm dealing with on the order of 20, 30, 40 comets every day. So, for me, there is nothing that has stood out about this comet, 1999 H-1, other than the fact that it's been the brightest comet - it's a binocular comet. There are no other comets that are easily observable with binoculars right now. And it's been moving northward from the Southern Hemisphere skies, so it's now observable in the Northern Hemisphere. But it's not going to get much brighter than it is now. WHICH IS ABOUT HOW BRIGHT? It's around 7th magnitude which makes it a binocular object. But you have to know where to look. The average person isn't going to go out and find it. You have to basically be familiar with astronomy and understand star charts and that kind of thing in order to be able to see it. IS IT NEAR ANY KNOWN CONSTELLATION THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD RECOGNIZE? It's moving slowly toward Gemini and the bright stars of Castor and Pollux and it will cross into Gemini in early July. It's going to be too close to the sun to be observable really after next week for about a month. For most of the month of July, it will be too close to the sun to be observable. And then it will pull away and it should still be a binocular object going into September and well observable from the Northern Hemisphere. We have binocular comets like this every year. This is not unusual in that sense. WHAT'S THE CLOSEST IT WILL COME TO THE EARTH? Closest to the earth already occurred in May and again that wasn't very close - about the distance from Venus to the Sun. The closest point to the sun is called perihelion and that occurs on July 11th. After July 11th, it's moving again away from the sun, but it's still in the inner solar system well into next year. It's not going out of the solar system this year. It takes awhile to come into this solar system, the inner solar system, and go out again. So, it's going to be well inside the orbit of Jupiter for quite some time to come. ANY ESTIMATE ON THE DIAMETER? No. It's not a really big comet like Hale-Bopp was. So, I'm guessing that this is maybe on the order of a mile across for the actual nucleus. Now, the coma - which is the atmosphere of the comet - and the tail are much larger than that. But those are the ices that have sublimated and the gasses and are moving away from the nucleus. The nucleus itself is only about a mile across and you can't see that with a telescope from earth. The important thing here is that among the known comets there is no comet that is going to be a naked eye comet in the near future. However, the long period comets are necessarily unknown until they come close to the inner part of the solar system, until they become bright enough for us to see. BECAUSE WE'VE NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. That's right. So, in the case of Comet 1996 B-2, which was known as Hyakutake after the Japanese amateur who found it in January of 1996, it was a telescopic"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"object when he found it in January. But it passed very close to the earth in late March of 1996 and was a bright naked eye object, even from downtown Manhattan in New York City! So, there are bright comets that can come up at any moment and be suddenly visible. Another such comet occurred in 1983 which was a bright naked eye object one week after it was discovered. So, it is possible for these things to happen and one needs to follow the news if you really want to be serious about seeing one of these comets. BUT SO FAR, COMET C/1999 H1-LEE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN A BINOCULAR COMET FOR THE REST OF THIS YEAR. IT'S NOT EXPECTED TO EVER FLARE UP AND BE SEEN BY THE NAKED EYE. That's right. It will probably be a binocular object into the early fall, something like that, of this year. And again, you have to know exactly where to look. It's not a bright object. If anyone is interested in the general public in seeing this comet, I would advise them to go to their local astronomy club or local university observatory and see if they have public open nights and they might be able to have the comet pointed out to them in a small telescope. ARE YOU ALL GETTING READY FOR THE AUGUST 11TH, 1999 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN EUROPE IN ANY WAY? ARE YOU GOING TO SEND ANYBODY OVER? There are people who are going in a formal capacity as professional astronomers. But most professional astronomers that I know actually go over personally. In other words, they just go over to look at it themselves because of the beauty. There is nothing more splendid in nature than seeing a total eclipse of the sun! It is absolutely exceptional and I recommend anybody who ever has a chance to see such an eclipse to take a look. You get hooked and you have to go back and see the next one and the next one. It's quite an amazing thing to see. THIS AUGUST 11TH ONE IN EUROPE WILL BE THE LAST ONE FOR, I BELIEVE, 79 YEARS THERE IN THAT PARTICULAR PATH AND REGION. ARE YOU GOING TO PLAN TO GO YOURSELF? Yes, I've been planning for some years to go and see it myself. WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO WATCH? I'm not exactly sure yet. It will probably be dependent on the weather, but I'll be somewhere in central Europe. The further east that one goes in Europe, the better the prospects tend to be in terms of average weather conditions. Now, the last two August 11th in a row - most of Europe was very clear. But August 12th of last year after a totally clear day on eclipse day - it was raining over most of Europe! So, it's one of those things that's kind of chancy and you kind of try to go where the law of averages is best in terms of weather. But there is no way to predict how the weather is going to turn out. AND TOTALITY IS GOING TO LAST ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES? Yeah, on average, it's probably closer to two minutes. The longest it will be will be closer to two and a half minutes. So, it's not very long at all. It's very short, but a lot of people spend a lot of money to get to the path of totality to see these things. And there's a reason for that. If you're just outside the path of totality and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the sun is 98 to 99% covered by the moon, it's just like it was 1% covered. It's kind of interesting and it gets a little bit darker, noticeably darker, but if the sun is not completely covered by the moon - the difference is literally night and day. You really have to be in the path of totality which is an area of only about 100 or 200 miles in width in order to actually see the total eclipse. And that is the only time that you can actually look at the sun directly when it's high in the sky. Then the moon is completely blocking out all the harmful rays of the sun and you see this beautiful outer atmosphere of the sun. It's just hard to describe. It's really amazing! HOW MANY HAVE YOU SEEN? Five. WHAT WAS THE LONGEST AND MOST DRAMATIC ONE? I saw one in Mexico that was close to seven minutes in 1991. AND WHAT, FROM SEEING FIVE AND COMPARING THAT ONE TO THE OTHERS, WAS THERE ANYTHING ESPECIALLY EXTRAORDINARY IN THE COLOR AND BREADTH OF CORONA? The corona is different at each eclipse. And at some eclipses, it tends to be larger than at other eclipses because it's tied into somewhat the solar cycle. There's a cycle of solar activity that goes 11 years where you have a maximum and then a minimum. So, around the time of maximum solar activity, the corona tends to be more splendid and larger. But even at solar minimum, the corona is very nice to see. WELL, WE'RE MOVING INTO A SOLAR STORM SEASON BETWEEN 1999 AND 2000 IN THE ELEVEN YEAR CYCLE OF THE SUN. DOES THAT BODE WELL THAT THE AUGUST 11TH, 1999 TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE IN EUROPE COULD HAVE A SPECTACULAR CORONA? I think the corona is always spectacular. It's not that different between maximum and minimum. I just think a total solar eclipse is wonderful to see at any time, whether maximum or minimum. It's just something you'll never forget.\" More Information: There are more astronomical wonders for the Fourth of July. Besides fireworks, Venus will be the brightest object in the western sky as twilight fades around 9 PM and Mars will be the brightest red object. And two weeks later on July 15th, Venus will seem to move close to the crescent moon and the beautiful blue star, Regulus. Also, in July, the first Wilson Comet Awards will be given to half a dozen amateur astronomers who have discovered new comets in the past twelve months. The prize money of $25,000 will be divided among the recipients. So, from now on, amateur astronomers in the United States and around the world will have even more incentive to look for comets and compete for the next round of Wilson Comet Awards in 2000.
