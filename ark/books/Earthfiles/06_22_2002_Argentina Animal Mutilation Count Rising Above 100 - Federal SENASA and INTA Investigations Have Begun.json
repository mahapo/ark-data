More than 100 mutilated cows, and now horses, have been reported to local authorities in seven provinces since April. Image © 2002 by Rio Negro Online , Argentina. June 22, 2002 Buenos Aires, Argentina - This week, the unusual animal deaths known as mutilations which have been making headlines in Argentina's La Pampa Province since early spring finally made the news on American television. The number of cases has continued to rise daily and is approaching 100, according to local newspapers in La Pampa. Horses were also found mutilated this week and the number of affected provinces has increased to seven La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Rio Negro, Santa Fe, Entre Roos, Chaco and Patagonia.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Specialists from Argentina's federal agencies, SENASA and INTA, are inspecting mutilated cows and having tissue sent to laboratories, including the University of Buenos Aires School of Pathology. SENASA is similar to the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. INTA is similar to USDA's Food Safety Inspection Service. I called the American Embassy in Buenos Aires in an effort to reach one of the SENASA veterinarians, Dr. Daniel Belot, who has examined a dozen mutilated animals and sent tissue to the University of Buenos Aires School of Pathology. He told a reporter for the Nuevo Dia local newspaper that the University's only comment so far about the animal tissue has been that \"how the incisions were made cannot be determined.\" Photographs here and below © 2002 by various Argentina media. The American Embassy gave me telephone numbers for various SENASA managers who might be able to speak in English on the record about the animal mutilations spreading beyond the La Pampa province southwest of Buenos Aires. My efforts to call them gave me an insight into other headlines about Argentina's failing economy. Most of the telephone numbers have a recording that says the number is not in service. I called back the American Embassy to report the problem. Then it was explained that SENASA has not paid its phone bills and service to the government agency has been shut down to only a few lines. That would be like the Department of Agriculture in the United States not paying its phone bills and having most of its phone service cut off. Such a fate for a government bureaucracy in the United States does not seem possible. But in Argentina today, the economic crisis is that severe. Meanwhile, cattle and horses continue to be found in the La Pampa province with the strange, bloodless excisions of tissue that have been reported around the world since at least the late 1960s, including other previous cycles of animal mutilations in South America. In the 1980s, I first reported that pathology studies of mutilation excisions revealed exposure to high heat that cooked the hemoglobin and collagen in the tissues. (See my 2-volume book, Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop .) That cautery explained the lack of blood along the cut edges. But when pathologist and hematologist, Dr. John Altshuler, compared animal mutilation excisions to known laser surgery, he found something missing which puzzled him. Life on earth is carbon-based. If you burn carbon-based tissue with a laser, there will be a carbon residue that can easily be seen under a microscope. Dr. Altshuler could not find carbon residue on the mutilation excisions he studied. To this day, the cutting instrument in animal mutilations is unknown. Veterinarians in Argentina who have examined this recent cycle of animal mutilations there are saying officially that some of the cuts on the animals are cauterized, cut with heat. A veterinarian in Argentina today, in fact, talked about bloodless cauterization of a mutilated cow with reporter Reed Lindsay in Buenos Aires. Reed freelances for North American newspapers. This afternoon"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"he talked with two ranchers in the Rio Negro province who have discovered mutilated cows recently. One is a veterinarian who described a cow he examined on June 17th that had been dead since June 8, but was oddly preserved from decay and untouched by natural predators. Interview: Reed Lindsay, Freelance Reporter reporting for North American newspapers, currently based in Buenos Aires, Argentina: \"He (veterinarian and rancher near Choele Choel in Rio Negro) said one side of the head was like a normal dead cow. The other side had parts removed. The ear had been cut out. The tongue was removed and a part of the trachea. Also, muscles in the head and facial tissue had been removed as well. He said that one of the things that struck him was that the bones, there was no muscle or tissue on the bones. They were totally clean. Going to another part of the body, the rectum was cut out in a circular cut, as well as the reproductive organ and the mammary gland. The udder on the cow had been totally removed? Right, not totally removed. He mentioned there were two holes where the nipples would be. One of the things that struck him was that there were no signs, no footprints or tracks or anything in the area. The soil is soft. Another rancher told me that the dirt there is very soft. There is no way you could walk through there without leaving some kind of a track. There were no tracks around this animal, including none of the cow's own tracks? Exactly. He said it's common if an animal is killed, it will kick out its knees and there will be some signs of a struggle and there was none at all. It was as if it had just fallen from the sky."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"What about blood? Did the veterinarian make any comments about the bloodless condition of the cow? Right, he said no blood. No blood. This had been cauterized. Burned to seal off the blood vessels. Right. Another interesting thing he said was that there were no animals. There are wild pigs in the area and crows. The second rancher I spoke with who owned the land said that without fail within a day, the scavengers are there when an animal dies. He said the animals are still there and no one has come to do an autopsy or look at them yet. The cows are still in the same places he found them on the 9th. So far, there has been no scavengers that have moved in. That's between June 9 and June 22, no predation on dead cows in an area where there are hungry predators. Right. And no bad smell. No rotting smell at all of the dead carcasses, which he said is strange and unusual. Also, the veterinarian didn't come right out and say it, but he said this is not normal and not the work of humans. He said at one point that he had seen on his ranch, a light on the horizon that was the size of the moon. A bright light. When he drove closer, it disappeared.\" Unusual Lights and Beams Seen In Mutilation Areas The news source, Rio Negro Online reported that on Wednesday night, June 19, at 9 p.m., an unidentified object was seen in the vicinity of Puente Dique over the Rio Colorado in Catriel, some 25 kilometers from the province of Neuquen. The object was seen by several truckers and traffic controllers and was described as \"giving off a powerful red light that increased and diminished in intensity. \"Jorge Hernandez, an operator in the Puente Dique, stated that \"the light was suspended for more or less 20 minutes and we lost it from sight. ...the light became very strong and then appeared to dim. It moved in bursts (of speed) and then remained immobile. ...It couldn't be a plane or helicopter because of the way it remained still. Some say the lights are related to the dead animals.\" In General San Martin and other localities of the Province of La Pampa, several residents reported \"strange lights\" in recent days. Sheriff Gustavo Martinez, in charge of the Bernasconi section, says he saw a strange light in the sky after neighbors told him to look. \"It changed color and size constantly, sometimes reddish and then blue. It was significantly larger than a star, more like the size of a tennis ball\" in the sky. The Telam News Agency's Capital On Line of Santa Fe Province reported a dead cow in Moises Ville and stated, \"Last Monday (June 17), in the vicinity of La Himalaya, going toward Azopardo, resident Ricardo Rodriguez saw a flying saucer over a nearby hill, beaming a strong white light and with a red colored bottom (to the beam). His brother was able to see something similar in another field on Tuesday night. He was plowing and saw a UFO in a different location, but in the same region.\" El Diario de Parana in the Entre Rios Province reported on June 21 that \"several people claim to have seen a strange luminous effect at the Las Lenas ski resort. The phenomenon occurred near the part of the hill known as La Antena to the locals since the internal radio communications transmitter for the complex is located there.\" One man on a snow rolling machine said he was amazed to see \"an intense multicolored light\" that caused his engine to stop running. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"E-mail from Reed Lindsay on June 22, 2002 after above interview: \"I talked with the journalist covering the story for the Bahia Blanca newspaper. He said 130 registered cases in the area up to this point, but he estimates there could be as many as 300 because many ranchers are not reporting cases for fear that the deaths are caused by disease and that could hurt their sales. He also said there have been many reports of sightings of strange lights, often in the same places the cows were found, but nobody has seen a cow being lifted up by a light. Also, he said he read on the wires today of a case of a guanaco (a species of wild llama) found dead in similar circumstances in Santa Cruz province in southern Patagonia.\" Dr. Daniel Belot, veterinarian for SENASA in Salliquelo, Argentina, was interviewed by a local La Pampa provincial newspaper, Nuevo Dia , which published the following excerpts in its June 15, 2002 edition. The news article was translated by Scott Corrales, Director of the Institute for Hispanic Ufology in Derrick City, Pennsylvania. Daniel Belot, D.V.M., Veterinarian for Argentina's SENASA federal agency, based in Salliquelo, La Pampa, Argentina: 6/15/02 Nuevo Dia : \"Dr. Belot is convinced that the perpetrators arrived by aerial means and is certain that the animals were slain elsewhere and subsequently dumped in the field. Dr. Belot urged our region's cattlemen to report any anomalous case immediately, since he believes that the sooner investigations take place, there is a greater possibility of reaching a solution, which is hitherto completely unknown. Dr. Belot began his story by recalling that a \"cattleman (in Salliquelo) told me he had a dead animal in a field and his attention had been drawn to the fact the animal seemed to be skinned to the bone on one side. I thought this was impossible because it was something I was not familiar with, something utterly abnormal. For that reason I told him that some animal must have eaten it, which the cattleman completely rejected, saying that no animal eats in a straight line. Therefore, I resolved to go and see what was going on.\" \"I was confronted by an unnerving sight. Those who haven't seen it cannot understand the magnitude of the situation.\" Dr. Belot explained that \"the animal lay on the ground like a rabbit and the entire left side of its face was skinned to the bone beneath the eye. All of its molars were visible. When we performed the necropsy we found that it was missing its tongue, all of its vocal apparatus which is to say the larynx and part of the pharynx and something very odd: there was no blood inside or outside the animal. It was perfectly clean. That came as an enormous surprise to us.\" Dr. Belot confirmed that there was no tearing (of flesh) of any kind on the animal. Therefore, he discards the likelihood that predators would have attacked it. \"It is a deed that appears to have been carried out by humans, but even so, it is something very hard to do.\" When asked if he was able to come up with any explanation whatsoever, Dr. Belot confessed that \"my curiosity has not yet been satisfied. I've sent samples to the University of Buenos Aires School of Pathology and the only response I've received is that how the incisions were made cannot be determined.\" Dr. Belot stated that he did not establish the animal's cause of death, going as far as to state that blood samples taken from other animals to detect strange substances \"have yielded no results so far. The ones I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"have received confirm that there is nothing strange in the animals' blood.\" Dr. Belot, who has analyzed more than a dozen of these mutilation cases, remarked that vital organs were missing in most of them. \"In the first case, which is the one I am discussing here, the animal was missing all of its maxillaries (jaw bones), but others were missing testicles and penises. Others were missing ears, others were missing mammary glands, and still others were missing rectums and vaginas. All of this suggests some kind of scientific research, but don't ask me why a scientist is going to conduct research in the middle of different farms without asking for permission because I can't imagine why.\" Dr. Belot said he was astonished about the absence of tracks around the mutilated animals and wondered how it is possible \"for no other animal to come near. ... (Normal) predators would not come close.\" For more information, photographs and drawings about unusual animal deaths linked to glowing aerial objects and beams of light linked to the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon, please see Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II in the Earthfiles Shop.
