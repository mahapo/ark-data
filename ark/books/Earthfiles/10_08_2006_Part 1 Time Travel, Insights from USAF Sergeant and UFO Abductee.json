They are us (from far in the future.) ... They need chromosomes. ...(They are using us) Like Band-Aids.\" - USAF S taff Sergeant James Penniston October 8, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Time travel technology has come up so much over the years in both the abduction syndrome and military/intelligence conversations, on and off the record. But in addition to human time travelers from a distant, damaged future trying to survive, there is no question in my mind that our government has been trying to cope for at least sixty years with a wide variety of \"extraterrestrial biological entities,\" which interface with Earth and also use time travel technologies. The complexity of the phenomena and the many unknown agendas keep power-humans in straightjackets. Then when you add the global animal mutilations and human abduction syndrome to the mix, a policy of strict denial about it all was, and is, provoked. But I keep doing my work because I do not agree that lies and denials are ever the correct policies - especially in a country that is supposed to be a \"government of the people, by the people, and for the people.\" The following was first presented in my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998. C hristmas week in December 1980 was a tense and confusing time for several dozen men at the joint United States and English Royal Air Force Base at Bentwaters near the southeastern coast of the British Isles. In the early morning hours of December 26, odd lights were seen moving in the Rendlesham forest and various security and military personnel investigated. Two of the security men, Staff Sergeant James Penniston and Airman First Class John Burroughs, had a close encounter with one of the lights. From that time onward, Penniston has had haunting memories and dreams of both the night in the forest and a follow-up debriefing session by intelligence agents who apparently used a drug and hypnosis combination to retrieve further information from Penniston and to possibly erase part of his memory. On September 10, 1994, Jim Penniston volunteered to undergo hypnosis with a hypnotherapist to remember more details of the Bentwaters AFB incidents and his own involvement in t hem. The following is a summary with verbatim excerpts from that 1994 hypnosis session, which I transcribed from an audiocassette recording. Penniston remembered having Christmas Day dinner on December 25, 1980, with his family. Then he returned to work that night at Bentwaters AFB. The hypnosis session began with Penniston describing the appearance of blue and red lights moving in the forest at the East Gate of Bentwaters around 2 a.m. in the early morning of December 26, 1980. Afterward, there were a series of meetings and debriefings with superior officers. Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, Deputy Base Commander at Bentwaters, told Penniston, \"The reports will remain confidential and we should treat the incident as Top Secret and not discuss it with anybody.\" Penniston remembered being told there was radiation where the lights had been, a dosage equivalent to \"five or ten x-rays.\" After his encounter with lights, Penniston received a call to report on December 30, 1980, to the Orderly Room at the head of the 81st Security Police Squadron, Bentwaters. There Major Malcolm Zickler ordered Penniston to report to the Air Force Office of Special "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Investigations (AFOSI) for a meeting to tell his story to AFOSI Special Agent \"G.\" Present also was Major \"B.\" AFOSI's task is to investigate Air Force personnel crimes and other sensitive matters. Therefore, it is the only organization that can legally intrude into the command structure at any level without commanders having full knowledge. Penniston knew he had purposely left out the most significant part of his encounter: approaching a white light, seeing a large disc-shaped craft with raised symbols on its surface, reaching out to touch the symbols and receiving binary code information. Penniston was asked to wait while the officers talked outside in the hall with unidentified men. Through the wall, Penniston overheard the name \"D. S. 8 or A,\" or \"D. C. 8 or A.\" Most likely it was DS8, Britain's Ministry of Defence Secretariat \"responsible for dealing with complaints of low-flying aircraft,\" according to Sky Crash about the December 1980 Bentwaters AFB mystery © 1984 by Brenda Butler, Jenny Randles and Dot Street. Agent G returned to introduce two more men who asked Penniston to repeat his story a second time. He did, but again left out touching the raised symbols on the craft's hull. Then Agent G left to confer privately outside his office yet again and two other agents came back to tape record the third telling of Penniston's story. Excerpts from September 1994 Hypnosis Session With Former USAF Staff Sergeant James Penniston Event: Lights and Disc Encounter Bentwaters AFB, England, December 26, 1980 The agents asked Sgt. Penniston to sign a release so he could be given Sodium Pentothal (thiopental) combined with hypnosis. Thiopental is a barbiturate, which induces unconsciousness smoothly and rapidly and has been referred to as a \"truth serum\" when used with hypnosis techniques. The agents told Sgt. Penniston the session would be recorded by two tape recorders. Penniston said he agreed \"to get them off my back. They seemed a lot happier after I signed the release.\" Penniston remembered that the agents at Bentwaters had him \"lay down on a walnut table\" and that a \"British guy\" got the needle ready. An American said the procedure would not hurt, that \"it's standard procedure and not to worry about it. We've done it before.\" The questions began about the lights that appeared at the Bentwaters AFB Eat Gate at zero, zero, zero, two hours (00:02 AM) on December 26, 1980.

Mathematical theory says that if matter approaches the speed of light, time appears to slow down to an external observer. If you were the matter, you would notice no difference in time. The closer you got to the speed of light, c , the slower time would go. If you reached c , time would stop. Then if you could exceed c , time would reverse - but only to the outside observer. You, the traveler going faster than light, would have no reference point for time change until you returned to your physical starting point on Earth, for example, and slowed back down to normal speeds. Then you would find you had returned to the past like the famous limerick: T here once was a lady named Bright who traveled much faster than light. She departed one day in a relative way and came home the previous night. Theoretical physicist Kurt Godel described in his book, Albert Einstein: Philosopher- Scientist, a particular kind of rotating galaxy in which \"by making a round trip on a rocket ship in a sufficiently wide curve, it is possible in these worlds to travel into any region of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the past, present and future, and back again, exactly as it is possible in other worlds to travel to distant parts of space. \"This state of affairs seems to imply an absurdity. For it enables one, for example, to travel into the near past of those places where he has himself lived ... But the velocities which would be necessary in order to complete the voyage in a reasonable length of time are far beyond everything that can be expected ever to become a practical possibility: ...the velocity of the ship must be at least one over the square root of two of the velocity of light.\" Repeating what Penniston recalled in hypnosis: B ritish Ministry of Defence Memo that references \"several entities near RAF Bentwaters on the night of December 29/30 1980.\" The date discrepancy with Jim Penniston's account is because several events took place over several nights."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"J anuary 13, 1981, report to the Royal Air Force/CC by Bentwaters USAF Deputy Base Commander, Lt.
