Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 2 - The Apollo Program, Cape Canaveral and UFOs © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Previous Part 1 In 1968, Jim Oglesby did nightly sky watches for UFOs in Bithlo, Florida, about 32 miles west of Cape Canaveral. Back then, it was sparsely populated with ranches, a few homes, and a cluster of mobile homes. August 20, 2004 DeLand, Florida - By mid-September 1968, Jim Oglesby had been going out nightly to watch the skies around Bithlo, Florida, for the unidentified glowing objects he had been seeing there since New Year's Eve 1967. (See Part 1 ) In addition to the mysterious craft that seemed to provoke military helicopters and jets to arrive, Jim had seen both a red glowing \"cigar\" and an amber beam of light right above the orange grove at the edge of Pickett Lake in February to March 1968. Then about six months later on September 16, 1968, it was such a memorable evening that he wrote what happened in a journal he kept about all his sightings. That night, he was parked in front of the orange grove around 7:30 p.m. He had invited his mother, niece, and a friend and fellow employee named Larry Kelly, who brought along one of his friends.

Postal Service letter carrier 1977 to 1987; former machine tool technician for Bendix Corp.'s Cape Canaveral's Apollo 11 program in the 1960s; U. S. Navy in Vietnam from February 1962 to June 8, 1966, now living in DeLand, Florida: \"Suddenly the five of us looked up north from where we were standing and I saw an amber beam of light. It just flooded the top of the orange grove. I reacted by climbing over the gate holding an 8mm movie camera in my left hand and began running toward the end of the orange grove. As I got down to the end, I stopped. I felt very apprehensive because I knew that something was going on near the shore of Lake Pickett. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"So I turned left and I started running west and there were piles of debris, old orange trees and that sort of thing stacked up. But I kept running and I felt like there was something going on that I should not be in there. I stopped and I'm sweating and my heart is pounding. About this time, Larry Kelly and his buddy almost ran into the back of me because they were trying to find their way through the dark. YOU STOPPED BECAUSE INTUITIVELY YOU HAD A SENSE OF FEAR? Yes, very apprehensive sense of fear that I was running headlong into something I was not familiar with, that I did not understand. SO WHAT HAPPENED? I'm trying to look through the dark and I see on the left hand side of the debris where I'm standing an outline of a greyish oval shape. It seemed to be probably several feet above the ground. I'm looking at this with Larry Kelly and his buddy. I'm very panicky, ready to bolt at any second, because I sensed that something strange was going on. We saw an oval-shaped craft very distinctly hovering several feet above the shoreline (of Pickett Lake in Bithlo). Then I saw a pair of car lights come on, probably 60-70 feet to the right of where I was standing. At that time, we just froze and stood very still. The car lights started to turn, so we knew the car was turning around. At that time, we turned around and bolted back to where we were parked on the curb and stood there watching from behind bushes.

I can only draw this conclusion because of previous things that happened back in February and March which tied in with this September 15th event. I thought maybe there was an extraterrestrial craft rendezvous with someone in the dark sedan and I could only figure the car would have been from Cape Canaveral. YOUR IMPLICATION IS THAT SOMEBODY FROM CAPE CANAVERAL, OR SOMEBODY OFFICIAL, WAS ON A RENDEZVOUS WITH WHATEVER WAS IN THAT DISK? Correct. NOW, COULD YOU GO BACK TO FEBRUARY AND MARCH 1968 AND EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS YOU SAW THAT RESONATED FOR YOU SO STRONGLY WITH THE SEPTEMBER 15, 1968 EVENT? February 17, 1968 - Red, Glowing Cigar-Shaped Aerial Object At approximately 7:30 p.m., I was traveling east on State Road 420 when suddenly a red, luminous cylindrical-shaped, or cigar-shaped, object rose above the field to my left. It aimed its nose skyward at an oblique angle and then glided along perpendicular to my car before zipping away. The incident happened about a hundred yards west of the following encounter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Jim Oglesby traveling on State Road 420 in Bithlo on February 17, 1968, around 7:30 p.m., sees red, glowing cigar-shaped object.

I was parked near the corner of State Road 420 and Old Fort Christmas Road. I observed a flashing blue light appear above cattle in field across the Fort Christmas Road where I was parked. The cattle had bedded down for the night. The flashing blue light remained stationary above the cattle. Cows became freaked by the strange flashing light and began to run around in a circle. Moments later, the flashing blue light vanished from sight as a jet came in from a northeasterly direction. The jet flew low and directly over the location where the flashing blue light had vanished from moments earlier. The jet then banked to the south and did not come back for a second pass. The flashing blue light returned to its original location above the cattle. The cows continued to run helter-skelter around the general area, obviously quite agitated and disturbed by the mysterious blue light. I watched the blue light for several seconds before it vanished from sight. Jim Oglesby was parked near the corner of State Road 420 and Old Fort Christmas Road on February 27, 1968, around 7:30 p.m., when a flashing blue light appeared above cattle, soon followed by the appearance of a jet.

March 4, 1968 - B-52 Appears Above Cattle Pasture About five days later on March 4, 1968, around 8:30 p.m., I was parked off the side of Fort Christmas Road about two hundred yards southeast of the February 27, 1968, event with blue flashing light over the cattle. I watched a B-52 rise above the dark tree line on the south or right side of Fort Christmas Road. The mammoth plane was just above the treetops and was headed in a westerly direction. Suddenly, a brilliant flash of light emitted from beneath the huge jet. The brilliant lights came in sequences of threes. I counted four sequences. At that point, I could no longer see the jet, but moments later I heard the powerful jets kick in. I reasoned that the crew's mission was completed and they were returning to Patrick Air Force Base. I listened until the thunderous roar of the jet engines were out of hearing range. I concluded that one or more UFOs had been identified on radar a few minutes earlier and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the B-52 had been sent to the UFO hot spot to attempt to photograph whatever was happening. Hence, the brilliant flashes of light emitted from the plane's belly. Jim Oglesby parked near the cattle and jet event on March 4, 1968, around 8:30 p.m., when a B-52 suddenly rose up over trees emitting a bright flash of light from its belly.

March 6, 1968 - Red, Glowing \"Cigar-shaped\" Aerial Object Jim Oglesby standing on front steps of Bithlo, Florida, mobile home when red cigar-shaped aerial object rises up above trees near the curve on State Road 420. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby. On the night of March 6, 1968, I was standing outside on the front porch of my brother- in-law's mobile home and I was scanning the skies as usual and I was looking north to northeast position. I was waiting on a friend of mine, Bill Barber. He was going to come over that night and join me. He was interested in some of the UFO activity that I had alleged I was seeing. So I was watching for his car lights to show up because I knew the direction he was coming. So while I was standing on the porch, and this was probably around 7:30 p.m. and it was a very clear and cold night. I'm looking in that direction north to northeast direction and the first thing I noticed was a red-amber cylindrical glow rising up from an area and then it kind of tilted up and slanted on an oblique angle. I'm going to guess it moved 300 to 400 feet and seemed to be just above the curve on State Road 420. THIS LIGHT THAT YOU SAW COMING UP WAS FROM BEHIND THE TREES THAT SURROUND PICKETT LAKE? Yes. As it rose up, it paused above the road. At that time, I noticed a pair of car lights was weaving its way along State Road 420 and several minutes later, it pulled up in the front yard and it was my friend, Bill Barber. So, I shared the experience with him which gave him some cold chills when I told him he had passed under the luminous red cylindrical- shaped object. I concluded it was the same object that I had seen on February 17. March 17, 1968 - Amber Beam of Light"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jim Oglesby standing in the yard near his brother-in-law's Bithlo, Florida, mobile home when an amber beam of light suddenly appeared above the trees near spot of previous red, cigar-shaped object. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby. On the evening of March 17, 1968, I'm standing out in the front yard and I see an amber beam of light just suddenly appear in the darkness. THIS IS DIFFERENT. THE MARCH 6 WAS A RED GLOWING OBJECT. NOW YOU ARE SEEING AN AMBER BEAM OF LIGHT. Correct. It just seemed to appear in the dark. If I think back to the March 6 event, I am thinking that this amber beam of light was more of a north direction, to the left of the March 6 event. So, it was probably on for three or four seconds. I even pointed it out to my brother-in-law. He was a little uneasy about all the strange anomalous lights that were appearing and events that were happening around his home. So, he went back to his mobile home. By that time, the amber beam of light had gone out. AND YOU ARE MAKING A LINK TO THE SEPTEMBER 15, 1968, BECAUSE YOU HAD SEEN THE RED, GLOWING DISK-SHAPED OBJECT AND THE AMBER BEAM IN ABOUT THE SAME AREA OF LAKE PICKETT AS THE EVENT ON SEPTEMBER 15 SAW THE CAR LIGHTS COME ON WHEN THE OBJECT WAS AT THE LAKE AS WELL? Correct. I even went down to the lake and measured the distance from the end of the orange grove up to the point where I had observed the September 15th red oval or circular craft that night. I had come up with about 200 to 250 feet. So if I am going back to my position at March 6 and I'm looking at the angle that I saw the amber-red glowing object and then on March 17 where I saw the amber beam of light and there's only 250 or so feet difference, then it's in close proximity to the September 15th event. March 19, 1968 - Blue Light Flashing from Rod On this particular cold, clear night between 7:30 to 7:40 p.m., I remember sitting at the table eating dinner when I got a sudden impulse to go outside. I excused myself and slipped quietly outside. I stood on the porch for a moment and then I went down the steps, around the front of the mobile trailer and moved slowly to the backside of the trailer. I peaked around the corner and saw hovering very close to the living room windows a metallic disk about two feet or so in diameter. On the top and nearest me was a flashing blue light coming from what appeared to be a thin cylindrical-shaped rod. I could see the flashing blue light reflected off the metallic surface of the small disk. As soon as my eyes locked onto the small disk, it shot up and for the moment seemed to have vanished. However, as I scanned the terrain west of my position, I caught sight of the small disk as it was gliding along at a steady pace until it vanished."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Jim Oglesby looking outside Bithlo mobile home on March 19, 1968, discovered small, metallic disk about two feet in diameter hovering near the living room windows and flashing a blue light.

My brother Gary had told Bill about some of the UFO sightings that he and I had watched on numerous occasions. He brought with him that night a six-pack of beer. The three of us were standing in the kitchen listening to music and enjoying the beer. Suddenly, I noticed a blue sphere hovering in the middle of the living room. It was about two feet in diameter. All three of us watched the sphere vibrate intensely before it zipped to the right and literally passed right through the wall on the west side of the house. Jim Oglesby with his brother, Gary, and friend, Bill, were amazed the night of March 20, 1968, when a blue sphere suddenly appeared hovering in the middle of the living room where they were talking and drinking beer.

February 1970 - Blond Beings and Time Travel YOU AND I HAVE TALKED ABOUT YOUR FIRSTHAND EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS AS A PERSON WHO WAS WORKING IN CAPE CANAVERAL AT THE TIME THAT WE WERE SENDING UP THE APOLLOS. JULY OF 1969 WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT WE HAD MEN ON THE MOON. YOU WERE SEEING ALL OF THESE UNUSUAL EVENTS. AT ANY POINT IN YOUR LIFE, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY KIND OF A FACE-TO-FACE OR OTHER INTERACTION WITH WHAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE THE INTELLIGENCE, OR ONE OF THE INTELLIGENCES, ASSOCIATED WITH THE CRAFT? In February 1970, I had been sharing a lot of the experiences with various individuals and the word was spreading around the general area where I was working. A man named George Hughes, who I think worked for Boeing at the time and was interested in the UFO activity, came out to visit me one night. Even though it was only around 9:00 p.m., my wife had already retired to bed because her work day starts early. George and I were sitting at"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the kitchen table to look at some UFO documents and pictures he had brought. I was sharing some of my experiences when I felt a presence in the house. George also looked at me and said, 'Someone is in the house.' We were looking around and I couldn't feel a localized energy. It just seemed to be in the house. It didn't seem to be in one specific spot. We talked awhile longer, but my attention was on the presence or energy that seemed to be looking in on us at the table. After George left, I went to bed and found it very hard to sleep. I tossed and turned and remembered seeing the clock at 10:05 p.m. That's when I thought a figure was standing next to the bed. Because it was dark, I could not make out any physical features. Then it was as if the bedroom faded away and part of me (not my body) started rising vertically like a fast elevator. When the acceleration stopped, I was looking at a very beautiful craft and a being that looked straight at me with deeply penetrating, clear, dark blue eyes. WHAT COLOR WAS THE CRAFT? Whitish, kind of bluish. But the sky was very white, very brilliant, with some blue in it. Very, very bright, intense. Blond being and \"beautiful craft\" which humans were being transported to from Earth, as Jim Oglesby remembers from an out of body experience in February 1970. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby. The being that seemed to be looking directly at me - or through me - spoke three words, yet his lips did not move. So I took this to be telepathic. He said, 'We have come.' And I noticed that his arms were raised out and facing forward. Artistic rendition of the blond being in close-up, based on what Jim saw as the being stood in front of the craft. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby. Then I noticed off to the sides of this incredibly beautiful craft and the blond being, there were ships rising and ships descending and there were people getting out of the craft that ascended after being picked up from Earth. AND THEY WERE HUMAN? They were human. COULD YOU SEE ANY OF THOSE HUMANS RISING IN BEAMS?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I could only see human beings entering the craft. WHAT WAS THE ENVIRONMENT OF THE PEOPLE EMOTIONALLY, OR THE WORLD? WAS THERE SOMETHING HAPPENING? It seemed to be something happening because I definitely remember seeing the sky very brilliantly white light, but yet there was some blue mixed in with the light. But the predominant color was a very intense bright light. WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED TO MAKE THE SKY SO WHITE? After thinking about it, the light could have been several implications, but with the state of the world today, it's a possibility it could have been some kind of nuclear explosions and they were evacuating, saving, these people off the planet. MEANING THE BEAUTIFUL BEING AND CRAFT WERE LIFTING HUMANS OFF TO SAVE THEM? Yes, that was my feeling. YOU WERE BEING SAVED AS A PART OF THAT? Well, it's interesting. I was trying to look at my part in this. I do remember as viewing this from a viewpoint. I was like observing this event. Yet, I felt like the being at one time was looking directly at me, but then he was looking through me. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU? (long pause) I don't quite know for sure. It seems like I was a part of it, but not a part of it. DID ANYTHING MORE HAPPEN BESIDES HIM SAYING, 'WE HAVE COME,' AND YOUR SEEING PEOPLE GOING UP INTO THE BEAUTIFUL CRAFT? No, after that event happened, the next thing I know is that I'm coming back down that vertical fast elevator effect back to my body. I remember waking up and I was drenched in sweat and my heart was pounding. Needless to say, I didn't sleep the rest of the night. What's weird is that I could see the clock again and it said 10:10. That means that whole trip up and down wherever I went took only five minutes. June 1974 - Beam of Light in Bedroom NOTHING MORE HAPPENED IN 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973. BUT WHEN YOU GET TO 1974, WHAT HAPPENED? In 1974 in the middle of the summer I'm going to guess probably in June. I know there was lightning bugs out and I remember in this particular night it was a very hot night so all the windows in the mobile home open. Our air conditioning was not working at that time. My wife had gone to bed and I had the television on and I was watching a program and I got the feeling to go outside, which I had done numerous times before when I thought there was an extraterrestrial craft about in the sky. So I turned off the TV and I went to the front door and opened it and peeked outside. I'm looking in the sky I would have been looking south and about 45 degrees off the horizon and I see a luminous object moving very slowly in the sky. Then it stopped. At that time, I watched it for a few seconds and then closed the door and went back to bed. I'm stretched out on the bed and I hear my wife say, 'There's a craft above the trailer and there's a being inside.' I look up and she's sitting up in bed next to me. By the way, she's never had an experience like this before in her life. This was a first for her. But she said there was a being inside the craft and she described the being as kind of a bluish tunic and dark blue eyes. She described his long, golden shoulder-length hair and described some of his facial features a very full face and emanating a look of understanding and love. He was holding a device, or rather gripping a device in both hands, and it was aimed down through the bottom of the craft. She said it reminded her of a jackhammer, but it had holes on the side and a lot of really brilliant light was coming or flowing through the circular holes on the side of this device."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Artistic rendering of his wife's vision of blond being operating equipment inside a craft that she sensed was directly above their house in June 1974. Illustration 2004 by Jim Oglesby. There was a beam of light coming down through the bottom of the craft and she told me that the being said I was going to feel this beam of light and that it would going to work over a specific area in my body. Artistic rendering of a healing energy beam coming down from the craft's technology into Jim Oglesby's solar plexus, as his wife sits as if tranquilized. Illustration © 2004 by Jim Oglesby. At the time, I had some what I thought of as blockage in my emotional body, for want of a better description. So as a beam of light flowed over my body, I just felt very, very warm, very soothing, very freeing inside of my being and even brought me to tears. BECAUSE WHY? Something that the beam affected inside my emotional body, that it freed something up inside of me it's hard to explain. As the months went by, I realized that I had a healing inside my emotional body I guess, similar to if you go to a psychologist and you go through some therapy training. You work through an emotional blockage. But it was an instantaneous flow from that beam that affected loosening up that blockage. ANYMORE TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION? Interestingly enough, when she (wife Laura) was describing to me, her tone of voice, her words were very slow and very measured words. When that beam was finished, the being asked me through her: 'Is there anything else you would like to know?' And I said, 'When will they be back?' And he said, 'When you are ready.' Of course, that was 1974. WE'RE AT 2004. IN THE 30 YEARS SINCE HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANY DREAMS OR OTHER INTERACTIONS WITH THESE BEAUTIFUL BLOND BEINGS? I have had since 1974, I have had one more interaction with what I believe was a being in 1976. By this time, I had moved from where I was living out in the country into Orlando. WHAT HAPPENED? On this particular night, I was watching television and my wife was in the bedroom. She"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"comes out of the bedroom and hits the switch on the television, turns it off. She has never done that before. She said, 'Let's go outside.' So, once again, they were working through her and we went outside and sat on the front lawn and there I could see a luminous craft moving very slowly and it stopped. I feel a pulse of energy emanating from the craft that came down and it just kind of enveloped both of us. We were looking at each other and it was a very intimate loving feeling of understanding. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVE HAD NO OTHER CONTACT FOR THIRTY YEARS? I think in terms of these beings and their relationship with time is very different than our relationship with time. If I think of the time from 1974 to 2004, thirty years, in our time that's a lot of time. But the way they measure time, the way time works for them, that could just be a matter of weeks or months, or less. WHAT DO YOU THINK THESE BEAUTIFUL BLOND BEINGS WANT? I read that George Adamski in the 1950s also talked about blond beings who told him that men of Earth are in bondage to habits which have so bound them that their intuitive spiritual self has been chained to these habits and controlled by them. He said if human beings can somehow find a way to break these habits and open up their intuitive side of life, then the blond beings will help them. And I took that to heart. I'm going to have to do my part to meet them sort of half way. I'm looking at the habits in my life that are keeping me from open, intuitive relationships. SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED THE BLONDS ARE TIME TRAVELERS FROM EARTH OR SOMEWHERE ELSE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? The blonds might be more like time or dimensional travelers.We humans have the capability as spiritual beings to inhabit or to operate in those other frequencies and time lines that the blonds are operating in. NOT IN THESE BODIES, BUT IN OUR SOUL/SPIRIT? Yes, in a higher octave of matter. THAT THEY ARE COMMINGLING THROUGH SPIRIT, MIND AND SOUL AS OPPOSED TO WHAT WE THINK OF AS BODY TO BODY AND MATTER TO MATTER? Yes. I have a choice. In my own experiences, I have a choice about whether or not I want to open myself up to have this rapport with them or not. It's strictly my choices every day. Those choices either work me in their direction, or work me away from them.\" More Information: See An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II at Earthfiles Shop.
